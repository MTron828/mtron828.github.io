2015 The stormy seas (2)

Enough! Li Yifu scolded,ah hai! I think you’ve been too comfortable in Italy so your brain has degenerated a little!

Lui Hai’s forehead was full of sweat, and he stammered,Uncle Yi, I ...

You what you! Li Yifu said mercilessly,you also know that destroying the Gelman family will be good for the Hong sect’s development in Italy! Mr. Xia is doing you a favor, and you still don’t know what’s good for you!

Lui hai opened his eyes wide, saying hurriedly,Uncle Yi, I don’t quite understand! Can ... Can you be more specific

How do you want me to explain it clearly Li Yifu said in a bad mood,I can only tell you that since Mr. Xia asked you to do this, he must have his reasons! He wasn’t the kind of person who didn’t care about the life and death of the people below! Since he suggested it, he must be confident!

Li Yifu didn’t know what Xia ruofei was thinking, but he knew that with his grand uncle-master’s strength, he didn’t need the help of the Hong sect at all. He could wipe out a small Mafia group like the Gelman family by himself.

The difference in strength between cultivators and secular gangs was like the difference between cloud and mud. It was an absolute suppression of strength. Even if he faced gangsters who had a lot of hot weapons, the senior granduncle would definitely be able to beat them up. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Perhaps it would be difficult to eliminate a behemoth like the glory society by one person, but the Gelman family He was just an eyesore!

However, since Xia ruofei wanted the Turin branch of the Hong sect to be involved, he must have his own reasons. The Hong sect did not need to think too much. They just had to follow his orders.

Li Yifu said in his heart,ah hai, this kid is usually quite clever, why is he so wishy – washy now

In fact, it was not that lui Hai’s thinking was rigid, but that he could not understand the terrifying strength of a cultivator. He was used to judging Xia ruofei’s suggestion from the perspective of ordinary people. Therefore, the plan that was not difficult for Xia ruofei became crazy in his eyes.

After hearing Li Yifu’s words, lui hai was also shocked. He was dumbfounded and didn’t speak for a long time.

Ah hai, Li Yifu said meaningfully.Some people’s strength can’t be judged with common sense. Do you understand

Lui hai quivered and said hurriedly,I understand this! Uncle Yi, you’re the best example!

There was a rumor within the Hong sect that Li Jiu Zhou’s longevity was because he had cultivated an immortal’s spell technique. The strength that Li Jiu Zhou had displayed in his early years had also indirectly confirmed this.

Li Yifu had also shown his strength a few years ago. An old man in his 70s or 80s was able to beat the Hong sect’s double flower red rod with one finger. This kind of power had exceeded the common understanding of ordinary people and could not even be explained by science.

Mr. Xia has instructed that you can’t say too much about him, Li Yifu said lightly.But you just have to remember one thing, and that is that Mr. Xia’s strength far exceeds mine!

Li Yifu didn’t want to say too much because of Xia ruofei’s order. But he could tell that lui hai was still suspicious. Li Yifu was worried that lui hai would be hesitant and ruin the Grand uncle master’s plan, so he revealed some information to lui hai after some consideration.

Lui hai felt like he was struck by lightning, his head was buzzing. Li Yifu’s words were like a bomb that had been thrown into a calm lake, causing lui hai to lose his ability to think.

He was much stronger than his adopted uncle. What did that mean

This Mr. Xia didn’t look strong, and the key was that he was so young. Even if he had started practicing martial arts in his mother’s womb, he couldn’t be stronger than his adopted uncle!

Of course, lui hai didn’t doubt Li Yifu’s words at all, and he didn’t think Li Yifu was exaggerating, because he didn’t need to.

Could it be that this Mr. Xia had actually cultivated to the legendary realm of everlasting appearance, and his actual age was even older than his adopted uncle Lui hai couldn’t help having some random thoughts.

Li Yifu said lightly,ah hai, stop guessing. Mr. Xia is only in his twenties this year. The world of geniuses is not something you or I can imagine!

Li Yifu had seen through lui Hai’s thoughts, so he said with embarrassment,I know, uncle Yi!

Li Yifu said seriously,ah hai, if this matter can be said by me and heard by you, it will end here. Mr. Xia doesn’t like to be public. Don’t mention this matter to anyone, understand

Yes! Uncle Yi, don’t worry! I’m keeping my mouth shut! Lui Hai’s heart skipped a beat, and he immediately swore.

Mm! Remember my words and cooperate! Li Yifu said,no matter what request Mr. Xia makes, you must do your best to fulfill it unconditionally, without hesitation, and without hesitation! Do you understand

Understood! Lui hai puffed out his chest and said.

After hanging up the phone, lui hai was still in a bad mood. He smoked a cigarette in the corridor, then turned around and walked into the conference room.

In the small meeting room, Lu zhengfeng was having a heated discussion with his subordinates.

In the beginning, Lyu zhengfeng thought that this plan was unrealistic, but Lyu hai ordered him to carry out Xia ruofei’s order with a proper attitude. Out of his long – term respect for his cousin, he carried it out to the letter.
