Xia ruofei saw a trace of resentment in fatty an and Wang xingshui’s eyes. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, in Xia ruofei’s eyes, fatty an was an insignificant character. He would not take the hatred of a small fry to heart.

If fatty an admitted that he was unlucky, then so be it. But if he really dared to have any ill – intentions towards Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei wouldn’t mind teaching him a lesson.

After fatty an and Wang xingshui left, Xu Qiang said to Xia ruofei with great enthusiasm,”Master Xia, it’s all thanks to you this time! I’ll make the arrangements for lunch today. I want to thank master Xia properly!”

Zhao Yongjun’s mouth twitched, and he laughed,””Qiangzi, you’re really a miser! RUO Fei has helped you so much, and you’re just going to give him a meal?”

Xu Qiang gently smacked his own mouth and said,””It’s my fault for not considering it properly! Brother Jun, master Xia, in order to express my gratitude, I’ll give you one of the items in the shop as a small token of my appreciation! But ... Hehe ... That rice cream ...”

“Alright, alright!” Zhao Yongjun said with a look of disdain,”I know that it’s your treasure. Ruofei won’t want it!”

Then, Zhao Yongjun laughed and said to Xia ruofei,””RUO Fei, qiangzi is very sincere. Go down and pick a small thing!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no need. I just happened to see it and just reminded you. There’s no need to thank me.” Brother Zhao’s friends are my friends!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Xu Qiang quickly said,”young master Xia, if it weren’t for you today, I would have lost two million Yuan. It’s not a big deal, but if this gets out, I’d have no place to hide my face! So, you’ve saved my reputation! It’s just a small gift, please don’t reject it!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed,”see that, ruofei?” If you don’t accept it, qiangzi will definitely feel bad!”

Song Rui also laughed and chimed in,””RUO Fei, isn’t it just an antique? It’s not like boss Xu’s business is so big that he can’t afford it. Why do you have to reject someone’s kind intentions?”

Even Guo Ruchen, who had white hair and a white beard, chimed in,””Little brother, boss Xu is famous for being stingy! Today, you’re able to pluck a hair from the miser’s body. You can’t miss such a rare opportunity ...”

“Old Guo, how did I become a miser?” Xu Qiang said with some embarrassment. It’s clearly the righteous and generous little Meng ...”

“Go, go, go!” Guo Ruchen laughed and scolded,”you still have the face to say that? I’ve been thinking about that Mi Fu calligraphy for so many years. I’ve exchanged so many good things with you, but you ...”

“Old Guo, that’s a different matter! That’s the treasure of my shop!” Xu Qiang smiled.”Brother Jun has been thinking about it for a long time, but I really can’t change it. Otherwise, my dad will break my leg ...”

Seeing that everyone was trying to persuade him, Xia ruofei could only nod helplessly and say,””Alright then! Then, thank you, boss Xu ...”

Xu Qiang was overjoyed when he heard this and said,”young master Xia, let’s go downstairs now!” Take your time, except for Mi Fei’s copybook, you can take anything you like! After this, I’ll arrange a banquet to thank you!”

Xu Qiang was trying his best to make friends with Xia ruofei. On one hand, he judged that Xia ruofei and song Rui were young masters from rich families like Zhao Yongjun, and they were worth making friends with. On the other hand, Xia ruofei’s ability to identify relics was an eye – opener for him. He was in the antique business. If he needed help in this area in the future, Xia ruofei could help him identify them. It would be a big profit.

However, Xu Qiang didn’t know that Xia ruofei didn’t know how to identify antiques! He just said the few words that Xia Qing had sent him without missing a word.

Xu Qiang enthusiastically brought Xia ruofei and the others to the shop downstairs.

When the employees saw their boss personally bring the guests down, they all perked up.

As soon as they arrived at the shop, Xu Qiang generously asked Xia ruofei to pick an item.

Xia ruofei did not have the intention to rip him off. He just wanted to pick something that was reasonably priced and let this matter go.

However, the Chinese valued their reputation and Xia ruofei could not be too obvious. Hence, he pretended to be serious and started shopping.

Xu Qiang’s shop was very big. This floor was at least 300 square meters, which was a relatively large shop in pan garden.

The antique store naturally had a variety of items.

Xia ruofei shuttled between the counters and display shelves, admiring all kinds of exquisite antiques while observing carefully. He was prepared to take something that was not very expensive later. Not only did he take into account Xu Qiang’s kind intentions, but he also felt okay.

However, when Xia ruofei walked to a display stand, he paused for a moment and a look of surprise flashed in his eyes.

Xu Qiang and Zhao Yongjun didn’t disturb Xia ruofei while he was shopping. They stood beside the counter and chatted, so no one noticed the change in Xia ruofei’s expression.

Xia ruofei said to himself,”I didn’t expect this shop to have such good stuff!”

Just now, when Xia ruofei turned to this display shelf, he immediately felt a vibration in his palm. It was the vibration of the spirit map scroll.

According to Xia ruofei’s experience, there were only two reasons for the spirit map scroll to vibrate. One was when there was a high – Quality Jade nearby, and the other was when a world stone was discovered.

However, Xia ruofei was still wearing a jade talisman that Xia Qing had specially used to sense the world stone.

If there were any realm stones nearby, Xia ruofei would not even need to walk into the shop. As long as he was nearby, the sensing jade talisman on his chest would start to heat up.

Today, the Jade talisman did not respond at all.

This meant that it was the Jade that caused the spirit painting to shake.

Furthermore, after Xia ruofei took two steps forward, the spirit painting trembled even more violently.

One must know that Xia ruofei had bought a raw jade stone before. When he was choosing, he had to touch the stone before the painting would shake.

It was only that time when he had bought a world stone by chance. It was also the first time that the spirit map scroll had reacted before he had even touched the stone.

There were no world stones here, which meant that the quality of the jadeite found in the spirit map scroll was quite high!

It might even be the highest quality Jade that Xia ruofei had ever seen.

Xia ruofei was also confused because there was no Jade on the display shelf.

The items on display here were all miscellaneous items, such as wood, bamboo, tooth, equipment, purple clay pots, snuff bottles, and so on.

Could it be that there’s a universe in one of the antiques?

Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued.

He walked around the display shelf at a moderate pace. According to the degree of the vibration of the spirit painting scroll, he quickly determined the antique that caused the reaction.

It was a pair of wood carvings, about 40 to 50 centimeters tall. The carving looked okay, but it was definitely not the best. It was a pair of door Gods riding on a divine beast, and the divine beasts under the door Gods were even painted with gold.

Xia ruofei beckoned for the staff nearby to come over. He opened the glass door of the display shelf and held the wood carvings in his hand. As expected, this wood carving was one of the two wood carvings. The moment he held it, it caused the spirit painting to shake even more violently.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel happy in his heart. It seemed that he had really found a treasure.

The display stand wasn’t very eye – catching, and there were many antiques on it. They were all of average value.

Then this pair of wood carvings was definitely underestimated.

Although Xu Qiang said that no matter what he liked, he would give it to him for free, this feeling of picking up scraps was completely different.

“No wonder so many people are dreaming about picking up scraps ...” Xia ruofei said to himself.”This feeling is too good!” I’ll take this pair of wood carvings!”

Xia ruofei gently pinched the pair of wooden sculptures and then carried them to Xu Qiang and the others.
