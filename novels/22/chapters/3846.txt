Liu Mansha also regained her senses. She looked at Xia ruofei with a hint of respect and said," "You're right, sect leader Chen. You really scared me. Fellow cultivator Xia's cultivation speed is absolutely unprecedented!"

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said humbly," "Two seniors really praise me too much, this Junior's luck was just a bit better, and my early cultivation speed was a bit faster, how could I dare to say that I'm unprecedented! If a true peerless genius were to hear this, that would be a huge joke!"

"Brother ruofei, being overly humble is being too arrogant!" Chen Xuan looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression. He smiled and said, "I've always thought that I'm quite talented and lucky. My cultivation speed has always been faster than my peers. However, compared to brother ruofei, it's like a Firefly compared to the bright moon!"

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. If you continue to praise me like this, I'll be too embarrassed to stay here ... Please spare me!"

Chen Nanfeng and the others couldn't help but laugh.

In the following time, Chen Nanfeng no longer mentioned Xia ruofei's cultivation. He did not even ask why Xia ruofei had come. He just casually chatted with everyone about some anecdote of the cultivation world.

As they chatted, Xia ruofei found out why Liu Mansha and Lu You had come to the first heaven society.

Liu Mansha had spared no effort in nurturing Lu You. She had brought Lu You to the first heaven society this time to help Lu You improve her strength.

The first heaven school had a formation called the prime void formation. It had a long history and was left from the peak of the cultivation world. This formation was very helpful to Qi refining cultivators as its main purpose was to purify their Zhen Qi.

After Qi condensation cultivators absorbed spiritual energy, they would convert it into true Qi in their dantian. Only when they broke through to the Golden core stage would the true Qi evolve into Yuan Qi.

On the other hand, cultivators absorbed spiritual Qi from different sources. There was spiritual Qi from the outside world, spiritual Qi from cultivation resources such as spirit stones, and even the spiritual Qi from consuming some natural treasures.

No matter where it came from, it was impossible for the spiritual Qi to be 100% pure, and the true Qi formed by cultivation was also not 100% pure.

The purity of one's Zhen Qi would, to a certain extent, affect the strength of a cultivator. It would also have a significant impact on breaking through to the Golden core stage in the future.

Especially after the deterioration of the environment in the cultivation world, the spiritual energy in the environment had become more heterogeneous, causing the purity of the genuine Qi in the body of most cultivators to be much lower than that of the cultivators in the heyday of the cultivation world.

Chen Xuan and Liu Mansha were equally shocked. Both of them had made a breakthrough in their cultivation in the past two years, especially Liu Mansha, who had been stuck in the intermediate golden core stage for so many years. She had finally achieved her wish and improved. She did not expect Xia ruofei to reach the same level as her at such a young age. Chen Xuan, on the other hand, had finally managed to raise his cultivation level. He felt that he should be about the same level as Xia ruofei, but he did not expect the gap between them to be so huge.

This shocked the two of them, but at the same time, they couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.

In fact, the truth was even crueler.

Xia ruofei had already reached the late - Stage of the Golden core. Now, he was no longer in the Golden core stage but had broken through to the nascent Soul Stage. Furthermore, his cultivation was still rising rapidly after breaking through to the nascent Soul Stage. He had already surpassed Chen Nanfeng by a large margin.

If Chen Xuan and Liu Mansha knew the truth, they would not only be disappointed, they would also be shocked.

On the other hand, Lu You, who was only in the Qi refining stage, wasn't too surprised. It wasn't that she didn't know what the later stage of the Golden elixir realm meant, but in her heart, Xia ruofei should be so outstanding, or even more outstanding.

After a brief moment of shock, Chen Nanfeng managed to calm himself down. He smiled and said," "Fellow Daoist Xia is truly the most talented cultivator I've ever seen. Even during the legendary peak of the cultivation world, there was no such genius cultivator like fellow Daoist Xia. At least, there are no records of such a person in the preserved ancient books..."¬†

Liu Mansha also regained her senses. She looked at Xia ruofei with a hint of respect and said, "You're right, sect leader Chen. You really scared me. Fellow cultivator Xia's cultivation speed is absolutely unprecedented!"
