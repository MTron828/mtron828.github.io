Wu Liqian’s face was slightly startled, but she quickly pretended to be relaxed and said,””If I have to do everything by myself, won’t I be busy to death? Why do you care so much? In any case, there’s someone to liaise with your company, and you’ll be given all the preferential policies that should be given. Isn’t that enough?”

To Xia ruofei, Wu Liqian’s words had a different meaning. He thought that Wu Liqian was referring to sending people to communicate the specific work details with paradise Corporation. To put it bluntly, she was referring to people who worked.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not think too much about it. He smiled and said,””Sister Qian, aren’t you being too arrogant? Our company’s project is an investment of more than a billion Yuan! As the executive Deputy County Head, aren’t you going to follow up on this personally?”

Wu Liqian didn’t want to dwell on this topic. She was afraid that Xia ruofei would see through her if she couldn’t hide her emotions.

She smiled and said,”when it’s my turn to follow up, I’ll naturally follow up.” Ruofei, this matter has already been approved by the Standing Committee. You just need to follow the normal procedure and negotiate with the county officials. The most important thing is to start the project as soon as possible. ”

“Alright! I’ll listen to you!” Xia ruofei said,”sister Qian, thank you! I’ll treat you to a meal when you’re free!”

Wu Liqian giggled and asked,”do you still want to eat that expensive ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’?” Aren’t you afraid of being eaten poor by me? Oh, that’s right, that’s your family’s business, you really can’t get poor from it ...”

“Don’t tease me!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”I’ll still have to pay for the Ling Ji private kitchen, okay? However, if sister Qian likes the taste of the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, I can call them to pack a portion and send it over to you!”

“Don ‘t!” Wu Liqian quickly said,”I’m not that extravagant ... Besides, this dish is indeed delicious, but it’s still a little greasy. I’m afraid I’ll get fat if I eat too much!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you have such a good figure. What’s there to worry about?” If those chubby girls heard this, they wouldn’t even have the courage to live!”

The two of them didn’t talk about the same topic again. After a few more words of teasing, they hung up the phone. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei was in a good mood since the pharmaceutical factory project was going so smoothly.

Just as he was about to give Feng Jing a call to share the good news, someone knocked on his office door. He then saw Feng Jing push the door open and walk in.

Xia ruofei immediately laughed and said,””Sister ran, I was just about to call you! You’re really telepathic, aren’t you?”

Even though it was just a joke, Feng Rao’s face still turned red. “That’s an inappropriate choice of words!”

“What’s up?”Xia ruofei laughed.

“Good news!” Feng Rao said with a smile. It’s about the bank loan!”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”so fast!” That’s very efficient!”

Then, he leaned back in his chair and said,””Tell me! What’s the situation?”

Feng Jing sat down across Xia ruofei’s desk and smiled.””These two days, I’ve been in contact with the leaders of the southeast Branch of the four major banks. They’re all very enthusiastic about the peach blossom company’s loan. Although they haven’t done a precise evaluation of our assets, they’ve all given us quite a lot of money. Among them, chief Yu of ICBC was the most straightforward. He said that it wouldn’t be a problem even if it was within 1 billion. The other banks have also given us at least 700 to 800 million ...”

“Swish!” Xia ruofei exclaimed,”I’ve really become a hot commodity! Even the bank is rushing to give us money?”

“Isn’t that so?” Feng Jing laughed.”It’s also because our company’s asset structure was too weird. The total assets were already so high, but it actually had zero debts ...”

Feng Jing continued,”combining the conditions that the other banks have offered, I think China Construction Bank should be the most sincere. President Lin said that if it’s less than 800 million, he can directly approve it for us. The money will be transferred to us within two days. Moreover, the interest will be the lowest for commercial loans. He will even give us a 20% discount!”

“The bank’s loan interest can be discounted?” Xia ruofei asked in surprise.

“It all depends on how they do it. The bank has the relevant policies internally!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”for some high – Quality companies or companies with high potential, the bank is willing to give them a considerable amount of preferential treatment. “Our company’s public account is set up by the China Construction Bank, and our employees ‘salaries are also paid through the China Construction Bank. When the Jade skin cream was sold, it often made 100 to 200 million in cash, which was all from the China Construction Bank. So, it’s normal for them to have more confidence in our company.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”if that’s the case, we’ll take a loan from the construction Bank!” But we can’t use up 800 million, right? 500 million should be enough ...”

Feng Rao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”who says they have too much money?” There was a way to spend 800 million Yuan. The more start – up funds there were, the faster the project would progress. In addition, aren’t we planning to commandeer the existing land of Taoyuan farm? The initial investment will definitely increase by a lot, so my opinion is that we should borrow as much as we can. In comparison, a little interest is insignificant!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”sure!” Then let’s talk more! I’ll leave this to you, I only care about the results. In short, just get the money into your account as soon as possible!”
