Zhao Zhenghao finally believed that Xia ruofei really didn’t want the number 10 and didn’t care about the Jersey number. He let out a long sigh of relief.

“Thank you, Mr. Xia, for supporting our work!” Zhao Zhenghao said,”then I’ll tell the national team to keep the number 25 Jersey first!” There are a lot of players on the team this time, and a lot of people have to pick their numbers!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’ve troubled you.”

“What are you saying? it’s as easy as lifting a finger!” Zhao Zhenghao said politely,”just like I said, we will do our best to protect you, Mr. Xia, so that you won’t have any worries!”

After the two of them finished their conversation, they both felt relaxed.

Xia ruofei had the heart to serve the country. Now that the Chinese Football Association could make so many concessions and handle Special Affairs, he would have less trouble. Otherwise, he would have to go through the people above to persuade them.

Of course, he didn’t know that even though he didn’t say anything, the song family and the Liu family had already done the work for him in advance. Otherwise, Zhao Zhenghao wouldn’t be acting like this today.

Zhao Zhenghao let out a sigh of relief. The trip to Spain was perfect, both for the national football team and for him.

After the two of them finished their discussion, they stood up and went to the tea – making area. They drank tea and chatted with Zhou leiyun, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei. Everyone’s topic did not leave football, but the main topic was still the game from yesterday.

In fact, yesterday’s match had attracted widespread attention around the world.

In fact, as long as it was a match with Barcelona, it would definitely attract attention, not to mention the gimmick of the Catalan derby. Although the strength of the Derby was quite different, the Derby itself was full of topics. Teams from the same city would always be full of hostility.

The result of the game was even more dramatic. Barcelona, who had rarely met an opponent in La Liga, was forced to score four goals by the Spanish team in their famous home ground, Nokama, and finally lost the game.

The world’s major sports media reported the game from different angles.

It could be said that this game had become a feast for the global sports media. Everyone’s “gobbling” angle might be different, but there was no doubt that this was a media Carnival.

The headlines of the Chinese media were as exaggerated as they could get.

Titles such as “China’s Twin Stars shined in La Liga, giant bar?a was cut down”,”under his Starlight last night, Messi was dim,””he defeated bar?a alone”,”Xia ruofei and Wu Lei became the Savior of Spain, working together to perform a soul – stirring killing show” and so on could be said to be endless.

The Chinese media couldn’t be blamed for making a fuss. It could be said that Chinese football had been in a slump for the past few years. It was not easy to produce two players who could shine in La Liga, but they had to be praised to death.

Moreover, Xia ruofei and Wu Lei had played a very obvious role in yesterday’s match. Without Xia ruofei and Wu Lei, Espanyol would have lost at least two goals yesterday. Therefore, although the headlines of the Chinese media were a little exaggerated, they were not completely exaggerated. Xia ruofei and Wu Lei’s performance deserved such praise.

If the professional sports media had some restraint when writing their articles, then the online media, netizens, and fans were even more unrestrained. The Chinese fans were really high from yesterday’s game. Although it was already three or fouro’ clock in the middle of the night after the game, no one was sleepy at all. They kept refreshing all kinds of scoring videos on the internet. There were also a large number of posts and replies on Weibo and forums, all related to Xia ruofei and Wu Lei.

The interesting thing was, perhaps he was too excited when he was commentating yesterday. After work ended at four in the morning, Shen fangjian only posted a congratulatory message on Weibo for the Spanish team’s victory and then went back to rest. No one knew if he could fall asleep or not, but he didn’t continue to speak on the internet after that.

This made the netizens very uncomfortable with Wanwan’s style. This wasn’t the style of the “Wu chuitang” and “Xia chuitang” double Hall Masters!

As a result, a large number of netizens flooded to leave comments under Shen fangjian’s Weibo post.

“Hall Master Shen, wake up! Wu Lei and Xia ruofei have already scored. Why are you still sleeping? Hurry up and get up!”

“Hall Master Shen, you should learn more from Hall Master Jia! Look at how professional he is!”

Although Jia Tianning had only posted a Weibo post, he had included a moving picture of Xia ruofei and Wu Lei scoring a goal. In the Weibo post, he didn’t hide his admiration for the two and used many words of praise that some netizens thought were flattering.

Other than that, the headlines and TikTok were also showing highlights of various versions. There were highlights of Xia ruofei’s every touch of the ball, as well as highlights of all the goals scored by both teams throughout the game. There were even netizens who specially cut out the highlights of Xia ruofei’s last amazing Barb ball and went to great lengths to search for several versions of commentary on the internet. There were English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Korean ... The commentary in all languages was thoughtfully accompanied with Chinese subtitles. The title was “see how the world’s commentators praised Xia ruofei’s multi – Language commentary on Xia ruofei’s kill ball”.

Some of the behind – the – scenes footage on the field also attracted a lot of attention.

Two of the videos had made it to the top of the rankings. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

One of the scenes was also an official broadcast. It was the moment when Xia ruofei scored the hook kill. As the Spanish players surrounded Xia ruofei and celebrated wildly, the camera turned to the stands. It happened to capture the first row of the stands, which was closest to the field. An Asian young man was waving his arms happily and shouting something. It was obvious that he could not suppress his excitement at the arrival of the goal.

If it was just the Chinese fans cheering for Xia ruofei’s goal, it would not be a big deal. After all, Chinese people were all over the world. During this period of time, in every game that Wu Lei participated in, there would be Chinese fans in the stands waving red flags with five stars to cheer for him.

The key point was that the cheering Chinese fan was wearing the Barcelona jersey and was in the stands for the Barcelona fans.

It was clear that he was a hardcore bar?a fan.

However, he was cheering and celebrating wildly for the opponent’s player who had scored a kill goal, which formed a strong contrast.

Some of the netizens ‘comments were on point. At that moment, he was a Chinese fan, not a bar?a fan.

Some people even joked,”Barcelona is going to lose?” Who cares! The key was that President Xia had scored a goal! Let’s celebrate! As for whether he would be beaten to death by the bar?a fans after coming down, it was up to whoever! Who could think so much!

The other video was unofficial and should have been shot by a Chinese fan in the stands.

On this side was the Spaniards ‘grandstand. When Xia ruofei’s first shot hit the goal, the people in the grandstand could not help but stand up and stretch their necks. When the shot did not go in, everyone could not help but let out a huge sigh. However, before he could finish his sigh, Xia ruofei had already scored with a beautiful hook. It was a kill!

The moment the goal was scored, perhaps because it was too sudden, everyone was stunned for almost a second before they suddenly burst into loud cheers.

The shot also became violent. On the one hand, the stands were shaking from the cheers of the fans. On the other hand, the fan was so excited that he could not hold the phone firmly.

In addition, the fan’s voice had completely broken, and he was still shouting crazily,”President Xia! President Xia scored a goal! President Xia is awesome! President Xia...President Xia...Killed Barca! President Xia ...”

This pig – like scream could be said to be incoherent and completely broken. At the end, there was a trace of choking. In addition, the image was also shaking so much that the players on the field could not be seen clearly at all. However, there was a shocking feeling, which made the Chinese fans resonate greatly at once.
