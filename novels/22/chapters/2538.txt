Mark Rocca had the most direct understanding of Xia ruofei’s free – kick techniques. He was also the most welcoming of Xia ruofei’s joining, and his hands were almost red from clapping.

Of course, there were also some people who gave a perfunctory applause. In fact, they did not think much of it. This included the young players trained by the Spanish, such as merendo and pouado. They felt that Xia ruofei was just playing around and was not serious.

Pouado, in particular, had just been promoted from the youth team and was a fringe player on the first team. Sometimes he could sit in the substitutes ‘bench for dozens of minutes. If he was lucky, he could get a few minutes of playing time in the final stage. If he was unlucky, he could not even get into the substitutes’ bench and was directly excluded from the big list.

Puado’s position was a little similar to Wu Lei ‘s. After Wu Lei came, his position was even more marginalized, so he was not very interested in Chinese players. He thought that the Chinese were rich and nouveau riche now, and were actually weak in football. No one, including Wu Lei, was worthy of playing in La Liga.

As for Xia ruofei, it was even more impossible for him to meet the standards of a professional player in the top league. Wasn’t he only able to join the team because he was a shareholder of the club and wanted to play?

Rich people really knew how to play! Puaduo snorted coldly in his heart.

Xia ruofei naturally did not know the thoughts of the players below. Even if he knew, he would not care. A player like pouado was of a much higher level than him. To put it bluntly, would a person care about what an ant was thinking?

Xia ruofei walked to Ruby’s side and pressed his hands down. The applause gradually died down.

Xia ruofei’s words shocked everyone. He had to speak in Spanish.

He said,”on the field and training ground, I’m just an ordinary player and I obey the instructions of the coaching staff. I also hope that everyone will not treat me as a shareholder of the club and give me no special treatment. I’ll be the same as everyone else!” I think our goal is the same, and that is to win all the way to the European tournament! For that goal, I will also help the team as much as I can!”

After Xia ruofei finished, he nodded at Ruby, indicating that he could start the training.

Ruby was shocked when he heard Xia ruofei’s words in Spanish. He even wondered if all Chinese people had such a high talent for languages. It was said that Chinese was one of the most complicated languages in the world. For a Chinese to be able to master such a complicated language, it should be easy for them to learn English, French, Spanish, and other languages! Otherwise, how could Xia ruofei speak Spanish so fluently after not seeing him for a few days?

To be honest, Xia ruofei’s impromptu Spanish speech was quite standard in all aspects, including grammar, language habits, and pronunciation, except for the speed.

‘If only Wu could master Spanish so quickly,’ Ruby thought.

When he thought of this, he could not help but look at Wu Lei.

Wu Lei could feel Ruby’s eyes on him. He could even guess what Ruby was thinking. He could only squeeze out a smile that was uglier than crying as a response to Ruby’s anticipation.

Ruby gestured to the assistant coach to bring everyone to training. He then said to Xia ruofei,”Mr. Xia, if you don’t mind, I hope to arrange some tests for you first ... The coaching team needs to know the details of your body so that we can reasonably arrange the tactics for the game the day after tomorrow and your playing time.”

Ruby was also worried that Xia ruofei’s physical fitness was not good enough to last for a long time. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Of course, no problem! I’ve said it before, whether it’s training or competition, you’re the highest decision maker. I won’t interfere!”

Ruby was secretly relieved. To be honest, he had some contradictions in his heart about bringing in Xia ruofei. On one hand, he felt that it would be a pity not to bring in such a good killer. On the other hand, he was also a little worried that there would be an old man in the team who would point fingers at the team’s command and then dominate the locker room, making a mess of the team.

Of course, in the end, Ruby was still reluctant to give up the precise free kick, which was a very important killer weapon for a mid – to – Low level team. He still chose to bring in Xia ruofei. However, he had always been a little apprehensive. He was worried that Xia ruofei would interfere with the team’s command and weaken his prestige.

Xia ruofei’s two statements and actions finally put Ruby at ease.

He quickly arranged for a physical trainer to take Xia ruofei to do a series of physical exercises, while he stayed in the training ground to lead the other players to do some tactical exercises, which might be useful against the Valensia team.

Ruby also focused on the front field attack, emphasizing the speed of the counterattack. He also put forward specific requirements for the front field players, which was that once Xia ruofei was on the field, the front field players should try to cooperate and break through as much as possible. In the thirty – meter zone, they should deliberately create some fouls from the other side to win free kicks.

Generally, in that area, the threat of free kicks was not particularly big, so the opposing players would not pay much attention to their movements under normal circumstances. Once they could not get the ball, the possibility of a foul was still very high.
