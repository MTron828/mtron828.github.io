Chapter 342: Using both hard and soft tactics (2)

“Senior Xia Cheng, if it wasn’t for Xia ruofei’s help, we wouldn’t even have been able to bring out the flowers for the exhibition!” Lu You said calmly,”even if this jade lion isn’t sick, if we bring it to the exhibition and if the Agriculture and Forestry University really finds the best yang Lotus, we will still lose.” “Since there can’t be a worse outcome, why don’t you let Xia ruofei try?” Lu You continued after a pause. Xia Cheng smiled bitterly.”You’re right.” Chen Song, who was watching from the side, could not help but sneer and said,”It seems that you’re really desperate. We’ll meet again at the exhibition in three days. I hope you can create another miracle!” The sarcasm in his words was very obvious. After Chen Song finished speaking, he ignored the unpleasant – looking students of the Sanshan University’s gardening club. He picked up his pot of Hui LAN and put it back in his car. Then, without saying a word, he drove away from Sanshan University. The other students of the garden art Club also did not speak. The joy just now had been diluted by the news released by Chen Song. However, this matter definitely had to be decided by Lu You. Since she had already decided, these students naturally could not say anything. Even Peng Hui and you Jun did not make any more noise because Lu You was right. Xia ruofei had already completed his mission by curing this jade lion. No matter what the result was three days later, no one would be able to find fault with him. Xia Cheng thought for a moment.”Mr. Xia, I’ll leave it to you then. No matter if we can win against the University or not, I’m still very grateful to you!” “Don’t worry! If I say you can win, then you will definitely win!” Xia ruofei said confidently. Xia Cheng smiled bitterly and nodded. He then said to Lu You,””Lu You, let’s give this jade lion to Mr. Xia! Let’s all try to look around these few days and see if we can find better flowers to be exhibited!” Xia Cheng had no confidence in Xia ruofei at all. Of course, he could not be blamed for this. In his eyes, this was an impossible mission. Lu You nodded and did not say anything else. Qianqian had already chosen to trust Xia ruofei unconditionally, so she would not make any other preparations. However, as the president of the landscaper club, it was understandable for Xia Cheng to do his best to make a second preparation for the sake of the club. After Xia Cheng finished speaking, he left with the other students from the Garden Club. Xia ruofei carried the pot of jade lion and put it back into the pickup truck with a relaxed expression. Then, he waved goodbye to Lu You and Jiang Yue and drove away. Lu You and Jiang Yue stood in front of the old teaching building. Jiang Yue looked at the pickup truck that was gradually moving away and asked,””Youyou, do you think brother Xia can do it?” “Didn’t everyone suspect him three days ago? But you saw the result. ” Lu You said very calmly,”I believe that he will not let us down this time. He has always been a person who is good at creating miracles.” That was indeed the case. Just Lu You’s experience alone was enough to count the number of miracles that Xia ruofei had created. Lu You had also heard about the incident where Xia ruofei had urgently treated elder song from Tian Huilan. Xia ruofei had done things that ordinary people thought were impossible time and time again. This made Lu You very confident in Xia ruofei. Even Jiang Yue could feel this. She glanced at Lu You with a strange expression and said with a smile,””Youyou, I realized that you have blind faith in brother Xia! Don’t tell me ...” Lu You’s face reddened, but she quickly regained her composure. She rolled her eyes at Jiang Yue and said,”Wretched girl! Do you think that everyone is as infatuated as you and treats Xia ruofei like a treasure?” “I didn’t ...” Jiang Yue’s face was red as she punched Lu You with her pink fist. Not to be outdone, Lu You also reached out to scratch Jiang Yue’s armpit. The two beautiful women played around in front of the teaching building for a while until someone passed by. The two of them stopped, blushing. After a round of banter, the two of them tacitly did not mention Xia ruofei again. They went back to the dormitory intimately, hand in hand. …… After Xia ruofei drove away from the campus of Sanshan University, he kept the Jade lion pot into his original space with a thought. His idea was very simple and crude. He would place the pot of orchid in the original space where the spiritual energy was rich, and then water it with the petal solution every day. In three days ‘time, this pot of orchid could stay in the unique environment of the spirit map space for three months. Furthermore, it was nourished by the petal solution. It would be difficult for it not to be reborn. If he couldn’t win against the Yang family’s Lotus from Agriculture and Forestry University, then there was nothing else to say. Xia ruofei didn’t return to Peach Blossom Farm immediately. He had been driving the pickup truck towards the Ling Ji F & B headquarters, and Ling Qingxue hadn’t contacted him for the past three days. However, he thought that it had been three days, and Ling Qingxue’s anger should have subsided by now. For such matters, a man should naturally take the initiative. Besides, Xia ruofei had found a valid reason. The last time Ling Qingxue had gone to him, she had looked for him to sign the winery contract. However, because of Lu You and Jiang Yue’s sudden visit, Ling Qingxue had left immediately, and the contract had not been signed. Hence, Xia ruofei went there in the name of signing a contract. He gave Ling Qingxue a call on the way. “Miracle doctor Xia, what’s the matter?” Ling Qingxue’s teasing voice came from the phone.
