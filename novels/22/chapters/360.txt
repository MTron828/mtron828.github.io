Chapter 361: Light at the end of the tunnel (2)

After Chen dongbai announced the bronze prize, he paused for a moment, then changed to another piece of paper and continued,”Next, I’ll be announcing the flowers that have won the silver medal.”

The teachers and students in the audience immediately perked up their ears, afraid of missing out on important information.

Vice – Principal li, who was sitting beside Chen dongbai, was also a little nervous. He wanted to sneak a peek at the award results on the paper, but he had to maintain his dignity as a leader in front of so many people. So, he only had a slightly stiff smile on his face as he sat upright.

“The winning works for the Silver Award are ...” Chen dongbai paused for a moment, then said,”a water fairy from Dongnan Normal University, a lilac from Dongnan Police Academy, and ... A lilac from Dongnan Agriculture and Forestry University ...”

When Chen dongbai said this, he paused slightly. The eyes of the students of the Sanshan University gardening club below the stage couldn’t help but light up as they shouted in their hearts: “Suhe of the Yang family, suhe of the Yang family ...”

If yang suhe from Agriculture and Forestry University won the Silver Award, then their jade lion Mo Lan was very likely to win the Gold Award!

However, Chen dongbai clearly didn’t hear the inner thoughts of the students from Sanshan University’s gardening club. He smiled and continued,””Melon chrysanthemums!”

AI!

Yay!

The sighs at the front were from the students of Sanshan University’s gardening club, and the louder cheers came from the Agriculture and Forestry University.

Two of the pots of flowers that they had sent to the exhibition had been shortlisted for the final round, and the relatively weaker sunflower had actually won a Silver Award. That meant that the pot of yang suhe should have definitely won the Gold Award!

As the host, winning both the gold and silver Awards at the same time, this was really an honor!

Chen Song was the loudest on the side of Agricultural University. He even exaggeratedly made a fist – waving gesture, and then looked at the side of Sanshan University with a threatening expression.

The students of Sanshan University, on the other hand, were a little disappointed. They did not think that the pot of yang Lotus would not even win the bronze prize. Since there was no announcement now, the pot of yang Lotus was most likely the one who won the gold Prize.

He had really lost completely this time ...

However, the Jade lion Mo Lan from his side should not be unable to even get a bronze prize ... Could it be that the teachers of their school were not part of the judging panel, so they were treated unfairly?

Professor Tian had only arrived later, and he had not been involved in this work in the beginning. He might not even know that the Jade lion Mo Lan was selected and sent by Sanshan University.

The smile on vice – Principal Li’s face finally became more confident and affable.

Professor Tian, on the other hand, had a calm smile on his face. No one could tell anything from his expression.

Jiang Yue’s eyes were already teary. Xia ruofei, who was standing beside her, saw this and comforted her softly,””Jiang Yue, don’t be so anxious. The award hasn’t been announced yet, right?”

“But ... Yang suhe from Agricultural University ...” Jiang Yue said in a depressed mood. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Her eyes were a little red. Everyone had put in so much effort for this flower exhibition, and Xia ruofei had miraculously saved the mo Lan from the brink of death twice. Then, he spent three days to help the mo Lan undergo a complete transformation.

She felt that Xia ruofei must have put in a lot of effort in the process. It would be too unfair if they did not gain anything from the exhibition and lost the bet with Chen Song.

“As long as there’s no final announcement, anything is possible!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yes ...” Jiang Yue nodded slightly. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she calmed down a little.

Xia ruofei squinted his eyes and looked at the stage. He also felt that the results of today’s announcement were a little strange. If yang suhe really won the Gold Award in the end, and jade lion Mo Lan didn’t even get the Bronze Award, this result would probably be questioned by everyone!

After all, in the next two days, these flowers would all be on display, and the public’s eyes would be sharp!

Unless the judges were blind, how could such a result appear?

At this moment, professor Tian, who was on the platform, glanced at Xia ruofei. When their eyes met, Xia ruofei felt a smile in professor Tian’s eyes and immediately felt more at ease.

After a small commotion and celebration, the venue quickly quieted down.

Everyone knew that the biggest award of this year’s flower exhibition, the Yingying gold medal, was to be revealed.

Whoever won the gold medal would undoubtedly be the biggest winner of this exhibition.

Chen dongbai, who was on the stage, seemed to be deliberately keeping people in suspense. He put down the paper in his hand unhurriedly, then slowly picked up the last piece of red paper and slowly unfolded it.

Everyone held their breath.

“Next, I’m very honored to announce that the gold medal winner of this year’s Southeast province flower exhibition is ...” Chen dongbai said with a smile.

Chen dongbai looked around and saw the nervous faces below the stage. He seemed to be very satisfied with the effect of keeping people in suspense. He smiled and continued,”The orchid yang Lotus chosen by Dongnan Agriculture and Forestry University ...”

Chen Song had been holding his breath the entire time, his eyes fixed on Chen dongbai’s mouth on the stage. When the words “yang suhe” came out of Chen dongbai’s mouth, Chen Dong jumped up from his seat, clenched his fists, and cheered loudly. His face was flushed red, and the excitement in his heart was beyond words. Even the president of the gardening club, Meng Zhou, who was beside him, didn’t show such excitement.
