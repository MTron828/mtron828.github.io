Chapter 792: Good things come one after another (2)

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sneer as he shook his head and said,””Truly ignorant and fearless! He dared to accept any kind of money! It’s like lighting up a lantern in the toilet and looking for death!”

“Who said it wasn ‘t!” “Ruofei!” Niu Tao said. I personally coordinated the military intelligence Department and the provincial Safety Department to handle this case together. I’ll keep you updated on the progress of Xue Zhengbang’s investigation at any time. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no need, no need. Since you’ve already set your eyes on him, there’s no point in me investigating him.” By the way, you haven’t taken any measures against him?”

“Not yet. We haven’t completely ruled out the possibility of Xue Zhengbang colluding with hostile forces and colluding with foreign countries.” Niu Tao said,”there are also other bribery clues that are being dug up. We are worried that we will alert the enemy, so we have not touched him yet.”

“Then we have to keep a close eye on him!” Xia ruofei said,”the corrupt officials these days all have dog noses! They will immediately escape abroad if there is anything wrong. ”

“Don’t worry about that!” Niu Tao smiled and said,”Xue Zhengbang is not an ordinary corrupt official. This involves national security. Both the military and the ground have sent experts to monitor him 24/7! He can’t run away!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”This guy’s rank isn’t too high, but he’s being treated well. He’s being watched by the military intelligence Department and the National Security Department at the same time. I’m afraid he’s unprecedented!”

“Hahaha!” Niu Tao said,”Oh right, ruofei, you’ve just promised me something. Don’t go back on your word!”

“Although you’ve tricked me, I, Xia ruofei, am a man of my words!” Xia ruofei pouted and said,”I’m not like some comrades who don’t behave like seniors at all. They’re just waiting for the opportunity to dig a hole for their Little Junior Brother to jump into ...”

Niu Tao laughed smugly.

Xia ruofei said,”Fire Wolf, since you’re already investigating, I won’t bother about this anymore. Just let me know what the final situation is.”

“Alright!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei felt that this matter was quite magical. It seemed to be God’s will.

......

However, Xue Zhengbang was probably finished. Even if he didn’t have any other problems, just his close relationship with the Wei nation’s Intelligence Agency and the fact that he had accepted bribes was enough for him to spend the rest of his life in prison.

Once Xue Zhengbang fell from power, the hopeless Xue Fei would naturally pose no threat.

Xia ruofei had been racking his brain over this matter all this while. Now, he could finally heave a sigh of relief.

He went to the bathroom to take a comfortable shower, changed into loose and comfortable home clothes, and fell into bed to sleep.

The next morning, after eating the breakfast that Hu Zi’s mother had prepared, Xia ruofei strolled to the company complex.

When Lei Hu went to pick Xia ruofei up yesterday, he naturally had to report to Feng Jing. Hence, Feng Jing already knew about Xia ruofei’s return to the three mountains.

Xia ruofei had just arrived at the office when Feng Jing walked in with a laptop.

“President Feng!” Xia ruofei took the initiative to stand up and greet them.”You’ve worked hard these few days when I wasn’t home!”

“I’m used to it!”Feng Rao pursed her lips.

Xia ruofei laughed in embarrassment and said,””Please sit, please sit! CEO Feng, how’s the company these few days?”

“Generally speaking, everything’s normal,” Feng Rao nodded and said,”but I have a few things to report to you.”

“Mm! Go ahead!” Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”Oh, what would you like to drink?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“No need, no need!” Feng Jing saw that Xia ruofei was about to get up and make her some tea. She quickly waved her hand and said,”Chairman, I’m not thirsty.”

Xia ruofei didn’t stand on ceremony with Feng Jing. He smiled and sat down again, looking at Feng Jing with a smile.

Feng Jing opened the notebook and said,”Chairman, the first thing is that Tongren Hall asked us when we can send them the next batch of iron – Skin maples. You’ve been following up on this matter, so I can’t give them a definite answer.”

Only then did Xia ruofei remember that it was time to harvest the iron – Skin Dendrobium again. However, he had been carrying out missions with lone wolf for the past few days, and it was inconvenient for him to live in a group environment. At the same time, he did not have the time to check the spirit map space.

“Tell them that our new Ironhide Kaede bucket will be ready in a week at most!” Xia ruofei asked,”by the way, are all the employees in our company who produce the iron – skinned Kaede bucket still here?”

“Yes,” Feng Rao nodded. Because the time they take to make the Ironhide maples is relatively concentrated, they are all in stages, so I usually let them return to the security team or vegetable greenhouse where they originally worked, and then gather to make the maples when needed. ”

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement.”That’s good. It’s good for Personnel Management.” Is there anything else?”

Feng Rao looked at her notebook and said,””Old Cao is quite anxious. The new vegetable greenhouse has been handed over for use, but the vegetable seeds have not arrived yet. He has come to me several times, but you have not been home these few days, so I can’t do anything about the seeds. I can only ask him to wait patiently.”

Xia ruofei patted his head and said,”look at this ... I forgot about it when I was busy.” Go and tell Cao tieshu to calculate the amount of seeds needed. I will solve the problem of seeds for him tomorrow!”

Feng Rao quickly jotted down a few words in her notebook and nodded.”Alright!”
