2352 The spirit of the Chinese (1)

Chapter 1299: the first Prince!

“Mister, how should I address you?” asked the black guy, Daka.

“My name is Xia Tian,” Xia ruofei replied with a smile.

Xia Tian’s identity was just a cover, and it was recorded in the immigration records. Besides, Xia ruofei had also changed her appearance, so there was no need to keep it a secret.

Darka raised his eyebrows and asked with a smile,””Xia as in summer, and Tian as in summer?”

“Correct!” Xia ruofei was slightly stunned.

To be honest, Xia ruofei felt a sense of closeness when he saw a black man speaking Chinese in the distant African continent. It had nothing to do with national pride or inferiority.

The waiting time was a little boring, so Xia ruofei chatted with him for a while.

Through their exchange, Xia ruofei found out that this black man named Dhaka was also heading to arulei. He worked at a Chinese – funded agency in arulei and was mainly in the job of translation and guide.

Although Dhaka was not from arulei, he had lived in arulei for a few years when he was young. He knew the local language and was also proficient in English. His Chinese was considered good among the foreigners, so the job of translation was actually quite suitable for him.

Xia ruofei was curious.”Dhaka? from what I know, arulei doesn’t have a close relationship with China. How come there are Chinese enterprises there?”

Before Xia ruofei set off, he did some research on arulei. Of course, he only did some general research and did not go too deep. After all, he was here to destroy the modr mercenary group in one fell swoop, so he did not need to think too much.

Hence, Xia ruofei only knew that arulei did not have a good relationship with Huaxia.

Of course, the wording was more tactful because he had spent his childhood in arulei.

In fact, arulei was a gangster country. When it needed help, it would be very obedient, but after getting the benefits, it would talk big. It had even broken off relations with China before, and it had only been restored in recent years.

“Xia Tian,” said Daka with a smile,”which place in the world doesn’t have Chinese enterprises and Chinese people? Especially in the African continent, as long as there are people, there are Chinese companies! I’m doing business! Earning money is the most important thing. ”

Xia ruofei was stunned and said,”‘our’ Chinese company?”

Daka grinned, revealing his white teeth. He then scratched his head and said in embarrassment,””When I was studying in China, I fell deeply in love with this magical ancient Eastern country, so ... I’m considered a spiritual Chinese!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh out loud. On the internet, there were a lot of people who were refined, refined, and even spirited. This was the first time he had heard of this saying,”spirited Chinese.” However, it sounded pretty cool, even though it was said by a poor African brother. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Daka continued,”arulei is a very backward country. It’s one of the least developed countries in the world. The per capita income there is only 300 to 400 HxB. I work in a Chinese company, so my income is at least 20 to 30 times that of the locals. So, I love China!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re honest!”

After the two chatted for a while, the announcement announced that they could board the plane, so they stood up, picked up their luggage, and went to line up at the gate.

Because Aruray and Ethiopia were neighbors and the flight distance was not too far, all the planes flying from Ethiopia to Aruray were arej’s side planes. They looked very old and were at least more than a decade old.

Such planes did not have first – Class seats and were all Economy Class.

Hence, Xia ruofei had also bought an economy class ticket.

However, the entire voyage was only two to three hours long, and it would be over in no time.

There were quite a lot of passengers on this flight route, and there was a long line at the gate. Xia ruofei stood out among the black men.

He chatted with Daka as he followed the team.

After boarding the plane, Xia ruofei quickly found his seat in the middle of the cabin near the wing with the help of the flight attendant.

It was only then that he and Daka realized that the two of them were actually sitting in the same row, but there was a walkway in between them.

Daka immediately discussed with Brother Black, who was beside Xia ruofei. Brother Black very readily exchanged seats with Daka.

Daka carried his bag and sat down beside Xia ruofei. He grinned and said,””Hey! Brother, this is fate!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded, thinking that with the company of this cheerful Brother Black, the journey would not be boring.

The two of them put on their seat belts and chatted as they waited for the plane to take off.

When the surrounding passengers saw that Dhaka was able to chat so happily with a Chinese person in Chinese, they all cast envious gazes at him. Now, the whole world knew that Chinese people were getting richer and richer, especially in places like Africa. Chinese people were like gods of fortune ... No, the Black Brothers did not know about gods of fortune. They were just like ... Like The Walking US dollars.

Soon, the plane received permission to take off. It taxied to the runway and began to accelerate.
