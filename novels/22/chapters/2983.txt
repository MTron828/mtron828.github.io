2984 Chapter 1631 – willing to bet, willing to lose (2)

“Young sect master!” Luo Feng immediately replied. Don’t lose your mind. If you lose the spiritual stones and can’t get the treasure, sect leader Wu will only reprimand you a few times when you return. If you ruin the reputation of the spirit Vulture mountain, it won’t be as simple as a reprimand ...”

Wu Ming finally heard her. He raised his head and looked at the impatient Liu Mansha and the smiling Xia ruofei. He said in a ridiculing tone,””It’s just a suggestion ... Since no one agrees, then let’s drop the matter. Valley master Liu, please continue ...”

Liu Mansha snorted and elegantly flipped to a new page.

Luo Feng was like a cat that had caught the scent of fish, and he hurriedly turned his gaze to the newly opened book.

However, Liu Mansha’s movements were very fast. She immediately used a paperweight to cover the area next to her where there were insights on cultivation. She also quickly read through it once. After confirming that there were no additional contents in the star Seizer sect’s handwritten copy because of the missing page, she then slowly began to check each word and sentence.

It was very quiet in the private room. Luo Qingfeng, who was supposed to be one of the leaders, was completely invisible. Liu Mansha and Luo Feng were reading the manuscript seriously. Yang Liu was looking around in boredom. As for Wu Ming, he stood in the corner with his face alternating between red and white. No one knew what he was thinking.

There wasn’t much content in the manuscript. In a short while, Liu Mansha had checked everything from beginning to end.

She closed the two handwritten copies and handed the star Seizer sect’s obviously better – looking manuscript to Luo Feng. Then, a playful smile appeared on her face as she asked,”Elder Luo, you’ve also checked it just now. I think there should be no objection to the conclusion, right?”

Luo Feng forced a smile and nodded,”No objections. The young sect master just spoke without thinking. Our lingjue mountain is not going to deny our loss. We’ve lost this bet ...”

Liu Mansha nodded and turned to look at Xia ruofei. She smiled and said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, congratulations!”

Xia ruofei replied nonchalantly,”what joy is there? this is a bet that shouldn’t have happened. I don’t think the cultivation techniques that were auctioned earlier had such a check.”

Liu Mansha thought to herself,”this little fox, she’s taking advantage of me!”

She smiled and said,”at least you don’t have to pay a compensation of over 700000 spiritual stones, and the star Seizer sect doesn’t have to go bankrupt!” And ... There’s also a 50000 spirit stone income. Isn’t that worth congratulating?”

“Haha!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Valley master Liu is right. I can’t even refute him!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei took out another handwritten copy from the spirit map space. This handwritten copy had the same style as the one on the coffee table, but the small words on the cover had changed to “Volume One.”

Xia ruofei passed the handwritten copy to Liu Mansha and said,””This is the content of the first scroll. When the two scrolls are combined, both Qi condensation and Aurous core cultivators can cultivate it.”

Seeing this, Luo Feng’s eyes were fixed on the handwritten book in Liu Mansha’s hands. He almost couldn’t help but release his spiritual power to spy on it. Fortunately, his rationality won over his impulse in the end.

Luo Feng looked longingly at the two handwritten copies and took out a big bag of spirit stones from his storage treasure. He scanned it with his spiritual force and took a portion of it to store in his storage treasure. Then, he handed the bag to Xia ruofei and said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, here are 50000 spirit stones. The spirit Vulture mountain is willing to accept our loss! This manuscript will also be removed from the auction!”

Xia ruofei took it without hesitation and scanned it with his spiritual power. He found exactly 50000 spiritual stones. He nodded and kept the spiritual stones. He smiled and said,””Then it would be impolite for us to refuse!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Luo Feng’s expression naturally didn’t look too good. He shot a look at Wu Ming, whose eyes were burning with anger, and then said, “We’ll take our leave first!”

After saying that, the two of them left the private room without looking back. They didn’t even pay attention to Shao Qingyang’s greeting. It was obvious that the people of the Spirit Vulture mountain also hated the fallen leaves sect.

But Shao Qingyang didn’t care about this at all. He laughed as he walked into the boundary of the barrier and said,””It seems that there is no problem with the cultivation technique! Congratulations to fellow Daoist Xia and valley leader Liu for finally finding an excellent psyche cultivation technique. I’m sure it’ll only be a matter of time before you break through to the late – Aurous core stage!”

Liu Mansha’s shortcoming in the aspect of mental power was basically known to all the prominent figures in the cultivation world. It was no secret.

Liu Mansha was also in a good mood. She said with a smile,”Then I’ll be counting on sect leader Shao’s auspicious words!”

Then, Liu Mansha took out more than 70000 spiritual stones from her storage ring and completed the transaction of the two handwritten copies.

Shao Qingyang had already promised that he would not take a cut of this transaction, so Xia ruofei naturally kept these spiritual stones without any hesitation.

Liu Mansha said to Xia ruofei,”thank you, fellow Daoist Xia. If there’s a chance, we can communicate again. Oh, that’s right. If you still want to sell the Qi gathering pills, please consider our soaring Flower Valley First. We can discuss the price!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””No problem. We’ll probably continue to sell Qi gathering pills in the future, and in greater quantities. We’ll give Valley master Liu a discount then!”

“Then I’ll have to thank fellow Daoist Xia in advance!” Liu Mansha said with a smile.

After saying that, Liu Mansha beckoned to Yang Liu and also left room 20.

After the people of the Spirit Vulture mountain and the flying flower Valley had left, Shao Qingyang couldn’t hold it in any longer. He rubbed his hands and smiled at Xia ruofei,””Fellow Daoist Xia, this matter has finally come to a satisfactory conclusion. Do you think ...”

Xia ruofei naturally knew what Shao Qingyang was concerned about. He smiled and said,””Sect leader Shao, please come here in fifteen minutes. I will lend you the first volume of the glittering jewel Wonderland for two hours, but you can only read it in this room and can not take it away. I also hope that you will keep your promise and not secretly teach it to cultivators outside of the falling leaves sect.”

“No problem! No problem!” Shao Qingyang was overjoyed. He quickly said,”fellow Daoist Xia, I’ll take my leave first!”

Shao Qingyang naturally knew that Xia ruofei wanted to copy the contents of the first volume again at the last minute, so he quickly took his leave and left the room. He naturally wanted to see the cultivation technique as soon as possible.

After Shao Qingyang left, Luo Qingfeng immediately went to lock the door of the private room. At the same time, Xia ruofei set up the protective barrier.

Then, he took out a piece of paper, a gel pen, a stapler, and other things from the space, and wrote on the table.

The complete content of the “the glittering jewel Wonderland” was in his mind, so he naturally did not need to go through any thoughts or memories. It could be said that the speed at which he wrote was the speed at which the handwritten copy was made.

The first volume did not have much content either, and there were no complicated illustrations. Hence, Xia ruofei was naturally able to copy it very quickly.

He could even pay attention to the auction.

The auction had already resumed. Although Hao Qingsong didn’t announce the final result of the bet between the spirit Vulture mountain and the star Seizer sect, the handwritten copy of the spirit Vulture mountain had already quietly withdrawn from the auction. The usually haughty Wu Ming had also stopped making a fuss. Everyone was naturally aware of the final result.

At this time, a piece of refining material was being auctioned. There were not many cultivators competing for it. After all, there were not many cultivators who studied refining in this era. But even so, the few cultivators who were involved in artifact refining were obviously not short of money. These people had their eyes on this material, so the competition was naturally very fierce.

Xia ruofei was not interested in this piece of material. He quickly copied the contents of the first volume of the “glittering jewel Wonderland” while paying attention to the auction.

Luo Qingfeng was full of questions, but seeing that Xia ruofei was so busy, he did not dare to disturb him. He just sat quietly at the side and occasionally served him tea.

Just as Xia ruofei had finished writing the contents of the first volume of the “the glittering jewel Wonderland” as fast as he could, a new item appeared on the main auction stage. It was the pair of storage rings that Xia ruofei had been waiting for a long time.
