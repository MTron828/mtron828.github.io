A rich man like Tang Yitian naturally had his own private yacht, and it had an excellent parking spot in the yacht dock of Sydney port.

When the group of people arrived at the dock in the Bentley, a pure white Azimut peaks 100 grand Leonardo luxury yacht was already ready.

The 30 – meter – long Azimut yacht wasn’t considered a luxury for Tang Yitian. In fact, he also owned two other super yachts that were more than 100 meters long. However, these yachts happened to be docked in Sydney, and they were enough for a small group of maritime parties.

A blonde beauty wearing a captain’s hat and a tight – fitting uniform that revealed her navel was waiting at the yacht dock. Her impressive figure made people couldn’t help but cast sidelong glances.

“Good evening, Mr. Tang!” The beautiful Captain said respectfully.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be surprised. He didn’t expect Tang Yitian’s yacht captain to be such a sexy beauty. But after thinking about it, he felt relieved.

The yacht was a very private place. Rich people went to the sea to experience the feeling of freedom. In most cases, they would definitely bring their female companions.

And on the boundless sea, how could one not change into a swimsuit to enjoy the blue sea water and sunlight?

In this case, if a man with an unkempt beard was driving the yacht while his woman was lying on the deck in bikinis, rich men would definitely feel uncomfortable ...

If it was a female Captain, there would be no such concerns, and she was quite pleasing to the eye.

“Ruofei, this is Captain Emily. She’s in charge of my Tyrannosaurus,” Tang Yitian said with a nod.

When Xia ruofei heard that this beautiful, streamlined yacht was called Tyrannosaurus, he could not help but laugh.

At this time, Tang Yitian was already introducing Emily,””Emily, this is Mr. Xia from China. He’s our most distinguished guest.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Emily’s expression slightly froze, and she quickly said,”Hello, Mr. Xia! I’m very honored to be able to provide you with my service!”

“Captain Emily, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“RUO Fei, Lin Qiao, let’s board the boat,” said Tang Yitian.

“Okay, okay!” Lin Qiao quickly replied. I can’t wait!”

Tang Yitian laughed and personally led the way. He brought Xia ruofei and the others onto the yacht.

There were also two tall and sexy blondes on the yacht. They were the crew of the Tyrannosaurus, and they mainly served the guests.

Although winter in Australia was not very cold, the sun had already set and the temperature was around ten degrees. Xia ruofei could not help but feel worried when he saw that the two of them were wearing so little.

However, the two beautiful women didn’t seem cold at all, especially after seeing their boss, Tang Yitian. They even stuck out their big breasts.

Xia ruofei was also a normal man. When he stepped onto the yacht, he happened to see this scene and couldn’t help but be a little dazed.

At this moment, he heard Lin Qiao whisper in his ear,””Brother ruofei, isn’t it nice?”

Xia ruofei subconsciously nodded and then said awkwardly,””What nonsense are you talking about? What’s there to look at? You’re so mischievous!”

Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue mischievously and said, “You’ve already revealed your true thoughts just now! Bribe me! Otherwise, I’m going to tell sister – in – Law when we get back!”

“Tsk ... You can tell on me however you want!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s see if Qingxue will believe you or me ...”

“I really don’t know what kind of magic potion you fed sister Qingxue ...” Lin Qiao said with a depressed look.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

After everyone got on the yacht, it soon left the dock slowly under Emily’s control and headed towards the sea.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer enthusiastically showed Xia ruofei and Annie around the yacht.

Although the yacht was not very big, its facilities were definitely the most luxurious. The design was even more original, and the use of space on the deck was extremely high.

The most unique feature was the large and variable – end stern deck, and there was a U – shaped bench that could be turned into a comfortable beach bed.

The stern of the ship could be completely opened, and the dining room at the stern could be integrated with the stern, forming a unique open – Air tea table.

There was a spacious resting area in the middle of the handrail at the bow of the ship, where guests could enjoy the sun and a sumptuous breakfast.

The yacht also had a unique, large sea view penthouse. There was a super large sofa and stylish furniture on the observation deck. Sitting on the Super large sofa on the observation deck, the sea breeze could be felt, and the 360 – degree sea view was unparalleled.

In addition to the special deck and rest area, the central area of the yacht also had a luxurious bedroom. In addition to the Super large master bedroom, there were three similarly luxuriously decorated guest bedrooms.

After a round of sightseeing, everyone finally returned to the observation deck on the top floor.

Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao couldn’t help but praise.

Xia ruofei had experienced Tang He’s grandfather’s private jet before. Today, he saw Tang Yitian’s private yacht, and it was only the smallest of his luxury yachts. He couldn’t help but sigh with emotion that the life of a rich man was indeed full of unimaginable enjoyment.

Tang Yitian waved his hand to stop the Blondie who came to serve them. He personally poured wine for Xia ruofei and the others. It was the same limited edition bounteous Grange that they had opened during dinner. This bottle of wine was six liters, so it was impossible to finish it in one meal. Thus, Tang Yitian brought it with him.
