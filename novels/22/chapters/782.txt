Chapter 783: Chapter 517 – Capture them all in one fell swoop (3)

The only fish that had escaped was the person in charge of the Wei nation Secret Service team, junhiko Inoue. When he saw that the situation was not good, he immediately moved to Liang Qiming’s side and held professor Liang hostage.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s team was advancing very fast. In just two or three minutes, they had killed all the Wei nation agents like a gust of wind sweeping away fallen leaves. So, Junyan Inoue only had time to find a safe position and use Liang Qiming as a human shield to confront the members of lone wolf.

While quickly thinking of countermeasures, Guo Zhan eased his tone and said, “Don’t be rash. As long as you guarantee professor Liang’s safety, we won’t shoot ...”

“Cut the crap! Immediately put down your weapons and leave the brick kiln!” Junyan Inoue said sternly,”if you want professor Liang to live, prepare a car for me now. I also need a boat. When I reach the International waters, I will naturally let professor Liang go!”

Even an ant would cherish his life, so Junyan Inoue would naturally not be so crazy as to seek death. Moreover, he hoped that the Chinese army would be cautious and that he could escape with professor Liang under his control.

If they could take Liang Qiming to the open sea in this case and take a ship back to the Wei nation, it would be a big contribution. After all, professor Liang was the host of the experiment, and even if the core data was missing, there was still a chance to repeat the experiment and obtain the data again.

Seeing that Guo Zhan and the others still had no intention of retreating, Inoue Junyan said in a more serious tone, “Don’t doubt my determination to die for His Majesty! I’ll count to ten now. If you still don’t put down your weapons and leave, I’ll shoot without hesitation! One! Two! Three ...”

Guo Zhan gritted his teeth tightly. He was extremely anxious, but he could do nothing about it. Moreover, when Inoue Junyan began to count, the invisible pressure became even greater.

Just as Guo Zhan was about to calm Junyan Inoue down and lead everyone out, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””You’re not being sincere! If you take professor Liang to international waters, how can he come back?”

“You can only choose to believe me,” Junyan Inoue said with a strange laugh,”and I’ll allow you to send a ship to follow me, as long as it doesn’t come within one nautical mile of me! When I’m safe, I’ll give professor Liang a life jacket and let him go into the sea to wait for your rescue!”

Xia ruofei immediately said,”it takes time to prepare the vehicles and ships. You can’t keep holding Madam Liang back like this, right?” He was already in his 70s, and he couldn’t bear such a punishment. I’m sure you don’t want anything to happen to professor Liang, do you?”

Guo Zhan’s heart moved. He could see that Xia ruofei was stalling for time. However, in the current situation, Inoue Junyan was in the blind spot. What was the point of stalling?

However, Guo Zhan knew that Xia ruofei would not do anything without a reason. He must have had a reason for doing so, so he just watched quietly from the side and did not interfere with Xia ruofei’s behavior.

Inoue Junyan naturally saw it too. He slightly released the hand on professor Liang’s neck and said coldly,””Don’t worry! As long as you guys cooperate, professor Liang will be fine! I know you’re trying to stall for time, but do you think it’s useful? Alright, the game is over. The countdown continues! Four, five, six ...”

Guo Zhan’s heart was burning with anxiety. He had no doubt that this Inoue Tomoya was determined to fight to the death. As the countdown approached, Guo Zhan’s heart began to waver.

Just as Guo Zhan was about to exercise his authority as the commander and order the team members to put down their guns and leave the brick kiln, a shocking scene happened!

A black shadow, as fast as lightning, swept in through the small ventilation window in front of Inoue Tomoya.

When Guo Zhan saw clearly that the black shadow was Blackie, who had been brought by Xia ruofei, Blackie had accurately bitten Junyan Inoue’s wrist, which was holding the gun. Then, it quickly swung its head due to the inertia of the pounce.

Junyan Inoue’s gun was thrown away in pain, and his body staggered, half of his head peeking out from behind professor Liang.

Pa!

The crisp sound of a gunshot rang out.

A small bullet hole appeared in junhiko Inoue’s head, and blood spattered on the wall of the cave behind him. It seemed to be mixed with some brain matter. The 9mm bullet entered Junyan Inoue’s forehead. The entrance was small, but the exit to the back of his head was large, almost blowing away the entire cervical vertebrae.

Inoue Junyan’s eyes lost their color in an instant. The astonishment in his eyes was forever fixed, and his whole body fell down powerlessly.

Xia ruofei was still in the shooting position. A wisp of smoke was slowly dissipating from the barrel of his Type 92 pistol.

Guo Zhan’s mouth was slightly agape. He was somewhat dumbfounded. He did not expect the last surprise soldier to be a mutt. Xia ruofei’s pistol was clearly in the holster. At that moment, Guo Zhan did not even see Xia ruofei’s movements clearly.

It was hard to imagine how Xia ruofei managed to pull out the gun, aim, and fire the entire set of movements in such a short time. Furthermore, it was under the situation where the opponent’s flaw was so small. If he had only moved two to three centimeters, the one who would have been shot in the head would not be Junyan Inoue but professor Liang Qiming.

Junyan Inoue was lying on the ground with his eyes wide open. He did die with regrets. The ventilation window was so small that no one could pass through it. He also occupied the blind spot of the shooting. The snipers outside could not lock on to the target. However, he never expected a dog to sneak in. This dog also became his Soul Reaper, causing him to be killed by Xia ruofei.

Dying like this was indeed a little too cowardly.

No matter what, this was finally over ...

The assault team members swarmed forward and quickly separated Liang Qiming and Junyan Inoue’s bodies. Two members helped professor Liang to the side and sat down.

Xia ruofei slowly put the gun back into the holster. He turned around and looked at the small sky through the entrance of the brick kiln, saying silently in his heart,””Class monitor Luo, you can rest in peace now. We’ve already caught all of these Japanese in one fell swoop. Not a single one was left alive ...”
