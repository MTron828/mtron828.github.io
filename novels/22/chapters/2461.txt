2462 A gathering of guests (1)

The membership card was sold at a low price, but it wasn’t because no one was interested in Paradise Club.

On the contrary, when the Paradise society had just started its construction, many people had already rushed to it. However, it was definitely impossible to give out a diamond card so easily. The number of people had to be controlled.

Otherwise, not to mention 30, even 300 would be sold out.

There was no shortage of rich people now.

Zhao Yongjun continued,”we’ve released 80 Platinum cards with 500000 membership fees and 120 gold cards with 300000 membership fees. They’re all sold out.”

There were three levels of membership cards: diamond, Platinum, and gold.

In other words, the total number of members of the Paradise Club was less than 200, because many of the diamond cards were held by their internal shareholders.

Song Rui said proudly,”there are many people who want to buy a membership!” They’re even willing to pay more, and it’s purely membership fees, and there’s no need to transfer the membership fees to the balance in the card. However, we’ve discussed it, and since we’ve decided on this amount for the first batch, the rules have to be set up. We can’t change orders overnight, so they’ve all been sent back!”

“It seems like our paradise gathering has become popular!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

Zhao Yongjun said calmly,”the capital is a political center, and the business is very developed. There are many rich people, and with the people in our circle, the market is still very big.” This time, there were a total of 200 membership cards for the three grades, which was definitely far from enough. It could be said that if the supply was opened, even if it was ten times more, it could be sold out cleanly. But we can’t do that. ”

“Yup! We can’t do something like drying up the pond to fish!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we can recruit more members in the future. However, we have to gradually expand our club and improve the facilities. In short, we can’t let the members “spending experience decline. If we turn a high – end club into a vegetable market, we’ll become the joke of the circle!”

“Don’t worry! We all know what we’re doing!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

The group of them chatted and laughed, and soon they arrived at the entrance of the club.

At this time, some guests had started to arrive one after another, and some people greeted Zhao Yongjun from far away.

Zhao Yongjun was very popular in the industry. He was forthright and loyal, so everyone gave him face.

“Brother Zhao! Congratulations! I wish you good luck!”

“Thank you, brother Zhou, for coming!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

The person who came to greet Zhao Yongjun was in his early forties. He was slightly chubby, but his face was full of energy. He had a warm smile on his face, giving off a feeling of being bathed in the spring breeze.

“Brother Zhou, let me introduce you.” Zhao Yongjun said,”this is my good brother, Xia ruofei. He’s also one of the main investors of the Paradise society!”

Then, Zhao Yongjun smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, this is my good friend. He’s the chairman of glory world Corporation, Chairman Zhou leiyun!”

From the introduction, one could tell how close they were. Zhao Yongjun was obviously close to Chairman Zhou, or he wouldn’t have introduced him to Xia ruofei. However, one was a ‘good friend’ while the other was a ‘good brother’. There was obviously a difference between close and distant.

After Zhou leiyun heard Zhao Yongjun’s introduction, his eyes brightened. He came forward and said enthusiastically,””You must be CEO Xia from paradise Corporation, right? Aiya! I’ve always seen you on the internet. I didn’t expect to see you in person today!”

Zhou leiyun was like a fan of a celebrity. In fact, Xia ruofei had heard of glory world Corporation before. Among the private enterprises in the country, glory world Corporation was at least in the top ten. Zhou leiyun was definitely considered a super – rich person in reality. How could an ordinary celebrity allow Zhou leiyun to deliberately befriend them? Thus, Zhou leiyun was only making his stance clear.

Of course, the fact that Zhou leiyun could think of such a way to get close to Xia ruofei in such a short time also showed that Xia ruofei’s popularity was indeed very high.

“Chairman Zhou! ‘Nice to meet you!’ Nice to meet you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Since Zhou leiyun could call Zhao Yongjun “brother Zhao”, it was clear that the two of them had a good personal relationship. Hence, Xia ruofei would not reject him.

Zhou leiyun took out a name card from the inner pocket of his suit and handed it to Xia ruofei. He smiled and said,””President Xia, this is my business card. We can keep in touch in the future!”

Paradise Corporation was thriving. As the chairman of the company, Xia ruofei was not like before, where he didn’t even have a name card. After Qin Yanan took over Xia ruofei’s security team, he personally made two sets of business cards for Xia ruofei. One of them was for socializing purposes, and the other was for people who were closer to him. The only difference was that Xia ruofei’s personal phone number was on the latter set.

After Xia ruofei received the name card, he stored it in the spirit map space.

He first took Zhou leiyun’s name card, then reached into his pocket. In reality, he took out a name card with his private number from the space and held it in his hand before reaching out.

“Chairman Zhou, we can have tea together when you have time!” Xia ruofei smiled as he passed his name card to Zhou leiyun.

“I will! I will!” Zhou leiyun took the business card and said happily,”peach blossom Da Hong Pao is famous far and wide now. If there’s a chance, I’d like to try CEO Xia’s personal collection of Da Hong Pao!”

“Hahaha! No problem!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After some small talk, Zhou leiyun went to the main banquet hall while Xia ruofei continued to wait at the door, accompanying Zhao Yongjun and the rest to welcome the guests.

After a while, Xia ruofei started to feel bored.

It wasn’t that he wasn’t good at socializing, but he wasn’t too used to this kind of reception. Furthermore, the people who came today were either rich or powerful, and many of them were famous people in the circle of rich Playboys in the capital. Other than being familiar with Zhao Yongjun and his small circle, Xia ruofei didn’t really have much interaction with the people in the circle of rich Playboys, so he naturally felt a little bored.

“Big brother Zhao, you guys go ahead with your work!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going in to relax ...”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun said,”take CEO Ling, Weiwei, and the others around! If you’re tired, you can go to the banquet hall and rest for a while!”

“Yiyi, go over first!” Song Rui said,”the sun is a little strong today. Don’t get tanned ...”

Xia ruofei muttered,”this guy only has the opposite sex but no humanity!”

Zhuo Yiyi was already bored out of her mind, so she immediately replied,””Alright! Alright! I’ll go with handsome Xia!”

Xia ruofei felt song Rui’s resentful eyes and smiled bitterly. Can’t you just say that you’re with Weiwei?

Zhuo Yiyi had always spoken in a carefree manner, so how could she think so much? she impatiently said,””Handsome Xia! Wei Wei! Sister Qingxue, let’s go! This place is so boring ...” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Hence, Xia ruofei brought the three beauties and swaggered around the Paradise gathering, attracting the attention of many guests.

Since they had already visited the place, they didn’t stay outside for too long. After the three women took a few selfies by the lake, they followed Xia ruofei into the main building of the Paradise society.

The first half of the first floor was a tall Hall similar to a hotel lobby, while the second half was a banquet hall. There were a total of three restaurants, one big and two small. Other than the main banquet hall, there were also Ling’s private kitchen and a Western restaurant.

When there was a need, the guest dining area could be opened up to form a large banquet hall.

All three restaurants had been opened up today, but the kitchen was still relatively independent.

This side of the restaurant faced the lake, and the side of the first floor facing the lake was a large glass wall, so the view was very wide. From most parts of the banquet hall, one could enjoy the beautiful lake view.

As soon as Xia ruofei and the others entered the banquet hall, a manager immediately came over and bowed slightly.””Hello, President Xia! Would you guys like anything to drink?”

As the major shareholder of the Paradise Association, Xia ruofei had never shown his face in the basic construction and employee training. However, Xia ruofei had just brought them to visit the place, and it was a must for the foreman to remember the names of the guests quickly in a short time. Moreover, this VIP was the major shareholder of the Paradise Association. As their real boss, the foreman would naturally have a good eye for this.

“Ladies First!” Xia ruofei asked in a very gentlemanly manner,”beautiful ladies, what would you like to drink?”

“I’ll have some red wine!” Song Wei said after thinking for a while.

“I also want one! I also want one!” Zhuo Yiyi said.

Ling Qingxue saw that the two of them had ordered red wine, so she smiled and said,””Then give me a glass of red wine too!”

“I’ll have a blue Martell!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright, please wait a moment!” The head waiter said.

The head waiter went to pour the wine while Xia ruofei and the others looked around the banquet hall. They were just here to look around, but now they had more time to take a good look.

Today was the first day of the Paradise Club’s operation, and the purpose of the Paradise Club was to create more opportunities for people in need to communicate, so Zhao Yong Jun and the others chose to have a cold dinner party.

There weren’t many people in the banquet hall at the moment, so it seemed a little empty.

The hall was not filled with round tables like the Chinese banquet. Other than the long tables filled with various drinks, drinks, and cakes, the rest of the hall was very empty.

There were also many sofa seats around the banquet hall. If there was a need for further communication or people who wanted to find a place to sit down and rest, they could have their own semi – private space.

Xia ruofei and the others had walked quite a bit today, so they found a sofa and sat down. The four of them, one man and three women, just happened to fill the four seats opposite each other.

Soon, the head waiter personally carried a tray and brought over the red wine that Xia ruofei and the others had ordered.

Xia ruofei and the others sipped on the wine and chatted. The atmosphere was very relaxed.

At this moment, two young men walked in from the entrance of the banquet hall. They both had a trace of arrogance on their faces. This was a temperament that had been formed after being influenced by what they saw and heard for a long time.

They looked around and immediately noticed Xia ruofei.

One of the young men raised his eyebrows and said,””Eh? Isn’t that the song family’s Wei Wei? When did she return to the capital?”
