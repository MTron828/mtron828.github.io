2645 Everyone’s heart is different (1)

Although the plane was landing at night, there was still a row of people standing by the airport’s parking lot to welcome them.

Liu Qingfeng had been waiting in the cold wind for more than half an hour with the management of the Qingyun Island project, which also included the agate local, benilati.

At first, they were waiting at the control center on the ground. When the A350 that Xia ruofei and the others were on entered the command range of the control center and carried out the approach procedures, Liu Qingfeng led everyone directly to the tarmac.

The exact news from the country had already been sent over. Everyone already knew that blue cloud Island was going to change hands.

Therefore, the mood of Liu Qingfeng and the others was very complicated at this time.

Originally, the construction project of the blue cloud Island still had a later stage plan that had not been completed. Now, those plans were naturally invalid, and most of the people in the team led by Liu Qingfeng were from the Liu family. Even if they were not the children of the family, they were still serving the Liu family group. They were now a little hesitant.

Originally, the construction of green cloud Island would not have ended so quickly. Even if the construction was completed, someone would need to stay to maintain the normal operation of the entire Island. Now that the master had changed, these people would definitely be transferred back to the country.

They had basically been working on the green cloud Island project all these years. After returning to the Liu family’s family group, it could be said that their future was uncertain.

Therefore, it was impossible to say that Liu Qingfeng and the others did not have any complaints about Xia ruofei.

However, this kind of complaint could only be hidden in the heart. When Xia ruofei was the first to step down the ramp, Liu Qingfeng and the others all showed a warm smile and quickly greeted him.

“Mr. Xia, welcome, welcome!” Liu Qingfeng held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly and shook it a few times, as if he and Xia ruofei were old friends who had reunited after a long time. In fact, they had just met a few days ago.

Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face as he shook hands with Liu Qingfeng and the others one by one, including bainilatti.

If the enthusiasm of Liu Qingfeng and the others was forced to pretend, then benilatti was definitely from the heart.

Benilatti was a local of carnade. Although he had been serving the Liu family’s company Group over the years, once the owner of green cloud Island changed, it was impossible for him to follow Liu Qingfeng and the others back to China to work. After all, his home was here.

Moreover, because of the construction project on blue cloud Island, benilatti, a middle – Level manager of the project, had also earned unimaginable wealth for the locals of ponutu. His monthly salary was more than what the locals of ponutu could earn in several years, not to mention that he had a lot of extra money in charge of the procurement and coordination work.

It was no exaggeration to say that because of its position in the blue cloud Island project, bainilatti had a certain status in front of some of the ministers in ponautu. Even if ponautu was small and poor, it was still a country recognized by the United Nations! The director of the Department was definitely a high – Level figure in the agate, and he would always be kind and friendly when he saw him.

All of this was because of the blue cloud Island, because it was the link between the Chinese and the agate.

Now that the Liu family was withdrawing from green cloud Island, benilatti keenly realized that whether he could have an enviable income and status in the future depended on this young man who always had a kind smile on his face.

If he could continue to work in his previous job, it would not make a difference to him who the owner of green cloud Island was.

Therefore, when benilatti shook hands with Xia ruofei, the smile on his face became more humble.””Mr. Xia! I’ll do my best to provide you with the best service in the future!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Mr. Benilatti, at the moment, green cloud Island needs to be stabilized. I naturally hope that you can stay. As for whether you can get a long – term contract, that will depend on your usual performance!”

“I’ll make sure you’re satisfied, Mr. Xia!” Benilatti couldn’t help but puff out his chest.

Liu Qingfeng saw that benilatti couldn’t wait to show his loyalty and felt a little disdainful. However, he knew that Xia ruofei was someone he couldn’t offend. Liu Qunfeng and Liu Kuan had warned him several times in advance, so he didn’t show any dissatisfaction. He just looked at benilatti indifferently.

However, benilatti pretended not to see it and avoided his gaze.

After a short welcoming ceremony, Xia ruofei and the rest went to the building where the green cloud Island project was located.

This was the only building on the island and was now close to completion. However, the interior decoration of some floors still had a little finishing work. In addition, the greenery and landscape project around the building had not been completed.

The building was originally designed as the hub of Qing Yun Island and also had the function of an employee’s apartment. Now that it was basically completed, Xia ruofei had no intention of changing the decoration plan.

It was already dark when they arrived at blue cloud Island, so they naturally wouldn’t go to Evarts Island today. Xia ruofei and the others would rest on Qingyun Island for the night before taking a helicopter to evates Island, the capital of ponautu, the next day.

As for the flight crew of the Airbus A350, Liu Qingfeng had naturally arranged their accommodation and food. They would wait on the Azure cloud Island until Xia ruofei and the others were done with their business. Then, they would fly back to Hua Xia together. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei returned to his room to rest. Although Jian Jia had slept on the plane for a while, the journey had been a little bumpy. Even though her seat was flat, it could not be compared to the big bed at home. Even the bed in the back bedroom of the peach origin was much more comfortable than this first – Class seat. Hence, Xia ruofei did not sleep well.
