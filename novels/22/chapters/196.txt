Chapter 197: Hello, Sister – in – Law

Lin Qiao was also stunned by this scene, and her expression became very subtle. Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””Qiao’ er, let me introduce you! This is Ling Qingxue, my junior high school classmate ... Qingxue, this is Lin Qiao. ” Ling Qingxue let go of Xia ruofei’s hand and took two steps forward. She looked at Lin Qiao with a smile and said,””Little sister Qiao’ er is so young! He should still be in University, right?” Lin Qiao looked at Ling Qingxue and then at the embarrassed Xia ruofei. She didn’t answer Ling Qingxue’s question, but said to Xia ruofei,””Brother ruofei, is this your girlfriend?” “Yup!” Ling Qingxue didn’t wait for Xia ruofei’s reply and quickly said,”sister Qiao’ er, ruofei and I have liked each other since middle school! After that, he joined the Army, and I waited for him for seven whole years ...” “Qingxue, we ...” Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. “RUO Fei, you haven’t told me about sister Qiao’ er’s situation!” Ling Qingxue interrupted Xia ruofei and said with a smile,”she looks so young and innocent. She must still be a student, right?” At this moment, Lin Qiao’s eyes flashed with an imperceptible sense of loss. Then, she quickly adjusted her expression and revealed a surprised smile.”Brother ruofei, it’s really sister – in – Law! Why didn’t you tell me before? As expected of someone who was in the military, you’ve done a good job of keeping this a secret!” Sister – in – Law? Ling Qingxue was stunned. Lin Qiao came forward and held Ling Qingxue’s hand. She said very affectionately,””Sister – in – Law, brother ruofei didn’t introduce himself clearly just now. Let me introduce myself to you! Sister – in – Law, my name is Lin Qiao. I’m Brother ruofei’s ... Sister! He’s in his third year of high school this year. ” “I ... I’m not ...” Ling Qingxue’s face was red, and she was stuttering. This time, it was her turn to be embarrassed. She had just declared that she was Xia ruofei’s girlfriend, that they had been in love since middle school, and that she had waited for Xia ruofei for seven years ... When she thought of what she had just said, she wished there was a hole in the ground for her to crawl into. Especially when she thought of Xia ruofei’s strange look just now, Ling Qingxue felt even more embarrassed and embarrassed. Xia ruofei did not know what Ling Qingxue was up to. He smiled bitterly and shook his head. Then, he added,””Qingxue, Qiao’ er is Hu Zi’s sister, Yueyue. I told you about Hu Zi when we were at the beach.” Ling Qingxue finally understood. She looked at Lin Qiao and said,””So you’re the little sister RUO Fei was talking about! Hey, I thought ...” “What did you think?” Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao asked in unison. “Ah? It’s nothing, nothing. ” Ling Qingxue blushed and said,”ruofei, why didn’t you tell me earlier that Qiao’ er was staying at home? So that I can come earlier! You see ... I didn’t even prepare a gift for Qiao’ er ...” At this moment, Hu Zi’s mother, who was watching TV in her room, heard the noise and opened the door to come out. As soon as Lin Qiao saw her mother, she immediately said,””Mom, come quickly! Brother ruofei’s girlfriend is here!” Ling Qingxue’s face turned even redder. She didn’t even know how to explain herself. Hu Zi’s mother’s eyes lit up when she heard that, especially when she saw Ling Qingxue’s tall and beautiful figure. Her heart bloomed with joy. She smiled at Ling Qingxue and said,””Young lady is really good looking! By the way, what’s your name? How old are you this year? Who’s in the house?” Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.”Aunty,” he said,”don’t scare her anymore. Besides, Qingxue and I haven’t ...” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and interrupted him. She then said sweetly to Hu Zi’s mother,””Aunty, my name is Ling Qingxue. You can just call me Qingxue.” Xia ruofei had told Ling Qingxue about Hu Zi’s family the last time. She was very clear about the relationship between the two families. She also knew that Xia ruofei, who was already an orphan, actually treated Hu Zi’s mother as his own mother. Therefore, when she faced Hu Zi’s mother, she was very polite and basically treated her as Xia ruofei’s mother. “Qingxue ... That’s a nice name ...” Hu Zi’s mother said happily.”Come, come, come, sit here ... Qiao’ er, why are you not moving?” Hurry up and pour some tea for your sister – in – Law!” “Oh!” Lin Qiao replied and quickly went to wash the cup and find the tea leaves. Hu Zi’s mother took Ling Qingxue’s hand and sat down on the sofa. The more she looked at Ling Qingxue, the more she liked her. She pulled her and asked her about this and that. Lin Qiao deliberately coughed a few times to remind her, but Hu Zi’s mother didn’t notice. Xia ruofei stood at the side with a bitter smile on his face. He felt that he was an unnecessary person. Lin Qiao couldn’t stand it anymore. She pulled her mother aside and said softly,”Mom, what are you doing?” “I was chatting with Qingxue! What’s wrong?” Hu ‘er’s mother was a little confused. Lin Qiao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”she’s here to find brother ruofei, why are you talking to her?” It’s not easy to meet them, so we have to make room for them ...” Hu Zi’s mother immediately nodded and said, “Qiao’ er, you’re right! Hey ... Why didn’t you remind me earlier?” “My throat is about to burst from coughing. Why didn’t I remind you?” Lin Qiao was speechless. “Hey ... I didn’t notice. “Alright, alright, I know ...” Hu Zi’s mother was also a little embarrassed. Then, she smiled at Ling Qingxue and said,””Qingxue! Stay for dinner later!” “Will I disturb you guys too much?” Ling Qingxue asked. “You child, why are you treating me like an outsider?” Hu Zi’s mother rebuked,”this is our home! It’s settled then. I’ll cook a few dishes later, and you can try auntie’s cooking. ” “Alright! “Thank you for your trouble, Auntie ...” Ling Qingxue said with a sweet smile. “It’s not hard, not hard!” Hu Zi’s mother chuckled and said,”then you talk to ruofei for a while. I’ll go to the county town to buy some groceries! “Qiao’ er, you’re coming too. Oh, right, where’s Xiao Ye? Give Xiao Ye a call and ask him to drive us to the county ...” “Oh, okay!” Lin Qiao went to call ye Lingyun. “You guys can talk, you guys can talk ...” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile. Then, the mother and daughter left the villa together and closed the door behind them. The living room of the villa, which had been very lively just a moment ago, suddenly quieted down. Only Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were left. Xia ruofei then walked to the sofa opposite Ling Qingxue and sat down. He looked at Ling Qingxue with a half – Smile and asked,””Qingxue, what are you up to today?
