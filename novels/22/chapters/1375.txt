Gulangyu and Heron Island were only about 600 meters apart. Even if they took a slow ferry, it would only take five or six minutes to reach it. The speed of the speedboat was much faster than the ferry.

The small island that was already within everyone’s line of sight rapidly grew in size.

Standing on the dock, they could vaguely see the shadows of the beach, and from the speedboat, they could clearly see the crowd playing in the water.

The speedboat seemed to be flying on the water. Lin Qiao and the other girls screamed in excitement. Even the introverted Cheng Juan was excited. At the same time, they were a little nervous, holding the metal bars on the side of the seat tightly.

The strong wind blew everyone’s hair into a mess. Xia ruofei was worried that Lin Qiao would catch a cold, so he quickly straightened the collar of her down jacket. Lin Qiao smiled sweetly at Xia ruofei and said loudly by his ear,”Thank you, brother ruofei!”

He had to be loud! The wind whistled in his ears, and he couldn’t hear the soft voices.

When the speedboat was about to reach the shallow waters near Gulangyu, it made a clever turn. Like a drift in a racing car, it left a beautiful white arc in the air, and the girls screamed.

The speedboat sped around Gulangyu. The island was very green, and there were lush trees everywhere. When the speedboat came to the side of Zheng Chenggong’s statue, they finally felt how huge the statue was. Although the statue was high, it still gave off an oppressive feeling when they looked up.

After a few rounds, Xia ruofei’s speedboat slowed down and finally stopped at Gulangyu Pier.

Lin Qiao and the others still wanted more.

Everyone walked up to the dock through the ladder. Xiao Zhang had arranged an electric car to carry tourists in advance and was waiting there. He warmly greeted everyone to get on the car.

The group took the electric car and arrived at the hotel that Liu Zhe had arranged for them.

“Brother Xia, everyone must be hungry, right?” Xiao Zhang said enthusiastically,”the hotel room is ready. Let’s go to the restaurant to eat first and then check in. How about it?”

“No problem, we’ll follow your arrangements!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Thus, Xiao Zhang brought everyone to the restaurant on the first floor. The room that had been opened in advance had sufficient heating. He had already ordered some dishes. After everyone found their seats, he asked the waiter to bring over a few more menus and asked Xia ruofei and the others to add a few more dishes.

Xia ruofei was not particularly particular about food. He was used to the delicious Taoyuan vegetables. He would not feel much when he ate exotic delicacies outside.

So, he passed the menu to Lin Qiao and the others with a smile, and then said to Zhao Yongjun,””Big brother Zhao, let the ladies order! No one has any objections, right?”

Zhao Yongjun laughed,”of course!” Besides, the beautiful girls all went to school on Egret Island, so they must know what the local food is good!”

Lin Qiao didn’t stand on ceremony and ordered a few special dishes from the menu. He he and the others were relatively more reserved. Under Xia ruofei’s urging, they each ordered another dish.

Xiao Zhang returned the menu to the waiter and said,””Tell the kitchen to hurry up and prepare the dishes I ordered earlier! Also, bring up the wine that you’ve prepared!”

“Alright! Please wait a moment!” The waiter quickly said.

This was the designated reception unit of Heron island’s state – owned assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Xiao Zhang was specifically responsible for reception, and even their boss had to curry favor with Xiao Zhang, so the attitude of the waiter was naturally respectful.

The waiter first uploaded the menu to the system, then whispered a few instructions through the walkie – talkie, and then served the drinks that had been prepared.

“Brother Xia, shall we have some drinks for lunch?” Xiao Zhang said eagerly.

Xia ruofei took a glance and saw that the white wine was actually drunken eight immortal. He couldn’t help but laugh.

“Alright!” Let’s drink white wine for men! If you girls want to drink red wine, you can have some. If you don’t want to drink wine, you can have fruit juice. You guys can choose!”

“I want to drink red wine!” Lin Qiao immediately raised her hand and said.

“Then I’ll have some red wine too!” Chen Xi didn’t want to fall behind.

The steady he he and the quiet Cheng Juan chose the juice at the same time. One of them ordered orange juice, while the other ordered cucumber juice.

After pouring the drinks, Xia ruofei raised his glass and said with a smile,””Let’s have a drink together! I suggest that we toast the first cup to the students! Thank you for taking care of Qiao’ er!”

Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei with a smile, and a warm feeling filled her heart.

Zhao Yongjun and the others were naturally very supportive and also raised their glasses, making he he and the other two a little embarrassed.

However, they didn’t act bashful. They quickly picked up their glasses and toasted with each other.

After drinking half a glass of red wine, Lin Qiao’s pretty face turned red, which was very cute.

The dishes were served very quickly. Little Zhang specialized in reception, so he was very good at ordering dishes. The various combinations were also very reasonable.

In an Island City like Heron Island, there was naturally a variety of freshest seafood, which was also the most expensive part of the lunch.

In addition, there were local specialties such as ginger mother duck and Tong ‘an sealed meat. The staple food was also very distinctive Taro buns and leek boxes. In addition, there was fish ball soup, braised meat, frozen ground bamboo shoots, and other dishes that were very unique to Heron Island.

Whether it was Zhao Yongjun and the others from the capital, or Lin Qiao and her roommates, they all ate with great relish.
