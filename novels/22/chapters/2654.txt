Xia ruofei’s eyes narrowed and asked,””The most awesome military reform in history?”

Although Xia ruofei had left the Army for a few years, he was still very concerned about the news about the Army. He knew that the Huaxia Army was undergoing a major change from top to bottom. This change was passed down from the highest authority and affected every soldier.

In this wave of reform, some troops had been reorganized and the personnel had been split up. Some of the troops were moved thousands of miles away. Some of the troops were collectively converted to local establishments.

“The news of the reform has been spreading for a long time, and everyone is ready for it. This time, it’s just a matter of boots landing on the ground.” Guo Zhan nodded slightly.

Then, Guo Zhan said,”this time, our station has been changed to a province in the southern part of our country. We’ve been transferred to the Marine Corps. We will move to the new station through the railway. Then, we will change our clothes together.”

Guo Zhan did not go into detail. After all, this involved military secrets. Although he had absolute trust in Xia ruofei, he still had to abide by the confidentiality rules.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’ve changed from the Big Brother of the Army to the Navy!” This change is a bit big!”

“The Navy is a rising military branch. The state has been heavily biased toward it, be it in terms of funding or equipment.” Guo Zhan said,”what’s the saying again? Our future lies in the distant sea!”

“That’s true!” Xia ruofei agreed with Guo Zhan.”That’s a good thing! Why do I feel like you’re a little angry?”

Guo Zhan sighed slightly and said,”looking at the big picture and the long term, this is definitely a good thing!” A more reasonable military structure, a more scientific system, and a smoother command system would obviously improve the combat ability. However, I’m not sure if it’s specific to each individual. Reform is always accompanied by pain!”

Guo Zhan waved his hand and took out a bottle of mineral water from a pile of books. He threw it to Xia ruofei and said,””Let’s not talk about this! Tell me why you’re here! You definitely wouldn’t come to this ravine to find me for no reason!”

Xia ruofei grinned as he opened the bottle of water and took a big gulp. Then, he wiped his mouth and said,””Old leader, I’m here to ask for your help!”

“Oh? What can I do to help you?” Guo Zhan laughed and said,”you’re already a billionaire. If we don’t have anything to eat in the future, we’ll come to you!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“No problem!” Xia ruofei immediately replied,”that’s what I wanted to talk about!”

Guo Zhan couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and said,”What do you mean? You want to give us money? Blood Wolf, I’m telling you, don’t make me make a mistake!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. I would be crazy to give you money! I’m saying, can you give me some people?”

Then, Xia ruofei immediately explained,””I have an overseas project and I need high – end talents in security, but it’s not easy to find people with real skills in this area. I need a lot of people, so I thought of the old army and you, my old leader. I’m sure you’ve contacted all the retired soldiers of lone wolf over the years. Help me recommend a few more! Don’t worry, we’re all brothers in the same trench. I won’t treat them badly in terms of treatment!”

The lone wolf assault team was a bit special. The team was relatively stable, and most of them were non – commissioned officers and officers. The volunteers were as rare as giant pandas. It could be said that there were very few people who could meet the selection standards of the lone wolf assault team in just two years.

Furthermore, the number of retired lone wolf commando unit members and the number of new recruits each year were much fewer than that of ordinary troops. This was the elite of the elite, and their stability was relatively high. Most of them served for a long time.

But even so, there were still people who retired from active service every year. There were factors such as age, physical condition, and personal reasons. In short, there would be more or less a few.

The saying “an iron camp with flowing soldiers” was also applicable to the lone wolf assault team.

Guo Zhan had led this unit for many years, from an ordinary member to a company leader, chief of staff, and finally to the military chief of this unit. He was the most familiar with lone Wolf’s situation. Most of the retired soldiers, like Xia ruofei, still kept in touch with Guo Zhan.

Xia ruofei wanted to build an elite security force for Peach Garden Island. It was not enough to rely on the old comrades that Xu Yougang had found. The number of people was far from enough, so Xia ruofei’s first thought was the lone wolf assault team and Wolf King Guo Zhan.

Hearing this, Guo Zhan’s eyes narrowed and he teased, “You’re not thinking of building an army, are you? This is a very sensitive matter!”

Which of lone Wolf’s retired soldiers hadn’t gone through the tempering of war and devil training day after day? Their individual quality was terrifyingly strong. If such a force was controlled by people with ulterior motives and used to endanger society, the destructive power would be quite amazing.

Of course, Guo Zhan’s words were mostly a joke. He also believed that Xia ruofei would not have any ulterior motives.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry!” I don’t intend to put this team in the country. Let me put it this way! I bought an Island in the South Pacific Ocean, and it’s not very peaceful there, so I have to arrange an elite guard on the island. They will stay on the island most of the time and will hardly have any contact with the country!”
