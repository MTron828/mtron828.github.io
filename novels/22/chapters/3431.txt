Fortunately, Xia ruofei had activated the trap & kill array at the last moment. When the high – Level Shen beast chased after him, it was trapped by the array and could not attack Xia ruofei directly. This gave Xia ruofei a chance to survive.

Xia ruofei recalled the whole process and was indeed terrified.

He stood on the spot and rested for a while.

Ling Qingxue had no idea what was going on in the outside world while she was in the spirit map space. As time passed, she became more and more worried. She couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, can you hear me? How’s the situation on your side?”

Naturally, Xia ruofei could hear Ling Qingxue’s voice in the spirit map space. He also came back to his senses and immediately moved Ling Qingxue to the outside world.

The moment Ling Qingxue came out, she immediately looked at Xia ruofei. Seeing that Xia ruofei was unscathed, she heaved a sigh of relief.

In reality, Xia ruofei had already suffered quite a bit of injury in the illusion. However, they were all internal injuries and could not be seen from the outside. Furthermore, after absorbing an entire petal of the spirit Heart Flower, his injuries had almost recovered. Naturally, Ling Qingxue could not tell.

Ling Qingxue asked,”ruofei, what took you so long?” Are you in trouble?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and pouted at the high level Shen beast’s corpse on the ground.””There! It’s this guy, I almost fell into his trap! Good thing I reacted in time!”

Ling Qingxue looked at the burnt corpse and couldn’t tell what it was. She couldn’t help but ask,””What’s this? Is it very powerful?”

“Shen beast!” Xia ruofei said,”and it’s a high – Level Mirage beast! The realism of that illusion is simply…”

When Xia ruofei thought about the illusion he had just experienced and the scene of Ling Qingxue dying from the sudden explosion of the spaceship, he could not help but shiver even though he knew that it was fake.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but take a deep breath and said,””High – Level Mirage beast! That would be too dangerous! It’s a good thing you’re stronger, otherwise…”

Xia ruofei said,”it’s all thanks to the trap and kill array!” Otherwise, even if I didn’t die in the illusion, I would’ve died without any resistance under its attack!”

At this point, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh and say,””I’m still not strong enough! Just now, I fell into an illusion without realizing it, and I didn’t even have a chance to resist!”

Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s hand and said,””You’re already very powerful! Cultivation was a gradual process, and there would always be someone stronger! Compared to the other Aurous core stage cultivators, you’re already much stronger! RUO Fei, don’t think too much. In my heart, you’re always the best!”

Xia ruofei had just experienced a moment of life and death, and his mind had not been able to calm down. After being comforted by Ling Qingxue’s gentle words, his mood calmed down quite a bit.

He smiled and patted Ling Qingxue’s hand.””Mm! Don’t worry! I only sighed a little! In any case, my fighting spirit is always exuberant. Even if I encounter an opponent much stronger than me, they may be able to kill me, but they definitely can’t wear down my fighting spirit!”

“Pei Pei Pei! You’re not allowed to say such inauspicious words!” Ling Qingxue said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”good, good, good!” Let’s not talk about this! Let’s continue exploring! I think there’s a Palace area behind it. I’d like to see what other monsters will jump out of this floor’s quest!”

After the encounter with the Mirage beast, Xia ruofei had a sense of danger. This was his intuition for danger. Xia ruofei had always been more sensitive in this aspect.

After the high – Level Mirage beast was killed, the warning sign disappeared.

This meant that they were safe for the time being. This was also why Xia ruofei could move Ling Qingxue out of the spirit map space without worry.

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”alright!” RUO Fei, do you want me to hide in your protective magical treasure? This way, you won’t have any worries!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s okay. If there’s any danger, I’ll still be able to use my defensive magical equipment.” It’s very boring for you to stay inside the protective barrier alone, and you can’t see or hear anything. It’s not a good feeling, and you’ll always be worried about my safety. It’s better to explore the heavenly cloud Palace with me outside!”

Xia ruofei knew very well that the small space in the mountain and sea realm was completely isolated from the outside world. Looking out from all directions, there was only a white fog, and it was absolutely quiet. He could even hear his own heartbeat clearly. In addition, the space was so small that it was really uncomfortable to stay in it.

In Xia ruofei’s old army, there was a kind of confinement room. It was the same principle.

Every side of the room was wrapped with very good sound – absorbing materials, and there was only a small air vent that could let in a little light. There was no light in the room, and it was dark most of the time.

When people were locked inside, they would feel that time had slowed down a lot.

A few hours might be bearable, but if it was a day or two, or even more, it would simply drive people crazy.

Therefore, some soldiers who made mistakes would rather run ten 10 – kilometer armed cross – country runs than be locked up for two days.

Although the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space was not as exaggerated as the confinement unit, it was at least bigger and had more light. However, it did have the same effect as the confinement unit. Xia ruofei naturally could not bear to let Ling Qingxue endure that kind of environment for a long time.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he couldn’t reveal the existence of the spirit map space, he could have let Ling Qingxue stay in the mountain and sea realm. The spiritual Qi there was dense, and there was green grass, beaches, and the sea. If one didn’t pay attention, it would be no different from a top resort on earth. If it was in such an environment, he could let Ling Qingxue stay there for a long time without worry.

But now, he could not.

Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s arm and smiled.””Alright then! I’ll be by your side! To be honest, it’s safe inside the protective magic treasure, but it’s really uncomfortable to stay inside for a long time!”

“Go! Let’s continue forward and take a look!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The two of them passed through the winding path and the entire garden before they arrived at the door of the third Hall.

The door of the hall was open, but there was a shadow wall blocking it, so he couldn’t see what was going on inside.

Moreover, the hall seemed to be shielded from spiritual power. Xia ruofei tried to use his spiritual power to investigate but could not find anything.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other, then said to Ling Qingxue,””Follow me closely! You must be careful! I think there’s something strange about this Hall!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue also nodded nervously.

In fact, there must be something strange about this Palace. After all, they had to complete their mission after entering the cloud Palace. It was impossible for them to walk through it so calmly without any obstacles.

Hence, Xia ruofei was already mentally prepared.

He let go of Ling Qingxue’s hand and took out the flying sword of the qushuang and the traveling Jade immortal sword. Then, he carefully led Ling Qingxue into the palace.

Behind the door was a wall that blocked out the situation inside the hall. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue turned to the right, trying to go around the wall.

As soon as the two of them turned around the image wall – they retreated backward at the same time. Behind the image wall was actually a row of star Fern thorns.

At such a close distance, they had naturally entered the attack range of star Fern thorn. So, as soon as the two figures appeared, star Fern thorn immediately launched a thorn attack.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s reaction speed was quite fast, and there was a shadow wall at the side. Hence, the wave of star Fern sting did not pose much of a threat to them.

“The star Fern thorn has also appeared. Is the trial Pagoda’s seventh floor a gathering of monsters?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but smile bitterly..
