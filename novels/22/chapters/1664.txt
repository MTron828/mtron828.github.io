Chapter 1665: You’ll Control_2

Captain Johnson had been poisoned to death a long time ago. Fortunately, he had been wearing a seat belt when he was alive, so during the explosion, he was firmly fixed in his seat. At least, he did not die without a corpse.

However, after Brook said that, Guli and the air traffic police, who were squeezed in front of the cockpit door, were dumbfounded. They couldn’t hear what Brook said at all.

At this moment, the wind was howling in the cockpit. They could only see Brook and Xia ruofei’s mouths opening and closing. Especially Captain Brook, his facial muscles were constantly trembling and deformed under the strong wind. He looked a little funny.

Brook didn’t notice that he and Xia ruofei could communicate normally in such an environment. With Xia ruofei’s hearing, it was no problem for her to hear what he said. When Xia ruofei spoke, she used her true energy to form a thread and sent it into Brook’s ear.

There was no other way. The other party couldn’t hear him if he spoke normally.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei also knew what the problem was. He temporarily acted as the mouthpiece and turned around.””Captain Brook said to ask you to move Captain Johannson’s body out immediately and settle it down properly!”

Guli and the air traffic police heard this and quickly nodded in agreement.

The air Marshal squeezed into the cockpit, unbuckled Captain Johannson’s seat belt, and then carefully moved his body out of the cockpit.

Xia ruofei quickly took the captain’s seat. Brook saw this and said loudly,””Sir, is there a problem with you taking over the plane?”

Xia ruofei was speechless. There was a problem! There was simply too much of a problem.

“Captain Brook, what should I do?” he asked weakly.

“What type of aircraft have you flown before?” Asked Brook.

“Transport helicopter ...” Xia ruofei scratched his head.

Hearing this, Captain Brook almost vomited blood. Did God send you here to play with me? Transport helicopters and large jets have nothing to do with each other, okay?

However, under such circumstances, did he have any other choice?

No matter what, it was better than watching the plane crash, right?

Brook calmed down and said,””It doesn’t matter. The basic operation of the plane is not complicated. Besides, I’m here! “Sir, please take over the control of the driver’s seat and gently push the handle forward. Keep the nose of the plane facing down slightly. Also, pull the accelerator handle back a little. We’re going too fast. There’s a rudder under your feet, so you don’t have to adjust the direction for now. Our top priority is to immediately descend!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

He retracted the accelerator with his right hand and placed his left hand on the control stick.

“You’ll do the next part!” They talked with Captain Brook.

“Understood!” Xia ruofei replied loudly.

On the other side, Brook was grimacing in pain as he let go of his hand. After a while, he was already feeling unbearable pain. He really couldn’t hold on any longer.

Xia ruofei felt the control stick in his hand sink a little. He quickly held it tightly and pushed it forward gently.

“Don’t move too much, take it back a little!” Captain Brook shouted.

Xia ruofei quickly pulled the control stick back a little. The electronic feedback of the plane was quite sensitive. A slight movement of the control stick in his hand would cause the plane to make an obvious attitude adjustment.

Soon, Xia ruofei had a rough idea of how to get in. The plane was finally descending at a relatively safe speed.

Captain Brook heaved a sigh of relief. He then looked at the instrument in front of him and paid close attention to the altitude, speed, and other parameters of the plane.

Xia ruofei asked as he focused on controlling the plane,””Captain Brook, is there anything else I should be careful of?”

Captain Brook thought for a moment and said,””If possible, please inform the passengers to calm down and make sure that everyone is wearing an oxygen mask!”

The air was very thin now, and the cabin was in a state of extreme oxygen deficiency. If the passengers did not put on an oxygen mask at the first moment, it could cause brain damage.

As for the cockpit, he couldn’t care less.

Both of Captain Brook’s hands were basically disabled and he could not put on an oxygen mask. As for Xia ruofei, he did not have any free hands at all. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had not received any professional training. He was afraid that he would not be able to put on an oxygen mask.

Therefore, Captain Brook did not mention wearing a mask. He could only hope that the plane’s altitude would drop quickly to increase the oxygen content in the air so that it would not be affected.

In fact, he was overthinking. Even if he fainted due to lack of oxygen, Xia ruofei would be fine. The body of a cultivator was much stronger than that of an ordinary person.

“Okay!” Xia ruofei nodded.

He didn’t use the cabin’s communication device because he didn’t know how to use it, and also because he probably wouldn’t be able to hear the call in such a howling environment. He might as well shout.

Xia ruofei turned around and shouted,”Purser!” The purser! Come over here!”

Guli heard Xia ruofei’s shout and rushed into the cockpit.

She was stunned when she saw Xia ruofei sitting in the captain’s seat. However, since it was Captain Brook’s decision, she naturally would not ask Jian Jia. In fact, the cabin was in a mess and she did not have the energy to care so much.

Xia ruofei turned around and told her about Captain Brook’s request. Guli nodded and said,”No problem! The crew members are already instructing the passengers to wear oxygen masks and comforting them!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said to Captain Brook,””Captain Brook, I have a friend in first class. I hope she can come to the cockpit! Don’t worry, I just want her to stay by my side. She won’t affect the flight!”

Brook only hesitated for a moment before he nodded in agreement.

Normally, ordinary passengers were not allowed to enter the cockpit during the flight. However, it was a critical moment now. The entire plane was counting on Xia ruofei. Captain Brook would not be so rigid.

Xia ruofei saw this and quickly said to Guli,””Purser, my friend is in first class. Please call her to the cockpit! Captain Brook has agreed to it. ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Guli looked at Brook and saw him nodding. She said,”Alright, please wait a moment!”

The reason why Xia ruofei asked Feng Rao to come to the cockpit was to prepare for the worst.

If the plane couldn’t land safely, or if there was an accident that couldn’t be saved, he would have to hide in the spirit map space immediately. Feng Rao would have to be in the cockpit too, so he could bring her into the spirit map space in the shortest time.

As for the other passengers and crew members on the plane, Xia ruofei could not care less if they were in danger. He was a human, not a God.

Xia ruofei told Guli Feng Jing’s seat number and then she left the cockpit.

Captain Brook turned to Xia ruofei and said,””We can’t communicate with the ground now, so we have to set the answering machine to 7700. This is the emergency code. After the ground radar recognizes it, it will know that our plane is in an emergency!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”you teach me how to operate it. I’ll set it up!”

There were many meters and buttons in the cockpit of the Airbus. If it was his first time here, he would probably feel dizzy just looking at it.

Fortunately, there was an experienced pilot like Brook. Although his arm was injured, his brain was still working.

Under Brook’s guidance, Xia ruofei slowly set the code of the answering machine to 7700.

Brook heaved a sigh of relief. If the drone had not malfunctioned, then the air traffic control should have known that his plane had an accident.

One had to know that the plane was already very far off course. If they accidentally entered a no – Fly zone or the airspace of a certain country, they could really be shot down.

At the very least, the danger in this aspect had been reduced by a lot.

Of course, the most important thing was to lower the altitude as soon as possible. The second was to determine the location of the aircraft as soon as possible and contact the ground.

Just as Xia ruofei set the code for the answering machine, a worried Feng Jing entered the cockpit under Guli’s lead ...
