Chapter 716: Return with a full load (2)

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””It’s okay, we’re not in a hurry. ” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, the store manager turned to Lin Qiao and asked,””This student, I noticed that when your companion shot the ball just now, you seemed to have recorded the entire process, right?”

“Yeah!” Lin Qiao nodded. What’s wrong?”

“It’s like this,”the manager quickly said,” can you give us a copy of your video? we want to use it to make a promotional video for this promotion! After all, you guys won the ultimate prize!”

“Well ...” Lin Qiao couldn’t make up her mind. She looked at Xia ruofei.

After the store manager observed his expression, he quickly said,””Of course, we won’t take your video for free. As a token of our gratitude, I can make the decision to gift you the latest 128G iPad mini4.”

This iPad mini4 cost about 3000 to 4000 Yuan. Xia ruofei didn’t really care about the money. He thought for a while and said to Lin Qiao,””Qiao’ er, let me see the recording first. ”

“En!” Lin Qiao immediately took out her phone and showed Xia ruofei the video that she had just recorded.

Xia ruofei watched it carefully. Lin Qiao was standing behind him. The focus of the video was on the shooting machine, and he was only captured from the back. His face was not shown the whole time.

Although Lin Qiao had shouted “brother ruofei, you can do it” in the video, people who were not familiar with her would not think of Xia ruofei.

As for those who were very familiar with him, such as Ling Qingxue, they would be able to recognize him just by looking at his back.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and felt that it was not a big deal to give this video to the store. It should not cause him any trouble.

Moreover, as the chairman of the Paradise Corporation, as the company continued to grow and grow in the future, he would inevitably step up to the front stage and gain more and more fame. This was not something he could control.

......

Therefore, he didn’t need to keep a low profile on purpose.

Xia ruofei said,”I can give you the video. However, don’t take any photos when you receive the award. I don’t want my face to become your publicity material.”

“This ...” The store manager showed a difficult expression.”Sir, can we discuss this again?” Why don’t we ... Invite this student to receive the award?”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He looked at Lin Qiao and asked,””Qiao’ er, can you go and receive the award?”

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”sure!” If brother Fei doesn’t want to show his face in public, I don’t mind!”

Hence, Xia ruofei said to the store manager,””Alright then! Let Qiao’ er go and receive the award, but ... You guys won’t use the little girl’s portrait for nothing, right?”

The store manager couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He pondered for a while before saying,””Sir, why don’t we give you an original Apple external optical drive for free? If I were to purchase it separately, it would cost around 600 Yuan. This ... Is already the maximum authority I can give!”

The manager wasn’t lying. The iPad mini4 that he had promised to give out was actually the maximum he could give. However, breaking the 1000 – point record and winning the ultimate prize was indeed a hot topic. It would definitely be a great help to the promotion.

That was why he had gritted his teeth and sent out an external optical drive. Under the circumstances where he had a legitimate reason, it should not be a big problem to report it later.

Xia ruofei naturally did not mind. He smiled and nodded.”Alright then! We’ll do as you say!”

At this moment, a shop assistant came over to report that the big gift bag’s prize had been prepared.

The store manager immediately ordered the staff to prepare a brand new 128G iPad mini4 and an original external optical drive. Then, he invited Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao to receive the award.

The place to receive the prize was in front of the cashier. The staff had even placed the promotional posters on both sides. There were more than ten big gift bags with boxes of all sizes stacked together. It was a very visually impactful sight.

Since Xia ruofei didn’t show up, Lin Qiao walked up to the store manager and took the generous prize from him. Then, she took a photo with the store manager in front of the poster.

After the photos were taken, Xia ruofei went up and took the boxes of different sizes from Lin Qiao.

Although Xia ruofei did not open up all the prizes, he still carefully looked at the poster of Qin Zhuan’s event. The prizes were basically all top – tier models, so he still had to check them.

After Xia ruofei verified the video, the manager walked over with the iPad mini4 and the original external optical drive. After handing the extra prize to Xia ruofei, the manager took Lin Qiao’s mobile phone as if he had obtained a treasure. He went to the cashier to connect the data cable to the computer and copied the video.

The two of them left the electronics mall with a bunch of prizes in their hands.

After returning to the Knight XV SUV, Lin Qiao looked at the mountain of prizes in the back seat and said with a smile,””Brother ruofei, I can’t believe it. This is like a dream!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”I’ve promised you that I’ll win this big gift bag. You have to keep your word!”

“Brother ruofei, you’re the best!” Lin Qiao said.

In fact, a prize of 40000 to 50000 Yuan was nothing in Xia ruofei’s eyes. But to make Lin Qiao so happy, it was something that money couldn’t buy.

Xia ruofei started the car and drove away from the parking space.

At this moment, Lin Qiao revealed a worried expression and said,””Brother ruofei, if we bring so many Apple Electronics back, my mom will definitely scold me again ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”isn’t that simple?” Anyway, there’s a 13.3 – inch MacBookPro in the prize money. The 15 – inch MacBookPro I bought for the girl is a bit too big, so the 13 – inch one is just right for you. In this way, I bought the computer myself and gave you the prize I won in the event without spending a single cent. Auntie won’t say anything to you, right?”

“That makes sense!” Lin Qiao’s eyes lit up.”Brother ruofei, you’re so smart!”

Then, she hesitated for a moment and said,””Brother ruofei, you won all the prizes. Are you really giving them all to me? Why don’t you ... Keep it for yourself!”

Lin Qiao was an honest village girl. Although the prizes were free, their value was obvious. Subconsciously, she felt that it was inappropriate for Xia ruofei to give her such an expensive gift.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”silly girl, what are you thinking?” I don’t need those things, so I’ll give them to you. Besides, what’s wrong with a brother giving his sister a gift? Besides, I haven’t even spent a single cent on these!”

“But ...”

“You don’t have to say ‘but’!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going to get angry if you keep rejecting me!”

“Okay ...” Lin Qiao smiled at Xia ruofei.”Thank you, brother ruofei!”

The two of them quickly returned to the rental house in the forestry Bureau’s family courtyard. Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared a simple luggage, and everyone quickly went downstairs.

After they got into the car, Hu Zi’s mother saw the pile of prizes in the back seat. Although she didn’t know the exact value, she knew that things like apples were very expensive, so she couldn’t help but blame Lin Qiao for being insensible.

Xia ruofei quickly explained the reason that he had prepared. Hu Zi’s mother was still a little skeptical. Lin Qiao showed her the video of Xia ruofei shooting the basketball in front of the store and dispelled her suspicion.

However, Hu Zi’s mother couldn’t help but say a few words about Xia ruofei giving all these valuable prizes to Lin Qiao. Xia ruofei said that these things were used by the students and he didn’t have any use for them. It would be a waste to bring them home, so he gave them to Lin Qiao.

Only then did Hu Zi’s mother stop asking.

Soon, Xia ruofei drove out of the city and returned to Taoyuan farm.

Xia ruofei was the only one living in the small villa now. The guest room on the first floor had been vacated, so when they got home, Xia ruofei found a clean bed sheet from the cabinet and quickly prepared a room for the two of them.

After putting the luggage away, Lin Qiao didn’t even bother to study the pile of Apple Electronics. She pestered Xia ruofei and said,””Brother ruofei, the fruits on your farm are ripe, right? Can you take me to go and have some fun picking?”
