As soon as Xia ruofei said that, the people who were watching the show suddenly burst into an uproar. “He still dared to gamble after cutting it to pieces ... Is there something wrong with his brain?” “There’s no way this raw stone can contain any green. This young man is clearly a newbie. This is a battle of personal feelings!” “He’s rich, so he can do whatever he wants!” “One look and I can tell he’s a prodigal!” …… Everyone was laughing at Xia ruofei’s impulsiveness, but Xia ruofei’s face remained calm as he looked at the fat man quietly. The fat man’s mouth twitched and he sneered,””If I don’t even dare to bet on a sure – win situation, how can I still have the face to stay in the Jade world? Speak! What are we betting on?” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”gambling with my life ...” He clearly heard the people around him gasp in unison. He deliberately paused for a moment before he continued,””It seems a little too serious. Let’s bet some money then!” The people who were watching the show immediately laughed. It was really scary to talk and gasp for breath! However, they saw that Xia ruofei was still in the mood to joke and seemed to have a plan in mind. They also felt that they could not see through Yingying’s sure – lose bet! Where did his confidence come from? The fat man was shocked when he heard the word ‘life – risking’. Only after Xia ruofei changed the topic did he realize that he had been tricked. He could not help but sneer,”gambling is good!” I, Cheng Junhua, don’t lack money! Speak! How much do you want to bet? As long as you can take it out, I’ll play with you!” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said in a relaxed manner,””It’s good to have a small bet, just play around. Let’s bet ... Three hundred thousand! Boss Cheng, don’t tell me you can’t even take out three hundred thousand Yuan?” Those who could come here to gamble on stones naturally wouldn’t be poor. However, most of the people present wouldn’t bet three hundred thousand Yuan just because of a few words. The fat rich man, Cheng Junhua’s expression changed a few times, but he quickly said,””Three hundred thousand it is! Even teacher chi has personally appraised the raw stone, and it even broke with one cut. If you can get green, I’ll eat it on the spot!” “The Jade is mine too, why should I let you eat it?” Xia ruofei smiled and said. “You ...” Cheng Junhua said,”don’t be so sharp – tongued! I agree to your bet, but ... Can you afford three hundred thousand?” Cheng Junhua saw that Xia ruofei was dressed simply and did not look like a rich man, so his tone was full of suspicion and disdain. Xia ruofei did not say much. He took out his bank card and said,””There should be more than 300000 Yuan in here. Boss Cheng, you have to take out some money too! Otherwise, how can I trust you?” Cheng Junhua snorted and said,”there are 300000 in there just because you say so!” What if it’s an empty card?” Xia ruofei shrugged and asked,”then what do you think we should do?” Going to the bank to get cash? You need to make an appointment to withdraw a large amount of money, and isn’t that too time – consuming?” Cheng Junhua was also feeling a little awkward. At this moment, a burst of hearty laughter came from the entrance of the shop. “Why is my little shop so lively today?” a forthright voice said. As soon as he finished speaking, a man split the crowd and walked into the shop. The man was in his early forties and was wearing a red Tang suit. He walked with a strong aura. “Boss Chen!” “Hello, boss Chen!” Everyone greeted the man, and the waiter who had brought Xia ruofei over quickly introduced him in a low voice.””Sir, this is our boss Chen of Lingyu house!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at boss Chen. Boss Chen looked at the waitress beside Xia ruofei. Then, he said to Xia ruofei in a friendly manner,””The store just called me, saying that someone wants to buy jade, and it’s a long – term cooperation. I think it must be this little brother!” “It’s me. Hello, boss Chen!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Little brother is indeed a man of striking appearance!” Boss Chen laughed and then asked,”what happened just now?” Xia ruofei didn’t say anything, but the people around him started to tell him what had happened. When boss Chen heard this, he looked at the two halves of the raw stone on the ground and said to Xia ruofei with a strange expression,””Little brother, you’re all customers of my old Chen’s shop. I think ... We should forget about this bet ...” Of course, boss Chen was the most familiar with this raw stone. In fact, the quality of the whole batch of goods was not high, and this raw stone had the worst appearance. Some people even suspected that it was actually an ordinary stone randomly picked up from the mine and sold in the raw stone. Hence, he tactfully advised Xia ruofei out of good intentions. However, Xia ruofei just smiled and said,””Boss Chen, I appreciate your kind intentions. But since this boss Cheng is so bold, I will definitely accompany him to the end.” Cheng Junhua also frowned and said,”old Chen, we’ve already agreed on this, so don’t get involved!” But since you’re here, you can be our witness! Otherwise, we can’t trust each other!” Boss Chen smiled bitterly and helplessly. He looked at Xia ruofei inquisitively. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” We’ll hand our cards over to boss Chen and check if the balance exceeds 300000. Then we can continue cutting the stones. ” Seeing that Xia ruofei had made up her mind, Mr. Chen had no choice but to agree. Cheng Junhua had no objections. They both handed their bank cards to Mr. Chen. There was a POS machine in the store, and he could check his balance. Soon, the balance in their cards was found. They both had more than 300000 Yuan. Cheng Junhua was slightly surprised to see that the plainly – dressed Xia ruofei really had more than 300000 Yuan in his card. However, his mind was focused on the bet. After checking the balance, he couldn’t wait to say,””Continue! If I win your 300000 Yuan, it’ll be just enough for my baby to get a new car!” The flirtatious woman was overjoyed when she heard this. She kissed Cheng Junhua several times, giving Xia ruofei goosebumps. He was too lazy to argue and said to the master,””Master, can I do it myself?” The stonecutter looked at boss Chen, who nodded slightly. Since the boss had agreed, the stonecutter was naturally happy to be idle and gave up his position. The operation of the stone cutter was not complicated. Xia ruofei could basically use it after looking at it. Besides, he did not need to Polish the stone. He could just cut it in half. It was simple and crude. Xia ruofei’s eyes revealed a mischievous look. He picked up half of the raw stone and fixed it on the stone cutter. Then, he turned on the power and cut it down from the waist. After a burst of ear – piercing friction sound, the raw stone was also cut in half. Everyone’s eyes fell on the cut in unison. After the clear water flowed over it, there was still no green at all. Suddenly, there was a wave of sighs. The onlookers looked at Xia ruofei with sympathy and some gloated. Everyone was talking about Xia ruofei’s unwise behavior. Cheng Junhua’s expression became even more relaxed. In his eyes, 300000 Yuan was too easy a win. Xia ruofei’s expression did not change. He fixed the cut stone back to the machine, turned on the power, and continued cutting. With the roar of the machine, the half of the raw stone was cut into many small stones. However, just as everyone had predicted, there was no Jade in it. Cheng Junhua could not help but say sarcastically,””This is the first time I’ve seen someone cut a stone so thoroughly! It’s already cut like this and there’s still no green, you have nothing to say now, right?” Xia ruofei pointed at the other half of the raw stone indifferently and said,””I’m only halfway through! Didn’t you cut that piece over there? What’s the hurry!” When Xia ruofei was examining the two raw gemstones, he realized that the painting did not react at all when he held one half in his hand. However, when he held the other half, the painting started to vibrate. This meant that all the Jade in the raw stone was concentrated in the other half. Just now, Xia ruofei had intentionally cut the half without the Jade first with a hint of mischief. Cheng Junhua snorted coldly and said,”you really won’t shed tears until you see the coffin!” I’ll wait here and see what you have to say after I cut open the other half!” Boss Chen watched from the side and shook his head secretly. He also thought that Xia ruofei would lose for sure. He was just holding on. The corners of Xia ruofei’s mouth curled up, revealing a meaningful smile. He calmly cleaned the stones on the machine, and then slowly fixed the other half of the raw stone on the machine. Xia ruofei turned on the power and operated the cutting blade to cut the half of the raw stone.
