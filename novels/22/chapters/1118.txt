After that, song Rui wiped his head and left.

Seeing that song Rui had left, Lu You felt a little embarrassed instead, and a faint blush appeared on her face. After all, a man and a woman were alone in another person’s room. It was indeed a little inappropriate.

However, when Lu You saw that Xia ruofei was smiling at her, she immediately raised her chin and gritted her teeth. She then walked into Xia ruofei’s room. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Miss Lu, it’s only Seveno’ clock and you’ve already found your way to the hotel! What’s the rush?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile as he filled the kettle with water.

Lu You’s watery eyes glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,””You’ve already forgotten what you promised me yesterday?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. The water overflowed after the kettle was filled and flowed onto his hand. He then came back to his senses and quickly reached out to turn off the tap. He took an unused towel and wiped it. Then, he placed the kettle on the base and turned on the switch.

Lu You was still looking at Xia ruofei. His mind was spinning quickly. Then, he patted his forehead and said,””Oh! Are you here to get the jaded skin ointment? What the ... This is too enthusiastic! Don’t tell me you came out before daybreak?”

Lu You’s face heated up. She stomped her feet in embarrassment and said,””Why do you care? Was there even a jaded skin cream? I don’t want to waste my time ...”

In fact, she could take the jaded skin cream anytime. No matter how much Lu You liked to look pretty, it wasn’t that urgent for her to use skin care products with her creamy skin. However, she got up early and left the house after contacting song Rui. The sky outside was really just starting to brighten.

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”yes, yes, yes!” Please wait a moment!”

With that, Xia ruofei walked into the bedroom. He muttered to himself and took out twenty portions of jaded skin ointment from the spirit map space. He put them in a paper bag and put them in it. The jaded skin ointment was about to be mass – produced. During this period of time, Xia Qing had brewed quite a lot of jaded skin ointment in the spirit map space. Hence, Xia ruofei was much more generous than before.

Xia ruofei walked out of the bedroom with the paper bag and placed it on the coffee table. He smiled and said,””There are twenty portions inside. You and Auntie Tian can each take half. Is that enough?”

“That’s more like it ...”Lu You nodded.

Seeing that Lu You had no intention of leaving, Xia ruofei did not know what to say. The atmosphere in the room was a little awkward and ambiguous.

At this moment, the Kettle’s switch flickered. Xia ruofei quickly said,””That ... Do you want to sit for a while? I’ll make you some tea!”

“Alright!” Lu You replied quickly and sat down on the sofa.

Xia ruofei thought to himself, Hey! Sister, you’re really not polite ...

He walked over and brought the boiled water over. Then, he went back to the bedroom and took out a box of tea leaves. It was the same box that he opened yesterday, which song Rui had stolen.

The tea leaves were naturally the best Da Hong Pao produced in the realm. The tea in the hotel was a little shabby, but it was still acceptable.

Xia ruofei made the tea skillfully, and the room was filled with the alluring fragrance of tea.

He poured a cup of tea and pushed it in front of Lu You. He smiled and said,””Have a taste. This is my self – made Da Hong Pao.”

Lu You was also attracted by the rich Tea fragrance. She reached out to pick up the teacup and brought it to her mouth to blow on it gently.

Her tender red lips were faintly discernible in the mist, giving her an alluring look. Xia ruofei’s heart could not help but skip a beat when he saw her. He quickly looked away and poured himself a cup of tea to hide his embarrassment.

Lu You took a small sip and savored the taste slowly. She smiled and said,””It’s so good!”

Then, Lu You immediately said,”this tea is not bad. Can you get me a few boxes too?” Whoever sees it gets a share ...”

Xia ruofei had a smug smile on his face at first, but after hearing Lu You’s words, his smile froze. He felt as if ten thousand alpacas were running through his heart.

Whoever sees it gets a share? It was like plucking feathers from a goose that flew by!

Why was this girl just like song Rui! No wonder their parents wanted to set them up ... Xia ruofei complained in his heart.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s stunned expression, Lu You couldn’t help but smile and say,””You can’t be that petty, can you?”

“Can I not give it to you?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

“What do you think?” Lu You grinned as she looked at Xia ruofei, but there was a hint of threat in her eyes.

Lu You would only smile more in front of Xia ruofei. To be honest, Lu You looked pretty when she smiled. However, Xia ruofei was filled with grief and indignation and had no mood to admire her.

He sighed and said,”alright!” I’ll give it to you ... But the production of these tea leaves is very low, so I can only give you one box at most!”

“One box it is!” Lu You opened her palm and said to Xia ruofei,”hand it over!”

“You’re afraid I won’t admit it?” Xia ruofei muttered as he stood up. He walked to the bedroom and took out a box of tea leaves from the medium. Then, he turned around and walked back to the small reception room.

“There! Just take it!” Xia ruofei placed the tea leaves in Lu You’s hand.”There’s only one box. There’s no more!”

“How stingy ...” Lu You pouted slightly and reluctantly took the box of tea leaves.

“Hey, when do you plan to return to the three mountains?” Lu You placed the tea leaves into the paper bag that contained the jaded skin ointment and asked.

Xia ruofei replied casually,”not necessarily. I might stay for a day or two. I’ve already finished my business in the capital.”

“Oh ... Then let me know when the time is set! I’ll go back with you. ” Lu You said in a casual tone.

“You’re also returning to the three mountains?” Xia ruofei asked subconsciously.

“Nonsense! I still have to go to school!” Lu You looked at Xia ruofei amusedly and said,”I’m here to ask for leave! Don’t tell me you think that I have to settle down in the capital just because my mother is transferred there?”

“No...” Xia ruofei chuckled.

At this moment, there was another knock on the door. Xia ruofei stood up immediately and said,””Is song Rui done yet?”

She knocked on his door three times in one morning. Xia ruofei was speechless.

He strode over and pulled open the door. However, when he saw who it was, Xia ruofei swallowed all his complaints.

“So it’s President Feng!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Feng Rao was shocked when she saw Xia ruofei open the door with a look of displeasure. She only spoke carefully when she saw Xia ruofei smile.””Chairman, we’ve chosen a place with good scenery in the suburbs of Beijing. We’re preparing to shoot an outdoor shoot, so we’re here to talk to you ...”

Feng Rao was in the middle of her sentence when she saw a slim figure in Xia ruofei’s room through the half – opened door. She was stunned.

When she thought of Xia ruofei’s unhappy expression, Feng Jing suddenly had countless associations. A faint resentment and an indescribable emotion rose in her heart.

No wonder the chairman looked so angry just now! “Could it be that they’ve been ...” Feng Jing thought to herself.

She had been so busy with the promotional video and the posters for the past two days, but Xia ruofei did not even ask about it. He even had a beautiful lady to spend the night with in the capital. Feng Jing could not help but feel wronged.

If the person accompanying Xia ruofei was Ling Qingxue, Feng Rao might not have thought much of it. However, the woman in the room was obviously not Ling Qingxue!

The chairman doesn’t have any self – respect ... Feng Jing thought to herself.

She looked behind Xia ruofei with a complicated expression, squeezed out a smile, and said,””Chairman, I’m sorry! I didn’t know you guys ... Hehe, sorry for disturbing you ...”

She turned around to leave.

Xia ruofei was also confused when he saw Feng Jing’s mood suddenly turn so low and then she wanted to leave.

But he subconsciously turned around and immediately understood what was going on. He quickly grabbed Feng Rao’s hand and said,””President Feng, you’ve misunderstood ...”
