“No problem!” Benilatti said. The boss thinks highly of me now and basically takes me with him wherever he goes, so you’ve found the right person! I can definitely provide first – hand information. But ... The price ...”

Wang Boshan snorted and said,”when have I ever treated you badly?” You should have received the reward from last time, right? Are you satisfied?”

Benilatti immediately said with a smile,””I’m satisfied! He was satisfied! Of course I’m satisfied! Mr. Wang, then this time ...”

“As long as the information is useful to me, the reward this time will be more than the last time!” Wang Boshan said.

Now was the crucial moment, Wang Boshan naturally would not be stingy with this small amount of money. Moreover, bainilatti was a mole who sold information. Giving him more money would not arouse suspicion like Xia ruofei. According to bainilatti’s greedy nature, he would only work harder to collect information.

Sure enough, after Wang Boshan said this, he heard bainilatti happily say,””Boss Wang is really straightforward! It’s been a pleasure working with you!”

“Let’s not waste time. Tell me what Xia ruofei did today!” Wang Boshan said indifferently.

“Alright! Alright!” Benilatti said,”Mr. Wang, you’ve found the right person. My boss took me to the capital Island on a helicopter as soon as he got off the plane today, so you can only ask me to understand the situation clearly. No one else knows!”

“He went to Evarts Island?” Wang Boshan’s heart was slightly happy, and he asked without changing his expression,”tell me in detail what he did!”

“The boss has an appointment with ponautu’s Minister of the Interior, Evian.” “The boss also accidentally revealed that he prepared a check for 50000 US dollars as a gift when he went to see Evian,” said benilatti. The two of them had a long private conversation in eviern s office before they had lunch together. However, I didn’t get close to them, so I don’t know the specific content of the conversation. ”

Wang Boshan was deep in thought and said in his heart,”It seemed that this kid didn’t suspect anything. He probably went to Peach Blossom Island to coordinate the transfer of ownership of the island. It was impossible to give 50000 dollars as a gift if it was a daily relationship ... But if he could make billions of dollars immediately, it was reasonable to invest a little money to make things go smoothly ...

“Mr. Wang! Mr. Wang!” Seeing that Wang Boshan had suddenly lost his voice, benilati could not help but call out.

Wang Boshan came back to his senses and said,”beniladi, your information is very useful to me.” Your pay will be transferred to your account today. You can Check and Collect it when you have time. ”

Beniladi was overjoyed and quickly said,””Thank you! Thank you! Mr. Wang, you’re too generous!”

“I need to know everything about Xia ruofei.” Wang Boshan said and then added,”money is not a problem!”

“Understood!” “I’ll definitely do everything I can to record his whereabouts!” Benilati said in a greedy tone. Mr. Wang, I can give you another piece of information. ”

“Oh? Tell me about it. ” Wang Boshan said.

“Originally, there were still some unfinished projects on the island. In addition, after boss took over the peach source Island, he also made some changes to the island according to his own preferences. However, after he returned from Evarts Island, he had the island’s construction team stop. Everyone is waiting for the news!” Beniladi said.

When Wang Boshan heard this, he felt even more at ease. This is right! Since the island was going to be sold, there was no point in the renovation. Xia ruofei would not waste money.

“Very good!” Wang Boshan said,”benilatti, keep a close eye on Xia ruofei for the next two days. If you find anything useful or abnormal, you can contact me at any time! I won’t shortchange you in terms of price!”

“Alright! Alright!” Benilatti nodded and said,”thank you, Mr. Wang! Thank you, Mr. Wang!”

After hanging up the phone, benilatti immediately looked at Xia ruofei with a flattering expression and asked,””Master, what do you think of my response? There shouldn’t be any problems, right?”

Li Yifu stared at the construction site. Now, there were only Xia ruofei and benilatti in the warehouse, so he consciously changed the way he addressed Xia ruofei to “master.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Not bad! I think you have a talent for acting. You can try the entertainment route in the future!”

Benilatti said awkwardly,””Master, I’m only willing to serve you. I’m not interested in anything else.”

Xia ruofei smiled noncommittally and said,””You can leave first! I’m going to get busy. ”

He knew that bainilatti’s loyalty was completely based on the soul seal. Without the soul seal, with bainilatti’s profit – seeking nature, as long as he was given enough money, he would even sell his ancestral grave. How could there be any loyalty?

……

In the next two days, the island’s transformation was carried out in full swing.

Li Yifu was still monitoring the progress of the project without rest, while Xia ruofei was relatively idle.

In addition to checking if the newly built parts met the requirements of the array, he spent most of his time in the warehouse practicing the Kasaya. Although the possibility of breaking through the shackles of the refinement stage in just a few days was not great, it could improve his cultivation a little. In the upcoming face – to – Face confrontation, the confidence of winning would be greater.

As for benilatti, it followed Xia ruofei’s instructions and took the initiative to report the situation to Wang Boshan.

His report was naturally prepared by Xia ruofei in advance. It was nothing more than frequent contact with the Carnelian politicians and all the workers on leave to be on standby.

In short, it was to create an impression for Wang Boshan. Xia ruofei had already decided not to play and was very active in coordinating various relationships in terms of the agate map to pave the way for the transfer of ownership of the island. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

On the evening of the second day, Xia ruofei sat in the warehouse after dinner and studied a Formation Manual in his mind. Other than cultivation, he would also study some formations manuals from time to time. His goal was to improve his formation skills as much as possible so that he could better control the Taixu xuanqing formation.

Just as Xia ruofei was engrossed in his book, Li Yifu pushed open the door and walked in.

He looked a little Haggard, his hair and beard were not trimmed, and his temperament seemed a little decadent.

However, Xia ruofei could feel Li Yifu’s excitement when he looked up.

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. He smiled and asked,”Foster husband, could it be ... That it’s all finished?”

Li Yifu said somewhat excitedly,”senior granduncle, this disciple was fortunate to have not failed you!” Martial granduncle, please go and inspect it!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t sit still anymore. He stood up and said,””Let’s go and take a look!”

Accompanied by Li Yifu, Xia ruofei quickly went through all the points that he had not checked. He checked all the points according to the construction plan meticulously.

He was still very satisfied with the results. He didn’t find any errors or deviations.

Li Yifu had spent four to five days to perfectly realize Xia ruofei’s construction plan in reality.

“Grand uncle – Master, since all the modifications have been completed, can we ...” Li Yifu asked with anticipation.

Xia ruofei nodded slightly.”Theoretically, yes. However, we still need to verify whether it will work or not ... It’s still a little early now. Come with me and try to activate the array at midnight!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu said excitedly.

Since the modification was complete and the core formation plate was ready, one master and one backup, there was no room for error. Hence, after Xia ruofei was sure that there were no problems with the renovation project, he immediately started to prepare for the midnight array verification ...
