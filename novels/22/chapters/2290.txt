“I will, Grandpa song, don’t worry.” Xia ruofei said,”once we reach the three mountains, I will report to you immediately if anything happens!”

“Alright, keep in touch!” Elder song said.

“Oh, ruofei, what’s the reaction from the Liu family when you’re leaving the capital?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Liu Qunfeng was unwilling. He even said something sour about blaming me. I retorted him!” I said, if the Liu family feels that they’ve suffered a loss, I’ll return the consultation fee in full and the treatment will be over! I’ll treat them as if I’ve given them the treatment for the first week for free!”

Eccentric song couldn’t help but laugh,”Well done! If that’s the case, I don’t need the Liu family’s consultation fee! We’re ready to restart the war with them at any time. After all, we’ve been fighting for so many years and we’ve never suffered any losses! Do you think we’re afraid of him?”

“Grandpa song, the Liu family is just complaining. Now that old man Liu’s treatment is getting better, they won’t dare to give up halfway.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re right! However, even though old Liu is a little cunning, he’s still quite generous. ” Elder song said,”this is probably his son’s personal opinion. That Liu Qunfeng ... He’s still a little narrow – minded ...”

Liu Qunfeng was a high – Level official, but in elder song’s eyes, he was just an ordinary junior. In his eyes, Liu Qunfeng’s future had come to an end. His position determined his height. Compared to song Qiming, elder song was still far behind.

Elder song’s heart clenched at the thought of song Qiming.

Even though song Qiming was not his direct descendant, he had the same feelings as the song family’s direct descendants. In fact, they might even be more than that. In terms of personal development, song Qiming was also full of potential. In the song family, he was only second to his eldest son, song Zhengping, who was working in Hunan Province.

Elder song gave Xia ruofei a few more instructions and hung up the phone.

When Xia ruofei kept his phone, he saw that Song Wei had opened her eyes.

“Did I wake you up?” he said apologetically.

“I didn’t really sleep ...” Song Wei said,”did elder song call you?”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Yes, Grandpa song has received the news. He probably wants me to go back and help with the treatment. He is still very concerned about uncle song!”

In terms of seniority, song Qiming was elder song’s grandnephew, while Song Wei was one generation younger than song Rui. Xia ruofei was song Rui’s brother, so he called elder song “Grandpa song”. In that case, Song Wei was one generation younger than Xia ruofei. However, the two of them were in such a complicated relationship.

Song Wei gently nodded and said,”The old man is indeed very good to my father ...”

Song Wei’s eyes turned red again, perhaps because she thought about how her father was struggling on the line between life and death.

Xia ruofei gently held her hand and said,””Weiwei, don’t worry too much. Grandpa song said that he’ll personally give instructions to the southeast province. We have to at least stabilize uncle song’s vital signs at all costs. As long as he can hold on until we reach the hospital, there’s still room for change ...”

“En!” Song Wei nodded her head.

After a while, the car arrived at the airport. Wu Qiang directly parked the car in front of the private jet building.

Xia ruofei held Song Wei’s hand as they got out of the car. He told Wu Qiang to drive back to the courtyard house. If Qin Yanan and he Yu needed a car, he had to make sure they got one.

Then, Xia ruofei and Song Wei walked into the private jet building.

The two of them had rushed straight to the airport as soon as they received the news. They didn’t even bring their luggage.

The flight crew’s Captain Liu An and Captain Zheng Daming were already waiting at the security checkpoint. With their assistance, the two quickly passed through the security checkpoint.

The group of people quickly went to the tarmac through the internal passage of the private aircraft building.

“Mr. Xia, I was just about to report to you!” Liu An said. “There’s traffic control at the capital Airport today. They said that the Air Force is conducting a small – scale exercise. Many of the airspace that was originally open has been closed today. There are many planes lingering at the airport. Because we cut the queue at the last minute, the take – off time has been delayed again and again ...”

“How did this happen?” Xia ruofei frowned. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Don’t worry, Mr. Xia,” Liu An said hurriedly.”The matter has been resolved!”

“Oh?”

“Just a few minutes ago, the authorities sent us a message. We can take off at any time.” Liu An said,”I don’t know why, but the Air Force gave us the green light and opened up all the airspace to us.”

Xia ruofei was well aware that elder song must have informed the military. That was why the military had reacted so quickly.

Xia ruofei was not a person who enjoyed special privileges. If it were any other time, he would have thought that it was no big deal to wait for a while. However, the situation was urgent. Today’s situation was different. He had to rush back to the three mountains as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I see ... Let’s take off as soon as possible!” Try to speed up as much as possible on the road. Don’t think about economy or fuel consumption, just go as fast as you can!”

“Understood!” Liu An said,”everything is ready. We can set off as soon as we board the plane!”

As they talked, they soon arrived at the tarmac.

The public jet paradise quietly parked on the tarmac. Because the two flight attendants couldn’t make it in time, there were only three people in the crew today. In addition to the two captains, there was also an Air Service mechanic.
