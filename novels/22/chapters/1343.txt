Chapter 1344: Gaining nothing from the White Wolf (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia Ling snorted coldly and was about to flare up on the spot.

At this moment, Tian Xiaojun patted Xia Ling’s shoulder lightly and put on a fake smile as he looked at Xia ruofei.”President Xia, don’t be so cold to me! Business people all paid attention to amiability to make money. Besides ... We’re not here to get something for nothing, we’re here to invest in it!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,””Of course, we have to make money in peace when doing business. That’s why I’ve always opposed forcing people to buy and sell!”

Seeing that Tian Xiaojun had shamelessly said that they did not gain anything for nothing, Xia ruofei was almost speechless at their shamelessness.

Tian Xiaojun’s patience was almost wearing thin. His expression gradually turned cold as he turned to Liu Zhe and said,”Liu Zhe, it seems like your friend isn’t very good!”

Liu Zhe was complaining in his heart. After he entered the room, he wished that he was invisible and that his presence was as low as possible. After all, he did not want to offend either of them. He was just like Zhu Bajie looking into the mirror and looking at himself in disdain!

He wanted to protect himself, but Tian Xiaojun didn’t give him the chance and directly called his name.

Liu Zhe had no choice but to step forward and say,””Tian Chu, brother Xia didn’t say that he wasn’t willing to cooperate. You guys should have a good chat! It’s normal to have differences in opinions, besides ... Even if ...”

Liu Zhe’s voice became softer and softer as he spoke. He did not dare to say things like “even if the deal doesn’t work out, there will still be benevolence”. Otherwise, he could not guarantee that Tian Xiaojun would not fall out with him on the spot.

Tian Xiaojun coldly snorted and asked,”President Xia, the few of us came all the way from Beijing. Are you really not going to leave us any room for negotiation? The most important thing in doing business is to be down – to – Earth. Don’t overestimate yourself and don’t underestimate others ...”

The threat in his words was obvious. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Then tell me! How do you want to invest?”

Since he had nothing to do anyway, he would just take it as a way to tease the boring people by listening to what kind of plans these hotheaded young men could come up with.

Tian Xiaojun was secretly happy when he heard this. He thought that his threat had worked. After all, it was the nature of businessmen to seek advantages and avoid disadvantages. They were usually more afraid of young masters with deep backgrounds like him.

As for Xia ruofei’s nonchalant tone, Tian Xiaojun only thought that the young man was concerned about his reputation and did not want to admit defeat.

Hence, he gave Xia Ling a look.

Xia Ling immediately understood and said,”President Xia, before we came, we did some evaluation of the situation of paradise Corporation. You have a farm and a pharmaceutical factory. The hardware facilities are still passable. We are prepared to invest one million HxB, accounting for 51% of the shares.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

He could guess that these second – generation heirs had a large appetite, but he still didn’t expect them to eat in such an ugly manner.

After the jaded skin cream became popular, the investment community had also evaluated the value of paradise Corporation. The results varied, but basically, they were all going for more than 1 billion. After all, the jaded skin cream’s super money – making ability was there for all to see.

These few wild hotheaded young men really took their director – Level father as a dish. They only gave him a valuation of about two million, and they wanted to eat up 51% of the shares at once.

He wanted absolute control of the company.

As for what happened after that, it was basically obvious.

He wanted to kick Xia ruofei out of the company.

They weren’t the first to do this, and they certainly wouldn’t be the last.

As long as they had the controlling shares, it would be too easy to kick Xia ruofei out. The most direct way was to pass a series of development plans on the Board of Directors with a number of votes and then propose a capital increase.

With their connections, it was easy for them to borrow a large sum of money in the short term.

If Xia ruofei was really a local boss with no background, he would definitely not be able to fork out the money for such a huge capital increase plan.

There could only be one result, and that was that Xia ruofei’s shares were being diluted.

In the end, the peach blossom company, the hen that laid the golden egg, would be devoured alive by this group of people.

If Tian Xiaojun and the others were only here to freeload, Xia ruofei would still have the mentality of teasing them. However, when Xia Ling mentioned this extremely outrageous so – called financing plan, Xia ruofei’s face turned cold.

“Are you joking with me?” he asked, his eyes narrowed.

Xia Ling said casually,”how could I be joking!” Investment is a very serious matter, we have hired a professional company to evaluate it, the investment of peach blossom company may be slightly more than two million, but the machinery Equipment and your vegetable greenhouse have been depreciating, so we are offering one million for 51% of the shares, which is a very fair price. ”

Xia ruofei pouted and asked,”do you know how much Shanshan capital values us?” 1.3 billion! The two million you said is not even a fraction of the amount they gave! I’m not even interested in financing this!”

Xia Ling said disdainfully,”those capital institutions are just hyping up the concept. This kind of valuation is almost as high as outer space. You actually believe it?”

Xia ruofei was so angry that he almost laughed. He didn’t believe in the valuation of a professional investment bank but believed in a few Rascals who wanted to swallow a rising star company with their empty words?

Ling Qingxue had been sitting quietly beside Xia ruofei. She didn’t want to say anything at first, but after hearing Xia Ling and the others ‘shameless remarks, she couldn’t hold it in.

She stood up and said,”the Paradise Corporation has just acquired the balance power building in the center of Sanshan city with cash. The assets of this building alone are worth hundreds of millions. You’re a little too whimsical to offer one million to take 51% of the shares!”

Tian Xiaojun had noticed Ling Qingxue a long time ago. After all, she was a beautiful woman with a pair of long legs. It was hard for any man to ignore her existence.

Perhaps he wanted to show off in front of the beautiful woman, but at the same time, he didn’t want to continue discussing the issue of assets. It was obvious that they were getting something for nothing, and that excuse wouldn’t stand up to scrutiny at all.

Therefore, Tian Xiaojun cleared his throat and said,”President Xia, this beautiful lady, I think your understanding of assets might be a little off.”

“Oh? Then, can Deputy Director Tian give me some advice?” Xia ruofei said sarcastically.

Tian Xiaojun smiled.”You’re still young. It’s understandable that you don’t know much about the business world. I’m willing to share my opinion with you.”

Tian Xiaojun’s greedy eyes fell on Ling Qingxue’s face as he continued,”Xia Ling took out one million in cash and wanted to take 51% of the shares. It might seem unreasonable, but please don’t ignore the intangible assets. I think that this is the important bargaining chip for us to become a shareholder! “Cooperating with us means that the Paradise Corporation will have resources that you can’t imagine. Its expansion will be ten times, or even a hundred times larger than it is now. In the process of expansion, we will be responsible for solving all problems, big and small. Aren’t these worth 51% of the shares?”

Tian Xiaojun paused, then glanced at Xia ruofei and said,”President Xia, working with us means that paradise Corporation will be on a smooth path from now on. On the other hand, I think a smart person like President Xia should be aware of the consequences.”

Xia ruofei finally couldn’t help but laugh. He looked at Tian Xiaojun and asked,”Is Deputy Director Tian threatening me?”

Tian Xiaojun confidently pointed at Xia Ling and Zhong Zixin and said,”Xiao Ling’s father is the leader of the price administration. I think uncle Xia has a say in whether your company’s jaded skin cream is suspected of false pricing or malicious speculation. The elders in Zixin’s family are the leaders of the important departments in the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. They only need to say a word, and no one in your most important e – commerce channels will dare to sell your products. In addition, we have many friends in other ministries. It can be said that any unit can decide the life and death of the Paradise company with a word!”

Tian Xiaojun deliberately said this unhurriedly, thinking that he had scored full marks in his acting. He could not help but glance at Ling Qingxue proudly, then said to Xia ruofei, “That’s why I’m only stating the facts. As for whether it’s a threat or not, it’s up to you to decide ...”
