Chapter 446: The big banquet (2)

Other than salary, the company also offered various benefits such as insurance, overtime allowance, and so on. Cao tieshu and the rest walked around the village with their heads held high. They all felt proud and the villagers were quite envious of them.

Now that the company was recruiting again, Cao tieshu and the others wanted to quickly send the news back to Yingluo. Everyone was a local, so who didn‚Äôt have relatives or friends? This was inside information! If one‚Äôs relatives and friends could be one step ahead of others, they might have the upper hand.

The construction workers who attended the ribbon ‚Äì cutting ceremony with them were very envious of Yingluo and the others who worked on the construction site. They were dirty and tired. Many of them were not even treated as well as the farm workers!

Xia ruofei‚Äôs speech wasn‚Äôt long, and it was time to cut the ribbon.

Originally, Xia ruofei had arranged for Wu Liqian, Liang Weimin, Ling Xiaotian, President Zheng, and himself to be there for a total of five people.

Now, with the addition of Feng Yun and Zhou Qing, the ribbon ‚Äì cutting guests had become seven people.

Fortunately, the company in charge of the ceremony had also prepared spare Golden Scissors, plates, and so on. They had just lengthened the red silk cloth temporarily and made two more silk flowers. Then, they had also pulled the two girls in charge of welcoming guests over to act as etiquette ladies.

Xia ruofei and the others cut the red silk at the same time. The red silk was divided into several sections. On each tray was an auspicious red silk flower. Then, Lei Hu and the others below the stage divided the work according to their division of labor. Some twisted open the flower, and some went to the other side of the square to light firecrackers.

The ribbon ‚Äì cutting ceremony was completed in a lively manner.

After that, the workers who were ‚Äòthere‚Äô to make up the numbers were dismissed. The guests, accompanied by Xia ruofei, began to tour the complex.

The first floor of the building was mainly used for security, surveillance, canteen, storage, and some administrative office.

The second floor was mainly office space, including the chairman‚Äôs office, the Finance Office, and other important places.

This building was quite different from the office buildings in the city. It took up a large area and each floor was spacious. Xia ruofei was used to being the boss, so he didn‚Äôt waste time setting up an entire floor of super ‚Äì Large offices here.

The third to sixth floors were all dormitory rooms. There were single apartments, two ‚Äì bedroom apartments, and spare rooms.

There were a total of five suites used as guest houses, ten two ‚Äì bedroom apartments, and more than 30 single apartments.

It was enough for the current Peach Blossom Farm.

As for the company‚Äôs future development, it didn‚Äôt matter. The company‚Äôs headquarters definitely wouldn‚Äôt be in this remote countryside for a long time. Now that paradise corporation‚Äôs reputation was growing, in the future, it was necessary to set up human resources, administrative logistics, finance, and other departments. The company‚Äôs headquarters would definitely be moved to the office building in the city.

Otherwise, it would not fit the image of a big company!

This place was mainly in charge of the operation of the farm base, so these employee apartments were definitely enough.

Besides, Xia ruofei only needed to ensure that the first few batches of employees had rooms to live in. If the new recruits did not have rooms, then so be it. There would only be incentives if there was a difference.

Xia ruofei had helped Liang Weimin a lot last time, so he put in a lot of effort into this project. Not only did he ask manager li to keep an eye on the project, but he also came a few times to supervise the progress.

It could be said that Liang Weimin didn‚Äôt earn a single cent from this project. If the same cost was based on the market price, it could only build four to five floors at most.

Moreover, the interior decoration was all made of high ‚Äì Quality materials with a good price ‚Äì Performance ratio. They were environmentally friendly, durable, and did not waste money.

Everyone looked around, and those who knew the ropes were secretly amazed.

Even those who didn‚Äôt know much about the farm were all exclaiming that the benefits of the farm‚Äôs employees were too good. The conditions were too comfortable.

In fact, Xia ruofei‚Äôs Taoyuan farm was different from ordinary farms. The cost of raw materials was similar to that of ordinary farms, and they did not use chemical fertilizers. The cost expenditure was very low, and the price of the agricultural products was several times or even dozens of times the market price. It made a huge profit.

That was why Xia ruofei did not mind giving his employees a higher salary and benefits. He felt that it was worth it to use this limited effort to exchange for the loyalty of his employees. He was not being a fool.

Even if the price of the land was slightly more expensive than the market price, Xia ruofei did not hesitate to decide on the rental of land in Dongkeng village.

If the other farms were to spend as extravagantly as Xia ruofei, they would close down at any moment.

After the tour, Xia ruofei led the guests to the newly built staff cafeteria. T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

In China, when people came to support you, as the host, you naturally had to treat them well. At least, you would get to eat.

Naturally, Xia ruofei could not travel alone.

All the facilities in the staff canteen were brand new. Although they had not hired a chef yet, Xia ruofei had a future father ‚Äì in ‚Äì Law who was a food and beverage chain magnate. Naturally, it would not be a problem for him to hire a chef.

The executive chef of Ling Ji F & B personally led a few chefs to the canteen to prepare a sumptuous lunch.

The majority of the ingredients used were vegetables, fruits, and fruits produced by Tao Yuan farm. The meat ingredients were also top ‚Äì grade products that Ling Xiaotian had arranged for someone to purchase from the supplier of Ling Ji food and beverage.

Cao tieshu‚Äôs heart ached for Xia ruofei to use so many Taoyuan vegetables to entertain his guests. He was the most aware of the value of these Taoyuan vegetables. Seeing Lei Hu and the rest move boxes of fresh vegetables from the greenhouse to the canteen, Cao tieshu‚Äôs heart trembled. If these vegetables were to be sold, they would be worth at least a few thousand or even ten to twenty thousand HxB!

Naturally, Xia ruofei did not feel the pinch. Not only did he use Taoyuan vegetables, but even the wine for the luncheon was all aged Drunken Eight Immortals from Xia ruofei‚Äôs interspace.

The customers naturally enjoyed the meal, especially those who loved to drink. They couldn‚Äôt stop praising the improved Drunken Eight Immortals.

Ling Xiaotian did not miss the opportunity to promote the new winery that they had acquired.

After learning that the white wine at the luncheon, which was not inferior to the Maotai Wuliangye, would be on the market in more than half a month, the guests were all very interested and began to chat with Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei.

Song Rui was envious of Xia ruofei when he saw that Xia ruofei was doing well.

Xia ruofei was two years younger than him, but his career was already doing well. On the other hand, he had to study in his family‚Äôs company and face all kinds of restrictions.

The children of the big families looked bright on the outside, but only they knew what they felt in their hearts.

Xia ruofei‚Äôs company wasn‚Äôt big, but the sense of freedom and success from starting a business was enough to make song Rui envious.

As song Rui‚Äôs identity was special, Xia ruofei did not introduce him to the guests in detail. Therefore, Wu Liqian was still the core of the lunch.

Song Rui was naturally not unhappy about this. He was a person who advocated freedom, which could be seen from his desire to escape from marriage and go abroad. Therefore, he did not like such social events.

Besides, this was his good friend Xia ruofei‚Äôs luncheon. He would not put on airs in front of Xia ruofei.

Song Rui obviously didn‚Äôt recognize Wu Liqian, who he had met once a few years ago.

Wu Liqian knew the rules, so she didn‚Äôt talk to song Rui rashly. She just toasted him a few more times.

The luncheon ended successfully in an atmosphere of joy, and the guests took their leave.

As the host, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue shook hands and bid farewell to each and every one of them in the small square of the complex.

Ling Qingxue had gradually gotten into the role of the female host and did not leave with her father. She and Xia ruofei had not been together for a few days. Now that she had a valid reason, she naturally had to stay to relieve her longing.

To Xia ruofei‚Äôs surprise, Wu Liqian was not in a hurry to leave.

After all the guests had left, Wu Liqian walked up to Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue. She smiled and said,‚Äù‚ÄùLittle Xia, congratulations again! His business is getting bigger and bigger. ‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, sis Wu.‚Äù Xia ruofei smiled.

Since the outsiders had left, Xia ruofei naturally wouldn‚Äôt address Wu Liqian as ‚ÄúMayor Wu‚Äù in all seriousness.

Ling Qingxue held onto Xia ruofei‚Äôs arm, looked at Wu Liqian and asked,‚Äù‚ÄùSince County Head Wu stayed behind, he should have some other instructions, right?‚Äù

Wu Liqian could feel the slight hostility from Ling Qingxue, but she did not mind. She looked at the paper box that Ling Qingxue had been holding in her hand and said,‚Äù‚ÄùI wouldn‚Äôt dare call it an instruction. I‚Äôm just interested in the inscription elder song wrote for Xiao Xia, so I presumptuously stayed to have a good look.‚Äù

Then, Wu Liqian glanced at Xia ruofei and asked,‚Äù‚ÄùXiao Xia, I don‚Äôt know if this request of mine is a little abrupt?‚Äù
