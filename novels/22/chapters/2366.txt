2367 Viper captured (2)

Therefore, he avoided all the sentries and surveillance cameras on the way and successfully sneaked up to Boak.

Xia ruofei was already hiding behind the trees before Boak received the call from Satan. He heard the conversation between Boak and Satan clearly.

It was not until he was about to leave the garden that Xia ruofei found a pistol with a silencer from the pile of firearms in his storage space. He held the gun in his hand and walked out of his hiding place. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I’ve long heard of your great name, Mr. Viper!” Xia ruofei smiled and said in English,”please don’t try to escape or call for help. I don’t think you can be faster than a bullet, so don’t joke around with your life.”

The expression on Beaulac’s face darkened. He stared at Xia ruofei’s face that had been changed and asked in a deep voice,””Who are you?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s not important, Mr. Viper.” As long as you cooperate, I can guarantee your safety. ”

The gears in his head turned rapidly as he tried to think of a way to escape.

What made him a little depressed was that, according to the current situation, the possibility of him escaping from the current situation was very low. What was more terrifying was that this back garden was where he and his girlfriends had fun, and it was his “private land.” The guards in charge of the manor’s security would not go near this area.

After all, from their point of view, the defense of the entire Manor was already impregnable, and the back garden was almost the core of the manor. The possibility of danger in the back garden was close to zero. Therefore, there was no need to make the boss unhappy for the sake of so – called safety.

In the first place, Boak did not care much about this matter. Now, he had a taste of the bitter fruit. He was trapped in the back garden with a gun pointed at him. No one could help him.

He decided to calm the young man down first. He tried to sound calm and steady as he said,””No problem! I’ll definitely cooperate! Please speak! What do you need me to do?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s simple. Look at my eyes first ...”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished his words, he subconsciously looked at Xia ruofei’s sharp eyes.

“Very good ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, his spiritual power gushed out from his psyche ocean and swept towards beac.

In less than a second, Beaulac managed to hold on.

Or more precisely, Boak’s subconscious resistance only lasted for less than a second.

Then, he fell into a state of confusion that came after a deep hypnosis.

Xia ruofei didn’t question Boak right away. Instead, he teleported the hypnotized Boak into his space and threw him into an independent space cage.

Then, Xia ruofei immediately sneaked away and easily dodged the patrolling guards. At the same time, he carefully avoided the cameras and nimbly dodged in the blind spots of the surveillance cameras. In a short while, he had sneaked out of the manor’s vicinity without anyone noticing.

The reason why Xia ruofei didn’t clean up the place like he did in the training camp in Basoko town was to save time and find out Satan’s whereabouts from Boak as soon as possible.

After all, Satan already knew about the explosion at the training camp, and had sent Boak to investigate. If there was another incident where all the people in the Boak Manor went missing, it would surely alert Satan.

The news of the capture of Boak alone would probably be kept a secret for a longer time, because the other people in the manor would not dare to speculate about Boak’s whereabouts. In addition, Satan had sent Boak to Basoko town, so all these could interfere with Satan’s judgment.

Of course, there was another important reason.

The people in the manor were different from the mercenaries in the barsoco training camp. Most of them were servants hired by Boak, including his women. Even if they were at fault, they wouldn’t be imprisoned for life.

Xia ruofei could not bring himself to bring innocent people into the medium to work for the rest of their lives.

After leaving the manor, Xia ruofei quickly found the pickup he had hidden.

He drove away from the manor without any hesitation.

After driving for tens of kilometers, Xia ruofei found a hidden place and stopped the car.

He then jumped off the car and walked into the woods. He used his psychic power to check around and made sure that no one was spying on him. After that, he teleported boack out of the cage.

Out of thin air, beak appeared in the bushes and fell to the ground.

At that moment, Boak’s brain almost lost the ability to think. What he had just experienced was too bizarre.

A second ago, he had been blocked by a gun in the back garden of the manor, and then he seemed to have suddenly lost consciousness.

After he was transferred to the space cage and locked up alone, he slowly recovered as Xia ruofei stopped using his spiritual power to maintain the hypnotism.

The space cage that was surrounded by mysterious mist and there was nothing in it, but he couldn’t get out of it.

He had tried many methods, but none of them worked.

As the second – in – command of the Morde organization, it was the first time that he felt as helpless as a child.

Just as he was at a loss, he suddenly felt the world spin around him, and an invisible force was pulling him.

He felt dizzy and when he recovered, he realized that he was in a different environment.

This time, it was no longer the monotonous endless Gray – White color, but a forest.

Although he was only locked up for half an hour, he felt like crying when he saw the green leaves and the blue sky.

Of course, he quickly noticed Xia ruofei who was standing in front of him.

The gun with a silencer was still in Xia ruofei’s hand, and the muzzle was aimed at Boak’s head. Xia ruofei still had a teasing smile on his face.

“Sir, do you want ...” Said boack anxiously.

He was only halfway through his sentence when the mental pressure that was etched in his heart attacked him again. He was completely unable to resist and fell into a state of hypnosis again.

Xia ruofei didn’t want to waste time with Boak. He asked directly,””Tell me Satan’s true identity and hiding place!”

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, when he asked the question, Boak’s face showed a hint of struggle. However, the pressure of mental strength was too strong. He only hesitated for a moment but quickly answered.

When Xia ruofei heard the answer, he could not help but raise his eyebrows and look very surprised.

However, he didn’t doubt the authenticity of Boak’s answer, so he nodded and kept the important information in mind.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take another look at Boak. He was also trying to guess the relationship between him and Satan.

After all, under the pressure of powerful mental strength and hypnosis, there was still a subconscious level of resistance when he wanted to reveal Satan’s information. Fortunately, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was strong enough. The subconscious defense of Boak only lasted for a moment before it fell apart.

This moment of hesitation was already beyond Xia ruofei’s expectations. This was also the first time that Xia ruofei’s tried – and – tested spiritual hypnosis had met with a small accident.

Xia ruofei asked the second question,””Not long ago, the modr organization sent an assassin to assassinate an official of Huaxia, song Qiming. I need to know the details of the person who placed the order.”
