She had really wronged Xia ruofei. It was not that Xia ruofei’s hearing was bad, but that he would not always pay attention to the situation behind him. Of course, if there was any danger, Xia ruofei would still be able to sense it at the first moment.

However, this time, Xia ruofei only made the judgment based on the expressions of Feng Jing and the others.

At this time, Ling Qingxue also walked over with a smile, and the store manager quickly greeted her.

Ling Qingxue nodded slightly. He still had the authority of a leader.

However, when she turned to Feng Rao, her smile bloomed.””President Feng! What a rare guest!”

Feng Rao also smiled and said,”Qingxue, your Ling Ji private kitchen is too high – end. I can’t afford to eat it normally. If it wasn’t for the Chairman’s treat today, we wouldn’t have dared to come!”

“Oh right, let me introduce you. This is our new executive director, Dong Yun!” Feng Jing added.

“Nice to meet you, President Dong!” Ling Qingxue smiled and extended her hand towards Dong Yun.

Dong Yun shook Ling Qingxue’s hand and said,””Hello, President Ling!”

After the small talk, Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei. He did not know if it was because of Song Wei’s incident that made Xia ruofei feel guilty, but he felt that Ling Qingxue’s eyes were filled with resentment, as if she was saying that he had bad intentions by recruiting beautiful subordinates ...

I swear to God, CEO Feng has his eyes on Dong Yun, I can’t take the blame for this! Xia ruofei said in his heart.

Of course, Ling Qingxue only glanced at Xia ruofei and smiled.””Chief Feng, chief Dong, you two can go to the flying Snow Pavilion with RUO Fei first! I still have something to do at the private restaurant, so I’ll go and propose a few toasts to you guys later!”

“Alright! But we can go over by ourselves, let President Xia accompany you!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Then, the two of them really left Xia ruofei behind and followed the waiter to the backyard. Ling Qingxue did not stop them.

Xia ruofei watched as Feng Rao and Xia RUO walked away and asked in a low voice,””Qingxue, why did you come over today?”

“This question ... Can’t I just come and inspect the company’s property?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Don’t tell me he wants to eat ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, so he’s using the excuse of inspection ...” Xia ruofei said with an evil smile.

“You’re thinking too much!” Ling Qingxue replied,”we’re in the middle of a meal business! I want to see how the private restaurant is doing, so it’s better for me to come here before mealtime!”

“You, on the other hand, have another beautiful subordinate,” Ling Qingxue said.”You can have women on your left and right now ...”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”President Dong was hired by President Feng, it has nothing to do with me!” We went to see the headquarters building today and it was almost noon when we left. We’re just here for a free meal. ”

The priceless ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ secret recipe had been provided by Xia ruofei. Furthermore, he was the son – in – Law of Ling Ji restaurant. Naturally, it was free for him to come over for a meal. It was not wrong to say that he was freeloading.

“You’re preparing to move your headquarters?” Ling Qingxue asked with interest.

“Yup! Everything is ready, we just need to pick a day to move in!” Xia ruofei said.

“Then you’ll be working in the city from now on. We’re close by ...” Ling Qingxue said happily.”Oh right, there’s a villa for sale in our neighborhood. Why don’t you just buy it? otherwise, you’ll have to go back to the farm after work. How troublesome!”

“Do you think I’m the kind of person who spends all day in the office from nine to five?” Xia ruofei asked with a strange expression.

Ling Qingxue was at a loss for words. After a while, she said,””This is the first time I’ve seen someone talk about slacking off so righteously, fresh, and refined ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

Then, he looked at the manager of the private restaurant, who was standing far away with an uneasy expression, and said,””Go and do your things first! Let’s talk about it later ... President Feng and the others are our guests, it’s not good to ignore them. I’ll go to the flying Snow Pavilion to greet them ...”

Ling Qingxue quickly pulled Xia ruofei and said,””Wait! I still have something to ask you!”

Then, she looked around and asked in a low voice,””Ruofei, how are the preparations for cultivation coming along?”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
