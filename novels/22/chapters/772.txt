Chapter 773: Revealing its true form (2)

The police soon found the house of the man named Liu Jun, who had just been released from prison. His wife said that Liu Jun had not returned home for two days. The day before he left home, he was very happy, saying that he had a big business deal and would come back to buy new clothes for the mother and son. However, he had not returned since.

Xia ruofei sighed and said,”needless to say, Liu Jun has most likely been killed.” I’ll pay more attention to nameless’s corpse these two days ...”

Deputy bureau chief Lu also nodded in agreement.

The results of the portrait recognition were soon released. The driver yesterday was Liu Jun, who had just been released from prison. There was another person sitting in the front passenger seat. The police did not find anything after comparing a large amount of data.

However, the military intelligence Department had made new progress.

After they received the screenshots sent by the secret network, they quickly compared them with their internal database.

In the end, he received an unexpected surprise. The ordinary – looking middle – aged man in the co – Pilot seat was confirmed to be kappei Yamai, a member of the Kano group, an elite spy organization under the intelligence Department of the Ministry of National Defense.

Such information naturally could not be found in the police database. The military had its own source of intelligence, and many members of the spy organization were actually registered in the database.

Guo Zhan’s face turned ashen as he slammed his fist on the table and said,””It’s indeed those damn Japanese! I’m going to pull out this group of bastards one by one and skin them alive!”

Guo Zhan’s grandfather was a hero who had participated in the eight years of the war, and his hatred for the Wei nation had become an instinct in his blood.

This time, the old hatred had not yet been settled, but a new hatred had been added. Squad leader Luo had been sacrificed under the muzzle of the Wei nation agents, and Guo Zhan’s heart had long been filled with anger.

“Well, since Kappei Yamaguchi has already been registered in the military intelligence database, he’ll be targeted the moment he enters the country!” Tian Feilong frowned and said. But we didn’t receive any news at all!”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”these people are not stupid. They know that their identity might have been exposed a long time ago. So, I’m sure that they smuggled themselves in. They couldn’t have left any entry records.”

......

Guo Zhan also gradually calmed down and nodded, “That’s right, and they might have planned their escape route from the beginning. Now it seems that the possibility of these Japanese escaping by sea is higher!”

The police had also sent out a small team to continue the inspection and verification work of the vehicles.

After an intense investigation, the suspicions of the cars were ruled out one by one, and only two cars were left.

The two cars had one thing in common, which was that they had been parked in two different surveillance blind spots on the van’s route for a long time.

After the cargo truck passed by, two cars appeared at the intersection in different directions.

Moreover, the cargo van would stay in the two blind spots for about half a minute. As long as the speed of the vehicle changed slightly, it could completely change the car.

What was more coincidental was that the two cars had disappeared. The police searched the area where the cars had disappeared, but they couldn’t find any traces of the two cars. It was obvious that someone had deliberately hidden them.

If they had found a blind spot in the surveillance and parked the car in a garage or a shop, the police wouldn’t have been able to find it in a short time.

Xia ruofei looked at the two red lines on the big screen and pondered.

There were also two screens next to the driving track, which were playing the surveillance images of the two cars in a loop. They were automatically pieced together by the Skynet system according to the images taken by each camera.

The two cars had different destinations and routes, but the general direction was the same. They were both driving in the direction of Changping County, which was by the sea.

“It seems like I’m not wrong. They most likely chose to escape by sea!” Guo Zhan said with a frown.

“Mm! The possibility is extremely high. ” Xia ruofei said with a serious expression.

“This doesn’t make sense!” Guo Zhan shook his head. After the incident that day, the first thing we did was to coordinate with the relevant military departments and set up surveillance at all the exits. These two cars have left the city area ...”

Xia ruofei frowned and stared at the two cars on the screen.

One of them was a black Honda sedan, and the last place it disappeared was near Gaoqiao Town in Changping County.

The other car was a blue Buick minivan. The Skynet system had tracked it to the vicinity of Lin Gang Town and then disappeared.

This location was not far from Xia ruofei’s Taoyuan farm.

Xia ruofei’s eyes fell on the blue Buick minivan. In the surveillance footage, the car was passing by a flooded area.

“Pause the image on the right!” Xia ruofei suddenly called out.

The police officer in charge of technical support immediately pressed the mouse and paused the scene. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“RUO Fei, did you find anything?” Guo Zhan asked with concern.

Xia ruofei frowned and pointed at the Buick minivan on the screen.””Don’t you think there’s something strange about this car? It seems to be particularly heavy. Let’s go back and look at the image of the road with puddles of water and compare it with the car next to it ...”

The police immediately operated the computer to rewind the surveillance footage and continue playing it.

Sure enough, compared to the other cars, this van seemed to be particularly heavy. When it passed the waterhole, it clearly fell heavily.

In front of this car, there was even a business car of the same model that passed by, but it seemed very light.
