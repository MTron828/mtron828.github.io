3086 A freak combination of factors (2)

Actually, Xia ruofei’s flying ship was not a black – armored flying ship. He did not even know the name of the Flying Ship! However, it was personally refined by scholar Yuntai and had not been circulated. When the ancient cultivation world still existed, it had already been sealed in the nested space of the storage ring. Naturally, it would not be obtained by Daoist Chi Yun of the star picking sect.

As for Daoist Chi Yun, he naturally had nothing to do with Xia ruofei.

A few days ago, after Xia ruofei suspected that someone was following him, he deliberately took out the black flying boat. In fact, he only had two purposes. One was to get rid of the stalker as soon as possible. The second was to hope that the stalker would be able to confirm the rumor of a hidden master behind him after seeing the flying boat.

He could never have imagined that there was really an expert with a great background, whose signature flying magical equipment was a black flying boat.

And this expert just so happened to be a senior of the star Seizer sect.

With so many coincidences, it would be hard for Chen Nanfeng not to be misled!

At this moment, Chen Nanfeng had already considered Xia ruofei as Daoist Chi Yun’s disciple. Although he was not completely sure, he was at least 70% to 80% sure.

Chen Nanfeng furrowed his brows and muttered to himself,””Xia ruofei must have come into contact with the five Saints token before. It’s definitely not the one that appeared at the auction, nor is it the one that our sect has always held. I can sense the remaining aura of the five Saints token on his body. Even though it’s very, very weak, my senses can’t be wrong ... I’ve also seen the five Saints tokens in soaring Flower Valley and surging waves sect. I suspect that the five Saints token that Xia ruofei came into contact with is the number one token that has never been born. It’s just that the aura left behind is too weak. I can’t be completely sure!”

If Xia ruofei was here, he would break out in a cold sweat upon hearing this. Xuanji’s five Saints badge was stored in the spirit map space, so Chen Nanfeng definitely could not sense it. However, he had only broken the barrier and studied the five Saints badge for a short while, and Chen Nanfeng could actually sense a trace of the five Saints badge’s aura on him!

The Man in Black asked in confusion,””Sect leader, if that’s the case ... Why didn’t you ask him directly that day? why didn’t you just give up after a round of probing?”

Chen Nanfeng smiled and said,”if I ask him directly, he probably won’t tell me the truth. I might even alert him. He might be worried that I’ll harm him.” Moreover, there was only a trace of aura left on his body. Even if he had touched the token, he would definitely not have brought it with him. Furthermore, although we were unable to confirm his identity at the time, there were already rumors that he had a Yuanying stage expert behind him. Could it be that we would take the risk to force him to stay?”

“Then did you discover anything when he was studying our five Saints token?” The Man in Black could not help but ask.

Chen Nanfeng shook his head and said,”no, he’s acting very normal. However, I feel that it’s too normal! This was rather abnormal. In addition, although he had expressed his curiosity about the five Holy badges that day in the meeting hall and had studied them very seriously, I still felt that he didn’t seem to be particularly interested. Of course, this is just a feeling. ”

“Anyway, I feel that Xia ruofei’s understanding of the five Holy badges is much deeper than what he’s showing!” Chen Nanfeng continued.

The Man in Black said,”that’s a pity ... You should’ve asked him to stay a few more days that day!” Maybe we can find some clues!”

Chen Nanfeng smiled and shook his head.””Ning, this Xia ruofei is a very cautious person. He’s staying in the first heaven society and I’m a late – Stage golden core cultivator. He definitely won’t show any abnormalities. There’s no point in keeping him here ...”

After saying that, Chen Nanfeng couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile and said,””Actually, I don’t have any ill intentions towards him. We know too little about the five Holy badges. However, I’ve always had a sense of urgency that I have to solve the secret of the five Holy badges as soon as possible. Otherwise, it’s very likely that all my efforts will be in vain ... That’s why I’m a little impatient. He must have felt that something was amiss that day. We’ve tested him, and he’s also testing us, right?”

The Man in Black lowered his head slightly and said,””Sect master, why don’t ... I go to the star Seizer sect and keep an eye on them? We might be able to find out more information. ”

“No need!” Chen Nanfeng waved his hand and said. If Xia ruofei was really senior Chi Yun’s successor, then it was extremely likely that the five Saints token was in senior Chi Yun’s hands. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had only seen this five Saints token at his teacher’s place. That was why the remaining aura of the five Saints token on his body was so weak. Do you think that you can obtain this five Saints badge from a senior at the primordial soul Stage or even higher?” “Your subordinate naturally can’t do that!” The black – clothed man lowered his head and replied.

Chen Nanfeng chuckled.”Of course, there’s another possibility. Our guesses are all wrong. This Xia ruofei only obtained a great opportunity. That’s why he has so many treasures and pill recipes. Moreover, his cultivation has reached the early – Stage golden elixir realm in just three years! If that’s the case, then this Xia ruofei might have many tricks that you and I can’t even imagine. So even if you keep an eye on the star Seizer sect, there’s a high chance that you’ll find nothing!”

The Man in Black nodded and said,””Your subordinate understands.”

“Of course not.” Chen Nanfeng smiled and said,”actually, the possibility of this is very small. I’m even more certain of my judgment now. Think about it, if this Xia ruofei really had everything he had today because of a great opportunity, then why would Luo Qingfeng of the star Seizer sect bow down to him? Luo Qingfeng, you’re an early – Stage golden core cultivator and the leader of a sect. Xia ruofei’s cultivation level is similar to his, so there’s no reason for Luo Qingfeng to lower himself!”

“Yes! This subordinate also feels that sect leader’s judgment is very likely to be the truth. ” The Man in Black said,”sect master, our investigation on him this time, will it ...”

“He’s probably already found out,” Chen Nanfeng said indifferently.”But we don’t have any ill intentions towards him, so there’s no need to worry too much.” “No need!” Chen Nanfeng waved his hand and said. If Xia ruofei was really senior Chi Yun’s successor, then it was extremely likely that the five Saints token was in senior Chi Yun’s hands. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had only seen this five Saints token at his teacher’s place. That was why the remaining aura of the five Saints token on his body was so weak.
