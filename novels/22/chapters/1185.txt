Chapter 1186: Jaded skin ointment press conference (2)

Translator: 549690339

Duff was considered an a – list celebrity internationally, and she just happened to be filming in China recently, so her exposure was much higher than before. So when Feng Jing mentioned her name, it also caused a wave of exclamations.

The audience, who had initially thought otherwise, began to waver in their conclusions. This was the effect of a star.

The screen slowly dimmed as Feng Jing walked to the side of the stage.

At this time, the short video officially began to play. As soon as it came out, it showed the beautiful scene of a small bridge and flowing water, green mountains and gurgling mountain springs. The background music used a guzheng and a Xiao. In such a scene, the ethereal feeling of the Xiao and the melodious feeling of the guzheng complemented each other.

Then, the scene changed. A white – robed Duff was walking barefooted in a stream. As the stream rose, a peach tree fluttered down. Amid the fluttering petals, Duff looked like a flower Fairy as she slowly entered the painting.

Following that, there were scenes of Duff occasionally stopping by the stream to pick one or two herbs.

Then, the camera turned to a thatched cottage by the water. Duff, who was dressed in white, crushed the herbs into a mortar, ground them, and then boiled them.

In the end, Duff was holding a small bowl with the completed jaded skin ointment in it.

She carefully applied the ointment on her face, and then a fast – forwarded scene appeared on the screen. The shaking of the grass and the flow of the stream became several times faster than normal. The rustling was telling the audience the passage of time in the language of the camera.

In the last scene, Duff appeared by the stream. She washed the ointment off her face with the water and raised her head slightly to face the sun. Her cheeks were crystal clear like cream. Under the sunlight, they seemed to be shrouded in a layer of Holy brilliance.

Duff lowered her head and admired her beautiful face in the reflection of the stream. An extremely pure smile appeared on her face.

At this time, the scene gradually darkened, and the music gradually faded away.

The entire short video ended.

The entire audience, guests, and reporters seemed to be immersed in the beautiful scene. For a short moment, the entire venue was very quiet, followed by a burst of warm applause.

The short film was shot beautifully. Whether it was the graphics, special effects, or camera handling, they were all at the level of a master. They were exquisite, beautiful, and fascinating.

From the beginning to the end, Duff didn’t say a single line, and the short film didn’t have any words about jaded skin cream, but she used the way of telling stories to highlight the two most important features of jaded skin cream: pure, natural, and effective.

It could be said that this video, from the conception to the shooting to the post – production, was full of ingenuity.

If one didn’t know that this was an advertisement, they would think that it was a trailer for a Xianxia movie.

Feng Jing was very satisfied with the first publicity video she released.

She didn’t know that the video had not only shocked the audience, but also attracted a lot of attention on the internet.

Xia ruofei had specifically instructed that the conference had to be broadcast live on the main online video and live streaming platforms.

Although paradise corporation’s reputation wasn’t loud enough, the traffic on these well – known online platforms and live streaming platforms was amazing. Banner’s launch conference advertisement was placed in an eye – catching position on the front page, and it was also hung on so many websites at the same time, so it naturally attracted netizens to click on it.

And before the press conference began, there were so many e – commerce big shots appearing at the same time, which increased the interest of many netizens. Some even called their friends over to watch Yingying, especially entrepreneurs like Liu Dong, who had his own internet popularity attribute. His own appeal was also very great.

As soon as the video was played, the surveillance back – end of major video websites discovered that the traffic of peach blossom company’s press conference had increased greatly.

On a well – known bullet screen website, the live broadcast window was instantly covered with bullet comments.

“This video is too awesome!”

“666666”

“Doff is my goddess ...”

“I’ve become a fan of Daphne!”

“I’m suddenly very interested in this jaded skin cream!”

“Paradise Corporation. I’ll remember this name today!”

“I couldn’t help but drag the progress back to take a look again. I was told that I wasn’t alone!”

“You’re not alone!”

“You’re not alone +1 ”

“You’re not alone +2 ”

......

At the Beijing University of Technology’s Stadium, Feng Jing walked back to the stage with confidence.

She smiled and said,”as everyone knows, miss Dave is currently filming in China. Today, we are very fortunate to have invited miss Dave to the press conference!” In order to attend today’s press conference, she specially asked for leave from the production team. On behalf of paradise Corporation, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to miss Daphne! Now, let us welcome miss Duff with a round of applause!”

Duff had been waiting backstage the whole time. Other than Xia ruofei and the rest of the company’s team, no one knew that Duff was there as well. It was another big surprise.

The audience couldn’t help but cheer and clap. Even Huang Yu and the other professional players couldn’t help but applaud.

Huang Yu clapped and said,””Today’s press conference is worth the price. Even if there aren’t any gifts, it’s worth it to be able to see Duff in person!”

“You didn’t spend any money at all, okay?” one of the forum members said mercilessly.

“You don’t need to pay for a taxi? The subway doesn’t cost money!” Huang Yu said stubbornly.

“You’re so stingy ...”

Duff walked onto the stage in a tube – Top gown with a charming smile on her face.

Feng Rao was also very good – looking, and the two of them were quite a sight to behold.

Feng Jing smiled and hugged Duff lightly. This scene instantly made many of Duff’s fans envious. They all wished they could switch places with Feng Jing.

The traffic of the online live broadcast once again broke through the peak, and the bullet comments flashed non – stop. The live broadcast window could not be seen clearly at all.

Feng Rao smiled.”Welcome, Ms. Duff. The short film has a strong Chinese feel to it. What do you think?”

“It’s great!”Duff said. I feel like I’ve become a fairy from Chinese legends. To be honest, after seeing the edited product, I couldn’t believe that it was me ...”

Duff’s answer immediately attracted a wave of friendly laughter. Feng Jing considered the fact that some of the audience’s English wasn’t very good, as well as the netizens who were watching the livestream, so she translated her question and Duff’s answer in Chinese.

“Ms. Duff,” Feng Rao said,”you’re one of the users of the jaded skin cream. Can you please share your experience with the audience?”

“Of course, no problem!” Duff took the microphone and said,”what I want to say can be summed up into one word, and that is incredible! The jaded skin cream is too magical, its effects make me dumbfounded! China was truly a magical ancient country. Chinese medicine was like magic! Some seemingly ordinary plants could actually create such magical skin care products. This simply subverted my understanding! What I want to tell everyone is that after using the jaded skin cream, I’ve abandoned all other skin care products. In addition, I’ve completely fallen in love with this beautiful and magical country!”

Although everyone knew that Daphne was the spokesperson of paradise Corporation, they would definitely put in a good word for her. After all, she was working for someone who was paid!

However, her praise still surprised everyone. Her evaluation was really too high! One could tell that it wasn’t just for show.

Furthermore, as an international a – list celebrity, Duff’s words naturally gave the people of the country a sense of pride.

“Thank you for your affirmation, miss Duff,” Feng Rao said with a smile. Finally, what else do you want to say to your fans?”

Duff’s appearance was just a small part of the show. She would be interviewed for a few questions and then have a few words with her fans.

Furthermore, Feng Jing had considered the fact that da Fu was currently filming a movie and needed publicity, so she had asked her to speak a few more words to the fans.

Under normal circumstances, a celebrity would definitely take the opportunity to appeal to everyone to support her new movie.

To Feng Jing’s surprise, Duff didn’t mention the movie at all. She said,””After the jaded skin cream is launched, please support it! My evaluation just now was definitely not exaggerated at all. Finally, I’ll tell everyone a little secret! I didn’t charge any fees for the endorsement of paradise Corporation, it’s completely free! As for the reason, I’m sure you already know ...”

After she finished speaking, she winked at the camera mischievously and then walked down the stage with elegant steps.
