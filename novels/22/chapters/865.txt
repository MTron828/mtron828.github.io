Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s right!” Qiao’ er, since you’ve decided, let’s choose a good major! With your score, you can pick any major you want!”

“En!” Lin Qiao nodded and said.

“Brother ruofei, which major do you think I should major in?” Lin Qiao asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the profession depends on personal interest!” I personally think that there’s no need to pursue a popular major. I’ll support whatever major our Qiao’ er studies!”

Lin Qiao tilted her head and said,”I prefer designing and creativity, but this seems to be a major only in technical schools ...”

Speaking of this, Lin Qiao laughed in embarrassment.

Xia ruofei sat down on the sofa and said,””Let’s check out the specialty liberal arts majors in Heron Island University first!”

Xia ruofei took out his phone and did a quick search.

Nowadays, search engines were very advanced. There were also Zhihu, split – answer, and other platforms. Hence, Xia ruofei found the answer he wanted very quickly.

He was browsing on his phone in silence while Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao sat on either side of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei looked at it for a while and couldn’t help but laugh. “Qiao’ er, there’s a profession that’s really suitable for you!”

“What’s your major?” Lin Qiao asked impatiently.

Xia ruofei showed the phone to the two of them and said,””The advertising major of Heron Island University is one of the top universities in the country. It’s known as the ‘Huangpu military school’ of the advertising industry. Many big names in the advertising industry are trained in this major.”

Lin Qiao snatched the phone from Xia ruofei’s hand and read it carefully. After reading it, she immediately said,””I’ve decided! I’ll apply for this major!”

Xia ruofei and Hu Zi’s mother looked at each other, then he said,””Qiao’ er, you have to consider this carefully! With this score, you should be able to get into a better major. I just checked, and the best liberal arts major in Heron Island University should be accounting. It’s said that it’s the undisputed number one in the country! Moreover, the career prospects of a finance major are obviously better than an advertising major. ”

Lin Qiao thought for a while and said,”forget it, I’ll choose the advertising major!” I’m not interested in finance, accounting, or anything else! But I really like creative advertising and design!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”sure!” I’ll respect your opinion! Interest was the most important. If he wasn’t interested, no matter how good his profession was, it would be useless! Moreover, the advertising major of Heron Island University is one of the top in the country. It’s definitely one of the best major in their school!”

Xia ruofei’s last sentence was mainly directed at Hu Zi’s mother.

It was every parent’s wish for their son to become a dragon and their daughter to become a Phoenix. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Hu Zi’s mother naturally hoped that Lin Qiao would choose accounting. However, Lin Qiao eventually decided to choose advertising, so she could not help but feel a little disappointed.

Of course, compared to choosing Sanshan University, this was already a very good result.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Hu Zi’s mother was relieved. She smiled and said,””Qiao’ er, mom also supports your choice! Since you’ve decided, let’s apply for the advertising major at Heron Island University!”

Xia ruofei smiled and added,””Qiao’ er, go to Egret Island and learn well. I’ll leave a good position for you in the company’s advertising department in the future!”

Lin Qiao happily replied,”yes!” Mom, brother ruofei, I won’t let you down!”

Just like that, Lin Qiao’s application was finally settled. She just had to go to school tomorrow morning to officially fill in the form, and Hu Zi’s mother could finally have a good night’s sleep.

……

The next morning, Xia ruofei asked Lei Hu to drive the company’s Mercedes – Benz to send Lin Qiao to fill in her college application.

Xia ruofei also told Lei Hu to protect Lin Qiao well during the whole process. After what happened with Xue Fei and Hu Lili, Xia ruofei was also scared. He now attached great importance to Lin Qiao’s safety.

After Lin Qiao left, Xia ruofei picked up his phone and called Liang Qichao, who was far away in Australia.

“Boss Xia!” “Any instructions?” Liang Qichao asked teasingly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it seems like manager Liang is having a good time in Australia!” Was it because there wasn’t enough work? Looks like I’ll have to increase your workload!”

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don’t ... You’re my brother, okay?” Liang Qichao quickly said. It’s already tiring enough to be busy all day!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Alright, I’ll stop joking with you. How’s Paradise Farm doing recently?”

“It’s so good!” Liang Qichao got excited at the mention of work.”Ruofei, the seeds you provided are really good! The survival rate was almost 100%, and when the first batch of vegetables came out, the Western workers were all shocked! They’ve never seen such beautiful and delicious vegetables since they were born. They all exclaimed that it was a miracle!”

“Is it really that exaggerated?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Why not?” Liang Qichao said,”you’ve met our little supervisor the last time you were here. That white man called rodick kept saying that this is a piece of art. He strongly urged us to expand the planting area immediately!”

“Haha, no hurry!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”your task now is to conduct extensive experimental planting and find the most suitable species to be planted in Paradise Farm and meet the consumption needs of the Australian market. Before we expand the planting, we must first find the best combination. We must not start the project without thinking!”

“Understood!” Liang Qichao said,”don’t worry! I have a complete set of plans on my side!”

“That’s good! “I believe you ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Haha, ruofei, if you’re worried, you can find time to come over for an inspection!” Liang Qichao said jokingly.

“You don’t say. I might really have to come to Australia in a few days!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s not that I’m worried about your job. I’m just here for a vacation and to visit you.”

“Travel?” Liang Qichao chuckled and asked,”you’re not alone, are you? You’ve brought people?”

“En!”

“You brought a girl?”

“You’re really right!” Xia ruofei said,”but she’s really a ‘girl’. I’m bringing my sister over.”

“Younger sister? Ruofei, how come I’ve never heard of you having a sister?” Liang Qichao laughed evilly.”Don’t tell me she’s your lover? Don’t worry, I won’t tell the great beauty Ling! Men ...”

“I can already imagine your wretched expression even without seeing you!” Xia ruofei said disdainfully,”your mind is so dirty! She’s not my biological sister, but she’s no different from my biological sister. ”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment, then his voice became a little low. “She’s the sister of one of my comrades. My comrade has already sacrificed himself, and it was to cover me during a mission ...”

“So that’s how it is!” Liang Qichao stopped joking and said,”I’m sorry, ruofei. I just can’t control my mouth. I like to talk nonsense. Please don’t mind me ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””It’s fine ... Qiao’ er just graduated from high school this year, and she did well in her exams. I promised to take her overseas as a reward, so ...”

“I understand, I understand!” Liang Qichao said.

“Brother Liang, this is actually the reason why I came to find you today.” Xia ruofei said,”send a business inspection invitation under the name of our Australian farm! The invitees are me and Qiao’ er. I’ll send you the details later on WeChat!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“No problem!” Liang Qichao said,”it’ll be easier to get a visa this way. I’ll get it done immediately!”

Xia ruofei had a three – year entry visa. He did this mainly because of Lin Qiao. Although it was fine to apply for a tourist visa, it was safer to use a business inspection invitation. The possibility of rejection was very low.

“I’ll send you a WeChat message after I hang up!” Xia ruofei said,”just fax it to me after you’re done. Do you know the number of my office?”

“I know, I know! Just leave it to me!” Liang Qichao said.
