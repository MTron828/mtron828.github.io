After returning to his desk, Chen Xuan sat there for a while before receiving the project document from Tao Ran in his email.

Thus, Chen Xuan opened up a document on his computer before heading over to the water dispenser to get himself a glass of water. Then, he sat down in front of his computer and started studying the document.

About an hour later, before lunch time even arrived, Chen Xuan had already finished reading through all of the documents.

Chen Xuan’s heart was filled with doubt. These documents were very simple! There was nothing difficult to understand, so why did Tao Ran give him a few days to learn?

Chen Xuan was about to stand up and tell Tao Ran that he had finished reading the project document and that he could start working.

However, he thought about it again. Perhaps this was the work rhythm of ordinary people in the secular world? He was here to gain experience, so of course, he wanted to experience the life of an ordinary programmer. So, it was better not to look for Tao Ran in such a hurry. It seemed more appropriate to work according to his arrangements and pace.

Therefore, Chen Xuan dispelled the idea. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, there was only so much content in those documents, and it was meaningless to read them over and over again!

Chen Xuan suddenly felt that this was not an easy time to pass.

Then, he suddenly thought of the two programming languages that Tao Ran mentioned, Java and Python. He muttered in his heart,”Since he had nothing to do, why not learn these two languages?

However, Chen Xuan had no idea. If he were to learn Java and Python, would he be considered to be disobeying his father’s orders?

The night before he left, Chen Nanfeng had told him that he could only find a job with the help of PhD.

Chen Xuan mulled it over for a long time. In the end, he felt that this shouldn’t be considered disobeying orders.

First of all, Java and Python belonged to the skills of programmers. They did not go beyond the scope of computer technology experience in the secular world. This was fundamentally different from the knowledge he had learned about business management, financial investment, and so on.

Secondly, after he had been hired, he had learned more knowledge according to the leader’s requirements. How could it be considered disobeying orders? Even if it was a cultivator, it was impossible to only cultivate one cultivation technique or secret skill, right? It was the same for ordinary people in the secular world. Of course, they had to constantly improve!

With that thought in mind, Chen Xuan’s thoughts cleared up.

So, he began to search for Java and Python tutorials on the internet and began self – learning.

In fact, he had self – taught his PhD. He had not signed up for any training classes. He was very confident in his self – learning ability.

Tao Ran busied himself at his desk. Occasionally, he would stop to look at Chen Xuan, who was standing near the door.

Every single time, he would see Chen Xuan’s eyes glued to the computer screen.

Tao Ran couldn’t help but secretly nod,”although this young man has no work experience, his attitude is good. At least he’s serious in his studies!” If his comprehension ability was good, there was no harm in bringing him along. But ... He seemed to be a little too old! Programmers also relied on their youth to survive, so they probably didn’t have much potential for development.

Of course, these thoughts only flashed through Tao Ran’s mind. He was now in charge of a project team and had a lot of work on hand. How could he pay attention to a newcomer? Soon, he threw himself into the great coding career.

Meanwhile, Chen Xuan sat in his corner, quietly learning Java and Python from the tutorial on the internet.

The other members of the project team were also busy with their own work, and everyone was living in peace.

Just like that, Chen Xuan’s mundane training began from a small corner of the Paradise corporation’s Development Department.

Time passed by slowly and steadily. Chen Xuan lived a very disciplined life every day. Be it at the office or at his rented apartment, he focused his energy on learning Java and Python.

Tao Ran seemed to have forgotten that Chen Xuan was still part of the project team. He had not looked for Chen Xuan for the past few days. Chen Xuan, on the other hand, was so engrossed in his studies that he was happy to be free of any distractions.

Three days had passed.

Chen Xuan felt that it should be enough. It was just a few simple project documents. He had already ‘studied’ them for three days. He should be able to meet Tao Ran’s requirements.

Of course, the most important thing was that Chen Xuan had more or less mastered Java and Python in the past three days. He felt like there was nothing more to learn.

He even learned about JS and databases. He even wrote a few small programs in Java to practice. It felt pretty good.

Hence, he took a small USB and walked to Tao Ran’s work desk.

“Group leader!” Chen Xuan called out.

Tao Ran was as busy as usual. When he saw Chen Xuan walking over, he was slightly taken aback before he said,””Chen Xuan! What’s the matter?”

Chen Xuan’s face darkened. Did Tao Ran forget about him?

The truth was, Tao Ran really didn’t have the time to care about Chen Xuan. Yang Xincheng had been pressing for progress for the past two days, and he was extremely busy.

“Team leader, I’ve almost finished reading the documents you sent me,” Chen Xuan said. I see that everyone in the group is quite busy, and it’s not good for me to be idle alone. Why don’t you give me some tasks?”

“You’re done?” Tao Ran was a little absent – minded.”Then ... I’ll learn more!” Especially some code rules, he had to thoroughly understand them! Our Paradise Mall project is a collaboration between many teams, so the code must be standardized, otherwise it will be easy for problems to arise. ”

“I’ve already memorized it. ” Chen Xuan insisted,”I feel that it’s better to do some practical work. Besides ... Don’t we still have you, team leader, to help us? There shouldn’t be any problems. “
