Chapter 1840: Successful joint training (2)

Translator: 549690339

“That’s why I don’t recommend using the time formation for a long time,” Xia ruofei said.”Of course, it’s harmless to use it during cultivation!”

“I understand ...” Ling Qingxue readily accepted his advice.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright, you can cultivate in this array for now.” I’ll go prepare dinner for you. Considering the difference in the flow of time, you’ll feel mentally tired after cultivating in the formation. You’ll need to stop and rest, or if you feel that your control of true Qi is precise enough, you’ll just leave the formation and go downstairs for a walk. In short ...”

“Haste makes waste!” Ling Qingxue continued Xia ruofei’s sentence with a smile.

Xia ruofei caressed Ling Qingxue’s hair lovingly and said,””Congratulations! You’ve learned how to answer first!”

“I hate you! Don’t touch my head!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I’m not your pet!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright, you can continue your cultivation.” Remember what I told you!”

With that, Xia ruofei took a step and left the array.

Just as Ling Qingxue was about to sit down cross – legged to cultivate, she suddenly saw that Xia ruofei, who had just left the formation, was not walking out. Instead, he was still in a walking posture as if he had been frozen in place.

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment. At first, she did not know what Xia ruofei was up to. However, she soon realized that this was caused by the difference in time flow between the inside and outside. After Xia ruofei left the formation, the time flow in the space he was in was 70 to 80 times slower than that in the formation. Hence, he looked like a slow – Motion shot of a high – speed camera.

Ling Qingxue mischievously made a face at Xia ruofei’s frozen back. Then, she bared her teeth and waved her fists at Xia ruofei. However, she quickly realized that her actions were a little childish and could not help but laugh in embarrassment.

Initially, Ling Qingxue wanted to wait until Xia ruofei left the house before she started cultivating. However, no matter how fast Xia ruofei was, it would take him at least ten to twenty seconds to walk from here to the door. In total, it would take more than half an hour in the array. Ling Qingxue could not just wait like an idiot.

She thought for a while and sat down cross – legged with her back facing Xia ruofei. She quickly got rid of all distracting thoughts and started to cultivate.

Xia ruofei had finished preparing dinner downstairs. When he went up again, about an hour had passed in the outside world. In other words, about three days and three nights had passed in the boundless space.

When he entered the room, Ling Qingxue was still cultivating in the array.

Of course, it was impossible for her to stay in the array without eating or drinking for three days and three nights. Even if she could bear the burden of not eating or drinking for three days, she couldn’t possibly not go to the toilet for three days!

In reality, Ling Qingxue only cultivated for a few hours before leaving the array to rest, eat something, and go to the toilet.

Of course, in total, she had cultivated for at least twenty hours this time.

As her back was facing Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue did not notice his arrival. It was only when Xia ruofei stepped into the array that she sensed him and slowly opened her eyes.

“RUO Fei!” Ling Qingxue greeted him with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”do you miss me after not seeing me for a few days?” Actually, I only left for an hour ...”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,”I don’t miss you!” I’ll focus on cultivation now, I want to cut off all ties with the world of mortals ...”

“Damn ... I think you should stop cultivating!” Xia ruofei said,”if you continue to cultivate, you’ll become a nun! Then I’ll be at a huge loss. Such a beautiful wife, but I’ve led her astray ...”

“Go to hell!” Ling Qingxue stomped her feet in anger.

Xia ruofei laughed.”I’ll stop joking. Qingxue, the results of your cultivation this time are not bad, right?”

“Mm! Why don’t you check my results?” Ling Qingxue asked with confidence.

“Don’t worry, let’s go downstairs to eat first. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”eating is more important than the sky. We can talk after eating!”

“Alright then!” Ling Qingxue said,”now that you mention it, I’m also feeling quite hungry ...”

Xia ruofei was speechless.”Don’t tell me you haven’t eaten?” he asked.

Ling Qingxue was a little embarrassed as she said,””I eat some snacks when I’m hungry ...”

“You’re not allowed to do this next time!” Xia ruofei’s heart ached as he said,”otherwise, I really won’t teach you how to cultivate!”

“I know ...” Ling Qingxue lowered her head and said. Then, she held Xia ruofei’s arm and said,”stop criticizing me. Let’s go and eat!”

Xia ruofei was also afraid that Ling Qingxue would starve, so he did not bother to scold her anymore. He pulled her and walked out of the array.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and kept the array flag. Then, he held Ling Qingxue’s hand and went downstairs to eat.

Considering that Ling Qingxue had been cultivating in the array for such a long time, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to take her to cultivate after dinner. Instead, he took her for a walk around the farm. The two of them walked for a long time and even went to the orchard at the back of the mountain for a walk. They only returned to the villa after nineo’ clock in the evening.

As usual, Xia ruofei let Ling Qingxue cultivate by herself once while he used his spiritual power to observe Ling Qingxue’s condition.

Xia ruofei was naturally very satisfied with the results. Compared to the evening, Ling Qingxue’s control of her essential Qi was much better. One had to admit that talent was an extremely important factor in cultivation. Ling Qingxue’s cultivation was indeed progressing at a godly speed.

Since all the prerequisites had been met and Ling Qingxue was looking forward to it, Xia ruofei would not delay any longer. He decided to try the first joint training tonight.

Ling Qingxue cheered and quickly urged Xia ruofei to take out the time array flag.

However, Xia ruofei said,”let’s not use the array flags for now. Tonight is just a preliminary test. The purpose is to let you have a direct experience of the joint training. Moreover, you have cultivated for more than 20 hours. It is not suitable for you to cultivate for a long time at night.”

“Oh! “Got it ...” Ling Qingxue said.”Let’s start!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”remember the key points I mentioned before. The key is that the two of you must be as synchronized as possible. As long as you can do this, we’re halfway to success. With your current control of true Qi, as long as you don’t panic, it won’t be a problem to complete a successful joint training.”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head.

The two of them sat down facing each other, and their palms touched. They quickly got rid of all distracting thoughts and began their first joint training.

In fact, the circulation route of the cultivation technique was the same when practicing together as compared to when practicing alone. The only difference was that the true energy of the two people was controlled.

The true Qi of the two people had mixed together. Now, one of them had circulated once in the meridians of the other person, and then it entered the meridians of the other person. Following the same route, it went one round. This whole process could be considered to have completed a “great Qi circulation.”

The difficulty of this was undoubtedly in the synchronization of the true Qi and the exchange of control of the true Qi. The cooperation had to be very tacit, otherwise the true Qi might go out of control.

Xia ruofei was already very familiar with this. He quickly adjusted his true Qi according to the “Scripture of the primordium” until it was at the same frequency as Ling Qingxue’s true Qi. Then, he slowly transferred it into Ling Qingxue’s body.

Ling Qingxue controlled her own genuine Qi to merge with Xia ruofei ‘s. Then, she began to slowly circulate it along her meridians. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

When Ling Qingxue was training on her own, she could control her true energy with ease. However, with the addition of Xia ruofei’s true energy, she suddenly felt that the difficulty had doubled. It was as if her true energy would go out of control and go berserk if she was not careful.

The fused true Qi circulated slowly in Ling Qingxue’s body. Every time it passed through a part of her body, it would bring great benefits to Ling Qingxue’s meridians. After passing through her Energy Center, a new wisp of true Qi was instantly produced in Ling Qingxue’s Energy Center. The efficiency of her cultivation was many times higher than when she cultivated alone.

Finally, Ling Qingxue controlled her genuine Qi and sent it back to the meridians in her other arm. Then, she carefully sent it into Xia ruofei’s body through her palm.

Xia ruofei steadily took control of the genuine Qi. It was because of his excellent cooperation that the two were almost seamlessly connected.

After that, the circulation of true Qi became much smoother and faster than in Ling Qingxue’s body. It quickly circulated in Xia ruofei’s body for a week and finally returned to Ling Qingxue’s body through Xia ruofei’s palm.

Only then did he complete a large Qi circulation.

Of course, compared to Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei’s benefits were insignificant.

Just like that, the two of them exchanged control of their true Qi, allowing the true Qi that had been mixed together to continuously flow between the two of them. Ling Qingxue’s control of her true Qi also became more and more adept ...
