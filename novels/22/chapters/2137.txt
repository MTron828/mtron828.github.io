2138 The strange white fog (1)

When their arms touched, Xia ruofei immediately felt the presence of Qi in this bearded Puyol’s body. Although his cultivation was very weak and was considered weak even among those at refined Qi Level 1, the Qi itself was enough to pique Xia ruofei’s interest.

A white man on a deserted island had actually managed to cultivate true Qi. Was there anything more bizarre than this?

It was no wonder that Puyol could become the leader of this group of “savages.” He could barely be considered a practitioner. In front of a group of ordinary people, Puyol was absolutely invincible even with his physical strength.

According to the senses of the white fox, there was a realm stone on this Island. Xia ruofei had also just realized that the GPS and maritime satellite phone could not detect any signal. In addition, there was a white man who had cultivated true Qi in his body. Xia ruofei was getting more and more interested in this small island.

Xia ruofei did not know how to translate “genuine Qi” into English, so he used the word “Kongfu”, which was the transliteration of “Kungfu” in English.

After Puyol heard that, he revealed a confused expression and said,””Kung Fu? I’ve never learned Kung Fu! I used to be a free – range boxer ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and immediately asked,””Did your body become much stronger? did all this happen after you came to this Island?”

Puyol’s expression changed slightly when he heard that. He asked subconsciously,””How did you know?”

A smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. Judging from elder Puyol’s reaction, he could basically conclude that the bearded man must have had a fortuitous encounter after being stranded on a deserted island. He had inexplicably cultivated a trace of true energy, and he probably did not even know what had happened!

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright, take me to your place.” I hope that your memory is good enough. If you miss anything, do you know the consequences?”

With that, Xia ruofei released his true Qi slightly and pierced into a few acupuncture points on Puyol’s body. Puyol immediately felt as if his whole body was being stung by countless bees at the same time, and he cried out in pain.

Xia ruofei quickly retracted his true energy. The whole process only took two to three seconds, but Puyol was already in so much pain that his face was pale. He was covered in cold sweat as if he had just been fished out of the water.

“My Lord!” Puyol quickly replied. My Lord! I don’t dare to ... I’ll tell you whatever you ask, and I won’t hide anything from you!”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei gently pulled Puyol to straighten his body and said,”ask your men to lead the way!”

In fact, Xia ruofei could have let go of Puyol. With the big – bearded man’s weak cultivation, Xia ruofei could easily catch him even if he had to run a hundred meters first. However, Xia ruofei still held Puyol’s arm with one hand, in case this guy fantasized about running away because he did not know his strength. He would have to spend some effort to catch him back.

“Carson, quick!” Pyol quickly shouted. Hurry up and lead the way!”

Carson and the rest looked at Xia ruofei in awe and quickly led the way. Xia ruofei and Puyol followed behind.

The group went into the bushes behind the beach.”The savages are obviously very familiar with the terrain here. They led Xia ruofei around for about ten minutes before they arrived at a forest.

This forest was the “base” of Puyol and the others. There was a mountain wall behind them, and a few simple wooden houses were built under the mountain wall. There was even a fence surrounded by small trees.

There were still two people guarding the place. When they saw Carson and the others, they quickly opened the gate. However, when they saw that Puyol was being held by Xia ruofei, they were dumbfounded.

Puyol, who usually had absolute authority, was like a docile cat at this moment. Carson and the others were like defeated roosters. They were all dejected and walked in front, not even daring to breathe.

“Sir,” Puyol said submissively,”I live in the wooden house in the middle.”

Actually, even if Puyol did not say it, Xia ruofei could already tell.

Not only was this wooden house located in the center of the camp, but it was also obviously much larger than the other wooden houses, and its appearance was relatively exquisite.

Xia ruofei escorted Puyol into the wooden house.

What surprised him was that there were three women living in the wooden house. One of them was carrying a one – year – old child in her arms. The three women only used animal skins to cover their sensitive parts. When they saw Puyol being escorted in this position, their eyes were filled with fear. Their bodies trembled slightly as they looked at Xia ruofei with uncertainty.

“Elena, you guys go out first!” Puyol quickly said. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei looked at Puyol with a smile that wasn’t a smile. If he didn’t guess wrong, these three should be Puyol’s women.

In fact, it was not strange. Puyol was barely a first Qi layer cultivator. In this group of people, he was simply a local tyrant. Women on the deserted island were definitely in a rare shortage of resources. It was normal for him to monopolize them all.

However, when Xia ruofei heard Puyol’s anxious tone, he felt that he was worried that his women would be taken away. Xia ruofei could not help but laugh at the three women’s average looks. He did not know how many years they had lived on this deserted island, and it was obvious that they did not have enough nutrition. Each of them looked pale, and their skin was very rough. Their bodies were so weak that they seemed to be blown over by a gust of wind. Xia ruofei’s close female friends were all as beautiful as fairies. Unless he was blind or crazy, he would not be able to find them. That’s why he took a fancy to these women.
