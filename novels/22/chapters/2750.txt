2751 Settling accounts after autumn (2)

As Xia ruofei led Zheng Yongshou forward, he said,””Don’t stay on peach source Island for too long, in case the sect becomes unstable. After a day of rest, you can return to the star Seizer sect! If there’s anything, I’ll contact you immediately. You just need to act as usual. ”

“Yes, master!” “Yes,” Luo Qingfeng replied respectfully.

Xia ruofei glanced at Luo Qingfeng and said,””As the sect leader, you still need to strengthen the management of the sect. I don’t want the star Seizer sect to become a place to hide filth and accept filth. I’ve only taken in three of your subordinates. Zheng Yongshou once plotted against his senior brother for a treasure, and Wang Boshan even raped an innocent girl and caused her death for his own desire. Who are these people?”

After Xia ruofei had subdued Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou, he had asked them what they had experienced in the illusory formation and why they were so frightened. Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou didn’t dare to hide anything from Xia ruofei’s inquiry. They told him everything. After Xia ruofei heard it, he felt that his three views had been subverted.

Hearing this, Luo Qingfeng could not help but look a little embarrassed. He quickly said,””Yes! Master, this subordinate had indeed only cared about his own cultivation in the past and neglected the management of the sect. I will definitely correct it in the future! Then ... How should we deal with Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou?”

If they did not have a relationship with Xia ruofei, and Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou were just ordinary disciples of the star Seizer sect, Luo Qingfeng would have disposed of them without hesitation just based on the evil deeds that Xia ruofei had pointed out. However, their identities were different now. Strictly speaking, they were the same as Luo Qingfeng. They were both Xia ruofei’s “private assets”. Luo Qingfeng would definitely not dare to make his own decision.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Let’s put Zheng Yongshou’s matter aside for now. I know that in the cultivation world, the weak are prey to the strong, especially in the recent years when there is a severe shortage of cultivation resources. I’m afraid that there are many similar phenomena like him, right?”

“The cultivation world is short of resources,” Luo Qingfeng said awkwardly.”Many people will do whatever it takes to fight for resources. There are even times when senior brothers and disciples turn against each other ... But such incidents are rare within the star Seizer sect.”

At this point, Luo Qingfeng felt that he did not have much confidence, so he quickly added,””At least, it’s rare to see someone reporting to me ...”

Xia ruofei pouted and said,”it’s probably because you’re a sect leader who doesn’t care about the outside world!” Or perhaps they are too lazy to care about many things!”

“This subordinate is lazy, I will definitely correct it in the future!” Luo Qingfeng said with his head lowered.

“Let’s leave Zheng Yongshou’s matter aside for now. After all, he didn’t harm society!” Xia ruofei said, and then his eyes turned cold,”however, Wang Boshan’s actions have crossed my bottom line. Quickly deal with him!”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said without hesitation.

As long as he had Xia ruofei’s instructions, Luo Qingfeng would naturally not feel any psychological pressure when he carried them out. As for Wang Boshan’s life and death, he did not care at all.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Wang Boshan is still in charge of some of the star Seizer sect’s assets in the secular world, right?” You have to first find a disciple to replace him. This person not only has to be absolutely reliable, but also has to have a good understanding of the secular world and a certain level of business talent. And as far as I know, stars Corporation is not a small company. We must take this into account when dealing with Wang Boshan and can’t cause too much of a stir. ”

Hearing this, Luo Qingfeng could not help but look troubled and said,””Master, why don’t we just get rid of him? these worldly possessions are not worth mentioning ...”

“Silly!” Xia ruofei said mercilessly,”is this just a matter of money? Why did you set up such a point of contact in the secular world? Was it to earn money? Stars Corporation has finally grown, how can we give it up so easily?”

“Yes! Master, I was short – sighted!” “Master, there’s a disciple in the sect that you can absolutely trust,” Qingfeng Luo said hurriedly.”He usually also takes on the job of purchasing and has more contact with the secular world. But in terms of business ...”

“You can learn if you don’t understand!” Xia ruofei said,”let him learn from Wang Boshan!” Just say that you want to transfer Wang Boshan back to the sect and let this disciple take over his position. I will talk to Wang Boshan again and he will definitely do his best to teach that disciple of yours. He will definitely not dare to hold back! When the disciple you choose is able to control stars Corporation, you can transfer Wang Boshan back to the sect. By then, wouldn’t it be a matter of a word to deal with him?”

Qingfeng Luo’s eyes lit up and he said,””Master has a way! This subordinate has learned! After we go back, we’ll make the necessary arrangements!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Punishing Wang Boshan is because his actions have crossed my bottom line. At the same time, it is also an explanation for the young girl who was humiliated to death! But I don’t want to deal with it after the matter is over. After you return to the sect, you must strengthen the restrictions on the members! When necessary, catch a few classic examples and kill them as an example to others. In short, the general atmosphere must be strengthened!”

Xia ruofei was a cultivator himself. In the current cultivation world, his cultivation was considered pretty good. Hence, he knew how much harm a cultivator could bring to society if he were to cause trouble. Since he had indirectly taken control of the star Seizer sect, the first thing he had to do was to restrain the people. Otherwise, if someone were to commit evil, he would be implicated as well.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
