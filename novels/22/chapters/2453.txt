2454 Both of them broke through_Translator: 5496903Although Xia ruofei was still practicing the first level of the “great way of the way” after he had reached level 9, his Energy Center and meridians had undergone a qualitative change, so his cultivation efficiency had increased a lot. After each Qi circulation, his Energy Center would produce a wisp of true Qi, which was much faster than when he was at level 8.

The higher the efficiency of cultivation, the faster the rate of absorption of spiritual energy.

However, no matter how fast it was, it couldn’t be as fast as when he used the time array flag to increase it by 70 or 80 times. Therefore, the spirit map world could support such an intense cultivation. Although the spiritual Qi around Xia ruofei was being consumed quickly, it could be replenished immediately. Moreover, the spiritual Qi concentration in the entire space had not changed significantly.

Xia Qing saw that the spiritual Qi concentration in the space had returned to normal and that Xia ruofei’s continued cultivation was not affected. She was relieved.

He bowed slightly to Xia ruofei, who was cultivating in the middle of the pool. Then, he silently left the Archean realm and continued to supervise the free labor in the mountain and sea realm.

Two hours later, Xia ruofei felt that his dantian was full. His true Qi was much higher than that of refined Qi level 8, both in terms of quantity and quality.

After more than two hours of cultivation, Xia ruofei’s cultivation level had been completely consolidated at refined Qi level 9.

He had an urge to continue cultivating.

Although his dantian was filled with true Qi, if he continued to cultivate, his true Qi would continue to be compressed.

In fact, the process of cultivation was the process of continuously compressing true energy. When the true energy was compressed to the extreme, it was the bottleneck of the breakthrough.

The efficiency of this compression was naturally determined by the cultivation technique.

Xia ruofei’s “great Dao Arts” was a top – tier cultivation technique, so her cultivation efficiency had always been very high.

Although he didn’t know much about the current cultivation world and all the information he had was from Liu chengfeng’s description, he had also obtained many other cultivation methods from the human jade talisman. These methods were naturally good, but they were still far from the great Dao Arts. Even the wonderful “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” was much worse than the “great Dao formula”.

Hence, Xia ruofei was very clear that the “great Dao Arts” must be very precious. If it were to be leaked to the cultivation world, it would definitely cause a bloody fight.

Considering that Song Wei was still waiting outside, Xia ruofei suppressed his urge to continue cultivating. He stopped after he had consolidated his cultivation. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When he stood up, he found Liu chengfeng standing not far away from him with his hands down.

Liu chengfeng saw Xia ruofei stand up and immediately bowed.””Congratulations on your breakthrough, master!”

Xia ruofei had broken through to refined Qi level 9 and was in a good mood. He laughed and said,””Chengfeng, you have to work hard on your cultivation too! If I can’t break through to refined Qi level 8 within a year, I can’t afford to lose face!”

“Master!” Liu chengfeng quickly said. You’ve given this subordinate such a good cultivation environment, and an entire year’s time at that. If I still can’t make a breakthrough in my cultivation, then this subordinate really won’t have the face to see you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it seems like you’re very confident!” Then I’ll wait and see! Work hard!”

“Yes! Master!” Liu chengfeng said with a bow.

Xia ruofei nodded and left the medium with a thought. He returned to his bedroom outside.

He glanced at the electronic clock on the bedside table. Only five or six minutes had passed in the outside world since he entered the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei kept the painting in his palm and walked out of the room.

He came to the living room and took out the time formation flag from the space, but he didn’t set it up immediately. Instead, he put it on the sofa.

Then, Xia ruofei opened the door and saw Song Wei reading a book on the recliner under the roof.

Song Wei heard the noise and immediately turned her head.

“RUO Fei! You’re done with your cultivation!” Song Wei asked happily,”how is it? Have you broken through?”

Xia ruofei deliberately showed a proud expression and said,””That’s a must! From now on, I’m a cultivator at refined Qi level 9! Wei Wei, you guys have to work hard too! Otherwise, I’ll pull you further and further away ...”

When Song Wei heard that, she immediately stood up and said happily,””He really broke through so quickly! That’s great!”

Xia ruofei scratched his head.”Actually, it’s not that fast. You know ... We have the time formation.”

“That’s still very soon!” Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei with admiration and said,”that’s refined Qi level 9!”

Xia ruofei enjoyed the feeling of being worshipped. He laughed and held Song Wei’s hand. “Let’s go! Let’s go in and continue cultivating! I’ll try to help you break through to refined Qi Level 4!”

Song Wei had reached the peak of Qi cultivation Level 3 a long time ago. At that time, Ling Qingxue hadn’t even started cultivating. Now, Ling Qingxue’s cultivation was almost at the peak of Qi cultivation Level 3, but Song Wei still hadn’t broken through.

Although Song Wei did not say anything, Xia ruofei knew that she must be worried.

Now that Xia ruofei had reached refined Qi level 9, it would be more efficient for him to practice the “absolute beginning Scripture”. Song Wei would also benefit more from it.
