Hearing this, Luo Qingfeng pondered for a moment and said,””Master, Chi – amassing pills rarely appear in trade fairs and auctions anymore. This old servant can only roughly estimate the price, and may not be accurate.”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.”It’s fine. Tell me your judgment. Just treat it as a casual chat.”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said,”many years ago, there was a trade for Qi – gathering pills. I remember that the price of each Qi – gathering pill was about 60 spirit stones. Now, Qi – gathering pills are even rarer. They are also a very scarce supplementary medicine. Moreover, everyone will bid together at the auction, so it is easy to raise the price. So I estimate that each pill should be able to be sold for at least 100 spirit stones!”

Xia ruofei was a little surprised.””That’s not a low price!”

If each Qi gathering elixir could be auctioned for a hundred spirit stones, then the batch of Qi gathering elixir he had refined today could be exchanged for at least ten thousand spirit stones. This was not a small amount.

Xia ruofei then asked curiously,””Qingfeng, the spiritual energy content in the spiritual stones should be about the same, right?”

Luo Qingfeng did not know why Xia ruofei would suddenly ask such a common – sense question, but he still answered seriously,””Yes, master! The standard cut spirit stones don’t contain much spirit Qi, which is why spirit stones are the common currency in the cultivation world. ”

Xia ruofei had seen spiritual stones before. When he had asked about the auction, Luo Qingfeng had shown them to him.

Xia ruofei calculated the amount of spiritual Qi in the spiritual stone and said,””Qingfeng, I’ve made an estimation. The compressed spiritual Qi in this pill is equivalent to the amount of spiritual Qi contained in thirty to forty spiritual stones. If we can sell it for a hundred spiritual stones, we’ll have a huge profit margin!”

Although the Qi – gathering pill was just a small pill, much smaller than a spirit stone, the spiritual energy in the pill was locked inside the pill through the joint effect of the array and the medicine, so the compression rate of the spiritual energy was relatively high. On the other hand, the spirit stone was mined from a naturally formed spirit stone mine and cut according to standard, so the concentration of spiritual energy was actually very low.

Xia ruofei had never thought about this before, mainly because he was not short of cultivation resources at the moment. Besides, he felt that the spiritual energy in the spiritual stones was pitifully low. He had never thought of using the spiritual stones for cultivation, so naturally, he would not waste his effort to make the Qi gathering pill in exchange for the spiritual stones.

However, he now had a different idea. Xuanji spirit stones were the common currency in the cultivation world. He didn’t have to use them for cultivation. He could use them as money in the cultivation world and use them to buy things that he or the people around him could use for cultivation.

Most importantly, the spiritual Qi, which was relatively the most expensive part of the Qi gathering elixir, was completely zero – cost to Xia ruofei.

Refining in the spirit map space, the spirit Qi consumed would be quickly absorbed and replenished from the chaotic space outside the space membrane. It could be said to be inexhaustible!

Xia ruofei felt that the profit rate of the Qi gathering pill was very high. Unexpectedly, Luo Qingfeng was even more surprised after hearing his words.

Luo Qingfeng took a deep breath and cried out,””Master! You’re saying that ... The spiritual Qi in a Qi – gathering pill is equivalent to the total amount of spiritual Qi in thirty to forty spiritual stones?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yeah!” I’m familiar with these Qi – gathering pills. Most of them can reach the amount of spiritual energy of forty spirit stones. Some of them are slightly worse, at least thirty – seven or thirty – eight spirit stones. A few of them can even reach the amount of fifty spirit stones. Could it be that I’ve refined it incorrectly, and the spiritual Qi is too little?”

Xia ruofei had followed the formula of the Qi – gathering elixir recorded in the Jade talisman of inheritance strictly. He had never seen the Qi – gathering elixir produced by Huaxia’s cultivation world before, so Luo Qingfeng’s surprise made Xia ruofei a little uncertain.

After all, Luo Qingfeng had just said that a Qi – gathering elixir could be sold for 60 spirit stones many years ago, and he estimated that it would be sold for at least 100 spirit stones in this auction. Could it be that the Qi – gathering elixir they had traded before had a much higher spirit Qi content than the one he made?

If that was the case, it would explain why it could be sold at such a high price.

“Master!” Luo Qingfeng quickly said. It’s not that it’s too little, it’s too high!”

“This is high?” Xia ruofei was also in disbelief.”I’ve already made double the profit! Don’t tell me that the Qi gathering pills you’ve seen in the past have a lower amount of Qi than this?”

Qingfeng Luo did not know whether to laugh or cry.”Master, that’s not how you calculate the bill ... I can tell you with absolute certainty that the Qi – gathering pills traded in the cultivation world of Huaxia in the past contained about twenty to thirty spirit stones ‘worth of spirit Qi. Those that can reach thirty spirit stones’ worth of spirit Qi are already very high – Quality Qi – gathering pills!”

Luo Qingfeng saw Xia ruofei’s confused look and quickly explained,””The value of Qi gathering pills and spirit stones can’t be measured by the amount of spirit Qi. The spiritual Qi in the spiritual stones was relatively impure, but the spiritual Qi in the Qi – gathering pill had been purified and compressed, so it was quite pure. The absorption efficiency was completely different! Moreover, Qi gathering pills were especially suitable for low – Level cultivators. If they were widely supplied, the consumption would definitely be huge. However, there are not many people who know how to make it, and it’s getting harder and harder to find an environment suitable for making Qi gathering pills. In the words of the secular world, the ‘technical threshold’ is very high, and these are all factors that cause the price of Qi gathering pills to rise!”
