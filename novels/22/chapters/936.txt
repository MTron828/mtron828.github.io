Xia ruofei and the other two turned around and saw Zheng Peng arguing with a short, fat man with an Asian face. Tan Lili was standing aside with tears in her eyes.

“Brother ruofei, let’s go and see what’s going on!” Lin Qiao said after a moment of hesitation.

Although tan Lili liked to show off and even looked down on Lin Qiao, she was still her classmate. Moreover, they were in a foreign country, so Lin Qiao was still very soft – hearted.

“Let’s go!” Xia ruofei nodded.

The three of them walked towards the scene of the incident.

Many guests were standing at the side and discussing in low voices. Some even cast disdainful looks at the short fatty.

Liang Qichao knew a lot of people, so he asked around. Soon, Xia ruofei had a general idea of what had happened.

It turned out that Zheng Peng was still trying to get close to Brody, so he went to talk to him after a while, while tan Lili was resting on the sofa alone.

The short fatty was a Wei nation man, and he came over with a glass of wine to strike up a conversation with tan Lili.

Although tan Lili was vain, the perverted look in the short Fatty’s eyes made her feel uncomfortable. After a few casual words, she got up and prepared to leave.

To her surprise, the short fatty pinched her butt hard when she got up. Then, he smiled and said that he could pay a lot for her to spend the night with him.

Ever since tan Lili entered the banquet hall, although everyone she met looked at her with fiery eyes, they were at least polite. Even when they tried to strike up a conversation with her, they maintained their gentlemanly demeanor. She didn’t expect this Wei nation man to be so despicable. He dared to harass her in public in the hall and even said such insulting words. She was so angry that she suddenly screamed and shed tears of grievance.

Zheng Peng heard the commotion and quickly rushed over. When he heard that his girlfriend had been taken advantage of by the Wei nation Devils, he was immediately furious and started quarreling with him.

Xia ruofei squinted at the Wei nation’s short winter melon, his eyes a little cold.

Although he didn’t have a good impression of tan Lili, and he hated Zheng Peng even more, tan Lili was still a fellow Chinese. Being harassed by the Wei nation Japanese in Australia, and their attitude was so arrogant, he couldn’t help but feel a little angry.

That short donggua had an uncaring look on his face, saying,””Do you know who I am? How dare you talk to me like that!”

“I don’t care who you are!” Zheng Peng said angrily. Apologize to my girlfriend now!”

“Apologize?” the short Wintermelon sneered. That Chinese woman seduced me first and framed me because she wasn’t satisfied with the price. She should be the one apologizing!”

Tan Lili raised her head at once. Her eyes were red, and she was trembling with anger. “You’re talking nonsense! I didn’t ... Seduce you at all! You’re the one who’s been pestering me!”

A proud smile appeared on short donggua’s face as he said,””Do you have any evidence? Who would believe it? Who am I, Yamada Jiro? I can hook my finger and a bunch of women will throw themselves into my arms. Why do I need to bother you, a lowly woman from China?”

Zheng Peng certainly believed tan Lili’s words, and seeing the Japanese man who called himself Yamada Jiro shamelessly distort the truth, he was also furious.

“Fuck! I’ll beat you to death!” Zheng Peng’s eyes were filled with anger as he rushed toward Yamada Jiro.

Yamada Jiro’s mouth twitched, revealing a mocking expression.

The two tall and strong white men behind him immediately stepped forward and stared at Zheng Peng. One of them asked,””Mr. Yamada, do you need our help?”

As soon as Zheng Peng saw the two white bodyguards who were at least a head taller than him and whose arms were almost as thick as his thighs, his momentum suddenly weakened. He stood there, not knowing whether to move forward or backward.

Yamada Jiro narrowed his eyes and said in broken English,””If this Chinese man gets hot – headed again, you guys have to help him clear his head.”

“Understood!”

The two white bodyguards clenched their fists, and their joints made a creepy sound as they approached Zheng Peng with bad intentions.

Zheng Peng panicked and took two steps back with a pale face. He said,””What do you want? Don’t mess around!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard a few Caucasians say in surprise,””This Wei nation man is Yamada Jiro? So the news of the convenience store chain under Yamada’S corporation entering Australia is true?”

Another person said,”as far as I know, the president of Yamada’s company, Seimei Yamada, and Ethan from Maya. “Dunn has already reached a preliminary intention to cooperate and is preparing to conduct a pilot project in New South Wales. The two companies will jointly create a new retail brand. Yamada Jiro is the second son of Yamada Seimi. He was sent to Australia by Yamada’S corporation to be in charge of this cooperation.”

“This means that Yamada Jiro and Maya are very close!” Someone said,”it seems that the Chinese man is in trouble ...”

“Indeed! Yamada Jiro and Tang Hu have a very good relationship. ”

“I heard that this Chinese man is the son of the Wilkinson winery’s owner,” someone said gloatingly.”This time, he offended Yamada Jiro. I’m afraid Wilkinson winery is in trouble.”

“I’m afraid that’s not all. Tang Hu Bu Jin is the actual leader of the Maya Group in New South Wales. He’s also the king of the Sydney Underground world. I think this Chinese person should be more worried about his personal safety ...”

Xia ruofei listened to the discussion and a playful look flashed across his eyes.

Zheng Peng also heard these words. His face suddenly turned as pale as paper, and he could not help but tremble in fear. When he looked at Yamada Jiro again, there was no trace of anger, but a pleading look.

He had been in Australia for many years, so he knew how terrifying Tang Hu was. It was said that Tang Hu was Tang Yitian’s nephew and was highly regarded by Tang Yitian. He was in charge of many business matters. Because of his relationship with Tang Yitian, Tang Hu had a lot of influence in the Yi Xing society in New South Wales.

This was a Chinese society that had once made the Vietnam gang, Indonesia gang, and even the local Australian Motorcycle gang tremble in fear. Although it had gradually turned underground in recent years, its power was still huge.

It could be said that if Tang Hu made a statement to make him disappear, then he absolutely wouldn’t be able to see tomorrow’s sun, and wouldn’t even stir a bit of a wave.

Zheng Peng’s teeth were chattering in fear.

Yamada Jiro naturally heard the discussion around him. He laughed disdainfully and said,””China man, I’ll definitely take special care of your Wilkinson winery. Of course, I’m sure Mr. Tang will also treat you well, hehehe ...”

Zheng Peng seemed to wake up from a dream. He quickly bowed to Yamada Jiro and begged,””Mr. Yamada, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I was blind to have offended you. Please have mercy and let me go this once ...”

Tan Lili’s eyes widened as she looked at her boyfriend’s pathetic performance. She could not help but feel a trace of sadness in her heart.

Yamada Jiro glanced at Zheng Peng and asked,””Do you still need me to apologize?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I don’t dare to ...” Zheng Peng quickly nodded and smiled.

“But I still need an apology.” Yamada Jiro continued,”it was your girlfriend who seduced me, but she accused me of harassing her. This is a great damage to my reputation!”

Zheng Peng was stunned for a moment, then he quickly said to tan Lili,””Li Li, hurry! Quickly apologize to Mr. Yamada!”

Tan Lili’s eyes were filled with tears, as if she was meeting her boyfriend for the first time. Her eyes were filled with endless sorrow.

“Do you really want me to apologize to her?” Tan Lili stared at Zheng Peng with a blank expression and asked.

Zheng Peng didn’t care about tan Lili’s feelings at all. He said anxiously,””Isn’t it just an apology? What are you waiting for? Are you trying to get me killed?”

At this time, Yamada Jiro waved his hand and said,””Chinese, it seems like your woman isn’t very obedient! Alright, I’ve changed my mind ...”

“No, no, no, Mr. Yamada, I’ll teach her a lesson right away!” Zheng Peng said quickly.

Then, he glared at tan Lili and said,””Tan Lili, are you going to apologize? If you don’t apologize, do you believe that I won’t let you return to the country?”

Yamada Jiro laughed and said,”China man, I’ve already said that I’ve changed my mind.” Since your woman seduced me, she must pay the price. I hope that she can appear on my bed tonight. Do you have any objections?”

Zheng Peng couldn’t help but turn pale. This kind of Public Act of making him a cuckold made him feel very embarrassed.

However, when he thought of the terrifying strength of the other party, Zheng Peng could only smile and say,””Mr. Yamada, this ... Can we discuss ...”

“Baka!” Yamada Jiro’s face darkened as he cursed.

The two white bodyguards also immediately waved their fists at Zheng Peng, the threat was very obvious.

Zheng Peng trembled and quickly said,””No objections! No objections! Mr. Yamada, I’m sure Lily would be very honored to serve you ...”

After that, Zheng Peng quickly gave tan Lili a look and said,””Lily, Mr. Yamada is the young master of Yamada’s company. You’ll definitely enjoy a good life if you follow him. Say something!”

Tan Lili’s heart was already dead at this time. She had completely seen through Zheng Peng’s character.

A mocking smile appeared at the corner of her mouth as she said,””You want to send me to his bed just because of this?”

“I ...” Zheng Peng was also speechless.

Tan Lili suddenly slapped Zheng Peng’s face and said,””Zheng Peng, I was really blind before! I actually fell in love with you, you scum! I’m telling you, if you want to be cheap, that’s your business. I’m not cheap to the point of selling my body!”

Xia ruofei watched from the side. For the first time, he had a good impression of the vain tan Lili.

After tan Lili finished speaking, she walked toward the banquet hall’s exit without looking back.

She had already seen through the so – called life of the upper class. Under the bright and beautiful appearance, there were also so many filth and sins.

Yamada Jiro’s fiery eyes swept over tan Lili’s sexy butt and he said gloomily,””Chinese woman, did I allow you to leave?”

The two bodyguards immediately understood what she meant. They moved to tan Lili’s left and right, closing in on her.
