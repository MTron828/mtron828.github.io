Chapter 616: Crossing acraepoids, young master Song (3)

Xia ruofei opened a bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals and chatted with song Rui as they ate and drank. They ate until 1:30 pm and finished the entire bottle of wine before they got up.

Naturally, song Rui could not drive after drinking, so Xia ruofei asked Lei Hu to arrange for a veteran to drive for him.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief when he saw song Rui leaving with a big bag of Taoyuan vegetables and a special cigarette in his arms. Xia ruofei finally sent this guy away. If he had stayed any longer, he might have stolen something else!

This guy was simply a Bandit! Did he even have the demeanor of a young master from an aristocratic family?

……

After returning from Mount Wuyi, Xia ruofei’s life had returned to its peaceful state.

As the day of the next time he drank the soup got closer, Xia ruofei started to get excited.

All the materials needed to make a spiritual puppet were in place. If there were no new materials required in the new page of content, they could start work after the content was unlocked.

As the days went by, Xia ruofei calculated that he would be able to drink the soup again tomorrow.

Everything was ready, except for the crucial wind.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei had just finished his lunch at the staff canteen and was walking towards the small villa when his phone rang.

“Hello, Ms. Tian.” Xia ruofei looked at the caller ID and answered the call.

The call was from Tian Huixin, but Xia ruofei did not hear Tian Huixin’s voice. Instead, a childish voice came from the other end.””Brother Xia!”

......

Xia ruofei’s eyes softened and a warm smile appeared on his face. He replied,””Huanhuan! Huanhuan, did you miss big brother?”

“I can imagine it! Brother, why didn’t you come to see me?” Huan Huan said coyly.

Xia ruofei said awkwardly,”uh ... I’ve been busy with work recently ... Huanhuan, have you been a good girl?” Did you listen to your parents?”

“I’m very obedient! Mom said that if I don’t behave, brother Xia won’t like me anymore!” Huan Huan said.

A child’s words carried no harm.

Xia ruofei was also sweating profusely. He did not expect Tian Huixin to use such a method to scare Huanhuan.

Of course, this also showed that Huanhuan was really close to him.

At this moment, Tian Huixin’s slightly embarrassed voice came from the phone.””Xia, don’t listen to Huanhuan’s nonsense. This little girl has been very strange recently!”

Although Tian Huixin said that, she was very happy in her heart. When Huanhuan was diagnosed with autism, she wouldn’t say a word no matter how much she teased her. Now, although she could be mischievous at times, her speech and communication were no different from ordinary children. Moreover, her good memory and focus were still there.

The MA family treasured her so much. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

All of this was thanks to Xia ruofei, so one could only imagine how grateful they were to him.

“Madam Tian, have you arrived at the three mountains?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Yup! We just got off the plane, and Huanhuan is clamoring to see you. ” Tian Huixin asked,”little Xia, is it convenient for us to come to the farm now?”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”I think we should do it this way.” I have nothing to do in the afternoon, so let’s meet up in the city!”
