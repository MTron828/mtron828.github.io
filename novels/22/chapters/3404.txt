Chapter 3405: Nine turn space splitting formation (1)

Translator: 549690339

In fact, the formations that Xia ruofei had obtained from the Jade talisman of inheritance did not involve much space rules.

However, Xia ruofei’s understanding of the laws of space was already very deep. Even the realm Fox, who was favored by space, had to admit this. Especially in the spirit map space, as the controller of this space, Xia ruofei could torture the realm fox like a game. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Hence, within the limited time, Xia ruofei quickly picked out one of the space arrays that he had mastered.

“Senior Yuntai, what do you think of using the nine turn space splitting formation to deal with this goldthread nether snake?” Xia ruofei decided to ask for the opinion of master Yuntai. After all, he had a lot more experience.

Upon hearing this, layman Yuntai asked in surprise,””You actually know the nine turn space splitting formation?”

“I’ve learned this formation before, and 1 also remember the formation diagram.” Xia ruofei replied,”but I haven’t set it up yet…”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””But it shouldn’t be too difficult!”

Layman Yuntai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.””The nine turn space splitting formation is indeed not a particularly profound spatial formation. However, for an Aurous core stage cultivator, it is still extremely difficult to set up. Are you sure you can do it? After all, you don’t have much time. You won’t have the chance to make a mistake!”

“I’m confident.” Xia ruofei said calmly,”of course, if you have better recommendations and I happen to know this array, I can try to set up other arrays.”

Scholar Yuntai pondered for a moment and said,””The nine turn space splitting formation isn’t the best choice, of course. There are many other formations that are more effective against goldthread nether snakes. However, this wasn’t something that an Aurous core stage cultivator could do. One had to be at least in the nascent Soul Stage or even the advanced stage of the nascent Soul Stage. In fact, 1 don’t think that an early – Stage golden core cultivator like you would have a high success rate in setting up the nine – turn space splitting formation!”

“In that case, junior will give it a try!” Xia ruofei said,”if it really doesn’t work, we’ll think of another way!”

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”there’s no harm in trying!” Although I’m not particularly optimistic about it! However, this small world of yours seems to be quite advanced. Even if the formation fails, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to survive with this small world Magic treasure …”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be speechless. It seemed that scholar Yuntai still didn’t have much confidence in himself!

However, Xia ruofei did not explain further. He quickly used his spiritual power to observe the situation outside. The goldthread nether snake was indeed very fast, but the speed of the spirit map was constantly decreasing. It should be able to catch up in two to three seconds.

In other words, Xia ruofei still had about an hour to prepare the formation.

Of course, whether the formation could be prepared and set up in a flash was also a test of Xia ruofei’s control over the formation.

However, that was a matter for the future. Now, he needed to prepare the formation within an hour. This was already a huge test for Xia ruofei. The formation was not huge but it required a lot of precision. The preparation work was also complicated. An hour was just enough. In other words, there was very little room for error. Basically, Xia ruofei could not make any mistakes and could only complete it in a short hour without any retouching.

Xia ruofei sat down cross – legged and quickly collected a large amount of formation materials from all over the space. Then, he cleared his mind of all distracting thoughts and quickly recalled the details of the nine turn space splitting formation. He began to prepare the materials.

As time passed, Xia ruofei was completely immersed in the state of selflessness. The materials were floating around him. His fingers moved and wisps of spiritual energy flowed out from his fingertips. They accurately landed on different materials and carved out mysterious array patterns.

As he did not have enough time, Xia ruofei chose the more difficult method. He had to process more than three sets of formation materials at the same time and make sure that each carving was extremely accurate. If he used the standard of the secular world, there would not be a single deviation. Even if it was not to the nanometer level, it had to be at least to the micrometer level.

Otherwise, even the slightest deviation would greatly reduce the effect of the final formation, or even completely fail.

The so – called “a miss by a millimeter is a thousand miles” described this situation.

Scholar Yuntai had also kept quiet. In fact, he had been paying attention to Xia ruofei’s preparation of the materials for the formation in the mysterious ore space.

To be honest, the mood of the master of the cloud platform was very complicated. At first, he thought that it was impossible for Xia ruofei to complete the preparation of the array materials in such a short time. But when he saw that Xia ruofei was actually doing three things at the same time and handling three different sets of array materials at the same time, he felt that Xia ruofei was being whimsical. How could he maintain precise control in such a situation?

As Xia ruofei finished processing more and more materials, the amount of materials waiting to be processed decreased little by little. However, there were no mistakes at all. Not even a single set of materials had been changed. The shock in the heart of layman Yuntai was indescribable.

He forced himself not to make a sound because he knew that Xia ruofei was very focused. He must not disturb him or he might fail..
