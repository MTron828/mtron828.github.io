2497 Flying to Spain (2)

The employee named Jiang Xiaoming didn’t even have time to take his phone off the tripod before everyone gathered around him impatiently and said,”Quick, take a look at how good the photos are!”

The group of young people quickly picked a photo from the series of photos that everyone had a very good expression on, and then urged Jiang Xiaoming to send the original photo to the WeChat group.

Xia ruofei clapped his hands and laughed.””Handsome guys and beautiful girls! If there’s anything, we’ll talk about it after we get on the plane! Just now, Captain Liu said that the airport forecast is that there will be a thunderstorm in about 40 minutes, so we must take off as soon as possible!”

Dong Yun looked up at the sky and said,”The weather today is very good! It doesn’t look like it’s going to rain. ”

Xia ruofei laughed.”The weather radar at the airport is very accurate. Besides, you know the weather in the three mountains. Thunderstorms come at will!”

“That’s true!” Dong Yun said,”everyone, hurry up and get on the plane!”

As usual, Xia ruofei was the first to board the peach Garden, followed by Dong Yun.

Then, the employees stepped onto the accommodation ladder and entered the interior of the peach essence.

This was their first time taking a public jet and seeing the interior of the peach source. Everyone gasped when they saw the luxurious interior.

Shi wen even patted her chest cutely and said,”Am I dreaming? This is too luxurious!”

Some of the employees rarely even took a plane, let alone a private plane like this.

Although the employees had checked the Gulfstream G650 plane’s pictures at home after knowing that they were about to take a private plane, pictures were still pictures. The shock of seeing it with their own eyes was still very big.

Moreover, Li Yifu had bought the Gulfstream G650 as a gift to Xia ruofei. The interior design was naturally extremely luxurious. It was much more luxurious than some Gulfstream G650 passenger cabins that could be found on the internet.

Hence, the moment the employees entered the cabin, they were all stunned.

Xia ruofei could see that everyone was a little nervous, so he laughed and said,””Don’t just stand there! Hurry up and find a place to sit! Put on your seat belt, I don’t need to remind you, do I?”

Xia ruofei then pointed at two individual sofa seats that were placed opposite each other and said,””Leave these two seats for me and President Dong. You can choose any of the other seats!”

The two single – seater sofas were the most comfortable seats on the plane. They were located in the middle and back of the cabin, and further back was the separate bedroom.

In front of this pair of seats, there were two seats placed side by side, separated by a small table. Opposite them were also two seats placed side by side. Further in front, there were two seats placed side by side. These six seats were basically arranged in this order. In terms of comfort, of course, it was a little worse than the two single – seat sofas at the back.

However, it was just relative. Each seat in the public service airplane was much more comfortable than the public service cabin seats in Civil Aviation aircraft in terms of comfort and space. Additionally, each seat could be adjusted to a flat position.

Further ahead of these six seats, there was a small control room between the cockpit and the control room. There were two retractable seats on the side of the control room. Those were the flight attendants ‘seats, which were similar to the flight attendants’ seats in Civil Aviation planes.

Beside Xia ruofei’s seat, there was a three – seater leather sofa. However, the three seats did not have seatbelts. The sofa and the bedroom in the back cabin could only be used during level flight. During take – off and landing, passengers had to sit in the seats and fasten their seatbelts.

After Xia ruofei and Dong Yun sat down, the staff also found their seats. The flight attendants retracted the accommodation ladder and locked the cabin door.

The employees inside the plane couldn’t help but take photos.

Not long after the door was closed, the plane started to move backward and taxied. It didn’t stop until it reached the runway.

A Boeing 777 landed on the other side of the runway. Then, an Airbus A330, which was in front of paradise, entered the runway first. It quickly taxied on the runway and took off.

Then, paradise was allowed to enter the runway and take off.

The plane made a beautiful turn at the end of the runway, and the nose of the plane was aimed at the center of the runway. Then, the plane began to accelerate rapidly, and everyone could feel an obvious push on their backs.

After sliding for a distance, the plane’s speed became faster and faster. Finally, it leaped up and flew up lightly.

Through the porthole, they could see that the ground was getting further and further away, and the buildings on the ground were getting smaller and smaller.

The plane was climbing rapidly.

The Gulfstream plane’s cruising altitude was higher than the general commercial aircraft, but the climbing time was almost the same. It only took about 20 minutes before the seat belt indicator light went out.

At this time, the cockpit door opened, and Liu An, who was wearing the captain’s uniform, walked out. He picked up the cabin speaker from the side of the control room and said with a smile,””President Xia and all the other distinguished guests, I’m Liu An, the captain of the peach Garden. Welcome to the paradise. Please allow me to introduce the route from the triplet mountains to Barcelona.”

Liu An turned to look at Xia ruofei.

After seeing Xia ruofei nod with a smile, he continued,””We just took off from the Sanshan. In the next 11 hours, we’ll cross the Eurasian continent, then fly over the Mediterranean Sea, and finally arrive at Barcelona in Spain. Along the way, we’ll pass through the airspace of Myanmar, India, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and other countries. It needs to be specifically stated here that although the Gulfstream G650’s designed flight range is enough to guarantee that we can fly directly from the triplet mountains to Barcelona when it is full of fuel, we do not intend to do so for safety reasons. Therefore, in the middle of this journey, we will land in Dubai and stop for a short while. After filling up the fuel, we will continue to take off and head to Barcelona!”

Liu An had asked Xia ruofei about this flight plan. Although there was enough fuel to support the flight to Barcelona, Liu An did not recommend such extreme flight. If the destination airport could not land due to weather or other reasons, paradise, which was almost out of fuel, would be very passive and would have fewer options for landing.

“We can see a lot of beautiful scenery along the way,” Liu An continued.”I’ll remind everyone to enjoy it through the captain’s broadcast. I’ll be returning to work now, and my colleagues will serve you with all they have!”

After that, Liu An hung the cabin Radio microphone back and bowed slightly to everyone.

Shi wen was the first to clap, followed by the other employees.

After Liu An returned to the cockpit, the two flight attendants got busy, bringing the menu and preparing meals for everyone.

Xia ruofei unbuckled his seat belt and asked the staff to get up and take a look at the cabin. After obtaining the permission of the captain, Liu An, Xia ruofei even arranged for the staff to enter the cockpit in batches.

If they were on a passenger airliner, it would definitely not be allowed. However, there were not so many rules on a private plane, and everyone knew each other. Besides, Xia ruofei was standing at the door of the cockpit, so there was no need to worry about any safety issues.

After having some desserts with the employees and chatting on the sofa for a while, Xia ruofei went back to the bedroom in the back cabin to rest for a while. He knew that even though he was not arrogant, he was still the chairman. The employees would feel more or less uncomfortable if he sat there. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Although Dong Yun was also a company leader, they had fought side by side in Qiantang for a long time. In addition, Dong Yun was a beautiful woman, so she had a natural advantage. Thus, the employees felt more at ease in front of her.

Xia ruofei had thought about this as well, so he decided to sleep on the soft bed for a while. When he woke up, he leaned on the bed and played on his phone for a while. There was WiFi in the plane. Although the internet speed was slower than on the ground, it was not a problem to browse the internet and read the news.

The plane landed in Dubai to refuel. Xia ruofei treated the employees to a meal at Dubai’s airport. Then, the plane quickly took off from Dubai and continued to Barcelona.
