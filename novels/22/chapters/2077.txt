Qin Lan was very familiar with the business and was familiar with the prices of various models of yachts. She said without thinking,””Mr. Xia, the price of this yacht is about 70 million Chinese dollars!”

At this point, Qin Lan glanced at Xia ruofei discreetly. She saw that Xia ruofei’s expression was normal. He did not have any reaction to the shocking price and did not even blink. She was relieved.

In Qin Lan’s opinion, Xia ruofei was undoubtedly a rich man. Otherwise, he would not have spent three to four million on a yacht. However, rich people were different. Being able to afford a small yacht that cost nearly four million did not mean that he had the ability to buy a luxury yacht that cost tens of millions.

Now it seemed that Xia ruofei was very wealthy. At least, he would have no problem buying the azmu 100 Leonardo. This also made Qin Lan more enthusiastic about promoting her.

At the same time, she couldn’t help but sigh in her heart. It was really infuriating to compare with others. This young man in front of her was at most in his twenties, but he already had wealth that she couldn’t earn in her lifetime ...

Qin Lan was only distracted for a moment before he immediately said,””Mr. Xia, if you order now, we can give you a 10% discount. This is the maximum authority that the yacht manufacturer has given us. It’s still very cost – effective.”

A 10% discount didn’t seem like much, but this was a huge order of 70 million Huaxia dollars. A 10% discount would be about 7 million Yuan cheaper. The yacht that Xia ruofei had bought this time was less than 4 million!

“Oh!” Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”other than the 10% discount, are there no other benefits?”

Qin Lan said with a smile,”Mr. Xia, this discount is all real money. Moreover, it’s a discount range of nearly 7 million. I’ve been in the business for many years. This is the first time I’ve heard of such a big discount range!”

Qin Lan was not lying. Yachts were the standard luxury goods. This industry did not need to rely on discounts or promotions to increase sales. Moreover, the total price was very expensive, so a 10% discount was indeed a very good deal.

Qin Lan continued,”of course, other than this discount, some of our preferential policies during the yacht exhibition are still applicable. This includes the seven – day stay in any luxury suite of the Four Seasons Hotel’s worldwide chain stores. Also, once you buy this yacht, you will automatically be upgraded to a Platinum member of our Yacht Club. You can enjoy even greater discounts for subsequent maintenance and maintenance.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””I like this yacht, but I don’t think your discount is that big!”

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not agree so readily.

Of course, although he did not know much about this yacht, the internet was so advanced now. He only needed to check the internet a little to know the domestic price of this yacht. He was not worried that Qin Lan would give a false price. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Lan had been in this line of work for many years. She had long trained her ability to read people’s expressions. She could tell that Xia ruofei definitely had the ability to buy it. However, if there were no more attractive conditions, Xia ruofei would probably not make a decision to buy it easily.

When he thought of this, Qin Lan’s brain was spinning rapidly. He then gritted his teeth and said,””Mr. Xia, this is the limit of the price that the manufacturer has given me. As far as I know, this discount is basically the limit on the global scale ... But if you really want to buy it, we can give you some discounts through other means.”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and smiled.”Oh? What other discounts are there?”

“Mr. Xia,” Qin Lan said,”you can choose to upgrade some of the facilities on the azmu yacht. For example, the yacht you bought last time doesn’t have a Jacuzzi as a standard, but you can buy it for a fee. If you order this azmu 100 Leonardo, I can make the decision to upgrade some of the accessories for free. The upper limit is 500000 Huaxia dollars. ”

Qin Lan glanced at Xia ruofei. Seeing that he still did not say anything, she gritted her teeth and said,””Also, you’ll definitely need a full range of security services when you buy a yacht, including parking, maintenance, and so on. If you choose our company to provide these services, we can give you the right to use one of the parking spaces for three years, as well as two years of free maintenance, and two years of management fee exemption ...”

In fact, what Qin Lan said didn’t require their company to pay too much for the upgrade of the parts. The manufacturer had given them certain authority. Within the range of 500000 Chinese dollars, they could get it for free. Of course, whether the distributors used this authority or not, how much they used, would still have a certain impact on their sales share.

However, after such a luxury yacht was sold, the dealer could get a very considerable sales share. Even with a discount, the money was still very attractive. Moreover, if the deal couldn’t be closed, then it would be zero income. It was self – evident which one to choose.

As for the security services in the future, such as the yacht berths, their company had already invested in them in advance. Leaving them idle would not produce any benefits. It was the same for management fees. The cost of personnel had already been generated. It would not increase the cost by much just because there was an increase in the number of yachts under service.

This was the same logic as those wedding photos and barbershops often used very low prices to do group purchases.
