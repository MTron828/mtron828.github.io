Chapter 1740: A leap in improvement_3

Xia ruofei put the food aside and set up the formation. Then, he picked up the bag of food and walked into the formation with Song Wei.

This time, the two of them had cultivated in the array for about ten days, which was about three hours in the outside world.

The two of them ate and slept in the formation. Only when they needed to solve their “three urgent” problems would they leave the formation for a short while. Even if they were to cultivate, they would often spend more than six days.

On the fifth day of cultivation, Song Wei had successfully broken through to Qi disciple Level 3. In the next few days, the intensity of their cultivation decreased a little, mainly to help Song Wei consolidate her cultivation. Even so, when the two of them finished their cultivation, Song Wei’s cultivation had already reached the middle of Qi disciple Level 3.

Xia ruofei also felt that he had improved a lot. He was getting closer to Qi disciple Level 6.

As Song Wei’s cultivation level increased, Xia ruofei began to gain more and more benefits from their cultivation. He even felt that if he cultivated a few more times, he might be able to break through to Qi disciple Level 6.

It could be seen how heaven – defying the effect of the “absolute beginning Scripture” was when the two of them practiced it together. This was the effect of one plus one far greater than two.

After coming out of the formation, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Song Wei, are you satisfied with your training?”

“Not bad!” Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled. Can we try to get rid of the peach blossom miasma?”

“In order to be safe, it’s best to wait until you’ve reached Qi disciple Level 4,” Xia ruofei said seriously.

He also added in his heart,”by then, I should be able to break through to Qi disciple Level 6. At that time, won’t a mere peach blossom miasma be easy to get?”

“Alright then!” Song Wei nodded. It seems that I have to be more diligent!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’ve been cultivating for such a long time. You need to take a break.”

Song Wei’s cultivation was a little progressive. Usually, her cultivation growth was very slow and almost stagnant. She could only improve by a large margin by joint training with Xia ruofei once in a while.

Song Wei was a little disappointed.”I’m just afraid that you won’t be in the capital anymore. If I want to find you for training, I’ll have to take a leave of absence and go back to the three mountains. But my parents are there. They’ll definitely be suspicious if I keep going back ...”

Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry about that. I’ll be staying for a few more days before I go back. Also, we’re working on a project here, so I should be coming here often. Anyway, before the end of this semester, I’ll definitely help you get rid of the peach blossom miasma!”

Song Wei finally smiled and said cheekily,”Alright then! I’m not going to talk to you anymore, I have to take a shower! My body is almost rotten ...”

Song Wei picked up her bag, opened the door, and walked out. She found a room and took a shower.

It seemed that she was well – prepared, even bringing a change of clothes.

Xia ruofei smiled and packed up as well. Then, he took his clothes and went to the bathroom to take a shower.

After taking a shower, Xia ruofei walked to the courtyard feeling refreshed. The sky was gradually turning dark. Although Wu Qiang did not come to disturb their ‘two – person world’, dinner must have been prepared.

However, girls took a longer time to shower. Song Wei had not come out yet. Xia ruofei sat down by the stone table, lit a cigarette, and smoked leisurely.

Just then, his phone that he had casually placed on the stone table vibrated.
