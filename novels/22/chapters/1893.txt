Liu haojun glared at Xia ruofei and Wu Liqian in the distance and asked,””Haofan, let me ask you, do you know the boss of the Paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei? It’s the company that’s been selling the jaded skin cream recently!”

“Big brother, why are you suddenly asking about him?” Liu haofan was very surprised.

“You really know him?” Liu haojun frowned and said,”tell me about this grandson’s situation!”

The news of Liu haofan and Xia ruofei competing for the land in Xiaotang town had already spread in the capital. However, Liu haojun had already been demoted to Changping County by that time. Besides, he was Liu haofan’s older brother, so no one would mention the embarrassing story of the Liu family to him.

In addition, Liu haojun followed the path of the government, which was completely different from Liu haofan. He didn’t care much about Liu haofan’s business, so he didn’t know that Xia ruofei had already made Liu haofan suffer in the capital.

Naturally, Liu haofan was unwilling to take the initiative to mention such a shameful thing.

Therefore, Liu haofan didn’t give a direct answer. Instead, he asked,””Big brother, what’s The Grudge between you and Xia ruofei?”

Liu haojun explained how the Paradise Corporation was originally planning to invest in Changping County, but after they learned that he was the one leading the negotiations, they immediately went to investigate other places.

He didn’t mention anything about Wu Liqian. After all, he had left the capital in a sorry state because of his lifestyle. After coming to Changping, he had returned to his old ways. The key was that he had repeatedly hit a wall in front of Wu Liqian. He really didn’t have much face to show.

Liu haojun said,”originally, if I had won this investment project, my work in Changping would have been smooth. I just had to work hard for a year or two. It would be very easy to return to Beijing and get a proper job!” This grandson just had to go against me and block my future! You tell me, should I punish him or not!”

“Big brother, this matter ... I advise you to be a little more careful!” Liu haofan frowned slightly and said.

“What are you saying!” Liu haojun said,”he’s just a local boss of a small company. I can deal with him with just a word.”

“Big brother, don’t blame your little brother for speaking out of turn!” Liu haofan said,”this Xia ruofei is not as simple as he looks. You haven’t been getting to know the situation in Beijing for the past few months. This guy is quite famous in our circle now ...”

“Oh? Could it be that this grandson is someone’s illegitimate child?” Liu haojun laughed weirdly.”I don’t remember a Big Boss with the surname Xia ...”

Liu haofan cursed under his breath and almost hung up the phone. ‘You’re the one who likes this. Do you think everyone is like you?’ Illegitimate child ...

However, they were still blood – related after all. Since Liu haofan knew about this situation, he definitely had to remind Liu haojun. Otherwise, if Liu haojun were to really get into a bad situation, his family would definitely not spare him.

“Big brother, I’ll put it this way!” Liu haofan said. This kid has connections with the song family and is very close to song Rui, Zhao Yongjun, and the others. They’re as close as if they’re wearing the same pair of pants!”

“I’m not even afraid of that little B * stard song Rui, why should I be afraid of his little follower?” Liu haojun said in disdain.

“Let me finish!” Liu haofan said,”if it’s just a relationship between the younger generation, it might be nothing. But this Xia ruofei is not that simple. I heard that even elder song admires him a lot. Every time he comes to the capital, elder song will meet him ...”

“Fuck!” Liu haojun couldn’t help but curse.”Really? Don’t tell me it’s just a rumor in the circle?”

“You don’t have to care if it’s true or not. I’ve already told you everything. It’s up to you whether you believe me or not.” Liu haofan was finally a little impatient.”Big brother, I advise you not to use force on this matter. It’s best to take a roundabout way. You’re not fighting alone in the southeast province. Maybe we can coordinate with our people and this matter can still work out! Anyway, it didn’t matter where they invested. At most, he would give them more preferential policies! He doesn’t have any irreconcilable enmity with us, so he won’t go so far as to fight us to the death!”

Liu haofan thought to himself,”if we’re talking about losses, I’m the one who’s at a disadvantage. He’s the one who’s at a huge advantage!”

Liu haojun fell into silence. After a while, he said,””Alright, I understand, haofan. Thank you for telling me all this. I’ll treat you to a drink when I get back to the capital!”

“We’re all one family, big brother doesn’t need to be so polite. ” Liu haofan said with a smile.

Family ties were usually very indifferent in the rich and powerful. Liu haojun and Liu haofan did not have any feelings for each other, so the two of them naturally did not have much to talk about. They hung up the phone very quickly after they finished talking about business.

Liu haojun looked at Xia ruofei and Wu Liqian. He noticed that they did not go to the security check. Instead, they went to the check – in counter. There was a middle – aged man in a suit talking to Xia ruofei warmly.

He looked deeply at Xia ruofei’s back, gritted his teeth, turned around, and left the hall without looking back.

Liu haojun didn’t notice that in the crowd at the airport departure hall, an ordinary – looking young man was quietly following him from a distance. There was also a young man in a white T – Shirt standing next to the trash can at the entrance of the hall. He had a Bluetooth headset and seemed to be listening to music. The young man also stubbed out his cigarette and walked directly to the opposite parking lot.
