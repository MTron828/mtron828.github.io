Translator: 549690339

Besides, Liang Qichao felt guilty for no reason. This kid was not a cat that did not steal fish. Although he had not achieved a home run with Daphne, they still flirted with each other often during their daily contact.

Of course, he still knew how to control himself and would not harass his female colleagues.

He didn’t expect Liang Weimin to hear him just by bragging to Xia ruofei. In addition to his previous lie, this was practically solid evidence!

“Dad! This ... Daphne is a new employee ...”

“You’re still lying to me!” Liang Weimin’s voice suddenly became louder.

“I really didn ‘t! I can’t even wait to work hard outside! How would I dare to mess around?” Liang Qichao said,”besides, it’s not like Daphne likes me! I’m so fat, and I don’t have much money ... If you don’t believe me, you can ask RUO Fei!”

Liang Qichao was now praying that Xia ruofei would speak up for him. Otherwise, he would definitely be wronged.

Liang Weimin snorted and said,”At least you still have some self – awareness! I won’t say so much to you today. Don’t you have something to report to RUO Fei? You guys talk about work first, I’ll settle this with you later!”

After he finished speaking, Liang Weimin looked apologetically at Xia ruofei and passed his phone over. He said,”Ruofei, I’m sorry ...”

“I’m fine, I’m fine!” Xia ruofei quickly took the phone and said,”uncle Liang, brother Liang was just joking with me ...”

“You don’t need to cover for him! I understand my own son!” Liang Weimin said,”you guys talk about work first! I’m going out for a smoke ...”

Liang Weimin then stood up and left the private room.

Xia ruofei put the phone to his ear with a bitter smile and said,””If you’re not courting death, then what are you?”

Liang Qichao shouted angrily,”I’m courting death?!” RUO Fei, you’re too unkind! You’re clearly with my dad, yet you didn’t tell me!”

“I wanted to tell you right away!” Xia ruofei said innocently,”you didn’t want to hear it and interrupted me. Your matter is more important. Try to recall carefully, is this the case?”

Liang Qichao thought about it seriously, and it seemed to be true. However, he quickly came to his senses and said indignantly,””Something’s wrong! Even if it’s because of my own reasons, I didn’t have time to let you speak at first, but you were the one who brought up the topic of daibora later on ... Aren’t you trying to trick me?”

Xia ruofei smiled awkwardly and said,””I wasn’t paying attention. Besides, if you didn’t brag, would such a thing happen? You should first reflect on yourself!”

Xia ruofei was feeling a little guilty at first, but the more he spoke, the more confident he became. Liang Qichao was so angry that he almost smashed his phone.

However, he was thousands of miles away and he couldn’t do anything. In fact, even if Xia ruofei was in front of him, he couldn’t do anything. He couldn’t beat her and he didn’t have as much money as her. Most importantly, he was still his employee. Just thinking about it made him feel aggrieved ...

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright, brother Liang, let’s talk business!” I’ll help you explain it to uncle Liang later. It’s fine ...”

“You have to talk to him properly, you have to prove my innocence!” Liang Qichao said with grief and indignation.

“I know, I know,” Xia ruofei laughed to himself as he replied perfunctorily.

“What do you want from me?” he asked.

Liang Qichao asked,””What day is it today? Have you forgotten?”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a chill down his spine. He couldn’t help but have a bad thought. For example, Liang Qichao twisted his chubby body and pouted,””You don’t even remember my birthday, so bad, so bad ...”

Xia ruofei shivered and quickly said,””If there’s something, say it! Don’t beat around the bush!”

Then, he couldn’t help but ask curiously,””What day is it? Why are you so resentful!”

“I’m full of resentment!” Liang Qichao could not help but curse,”it’s Christmas today! Did you forget about the Christmas promotion I told you about last time?”

Xia ruofei slapped his head and came back to his senses.

On the way to the hotel today, the atmosphere seemed to be more festive. Many shops on the street had Christmas trees, Santa Claus, small bells, and so on.

Xia ruofei had no concept of these festivals, and he was practically non – existent to them.

If Ling Qingxue had more free time, the two of them might have taken the opportunity to “arrange a battle”. However, Ling Qingxue had been busy recently. Without anyone to remind her, how could Xia ruofei remember?

“Oh, oh, oh!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”so this is what you’re talking about! How’s the situation?”

Previously, Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao had agreed to launch the Taoyuan vegetable series in Australia at the end of the year.

Before this, Liang Qichao had brought Paradise Farm’s products to several exhibitions, and the reception was naturally quite good.

Following black friday’s promotion, Paradise Farm also tested the waters.

Tang Yitian also spared no effort in promoting Paradise Farm. It could be said that the promotion work had been done to the extreme.

Of course, due to the limited production capacity, the real distribution of goods all over Australia to launch the brand war of Paradise Farm was set to be on Christmas, the most important holiday in the West.

“I’ve never seen such a big – hearted boss ...” Liang Qichao couldn’t help but complain. Then he said,”the promotion started at eight this morning, and it’s been going on for half a day. Guess what the results are?”

Australia was three hours ahead of China. It should be around four in the afternoon in Australia. The day had not ended yet, and Liang Qichao could not help but call him. His results should be quite good.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Where do you expect me to go to guess? Just tell me the result!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You’re so boring!” Liang Qichao said.

However, he couldn’t suppress his excitement. He even temporarily put aside the monstrous anger he was about to face his father.

Liang Qichao cleared his throat and said,””Boss Xia, please listen carefully! As of half an hour ago, out of the 1653 Meiya supermarkets in Australia, the total sales of our Taoyuan vegetables has reached 2000 tons! The sales have already exceeded 60 million Australian dollars!”

Although Xia ruofei was mentally prepared, he was still shocked when he heard the number.

60 million Australian dollars was equivalent to about 47 million US dollars.

Even if the labor costs, transportation costs, and taxes in Australia were relatively high, the profit could at least reach 15 million US dollars. It had only been less than a day!

Were the spending power of the Australians that high? Xia ruofei’s eyes were opened.

He could not help but ask,” 2000 tons? That’s equivalent to an average of more than a ton per store? And in less than a day? Isn’t this a little too exaggerated?”

“What’s so strange about that?” Liang Qichao said triumphantly,”Mr. Tang has given us a lot of resources and put in a lot of effort in the early stage of publicity. He also left the best display spots for us!” And that’s just the average number. Some of the larger stores in the central cities have already exceeded five tons of sales!”

“That’s great ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Liang, you’ve finally shown your face in front of Mr. Tang!” Have you reported to him?”

The reason why Liang Qichao was so serious about running Paradise Farm was not only because of Xia ruofei, but also because of Tang He. This old man had no children, so it was up to the younger generation to decide how to distribute his tens of billions of dollars ‘worth of family property in the future and who to give the majority to.

Therefore, Liang Qichao was also trying his best to compare himself with his cousin who was far away in the United States.

There was no doubt that Liang Qichao was in the lead this time.

Liang Qichao laughed and said,”yeah!” The old man doesn’t usually praise people, but he really did praise me this time!”

“Then keep it up!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Mm! The Christmas promotion will last for three days, and I’ll try to break the sales record of 200 million Australian dollars!” Liang Qichao said confidently,”this time, it’s a hit. In the future, our sales of Taoyuan vegetables will be even better! The channel has been completely opened ... Oh, ruofei, you have to thank Mr. Tang properly!”

This time, if it wasn’t for Tang Yitian’s help, Paradise Farm’s vegetables might have performed well, but they would definitely have gone a long way. They wouldn’t have been able to shine as brightly as they were now, even becoming the focus of the Australian media.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” I know what I’m doing ... Right, you should think about how to deal with your father’s anger!”

Liang Qichao, who had been talking happily, was stunned for a moment, then he cried out in grief and indignation,””Can’t you wait until I’m happy enough before you bring this up ...”
