Chapter 350: A full sense of accomplishment (1)

Obviously, ye Lingyun had already seen what happened. “Ah?” Lei Hu looked at ye Lingyun, who seemed to be smiling but not smiling. He scratched his head awkwardly and said,”well ... I suddenly remembered that I still have a few clothes to wash. I’ll go back first ...” With that, Lei Hu took another long look at the villa and then walked out. Hong Tao and the other two looked at each other, not understanding what was going on. “What are you all standing there for?” ye Lingyun laughed and scolded. Why aren’t you going back to do your chores? Do you want to exchange a few moves with me?” Hong Tao and the other two immediately scattered like birds and beasts. “We only have one night to rest,” ye Lingyun shouted from behind them.”Go do what you need to do. We’ll start working tomorrow!” “I know, class monitor ye!” After Hong Tao and the others left, ye Lingyun walked to the stone table in the courtyard. Li Zhifu had been sitting there with a teapot, watching ye Lingyun and the others with interest. “Teacher, let’s continue with our practice!” Ye linyun said respectfully. In front of the soldiers that he had led, ye Lingyun could be imposing. However, in front of li Zhifu, ye Lingyun had always been a disciple, even though li Zhifu had not officially accepted him as a disciple. Li Zhifu chuckled as he put down the teapot. The old man and the young man began their “hands – on teaching” again. Ye Lingyun continued to “take in the air” in the yard with the big dustpan. As a beginner, ye Lingyun’s movements had no sense of rhythm or beauty to speak of. Even lightning was hiding far away in its kennel, sticking its head out and looking at ye Lingyun in confusion. …… When it was dinner time, Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to call Lei Hu, Hong Tao, and the rest over so that they could have a meal together in the villa. After being discharged from the Army, these soldiers had been separated from each other. Today, including Xia ruofei, there were already six people gathered. It was a rare occasion. When soldiers gathered together for a meal, it was natural to drink. Xia ruofei had specially prepared ten bottles of the Drunken Eight Immortals. Although it was not the best Drunken Eight Immortals with the flower petal solution, it was still a good wine compared to the average white wine on the market. Lei Hu and the others also exclaimed in satisfaction. Today was their first day at Tao Yuan farm. Whether it was the food they ate or the wine they drank, they were all things that could not be bought with money. It was the first time Lei Hu and the rest had tasted such a delicacy. Moreover, the salary and benefits were so high, and he could even get together with his comrades and brothers. If life was like this, what more could a man ask for? Seeing how happy the young people were, even li Zhifu made an exception and drank a cup of Drunken Eight Immortals. The meal went on for more than two hours. At last, Xia ruofei raised his glass and said,””Brothers, it’s fate that we’re all gathered together today. I won’t say much, but since we’re here at paradise Corporation, we’re a family. We were comrades in the Army, but now that we’ve left, we’re Good Brothers from now on! Come, let’s drink this!” “Cheers!” “Thank you, brother Xia!” Lei Hu and the others all had excited expressions on their faces. They stood up and clinked their glasses, raising their heads to drink. Xia ruofei laughed and slammed his cup on the table. He wiped his mouth and said,””Satisfying!” Xia ruofei continued,”it’s getting late. Everyone, go back and rest!” The company’s staff dormitories are still under construction. Everyone should try to overcome this problem during this time. The conditions will be better in the future!” “Brother Xia, we’re from the Army, so we don’t have to be so particular!” Lei Hu said with a smile. Xia ruofei’s seemingly casual Pat in the evening had already made Lei Hu’s underestimation of him disappear. An expert must know his place. Lei Hu knew that this lone wolf – born, seemingly thin and weak boss in front of him did not have an undeserved reputation. Hence, he did not dare to be the slightest bit negligent towards Xia ruofei. Hong Tao and the other two had been following Lei Hu’s lead ever since they were in the Army. In addition, Xia ruofei was their boss now. Although they still had doubts about Xia ruofei’s skills, they were all very respectful and obedient. Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I think it won’t take long for our company to grow. By then, we might even have to send some of our people overseas. The current manpower in the security Department is still far from enough. Everyone can take note of it. If you find any retired comrades with good quality, you can recommend them to Ling Yun. We’ll be recruiting another group of people soon.” Lei Hu and the others were overjoyed and quickly nodded in agreement. The mess on the table was naturally cleaned up by ye Lingyun, Lei Hu, and the others. Xia ruofei greeted li Zhifu and went straight upstairs to his room. He carefully locked the door and windows, drew the curtains, and then summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. With a thought, Xia ruofei entered the original space. The pot of jade lion Mo Lan was quietly placed in the open space beside the spatial spirit pond. Xia ruofei walked over and watered it with some petal solution. Then, he fetched some water from the spatial spirit pond and carefully washed every single leaf of the mo Lan. Then, Xia ruofei found a watering can and filled it with some petal solution. He sprayed the petals and leaves of the orchid. The leaves of this pot of Molan seemed to be even greener after they were washed. When the liquid petals were sprayed on them, they looked like dewdrops, making the entire pot of flowers look delicate and beautiful. Xia ruofei knew that the mo Lan was greedily absorbing the nutrients in the petal solution every second. In addition, the extremely rich spiritual energy in the original space was nourishing it at all times. He believed that after three months (three days in the outside world), this pot of Mo Lan would definitely undergo a complete transformation.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
