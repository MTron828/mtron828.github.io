2104 A small matter (2)

When he arrived at the private restaurant, it was a little past Sixo’ clock. Liu Zhe and Shi Qiang had not arrived yet. Xia ruofei walked around the kitchen, gave the head chef a pack of cigarettes, and thanked him for his hard work. Then, she sneaked into the private room in the backyard, took out the tea leaves with ease, and sat alone to make tea.

The manager and the service staff here were all very familiar with Xia ruofei. They also knew that Xia ruofei was Ling Qingxue’s boyfriend, so their service was naturally warm and thoughtful.

At 6:20 am, a waiter knocked on the door before pushing it open.

Liu Zhe appeared at the door with a young man in his twenties.

When Liu Zhe saw Xia ruofei, he hurriedly took two steps forward and said,””Brother Xia, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. How could I make you wait for us? This is really ...”

“We’re all brothers, why are you being so polite?” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’m treating. Of course, I have to come early!”

Xia ruofei then turned to look at the young man beside Liu Zhe.

The young man wasn’t very tall, but he was very strong. His hair was very short, and his Blue Skull looked like he had just come out of the guard station.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you must be Shi Qiang!” Nice to meet you!”

Shi Qiang quickly stepped forward and said,”Hello, brother Xia!”

On the way here, Liu Zhe had told him to be respectful to Xia ruofei. Shi Qiang had once attended a dinner party with Xia ruofei and had seen how the rich men of the three mountains were respectful to Xia ruofei. Naturally, he was filled with awe.

“Nice to meet you!” Xia ruofei smiled.

He brought Liu Zhe and Shi Qiang to the dining table, and everyone took their seats.

Xia ruofei gestured for the waiter to serve the dishes and wine. Then, he sat down and chatted with Liu Zhe and Shi Qiang.

Xia ruofei’s gentle attitude made Liu Zhe and Shi Qiang feel flattered.

Liu Zhe asked,”brother Xia, you said on the phone that you needed qiangzi’s help. What is it?” Don’t worry, I’ve already told qiangzi that no matter how difficult your matter is, I’ll try my best to help you!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”There’s no rush. Let’s eat something and drink some wine first. We’ll talk later.”

As the kitchen was already prepared, the dishes were served in a short while.

As there were only three people eating tonight, Xia ruofei did not order too many dishes. However, every dish was a hard dish, including the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ that had to be reserved a long time in advance and the wild Chinese perch that was so expensive that ordinary people would be intimidated by it.

As for the wine, he did not prepare anything special, and only used the mass – produced Drunken Eight Immortals.

Liu Zhe felt even more uneasy when he saw such good food. He laughed dryly and said,””Brother, you’re spending too much money ... If there’s anything, just tell me. You’re so polite. This brother really feels uneasy!”

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”look at you!” It’s just some food, what’s there to be worried about!”

However, Xia ruofei saw that Liu Zhe and Shi Qiang were a little absent – minded, so he didn’t keep them in suspense. He raised his glass and drank with them, then said,””Shi Qiang, I have something to ask you ...”

“Go ahead, brother!” Shi Qiang quickly said.

“I heard that your father is the leader of the southeast maritime Bureau. I would like to ask if it’s difficult to get a yacht driver’s license now?” Xia ruofei asked.

Shi Qiang heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that. He had been wondering what Xia ruofei needed his help with. He was afraid that he would not only embarrass Liu Zhe, but also offend Xia ruofei.

If it was just about the yacht driver’s license, then there was nothing to worry about.

“Brother Xia, it’s easier to get a yacht driver’s license than a car driver’s license!” Shi Qiang said easily. If it’s a normal registration, you only need a dozen days to take the test and get a driver’s license. If you want it, it’s even easier. I’ll just find someone to help you get one. ”

“Is it that easy?” Xia ruofei asked, smiling.

Shi Qiang said,”brother Xia, don’t worry! The person in charge of this at the maritime Bureau is a good friend of mine. Getting a yacht driver’s license is just a matter of one word!”

“I still have to take the exam, right?” Xia ruofei asked, unsure.

Shi Qiang smiled and said,”brother Xia, these things can be operated. Just leave them to me!” When the time comes, please provide me with your personal information and photos. You don’t have to worry about the rest!”

Seeing this, Liu Zhe said,”qiangzi, don’t brag!” Brother Xia’s matter is very important, we can’t afford to make any mistakes!”

Shi Qiang quickly said,”brother Zhe, I would never dare to brag to you, brother Xia!” The person in charge of the yacht driver’s license is my good brother! I don’t even need to use my dad’s connections to get this done. I can get it done with a phone call! If you don’t believe me, I’ll make a call right now!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”No, no... I’m not in a hurry.”

Then, Xia ruofei muttered to himself and said,””How about this! I’ll leave the driver’s license to you, but you still have to find a set of yacht driver’s license training materials for me to see. I have to know some basic things! Otherwise, if we really go out on a yacht, what if something happens?”

Xia ruofei had no problems with yacht operation. He just wanted to understand the relevant regulations and the knowledge points that he had to master in the normal examination so that he would not unknowingly break the rules when he sailed out to sea in the future.

Liu Zhe also chimed in,”yes, yes, yes!” Safety is not a small matter. Qiang Zi, do as brother Xia said after you go back!”

“Alright!” Shi Qiang said excitedly,”brother Xia, I’ll get you an A1F certificate directly!”

Xia ruofei asked curiously,”are there different levels of yacht driving licenses?” I know that only A – Level cars can drive buses. ”

“Yeah, brother Xia!” Shi Qiang nodded. The B – Series yacht license can only drive yachts in inland rivers, and the A – Series can drive yachts in any open sea area. The A1F is the highest – grade yacht license, and it can drive yachts of any length, and even hybrid yachts with mechanical and sailboats, as long as you report the route in advance and dock at the dock. ”

“So there are so many things to pay attention to!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Liu Zhe also teased,”qiangzi, how do you know so much about it?” It seems like you’ve done a lot of paperwork for people!”

“That’s what my buddy told me. I’ve never gotten a yacht driver’s license for anyone,”Shi Qiang laughed.

Xia ruofei said,”Shi Qiang, I’ll leave this to you!” Remember to find me some learning materials. ”

“Alright, alright!” Shi Qiang quickly said,”brother Xia, it’s a small matter. You don’t have to be so polite ...”

Xia ruofei laughed,”you can’t say that. If I take the exam myself, I’ll waste at least ten days!” I’m quite busy right now, but you’ve solved a big problem for me! Come, come, come, I’ll toast you!”

“Okay, okay, okay. Brother Xia, I’ll do it as you please!” Shi Qiang clinked his glass with Xia ruofei’s and then drank the white wine in one go.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not drink a little, so he also downed his glass without hesitation.

“Brother Xia, the yacht driver’s license is usually valid for five years. You can just let me know in advance when you want to renew it,” Shi Qiang said.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”come! Liu Zhe, you have a drink too!”

“A toast to you! A toast to you!” Liu Zhe quickly said.

……

After they finished drinking, it was already past nine in the evening. Xia ruofei asked the manager of the private restaurant to find two designated drivers. One drove Liu Zhe’s car to send them back, and the other helped Xia ruofei drive.

Although Xia ruofei was not drunk at all, and he could even force the alcohol out of his body with his vital energy, even if the traffic police checked on drunk driving, he would not have any problems. However, the waiters in the private restaurant had all seen him drinking. If he drove away directly, they would definitely think that Xia ruofei was drunk – driving, and it would not be good for his reputation if word got out.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not ask the designated driver to send him back to the farm. Instead, he chose to go to the peach blossom mansion.

After sending the designated driver away, Xia ruofei did not go upstairs. He sat in the car and smoked a cigarette. Then, he switched to the driver’s seat and started the car to drive towards Taoyuan farm outside the city.
