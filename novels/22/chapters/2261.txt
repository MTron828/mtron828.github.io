2262 Decisiveness_Then, elder song changed the topic and looked at Xia ruofei.””But I told old Gao that he saved my life, and you are my Savior too. House song will never force our Savior to do something he doesn’t want to do, and if someone tries to use the influence of the family to force you, house song will not sit by and do nothing!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei felt a surge of warmth in his heart.

To be honest, the fact that elder song could say this was enough to show how important Xia ruofei was to him.

No matter what, elder Gao was elder song’s old comrade – in – arms, and they had gone through life and death together. Now that the GAO family was also a big family, Xia ruofei could not even compare to them in terms of strength on the surface.

However, elder song had made such a strong stand for him, even at the expense of offending his Savior. Xia ruofei was touched.

After elder song said that, he smiled kindly and said,””RUO Fei, I didn’t call you here today to pressure you, but to give you a mind – calming pill. You just need to do this with your heart. You don’t need to worry about the influence of the Liu family or the GAO family. ”

“Grandpa song, thank you ...” Xia ruofei’s voice was choked with emotion.

“It’s my duty,”elder song waved his hand and said,” this matter was drawn out because you treated me. It’s also because we didn’t keep it a secret. ” Besides, you don’t have to feel any psychological burden. This is the current situation. If old Liu can’t hold on for long, the Liu family will definitely be biding their time at this stage and won’t reveal their sharp edge.”You don’t have to worry about the GAO family. Although old Gao and I haven’t been in contact for many years, we were still comrades in the trenches. There aren’t many of our old brothers left alive, so he still has to give me face. After all ... His body is much worse than mine ...”

When elder song said this, there was a faint sense of dominance. Xia ruofei felt as if he was seeing the all – Powerful general in his memory.

After retreating, eccentric song became more and more peaceful, rarely revealing such a sharp edge.

After hearing elder song’s words, Xia ruofei thought for a while before asking,””Grandpa song, I want to know ... Other factors aside, what do you want me to do?”

Eccentric song was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and asked,””Shouldn’t this matter be decided by your opinion? Why are you asking about my thoughts?”

“Because your position is also very important!” Xia ruofei grinned.”If you don’t want me to treat the old master of the Liu family, then I’ll pack my things and return to the three mountains today without a second word!”

“You little rascal!” Elder song couldn’t help but chuckle. He then asked meaningfully,”what if I hope you can help him appropriately?”

Xia ruofei had already expected this. He said without hesitation,””Then I can consider it. At least I won’t reject you.”

Eccentric song’s eyes revealed a trace of relief. He sighed and said seriously,”Ruofei, my opinion is only for reference. I didn’t say it before because I was afraid it would affect your decision. Since you asked, I’ll tell you my opinion!”

Xia ruofei nodded and looked at elder song as if he was listening.

“I’ve said it before,”said eccentric song,” he was an old man who came out of the trenches back then, but not many of them are left. Other factors aside, I don’t want old Liu to leave so early, especially if there’s a chance to save him. “But then again, the Liu family has caused us a lot of trouble these years. Whether it’s in the political or business fields, they’ve been holding us back. From this perspective, if old Liu is no longer around, the Liu family is nothing to worry about ...”

Elder song was very honest. He did not hide his conflicted feelings from Xia ruofei.

To be honest, at elder song’s level, even if he didn’t speak in a mysterious manner, he would at least have a hidden meaning. It was impossible for him to be so direct. He had only said those words without any qualms because he treated Xia ruofei as his own nephew.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””I understand ...”

“You understand?” eccentric song was stunned for a moment. I haven’t even thought clearly about which side I should stand on, and you already understand?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Grandpa song, you’re being too careful!” In fact, after hearing your words, I still admire you very much!”

Indeed, if elder song had told Xia ruofei that he did not want the old man of the Liu family to survive, Xia ruofei would not have felt that it was wrong. After all, from the perspective of the family, it was the best result. However, elder song still expressed his reluctance to part with their old friendship. This was a rare flash of humanity.

A person was a human because he was an emotional animal. If everything was done from the pros and cons and considered the benefits, then from the perspective of human nature, there were some flaws.

“Don’t be sarcastic!”Eccentric song said with a bitter smile.

Xia ruofei replied seriously,”I wouldn’t dare to mock you!” These are my heartfelt words!”

“Ruofei, you said you understood. Have you decided what to do?” elder song asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Almost! I already have a rough plan. ”

In fact, Xia ruofei had a basic principle before he came.

Since the Liu family already knew about his medical skills, it would be unwise to reject him. Although Xia ruofei was not afraid of trouble, it did not mean that he liked to be bothered by it.

If he agreed to treat old master Liu, Xia ruofei would not be able to get over it. If he were to give in just because the other party put a little pressure on him, would he have any backbone? Besides, it was not in Xia ruofei’s interest to give the Liu family a living and healthy pillar of support. It was not in the song family’s interest either.

So he needed to find a balance point in between.

In fact, this was very similar to elder song’s mentality.

The only difference was that elder song was only in a dilemma. In fact, he had given the choice to Xia ruofei. He did not exert any influence on Xia ruofei at all. Instead, he stood up and supported Xia ruofei. The only thing Xia ruofei needed to consider was how to minimize his troubles and maximize his benefits.

Now that elder song’s mentality was basically in line with his considerations, he was naturally firm in his decision.

Eccentric song couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Then can you tell me what your decision is?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Grandpa song, please let me keep you in suspense.” I’ll have to trouble you to pass a message to the Liu family that I hope to meet with the old master of the Liu family, just for a moment. ”

“It seems like you don’t intend to refuse?” eccentric song raised his brows.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Grandpa song, I’ll tell you everything after I meet with the old master of the Liu family. I’ll give you a detailed report then.”

Eccentric song chuckled and waved his hand. “There’s no need to report ... I’ve already said that no matter what decision you make, I’ll support you unconditionally! And no one, no power can force you to do something you don’t want to do!”

Elder song continued,”I’ll get Xiao Lu to contact the Liu family immediately. I’m sure there won’t be any suspense. They have no other choice. They’ll definitely agree to meet!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then I’ll have to trouble you, Grandpa song.”

Elder song chuckled as he pressed the call button on the phone in the study room. He directly said,”Let Xiao Lu in for a moment!”

Then, he looked up at Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, you stay for lunch! If everything goes well, you should be able to see that old guy of Liu family in the afternoon!”
