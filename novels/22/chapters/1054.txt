Chapter 1055: Chapter 670 – selling like crazy_1

Translator: 549690339

The 30 people who won the lottery were scattered in all corners of the venue. The delicious smell of the abalone also spread in the venue. Those who didn’t win the lottery looked enviously at the other winners who were tasting the top – Quality abalones.

Even the rich people in the VIP area nodded their heads after tasting the abalone and whispered to the people next to them.

From their expressions, it was clear that these billionaires were also very tempted by the top – grade abalones provided by the Paradise Corporation.

Not to mention that almost all of the abalones had reached the standard of top – Quality one – headed abalones, the quality of the abalones itself surprised the rich people. It was completely beyond their imagination.

The meat of the abalone was very tender, chewy, and chewy. It was quite fresh and delicious. Under the cooking of a Michelin star chef, not only did it not have the slightest fishy smell, but it also had a special fragrance, which left a deep impression on everyone who had tasted it today. 1

In fact, it was not that Chef Liu’s cooking skills were superb, but that the abalones grew in the spirit map space and absorbed the rich spirit Qi in the space all day long. The seawater in the space was countless times purer than the ocean environment outside, so the meat was very pure. Even if an ordinary chef cooked it, there would not be too much of a fishy smell.

Of course, regardless of whether everyone thought that Chef Liu’s skills were good or that the abalones from paradise Corporation were of superb quality, Feng Jing’s warm – up event was a hit.

The atmosphere of the entire venue became lively all of a sudden. The guests who were already interested in competing were all eager to try. Many rich people in the VIP area also showed an interested expression.

There weren’t many abalones on each plate. Seeing that everyone was almost done eating, Feng Rao smiled and said,””I believe that everyone has a very direct understanding of the top – grade abalone that our paradise Corporation is auctioning today. Let’s cut the chit – chat and go straight to the auction!”

Feng Rao made an inviting gesture and said with a smile,””I’ll hand the stage over to the Hengfeng auction house’s chief auctioneer, Mr. Lu zhongguang! Everyone, please give him a round of applause!”

The audience immediately burst into a round of warm applause.

Lu zhongguang was quite well – known in Hong Kong, especially in the auction industry. He was the chief auctioneer of Hengfeng auction house and one of the executive directors of Hengfeng auction house. Usually, he would only host very important auctions. This detail also reflected the importance of the Hengfeng group to this auction. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Lu zhongguang was dressed in a black suit with a festive red tie. He had hair oil on his head, and his hair was combed back meticulously. He was also wearing shiny black leather shoes. He walked with light steps, almost as if he was jogging to the center of the stage.

Lu zhongguang first bowed slightly to Feng Jing, then picked up the microphone and said,””Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to Hengfeng group and paradise corporation’s joint abalone auction. I’m today’s auctioneer, Lu zhongguang!”

“As the saying goes, it’s hard to buy a two – headed abalone with money. As we all know, it’s very difficult to raise an abalone to the standard of a two – headed abalone, and the risk is very high. So, big abalones of this standard have always been very rare. It can be said that it’s hard to find even with money. Some people even regard two – headed abalones as family treasures!” Lu zhongguang said in his very unique and magnetic voice,”two – headed abalone is so rare, let alone one – headed abalone. Most of the top – Quality abalones we are auctioning today are over the standard of a one – Head abalone. It is unprecedented to auction so many one – Head abalones at once in the history of Hong Kong!”

At this point, Lu zhongguang’s voice began to increase in volume, and his voice was full of appeal.””This is a once – in – a – lifetime opportunity. Friends who love this, please don’t miss this rare opportunity. Perhaps your hesitation today will cause you to regret it in the future ...”

Lu zhongguang picked up the auction mallet and knocked on it. He smiled and said,””Now that everyone has a deep and direct understanding of the top – grade abalones we’re auctioning today, let’s get to the main topic!”

“The first batch of abalones to be auctioned is three in total!” Lu zhongguang held a cue card in his hand and said,”these three abalones are the same as the two abalones we shared just now. They are all a dozen grams away from reaching the standard of a one – headed abalone. If we measure them by the standard of a two – headed abalone, they are far beyond the standard!”

“The three abalones weigh 599 grams, 592 grams, and 589 grams respectively!” Lu zhongguang said after looking at the prompt card.

When the guests and reporters below the stage heard this number, they couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise. Some people also made a sound of pity.

The standard for one – headed abalone and two – headed abalone was measured by several abalones that weighed one Sima Jin. If an abalone weighed more than one Sima Jin, it was undoubtedly a one – headed abalone. Two – headed abalone was two abalones that weighed more than one Sima Jin. In other words, an abalone that weighed more than half Sima Jin and less than one Sima Jin was a two – headed abalone.

The unit of measurement for Sima Jin is much heavier than our usual Jin. One Jin is 500 grams, and one Sima Jin is about 604.79 grams.
