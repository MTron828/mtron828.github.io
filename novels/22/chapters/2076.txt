“I’m not planning to use this yacht in the three mountains. We’ll talk about it when we need it!”Xia ruofei smiled.

Hearing this, Qin Lan was slightly disappointed, but she did not show it. She only smiled and said,””Alright,” he said.

“By the way, when I made the order, manager Liao told me that you provide delivery services.” Xia ruofei said,”I need to transport the yacht to a warehouse in my city. Is that okay?”

“Of course, no problem,” Qin Lan replied without hesitation.”These are all within the scope of our after – Sales service. You just need to provide the address.”

Qin Lan had a fresh memory of this somewhat strange request. Generally speaking, customers would definitely not ask to store the yacht in the warehouse. After all, they bought the yacht for use. How could they use it if it was placed on land?

At that time, Liao Bo had also considered that the yacht was very size and Xia ruofei had also guaranteed that there were no problems with the warehouse and the access road. They could definitely pass through, so he had agreed to this strange request.

After all, compared to a business worth millions, the small cost of hoisting the yacht onto a flatbed cart and transporting it to the city was nothing.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei took a piece of paper from the table and wrote down the address of his warehouse in the city. Then, he handed it to Qin Lan.

“I hope you can arrange for the yacht to be sent here as soon as possible,” he said.

“We’ll contact the flatbed today, but it will take some time to hoist and fix the yacht. Can we send it to you by tomorrow morning at the latest?” Qin Lan asked.

“Alright, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Qin Lan smiled and nodded. The business was done now. All they needed to do was to let Liao Bo go through the procedures and transfer the yacht to Xia ruofei.

Just as she was about to send Xia ruofei out, Xia ruofei suddenly asked,””Manager Qin, are there any discounts for buying a yacht?”

Qin Lan was stunned for a moment and then quickly said,””There are! There were! Mr. Xia, you’re our old customer. If you buy a new boat from our company, you can enjoy a discount, which is comparable to the yacht exhibition!”

After Qin Lan finished speaking, she looked at Xia ruofei with anticipation.

Of course, she didn’t have much hope. After all, Xia ruofei had just bought a new yacht and had not used it yet. The possibility of buying another yacht under such circumstances was too low.

However, she felt that since Xia ruofei had asked, he was definitely not just asking casually. Perhaps he was introducing a friend to buy it?

Yachts were a luxury item with a very small audience. They were high – end toys for the rich. This nature determined that Yacht Sales could not be as high as car 4S stores. Therefore, it was more important to maintain the relationship with high – end customers.

Of course, Qin Lan didn’t know that Xia ruofei’s small sports yacht was meant to be stored in the medium. The reason why he asked was that he really wanted to buy another yacht to be used in the outside world.

On one hand, he had fallen in love with the feeling of freedom after experiencing it just now. However, he was free in the space. After all, it was his secret. He had always been alone in the space. Even if it was a yacht, there was less fun. Moreover, he couldn’t share it with the people close to him.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei had a lot of money now, especially from the trip to Italy. He had earned nearly 300 million euros, which was about 3 billion in Chinese dollars. Buying a yacht was a small amount.

If he bought a yacht and placed it outside, he could drive the yacht out to sea with his good friends and female confidants when he was free. He could even organize a party for the company’s management and treat it as company welfare.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei said with interest,””Oh, really? Then can you introduce me to them? is there anything you can recommend?”

“Mr. Xia, let’s sit over there and talk!” Qin Lan said enthusiastically.

Then, she turned around and shouted,”little Liao!” And a cup of hot tea for Mr. Xia! Quickly order the fruit plate and desserts!”

“Alright!” Liao Bo quickly responded.

Qin Lan invited Xia ruofei to sit on the leather sofa in the guest area. Then, she asked expectantly,””Mr. Xia, would you like to buy it yourself or introduce it to your friend? I need to understand your needs before I can recommend it to you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I want to build one myself. As for the requirements ... I’m not too specific. It’s just that it has a bigger size and better performance. It’d be best if it’s a new model. That way, there will be more new technology!”

“I understand! I understand!” Qin Lan said and then asked carefully,”then do you have a price in mind?”

It was a taboo for some rich people to ask this question because it would seem like they were doubting their ability.

But Xia ruofei did not mind. He smiled and said,””The price is not a problem. As long as I like it, it’s fine even if it’s a little expensive.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hearing this, Qin Lan was even more overjoyed. One look and one could tell that this person was not short of money. They liked this kind of customer the most. They would not be calculative about the price and most of them were very generous. As long as they took a fancy to them, they would buy it.

“Mr. Xia, if that’s the case, I would recommend you to buy the azmu feiqiao series of large yachts, such as the Azimut84, Azimut84us, Azimut88, and so on ...” She quickly cheered up and said.

While Qin Lan was introducing, she skillfully found the corresponding color page from the side and placed it in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei looked at the colorful page with great interest. The yachts mentioned by Qin Lan were 25 to 26 meters long. The interior space was more spacious and the facilities were quite luxurious.

There was no price tag on the colorful page, but Xia ruofei knew that it was much more expensive than the one he had bought before.

From the corner of his eyes, Xia ruofei caught a glimpse of another colorful page. The photo of the yacht on it made his eyes light up. He could not help but point at the photo and ask,””Manager Qin, what model is this yacht?”

Qin Lan stopped the introduction and looked in the direction that Xia ruofei was pointing at. She quickly passed the colored page to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, this is the Azimut100 Leonardo. It’s the size in this series. It’s 30.51 meters long, 6.8 meters wide, and its highest speed is 32 knots ...”

Qin Lan reported the series of data of the Azimut100 Leonado yacht without thinking.

Then, she said,”Mr. Xia, this yacht is 30 meters long from the bow to the stern. It has a huge space and unique decorations. It gives you a very comfortable and elegant feeling. It will bring you an infinite and elegant life experience.” You can invite your friends and family to enjoy the fun at sea on this huge open – Air deck.

It had a large and variable stern deck with a U – shaped bench that could be turned into a comfortable beach bed.

There was a unique passage design on the ship to ensure that the service personnel on the ship could pass quickly without affecting the privacy of the guests on the ship.

The yacht had a unique, large sea view penthouse with a super large sofa and impressive furniture on the observation deck. In addition, the stern deck was also made of high – grade pomelo wood.

It also has a large master room with a large wardrobe, a Large resting area and bathroom, and a large shower ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””From what you’ve said, it’s like a Palace on the sea!”

Qin Lan laughed in embarrassment and said,””Mr. Xia, I’m not exaggerating. This model of yacht is one of the top brands in the azmu brand. Many world – Class celebrities have bought yachts of this model!”

Xia ruofei flipped through the introduction on the colored page and nodded.””It looks good. How much does it cost to buy this yacht now?”
