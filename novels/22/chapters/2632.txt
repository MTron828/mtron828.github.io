Liu Kuan was a man of few words. He didn’t talk much along the way. Only Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao chatted. Occasionally, Xia ruofei would chat with Daphne and Liu Kuan so that he wouldn’t leave them out.

In fact, Liu Kuan had hoped to fly back to China directly. After all, he was still worried about his father’s health.

When he learned that Xia ruofei wanted to stay in Australia for a day, Liu Kuan did not object. At first, he wanted to find a hotel near the airport to rest for a day and then go back the next day. However, he thought about it and decided to go with Xia ruofei.

His main purpose was to stay by Xia ruofei’s side and observe some details to determine if Xia ruofei was interested in Qingyun Island. This was also one of the tasks that old master Liu had given him.

In fact, Liu Kuan had already made a basic judgment, and that was that Xia ruofei was quite satisfied with Qingyun Island. He should be a little tempted, but not particularly interested. Since they set foot on the island yesterday, Xia ruofei had not talked much about this other than asking him about the basic situation on the island. From the moment they boarded the plane until now, Xia ruofei seemed to have forgotten about the incident on the island. He did not mention a word about it at all.

In fact, this was the impression that Xia ruofei wanted Liu Kuan to have.

The reason why he chose to stay in Australia for a day was that he didn’t want the Liu family to think that he was in a hurry to go back and was eager to get the green cloud Island. Of course, he hadn’t been to Australia in a long time. He could also inspect Paradise Farm, West Winery, and gold oak winery. It could be said to be killing two birds with one stone.

The road conditions on the road from Sydney to Hunter Valley were not bad. After leaving the city, it was quite free and there was no traffic jam at all.

The scenery along the way was still as beautiful as ever. The pure blue sky, the verdant grass on both sides of the road, and the occasional flash of kangaroos in the bushes in the distance. Everything here made people feel close to nature.

The car drove all the way to the Hunter Valley. It didn’t stop at the entrance of Paradise Farm and drove straight in.

There were vegetable greenhouses in many places on the farm, and the scenery was not as beautiful as the last time Xia ruofei came. Qianqian could not help it. The vegetables and fruits produced by Paradise Farm were very popular in Australia, even though the price was several times more expensive than the same variety of vegetables. This was mainly due to the Super – Beautiful appearance of the vegetables and fruits, as well as all the retail stores related to the Mei ya group under Tang Yitian. Without exception, all of Paradise Farm’s products were placed in the most eye – catching positions. Since the goods were selling so well, Liang Qichao naturally continued to increase production.

Now that the farm had thousands of hectares of vegetable greenhouses, the benefits of large – scale planting had also begun to show. After the scientific arrangement of the planting time, Paradise Farm could produce dozens of tons of vegetables, melons, and fruits every day. A large number of refrigerators entered and exited Paradise Farm every day, bringing the high – Quality vegetables, melons, and fruits to Maya supermarkets all over Australia.

The average price of the vegetables, fruits, and fruits produced by Paradise Farm was about 30 Australian dollars per kilogram. In other words, the farm’s daily output value could reach three to four million Australian dollars, which was several billion Australian dollars a year. If converted to Chinese dollars, that was more than 10 billion.

Of course, the labor costs and transportation costs in Australia were much higher than those in China. In addition to various taxes, the profit margin was not as high as that of domestic farms.

Even so, the annual net profit could still reach billions of Yuan. This was mainly because the most important cost was the seeds of the Pi Xiu, which were almost cost – free for Xia ruofei.

Moreover, Paradise Farm was still gradually increasing its production capacity, constantly building vegetable greenhouses. Qinqin farm had thousands of hectares of land, and more than half of the land had not been built in time. When Paradise Farm’s production capacity reached its peak, the profit figure would increase several times.

It could be said that Paradise Farm was also a super terrifying money – making machine.

At that time, Grandpa Tang He’s investment was a huge success because of the introduction of Xia ruofei as a business partner and the courage to give Xia ruofei the equity of flight control. It could be said to be a qualitative leap. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After the car turned a corner, the farm’s living area appeared in front of them.

The tranquil lake, the elegant Swan, the exquisite lakeside villa ... Everything in front of them was like a painting, making people’s hearts unconsciously become a bit more peaceful.

Even Liu Kuan, who was a man of few words, couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration when he saw this beautiful scene.

The car stopped in front of the small villa, and a few figures quickly ran over.

Xia ruofei took a closer look and could not help but smile.

The newcomers were the Veterans he had sent to Australia, Xu Yougang, Zeng Liang, Wang Chong, and Zhang Aijun, who were responsible for the security of Paradise Farm.

After Xia ruofei got out of the car, Xu Yougang and the others greeted him excitedly.

“Boss!”

“Boss!”

Xia ruofei laughed and patted Xu Yougang’s shoulder.”Old Xu, you’ve become much whiter! It seems life in Australia is not bad!”

Xu Yougang laughed in embarrassment and said,””The food here is better ...”

“That should be fat, not white!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I see that you’ve maintained your figure well! You still have training?”
