2388 The destruction of the dark shadow (1)

Tina and the other two’s bodies stiffened as if they had seen a ghost.

Over the years, they had carried out dozens of missions, big and small, and encountered countless dangerous situations. However, none of them had ever felt as powerless as today.

This was a completely unbalanced battle. No matter how strong their combat abilities were, they could not use them at all.

Tina and the other two even realized that they couldn’t even make a sound, as if their vocal cords were imprisoned and they couldn’t vibrate at all.

Their eyes were the only ones that could move. At this moment, all three of them had deep fear in their eyes.

Tina and the other two watched as Xia ruofei picked up the person who was curled up on the ground. Then, he turned the chair around with one hand and pressed the person onto the chair with the other hand.

The unconscious man was the person in charge of the dark shadow Squad, Bason!

Tina and the other two could roughly guess the reason for tonight’s incident. The other party must have sent a gathering signal online through the Wizards to gather all the members of the dark shadow Squad and arrest them one by one.

The three of them did not doubt the other party’s ability at all. Just based on that superb technique just now, even if the dark shadow Squad were all experienced killers, it would be useless. No matter how many of them came, they would just be sending themselves to their deaths.

The worst situation had happened! Tina and the other two were in a heavy mood.

Xia ruofei patted Ong’s head.

Ong slowly woke up, but the moment he opened his eyes, he immediately fell into a state of confusion.

“Are these people from the dark shadow Squad?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

In fact, Xia ruofei was just doing his routine check. Judging from Tina and the other two’s skillful tactical cooperation and the various killing weapons they had on them, they would not believe that they were not assassins.

Ong’s empty eyes swept across Tina and the other two before he nodded and said,”This is the most elite combat Team of our dark shadow Squad. The one in the middle is the beautiful snake Tina, the other two are the Pampas Eagle, Kitt, and the big guy, Guli ...”

Tina and the other two were dejected. It was obvious that Bason had sold out the entire shadow team. They only asked a simple question and Bason told them the most detailed information without any hesitation. He did not even hide their nicknames.

Xia ruofei took out a name list from his pocket, crossed off a few names, and said,””So, there are only five people who haven’t arrived yet?”

Ong said,”they should be on a mission. There are three combat teams in the dark shadow Squad that are currently on a mission. The members of the other two combat teams have just returned. This team should be at a critical stage of the mission, so they can’t leave.”

“Forget it, they’re lucky!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Including Tina and the other two, Xia ruofei had already captured 89 assassins today. It could be said that the entire dark shadow Squad had fallen apart. The remaining five would not pose any threat to song Qiming.

Xia ruofei’s main goal was to eliminate song Qiming’s safety threat. As for capturing him to do manual labor in the spirit map space, that was just a side goal.

He couldn’t waste his time here for five assassins.

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei removed the mental power from Bason and used it to shake him.

Bason immediately broke free from the state of hypnosis.

When he saw that he was in this abandoned warehouse, and Tina and the other two were in a strange state of being on guard and not moving at all, his expression changed drastically.

What happened during the hypnotism process also surfaced in his mind.

Devil ... Bason looked at Xia ruofei and thought.

Xia ruofei didn’t give him a chance to speak. He slapped Ong’s forehead lightly.

Ong didn’t even make a sound before he fell to the ground like a piece of rotten wood. His eyes protruded out and blood flowed out of his seven orifices. He was already dead by the time he fell to the ground.

To Bason, he only saw a blur. He seemed to see Xia ruofei’s hand waving in front of him. Then, his consciousness fell into eternal darkness ... Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Tina and the other two watched as Bason, who was supposed to be invincible, was killed by Xia ruofei without any resistance.

All of them lost their souls, and for the first time, they truly felt the threat of death.

Would they be next?

They had come rather late today, and there were at least seventy or eighty people in front of them. Had they all been killed by this demon? Where did the bodies of those people go?

It was definitely not near the warehouse. Tina and the other assassins were quite sensitive to the smell of blood. If there were really seventy or eighty dead people hiding here, they might have already noticed it from ten to twenty meters away.

Then where did these people go?

Just as Tina and the other two were in a mess, they saw Xia ruofei’s mocking face as he looked at them.

Tina and the other two trembled.

However, it was different from what they had expected. Xia ruofei’s attack did not come. They only felt an invisible pressure coming at them. It was as if their heads had exploded and they could not help but be dazed.

In this daze, the three of them felt the world spin around them, as if they had experienced the shifting of the stars. When their consciousness returned to normal, they were shocked to find that they were no longer in the warehouse.
