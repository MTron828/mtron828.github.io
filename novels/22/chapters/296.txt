“No problem!” Du Xiaohai quickly replied. But ... The mother trees are all on the cliff, and the path up is very narrow and steep. It’s not easy to walk!” “I’m fine with it,”Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Xia is very good,” elder song said with a smile.”Climbing the mountain won’t be a problem!” Hearing elder song’s words, du Xiaohai quickly instructed the director of the tea Bureau beside him,”Director ye, take Mr. Xia up for a tour. Make sure to keep him safe!” “Alright!” Director ye said immediately. “Sorry to trouble you ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “You’re welcome, you’re welcome!” Xia ruofei followed director ye and walked down the cliff. The Spring Festival had just ended, and it was the off – season for tourism. There were not many tourists in the scenic Area. Besides, there was a whole squad of armed police soldiers next to the teahouse. Besides, Xia ruofei had only left for a short while, so he did not have to worry about elder song’s safety. Several staff members of the tea Bureau were under the cliff, maintaining order with the armed police. Their main purpose was to prevent people from breaking in and causing security risks. They naturally wouldn’t stop director ye from personally bringing people over. There was a narrow path under the cliff. Director ye took the lead and stepped on the stone steps. “Slow down and watch your step,” he said as he turned around. Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and also stepped onto the stone steps. This path was very steep, and there were many places that required both hands and feet to pass through. Moreover, one had to stick close to the cliff to pass through. The cliff was right next to them, and they might fall down if they tripped. Therefore, if an ordinary person came over, their legs and stomach might really tremble. However, Xia ruofei walked as if he was walking on flat ground. To him, this kind of road was not difficult at all. After a short steep slope, the two of them passed by the stone carving with the words “Da Hong Pao” and came to a slightly protruding platform. There were four tea trees growing here. A little further ahead of this platform, there was an even smaller platform with a tea tree growing there. Further down, there was another tea tree, a total of six. “These six trees are the famous Da Hong Pao parent trees. The one closest to us is of the same origin as the one on the middle platform. The second tree on this side was of the same origin as the tea tree on the farthest lower platform. The Da Hong Pao tea leaves that are currently being sold in the market are all from the asexual reproduction process of these six trees. ” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He walked towards the tree closest to him. The staff had already finished trimming the four trees and moved them to the middle and lower platforms. The branches that had been trimmed from the four trees had been gathered by the staff and stacked under their respective trees. When he left, he must have taken these branches with him. “Director ye, can I go over and take a closer look?” Xia ruofei asked. “Of course you can, but the ground there isn’t very flat. You must be careful!” Director ye said quickly. If it was someone else who made this request, director ye would definitely not agree. Yingluo’s mother tree Da Hong Pao was too precious, and the city government had insured it for hundreds of millions of Chinese dollars! Furthermore, a professional technical team was maintained all year round to do the technical maintenance of these six mother trees, including trimming the branches and maintaining the ecological environment. However, Xia ruofei was elder song’s man. How could he reject director ye’s request? As long as he did not destroy the mother tree, he could look at it for as long as he wanted. Xia ruofei smiled and expressed his gratitude. Then, he walked to the first Da Hong Pao tree and observed it carefully. In fact, his mind was already locked on the pile of trimmed branches under the tree. These branches were piled up together. Xia ruofei intentionally or unintentionally blocked director ye’s view. Then, with a slight thought, the thicker branch at the bottom of the pile disappeared into thin air and reappeared in the space. Because these branches were all piled together, one branch missing at the bottom could not be seen from the outside. At this moment, Xia ruofei was very excited. At the same time, he was secretly glad that he had enough space to upgrade in time. It was only after the space had been upgraded that he could store items directly in the space without summoning the spirit map scroll. And it was also because of the upgrade of the space that he could directly store the target object into the space without touching it with his hand, provided that the target object was within two meters of him. It was because of all these factors that Xia ruofei was able to store the branches into the medium without anyone noticing. Xia ruofei took a total of three branches. After he was done “admiring” one tea tree, he turned to the next one. Soon, Xia ruofei stayed under the four tea trees for a while. From director ye’s perspective, Xia ruofei was only here to take a closer look at the legendary mother tree, Da Hong Pao. After all, young people were more curious. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had been very well – behaved the entire time. He had not touched the tea tree at all, so director ye was very assured. In fact, Xia ruofei had already successfully cut off some branches from the four trees and secretly stored them in his space. To be on the safe side, he took three branches from each tree. Xia ruofei was also very careful. He used his mind to control these branches and directed them to the iron cage that was used to cover the hornet’s nest in the new space. Firstly, the branches would not come into direct contact with the soil. In the medium, anything that did not come into direct contact with the soil would be kept fresh. It would not rot or go bad with the passage of time. Xia ruofei had confirmed this after many experiments. Secondly, the hornet’s nest was now a restricted area for Blackie and the others. After being attacked by the three hornet’s nest, Blackie and the others didn’t dare to get close to the iron cage. Therefore, the Da Hong Pao branch was the safest place to be. There was no need to worry about it being torn and destroyed by the naughty little dog. The biggest goal of this trip had been achieved. Xia ruofei could not suppress his joy. He tried to control his emotions and tried to appear calm. As for the two tea trees further away, Xia ruofei did not plan to go there. First of all, the staff was concentrated on trimming the branches, so it was impossible to remove the branches without anyone knowing. Secondly, director ye had already introduced that the two tea trees over there were of the same origin as the first and second tea trees over here, which meant that they were of the same species, so there was no need for him to take a few more branches. After watching for a while, Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to director ye and the two of them went down the same way.
