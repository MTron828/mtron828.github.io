Chapter 1928 A bolt out of the blue (1)

Dong Liu said to Da Liu,””Let’s go!”

Da Liu nodded and waved to his underlings. The group of them swaggered toward the door.

The head of security hesitated for a moment, then stood up and reached out to stop them.””You can’t ...”

He had only said a few words when Da Liu pushed him back a few steps.

Da Liu slowly put the cold Steel pipe on the security captain’s neck, and asked with a sneer on his face,””You want to keep us here with just the few of you? If you don’t want to break your arms and legs, then get lost!”

Da Liu’s unruly eyes made the security captain’s heart tremble, and he couldn’t help but shrink his neck.

After two seconds of silence, the security Captain finally waved his hand and motioned for the security guards to make way.

Their salaries were not high to begin with, so there was no need for them to fight to the death for this kind of thing. To put it bluntly, if they really ended up with broken arms and legs, they might even lose their jobs. No one would praise them for their bravery, but would only think that they were stupid.

Besides, even if they tried their best to stop them, would they be able to stop Da Liu and his men? The answer was no.

Therefore, the security Captain made a wise decision.

Da Liu put the steel pipe away and led Dong Liu and his men out of unit 1902.

Then Da Liu turned back and said,””Tell the security guards at the entrance to be smart. Don’t be stupid enough to stop us!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The head of security looked humiliated, but he still nodded silently.

After Liu Da and Liu Dong left, Fang Chenchen was still sitting on the ground in a daze. Her face was as pale as paper, and there was no life in her eyes.

The reporter, Liu Yuan, had already put some clothes on Fang Chenchen before she entered the room. As a woman herself, although she despised Fang Chenchen, she still felt that no matter what crime she had committed, she should at least have some clothes to cover her body and preserve her last bit of dignity in a room full of men.

Now, Liu Yuan felt a little sympathetic. She walked up to Fang Chenchen and patted her gently.””I’ve already called the ambulance. Let’s take your friend to the hospital first!”

Liu Yuan had not recognized Fang Chenchen yet.

Fang Chenchen lowered her head and replied with a dazed look,””Thank you ...”

Seeing this, Liu Yuan didn’t know what to say. She gave her companions a look, and everyone put away their machines and got ready to pack up. The material for today’s news was already complete. If they rushed back early to edit and sort it out, they could still make it in time for the news program at nineo’ clock in the evening.

Without waiting for the security Captain to speak, Liu Yuan said first,””We are reporters from Haixi satellite TV. We were informed to come here for an interview by the person involved. Don’t tell me you want to keep us here?”

Liu Yuan thought that the explosive phone call was made by Da Liu and the others, which explained why she could enter the community smoothly, and someone even gave her the elevator card. In her opinion, Da Liu, who had a trace of Bandit – like aura, should be able to do it.

The head of security opened his mouth, but the words changed when they reached his mouth. He said,””We don’t have the authority to detain him! This reporter, I hope that you will interview us through the proper channels in the future. It will be very difficult for us to do this today!”

“Okay, thank you for your reminder ...” Liu Yuan said with a smile.

They just wanted to find a way out, and Liu Yuan didn’t have to give them no face at all. If they were forced into a corner, even if the property management and security guards couldn’t do anything to them, they were still trouble! Besides, he was in a hurry to go back and edit the program!

The reporters had also left. The head of security then walked forward to check on Liu haojun.

Liu haojun’s breathing was steady, but his leg was swollen. It was obvious that he had fractured his leg. He had fainted from the pain just now, so his life should not be in danger.

The head of security heaved a sigh of relief and walked up to ask,””Madam, do you need any help?”

Fang Chenchen’s eyes were still dazed as she stared at a certain spot on the floor and said,””No need ... If the ambulance comes, please help guide them ...”

“No problem ...” The security Captain said.”In that case, we’ll go down first. If you need anything, you can call the property management at any time!”

Fang Chenchen nodded slightly and did not say anything else.

Seeing this, the head of security led the security guards out of Room 1902. The house that was in a mess just now became quiet again.

In the rental apartment in the old community opposite West Lake Mansion, Xu Yougang had been staring at the surveillance screen. He was worried that Fang Chenchen would not be able to take the shock and end her life.

This was what Xia ruofei had specifically instructed when he was making the plan.

Although Fang Chenchen was not worthy of sympathy, she did not deserve to die. Even if Fang Chenchen really wanted to commit suicide, this matter would blow up and Liu haojun would be in a situation beyond redemption, Xia ruofei had never thought of it.

On the contrary, he specifically instructed Xu Yougang to prevent such a situation from happening.

As such, Wang Chong was actually waiting for orders on the stairs between the 19th and 18th floor. If Fang Chenchen really showed signs of suicide, Xu Yougang could call for Wang Chong to stop her at any time.

At the same time, Xu Yougang also informed Zhang Aijun and Zeng Liang that they could return to the rental house.

They only needed to finish some of the finishing touches and pay attention to the program of Haixi TV. If today’s event was successfully broadcasted on the news program, Xia ruofei’s plan would basically be realized and the backup plan would be useless.
