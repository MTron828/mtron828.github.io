Chapter 1725: The noble rotten grapes (1)

“Xia,” Old West said,”this is the most perfect oak barrel I’ve ever seen in my decades of work. I don’t think it can be better! Old Carl’s technique of making the hooped barrel and the top – grade oak you provided really bring out the best in each other!”

“Uncle Wester, does this mean that these oak barrels have met the requirements?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Old West said with an exaggerated expression,””Of course! Old Carl’s unique symbol must have been under strict surveillance!”

This was equivalent to Carl’s brand, and old Carl would be fully responsible for any oak barrel that was branded with this .

“That’s great! Uncle Wester, I’ll take two of the wooden barrels. Leave the remaining four oak barrels at the winery!” Xia ruofei said happily,”Uncle Carl, you can pay for the barrel – making fees from the winery!”

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, Carl said without hesitation,””Xia, I’ll make these wooden barrels for you for free! As long as you can still give me this wood to process next year! I’ll also give you a discount on the cost of making barrels next year!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Uncle Carl, uncle Wester has so much trust in your technology. I’ll definitely let you make the oak barrels next year. However, you still have to pay for these six barrels. This is a separate matter!” There’s an old saying in China – brothers should settle their accounts clearly!”

After that, Xia ruofei did not wait for Carl to decline and gestured for Old West to write the check.

For a top – tier barrel – hugging craftsman like Carl, even if he provided the raw materials for him to process, the production cost would still be very high. It might even be more expensive than buying oak barrels directly from the market. However, Xia ruofei naturally did not care about such a small amount of money.

The production cost of each oak barrel was 300 Australian dollars. Old West quickly wrote a check for 1800 Australian dollars and handed it to Carl.

Seeing this, Carl didn’t reject it and accepted the money happily. Then, he reminded Xia ruofei to hand the order to him next year.

After Carl drove away, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing admired the oak barrel that Old West called ‘art’ for a while.

The two of them were laymen who came to watch the show. They looked at the oak barrel and touched it. They couldn’t see anything special about it, but they felt that the workmanship was really good. One look and they could tell that it was a very high – Class thing.

Old West actually wanted to keep all six oak barrels, especially when Xia ruofei wanted to take two barrels of clear grape juice. He was even more distressed.

The quality of the grapes this year was surprisingly good. In Old West’s eyes, Xia ruofei had taken away two barrels of grape juice. In the end, it would be a waste. To Old West, who had devoted himself to the winery business, this was a crime!

But Xia ruofei was the boss! Even if he wanted to pour all the grape juice this year into the drain, Old West couldn’t stop him, let alone take two buckets away!

So, when Xia ruofei suggested to prepare two barrels of clear grape juice, Old West accepted his fate and stood up to make the arrangements.

At that moment, Madam cabalie walked over with Old West’s phone.””Hey! Your phone! It’s from the Golden Oak winery!”

Old West took off his gloves and said to Xia ruofei,””Xia, wait a moment. I’ll take this call first!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

After Old West took the phone, he walked to the side to answer it. After a while, he came back with the phone and said,””Xia, I’m very sorry. There’s something I need to deal with at the Golden Oak winery. I’ll get cabalie to pack the clear grape juice you want for you!”

“Is there a problem with the Golden Oak tree?” Xia ruofei asked, concerned.

“Not really. The workers found a batch of grapes that are ready to be harvested is a little special. I have to go and take a look immediately.” Old West laughed with a hint of anticipation.”Maybe it’s a good thing!”

Xia ruofei became even more interested and said,””I might as well go and take a look! You can get the clear grape juice anytime you want!”

“Of course not,” Old West said readily.”You’re the boss!”

Xia ruofei smiled at Feng Rao and said,”how is it?” Sister ran, let’s go to the Golden Oak winery together?”

Feng Rao smiled and nodded. She mimicked Old West’s tone and said,””Of course, no problem. You’re the boss!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said,””You’re happy to be mischievous for a while, right?”

Feng Rao laughed so hard that she was shaking.

The group got into Old West’s old Horton car and drove to the Golden Oak winery.

Half an hour later, they arrived at the Golden Oak winery, which was also located in the Hunter Valley area.

Compared to West Winery, the Golden Oak winery was larger in scale and much newer in buildings. It was like the difference between a rich landlord and a long – term worker.

Before it was transferred to Xia ruofei, the Golden Oak winery was one of the largest wineries in the Hunter Valley area. It was not something that West Winery could compare to.

However, the winery was now surnamed Xia. The owner of the Golden Oak winery, Robinson, who had been full of superiority in front of Old West, had to accept the fact that the big winery he was so proud of was now under Old West’s management. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Old West drove the car directly to the vineyard, and the three of them got out of the car and walked in.
