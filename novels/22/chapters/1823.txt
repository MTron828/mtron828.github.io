Translator: 549690339

“Don’t worry!” Ling Qingxue said,”I promise I won’t burn down your kitchen!”

Xia ruofei was speechless. ‘How can I be at ease when you say that ...’

The two of them continued to cuddle for a while before Xia ruofei finally stepped out of the door.

When he arrived at the general office building, it was already very lively.

Two buses and two trucks were parked in front of the building, and the employees were loading plastic suitcases into the bus’s luggage compartment. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The sorting boxes were distributed by the company. Each of them was embedded with the name of the employee. They were mainly used to store everyone’s personal items. This way, it was convenient to load and transport the items without mixing them up.

As for the office equipment that needed to be moved to the new headquarters building, such as computers, printers, printers, fax machines, etc., As well as the accounts and reports from the finance department, they were sealed separately. Lei Hu and the Veterans from the security Department loaded them into the large trucks in an orderly manner.

Dong Yun was giving instructions on the scene. When she saw Xia ruofei, she immediately went up to him.

“Good Morning, Chairman!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s late!” Everyone has been busy for quite a while!”

“Have you arranged your work?” Xia ruofei asked.

“En!” Dong Yun nodded. President Feng will personally go to the peach blossom mansion to follow up on the opening ceremony, and I will be responsible for the clean – up work here!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you two female generals have a clear division of labor!” With you two capable assistants, it’s much easier for me!”

Dong Yun said humbly and then said,”Chairman, the relocation work here has basically been completed. The network and internal telephone in the building are all connected, and everyone’s work positions have been determined. After each department has their own duties, we can get back to work very soon! By the way, this is the new communication manual that corresponds to every employee’s work desk!”

Dong Yun said as she handed a small notebook to Xia ruofei. Then, she continued, “I’ve already sent the electronic version to your email. ”

Although everyone was used to adding WeChat groups when they worked, an internal phone was also necessary, and sometimes it was more efficient. Especially since Xia ruofei was the chairman. If he wanted an employee to meet him, he could not just shout “someone come to my office” in the WeChat group.

Xia ruofei took the communication manual and put it in his pocket. Then he asked,””How’s the arrangement at the building?”

“President Feng is personally overseeing things over there, so everything is fine!” Dong Yun replied. According to the plan, the vehicle would be parked on the open space on the east side of the building when it arrived. Then, the employees would get off the vehicle and gather in the small square in front of the building to attend the unveiling ceremony. After the ceremony ended, they would officially begin to enter with their personal items! We’ve made ample preparations in the early stages, so we only need half a day to get everything in place and officially start working!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”everyone has been very tired these few days. There’s no need to be so tight on time. The first two days are mainly to sort out the items and familiarize yourself with the new environment. Other than the e – commerce customer service and other positions that must be available at all times, the other work can be delayed!”

“Thank you for your understanding, Chairman!” Dong Yun said,”I’ve also made arrangements in advance for some of the positions that can’t be left. Some of the people will stay at the farm. When everything at the building is sorted out, these people will move over. This way, the work can be seamlessly connected!”

Xia ruofei nodded and praised,”not bad, not bad!” You’ve considered it very carefully!”

At this time, the employees had already loaded their belongings onto the bus. The office equipment that had been moved in advance had also been loaded onto the truck.

However, they didn’t get on the bus immediately. Instead, they lined up in front of the square and waited.

From the formation, it could be seen that everyone in the security Department was in high spirits. Every veteran held their heads high and the formation was very neat.

Although the other employees were also very excited, their lines were a little crooked, and there were people whispering to each other from time to time.

However, this was a company and not the military. Xia ruofei would not use the military’s rules on all his employees. Of course, he was very satisfied with the discipline of the security Department and could not help but look at Lei Hu and ye Lingyun with admiration.

“Chairman, we’re leaving soon. Can you say a few words to everyone?” Dong Yun said.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” It’s a good thing to move, I’ll give everyone some encouragement!”

Dong Yun nodded and quickly walked to the front of the queue. At this moment, the ordinary employees who were whispering to each other also quieted down and looked at Dong Yun.

“Everyone, let’s welcome the chairman with a round of applause!” Dong Yun cleared her throat and said.

Thunderous applause suddenly came from the queue. In the office building behind, the staff who stayed behind, including a few staff in the cafeteria, could not help but stick their heads out to look.

Xia ruofei was all smiles as he walked to the front of the line. He looked around and said,””My fellow colleagues!”

The security team immediately stood at attention. Xia ruofei was stunned at first, but then he smiled and said,””Please take it easy! Everyone, relax. We’re not in the Army anymore!”

The ordinary employees suddenly chuckled, but the security veterans still looked as calm as ever. They made a gesture of relief in unison. Even though they were at ease, everyone’s backs were still straight. Compared to the relaxed appearance of the ordinary employees, this side was more pleasing to the eye.

Xia ruofei said,”as everyone knows, we’ll be setting off in a while to work at the peach blossom building in the city center!” The Tao Yuan building was bought by the company not long ago, so the whole building is ours! Currently, only the 10th to 15th floor had been arranged, and the remaining nine floors were all empty! However, I don’t intend to rent it out, because I hope that in the near future, our paradise corporation’s employees will fill up the entire building! I hope that I’ll soon have to worry about the insufficient capacity of the headquarters!”

The employees immediately applauded enthusiastically. Each and every one of them was full of energy. The more lively employees even cheered loudly in the queue. The atmosphere was very warm.

Xia ruofei gestured with his hands and said,”the relocation of the headquarters this time is a new starting point for the company!” To everyone present, it was also a new set off! Our company grew from a small farm to today’s value of nearly two billion in just over a year! Let’s set a small goal here, okay? I hope that after a year, our company’s value can be tripled! Do you guys have the confidence?”

“There are!” All the employees were shouting loudly, their faces full of excitement.

Dong Yun couldn’t help but take a few more glances at Xia ruofei. She had heard that Xia ruofei was a retired soldier. However, after interacting with him for a while, she really couldn’t see any soldier’s temperament in this young Chairman. Instead, he was quite lazy and didn’t have the hard – working and resolute style of a soldier.

However, today, she seemed to have seen another side of Xia ruofei. Although the goal of tripling the value in a year seemed a little unrealistic to her, she had to admit that she was infected by Xia ruofei’s heroic spirit the moment he said it.

It was a simple pre – Mission speech, but Xia ruofei made it sound like a pre – war mobilization of the Army.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””It’s not enough for the company to grow. I hope that all of you will have a bigger stage to display your talents because of the company’s development. Of course, the company will not disappoint you. In short, follow me, Xia ruofei! There was meat to eat! Let’s not talk anymore, let’s go!”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, the crackling of firecrackers and the loud sound of gongs and drums filled the air. It was a festive and lively atmosphere.

The employees got on the bus in an orderly manner. Xia ruofei also got on the first bus.

Soon, four cars with their double flashing lights drove out of the gate of Tao Yuan farm in a single file, driving towards the new starting point of the Tao Yuan company.
