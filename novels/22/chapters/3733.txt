3734 A bold inference (2)

Xia ruofei couldn't help but find it funny. It seemed that this senior in front of him was also one of the "best"!

"Then ... If master was still in the human world, what level would his cultivation have reached?" Xia ruofei continued to ask.

Senior copper coffin looked a little embarrassed and said, "If Shanhe wasn't seriously injured like me and his strength wasn't greatly affected, he should have reached the primordial soul realm at the very least after so many years. He might even have reached the leaving aperture realm...Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

Speaking of this, senior copper coffin couldn't help but let out a long sigh and said,""The battle a few hundred years ago really took a toll on my vitality. For so many years, I've basically made no progress... No! To be more precise, my strength has been greatly damaged. Even if I recover my cultivation before I was injured, it will be an extremely difficult thing for me."

Xia ruofei understood. It seemed that this senior had been recovering from his injuries all these years. Naturally, he had put less energy into his cultivation. This was something that could not be helped.

From the looks of it, the senior in the coffin should be around the early stage of the original level. He had not fully recovered to the middle stage of the original level, but he should not have fallen to the Golden core stage. Otherwise, he would not have been able to suppress the spirit body.

Xia ruofei couldn't help but be alert. This copper coffin senior was as famous as immortal mountain river back then. He must have been an outstanding talent. However, because of a serious injury, he had to waste hundreds of years. His strength had declined instead of improving. This was a heavy lesson.

When he was in the Army, Xia ruofei would often listen to the leaders 'teachings."Don't treat other people's accidents as stories, or you might be the next one to get into an accident!

Therefore, Xia ruofei was deeply touched by the matter of senior copper coffin. At the same time, he secretly warned himself that it was better to be careful than to sail a ship for ten thousand years. He could not get carried away at any time, or else he might lose everything if he took a wrong step.

"Senior uncle Zhao, how long will it take for you to recover from your injuries?" Xia ruofei asked after some thought.

Senior copper coffin revealed a bitter smile and said, "It's easier said than done to recover completely. However, after two to three hundred years of hard work, I've finally recovered most of my injuries. I estimate that in another three to five years, I won't need the yin Qi here to suppress my injuries and will be able to recover to 90% of my previous strength. I can only rely on myself to slowly repair the rest. However, I will be able to leave this damned place by then."

"Then I wish you a speedy recovery, uncle Zhao!" Xia ruofei nodded.

Once this copper coffin senior ended his 300 - year seclusion, it would mean that there would be another mid - Stage nascent soul cultivator in the world of cultivation. At that time, Chen Nanfeng and the first heaven society would no longer be the only dominant force.

However, three to five years was nothing to senior copper coffin. He had persevered for hundreds of years, so three to five years would pass in the blink of an eye.

Senior copper coffin laughed and said,"thanks for your kind words!" Thank you! Thank you ... Nephew, I see that your cultivation is improving at a godly speed. Perhaps in three to five years, when I come out of seclusion, your cultivation will have already surpassed mine!"

Xia ruofei said,"uncle - Master Zhao, you may not know this, but the cultivation environment on earth is very harsh now. Cultivation has become a very difficult thing. Let alone mid - Stage or late - Stage nascent soul realm, even if you can break through to the early - Stage nascent soul realm, you'll be a peerless master." So far, only Chen Nanfeng, the sect master of the first heaven sect, has done it." Xia ruofei couldn't help but look worried."Uncle - Master Zhao, the cultivation world on earth is in such a terrible state. That means... My master and the other leaving aperture stage cultivators 'trip to the moon didn't go well ... The environment on earth is still deteriorating!"
