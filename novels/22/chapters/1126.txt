Chapter 1127: The fake can’t be real (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xu Qiang’s eyes widened. He thought to himself that this fatty an was too insensible. He kept on pestering him about this matter. What good would come out of offending brother Jun?

“Boss an, it’s my freedom to buy it or not!” Xu Qiang said in a muffled voice,”I only asked you to bring something over for me to inspect. I never said that I had to buy it!”

Fatty an and Wang xingshui looked at each other. They didn’t know what kind of medicine Xu Qiang had taken to be so afraid of Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei. Their simple words had made him decide not to take them.

One must know that Xu Qiang was already very tempted just now and had almost made the decision to buy it.

Fatty an and Wang Xinshui were naturally filled with resentment towards Xia ruofei. Fatty an, who had a kind look, was still fine, but Wang xingshui was much worse at hiding it. His honest farmer’s outfit revealed a ruthlessness that did not match his identity.

Xia ruofei saw Wang xingshui’s expression and just laughed in disdain.

At this time, Guo Ruchen, who had been silent all this time, laughed and said,””Why don’t you all calm down? since this little brother Xia has made such a judgment with such confidence, he should be confident. Why don’t you let him say it?”

“Old Guo ...” Zhao Yongjun frowned.

He knew that Xia ruofei had never come into contact with the antique business. There were too many tricks in this business. Even he himself was not sure that it would not be an eye – opener, so what could a layman like Xia ruofei say?

Xia ruofei didn’t want to put Zhao Yongjun in a difficult position, so he smiled and walked to the wooden incense cabinet. He said confidently,””Since elder Guo has said so, then I’ll tell you my judgment!”

“Ruofei ...” Zhao Yongjun lightly tugged on Xia ruofei’s sleeve.

He was worried that Xia ruofei was young and impetuous. If he couldn’t say anything, he would become a laughing stock.

Everyone in this room was an expert! Of course, except for song Rui and that silly – looking Wang xingshui.

Xia ruofei waved at Zhao Yongjun and said,””Don’t worry, big brother Zhao. I have my reasons for saying that!”

“Alright then!” Zhao Yongjun said helplessly.

Xia ruofei pointed at the incense cabinet made of Yingzi wood and said firmly,””This incense cabinet is indeed made of Yingzi wood, and some of it is even made of wood from the Ming Dynasty, which can easily mislead the appraisers. But a fake is a fake, no matter how real it is, it is still a fake! In fact, this incense cabinet was pieced together. Except for the top and the front, which were made of old materials from the Ming Dynasty, the rest of the cabinet was made of new materials!”

As soon as Xia ruofei said this, fatty an and Wang xingshui’s faces changed.

Xia ruofei looked at the two of them meaningfully. It was obvious that he was right. Otherwise, they would not have such a big reaction.

Xia ruofei’s heart also calmed down a little. It seemed that Xia Qing’s judgment was still reliable.

Following that, Xia ruofei followed Xia Qing’s instructions and spoke with confidence,””In fact, the two sides, the back, and the bottom are all made of new materials, which are burned with fire alkali. But the old technique is more exquisite, and the most conspicuous part is the genuine old material, so it is easy to pass the fake as the real one!”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, Zhao Yongjun, Guo Ruchen, and Xu Qiang immediately went to the cabinet to take a closer look. Even song Rui widened his eyes and looked at it. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Although the three of them were not good at identifying wooden items, they were experienced and knowledgeable. With Xia ruofei’s reminder, they more or less found some traces of fraud.

Of course, this was because he had already made a preconceived judgment and had specifically investigated the problem, which was why it was so easy to find. In the beginning, they didn’t see any problems. After all, the forgery technique was quite advanced.

“Sure enough, there are traces of it being old ...” Xu Qiang muttered.

Guo Ruchen and Zhao Yongjun also looked at Xia ruofei in surprise, feeling that it was a little unbelievable.

Especially Zhao Yongjun, who found it even more unbelievable. After all, he knew that Xia ruofei had never touched antiques before. How could he have a better eye than the old players who had been in pan Jiayuan and Liulichang all year round?

However, what surprised them even more was yet to come.

Xia ruofei smiled and continued,””In addition to the problem with the materials used, there are actually a few flaws that can also show traces of fraud!”

“What?” Guo Ruchen cried out.

“Ruofei, tell us quickly, let us learn something!” Zhao Yongjun quickly said.

Fatty an and Wang xingshui’s faces alternated between red and white. Their eyes were constantly flickering, and no one knew what they were thinking.

“Everyone knows about ‘hanging dust’, right?” Xia ruofei said with confidence.

“Of course, there’s usually a layer of dust at the back of old furniture to prevent moisture!” Zhao Yongjun immediately said.

Xia ruofei pointed at the cabinet and said,””Take a closer look at the ash on the back and the bottom. Don’t they look almost the same? “But this is an obvious flaw. One side is against the wall, while the other side is against the ground. The degree of moisture and peeling will definitely be different over hundreds of years. There is only one possibility for the ash to have almost the same effect, and that is that it was artificially added later!”

Just as Zhao Yongjun and the others were busy comparing the dust on both sides, Xia ruofei continued,””There’s also a problem with the copper work on the top. The wooden frame of the Ming Dynasty was hollowed out. After the nails were inserted, the roots would be separately embedded into the wooden grooves. This is a necessary process. The workmanship inside this cabinet is obviously much rougher, so it must be fake!”

Zhao Yongjun, Guo Ruchen, and the others had just finished looking at the hanging ash. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, they immediately turned to look at the location Xia ruofei had mentioned and found the flaw as well.

These flaws were actually not too obvious. Unless one had a deep understanding of wooden artifacts and observed them very carefully, they would not be able to discover them.

Zhao Yongjun and the other two couldn’t help but click their tongues in wonder, while fatty an and Wang xingshui’s hearts sank to the bottom.

In fact, these two people often set up games to cheat money, but every time they planned it very well, and their level of forgery was high. Almost every time, they succeeded, and many people had not even found out that they had received a fake.

Therefore, when fatty an heard that Xu Qiang was suddenly interested in wooden weapons, he had carefully planned this scheme. He did not expect that Xia ruofei would ruin it.

Their incense cabinet’s level of forgery had already reached the peak. Basically, Xia ruofei had already pointed out the few places where there might be a slight flaw.

What puzzled them even more was that Xia ruofei did not even go close to check the incense cabinet. He only looked at it from a distance, but it was as if he had gone closer to check it inch by inch. He accurately pointed out the flaw in the incense cabinet.

This made fatty an and Wang Xinshui feel that the whole thing was evil.

After Guo Ruchen looked at the incense cabinet carefully, he sighed with emotion.””I’m impressed! Heroes really come from youngsters! Boss Zhao, this friend of yours is really something!”

Zhao Yongjun was happier to hear Xia ruofei being praised by the Vice President of the antique Association. He grinned.””Hahaha! RUO Fei’s abilities are great. It seems like there’s nothing he doesn’t know!”

“President Guo, you’re too kind,” Xia ruofei smiled.

Zhao Yongjun was his good friend, so he could accept any praise. However, Guo Ruchen was the Vice President of the capital’s antique Association. He was also an old man, so Xia ruofei had to be polite.

Xu Qiang bowed to Xia ruofei sincerely and said,””Master Xia, it’s all thanks to you this time! Otherwise, I’ll have to suffer in silence today!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Qiangzi, you’re brother Zhao’s friend. Since I’ve noticed the problem, I can’t just stand by and do nothing!”

“I’ll remember young master Xia’s kindness!” Xu Qiang said gratefully. Then, he turned to fatty an and Wang xingshui, his eyes cold.
