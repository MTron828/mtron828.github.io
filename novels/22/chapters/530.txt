Chapter 531: Raising the prestige of our country (3)

Xia ruofei, who was leaning on the bed, jumped up and ran to the door. He opened the door and was stunned ...

Monica was standing at the door in a pink bathrobe. Her hair was wet, and she had clearly just taken a shower.

“Xia, I knew you weren’t asleep yet ...” Monica said with a smile.

Xia ruofei could feel his heart beating faster. He asked with a dry mouth,””Uh ... Monica, it’s so late. What’s the matter?”

Monica, who had just taken a shower, was still blushing. She revealed a charming smile and said,””Xia, I suddenly remembered that uncle Carter gave you a few bottles of good wine. Are you willing to share the neighbors” gifts with me?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and then said,””Of course! Please come in!”

Xia ruofei stepped aside and Monica walked past him, bringing with her a fragrant scent.

“Please sit!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he fumbled for two wine glasses and opened the half – llon that Carter had given him. He poured some wine into the two glasses.

The two of them sat on both sides of the small coffee table in front of the floor – to – Ceiling window and touched their glasses gently.

Xia ruofei took a sip, but Monica drank it all in one gulp. She even showed Xia ruofei the bottom of her glass like a Chinese person drinking. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and finished his glass in one gulp.

Monica giggled and gave Xia ruofei a thumbs – up.

They continued to pour wine and chatted as they drank, continuing the topic of the day.

Most of the time, it was still Xia ruofei talking while Monica listened very carefully. Sometimes, she would be tickled by Xia ruofei’s words and even the hem of her bathrobe would pull up a lot, revealing a section of her snow – White thighs. She didn’t even notice.

Although Semillon had a very low alcohol content when it was first brewed, the contents of the bottle were completely different after 20 years of maturity. The two of them could not help but feel a little tipsy while drinking.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice that Monica, who was laughing happily, would sometimes look sad and hesitant.

Before she knew it, the three bottles of half – Lon that Carter had given Xia ruofei had all been opened. She had also finished half of the third bottle. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Although Xia ruofei’s alcohol tolerance was amazing, he mostly drank white wine. A 20 – year – old Semillon still had a strong aftereffect, so even his face started to blush and his head started to feel a little dizzy.

Beside Xia ruofei, Monica’s cheeks were like peach blossoms, and her beautiful blue eyes became even more blurred.

After Xia ruofei and Monica finished their glasses of wine, he lowered his head to get the bottle of wine and was about to pour more. Suddenly, he smelled a fragrance. When he reacted, Monica was already sitting on his lap. Her delicate face was blushing as she looked straight at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei felt as if his brain had exploded and he was dizzy.

To be honest, ever since Xia ruofei had been taking the body tempering soup, he had become more energetic in the matters between men and women. His fighting power had also increased day by day. Moreover, he and Ling Qingxue were not spending a long time together. They only met every once in a while to talk about how they missed each other. Hence, Xia ruofei’s desire in this area was more or less suppressed.

Moreover, he had drunk quite a lot of alcohol today. Monica’s obviously provocative action was like pouring a ladle of hot oil into a raging fire, causing Xia ruofei’s remaining rationality to disappear.

Monica reached out her fingers and gently hooked Xia ruofei’s chin. She threw Xia ruofei a flirtatious look and leaned over to kiss him without saying anything.

The last bit of Xia ruofei’s rationality was gone.

“It shouldn’t be a big deal to indulge once in a while, right?” Xia ruofei thought to himself,”the Westerners should be very open – minded in this aspect ...”

With his own excuse, Xia ruofei’s thoughts seemed to have cleared up. His big hands pressed onto Monica’s perky butt without hesitation.

Monica’s reaction seemed to be even more intense than Xia ruofei ‘s. After the two of them stood up, she pushed Xia ruofei onto the bed and sat down impatiently.

Brother, is this considered as raising the prestige of our country?

But why did it seem like I was the one who was pushed down ...
