Eccentric song chuckled and nodded, “I’ve been living in the three mountains for a long time! Now that my body has basically recovered, I’m considering going back to the capital. After all, living here will cause trouble for our comrades in the central government and other places!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s good to go back. After all, the three mountains is now a new city. It’s very hot in the summer. It’s not as comfortable as the weather in the capital.”

“That’s right!”Elder song laughed. My old comrades also talk about me all day long. Old Zhu even clamored to play a few games with me every day! This old man, I heard that when I’m not in the capital, he claims to be the king, saying that no one can defeat him. Isn’t this like when the Tiger is not at home, the monkey will claim to be the king?”

Xia ruofei, manager Lu, and the others all had strange expressions.

They all knew that old Zhu was also a retired general. Although he didn’t reach old song’s level before his retirement, he was still a famous Tiger General in the Army.

Elder song could joke around without any qualms, but Xia ruofei and the others couldn’t casually respond to him. Otherwise, it would be disrespectful.

Manager Lu personally poured wine for everyone, and then everyone looked at elder song, waiting for him to speak.

Elder song chuckled as he raised his wine cup. “We’re all family today, so there’s no need to be so formal! Everyone, let’s raise our glasses!”

After elder song brought the first glass of wine, everyone began to eat and chat. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The seating arrangement in the restaurant was as such: Elder song sat in the middle, and on his left and right were Xia ruofei and Tian Huilan. Manager Lu might have a high rank, but he was seated opposite the main seat. There was an empty seat beside Tian Huilan, and it was a seat with a set of chopsticks.

However, since elder song didn’t say anything, Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t ask.

He raised his glass and said with a smile,””Chief, remember to do regular health checks after you return to the capital. If you feel uncomfortable, contact me at any time!”

Elder song laughed and clinked his glass with Xia ruofei ‘s.”Okay, okay, okay. Now, your words are the doctor’s advice. Old men like us are not afraid of anything, but the primary care doctor!”

Manager Lu and Tian Huilan couldn’t help but smile when they heard this.

Elder song and the other old Chiefs were assigned a full – time health care team by the country. From the perspective of the chief’s health, the doctors had very strict plans for his daily work, rest, diet, and other aspects. Moreover, the health care doctors assigned to the chief were basically the kind of people who were one – Track minded and would never listen to the unreasonable requests of the old Chiefs.

Elder song would always empty his glass when Xia ruofei gave him a toast. This time was no different. He raised his head and finished the rest of the wine in his glass. Then, he said emotionally,”Little Xia! This old man’s life is all thanks to you! You can be said to have pulled me back from the gates of hell. I won’t say any more words of gratitude, but if you need anything in the future, feel free to look for me. As long as your company is operating legally, no matter what kind of trouble you face, we will always be your strong backing!”

Xia ruofei was very touched. He quickly poured himself another glass of wine and finished it in front of elder song.”Thank you, chief!”

Manager Lu and Tian Huilan were also slightly moved.

Generally, people at elder song’s level would not reveal anything. It was rare for him to be so direct.

After chatting for a while, Tian Huilan suddenly took the initiative to raise her glass to Xia ruofei. She smiled and said,”Ruofei, let’s have a drink too!”

Xia ruofei quickly stood up, picked up his cup and said,””Secretary Tian, I should be the one toasting you!”

Tian Huilan chuckled and said,”I should toast you with this glass of wine. If you hadn’t treated him in time, my father might have passed away. You’ve helped Youyou and Huixin’s family during this period of time. Our family owes you countless favors.”

Xia ruofei laughed in embarrassment.”Secretary Tian, it’s all in the past. Besides, didn’t you all already thank me?”

Xia ruofei also felt a little strange. Why did Tian Huilan bring up the past again today? and in front of elder song, too. She said it so formally, as if it was a farewell drink.

Unexpectedly, Tian Huilan seemed to have heard Xia ruofei’s inner grumble. She smiled and said,””RUO Fei! This cup of wine is also to bid you farewell. I’ll be leaving the three mountains in two days ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but open his mouth in shock.

Tian Huilan had just been promoted to the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Party Committee of Sanshan city only a few months ago. Why would she suddenly be transferred out of Sanshan? Could it be that there was a problem at work?

Manager Lu explained with a smile,””Xiao Xia, Secretary Tian is about to be appointed as the Deputy Director of xxx. The relevant procedures have been completed, and she should be taking office in a day or two.”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he quickly raised his glass and said,””Secretary Tian, congratulations to Gao Sheng!”

Tian Huilan was clearly very happy, but she only smiled and said,””It’s not a promotion. It’s just a normal job transfer, and there’s no change in rank.”

“That’s different!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re going to take on an important leadership position in the Ministry this time. You’ll be given an important role!”

“I’m serving the people wherever I go,”Tian Huilan said with a smile.” But when I go to the capital, I’m most worried about Youyou, other than my father ...”

At this point, Tian Huilan couldn’t help but sigh.

She and the song family had originally intended to match Lu You and song Rui together. However, after Xia ruofei had asked them to use a delaying tactic, the two families gradually realized that these two young people who were extremely suitable for each other in politics had no interest in each other at all.

In layman’s terms, there was no electricity at all.

Although no one said it clearly, they were very clear in their hearts that if this matter dragged on, it could only be left unsettled in the end.

If this had happened in any other wealthy family, the two juniors might not have had any room to resist at all. The family would have directly made the decision.

However, the song family was slightly different. When it came to the marriage of his children, although elder song also pursued marriage of equal social status, he respected everyone’s opinions and would not engage in arranged marriage.

Xia ruofei felt a little guilty. He was the one who had taught them to go against their family and drag things out.

“Secretary Tian, Lu You is already in University. Professor Tian is also in the University. You don’t have to worry too much.” Xia ruofei said.

“We’ve spoiled Youyou, and she has a bad temper. I’m just worried that she’ll cause me more trouble without me by her side!” Tian Huilan smiled bitterly and said,”RUO Fei! I think she can still talk to you ...”

“Well ... We’re pretty good friends!” Xia ruofei said awkwardly.

“Then you should talk to her more often when you have time and remind her of anything. I feel that she can still listen to you.” Tian Huilan said.

“I’ll try my best, Secretary Tian!”Xia ruofei scratched his head. Actually ... I haven’t seen Lu You in a long time. ”

“Then you can ask her out to play!” Tian Huilan said,”you two are of the same age. You should have many common topics ...”

Xia ruofei suddenly felt a headache and did not know what to say.

Elder song looked at Xia ruofei with a smile and seemed to have a deeper meaning.

Just as Xia ruofei was feeling extremely awkward, a staff member came to his rescue.

The staff member quickly came in and reported,””Bureau chief, Secretary song is here!”

Eccentric song raised his eyebrows and smiled.”This little song, he’s so late, he has to drink a few more glasses of wine as punishment! Let him in!”

“Alright!”

After a short while, Xia ruofei saw a middle – aged man in his forties being led to the dining room by the staff.

The middle – aged man was wearing a white shirt and navy blue trousers. He was burly and had a square face. He walked with an imposing manner, with a trace of righteousness and Majesty on his face. One look and one could tell that he was a person of high status.

However, this Secretary song was not a leader in front of elder song. He walked over to elder song and bowed slightly. “I’m sorry, chief. The plane was a little late, so I’m late!”

“Have a seat!” Elder song said with a smile. If you’re late, take the initiative and drink three cups as a punishment!”

“Yes!” Secretary song said immediately.

He came to the seat next to Tian Huilan and nodded slightly to her and manager Lu. He didn’t sit down, but stood there and poured three glasses of white wine into an empty glass on the table.

“Chief, I’m late. I’ll drink three glasses as punishment!” He said as he raised his glass.

After speaking, Secretary song raised his head and drank the large glass of white wine. After swallowing it in one gulp, he showed the bottom of the glass to everyone.

“Well, you’re a decent man. Have a seat!” Elder song said with a smile.

“Thank you, chief!” Secretary song quickly bowed and sat down.

“Qiming!” Elder song said. You’re already familiar with Huilan and Xiao Lu. Let me introduce you to Xiao Xia!”

Then, elder song pointed at Xia ruofei and said,””Little Xia is my Savior! Even the experts in 301 couldn’t do anything. It was Xiao Xia who snatched me back from the King of Hell!”

Secretary song noticed Xia ruofei the moment he entered the room. After all, Xia ruofei was too young. He was particularly eye – catching when he sat beside elder song.

Now that Secretary song knew that Xia ruofei and elder song had such a relationship, he quickly greeted Xia ruofei with great enthusiasm.

Xia ruofei did not know where Secretary song came from, so he just smiled and nodded at him politely.

Elder song continued,”Xiao Xia, Qiming is the newly appointed Deputy Minister of the southeast province. At the same time, the organization has decided that he will take over the position of comrade Huilan. You have to respect your parents!”

Xia ruofei immediately understood why elder song had invited him to the dinner ...
