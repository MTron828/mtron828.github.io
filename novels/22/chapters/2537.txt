Mark Rocca still remembered that a few days ago, when the two of them were competing in free kicks, they still had to communicate through Jiang Xiaochen’s translation. Xia ruofei suddenly greeted him in Spanish, and her pronunciation was quite accurate, which made him feel like he was dreaming.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve learned some simple Spanish these few days. I can barely communicate with them.”

Wu Lei, who was beside him, looked at Xia ruofei with a hopeless expression and asked,””Brother Xia, what are you talking about?”

He had arrived Spain a few days earlier than Xia ruofei and had been studying Spanish all this time. Every day, after training and competitions, he would return to the hotel and attend at least one to two hours of Spanish lessons.

However, up until now, Wu Lei had only learned some very simple words and rote memorization of a few football terms. For example, in the conversation between Xia ruofei and markelka, he only heard the word “Good Morning”.

Besides, Wu Lei knew very well that Xia ruofei had only started learning Spanish for three days, and he had already reached such a level.

Xia ruofei had never played professional football for a day. It was already depressing enough that he was better at free kicks than Xia ruofei, who had received systematic training since he was young. Now, even his language talent was so much worse than his. How could he live?

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s just a simple greeting!” Lei Zi, you have to work hard on your Spanish. If you want to gain a foothold in the team in the future, it’s necessary to communicate with your teammates!”

Wu Lei said gloomily,”brother Xia, it’s not that I’m not working hard enough, but you’re too outstanding ... How did you raise your Western language level from zero to this level in three days?” Isn’t your language talent a little too scary? Why are you so outstanding in everything you do? Could it be that you saved the Milky Way in your past life? Standing next to you, the sense of defeat is too serious!”

“As long as you work hard enough, you can do it too!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Wu Lei was speechless for a while. He thought to himself,”I don’t see you working so hard! Didn’t you just flip through the pages of the Western dictionary and mumble a few words to the video tutorial these few days? A talented person was a talented person ...

Xia ruofei looked at markelka, who was also dumbfounded. He had no idea what they were talking about.

“Wu is asking me about Western language!” Xia ruofei smiled and explained. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Markelka gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up and said,””Mr. Xia, you’re the most talented speaker I’ve ever seen, no one else!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”you flatter me!” Rocca, go and change your clothes! We’ll go to the training ground first!”

“Wait!” Markelka quickly said. Mr. Xia, I was just about to ask! You’re wearing this today because ...”

Xia ruofei’s contract with Espanyol had always been kept a secret. Other than the club’s management and the head coach, Wu Lei was the only one among the players who knew about it.

Although the Spain sports media’s reports on the signing caused a wave of heated discussion in China, it did not actually cause any waves in Spain. It was just a few articles in the newspaper. Moreover, the players did not pay much attention to such news, so no one on the team knew that Xia ruofei had become their “special teammate.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’ll know soon!” Go change your clothes first! Maybe I’ll give you a surprise later!”

Since Xia ruofei was going to play in the away game against Valencia, and he had to attend training today, the coaching staff would naturally announce his joining of the team, so everyone would know about it by then.

With a dumbfounded look, markroka nodded and went straight to the locker room. Xia ruofei and Wu Lei jogged to the training ground to warm up.

Xia ruofei and Wu Lei jogged around the training ground to warm up. After a while, mark Roca joined them.

Soon, the team members arrived at the training ground one after another. When they saw Xia ruofei in the training uniform, their expressions were the same as markeloka ‘s, dumbfounded.

However, the coaching staff quickly answered everyone’s doubts.

Before the training officially began, Ruby gathered everyone and said,””I have something to announce to everyone! From now on, Mr. Xia will be a member of the team. He will wear the number 25 Jersey and fight alongside everyone!”

As soon as Ruby said this, the Spanish first team players could not help but be dumbfounded, their faces full of disbelief.

One was a high – Level executive in a suit and leather shoes, and the other was a professional player who often sweated and exuded the smell of hormones. How could these two identities be connected?

Ruby continued,”of course, Mr. Xia is busy with work. He can’t stay on the team all the time, so he will only play for the Spanish club in some key games. In two days, Mr. Xia will contribute to the team with his exquisite free kick skills in our away game against Valencia!”

After Ruby finished speaking, everyone finally came back to their senses and quickly applauded Xia ruofei’s arrival.
