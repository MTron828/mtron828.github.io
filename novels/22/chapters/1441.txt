Chapter 1442: Dong Yun’s visit (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””I accidentally got a small injury, it’s nothing serious ...”

“What’s going on?” Feng Rao saw that Xia ruofei’s hands were tightly wrapped and knew that it was not as simple as Xia ruofei had said.

Seeing that Feng Jing was asking, Xia ruofei did not hide anything and simply recounted what had happened at the grilled fish shop that afternoon.

Then he shrugged and said,”it’s just this matter. Actually, it’s nothing. It’ll be fine in a few days ...”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but turn pale when she heard this.”RUO Fei, this is nothing? Do you know how hot that stone pot is? You’re already so old, why are you still showing off?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sister che, look at how nervous you are. It’s really nothing. I’m quick to react. The stone pot was in my hand for less than a second. How could it have been seriously injured?”

“Let me see!” Feng Rao came forward to check on Xia ruofei’s injury.

Xia ruofei quickly raised his hand to avoid it and said,””Sister che, it’s really nothing! There’s no need to look at it ... Besides, it’s just been bandaged, it’s too troublesome to untie it again. ”

He definitely couldn’t let Feng Rao remove the bandages, or else he would be exposed.

Feng Rao seemed to have realized that her actions were a little too intimate. She blushed and said,””Don’t force yourself! If you really can’t handle it, go to the hospital!”

“I know,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.”I know what to do.”

Feng Rao nodded and did not say anything else.

Xia ruofei had been injured on a date with his girlfriend. Feng Jing felt that it was inappropriate for her to say too much, so she could only suppress her concern.

The two of them walked into the living room of the villa. Xia ruofei first walked over to feed the red Arowana, then took out the secret Da Hong Pao from the tea cabinet next to him and sat down at the root – carved tea tray.

Although he could only use one hand, Xia ruofei was still very familiar with the process of making tea.

“Sister ran, why did you suddenly come over tonight?” Xia ruofei poured tea with one hand and asked with a smile.

Feng Rao was slightly surprised and said,”Yup! I have bad news ...”

“Don’t say it yet, I’ll make a guess!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”is it about the company? Dong Yun rejected us?”

The company’s current development momentum was quite good. The only bad news was the lack of talent. Although the Vice President position was temporarily vacant, there was no clear target for it. The only position that was planned to be the Chief Administrative Officer was Dong Yun.

“Yeah!” Feng Rao said with a bitter smile. I’ve had a face – to – Face meeting with her today, and I can see that she’s not interested in our company. She’s obviously a very opinionated person, so I personally think there’s no hope of recruiting her. We’d better make plans early. ”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It seems like this overseas returnee has quite a high standard. Is our company not worthy of her attention?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Not exactly!” Feng Jing laughed and said,”she’s quite honest. Maybe it’s because of her career plan ...”

As for her sense of achievement, Feng Jing was still in a state of confusion, so she didn’t go too deep into the topic.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”then let’s keep looking!” On one hand, we have to get the company’s top management as soon as possible, and on the other hand, we absolutely can’t make up the number with just a few. ”

“Yeah ...” Feng Jing said.”I’ll keep an eye on this. I’ve been personally following up with the Headhunters ...”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but add,””Dong Yun is actually very suitable for this position. She would have no problem becoming the Vice President in the future, but unfortunately ...”

“Since the two sides are not fated, then there is nothing to be regretful about.” Xia ruofei said freely.

At this moment, Feng Jing’s phone rang.

She did not avoid Xia ruofei and took out her phone to look at the caller ID.

Feng Rao’s face revealed a strange expression. She raised her head and said, “It’s dong Yun ...”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei said with interest,”did she change her mind?” Take it and hear what she has to say. ”

Feng Jing nodded and picked up the phone.””Good evening, miss Dong!”

Dong Yun’s voice was a little hesitant as she said,”President Feng, I’d like to know the contact information of your company’s Chairman Xia ...”

Feng Rao was stunned when she heard this. She looked at Xia ruofei in shock. After a while, she came back to her senses and smiled.”Of course, no problem. But may I ask why miss Dong is looking for our Chairman?”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows.

It seems like Dong Yun wants to find me? But I don’t even know her!

Xia ruofei was not narcissistic enough to think that his charm could defeat anyone of his age group. Even Dong Yun, whom he had never met before, was his fan.

If that was the case, Dong Yun wouldn’t have rejected Feng Jing’s invitation so firmly today.

Dong Yun seemed to hesitate for a moment on the other end of the phone before saying,”I ... Have some personal matters that I would like to visit you for. I wonder if it’s convenient?”

“Yes, yes!” Feng Rao immediately replied. Our President Xia is always free! You can come to the farm directly, call me when you’re there!”
