After everyone had laughed, aunt kabeli looked worried and said to Xia ruofei,”Xia, Robinson’s Golden Oak winery is the largest in the Hunter Valley area, and he’s also the director of the Hunter Valley wine Association. I’m worried that he’ll suppress you in business if you offend him.”

“Robinson is a narrow – minded person,” Old West said with a frown.”He used to play dirty tricks on our West Winery, but our winery has a deep foundation, so he didn’t have many good ideas ...”

Xia ruofei said easily,”uncle Carter, since he can’t do anything to you, why should I be worried?” The West Winery only has a new owner. Aren’t you and Auntie cabalie still in charge of the management?”

Old Wester was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said,””That makes sense! We’re not afraid of him!”

Auntie caitley also smiled, but there was still a trace of worry on her face.

Of course, she didn’t say anything more and went back to the kitchen to prepare dinner.

Xia ruofei and the others sat in the living room and laughed as they talked about what had happened. Especially when Liang Qichao asked about Old West’s past, it made everyone laugh.

Very quickly, Madam Capella had prepared a sumptuous dinner. Everyone sat around, and old West opened two bottles of wine that had been aged for 20 years. The wine was almost the signature of the West Winery, and the two bottles were 20 years old. The flavors of the wine would become richer and more unique.

It was still the traditional Australian cuisine, but Auntie Capella’s cooking skills were obviously quite good. The fragrant food was appetizing.

Old West quickly opened the Semillon and poured half a cup for everyone.

Then, he raised his glass and said,”friends, let’s have a drink together!” To our friendship, cheers!”

“Cheers!”

Xia ruofei and the others raised their glasses as well. They clinked their glasses and took a sip.

After that, Auntie Capella warmly invited everyone to eat.

At this moment, Lin Qiao, who was sitting beside Xia ruofei, whispered in his ear,””Brother ruofei, why do I feel that this Semillon wine is not as good as the one you brought back last time? Didn’t uncle Carter just say that this was his treasure? The ones you bought last time were sold in bulk, right? This doesn’t make any sense ...”

Lin Qiao whispered into Xia ruofei’s ear, making it a little itchy. He unnaturally moved to the side and said in a low voice,””I’ve made some improvements to the wine I bought last time. It’s fine as long as you know, don’t spout nonsense ...”

The previous batch of Semillon Xia ruofei had been left in the spirit map space. In terms of actual experience, that batch of wine was no less than the two bottles of wine that Old West took out. Moreover, they had been stored in an environment rich in spiritual Qi for so long that they had undergone a complete transformation. It was no wonder that even Lin Qiao, who didn’t drink much, could easily compare the good and bad.

Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue and said,”Oh!” I know!”

Then, Lin Qiao, the curious baby, couldn’t help but ask,””Brother ruofei, if you can improve the wine in the winery, won’t our winery be rich? The half – Lon I’ve been drinking at home is much better than the one I’ve been drinking for the past twenty years!”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”are you trying to tire me to death?” There are over 20000 bottles of wine here!”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””But of course, I’m going to improve it from the root. I’m going to optimize the breed of the grapes, so the wine will naturally be of a higher grade!”

Lin Qiao’s eyes lit up and she nodded repeatedly,”MMH! West winery’s Semillon was already quite famous. If the variety of grapes were better, it would definitely become famous! No wonder you decided to buy the winery so quickly. It turns out that you already had plans!”

Xia ruofei smiled proudly and said,””That’s right! I never fight a battle without preparation!”

At this moment, old Wester raised his glass to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei ended his conversation with Lin Qiao and raised his glass with a smile.

This meal was naturally a happy one for both the host and the guest.

The old westerns ‘worries were gone. They successfully raised the funds needed for the company’s aftermath, and there was even a surplus. They could continue to work in the winery, which was the best result for them.

Hence, the two of them were in a good mood and frequently toasted Xia ruofei.

As for Xia ruofei, he had the opportunity to purchase a high – Quality winery with a long history at a relatively low price. Naturally, he was very happy.

After the meal, Old West and his wife personally sent Xia ruofei and the other two to the entrance of the winery.

Old West hugged Xia ruofei and said,””No matter what, I still have to thank you, my friend, for helping me out of this predicament!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Carter, I’ll have to trouble you with the winery in the future!” Our company will probably send a Finance Manager, and you’ll have full authority in other management matters!”

After Xia ruofei bought the winery, he couldn’t just sit back and do nothing. The normal operation was to station a Finance Manager. Some would even station a Human Resources Manager to manage the people and money.

So this was a very normal behavior, and old West wasn’t surprised.

He smiled and said,”thank you for your trust!” By the way, Xia, have you thought of the name of the winery after you take over? Lawyer heinte will be going through the relevant legal procedures tomorrow. The new winery’s name is required for the registration. ”

Old West was doing his job as an employee by reminding Xia ruofei.

Of course, Old West’s eyes flashed with disappointment after saying this. The winery that had been passed down for more than 150 years had finally changed owners in his hands. It would soon be changed to a name that might be full of Chinese characteristics. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Maybe in a few years, people will forget the name West Winery ... Old West thought sadly.

Xia ruofei shrugged and asked,””Do I have to change my name? I think the current name is quite good!”

Old Wester was stunned for a moment, and then revealed a hint of surprise. He quickly asked,””Xia, you mean you don’t plan on changing the name of the winery?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yes!” Uncle Carter, I know what this winery and the brand West means to you, but to me, it doesn’t matter if I change the name or not. So I’ve decided to continue this brand that has been passed down for more than a hundred years!”

“That’s great!” Old West couldn’t help but cheer,”thank you! Xia, thank you very much ...”

Madam Kelly also knew that this brand was an inheritance from her husband’s ancestors. It carried too many of his memories and feelings. Thus, when she heard that Xia ruofei had promised to keep the brand ‘West’ and the name of the winery, she was so excited that she gave Xia ruofei a big hug.

Xia ruofei struggled to break free and panted exaggeratedly.”Auntie Capella, I almost passed out ...”

“Hahaha ...”

Everyone burst out laughing.

Actually, Xia ruofei did not mention that there were many people in China who worshipped the western culture. West wine had a hundred years of history and the retro logo on it was a symbol of quality to many people. In the future, when it opened up the Chinese market, it would definitely be more useful than the Taoyuan wine.

Hence, Xia ruofei had no intention of changing the brand name from the very beginning.

Of course, the LOGO of paradise Corporation must be added to the brand of the new wine.

Xia ruofei and the other two left West Winery and returned to Paradise Farm.

Lin Qiao was also very sensible. She didn’t continue to make a fuss about going to the bar to clean up. She had taken a lot of photos at the farm and West Winery today. After she posted them on her WeChat moments, many people left her messages. Little girls were vain, so she was busy replying to everyone!

After returning to the farm, Xia ruofei took a shower and rested for a while.

At around 10 O’ clock in the evening, he took out his mobile phone and called Tang He, who was far away in the United States. Australia was 14 hours faster than the United States time. It was about 8 O’ clock in the morning in the United States, so the old man should be up already.

“Little Xia! Why did you call me today?” Mr. Tang smiled and asked,”it should be late at night in Australia, right?”

Liang Qichao had reported to Mr. Tang that Xia ruofei was bringing his sister to Australia for a holiday.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yes!” I’m ready to go to bed. It should be around 8 O’ clock over there. I shouldn’t be disturbing your rest, right?”

“I won ‘t, I won’ t!” Tang He said,”old people don’t sleep much. I woke up at Sixo’ clock. What’s the matter?”

Xia ruofei said,”I have a favor to ask of you.” I bought a small winery at the Hunter Valley today, and the transaction amount is about two million Australian dollars. You know that it’s more difficult for Chinese yuan to go out to sea, so I was wondering if I could borrow from your shengbang group’s Australian branch? I’ll use today’s exchange rate to settle the bill with your branch in China. ”

“Woof! You’re pretty fast! You just arrived in Australia today and you already bought a winery?” Tang He smiled and said,”did you already see it coming?”

“No, no. It just so happened that the opportunity was right and the price was also quite favorable.” Xia ruofei said,”it’s mainly because this winery isn’t big and the transaction amount wasn’t that high, so I just bought it!”

“That’s true. Looks like I’ll be able to drink your red wine in the future!” Tang He laughed and said.

“I believe that our paradise corporation’s products will definitely not disappoint you.” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Hahaha! You’re not humble at all. ” Tang He smiled and said,”Xiao Xia, it’s not a problem to lend us money. Two million Australian dollars is not a lot. Our Australian branch can take it out at any time, but ...”

Then, Tang He changed the topic and said,””Don’t be in a hurry to use Chinese dollars to settle the bill with our China branch. I still have something I need your help with! We’ll settle the bill together!”

“Oh? What’s the matter, old master Tang?” Xia ruofei asked,”as long as I can do it, I will do my best!”

Tang He chuckled and asked,”I think only you can do this. I also need some jinsi nanmu wood, the bigger the better. It would be best if it can reach the quality of the last time. Price is definitely not a problem!”
