3321 A terrifying illusion (1)

Even though Xia ruofei was already a cultivator, he was still an atheist.

Especially after he started cultivating, he was even more convinced that there were no gods or Buddhas in the sky, and ghosts naturally did not exist. Even if some people could survive in the form of a spirit body, that was only possible under very special circumstances and coincidences. Moreover, it was impossible for a form of flesh and blood to appear.

Therefore, after Lin Hu appeared, Xia ruofei hesitated for a short while due to the agitation in his heart. However, he quickly determined that this was an illusion.

He had a deep understanding of arrays and naturally knew that arrays could not read everyone’s mind, but they could make people, under the influence of the array, involuntarily hallucinate. Under the same array, everyone’s hallucination would be different.

Even though Xia ruofei quickly confirmed that Lin Hu was an illusionary figure and might even be his inner demon, he still sat down and chatted with Lin Hu for half an hour.

In the depths of his heart, he was very eager to sit down and have a long talk with Lin Hu again. Even though he knew that it was fake, he still used this precious time to talk to Lin Hu about the past of his military career.

When the qushuang flying sword’s sword light swept past Lin Hu’s throat, Lin Hu’s body turned into specks of light and dissipated into the air before blood could even spurt out from the wound. It was as if he had never been there.

Xia ruofei watched as his good comrade and brother disappeared just like that. Even though he knew it was fake, he still felt as if a knife was being twisted in his heart.

This was the power of a formation. It could strike the weakest part of a person’s heart and unconsciously affect their state of mind.

Xia ruofei even suspected that the garden, the pavilion, the bridge, and the flowing water were all just illusions.

The problem was that Xia ruofei had searched the area thoroughly and could not find any trace of the formation.

And he had unknowingly been affected by the illusory formation.

This meant that the person who had set up this formation was much more skilled than Xia ruofei. Their skills were not on the same level.

This made Xia ruofei even more vigilant. This seemingly peaceful house was really full of danger!

After the incident with the high – Level Star Beast, Xia ruofei could no longer trust the results of his spiritual power. So, he carefully used his naked eyes to search everywhere, trying to find any clues about the array. However, he could not find anything.

After a short while, another set of footsteps could be heard.

Xia ruofei looked up. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

This time, it was his grandfather who had passed away many years ago.

Xia ruofei’s eyes turned red when he saw his grandfather’s kind face.

His parents had passed away when he was young, and he and his grandfather had always depended on each other.

After his grandfather had passed away from illness, his longing for his grandfather had increased day by day. Even though he knew that this grandfather was just an image he had created based on his inner memories, he still could not control his emotions.

“Xiao Fei, how have you been all these years?” his grandfather called out with a smile.

“I’m fine ...” Xia ruofei sobbed.”Grandpa, I just miss you every day ...”

“Silly child!” His grandfather smiled and said,”grandfather has always missed Xiaofei! Seeing that you’re doing well, Grandpa is relieved ...”

Xia ruofei knew that he was running out of time, so even though he was full of admiration and wanted to jump into his grandfather’s arms, after a few simple words, he said with tears in his eyes,”Grandpa, I’m sorry ...” He said.

Then, he closed his eyes and gritted his teeth, sending the flying sword at his grandfather.

His grandfather turned into specks of light and disappeared without a trace.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were also filled with tears.

Even though he knew it was fake, the feeling of stabbing his own family with his own hands still made Xia ruofei feel so much pain that he wished he was dead.

This formation was simply too vicious!

He didn’t even know when it would end because people that Xia ruofei was familiar with appeared in front of him one after another.

There were his parents who had passed away a long time ago, his Chinese teacher who had been very good to him, and the old squad leader of the lone wolf Special Forces who had sacrificed his life. In the end, it was not just the people who had passed away that appeared. Even Lin Hu’s mother and Lin Qiao appeared in front of him.

Xia ruofei’s eyes became redder and redder, and the qushuang flying sword in his hand became faster and faster. The figures that appeared later were pierced by the qushuang flying sword and turned into spots of light before disappearing.

When Xia ruofei personally used the qushuang flying sword to cut through the neck of the illusionary Song Wei, he couldn’t help but explode with emotions.

He raised his head and roared,”what other tricks do you have?!” Use all of them! Do you only know this dirty trick? So what if they’re my family and friends?”

Xia ruofei roared as he manically controlled his flying sword to cut the surrounding flowers and pavilions.

For a moment, the entire back garden of the house was filled with sword Qi. All the flowers and grass were reduced to dust under the destruction of the sword Qi. Even the thick gold nanmu pillars were cut into several pieces by the flying swords.

At this moment, the surrounding time and space seemed to freeze.

The broken leaves and petals were completely still in the air. The broken pieces of the Phoebe zhennan pillar were bent at an angle and were completely fixed in place. It did not collapse. A piece of soil that was originally flying towards Xia ruofei was also completely frozen in place.
