Chapter 1719: The press conference full of laughter (1)

Tony looked around and continued,””Also, after the aircraft is repaired and put into use again, we will put on a new paint job!”

Tony continued,”we understand that Mr. Xia’s company still has business in Australia. Therefore, the paint of this Airbus A350 will be changed to paradise Corporation and Paradise Farm’s themes. Moreover, the paint will not change until this aircraft is retired!”

Xia ruofei could not help but be tempted. So this was the surprise Tony was talking about. Compared to the cash reward, this was a very good surprise in Xia ruofei’s eyes.

Thinking of a giant Airbus with paradise corporation’s printed on it and flying around the world all year round, it was simply a mobile billboard!

After Tony finished speaking, an image appeared on the projection screen behind him.

“This is the concept art for the new paint job that our designers have done after working overtime,” Tony said with a smile.”It’s the final product!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei turned around and saw the of paradise Corporation and the English name of Paradise Farm on the wings of the plane.

In addition, the design of the plane was even more eye – catching. There were fresh vegetables and fruits on it, and a huge pattern was distributed across the entire plane. The color matching of these vegetables and fruits was also very eye – catching. There were red, yellow, and green. They looked very fresh and made people unable to help but have an appetite.

Tony smiled and introduced,”these pictures are taken from the vegetables displayed by Paradise Farm on the official website of the Maya Retail Group. They are all real photos. When it’s time to change the paint, we hope to collect some high – definition pictures from Paradise Farm to achieve the best effect. We hope Mr. Xia can help us!”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’ll do my best to cooperate!”

The camouflage was too eye – catching. One could imagine that no matter which airport such a plane appeared in, the number of people looking back would definitely be first – Class!

What’s more, there was a story behind this camouflage, which could simply be spread as a good story, which was equivalent to adding to the publicity effect.

Xia ruofei could even foresee that this plane would become an internet celebrity plane. If people saw it on their travels, many people would be surprised to take photos with it.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Thank you, Mr. Tony. This is a great surprise!”

Tony smiled and nodded at Xia ruofei, and then gestured to the host.

The host immediately said,”next, it’s time for the reporters to ask questions!”

The moment he finished speaking, the reporters below raised their hands in unison. The host pointed to one of them and said,””The lady in red in the middle of the first row!”

Most of the time, sitting in the first row always had an advantage, and female reporters were more likely to be selected. Therefore, in the case where no questions were set in advance, the female reporters in the first row had a much higher probability of getting a chance to ask questions than others.

It was the same today. The female reporter in red in the first row took the microphone from the staff and stood up.”Thank you, host. I’m a reporter from the ‘sutteny Morning Herald’. I have two questions for Mr. Xia.”

Xia ruofei turned on the microphone in front of him and nodded at the female reporter with a smile, as if he was listening.

“What I want to ask is, has Mr. Xia received any flight training before this?” the female reporter in red asked. Why would you take on this seemingly impossible mission under such circumstances?”

Xia ruofei smiled and spoke in fluent English,””I’ve received some simple helicopter operation training before. Before the A350’s forced descent, I’ve never actually operated a fixed – Wing aircraft.”

There was a sudden commotion among the reporters and they all raised their hands.

Xia ruofei pressed his hands down, indicating that he had not finished answering his question.

He continued,”as for why he stood up, I don’t think there’s a need for a reason.” The situation was very critical at that time. If the situation were to worsen, I would have lost my life!”

The few people on the stage and the reporters below the stage let out kind laughter.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”although I’ve never come into contact with this model of aircraft, at least I have some understanding of aviation knowledge. It’s better than doing nothing, right?” Besides, even though the pilot was disabled, he was still conscious ...”

Xia ruofei paused and took a sip of water before he continued,””I have to tell the media that the success of this forced landing is inseparable from Captain Brook’s full technical guidance. He’s still receiving treatment in the hospital due to his injuries and can’t attend this press conference. But I want to say that Captain Brook is a very experienced and strong – willed senior captain. Without his guidance, this forced surrender would never have succeeded!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, the reporters couldn’t help but start clapping.

Tony, who was sitting beside Xia ruofei, could not hide his joy. He thought to himself, Mr. Xia’s EQ is really high ...

In fact, the Australian Airlines was very passive in this incident. Although the incident did not cause any casualties, it was all thanks to Xia ruofei, a foreigner, who turned the tide. The cause of the incident was the deliberate suicide of the Australian Airlines employee, Wilkinson. The Australian Airlines would not be able to get rid of this.
