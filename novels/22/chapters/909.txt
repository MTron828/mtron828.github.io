If Xia ruofei went out alone, he didn’t need to bring any luggage. Basically, the spirit map space had all the daily necessities, laundry, and other things prepared. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

But this time, he was taking Lin Qiao with him, so he took a small suitcase and put some clothes in it.

Unlike Xia ruofei’s small boarding box, which could be directly brought to the plane, Lin Qiao’s things were wrapped in an extra – large suitcase, which must be checked in.

However, Xia ruofei understood. After all, girls had to bring more things when they went out. Moreover, Australia was in the Southern Hemisphere, and the season was the opposite of China. July and August were the winter in Australia, so Lin Qiao had to bring a lot of warm clothes.

The farm and the airport were both located in Changping County, and they only needed to drive seven or eight kilometers along the seaside road to reach it.

When Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao arrived at the airport, it was not even half past eight in the evening.

Since they had bought first – Class tickets, the two of them went directly to the VIP counter to check in and check in their luggage. Then, under the guidance of the VIP Commissioner, they passed through the security check through the VIP channel.

The airport’s VIP customer service Commissioner brought Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao straight into the VIP lounge of the Changping International Airport that Heron Island Airlines had set up.

Heron Island Airlines was a local airline in the southeast province. Heron Island City and Sanshan city were both important bases of this company, so the conditions in the VIP room were naturally quite good.

The entire waiting room was about four to five hundred square meters in size. On the side of the landing strip was a huge glass curtain wall. The view was very wide, and even the aircraft taking off and landing on the runway in the distance could be clearly seen.

In the spacious and bright space, dozens of single – seat leather sofas were scattered in a picturesque disorder. On the side near the door, there was also a wine tasting area, tea art area, business district, and so on. Of course, exquisite desserts and delicious meals were also provided.

All of this was free.

In fact, the wool comes from the sheep. First – Class or business class tickets were several times more expensive than Economy Class. In contrast, the cost of these additional services provided in the airport VIP room was not high.

It was Lin Qiao’s first time coming to such a high – end place. The last time she went to Shen Cheng city was her first time taking a plane in her life, so everything was new to her.

Xia ruofei smiled as he looked at Lin Qiao who was looking around. There was no contempt in his eyes, but a trace of love.

He brought Lin Qiao to a single – seater genuine leather sofa and sat down. Then, he went to get some delicate desserts and a drink for Lin Qiao.

“Thank you, brother ruofei!” Lin Qiao smiled sweetly and put it on the small coffee table.

Lin Qiao took out her laptop, turned it on, and put it on her lap. She took a sip of the drink and then focused on the computer screen.

Xia ruofei curiously took a look and found that Lin Qiao was browsing a design website. He couldn’t help but smile and said,””You didn’t forget to study when you were out playing? Do you have to fight so hard?”

Lin Qiao raised her head and smiled.”My master introduced this website to me. He said that there are many very creative designs and asked me to learn more when I have time. It’s boring to just sit here, so I just looked around.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Not bad, not bad. Study hard. The company’s business will depend on you in the future!”

“Brother ruofei, I’m suddenly feeling a lot of pressure!” Lin qiaojiao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei said seriously,”the advertising design major of Heron Island University is known as the Huangpu military department in the advertising industry!” You’re also talented in this area, so you’ll definitely be able to achieve something in the future. I’ll be waiting for you to take over the company’s visual design and advertising packaging business!”

Lin Qiao pursed her lips and smiled. Then, she said seriously,”Mm! I will work hard!”

The two of them chatted for a while. Xia ruofei didn’t disturb Lin Qiao. He took out his iPad, put on his headphones, and started to watch a movie.

One of them was quietly looking at the computer while the other was immersed in the plot of the movie. At this time, a family of three was led into the VIP lounge by the airport’s VIP customer service.

They looked like a couple and their child.

Of the two adults, one was a middle – aged Chinese man in his forties. He was tall and burly, wearing a well – designed shirt and suit pants. His every move was quite powerful, and he had the demeanor of a successful man.

The woman beside him had a western face and was very tall. Because of her high heels, she was about the same height as her husband.

Not only was this woman tall, but her figure was also quite hot. She was wearing a white silk shirt with ripped jeans, which highlighted her spectacular chest and perky butt.

With a 1.8 – meter tall blonde beauty like her, many people turned to look at her wherever she went.

The few guests in the VIP hall couldn’t help but look over.

Beside the transnational couple was a little boy of eight or nine years old.

Mixed – Bloods seemed to be more handsome or beautiful.

The little boy had undoubtedly inherited many of his parents ‘good qualities. He had beautiful blonde hair and charming blue eyes, and his facial features were more like that of an Asian, appearing softer and less angular.

The family of three walked to the three sofas opposite Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao and sat down.

Children were always restless. After a while, he couldn’t sit still anymore. He took out a small remote control car from his bag and started playing.

When the family of three came in, Xia ruofei raised his head to take a look. Naturally, he was secretly amazed by the beauty of the Western woman.

However, it was impolite to stare at someone else’s wife. Xia ruofei quickly looked away and continued watching the movie.

The little boy was playing with his favorite toy happily. The departure hall was covered with a thick carpet, so the transnational couple was not worried about their child falling and hurting himself. They only reminded him not to make a loud noise and not to disturb others. Then, they sat in their seats and looked at their child from a distance.

Xia ruofei and Xia Xiaofei were sitting opposite the family of three. There was quite a bit of space in the middle where the children were playing with the remote control car.

Unknowingly, the little boy’s range of activity slowly expanded.

All of a sudden, the remote control car slanted and directly rushed under Lin Qiao’s sofa. The little boy quickly dropped the remote control and ran over to pick up his car.

Lin Qiao was holding a drink cup in one hand and focused on the computer. She was shocked when a child rushed over and tried to crawl under her feet.

She subconsciously tilted her leg to avoid it, but she forgot that the laptop was still on her leg.

The laptop that she had just bought suddenly slid down and hit the little boy’s head. Lin Qiao couldn’t help but scream.

The Apple laptop had a metal cover, and although it was extremely thin, it still weighed two to three pounds. If it were to hit a child’s head, it would definitely cause damage.

Although Xia ruofei was wearing earphones, his innate alertness made him realize that the little boy was running over before Lin Qiao.

Hence, when Lin Qiao’s laptop slipped, Xia ruofei was quick to react and caught it firmly in his hand before it hit the little boy’s forehead.

“Alan!” The tall Western woman hurriedly stood up and shouted,”you’re in trouble again!”

The International couple stood up at the same time and walked quickly towards Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao.

The Chinese man said seriously in Chinese,””Haoran, apologize to your brother and sister immediately!”

The little boy looked as if he had done something wrong. He quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao, lowered his head and said,””Brother, sister, I’m sorry!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”little friend, it’s okay.” However, you have to be more careful in the future. It’s very easy to injure yourself like this. ”

The little boy nodded sensibly and said,””Thank you for your reminder, brother!”

The Chinese man said with an apologetic look,””I’m sorry! The child is insensible and almost bumped into you. ”

His wife also apologized to the two of them in broken Chinese.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay. Children are naturally active. Besides, it didn’t cause any serious consequences.”

Xia ruofei patted the little boy’s head affectionately.

Lin Qiao also said that it was okay. This mixed – Blood boy was very cute. Lin Qiao’s maternal instinct was triggered. Even if she was really injured, she would not bear to blame such a cute child, let alone a little shock.

The couple also looked at their son. Their eyes were full of love and care, but at the same time, there was a trace of sadness.

However, Xia ruofei did not notice this small detail.

Because of this little episode, everyone stood around and chatted for a while.

The Chinese man took the initiative to introduce,””Little brother, my name is Tang Yitian and this is my wife, Jennifer. My son’s name is Tang Haoran and his English name is Alan.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Tang Yitian and Jennifer. He said,””I’m Xia ruofei and this is my sister Lin Qiao. We’re on a trip to Australia. ”

“You’re also going to Australia? The flight to Sydney at 9:45?” Tang Yitian asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”could it be that you guys are the same?”

“Yeah, what a coincidence!” Tang Yitian smiled.”I live in Sydney.” Little brother, when you arrive in Australia, you are welcome to visit our house! Jennifer’s cooking skills are very good. ”

Tang Yitian took out a business card from his pocket and handed it to Xia ruofei.”This is my name card.”

Xia ruofei took the name card and nodded.””Alright, I’ll definitely visit you guys when I have the chance.”

At this time, Lin Qiao, who had been squatting and playing with little Haoran, seemed to suddenly realize something. She looked up at Jennifer and then showed a surprised look.

“You ... You’re Jennifer!” Lin Qiao said with some excitement.

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao strangely and said,””Qiao’ er, do you know Ms. Jennifer?”

Xia ruofei felt a little strange. When Tang Yitian introduced his wife, Lin Qiao only nodded politely to greet him. Why was she so excited now?

“No, brother ruofei! She was Jennifer! Jennifer Annie!” Lin Qiao said excitedly,”don’t you read the entertainment news? She’s the most famous female celebrity in Australia!”
