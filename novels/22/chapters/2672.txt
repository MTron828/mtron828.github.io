2673 Using the soul seal (2)

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”No need. Tell him to wait in the office. I’ll go down now!”

“Yes!” The waiter replied.

The waiter hurriedly contacted the people downstairs through the walkie – talkie. Xia ruofei stepped into the elevator and took the elevator to the floor where Liu Qingfeng’s office was located.

As soon as he got out of the elevator, Xia ruofei saw Liu Qingfeng waiting respectfully at the elevator.

He saw Xia ruofei and quickly said,””Mr. Xia, if there’s anything you need, you can just give me a call or ask me to go up. Why did you come down personally?”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”I can’t sleep ... I just thought of some questions. I need to interrogate bainilatti again. I need to use your office again.”

“No problem!” Liu Qingfeng quickly said,”this way, please! I’ll get someone to bring bainilatti over!”

Xia ruofei nodded and patted Liu Qingfeng’s shoulder.””I’m here, and you stayed up all night with me. It’s been hard on you! This is a critical period, so I hope you can take responsibility and stabilize the People’s hearts on Peach Blossom Island. I’ll talk to elder Liu when I get back and try to arrange a better position for you!”

Liu Qingfeng was so excited that his body trembled slightly, and he repeatedly said,”Thank you, Mr. Xia! Thank you, Mr. Xia! I’ll definitely do my best, don’t worry!”

Liu Qingfeng was aware of Xia ruofei’s extraordinary status in the Liu family. Although he did not know the details of old master Liu’s treatment, he could see from Liu Kuan’s attitude towards Xia ruofei and some news from his family that Xia ruofei’s words carried a lot of weight in the Liu family.

Xia ruofei was willing to put in a good word or two for him. This was more effective than anyone else’s words. How could Liu Qingfeng not be excited?

Xia ruofei nodded and walked towards Liu Qingfeng’s office.

Liu Qingfeng hurriedly went to the room where bainilatti was held and asked someone to escort bainilatti to the office.

Liu Qingfeng personally brought people to carry bainilatti into the office, then said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, we’ll take our leave first. If he wasn’t honest, he could take some measures. We’ve always had a good relationship with the officials of the ponaintu, so it’s not a big deal to kill someone here. ”

Bainilatti had been working for the Liu family for so many years, and his Chinese Level was quite good. When he heard Liu Qingfeng’s words, he couldn’t help but cry out and struggle on the ground in vain.

Xia ruofei glanced at bainilatti with a faint smile and said,””I know. All of you can leave! Without my permission, no one is allowed to approach!”

“Yes!” Liu Qingfeng puffed out his chest and said.

With Xia ruofei’s words, he was really full of energy now. He couldn’t wait to perform in front of Xia ruofei without rest.

After leaving Xia ruofei’s office, Liu Qingfeng immediately gathered four more people to guard the office. He didn’t dare to leave and waited for Xia ruofei’s call. At the same time, he kept in contact with the airport to find out when the transport plane would land.

In Liu Qingfeng’s office, Xia ruofei walked in front of benilatti, squatted down, and stared at him with a faint smile.

Bainilatti was so frightened that he kept whimpering. At the same time, his body wriggled as he tried to retreat. However, his hands and feet were tied together, and his entire body was in a reverse bow shape. He couldn’t use any force at all, and he was destined to be in vain.

Benilatti really thought that Xia ruofei was going to kill him. After all, he had sold the information to Wang Boshan for money. He really had a reason to kill him.

Bainilatti’s heart was filled with fear. He could not help but look at Xia ruofei with a pleading expression.

When his eyes met Xia ruofei ‘s, he felt as if Xia ruofei’s eyes were like a bottomless pool and his consciousness fell into it.

Xia ruofei’s strong spiritual power enveloped benilatti. After benilatti fell into a state of hypnosis, he did not hesitate to release the child seal of the soul seal from his sea of consciousness. A light visible to the naked eye flashed and entered between benilatti’s eyebrows.

The next moment, Xia ruofei felt the connection between the mother seal and the child seal.

Using a soul seal to subdue an ordinary person was simply as easy as blowing off dust.

Xia ruofei retracted his spiritual power and woke up bainilatti from his state of hypnosis.

There was a moment of confusion in benilatti’s eyes before he regained his clarity.

However, when he looked at Xia ruofei again, his eyes were filled with fanatical admiration.

Xia ruofei casually set up a sound – proof array around them, then reached out and took out the rag that was gagging beniladi’s mouth.

As soon as his mouth was free, bainilatti immediately said respectfully,””Hello, master!”

He was still using his Chinese Kasaya with a strange accent. In his opinion, it would be the greatest disrespect if he didn’t use his master’s language when talking to him.

Before this, Xia ruofei had come to Peach Blossom Island twice, and benilatti had mainly communicated with Xia ruofei in English.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Originally, I should’ve executed you for leaking the information about the Paradise Island, but the heavens are kind, so I gave you this opportunity to turn over a new leaf.”

Bainilatti said gratefully,””Thank you, master. You’re too kind! I’m willing to do anything for master! Even if you die ten thousand times!”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei said.

With that, Xia ruofei reached out to untie the ropes on benilatti.

Once benilatti regained his freedom, he immediately turned over and knelt down at Xia ruofei’s feet.””Master, what can I do for you? Master, please give me your orders!”

Xia ruofei said,”first, I’ll tell Liu Qingfeng later that since you’re more cooperative, there’s no need to tie you up. However, we still have to keep you under watch. This is mainly because we’re worried that the difference will be too big and it will make people suspicious.”

“I understand! I’m willing to do anything for master! What’s the big deal about being locked up?” Benilati said without hesitation. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Second, I’ll ask Liu Qingfeng to exchange the communication tool with you. For the time being, don’t take the initiative to contact Wang Boshan. If he contacts you, just say that everything is normal on the peach Garden Island and that I didn’t come to the peach Garden Island.” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright, your subordinate will remember!” Beniladi said.

Xia ruofei said,”third, be ready at any time. When the time is right, I need you to send the message I want to send to Wang Boshan. Don’t give yourself away!”

“Yes! This subordinate understands!” Beniladi said.

“That’s all for now. In short, don’t let anyone here know that you’ve been subdued by me. Don’t let Wang Boshan know that there’s any abnormality. Just remember these two points!” Xia ruofei said.

“Understood!” “Yes,” bainilatti replied.

Xia ruofei let benilatti rest in the office for a while, then opened the office door and called Liu Qingfeng in.

When Liu Qingfeng saw that bainilatti had already regained his freedom, he couldn’t help but be stunned. However, he didn’t say anything and only asked respectfully,””Mr. Xia, what are your orders?”

Xia ruofei pointed at bainilatti and said,””This guy is quite cooperative, so let’s just let him suffer less! There’s no need to tie him up from now on. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment and made a thoughtful expression. Then he said,””In order to prevent Wang Boshan and the others from feeling strange that they can’t contact benilatti, return his phone to him tonight. But you have to keep a close eye on him 24 hours a day, especially when Wang Boshan and his gang call. If there’s any possibility of him leaking the news, hang up immediately!”

“Understood!” Liu Qingfeng nodded and said. I’ll pass down the order! This guy is very afraid of death. If we scare him with a few words, he definitely won’t dare to act recklessly and will definitely cooperate with us!”
