Chapter 1634: Formation (1)

“Ah!”

In the quiet night, song Rui’s screams spread far and wide.

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun glared at him at the same time. Song Rui laughed and waved his hand.

He had used almost all his strength in this boring attempt just now, and he had pressed it with the position of his palm. Fortunately, the contact area of the head of the nail was larger than that of an ordinary nail, otherwise, his palm would definitely have been pierced.

Even so, song Rui felt pain in his palm, so he couldn’t help but scream.

“Can’t you be more careful!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but reprimand him in a low voice.”Is this the time to play?”

Song Rui said awkwardly,”I’m sorry, my mistake ... I thought this wood was soft because you looked so relaxed!” I just wanted to try ...”

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly.

Zhao Yongjun didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, but he was also very curious,””Ruofei, you’re quite strong! Are all the Special Forces this powerful?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said nothing. Wu Qiang said,””Old platoon leader, I can’t do it either. The boss is very powerful!”

“Let’s not talk about this, hurry up and work!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he glared at song Rui and said,”don’t try anything funny again!”

“I understand!” Song Rui quickly said.

Xia ruofei then picked up another locust tree and used the same method to find the position and nail in.

In a short while, he had dealt with nine pieces of Locust wood and nailed seven nail seeds into each piece of wood in the corresponding position.

Next, Xia ruofei checked the batch of mirrors again. He picked out the nine that he was most satisfied with and placed them aside.

Finally, he picked up a piece of yellow paper and quickly drew his fingers on the surface of the paper. He finished dealing with a piece of paper in a dozen seconds.

Xia ruofei did the same thing and processed the 81 yellow joss papers. He folded them neatly and placed them together with the mirror he had picked out.

“Ready!” Xia ruofei clapped his hands and said,”time to work!”

“Wu Qiang, do you still remember the positions of the nine holes?” he asked Wu Qiang.

“I can remember!” Wu Qiang replied without hesitation.

Although the environment was very dark, recognizing directions and remembering locations were the basic skills of a qualified soldier. Wu Qiang had not fallen behind in this area.

“Very good. Take these locust trees, mirrors, and yellow joss papers. After you find the round hole, first place nine yellow joss papers at the bottom, and then place the locust trees vertically inside. The side I marked is facing up.” Xia ruofei said,”then, turn the mirror face up and place it on top of The Pagoda Tree. Finally, fill it up with soil. Do you understand?”

Wu Qiang quickly memorized it and nodded,”No problem!”

“Remember to clean up the traces after filling in the soil.” Xia ruofei reminded him,”this shouldn’t be too difficult for you, right?”

“No big deal!” Wu Qiang grinned and said,”I guarantee that even you won’t be able to leave a mark!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said to Zhao Yongjun,”brother Zhao, can you go with Wuqiang and help him move his things and act as a helper?”

There were a lot of locust trees, mirrors, and yellow joss papers. Wu Qiang could barely carry them all in one trip.

“I’ll follow the organization’s arrangements!” Zhao Yongjun laughed,”Wuqiang, the old platoon leader will listen to your command!”

Wu Qiang was a little embarrassed and quickly said,”Old platoon leader, don’t make me laugh. I don’t dare to command you!”

Song Rui asked impatiently,””Ruofei, what should I do then?”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui and said,””Don’t worry, I’ll leave the most important task to you! You just need to follow me in a while!”

“Understood!” Song Rui said excitedly.

Wu Qiang and Zhao Yongjun moved their things and set off. Xia ruofei also went to the car and picked up his backpack. He picked up a shovel and said to song Rui,””Let’s go!”

Song Rui followed behind Xia ruofei in high spirits and soon disappeared into the darkness.

Xia ruofei did not have a flashlight but the darkness did not seem to affect him. He skillfully avoided the potholes and obstacles and moved forward quickly.

Song Rui, who was following behind, was in a difficult situation. He wanted to slow down, but he was worried that he couldn’t keep up. Fortunately, he still had a small flashlight in his hand. With the weak light, he could at least see his feet. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei walked with song Rui for about 800 to 900 meters. Song Rui was so tired that he was gasping for breath.

The two of them went straight to the lakeside at the edge of the land. Xia ruofei stopped.

Song Rui panted as he complained,””RUO Fei, can’t you walk a little slower? I’m so tired ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Weren’t you worried that there wouldn’t be enough time? didn’t I delay you earlier?”

“You ... You’re too narrow – minded!” Song Rui was so angry that he cried out,”you’re purely taking revenge!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t be bothered with him. He placed his backpack on the ground and said,””Hurry up and catch your breath, then start working!”

Song Rui immediately perked up and said,””I can do it now! Speak! What kind of task are you giving me?”

Xia ruofei handed the shovel to song Rui and said,””Dig a hole!”

“Ah?” Song Rui couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.”Just this?”

“I’m afraid you can’t do it!”Xia ruofei said with a look of disdain.
