2301 Chapter 1271 – suspicious (1)

If Xia ruofei was just an ordinary young man, even if he was not a doctor in the General Hospital, professor Chen would not be so uncertain. However, the reality was that Xia ruofei was someone the head of the joint Logistics support force had personally instructed the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Headquarters to fully cooperate with. Therefore, professor Chen was not sure if Xia ruofei would give him face.

Ge Jun smiled and said,”little Chen, be more sincere!” I just wanted to talk to him about his acupuncture techniques ...”

Ge Jun had been immersed in Chinese medicine for his entire life. When he saw Xia ruofei’s strange needle – withdrawing technique, he was very interested and could not help but want to explore it. On the other hand, it was also because of his appreciation for talent. Nowadays, there were fewer and fewer young people who were willing to learn Chinese medicine, and young doctors with high standards were even rarer. It was not easy to meet one today, and Ge Jun did not want to miss it.

Although it was just a glimpse, Ge Jun had a feeling that Xia ruofei’s Chinese medicine, or rather, his acupuncture skills, might not be any worse than some famous doctors. This made him even more curious about Xia ruofei.

One must know that the older a Chinese doctor was, the more popular he would be. Chinese medicine was too broad and profound. It had to go through the accumulation of time before it could gradually mature. It was rare to see a young and skilled Chinese doctor like Xia ruofei.

“Uncle GE,” professor Chen nodded,”please wait here for a moment. I’ll go ask.”

Ge Jun nodded with a smile.

Professor Chen walked out of the monitoring Hall and went straight to song Qiming’s ward from the corridor between the operating area and the intensive care unit area.

After Xia ruofei kept the silver needles, he looked at his watch and realized that it was almost time for dinner. He decided to go out and have something to eat first. At the same time, he wanted to talk to Song Wei and Fang Liyun about song Qiming’s situation.

As soon as he walked out of the ward, he saw professor Chen walking toward him.

“Professor Chen!” Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.

Today, professor Chen was very cooperative with Xia ruofei, and Xia ruofei was very polite to him. After all, they were in professor Chen’s territory, and song Qiming’s follow – up treatment would need the cooperation of the General Hospital.

Besides, Xia ruofei was always like this. He would return the favor back to others.

If professor Chen had been a little disapproving of Xia ruofei’s intervention previously, he just didn’t say it out loud. Now, he was much more enthusiastic because even Ge Jun admired Xia ruofei’s acupuncture techniques. He also needed Xia ruofei to give him face and meet Ge Jun.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to fulfill the trust of his elders.

Therefore, professor Chen also showed a friendly smile and said,””Mr. Xia, how is Secretary song?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”He’s generally stable. However, he hasn’t regained his consciousness yet.”

Professor Chen knew song Qiming’s injury very well. He had already assumed that song Qiming was brain dead and would never wake up. Therefore, he was not surprised by Xia ruofei’s answer.

“Mr. Xia, one of my elders happened to be in the hospital today,” professor Chen said.”He’s a famous Chinese medicine master in our country. He heard that you’re trying to use Chinese medicine to treat Secretary song. He wants to meet you and talk about the treatment plan ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then smiled.””Professor Chen, please help me thank that Chinese medicine master! But I’m afraid I don’t have the time for now. You know uncle song’s current situation ...”

Professor Chen quickly said,”Mr. Xia, my elder’s name is Ge Jun. He’s the director of the China Chinese medical Academy and is also a publicly acknowledged Chinese medical Master. He specializes in providing medical care services to the leaders in Beijing. He’s very skilled in Chinese medicine. If he can participate in the discussion of the treatment plan, it will definitely be helpful to the treatment.”

Professor Chen thought that Xia ruofei would be interested in Ge Jun’s name. After all, he could tell that Xia ruofei was very concerned about song Qiming’s condition. Furthermore, he studied Chinese medicine. If he could get the guidance of a Chinese medicine master like GE Jun, who would refuse?

To professor Chen’s surprise, Xia ruofei did not even think about it before he said,””Professor Chen, thank you for your kindness, but ... The only thing on my mind right now is to cure uncle song as soon as possible. I really don’t have the time for anything else. Please convey my apologies to your elder, and we’ll talk about it after this matter is over!”

“This ...” Professor Chen was dumbfounded.

Xia ruofei didn’t wait for him to persuade him and said directly,””I’m sorry, professor Chen. If there’s nothing else, I have to go. I need to talk to aunt Fang and Song Wei about uncle song’s sadness. Please excuse me!”

After that, Xia ruofei smiled apologetically at professor Chen and walked toward the exit of the intensive care unit.

By the time professor Chen came back to his senses, Xia ruofei had already disappeared around the corner.

Professor Chen did not want to chase after him shamelessly. He could only shake his head with a bitter smile. He thought to himself,”uncle GE finally asked me to help with something, but I didn’t expect it to be a mess ...”

Professor Chen walked back in disappointment while Xia ruofei changed out of the isolation Suit and left the intensive care unit. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

As soon as Xia ruofei came out, he saw Guangzhi Cao loitering outside.

When Guangzhi Cao saw Xia ruofei, he immediately walked up to him. The first thing he asked was,””CEO Xia, how’s Secretary song?”

Guangzhi Cao was very concerned about song Qiming’s situation. After all, he was song Qiming’s Secretary. If something happened to song Qiming, he would be forced to change his position even if it wasn’t his fault. After all, no one would use a Secretary left behind by a former leader. Not to mention, the Secretary had died in a car accident with the leader. How unlucky would that be?
