Grello. The veins on Galini’s head were bulging, and his body trembled involuntarily. It was obvious that he was suffering from pain that ordinary people couldn’t bear.

What was even more terrifying was that after being hit by the “heart devouring finger,” even fainting was a luxury.

When a normal person’s pain reached a certain threshold, their body would trigger a protective mechanism and make them faint. Some well – trained agents could even actively trigger this protective mechanism, thus putting themselves into a coma in advance and thus suffering the torture.

However, the self – created “heart devouring finger” could put a person in extreme pain at all times, and it was impossible for them to faint. Even if they were in a short coma, they would be quickly awakened by the pain that reached deep into the soul.

At this moment, Grello. This was exactly what happened to Galini. For the first time, he experienced the extreme pain of the world and truly understood the meaning of the word “worse than death.”

Xia ruofei looked at Grello, who was rolling on the ground. There was no change in the expression on Galini’s face.

His spiritual power was locked on to Grello. Galini could clearly feel that Grello’s life force was gradually fading.

To be honest, it was a bit cruel to end a person’s life in such a way, but Grello’s death was not a big deal. Xia ruofei did not have any psychological burden on dealing with people like Galini, no matter how cruel the methods were. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As Xia ruofei had set up a sound – proof barrier in advance, Grello’s voice was still low. Kalini brought the two blondes back to the bedroom. At this time, no one would dare to come and disturb them. Therefore, no one knocked on the door during the whole process, and the people outside were completely unaware.

Xia ruofei looked at Grello. Galini’s life force was getting weaker and weaker, and his heart moved slightly.

Thus, he simply cast a concealment talisman on himself and suddenly disappeared from the cabin.

In fact, he was still nearby, but he had flown a dozen meters above the yacht on his sword.

Next, Xia ruofei removed the sound – proof barrier.

Instantly, greello’s body trembled. Galini’s shrill cry was heard.

At first, the people on the yacht thought that Grello had a lot of fun today, and they even smiled knowingly. However, Grello. Galini’s cries were so miserable that someone quickly felt that something was wrong.

So, a bodyguard not far from the cabin hesitated for a moment and walked toward Grello. In Galiny’s bedroom.

The bodyguard first listened and felt that there was something wrong with the sound, so he knocked on the door and tentatively called out,””Mr. Galiny! How are you?”

“Mr. Galiny Jr…”

“Mr. Galiny Jr…”

The bodyguard called out a few times, but Grello was in the room. Galini didn’t respond except for the screams that were obviously not made during pleasure. In fact, he was Grello now. Galini could no longer speak. Other than his instinctive screams, he could not make any other sound.

The bodyguard finally couldn’t hold it in anymore. He shouted loudly, and soon, several bodyguards rushed over.

The bodyguards discussed the situation briefly and decided to break in.

They quickly broke through the hatch and rushed into Grello. In the Galiny’s bedroom.

The bodyguards were stunned by the scene in front of them.

The two blondes were unconscious on the bed, and Grello was unconscious. Galini had already become a bloody gourd. The wounds on his body were all caused by his own scratching. There was almost no intact skin, and he looked quite miserable.

In fact, the bodyguards almost couldn’t recognize Grello. However, the basic physical characteristics would not change, and it was impossible for anyone else to appear on the yacht in grelor. In Galiny’s exclusive bedroom, this person must be Grello.

“Mr. Galiny! Mr. Galiny!” The bodyguards shouted.

Grello. Galiny’s hoarse voice made meaningless cries, and his blood – Red eyes bulged out, looking very terrifying. However, he did not respond to the bodyguard’s call at all.

Everyone immediately panicked. Soon, someone called the others through the walkie – talkie, especially the doctors on the yacht.

In fact, Xia ruofei was standing on the blue travel immortal sword and floating above the yacht. He watched the scene coldly with his spiritual power. Even a cultivator would find it difficult to survive after being hit by the heart devouring finger, let alone an ordinary person like Grello. However, Xia ruofei still wanted to confirm his death before leaving.

The people on the yacht began to run around in a panic, all rushing to Grello. In the cabin of kalini.

The doctor on the ship quickly arrived at the scene and saw Grello. Galini could not help but jump in shock.

No one knew what had happened. The two blondes had been woken up, but they didn’t know what was going on because they didn’t see Xia ruofei at all. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had used his vital Qi to attack their acupuncture points, causing them to fall unconscious. Thus, they didn’t feel any pain before they fell unconscious. They only felt a strong dizziness and then passed out without leaving any traces on their bodies.

The doctor on the ship could not help but be at his wits ‘end.

Grello. Galini’s situation was obviously very critical, so after thinking quickly, he decided to give it to Grello. Kalini was injected with a tranquilizer..
