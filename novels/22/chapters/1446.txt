Chapter 1447: Happy New Year (1)

Translator: 549690339

It was already close to noon by the time he finished his tour of the farm and the pharmaceutical factory.

As soon as Xia ruofei’s car left the factory, the phone on the control panel vibrated. He glanced at the caller ID on the LCD screen and answered the call.

“Qiao’ er!” Xia ruofei smiled and said as he drove.

“Brother ruofei, where are you?” Lin Qiao asked,”I was waiting for you to have lunch! I’ll start preparing the New Year’s Eve dinner in the afternoon ...”

“I’ve just finished my work. I’ll go pick up Qingxue and uncle Ling now,” Xia ruofei said,”why don’t you and Godma eat first? You don’t need to wait for us ...”

Ling Qingxue had mentioned to Ling Xiaotian that they would spend the new year together at Lin Qiao’s house. In fact, she didn’t have much hope herself. She didn’t expect Ling Xiaotian to agree after a little hesitation.

“That won’t do! It’s the first time that sister – in – Law and uncle Ling have come to our house! How can we neglect our guests!” Lin Qiao chuckled,”we’re not in a hurry. Drive slowly on the road!”

“I know!” Xia ruofei chuckled.”If you have any work to do, leave it for me!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei slightly increased the speed of his car and drove towards Ling Xiaotian’s jiangbin villa.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei picked up Ling Qingxue and Ling Xiaotian. Then, he turned the car around and headed towards daguantian District.

Today, Ling Xiaotian was dressed in a dark red traditional Tang suit. His face glowed red and he appeared to be in high spirits.

Ling Qingxue was also dolled up very fashionably. She was wearing a red cashmere coat with a red scarf, pencil – Grey Bell – bottomed pants, and black high heels. Her tall and slender figure was accentuated even more. She was also wearing a pink top hat on her head, which made her look elegant and cute.

“Uncle Ling, let’s spend the new year together from now on!” Xia ruofei chuckled as he drove.”It’s more lively with more people!”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”sure!” Qingxue is going to marry you sooner or later anyway. If I don’t spend the new year with you, won’t I be a lonely old man?”

“Dad, things aren’t even set in stone yet ...” Ling Qingxue pouted.

“Woof! How long have you guys been casting each other off?” Ling Xiaotian was shocked,”it’s almost time to get married! I’m still waiting to hold my grandson!”

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red as she said,”you’re getting more and more unreliable!” I’m not going to talk to you anymore ...”

Ling Xiaotian laughed out loud and said,”you little girl, getting married and having children is something that everyone has to go through. What’s there to be shy about?” Am I right, ruofei?”

Xia ruofei could only chuckle and play dumb.

Seeing that the two of them didn’t continue the conversation, Ling Xiaotian also felt a little bored. Thus, he changed the topic and asked,””Oh right, ruofei, when can you get another batch of those Red Arowana? A few of my old friends have asked me this several times ...”

“Didn’t you say that the rarer something is, the more precious it is?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”besides, didn’t you sell a lot of them the last few times? Is there anyone else who needs it?”

“You child!” Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”it’s true that the rarer something is, the more expensive it is. But how many did you sell the previous two times? Although this industry isn’t very big, it’s definitely not as small as you think. There are many people with money and leisure time now! Besides, after old Li and old Guo bought the red Arowana from you, would they not show off in the circle? After a while, many people came to me, asking when I would have more top quality Red dragons for sale!”

“I see ...” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll contact them as soon as possible. It shouldn’t be a problem!”

Of course, there wouldn’t be a problem. The red Arowana were bred in the spirit map space. Even if they were bred naturally, it was enough for him to sell a batch every now and then.

“Don’t you drop the ball!” Ling Xiaotian said,”I’ve already made it clear that if I can’t get a top – grade Red Dragon by then, I’ll really have no place to hide my old face ...”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”your reputation is more important than anything else! I promise I’ll get it done! We’ll be able to bring the red Arowana back before the Lantern Festival at the latest!”

“Alright!” Ling Xiaotian said happily,”I can rest assured with your words!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

There were almost no cars on the streets during the spring Festival. The three of them chatted and laughed along the way and soon arrived at the daguantian community.

Back then, Xia ruofei’s car had been registered with the property management and had received a pass, so the security guard had let him through at the entrance.

Xia ruofei drove directly to the underground parking lot. After buying the house, he had bought two parking spaces here.

Although Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao did not know how to drive, Xia ruofei was thinking about the long term. Lin Qiao would definitely need to drive in the future.

Moreover, buying a parking space was also an investment, so he would not lose money.

After parking their cars, Xia ruofei and the other two got out of the car and opened the trunk to take out their things.

Since Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue were here to celebrate the new year, they naturally could not come – handed. Hence, they brought a huge pile of nutritional supplements, tea leaves, wine, clothes, and so on.

Xia ruofei took the initiative to carry the two heaviest boxes.

One of them contained a River beluga weighing more than four catties. The other was a thermal container that contained a large jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ that had been prepared by Ling Ji’s private kitchen in the morning and sent to Ling Xiaotian’s house.

Since it was the new year, of course they had to eat something good.

The most delicious Chang Jiang Chinese perch and Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup were definitely two indispensable dishes.
