Chapter 1244: Chapter 757 – big profit_1

Translator: 549690339

When it came to the finale, Lu zhongguang’s voice also became a little high – pitched.”Before we start the auction for the last piece of white truffle, I would like to solemnly announce that a new world record has been set for the weight of a single white truffle! That’s the White truffle on the stage. It weighs 2.75 kg!”

Although they were already mentally prepared, when they heard Lu zhongguang announce the exact weight of the White truffle, the guests and other ordinary buyers could not help but gasp.

At this time, the red silk cloth covering the White truffle had been pulled down by the hostess. The giant white truffle, which was bigger than a basketball, was completely revealed to everyone.

The visual effect of such a large piece of white truffle was quite shocking.

White truffle was known as the “diamond on the table.” A small thin slice of it was worth hundreds of dollars. Such a large piece of white truffle looked like a large piece of ginger, but it seemed to be shining in everyone’s eyes.

Blake also sat up straight from his seat, and his eyes were shining as he stared at the White truffle.

He knew that the final price of this truffle would definitely not be low, but he was still eager to bid. If he could successfully bid for this world record – breaking white truffle, then the trouble caused by his previous foolish actions would be much less.

The influence of such a truffle had already exceeded its economic value. As the world’s top Western food chain brand, Blake Corporation really needed a brand like this.

Blake was not the only one who thought so. Monica, who was sitting beside Xia ruofei, also had a strange look in her eyes. She must have been very tempted.

Monica had also tried to bid for the truffle a few times before, but she had not been successful. If she still failed at the last piece, she would have to return empty – handed from this trip to Hong Kong.

Of course, Monica felt that her trip to Hong Kong was not a fruitless one. Reuniting with Xia ruofei was her biggest gain. She was happier than any truffles.

On the stage.

“The auction for this white truffle has officially begun,” Lu zhongguang said with a smile.”As usual, the starting bid will be 0 Yuan!”

This was already the basic routine. The final item would be auctioned off at zero Yuan. There was no need to worry about it not being sold or being sold at a very low price. This was confidence. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As soon as Lu zhongguang finished speaking, someone immediately made a bid.

The big king of shoes in the United States, Lophis, was the first to raise his bidding board and said loudly,””1.5 million dollars!”

Lophis ‘assets were almost the same as Tang He’ s, who also played an important role in the American business world. He was one of the world’s richest people.

His bid made the ordinary buyers give up completely.

The starting bid of zero Yuan was just a gimmick. With so many rich and powerful people present, and the White truffle being so rare, the possibility of buying it at a low price was impossible.

There was another person in the normal servers who was filled with excitement, and that was Blake.

The White truffle had already caught his eye.

After Lophis bid, he only hesitated for a moment before gritting his teeth and raising his bidding card.”1.55 million dollars!”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows when he heard Blake’s voice. This guy really doesn’t learn his lesson!

Just as he was about to make a bid to suppress Blake, a mocking voice came from the other side of the venue,””Mr. Xia, you don’t have to do it yourself, let me do it! 1.6 million dollars!”

The voice came from the guest area, where the rich and famous from Hong Kong were sitting.

Xia ruofei was elated. It seemed that his words had aroused the hatred of the Hong Kong tycoons.

The bidder was Mr. Nian from the Zheng family, who had won the White truffle previously. He was one of the richest men in Hong Kong with a net worth of tens of thousands of dollars. Naturally, he would not care about a million dollars.

Blake was so angry that he almost blew his top. He didn’t feel like he had done anything today! However, he was being targeted in every way.

Actually, if he had been more low – Key in the beginning and did not speak in a charitable tone when he entered the door, Xia ruofei might not have been so obvious.

Not to mention, there wasn’t even an explanation for The Grudge they had at the beginning of the year! Xia ruofei was not someone who would swallow his anger. It was fine if they didn’t meet, but since they met on a narrow path, and you were so arrogant, who else would I step on if not you?

Blake raised his sign again with a gloomy face.””1.66 million dollars!”

“1.7 million dollars!” It was almost like a seamless link, and another price immediately appeared in the Hong Kong tycoon area.

This time, it was Hong Kong’s entertainment tycoon, yang ruocheng, who bid without thinking. He didn’t give Xia ruofei a chance to bid at all.

Seeing this from backstage, Feng Jing couldn’t help but cover her mouth and laugh.

A smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He leaned back on the soft seat and watched the Tigers fight.

In terms of economic strength, the black group was not much worse than the rich people in the room.

However, George Blake’s position in the Blake group wasn’t very high, and the amount of funds he could mobilize was certainly not the same as those of the rich people.

After being rejected twice in a row, Blake realized that he was going to suffer a loss today, and it was impossible for him to get back his face.

Of course, he could continue to bid higher, but it would be meaningless. If he bid too high and all his opponents stopped, he would lose everything. If the bid was too low, it would be useless.
