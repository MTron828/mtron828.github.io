Chapter 3433: The difficulties (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s just a gathering of monsters.” It seems that the seventh level of the trial Pagoda is a test of overall strength!”

Then, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,””It’s not easy to deal with this thing in the main hall!”

The most effective way to deal with the star Fern thorn was to use a fire array.

However, this star Fern thorn had a certain attack range. Once one entered its attack range, it would launch its attack. Xia ruofei had been in the open wasteland previously, so he could avoid the star Fern thorn’s attack range from far away. He set up an array around them and then burned them with fire to his heart’s content.

However, the space in the hall was limited and it was almost filled with star Fern thorns. There was simply not enough space to set up an array.

Moreover, the entrance to the hall was on this side. If he went around the shadow wall, he would be attacked by the star Fern thorn. There was no way to enter the hall to set up an array. Even if there was space, he couldn’t pass through.

“Yup!” Ling Qingxue also noticed the problem.

She had followed Xia ruofei through the star Fern thorn and was very familiar with the star Fern thorn.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””If we really can’t do it, we’ll try to force our way in!”

“Ah?” Ling Qingxue cried out in surprise,”there are so many star Fern thorns. If we force our way in, I’m afraid …”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”we can’t just sit back and do nothing! Let’s try and see if we can make it through! At this stage of the quest, there are no hints. I don’t know how much progress we have made. If we are stuck here, we might not be able to pass the quest!”

“Then …” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but hesitate.

“How about this! Qingxue, you go into the protective magical treasure first. I’m afraid that once I’m surrounded by the star Fern thorns, it’ll be difficult for me to take care of you. If there are any other dangers, we’ll be in trouble!” Xia ruofei said.

In fact, the position of the image wall was basically the blind spot of the star Fern thorn. Ling Qingxue was relatively safe here. However, Xia ruofei could not guarantee that other monsters would not come out from here.

Once he was surrounded by the star Fern thorns, and Ling Qingxue was in danger, he might not be able to take care of her.

Besides, Xia ruofei had also considered that he might need to use the spirit map scroll or even hide in it. Naturally, it was best not to let Ling Qingxue see this scene.

Thus, letting Ling Qingxue enter the “protective array” she thought was the best choice. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ling Qingxue said worriedly,”ruofei, you have to be careful!” I… Why don’t we just forget about it!”

Even though she had only caught a glimpse of them just now, Ling Qingxue had still seen them clearly. The entire Hall was filled with star Fern thorns, and she felt her scalp go numb.

Therefore, when she heard that Xia ruofei was going to force his way in, she was very worried.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry too much. I’ll definitely ensure my own safety first. When I’m safe, I’ll think of a way to deal with these star Fern thorns!” You can rest in the protective magical equipment for a while, or you can just take a nap. By the time you wake up, I’m sure that I’ll have already taken care of it!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”how can I sleep?!” You bastard!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Then listen to some music and read some books. Don’t think too much about it. I’ll let you know as soon as possible no matter if it’s going well or not. I don’t want you to worry!”

“That’s right, you must be careful!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei nodded his head repeatedly. Seeing that Ling Qingxue had finally agreed, he sent her into the small space set up by the mountain and sea realm in the spirit map space.

Then, Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up and he muttered to himself,””I’d like to see how powerful this star Fern thorn is. Even if I can’t use an array, I don’t believe I can’t break through this level!”

With that, Xia ruofei took out the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword. At the same time, he set up a vital Qi barrier and concentrated his energy.

He took a deep breath and walked to the left side of the wall. The star Fern thorns on the right had already attacked. Xia ruofei felt that they were still in a state of alert, so he decided to switch to the other side.

However, it was not too far off. Xia ruofei had just poked his head out when the star Fern nearest to him immediately shot out a dense array of thorns towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s vital Qi Shield was the first to bear the brunt.

The yuan Qi Shield was able to defend against the poisonous mist, but it was naturally useless against the sharp thorns. It was pierced almost as soon as it came into contact with the thorns, and it was riddled with holes.

However, it did slow down the speed of the spikes a little.

Under Xia ruofei’s high concentration, the speed of the thorns seemed to have slowed down. In fact, his brain was working at a high speed, constantly analyzing the trajectory of the thorns.

His figure flickered a few times and deftly avoided the attack of the thorns. At this time, the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword had already shot out like lightning and ruthlessly hacked at the vines of the star Fern thorn.

Xia ruofei’s all – out attack had still caused quite a bit of damage to the star Fern thorn. The branch of the star Fern thorn was split open, and milky white liquid flowed out.

Xia ruofei knew that the star Fern thorn had a strong recovery ability, so he had to continue attacking..
