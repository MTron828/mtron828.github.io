3029 Ignorant and fearless (2)

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be slightly shocked. He quickly said,””Senior Yuntai, please elaborate!”

Scholar Yuntai lazily said,”to put it simply, when you enter the chaotic flow of time, it’s like you’ve fallen into a River. As long as you don’t completely leave this space, you will always be drifting with the current in this River. And different rivers of time have different time flows.” I only observed it briefly, and there are dozens of time turbulences in the space inside this ore, and some of them are even intertwined ... Little brother, your luck is not bad! You just happened to fall into a time turbulence that was most beneficial to you. I just saw a kind of time turbulence that is tens of millions of times slower than the outside world. If you fall into this time turbulence, even if you are only delayed for a short while in this internal space, you will find that the outside world has already changed!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s back broke out in a cold sweat, and he felt a wave of fear.

What was the difference in the flow of time that was tens of millions of times faster?

Even if it was 30 million times, then one second in the ore’s internal space was equivalent to one year in the outside world. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

If Xia ruofei had been trapped in the chaotic flow of time, even if he was lucky enough to escape after being trapped in the space for a few minutes, hundreds of years would have passed in the outside world.

It meant that his body had long been turned into ashes.

Although only a few months would have passed in the outside world due to the time formation flag’s effect on the spirit map space’s primordial realm, it would still cause various problems.

Moreover, this was under the circumstance that he was so lucky that he was only trapped for a few minutes.

If he was trapped for a thousand years like last time ...

It was impossible to calculate the time. Xia ruofei felt that it was no longer a matter of his family and friends leaving this world. Perhaps earth might not even exist anymore ...

Xia ruofei felt a wave of fear. At the same time, he felt that he was extremely lucky.

Layman Yuntai laughed and asked,”little brother, are you scared?” How long do you think we were trapped here last time?”

“A thousand years ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

Layman Yuntai couldn’t help but take a deep breath and said,””That’s really a blessing in the midst of misfortune! If it wasn’t for the fact that the flow of time in the outside world is almost at a standstill compared to the chaotic flow of time you’ve fallen into, your physical body would’ve been destroyed long ago after being trapped for so many years. If you’re caught in that extremely slow turbulence, then it’ll be even worse!”

Xia ruofei sighed,”yeah!” Even now, this junior is still afraid! Ignorance is fearlessness. This is probably what it means!”

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,””Little brother, this can be considered a blessing in disguise! If I’m not wrong, you’ve been studying the laws of space for the past thousand years, trying to find a way to escape! No wonder you have such high attainments in space. You must’ve been able to break through the hidden dimension I left in the storage ring from its origin without triggering the alarm formation I set up, right?”

“Senior, you’re right. I spent almost all that time studying the rules of space,” Xia ruofei said.

The mood of the Grand cloud scholar seemed to be very good. He laughed and said,””This at least explains one thing, and that is that a spirit body can survive in this space for a long time! Then this old master can stay here in peace!”

The small space inside the ore was lifeless. Anyone who entered it would definitely not be a living being. Hence, without asking, the Grand cloud scholar knew that Xia ruofei must have entered in a spiritual state.

Xia ruofei had already used his own experience to prove that at least a spiritual body could survive for a thousand years in the space inside the ore. Of course, master Yuntai was in a good mood.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this. At the same time, he felt that he was lucky.

He knew nothing about the time turbulence. In fact, for cultivators of his level, they were basically in the beginner stage in terms of the rules of space and time. It was just that Xia ruofei had already begun to control the spirit map space before he had even embarked on the cultivation path. In addition, his spiritual power was stronger than cultivators of the same level, so his attainments in the rules of space were naturally higher.

As for the laws of time, he had yet to come into contact with them. He did not even know where the door was.

Time was of the essence just now. Xia ruofei had only chosen a small space based on his intuition. Then, he quickly made a mark and let the spiritual body of the Grand cloud scholar hide in it.

Fortunately, scholar Yuntai had also dabbled in the rules of time and was able to detect the time turbulence.

Otherwise, if layman Yuntai had been trapped in the chaotic flow of time like Xia ruofei, the result would have been completely different.

If the time turbulence that scholar Yuntai was trapped in was similar to the time turbulence that Xia ruofei was trapped in, then it would be fine. He had been in there for hundreds or thousands of years, but only a short time had passed on Xia ruofei’s side. To Xia ruofei, it would only take a moment for scholar Yuntai’s spirit body to be completely recovered.

Of course, for the cultivators on the cloud platform, it was obviously not so wonderful.

However, if the situation was the opposite and the cultivator of the cloud platform was caught in the turbulence of the extremely slow flow of time, Xia ruofei would basically never be able to contact him again.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,””Senior Yuntai, fortunately, you are also proficient in the rules of time. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable. I was too reckless this time!”

“You can’t say that,” said scholar Yuntai with a smile.”The situation was so urgent at that time. You were able to find a treasure that could keep the spirit body from being destroyed for me to use. It was already a life – saving grace to me!” Why would I care so much?”

After saying that, scholar Yuntai paused for a moment and continued,””Actually, my attainments in the laws of time and space are about the same. My attainments in the laws of space are not even as good as yours! Otherwise, how could my hidden space have been so easily broken by you? Hahaha!”

“I guess this is a special case!” Xia ruofei laughed bitterly.”It’s a blessing in disguise for me when it comes to the laws of space. As for the laws of time, I know nothing about them!”

Layman Yuntai said,”for an Aurous core stage cultivator to be able to grasp the rules of space to a certain extent is already considered extremely talented!” The laws of time are basically unknown domain to Aurous core stage cultivators. What you’re doing is within the normal range. In comparison, even if you didn’t have the experience of being trapped for a thousand years, you should’ve already made some achievements in the laws of space, right?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””I have some understanding. I was only able to detect a trace of abnormality in the nested space in senior’s storage ring. It was impossible to crack it, even with conventional methods ... Then, I was unfortunately trapped in this small space group. After a thousand years, when I finally escaped, I found that I could easily crack the nested space!”

Upon hearing this, scholar Yuntai couldn’t help but sigh,””This can be considered a blessing in disguise! Your talent in the laws of space is already stronger than the average cultivator, and in the past thousand years, you’ve spent most of your time studying the laws of space. There are so many small spaces here for you to study the laws of space that are more primitive. The efficiency of this comprehension was at least two to three times that of normal circumstances. How could a cultivator study the laws of space for two to three thousand years? Therefore, if you only look at your attainments in the laws of space, most of the immortal soul Stage cultivators would not be able to reach your level, let alone nascent Soul Stage cultivators!”

When the Golden core evolved into the nascent soul, the cultivator could reach the nascent Soul Stage.

When the Yuanying stage was cultivated to the extreme, one could break through to the primordial spirit stage. As the name suggested, the cultivator’s Yuanying had evolved into a more powerful primordial spirit.

After the primordial soul Stage, it was the leaving aperture stage. At this stage, the cultivator’s spiritual body, or primordial spirit, to be precise, could leave the body. This was an even more powerful stage.

Of course, Xia ruofei was still far from the nascent Soul Stage. As for the primordial spirit and out of body stages, they were even further away.

Hence, when Xia ruofei heard the cultivator of the cloud platform say that his attainment in the rules of space had surpassed most of the primordial soul Stage cultivators, he was stunned.
