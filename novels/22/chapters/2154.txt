2155 The real big gift (1)

Bi youzi seemed to have predicted that Xia ruofei would be stunned after seeing the crystals. He purposely waited for a while before continuing with a smile,””The first two treasures are a small gift from me to you. They can only help your cultivation to a certain extent. The third treasure is what I really want to leave for the fated person of the younger generation! Its value was ten times or even a hundred times more than the first two treasures! What was he hesitating for? Hurry up and open it!”

Xia ruofei was stunned.

The legendary flying sword and the whole box of origin crystals were just appetizers. The value of the third treasure was ten times, or even a hundred times, more than the first two? What was that? Xia ruofei could not imagine it.

In his opinion, if the third treasure was really that valuable, it would not be inferior to his spirit map painting.

Full of anticipation, Xia ruofei looked at the last box.

This box looked exactly the same as the previous two, but in Xia ruofei’s eyes, it was completely different.

Bi youzi, who was on the throne, had entered a ‘pause’ state again. It was obvious that he needed to open the third box to trigger the next video.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and reached for the box with trembling hands.

His hand touched the lid, and then his eyes widened as he opened it with force.

A ray of light shot out from the box. A dark brown wooden board appeared in front of Xia ruofei. It was unknown what kind of wood it was made of, but it was shining with a white light. The wooden token was carved with mysterious array patterns. Even with Xia ruofei’s array Dao cultivation, he could not understand the function of these array patterns. He could not even see the most basic functions.

The moment the box was opened, bi youzi’s smile became even wider. His gaze seemed to travel through time and space as he looked at Xia ruofei, who was in front of the table, and said,””This item is called the mansion – guarding wooden token. It is the control center of this green immortal mansion and even the entire Immortal Island. After refining it, you will be the true master of this green Immortal Island! You’ll be able to use all of the formations and restrictions on the immortal Island as you please. You’ll also be able to use some of the other heavenly materials and earthly treasures, spirit stones, and magical treasures I left in the immortal abode as you please! That’s right, once you completely refine this wooden tablet, you can also find the “blue sword Art” that I left for you! Practicing the secondary Sword Art can maximize the power of the blue travel immortal sword. If you want to ride a flying sword, you must practice this Sword Art!”

Xia ruofei’s body couldn’t help but tremble. There was only one thought in his mind, and that was that Yingluo was rich!

He couldn’t help but think of the spirit herbs and various treasures he had seen along the way. Not only these, but as long as he refined this mansion – guarding wooden token, this entire beautiful immortal mansion and the entire Immortal Island would really belong to him!

There was also the “blue sword technique”. Xia ruofei could not help but think of the legendary swordsmen like the red – Striped maiden and Kong Kong ‘er, who rode their flying swords and took people’s heads from a thousand miles away.

Of course, there was also the sword Kinesis flight. Just thinking about it made him feel excited ...

This was too wonderful!

Bi youzi continued to introduce the wooden token,””Junior, you must be very curious about how to refine this mansion – guarding wooden tablet, right?”

Even though he knew that the image in front of him was just a ‘3D projection’, Xia ruofei could not help but nod and stare at bi youzi.

Bi youzi smiled and said,””The method is very simple. You only need to drip a drop of blood on the wooden token ...”

Xia ruofei immediately forced out a drop of blood from his fingertip.

Before he could drip the drop of blood onto the wooden token, bi youzi continued,””After you drip your blood essence into it, the wooden token will automatically enter your body. Of course, there would be two possibilities. One was to start refining the wooden token; The other possibility is that your body will explode and you will die!”

The drop of blood on Xia ruofei’s fingertip had already started to drip down. After hearing bi youzi’s words, he was so frightened that he immediately waved his hand and a wisp of true Qi swept the drop of blood away.

Then, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly and said,””Daoist priest bi youzi! Master bi! Can you please not take such a long breath when you speak! You’ll die!”

Bi youzi’s image paused for a moment before he chuckled,””Junior, are you scared? I hope you haven’t rashly performed the blood contract before listening to me ...”

Xia ruofei looked at bi youzi unhappily, thinking to himself,”what a senior!” Was it really fun to play with people like this?

Bi youzi smiled and continued,””Actually, as long as you’re cultivating the Orthodox cultivation method of my Dao sect, you don’t have to worry! After the mansion – guarding wooden token is kept in your body, it will automatically sense the vital Qi in your dantian. As long as it’s the vital Qi cultivated by my Orthodox cultivation technique, there won’t be any problems. And if you’re an evil spirit ...”

At this point, bi youzi’s expression changed and he said seriously,””I advise you to take the first two treasures and leave my green travel Immortal Island as soon as possible! Don’t try your luck, the mansion – guarding wooden token is very sensitive to vital Qi. Once it senses evil vital Qi, it will trigger the most powerful attack formation on the wooden token, blowing you into pieces from the inside out!”

After hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shiver. One must know that if this mansion – guarding wooden token was kept in the body, it would appear in the dantian. One could imagine that if it released the strongest array attack in the fragile dantian, even a nascent soul cultivator would die!

Xia ruofei also understood bi youzi’s way of doing things. At first glance, Daoist priest bi youzi was obviously cultivating the Orthodox Daoist technique. Although he was going to escape to the starry sky, he definitely didn’t want the immortal mansion he left behind to fall into the hands of an evil cultivator.

As for the blue travel immortal sword and the origin crystal, in bi youzi’s eyes, their value was probably just ordinary. He must have taken the truly precious treasures with him. And among the things he left behind, the most precious was obviously this mansion – guarding wooden tablet. The flying sword and the origin crystal were only a very unremarkable part of all the wealth he had left behind. If someone from the evil way really came here by fate, bi youzi wouldn’t mind giving him two gifts. But if he wanted to take away the immortal Island and immortal abode together, he couldn ‘t!

However, Xia ruofei started to feel conflicted.

Although he knew that the possibility of the ‘great Dao Arts’ that he cultivated was extremely low, and that his true Qi naturally contained a brilliant righteous aura, there was absolutely no cold aura, no matter how he looked at it, it could not be an evil technique.

However, there was a very serious problem here. Bi youzi had always tacitly agreed that those who could enter this immortal mansion were at least peak Jindan stage cultivators. Therefore, he had always mentioned the “primordial Qi” that only cultivators above the Jindan stage could possess, and not the “true Qi” of Qi refining stage cultivators.

However, Xia ruofei was only a Qi refining cultivator. He only had true Qi in his body.

Could the mansion – guarding wooden token distinguish the nature of genuine Qi? If it mistook the true Qi in his body for demonic Qi of the evil path, wouldn’t he die in vain? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei looked at the residence – guarding wooden token that was emitting a milky white light, feeling extremely conflicted.

To drip blood or not to drip blood, this was the question!

At this moment, bi youzi spoke again ...
