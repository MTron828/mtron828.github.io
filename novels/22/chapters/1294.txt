Feng Rao’s face heated up. She looked up at Xia ruofei and asked,””Really?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”of course!” I’m the boss! One spit, one nail!”

“What about now? Is this considered private?” Feng Rao asked.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister ran! Are you satisfied now?”

Actually, he had long felt that the way he addressed Feng Jing was too formal. It didn’t matter if they addressed each other that way in front of everyone, as it was very necessary. But in private, he kept calling her “Chairman” and “CEO Feng”, which made them seem distant.

In the past, it was nothing. However, as everyone became more familiar with each other and their relationship got closer, it became a little awkward. Besides, Xia ruofei was going to give shares to Feng Jing soon. Although the share was small, they were still considered partners. Therefore, he might as well take this opportunity to solve this problem.

Feng Rao’s aggrieved look was instantly swept away as she chuckled. “That’s more like it. Then I won’t be polite either? When no one else is around, I will call you Ruo Fei?”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said readily,”let’s talk about bojun real estate, then?”

“I’ve wanted to talk about it for a long time, but you’ve never talked about serious things!” Feng Jing glanced at Xia ruofei and sat down on the guest sofa.

Xia ruofei chuckled as he poured Feng Jing a cup of tea and sat down.

“Director ... Ruofei, aren’t you being a little too forceful with regards to the bojun real estate issue?” Feng Rao said worriedly.

Feng Jing was still a little unaccustomed to this sudden change in address.

“Sister ran, don’t you think they’re backing off too quickly?” Xia ruofei smiled.

Feng Rao thought for a moment and said,”indeed!” This was a huge taboo in business negotiations! But they seem to be really in a hurry ...”

“I’ve found out some things. Bojun real estate is in a worse state than the rumors say.” Xia ruofei said,”it’s urgent for them to sell their assets to get back their funds. Of course, there are some specific details that I won’t go into detail. This information will be very helpful for our negotiation!”

“Then ... So they will take the initiative to come to us?” Feng Rao asked.

Xia ruofei nodded.”If nothing goes wrong, I think so. And it’ll be soon!”

“Ruofei, aren’t you worried that they’ll find other buyers?” Feng Jing asked curiously,”the Hengli building is definitely a high – Quality industry. They don’t have to be so fixated on one tree!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s possible, but it’s very unlikely!” Otherwise, they wouldn’t be in such a hurry to talk to us!”

“Why?” Feng Rao was confused.

Xia ruofei revealed an unfathomable expression and said,””Because the others are even worse than us! The business world is like a battlefield. I’m still relatively merciful ...” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Feng Jing was also deep in thought. At this moment, Liu Qian came to Xia ruofei’s office again. This time, she had learned her lesson. Her footsteps were loud and she even knocked on the door.

“Come in!” Xia ruofei asked loudly,”Liu Qian, is there any new news from bojun real estate?”

Liu Qian nodded.”Chairman, President Xu of bojun real estate called in person and asked me to ask about your work arrangements for the afternoon. They hope to come to the farm in the afternoon to discuss the acquisition with us.”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but look deeply at Xia ruofei.
