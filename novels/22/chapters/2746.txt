As soon as he thought of the void exploration mirror, Luo Qingfeng realized that he had been too focused on avoiding the danger and had accidentally thrown the void exploration mirror away.

He quickly turned around to look for it, but where could he find it? The void exploration mirror disappeared just like the blue immortal sword.

Luo Qingfeng’s expression changed drastically. He could not help but secretly regret that he had only been concerned with running for his life and did not hold on tightly to the void exploration mirror.

One had to know that the void exploration mirror was already his most useful magic weapon in this situation, but he had actually thrown it away ...

Qingfeng Luo was very clear that everything in front of him was an illusion. It was impossible for the void exploration mirror to have fallen into the grass and not be found for a while, because the grass itself did not exist.

Perhaps the void exploration mirror was still on the ground, but he could not see it.

And the possibility of this happening was extremely small. Xia ruofei must be hiding somewhere nearby. He probably had already taken this magic treasure away the moment the void exploration mirror fell.

After losing the void exploration mirror, Luo Qingfeng, who was in the illusion, looked even more like a blind man.

He knew that everything in front of him was just an illusion, but he just couldn’t find the way out.

Luo Qingfeng’s face was twisted as he gritted his teeth and said,””I don’t believe that this formation is indestructible! Even if I have to smash it, I’ll smash a way out!”

After saying that, he really did take out a sledgehammer from his storage ring.

The hammer was not an ordinary hammer. It was made of many precious ores. It was the most precious weapon in Qingfeng Luo’s hand besides meteor sword.

He raised the sledgehammer high up in the air, then poured his vital Qi into it and smashed it down on the ground.

The ground trembled slightly, and the soil was sent flying.

However, in the blink of an eye, the hole in the ground was restored to normal.

The valley was still the valley, and the butterflies in the distance were still dancing, as if they were laughing at his overestimation of his ability.

Luo Qingfeng’s face was livid, and he did not hold back at all. He swung the hammer again and again.

This was destined to be a futile effort. The speed at which the ground recovered was even faster than the speed at which he smashed it.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s voice was heard in Luo Qingfeng’s ear.””Sect leader Luo, I’ll give you two choices now. Surrender or die!”

Luo Qingfeng gritted his teeth and roared,’you want me to submit to you? You’re just a kid who hasn’t even reached the Golden core stage? In your dreams!”

After he finished speaking, he swung the sledgehammer and slammed it down on the ground.

Xia ruofei sneered and said,””Since you’re so stubborn, then don’t blame me for being ruthless ...”

After that, Xia ruofei did not make any more sound. The surroundings seemed to have returned to peace.

However, the more it was like this, the more uneasy Luo Qingfeng felt. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Sure enough, after a short while, the blue travel immortal sword appeared behind him silently. Then, it suddenly accelerated and stabbed at Luo Qingfeng’s back.

Luo Qingfeng had been on high alert for a long time. When the blue travel immortal sword began to accelerate, he immediately made a half – turn and lowered his center of gravity, then slashed forward.

However, the distance was too close, and the blue travel immortal sword was extremely fast, so Luo Qingfeng could not completely Dodge it. In the end, the blue travel immortal sword streaked across his arm and disappeared into the void again.

A string of blood flew up. Luo Qingfeng groaned in pain and covered the wound on his arm with his hand.

This was the first time he had been injured and bled since he was trapped in the formation.

“This is just a small lesson. If you’re still stubborn, it won’t be as simple as a cut on your arm next time.” Xia ruofei’s calm voice was heard.

“Kill Me if You Can!” Luo Qingfeng growled in a low voice,”as long as I don’t return to the sect safely, the news of a natural array on this Island will immediately spread to the entire cultivation world! I’d like to see how you deal with the endless troubles!”
