Xia ruofei furrowed his brows and looked at the confident Tian Xiaojun. He did not say anything and continued to brew tea.

Tian Xiaojun’s face flashed with anger as he laughed,”This must be President Xia! We’re Liu Zhe’s friends, and we’ve come uninvited today. We’re sorry to disturb!”

Xia ruofei poured the tea from the sea of tea into a cup and took a sip unhurriedly. Then, he said indifferently,””Since you know you’re disturbing me, why did you come over?”

Tian Xiaojun’s face immediately darkened.

Xia Ling couldn’t help but snort and say,””Young master Tian gave you face and was only polite to you. Who Do You Think You Are?”

Although Zhong Zixin didn’t say anything, she also sneered.

Tian Xiaojun said with a fake smile,”President Xia, please don’t take offense. My brother is straightforward and can’t hide things in his heart.”

Xia ruofei put down his teacup and glanced at Tian Xiaojun and the other two. He asked,””What do you want from me? My time is limited. ”

Tian Xiaojun pretended to be forthright and laughed,”President Xia, this is not how you treat your guests! Since we’re already here, we can at least sit down and ask for a cup of tea, right?”

Xia ruofei immediately said,”forget about tea. I’m used to being straightforward. I only drink tea when I’m chatting with my friends. If you have anything to say, just get straight to the point!”

Tian Xiaojun’s eyes flashed with a trace of coldness. However, when he thought about the sales of the jaded skin ointment online, he suppressed his emotions and even waved his hand to stop Xia Ling, who was about to flip out.

“I can see that President Xia is a straightforward person, so let’s not beat around the bush,” Tian Xiaojun said with a smile. Let me introduce myself first! My name is Tian Xiaojun, and I work for ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”I’m clear about your background. Let’s get straight to the point.”

Tian Xiaojun stared at Xia ruofei with burning eyes and said,”President Xia, are you sure about our background?”

Xia ruofei’s mouth twitched and he said,””If you’re talking about the leaders of your fathers, then I’m sure.”

Tian Xiaojun’s eyelids twitched. It seemed like Xia ruofei had gotten the details from Liu Zhe.

However, since he knew the background of the three of them, Xia ruofei could still remain so calm. Moreover, his attitude was neither warm nor cold. This made Tian Xiaojun feel a little uneasy.

However, on second thought, he realized that paradise Corporation was just a small company in the outskirts of Sanshan city. They were only lucky to have developed a popular product like the jaded skin cream, which caused their net worth to double. Even if Xia ruofei had some background, it couldn’t be in the capital.

Didn’t Liu Zhe say that Xia ruofei was close to song Qiming’s daughter, Song Wei? Perhaps this was what Xia ruofei was relying on? Tian Xiaojun quickly analyzed the situation in his mind. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If that was the case, then this local boss was too naive! Tian Xiaojun sneered to himself.

If it was Song Wei’s own company, Tian Xiaojun would have to weigh the pros and cons. After all, song Qiming was a powerful Deputy Director. However, what was Xia ruofei? Did he really think that he could do whatever he wanted in the three mountains just because he had a relationship with Song Wei?

Just a little of their connections would be enough to cause trouble for the Paradise Corporation!

Thinking of this, Tian Xiaojun became more confident.

Of course, this was also because of money. With a monthly revenue of 200 to 300 million, and it was the extremely profitable cosmetics industry, such a huge profit was in front of him, and it had already made Tian Xiaojun’s judgment irrational.

A confident smile appeared on his face again as he said,””Since you’re already clear about it, I won’t waste any more time. Today, I’m mainly acting as a middleman. My younger brother wants to discuss business with President Xia. Speaking of which, he’s from President Xia’s main family!”

Seeing that Tian Xiaojun was talking about her, Xia Ling also cooperated and laughed, revealing her yellow teeth. However, her smile was not friendly, and coupled with the faint threat, it looked a little sinister.

Xia ruofei calmly leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. He asked with interest,””Business with me? What business do we have to talk about?”

Tian Xiaojun smiled and gestured to Xia Ling.

Xia Ling immediately stepped forward and stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes. She said loudly,””President Xia, I’m running an investment company and I feel that your paradise Corporation has a good future. That’s why I’m here to give you some money!”

Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud. The corner of his mouth twitched as he asked,””Give me money? How do you want me to send you off?”

“Our lucky capital is preparing to invest in the peach blossom company.” Xia Ling said confidently,”I think a start – up company like yours needs development funds the most, so I’m here to give you money.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”thank you for your kind intentions, CEO Xia. However, our paradise Corporation has sufficient cash flow. We don’t have any plans to finance our company for the time being.”

Xia Ling’s face suddenly darkened, and she said gloomily,”President Xia, you mean ... You’re not giving me face?”

Xia ruofei’s eyes widened, and he asked in confusion,””What do you mean? Wasn’t doing business all about mutual consent? We don’t need any financing for the time being, and I’ve also expressed my gratitude for your ‘good intentions’. How can you say that I’m not giving you face?”
