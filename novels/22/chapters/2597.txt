2598 Meeting again (1)

Liu Qunfeng quickly ran down to bid Xia ruofei farewell and watched as he got into the car and left.

Last time, Liu Qunfeng was more or less reserved in front of Xia ruofei. At least, he was reserved in his heart. This time, he was not reserved at all. He was very humble.

“Where are we going, boss?” Wu Qiang asked while driving.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Let’s go to the peach blossom gathering first!”

Since they were already in the capital, Xia ruofei felt that song Rui and the others would definitely reprimand him if he hid in the courtyard house. Rather than that, it would be better to take the initiative to go over.

Besides, the Paradise Club had just opened recently. As one of the major shareholders, Xia ruofei should go and understand the situation.

“Alright!” Wu Qiang nodded.

The car drove all the way to Xiaotang town. The traffic in the capital city was as congested as ever, but Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He leaned against the soft leather first – Class seat and chatted with Wu Qiang. Occasionally, he would tease Wu Qiang about his relationship with Xia Xiaolan.

After leaving the city, the car gradually picked up speed.

It took Xia ruofei about an hour to get from the Liu family’s residence to the Paradise gathering.

All the security guards of the Paradise Club recognized Xia ruofei’s Toyota Elfa car, so they let the car through when it arrived at the entrance. The security guard even saluted the car and quickly used the walkie – talkie to inform the people inside the club. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When Alphard arrived at the main building of the club, song Rui and Hou Liang were already waiting with the club manager. Xia ruofei sat in the car and saw song Rui and Hou Liang looking forward to it from a distance. She couldn’t help but feel warm inside.

Although this group of brothers were a little foppish, they really treated him well.

The car had just stopped when song Rui and Hou Liang came up to them. The electric car door slowly slid open with a beeping sound, revealing a smiling Xia ruofei inside the car. Since the brothers were so enthusiastic, he had to be more enthusiastic too!

Before the car door was fully opened, Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Xiao Rui! Liangzi!”

Song Rui and Hou Liang finally saw that the person in the car was indeed Xia ruofei. Song Rui’s face lit up and he looked extremely happy. On the other hand, Hou Liang was slightly dejected.

Xia ruofei was confused.

Just then, song Rui extended his hand toward Hou Liang and said,””Pay up! Don’t try to renege on your debt!”

Annoyed, Hou Liang took out his wallet, counted three 100 – Yuan bills, and slapped them on song Rui’s hand. He then said,””I’ll bet with you again that I’m the grandson!”

Song Rui flicked the notes in his hand and said,””This flag is raised too early! Don’t slap your own face when the time comes!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei finally found a chance to speak. He asked,””Can you two tell me what’s going on?”

“It’s nothing,” song Rui said loudly.”I made a bet with liangzi two days ago. I said that you would definitely come to Beijing in three days, but he said that it was impossible. So, we made a small bet! Hehe! Liangzi, this bro’s divine foresight, do you accept it?”

“Brother Rui, don’t take advantage of me!” Hou Liang said gloomily.

Song Rui couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

Xia ruofei was speechless. I was so na?ve to think that the two of them were here to welcome me. I was even a little touched when I saw how they were looking forward to it. What the f * ck!

Xia ruofei walked to song Rui and took the money from him.

In front of Xia ruofei’s speed, song Rui could not resist at all. When he came back to his senses, the money in his hand was already in Xia ruofei’s hands.

“AI! RUO Fei, give me back my money!” “That’s my trophy!” Song Rui shouted.

Xia ruofei symbolically counted, then took out a card and handed it to song Rui.””We’re all Good Brothers, what’s there to split? Old rules! We’ll split it in half when we meet!”

“Why are we following the old rules? Why do you want half?” Song Rui shouted,”there’s no such thing! Hurry up and return the money to me!”

Xia ruofei folded the notes and put them in his pocket. Then, he said,””You guys actually dared to use me as a bet, you’re getting more and more gutsy! What’s the big deal with me giving you two hundred Yuan? This is my appearance fee! Do you know how popular I am on the internet now? An appearance fee of two hundred Yuan is simply a low price!”

Song Rui couldn’t help but exclaim,”even if we split it in half, it’s not as much as 200 yuan!” It’s only three hundred Yuan in total!”

“Do you want me to tear half of it off and give it to you?” Xia ruofei said unhappily. Then, he laughed and said,”how can we split the three notes evenly? It would definitely be one more person and one less person! What’s wrong with me taking a little more? If we round it up, wouldn’t it be the same for the two of them?”

“There’s such a way to round things up?” Song Rui widened his eyes and said,”you are the most shameless person I have ever met!”

Xia ruofei laughed nonchalantly and said,”You flatter me! You’re too kind!”

“I’m complimenting you!” Song Rui couldn’t help but say,”besides ... Why don’t I take more and you take less?”

“Because I’m more handsome than you!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”besides, are you as popular as me?”

“Blargh ...” Song Rui made an exaggerated vomiting gesture, then waved his hand and said,”fine, fine, fine. I’ll let you take advantage of me!” As long as you don’t disgust me, it’s fine!”
