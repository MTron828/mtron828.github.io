3026 Saving a person is like putting out a fire (1)

Xia ruofei smiled and replied,”it’s just a small trick!” The method I used to break the nested space was a little unconventional, but I managed to avoid the warning formation by accident. ”

“Oh?” Upon hearing this, the illusory figure of scholar Yuntai asked with great interest,”how did you break the nested space? tell me quickly!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he looked at master Yuntai and asked,””Senior Yuntai, don’t you feel something is wrong?”

“What’s wrong?” Scholar Yuntai said urgently,”Hey! Don’t bother about what’s wrong! Little doll, tell me what method you used to crack the nested space!”

Xia ruofei didn’t answer the question. Instead, he looked at the figure of the cloud platform scholar and asked,””Senior, do you really not feel like your entire body is being burned by the sun, and your spirit body is gradually melting?”

Xia ruofei was very clear about this situation of the master of cloud platform. It could be said that it was engraved in his heart.

Because he had just experienced it once.

After he had escaped from the ore’s internal space and returned to the spirit map space, he felt as if his entire body was being burned by a raging fire. Although his spirit body had only stayed outside for a short time before automatically returning to his physical body, that short period of time had still caused some damage to his spirit body.

This layman Yuntai in front of him was obviously in a spirit body state.

Besides, Xia ruofei judged that this was probably not a complete spiritual body. It was similar to the thought that immortal mountain river had left behind last time. However, it was probably not just the thought of this scholar Yuntai. He had directly cut off a small part of the spiritual body and sealed it in the spatial stone.

Therefore, Xia ruofei was very curious. Could it be that scholar Yuntai’s spiritual body could easily stay in the outside world without the protection of his physical body?

Scholar Yuntai waved his hand impatiently and said,””You little kid! Wasn’t that nonsense? Without the protection of the physical body, how could the spirit body not feel the pain of being burned by the fire and gradually melt away? I’m not a leaving aperture stage cultivator!”

Without waiting for Xia ruofei to speak, master Yuntai continued,””It’s precisely because of this that this old master is asking you to quickly tell me! This old man doesn’t have much time left!”

Xia ruofei really didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He was about to disappear forever, but scholar Yuntai was still concerned about how his early warning array had been avoided.

Even if you know, what can you do?

He was about to fall into eternal darkness, and it was very likely that his soul would be destroyed, so what was the point of caring about such trivial matters?

Could this be the so – called “hearing the Dao in the morning and dying in the evening”?

The Phantom of the cloud platform scholar saw that Xia ruofei was still in a daze and didn’t say a word. He couldn’t help but urge,””Little doll! I’m about to die, can’t you even fulfill my dying wish? Even if it involves some confidential information, it’s fine if you tell me! Dead people can’t reveal any secrets!”

Xia ruofei came back to his senses and quickly said,””Senior Yuntai, please wait a moment!”

After that, Xia ruofei said to Bai Qingqing,””Little white, there’s nothing else for you to do here. Go and play!”

It was only then that scholar Yuntai noticed Bai Qingqing lying in the grass. He couldn’t help but show a strange expression and said,””It’s a realm Fox? This kind of spirit beast is not common!”

Bai Qingqing was enjoying the show! In the end, Xia ruofei suddenly asked it to leave. Naturally, it would not accept it.

However, before it could protest, Xia ruofei wrapped Bai Qingqing with his spatial energy and threw it far away into a corner of the space.

Before Bai Qingqing could curse, Xia ruofei had blocked her from speaking.

Now, Xia ruofei’s understanding of the laws of space had surpassed Bai Qingqing ‘s. In addition, he had absolute control over the spirit map space. In this place, he could easily beat Bai Qingqing up.

Upon seeing this scene, even scholar Yuntai was dumbfounded. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“His control over space has already reached such a level! Even my space pet, the realm Fox, couldn’t put up any resistance!” Layman Yuntai muttered to himself,”this ... Is this still a golden core cultivator? Are all golden core cultivators so powerful now?”

Actually, layman Yuntai had misunderstood. If they were in the outside world, Xia ruofei could also suppress Bai Qingqing in terms of space rules, but it was impossible for him to suppress Bai Qingqing in all aspects.

Even if Bai Qingqing wanted to escape, Xia ruofei would not be able to control her.

The main reason why he was able to have absolute control was because everyone was in the spirit map space.

This was equivalent to Xia ruofei’s home ground!

It was obvious that scholar Yuntai had also discovered the clue. He closed his eyes and sensed carefully for a while. Then, he suddenly opened his eyes and was dumbfounded for a long time.”This ... This ... Little brother, we’re actually in a small space now?”

For such a discovery, layman Yuntai was shocked to the extreme. In the era he lived in, it was not that there was no small space that could accommodate life, but it was already extremely rare. But now, there was a small space as big as this, not only was the spiritual Qi rich, but it could also allow life to live in it. Even layman Yuntai had never heard of it.

Strictly speaking, this was no longer a simple small space. It would be more appropriate to call it a small world.

The reason why scholar Yuntai didn’t realize that he was in a small space was because the mountain and sea realm was so vast that one couldn’t see its end. More importantly, the rules in the spirit map space were very close to the outside world. Even a cultivator with good attainments in space like scholar Yuntai wouldn’t be able to find any clues if he didn’t look carefully.

Unknowingly, the way master Yuntai addressed Xia ruofei had changed from “little doll” to “little brother”. One could see how shocked he was.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Senior Yuntai, this is indeed a small space.”

Then, Xia ruofei immediately said,””Senior Yuntai, let’s not talk about this for now! Your spirit body has been severely damaged. I don’t think you can hold on for long!”

“Of course I know!” Scholar Yuntai smiled bitterly. That’s why I want you to quickly tell me how to crack the nested space! It’s just that little brother, you’ve been dilly – dallying, and now you’ve let me know about the existence of this small world ... There are too many things I want to know, but there’s not enough time!”

“Senior, please follow me!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

With that, Xia ruofei led the way and led the spiritual body of scholar Yuntai directly into the stone room in the cave.

Xia ruofei was the master of the spirit map space. If he wanted to let scholar Yuntai’s spirit body into the stone room, it was naturally just a matter of a thought.

When they entered the stone chamber, Xia ruofei had already set up layers of shield outside the cave. He did not need to use any array talismans here. He could easily do it by using spatial power.

Now, it was equivalent to completely isolating the stone room from the rest of the spirit map space.

Layman Yuntai asked with some confusion,””Little brother, what are you doing? I really don’t have much time left ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t reply to scholar Yuntai. Instead, with a thought, he directly took the mysterious ore wrapped in layers of spatial energy from the Archean realm into the cave.

He removed the invisible spatial force on the surface of the mysterious ore and asked,””Senior Yuntai, can you recognize what this is?”

Scholar Yuntai took a few glances and frowned.””I’m not too sure. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such an ore. However...The spatial fluctuations within this ore seem to be rather intense!”

“Senior, you’ve never seen it before either ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel disappointed.

During the auction, Chen Xuan had explained the origin of this ore. It came from the ruins of an ancient cultivator, which was excavated from the cave of a cultivator in the same era as Yuntai scholar.

The spatial structure of this mysterious ore was so magical that it could directly suck a cultivator’s spirit into it and allow the spirit to survive for a long time. Even in the ancient cultivation world, such a function should be very magical and famous.

Therefore, Xia ruofei thought that layman Yuntai would be able to recognize him at a glance.

He didn’t expect that even scholar Yuntai had never seen this ore before.

In other words, it could be in the ancient cultivation world, or the owner of this mysterious ore had concealed the news and made a fortune in silence; Or, even the owner of the mysterious ore didn’t discover its secret, and only obtained it by chance, then casually saved it and kept it.

...

No matter which possibility it was, at least for now, it was difficult for Xia ruofei to further understand the information of this mysterious ore.

The only way was to find out which ancient cultivator’s ruin this ore was excavated from the next time he saw Chen Xuan. Then, he should be able to find out more about this ancient cultivator from Yuntai layman, and then make further deductions.

Of course, the premise was that the spirit body of layman Yuntai could survive until then.

At this time, the situation of layman Yuntai was quite bad. His spirit body seemed to have become more illusory.

“Little brother, I don’t have much time,” said scholar Yuntai.”If you have anything else you want to ask, just ask!”

From the moment master Yuntai came out of the spatial rock, his impression of Xia ruofei had always been mysterious. Now, he didn’t expect to get anything from Xia ruofei, so he might as well be more straightforward and let Xia ruofei ask whatever questions he had.

Xia ruofei also came back to his senses. He knew that the most important thing now was to let scholar Yuntai live.

He looked at the mysterious ore on the stone platform, and his heart couldn’t help but tremble.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and carefully released his spiritual power to explore the mysterious ore.

The spirit was maintained for about one – fifth of a second before it was devoured without any suspense.

Xia ruofei didn’t stop. He continued to input his spiritual power and analyzed the information he had found.

...

He didn’t dare to split nine streams of mental power to investigate like last time.

Moreover, his mental power was still quite abundant, so he was more confident.

As expected, after a while, the mysterious ore did not have any strange movements. Xia ruofei was slightly relieved.

He quickly analyzed the information he got from his spiritual force.

On the other side, scholar Yuntai saw that Xia ruofei was engrossed in checking the stone and did not care about him. He felt that the burning sensation was getting stronger and stronger, and the spirit body was so weak that it was almost disappearing.

Scholar Yuntai couldn’t help but sigh,”did I meet a fool?”

At this moment, Xia ruofei had already done his analysis at the fastest speed possible. Then, he used his spiritual power to mark the surface of the ore and shouted,””Senior Yuntai, quickly follow the path I marked and enter the internal space of this ore!”
