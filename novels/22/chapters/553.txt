Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”that works too!” After this batch of maple fights is done, I’ll pick a few people to come back with your Masters and let them study here. ”

Then, Xia ruofei continued,”however, before our people finish their apprenticeship, we will still settle the fees according to the rules. This is my bottom line. If you still don’t agree, I’d rather find someone else to help!”

Qian Lijun and his father looked at each other before he helplessly shook his head and said,”Alright then! You’re still the same as when you were in the Army, a stubborn donkey!”

“This is called sticking to principles!” Xia ruofei grinned.

After they finished talking about business, dinner was ready, so boss Qian and his son invited everyone to the table for dinner.

Naturally, there were many toasts during the banquet. Especially since Xia ruofei and Qian Lijun had not seen each other for many years, their friendship was reflected in the wine glasses.

Back then, Qian Lijun’s small body was relatively weak, and his alcohol tolerance was average. Xia ruofei’s alcohol tolerance was already quite good back then. Now that he had taken so much body tempering soup, he was even more fierce.

Very soon, Qian Lijun went under the table while drinking.

Boss Qian and CEO Lin also drank a lot, so everyone was happy.

Boss Qian got someone to clean up two guest rooms. That night, Xia ruofei and CEO Lin stayed in boss Qian’s Dendrobium candids cultivation base.

The next morning, boss Qian arranged for the most experienced master in their cultivation base, old Luo, to return to the southeast province with Xia ruofei.

Qian Lijun had originally wanted to keep Xia ruofei to play for a few days, but considering that the fresh Ironhide vessel strips had to be harvested and made into fengdou as soon as possible, he did not dare to delay Xia ruofei’s time.

Before he left, Qian Lijun repeatedly warned,”Ruofei, time is too tight this time. I didn’t have time to contact my comrades in the same batch in Anyue city. You must come back after you’re done with this. Don’t you have to send workers for training? I’ll take you to laoyan mountain to have some fun. Let’s call a few more comrades and have a good gathering!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”contact Pan Qiang, Wang Zhihai, and the others first. I’ll come back again after I’m done with fengdou.”

Pan Qiang and Wang Zhihai were Xia ruofei’s comrades who had joined the Army in the same year. Among this batch of soldiers from the Yue Kingdom, besides Qian Lijun, these two were the closest to Xia ruofei.

“Alright!” Qian Lijun said. Then you guys drive slowly! If you need anything, just let me know! You don’t have to be so polite with your brother!”

CEO Lin drove the car personally as usual. Xia ruofei took old Luo’s ID card and booked two afternoon tickets to Sanshan city on the way.

As the time was close, CEO Lin drove Xia ruofei and Xia ruofei to Xiaoshan airport. They had lunch near the airport, and Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to CEO Lin.

This time, it was all thanks to the enthusiastic President Lin. Otherwise, things wouldn’t have gone so smoothly, and he wouldn’t have been able to contact Qian Lijun again.

Even if President Lin did this for his own performance, Xia ruofei still sincerely thanked him.

As for occasionally getting him some wild ginseng or selling him the iron – skinned fengdou, it didn’t matter. Anyway, they were all selling it for money, so it didn’t matter who he sold it to.

There were still about an hour before the boarding time. Xia ruofei simply brought old Luo to change their boarding pass and waited in the waiting hall.

Old Luo’s master was in his 50s. He had been working in the Dendrobium base all year round, so his skin was dark and there were many wrinkles on his face.

However, old Luo’s master was quite talkative, especially when it came to the iron – skinned fengdou. He was even more eloquent. Xia ruofei was not one to put on airs, so while waiting to board the plane, the two of them had a good chat.

As they were chatting, Xia ruofei suddenly asked,””Oh right, master Luo, I heard from CEO Lin yesterday that uncle Qian’s business used to be quite big?”

“Isn’t that so!” Master Luo sighed.”Don’t think that the Dendrobium candidly grow well these past two years! A few years back, our boss was really down and out ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei felt that there was a story behind this!

He wasn’t someone who liked to gossip, but he was bored while waiting for the plane, so he couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Master Luo, then what happened a few years ago?”

Master Luo said,”if you ask someone else, they might not know. But I’ve been working in their Dendrobium base for more than ten years. I still know a little about the Qian family!”

Xia ruofei nodded and listened to master Luo attentively.

Master Luo continued,”our boss started his business with Chinese medicinal herbs. This iron – Skin Dendrobium base is only a small business. When our boss was at his peak, his assets were over a hundred million!”

Xia ruofei knew that master Luo wasn’t boasting about how Qian Lijun was a rich young master back then! He remembered that when they had first arrived at the recruit company, the platoon leader had checked everyone’s luggage. That guy had a big bag full of branded clothes, snacks, and all kinds of small electrical appliances, including mobile phones, game consoles, and Bluetooth earphones.

After this reunion, Xia ruofei could clearly feel the change in Qian Lijun. He was no longer the young master who was not diligent and could not differentiate between food and drink. It was obvious that he often helped out with the household chores. His hands were obviously rough.
