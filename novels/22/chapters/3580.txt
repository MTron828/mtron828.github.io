When Xue Jinshan heard this, he broke out in cold sweat.

Although Xia ruofei had voluntarily withdrawn from the daily management of the company, he was like a totem to the Paradise Corporation. His influence in the company would not weaken even a little because he had withdrawn from the daily management of the company.

After all, Xia ruofei still retained his position as the chairman of the company.

Moreover, even if Xia ruofei did not hold any position, he was still the major shareholder of the company. His words were still the most important person in paradise Corporation.

Xue Jinshan was a little terrified and quickly said,”President Xia, this is all due to my negligence at work! The Chinese medicine plantation project is too rushed, we’ll rectify it immediately!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” He had to handle it well! A small number of village cadres here directly embezzled half of the land circulation fund. This is the real money we paid in advance! There’s a reason why 1 want you to call the police.”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Xue Jinshan said.

“But…” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”don’t kill him with one blow.” Since you have chosen the site around Jiangying village, it must have been fully verified. In addition, the villagers are innocent. So, if there are no other serious problems, there is no need to choose a new site for this land transfer project. As long as we can find the people with the problem, hold them accountable, and recover our losses, the cooperation can still continue.

“Understood!” Xue Jinshan said,”we will definitely follow your instructions strictly!”

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he turned to look at his godmother, Jiang Cuihua.

In such a noisy setting, Jiang Cuihua appeared to be all alone.

She didn’t follow the villagers to find trouble with Jiang Dashan. She stood there alone, her eyes full of sorrow.

Speaking of which, Jiang Dashan and Jiang Hua were all relatives of her, but she had become a piece of fat meat in the eyes of others. The kind would be bullied by others. The coldness of this world was really reflected to the extreme in this matter.

Xia ruofei walked over and said softly,””Godmother, let’s go! Don’t worry, Jiang Hua will obediently return your land circulation money very soon.”

“Alright! Let’s go back!” Jiang Cuihua said.

The matters here had nothing to do with her anymore, and she didn’t want to care about these messy things.

The two of them left together, leaving the noisy villagers and Jiang Dashan, who was sweating profusely.

Jiang Cuihua did not ask Xia ruofei why he let Jiang Hua go so easily. She knew that Xia ruofei must have had his reasons for doing so. She also believed that since Xia ruofei said that Jiang Hua would obediently return the money, he would definitely do so. There would not be any changes.

Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV off – Road vehicle and left Jiangying village with his godmother, Jiang Cuihua. They headed straight for the city.

On the way, Xia ruofei met a black Magotan car from Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. It was Xue Jinshan’s car. Not far behind Xue Jinshan’s car, there was a police car with flashing lights. They must be the police from the town police station since they could arrive so quickly.

However, Xia ruofei did not stop the car. He did not even say goodbye to Xue Jinshan through the window. He just passed by and continued to drive into the city.

Xia ruofei was definitely not satisfied with Xue Jinshan’s work. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In order to show the company’s sincerity, it wasn’t a problem to pay for the land transfer fee. But the problem was that before the official contract was signed, the Tao Yuan pharmaceutical factory didn’t manage the funds effectively. This was a major mistake in their work.

However, since Xue Jinshan had been following him since the beginning of Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory, Xia ruofei did not blame him. To put it bluntly, he wanted to see how he would handle the following matters. If he could make up for the lost sheep and minimize the losses, he would be able to pick out those low – Level leeches. Then, Xia ruofei would not be too harsh on Xue Jinshan.

However, if it was not handled well, or if it was just a perfunctory act to deceive people, then Xia ruofei would not show mercy just because Xue Jinshan was his direct descendant.

After Xia ruofei sent Jiang Cuihua home, he didn’t stay for long. He sat for a while and comforted his godmother before he got up and left.

Lin Qiao had gone out with her classmates early in the morning. Jiang Cuihua could have some time to herself. Today’s incident had a huge impact on her.

Xia ruofei drove back to the jiangbin villa district.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were spending New Year’s with their families. These few days were either family gatherings or visiting relatives and friends. They would definitely be busy for a few days. It was not convenient for Xia ruofei to join in the fun, so he hid at home alone and used his free time to reply to WeChat and text messages. He had received a lot of well – wishes and New Year greetings during the new year and needed to deal with them all at once.

Xia ruofei spent the rest of the time cultivating.

Although the efficiency of cultivation here was not as high as on the Peach Blossom Island, at least he could maintain his condition. After all, cultivation was like rowing a boat against the current. If he did not cultivate for a long time, his cultivation level would definitely decline slowly.

It was the new year, and it would definitely feel a little lonely to be alone in an empty villa.

However, after so many years, Xia ruofei had gotten used to this kind of loneliness. He even felt at ease.

Soon, two days had passed. Xia ruofei stayed alone in the jiangbin villa community. Whenever he thought of it, he would make a good meal for himself. The rest of the time, he was either cultivating or sitting on the balcony reading or daydreaming. It was quite a pleasant time..
