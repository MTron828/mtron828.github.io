2302 Suspicious points (2)

Guangzhi Cao hadn’t been in this position for long, and he wasn’t qualified for a promotion. Plus, he was in a car accident. If song Qiming really couldn’t be saved, Guangzhi Cao would probably be assigned to an idle position, and he might have to waste the rest of his life.

Of course, other than his own political interests, song Qiming was also concerned about Guangzhi Cao. Personally, Guangzhi Cao did not want anything to happen to song Qiming.

Xia ruofei replied casually,”he’s still the same. I don’t think he’s in danger. It’s just that it’s troublesome that he hasn’t woken up. We need to think of another way ...”

Guangzhi Cao quickly said,”that’s right, that’s right ... President Xia, please take care of this. Secretary song can’t be in trouble!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re being too polite. How can I not be concerned about uncle song’s matter?”

Guangzhi Cao came back to his senses and quickly said,”Look at my mouth! President Xia and Secretary song were on the same side. How could they not be attentive? President Xia, please don’t take offense! I’m just being too concerned ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”brother Cao, I’m not that petty!” By the way, how are the police’s arrangements?”

“I’ve arranged for them to be there,” Guangzhi Cao said.”The provincial Department has sent special police over to take care of aunt Fang and Song Wei’s safety. They’ve followed your orders and are protecting them in secret.”

“Where’s the truck driver?”Xia ruofei nodded.

“The police will focus on the investigation.” Guangzhi Cao said,”he should still be under the control of the traffic police ...” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

However, things didn’t go as planned. Guangzhi Cao’s phone rang before he could finish his sentence. He walked to the side and answered the call for a while, then walked over with a serious face.

Xia ruofei looked at his expression and knew that it was not good news.

“Director Xia, the driver ran away!” Guangzhi Cao said.

“He ran away?” Xia ruofei could not help but raise his voice.”Isn’t he under the police’s control? Why did you suddenly run away?”

Guangzhi Cao said dejectedly,”The highway Traffic police said that the driver was also injured, but his life was not in danger. They took a brief statement and sent him to the hospital for treatment. The hospital was very busy today, so it took a long time. After receiving my news, the police were worried that something might go wrong, so they sent a few more policemen to help. The purpose was to keep an eye on him. Unexpectedly, this guy was very alert. When he saw the reinforcements, he probably realized that something was wrong and ran away in the chaos ...”

Xia ruofei found it unbelievable, but he could not comment on the police’s ability. He could only shake his head, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Then, he immediately asked,”What about his car? Do you have any clues?”

“It’s also a car with a fake license plate!”Guangzhi Cao said with a bitter smile. The police didn’t notice it at first, but after he ran away, the police got the information on the car and found the owner, then they realized that something was wrong!”

“It’s not an accident!” Xia ruofei said decisively.”There’s at least an 80% chance that it was a planned attack and not an accident!”

Guangzhi Cao nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei continued,”brother Cao, we have to strengthen the security!” Although he couldn’t be completely sure, the possibility of a premeditated attack was higher! Furthermore, the enemy is in the dark while we’re out in the open. If we’re not careful, it’s easy for problems to arise again!”

Guangzhi Cao shivered and said,”that makes sense!” If this was a planned attack, then the enemy in the dark is too terrifying!”

The assassination of a leader like song Qiming, coupled with the song family, was definitely a big deal. Anyone who dared to commit such a shocking crime was definitely a fugitive. The people behind them were likely to be directly related to some big family.

If this attack did not succeed, no one knew when the next one would come and who the target would be.

“I have to report this to the higher – ups immediately!” Guangzhi Cao said.

Xia ruofei nodded in agreement and said,””It’s very necessary, and we have to be fully prepared this time. We can’t have any more safety issues!”

“En!” Guangzhi Cao said,”President Xia, I’ll take my leave now! I’ll have to trouble you to take care of Secretary song!”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m here. Uncle song will be fine!”

Guangzhi Cao left in a hurry with a serious face. Xia ruofei took the elevator to the floor where Fang Liyun and Song Wei were resting.

As soon as he got out of the elevator, he found several plainclothes policemen hiding in the dark. He thought to himself that the police were quite efficient, but it seemed that they were not capable enough to deal with those experienced fugitives ...

“Mr. Xia!” The female staff member sent by the municipal Party Committee to take care of Fang Liyun was sitting on a long bench in the corridor of the ward. She immediately stood up and greeted Xia ruofei when she saw him.

“Hello, are aunt Fang and Song Wei still resting?” Xia ruofei asked.

“They’re not asleep yet. They’re talking in the room!”

“Alright, thank you!” Xia ruofei said politely.

Then, he came to the door of the ward, knocked on it, and said,””Aunt Fang! It’s me!”

The whispering in the room immediately stopped, and then Fang Liyun said loudly,”RUO Fei! Hurry up and come in! Hurry and come in!”
