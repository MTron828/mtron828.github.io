Chapter 1612: Siheyuan’s night talk Part 2

When they were about to arrive, Xia ruofei realized that the car was not heading for liuhai Lane but the road behind the house.

He came back to his senses and said with a smile,””I haven’t come back to take a look at the siheyuan after it was renovated!”

Back then, Xia ruofei had decided to open a door in the backyard and use the empty rooms to transform into two garages. Now that the car was driving on this road, it was natural to go to the backyard.

Wu Qiang focused on driving as he said,”Boss, even I feel that it’s a bit hot to receive such a high salary ... You rarely come to Beijing a few times a year, and I usually have nothing to do ...”

“Who said that?” Xia ruofei said,”you have to manage and maintain such a big house. Isn’t that your job?”

“It’s just doing some cleaning and trimming the flowers and plants. This job is really too easy ...”Wu Qiang smiled bitterly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if you’re too free, then find something to do!” It’s fine to read more books! “If you learn from the security guards at Capital University, you might even be able to get an undergraduate or graduate degree ...”

“Please spare me!” Wu Qiang quickly said. I feel dizzy just by looking at books ...”

“Hahaha ...”

As the two of them chatted, the car had already driven to the back wall of the courtyard.

Xia ruofei saw that there was a wide back door. There was no threshold either. Instead, it was made into a slope for vehicles to enter and exit.

Wu Qiang picked up the remote control on the center console and pressed it gently. The electric door slowly opened to the sides, and the car drove in directly.

The cars behind them also entered. There were only two garages, but the backyard was quite spacious, so it was not a problem to place a few cars in the open air.

Everyone got out of their cars. Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and Zhuo Yiyi had already been here when Xia ruofei bought the house, but it was the first time for Hou Liang, Xu Zixuan, and Song Wei.

The moment Hou Liang and the others alighted from the car, they were stunned by the spacious and luxurious courtyard house. They couldn’t wait to take a look.

Xia ruofei also wanted to see how the changes he had requested were going, so he gladly agreed and led everyone to the courtyard at the back to look around the siheyuan.

When everyone saw the three – story courtyard house and saw the luxury of the Beile mansion, they were all envious, especially when they saw that the courtyard house actually had a two – story spacious basement.

“It’s good to be rich!” Hou Liang said emotionally,”this is the most central area of Beijing! How many people can’t even afford a house as big as a pigeon cage, and you’re actually sitting in a large courtyard with three entrances! There’s no justice in this world ...”

Xu Zi Xuan also echoed,”there’s actually a two – story basement, and it’s actually a basement with proper procedures ... There’s a VIP theater in the house ... Heavens!” Why can’t I have such a good thing?”

“Even if there’s such a good opportunity, you still need to have the money to buy it! RUO Fei had spent more than a hundred million on this house! Do you have that much money?”

Xu Zi Xuan suddenly became dejected, saying: “I really don’t have any ...”

Wei Jun was the younger brother of this group of people. At this time, he also joined in and said,”Poverty has limited our imagination!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”brothers, stop sighing!” We’re going to do something big this time! In the future, everyone will be able to live in such a large courtyard!”

“Brother Zhao,” Xia ruofei teased,”why does it sound like you’re taking us to a robbery?”

Song Rui interjected,”how is robbing enough!” Each of them can own a courtyard house. It’s more like robbing a bank!”

“Hahaha ...”

After everyone had finished their tour, they gathered at the central courtyard.

The entire central courtyard was the living space of the master, and dinner was also served here.

As soon as Wu Qiang came back, he went into the kitchen and got busy. He had been living independently all these years and his cooking skills were not bad. Moreover, many of the things that song Rui and the others bought were cooked food. They could be eaten after heating them up slightly. It was not difficult for Wu Qiang.

Very quickly, the dishes were served.

As the host, Xia ruofei was the first to pick up the glass. The glass was filled with Drunken Eight Immortals white wine. Now that Drunken Eight Immortals had made a name for himself in the northern region, more and more people had fallen in love with the rising star of the white wine industry.

In fact, Drunken Eight Immortals did not spend much on advertising. The main issue was production capacity constraints, so it was useless no matter how big the advertisements were.

Basically, Drunken Eight Immortals only spread the news by word of mouth and some online recommendation posts, but it still took the whole country by storm.

This also very vividly interpreted the saying “the dense fragrance of wine is not afraid of the depths of the alley.”

Xia ruofei held his cup and smiled.””Thank you, brothers, and student Zhuo Yiyi. I’m overwhelmed by the fact that you’ve personally come to pick me up. Today, regardless of whether you’re driving or not, have a few drinks! Don’t leave tonight, there are plenty of rooms here, just pick one you like!”

“I seriously agree!” Hou Liang said,”let us experience the life of Lord Beile!”

“Hahaha!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this will be your home from now on! You can stay for as long as you want, no need to be polite with me! Come, come, come, let’s finish this cup first! For friendship, cheers!”

“For friendship!”

“F * ck!”

They were all young people, and their tempers were similar. In addition, they hadn’t seen each other for a while, so the atmosphere at dinner was naturally very lively.

Xia ruofei also observed that song Rui was very enthusiastic about Zhuo Yiyi. However, from their expressions and some subtle movements, song Rui should not have succeeded.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh in his heart. This kid was really stupid ...

After dinner, Zhuo Yiyi ranted about how she had not had a “bedroom meeting” with Song Wei in a long time. She wanted to reminisce about their university days and insisted on staying in the same room as Song Wei. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He could tell that Song Wei was not too willing, but it was not convenient for her to say it out loud. She was still hoping to find an opportunity to cultivate with Xia ruofei. If she were to stay in the same room as Zhuo Yiyi, even the idea of cultivating in secret would be dashed.

Xia ruofei gave Song Wei a look to calm her down. Then, he asked Wu Qiang to bring the two of them to choose a room.

Every room in the courtyard house was equipped with bedsheets, blankets, and toiletries, so they could be moved in directly.

Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, and the others sat under the grape trellis in the middle of the courtyard, making tea and chatting.

“Brother Zhao, tell me about the land!” Xia ruofei asked.

Zhao Yongjun nodded and smiled,””Before the new year, Xiao Rui, liangzi, and I inspected quite a few places. In the end, everyone agreed that there was a piece of land that was quite good ...”

He paused for a moment, took a sip of tea, and continued,””This town is located in the Pingchang District on the outskirts of Beijing. It’s surrounded by mountains and rivers, with pleasant scenery. Most importantly, it has rich hot spring resources, which is very suitable for us to build a special club ...”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly. The hot spring in little Tang town was famous for its popularity. There were many resorts and hotels there.

He thought for a moment and asked,”it sounds pretty good!” Big brother Zhao, let’s find time to go there tomorrow and have a look!”

“Even if you didn’t ask, I would have brought you there to check!” Zhao Yongjun laughed,”you’re the major shareholder!”

“Aren’t our shares about the same?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”but since I’m here, I’d better go and take a look. Otherwise, people will say that I’m not putting in effort ...”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui.

This guy had been indignant on the phone yesterday, but now that Xia ruofei was here, he had become a taciturn person. He was drinking tea by himself and did not respond to Xia ruofei’s words.

“By the way, brother Zhao, how big is this piece of land?” Xia ruofei asked.

“About 15 mu!” Zhao Yongjun replied. Moreover, the land next to it is also idle. If we manage it well in the future, we can buy it together for expansion. ”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but calculate in his heart. Then, he said,””So big? Will our budget be insufficient? The land price in the capital is not cheap!”
