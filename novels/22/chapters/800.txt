Chapter 801: I’m always too soft – hearted (2)

Translator: 549690339

The police were in awe! It was like a continuous River ...

“You’re the one who interpreted it wrongly, I didn’t mean it that way!” Qin Xiao Yu said,”just tell me if it’s okay or not?”

Xia ruofei shook his head.”I’m sorry, officer Qin. I’ve been taking care of black since he was born. We’ve already developed feelings for each other ...”

“I can pay a lot of money for it. Can you sell it to me?” Qin Xiao Yu said.

She really did Miss Black, and her tone had unknowingly carried a hint of coquettishness. This was something that she would not have dared to imagine normally.

Xia ruofei smiled and looked at Qin Xiaoyu,””Do you think I lack money?”

Qin Xiao Yu’s expression froze and her face was full of frustration. She knew about Xia ruofei’s situation and Xia ruofei’s net worth was at least tens of millions. Was she going to spend tens of millions to Buy Black?

Even if she was willing to spend so much money, she had to have it!

It was true that Qin Xiao Yu’s family was illustrious, but she was only a member of the family. Her pocket money of hundreds of thousands was nothing, but it was impossible for her to come up with tens of millions or hundreds of millions of funds.

Xia ruofei saw Qin Xiao Yu’s dejected look and felt a little sorry for her. He said,””Officer Qin, it’s not that I’m being stingy, but I’ve already developed feelings for little black. Besides, little black only recognizes me. Even if I give it to you, it won’t agree, let alone listen to you!”

Qin Xiao Yu’s face was filled with disbelief as she said,””Xiao hei still knows how to refuse? Wouldn’t that be a demon?”

Xia ruofei smiled and reached out to touch Blackie, who was lying on the passenger seat. He asked,””Blackie, tell the police sister. Are you willing to go home with her?”

Blackie shook its head without hesitation.

Qin Xiao Yu was dumbfounded as she watched from outside the car, was there really such a human – like dog?

However, the truth was right in front of her eyes and she had to believe it. It was unlikely that Xia ruofei had specially trained it to make xiaohei nod his head. Qin Xiao Yu had seen with her own eyes that xiaohei had attacked Huang Chunhua, which meant that it could complete the task according to Xia ruofei’s instructions.

On the way to the police station, it was also Xia ruofei’s word that made Blackie jump to the back seat. He kept an eye on Huang Chunhua the whole time.

This made Qin Xiao Yu even more envious.

However, she also knew that a forced melon was not sweet. In this situation, even if Xia ruofei was willing to give up his treasure, black would not leave with her!

“I see ...” Qin Xiao Yu lowered her head and said,”then I won’t bother you anymore, thank you for today!”

Xia ruofei saw Qin Xiaoyu’s depressed look and suddenly felt a little bad. He thought for a while and said,””Officer Qin, I can’t give you Xiao hei, but if you want a dog, I have a few here. I can give you one.”

Qin Xiao Yu suddenly raised her head and asked: “”You have other dogs? Are they all as smart as little black?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”It might be a little weaker than Blackie. But compared to normal dogs, it’s much better.”

“I want it!” Qin Xiao Yu said immediately.

Her voice was a little loud, and it immediately attracted the attention of a few policemen who were pretending to chat in the courtyard but were actually peeking at her.

Qin Xiao Yu was completely unaware and quickly said: “”Quickly take me to see him!”

Xia ruofei smiled and got out of the car. “”No need to go, they’re all here!”

With that, Xia ruofei went to the back of the pickup truck.

In order to prevent fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest from falling off the truck, Xia ruofei had covered the back of the truck so that no one could tell that there were many dogs inside.

It was only when Xia ruofei opened the back of the car that Qin Xiao Yu noticed fluffy one, fluffy two and the rest.

“So many dogs ...” Qin Xiao Yu’s eyes widened.

Xia ruofei whistled, and Da Mao and ER Mao immediately jumped down from the back of the truck and lined up in front of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you can choose!” Tell me which one you like!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Qin Xiao Yu looked at them one by one with some excitement and finally pointed to si Mao and said,””This one! This one is the one I like the most!”

Si Mao was a little female dog with pure white fur. Although her bloodline was far from the expensive pet dogs on the market, she had stayed in the spirit map space for nearly a year. Her fur was bright and she was fat and strong.

“Sure!” Xia ruofei agreed readily.

“Hairy # 4! Step forward!” Xia ruofei called out.

Si Mao immediately took two steps forward obediently. It was Qin Xiao Yu’s first time seeing such a human – like dog and she could not help but be so excited that her eyes lit up.

Xia ruofei patted si Mao’s head and said,””Si Mao, you will follow the police sister in the future! You have to listen to her and don’t be naughty, understand?”

Fluffy four barked twice and turned to look at Xia ruofei. It was not that it did not understand Xia ruofei’s words, but it was dissatisfied that Xia ruofei wanted to give it away to someone else. At the same time, it was unwilling to leave its friends.

Xia ruofei patted fluffy four and said,”You can live a good life if you follow the police! And he would have the opportunity to solve cases and catch thieves! Go! Say hello to the police sister!”

Si Mao whimpered and licked Xia ruofei’s feet gently. Then, it walked towards Qin Xiao Yu unwillingly and wagged its tail at her.

Qin Xiao Yu squatted down happily and touched si Mao’s head carefully, then raised her head and asked,””Does this mean it agreed?”
