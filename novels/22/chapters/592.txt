Chapter 593: Making a big profit (2)

Empiricism killed people! Ling Xiaotian’s pair of blood – Red Dragons were already extremely rare. How could six blood – Red Dragons of the same grade suddenly appear?

What made Xie Xun even more depressed was that the quality of these six fish was not inferior to that of Ling Xiaotian’s pair. In fact, they were slightly longer than Ling Xiaotian’s pair. Moreover, they seemed to have a hint of spirituality. Anyone with a good eye could tell the difference with one look.

After the bet was over, everyone’s attention was focused on the six blood – Red Dragons.

Ling Xiaotian cleared his throat and asked,””RUO Fei, are you going to sell these six fish?”

There was some reluctance in his eyes. After all, each of the six fish was quite eye – catching, and it was not appropriate for him to compete with his old friends on this occasion. As an old player who loved fish like a fool, this was worse than taking his life.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Of course! Uncle Ling, bosses, I’m going to sell these six fish in three pairs. That is to say, whoever wants to buy them must buy a pair at once. ”

Li Zongheng, Xu Desheng, and the others nodded. They were not short of money. If possible, they would like to buy all six of them. Xia ruofei’s suggestion of selling them in pairs was exactly what they wanted. It was a good sign to be in pairs!

Actually, Xia ruofei had come up with this idea on the spot.

Ling Xiaotian gathered five fish friends. He had six blood – Red Dragons. If he sold a single one, all five of them would definitely be able to buy it. However, if they were sold in pairs, it was destined that only three people would be able to buy it.

The biggest difference was the sense of competition. Obviously, this way of selling would raise the price, which was what Xia ruofei liked to see.

Ling Xiaotian understood Xia ruofei’s intention after pondering for a while. He could not help but glance at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile, thinking that this kid was quite cunning.

Li Zongheng and the others ‘attention was all on the red Arowana, so they did not care if they bought one or a pair.

Li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin’s eyes flickered as they looked at one of the boxes. However, they were both cunning big bosses, so they concealed it well.

......

Of course, Xia ruofei’s eyes were sharp. He had already sensed it.

However, Xia ruofei remained unmoved. He walked over, picked up one of the plastic boxes, and placed it in the middle of the courtyard. Then, he smiled and said,””Dear bosses, this is the first pair of blood red dragons for sale today. The rules are simple. Everyone just has to bid, and the one who offers the highest price will get it!”

Once again, li Zongheng glanced at the two plastic boxes beside Xia ruofei and laughed.””Then I’ll bid first! This pair of blood red Dragons is of the highest quality, be it in terms of hair color or body shape. I’ll pay five million!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Li Zongheng offered five million right off the bat. On average, each fish was worth two million and five hundred thousand. It had far exceeded the price that Xie Xun had offered for two million a fish. Xie Xun could not help but blush.

Xu Desheng said without much hesitation,””Boss li is being a little conservative today! I’ll pay 5.5 million!”

“Five million eight hundred and eighty thousand!” Yang Dahua also stared at the pair of Blood Dragons with desire and stated his price.

Guo Qinglin, who looked like a skinny old man, looked at it but did not bid in the end. He laughed and said,””This is only the first pair and everyone is already fighting so fiercely. I’ll wait for the next pair ...”

Yang Dahua grinned and said,”brothers, why don’t you just give in to me?” I really like this pair of blood red Dragons. There are still two more pairs after this, so you guys can continue to compete!”

Although yang Dahua did not say it explicitly, his intention was obvious. He was urging everyone to fight for it and Xia ruofei had the upper hand in the end. Although they were not short of money, there was no need to be a spendthrift.

“Since President yang has spoken, I have to give him some face!” Li Zongheng said after a moment of silence.

After he finished speaking, he closed his mouth, obviously not prepared to bid anymore.

Xu Desheng had been thinking and did not make a clear statement.

At this moment, Xie Xun, who had been silent all this while, suddenly said to Xia ruofei,”Little brother, that ... Hehe ... Can I make a bid?”

Xie Xun had a little conflict with Xia ruofei just now and even lost two million, but the quality of these six Red Arowana was too good. He had been an ornamental fish for so many years and had never seen such near – perfect blood Arowana. So, he could still keep a straight face at first, but when he saw yang Dahua and the others bidding, his heart felt like it was being scratched by a cat. It was hard to resist.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Of course you can. I’m selling these Blood Dragons. As long as director Xie offers the highest price, I’ll sell them to you.”

Upon hearing this, Ling Xiaotian could not help but open his mouth. Seeing this, Xia ruofei immediately stopped him from saying anything.”Uncle Ling, you don’t have to participate ...”

When Xie Xun heard this, his eyes widened and he said,””Old Ling, what are you doing here? The pair of blood red Dragons Xiao Xia found for you are already good enough! You can’t possibly take all the benefits, can you?”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled awkwardly and waved his hand,””Alright, alright, alright, you guys fight! Can’t I just watch from the side?”

“That’s more like it ...” Xie Xun mumbled.

Yang Dahua, who was standing beside him, asked impatiently,””Third Xie, are you going to bid or not? If you don’t bid, this pair of Blood Dragons is mine!”
