Chapter 1905 Without anyone knowing (2)

However, he was able to lock onto the exit of Building No. 3. Nothing could escape his eyes.

Soon, Xu Yougang saw Liu haojun’s car park in an empty parking space in front of Building No. 3 from a distance. Then, Liu haojun’s driver, old Zhou, got out of the car, stood next to the car, and smoked a cigarette. Then, he got back into the car.

Xu Yougang patiently hid in the bushes. Time passed by, and the sky gradually brightened.

On the road of the neighborhood, there were more and more old men and women doing their morning exercises, but no one would notice that there was a living person hiding in the bushes behind the flower garden.

At around 8:30, Xu You saw Liu haojun’s driver start the car and drive directly to the entrance of the unit in Building No. 3.

His spirits were lifted, and he said through the walkie – talkie,””Liangzi, Wang Chong, Liu haojun’s car should be out soon. Keep your spirits up!”

“Yes!”

“Understood!”

After a while, Xu Yougang saw Lao Zhou get out of the car quickly and open the back door. Then, Liu haojun walked out of the unit door while yawning and sat in the car. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Old Zhou closed the car door, walked quickly to the front, and sat in the driver’s seat. Then, he slowly started the car.

Xu Yougang observed for a while and said,””He’s out! It looks like we’re going from the North exit. Liang, get ready!”

“Understood!” Zeng Liang said in a relaxed manner.

A few minutes after Liu haojun’s car left, Xu Yougang saw Fang Chenchen’s figure. She walked out of Building 3 in a hurry and went straight to her red beetle car.

Fang Chenchen was probably rushing back to work at the television station, and she happened to be walking through the main entrance of the estate. Xu Yougang had Wang Chong get ready in advance, so he followed her.

After Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen left, Xu Yougang’s spirits were finally lifted. It was time to show off his skills!

He found an opportunity when there was no one around to come out of the bushes, tidied his clothes a little, and then walked briskly to the third building.

He had already obtained the access code yesterday, so he was able to enter the building smoothly.

Since he didn’t have an elevator card, Xu Yougang didn’t plan to take the elevator. He dashed into the stairwell and quickly climbed up.

19 stories wasn’t too high, but if one were to climb the stairs, it definitely wouldn’t be considered low.

Xu Yougang’s physical strength was still quite good. Ten minutes later, he was already on the 19th floor. He was only a little out of breath.

He rested for a while in the stairwell. When his breath evened out, he put on a mask, pulled up the hat of his tracksuit, and put on a rubber headgear. Then, he pushed open the door of the stairwell and walked out.

When they arrived at the door of Room 1902, Xu Yougang breathed a sigh of relief. He was glad that Liu haojun did not install a camera at the door.

Nowadays, internet cameras were very common. Many people installed these cameras at home and at their doors. Not only could they record videos on memory cards, but they could also be saved on the cloud. Once they detected a moving object, they would immediately send an alarm to the owner’s phone.

However, Liu haojun did not install any surveillance cameras, mainly because he did not live in the West Lake Mansion every day. Besides, the security here had always been very good. Of course, more importantly, the surveillance cameras were all connected to the internet. Once a hacker cracked it, it would be equivalent to a live broadcast on the internet. Liu haojun naturally did not want to be watched by countless netizens while he was having sex with Fang Chenchen in the living room.

This also saved Xu Yougang a lot of trouble. The interference equipment he had prepared in advance was not used.

The door of Room 1902 had a fingerprint lock, which Xu Yougang had noticed yesterday. He deliberately delayed the closing of the elevator door for a while, and he could clearly hear the sound of the fingerprint lock unlocking.

The lock looked advanced, but it was not difficult for Xu Yougang at all.

He squatted down and found a keyhole under the control panel of the fingerprint lock. He took out a wire from his backpack, stuffed it into the keyhole, and turned it a few times. Soon, he found the pattern. As he gently pushed, he heard a click from the lock. Then he pressed the door handle, and the anti – Theft door opened.

In fact, there was an even simpler way. He could just place a coil on the control panel of the fingerprint lock and power it up. Most of the fingerprint locks would crash and then reset automatically. After restarting, any fingerprint puppet could open the door.

For a period of time, lock – picking devices were sold on the internet, and Xu Yougang had bought similar equipment, which was much more advanced than the ones sold on Taobao.

However, Xu Yougang did not take it out to use because once he used it, the fingerprint data that was previously recorded would disappear. Then, when Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen returned, they would soon realize that something was wrong.

Therefore, Xu Yougang chose the most traditional way of unlocking the door, which was not difficult for him.

Xu Yougang pushed the door open a crack. He listened carefully to make sure that there was no one in the room before he quickly went in.

Even though he knew where Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen were meeting, and the possibility of a third person appearing was close to zero, Xu Yougang was still very careful. He checked all the houses carefully, then went to lock the security door. Once there was someone in the house, opening the door that was left unlocked was naturally faster than opening the door that was locked. This way, Xu Yougang could leave faster.
