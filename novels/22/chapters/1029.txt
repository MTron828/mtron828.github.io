Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei only found out that Lin Qiao had not come back for dinner when they arrived at the restaurant downstairs.

She heard from Hu ‘Zi’s mother that this girl had to work overtime tonight to design, so she had a meal at the company’s cafeteria.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother brought out the dishes and nagged,””This child ... She’s about to go to school, why is she still thinking about work all day ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel guilty. He knew that Lin Qiao must have worked overtime for the vacuum – packed dried abalone design, and it was all because of him!

Xia ruofei laughed dryly,”godmother, I’ll tell her off later!” Also, I’ll tell her team leader not to give her too much work, and it’s best to slowly hand it over. It’s time for her to get ready for university. ”

Hu ‘er’s mother agreed,”Yes, she can listen to what you say, unlike me, who always finds it naggy ... Ruofei! When Qiao’ er comes back, you have to tell her!”

“Woof! Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

After the two of them finished their meal, Xia ruofei helped his godmother clear the dishes as usual.

After she went for a walk on the farm as usual, Xia ruofei returned to his room upstairs and continued to dive into the huge amount of data.

As the research process for the mass production of the heart – nourishing soup was confidential, Xia ruofei had to make the adjustments on his computer.

Therefore, he was quite familiar with this production line. He knew that the production line could automatically complete the functions such as soup residue separation, constant temperature control, automatic stirring, and so on. Therefore, there were no detours in the design steps.

The reason why he spent so much time was to think about automation as much as possible and reduce the number of human intervention links. In addition, he wanted to optimize the links as much as possible. After all, the more steps there were, the greater the possibility of mistakes. Moreover, the transmission link would also be damaged. Whether it was in terms of cost or efficiency, the simpler the steps, the better.

Xia ruofei was busy in front of the computer. The waste paper in the bin that he had crumpled into a ball was getting more and more. Those were the steps he had drawn.

Finally, it was past eleveno’ clock at night. Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief and leaned back in his chair. He took out a cigarette and lit it up. His tired face could not hide his excitement.

It was finally completed!

After a night’s hard work, Xia ruofei had derived the steps and parameters of mass production on the theoretical level. Although it was not perfect, it had reached the limit of his ability. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei looked at the steps that he had just drawn on the computer screen. He went through it twice in his mind and confirmed that he could no longer optimize it. Then, he clicked the print button and printed out the steps and the document that recorded the key data and parameters.

Then, Xia ruofei deleted all the contents of the document and replaced it with a large amount of meaningless mojibake. He saved it and closed it.

This way, the content he had written before was completely covered.

Then, Xia ruofei changed the file’s extension name to DLI and the file name to a similar system – processed file name. Then, he used the file shredding tool to completely delete the file.

He did the same to the diagram.

After all, this computer was connected to the internet. It might not be a problem now, but there was no guarantee that after the Jade skin cream became famous, it would be targeted by people with ulterior motives.

Xia ruofei had developed a habit of being cautious since he was in the Army. He was even more careful after he obtained the spirit map.

After doing this, even if the computer was hacked and the other party could recover the shattered files on the hard disk, it would be difficult to find the file. Even if they found the file, it was impossible to recover the previous data because Xia ruofei had covered it with garbled codes.

This minimized the possibility of a leak.

Of course, there were many ways to hack into secrets, including many imported printers and shredder that were secretly installed with scanning and launching components. There were also many eavesdropping and surveillance devices that were becoming smaller.

However, Xia ruofei felt that paradise Corporation should not be able to enjoy such treatment at the moment. Moreover, he had already checked the printer that he had bought, and the possibility of it being tampered with was extremely low.

Xia ruofei kept the printed document in the spirit map space, took a shower, and went to bed.

The next morning, after Xia ruofei had his breakfast, he sent Feng Jing the contact information of Dong Jiajun from the Hengfeng auction house.

Then, he gave Feng Jing a call and briefly explained Dong Jiajun’s situation. He told her that Hengfeng group had already coordinated with him and that she could contact manager Dong directly.

Then, Xia ruofei found the phone number of Xue Jinshan, the director of the pharmaceutical factory, and dialed it.

“Hello, President Xia!” Xue Jinshan respectfully greeted.

“Kanayama, you must be exhausted,” Xia ruofei laughed.

Xue Jinshan chuckled and said,”it’s good, it’s good. General manager Xia, I’m full of energy for this job!” It was a full sense of accomplishment! So what if it’s hard and tiring?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”not bad, not bad!” I’ve already told director Feng that the company will be recruiting a new batch of people soon. The pharmaceutical factory will probably start production soon, so I’ll ask her to add some manpower to you. If you have any urgent needs for manpower, quickly make a plan and report it to the company!”

“That’s great!” Xue Jinshan was very excited to hear this.”Thank you for your concern! We’re really short of people here!”
