Translator: 549690339

The next day, the two of them only woke up late in the morning.

It was also the first time Xia ruofei did not wake up to cultivate in the morning. It was not because he was too tired from last night’s crazy training, but because he was worried that he would wake Ling Qingxue up.

Ling Qingxue, who had been tormented like a pool of mud last night, was full of energy after a night’s sleep. With Xia ruofei’s nourishment, she seemed to be in a much better mood.

After the two of them had breakfast downstairs, Xia ruofei was about to drive Ling Qingxue back to the company when he received a call from Ling Xiaotian.

Last night, he was still making love to his daughter. After spending most of the night together, Xia ruofei could not help but feel a little guilty when he saw Ling Xiaotian’s call.

Ling Qingxue leaned over to take a look, then looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””Why aren’t you picking it up?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and quickly pressed the answer button.

As soon as the call connected, Ling Xiaotian asked impatiently,””RUO Fei, where are you?”

Xia ruofei’s expression froze when he heard that.”Old Tarzan, aren’t you asking the obvious?” You’ve clearly created an opportunity for us yesterday, so where else can I be?

“Uncle Ling, I ...”

Ling Xiaotian saw that Xia ruofei was hesitating and immediately asked,””You’re with Qingxue, right?”

“Ah ... Yes ...” Xia ruofei felt even more embarrassed.

He thought to himself, wasn’t uncle Ling very supportive of our relationship? Why does his tone sound like he’s going to condemn me? He couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.

On the other end of the phone, Ling Xiaotian could not help but laugh and said,””You child, what’s there to be embarrassed about? It’s just nice that you two are together. Now, let’s have a meal at Ling Ji’s private kitchen! Let’s come over together!”

“Oh ... Good, good, good!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

His heart relaxed, and he didn’t even dare to ask why Ling Xiaotian was looking for him. He hurriedly replied.

After hanging up the phone, Ling Qingxue finally could not help but burst out laughing. She glanced at Xia ruofei coquettishly and said,””A guilty conscience ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s shoulder.””Let’s go! Summon of Mount Tai! Let’s go to Ling Ji’s private kitchen together. ”

Ling Qingxue also felt a little strange and asked,””Why is he in such a hurry to find us?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”how would I know?” From his tone, he seems to be in a hurry. Let’s go!”

“Let’s go!” Ling Qingxue said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue drove to the Ling’s private kitchen. As soon as they met, Ling Xiaotian said,””RUO Fei, Qingxue, let’s go! Come with me to the kitchen ...”

“Dad, what’s the matter?” Ling Qingxue could not help but ask.

“You’ll know when you get there!”Ling Xiaotian chuckled.

With that, Ling Xiaotian walked straight ahead. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue exchanged a look and quickly followed.

When the three of them arrived at the kitchen, a middle – aged man wearing a white chef’s hat immediately came out to welcome them. This middle – aged chef did not look much younger than Ling Xiaotian, but he greeted him with great respect,””Master!”

Then, he nodded at Ling Qingxue and greeted her,””Junior Sister is here too!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and nodded,”senior brother Wu, what are you and my dad doing?” He called us over in a hurry early in the morning ...”

This senior brother Wu looked at Ling Xiaotian, and Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,””Ruofei, let me introduce you. This is my first disciple, Wu sihua. Sihua, this is Qingxue’s boyfriend, Xia ruofei!”

“Hello, senior brother Wu!” Xia ruofei quickly greeted him.

“Hello, RUO Fei!” Wu sihua quickly responded with a smile.

“How’s it going?”Ling Xiaotian continued to ask.

“Master,” Wu sihua quickly said,”it should be ready. Why don’t you go and take a look?”

“Hahaha! The expert was here! RUO Fei, go take a look!” Ling Xiaotian laughed.

“Uncle Ling, what’s the situation?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

Ling Xiaotian smiled and did not say a word. He led them into the kitchen and went straight to a charcoal stove. Inside the charcoal stove was charcoal with a small fire. On top of it was a small wine jar, and the jar’s mouth was sealed with layers of lotus leaves.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and said,””Buddha Jumps Over the Wall? This ... How did you guys manage to process the ingredients so quickly?”

Ling Xiaotian laughed proudly and said,””Our Ling Ji private kitchen also has ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ on the menu, so before opening, some of the more time – consuming ingredients were already prepared in advance. Sihua and I were busy the entire night and re – prepared it according to your recipe. Then, we placed it on the charcoal stove and slowly stewed it overnight!”

“It’s mainly because the herbs aren’t easy to find,” Wu sihua said.”Many Chinese medicine shops have closed. Master personally drove all the way to Sanshan city to buy the herbs he needed ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”uncle Ling, to be honest, it was my first time making ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ yesterday. So ... All of you participated in the production of the whole process. I think you should control the heat yourself!”

Ling Xiaotian nodded and looked at his watch,””It’s about time. Sihua, pick it up!”

“Yes, master!” Wu sihua quickly put on a pair of mittens and took the small wine jar off the charcoal stove.

Ling Xiaotian looked at it with some excitement, then said,””Open it!”

Wu sihua immediately Cut the Rope carefully and opened the sealed lotus leaves layer by layer. Suddenly, a strong and unique fragrance wafted out. Wu sihua, who had come into contact with the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall for the first time, couldn’t help but sniffle.

Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue were doing the same thing. Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,””This fragrance is similar to the one from yesterday!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”We’ll know if it’s a success or not after we try it.”

“That makes sense!” Ling Xiaotian said. Then, he immediately asked Wu sihua to bring the utensils, spoons, and spoons.

Wu sihua made a few bowls of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. Ling Xiaotian immediately took a bowl and blew on it gently for a while. When the soup cooled down a little, he immediately scooped up a spoonful of soup and put it into his mouth. Then, he quickly picked up a piece of tendon and put it in his mouth to chew quickly.

The joy on Ling Xiaotian’s face gradually spread. As he ate, he mumbled,””You guys should try it too!”

Xia ruofei and the other two immediately picked up their bowls. Although they had just had breakfast, Xia ruofei was still attracted by the aroma.

Wu sihua, who was next to him, had been making ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ for more than ten to twenty years, but this was the first time she had smelled such a strong fragrance. She couldn’t wait to try it.

“Congratulations! Uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei put down his bowl and said with a smile,”this ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ is a great success!”

“It tastes the same as last night ‘s!” Ling Qingxue also said happily.

Wu sihua was still shocked by the deliciousness of the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, and her face was filled with disbelief.

Ling Xiaotian laughed happily and said,”that’s great!” That’s great! Qingxue, sihua, immediately adjust the promotional page of Ling Ji’s private kitchen and make this ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ our signature dish. You must write down the secret recipe, the authentic ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, and so on! The company’s official website must also focus on promoting it!”

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue and Wu sihua immediately responded.

Ling Xiaotian, Ling Qingxue, and Wu sihua began to discuss the details of promoting the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. Hence, Xia ruofei said goodbye to Jian Jia with a smile. Although he was Jian Jia’s son – in – Law – to – be, he did not have much experience in running a restaurant business. He would not be of much help even if he stayed.

The recipe of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was the best gift.

Ling Xiaotian sincerely expressed his gratitude to Xia ruofei and personally sent Xia ruofei off with Ling Qingxue.

After bidding farewell to Ling Xiaotian and the other two, Xia ruofei started the car and returned to Taoyuan farm.

Xia ruofei had been away from Huaxia for more than 20 days and had accumulated a lot of work.

It was almost time to harvest the Dendrobium candidly. The batch of Drunken Eight Immortals wine was about to be delivered and a new batch of wine was about to be brought in. Jiang Hua had also mentioned the Chinese perch cultivation workshop many times. It was time for Xia ruofei to find time to prepare a batch of Chinese perch. Otherwise, this dedicated subordinate of his would ‘rebel’.

It was also time to add some spirit Heart Flower petal solution to the farm’s reservoir and the Pomfret cultivation workshop’s water circulation pool.

Xia ruofei had to do all this by himself and no one else could.

As for the pharmaceutical factory, although Xue Jinshan had been keeping an eye on it, Xia ruofei had always been concerned about this project. As the boss, he had to take some time to understand the situation. This also showed that he attached great importance to it!

Besides, Xia ruofei still had a few things to do.

For example, Xia ruofei had already prepared the Phoebe zhennan wood that he had promised Mr. Tang He in the medium. It was almost time to contact him.

This was a huge sum of money and could maintain a good relationship with a giant Financial Group like shengbang group. Naturally, Xia ruofei would pay great attention to it.

Also, after another 20 days or so in the outside world, the quality of the reticulated abalone that he had experimented with cultivating in the spirit map space’s primal realm had basically reached the standard of a one – headed abalone.

Xia ruofei had decided to make dried abalones and sell them in the next few days. Although the Kasaya was just an experimental product, it still took a lot of Xia Qing’s energy. It was very troublesome to change the water between the two spaces, not to mention that there were people watching over them, so naturally, they couldn’t waste them.

Xia ruofei briefly sorted out the work that he had to complete in the near future and felt a headache.

After he was discharged from the Army, he became a little lazy and wished that everything could be handed over to his subordinates to do, while he himself was a hands – off manager.

However, the spirit map space was his top secret, and there were always many things that he had to do personally.

In the next few days, Xia ruofei instructed Xia Qing to turn all the abalones that he had been cultivating in the Archean realm into dried abalones.

Soon, Xia Qing followed Xia ruofei’s instructions and made all the 30 abalones into dried abalones.

These dried abalones were generally larger than the size of an adult’s palm. After precise weighing, all 25 of them were more than the standard of a one – Head abalone, except for five slightly smaller ones that weighed more than 590 grams, which were a little less than 604.79 grams, which was one Sima Jin.

Most of the one – Head abalones weighed about 610 to 620 grams, and there were 20 abalones in this range.

The remaining five all weighed more than 630 grams, and the heaviest one even reached about 650 grams. It was definitely a Super One – headed abalone.

After Xia ruofei received Xia Qing’s divine sense voice transmission, he immediately entered the space to personally check on this batch of abalones. He was quite excited.

This kind of top – grade abalone was hard to come by. Xia ruofei knew that he could not sell it through ordinary sales channels.

The best way was naturally to auction it.

Not only could he maximize his own benefits, but it could also easily create a sensational effect and further enhance the influence of the Paradise brand.

As for the location of the auction, Xia ruofei had already decided in his heart. It would be Hong Kong.

Because Hong Kong was a distribution center for high – Quality abalones, and Hong Kong people had a long history of eating abalones, high – Quality abalones were much more popular in Hong Kong people than in China.

In Hong Kong, there was a saying that “it’s hard to buy a two – headed abalone with a thousand pieces of gold.” This showed how much they loved the best abalones.

As for one – Head abalones, they were basically extinct on the market and couldn’t be bought even if you had money.

Many Hong Kong people even treated the top – Quality abalone as a family heirloom.

Xia ruofei believed that if he took out more than 20 one – headed abalones at once, it would definitely cause a sensation in Hong Kong.

Of course, there was another important reason why he chose Hong Kong. MA Xiong’s Hengfeng group was based in Hong Kong. MA Xiong had a great influence in Hong Kong’s upper – Class society. With his help, Xia ruofei believed that the auction would go smoothly.

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei left the realm and called MA Xiong, who was in Hong Kong.
