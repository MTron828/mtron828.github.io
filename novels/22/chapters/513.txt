Chapter 514: Australia, here I come (2)

Following that, Xia ruofei briefly explained how he had gone to the Public Security Bureau to receive the award. He did not tell Lei Hu much about what had happened. He only told Lei Hu that he would attend the award ceremony as a friend and that he would not accept any interviews.

This was a small matter to Lei Hu. He was also a veteran who had been in battle for a long time. Naturally, he did not have any stage fright.

Xia ruofei also told Lei Hu to put on a simple disguise before attending the event and try not to appear in front of the media with his original appearance. Disguise and investigation were compulsory courses for Special Forces soldiers, so naturally, it was not a problem for Lei Hu.

Finally, Xia ruofei gave Qin Xiaoyu’s phone number to Lei Hu and said,””Hu, this is the number of police officer Qin from the city Police station. Contact her later and she’ll tell you the details of the event. Remember, other than what I said, reject all other unreasonable requests!”

“Understood!” Lei Hu grinned. Brother Xia, I’m just going to be a mascot and cooperate with the leaders to give out awards and take photos for the reporters! I understand ...”

“Your understanding is correct!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”Oh right, I’ll send you my personal account number later. You can just ask the Public Security Bureau to transfer the after – Tax bonus to my account.”

“Alright! Don’t worry! If I can’t even complete such a simple task, I’ll be too ashamed to work in the company!” Lei Hu said with a sneer.

Xia ruofei patted Lei Hu’s shoulder and said,”Then I’ll have to trouble you! Go do your work!”

After Xia ruofei was done with the arrangements, he did not return to the office. Instead, he returned to the villa.

There were only two difficult core runes left. Xia ruofei was ready to practice harder and try to master them as soon as possible.

After returning to the villa, Xia ruofei closed the doors and windows, took out the low – Quality white jade, picked up the carving knife, and began to practice without any distractions.

By evening, Xia ruofei was able to inscribe the second last independent rune. However, his success rate was not high. He was still a little away from mastering it. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He packed his things and prepared to go to the staff cafeteria for dinner.

After putting away the White jade slip and the carving knife, he reached out and picked up his phone.

In order to avoid interference, Xia ruofei had muted his phone and even turned off its vibration.

He picked up his phone and saw that there were two missed calls.

The two calls were from Tang He from the United States

Hence, Xia ruofei called back on his phone as he walked out.

“Little Xia!” Elder Tang’s hearty voice could be heard from the phone.

Xia ruofei said apologetically,””I’m really sorry, old Mr. Tang. I muted my phone just now and didn’t pick up your call. ”

“It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter!” Tang He chuckled and said,”I’m not looking for you for anything urgent.”

“Oh? Then you’re looking for me because ...”

“Xiao Xia, I just wanted to ask you if you can find some time to come over in the next few days?” Tang He asked gently,”if you’re free, I’m going to invite you to Australia to inspect the farm that we’re working on together!”

Xia ruofei had also guessed that Tang He was looking for him about the farm.

Although the money invested in the farm was nothing to Tang He, it was bought with money after all. It couldn’t be left barren forever, right? Since the farm was going to start growing crops, he could not do without his “technical support.”

Xia ruofei was surprised that Tang He only came to find him after so long. He guessed that Tang He was busy with work in the United States and did not have time to come. Then, he sent his subordinate to accompany him to Australia, which seemed to be not important enough, so he had been delaying it.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei said without hesitation,””I’m fine with it, Mr. Tang. I’ll take your time!”

“That’s great!”Tang He said happily. Little Xia, let’s set it for three days later! I’ll get Zhou Qing to send someone to the farm to look for you and help you settle some of the procedures for going abroad. Three days should be enough!”

Zhou Qing was the president of shengbang group in the Greater China region. When the Peach Blossom Farm building was completed, he was entrusted by Tang He to bring a brand new Mercedes – Benz as a congratulatory gift.

If Xia ruofei did not use his connections and went through the normal procedures to apply for a passport and visa, three days would not be enough.

However, with shengbang group’s global influence, it would not be a problem to send an invitation under the name of Hunter Valley’s Paradise Farm to complete all the procedures for Xia ruofei within three days.

Xia ruofei didn’t decline. He was most afraid of running these cumbersome procedures. With Tang He’s people running the errands for him, he was naturally more than happy.

“Alright, I’ll have to trouble you then.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“It’s just a small matter!” Tang He laughed and said,”Xia, it’s a deal. I’ll fly to China in three days and you’ll fly to Australia with me on a private plane!”

Xia ruofei was stunned. The distance between United States and Australia was similar to the distance between China and Huaxia. However, one was in the Southern Hemisphere while the other was in the Northern Hemisphere. If Tang He went to Huaxia first and then went to Australia together, it would be a huge detour.

‘This old man is too polite to me ...’ Xia ruofei thought to himself.

“Old Mr. Tang, I don’t think there’s a need to go through so much trouble.” Xia ruofei declined.”You can fly directly to Australia. It’s also very convenient for me to take a civilian flight here.”
