Li Yifu took the lead and said with a trembling voice,”martial granduncle!” If I may be so bold as to ask ... You ... Have you broken through?”

Although Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and Zheng Yongshou did not say anything, their eyes were also filled with anticipation. The four of them looked at Xia ruofei eagerly.

Without a doubt, Xia ruofei was the backbone of the team and the core of the team. Xia ruofei’s breakthrough in cultivation was something worth celebrating for everyone.

Not to mention that there was Zheng Yongshou who was absolutely loyal to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had a gentle smile on his face. He nodded and said, “You’re quite lucky! I’ve already broken through to the early jiedan stage, and I absorbed a lot of spiritual Qi when I was consolidating my cultivation. I hope I didn’t scare everyone?”

As soon as Xia ruofei returned to the outside world, he could feel that the concentration of spiritual Qi on the Peach Blossom Island had dropped drastically. He thought for a while and guessed the reason.

This was actually good. If he had only absorbed the spiritual energy within the spirit map space, there would not have been any fluctuations in the spiritual energy outside, and he had already broken through to the early jiedan stage. That was obviously a bit too strange.

Now that the concentration of spiritual Qi in the outside world had dropped so much, it meant that the breakthrough just now had caused a lot of movement on the island. Everything made sense.

Although these people in front of him were worthy of absolute trust, the spirit map space was ultimately Xia ruofei’s core secret. Unless it was absolutely necessary, he would never reveal it to a second person.

Li Yifu said,”we’ve already guessed that it’s senior granduncle who’s breaking through a major realm. Therefore, the more spiritual Qi He absorbs, the more excited we are. This means that senior granduncle’s strength will definitely be greatly improved after this breakthrough!”

Zheng Yongshou also said with a happy expression,””Mr. Xia! I remember that after my master turned all his Zhen Qi into Yuan Qi, he went into seclusion for more than a year before he finally broke through to the early stage of the Golden core. I didn’t expect you to complete it in just ten minutes. This is simply a miracle!”

Xia ruofei was slightly stunned.”You can take your time to build the vital Qi vortex?” he asked.

“Yuan Qi vortex?” Zheng Yongshou was a little puzzled.

Xia ruofei then realized that Qi refinement cultivators like him probably didn’t know much about the Golden core stage. They didn’t even know what a Yuan Qi Whirlpool was. Hence, he explained,””Even if I break through to the early Aurous core stage, can the process of breaking through be dragged on for more than a year? Shouldn’t you finish it in one go?”

Obviously, Zheng Yongshou only knew that Luo Qingfeng had broken through to the early – Stage golden elixir realm after a year of seclusion. He did not know the details of the process, let alone the matter of cultivators constructing the vital Qi vortex. So, he was also confused and said with a confused expression,””Mr. Xia, I’m not too sure about this ... Before my master went into seclusion, he said that he had successfully transformed all the true Qi in his body into Origin Energy. This time, he was going into seclusion and would only come out after he broke through to the early golden core stage. After that, he spent more than a year in closed – door cultivation ...”

Xia ruofei nodded. It seemed that Zheng Yongshou didn’t know much either. He also felt that other cultivators wouldn’t be able to construct the vital Qi vortex like him. Otherwise, with the current cultivation environment on earth, no one would be able to construct it successfully. However, what he didn’t understand was that before the yuan Qi vortex was completed, the cultivator should find it hard to endure the extreme hunger in his dantian and the feeling of constantly absorbing any trace of Yuan Qi in his body. Even if he could endure it, wouldn’t he be sucked dry after a long time?

Anyway, the second level of the “great Dao Arts” did not mention that the formation of the vital Qi vortex could be carried out step by step. Hence, Xia ruofei felt that his method should be more reliable. However, it might not be suitable for the current cultivation environment on earth.

Thinking of this, he muttered to himself for a moment, and then said to Zheng Yongshou,””Yongshou, contact your master. If he doesn’t have many things to do, ask him to come here. I have something to ask him.”

It was naturally better to ask Luo Qingfeng directly about the Golden core stage. Furthermore, before Luo Qingfeng left last time, he had mentioned that there would be an auction in the cultivation world in the near future, and there were rumors that storage rings might appear. Xia ruofei calculated that the time should be close, so he decided to summon Luo Qingfeng over.

“Alright, I’ll contact Master immediately!” Zheng Yongshou said respectfully.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Then, he turned to look at Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

The two of them were naturally happy that Xia ruofei had broken through to the early golden elixir realm. However, compared to the breakthrough in his cultivation, they were more happy that Xia ruofei had safely overcome the difficulty of breaking through to the next realm. If anything were to happen during the breakthrough process, they could not believe how they would handle it.

In reality, whether it was Song Wei or Ling Qingxue, they would rather Xia ruofei be mediocre than see him in any danger.

However, both of them knew that Xia ruofei was not destined to be mediocre. They could not drag Xia ruofei down, so they could only keep their worries to themselves.

When Xia ruofei looked over, the two of them smiled sweetly and said in unison,””Congratulations on your breakthrough!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s just a matter of time. As long as you continue to cultivate, you’re not far from the Golden core stage.” Both you and Yongshou, stay on the Peach Blossom Island and cultivate. You’ll know in the future that the Golden core stage is nothing ...”

Li Yifu and Zheng Yongshou both revealed excited expressions and nodded heavily.

Xia ruofei continued,”let’s not just stand here. Let’s go in and talk ... Adopted husband, find a bigger room and prepare some food and wine. We have to celebrate today!”

“Martial granduncle, I’m ready!” Li Yifu smiled and said,”it’s in the reception room on the third floor. It’s spacious there!”

“Oh, really? What were they waiting for? Let’s go!” Xia ruofei laughed.

The reception room on the third floor of the Yanhuang building was originally designed to receive important guests as a place for official meetings. It was very spacious, but the main decoration was a circle of leather sofas with high comfort.

Li Yifu knew that Xia ruofei was going back to Paradise Island, so he set up a long table in the middle of the reception room with Zheng Yongshou in advance. They also prepared a lot of delicious food and fine wine. Currently, there were no other staff members available on Paradise Island, so they had to do everything themselves.

However, Xia ruofei had gone straight to the core of the formation to cultivate after getting off the plane, so the small welcome party was not put to use. Now, it was time to change it to a celebration party.

Xia ruofei and the others came to the reception room on the third floor. Although Zheng Yongshou’s cultivation was much higher than Li Yifu ‘s, he knew that his status was definitely not as high as Li Yifu’ s, so he consciously took on the role of a waiter.

Soon, he brought out the cold dishes that he had prepared and was busy pouring wine for everyone. Just as he was about to heat up the dishes, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Yongshou, don’t be busy. Let’s have a drink first ...”

When Zheng Yongshou heard this, he was so excited that he almost burst into tears. He quickly said,””Thank you, m – Mr. Xia!”

As Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were present, Zheng Yongshou had to address Xia ruofei as “Mr. Xia”. He was so excited that he almost spilled the beans.

Xia ruofei didn’t blame him. He just smiled gently and said,””Pour the wine yourself!”

“Yes!” Zheng Yongshou quickly poured wine into his own glass.

Xia ruofei raised his cup and said,”today, I have finally broken through to the Golden core stage. This is a day worth celebrating. Let’s all have a toast!” In addition, everything on Paradise Island will gradually get on the right track. Many ordinary people will come to the island to take on some basic work, including our own guards, so there are still many follow – up matters. I’ll have to trouble foster husband and Yongshou. ”

“Senior granduncle, you’re being too serious. This is what a disciple should do.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Mr. Xia, it’s my honor to be of service to you!”

Li Yifu and Zheng Yongshou both said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”good!” In the future, everyone can cultivate here. Building the Peach Blossom Island is like building your own home. I won’t be polite with everyone. Cheers!”
