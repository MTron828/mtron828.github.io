Translator: 549690339

The next morning.

As they had promised Tang Yitian’s family that they would tour the capital, Xia ruofei and Feng Rao woke up very early. Xia ruofei even got up to cultivate for a while at Seveno’ clock. After washing up, he called Feng Rao to have breakfast at the hotel buffet restaurant.

After breakfast, the two of them went back to their rooms to clean up. Soon, Xia ruofei received a call from Tang Yitian.

Knowing that they had arrived at the hotel, Xia ruofei immediately gave Feng Jing a call. Then, the two of them took the elevator down.

They walked out of the elevator and arrived at the hotel lobby. Xia ruofei saw Tang Yitian’s family sitting on the guest sofa at the side of the lobby. Tang Haoran was also sitting beside his parents obediently.

On the sofa opposite Tang Yitian and Jennifer, there was a tall foreign girl who was talking to Jennifer in a low voice. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This Western girl was wearing a pair of black sunglasses that almost covered half of her face. Her soft golden hair was naturally let down, and her figure was curvaceous. Her pair of straight and super long legs attracted the attention of many men passing by the lobby.

Tang Yitian also saw Xia ruofei and Feng Rao very quickly. He smiled and waved at them.

“Big brother Tang! Sister – in – Law! Good Morning!” Xia ruofei came to them and greeted them with a smile.

“Good Morning!” “Have you had breakfast?” Tang Yitian asked with a smile.

“I just finished eating!” Xia ruofei said.

At this time, Feng Rao also came forward to greet Tang Yitian and Jennifer.

Jennifer smiled at Feng Rao and said,””Miss Feng, I invited you to tour the capital with us yesterday, but I might have to go back on my word today ...”

“Are you guys busy today?” Feng Rao asked, stunned. It doesn’t matter, I can arrange it however I want. I’ll listen to our Chairman!”

“No, no, no,” Jennifer chuckled.”The tour of the capital is still as planned, but you might have other things to do, so you can’t come with us!”

When Jennifer said that, Feng Rao was even more confused. Even she did not know what work she had today, so how could Jennifer know?

At this moment, Jennifer said with a smile,””Miss Feng, let me introduce you!”

Then Jennifer pointed to the Caucasian girl sitting next to her and said,””This is Duff, an artist under Maya Entertainment.” 1

“Duff, this is Mr. Xia ruofei, the chairman of the Paradise Corporation. The beautiful lady beside him is the CEO of the Paradise Corporation, Ms. Feng Jing!” Jennifer said to the Caucasian girl.

Duff stood up and took off her sunglasses. She revealed a charming smile and said,””Mr. Xia, Ms. Feng, how are you?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Daphne. Feng Jing’s eyes slowly widened and she said in surprise,””You’re the female commander in “Star Killer”, Duff?”

“Nice to meet you, Ms. Feng. It’s an honor to meet you,” said Daphne with a smile and a nod.

“Hello, hello!” Feng Rao was also a little stunned and quickly said.

Xia ruofei did not know much about the entertainment industry, but from Feng Jing’s expression, he could guess that this Duff must be very famous as well. Otherwise, even Feng Jing would not be so surprised.

In reality, although Feng Jing was a straight – a student, she wasn’t completely above the common populace. She also had her own favorite celebrities and was similarly vain. It was just that she spent most of her time fully immersed in her work, giving others the impression that she was a strong career woman.

Furthermore, Feng Jing had studied overseas before, so she was not completely clueless about Western celebrities.

Of course, Duff was very famous and had a large number of fans in China. That was why she was wearing a large pair of sunglasses today to avoid trouble.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was not familiar with Duff, Feng Rao introduced her,””Chairman, Duff has been a very popular Hollywood star in the past few years. She used to be a supermodel, but later turned into an actress. She has acted in several movies that broke 100 million in box office sales and won countless awards! I didn’t expect her to be an artiste under Maya Entertainment ...”

Xia ruofei touched his nose awkwardly and said,””I really don’t know much about the entertainment industry ...”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei in amusement, then looked at Jennifer and asked,””Jennifer, you brought miss Duff here today for ...”

In fact, Feng Rao had already vaguely guessed Jennifer’s intentions. She had begun to get excited, but Jennifer had not confirmed it herself, so she had been holding it in.

“Feng,” Jennifer said with a smile,”I went through your company’s product introduction carefully after I went back last night. I feel that dapper is quite suitable for your brand’s position. Aren’t you worried about the brand image and spokesperson? It just so happens that she’s here with us to attend the press conference of ‘the angel of doom’, so I brought her along. If you’re willing, she can be the spokesperson for your brand!”

Feng Rao felt dizzy. This huge surprise made her wonder if she was dreaming.

Jennifer had actually introduced Duff to be the spokesperson for jaded skin cream?

Oh my God!

In the past, Feng Jing would never have even dared to dream of using a superstar like Duff. Even rich people wouldn’t be willing to endorse a small brand like paradise Corporation.

If Duff was the daughter of a wealthy family, then Dong Xinyu from yesterday was not even comparable to a maidservant at home.
