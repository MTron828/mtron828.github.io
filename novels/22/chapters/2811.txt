2812 Meeting for negotiation (1)

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and smiled.””The Chinese Football Association is really fast this time! Who is it?”

Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”you’re such a Big Shot, CEO Xia. How would they dare to slight you?” The Chinese Football Association’s Vice President Zhao came here personally. He flew all the way just to see you. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Since you’re already here,” he said,”let’s arrange a meeting!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Alright!” Zhou leiyun nodded. President Xia, when are you free? Vice President Zhao’s only mission this time is to meet you, so he can make arrangements at any time. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””It’s too late today. Let’s do it tomorrow!”

“Good! Tomorrow afternoon then. ” Zhou leiyun said,”I’ve also arranged for him to stay in this hotel. I’ve arranged for you to have lunch together in the hotel. This way, there won’t be any reporters disturbing your conversation.”

“Alright, thank you for your hard work, director Zhou!” Xia ruofei replied readily,”but I want to bring two of my friends along.”

“No problem! No problem!” Zhou leiyun agreed without a second thought.

He knew Song Wei’s identity and that Ling Qingxue was Xia ruofei’s girlfriend. Everyone on the internet knew about it. Even if Xia ruofei did not mention it, he had to include these two in the list. Otherwise, he would have offended someone.

“Is there anything else?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”then I’ll go upstairs!”

“Alright! It’s been hard on you today, President Xia, you should rest early!” Zhou leiyun hurriedly said.

Xia ruofei nodded, stood up, and walked towards the elevator.

He went to Song Wei’s room first. He rang the doorbell for a long time, but no one answered. He knocked on the door a few more times. At this moment, the door of the opposite room opened. Ling Qingxue poked her head out and smiled.”Stop knocking! Wei Wei is on my side!”

“I was wondering ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Don’t stand there! Come in, my hero!” Ling Qingxue chuckled and stepped aside.

Xia ruofei strode into Ling Qingxue’s room and saw Song Wei leant on the bed and flipping through a magazine.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had obviously taken a shower, and they were both wearing the same type of silk pajamas.

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”F * ck!” From the looks of it, you two sisters are staying together today?”

“We’ll be staying together for the next few days!” Ling Qingxue giggled and raised her eyebrows at Xia ruofei.”Do you have a problem with that?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no!” I don’t dare to have any objections! It’s good that the two great grandaunts like it!”

Song Wei could not help but smile. She looked up at Xia ruofei and asked, “It’s so late, what’s the matter?”

Xia ruofei was stunned and said,”ah?” Nothing happened! I just came over to say hello and have a chat with you guys. ”

Ling Qingxue, who was at the side, said slowly,””You just want to talk to Wei Wei, right? I saw you knocking on Wei Wei’s door. ”

Song Wei’s face heated up. She looked at Ling Qingxue and said,”Qingxue, don’t talk nonsense! Maybe he’s just looking for me to talk, and after that, he’ll just stay in your house! Speaking of which, I’m in the way ...”

Xia ruofei immediately felt a headache. He quickly waved his hand and said,””Can the two of you stop? I was wrong! I was wrong, alright?”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue burst into laughter at the same time. They were obviously teasing Xia ruofei.

“Beautiful ladies, how do you feel after watching the competition today?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei looked at each other and said,””It’s really good!”

Xia ruofei quickly asked,”What do you mean not bad?” Tell me the details!”

He was just short of writing the word “praise” on his face.

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and smiled. She counted with her fingers and said,””You’re pretty good in all aspects! Nokapu indeed lived up to its reputation. The facilities were very advanced, the fans were very strong, and the atmosphere was very good! In addition, I can finally see the superstars of Barcelona play live, especially Messi and zuáres. Their skills are well – deserved!”

Xia ruofei almost vomited blood. He widened his eyes and asked,””Just this?”

Ling Qingxue’s big eyes flashed as she asked,””What else?”

“I! I ‘ll!” Xia ruofei pointed at himself and said,”we won! And the big Hero who scored the kill goal in the last minute is standing right in front of you! Not even a comment?”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”I know!” You don’t have to emphasize it, we watched today’s game from beginning to end!”

Then, Ling Qingxue changed the topic and said,””But you’re a cultivator, shouldn’t it be normal for you to beat a group of ordinary people? What’s there to say?”

Xia ruofei was like a deflated balloon and said,””You’re right ...”

Song Wei burst out laughing and said,””Qingxue, stop teasing him! He couldn’t even bear to say a word of praise! Just now in nokapu’s box, when he scored, your scream almost broke nokapu’s ceiling. President Zhou and his friends were shocked by you!”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said,””It’s not as exaggerated as you said. Besides ... Your voice doesn’t seem to be soft either! I saw that as long as he took the ball, your little fists were clenched so tightly that your knuckles turned white!”

Xia ruofei looked on happily as Ling Qingxue and Song Wei exposed each other’s shortcomings. He felt a little better.
