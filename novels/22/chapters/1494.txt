Chapter 1495: Turning in circles on the spot (2)

Translator: 549690339

The mark he had made at this location had disappeared.

Song Wei had obviously noticed this as well. Her face was slightly pale and her heart was even more nervous.

The two of them also searched the other two roads at the fork, but they didn’t leave any traces.

Could it be that the mark would disappear on its own? Or was it that someone had cleared it from behind?

No matter which possibility it was, it would make one’s hair stand on end.

Without those marks, the two of them would very likely get lost in this complicated underground Palace.

Xia ruofei’s expression was a little ugly. He used his divine sense to communicate with Xia Qing,””What’s going on?”

“Master, there might be a formation in this underground Palace.” Xia Qing analyzed,”the area of these corridors is not as large as you think. It is very likely that you have been walking in circles.”

“A trapping formation?” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes, I am!” Xia Qing said,”it’s very likely. As for the specifics, you will have to try to crack it yourself.”

Xia ruofei frowned.”But the place we came from is gone. This means we’re not at the same place!”

“Master, you’ve entered the formation through the hole at the top. That part will definitely be blocked by the formation.” Xia Qing said,”perhaps that region is very close to you, but you will keep going in circles in another region. If you don’t break the array, you will never be able to return to that place.”

This was also the reason why Xia Qing strongly recommended Xia ruofei to obtain the earth jade talisman. In a tomb of this scale, with a world stone from the cultivation world, it was very likely that there would be various formations.

“What do we do?” Song Wei’s voice was trembling.

As an archeology student, she had naturally heard different versions of supernatural stories. She had always been proud of her courage, but when she really encountered such a situation, she could not help but tremble.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”don’t be afraid. Let’s go back according to our memory. We might be able to find the place where we came in from.”

“I guess this is the only way.” Song Wei said helplessly.

The two of them walked back for a while and realized that they didn’t need to make any markings to see that the road was different from before.

There was clearly a fork in the road, but it had become a straight passage.

It was the first time Xia ruofei had encountered such a situation. He forced himself to calm down and started to recall the knowledge he had about arrays.

Judging from the various characteristics, this was undoubtedly a trapping array.

Since it was a formation, it was definitely not unsolvable. As long as they could find the core of the formation, which was also the so – called “formation eye,” many problems could be easily solved.

However, Xia ruofei did not have much confidence. After all, he had only mastered theoretical knowledge and had never practiced it before. This time, he was simply pushing a duck onto a rack.

However, Xia ruofei had no choice but to retreat.

He took a deep breath and began to release his spiritual power, carefully sensing the changes in the surrounding atmosphere.

Since it was a trap array, it was definitely impossible to discover any clues with the naked eye. Especially in this kind of maze – like corridor, it looked the same no matter where you went, so it was even more difficult to discover any changes. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, spiritual power was different. It was much more sensitive than the human eye, and it could see through illusions in many cases.

As expected, after Xia ruofei released his spiritual power, he immediately felt the subtle changes in the surrounding aura. It was as if there were invisible mysterious lines lingering around his body.

It was a good thing that there were changes, but what was scary was a pool of stagnant water.

Xia ruofei revealed a trace of joy and immediately began to analyze the lines.

The array Formation Manual in the earth jade talisman was indeed a top – notch array formation treasure. Gradually, the unchanging corridor seemed to reveal its true appearance in Xia ruofei’s eyes.

A smile gradually bloomed on his face.

However, Song Wei could not see Xia ruofei’s expression under the gas mask. She only saw Xia ruofei standing there in a daze. She felt strange and anxious, but she did not dare to disturb him.

At this moment, Xia ruofei turned to Song Wei and said,””This way!”

Then, he pulled Song Wei’s hand and walked forward. Song Wei’s heart was beating wildly but she still held Xia ruofei’s hand tightly and did not let go.

In fact, Xia ruofei was worried that Song Wei would fall into the formation if she went the wrong way. That would be even more troublesome. Hence, he had to hold her tightly.

They didn’t walk far in this direction, and the corridor would make a 90 – degree turn.

However, Xia ruofei did not seem to see it and continued to charge towards the wall.

“Ruofei, there’s a wall up ahead!” Song Wei could not help but shout.

Before Song Wei could finish her sentence, Xia ruofei had already hit the wall. Song Wei subconsciously took half a step back. Just as she was about to scream, she realized that Xia ruofei had passed through the wall as if it did not exist.

Xia ruofei’s hand was still holding her tightly. Other than his hand, the rest of Xia ruofei’s body had disappeared. It was a strange sight.

Then, Song Wei felt a strong force pulling her, and she could not help but fall towards the wall.

Song Wei closed her eyes when she saw the wall coming at her.

However, the expected pain of hitting the wall did not come. There seemed to be no obstacles.

When she opened her eyes again, she found Xia ruofei holding her hand. The two of them were standing in the corridor. Although it looked the same, there was no 90 – degree turn. Their backs were facing the wall, as if they had come out from the wall.

Song Wei was dumbfounded and asked in shock,””RUO Fei, this ...”

“Just follow me!” Xia ruofei revealed a confident smile.”It’s just a simple smokescreen. I didn’t pay attention just now and almost fell for it!”

Song Wei’s heart was in turmoil. This so – called ‘smokescreen’ was too realistic.

Xia ruofei had already seen through the trap formation’s pattern. Then, he brought Song Wei forward quickly.

Although the reaction of the Jade Leaf was sometimes stronger and sometimes weaker, Xia ruofei did not care about Jian Jia. The most important thing now was to get out of this trap array.

There seemed to be no pattern to his route. Sometimes, it was clearly a three – way intersection, but Xia ruofei would turn in the direction where there was no road. Sometimes, Xia ruofei would bring Song Wei along a straight corridor and make a sharp turn. They would go straight through the wall. Sometimes, Xia ruofei would even turn back ...

Song Wei was already numb to it. She would follow Xia ruofei wherever he led her.

As for whether it was a wall or a statue in front of her, she didn’t care at all, because every time she passed through the wall without any accident.

After walking for about ten minutes, Song Wei saw a few bricks on the floor of the corridor in front of her. There was also a rope hanging down from the top of the cave.

She was stunned for a moment, then she cried out in joy,””Ruofei, we’ve made it out!”

After she finished speaking, Song Wei quickly ran forward.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. Seeing this hole meant that he had already walked out of the trap array’s range. Regardless of whether he could get the world stone, at least it would not be a problem to leave the ancient tomb.

However, when his spiritual power probed forward, his expression suddenly changed. He shouted,””Song Wei, stop! Come back quickly!”

Under the detection of his spiritual power, this corridor was still within the range of the trap array. Moreover, he had also discovered an extremely dangerous aura ...

However, the warning was too late. Song Wei had already reached the hole.

When her foot stepped on a brick that had fallen earlier, a sudden change occurred!

With a series of cracking sounds, Xia ruofei’s expression changed and he shouted,””Song Wei, get down!”

As he shouted the warning, Xia ruofei circulated his true Qi to the maximum and dashed towards Song Wei’s direction at lightning speed.

Swish Swish Swish ...

The sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. Xia ruofei rushed to Song Wei’s side and pushed her to the ground.

Almost at the same time, arrows were shot out from the gap between the two statues. With a series of thuds, these arrows were all deeply embedded in the opposite wall.

If he had been standing still just now, he would have become a Porcupine by now.

Song Wei was scared out of her wits. Her face turned pale and her body trembled ...
