Chapter 1501: Lost (1)

Translator: 549690339

Standing in this huge square, Song Wei finally felt how small she was.

The square was the size of three football fields, surrounded by smooth circular stone walls. The stone walls were distributed with countless holes like beehives, and each hole corresponded to a tunnel. Above them was a chaotic ceiling, and the light above it was like stars.

In such an environment, anyone would feel like they were in a dream.

Soon, Song Wei realized that the floor of the square was as smooth as a mirror. There were no cracks on the ground, as if it was a whole. She did not know what the ground was made of, but it had a warm Jade texture.

If it was such a big piece of Jade, it would be too terrifying.

Song Wei could not imagine where on earth could produce such a large piece of Jade.

Compared to Song Wei, Xia ruofei’s focus was different.

He had always been on high alert because the faint sense of danger in his heart had not dissipated.

As soon as they arrived at the square, Xia ruofei noticed a stone platform in the center of the square.

The round stone platform was located in the center of the square. There were stone steps in all four directions, and there were eight stone pillars on the stone platform. From a distance, it looked like a boxing ring.

“Song Wei, let’s go and take a look!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, Xia ruofei held Song Wei’s hand and walked towards the stone platform.

Song Wei seemed to be used to such intimate contact. She did not feel uncomfortable and leaned closer to Xia ruofei.

The two of them walked towards the stone platform step by step. Xia ruofei had been releasing his spiritual power the entire time and using his genuine Qi to form an invisible protective shield around the two of them. He did not dare to relax for even a moment.

He could sense that the atmosphere in the square was very chaotic, and he was not sure if there would be any traps along the way from here to the stone platform. He could only maintain the highest alert and respond to any changes with no changes.

However, the accident that Xia ruofei was worried about did not happen. The two of them walked safely in the empty square and soon arrived at the bottom of the stone platform.

It was only when he got closer that he could see that the stone platform was about ten meters in diameter. It was made of the same material as the Square’s ground, and under the light from the ceiling, it looked extremely warm.

Xia ruofei could feel the heat from the Jade Leaf, but he could not detect the invisible poison that had once poisoned Song Wei.

“Song Wei, take off your gas mask!” He said.

Song Wei trusted Xia ruofei. Although she was still afraid of the poison, she took off her gas mask quickly.

Xia ruofei naturally took off his gas mask and stuffed it into his bag. It was indeed a little suffocating to keep wearing a gas mask.

“Let’s go up and take a look!” Xia ruofei said.

Song Wei nodded and held Xia ruofei’s arm nervously. The two of them walked up the stairs together.

Xia ruofei was very careful when he landed, but nothing happened. The two of them stood firmly on the steps.

They looked at each other and continued to walk up the stairs.

Soon, they arrived at the stone platform. As they got closer, Xia ruofei saw that the eight stone pillars surrounding the stone platform were carved with lifelike embossed. Xia ruofei could tell that the four corners were the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and black Tortoise. As for the other four corners, they were also carved with strange beasts. However, Xia ruofei had not studied them much and could not tell what they were.

In the middle of the stone platform, there was something that looked like an altar. On it, nine golden dragons were cast. These nine golden dragons were like stars surrounding the moon, holding a stone plate. On the stone plate, there was a black stone.

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.

World stone!

After going through so much trouble on this trip, he had finally found the world stone. No wonder the Jade Leaf was so hot. The world stone was actually here.

Song Wei seemed to have sensed Xia ruofei’s emotions. She turned to look at Xia ruofei and asked,””Is that what you’re looking for?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I’m here for this!”

With that, Xia ruofei stepped forward to retrieve the world stone.

However, after taking one step, Xia ruofei stopped. He realized that something was not right.

He and Xia Qing had analyzed the presence of the realm stone in this ancient tomb through the poisonous aura in Song Wei’s body.

However, their judgment then was that the realm stone should have been infected by something cold. Yet, the realm stone in front of them did not have any cold aura at all. Xia ruofei’s mind power could not detect any trace of poison either.

Xia ruofei’s mind was spinning rapidly as he thought of many possibilities. For example, there might be other world stones in this underground Palace.

However, in the end, he still decided to take the world stone away first. No matter what, there was already a world stone in front of him. How could he not take it? As for the existence of other world stones or the location of the yin – cold objects, he could explore further in the future.

Xia ruofei thought about it and said to Song Wei,””Song Wei, wait for me here. I’ll go and take that stone down.”

“I’ll go with you ...”Song Wei said.

“It might be dangerous over there!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m afraid that I won’t be able to protect you when the time comes ... It’s just a few steps away. You just have to stand here and wait for me for two minutes ...”

Song Wei thought for a while and said,”alright then!” Please be careful ...”

After all, she did not want Xia ruofei to be distracted. She also understood that she was basically a burden to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and let go of Song Wei’s hand. He walked towards the altar in the center of the stone platform.

He maintained a high level of vigilance and pushed his spiritual power to the extreme, almost covering the entire stone platform. Once there was any sign of trouble, he would be able to react immediately.

From his position to the center of the stone platform, it was only about five meters, a distance of seven or eight steps.

One, two, three ...

Xia ruofei’s heart tightened. Song Wei clenched her fists and looked at Xia ruofei’s back nervously.

Finally, Xia ruofei arrived at the altar safe and sound.

The realm stone was right in front of Xia ruofei. As long as he stretched out his hand, he would be able to get it easily.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to check the altar. He did not find any danger or traces of an array.

He finally made up his mind. Taking a deep breath, he stretched out his hand to grab the world stone.

Everything seemed to be calm but Xia ruofei suddenly felt a sense of danger. Just as his hand was a few centimeters away from the realm stone, he stopped.

However, an invisible Whirlpool seemed to have appeared on the world stone. The moment Xia ruofei’s spiritual power came into contact with the whirlpool, it was immediately dispelled as if it had been swallowed by a black hole.

Then, Xia ruofei felt as if there was a gentle breeze. He felt as if his body was being scanned from inside out. It was an extremely uncomfortable feeling.

Before Xia ruofei could react, the entire stone platform started to shake violently. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei’s expression changed drastically. He gave up on the realm stone without hesitation and turned around to run towards Song Wei.

However, the shaking of the stone platform suddenly increased in intensity. Xia ruofei fell to the ground from the impact.

Immediately after, the eight stone pillars began to collapse, and a shocking crack appeared on the smooth ground. The inside of the crack was pitch – Black, and a terrifying aura seeped out.

Xia ruofei only had time to look at Song Wei, who was also sitting on the ground, from the corner of his eye. Then, the entire stone platform started to collapse inward, and he was sucked in by the expanding crack.

Xia ruofei was extremely anxious. Song Wei had no cultivation at all. She was in danger.

However, he couldn’t do anything now. His body fell uncontrollably, and he could only hear the sound of the wind.

The only thing Xia ruofei could do was to release his genuine Qi to protect his body.

As for his mind power, he had already tried it. Just like the world stone just now, as long as his mind power went out of his body, it would immediately be swallowed silently, and he would not be able to detect the surrounding situation at all.

Xia ruofei kept falling in the pitch – Black darkness. After a long time, he finally landed on the ground.

The moment he touched the ground, Xia ruofei reacted instinctively. He rolled forward to dissipate some of the impact.

However, even with his quick reaction and the protective Zhen Qi, he still felt his internal organs shake violently, as if they had all shifted positions. He even felt something sweet in his throat and almost spat out a mouthful of blood.

Xia ruofei knew that he was injured, and it was not a light injury.

But he couldn’t care about himself. He struggled to sit up and shouted,””Song Wei! Song Wei!”

His voice echoed in the darkness, but all he got in return was silence.

Xia ruofei did not give up and released his spiritual power again. Just like before, he could not use his spiritual power here. As long as it came out of his body, it would be devoured completely.

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and stood up with difficulty. He then took out a Zippo lighter from the spirit map space and started it.

Since he couldn’t use his spiritual power here, he could only use his eyes to search.

Xia ruofei judged that if Song Wei had fallen down like him, she would probably be unconscious by now. After all, Song Wei did not have any protective Zhen Qi and had not received any unloading training from a high altitude.

With the help of the yellow light from the vibrating Zippo, Xia ruofei fumbled around in the dark space, trying to find Song Wei.

However, he found nothing. There seemed to be only darkness here, and the entire space was as silent as death.

What Xia ruofei did not expect was that Song Wei was still standing on the stone platform safe and sound. She did not experience the earth – shattering scene just now.

However, Song Wei’s face was filled with panic and helplessness. She saw Xia ruofei’s hand stop for a moment when he was reaching for the black stone. Then, he disappeared into thin air without any warning.

This was completely beyond her understanding. Most importantly, she was the only one left in this vast and dead – Silent underground square ...
