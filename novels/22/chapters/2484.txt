Translator: 5496903Xia ruofei said seriously,”no!” No matter how busy he was at work, he had to ensure that he had enough time to rest. Wasn’t this overdrawing his life? I didn’t set a time limit for you guys, I was afraid you guys would try too hard! This Xue Jinshan ... I’ll have to teach him a good lesson later!”

“Chairman, although you didn’t set a time limit for everyone, everyone’s still anxious!” Dong Yun said with a smile. Our pharmaceutical factory’s products have always been in short supply, and the netizens are about to blow up our official Weibo. Now, no matter what the pharmaceutical factory’s Weibo posts, the bottom is full of messages urging us to start selling the jaded skin cream! After taking over the pharmaceutical company, we still have to upgrade the production line and train the technical workers. Everyone feels that time can’t wait!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head.””Now that we’re done, everyone should take a good rest! This time, I’ll give your temporary team a great merit! I’ve also prepared some benefits for everyone, so I’ll announce it in front of everyone later!”

Dong Yun laughed and said,”the Chairman’s benefits have always been generous!” Then I’ll thank you on everyone’s behalf!”

“I should be the one to thank everyone!” Xia ruofei waved his hand.

The group of them chatted as they walked and soon walked out of the airport and arrived at the parking lot.

The tall and strong young man who was helping to carry the luggage was indeed the driver that Dong Yun had brought over.

They drove a black Mercedes – Benz, and the driver opened the trunk to put the luggage. Dong Yun pointed at the car and said with a smile,””This is one of the assets of the pharmaceutical Group, and it now belongs to us!”

“Not bad, not bad!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The group got into the car. Dong Yun naturally accompanied Xia ruofei to sit in the most comfortable seat in the middle row. Qin Yanan sat in the front seat, so he Yu could only sit in the last row.

Fortunately, the Mercedes – Benz car had a longer wheel – Drive, so the space in the last row was not cramped. Moreover, he Yu’s figure was petite and dainty, so she did not feel uncomfortable sitting there.

As the car drove toward the pharmaceutical Group, Dong Yun said,””Chairman, I’ll arrange for you to stay in the pharmaceutical group’s guest house this time! Please don’t complain about the simple conditions!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”I’m not picky about these things. Do you all live there?”

“En!” Dong Yun nodded. We’ve been living in that guest house since we entered the pharmaceutical Group. But we’re already the owners of that place!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if you guys can live here, of course I can too!” It’s pretty good to stay in a guest house, and it’s also convenient to communicate with everyone. ”

After chatting for a while, Dong Yun began to report on the team’s work.

In fact, it was not complicated to take over the pharmaceutical Group, and it was very smooth at the beginning. However, the original management team of the pharmaceutical Group began to be a little uncooperative. Some of the accounts, creditor’s rights, and debt relations were not clear, and many of the assets were not clear.

After that, Xia ruofei personally got involved in this matter. At the same time, he borrowed a few people from the song family who were familiar with the situation to strengthen the team. The progress of the handover was accelerated.

Now, the entire Pharmaceutical group’s accounts had been checked. The group’s assets, including the plant, equipment, and some land, had been checked. Originally, there was still a lot of money outside, but this time, with the cooperation of the Liu family, it was quickly collected. Some of the supply contracts signed by the pharmaceutical Group had also been terminated in advance.

After all, after the Paradise Corporation took over the pharmaceutical Group, they would basically not produce the previous drugs. As far as the current situation was concerned, in the future, the pharmaceutical Group would only produce two products, the Jade skin cream and the heart – nourishing soup.

Therefore, the next step would be to modify the production line and train workers.

The production line had already been ordered Germany in advance. In the past two years, paradise Corporation had been continuously expanding the production scale of their pharmaceutical factory and had ordered production lines from German manufacturers many times. Therefore, the German manufacturers had also listed paradise Corporation as their priority customer. As soon as this order was placed, they immediately began organizing production. Now that the first batch of production line equipment had arrived in Hong Kong, they could basically connect seamlessly.

It could be said that paradise corporation’s professional technical team, financial team, and administrative team had put in a lot of effort into this handover.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and asked,””President Dong, are there any other questions?”

“There’s basically no problem,”said Dong Yun.” According to the law, peach blossom company owns 100% of the pharmaceutical group’s shares, so the pharmaceutical Group is now our wholly owned subsidiary. However ... Some of the original management team of the pharmaceutical Group wanted to stay and continue working here. We can’t make the decision, so we didn’t give them a clear answer. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and asked,””Are there many people who want to stay?”

“About half!” Dong Yun said,”I mean the management level above the Department manager. The business backbone and the bottom – Level workers are even more willing to stay.”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”have you found out about the background of these people?”

There were a few people from the song family in the receiving team. They had a better understanding of the overall situation. Dong Yun also paid attention to asking them for advice. Hence, she was prepared for Xia ruofei’s question.

She nodded and said,”I’ve done some research. The people who want to stay are basically professionals or management talents. They don’t have the Liu family’s background. They just entered the pharmaceutical Group through normal employment.”

Dong Yun knew what Xia ruofei was concerned about, so she went straight to the point.

“Then, with their academic qualifications and experience, it shouldn’t be difficult for them to find a similar job!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Dong Yun revealed a proud expression and said with a smile,””That’s right! However, when they heard that it was the Paradise Corporation that had acquired the pharmaceutical Group, and that the pharmaceutical Group would mainly produce Jade skin cream and heart – nourishing soup in the future, they immediately lost interest in other jobs. They all expressed their desire to stay and work, even if the pay was lower than before!”

“Woof! There’s already such a huge brand effect!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he muttered to himself for a while before saying,””In principle, I agree that these people should stay, but they need to be screened further ... Forget it, leave this job to me! Today, you can gather these people and I’ll meet them separately ... By the way, are there many people?”

Xia ruofei had a lazy personality. If there were hundreds of people, he would be in trouble.

Moreover, he would definitely use some hypnosis techniques. If there were too many people, it would consume a lot of mental strength.

“Not too many,” Dong Yun said with a smile,”there are only about 20 people in the group’s headquarters. In any case, there won’t be more than thirty people!”

Xia ruofei hesitated and said,””Alright! There are too many people ... Let’s make arrangements for tomorrow! Call them all to the guest house tomorrow, I’ll meet them one by one!”

“Understood!” Dong Yun said.

“By the way, make it clear to them in advance. If they stay, they might not have their previous positions. They used to be a big group, but now it’s just a branch of our Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory. Moreover, our production line is highly automated, so we don’t need to invest too much manpower in sales. As for storage ... It doesn’t seem necessary either, so some people in certain positions might need to transfer.” Xia ruofei said,”if they can accept it, then they can come and meet me tomorrow. If they can ‘t, then don’t waste everyone’s time!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun said.

Soon, the Mercedes – Benz van drove into the pharmaceutical group’s factory and stopped at the foot of an eight – story building with red tiles on the outside.

Xue Jinshan and the others were waiting in front of the guest house. Beside Xue Jinshan, there were a few people Xia ruofei did not know at all. They were all smiling warmly and greeted him before the car even came to a stop.
