Xia Qing still had confidence in Xia ruofei. Of course, it was not now.

He believed that as long as Xia ruofei gradually improved his cultivation, he would be closer to successfully making a puppet.

However, Xia ruofei did not believe this. He chuckled and said,””A great man once said, 10000 years is too long, we must seize every moment! I don’t want to slowly improve my cultivation before doing this! No matter how difficult it is, if I back out without even trying, I would be too embarrassing for our Army!”

“Master, you’re a soldier?” Xia Qing was very curious about Jian Jia. He had never heard Xia ruofei talk about this.

Xia ruofei looked nostalgic and said,””It’s all in the past. I’ve left the Army a long time ago ...”

Xia ruofei stood at the beach in a daze for a while before saying,””Alright, I should go out! Xia Qing, you’ll have to work hard during this time to take good care of the medicine garden and other crops. I’ll try to create a puppet as soon as possible to be your helper!”

“Thank you, master!” Xia Qing said respectfully.

Xia ruofei looked at the White realm Fox that was comprehending the spatial laws in the distance and said,””If that little guy causes any trouble, you have to tell me at once! I’ll come in and clean it up!”

Xia ruofei did not lower his voice on purpose. He even used the invisible force of space to send his voice to the ears of the realm Fox as if he was speaking right next to it.

The white fox trembled slightly and cupped its hands at Xia ruofei from a distance. It looked very obedient.

Xia ruofei laughed and left the medium.

After returning to his bedroom in the outside world, Xia ruofei immediately went to the bathroom to take a shower. At the same time, he threw the casual clothes he was wearing and the wet clothes he had taken out from the Archean realm into the washing machine.

When they were on the motorboat, Xia ruofei was almost drenched and felt terrible. If he did not wash off the seawater in time, white salt frost would form on his body.

Xia ruofei changed into a set of dry cotton loungewear and walked out in his slippers.

He didn’t go to rest immediately. Instead, he turned on his computer and searched for the materials needed to make the puppet.

Sure enough, although some of the materials were relatively precious, they could be found as long as one was willing to spend money.

Including the Jade used to make the core rune, all the raw stones that Xia ruofei bought from the Ruizhou public auction had been cut out. The Jade had been stored in his storage space. These high – Quality jades could fully meet the requirements to carry the core rune.

Xia ruofei created a new document on his computer and listed all the raw materials he needed except for Jade. Then, he printed a few copies and placed them on the computer table.

He didn’t go online to purchase it. Instead, he planned to hand the list to Feng Jing the next day and let her purchase it in the company’s name.

It was mainly because there were too many types of materials required and the amount of each was different. If Xia ruofei were to buy them one by one, it would be too troublesome.

Paradise Corporation was basically his own company, so there wasn’t much difference between him buying it personally and his company buying it.

Although Feng Jing and the higher – ups had a small share of the company, and some of the employees were also rewarded with shares, in reality, all of their shares added up were not even a fraction of Xia ruofei’s shares.

Taking ten thousand steps back, Xia ruofei’s purpose of making the puppets was to improve the efficiency of the spirit map space. When the efficiency was high, he would naturally be able to produce more quality goods. Other things aside, just the increase in the harvest of Cordyceps, the additional profits would be an astronomical figure. These were all real contributions to the company.

Therefore, it was reasonable for the company to pay for the raw materials.

......

The next day at work, Xia ruofei went to the general office building first and handed the list to Feng Jing, asking her to arrange for the procurement department to try their best to get everything on the list.

Feng Jing looked at the strange materials and did not know what Xia ruofei was up to. However, she was used to Xia ruofei’s whimsical ways. So far, Xia ruofei had been successful in everything he had done. This made Feng Jing, who was a calm elite, have blind trust in Xia ruofei.

Hence, Feng Jing didn’t ask any further. She called her assistant over and asked her to send the list to the purchasing department and arrange for someone to follow up on this matter.

After Xia ruofei left Feng Jing’s office, he immediately left the general office building. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He had originally wanted to talk to Dong Yun and persuade her to directly work at paradise Corporation, so that she wouldn’t have to hold the title of a consultant.

Unfortunately, Dong Yun still did not show up at the company. It was said that she had asked for another car and gone to the pharmaceutical factory for research.

“What’s there to investigate in the pharmaceutical factory?” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself,”is it worth going there every two or three days?”

However, since Dong Yun was not around, Xia ruofei was more relaxed.

He drove away from Taoyuan farm and headed in the direction of the city.

This morning, Xia ruofei’s destination was the headquarters of the lingji food and beverage group.

After returning from overseas, Xia ruofei had only called Ling Qingxue to tell her that he had returned to the three mountains safely. He had been busy for the past two days and did not even have time to see his girlfriend.

Hence, Xia ruofei felt that it was only right for him to visit Ling Qingxue.

Of course, he didn’t call Ling Qingxue first. He wanted to give her a surprise.

At the same time, Xia ruofei had another goal for this trip, which was to give Ling Xiaotian a statue of the Zhong Kui.

Last night, he had tried out a formation that he had deduced several times. In the end, he had successfully carved it on a Zhong Kui statue.

This array pattern was not Xia ruofei’s original creation. Its function was to ward off evil spirits.

Ever since he had seen the spirits in the mysterious underground Palace, Xia ruofei no longer believed that the study of souls was illusory. Since the souls were real, ghosts might exist too.

The bell tripod statue already had the effect of expelling evil and had a sense of righteousness. With this array pattern, the effect was even more impressive.

Xia ruofei looked at the statue and felt his heart palpitate.

This type of jade carving was naturally not suitable for a girl, but it was very suitable for Ling Xiaotian.

The size was also very suitable, and he could choose to wear it on his body or put it in his office as a decoration.

Half an hour later, Xia ruofei had arrived at the headquarters of the Ling Ji F & B.

He parked his car in the underground parking lot and took the elevator to the floor where the president of lingji restaurant was located.

Once Xia ruofei stepped out of the elevator, he saw a girl in charge of reception.

“Hello, Sir! Do you have an appointment?” The girl asked politely.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned cold. The staff at the front desk here knew him. He could come and go as he pleased at the headquarters of Ling Ji F & B. Many of the older employees knew that this was the future son – in – Law of the boss.

It seemed that this person was new.

“Hello, is Chairman Ling in?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”or President Ling is fine too!”

The front desk girl said with an awkward expression,””Sir, the chairman and general manager’s schedules are very tight. If you don’t have an appointment, I’m afraid ...”

“It’s okay. You can call either one of them to confirm it.” Xia ruofei smiled.”Just tell them my surname is Xia and they’ll know ...”

The front desk girl picked up the phone doubtfully and dialed.

However, she didn’t dare to call Ling Xiaotian or Ling Qingxue’s office number directly. Instead, she called Ling Xiaotian’s Secretary.

“Hello, Secretary Huang. There’s a Mr. Xia here. He said he’s looking for the chairman ...” The front desk girl said carefully.”He said the chairman ...”

Before the front desk girl could finish her sentence, Secretary Huang quickly asked,””Is it a young man with good skin and a gentle smile?”

The girl at the front desk looked at Xia ruofei and nodded with certainty.””Yes, I am!”

“Let him in directly!” Secretary Huang quickly said,”in the future, let him through immediately when you see him. Do you understand?”
