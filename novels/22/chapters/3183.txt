Under normal circumstances, projects that required supercomputers would require a lot of computation power, so it was impossible to get results in a short time.

Xia ruofei had asked for ten hours of flight time in one go, so Cai Songlin also expected that the calculation time this time would not be too short.

However, Xia ruofei was the boss of a private company after all. Cai Songlin was not sure what his project was. Hence, he did not know if Xia ruofei was worried about the safety of the data and suggested that they wait in this room.

In fact, if the time needed was too long, many people would choose to sleep in the guest house.

Some units even sent their programs remotely and entrusted the Supercomputing Center to do calculations and simulations. This was very normal.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and smiled.””Let’s go to the guest house! It was getting late, and academician Wang was not young! We can’t disturb his rest!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Wang Chi smiled and replied,”I’m fine!” Who in the field of scientific research hasn’t stayed up late?”

“That was when I was young. No one at your age would stay up late!” Xia ruofei said,”besides, the program is running. There’s nothing we can do here. We might as well go back to the room and wait!”

Wang Chi knew that Xia ruofei was more concerned about data security. He didn’t know why Xia ruofei left so easily, but he had to be grateful for Xia ruofei’s consideration.

Wang Chi said,”that works!” The rules and regulations at the Supercomputing Center were very strict. The calculation data and results were absolutely impossible to be leaked! President Xia, you can rest assured!”

Cai Songlin also quickly said,”yes, yes, yes!” We’ve done a lot of big projects, including some very secret aerospace projects, and we’ve never made any mistakes!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”of course I trust you!” This is the National Supercomputer Center, is there a safer place than this?”

The feeling of being trusted by others was very good. Cai Songlin was in a very good mood.

He smiled and said,”in that case, please go to the guest house to rest!” Old Zhong! Quickly get the guest house to open a few more rooms for President Xia’s friends to rest in!”

Director Zhong from the general office quickly said,”Alright! I’ll make the call now!”

Xia ruofei continued,”director Cai, I only have one request. Please inform me as soon as we’re done with the procedures. No matter what time it is!” I want to see the results immediately!”

“That’s no problem at all!” Cai Songlin smiled and said,”I’ll get them to call the room in chief Xia’s guest house. Call them as soon as possible!”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said.

Everyone watched for a while more. The situation in the control room was naturally calm.

Thus, the group of people walked out of the computer room and headed directly to the guest house building.

Cai Songlin and the others naturally did not know that the ‘trust’ they felt was not true trust. Even the ancient cultivation world had not been able to crack the contents of the rising Dragon medallion. If they could crack it with the help of a supercomputer this time, how important would it be? How could he easily believe that a technician would abide by the confidentiality rules?

Even if there was a 99.999% chance that the technician would not be able to understand the deciphered content, Xia ruofei and the others would not let their guard down as long as there was a slight possibility of it leaking.

The reason why Chen Xuan and the others did not object to his suggestion to wait at the guest house was because everything was under control.

The guest house was very close. Whether it was Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, Xia ruofei, or Chen Xuan, they could easily cover them with their mind power. It could be said that every move of the technicians in the control room was under their surveillance.

Even if Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha did not understand modern Science and Technology, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan knew. Under their cross – Monitoring, they would be able to detect any unusual actions from the technician.

At such a close distance, they could even deal with it immediately.

Besides, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan had also done some work on the security. The calculation data was directly packaged and encrypted, which required another program package to be decoded.

Although it was the fastest to analyze the data directly on a supercomputer, Xia ruofei would rather spend more time on a normal computer. After all, the most time – consuming process was the process of exhaustive calculations, which could not be satisfied by the performance of a normal computer.

Of course, due to time constraints, the encryption algorithm was relatively crude. As long as there was a certain amount of time, many programmers would be able to crack it.

However, Xia ruofei just needed this little bit of time to ensure that the programmers in the control room of the Supercomputing Center did not come into contact with the real calculation data. That was enough.

Hence, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan left the control room with a peace of mind. Although Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha did not know much about modern technology, they were relieved after Xia ruofei’s simple explanation through voice transmission.

The group returned to the guest house.

As usual, each person had their own room. Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan both maintained their spiritual power to cover the control room and monitor the technical staff’s actions.

Mu Sheng and the others took a short nap in the room. They didn’t know anything about modern technology anyway. Even if the technicians did something, they wouldn’t find out. Besides, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were monitoring them, which was enough.
