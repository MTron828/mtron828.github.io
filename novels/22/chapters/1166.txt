Translator: 549690339

However, he quickly reacted and avoided the main point. He said,””I won’t buy this, I carved it myself! How was it? Your cooking skills aren’t bad, right?”

“You even know how to do this!” Ling Qingxue was even more surprised. She took the Jade Leaf and looked at it over and over again. It was even more beautiful than the Jade pendants bought in jewelry stores. It felt like it had a spiritual nature! RUO Fei, you’re good!”

“Hehe! “That’s ...” Xia ruofei said proudly,”Qingxue, let me tell you, the more amazing thing is yet to come!”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei in confusion.

Xia ruofei did not keep her in suspense and quickly told her about the blood contract. Ling Qingxue’s face was full of disbelief, thinking that Xia ruofei was just teasing her!

However, Xia ruofei did not waste any time and quickly stunned Ling Qingxue with facts.

Even if Ling Qingxue didn’t have any knowledge in this area, the drop of blood that had mysteriously seeped into the Jade Leaf, as well as the faint connection between her and the Jade Leaf, were all real.

Ling Qingxue gently touched the Jade Leaf hanging on her chest, her heart surging with emotions.

After a long time, she asked,”ruofei, are you hiding something from me?” This ... This is such a magical technique. When did you learn it?”

Since Xia ruofei did not secretly collect Ling Qingxue’s blood to recognize her as his master, he naturally did not intend to hide anything from Ling Qingxue.

He had already thought it through. Ling Qingxue was his girlfriend, so there was no need to hide this from her. It wasn’t a bad thing to let her understand him a little more. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Hence, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Qingxue, the truth is ... I know more than you think, but there are some things that are a little ... How should I put it? It sounds like a fantasy, so I didn’t tell you ...”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””For example, this Jade Leaf! You should be able to feel the connection between you and it, right? In fact, the biggest effect of this Jade Leaf is not just hanging it up, but also the protective runes carved on the inside. When you encounter danger, it will automatically activate a formation to provide you protection!”

Ling Qingxue felt as if she was listening to a heavenly book. However, the truth was right in front of her eyes, and she had no choice but to believe it.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Say, if I didn’t take out this Jade Leaf, wouldn’t your first reaction be to take me for a brain check if I told you I could draw talismans and set up formations?”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing.””Then, do you know how to catch ghosts?”

“This ... I really don’t know how to!”

“Then ... Can we ride a flying sword like we do in novels and TV shows?”

“This ... I can’t do it for the time being ...”

“What about killing people with flying swords from a thousand miles away?”

“I can’t ...”

Xia ruofei’s face darkened.””What kind of questions are these? Do you really think your husband is a God who can fly? I’m telling you, although I’m very capable, there’s still a gap between me and the immortals on earth you imagine ...”

“I thought you could really ascend to the heavens!” Ling Qingxue burst out laughing.”Forget it, forget it. I just know that you’re capable!” But ... You can’t hide anything from me in the future!”

Xia ruofei suddenly felt guilty. He had indeed been hiding something from Ling Qingxue, and it was a big one!

“I wouldn’t dare!” “Yes,” Xia ruofei replied.”Wife, you have to wear this Jade Leaf with you at all times. Don’t take it off at all times. It’ll protect you!”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue replied crisply. She lowered her head and looked at the lifelike Jade Leaf in front of her chest, her heart filled with happiness.
