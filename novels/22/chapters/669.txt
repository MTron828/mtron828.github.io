Chapter 670: Bossy and domineering (2)

“Secretary li, about Yuanshan pharmaceuticals ...” He kun asked carefully,”are you okay?”

“Little he!” Secretary Li said self – deprecatingly. How could he be fine? Where one’s shoes wouldn’t get wet when they walked by the river! Yesterday, the head of the general Administration already talked to me and decided to change me to an inspector. ”

He kun couldn’t help but slap his forehead. So, this was the root of the problem.

These people at the headquarters all knew that he kun was on the side of Secretary li. Now that Secretary li had been dealt with and changed to a non – Leadership position, even these people’s attitude towards he kun had taken a 180 – degree turn.

Sometimes, the bigger the mechanism, the colder the human nature and the world would be.

“Secretary li, why is this matter so serious?” He kun didn’t know how to comfort Secretary li.

Secretary li laughed at himself and said,””Someone’s using this as an excuse! This old fellow is blocking someone else’s path, this is forcing me to make way for them!”

He kun heaved a long sigh.

“Oh right, Xiao He, is there something you need from me?” asked Secretary li.

He kun did not know what to say and could only stammer,””It’s fine, old leader. I just happened to be in Beijing today to attend a seminar ... How about this, I’ll find time to visit you tomorrow!”

“Sometimes, it’s still us old brothers who can be relied on!” Secretary Li said emotionally. Xiao He, I appreciate your kind intentions, but you don’t have to come, lest it affects you badly. ”

“It’s coming, it’s coming ...” He kun quickly said.

After hanging up the phone, he kun’s mind was in a mess as he walked toward the private room.

......

He realized that things were not looking good this time.

The connections that he had always been proud of had collapsed overnight, and this time, it was a task personally assigned by Secretary Tian. If it were the bosses of the pharmaceutical factories who had entrusted him with this task in the past, he wouldn’t have been able to complete it. But this time, he could not!

After thinking about it, he could only force himself to coordinate it.

A Chinese medicine Project wasn’t a big deal. He kun felt that as long as he lowered his stance, Qi Min might not completely ignore him.

Anyway, he had to get through this first. As for how he would pass it when he returned to the headquarters for review, he did not think too much about it for the time being.

With this in mind, he kun pushed open the door of the private room and walked in with a smile.

The atmosphere in the private room was a little strange.

Qi Min, Lu Ping, and Guo Ziyang were chatting among themselves, drinking and toasting each other while ignoring Xia ruofei and the other three.

Xia ruofei didn’t make a toast to humiliate himself. He just frowned and sat in his seat.

The development of the matter was not quite what he had imagined.

As soon as he kun came in, he immediately said enthusiastically,””Chief Qi, on behalf of the grassroots, I propose a toast to you! Thank you for your support to the grassroots! How about this, I’ll finish this glass of wine, and you can ...”

Qi Min, Lu Ping, and Guo Ziyang all had strange looks on their faces. He kun had obviously lowered his stance even more after going out for a while.

Qi Min laughed and said,”bureau chief he, you’re too kind!” You’re the leader, we should be the ones to respect you!”

Although he said that, Qi Min was just being polite with his mouth. He took the responsibility and clinked his glass with he kun ‘s. Then, he really took a small sip and did not finish it in one go. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He kun’s expression froze for a moment. Then, he chuckled and finished the white wine in his glass. He even politely showed the bottom of the glass to Qi Min.

Xia ruofei, who was standing at the side, could not understand the situation. What was he kun up to? Were all the government officials in the Ministry of State affairs so impressive? A section – Level cadre was in a hurry to put on airs in front of the Deputy – Level Deputy Director of the local Food and Drug Administration?

Qi Min had already had a drink before he came, so his face was glowing with health. He picked up some food with his chopsticks and put it in his mouth. As he chewed, he said,””Bureau chief he, the president of the pharmaceutical company you brought here today seems to be very arrogant! I’ve been in here for half a day, but I haven’t seen him offer a toast! Do you still want to get things done?”

“President Xia, come on, let’s toast to Section Chief Qi,” he kun said quickly.

Hearing this, Xia ruofei helplessly picked up his glass and stood up. Lu Ping and Guo Ziyang looked at Xia ruofei with interest.

Xia ruofei did not know what was going on. He held his wine glass and walked in front of Qi Min.

Qi Min didn’t say a word at first, but when Xia ruofei walked in front of him, he suddenly waved his hand and said,””Forget it, I don’t like to drink with men!”

Xia ruofei immediately frowned. Wasn’t he deliberately humiliating him? If you don’t want to drink, why did you suggest it? To suddenly say something like this when someone else was holding a glass of wine in front of you, this was also domineering to a certain extent.

At this time, the Chief of Staff, Lu Ping, said with a smile,””President Xia, don’t you understand what chief Qi is trying to say? Get this little beauty from your company to come over and propose a toast!”

Xia ruofei frowned, but before he could speak, he kun said,””Xiao Bai, since chief Qi has called you, come over and have a toast!”

Xia ruofei wanted to say something but stopped. However, since he kun had already spoken, it would not be good for him to reject him. After all, he kun had already lowered his stance for his sake.

Although Xia ruofei didn’t know why it was like this, he knew that something must have gone wrong.

Besides, it was normal to toast each other at the table. Xia ruofei did not need to vent his anger on he kun.

Bai He’s pretty face blushed slightly. She stood up a little nervously and brought the cup to Qi Min. She said softly,””Section Chief Qi, let me toast you. Please take care of our company’s new drug project.”

Qi Min casually leaned back in his chair and said,””Well said, well said. Let’s see how the beauty performs ...”

Bai He hesitated for a moment.”Section Chief Qi, I can’t hold my liquor well. Why don’t I finish this glass of wine? you can do whatever you want.”

Qi Min laughed and said,”I’ve never been casual when drinking with beautiful women!” But since you can’t drink, then let’s do something else ...”

Lu Ping’s eyes lit up and he smiled.””Section Chief Qi, you’re here to have a cross – cupped drink with this little beauty, right?”

Deputy researcher Guo Ziyang also clapped his hands and praised,””This is a good suggestion! Section Chief Qi is the most handsome man in our Traditional Chinese Medicine Department! It’s really wonderful for a handsome man and a beautiful woman to cross cups and drink!”

Seeing this, Xia ruofei’s eyes couldn’t help but reveal a sharp glint. He finally couldn’t take it anymore.

Bai He was an undergraduate student who had just walked out of the university campus. She had never seen such a scene before. She was at a loss, and a trace of panic appeared in her eyes.

Lu Ping was still proudly saying,””It seems that beautiful women don’t know how to drink cross – cupped wine! Section Chief, why don’t you let this President Xia and his staff give a demonstration to the beautiful woman?”

“I think it’s fine!” Qi Min laughed as he glanced at Xia ruofei.

He kun saw that Xia ruofei’s expression was getting uglier and uglier. He hurriedly shot him a look, asking him to be patient.

However, Xia ruofei was not someone who would swallow his anger. He had been holding back before, mostly because he wanted to save he kun’s face.

However, Qi Min and the other two were insatiable and provoked him again and again. Xia ruofei had long lost his patience.

“Enough!” Xia ruofei shouted.

Then, he threw the glass in his hand to the ground, making a sound of glass breaking.

Xia ruofei’s eyes emitted a cold glint as he stared at Qi Min. The murderous aura in his eyes made Qi Min shiver.

Qi Min suppressed the fear that came from the bottom of his heart and said sternly,””Bureau chief he, what does your friend mean by this? They can’t even take a small joke and still want me to work for them?”
