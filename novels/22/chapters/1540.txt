Chapter 1541: Upgrade threshold_2

Xia ruofei nodded. He suddenly had an idea and asked,””By the way, I have a rather large raw stone. I’d like to leave it with you for the time being. Is that alright?”

“It can be done! May I ask which one is it?” The staff member asked.

“Number 1896.”

“Alright, please wait a moment!”

The staff member operated the computer and changed the status of the stone from “trade completed, immediate purchase” to “temporary storage”. Then, he sent Xia ruofei a storage slip.

She said,”Sir, please keep this list. The public Jade bid will end in three days. We will keep it for you for free for three days. You can pick up the goods with this list at any time during these three days.” I need to remind you that we only recognize the receipt, not the person, so you must not lose it. ”

“I know, thank you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Yu mingdong still had a few raw stones that the bidding results had not yet come out, so he was not in a hurry to trade. He just waited at the side.

After a while, two staff members pushed a small cart to the information desk. The cart was carrying the seven raw stones that Xia ruofei had his eyes on.

Yu mingdong took a look and saw that they were indeed small raw stones with average appearance. He was even more certain that Xia ruofei did not know how to identify Jade raw materials.

These seven raw stones also cost more than three million Yuan. Yu mingdong estimated that this three million Yuan might have been wasted. If he was lucky, he might be able to get a million Yuan worth of Jade. If he was unlucky, he might have used more than three million Yuan to buy seven pieces of useless stones.

However, since Xia ruofei was in such high spirits, he could not pour cold water on him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Sir, these are the seven raw stones that you won the bid for just now. Please check them!” The staff said.

Xia ruofei had already memorized the appearance of the seven raw gemstones clearly. However, he still held each one in his hand and looked at it seriously. He also used the spirit map to verify it.

Although it was unlikely that there would be any tricks in such a big public Jade bid, Xia ruofei was still very cautious.

The spirit painting still had a strong reaction, which meant that the item had not been switched. Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””No problem!”

“There’s free equipment for cutting stones next door,” the staff said enthusiastically.”You can go there directly.”

Xia ruofei said,”I don’t plan to unseal these raw stones for the time being. I want to take them away directly. By the way, I saw people from the escort company at the entrance. Can I ask them to help me transport them to the hotel?”

When Yu mingdong heard Xia ruofei say that he didn’t plan to cut the raw stone immediately, he was slightly relieved. He was also worried that there would be no green in the raw stone. Qianqian’s raw stone No. 1896 was still fine, but he really didn’t have high hopes for these black raw stones!

“Yes!” The staff replied. If you need it, I can help you contact them, but you’ll have to pay for it yourself. ”

“Alright, I’ll have to trouble you then!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he turned to Yu mingdong and said,””Chief Yu, I plan to bring these raw stones to the hotel first! I have a friend in Spring City, he can help me find a way to transport it back to the southeast. ”

Yu mingdong was also a little surprised. By right, a young master like Xia ruofei would definitely be eager to cut the stone after buying it. He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to not only not be in a hurry to cut the stone today, but also to bring it back directly.

Xia ruofei had also guessed Yu mingdong’s thoughts. He smiled and explained,””I have a friend in the three mountains who is very interested in the mysterious stone gambling. It just so happens that these raw stones are not big, so I want to bring them back and cut them with her to satisfy her curiosity ...”

Xia ruofei winked at Yu mingdong after he finished.

Yu Ming Dong suddenly came to a realization and said with a smile,””Mr. Xia, you must be a female friend, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled but did not say anything.

Yu mingdong knew what Xia ruofei was thinking. Yingluo just wanted to show off in front of women. A few million to buy a few stones to cut for fun. How domineering! If there was some Jade inside, he could give it to that woman directly and maybe he could get close to her.

This was mainly because Yu mingdong had already assumed that Xia ruofei was the kind of rich young master. That was why he was unknowingly misled by Xia ruofei.

He laughed and said,”I understand!” He understood! Anyway, these raw stones aren’t very big. If your friend has connections in Civil Aviation, it’ll be very convenient for him to fly back by air!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

“Mr. Xia,” Yu mingdong said,”I’ve already booked a hotel room for you in advance before you came. I still have to keep an eye on you here, so I won’t be going back with you ...”

After he finished speaking, Yu mingdong waved his hand and called Shi Lei over. He said,””Lei Zi, accompany Mr. Xia back to the hotel ...”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no need, no need. Just give me the room card. Aren’t there people from the escort company here?”

Yu mingdong was a little hesitant. The people of the escort company were only responsible for delivering the things to the place. They wouldn’t help you guard them all the time. In fact, Ruizhou was quite chaotic. No matter how much the real value of those raw stones was, they still spent more than three million Yuan!

However, on second thought, there should not be an open robbery in a five – Star hotel. Besides, Xia ruofei said that he had contacted his friends in Spring City in advance and they would be here to transport the raw stones very soon. He also needed Shi Lei to follow him. If anything happened, Shi Lei could protect him. So, he agreed with Xia ruofei’s suggestion.

Yu mingdong asked Shi Lei to pass the room card to Xia ruofei. The people from the escort company had already arrived at the service desk after receiving the notice.

Five or six escorts, all armed with guns and carrying boxes that looked like money – carrying boxes, quickly packed the seven raw stones.

The distance from here to the hotel was at most three to four kilometers, and the escort fee was 3000 Yuan. Fortunately, the organizer of the public Jade bid collected the fee on his behalf. Otherwise, Xia ruofei would not have so much cash.

After he swiped his card, he said goodbye to Yu mingdong and Shi Lei, and followed the escort out of the public auction site.

Xia ruofei took the escort car of the escort company and arrived at the five states hotel, which Yu mingdong had booked in advance, in less than ten minutes. The journey was calm and there were no accidents.

The escort carried the box and sent Xia ruofei straight to the hotel room. He took the raw stone and left politely.

In just 15 minutes, he had received 3000 Yuan. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh. This money was too easy to earn!

After the escort left, Xia ruofei immediately locked the door.

This was a small suite. Other than the bedroom, there was a small living room.

Xia ruofei went straight to the bedroom, locked the door and pulled the curtains. Then, he immediately released his spiritual power to check the entire room.

After confirming that there were no problems, Xia ruofei summoned the spirit map scroll in his palm.

He silently prayed in his heart, then with a thought, he put all seven raw gemstones into the spirit map space.

Although the Jade in the raw stone had not been cut out, it did not affect the absorption of the spirit map space.

“You must level up!” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

The Jade contained in these seven raw stones was more than all the Jade materials he had absorbed into the spirit map space. In addition, he had absorbed so many realm stones. If he still could not upgrade the spirit map space, Xia ruofei would have to get the largest raw stone back.

He sent his mind into the spirit map space, and the invisible spatial force wrapped around the first raw stone. Soon, the Jade essence inside the raw stone was rapidly absorbed by the space, and in less than a minute, the raw stone was reduced to a pile of powder.

The Jade contained in it had not even had the time to show its peerless beauty to the world before it was completely absorbed.

There was still no reaction from the spirit map space. Xia ruofei’s expression was calm as he continued to aim for the second raw gemstone.

Two, three, four ...

He quickly absorbed the seventh piece, but there was still no movement in the spirit map space.

Just as Xia ruofei’s face showed a trace of disappointment, he suddenly felt the space around him tremble. Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up. He knew that the space was on the verge of upgrading.

At this time, the seventh raw gemstone had not been fully absorbed yet. The spirit map space was still greedily absorbing the Jade essence within the raw gemstone!

Even though it was not a problem to upgrade the space, Xia ruofei did not want to run out of Jade at the last moment. He had to go to the public Jade bid again to bring back the largest raw stone, which would cause a lot of trouble.

Hold on! They must have enough! Xia ruofei shouted in his heart as if the last raw stone could hear him.
