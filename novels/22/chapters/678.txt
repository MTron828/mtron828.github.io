Chapter 679: The world stone has appeared again?

Song Rui hung up the phone after reporting the situation to his grandfather.

The only thing he could do was to wait patiently. Everything would be arranged by elder song.

The song family still valued general Zhao Cheng, especially when he was suddenly diagnosed with diabetes. The song family was caught off guard. Once Zhao Cheng was transferred, the song family would lose a Deputy region in the military. This was too passive.

Although Zhao Cheng wasn’t the leader of the song family in the military, he was at least one of the leading figures!

However, diabetes was a disease that could not be cured. It was not something that could be cured with the best doctors, the best medicine, or treatment abroad.

Now that he knew that Xia ruofei had a way and was willing to help, song Rui knew that the family would not give up hope. It all depended on the final arrangement.

Song Rui waited for about an hour and a half.

At a little past eighto’ clock, his phone rang again.

“Hello,” he said. Song Rui quickly picked up the call.

“Xiao Rui, wait a moment. The chief is on the phone with you.” Manager Lu’s voice came from the phone.

Very quickly, elder song’s deep voice could be heard.”Xiao Rui, I’ve already called Zhao Cheng personally. Go and meet up with Xiao Xia now. A car from the military will be here to pick you up in an hour!”

“Grandpa, we’ll have to make some preparations for uncle Zhao’s side!” Song Rui quickly said.

“Of course, I know that. Ruofei is a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner!” Elder song said,”I’ve already told Zhao Cheng! As long as it can cure his diabetes, he would immediately send soldiers to move the Chinese medicine room back to the General Hospital of the military Region!”

......

“Hehehe ...” Song Rui couldn’t help but laugh.”By the way, you didn’t forget to remind him to have absolute trust in the doctor, right? I heard that uncle Zhao is famous for hiding his illness and avoiding treatment ...”

Elder song couldn’t help but recall some of Zhao Cheng’s funny stories. He was both angry and amused.

“Not only did I remind him, but I also gave him a good scolding. I told him that if he dared to disobey Dr. Xia, I’ll personally break his legs with my walking stick the next time we meet!” Elder song said.

“Since that’s the case, I can rest assured!” Song Rui said with a smile.

“Alright, alright! Don’t try to be glib!” Elder song said,”quickly inform Xiao Xia! Also, remember to convey my personal gratitude to him. ”

“Yes, Grandpa!” Song Rui quickly replied.

After hanging up the phone, song Rui immediately contacted Xia ruofei.

“Ruofei, are you up?” Song Rui asked,”which hotel are you staying at? I’ll meet up with you, the Beijing military will pick us up in a while!”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”is everything arranged?” Then come over! I’m at the Beijing office of the three mountains. Do you know the Rongcheng hotel? Room 1313, come up directly when you’re there!”

“Alright! I’ll see you later!”

……

40 minutes later, in Room 1313 of the Chengdu hotel.

Song Rui casually sat on the sofa and opened Xia ruofei’s special cigarette. He lit one and took a deep puff before asking,””Ruofei, don’t you have anything to prepare?”

Xia ruofei laughed and pointed at his head.”My things are all in my head, what do I need to prepare? When will the car arrive? we’ll leave with our bags!”

Song Rui laughed dryly.”I think uncle Zhao still needs to prepare, but it’ll be soon ... By the way, Grandpa asked me to convey his gratitude to you this morning. I’ve finally done it!”

“Hey! I’m treating general Zhao’s illness, why would the chief even thank me!” Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry.

“Everyone knows this.” Song Rui said with a smile.

“Alright, alright!” Xia ruofei raised both his hands.

The two of them chatted on and off. He kun and the Secretary were probably nervously waiting for the notice of director Zeng’s summons and did not come over to disturb Xia ruofei.

Song Rui’s phone rang at around nine.

He took it out and looked at the caller ID. He smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Uncle Zhao is calling!”

Then, song Rui pressed the answer button and said with a smile,””Uncle Zhao, how are you?”

“Xiao Rui! Where are you? I’ll immediately send a car over to pick you up!” On the other end of the line, Zhao Cheng sounded tired, but he still had the spirit of a soldier.

“Uncle Zhao, doctor Xia and I are at the Rong city hotel on the east side of the Fourth Ring Road.” Song Rui said.

“Alright! The car will be here in half an hour!” Zhao Cheng said, then hung up.

“This old Zhao!” Song Rui pursed his lips and said,”you’re always so energetic!”

Song Rui only dared to say that after Zhao Cheng hung up the phone. In front of him, song Rui had always been very honest.

Zhao Cheng said it would take half an hour, and it really was half an hour.

Half an hour later, Xia ruofei and song Rui were already in a domineering warrior command vehicle. Of course, it was only domineering in comparison. Compared to Xia ruofei’s Knight XV, the warrior command vehicle was like a little girl.

A class 3 Sergeant Major with a cold expression was driving the car seriously. Other than occasionally glancing at the rearview mirror, he looked straight ahead and didn’t say a word the whole time.

The person in charge of driving the vehicle was a 36 – year – old Colonel.

The Colonel’s name was Jin Feng. He had a strong body and dark skin. His hair was straight and he was in high spirits. Even in the car, he maintained a straight sitting posture.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
