3148 Exchange meet (1)

Chapter 1720: the first Prince!

“Easy! What’s not easy?” Zhao Yongjun said readily,”I’m familiar with the leaders of these three universities, and this is an Academic Exchange, not something illegal. Who knows how many academic exchanges those experts and professors attend every year! What’s the problem with him participating in our event?”

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but laugh,””Hahaha! Ruofei, I suddenly thought that our Paradise Club is the most suitable host for this exchange! Look! The environment there is beautiful, the facilities are complete, the venue is ready, and we don’t have to leave the Beijing area. The time of the experts and professors is easy to coordinate. They can totally take out a day to have an exchange, and then have fun in our club, or even soak in the hot spring! I’m sure you’ll be satisfied. What do you think of my idea?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””Big brother Zhao, you’ve already planned this, right? Since you’ve already thought of it for me, what other opinion can I have? We’ll do as you say!”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and then asked,”then which day do you want to set? I’ve already spoken to the school. Any day will do. The experts and professors will definitely make time for us!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”then let’s arrange it the day after tomorrow!” How about the morning of the day after tomorrow?”

He considered spending another two days in the library. Whether he could reach the level of “knowing what he knows” or not, he had to at least make his knowledge reserve more sufficient. Otherwise, it would be too embarrassing if he showed his weakness in front of the expert professor and asked some childish questions.

“No problem!” Zhao Yongjun said readily,”then I’ll pass on the message! We’ll have a small Academic Exchange in the morning the day after tomorrow. I’ll contact the other three universities to make sure that the best experts in their fields can be there!”

“Alright! Thanks!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Don’t be so polite with me!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”drink a few more glasses with me the night after tomorrow. It’s better than anything else!”

“It’s a must!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we won’t leave until we’re drunk!”

“Do you think I don’t know your alcohol tolerance? You can still get drunk? The so – called “you won’t go back until you’re drunk ...” Is that you won’t go back until I’m drunk!” Zhao Yongjun exposed Xia ruofei’s words without hesitation.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s all the same!” It was all the same! When brothers drink, it’s mainly for joy! I don’t have any intention of getting anyone drunk!”

“You said it!” Zhao Yongjun said,”if I get drunk, I’ll hold you responsible!”

Zhao Yongjun didn’t even dare to mention the standard of drinking. Even if he had to give Xia ruofei a glass and a bottle, he wasn’t confident that he could make Xia ruofei drink to the ground. So, he just used himself as the standard, which was a bit unreasonable.

Xia ruofei didn’t mind and smiled.””No problem!”

After hanging up, Xia ruofei told Chen Xuan and the rest about Zhao Yongjun contacting the experts and professors. Then, he said,””I’ve scheduled the academic Exchange for the morning of the day after tomorrow. We’ll go to the library again tomorrow and the day after tomorrow to learn as much knowledge as possible.”

“Alright!” Chen Xuan nodded with a smile.”I’ll follow your arrangements!”

Xia ruofei looked at Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha and smiled.””Two seniors, the exchange will be held at the peach blossom clubhouse in the suburbs the day after tomorrow. It’s a small business that I started with my friends, and the environment is not bad! I wonder if the two seniors would be interested in going over to have some fun?”

Xia ruofei didn’t wait for their reply and immediately said,””I’ve made some small decorations in the club. Therefore, the environment there is very unique in the secular world. If you two seniors want to go there together, you might as well give me some guidance!”

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha had originally wanted to stay in siheyuan to cultivate, but after Xia ruofei said that, they were suddenly interested.

“Since little brother Xia has said so, then Valley master Liu and I have to go and take a look!” Mu Sheng said with a smile.

“Fellow Daoist Xia has already piqued our curiosity, so how can we refuse?” Liu Mansha also said with a smile. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then let’s go together!” Miss Xin ‘er and brother Jianfei, let’s go together. Putting aside the environment there, you can also experience some of the pleasures of the secular world! There’s a different taste to it!”

Yu Xin ‘Er and Mu Jianfei naturally followed their elders and nodded in agreement with a smile.

Xia ruofei had set up the nine rotation universe formation in the Paradise Club, which made the spiritual Qi in the Paradise Club much more abundant than the outside world. One could even cultivate all the time. Especially in the small villa where the eye of the formation was located, the concentration of spiritual Qi was much denser.

Even the hot spring resort near the club also benefited greatly because it was located on the periphery of the array. Although the environment and facilities were the same as before, the business was several times better. From being completely deserted to being full of guests, even the owner of the hot spring resort didn’t know that they were taking advantage of the Paradise Club.

Of course, everything was relative.

After all, the nine revolutions heaven and earth formation was not a particularly high – Level formation. It was far inferior to the sect’s formation of Mu Sheng and the others.

The concentration of spiritual energy in the Paradise Club was also far from that of those old sects.
