Chapter 511: Agree to him (1)

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were stunned by Qin Xiaoyu’s attitude. Manager li was completely confused about what was going on. Why did this aggressive policewoman suddenly come?

Feng Rao looked at Qin Xiaoyu with a strange expression, wondering if this was the Chairman’s girlfriend. Did the two of them get into an argument?

The last time Ling Qingxue came to the farm, Feng Rao had not seen her. She only knew that Xia ruofei used the farm’s Mercedes – Benz to send his girlfriend. Today, when she saw Qin Xiaoyu’s angry look, she really did look like a barbaric girlfriend, and it was hard not to have wild thoughts.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not know about Feng Rao’s messy thoughts. In fact, he was completely confused.

Although Lu You had told him about receiving the award that day, Xia ruofei’s mind was completely focused on finding the Supreme – grade suet white jade. After that, Liang Haiming kidnapped Ling Qingxue and the series of events. Xia ruofei had long forgotten about this small matter.

“Officer Qin, what’s the situation?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion,”did you call me?”

“I called you an hour ago. It rang a few times before you hung up. Then, you turned off your phone. Don’t tell me you don’t know!” Qin Xiao Yu said with a cold smile.

Xia ruofei then remembered that he had received a call on his way back to the farm. He had even blocked her ...

However, this didn’t seem to be a big deal. It was just a misunderstanding! Did officer Qin have to be so angry? He even came to the farm personally ... Xia ruofei could not help but criticize him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Oh ... I thought it was a harassment call ...” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Harass my ass! Who likes to harass you ...”Qin Xiao Yu was so angry that smoke was coming out of her seven orifices.

Feng Jing and manager li looked at each other, feeling a little awkward.

“Chairman, since you’re busy, why don’t I bring manager li to survey the site?” Come back after you’re done here. ”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and nodded.””Sure, I’m sorry, manager li!”

“It’s fine, it’s fine. It’ll be the same if you take me there, President Feng,”said manager li quickly.

After Feng Jing and manager li had left, Xia ruofei asked,””Officer Qin, tell me! Why are you looking for me? I don’t think it’s a crime to hang up on you? I’m sure you don’t have to make a trip down personally for such a small matter. ”

Qin Xiao Yu was already upset after Xia ruofei hung up on her. Now that she saw Xia ruofei’s smug look, she was even more furious and could not help but glare at Xia ruofei.

However, she remembered Chen Bo’s warning and could only control her emotions. She bit her lower lip and asked stiffly,””I told you a few days ago to contact the Public Security Bureau to collect the bonus. Why didn’t you contact them?”

“Bonus?” Xia ruofei repeated subconsciously. Then, he remembered that Lu You had indeed mentioned this to him. Hence, he said,”Oh, I remember now. You’re talking about the reward for capturing Zhao Zhixi, right?”

Qin Xiao Yu didn’t speak and looked at Xia ruofei coldly.

Xia ruofei shrugged.”I’ve been busy these few days. I forgot.”

Qin Xiao Yu gritted her teeth in anger, this guy was really too hateful! It was a 100000 Yuan bonus! He had actually forgotten! She had been criticized for no reason. It was an undeserved disaster.

If not for Chen Bo’s words in the morning, Qin Xiaoyu would have told Xia ruofei that his bonus had been canceled because he did not contact the public security Agency within the time limit!

I really want to see the heartache on his face when he finds out that his forgetfulness has caused him to lose a hundred thousand Yuan ... Qin Xiao Yu said in her heart.

But then she thought,’this guy seems to be quite rich, and he didn’t take this matter to heart at all, so he probably won’t feel much heartache, right?’

When Qin Xiao Yu was still lost in her thoughts, Xia ruofei saw that she was not speaking and could not help but ask,””Officer Qin, you came to the farm for this? I seem to have missed the deadline, right? So be it if he didn’t have the money! I won’t blame you. After all, I forgot ...”

Qin Xiao Yu could not help but widen her eyes. Just as she was about to speak her real intention, Xia ruofei continued,””If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave ... As you can see, I’m really busy here, so I won’t keep you ...”

Xia ruofei was about to leave after he finished speaking.

Qin Xiao Yu quickly called out,”Hey!” Wait a minute ...”

“Anything else?” Xia ruofei stopped and turned around to ask.

Qin Xiao Yu gently gritted her teeth, thought for a moment and said: “”Xia ruofei, since you didn’t do it on purpose, we can give you a chance to redeem yourself. Come to our station tomorrow to get ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no, no, no, I can’t let you break the rules!” Besides, I didn’t arrest Zhao Zhixi for the prize money that day. Officer Qin, I don’t want the money. Thank you for your kindness!”

Xia ruofei made a gesture to leave after he finished speaking, but Qin Xiao Yu shouted anxiously,””Xia ruofei, we’re not done yet! Don’t go yet ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and helplessly.””Officer Qin, can you please tell me everything in one breath? I’m really busy ...”

Qin Xiaoyu made up her mind and said directly,””Our Bureau is going to hold a public award ceremony tomorrow to give you a reward for your bravery. There will be a lot of news media coming for interviews tomorrow. The director asked me to tell you that you must attend!”
