Chapter 1298: the first Prince!

An hour later, a Huaxia airlines plane with the national flag painted on its body took off from Beijing International Airport.

Xia ruofei was on the plane. His destination was Shen Cheng International Airport, which was hundreds of kilometers away.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s final destination would not be Shen Cheng city.

In fact, he only stayed in Shen Cheng for a little more than an hour. He did not even leave the airport’s restricted area. He directly took a plane from China Airlines to bolé airport Ethiopia’s capital, Ethiopia.

Xia ruofei’s final destination was arulei, a small country on the mainland of Africa.

However, many countries in China and Africa did not have direct flights. Some small countries in Africa had to transfer planes.

The boullé airport in Africa was one of the busiest airports in Africa. Many Chinese corporate employees who went to Africa for business trips would transit here. When they returned to the country, they would also transfer flights at boraine airport first.

Xia ruofei had booked an international flight from Hua Xia airlines. As the flight was more than twelve hours long, Xia ruofei had naturally booked a first – Class ticket.

In fact, the so – called luxury first – Class cabin was just like that. At most, the seats were more comfortable and spacious. In addition, the seats could be laid flat to become a bed. Of course, it was not as spacious as the bed at home. People who were slightly higher would have to curl up to sleep.

If not for the need to change his appearance, Xia ruofei would definitely choose a private business jet for such a long flight. Even if he had to refuel once on the way, the entire travel experience would definitely be more comfortable than taking a civil aircraft.

Of course, Xia ruofei was also born a poor child. He had been in the Army for so many years. Although the conditions were better now, he was not so pretentious as to not be able to stand sitting in a plane for more than ten hours. There were so many people who were reluctant to part with the expensive tickets and chose Economy Class!

It was already evening when the plane took off from Shen Cheng. When the plane climbed to the cruise altitude and the seat belt indicator light went out, it was already dark outside the porthole.

The air stewardesses also began to leave their seats to serve the passengers. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The service in the first – Class cabin was very thoughtful. The stewardess first brought blankets, toiletries, pajamas, headphones, and so on. Each first – Class passenger had one.

Then came the menu. Yingying could order in first class.

In fact, China Airlines even allowed people to order food online before traveling, but Xia ruofei didn’t want to go through the trouble. After all, there weren’t many choices. Besides, people’s appetites would be reduced and their taste buds would become dull in the air. It didn’t matter what they ate.

The first – Class meal was actually just a relatively high – Class in – Flight meal.

Xia ruofei casually ordered a few dishes and a glass of red wine, mainly for a more comfortable sleep.

Soon, the food he ordered was served. The plate presentation was quite exquisite, but the amount was a little small.

Xia ruofei quickly finished his dinner and sipped the red wine.

An air stewardess quickly came over and asked him softly if he wanted to eat anything else.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’m full.” Thank you for taking all these! By the way ... After you’re done, can you help me lay down my seat? I’m going to rest. ”

“Alright!” Said the air stewardess as she started to pack up.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, went to the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash his face. He also changed into the cotton pajamas provided by the airline.

When he returned to his seat, the stewardess had already made his bed and brought him a small blanket.

“If I don’t wake up, please wake me up in seven hours.” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes, sir!” The air stewardess said respectfully,”good night!”

“Thank you!”

Xia ruofei snuggled under the covers, put on the headphones, and picked a movie from the multimedia system. After a while, he fell into a deep sleep.

About seven hours later, the air stewardess came to wake Xia ruofei up.

He rubbed his eyes and sat up. The plane was still flying steadily at the cruising altitude.

Xia ruofei looked out of the porthole and saw that it was still dark.

He got up and went to the bathroom to wash up and change his clothes. When he returned to his seat, the air stewardess had already restored the bed to the seat.

For the next three to four hours, Xia ruofei sat in his seat, feeling bored. As time Ethiopia five hours slower than in China, it was still midnight here even though it was almost morning in China. It was pitch black outside the porthole and he could not see anything.

At around 1 am local time, China Airlines ‘giant Airbus landed smoothly at bolé airport in Ethiopia.

Xia ruofei picked up his small backpack and got off the plane.

The airport was not very busy in the early morning. The frequency of take – off and landing was much lower than during the day, and there were not many people in the terminal.

There were only two flights from bolé airport to arulei airport every day. The earliest flight was at noon the next day, so Xia ruofei had already booked a local hotel in advance and decided to rest for a while before boarding.

Therefore, besides arulei’s tourist visa, Xia ruofei also applied for an Ethiopia visa.

Of course, this was all done in a short time with the help of Zhao Yongjun.

When Zhao Yongjun found out that Xia ruofei was coming to Africa, he didn’t ask why he was there. He just made thorough preparations for him. Other than helping him with the visa, he also took into account some other details.
