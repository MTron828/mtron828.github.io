Chapter 1604: Du Qinghong (1)

Translator: 549690339

The moment the door opened, Xia ruofei saw Ling Xiaotian playing chess with a middle – aged man in his fifties.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. A daughter knows her father best! He was right!

Ling Xiaotian was currently holding a chess piece in deep thought. When he heard the sound, he turned his head and looked over. Immediately, he said as if he had been pardoned,””Yo! RUO Fei is here! Hurry up! Come in and sit!”

Then he threw the chess piece on the chessboard and said,””Old du, my son – in – Law is here. I won’t be playing today!”

The middle – aged man didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Old Ling, you’re already a man of several decades, why are you still acting shamelessly? I can kill you in three steps at most!”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and casually messed up the chessboard. He lied through his teeth,””You’re bragging! How come I don’t see it as a dead end? We’re clearly at a stalemate, and we’re evenly matched, alright!”

The middle – aged man gritted his teeth in anger and muttered,””I’ve never seen such a rascal like you!”

Ling Xiaotian did not take it to heart and said to Xia ruofei,””Come, ruofei, let me introduce you. This is du Qinghong, the president of the three mountains mystical society. He’s an old friend of mine. You can just call him uncle du!”

Ling Xiaotian then said to du Qinghong,””Old du, this is my son – in – Law, Xia ruofei!”

Du Qinghong was still a little indignant at Ling Xiaotian’s shameless behavior in chess. He shot a glance at Ling Xiaotian and said,””When did Qingxue get married? How come I didn’t know?”

Du Qinghong’s words immediately made Ling Qingxue’s face blush.

On the other hand, Ling Xiaotian sneered and said,””Future son – in – Law ... But the two children have a good relationship, so marriage is only a matter of time ...”

Du Qinghong stood up and smiled at Xia ruofei.””Young man, I’m just joking. Don’t mind me ... I’ve known old Ling for many years, and we’re used to bickering, haha ...”

“Hello, uncle du!” Xia ruofei said politely.

“Hello, hello!” Du Qinghong said with a smile. He then turned to look at Ling Qingxue and said with a smile,”Qingxue, you’re getting more and more beautiful!”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”uncle du is getting younger and younger!” When can I teach my dad some health – Maintenance skills? You’re only two or three years older than my dad, so you look like you’ve been with him for two generations. ”

When Ling Xiaotian heard this, he could not help but chided,”stinky girl!” What a rude person! How can you insult your dad like this?”

“I’m just telling the truth!” Ling Qingxue chuckled.”Dad, why don’t you get RUO Fei to get you some jaded skin ointment?” You’re not even sixty yet! The wrinkles on his face are already ...”

“I’m not using that!” Ling Xiaotian waved his hand and said,”I’m a man. Why do I need such good skin? I’m not a rabbit Lord!”

When Ling Qingxue heard this, she was stunned for a moment. Then, she looked at Xia ruofei and couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. Was this considered as getting shot? However, I was once a dark – skinned special Combat Elite! Now, having good skin was only a side effect of cultivation. Why did he become a rabbit Lord? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When du Qinghong heard the words “jaded skin cream”, he was in deep thought for a moment. It was only after Ling Xiaotian finished his sentence that he came back to his senses.

“Xiao Xia, so you’re the boss of the Paradise Corporation!” Du Qinghong said,”I was wondering why this name sounded familiar!”

“Uncle du, my business is just a small one. It can’t be compared to uncle Ling’s business ...” Xia ruofei said humbly.

“He’s been working hard for decades!” Du Qinghong said,”when you reach old Ling’s age, your career will definitely be bigger than his! Little Xia! I see that your forehead is full, your brow ridge is protruding, and your eyebrows are wide. This is the appearance of a great wealth!”

Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”Alright, alright!” Old man, don’t show off your skills in front of me ...”

It was not that Ling Xiaotian did not believe in du Qinghong’s fortune – telling skills. On the contrary, he was rather passionate about the metaphysics of Feng Shui. In fact, many rich people believed in this. Moreover, as an old friend of du Qinghong, his office was actually a Feng Shui Bureau set up by du Qinghong.

However, his relationship with du Qinghong was too good, so he spoke more casually and joked with each other.

As juniors, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue could not say much at this time.

“RUO Fei, are you here to look for Qingxue or me?” Ling Xiaotian asked.

Xia ruofei laughed,”both!” I wanted to discuss with you about the winery. Also ... I went out this time and got a good Jade ornament. I think it’s best to give it to you, so I brought it with me today!”

“Let’s talk about the winery later,” Ling Xiaotian said immediately.”Let’s take a look at the Jade ornament first!”

Based on Ling Xiaotian’s understanding of Xia ruofei, if even he felt that it was good, it must be very good. Thus, Ling Xiaotian could not wait.

Xia ruofei laughed as he took out the Jade carving of a Bell that he had carved with array patterns. The Jade carving was completely black and the craftsmanship was almost perfect. It looked very lifelike and was slightly smaller than an adult’s palm. It could be used as a decoration or carried around.

Ling Xiaotian could be considered to have seen many things, but this was the first time he had seen such a high quality black jadeite. Especially since the craftsmanship of the bell tripod was so outstanding, Ling Xiaotian’s eyes could not help but light up at first glance, revealing a deep fondness for it.

Du Qinghong was even more shocked. His eyes were wide open as he stared at the Jade carving of the bell in Xia ruofei’s hand. He could not help but tremble.

Ling Xiaotian also immediately sensed that something was wrong with du Qinghong and couldn’t help but ask with concern,””Old du, are you alright?”

Du Qinghong did not answer Ling Xiaotian’s question. He stared unblinkingly at the Jade carving of the bell in Xia ruofei’s hand and asked in a trembling voice,””Little Xia, where ... Where did you get this?”

When Ling Xiaotian heard the change in du Qinghong’s voice, he couldn’t help but feel nervous. He asked solemnly,””Old du, don’t scare me! Could it be ... There’s something wrong with this jade carving?”

Ling Xiaotian was well aware of du Qinghong’s level in metaphysics. He had personally witnessed some of du Qinghong’s achievements in the past few years. He knew very well that du Qinghong’s Feng Shui metaphysics was not as simple as feudal superstitions in the eyes of ordinary people.

Now that du Qinghong’s reaction was so abnormal, in addition to the fact that the bell was made of black jade and the carving was so vivid, Ling Xiaotian’s first reaction was whether there was something wrong with the Jade carving or whether it would bring bad luck or something.

Du Qinghong glared at Ling Xiaotian and said,””Problem? Old Ling, this is a rare magical weapon! I don’t know what kind of dog shit luck you have, you actually ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but let out a cry of surprise. She knew that Xia ruofei had made it himself, so how did it become a “magical weapon”?

However, Ling Qingxue felt Xia ruofei’s gentle squeeze on her soft hand at the first moment, so she immediately swallowed the words that were about to come out of her mouth. However, she still turned to look at Xia ruofei in shock.

Ling Xiaotian’s eyes widened when he heard this. He had originally thought that this was just an Emerald ornament made of precious materials and first – Class carving. He did not expect it to be a magic tool.

He knew very well that du Qinghong had a magic Jade gourd that he always carried with him and had shown it off in front of him more than once. The Jade gourd was only as thick as a finger and paled in comparison to the Jade carving of the bell tripod. Of course, he didn’t know that the value of magic artifacts couldn’t be measured by size.

“What’s going on?” Ling Xiaotian asked as he looked at Xia ruofei.

In fact, Xia ruofei was quite surprised. He was sure that du Qinghong had already seen the extraordinariness of the bell tripod jade carving, which surprised him.

Initially, Xia ruofei thought that if the array pattern could not be seen by the naked eye, no one would notice the extraordinary nature of the Jade carving. He did not expect du Qinghong to be able to see it with one look.

Xia ruofei was sure that there was no genuine Qi fluctuation in du Qinghong’s body.

There were only two possibilities. Either du Qinghong had never cultivated before, or his cultivation was much higher than Xia ruofei’s and he could perfectly conceal his cultivation in front of Xia ruofei.

The second possibility was almost impossible. In this spiritual Qi – less environment, unless du Qinghong had a more profound cultivation method than the great Dao Sutra and a large number of spiritual crystals, how could he have such a high cultivation?

Then there was only the first possibility.

Xia ruofei didn’t know what du Qinghong meant by “magical weapon”. To him, it was just the basic application of array skills. It was even easier than the array he made for Song Wei to suppress the peach blossom miasma.

“I’m not sure either!” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said,”I got it from a friend!”

Then, Xia ruofei turned to du Qinghong and asked,””Uncle du, what exactly is a ‘magic weapon’?”

Du Qinghong looked at the Jade statue with envy and said,””Xiao Xia, this jade carving of yours is made from the best quality black jade. This rare Jade is widely used in our industry to suppress evil. It’s carved in the image of Zhong Yuan, which means that the person who made this jade carving is also an expert ...”

Du Qinghong paused and said,””Most importantly, I can feel the special aura coming from this Jade statue. It’s obvious that it has been enhanced by an expert. Compared to ordinary black jadeite jade statues, its evil suppressing effect is several times stronger! In our industry, we call these things ‘magic tools’.”

Ling Qingxue was even more curious, and she couldn’t help but ask,””Uncle du, then ... The magic weapon must be very precious?”

“Of course, this can’t be measured with money!” Du Qinghong said without hesitation. Let’s put it this way! Old Ling, if you’re willing to transfer this magical weapon to me, I’m willing to pay 100 million! And I’ll transfer the money to you on the spot!”
