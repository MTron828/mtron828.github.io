Translator: 549690339

“But I’m sure a certain someone can feel my pain now ...” Feng Jing continued with a smile.

Xia ruofei said with a bitter face,”why do you think Mayor Jiang is praising me so much ...”

Feng Rao smiled, revealing her white and neat teeth.

She said,”this shows that you’re outstanding!” Mayor Jiang loves talented people!”

“But the rhythm isn’t right!” Xia ruofei said,”our press conference today is to promote the heart – nourishing soup! Sister ran, hurry up and look at the other websites. What are they writing about our heart nourishing soup? This bunch of uncrowned Kings were too hard to please! I’ve already spent a lot of money to give each of them a box of jaded skin ointment, and you still ...”

Feng Rao laughed and said,”I’ve just seen a few websites!” It was more or less the same! But there’s nothing wrong with him! The entire article is full of all kinds of fancy praises for you, and not a single media outlet is slandering you!”

“But I don’t want to be praised!” Xia ruofei sighed dejectedly. Is it so hard to be a quiet and handsome man?”

Plop ... Feng Rao was drinking from a bottle and spat the water out on the windshield when she heard Xia ruofei’s words.

She hurriedly pulled out a tissue to wipe her face and laughed so hard that she was out of breath.

After a while, Feng Rao said,””Ruofei, can I trouble you to tell a joke next time? please don’t tell it when I’m drinking water. You’ll die ...” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Xia ruofei was even more depressed,”I’m not that ugly, am I?” Look at how scared you are ...”

“You’re not ugly at all!”Feng Rao said with a smile. Alright? A quiet, handsome man?”

Along the way, Feng Jing spent most of her time scrolling through her phone, occasionally letting out a giggle.

Xia ruofei knew that she must have read some interesting comments, but he could only shake his head and smile bitterly.

After returning to the farm and dropping Feng Jing off at the complex, Xia ruofei immediately returned to the villa and turned on his computer in his room.

Feng Jing was not exaggerating. Xia ruofei flipped through many news articles and almost all of them mentioned him. The only difference was the length.

After all, as the Deputy Mayor, Jiang Liangyu’s speech still had a great influence.

Xia ruofei even saw a more in – depth report.

The so – called in – depth report was to dig into news events and find more material to make the report more complete.

The author of this report had actually managed to find the Resettlement Department for ex – soldiers in such a short time, hoping to get information about Xia ruofei’s military service.

However, Xia ruofei’s military service experience was highly confidential, so the reporters naturally did not get much information.

However, it wasn’t as if they didn’t get anything. At least, the reporter learned from the military personnel that Xia ruofei was a second – Class hero.

The reporter wrote in the report,”

As a former soldier who had served for two years, I know how difficult it is to obtain a second – Class merit in peaceful times. I dare to say that this handsome company president’s service experience is absolutely brilliant! Many people couldn’t see the darkness, because some people used their lives to block the darkness from you. How many people can’t see the flames of war and the smoke of gunpowder? the so – called peaceful years are just people carrying the burden for you ...

When Xia ruofei saw this, he could not help but feel a surge of emotions. It was as if he had returned to the hot – blooded military camp.

However, after a brief moment of excitement, Xia ruofei felt more helpless. There were even reporters digging up his military service experience. If this continued, wouldn’t he end up like Feng Jing? This was not the life he wanted!

Fortunately, it was mainly the local media that reported the news, and most of the posts were followed by local netizens, so the influence was still limited.

What Xia ruofei was most afraid of was that these reports would be posted on national forums or social media platforms such as Weibo. If they attracted the attention of netizens, his peaceful days would really come to an end.

“Mayor Jiang is truly a deception!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and muttered to himself,”I must make him drink a few big glasses this weekend! If we don ‘t, it won’t be enough for the people to be angry!”

Xia ruofei had no way to control the media’s reports. However, he knew that it was difficult for people’s attention to be focused on one point for a long time in the internet age. Even if such reports were spread to national platforms, as long as he kept a low profile for a while and did not make any more explosive news, the popularity would die down very quickly.

Of course, the news about the heart nourishing soup also attracted a lot of attention.

A doctor left a comment,”our hospital participated in the clinical trial of this new drug, and the efficacy is really good!” There was hope for the children of the stars!

Parents of children with autism left comments: “After reading this report, our family couldn’t help but feel excited. Now, we’re in a dilemma. We’re both happy and nervous. We’re happy because we finally see the hope of our child’s recovery, but we’re nervous because we’re afraid that it’s all for nothing. Over the years, we’ve experienced countless ups and downs like this. We’ve seen hope again and again, but we’ve seen hope being destroyed again and again. I sincerely pray that this time, we won’t be disillusioned again ...

A volunteer left a comment: “I’m a University volunteer. My job is to accompany autistic children to draw and sing. These children are really very cute!” Very smart! They just had social and emotional barriers, and they hoped that society would be more tolerant of these special children! Of course, I will also recommend this report to parents. If the report is true, it is undoubtedly a blessing for the majority of people with autism!

There were also many enthusiastic netizens who replied to the parents and volunteers of the children. Some of them were the parents of the children who had participated in the clinical trials, and some were hospital doctors who had participated in the clinical trials. These people’s replies were naturally to promote the heart – nourishing soup, hoping to dispel their doubts.

Xia ruofei read the comments for a while and felt a sense of achievement. This sense of achievement was much stronger than the tens of millions of dollars he had earned.

Even though many people were observing the heart – nourishing soup, including the parents of many patients, Xia ruofei knew that with the announcement of the new guiding drug use, the heart – nourishing soup would be officially introduced to major hospitals and become the first choice of medicine for doctors with autism. The parents ‘doubts would disappear after the first course of treatment produced significant results.

It was foreseeable that there would be a large wave of patients going to the hospital for treatment, and the demand for heart – nourishing soup would also rise.

It must be known that the proportion of people with autism was still very high, and most people paid attention to children under the age of ten. However, these children would grow up. In fact, many people with autism were already in their 20s or 30s, but due to serious social barriers, these people could only be raised at home by their parents after they became adults. They were unable to integrate into society or work normally. Once their parents grew old or passed away, these people’s twilight years would be very sad.

As more and more people knew about the heart – nourishing soup, these patients whose family members had basically given up on treatment would also go to the hospital for treatment.

At that time, the production of the heart nourishing soup would be put to the greatest test.

Xia ruofei estimated that it would be very fast. In three to five months, this peak would come.

Therefore, he also asked Xue Jinshan to quickly bring in the new production line. Even if he had to work overtime during the spring Festival, he wanted the new production line to be put into use as soon as possible.

The recruitment of new workers was also in progress, but there was a general shortage of workers before the Spring Festival. Now, they could only recruit as many as possible, and the number they recruited would undergo pre – Post training.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was the most assured about the raw materials because they had already started working with many villages and signed a package agreement with the farmers. The Taoyuan company would provide the seeds and seedlings, and the farmers would plant the medicinal herbs. They could only sell the seeds back to the Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory at the agreed price.

In addition, Xia ruofei’s herb garden in the spirit map space was constantly expanding. This herb garden was mainly used to grow the medicinal herbs needed for the heart – nourishing soup and jaded skin cream. By then, these high – Quality Chinese medicinal herbs would be able to provide an endless supply of raw materials for Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.
