Chapter 630: The brat is finally gone (3)

Xia ruofei’s face twitched and he forced a smile.””No, no! Huanhuan is a good girl ...”

If only she didn’t have those weird requests ... Xia ruofei added in his heart.

“Mom, I didn’t lie to you, did I?” Huan Huan said proudly. Brother ruofei praised me!”

Tian Huixin pinched Huan Huan’s face lovingly and said,””You did well!”

Tian Huixin’s gaze fell on Huan Huan’s head, and she said in surprise,””Little Xia, I didn’t expect you to comb a child’s hair! This ... Looks even better than my hair ...”

Lu You also lowered her head to look at Huanhuan’s hairstyle today. It was the kind where many small braids were woven together, and it was a relatively complicated combing method.

Lu You couldn’t help but laugh,”Xia ruofei, I couldn’t tell!” You still have this skill!”

Xia ruofei said awkwardly,”I’m not good at this. I asked Mr. Feng from my company to help me comb it ... I had no choice!” Her hair is not pretty, and she refuses to go out ...”

Tian Huixin and Lu You could not help but burst out laughing.

Tian Huixin continued,”let’s go, Huanhuan. Say goodbye to brother RUO Fei!” We’re going back to grandpa’s house!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Huan Huan pouted and said,”mom, I haven’t played enough yet!” The farm is really fun ...”

Lu You said,”but Grandpa and aunt both miss you!” Besides, you’ve been with brother ruofei for half a day. It’s time for you to spend some time with your sister and Grandpa, right? Huanhuan, let’s go home first! I’ll bring you over to play in two days ...”

Huan Huan tilted her head and thought for a while before she said,”Sister Youyou, why don’t you stay on the farm? This way, I can be with both big sister and big brother ruofei ...”

......

Lu You’s face was red. She glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””I don’t want to! Sister bought a lot of delicious food at home! If you don’t go back, I’m going to eat it myself!”

Tian Huixin also tried to persuade him and then turned to Xia ruofei for help.

Xia ruofei had no choice but to step out and say gently,””Huanhuan, you should go back with mom and sister! Come back in two days and I’ll take you to the beach, okay?”

After the three of them tried to persuade her, Huan Huan finally agreed reluctantly.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief and quickly went upstairs to put the clothes that Huan Huan had changed out of yesterday and the pajamas she had worn last night into bags. Then, he slipped downstairs.

When Lu You saw Xia ruofei’s impatient figure, she couldn’t help but find it funny.

Xia ruofei sent Huanhuan to her car and waved goodbye. He watched as the BMW MINI disappeared into the distance before he heaved a long sigh of relief.

The devilish child was truly a terrifying creature ...

After Huanhuan left, Xia ruofei finally had some free time to deal with his own matters.

He looked at his phone. It was not time for lunch yet, so he decided not to go to the cafeteria. He cooked some noodles in the villa and went upstairs.

Back in the bedroom, Xia ruofei locked all the doors and windows and drew the curtains tightly. Then, he took out the spirit painting scroll and entered the medium.

Xia ruofei couldn’t wait to brew the soup and consume it. He had a feeling that he would be able to unlock the next page after consuming the soup.

The spiritual puppet that he had been looking forward to was finally going to reveal its true appearance ...
