2983 Chapter 1631 – willing to bet, willing to lose (1)

Wu Ming’s expression was as if his father had just died, and he kept looking at Luo Feng.

He usually didn’t like Luo Feng. Even though the other party was an Aurous core stage cultivator, Luo Feng was basically Wu Tiancheng’s loyal servant in the Ling Jue mountain. Although Wu Ming called him “uncle Feng,” he didn’t have much respect for Luo Feng.

However, at this moment, Wu Ming was at his wit’s end and unconsciously treated Luo Feng as his backbone.

However, Luo Feng, his backbone, seemed to be absent – minded. Luo Feng ignored his several eye signals and stared straight at the simple handwritten copy on the coffee table. His gaze was also very strange. It seemed to have a feeling of joy at seeing a prey, but at the same time, it also seemed to carry some regret. There was even a hint of an unbearable itch in his heart.

This was the first time Wu Ming had seen the shrewd Luo Feng reveal such a complicated expression. Most of the time, Luo Feng did not show his emotions on his face.

Wu Ming saw that he couldn’t count on Luo Feng for the time being, and Liu Mansha’s speed of verification was getting faster and faster. The second volume of handwritten copies was thin, and seeing that more than half of it had been verified, he couldn’t help but feel a little anxious.

Just as Liu Mansha was about to flip a page of the star Seizer sect’s manuscript, Wu Ming finally couldn’t hold it in any longer. He shouted,””Valley master Liu, please wait!”

Liu Mansha stopped what she was doing and glanced at Wu Ming with slight displeasure. She asked,”What is it?”

Almost everyone in the cultivation world knew that Wu Ming was the darling of Wu Tiancheng and his wife. However, Liu Mansha looked down on this kind of second generation. With her status, she naturally did not need to be nice to Wu Ming.

“I’m not sure.” Wu Ming braced himself and said,”I see that Valley master Liu has already verified more than half of it. I’ve just observed it, and there are still some differences between the two handwritten copies ...” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“That’s because there’s a missing page in your manuscript!” Liu Mansha said bluntly,”in addition, fellow Daoist Xia’s handwritten copy is easier to read. Other than that, the contents are exactly the same!”

“Valley master Liu, I didn’t mean it that way ...” Wu Ming said awkwardly.

At this point, Wu Ming turned to look at Xia ruofei. He did not dare to act rashly in front of Liu Mansha. Besides, the bet was between the spirit Jade Mountain and the star Seizer sect. There was nothing much to say to Liu Mansha.

Xia ruofei met Wu Ming’s gaze and asked with a faint smile,””What does sect leader Wu mean? Are you trying to say that our “the true linglang Scripture” is fake?”

“I can’t tell if it’s true or not,” Wu Ming said with a dark face. However, our bet stated that the two handwritten copies had to be exactly the same, but it seems that the contents are not exactly the same!”

“Is this what you mean by going back on your word?” Xia ruofei asked with interest.

“How can you call that cheating?” Wu Ming argued,”I see that your handwritten copy is not much different from the original, so I naturally can’t say that yours is fake. But it’s a fact that it’s different from our manuscript! That’s why I want to say ... Why don’t we both take a step back and call off the bet!”

“No!” Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Liu Mansha and Luo Feng, who were beside him, spoke in unison.

Wu Ming wasn’t surprised that Liu Mansha had stood out to object. After all, Liu Mansha didn’t seem to like him from the very beginning.

However, what Wu Ming couldn’t believe was that Luo Feng had also expressed his opposition. Which side was this old man on?

Luo Feng blurted it out and only came back to his senses after he finished speaking.

When he saw Wu Ming’s expression turn extremely ugly, Luo Feng hurriedly transmitted his voice,””Young sect leader, please don’t mention that the bet is invalid. Don’t speak, just listen to me ...”

Although Wu Ming, this good – for – nothing, was already at the sixth Qi layer, he had taken countless pills and wasted countless cultivation resources. It could be said that the resources that Wu Tiancheng and his wife had spent on him, if used on the genius disciples of the spirit Vulture mountain, might be able to make the sect have another golden core stage. Although the probability was not high in the current environment, there was still hope.

With Wu Ming’s current cultivation and half – baked voice transmission skills, it was no different from speaking directly to Liu Mansha and Luo Qingfeng, who were golden core cultivators. Luo Feng couldn’t see through Xia ruofei’s cultivation and didn’t put Xia ruofei in the ranks of golden core cultivators for the time being. After all, a golden core cultivator in his twenties was a little too scary.

Thus, in order to prevent Wu Ming from being muddled, Luo Feng, who had recovered from his shock, also deliberately spoke faster,”Young sect leader, Liu Mansha and Luo Qingfeng are not fools, and Shao Qingyang was there as a witness. They know very well whether the contents of the two handwritten copies are the same or not. Moreover, we’ve already agreed that if the main contents of the two handwritten copies are the same, it can prove that there’s no problem with their handwritten copies. Now that you’re twisting your words and making unreasonable claims to void the bet, the star Seizer sect will never agree to it. Moreover, you’ve lost both the person and the array. Once this gets out, the reputation of the spirit Vulture mountain will be completely ruined!” If sect leader Wu knows about this, no matter how much he dotes on you, he will definitely punish you severely!”

When Wu Ming heard this, he couldn’t help but shiver.

His parents had doted on him since he was a child, but there were once or twice when he had caused too much trouble and he had been punished. When he thought of those two experiences, Wu Ming’s heart couldn’t help but beat like a drum.
