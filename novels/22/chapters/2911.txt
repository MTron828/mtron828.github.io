2912 Destruction – like rotten wood -

ERAD’s head tilted to one side after being slapped by Xia ruofei. Naturally, he was interrupted.

Of course, Xia ruofei had held back in this slap. Otherwise, irade’s head would have been smashed. However, this was only relative. In reality, this slap was even heavier than an ordinary person’s full – strength slap.

ERAD’s face swelled up at a speed visible to the naked eye, and even his molar was broken.

He felt his head buzzing, and stars appeared before his eyes. He was in a state of dizziness and couldn’t recover for a long time.

The politicians of kuachakuros, as well as Madel and the others, were all stunned. They couldn’t believe the scene in front of them. Who would have thought that someone would actually dare to beat the fierce God, irade, in his face? and today, they came to Huafeng shipping with a huge lineup from the Bay group. Not only were there officials on the stage, but there were also more than a dozen bodyguards escorting them. They didn’t expect these bodyguards to become decorations. The other party lightly came in front of irade and raised his hand to slap him ...

Zhang Chao was also stunned. He already knew that Xia ruofei was a very tough person, but he didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so good at fighting. The speed at which she jumped out just now showed that she was a martial arts practitioner, and one who was very skilled at it.

Of course, this was only Zhang Chao’s understanding. In fact, it was very difficult for ordinary people to reach this speed when practicing martial arts.

Of course, Xia ruofei didn’t use his full strength. He only relied on his body’s physical quality. He leaped forward with a stomp of his feet and his speed was already frighteningly fast.

After the slap, the entire courtyard fell silent.

Zhang Chao was the first to come back to his senses. He shouted,””Mr. Xia, come back!”

“Brothers!” Zhang Chao shouted,”get your weapons out here! We’ll fight them to the death today!”

Xia ruofei didn’t hold back at all. Zhang Chao realized that things would not end peacefully today. He wasn’t a coward and had made a decision in the shortest time possible. He would die Here today. However, no matter what, he had to protect Xia ruofei. At least, he had to get Xia ruofei and his companions out of here.

The Hong sect still had other forces in Mexico. As long as his men could escort Xia ruofei out of here, the Hong sect would have a way to send him back to the United States.

As long as she went back to the United States, she would be safe. Even now, Zhang Chao still thought that Xia ruofei had come from the United States.

Xia ruofei looked relaxed as he returned to Zhang Chao’s side. He smiled and said,””Brother Zhang Chao, I didn’t intend to get involved in this matter, but just because you said” F * ck his mother “! You’re a man! Then I can’t just ignore it ...”

Zhang Chao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He hurriedly said,””Mr. Xia, please take your companions and leave this place!”

Zhang Chao thought,”so this young master still thinks he’s in America!” You’ve never seen the cruelty of these drug lords. So what if you can fight? If they pulled out their guns without saying a word and more than a dozen bodyguards shot at them, you wouldn’t be able to withstand it even if you had a few lives!

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”calm down!” They’re just a few clowns, they can’t do much. ”

Zhang Chao was going crazy. He said in a hurry,””Mr. Xia! You must leave immediately! This man is an important leader of Mexico’s largest drug lord gang. Each of them is extremely evil, and they all have guns. You’ve completely angered them just now, and they’ll really kill you!”

Just as the two of them were talking, ERAD finally recovered. One of his cheeks was completely swollen, and his eyes had narrowed into a line. However, the killing intent in his eyes was so strong that it was almost tangible, making his swollen face look even more ferocious.

He roared,”are you all Blockheads?” Kill him!”

As a few of his teeth were broken, and his face was swollen, ERAD’s voice was a little funny, but the bodyguards didn’t find it funny at all. Each of their hearts trembled, feeling that a disaster was imminent.

Today was really strange!

Although they felt that the safety level in the yard of this Huaxia shipping company was very high, and they weren’t particularly careful, but more than a dozen of them were surrounding ERAD. Even if they were careless, it was impossible for them to directly rush in front of ERAD and give him a slap! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

With such a heavy blow, ERAD would definitely vent his anger on them! He might even kill a few of them to vent his anger when he returned. This was completely possible.

However, these bodyguards also knew that whether they could keep their lives or not would depend on their performance.

If they could quickly kill the young man in front of them, they might have a chance of survival.

The bodyguards shivered and took out their guns.

At this moment, ERAD shouted again,””Don’t kill him all at once! I want him to suffer! Break his limbs first, then slowly torture him!”

“Yes! Mr. ERAD!” The bodyguards responded in unison.

At this time, the people in Huafeng shipping company also heard Zhang Chao’s words and rushed out with their weapons.

However, the Hong sect couldn’t be compared to these drug lords, so they couldn’t prepare a large number of firearms. Xia ruofei’s firearms were handled by Zhang Chao alone. No one knew that there was a container of firearms in the warehouse. Even if they knew, the warehouse was so big and the container was quite far away, so they would not have time to retrieve it.
