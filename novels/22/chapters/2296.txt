2297 A little strange (1)

The ICU was located opposite the operating area, and there was an internal corridor that was connected to the operating area. This arrangement was also to allow critically ill patients to be transferred directly into a sterile environment.

Soon, the medical staff sent song Qiming to the ICU and settled him down.

Xia ruofei checked song Qiming again and found that he was still alive. However, he did not show any signs of waking up. His injuries would not worsen for the time being. Considering that Fang Liyun and Song Wei were still waiting anxiously outside, Xia ruofei decided to go out first.

He walked out and found professor Chen waiting for him at the exit of the intensive care unit.

When professor Chen saw Xia ruofei, he immediately walked up to him and said,””Mr. Xia, I’ve already informed the intensive care unit. You can ignore the visiting hours and visit Secretary song at any time.”

“Thank you, professor Chen!” Xia ruofei said sincerely.

Professor Chen hesitated and said,””But ... Mr. Xia, could you please follow the rules and disinfect yourself and change into sterile clothes the next time you enter the intensive care unit? After all, this entire area is a sterile environment, and there are other critically – ill patients inside ...”

Xia ruofei had entered the operating area without going through the disinfection process, which was already very difficult for the hospital. According to the regulations, the entire area had to be disinfected again, which increased the workload.

If Xia ruofei treated the intensive care unit like a vegetable garden and could come in and out as he pleased, the work here would be even more difficult.

Therefore, even though the head of the headquarters personally gave instructions and Dean Gao asked him to cooperate, professor Chen still tactfully made his own request. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei was not sure about song Qiming’s condition just now, so he was racing against time. He had even skipped the disinfection process and rushed in directly. Now that the most intense stage had passed, Xia ruofei naturally would not deliberately cause trouble for others.

So, he smiled and said,”no problem!” It was only right for him to follow the hospital’s rules. I was too anxious just now, please don’t take it to heart ...”

Professor Chen felt relieved and quickly said,””I’m fine! He was fine! Mr. Xia, Mrs. Song must be very anxious. Please go out and tell her the situation!”

In fact, during the transfer, professor Chen had checked song Qiming’s condition and found that he was still in a deep coma. The recovery of song Qiming’s brain injury could not be seen with the naked eye. Therefore, professor Chen did not know that Xia ruofei had almost cured the brain injury that they had just performed a simple hemostasis operation on in the operation in just ten to twenty minutes.

Because of this, professor Chen was still pessimistic about song Qiming’s feelings. However, now that Xia ruofei was involved, and it was a direct order from the higher – ups, he could only be patient and cooperate.

Although professor Chen was a bit of a scholar, a person who could become a major General in Civil Affairs was naturally not a pedantic person who only knew how to do business. Even if it was a waste of medical resources at this time, professor Chen would not jump out to object.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”thank you, professor Chen!” Then I’ll go out first!”

After that, Xia ruofei smiled at professor Chen and walked out of the intensive care unit.

Fang Liyun, Song Wei, and the rest were waiting anxiously in the hall outside. Most of their attention was focused on the operating room. They did not expect Xia ruofei to walk out from the intensive care unit.

Guangzhi Cao, song Qiming’s Secretary, was the first one to notice Xia ruofei. He quickly walked towards Xia ruofei and asked impatiently,””CEO Xia, how is Secretary song?”

Fang Liyun and Song Wei also turned around. The moment Song Wei saw Xia ruofei, her eyes were filled with hope. She asked nervously,””Ruofei, my father ...”

Xia ruofei gestured with both hands and said,””Don’t worry, everyone. Uncle song’s brain injury is quite serious, but I’ve basically controlled it ...”

Just as Fang Liyun, Song Wei, and the rest heaved a sigh of relief, Xia ruofei suddenly changed the topic.””But ... Uncle song is still in a deep coma. He should be able to wake up by now, but I can’t figure out the reason.”

Fang Liyun and Song Wei looked nervous again. However, Fang Liyun’s expression softened immediately. She said, “I’m fine ... I’m fine ... It’s better than not being able to save her ...”

The main thing was that professor Chen had given them a “heads – up” so that they could be mentally prepared. This way, Fang Liyun’s expectations were lowered by a lot. Now that Xia ruofei had said that his injuries were under control, even if he did not wake up, she felt that it was a good result.

“Yeah!” Song Wei also said. Mom! Father will wake up for sure, ruofei is here!”

“Ruofei, thank you for your hard work ...” Fang Liyun said with a tired face.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei looked at each other. Song Wei’s family did not know about their relationship. Song Qiming and Fang Liyun also knew that Xia ruofei’s girlfriend was Ling Qingxue. They even had a meal together before. Therefore, their relationship was a little delicate.
