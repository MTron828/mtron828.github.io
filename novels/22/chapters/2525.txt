2526 A world – shaking kick (1)

Markelka was stunned. He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to challenge him. His footwork was not bad, but he was not the first free kick player in the team. His strengths were that his defense was good and he had a strong view of the overall situation, so he could play the role of the manager in the middle and backfield. However, he was not best at free kicks.

Not to mention, Xia ruofei’s current position was so good that even some free – kick experts were not confident.

His teammates laughed when they saw that he was stunned. They then cheered for him to not be afraid and to fight bravely.

Even the manager, Ruby, said with a smile,””Rocca! You’re one of the fans ‘favorite young players. Although Mr. Xia is our boss, as a professional player, how can you cower in the face of a challenge from someone who has never played professional football?”

Melondo, who was about the same age as him and had also been trained by the Spanish, cheered for mark Rocca,””Rocca! There’s nothing that can stop you. Go and kill the boss, and you’ll be the hero!”

Markelka smiled wryly. He had no choice but to do it.

As a result, he could only brace himself and walk over. The players and managers naturally gathered around to watch the fun. Meanwhile, Zhou leiyun and Jiang Xiaochen were cheering for Xia ruofei.

Markelka asked cautiously,””Mr. Xia, how do you want to compete?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m fine with anything!” Why don’t we make it simple? we’ll just shoot at a fixed point and put a dummy at the goal. After all, there must be a goalkeeper guarding the goal in a real game!”

“No problem!” “But … We can’t decide the winner with one goal. We’ll each play 10 goals, and the one who scores the most wins. Is that okay?”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The reason why Mark Rocca suggested this rule was naturally to eliminate the influence of luck as much as possible. It was impossible for every kick to be so lucky that it would exceed the standard, right?

“I agree!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”since it’s a competition, we should have some stakes. If I lose, I’ll invite the entire first team, including the coach, the team doctor, the translator, and other staff, to the best restaurant in Barcelona for a big meal!”

The players, coaches, and staff all cheered when they heard that.

“Alright!” Markelka replied. If I lose, I will also …”

He had wanted to treat everyone to a big meal. He was now a first team star. Although treating the entire team to a big meal would hurt him a little, it was not impossible.

However, Xia ruofei waved his hand and interrupted him, saying,””If I’m lucky enough to win, you just have to promise me that you’ll have at least one assist in the next round of the league tournament. How about it?”

Magroca hesitated for a moment. In the next round, Espanyol would be challenging Valencia in an away game. They were a traditional strong team in La Liga. Although they might still be a little behind Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Atletico Madrid, they were a frequent European player and were much stronger than Espanyol.

In addition, the Spaniards were playing away, so it was not easy to score in this situation.

However, since he had already said so, he couldn’t back down. He hesitated for a moment before nodding.”No problem! If I can’t do it, I’ll treat the entire team to a big meal, two meals!”

Xia ruofei laughed heartily and high – fived markelka. They had reached an agreement.

The staff went to move a dummy and placed it in front of the goal. This way, the angle of the shot, which was not big to begin with, was even smaller now. If one wanted to directly shoot and hit the goal, they had to bypass the “goalkeeper” while bypassing the human wall. Moreover, at such a long distance, if the ball was not fast enough, even if it hit the range of the goal, it was very likely to be pounced by the goalkeeper in actual combat.

Everyone present was a professional player. It was certainly impossible to use a very low speed to improve the hit rate under the watchful eyes of the public, otherwise it would be a joke.

“Who’s first?” Xia ruofei stood in front of the soccer ball and said,”why don’t you go first?”

“Sure!” Said markelka.

Hence, Xia ruofei took a few steps back, while mark Roka stood in front of the football.

He first picked up the football, then stepped on the grass near the penalty spot, then squatted down and carefully placed the football on the penalty spot. After he placed it, he felt that it was not good, so he picked it up and adjusted the position.

In the process of moving the ball, magroka had to make several adjustments.

However, no one urged him, and no one was making a fuss now. Everyone was watching quietly.

After he set up the ball, he started to step back. It was normal for him to back off a long distance because the penalty spot was too far away from the goal. If he wanted the ball to have enough initial speed, he had to have a long enough running distance.

Mark Rocca finally stopped. He put his hands on his hips and looked at the goal in the distance. He looked like Ronaldo. After taking a deep breath, he started to run.

Mark Rocca’s speed was getting faster and faster. When he came in front of the football, one of his feet was firmly planted in the grass, while the other leg was swinging widely. There was only a bang, and the football was like a cannonball that was shot out of the barrel, flying in an arc in the direction of the goal.
