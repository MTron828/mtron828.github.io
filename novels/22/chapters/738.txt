Chapter 739: Rising to fame (3)

In the post, he also attached a few photos. The crystal clear, fresh, and tender purple – Red cherries looked extremely good, and the fresh, elegant, simple yet classy outer packaging was also taken a close – up by this netizen. The LOGO of Tao Yuan company was clearly visible.

This was a post on a relatively well – known Food Forum. Most of the people who frequented this forum were foodies, so the beautiful pictures that could arouse people’s original appetites immediately attracted a lot of netizens to watch, and there were many posts following them.

“Is it really that good? 300 yuan per kilogram is too expensive, right? It looked like a cherry from a domestic company! Even a lot of imported cherries can’t be sold for this price, right?”

“You get what you pay for. The Sam’s Club usually doesn’t set prices randomly.”

“Sam’s quality is still trustworthy!”

In addition to these discussions, there were also voices of doubt.

“The people upstairs are too naive! This op was obviously a supporter of that fruit company! He couldn’t even see through such a simple trick? Don’t we have a lot of such articles in this jar?” A netizen named “middle – aged old nationalistic youth” followed up. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hehe! This brother doesn’t look like he’s from the southeast. This paradise Corporation is very famous in our Southeast province! The organic vegetables of paradise brand have already gained a lot of fans here, and after eating it once, I guarantee that you will never forget it for the rest of your life. The price of these vegetables is also several times or even more than ten times that of ordinary vegetables, but everyone is still scrambling for it. Why would such a company need to hire an Internet Water Army to write an article?” A netizen with the ID “live up to food” immediately retorted the middle – aged old nationalistic youth.

“Is the person above the leader of the three mountains square? I’m also at San Shan. I was lucky enough to have tried the organic vegetables from Taoyuan at Ling Ji restaurant, and I can’t forget it. However, the price is really too unappealing, and the working class is afraid of it!”

The ‘middle – aged old nationalistic youth’ immediately replied,””Hehe, you still dare to say that you’re not a water Army? “Your division of labor is so clear. Some are using soft articles, some are following the post to create momentum, and some are even waving flags and shouting. I’ve seen this set of things many times. For an organized water Army like yours, the fees should not be low, right? This company is quite rich!”

The post by “middle – aged old nationalistic youth” immediately caused dissatisfaction among many people.

“Only delicious food can not be disappointed” was the first to post: “The ID above has already explained everything. I didn’t want to post anything, but I’ve been called a water Army of paradise Corporation. If I don’t say anything, people will think I’ve agreed! Speaking of which, I’ve been in this industry for six or seven years. Friends who are familiar with me can testify for me. When did I have to be a water Army to make a living?”

As soon as the post “food is worthy” was posted, many people immediately followed it. Moreover, the registration time and ID were not fake accounts. They were all real netizens who had been in the forum for a long time.

......

“Haha, the famous ‘President of the United States’ is actually being called a water Army? Which company can afford to hire a water Army like ‘President Mei’?”

“D * MN ... So’ President Mei ‘is a water Army? To think that I’ve read all of your recommendation posts! But I’ve tried a lot of the food recommended by ‘President Mei’. Why are they so delicious? Were there still such spammers? Give me a dozen!”

“Young man, it’s not good to be suspicious of everything!” President Mei is one of our senior forum members. You can go and look through her previous posts!”

In addition to the netizens who supported “food is worthy”, many netizens from the southeast province also stood up.

“The foodie who tasted paradise vegetables and was immediately turned into a fan has come to report! Only then did he know that the Paradise Corporation had also released fruits! Thank you for sharing, I’m going to head to Walmart immediately! By the way, I might also be a water Army!” A veteran forum member who had been registered for more than eight years and posted countless posts said.

“As a San Shan resident, I want to say that the products of Tao Yuan company are really good. I also saw the cherries sent by the OP in the supermarket, but I couldn’t bear to buy them because they were too expensive. I went for the second best and bought a box of Tao Yuan brand organic lychees. I just want to say that you get what you pay for, Yingluo! In the future, he would not be able to eat other lychees. Peach blossom company, I hate you!”

“Hehe, I’ll also share some news that everyone doesn’t know yet ... Isn’t the Drunken Eight Immortals wine, which everyone in the three mountains knows about, back on the market after some improvements? It even caused a frenzy to rush to buy it, and there was even a scalper party. Everyone should still remember, right? What I want to tell everyone is that after the reorganization of the winery that produces the Drunken Eight Immortals, the Paradise Corporation has become its major shareholder. So, strictly speaking, the Drunken Eight Immortals series of white wine is also a product of the Paradise Corporation!”

“My God! Last night, he had drunk eight Drunken Immortals at his friend’s house ... This company was just too awesome! Anything that comes out will be of high quality!”

“Hahaha! Then I’ll say one! I’m from the capital, and I bought a box of iron – skinned maple bucket from Tongren Hall some time ago. The price was really expensive! It’s ten times more expensive than the iron – skinned fengdou we bought before! However, the effect was really good. You really get what you pay for! After saying so much, everyone should have already guessed it, right? Yes! This tin can Kaede is from paradise, and the LOGO is exactly the same as the one on the photo box sent by the OP!”

“The Paradise Corporation is mighty!”

“66666666!”

“Brother Taoyuan, do your parents know that you’re so awesome?”

“I don’t think anyone will dare to mess with paradise Corporation anymore. This is the rhythm of being taught a lesson at any moment!”

“Young man, does your face hurt?”

“The person above isn’t kind, one shouldn’t tear down when one’s life is hard!”

At this time, a netizen named “homesickness” followed up with a photo. It was also the peach Garden brand organic cherries that the original poster had just posted. Next to it were Peach Garden brand organic lychees that had similar packaging.

The background of the photo looked like a very high – end premium fruit store, and this Paradise Fruit was placed on the most eye – catching shelf. The sign above even had a price tag. Organic lychees were “S$35”, and organic cherries were “S $98”.

Homesickness also posted a line of words below the photo: “I just bought this at the Hengfeng premium fruit chain. Oh, I’m in Singapore.”

As soon as this post came out, the netizens exploded. As a group of qualified foodies, they naturally knew about the high – end fruit chain store under Hengfeng. The entry threshold of this store was very high. The fruits sold in this store were all the best of the best. If the quality was slightly worse, they would be rejected. The fact that Taoyuan fruit could be sold here and occupy the most eye – catching shelf was already enough to explain the problem.

Some netizens checked the exchange rate carefully, and the final result was that the price of organic lychees in Singapore was equivalent to 170 Yuan per kilogram, and the price of organic cherries was equivalent to 480 Yuan per kilogram, which was much more expensive than the domestic price.

Basically, everyone no longer doubted the authenticity of this post and began to discuss the products of paradise Corporation enthusiastically. Meanwhile, the “middle – aged and old nationalistic youth” had disappeared without a trace and had not spoken for a long time.

More and more netizens who had bought Taoyuan organic fruits in the past two days came to leave messages, expressing their love for Taoyuan brand fruits.

Of course, there were still some voices of doubt and opposition, but they were quickly drowned out by the sea of praises.

Xia ruofei only saw the post two or three days later. By then, the post had already been recommended to the most prominent spot on the main page of the forum. There were more than 800 comments. There was even a moderator who bought a fruit of paradise and tried it himself. Then, he used his super administrator account to write a passage in the main post to rectify the name of paradise Corporation.

Its authority was unquestionable.

Xia ruofei laughed as he watched. The praises for the Paradise Corporation filled him with a sense of achievement.

Of course, there were many similar posts. On Tieba, forums, and Weibo, there were many discussions about Taoyuan fruit, but this post was more representative.

In fact, the peach blossom fruit had already set off a wave of discussion on the internet, and it was no less popular than the Drunken Eight Immortals white wine.

This time, Xia ruofei did not write a soft article, nor did he hire an Internet Water Army to top the post. It was entirely the spontaneous action of the netizens.

This meant that he had taken the right path to increase his popularity through products of excellent quality. This Paradise Fruit was now popular, and it had also driven the popularity of paradise company to rise!
