2007 Entering a no man’s land (1)

Monica held the pistol that still had Xia ruofei’s body temperature tightly. She looked nervously at the other side of the road through the bushes. She saw Xia ruofei lightly step on the wall of the rehabilitation Center and nimbly flip over it, disappearing into the night without a sound.

Monica couldn’t help but clench her hands and pray in her heart.

After Xia ruofei climbed over the wall, he immediately flashed into the shadows like a cat and then quickly ran in the direction of the hospital building.

The security in the rehabilitation Center was not strict. Xia ruofei did not deliberately avoid the surveillance cameras. He had already covered his face and changed his appearance. He did not care about being recorded by the surveillance cameras. The only thing he wanted was time, so he moved quickly.

There was an old man napping in the guardroom on the first floor of the hospital. Xia ruofei sneaked into the building without any effort.

He quickly looked left and right, then flashed into the stairwell and quickly climbed up the stairs.

According to Monica’s speed, if the Grao family did not change Rousey’s house arrest location, he should be in the ward on the east side of the sixth floor, and there were at least six to eight people taking turns to guard the door.

Xia ruofei sprinted at full speed and reached the sixth floor in no time.

He quietly pushed the door of the emergency exit open a crack, observed for a while, and then flashed into the corridor of the sixth floor.

The corridor was about 30 meters long. Xia ruofei came out from the westernmost side, and Rousey’s ward was separated from his by an entire corridor.

As soon as Xia ruofei came out, he saw four burly men sitting on the bench at the end of the corridor. The moment he appeared, the four men immediately looked over.

Xia ruofei did not hide. Instead, he quickened his pace and walked towards them.

One of the big men stood up vigilantly and asked,Who are you

Xia ruofei did not answer and continued to walk quickly towards them.

Stop! The burly man reached his hand into his waist.

Xia ruofei still did not say a word, but he had changed from walking quickly to jogging, and his speed had been increasing.

The other three men immediately stood up and took out their daggers at the same time. Then, they vigilantly faced Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s speed was getting faster and faster, and the distance of 30 meters was covered in an instant.

In the process of sprinting, Xia ruofei gradually lowered his center of gravity. Before the four men could get close to him, he used the inertia to slide and slide. The opposite side was instantly thrown off their feet.

Xia ruofei immediately straightened his body and knocked out the four men.

The entire process took less than five seconds, and it could be said that he had unleashed his speed to the extreme.

Xia ruofei did not stop and went straight to the ward.

As soon as the door opened, a gust of wind blew in.

Xia ruofei had already used his mental strength to check the situation in the room. There were two guards in the ward. They did not rush out immediately when they heard the commotion. Instead, they hid by the door and prepared to give the enemy a fatal blow. However, they did not know that with Xia ruofei’s mental strength, they had no way to hide their whereabouts.

Xia ruofei, who was already prepared, easily tilted his head and dodged the extremely fierce knife. Then, he took advantage of the opening in the middle of his opponent’s body and leaned his shoulder heavily on his chest.

The burly man suddenly felt as if he had been hit by a heavy truck. He flew out and fainted on the ground without a sound.

The other man was standing guard at the head of the bed. Seeing that Xia ruofei had defeated his companion so easily, he hurriedly placed the knife on Rousey’s neck and cried out in panic,Don’t come over! Otherwise, I’ll kill him immediately!

Xia ruofei had a relaxed smile on his face as he sized up Rousey on the bed with great interest. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The young man had blond hair and a sharp face. He was definitely a handsome young man. If it wasn’t for the fact that he had to sit in a wheelchair all year round because of polio, he would definitely have a lot of girlfriends.

He had been woken up by the sounds of fighting. Although there was a knife to his neck, he was not too nervous. Instead, he looked at Xia ruofei as if he was interested in this masked man who was not very strong.

Among the three of them, the burly man was the most nervous. His hand that was holding the knife was trembling.

Xia ruofei spoke in English,put the knife down and I won’t hit you. I just want to take Luo Si away ...

Don’t even think about it! The burly man said in a trembling voice.

The other party was not tall or strong, and his hands were not made of iron, but the burly man still felt a sense of fear from the bottom of his heart. The hand holding the knife could not help but tremble.

Xia ruofei looked at him and was really afraid that his hand would slip and cut off Rousey’s carotid artery. Besides, he did not want to delay too long, so he put away his teasing heart and rushed directly in the direction of the hospital bed.

Seeing this, the big man’s heart hardened, and he suddenly exerted force in his hand, wanting to kill Rousey first and burn both Jade and Jade.

However, he was shocked to find that it was as if he had been frozen. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t move the hand holding the knife.

Xia ruofei’s speed was very fast. In an instant, he was in front of the two men. He grabbed the burly man’s wrist and took the dagger. With the other hand, he chopped the burly man’s neck cleanly.

The burly man groaned and fell limply to the ground.
