Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and asked,””Mr. Tang, is the Phoebe zhennan wood from last time not enough?”

“Last time, it was mainly to make longevity materials!” Tang He said with a smile,”the wood is so beautiful, so I’m going to build a whole set of Phoebe zhennan furniture for my Manor in San Francisco. This is what I can enjoy when I’m alive!”

Tang He paused and continued,””The quality of the Phoebe zhennan wood from last time was too high. I don’t think anyone else can help me find it, so I’ll have to trouble you.”

Xia ruofei deliberately pondered for a while and said,””I’ll try my best, old Mr. Tang! I can’t be sure about this kind of thing, so I’ll immediately make arrangements and inform you as soon as I have news. ”

As time flowed 30 times faster, in addition to the dense spirit Qi in the space, the trees ‘growth rate was much faster than the outside world. Therefore, the first batch of Phoebe zhennan trees planted in the Archean realm all grew rapidly.

The last time Xia ruofei patrolled the Phoebe zhennan forest, he realized that the earliest batch of Phoebe zhennan had grown to more than 90 centimeters thick. The plants were originally sparse, but now they seemed to be a little crowded.

Tang He needed Phoebe zhennan wood, which was exactly what Xia ruofei wanted.

He could use this opportunity to clear out some space for those at the Archean realm.

“I’m glad to hear that from you. I believe you can help me find the wood that I like!”Tang He said happily.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’m not even sure myself. You’re so confident.”

Tang He couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Tang He then said,”by the way, Xia, you’ll definitely have to use funds overseas in the future. Now that you have a winery in Australia, I suggest you register an offshore company in Cayman Islands or the vigjin islands. Then, you can open an offshore bank account in Switzerland under the company’s name. The overseas business will be settled in foreign exchange. This way, you’ll be more flexible when you need to use funds in the future.”

“An offshore company?” Xia ruofei asked subconsciously.

Tang He explained with a smile,”to put it simply, an offshore company is a company that operates outside the company’s registered place. Like the Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands I just mentioned, they are famous offshore financial centers. These areas mostly retain the legal system and judicial system of the United Kingdom the company’s shareholder information and income are confidential, and they are completely tax – Free. Only annual management fees are collected. In short, it will be much more convenient to have an offshore company like this.”

Xia ruofei was very tempted after hearing this. He couldn’t help but ask,””Mr. Tang, is it complicated to register an offshore company?”

“It’s not complicated at all. You don’t even need to go there yourself. “Tang He laughed and said,” there are agencies all over the world that specialize in related business. How about this? I’ll ask the people in the Australian branch to help you with this. It’ll be done in a few days!”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said happily,”thank you!”

“You’re welcome, it’s a small matter!” Tang He laughed and said,”if you need money for the acquisition of your winery, I’ll ask the Australian branch to transfer it to Paradise Farm’s account first. How about this ... I think there will be some other taxes during the acquisition process. In addition, you will need a certain fee to register an offshore company. I’ll ask them to transfer three million Australian dollars directly!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei did not stand on ceremony with Tang He.”I’ll make use of the time to get the information you need from the Phoebe zhennan wood!”

“Hahaha! Alright, I’ll be waiting for your call!” Tang He said happily.

In the next few days, Xia ruofei mainly took Lin Qiao around the Hunter Valley area and did not go further. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In the process of acquiring West Winery, there were some documents that required his signature. The legal advisor of shengbang group’s Australia branch was also helping Xia ruofei register an offshore company in Cayman Islands and an overseas bank account. Some of the authorization documents also required his signature.

Hence, Xia ruofei had to make sure that they could find him at any time.

Fortunately, the Hunter Valley area was a tourist area in Australia. There were many activities to play, so Lin Qiao was not bored. On the contrary, she had fun every day.

After receiving Tang He’s order, the Australian branch of shengbang group had already transferred three million Australian dollars to Paradise Farm’s account.

The next step was to help Xia ruofei register an offshore company and open an overseas bank account in the company’s name.

Then, Paradise Farm transferred the money to Xia ruofei’s overseas account.

Finally, Xia ruofei’s offshore company would have a full ownership of West Farm. All future capital transactions would be completed through the offshore company’s overseas account.

Australia’s financial policy was relatively loose. Although the company’s account was registered in a Switzerland bank, the circulation of funds was still very convenient.

Besides signing some documents when necessary, Xia ruofei spent most of his time touring with Lin Qiao.

The hot air balloon tour had always been on Lin Qiao’s mind. On the second day after purchasing West Farm, Xia ruofei took her there to experience it.

The rich Xia ruofei even booked a hot air balloon. Besides the pilot, only he and Lin Qiao were there.

When the hot air balloon slowly rose into the air, Lin Qiao looked at the green land under her feet and the red sun that was slowly rising in the distance. She was so excited that her face turned red. She kept taking photos from all angles with her mobile phone, selfies, group photos, and scenery ... She had a lot of fun.

Besides the hot air balloon, Xia ruofei also brought Lin Qiao to the Hunter Valley Country Club to experience the golf course.

Under Liang Qichao’s recommendation, the two of them also participated in the horse – riding event. Lin Qiao trembled as she rode on the horse, screaming from time to time. In the end, she simply asked for a stronger horse and shared it with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei doted on Lin Qiao a lot and tried his best to satisfy all her requests.

With Xia ruofei’s help, Lin Qiao happily got on the tall horse. Xia ruofei also got on the horse and sat behind Lin Qiao. He held her waist tightly with one hand and held the reins with the other.

Xia ruofei started to regret it the moment he got on the horse because the position was too ambiguous.

Xia ruofei was tormented by the horse ride.

When they finally reached the finish line, Xia ruofei got off the horse as if he had been pardoned and helped Lin Qiao down.

Lin Qiao’s face was also slightly red. She quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and then looked away.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly to himself and didn’t dare to choose the horse – riding option anymore. He happened to see that there was a horse – riding option next to it, so he brought Lin Qiao over to pay and rent a carriage.

The two of them sat side by side in the open carriage, and the atmosphere was finally not as awkward as before.

The carriage’s route was longer. The two of them rode the carriage along the small path in the Hunter Valley. Along the way, the scenery of the valley was like a painting. The carriage also shuttled between the vineyard from time to time, giving it a different kind of exotic atmosphere.

Lin Qiao sat next to Xia ruofei. A trace of hazy affection gradually grew in her heart, but that trace of tenderness flashed in her eyes. Soon, she returned to her lively and chatty appearance. She took out her mobile phone and kept taking photos. Sometimes, she even posed for Xia ruofei to take selfies.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice Lin Qiao’s strange look, but he reminded himself to be careful. After all, Lin Qiao was a girl who was about to go to college. Physically, she was an adult. He had no blood relationship with her, so he couldn’t be too intimate.

Three days later, Xia ruofei brought Lin Qiao to almost all the fun activities in the Hunter Valley.

Some of the legal procedures for the registration of an offshore company and the merger and acquisition of West Winery had been completed.

Xia ruofei and the rest arrived at the West Winery. Under the witness of lawyer heinte, they completed a simple handover ceremony with the West couple.

From this moment on, legally speaking, the West Winery belonged to Xia ruofei.

Old West even accompanied Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao to the vineyard of the winery for a walk. The last time Xia ruofei came, he was bringing guests for a visit. This time, the meaning was different. It was a boss inspection.

The 10 – hectare vineyard was not on the same level as Paradise Farm, but it was still very vast when they arrived at the scene.

Xia ruofei stood on a small hill and looked at the vineyard looming between the hills. It was surrounded by beautiful blue flowers and roses. Occasionally, he could even see wild kangaroos jumping between the grape racks. Thinking that all of this now belonged to him, he could not help but feel a little high – spirited.

“Boss, do you have any new instructions for the future operation of the winery?” Old West got into character quickly and asked.

“Uncle Carter,” Xia ruofei said,”the winery’s operations will naturally be led by you. However, I hope that in the future, our winery will slowly turn to selling Semillon wine.”
