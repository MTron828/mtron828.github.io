2071 Rapid recovery_3

“Okay, thank you, Mr. Xia!” Rousey said.

Before Xia ruofei left, she winked at Monica with her back facing Rousey. Monica naturally understood and gave a small nod.

After Xia ruofei left Rousey’s room, Monica also found an excuse and left.

Rousey watched Monica’s back disappear from the door in a hurry and couldn’t help but Mutter to himself,””You’re going to review documents at this time? This excuse was too clumsy! I’m not a kid anymore ... But, it seems like it’s not a bad thing for this Mr. Xia to be my brother – in – Law?”

Rousey then pressed the bell on the bed and called out,””Anna! Come over and help me wash off the ointment. I’m going to sleep ...”

Upstairs, in Xia ruofei’s guest room, it was naturally filled with the smell of spring again ...

For the next three days, Xia ruofei treated Rousey once a day.

He still used the combination of acupuncture, massage, and external application of ointment.

Every time he massaged Rousey, he would be in so much pain that he would sweat.

As time went on, Rossi’s leg recovered better and his pain nerves became more and more sensitive, so each treatment was more painful than the last.

However, Rousey gritted his teeth and endured it every time. Other than the first time when he was not mentally prepared, he did not even make a sound the other times.

Xia ruofei had chosen this treatment method because, on one hand, it was indeed of great help to the recovery of the nerves in Rossi’s legs. On the other hand, he wanted to train Rossi’s willpower.

It turned out that Rousey’s will was really tough.

On the last day, Xia ruofei applied the rest of the ointment on Rousey’s calf.

Then, he smiled and said,”today is the last treatment. Monica, you can get the physical therapist you’ve contacted to come over tomorrow. First, give Rousey a comprehensive examination. Then, we can formulate a recovery plan.” I’m not as good as those professional rehabilitation trainers, so I’ll leave it to them!”

“Alright!” Monica nodded.

Xia ruofei glanced at Rousey’s leg and felt a sense of accomplishment.

A few days ago, his legs were seriously deformed, forming an ugly O – shape. After a few days of treatment, other than muscle atrophy, which made his legs look thinner than normal, there was basically no sign of any abnormality.

Xia ruofei had used his spiritual power to check and knew that the nerves in Rossi’s legs had recovered. The treatment could be said to be very successful.

What was even more valuable was that this time, he didn’t completely rely on the petals of the spirit Heart Flower to complete the healing.

Xia ruofei was very clear that if it was just a single spirit Heart Flower petal, with the severity of Luo SI’s leg disease, it would be impossible for her to recover to this extent.

It could be said that his acupuncture and massage, as well as the muscle and bone – strengthening ointment itself, played a pivotal role in this treatment.

Rousey felt like he had been in a beautiful dream for the past few days. He could feel better every day, and the feeling was wonderful.

His admiration for Xia ruofei grew day by day.

Therefore, Rossi could not help but say,”Mr. Xia, I still hope that you can come and help me with my rehabilitation training.” I only believe in your medical skills now!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Thank you very much for your trust. But ... Rossi, every field has its own specialty. In terms of muscle recovery training, those professional rehabilitation trainers will definitely do better than me.” You’ll recover faster if you train with them, understand?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but add,””This is also one of my medical advice. Do you remember it?”

Rousey then nodded and said,”alright!” I’ll listen to you!”

“Yeah,” Xia ruofei nodded,”I’m going to return to China after I’m done with the rehabilitation trainer. Rousey, I’ll be waiting for your good news in China. You’re also welcome to come to China to play at any time after your recovery!”
