3077 Test?_

At this time, the figure wearing a moon – White long robe on the steps let out a hearty laugh.

Then, Xia ruofei saw him stand up from his seat and walk down the steps with an interested look on his face. He walked to Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan.

Xia ruofei realized that he could already see Chen Nanfeng’s face clearly.

Chen Nanfeng’s appearance was still very handsome, and he looked quite handsome in his long robe. His hair was black, and there was not a single wrinkle on his forehead and face. His skin looked extremely smooth and elastic. Judging from his appearance, he was at most thirty or forty years old.

If he had not known about this beforehand, Xia ruofei would never have believed that this was Chen Xuan’s father.

It was said that Chen Nanfeng had a son at an old age, and his real age was already two to three hundred years old.

One could tell that Chen Xuan and Chen Nanfeng shared many similarities. The two of them stood together like brothers.

The only thing that Xia ruofei felt was out of the ordinary was probably Chen Nanfeng’s eyes.

Chen Nanfeng’s eyes weren’t particularly big, but they were very lively, as if they were emitting a mysterious light that made people involuntarily sink into them.

Xia ruofei knew that this was a sign of Chen Nanfeng’s extremely high spiritual cultivation.

“Little friend Xia, Xuan ‘er told me everything about the auction when she came back. Thank you so much!” Chen Nanfeng said with a smile.

“Sect leader Chen is too polite!” Xia ruofei bowed slightly and said,”I’m just lending some spiritual stones to brother Chen in case of an emergency. It’s not a big deal. It’s just a small matter. Sect leader Chen, you don’t have to worry about it!”

“It’s nothing,” Chen Nanfeng said with a wave of his hand.”It’s nothing during normal times, but if it weren’t for the batch of spirit stones that little friend Xia provided us with during the auction, we would’ve missed the opportunity to obtain the five Saints badge. As the saying goes, it’s easy to add flowers to a brocade, but it’s difficult to send charcoal in the snow. I, Chen, and the entire first heavenly sect will never forget this favor from little friend Xia!”

“You’re being too serious. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He didn’t continue on this topic. No matter if the other party was sincere in thanking him or just being polite, it didn’t matter. He wasn’t so na?ve as to think that he had really become the first heaven society’s distinguished guest or benefactor. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I heard from Xuan ‘er that little friend Xia is very interested in our wild tea?” Chen Nanfeng asked with a gentle smile on his face.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”last time, it was all thanks to brother Cheng. I was lucky enough to taste wild tea. I was instantly shocked.” Although brother Chen has said that your sect and some other seniors in the cultivation world have tried many times in the past, hoping to breed wild tea by cutting, but none of them have succeeded, I still want to try my luck. I hope sect leader Chen can grant me my wish!”

“No problem!” Chen Nanfeng said readily,”one or two branches are nothing. Little friend Xia can go and get them at any time!”

“Then I really have to thank sect leader Chen!” Xia ruofei quickly bowed and said.

“You’re welcome,” Chen Nanfeng smiled and said,”in your words, this is as easy as lifting a finger for the first heaven society.”

Then, Chen Nanfeng casually asked,””By the way, little friend Xia, did your master give you any special instructions for your cultivation this time?”

Xia ruofei’s expression remained the same, but his eyes revealed a trace of embarrassment.””Sect leader Chen ... My master has repeatedly warned me not to reveal any information about him while I’m cultivating outside. I hope sect leader Chen can forgive me.”

“It’s fine, it’s fine!”Chen Nanfeng laughed. This is understandable ... Some reclusive seniors and experts don’t want us to disturb their peace, so when some of their disciples enter the world to cultivate, they are very low – Key and never mention their sect. ”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He had obtained a piece of information from Chen Nanfeng’s words. It was possible that there were hidden nascent soul cultivators in this world, and their disciples had once entered the world to cultivate. It was very likely that Chen Nanfeng had come into contact with the disciples of these hidden experts.

Xia ruofei knew that being a “nascent soul’s disciple” was a huge act, but what about the disciples of the reclusive cultivators that Chen Nanfeng might have come into contact with? Was he a true Yuanying stage disciple, or was he just a swindler?

He thought of Chen Nanfeng’s cultivation, especially his spiritual power, which even he was slightly afraid of. He felt that the possibility of Chen Nanfeng being deceived was not high.

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei’s interest in the true reclusive cultivators grew.

In recent years, no Yuanying stage cultivator had appeared in the cultivation world, especially more than 300 years ago. The cultivation world seemed to have been cut by a knife. Cultivators above the Yuanying stage disappeared overnight, and then the environment continued to deteriorate.

What was the secret behind this?

Presumably, those hidden Yuanying cultivators should know something.

Even Chen Nanfeng, the leader of a top sect, probably had some information.

Although Xia ruofei was very curious, he did not dare to ask.

He didn’t know if those reclusive nascent soul cultivators were connected to each other, and he didn’t know if there was a special connection between those “nascent soul disciples.” He knew nothing about all this. If he rashly asked and said anything wrong, it would immediately arouse Chen Nanfeng’s suspicion.

If Chen Nanfeng found out that Xia ruofei actually did not have a nascent soul cultivator as a master and was just an itinerant cultivator who had obtained a great opportunity, it was hard to guarantee that he would not covet the treasures on him.
