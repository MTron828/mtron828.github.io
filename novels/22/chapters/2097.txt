2098 Father – in – Law -2

This was equivalent to changing the original layout from a flat surface to a three – dimensional space. This way, the capacity would be increased many times, and the space would no longer be limited.

After all, the Drunken Eight Immortals wine only needed to be placed in a spatial dimension, and then cast a magic with time and spiritual energy to turn it into an unparalleled wine. It was unlike other crops, which could not be separated from the soil of the Archean realm. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

When Ling Xiaotian saw Xia ruofei nod in agreement, he could not help but be overjoyed. He quickly asked,””Ruofei, to what extent do you think it can be expanded?”

Xia ruofei said straightforwardly,”if the winery can produce it, then we’ll double it!” Starting from next month, send me 200 tons of one month, six tons of three months, two tons of five months, and 1000 pounds of one year’s raw wine every month. ”

Ling Xiaotian was both surprised and happy. He had expected the production to increase by 20 to 30 percent. After all, he had mentioned expanding the production before, but Xia ruofei had rejected him with all sorts of reasons. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so straightforward this time, directly promising to double the production.

“No problem!” Ling Xiaotian quickly replied. The winery’s production capacity has always been a little over, so there’s a lot of raw wine in stock. There’s no problem supplying you for the first few months. “If we’re going to have a long – term supply in the future, we’ll have to expand the production line. This work has to be arranged in advance so that we won’t be out of stock ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” Uncle Ling, you can arrange it. I said before that I won’t participate in the specific operation and management of the winery. I’ll be responsible for the processing of the raw wine and the dividends ... By the way, it’s going to cost a lot of money to introduce a new production line, right? Uncle Ling, if you want to spend money, let’s just invest in proportion!”

Ling Xiaotian waved his hand and said,”no need, no need!” The winery hadn’t received any dividends for a long time, so there was plenty of money in its book now. It was more than enough to build a new factory and introduce new production lines! Ruofei, you don’t have to worry about this. I’ll arrange for my men to complete it as soon as possible!”

“Okay!” Xia ruofei nodded.

After talking about the winery, Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei started talking about paradise Corporation. He was a very successful entrepreneur and naturally had his own unique views on running a company. Xia ruofei also benefited a lot from talking to him.

When Xia ruofei mentioned that Feng Jing had been urging him to show off more in the new media and had even urged him to participate in reality shows like “the life I yearn for”, Ling Xiaotian expressed his full approval.

Although Ling Xiaotian was an entrepreneur of the older generation, he did not reject new technology and new ideas. Ling Ji F & B was also one of the first F & B enterprises to implement online food ordering. After the emergence of take – out platforms, Ling Ji F & B was also the first to enter.

He also knew that Xia ruofei was very popular on the internet because of the forced surrender of Macau airlines. To him, this was a precious resource. In fact, many founders of internet companies were also internet celebrities. Xia ruofei could use this popularity to promote the development of the company.

After chatting for a while, Ling Xiaotian said with a smile,””Oh right, ruofei, I heard from Qingxue that you’re planning to buy a villa in this district?”

“Yup!” Xia ruofei said,”after the company’s headquarters moved to the city, I felt that it was somewhat inconvenient to live on the farm, so I wanted to buy a house in the city. The area you’re living in is in a good location and the environment is quite good. If there’s a suitable house, it’s not a bad idea to buy one!”

“Alright!” Ling Xiaotian happily replied. We’ll be neighbors then! When this community was first developed, I was very optimistic about it. At that time, the opening price was several times higher than the average price in the city. Many people were waiting to see, so I bought this villa directly. Now, the price has multiplied several times!”

“Uncle Ling’s vision is naturally good!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”even if I wanted to buy it, I didn’t have that much money! I can only buy it at a high price now ...”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled.”If I buy it, I don’t have to worry about the rise and fall of the house price. The real estate market is not doing well now. It’s a good time to buy it!”

Then, Ling Xiaotian continued,”I have an old friend who owns a villa in this district. Because he’s from Heron Island, he doesn’t really live in the house here. Now that he needs cash for his business, he intends to cash out the property here. I’ll help you contact him later. His villa is quite good!”

Ling Qingxue, who was brewing tea at the side, could not help but ask,””Dad, are you talking about uncle Jiang? He’s selling his house?”

“Yup!” Ling Xiaotian said,”recently, his company is preparing for a new project, but there is a slight shortage of funds. So, not only the villa in our neighborhood, he is also planning to sell a few shops near the East Street entrance!”

“Really!” Ling Qingxue said,”ruofei, uncle Jiang’s house is very good! The location is even better than our house. It’s right beside Min River and the area is much larger than our house. The key is that the developer even gave us a huge garden and a private beach. I’ll Take You There tomorrow. You’ll definitely like it!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingxue, I’m already very tempted just by hearing what you said!” I think you have the potential to be a real estate agent!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I’m telling the truth!” They were unlike those real estate salesmen who had a glib tongue and could even say that the dead were alive! I’m different from them, okay?”

Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but burst out laughing when he saw the two of them bickering.

He said,”ruofei, I’ll contact old Jiang later. He has a set of keys with the property management. I’ll get Qingxue to take you to see it tomorrow. If you’re satisfied, I’ll get him to give you a better discount!”

“Alright! Thank you, uncle Ling!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, Xia ruofei thought of looking for a house for Feng Jing, so he said,””By the way, uncle Ling, our company’s President Feng also wants to buy a house in this community. Can you help me pay attention to the sales information of the second – hand houses here? After all, you’ve lived here for so long, you should know which houses are better!”

“Boss Feng, do you want to buy a set too?” Ling Xiaotian couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment before saying,””Old Jiang has a smaller villa, but it hasn’t been renovated yet. This time, he’s planning to sell the one he used to live in when he was on vacation. After all, the price of a small villa is much lower, and he’ll have to raise a lot of money ...”

“Does he sell the smaller one?” Xia ruofei asked quickly.

“I’m not too sure about that. ” Ling Xiaotian said,”I remember that he said that he wanted to keep the small one and find time to renovate it so that he can have a place to stay in the three mountains when he’s old ... How about this? I’ll talk to him again and try to get him to sell the two sets at the same time!”

“Alright! You can ask him if he’s willing!” Xia ruofei said,”if you really can’t do it, then forget it. Qingxue said that there are many rough villas in the community that are ready for sale!”

“Alright, I’ll try my best to convince him!” Ling Xiaotian said.

At this time, the housekeeper, aunt Liu, walked into the living room and said,””Mr. Ling, dinner is ready. Would you like to have dinner now or ...?”

“Ruofei, why don’t we go eat?” Ling Xiaotian asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” Let’s talk while we eat!”

“Hahaha! It’s to drink and chat!” Ling Xiaotian said,”you haven’t been here for a long time. Let’s have a few drinks today!”

“Alright! Then let’s drink and chat!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The group of them arrived at the dining room of the villa. Ling Xiaotian opened one of the two bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals that Xia ruofei had brought and said,””Ruofei, let’s have a taste of your good wine today!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. He took it out and looked at the caller ID. It was Qin Lan from the Yacht Club.
