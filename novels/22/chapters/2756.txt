2757 A simplified version of the formation plate (1)

Although he didn’t know how much the storage ring would be sold for, Xia ruofei still had a lot of spiritual crystals. He also had origin crystals that were much more precious than spiritual crystals. No matter what, he should have the capital to compete at the auction.

Of course, Xia ruofei wanted to attend the auction not only for the storage ring, but also to experience the auction event of the cultivation world. At the same time, it was a good opportunity to learn more about the situation in the cultivation world.

In the past, Xia ruofei had always been very cautious when it came to matters related to the cultivation world. Now that he had a cultivation sect under his control and had a golden core cultivator like Luo Qingfeng as his assistant, he finally had some confidence.

Although this kind of strength was not the top in the cultivation world, at least ordinary forces would not come to provoke them for no reason, so the possibility of an accident was not high.

Luo Qingfeng and the others had left the Peach Blossom Island. Even Zheng Yongshou had left with them, mainly to send off Luo Qingfeng. Although the two of them were now Xia ruofei’s servants, their Master – disciple relationship would not change. Xia ruofei would naturally not reject such a request.

Li Yifu had also gone to evatz Island to pick up Liu An and the rest of the crew, so Xia ruofei was left alone on Paradise Island.

He walked around the island and checked the operation of the Taixu xuanqing formation.

After two adjustments, the formation had reached its current best state.

Although the array had suffered some damage when they were trying to capture Luo Qingfeng last night, it was not the foundation of the array. It was just a partial collapse due to the lack of spirit Qi. After one night, the array had been completely repaired.

Peach Blossom Island wasn’t big and Xia ruofei was very fast. It didn’t take long for him to make a round of the entire Island.

He simply found a rock facing the sea and sat down cross – legged, starting to practice the ‘great Dao formula’.

Now, Xia ruofei’s enthusiasm for cultivation had clearly increased because he could see the results every time he cultivated. The only difference was the magnitude of the effect. There was no bottleneck at all.

As the cultivation progressed, the genuine Qi in Xia ruofei’s dantian slowly turned into Yuan Qi. Although the speed was not fast, it continued.

Of course, the so – called slow speed was only Xia ruofei’s own feeling. If Luo Qingfeng knew about his cultivation speed, he would definitely take a deep breath.

It was not until noon when a fishing boat appeared in the distance that Xia ruofei stopped and got up.

After a short while, the fishing boat had already docked at the dock of Peach Garden Island.

It was Li Yifu and Zheng Yongshou, who had brought Liu Anji and benilatti back to Paradise Island.

Li Yifu asked the crew to go back to their rooms to rest, then he brought Zheng Yongshou and benilatti to Xia ruofei’s room.

“Senior granduncle!”

“Master!”

The three of them greeted Xia ruofei respectfully.

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”have Qingfeng and wangboshan left?”

“Yes, I dropped them off at the airport before coming back.” Zheng Yongshou quickly replied.

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’m going back to China tomorrow. After I leave, my foster husband will be in charge of this place. All of you must obey his orders! Do you understand?”

“Yes! Master!” Zheng Yongshou and bainilatti responded in unison.

Xia ruofei continued.”My adopted husband’s knowledge of arrays is still lacking. Yongshou, you have to help him control the array as soon as possible.”

When Zheng Yongshou heard this, he realized that Xia ruofei actually wanted Li Yifu to control the Taixu xuanqing formation. He quickly said,””Yes! Master, I will spare no effort to assist senior li! However, this subordinate’s array Dao level is only average. I’m afraid ...”

Zheng Yongshou didn’t know how to address Li Yifu. In the end, considering Li Yifu’s age, he vaguely called him senior. In fact, Li Yifu’s cultivation was far worse than his.

Initially, Zheng Yongshou was very confident in his array skills. However, when he had fallen into the Taixu xuanqing formation, he had not been able to resist at all. The illusory formation had directly broken through his heart. Xia ruofei had effortlessly planted a soul seal in his sea of consciousness, which had dealt a heavy blow to his confidence.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I don’t expect you to be of much help. You just need to tutor your adopted husband in the basic knowledge of arrays.”

“No problem!” Zheng Yongshou quickly said.

“You guys can leave first!” Xia ruofei said,”I have something to tell my adopted husband.”

“Yes! Master, your subordinate will take his leave!” Zheng Yongshou quickly said and left the room with beniladi.

Li Yifu waited for the two of them to leave before he said with a hint of worry,””Senior granduncle, this disciple’s skill is limited. I’m afraid that controlling the formation is beyond my ability.”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you don’t have to think about this problem. I’ll naturally solve it.” You don’t need to understand too many array Dao principles. You just need to master a few spiritual power techniques. If you encounter any danger that you can’t resist, just activate the formation at full power and ask for my help at once. Under normal circumstances, unless a nascent soul old monster comes in person, the formation won’t be broken in a short time. ”

The reason why it was difficult to capture Luo Qingfeng was that the array had just been activated, and the spirit Qi was not sufficient. The most important reason was that Xia ruofei wanted to capture Luo Qingfeng alive and not give him a chance to escape. He had placed him inside the array. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

If the formation was only used to defend against external enemies, the Taixu xuanqing formation would cover the entire Peach Blossom Island and form a tough protective shield. It would be extremely difficult to attack from the outside.

“Yes, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said without much confidence.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Alright, let’s put this matter aside. I have something else to discuss with you.”

“Grand uncle – Master, please give me your orders!” Li Yifu quickly replied.

Xia ruofei picked up the blueprint that he had marked in the early hours of the morning and handed it to Li Yifu.””I’ve marked out some areas here. Arrange for people to isolate these areas for the next few days. In the future, when the island’s manpower is gradually replenished, ordinary staff are forbidden from entering these areas. Some of the offensive arrays of the great array will be set up in these areas, so it will be very dangerous to enter. ”

Formations like killing formations and bewildering formations also had to absorb spiritual Qi at all times to increase their power, so it was best to keep them in operation at all times. This way, they could be used at any time when there was danger. Thus, it was very necessary to draw out a restricted area.

“Alright!” Li Yifu nodded and said,”I’ll get it done immediately!”

Xia ruofei said,”there’s no need to keep this kind of project confidential. It’s just to install some barbed wire, power grid, warning signs, and so on. There’s no need to waste so much time. Just ask bainilatti to recruit some workers from the state of ponaattu. There are still some building materials left on the island. Once the workers are in place, we can start work.”

The reason why Xia ruofei still kept bainilatti was that he considered that it would be much more convenient to have a completely reliable local.

Besides, benilatti did not commit any evil deeds. The only thing he did was that he was too greedy and had no bottom line. However, after being implanted with the soul seal, this weakness was gone. No matter how greedy he was, he would never betray Xia ruofei.

If he forcefully removed the soul seal, there was a certain probability of death. Even if he was lucky enough to survive, his sea of consciousness might be damaged and he would become an idiot. Hence, Xia ruofei did not want to do this unless it was necessary.

“Understood!” Li Yifu said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”go and arrange this.” I’m just about to refine a magic tool to control the great formation, so if there’s nothing special, don’t let anyone disturb me. ”

“Yes, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu said respectfully,”this disciple will take his leave!”

After Li Yifu left, Xia ruofei went straight to his bedroom and took out a Jade plate from the spirit map space.

There were a lot of surplus materials among the materials that Li Yifu had transported over using the transport plane. This Jade plate was the leftover from that time. It was about the size of two palms. According to Xia ruofei’s request, it had been cut into an octagonal shape.

Xia ruofei first adjusted his state of mind before he started to draw on the Jade plate.

The core of the array was fixed in the cement room on the west side of the island. Xia ruofei was making a simplified version of the array board that he could carry with him. He could connect with the fixed core array board and control the array.

...

Most importantly, this simplified version of the small array disc could simplify the control process. One only needed to master simple spiritual power techniques to be able to send out simple commands such as opening, closing, and moving.

This was similar to the difference between machine language, assembly language, and advanced language in a computer. It was the lowest level of machine language if one did not use the core array disc to communicate and transfer the array. Even Xia ruofei could not do this. Using the core disk array was equivalent to using assembly language. Although it was much simpler than machine language, it also required a certain amount of storage. Through this simplified version of the small array board, it was similar to the high – Level language in the computer. Even if one did not have any Foundation, they could still achieve control of the array.

The creation of this small array disc was not too complicated. Xia ruofei had obtained the complete set of methods from the Jade talisman of inheritance. The array patterns were much simpler than the core array disc. With Xia ruofei’s current level, he could inscribe it with his hands.

Xia ruofei spent almost an hour and successfully completed the simplified version of the small array disc.

He tried to input his mental power into this simplified version of the array disc, and the experiment was very successful. He did not need to directly contact the core array disc to control the Taixu xuanqing formation.

Of course, this method could only be used for simple control. It was not as flexible as directly connecting to the core array disc.

However, for Li Yifu, it was enough. With these functions, it was enough to ensure the safety of the Paradise Island. No matter how complicated it was, he couldn’t control it.

Xia ruofei kept the simplified array disc and called Li Yifu to come to his room immediately.
