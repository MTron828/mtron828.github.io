43  Qingxue's troubles (1)

    The two of them walked into the villa together. Ling Qingxue seemed to have forgotten about the unhappiness caused by he Dong earlier. She was admiring the villa as she looked around, very envious of Xia ruofei's living environment.

  Xia ruofei couldn't help but find it funny and asked,"

  "Can you not be so exaggerated! You're the little princess of lingji F & B, what villa can't you afford to live in? What's a small holiday villa like this?"

  Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,"

  "What do you know? I'm envious of your freedom! Living alone in a house facing the sea, doing whatever you want, without any restrictions ..."

  Ling Qingxue's tone seemed to have dropped a little.

  Xia ruofei said,"

  "Tell me! What was going on with this he Dong? I don't think he's as simple as a department manager in your company!"

  Ling Qingxue sighed and walked straight to the sofa in the living room. She sat down and then began to tell Xia ruofei.

  It turned out that he Dong's relationship with the Ling family wasn't shallow.

  He Dong's father, he Xiangjun, and Ling Qingxue's father, Ling Xiaotian, were comrades in arms. This wasn't the most important thing. The most important thing was that he Xiangjun had once saved Ling Xiaotian's life, and because of that, he Xiangjun had been permanently disabled.

  Back then, both of them had served in a military unit in southern Yunnan Province. He Xiangjun was Ling Xiaotian's squad leader. Due to historical reasons, a large number of mines had been left in the border area, and the two of them had belonged to a unit that specialized in mine clearance.

  That year, during the minesweeper operation at the border, Ling Xiaotian had accidentally touched a mine and he Xiangjun, who was beside him, had pushed him away. Yet, his own legs had been blown apart.

  Later on, he Xiangjun returned home as a disabled soldier, and Ling Xiaotian also left the Army after his service was up and returned to his hometown to start a business.

  Although one of them was in the southeast province and the other was in Yubei province, Ling Xiaotian had always been concerned about he Xiangdong's life. Especially after his business had grown bigger and bigger, he had often sponsored he Xiangjun's family.

  As he Xiangjun's only son, Ling Xiaotian had borne all of he Dong's expenses from elementary school until he graduated from his master's degree. Moreover, after he Dong graduated from Yubei University, Ling Xiaotian had directly absorbed him into Ling Ji F & B. After training in a basic position for a period of time, Ling Xiaotian had entrusted him with the important task of being the manager of an important Department like the procurement department.

  Ling Xiaotian had always felt that he owed he Xiangjun, so he had spared no effort in nurturing he Dong. It could be said that he thought highly of he Dong.

  Ling Qingxue naturally wouldn't say anything about this. She also felt that it was only natural.

  However, what truly troubled Ling Qingxue was that he Dong had launched a fierce offensive on her since the first time they had met, making Ling Qingxue unable to bear it.

  But because of he Xiangjun, Ling Qingxue couldn't show he Dong too much face.

  Today's situation was also because he Dong's attitude towards Xia ruofei had completely infuriated Ling Qingxue. Otherwise, she wouldn't have flipped out on the spot.

  What made Ling Qingxue even more vexed was that she had mentioned to Ling Xiaotian that he Dong had wooed her, and she had also clearly expressed that she had no feelings for he Dong, hoping that Ling Xiaotian would step forward and tactfully persuade he Dong.

  She didn't expect Ling Xiaotian to persuade her to interact more with he Dong.

  This instantly gave Ling Qingxue an ominous premonition. She guessed that Ling Xiaotian might have the intention of matchmaking her and he Dong to repay her kindness.

  Although Ling Xiaotian wouldn't interfere too much in his daughter's love life, his silent approval was like a shot in the arm for he Dong, making him even more motivated. Now that everyone in the company knew about it, Ling Qingxue was naturally very vexed.

  After hearing Ling Qingxue's words, Xia ruofei could not help but feel speechless. He wanted to say a few words of comfort but did not know where to start. For a moment, the living room was silent.

  After a long while, Ling Qingxue forced a smile and said,"

  "Actually, it's nothing. As long as I don't agree, my dad won't force me to do something I don't want to do!"

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,

  "That's true. What era are we in now? there's no such thing as arranged marriage or marrying someone to repay a debt of gratitude anymore!"

  Ling Qingxue nodded and said,"

  "Forget it, let's not talk about these unhappy things ... Ruofei, I'm really sorry about what happened today. I didn't know that he Dong would suddenly make things difficult for you on purpose, and he even said such nasty things ..."

  Xia ruofei's eyes lit up and he said,"

  "This has nothing to do with you. However, this he Dong was indeed asking for a beating! After hearing what you said, I feel that he Dong's father is indeed a man! He's definitely a competent squad leader in the Army, but he's not good at educating children ..."

  Ling Qingxue's eyes flashed with worry as she said,"

  "RUO Fei, you must not do anything rash! I'll talk to my dad when I get back. Your new vegetables are very important to Ling Ji F & B. He'll definitely listen to my opinion and sign a supply contract with you. "

  Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head."

  "Qingxue, don't worry about this for now. I have my own way of dealing with it!"

  "But ..." Ling Qingxue wanted to say something but stopped.

  Xia ruofei chuckled and said,"

  "Don't worry! I'll definitely reserve the stock I promised you, not a catty less, it'll just be a few days later!"

  "That's good ..." Ling Qingxue patted her chest lightly and pretended to be relieved."I thought you were so angry that you didn't want to work with our Ling Ji restaurant anymore!"

  "Why would I?" Xia ruofei smiled and said,"I still have to give face to my old classmate!"

  "Should I thank you then?" Ling Qingxue pouted, then snorted and said,"he Dong, that idiot! You thought I gave you that supply contract on purpose to take care of you! You really have eyes but can't recognize gold embedded in Jade!"

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,"

  "Let's not talk about this killjoy! Speak! What do you want to eat for lunch? I'll personally cook later!"

  Ling Qingxue immediately cheered, but before she could say anything, the phone in her bag rang.

  She took out her phone and looked at Xia ruofei."

  "It's my dad ..."

  Xia ruofei smiled and raised his chin, indicating for her to answer the call.

  Ling Qingxue picked up the phone and said,"

  "Dad ... What? Dad, it's not like what he Dong said ... Aiya, dad, listen to me ... Oh ... Okay ... I know ..."

  Ling Qingxue's voice became lower and lower as she spoke. In the end, she hung up the phone sullenly and said angrily,"

  "He Dong is actually the villain who filed a complaint first! You went to my dad's place to stir up trouble! My dad wants me to go back to the company immediately ..."

  Xia ruofei shrugged and asked,"

  "Then you're prepared to ..."

  Ling Qingxue snorted and said,"

  "I'll go back! I was just about to tell my dad about this! If it wasn't for our relationship, Ling Ji would have missed a great opportunity to get out of this predicament! If it's really like that, then he Dong can hardly absolve himself of the blame!"

  If it could be said that Ling Qingxue had only been a little annoyed with he Dong in the past, then she now thoroughly loathed him.

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,

  "You can go back and talk to your father, but don't get into a conflict with him because of this. Believe me, I can handle this!"

  "Alright, I understand ..." Ling Qingxue said obediently. She then added,"then you must remember that you owe me a meal!" And it's the kind that requires you to personally cook ..."

  Xia ruofei laughed.

  "I remember, I remember! I'll make it up to you the next time you come!"

  Ling Qingxue laughed and said,"

  "I'll go back first then ..."

  Xia ruofei nodded.

  Only then did Ling Qingxue pick up her handbag and walk out of the villa. Xia ruofei sent her out and watched her get into the Porsche 911. He smiled and waved at her, then watched the sports car drive away.

  As he turned around and walked back to the villa, the image of Ling Qingxue's beautiful smile kept flashing in Xia ruofei's mind. He couldn't help but shake his head and think,"Don't tell me that I'm really having some thoughts about this girl!

  In fact, after Xia ruofei recovered from his terminal illness, his mentality had quietly changed. Ling Qingxue was also a first - Class beauty. It was obvious that she had feelings for Xia ruofei. She was even more proactive in their relationship. Xia ruofei was not a Saint. He had unconsciously developed some feelings for her, but he did not notice it.

  Xia ruofei got rid of these distracting thoughts and started to think about what had happened today.

  He Dong's words and actions today had already angered Xia ruofei. In the military, he was known for his unwillingness to admit defeat. If he didn't fight back after he Dong deliberately made things difficult and humiliated him today, then he wouldn't be the "Blood Wolf" that made his enemies tremble in fear.

  Xia ruofei's most powerful counterattack weapon was naturally the new super - Quality vegetables.

  He already had a rough idea, and now that he had sat down and thought for a long time, the plan in his heart gradually took shape.

  Xia ruofei's lips curled into a cold smile as he muttered to himself,"

  "He Dong, I'll definitely give you an unforgettable lesson this time!"
