Translator: 549690339

It was getting late and since he had confirmed that song Qiming would be coming, Xia ruofei decided to cook a few dishes and prepare a simple dinner.

When Song Wei’s car arrived at the jiangbin villa district, Xia ruofei had just finished preparing dinner.

Song Qiming was very low – Key this time. Fie did not use his own car and sat in the back seat of Song Wei’s car.

“Uncle song! Welcome!” Xia ruofei smiled and went up to him.

The villas in this area were all very far apart from each other, and there were green plants between each villa, so there was no doubt that they were very private. Therefore, song Qiming did not need to hide anymore. After he got out of the car, he looked around and said with a smile,”Ruofei, your house is so luxurious! It seems that it’s good to be rich!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Uncle song, don’t forget that you’re also a cultivator. Materialistic enjoyment is not what cultivators pursue.”

“That’s not the same. Even if you’re training, you’ll be happier if you train in a better environment!” Song Qiming laughed heartily.

“That’s true. Flowever, the environment that cultivators value is mainly the concentration of spiritual energy.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”for example, the Paradise Island that we’re going to later. Even if it’s a deserted island with only one thatched cottage, the cultivators would be happy to go there!”

When Xia ruofei mentioned the Peach Blossom Island, song Qiming’s interest was piqued. He said, “I’m looking forward to it! RUO Fei, when are we leaving? I don’t have much time. I’ll be back by the morning of the day after tomorrow at the latest. This is already my limit.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”uncle song, there’s no hurry.” It’s almost mealtime, we can’t just go on an empty stomach, can we? I’ve already prepared some dinner, let’s eat after that!”

“Good! Then let’s eat!” Song Qiming said as he waved his hand.

When Xia ruofei and his group entered the villa, Ling Qingxue had already brought out the dishes that Xia ruofei had prepared and placed them on the dining table.

When she saw song Qiming, she smiled and greeted him.””Uncle song, how are you?”

“Nice to meet you, Qingxue!” Song Qiming looked at the fragrant dishes on the table and could not help but ask,”did you make all this? As expected from a family of chefs, your cooking skills are really not bad!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but blush and said,””Uncle song, you’ve misunderstood. This was all RUO Fei’s doing. Although my family runs a restaurant, I’ve almost never been in the kitchen since I was young. My father’s skills are passed down to men and not women, and he has taught them to my senior brothers!”

Ling Xiaotian doted on his daughter, Ling Qingxue, so he naturally wouldn’t have any prejudice against her. He also wouldn’t treasure her and refuse to teach her how to cook. In reality, Ling Qingxue wasn’t interested in cooking at all, and she didn’t have much talent either. Ling Xiaotian also didn’t want his daughter to suffer, so since Ling Qingxue didn’t want to learn, he might as well not teach her.

In any case, those disciples of his had basically received his true teachings, and their skills could be considered not lost in his hands.

“Dad!” Song Wei chuckled. Didn’t I say that it’s not good to have first – mover advantage? Qingxue doesn’t know how to cook at all. Her cooking skills are comparable to mine!”

Song Qiming was a little embarrassed. He smiled and said,””I was too subjective then…”

Xia ruofei came out and said,”come on!” Everyone, let’s sit down and eat! 1 didn’t prepare much today, so 1 just made a few dishes to fill our stomachs. Then we’ll set off!”

“Ruofei, you’re too humble!” Song Qiming smiled and pointed at the table.”These dishes look appetizing. Your cooking skills are definitely very good! No wonder I mistakenly thought that it was the Ling family’s cooking!”

Everyone sat down and Xia ruofei took the initiative to serve them. He filled a bowl of rice for everyone and poured a glass of fruit juice for everyone from the refrigerator.

As they were about to leave, Xia ruofei did not prepare any wine. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Without drinking, he naturally ate much faster.

After a while, everyone was full.

Song Wei stood up and helped Ling Qingxue clear the dishes. Xia ruofei brought song Qiming around the villa.

After everything was packed, Xia ruofei said,””Good! Then let’s go!”

After that, Xia ruofei brought the three of them to the balcony on the top floor of the villa.

Song Qiming was excited. At the same time, he was curious about Xia ruofei’s flying Dharma Treasure.

Even though he had heard Song Wei mention the black Phoenix flying ship, he would still find it hard to believe if he had not seen it with his own eyes.

Xia ruofei took out the black Phoenix flying ship.

The tiny black Phoenix flying ship was in his palm. He used his mind to communicate with the ship’s control core and activated the concealment array. Then, he waved his hand and threw the ship out.

The black – Phoenix flying ship grew in size as the wind blew, and in the blink of an eye, it had become a massive flying ship that was completely black in color. It hovered at a height that was almost parallel to the rooftop.

It was song Qiming’s first time to see an airboat. He was also startled.

This was simply black technology! It could actually change its size at will, and it completely ignored the effect of gravity, directly floating here.

If the Army was equipped with such a flying boat, wouldn’t it be possible for divine troops to descend from the sky at any time?

Xia ruofei did not know what song Qiming was thinking.. He smiled and said,””Alright, let’s board the boat!”
