Chapter 1195: The joy of family (3)

Translator: 549690339

Hu Zi’s mother was still a little embarrassed, but she could feel Xia ruofei’s deep filial piety, so she nodded her head in relief.

Xia ruofei wrapped the red string around Hu Zi’s mother’s neck and fastened it to the back.

During this process, he had already used his zhenqi to form a thread and lightly pricked the skin where the Jade Leaf was, secretly staining the Jade Leaf with a trace of Hu Zi’s mother’s blood. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Jade Leaf immediately absorbed Hu Zi’s mother’s blood.

Hu Zi’s mother could vaguely feel that she was very close to this Jade Leaf. She picked it up with great fondness, lowered her head, and examined it. She smiled and said,”Ruofei, you don’t say. This piece of Jade seems to have a spirit. Godmother likes it a lot!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m glad you like it. Remember. You must ...”

“Wear it on your body, and don’t take it off at any time!” Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao both said in unison.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. You all know how to answer first ...”

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”you’ve said it several times in this short period of time. How can we not remember it?” Brother ruofei, don’t repeat yourself! Otherwise, you’d be Mrs. Lin!”

Xia ruofei said,”Okay, okay, okay!” Just remember that!”

“It’s my turn!”Lin Qiao said eagerly. Brother ruofei, help me put it on!”

Xia ruofei smiled as he picked up another Jade Leaf and put it on Lin Qiao’s finger. During the process, he naturally did the same thing.

Xia ruofei did not intend to let Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao know the special nature of this Jade Leaf. Anyway, as long as they wore the Jade Leaf at all times, it was equivalent to giving them a powerful protective talisman. Xia ruofei could rest assured of their personal safety.

Lin Qiao naturally felt the closeness between her and the Jade Leaf and fondled it with love.

“Godma, Qiao’ er, why don’t you stay at the farm today?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Lin Qiao immediately replied,”okay!” I still want to see master and the others!”

When Lin Qiao was interning at the Paradise company, two female employees taught her how to use PS, AI, and other software. They helped her do a lot of design, and the other employees in the art design team had a good relationship with her.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother hesitated for a moment before saying,””We’ve just moved into our new house ...”

Lin Qiao said,”the house doesn’t have legs. It can’t run away.” You haven’t been staying here for more than a month!”

“You little girl! What are you saying!” Hu ‘er’s mother laughed and scolded.

Xia ruofei also tried to persuade her,”godmother, just go back and stay for a day!” Don’t you miss Nan Nan?”

Hu Zi’s mother was in charge of picking up and sending Nan Nan every day. She had also established a deep relationship with the cute little angel. When she heard this, she no longer hesitated and nodded slightly.

“Yay!” Lin Qiao cheered,”let’s go! Let’s set off now!”

The three of them cleaned up the house and drove back to the farm.

As soon as Lin Qiao returned to Taoyuan farm, she took some small gifts she bought on Egret Island and went straight to the company’s general office building to meet her former colleagues.

On the other hand, Hu Zi’s mother ran to the staff dormitory to see Nan Nan.

She said she was going to stay for a day, but in fact, Lin Qiao didn’t want to leave after she stayed. Xia ruofei drove her to the high – speed rail station to return to Egret Island on October 7th. Then, he sent Hu Zi’s mother back to the rental house in the forestry Bureau’s family area. For the convenience of sending and dropping Nan Nan off, Hu Zi’s mother still lived in this rental house. The new house at “Grand view of the world” was empty most of the time.

After sending Hu Zi’s mother off, Xia ruofei did not stay in the city for long and immediately drove back to Taoyuan farm.

Two days ago, the company’s official website and several other e – commerce platforms had announced that the Jade skin cream would be on sale on the last day of the National Day. The time was 12:00 PM.

Feng Jing had already returned to Sanshan. The company’s administrative department, sales department, and even finance department had all been transferred together just for the sale of the Yushi cream. They had to monitor the background data of all major e – commerce platforms, answer customers ‘questions, arrange the delivery of goods after the sale, produce data reports, and so on. There was still a lot of work waiting for everyone to complete.

Xia ruofei returned to the farm at 11:50.

He drove straight to the comprehensive office building and quickly walked up.

No one went to the cafeteria to eat. They were all gathered in a large office on the third floor, nervously watching the situation on the various platforms.

There were only a few minutes left before the sales would be open. Whether the previous popularity of the jaded skin cream was false or not would depend on the situation this time ...
