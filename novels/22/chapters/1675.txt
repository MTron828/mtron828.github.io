Chapter 1676: Everyone’s high_1

The official Weibo account of qiuhang didn’t have many fans, but when this blog post came out, it instantly gained hundreds of thousands of fans and the comment area was extremely popular.

There was too much information in this short paragraph of text, such as the loss of ability of the pilot, forced landing, and so on. Most importantly, the key person was Chinese, which naturally attracted the enthusiastic attention of Chinese netizens. Everyone left messages to ask about the situation.

The captain from before also reposted the Weibo post immediately and said humorously,”I take back what I said before. It seems like nothing is impossible in this world. What I’m most concerned about now is, is the passenger who was ordered to fly the plane in the face of danger our colleague?

In the face of the netizens ‘enthusiasm, qiuhang’s official Weibo was also somewhat unexpected. After about half an hour, it updated its Weibo: Thanks to the concern of the netizens, because the incident had just happened, the official investigation had not yet started, so many details could not be disclosed for the time being. What I can tell you here is that all the passengers on board are safe. Only a few have suffered minor injuries. After examination, they are not in any serious condition. Please rest assured. In addition, according to Xiao ao’s private understanding, the passenger who was forced to land was not a professional pilot!

At the end of the Weibo post, the A.I. Official Weibo editor naughtily tagged the captain.

The captain did not have a flight mission today and was very concerned about the incident, so he saw the update on the Australian Airlines ‘official Weibo immediately.

He immediately reposted the Weibo post and attached three facepalm emojis.

This Captain was a Captain instructor who had been converted from a military to a civilian. He was usually very active on Weibo. He would often post some beautiful scenery he had taken while in the cockpit and share aviation knowledge with everyone. Therefore, he had quite a number of fans on Weibo and was deeply loved by everyone.

After the captain reposted the Weibo post, his fans also commented one after another. Most of them were “gloating”.

“Hahaha! Instructor yang has been slapped in the face, I’m happy to see that!”

“Captain yang, does your face hurt ...”

“I feel bad for instructor yang for three seconds. However, even us aviation noobs find it hard to believe. No wonder instructor yang made the wrong judgment!”

The captain – in – command instructor was selected from the senior captains. Usually, they would take on more flying tasks. Above them were the inspectors. The operation assessment for the co – Pilot to the captain was the responsibility of the inspectors.

Captain yang was an instructor, so it was right for the fans to call him instructor yang or Captain yang.

Moreover, those who called him that were all true fans who knew him very well. Most of the comments were just teasing and did not have any malicious intentions, so Captain yang was naturally not angry. Instead, he showed his phone to his colleagues next to him, and everyone laughed.

Then, the pilots naturally began to discuss this rare incident from a professional point of view.

Captain yang pressed the ‘no’ button, and the Weibo post of the person who was on the flight with his girlfriend also went viral.

Because compared to the official statement of qstro airlines, this Weibo post was posted by someone who had personally experienced it, and there were many details in it.

The most important thing was that the Weibo post was accompanied by a photo of the blogger and Xia ruofei!

In the beginning, everyone was still guessing which was the blogger and which was the hero who flew the plane to land, because the blogger did not make it clear on Weibo. Besides, he rarely posted on Weibo, let alone taking selfies and the like.

However, Xia ruofei was quite famous. Even though he was not famous in the country, he was still quite well known in the southeast province.

Therefore, the netizens quickly recognized him.

“Isn’t that boss Xia from the Paradise Corporation on the right? He can actually fly a plane?”

“Boss Xia? Is he famous? What’s his background?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Copper ball science!”

“Copper ball +1”

“Copper ball +2”

......

There was a neat row of replies below, and finally, someone left a message: If you’re not sure about boss Xia’s shoes, you can go to Baidu and search for the Jade skin cream or Drunken Eight Immortals.

Some bored people went up to search for it and immediately came back to leave messages.

“I’ll go! The Jade skin cream and the eight Drunken Immortals were both under the name of this boss Xia! It’s really blinding my eyes ... There’s actually ... A paradise vegetable! I had the chance to eat it a few days ago, and it was so delicious! It’s a pity that it’s too expensive. ”

“Hahaha! Upstairs, you’re so ignorant! The Paradise Corporation is a star company in our Sanshan, and boss Xia is a self – made, young, and promising individual! But we don’t know when he got the skill to fly an Airplane!”

“Worship! President Xia, is there anything you don’t know?”

“I know, I know! He can’t give birth to monkeys!”

“The person above is being naughty! President Xia was a young hunk! Although he doesn’t know how to give birth to monkeys, he can definitely make others give birth to many monkeys for him ...”

Everyone happily left comments on Weibo, but as they chatted, they unknowingly went off topic.

However, Xia ruofei was the main character of this emergency. This matter was confirmed. After all, the official Weibo of qiuhang also said that it was the passenger, Mr. Xia, who helped the plane land. This person even posted a group photo. Wasn’t Xia ruofei the one with the surname Xia? What other possibilities could there be?

At first, the Paradise company didn’t know.

They couldn’t be blamed for being slow to react. The main thing was that everyone was actually very busy working in such a thriving new company. Who would go and check Weibo during working hours?
