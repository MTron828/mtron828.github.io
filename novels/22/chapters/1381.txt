Chapter 1382: The storm in the capital (1)

Translator: 549690339

Wang Jie couldn’t help but be stunned. He looked at Li Rui hesitantly, then laughed dryly and said,””Brother Rui, don’t scare me like that. Could it be that this company has some unknown background? I don’t think it’s possible ...”

A trace of disgust flashed in Li Rui’s eyes as he said,””Jie, you don’t have to beat around the bush. I don’t know the background of this company!”

“Then, brother Rui, you ...” Wang Jie asked in confusion.

“It’s because we’re not clear,” Li Rui said somewhat impatiently.”That’s why it’s terrifying!”

“Brother Jie, please give your brother some advice!” Wang Jie said,”you know me. I’m just a hothead. I don’t want to get into trouble without knowing ...”

Li Rui looked at Wang Jie and said,”you’re still a rash person?” You even know how to drag others to take the Thunder with you ...”

“Brother Rui, you’ve misunderstood. I didn’t mean it that way ...” Wang Jie said awkwardly.

“That’s enough. It doesn’t matter whether I have this intention or not. I won’t get myself involved in this muddy water. If you’re envious of this fat piece of meat, you can try to become a beauty yourself!” Li Rui looked at Wang Jie with a smile that wasn’t a smile and said.

The embarrassment on Wang Jie’s face grew. He said,””Brother Jie, please help me analyze this! You’ve always been smarter than us since we were young. Haven’t I always been following in your footsteps?”

When Wang Jie talked about his childhood, Li Rui’s expression softened a little. They were from the same compound when they were young, and their relationship was quite good. However, in these years, their respective parents were promoted. After being transferred to different units, they had less contact with each other.

Li Rui took a sip of red wine and slowly said,””Jie, I think you’ve been too successful these years and you’ve become a little arrogant! You can treat Tian Xiaojun’s incident as a joke, and treat other people’s accidents as a story. That’s fine, but you’ve learned your lesson. If you still dare to approach it, then you’ll be a little stunned!”

Wang Jie looked at Li Rui in a daze and didn’t say anything. Instead, he took a sip of wine gloomily.

Li Rui didn’t mind and continued,””Tian Xiaojun is a little lacking, but your strength is still limited compared to his, you admit that, right?”

“You can be considered objective!” Wang Jie said with a bitter smile.

“Isn’t this settled?” Li Rui said,”even Tian Xiaojun suffered a huge setback from the so – called ‘fat meat’, so why can you take a piece? Do you think everyone is a fool? Now, who would still have the mood to do so? Are you the only smart one?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Wang Jie’s expression changed slightly and he said,””But ... Tian Xiaojun, he ...”

“You’re saying that Tian Xiaojun can’t beat the local snake?” Li Rui interrupted Wang Jie’s words and said,”don’t forget that Tian Xiaojun’s father also came from the southeast province. He is at least half a local snake in Sanshan city! Furthermore, the most important point is ...”

Speaking of this, Li Rui stared at Wang Jie and slowly said,””Tian Xiaojun obviously didn’t suffer any hidden losses this time, but was crushed by someone, and fell into a huge mess! Otherwise, with his personality, even if he was rejected, he would at most swallow his words. Why would he come out and publicize it?”

Wang Jie finally became a little more alert, and his expression showed hesitation.

Li Rui took another sip of red wine and continued,””The only possibility is that the company’s background is shockingly big, or they have someone whom you and I can’t afford to offend supporting them! Only then can Tian Xiaojun expose his own shortcomings and take the initiative to publicize his disgraceful experience!”

“It’s just a small company in San Shan city, how could it be ...”Wang Jie said in surprise.

“Never underestimate anyone!” Li Rui said meaningfully,”especially when you haven’t seen the other party’s background clearly, you should be even more careful. Don’t be fooled by our glorious appearance. If we make a wrong step, we might bring our entire family to eternal damnation!”

“I understand, brother Rui. Thank you for your reminder!” Wang Jie said solemnly.

Li Rui nodded and looked left and right. Then, he leaned close to Wang Jie’s ear and whispered,””I heard that right after Tian Xiaojun and the others arrived at the three mountains, Zhao Yongjun from the Zhao family immediately followed them ...”

“What?” Wang Jie heard Zhao Yongjun’s name and couldn’t help but scream.

Li Rui glared at Wang Jie and then looked around vigilantly.

Only then did Wang Jie realize it. He quickly covered his mouth subconsciously, then lowered his voice and asked,””Brother Rui, is the information accurate? Could it be a coincidence?”

Li Rui said,’if it’s a coincidence, then this is too much of a coincidence! And I heard that not only did brother Jun go this time, but the young master of the song family, Hou Liang, and the others were also with him. Wei Jun seems to have gotten some kind of lucky recently, and brother Jun also brought him along!”

When Li Rui said this, his eyes couldn’t help but reveal an envious look.

“Wei Jun ... His father is from Tong Ren Tang ...” Wang Jie hesitated for a moment before asking.

“It’s him!” Li Rui said,”this news was told to me by a friend of Wei Jun ‘s. Although I don’t know the specific purpose of their visit to the three mountains, Tian Xiaojun’s behavior yesterday was too abnormal. If we link it to brother Jun and the others, then everything makes sense!”

“That’s right!” Wang Jie agreed.”Only a person like brother Jun can turn Tian Xiaojun into a stray dog ... Brother Rui, I think your analysis is very reasonable. It seems like there’s steel hidden in this fat piece of meat called paradise company! If you’re not careful, you might lose your teeth ...”

Li Rui nodded and said,”if it was really brother Jun, then it’s obvious. The reason why Tian Xiaojun did this must be under brother Jun’s pressure. He had no choice but to do this. Brother Jun only had one purpose, and that was to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys!” So that everyone won’t dare to covet the peach blossom company!”

Although he accidentally became a “monkey,” Wang Jie had to admit that Li Rui’s analysis was very reasonable.

In reality, Li Rui’s judgment was very close to the truth. However, what he didn’t know was that Zhao Yongjun and the others didn’t go there specifically for this matter. They just happened to meet. Xia ruofei’s strength was also very frightening. Even without Zhao Yongjun and the others, Tian Xiaojun wouldn’t have been able to succeed. In fact, he might have ended up in a worse state.

Wang Jie couldn’t help but feel a little dejected.”I thought I’d found some fat meat. I didn’t expect it to be a bone that’s hard to chew!”

Li Rui patted Wang Jie’s shoulder and said,””Alright! You should be glad! If you didn’t meet me and stupidly ran to the three mountains, that would be putting your face close to someone to be beaten!”

“Brother Rui is right!” Wang Jie said with some lingering fear. I have to thank you! Come, I’ll toast you!”

......

Wang Jie and Li Rui’s conversation was happening in different places in Beijing. Tian Xiaojun’s abnormal behavior didn’t dispel everyone’s desire for the Paradise Corporation. On the contrary, it attracted the attention of a few people like Wang Jie who didn’t pay attention to the Paradise Corporation.

Of course, there were a lot of people in the circle who understood this. Zhao Yong Jun and his group’s trip to San Shan was not a secret. Slowly, everyone knew about this matter and connected Tian Xiaojun’s matter with this matter.

As a result, a few nouveau riche like Wang Jie, who wanted to swallow the “fat meat,” completely gave up on the idea.

......

In a small district in Beijing, Tian Xiaojun walked into the elevator of Unit 1 with his briefcase under his arm.

This time, he had suffered a big loss at San Shan. Although Zhao Yong Jun and the others had promised to let bygones be bygones, Tian Xiao Jun was still very nervous. So, he began to tuck his tail between his legs, which was a rare sight. He went to work obediently until 6 pm sharp.

Of course, he wasn’t in the mood to play with Qianqian at all. The news of what happened yesterday had already spread like wildfire in the circle. He was like a joke now, and he could feel everyone’s strange gazes wherever he went.

If nothing unexpected happened, he would need to lie low for a long time. He would only be able to go out after everyone had slowly forgotten about this matter.

I’d better work honestly during this time!

Tian Xiaojun was extremely frustrated. Other than losing face, the three of them still had to donate one million Yuan to the Paradise Charity Foundation!

This matter should be done sooner rather than later, so as not to provoke the dissatisfaction of Xia ruofei, the god of death.

A million Yuan was not a big deal to the three of them, but it was definitely not a small sum.

Moreover, now that his prestige had been completely destroyed, even Xia Huan and Zhong Zixin, who originally followed his lead, were starting to disobey him. They had agreed to split the “compensation” of one million Yuan equally, but the two of them had also started to refuse.

Tian Xiaojun was very clear that if the money could not be transferred, although Xia Ling and Zhong Zixin would not be in a good position, he would be the first one to be punished by Xia ruofei. After all, he was the leader.

Tian Xiaojun opened the door of his house with this kind of frustration.

This was the residential building of the price administration. Tian Xiaojun was not married yet and did not want to start his own business, so he had been living with his parents.

However, in the past, he would spend every few days drinking and playing outside. It was common for him to not return home at night. His parents doted on him very much, but they were too lazy to care too much.

As soon as Tian Xiaojun entered the house, he felt that the atmosphere was not right.

His father, who used to be busy until very late at night, had actually arrived home before him and was sitting on the sofa in the living room.

Hearing the sound of Tian Xiaojun entering the door, Tian shunliang immediately turned his head to look at him. His sharp gaze made Tian Xiaojun’s heart tremble slightly.

“Dad, you didn’t work overtime today?” Tian Xiaojun asked carefully.

“I’m still in the mood to work overtime after such a big thing happened at home?” Tian shunliang said in a muffled voice,”Tian Xiaojun, you’ve really grown up now. You even dare to cause such a big trouble for your family!”

Tian Xiaojun was changing his shoes. His hands trembled slightly when he heard her, and the slipper in his hand fell to the ground. His face turned pale.

Xia ruofei’s second request was indeed a little fatal. After this matter was made public, it was basically impossible to hide it from his parents. However, Tian Xiaojun did not expect the news to spread so quickly. He was not even mentally prepared.

“What are you still doing?” Tian shunliang frowned and said,”why aren’t you coming over to report your glorious deeds?”
