3205 Disappeared without a trace (2)

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”that’s good. I’ll have to trouble sect leader Luo.”

……

The first heaven sect, the surging waves sect, and the flying flower Valley were also in their respective guest rooms, questioning the elders and disciples that had been temporarily recruited.

The three sects asked one – on – one questions while the others waited outside. However, they were not allowed to communicate with each other.

Chen Xuan, mu Jianfei, and Yu Xin ‘er were also helping each other in their respective guest rooms.

The results were out very quickly.

Xia ruofei, Chen Nanfeng, Mu Sheng, and Liu Mansha went to the living room of the master’s room in the middle courtyard. Xia ruofei set up a soundproof barrier and asked,””Seniors, what’s the situation? The two from our star Seizer sect have no reaction to the music ...”

“I’m ashamed to say this,” Chen Nanfeng said with a bitter smile.”I’m the sect master of the Tianyi sect, but I can’t sense the music. Among the five people from the first heaven society, only two of us successfully entered the situation you described. They were Shen tianfang and Xu yurou ...”

After Chen Nanfeng finished speaking, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha both frowned slightly at the same time.

This was not good news for them.

This was because Shen tianfang, an elder of the first heaven school, was an intermediate – Stage golden core cultivator.

The fact that Shen tianfang was able to react to music meant that cultivation was not the criteria for the selection of music pieces. The two of them did not react to the music because their cultivation was too high, but because they did not meet the selection criteria in other aspects.

Or to be more precise, it should be that they did not meet the token creator’s screening criteria.

Of course, what comforted Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha was that Chen Nanfeng, a late – Stage golden core cultivator, had also become their “brother in the same boat” as them.

But no matter what, the heavenly sect had three people who met the criteria, and they were at the mid – Stage, early – Stage, and Qi condensation realm respectively. It could be said that the cultivation levels were very evenly distributed.

However, Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha’s sects were not in such a good situation ... CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Liu Mansha smiled bitterly.”Our flying flower Valley was almost completely annihilated. It was a good thing that elder Yang Liu was able to react to the music and enter that wonderful situation.”

“We are elder mu Hua and that girl mu Jianping. Both of us can respond to music,” Mu Sheng said.

Xia ruofei did a mental comparison and realized that the three sect leaders had not lied about this matter. These people who met the criteria were the same as what he had observed.

The first heaven society now had three people. They were Shen tianfang, who was in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm, Chen Xuan, who was in the early stage of the Golden core realm, and Xu yurou, who was in the Qi refining realm.

The surging waves sect also sent three people. They were mu Hua, who was in the early golden core stage, and mu Jianfei and mu Jianping, who were in the Qi refinement stage.

There were two from the flying flower Valley. They were elder Yang Liu, an early jiedan stage cultivator, and Yu Xin ‘er, a Qi condensation disciple.

Xia ruofei was limited by his lack of influence. Luo Qingfeng and Wang Shan did not meet the requirements, so he should have been alone. However, Ling Qingxue had already reacted to the music and was considered a qualified candidate. Ling Qingxue was naturally on Xia ruofei’s side, so there were actually two people on Xia ruofei’s side. They were in the beginning stage of the Golden elixir realm and the Qi refining realm.

Calculating it, this was already not much different from the situation of the flying flower Valley.

In terms of absolute power, Xia ruofei’s side was stronger. Ling Qingxue’s cultivation might not be as high as Yu xiner ‘s, but Xia ruofei’s power was far stronger than Yang Liu’ s.

Xia ruofei quickly summarized the situation in his mind and said,””In that case, let’s have the fellow Daoists who meet the conditions stay. Let’s continue to discuss some key information in that wonderful situation! As for the other fellow Daoists who don’t meet the requirements and are willing to stay in the capital, I’ll have someone make arrangements for them. If they want to go back, they can start their return journey now. ”

Then, Xia ruofei added,””Of course, sect leader Chen, sect leader mu, and valley master Liu will stay to take charge of the situation.”

Embarrassment flashed across the faces of Chen Nanfeng and the other two.

Speaking of which, the three of them didn’t meet the requirements, but they were the leaders of their respective sects, so they naturally couldn’t be the same as ordinary disciples. Furthermore, there were many things that needed their approval. For example, Chen Xuan basically couldn’t make any decisions and had to ask Chen Nanfeng for instructions.

Therefore, even if the three of them didn’t meet the conditions, they had to stay.

“Elders and disciples who don’t meet the requirements should leave the capital,” Chen Nanfeng said.”Let everyone go back!”

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha both nodded in agreement.

After all, what everyone was most concerned about right now was still the cracking of the token’s Secret.

Soon, the three sects had arranged everything. Those disciples who did not meet the requirements, under the guidance of the elders, hurried back thousands of miles.

Those who were chosen by the music would stay in the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

Soon, everyone was gathered in the recording room in the basement. Xia ruofei looked around and said with a smile,””Everyone here is fated with that song. Everyone has experienced that wonderful and unforgettable scene. However, some fellow Daoists may not know the origin of this song. Let me introduce it to everyone first.”

Mu Hua and the others immediately looked at Xia ruofei.

“I have to start from the five Saints token ...” Xia ruofei said.

Then, Xia ruofei told everyone about the hard work they had put in, the detours they had taken, and the results they had achieved. He did not hide anything from them. At the end, he naturally mentioned the wonderful song.

At this time, mu Hua and the others realized that the scene they had experienced while listening to the song was actually related to the legendary five sages token!

Everyone became excited. Even Shen tianfang, who was in the intermediate stage of the Aurous core stage, could not help but be slightly shocked.

At this time, Chen Nanfeng stood up and said,””Everyone has listened to fellow Daoist Xia’s introduction. I hope that everyone will first watch their mouths. This matter is of great importance, so you must not leak this information. In addition ... You’re all chosen by the music, so the secret of cracking the token will fall on you. I hope that everyone can work together ...”

As the number one person in the cultivation world, Chen Nanfeng was naturally very confident when he said these words.

At this moment, Mu Sheng’s expression suddenly changed and he could not help but cry out.

“What happened?” Chen Nanfeng quickly asked.

Mu Sheng’s face turned very ugly and he said,””My five – Saint token has disappeared! I put it in my storage ring, how did it suddenly disappear! I’ve really seen a ghost!”

In fact, after scanning the floating point image, everyone had already separated the five Holy badges and saved their own badges.

Mu Sheng was looking for something in the storage ring just now and accidentally found that the five Saints token was gone. He scanned every corner of the storage ring with his spiritual power but could not find the token.

As soon as Mu Sheng said this, everyone’s face changed.

Very quickly, Liu Mansha also looked as if she had seen a ghost and said,””My ... My token is also gone!”

Chen Nanfeng’s expression changed as he looked at Chen Xuan and asked,””Xuan ‘er, where are our two tokens?”

The first heaven society was the only sect that had two five sacred medallions. Chen Nanfeng had given the medallions to Chen Xuan when he left the mountain to train. When Chen Nanfeng rushed to the capital yesterday, he didn’t take the medallions back and gave them to Chen Xuan for safekeeping.

Chen Xuan’s face turned pale, and even his voice was trembling.””They’re gone ... Two of them are gone ... What’s going on?”

At this moment, everyone remembered that there was another owner of the token, so they all turned to look at Xia ruofei.

...

Xia ruofei forced a smile.”Don’t look at me ... Senior mu said that his token was missing. I immediately checked my own token. It’s indeed gone.”

Xia ruofei’s five – Saint token was placed in the spirit map space but it had disappeared without a trace. Furthermore, Xia ruofei did not even notice it.

Xia ruofei now had absolute control over the spirit map space. It was impossible for a token to disappear in the space without him realizing it.

So, Xia ruofei was actually quite shocked.

Of course, he was shocked by such an ingenious method, not by the disappearance of the token.
