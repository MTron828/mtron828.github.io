Xia ruofei and Fang Liyun turned around immediately. Song Wei could not help but pounce on the bed and called out,””Dad! Dad!”

Fang Liyun asked,”Weiwei, are you sure you didn’t see wrongly?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’m sure I’m not mistaken!”Song Wei said with certainty.

Xia ruofei did not doubt it. Song Wei was also a cultivator. Even if she was in a state of agitation, she would not be mistaken. Besides, song Qiming’s sea of consciousness was recovering well. It would not be a surprise even if he woke up.

Fang Liyun could not help but turn to look at Xia ruofei and asked,””RUO Fei, what do you think?”

Xia ruofei looked at song Qiming, who was lying on the bed, and said,””Aunty, uncle song’s current condition ... I feel like he might wake up at any moment, so let’s just observe first ...”

Xia ruofei’s words stopped abruptly.

This was because he saw song Qiming move. This time, it was not his eyelids but his fingers.

Even though it was just a slight movement of his little finger, Xia ruofei was sharp enough to notice it.

“I don’t think there’s a need to observe! Uncle song will wake up soon!” Xia ruofei said excitedly,”if I’m not wrong, he should be able to hear our voices now!”

Fang Liyun’s body trembled slightly, and she revealed a surprised and happy expression.

Her reaction was the same as Song Wei ‘s. She rushed to the bed and called out song Qiming’s name with tears in her eyes.

……

Song Qiming opened his eyes, but he still looked a little weak.

He felt as if he had had a very long dream. In the dream, he was constantly moving through a seemingly endless maze, but he couldn’t find the exit.

After an unknown period of time, song Qiming seemed to have seen a light. In his dream, he rushed toward the light without hesitation.

Then, he felt as if his consciousness had returned to his body.

The pain all over her body, the smell of disinfectant in the ward, and the calls of her family ...

This feeling made song Qiming feel that he was still alive.

He heard his wife and daughter’s calls and tried to open his eyes, but his eyelids were as heavy as mountains.

After much effort, his eyelids finally opened with trembling hands.

When the light shone in, he could not help but squint his eyes again. It took him a while to get used to it.

When he opened his eyes again, he was greeted by the sight of Fang Liyun and Song Wei’s happy faces, and Xia ruofei standing behind them.

What happened on the highway a few days ago came back to him like a tide.

Song Qiming only remembered that he was sitting behind the driver with his eyes closed. Suddenly, the car came to an emergency stop, and the world spun around.

The last thing he could think of was the driver’s cry of fear and despair.

Then, he began that long and boring dream.

Song Qiming felt as if he had gone through many reincarnations in his dream, but it felt like it had only been a blink of an eye.

When he opened his eyes and saw the familiar world and the familiar people, song Qiming could not help but feel as if he was in a different world.

He opened his mouth, but no sound came out.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Uncle song, you’re still very weak. It’s best if you don’t speak.”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Fang Liyun quickly replied. Qiming, listen to RUO Fei! This time, it was all thanks to RUO Fei. You were so badly injured that even the medical experts in the province could do nothing about it. It was ruofei who pulled you back from the brink of death!”

Song Qiming looked at Xia ruofei with his weak eyes. He was grateful.

A few minutes later, song Qiming’s ward was packed to the brim.

Of course, the people who came were all medical staff.

Professor Chen, who had just gone out, rushed back with a few of his students after hearing that song Qiming was awake.

Ge Jun could not be bothered with the Chinese medicine anymore. He also returned to the ward with great strides. His legs were even more agile than professor Chen and the others.

While professor Chen and the others were examining song Qiming, Ge Jun and Xia ruofei were whispering to each other.

This was also because the news of song Qiming’s accident had always been kept a secret and the scope of information was controlled. Otherwise, the door of the ward would have been stomped flat. Of course, the ward did not have a door.

Song Qiming’s Secretary, Guangzhi Cao, had been staying in the hospital for the past few days. As soon as song Qiming woke up, he immediately reported the news to the provincial Party leader.

Soon, elder song, who was in the capital, also received the news.

Xia ruofei was still talking to Ge Jun about Chinese medicine when elder song called.

Xia ruofei excused himself from Ge Jun and walked out of the ward with his phone before picking up the call.

“Grandpa song!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“RUO Fei! Good job!” Elder song’s voice was a little excited.”You’ve done a great job!”

“Please don’t say that,” Xia ruofei said,”uncle song is my elder too. It’s my duty to help him!”

Elder song laughed and said,”ruofei, no matter what, the song family owes you another big favor!” Qiming owes you two lives! I probably won’t be able to pay you back in this lifetime ...”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”not really!” Not really! You’re treating me as an outsider by saying this ...”

“Ruofei, I would like to ask ... How long will it take for Qiming to return to work in his current condition?” elder song continued.
