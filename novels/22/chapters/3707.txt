“When you come to the flying flower Valley, I’ll definitely give you a meeting gift!” Liu Mansha said with a smile. Her love for Lu You was evident in her words.

Then, Liu Mansha turned her gaze to Shen Hu and smiled.”Thank you too, sect Master Shen!”

Shen Hu was somewhat flattered and quickly said, “You’re too polite! It’s Lu You’s good fortune that you accepted her. Our water Yuan sect is a small sect, and we’ve buried a talent…”

“Sect Master Shen, you must not undervalue yourself.” Liu Mansha said seriously,”any sect, including… Our soaring Flower Valley, has developed from a small sect step by step. Moreover, sometimes, a genius disciple can revitalize the entire sect. With such an outstanding disciple like Lu You, why do you have to worry about the sect not flourishing?”

“Then 1’11 be counting on your blessings!” Shen Hu said,”Lu You is indeed very outstanding.”

Liu Mansha smiled and said,”sect Master Shen, our two families can communicate more often in the future. If you are willing, I can also send disciples to the water element sect regularly for some cultivation exchange. You can even send some disciples to our soaring Flower Valley to cultivate. However … Only female disciples!” You should know our rules.”

“Of course! Of course!” Shen Hu was both surprised and delighted. He hurriedly said,”thank you, Valley master Liu!”

Everyone also congratulated Liu Mansha for accepting such a talented disciple. Although Lu You was unwilling to leave the water Yuan sect and was only Liu Mansha’s in – Name disciple, the soaring Flower Valley would obviously benefit from this relationship if Lu You really achieved something in the future. As Lu You’s teacher, Liu Mansha would benefit even more.

At this moment, Chen Nanfeng, who had been sitting in the corner of the garden, slowly opened his eyes. At the same time, a dozen more cultivators appeared at the entrance of the seven stars Pavilion.

“Good!” Chen Nanfeng laughed and said,”alright, the last few fellow Daoists have come out. The opening of the seven Star Pavilion ends here! I’m sure everyone has gained something, so I would like to congratulate everyone here!”

The cultivators didn’t leave after leaving the seven Star Pavilion. Before, they didn’t dare to disturb Chen Nanfeng, so they kept a distance from him and didn’t dare to make a sound to disturb him.

Chen Nanfeng was no longer in control of the seven Star Pavilion, so everyone walked up to him and thanked him.

A small number of cultivators had received the opportunity to improve their talents, and their hearts were filled with gratitude.

Xia ruofei and the rest also walked forward. When the Golden core stage cultivators walked over, the cultivators automatically made way for them.

“Sect leader Chen! Thank you!” Xia ruofei smiled.’Tve benefited a lot this time!”

“Haha!” Chen Nanfeng laughed and said,”the benefits you can obtain in the seven Star Pavilion will depend on your own abilities. The fact that nephew was able to gain something also means that you can obtain an Artifact Spirit. This has nothing to do with this old master.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“If it wasn’t for sect leader Chen who gave everyone a chance to enter the seven Star Pavilion, 1 wouldn’t have gotten the chance to improve my talent no matter how capable 1 am!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

What he said was right in the hearts of the cultivators, and they all agreed.

When more people heard Xia ruofei’s words, they realized that his talent had improved in the seven Star Pavilion. Everyone was secretly envious.

Among the cultivators who entered the seven Star Pavilion, only a small number of them had their talents improved. Most of them would only get some cultivation resources, and the worst would only get one Spirit stone.

In everyone’s eyes, Xia ruofei was like a proud Son of Heaven. His entire body was emitting a dazzling Halo. Now that his talent had been further improved in the seven Star Pavilion, he was definitely someone else’s child!

Chen Nanfeng smiled.”Nephew Xia, let’s talk in detail later. I don’t have anything to do today. Let’s have a drink or two.” Sect leader mu and valley master Liu will also be participating. We’re all old friends!”

“Is it convenient?” Mu Sheng asked with a smile.

“You’re good, old mu. Haven’t you been trying to leech off me? When did you ever feel like you were disturbing me?” Chen Nanfeng laughed and scolded.

It could be seen that his relationship with Mu Sheng seemed to be closer.

Of course, the female cultivators of the soaring Flower Valley had always been cold as ice, and the valley master Liu Mansha was also blunt towards male cultivators. It would be abnormal if she was also talking and laughing with Chen Nanfeng.

“Then we’ll accept your invitation.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sect leader Chen, you’ve worked hard for half a day. Go back and rest for a while. We’ll talk again when we eat!”

“Good, good, good!” Chen Nanfeng said with a smile.

“Then this junior will take his leave!” Xia ruofei cupped his hands at Chen Nanfeng and said.

The other cultivators also said their goodbyes. Some of them left the first heaven society and returned to their own sects, while Xia ruofei and the others who had a closer relationship with the first heaven society stayed. They were not in a hurry to leave.

The news of Chen Nanfeng’s breakthrough to the nascent soul realm would also spread throughout the cultivation world, including the first heaven society’s generous offer to give all cultivators a chance to enter the seven Star Pavilion. It would definitely become a good story for a long time.

Xia ruofei and the rest also returned to their own courtyards to rest.

Originally, Xia ruofei wanted to continue studying the “black origin Scripture” when he had the time. He studied it for a short period of time in the seven Star Pavilion. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that this cultivation technique was interesting.

With his current cultivation level and knowledge level, he would definitely not care about a cultivation method like the “black origin Scripture”. Even if he needed to cultivate it, he would be able to successfully cultivate it easily, just like two days ago..
