Chapter 164: Stealing the limelight (1)

As if a bomb had been thrown into the calm water, a buzzing sound was heard in the venue. For a moment, various languages were spoken at the same time. “Oh my God! It’s actually 1.45 kg ...” “I didn’t hear wrong, did I?” “Oh my God ... This is a miracle!” “I swear, this is probably the biggest truffle I’ve ever seen in my life ...” He said. …… The auctioneer was also very experienced. He stood on the stage with a professional smile until everyone’s discussion gradually died down. He then continued,””This truffle was found 18 hours ago in the Alba region of Italy. It was just in time for the flight to China, so it was actually added to the auction at the last minute!” After that, the auctioneer gestured, and a lady in a cheongsam walked up to the stage with a large tray. She placed the tray on the display stage in the middle of the stage, and the auctioneer walked over and tore off the red silk covering it, revealing the huge truffle. Everyone, including Xia ruofei, looked over. They saw a white truffle the size of a volleyball in a sealed container. The huge truffle was visually striking under the spotlight. The auctioneer continued to lift the transparent cover. Instantly, the hall that was already filled with the fragrance of truffles seemed to be filled with this special fragrance. The Grao family’s reputation was undoubted, and this was no doubt a top – grade white truffle. Even MA Xiong couldn’t help but be moved. The auctioneer smiled.”This is the biggest white truffle of the year. The starting price is 100000 dollars, and each bid must be no less than 5000 dollars. Interested friends may start bidding!” This level of white truffle obviously couldn’t be measured by the average market price. The starting price of $100000 seemed very expensive, but almost no one present would take it seriously. This was the biggest white truffle of the year. Just the name alone was worth the price. Therefore, almost as soon as the auctioneer’s voice fell, someone below raised his sign and reported the price. ” 110000 dollars!” “This friend, number 59, bid 110000 US dollars!” The auctioneer said quickly. ” 115 thousand!” ” 125000!” ” 130000!” The bids came one after another, and the auctioneer didn’t even have time to repeat the bids. Very soon, a new bid would be announced. The price continued to rise, and it soon broke through 200000 dollars. Many people looked at MA Xiong, thinking that such a big piece of truffle should be enough to catch his eyes. Moreover, this was also today’s grand finale. If he still didn’t make a move, it would be equivalent to coming here to do nothing. However, MA Xiong still sat firmly in his seat and had no intention of bidding. At this moment, a voice came from the right side of the third row.”” 250000 dollars!” Xia ruofei felt that the voice was familiar. He could not help but turn around and look at the source of the voice. He immediately revealed a strange smile. It turned out that the person who had raised the price by 50000 dollars was Blake, who had competed with Xia ruofei in the gym this morning and had crippled himself. Blake’s bid immediately stopped the bidding. A one – time increase of 50000 dollars was a bit intimidating. “Number 23, Mr. Blake, bids 250000 dollars!” The auctioneer took the opportunity to repeat Blake’s bid loudly. Obviously,$250000 was far from what many people wanted, so the bidding only stopped for a moment. ” 260000 dollars!” Someone quickly added. ” 270 thousand!” Blake raised the price without any hesitation. The other party thought for a moment, but before he could speak, someone from the other side of the hall made a new bid.”” 275000 dollars!” Blake calmly raised his board and said,”” 300000 dollars!” Another 25,000 bid was raised, and the auctioneer immediately repeated,””Mr. Blake has bid US $300000. Is there any higher bid?” Blake stood up and said with an elegant smile,”Monica, this top – grade truffle is just as mesmerizing as you. I’m determined to get it!” Monica kept a polite smile on her face and did not respond to Blake’s words. However, Xia ruofei could see a trace of disgust in her eyes. Blake’s bid made the atmosphere even more heated, as the price was basically close to the limit. There was no clear price for this rare truffle. In 2007, a 1.497 – kilogram white truffle was sold for $330000. In 2014, a 1.89 – kilogram white truffle was sold for $60000. This was the largest white truffle found so far. Someone once offered $1 million to buy it, but it was rejected. So, the deal price of $60000 was not enough to explain the problem. The truffle today weighed 1.45 kg, and it was a very high yield year, so it was reasonable to use the auction price of 2007 as a reference. Blake’s bid was now close to the final price of the 1.49 kg white truffle. Some of the entrepreneurs and top chefs who were eager to compete also began to weigh the pros and cons. It wasn’t that they couldn’t afford it, but rich people wouldn’t be willing to be a spendthrift. ” 305 thousand dollars!” Finally, someone made a higher bid. The smile on Blake’s face froze, but he also knew that he could not hesitate at this moment, so he immediately followed up with a bid,”” 310 thousand dollars!” Increasing the price without any hesitation after the other party had made a bid was also a psychological strategy to show one’s determination to win. Sure enough, when Blake’s bid was out, the other party shrugged and sat down, obviously not going to compete anymore. After the auctioneer asked a few times, he finally began to count down. In fact, the price had already exceeded their expectations. ” 310000 dollars going once!” …… ” 310000 dollars going twice!” At this moment, MA Xiong, who was standing beside Xia ruofei, suddenly raised his sign and said unhurriedly,”” 320 thousand dollars!” Xia ruofei was shocked. He quickly turned around and asked in a low voice,””Old master Ma, why did you ...” MA Xiong knew that Xia ruofei was going to auction off a batch of white truffles. He had seen the truffles with his own eyes. There was no doubt that Xia ruofei’s batch of truffles was of a higher quality. Furthermore, they were generally heavier than the ones sold by the Grasso family. There was no need for MA Xiong to compete for the White truffle at such a high price. “Xia Sheng, it’s fine. I just don’t like him ...” MA Xiong smiled. “Ah?” Xia ruofei was even more surprised. MA Xiong’s eyes were still fixed on the White truffle on the stage in front of him. He said with a faint smile,”Because this kid wants to steal your woman, Xia Sheng. Of course, I can’t let him be in the limelight. A few hundred thousand dollars is nothing.” Xia ruofei’s face darkened and he was completely speechless ...
