The ocean in the space was real seawater. Xia ruofei had been in it for a long time, so his body was sticky and uncomfortable. Once he left the space, he went to the bathroom and took a shower.

It was already half – past one in the afternoon when he went downstairs.

Lin Qiao saw Xia ruofei and shouted,””Brother ruofei, what are you doing in the room? I’ve been calling you for dinner, didn’t you hear me?”

Xia ruofei laughed dryly.”I was a little tired this morning. I just fell asleep.”

“You’re sleeping too deeply!” Lin Qiao mumbled,”I even went to knock on the door for a long time! There’s no reaction at all. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled awkwardly. He was glad that he remembered to lock the door from the inside. Otherwise, Lin Qiao would have definitely barged in.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother did not go to rest either. Seeing this, she rebuked,””Qiao’ er, how can you talk to your brother ruofei like that? He only fell asleep because he was too tired from work!”

Then, Hu Zi’s mother smiled gently at Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei! Just wait a moment! The food is cold, I’ll go heat it up for you. ”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”godmother, it’s okay. It’s summer. There’s no need to heat it up. I’ll just eat it!”

“That won’t do!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”it’s easy to get a stomachache if it’s cold. Sit down and rest for a while. I’ll heat it up very quickly!”

After that, Hu’s mother took the food on the table back to the kitchen without saying anything.

Xia ruofei had no choice but to sit down on the sofa in the living room. Lin Qiao was watching a drama on the tablet. She sat on the sofa with her legs crossed and her Cotton Casual Pants pulled up, revealing her snow – White thighs. However, she didn’t care. She was eating dragon fruit with a toothpick while staring at the tablet intently.

Xia ruofei glanced at her and quickly retracted his gaze. He thought to himself,”this girl doesn’t care about her image. Although we’re at home, I’m not related to her by blood. I’m not her brother. I should at least be careful about the boundaries between men and women.”

However, Xia ruofei didn’t know how to explain it to Lin Qiao. This topic was already awkward. If he said it too seriously, Lin Qiao might be unhappy. If he said it tactfully, she might not understand. Besides, Hu Zi’s mother was in the kitchen not far away. It was not convenient to talk about this topic with Lin Qiao.

Hence, he sat up straight and stared at the TV. In fact, Xia ruofei did not pay attention to what was on the TV.

Fortunately, Hu Zi’s mother quickly heated up the food. As she placed the food back on the table, she said,””RUO Fei, come over and eat!”

“Woof! Thank you, godmother!” Xia ruofei said.

He picked up the bowl and gobbled it up. Hu Zi’s mother glanced at Lin Qiao and said,””Qiao’ er, you little girl, you don’t even know how to come and help me. You’re only holding the computer all day long. Don’t just stand there, if you want to look at it, go back to your room!”

Lin Qiao playfully stuck out her tongue at Xia ruofei and went back to her room with the tablet.

Xia ruofei said as he ate,”godmother, you should go back to your room and rest!” I’ll clean it up after I’m done. ”

Usually, by this time, Hu Zi’s mother would have already gone for her afternoon nap. However, she had waited until now because Xia ruofei had not come down for lunch. Xia ruofei felt warm inside, but at the same time, he felt a little apologetic.

Hu’s mother smiled.”It’s okay. I’ll wait for you to finish eating. You don’t have to worry about the kitchen. Godmother will clean it up.”

Xia ruofei put down his bowl and chopsticks and said,”Godma, I’m really sorry for what you’re doing. Listen to me. Go and rest!” Wasn’t it just a few bowls? I will wash it!”

Xia ruofei finally persuaded Hu Zi’s mother to go back to the house after much persuasion. He sat down and continued eating.

After they were done eating, Xia ruofei cleaned the table and washed the dishes. It was already past twoo’ clock.

He didn’t plan to take an afternoon nap, so he strolled out the door.

The Midsummer sun was hot, and it scattered spots of light under the shade of the farm path. A breeze blew, and the branches of the trees on both sides of the path swayed slightly. The distant chirping of cicadas came, giving off a particularly tranquil feeling.

Xia ruofei walked to the production site of the iron – Skin Dendrobium. As expected, Qin Xiaojun and the rest were not resting. He was busy processing the iron – Skin Dendrobium with five to six workers.

As Xia ruofei had specifically instructed him to do so, master Luo did not do it himself. He came here as an advisor, mainly to watch Qin Xiaojun and the others ‘operation and only point out any problems in time.

This could not only train the workers on the farm who were responsible for making the iron – skinned maples, but also ensure that no mistakes would be made during the whole production process and the quality of the iron – skinned maples could be guaranteed.

Seeing Xia ruofei, master Luo, Qin Xiaojun and the others quickly came over to greet him. Xia ruofei waved his hand and said with a smile,”You guys continue, don’t mind me, I’m just looking around.”

Qin Xiaojun and the rest continued with their work while Xia ruofei and master Luo stood under the shade. He took out a cigarette and gave one to master Luo. They then chatted for a while.

Although it wasn’t the first time that he had come into contact with these Ironskin vessel fresh strips, master Luo still praised their quality. As an old master who had been in this industry for more than 20 years, seeing the top quality of the Ironskin vessel fresh strips was like a young man seeing a beautiful woman. It was a love from the bottom of his heart.

Master Luo had even subtly suggested that he wanted to jump ship to work, but Xia ruofei was too embarrassed to poach his comrade, so he could only smile and decline.

Of course, master Luo was just saying that. He was a native of Jiang – Zhe province, Anyue city, and he had a family. If he were to come to the southeast province to work, he would really hesitate! Besides, Qian Lijun’s company was giving master Luo a pretty good salary.

Xia ruofei asked Qin Xiaojun and the rest about the production process. Master Luo said that Qin Xiaojun and the rest were very familiar with the process, especially with his control of the heat. He would not need to come over again next time.

After chatting for a while, Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to master Luo again. Then, he left the production site of the tin Kaede Gladiator and strolled towards the office building.

Because most of the employees lived on the farm, the company did not implement a nine – to – five working system. Instead, they started work at eight in the morning and got off work at five – thirty in the afternoon. The corresponding lunch break was longer, so the employees could go back to the dormitory area to rest for a while.

There were still 20 minutes before work started, but Xia ruofei realized that Feng Jing’s office door was already open. He couldn’t help but shake his head helplessly. This CEO Feng was really a workaholic!

Xia ruofei wanted to go straight to Feng Jing’s office, but he stopped in his tracks after some thought. He took out his keys, opened his office door, and walked in.

After closing the door, Xia ruofei took out two porcelain bottles from the spirit map space.

There were two portions of jaded skin ointment inside, both of which he had previously refined and stored in the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei took the jaded skin ointment, opened the office door, and went to the next room.

As expected, Feng Jing did not go back to rest in the afternoon. She was currently in front of the computer, typing furiously on the keyboard. Xia ruofei knocked on the door lightly.

Feng Rao stopped her work and looked up. When she saw Xia ruofei, she quickly stood up and said,””Chairman, why are you here in the middle of the day?”

“If I didn’t come, how would I know that our boss Feng is working overtime again?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I did some calculations with my fingers,” Feng Rao said with a smile.”I knew that you’d launch a surprise attack today, so I deliberately showed it to you!”

“Forget it!” Xia ruofei said,”how can I not know what kind of person you are?”

“Then, Chairman, shouldn’t you be giving me overtime pay?” Feng Jing asked with a smile.

“It’s a must!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”here! The reward salary is here!”

Xia ruofei said as he placed the jaded skin ointment on Feng Jing’s desk.

Feng Rao’s eyes immediately lit up. She had personally experienced the magical effects of the jaded skin cream, and she couldn’t forget it after using it!

“Thank you, Chairman!” Feng Rao smiled sweetly and put the jaded skin ointment into her desk drawer without any hesitation.

“You’re welcome. Tell me when you’re done. I’ll make it for you myself!” Xia ruofei said, then glanced at the computer screen and asked,”it’s the middle of the day. What are you busy with?”

Feng Jing turned the monitor in Xia ruofei’s direction and smiled.””Isn’t it because the e – Commerce Department’s construction plan needs to be rushed? There’s also a lot of work to do during normal working hours, and it happens to be quieter in the afternoon. No one will disturb us, so I want to use this time to come up with a plan. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel a little ashamed.””It’s all my fault. I’m putting too much pressure on you ... President Feng, you don’t have to be in such a hurry. It doesn’t matter if you come one day earlier or later. ”

“It’s mainly because we can’t wait for the recruitment to start!”Feng Rao smiled. The recruitment plan for the pharmaceutical company is basically done. If we want to recruit at the same time, the e – Commerce Department’s plan can not be delayed, otherwise the progress of both sides will be affected. ”

“But you still have to rest!” Xia ruofei said with concern,”it’s two days later, what’s the big deal?” If Xue Jinshan has any objections, tell him to come and find me!”

Feng Rao’s heart warmed up for no reason. It felt good to be cared for. She smiled and said,”I understand, Chairman. I’ll take care of my rest ...”

“Mm! It’s good that you know. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and got up to leave. He had only wanted to make a phone call in his office, but when he saw that Feng Jing was working overtime, he brought the jaded skin cream to her. Other than that, he had nothing else to do.

“Chairman, I think we should move the headquarters to the city as soon as possible,” Feng Jing said. We’re hiring a new batch of people this time, so the office space is a little crowded. Although the staff dormitories here are good, it’s far from the city, so there are still many inconveniences in everyone’s lives. This is not good for us to attract talents!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Sure. I’ll think about it after this.”

Then, Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Boss Feng, if there’s nothing else, I won’t disturb you anymore. You can continue with your work! You must rest well! Don’t work too hard ...”

“I understand, Chairman!” Feng Rao said with a sweet smile.

After watching Xia ruofei leave the office, Feng Rao reached into her desk drawer and gently rubbed the wide – mouthed porcelain bottle of jaded skin cream. She could not help but smile.

It took her a while to come back to her senses. Her pretty face blushed slightly, and she closed the drawer in a panic. She turned to the computer screen and continued to work.

However, after staring at the computer for a while, she couldn’t type a single word.

…… CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After Xia ruofei returned to his office, he took out his phone and dialed the number of President Lin of Qiantang Tongren Hall.

The last time CEO Lin came over to discuss the contract, Xia ruofei had promised him that he would help him look for high – Quality wild ginseng. In the blink of an eye, more than two months had passed. Xia ruofei decided to dig out two wild ginseng from the interspace and sell them to CEO Lin.

On one hand, he wanted to fulfill his promise. On the other hand, Xia ruofei wanted to save up as much money as possible. The next step was to relocate the company’s headquarters, and there would definitely be many places where he would need money.

The phone rang two or three times before President Lin picked it up. He sounded very excited.”Director Xia, is the new batch of iron Kaede fighters ready?”
