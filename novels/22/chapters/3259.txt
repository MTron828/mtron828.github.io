The other cultivators who had stayed behind to guard the courtyard house were already looking up from the courtyard.

Chen Xuan and the others stood on the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship and waved to the people below.

Chen Nanfeng smiled when he saw his son standing by the ship’s railing unscathed.

It was impossible to say that they were not worried. Although they had been on the black Phoenix flying ship once before, it was far from reaching an altitude of four hundred kilometers. Furthermore, they did not have an EVA suit at the time, so they did not stay for that long.

This time’s verification flight could basically simulate the situation on the way to the moon. If there were any problems, they would definitely be exposed, and there would be a certain degree of safety risk.

Therefore, from this perspective, the first batch of people participating in the verification flight was much more dangerous than the second batch.

Xia ruofei and the rest jumped off the black Phoenix flying ship. Chen Nanfeng went up to them and asked,””Fellow Daoist Xia, did everything go smoothly?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””No problem! Our plan should be feasible! We’ve tested the spacesuits and the spacecraft’s functions. It’s almost as we expected, so it should be able to support our return trip to the moon!”

Seeing that her soaring Flower Valley’s Elder Willow and her beloved disciple Yu xiner were unscathed, Liu Mansha’s suspended heart also relaxed. After she heard Xia ruofei’s words, she asked,””Fellow Daoist Xia, a round trip to the moon will take at least one or two months! The durability of that ship ...”

“I’ve asked the American,”Xia ruofei said with a smile,” the Dragon Ship is designed to be in orbit for at least a year, so it can be in space for a long time. This was something that Valley master Liu could rest assured about. The technological level of the secular world had long been able to reach. The peace space station’s service period was as long as 15 years, and it had been built in 1976. Human technology had already reached this level decades ago. The International Space Station that was in orbit now was also in orbit for a long time. The Dragon space station’s design and construction had used more advanced technology and materials, so it definitely wouldn’t have a problem supporting it for a few months. Unless it was hit by a meteorite or some force majeure, which caused serious damage. ”

Chen Xuan chuckled as well.”The probability of a meteorite impact is very low. I’m more worried about the space trash ... However, the space trash is mainly scattered around low – Earth orbit. Once they’re far away from earth, the space trash will be almost non – existent. Furthermore, everyone’s spiritual power is not just for show. If we really encounter an impact, we can definitely detect it in advance and avoid it!”

“If that’s the case, we can rest assured!” Chen Nanfeng said with a smile.

“It seems that fellow Daoist Xia has already considered these factors. It seems that we have been worrying for nothing!” Liu Mansha nodded with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”there are too many unknown in space. It’s necessary to plan ahead. Moreover, accidents can never be completely avoided. We still have to adapt to the situation. So, we just have to do our best to prepare. As for the risk ... If we’re afraid of the risk, why would we form this exploration team?”

Xia ruofei’s words were to Mu Sheng’s liking. He laughed heartily and said,””Cultivation is to fight against the heavens. Cultivators pursue longevity, and this in itself conflicts with the laws of the heavenly Dao! The greater the risk, the greater the opportunity. Little brother Xia, to be honest, I’m very envious of you! If I can pass the selection, even if these old bones are buried on the moon, this old man will definitely take a trip! Hahaha!”

“The Father’s legacy will be passed on to the son. It’s the same if brother Jianfei goes to the moon in your place!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Then, he turned to mu Jianfei and the others and said,””Elder mu, elder Chen, brother Jianfei, lady yurou, please board the boat! Let’s begin the second flight verification!”

Mu Hua and the other three smiled and nodded. At this moment, they were feeling much more relaxed. After all, Chen Xuan and the others had already passed through the first group.

Xia ruofei saw that the four of them had already jumped onto the flying boat, so he smiled and said to Chen Nanfeng and the others,””Three seniors, I’ll accompany elder mu and the others on another trip!”

“Thank you for your hard work!” Chen Nanfeng smiled and nodded.

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha also nodded at Xia ruofei in greeting. Mu Sheng then looked up at mu Hua and mu Jianfei who were standing by the side of the black Phoenix flying ship and loudly warned,””After you go up, pay attention to your safety. Listen to little brother Xia’s arrangements and don’t act on your own!”

“Yes!” Mu Hua and mu Jianfei quickly bowed and replied.

Xia ruofei cupped his hands at everyone and then jumped onto the flying boat.

The following procedure was the same as before. Xia ruofei steered the airboat to an altitude of 5000 meters and had everyone change into their spacesuits. Then, they headed straight for the 400 – kilometer orbit.

In the orbit, Xia ruofei released the Dragon Ship and connected it to the black Phoenix flying ship. Then, he brought everyone into the ship.

Unlike the previous time, Xia ruofei did not need to adjust the range of the black Phoenix flying ship’s shield. He only needed to activate the shield formation on the ship.

At the same time, he didn’t need to open the solar – powered sailboard, because the sailboard was always open.

Hence, Xia ruofei only used his spiritual power to remotely turn on the main power switch of the Dragon Ship. After deflating the cabin that they were entering, he opened the door and got into the ship first.
