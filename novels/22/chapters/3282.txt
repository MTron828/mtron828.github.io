3283 The strange child Daoist (2)

This was the same as the first sentence the little Daoist said to Xia ruofei when the stone door was opened. The tone, intonation, speed, and rhythm were all the same. It was like “CTRL+C” and “CTRL+V”.

Xia ruofei was almost certain that the little Daoist was not human.

This was not an insult, but a statement of an objective fact.

From the start, Xia ruofei felt that the little Daoist boy gave him a strange feeling, but he could not put his finger on it. After a few simple sentences, Xia ruofei still felt that the little Daoist boy was somewhat mechanical, or rather, rigid.

After that, Xia ruofei asked a question about the “mission”. Perhaps this keyword had triggered some response mechanism of the little Daoist boy, and he had obtained information about the “true yang temple”.

Although the answer was no longer the same as before, Xia ruofei was even more suspicious.

As a result, he did not hesitate to leave the tower at the last moment, taking the risk of never being able to enter again to test the waters.

The appearance of this little Daoist and the same words confirmed Xia ruofei’s suspicion.

Xia ruofei wasn’t trying to make things more difficult for himself. It was still very important to confirm the situation of the little Daoist. A real person and a created puppet would naturally be completely different.

Xia ruofei smiled at the little Daoist and said,””Then I’ll have to trouble little Daoist priest!”

“Scholar, please come in!” The little Daoist said indifferently, his expression still as calm as an ancient well.

As expected, it was still the same sentence.

A smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He followed the little Daoist and walked towards the door again.

“Little Daoist priest, do you have a girlfriend?”

“Scholar, please come in!”

“Little Daoist priest, have you eaten?”

“Scholar, please come in!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Little Daoist priest, how many people do you have in your family?”

“Scholar, please come in!”

“Little Daoist priest, they told me that I must be ruthless towards the previous mission. I absolutely can’t let the Lotus root break and the thread continue to pull and tug. What do you think?”

“I’ve heard that you’re exceptionally intelligent. Our true yang temple has recently encountered a Strange Matter, and I hope that you can help us dispel our doubts and solve this difficult problem. ” The little Daoist boy revealed the same expression as before and said sincerely.

As expected, the key word was “mission”. As long as they were connected, even if the meaning was completely wrong, it would trigger the little Daoist to respond accordingly.

Xia ruofei held back his laughter. He could not help but think of some weird keyword blocking mechanism ...

Of course, Xia ruofei wasn’t being mischievous. He was just trying to make a second judgment and confirmation. Now, he could finally confirm it.

This little Daoist was a man – made puppet, and its intelligence level was several streets lower than the spiritual puppet Xia Qing in the spirit map space.

Basically, this little Daoist boy was a mechanical answering machine, similar to the service robots in some scenic spots. It was triggered by keywords and then played a certain recording, that was all.

Of course, the Daoist boy’s level of realism was still quite high. At least from the outside, it was impossible to tell that he was a fake person. Even the tone of his voice was not mechanical or electronic at all. It was full of emotions.

Xia ruofei followed the Daoist boy and entered the tower again.

The stone door behind him closed slowly. This time, Xia ruofei did not run out.

Although he knew that there was no threshold set at the door of the first floor and that the little Dao child would not be angry at him for repeatedly causing trouble, he did not want to waste any more time.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not look back even after the two heavy stone doors were closed.

He followed the little Daoist boy and tried to trigger other keywords, but all he got was the same sentence,”scholar Xuanji, please come in.”

Until Xia ruofei asked,”if I help you, will there be any reward?”

Xia ruofei saw that the expression on the Daoist’s face had become more varied and knew that there was hope. The word “reward” was obviously a key word.

As expected, the little Daoist said seriously,””Our true yang temple will always express our gratitude to our friends who have helped us! If you can help us solve this problem, we’ll share an interesting secret with you ...”

“Secret? What kind of reward is this?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Mutter to himself.

After he finished speaking, he immediately showed a bitter smile. He still unconsciously treated the little Daoist boy as a normal human being, but for a moment, he forgot that the boy was not a real human. Moreover, he accidentally triggered the keyword “reward” again.

As expected, the little Daoist said in a serious tone,””Our true yang temple will always express our gratitude to our friends who have helped us! If you can help us solve this problem, we’ll share an interesting secret with you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head. He didn’t know who had left behind this tower. To be able to build such a magnificent tower, it must have been an Almighty. Why would they leave behind a puppet with such crude functions as a guide? This was not even comparable to some basic artificial intelligence in the secular world. He was simply an “artificial retard”!

Xia ruofei then tried to trigger new keywords but to no avail. In the end, he had no choice but to give up. It seemed that he had to follow the little Daoist to the destination first so that he could provide more information. Then, he could try to trigger new keywords based on the information he provided.

Although this kind of puppet with simple functions was a little speechless, it had an advantage, and that was that it would not have any precautions at all. As long as a keyword was triggered, it would definitely provide the corresponding answer.

Xia ruofei followed the little Daoist through the door and walked for a while. Suddenly, the view in front of them opened up.

The first floor of the tower was finally revealed to Xia ruofei.

This floor was more than 100 meters high, equivalent to a 30 – 40 – story building on earth, and it covered more than 10 acres.

It was completely different from what Xia ruofei had imagined. There was a mini town on the first floor.

Although it was called a small town, due to the limited space, there was only one street. On both sides of the street, there were dozens of houses of different heights. The tallest of these houses was only three stories and less than ten meters tall. Most of them were low – rise bungalows.

Between the houses on both sides of the street, there were naturally some narrow alleys. This mini – town almost took up the entire space of the first floor.

At the end of this Street was a Hill that was only 20 to 30 meters high. On the top of the hill stood a small Daoist temple, and a small path led to the Daoist temple.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power extended forward and quickly sensed that there was a board with a missing corner hanging above the door of the dilapidated Taoist temple. On it were the words “true yang temple”.

Although the plaque was broken, the three words were extraordinary. The color was a little dull and the gold powder had fallen off in many places, making the three words look very mottled. However, one could still distinguish the sharpness of the words. Even if he used his spiritual energy to examine it, Xia ruofei could still feel the aura from the three words.

It was only when they almost talked about this Taoist temple that Xia ruofei suddenly realized.

It turned out that the true yang temple that the little Daoist boy had mentioned was just a small temple on the first floor of the tower.

At first, Xia ruofei thought that the tower was called true yang temple!

The little Daoist led Xia ruofei forward without a word. Soon, the two of them stepped onto the only Street.

...

The street was paved with bluestone, giving it a simple and ancient feel.

Just as Xia ruofei stepped into the street, the door of a bungalow not far away suddenly opened. A middle – aged woman in coarse clothes came out with a basin of clothes. At the same time, there were people coming out of many houses, and there were faint footsteps coming from the deeper alleys. Xia ruofei even saw someone leading a horse and stepping onto the street. In addition, there were also some people who had set up stalls on both sides of the street. Some sold Chinese medicine, some sold general goods, and some sold breakfast.

For a time, the originally quiet and empty mini town suddenly became lively, adding a bit of human fireworks ...
