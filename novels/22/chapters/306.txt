Chapter 307: Really good material (1)

After Xia ruofei received Liang Qichao’s call last night, he knew that Liang Qichao’s father must have been feeling uneasy. Hence, he woke up early this morning and drove to the warehouse that he had rented in the city. He took out the Phoebe zhennan material from his storage space. Now that Xia ruofei’s spiritual power and control of space were much stronger than before, it was not difficult for him to take out the Phoebe zhennan material. He took a few photos with the SLR camera, and two of them even had a ruler measuring the cross – section diameter, so they were very clear. Xia ruofei even placed the camera on the tripod and took a photo with the Phoebe zhennan material with the timed camera function. Then, he took out his laptop from his interspace and extracted the photos from the SD card. He saved them on his phone and sent them to Liang Qichao through WeChat. Of course, Xia ruofei did not wait in the warehouse after taking the photos. Instead, he put the Phoebe zhennan material back into the spirit map space, locked the warehouse, and left. He could use his free time today to visit the seafood market and think about what kind of fish was suitable for raising in the farm’s fish pond. …… Shen Cheng, Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel. Liang Weimin took Liang Qichao’s phone and started to look at the photos. He looked at his phone, and his eyes brightened. The joy on his face grew, especially those photos with a tape measure. He even zoomed in and looked at them carefully a few times. Liang Weimin pointed at his phone and asked,””Little Chao, is this your friend?” “Of course!” Liang Qichao smiled and said,”dad, you should be relieved now!” Liang Weimin laughed so hard that he couldn’t close his mouth. He said, “Don’t worry, don’t worry ...”He said. These photos captured the Phoebe zhennan material from various angles and even had the size. There was even a photo of Xia ruofei with the wood. This was enough to prove that Xia ruofei had indeed found the highest quality Phoebe zhennan wood. These photos could not have been found online. Liang Weimin continued to ask,”Lil Chao, why didn’t you say so earlier?” I’ve been worried for nothing!” “Hasn’t it always been uncertain?” Liang Qichao said,”I’m afraid that if I tell you, my friend won’t be able to settle the matter. Won’t You Be more disappointed the more you wish for it?” “Does your dad look like he has such a bad mental fortitude?” Liang Weimin asked with a smile. “Yes!” Liang Qichao and Yuan Shan said in unison. “You guys ...” Liang Weimin laughed bitterly. He thought for a moment and said,”Lil Chao, you’ve done a great job this time!” I’ll reward you well when we get back! By the way, no matter what, you still have to do your best in front of uncle. If you can go to the United States follow uncle, it will be a great training and improvement for you, whether you can enter the company’s management or not!” “I see ...” Liang Qichao said with a lack of interest. Liang Weimin shook his head helplessly. He knew that his son was lazy by nature and had no interest in doing business. This time, Liang Xiaojun was trying his best to show off in front of elder Tang He, but Liang Qichao was hiding in the crowd. Liang Weimin couldn’t do anything about this. The family of three had been talking for a while, but they were already far behind the rest, so they quickly caught up. After having breakfast at the Jiahua hotel’s restaurant, they checked out and headed to the airport. Three hours later, elder Tang and the Liang family’s flight landed at the San Shan city Chang Ping International Airport. Liang Weihua had already arranged for a car to drive them out of the airport. They got into the car and headed straight to one of his warehouses in the city. The aged Phoebe zhennan material that Liang Weihua had spent so much time and effort to find was stored in that warehouse, and someone was on duty 24 hours a day. Liang Weihua’s warehouse was located in the eastern suburbs of Sanshan city. It used to be a factory, but Liang Weihua rented it out after it closed down. It was usually used to store some of the company’s goods. Four to five cars drove into the dilapidated yard outside the warehouse. A few workers immediately came up to him. Liang Weihua respectfully invited elder Tang out of the car and said,””Uncle, the wood is in the warehouse. This way, please!” Elder Tang smiled and nodded as he walked towards the warehouse with Liang Weihua. Liang Weihua’s wife and Liang Xiaojun followed closely behind. The other relatives looked on with envy, but Liang Weimin’s family looked calm as they followed closely behind with smiles on their faces. The workers opened the door of the warehouse, and a line of people walked into the warehouse. As soon as elder Tang entered, his gaze was immediately attracted by a large log placed in the middle of the warehouse. This Phoebe zhennan material was about six meters long and about one meter in diameter. It looked dark brown on the outside, but the cut surface was very bright, and traces of golden silk could be seen faintly. Elder Tang took a few steps forward and examined the wood carefully. He was slightly excited. He walked around the wood and looked back and forth for a long time before he raised his head and said with a happy face,””Wei Hua! This is authentic Aurelia wood, and there are more than ten tumors on the tree. If you cut it open, it might form water ripples!” Liang Weihua had a smug look on his face as he smiled and said,””Uncle, you have good eyes! When I first bought this Phoebe zhennan material, the other party charged me an extra 500000 Yuan for the tumor on the tree!” “Not bad, not bad ...” Elder Tang praised,”this material is really good!” “Uncle, I wonder if this material is to your liking?” Liang Weihua asked. “Although it’s a little small to be used as a longevity material, it should be enough!” Elder Tang said,”it’s very hard to find good quality Phoebe zhennan nowadays. Wei Hua, it’s already very rare for you to find such a whole piece of material. Thank you!” “Uncle, you’re too polite. It’s an honor for us juniors to share your burden!” Liang Weihua said. “How much did you spend on this?” Elder Tang asked. “About 8 million!” Liang Weihua said,”this kind of material is very popular. I added some money to the market price. Otherwise, the other party might not be willing to sell it!” Elder Tang nodded his head and gestured to his assistant. The assistant immediately took out a checkbook from his briefcase and handed it to him. When Liang Weihua saw this, he quickly asked,”uncle, what are you doing?” How can I take your money!” “Of course I have to pay!” Elder Tang said with a smile. “That’s not right!” Liang Weihua said,”uncle, this is a little filial piety from me as a junior. I definitely can’t accept this money! You can’t possibly deprive me of my right to fulfill my filial duties!” “You child ...” Elder Tang couldn’t help but laugh,”alright then! I accept your kind intentions! Thank you, Wei Hua!” Only then did Liang Weihua reveal a look of joy and said,””Uncle, don’t be so polite. This is what we, the younger generation, should do! And ... It’s all thanks to Xiaojun that we were able to find this material this time. After he found out that you needed the goldsilk Phoebe material, he went around looking for it! As soon as I heard news of the Phoebe zhennan, I immediately put down my work and rushed over. Xiaojun was the one who found this material first and informed me to buy it!” Elder Tang smiled and nodded,””Mm! Xiaojun’s a good kid, he’s got great potential!” Liang Xiaojun was secretly happy and quickly said,””Thank you for the compliment, Grandpa!” After he finished speaking, Liang Xiaojun even glanced at Liang Qichao with a smug look on his face. “Wei Hua! There are still some procedures to be done before this material can be transported out of the country. In addition, I have to arrange a cargo ship, so for the time being, the material will still be with you. You have to find someone to look after it!” Said elder Tang. “Uncle, don’t worry!” Liang Weihua said,”I’ll be guarding this place myself. There won’t be any mistakes!” Elder Tang nodded his head in satisfaction. At this moment, Yuan Shan saw the smug look on Liang Weihua’s family of three’s faces and couldn’t stand it anymore. She couldn’t help but gently tug on Liang Weimin’s sleeve. Liang Weimin nodded in understanding. He organized his words in his mind, cleared his throat, and walked forward. He said,”uncle, little Chao has also found a piece of golden Nannan material for you. It’s also a big and old material. We would also like you to take a look.”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
