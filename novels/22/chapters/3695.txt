Chapter 3696: Talent upgrade i

The disciples of the first heaven society couldn’t see it, and even the Golden core disciples like Chen Xuan couldn’t see it. However, Chen Nanfeng knew very well that after he broke through to the early nascent soul realm, the process of opening the seven Star Pavilion had become much easier.

In the past, Chen Nanfeng had to put in a lot of effort to open the seven Star Pavilion, but this time, he was able to open it without much effort.

Chen Nanfeng was also thinking,”maybe I can try to take control of the seven Star Pavilion. If I can get it to recognize me as its master, this magical treasure will definitely bring more benefits to the first heaven sect.”

Of course, now was not the time to think about this. After Chen Nanfeng opened the seven stars Pavilion, he immediately sat cross – legged on the futon and continuously injected vital Qi into the seven stars Pavilion to maintain the operation of the Dharma Treasure.

After breaking through to the nascent Soul Stage, the vital Qi in Chen Nanfeng’s body had completely liqued. Although he was still transferring vital Qi, its purity was much higher than before. Therefore, he was able to maintain the operations of the seven Star Pavilion with ease.

Upon seeing this, Chen Xuan immediately raised his voice and said,””Fellow Daoists, please enter the seven Star Pavilion in an orderly manner! Don’t worry, everyone. The probability of improving your talent has nothing to do with the time you enter the seven Star Pavilion. Don’t fight over it, just go in one by one!”

When the cultivators heard this, they started to line up.

Of course, old golden core cultivators like Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha were naturally given the front by the crowd, including Xia ruofei and Mu Sheng’s disciples.

Xia ruofei was modest, but he couldn’t persuade the cultivators. He could only stand behind Mu Sheng. He turned back and saw Shen Hu and Lu You standing in the crowd, looking very inconspicuous.

Xia ruofei did not ask Shen Hu to come along. After all, as long as one entered the seven Star Pavilion, there was a certain chance of improving one’s talent. It did not make a difference whether one entered a few minutes earlier or later.

Everyone strode towards the main entrance of the seven Star Pavilion.

Xia ruofei followed behind Mu Sheng and soon arrived at the main entrance of the seven Star Pavilion.

Mu Sheng turned around and grinned,””Little brother Xia, I wish you luck! You’re so talented. If you can improve a little, your future achievements will be limitless!”

“Thank you for your kind words!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I also wish senior mu the best in improving your talent!”

“Hahaha! I’m already at this age, and my body has already started to go downhill. It’s no longer important whether my talent improves or not.” Mu Sheng laughed heartily and said,”the nascent Soul Stage is too far away for me. As long as I can break through to the late golden core stage and enjoy another 100 years of life, I’ll be satisfied! As for the juniors like Jian Fei, it would be great if they could improve their talents!”

“It’ll definitely work! If even a young talent like brother Jian Fei can’t get the seven Star Pavilion’s recognition, who else can?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Hahaha! Then I’ll really have to count on your blessings!” Mu Sheng said.

There was a group of cultivators waiting behind them, so Mu Sheng and Xia ruofei naturally could not just stand at the door and chat. The two of them quickly walked into the seven Star Pavilion.

When Xia ruofei entered the seven stars Pavilion, Chen Nanfeng, who had been sitting cross – legged with his eyes closed, could not help but open his eyes slightly. He raised his eyebrows, but very quickly, he closed his eyes again like an old monk in meditation. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The moment Xia ruofei stepped into the seven Star Pavilion, he felt a slight pulling force.

For Xia ruofei, who often entered and exited the spirit map space, this feeling was very familiar, so he did not panic.

Xia ruofei had already expected that the seven Star Pavilion would have its own space.

Otherwise, even if the seven Star Pavilion expanded, it would not be able to accommodate more than a hundred cultivators. Even if everyone forced their way in, would it still be possible to squeeze in?

After a slight pulling force, Xia ruofei found himself in a chaotic space. There was fog two meters around him that even his spiritual power could not penetrate.

Mu Sheng, who had entered the seven Star Pavilion right after him, was not nearby at this time. Obviously, there were many small spaces in the seven Star Pavilion. After every cultivator entered, they would be sent to an independent small space, and they would not interfere with each other.

Xia ruofei wasn’t particularly curious. In fact, he could do it if he was in the spirit map space.

To Xia ruofei, it was as simple as a thought to build one or two hundred small spaces in the spirit map and then send people into the small spaces.

Xia ruofei looked around and used his spiritual power to check the surroundings. When he realized that his spiritual power could not penetrate the fog, he decided not to waste any more time and sat down cross – legged on the spot.

After adjusting his state, Xia ruofei took out a crystal from the spirit map space and held it in his hand. He closed his eyes and started to cultivate the great Dao Sutra.

Through Chen Xuan, Xia ruofei had gained a certain understanding of the seven Star Pavilion. He knew that when one circulated their cultivation technique in the seven Star Pavilion, they would be absorbing the vital Qi that Chen Nanfeng, who was controlling the seven Star Pavilion, had injected.

Therefore, he naturally wouldn’t directly start absorbing it without a care.

One had to know that the great Dao Arts were different from those ordinary cultivation techniques. Once he started cultivating, the consumption of spirit Qi was not something that ordinary small sects could afford. If he absorbed it directly, it would definitely greatly increase Chen Nanfeng’s burden..
