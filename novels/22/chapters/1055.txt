Chapter 1056: Chapter 670 – selling like crazy_2

Translator: 549690339

In other words, the standard for a two – headed abalone was that the weight of a single abalone reached or exceeded 302.4 grams.

The weight of the three abalones was very close to 600 grams. The heaviest one was only five grams away from one Sima Jin, which was no different from an abalone. The other two were also very close.

However, because of the difference of a few grams to a dozen grams, strictly speaking, it could only be regarded as a super large two – headed abalone, which was much less valuable.

Lu zhongguang smiled and announced,”the three abalones will be auctioned in one batch. The top three bidders will get the item. The highest bidder will get the heaviest one, and so on!” Of course, if you really like these three abalones, you can also bid multiple times. If your bids are all in the top three, then congratulations, you will be able to win all three abalones!”

“I believe everyone is clear about the rules of the first auction. Let’s start the auction!” Lu zhongguang said,”the first batch of three abalones has a starting price of 800000 Hong Kong dollars. Each increment must not be less than 10000 Hong Kong dollars. Please make your bids!”

“The gentleman in number 214 has bid 820000 Hong Kong dollars!”

“The gentleman in number 186 has bid 830000 Hong Kong dollars!”

“Ms. Chen from the VIP area has made two bids, 880000 and 900000 respectively! It seemed that Ms. Chen was also very interested in this batch of top – grade abalones! Are there any higher bids?”

“The lady in number 39 has bid 910000 Hong Kong dollars! Your vision is too good! Guests, this is a rare opportunity, so don’t hesitate!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

As soon as the auction began, everyone was very enthusiastic about bidding. Lu zhongguang’s gentle temperament had also changed. His tone was full of passion and his voice was very high, even a little hoarse.

He was an experienced auctioneer and knew how to mobilize everyone’s emotions and stimulate everyone’s desire to bid.

Of course, he didn’t actually need to deliberately stir up the mood. The guests were still quite enthusiastic in bidding.

Because most people were not rich, there were many middle – Class or slightly rich families, as well as some seafood restaurant owners and seafood store owners who heard the news.

These people had limited financial resources. They knew very well that the three abalones were auctioned based on the market price of two – headed abalones. In fact, their quality and weight were very close to that of one – headed abalones, so the price – Performance ratio was very high.

In addition, more than a dozen super – rich people had come today. The poorest of the 30 people in the VIP area had a net worth of more than one or two billion. Once the rich people in the VIP area bid for the one – Head abalone, it was basically impossible for the people from the ordinary areas to compete with them.

And as the auction progressed, the price would definitely get higher and higher.

As the number of one – headed abalones decreased, their weight also increased, so the price would inevitably rise.

Hence, many of the guests in the normal server wanted to grab the opportunity before them.

However, when most people had such thoughts, the price was destined to not be too low.

Very soon, the highest price had broken through one million HKD, and the third – highest price had reached 960000.

Everyone’s enthusiasm was still very high because even a million Hong Kong dollars was still quite cost – effective.

Without Lu zhongguang’s encouragement, the top three prices broke through one million Hong Kong dollars very quickly. The highest price even reached 1.2 million Hong Kong dollars.

Only then did the frequency of bidding gradually slow down. Lu zhongguang could finally catch his breath. He had been talking at a very high frequency just now. Sometimes, the bidding was so fast that he didn’t even have time to bid. Soon, new bids would appear, which was a bit too much for an experienced auctioneer like him to take in.

Lu zhongguang was also secretly amazed,’this is crazy!

Of course, Lu zhongguang knew very well that this madness was only an appetizer. The real feast was the one – headed abalone auction later, especially the three heaviest one – headed abalones, which would probably be auctioned for a sky – High price!

In the end, the three extra – large two – headed abalones were sold for 1.89 million, 1.87 million, and 1.86 million Hong Kong dollars respectively.

The three abalones were filmed by the owner of a good advertising company and the owner of two seafood restaurants.

The three people who won the bid were still very happy to buy an abalone at such a high price. The people around them were also very envious. Some people even secretly regretted that they didn’t clench their teeth and bid again.

Ms. Chen in the VIP area gave up on bidding for 1.5 million Hong Kong dollars. In fact, she did not want to participate in the auction because the real target of the rich people in the VIP area was the one – headed abalone at the back.

Lu zhongguang’s back was already drenched in sweat. His shirt was sticky to the touch, but he was in high spirits.

“Congratulations to the three of you!” Lu zhongguang said,”I also want to thank everyone for bringing a good start to the auction! Let’s start the auction for the one – headed abalone!”

Lu zhongguang looked at the prompt card in his hand and said,””There are a total of 21 top – Quality one – headed abalones in this auction, and their weights range from 610 to 650 grams! Let’s start with the first one! Its weight was 611.5 grams! The starting price was 1.5 million Hong Kong dollars! Every bid must be at least 30000 Hong Kong dollars! Please place your bids!”

Although this one – headed abalone was only a dozen grams heavier than the two – headed abalone that had just been auctioned, the starting price was almost double.
