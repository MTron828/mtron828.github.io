Chapter 604: The tea King takes action (2)

Xia ruofei quickly got into the driver’s seat.

Niu Yusheng and Li Guizhi were worried about li Zhifu’s health, so they quickly closed the door and got in the car together.

The Knight XV started moving. Li Zhifu guided Xia ruofei out of the town. After ten minutes, they arrived at the entrance of a small tea factory.

Although it was called a tea factory, it was rather small and looked like a family workshop.

Li Zhifu stuck his head out of the window and shouted,””Gen ‘er! Open the door!”

A simple and honest middle – aged man walked out. When he saw li Zhifu in the car, he quickly opened the iron gate and Xia ruofei drove into the courtyard.

The middle – aged man slightly raised his head and looked at li Zhifu in the car. He said in surprise,””Master, why are you here?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Can I borrow your weapon for a while?” asked li Zhifu.

The middle – aged man was surprised and happy.”Master, you’re going to personally make tea?”

“Of course!” Li Zhifu said unhappily.

At that moment, ye Lingyun had already gotten out of the car and walked to li Zhifu’s side. He opened the door and helped the old man out.

Xia ruofei and the others also got out of the car. Li Zhifu pointed at the middle – aged man and said,””Little Xia, let me introduce you. This is the owner of this tea factory, yang Shugen. In his early years, he learned how to make tea from me for a while. Gen ‘er, this is Xiao Xia from the three mountains. I’m going to help him make a batch of tea leaves today. ”

Xia ruofei understood immediately. Yang Shugen was not li Zhifu’s official disciple, but he had learned how to make tea from li Zhifu. However, from yang Shugen’s behavior, he was quite respectful to li Zhifu.

......

“Hello, boss yang. Sorry for the trouble.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“No trouble, no trouble ... Master’s business is my business. You’re welcome, boss Xia ...” Yang tree root said quickly.

“Alright, alright, you guys don’t have to talk about these useless things!” Li Zhifu said impatiently,”Ling Yun, go and get the fresh leaves. We need to dry them quickly!”

“Alright!” “Yes,” ye Lingyun replied excitedly and quickly went to get a big bag of Tea Green out of the car.

Without waiting for li Zhifu’s instructions, Yang Shu ran into the house and took out a few large bamboo water sieves.

Under li Zhifu’s instructions, ye Lingyun and yang tree root poured the tea Green onto a bamboo water sieve and spread it evenly.

The six catties of fresh leaves used up four bamboo water sieves in total.

Then, Yang Shu and ye Lingyun worked together to carry the bamboo water sieve to an empty field outside the yard. There was a row of shelves here, and they placed the bamboo water sieve on the shelves.

Li Zhifu looked at his watch and recorded the time. Then, he said to Xia ruofei,””Little Xia, the sun is just right now. Let’s use natural sunlight to dry it first, then heat it up indoors to wilting it!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ll leave xianye to you. You have the final say!”

Li Zhifu smiled and nodded.

At this moment, the root of the Poplar tree walked in, while ye Lingyun stayed outside to look at the tea leaves. These were Xia ruofei’s tea leaves, personally made by li Zhifu. Ye Lingyun did not dare to leave for even a moment in fear of any mishaps.

“Gen ‘er, go and start a fire. We’ll start heating it up and withering it later!” Li Zhifu said.

“Yes, master!” Yang tree root said immediately, then turned around and walked into the house.

“Wait a minute, Gen ‘er. Make a bed for me after you’re done with the fire,” li Zhifu called out.

Yang Shugen was stunned for a moment. He turned around and asked,””Master, you ... You’re going to stay up all night? Your body ...”

“I told you to do it and you did it! What nonsense are you spouting?” Li Zhifu said impatiently.

“I know ...” Yang Shugen said with a bitter smile.

After Yang Shugen left, li Zhifu said,””Gen ‘er is a good person, but he’s a bit naggy sometimes ... There aren’t many people who insist on making tea by hand these days because the production isn’t up to standard. Those big tea factories are all equipped with machines, and I’m angry just looking at it! Gen ‘er has been insisting on making tea by hand for more than 20 years. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old Mr. Li, Mr. Yang is just being filial. That’s why he’s advising you ...”

“I know my own body.” Li Zhifu waved his hand and said,”besides, don’t we have a godly doctor like you here?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded.

The two of them sat in the courtyard and chatted, and time passed quietly.

At around twoo’ clock, li Zhifu stood up and shouted,””Ling Yun, Gen ‘er, bring Cha Qing in!”

Ye Lingyun and the Poplar tree root worked together to carry the bamboo water sieve into a room. Xia ruofei followed behind. As soon as he entered the room, he felt a warm sensation. The Poplar tree root had already placed a few charcoal basins in the room in advance. The charcoal in them was burning vigorously.

There was a row of large shelves in the house. Yang Shenshen and ye Lingyun placed the bamboo water sieves on the shelves. They only left together after all four bamboo water sieves were moved in.

The tea Green needed some time to wither, so he could only wait.

Yang Shenshen brought out some chairs and asked his wife to bring some peanuts, melon seeds, and so on to the stone table in the courtyard. Everyone sat around in the courtyard and chatted.

At around 3:40 am, li Zhifu got up for the third time and went into the house to check. Finally, he felt that the fire was ready, so yang Shenshen and ye Lingyun went to carry out the bamboo water sieve.

Li Zhifu asked ye Lingyun to put the tea leaves in the two bamboo water sieves together. There were only two bamboo water sieves left.
