Lin Zhongming paused and said with resentment,”Manager Chen left us as soon as he came. After seeing this batch of wormgrass, he offered President Xia a purchase price of 500000 Yuan. As you can see, the negotiation couldn’t go on!”

Zheng Xu slapped the table and said,”” 500 thousand? Wasn’t this nonsense? Does he even understand the business?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”CEO Tang, researcher Zheng, I’m not sure if Chen shun is familiar with this business. However, the purchasing Specialist he brought with him personally appraised this batch of wormgrass and agreed with brother Lin’s initial offer. Although he spoke very softly, I happen to have sharp ears and accidentally heard it ... However, Chen shun still gave such an outrageous price after listening to the purchasing specialist’s opinion. It’s a little confusing ...”

Although Tang weiran had a rough idea of what had happened, she had only heard about it. Now that Zheng Xu had personally identified this batch of wormgrass and agreed with the price set by Lin Zhongming, and Chen shun’s price was lower by 250000 Yuan, which was equivalent to cutting it by one – third, Tang weiran felt more intuitively.

Moreover, the details that Xia ruofei had mentioned were even more thought – provoking now that he thought about it.

Tang weiran’s face darkened and she said,”you’re treating work like a game!” This time, it must be dealt with seriously! No matter who was involved, they would be punished and dismissed! It’s time to clean up the chain company’s atmosphere!”

Tang weiran’s words had basically confirmed Chen shun’s fate. Unsurprisingly, Chen Weinan would also be affected. He was a big fish, enough to stir up the chain companies ...

Xia ruofei ignored Tang weiran’s flattery and said with a smile,””President Tang, if you have no doubts about the quality of aweto, then we can talk about our cooperation ...” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“No doubt!” Tang Wei Ran quickly said.

Although Xia ruofei had only taken out a sample, he knew that Xia ruofei would not play any tricks. After all, everything had to be checked before the agreement was signed. There was no point in playing any tricks now.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”brother Lin gave us a price. It’s 750000 Yuan per kilogram ...”

“Our Tongren Hall is very interested in this batch of wormgrass. I can make the decision to increase the unit price by 30000 Yuan and buy them at 780000 Yuan!” Tang weiran didn’t wait for Xia ruofei to finish and said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei was also speechless. In fact, he just wanted to continue the transaction at this price, but Tang weiran raised the purchase price himself. Xia ruofei couldn’t refuse the money that came to his door.

He nodded and said,”I have no objections to this price, but ...”

“I understand, President Xia!” Tang weiran interrupted Xia ruofei again and said,”we will deal with Chen shun and Chen Weinan quickly and seriously. I will report to Chairman Wei immediately and we will have the preliminary opinions by today!” We can sign the contract tomorrow. ”

Xia ruofei’s face was full of black lines. When did I want to talk about Chen shun?

In fact, Xia ruofei wanted to propose two conditions, but Tang weiran thought that he understood Xia ruofei’s mind, so he successfully interrupted him again.

After all, in Tang weiran’s heart, Xia ruofei was already a second generation and was probably a very powerful person among the second generation. In his opinion, such a person might not care much about money, but he would definitely care a lot about face.

Tang weiran looked at Xia ruofei expectantly. He felt that Xia ruofei was sincere enough. Not only did she raise the price, but it was already evening. It was definitely unprecedented for a state – owned enterprise to settle the deal today.

Xia ruofei could only follow Tang weiran’s words helplessly. He nodded and said,””Alright, we’ll talk about the contract tomorrow. But ... I have two more conditions that I hope President tang can agree to.”

“Please speak, President Xia!” Tang Wei Ran said nervously.

He was worried that Xia ruofei was still not satisfied. If she came up with more difficult conditions, he would be in a dilemma again.

Speaking of which, as a Department – Level leader of a state – owned enterprise, this trip was also quite sullen.

However, Tang weiran was the group leader in charge of the chain company. He was not responsible for the chain company’s problems. Moreover, he was Wei Jianming’s confidant. This kind of thankless job was ordered by Wei Jianming, so he had to do it.

Xia ruofei smiled.”First, we hope that we can pay the bulk of the goods as soon as possible after the agreement is signed. To be specific, we hope that we can pay at least 100 million in four days.”

Tang weiran was slightly relieved. Tongren Tang had branches all over the country, so its cash flow was quite abundant. Even if they paid in full, there would be no problem. Four days would be enough.

“That’s not a problem, I can agree to it right now!”He immediately replied.

“Then, thank you, President Tang.” Xia ruofei said,”as for the second point, I hope that the main body of the contract with us is not the chain company or the Tongren Tang Group, but the East China region. To be exact, I hope to sign with brother Lin.”
