Xia ruofei returned to the original space and fished out the vegetable seeds from the petal solution. He separated them and poured them on different plastic sheets to dry. Then, he left the spirit map space with a thought. It was almost FiveO’ clock in the evening when he arrived outside. Xia ruofei flew to the bathroom to wash off her stinky sweat, changed into clean clothes, and went downstairs. He drove the pickup truck around the orchard. Cao tieshu and the rest had already planted the fruit trees. Xia ruofei looked at the sparse rows of lychee trees. He could almost see the scene of the next summer when the rows of lush lychee trees would be covered with red lychees. After he got out of the car, he walked around the orchard and saw that the leaves of the lychee sapling were dripping with water. He knew that Cao tieshu must have followed his instructions and turned on the irrigation system after planting the tree to water the lychee sapling. Xia ruofei was also relieved and drove back to the villa. Ye Lingyun had already prepared dinner. Seeing that Xia ruofei had returned, he quickly called for him to eat. Seeing ye Lingyun in an apron, Xia ruofei thought that it was not good to keep asking ye Lingyun to be a chef. It was better to hire a nanny. Otherwise, not only would ye Lingyun have to prepare three meals a day, but he would also have to consciously and diligently clean the villa. One must know that the villa was not small, and it was quite tiring to clean it once. Moreover, he had invited ye Lingyun over to be in charge of security, not to take care of his daily needs. However, Xia ruofei was not used to living with other people. Besides, he had a secret that he could not let anyone know about his spirit map. He thought that it would be better to wait for a while and hire a nanny after the staff apartment was built. Anyway, the villa was not far from the employees ‘apartment. It would be convenient for the nanny to come over to clean and cook when the time came. The two of them sat facing each other. Xia ruofei asked as he ate,””Ling Yun, how’s the progress regarding the matter of me asking you to look for a few security personnel?” “Brother Xia, there’s not much work to do now. I can handle it on my own.” Ye linyun said. Xia ruofei put down his bowl and said seriously,””Ling Yun, this isn’t a matter of being busy. The company is currently developing very quickly, and the security Department can’t just be a bare – handed commander forever. Sooner or later, we’ll have to recruit more people. We should start training the core members now. In the future, other than you, there should be some capable middle – Level backbones in the security Department, so it’s necessary to recruit a few trustworthy and capable people. It’s best if they’re retired soldiers!” Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, ye Lingyun said in embarrassment,””I know, brother Xia. After you told me last time, I contacted a few of my comrades, but I thought I could handle this alone, so I didn’t rush them ...” “Then you better hold on tight!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s not delay this matter.” “Yes!” Xia ruofei knew that ye Lingyun was trying to save money for him and did not mean to delay the dinner on purpose. Hence, he did not reprimand him and continued eating. After dinner, Xia ruofei went back to his room and turned on his computer to search for the Shandong cherry sapling. He was going to buy a batch of saplings online. In addition, he also had to look up some information and carefully consider what fish to raise in the fish pond on the farm. In principle, he still wanted to go for the high – Quality route, so he had to choose fish that were relatively difficult to raise and had a high market price. Just as Xia ruofei was searching for information on the internet, Liang Qichao and his family had arrived at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport. Today, the International flight that Liang Qichao’s grandfather took would arrive at Shen Cheng International Airport. Liang Qichao’s father, Liang Weimin, also took it very seriously. The whole family of three was there to receive him. In fact, Liang Qichao’s family was not the only one who had come to pick them up. There were more than a dozen relatives from his family, including Liang Qichao’s uncle, Liang Weihua. His family of three was also at the airport. Among the group of people who were there to pick him up, Liang Weihua was the most satisfied one. He couldn’t help but smile. He was the relative that Liang Qichao had told him about who had found a piece of Phoebe zhennan material for the old man. This time, the old man had decided to rush back to China after seeing the photo of the Phoebe zhennan material that Liang Weihua had sent. From this, it could be seen how much importance the old man placed on this material. If the old man was satisfied after seeing the real thing, Liang Weihua would undoubtedly gain a lot of points in his heart. The old man’s name was Tang He. He was a cousin of Liang Weimin and Liang Weihua’s grandmothers. Tang He’s father was their grandmothers ‘cousin. Speaking of which, this family relationship was actually a little distant, but elder Tang didn’t have any other relatives in his generation. Only Liang Weimin’s family was more prosperous. In addition, although elder Tang had gone overseas, he had always supported his only relative in the country financially, so they were much closer than ordinary distant relatives. Elder Tang had worked hard in the United States for decades and built up a huge family business. He was also a little famous in the Chinese circle in North America. He even married three wives, but because of his health, he had no children. Now that his three wives were no longer alive, he was all alone. This made him value these relatives in the country even more. In other words, from a legal perspective, elder Tang’s assets worth tens of billions of dollars would be inherited by his distant relatives in China after he passed away. Elder Tang didn’t hide anything. He even publicly announced that he wouldn’t learn from some rich people in the United States and donate their huge assets to charity organizations. The old man’s exact words were,”why should I donate my hard – earned family business to those foreigners?” These relatives in the country were also well aware of this, so they all thought of ways to please the old man, because in the end, who could get the money and how much money could be divided was completely decided by the old man. If the old man could add his name in his will, it would definitely be a huge fortune that could guarantee a lifetime of prosperity. Moreover, when the old man returned to the country this time, he had specifically said that he wanted to see if there were any outstanding relatives and juniors in the country. He seemed to have the intention of bringing a junior of the family to the United States to train and slowly take over the company in the future. It should be known that the US dollars could be divided, the real estate could be divided, and the shares could be divided, but the company could not be divided. Although it could be entrusted to a professional manager to manage, if the child of any family could be valued by the old man and enter the company’s management, it would undoubtedly have a huge advantage in the future. This was also one of the important reasons why Liang Weimin, Liang Weihua, and the others valued the old man’s return trip so much. They also brought their children with them. Liang Weihua’s son, Liang Xiaojun, graduated from a famous university and went to the United States to study. He obtained an MBA from his studies in business and Administration. During his time in the United States, Liang Xiaojun and elder Tang naturally came into contact frequently. Thus, he still had an advantage over elder Tang. Furthermore, Liang Weihua had gotten ahead of Liang Weimin this time and had found the material of Phoebe zhennan that the old man had been dreaming of for a long time. This made Liang Weihua even more smug. As the group of people waited at the airport, Liang Weihua had a victorious look on his face as he chatted with his relatives. Liang Xiaojun also smiled as he spoke to his relatives. It was as if he had already become elder Tang’s choice to go to America. From time to time, Liang Xiaojun would look at Liang Qichao arrogantly, as if he was a winner. He obviously thought that he had a high chance of winning this time. In contrast, Liang Weimin’s face was full of worry, and he frowned from time to time. He felt like he was falling behind by one step. Especially when he saw his son Liang Qichao’s nonchalant and heartless look, Liang Weimin was even more furious. However, in front of so many relatives, Liang Weimin, who cared about his reputation, couldn’t scold his son. In the end, he could only sulk by himself. In reality, Liang Qichao was not completely unconcerned about these things. It was just that he had a big secret that even his father, Liang Weimin, did not tell him. Xia ruofei had helped him find a bigger and better quality piece of aged Phoebe zhennan material. He believed that with this piece of Phoebe zhennan, Liang Weihua’s family’s so – called advantage would be gone. Time passed by. Finally, the large dynamic screen of the airport showed that the International flight from New York to Shen Cheng had landed. At the same time, the broadcast of the International departure hall sounded.
