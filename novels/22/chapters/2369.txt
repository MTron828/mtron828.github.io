2370 The high priest (1)

As expected! Xia ruofei was also excited.

Usually, he would turn off the external sensors of the spirit map space, and he did not want Bai Qingqing to see his every move.

In the past, Xia ruofei did not care much about it. Other than when he was doing some embarrassing things with his woman, he would seal off the space to sense the outside world. The rest of the time, it was open.

At that time, only Xia Qing and Bai Qingqing would be able to sense the situation outside.

Xia Qing was only a soul puppet and not a real human. She was loyal to Xia ruofei and would never betray him.

At that time, Bai Qingqing had not evolved yet. In Xia ruofei’s eyes, she was just a little spiritual pet.

However, after Bai Qingqing’s evolution, she was able to communicate telepathically in the human language. She had even given herself a name.

Other than the fact that she still looked like a civet cat and that her vocal cords could not produce a human voice, Bai Qingqing was a completely different person in Xia ruofei’s heart.

Since then, Xia ruofei had sealed off the external sensing passage. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Otherwise, Bai Qingqing would have been able to sense the existence of the world stone before he even entered the temple. She would not have needed to wait until he was so close.

Of course, there were still some benefits to this ...

Xia ruofei said telepathically,”don’t cry. I noticed it a long time ago. I’m so close to you and I still can’t see it. Don’t you think you’re underestimating me?”

Bai Qingqing was stunned for a moment, then said in an unfriendly tone,””Don’t tell me that the world stones this time ...”

“You’re right!” Xia ruofei replied matter – of – factly,”I discovered the world stone by myself. Of course, I’m the only one who can enjoy it!”

Bai Qingqing shouted in exasperation,””Xia ruofei! You bastard! I think you’re just unable to confirm it yourself, so you deliberately opened the spatial sensing channel! You’re using me to confirm it, aren’t you?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”Bai Qingqing, you’re being too mean. You’re being too mean.” I activated my spatial senses purely because I wanted to share this good news with you! How can I not be sure when I’m so close? The world stone is to my North. It’s at most a hundred meters away, right?”

“You ...” Bai Qingqing was so angry that she could not speak.

Xia ruofei laughed evilly and said,”so, you didn’t put in any effort in the process of finding the world stone!” According to our previous agreement ...”

“You’ve completely sealed off the spatial sensing channel. How am I supposed to help?” Bai Qingqing retorted Xia ruofei in a bad mood.

Xia ruofei touched his nose awkwardly and said,””The main thing is that the difficulty level is too low this time. I can find it myself without you ...”

“Tsk! I think you’re just a blind cat that got lucky!” Bai Qingqing said disdainfully,”you must have something else to do. I didn’t expect you to be so lucky that the world stone was so close to you, so you found it! If you really came here to look for world stones, would you not use my ability?”

Xia ruofei laughed drily and said,””What blind cat and dead mouse? Bai Qingqing, please watch your words! After all, cats are your close relatives! How can you say that?”

Bai Qingqing’s appearance was really that of a gentle civet cat, and she was actually related to cats.

However, Bai Qingqing did not agree with this view.

“You’re the cat!”It was mad. Your whole family are cats!”

Xia ruofei laughed out loud and shut off the spatial link, sealing Bai Qingqing’s curses in the space. He could not hear anything.

In fact, Xia ruofei would never keep all the food to himself. It was just that every time he talked to Bai Qingqing, he couldn’t help but want to tease her. Seeing her stomping her feet in anger, Xia ruofei felt inexplicably happy ...

After their Daily Banter, Xia ruofei turned his attention to the seemingly ordinary courtyard.

It seemed like this Satan, the leader of the modr organization, who had transformed into the high priest of arulei, still had many secrets!

He actually had such a good item like the world stone ... However, it was unknown if he was clear about the value of the world stone. Was he collecting it unintentionally, or was he really keeping it as a treasure?

If it was the latter, then could this high priest be related to the cultivation world?

Although it was almost impossible for an African native to have an intimate relationship with a Sage – like cultivator, Xia ruofei had to be careful.

Strategically, they looked down on the enemy, but tactically, they paid attention to the enemy. They could never underestimate the enemy at any time.

Xia ruofei kept his relaxed attitude and walked towards the small courtyard.

……

This was an extremely ordinary – looking courtyard.

It was a low – rise bungalow that was completely white. There were two rooms on the left and right, and a small living room in the middle. It was similar to the bungalow in northern China.

A bald black man wearing arulei’s traditional robe was sitting in the hall with a slight frown. From the wrinkles and eye bags on his face, he should not be young, but his eyes were quite spirited, and the cold aura that he inadvertently emitted was enough to make an ordinary person’s heart turn cold.

He was the highly respected high priest manchila in arulei, and also the fearsome leader of the modr, Satan.

There was a young man standing beside manchila.

If Xia ruofei were to see him, he would be shocked. Jian Jia was his new friend from Ethiopia. They had just met at the temple, but Xia ruofei had changed his appearance, so they did not interact much.

Earlier, Xia ruofei was walking around and did not pay much attention to Dhaka. He would not have known that Dhaka had already walked ahead of him and directly came to the small courtyard where high priest manchila was.

Manchila’s fingers tapped rhythmically on the table as he asked indifferently,””Daka, I’ve seen the things you brought back this time. They are all useless waste paper! How should I punish you?”

Darka revealed a terrified expression and said in fear and trepidation,””High priest, I ... I’ve tried my best to collect them. I found a lot of ancient Chinese books for you while I was studying abroad. This time, someone sent me an email, so I immediately flew to China to trade with them. According to my understanding of Chinese culture, this ancient book is genuine ...”

“What’s the use of the real thing? I don’t need its contents!” Manchila said coldly,”Daka, everything you have today was given to you by me. Have you forgotten?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Daka quickly replied. If it wasn’t for the high priest, Dhaka would have starved to death in the famine. It was you who taught me the mysterious Eastern Arts and paid me to study in China. Dhaka’s life belongs to the high priest, how can I not do my best for you?”

Seeing how Daka was in fear and trepidation, manchila’s expression also softened a little. He said,””It’s good that you know. I’ll let it go this time ...”

“Thank you, high priest!” Said Daka as he bowed.

Manchila said indifferently,”you have to continue to pay attention to the news in China. As long as there are ancient Chinese books for sale, especially those related to Chinese Taoism, you must buy them at all costs. Money is not a problem!”

“Yes, high priest!” Daka replied respectfully.

Manchila frowned slightly as if he was thinking about something. Beside him, Daka also did not dare to disturb him and stood quietly beside him with his hands by his side.

Manchila was indeed a little frustrated now. The modr organization that he had single – handedly founded could be said to be well – known in inland Africa, but it had suffered a great defeat yesterday. The training camp set up in the town of Basoko had actually exploded, and what was even stranger was that everyone in the training camp had disappeared for no reason.

This morning, after getting the news from his own channel, manchila immediately sent his trusted aide, Boak, to investigate.

Looking at the time, boack should have arrived at Basoko town a long time ago.

However, he had not received a single call from Boak.

Regardless of whether they found any clues, they should at least report it to him!

Manchila cursed in his heart,’what the hell is this idiot doing?

He was in a bad mood, so his expression naturally showed on his face. At the side, Daka did not even dare to breathe loudly. He stood at the side with his head slightly lowered, as if he was mourning in silence ...

Manchila thought for a while and said,””Daka, there’s something I need you to do for me!”

“High priest, please give me your orders!” Said Daka quickly.

Manchila said,”I have a friend who has a security company that got into trouble. There was an explosion at the company’s training base in the town of Basoko. There are also people missing. Go to the town of Basoko immediately and see if you can find any clues.”

“Yes, high priest!” Said Daka without hesitation.

“Report to me directly if you find anything,” manchila said.

“Understood!” Daka said.

Manchila pondered for a moment, then took out a small and exquisite wooden token and handed it to Daka.

“This is my token,” manchila said.”Take it first.”

Daka didn’t dare to ask any more questions and quickly kept the wooden tablet with complicated patterns.

“Aside from looking for clues about the explosion in the training base,” manchila said,”you should also keep an eye on whether or not bowack is there.”

Darka was stunned and asked,”Boak?” You mean the boss of the qika company ...”

The Cicca company was a trading company set up by boack to hide his identity. In arulei, a small country in Africa with a backward economy, it was quite famous. When Dhaka heard the name, he immediately remembered it.

“That’s right, it’s him,” Manchila said,”if you see him, tell him that I’m looking for him and ask him to contact me immediately. As long as you show him that wooden token, he’ll believe you. ”

“Alright, high priest!” Daka said respectfully,”I’ve remembered everything you’ve said! Then ... I’ll leave now?”

Manchila nodded and said,”go!” “I believe in your abilities, so there won’t be any danger. Contact me as soon as you reach Basoko town ...”

“Yes!” Said Darka as he bowed.

Just as Daka was about to take his leave, manchila suddenly raised his hand, and his sharp gaze swept towards the tightly shut courtyard door.””Wait! Daka, please help me open the door! There’s a guest ...”
