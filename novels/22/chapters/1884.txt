Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue expressed their gratitude with a smile.

After Bastian left, Cheng Xiaoxiao patted her chest and said with a lingering fear,””I was so scared ... I thought I was going to lose my job! President Xia, thank you so much for this! You’re indeed my idol! You’ve never disappointed us fans! President Xia, I will be your loyal fan for life! I’ll go to the forum and tell everyone about today’s events!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He couldn’t wait for the popularity to drop! The days when he had to wear a mask and sunglasses when he went out were really not free. However, Cheng Xiaoxiao was so enthusiastic, so he didn’t want to dampen her enthusiasm. He could only smile awkwardly and express his gratitude.

Cheng Xiaoxiao added,”by the way, there’s a Tieba named after you, and it has a lot of active fans every day. Can you go up and say hello to everyone?” Everyone will be very excited when they see it! Although there are a few hardcore fan organizations now, they are all spontaneous actions after all. No one has as much appeal as you do!”

Xia ruofei said,”this ... Okay!” I’ll go and take a look when I have time. Thank you for your support ...”

Xia ruofei’s reply was obviously perfunctory, and Cheng Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed.

Ling Qingxue, who was at the side, saw this and said with a smile,””Xiaoxiao, don’t worry! I’ll agree on ruofei’s behalf!”

“Really?” Cheng Xiaoxiao was overjoyed.”President Ling’s words will definitely work!” I thank you on behalf of the fans!”

Xia ruofei was speechless. What did he mean by ‘President Ling’s words will definitely work’? Do I look like a henpecked husband to you?

Seeing Xia ruofei’s defeated look, Ling Qingxue could not help but smile.

Cheng Xiaoxiao reacted at this time and quickly said,””By the way, you haven’t ordered anything yet! It’s all my fault. I was too excited to see President Xia and forgot about the important thing!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. We’ll pick the one you think is most suitable for us!”

“Can I really?” Cheng Xiaoxiao asked,”then ... Then I’ll help you order!”

Cheng Xiaoxiao was naturally quite excited to be able to pair her idol with a dish.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Okay, I’ll leave it to you to decide what we want to eat!”

“Alright!” Cheng Xiaoxiao looked as if she had just received a glorious and great mission. She puffed out her chest and said,”don’t worry, President Xia. I’ll definitely choose them carefully and guarantee that I won’t let you down!”

Then, Cheng Xiaoxiao reluctantly left the table.

Xia ruofei looked at Cheng Xiaoxiao’s back and then at Ling Qingxue, who was trying to hold back her laughter. He said in a bad mood,””If you want to laugh, then laugh! The King’s Woman!”

When Ling Qingxue heard the nickname that the netizens had given her, she couldn’t help but blush. Then, she burst into laughter.

“Qingxue,” Xia ruofei continued to complain,”why did you agree to Cheng Xiaoxiao just now?”

“What?” Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment, then she reacted.”You’re talking about going to the Tieba to say hello? I think it’s pretty good! It was more cohesive to interact with fans often! I think Xiaoxiao’s right!”

“What kind of logic is that?” Xia ruofei was going crazy.”I’m just wondering when the popularity on the internet will drop a little! You, on the other hand, even accepted this job for me. That’s just the opposite!”

“RUO Fei, just give up!” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”actually, you’re still very popular on the internet. There’s no sign of your popularity dropping. It doesn’t seem to matter if you post something or not ...”

“Don’t tear it down when it’s hard, okay?” Xia ruofei said gloomily. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,””Since you’ve already promised the little girl, you have the nerve to go back on your word? In any case, the dishes hadn’t been served yet, so he might as well fulfill his promise first! By the way, you don’t have a Baidu account, do you? Don’t worry! I’ll provide a one – stop service, I’ll help you register!”

Ling Qingxue reached out for Xia ruofei’s phone, lit up the screen, and said,””Unlock it! Why are you in a daze! Forget it, I’ll do it myself!”

Ling Qingxue then grabbed Xia ruofei’s hand and pressed her finger on the fingerprint scanner. After two tries, both of her fingers were wrong. Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. “It’s the left index finger!”

“You should have said so earlier!” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and unlocked her phone.

She skillfully downloaded the Tieba APP and started to register a new account.

“Xia ruofei ... His name has been taken ... Ruofei ... Has been taken as well ...” Ling Qingxue said as she tried it out.”I don’t believe it! There are actually so many people snatching your name? I’ll change to another one ...”

After Ling Qingxue typed in a few words, she couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Then, she showed the phone screen to Xia ruofei and said,””It’s even taking up this ...”

Xia ruofei took a look and did not know whether to laugh or cry. Ling Qingxue had just tried an ID called “overbearing President Xia ruofei”, but it also indicated that the ID already existed.

In the end, after several experiments, he settled for “real Xia ruofei” and finally registered successfully.

Ling Qingxue excitedly wrote a short paragraph of content on her phone and posted it.
