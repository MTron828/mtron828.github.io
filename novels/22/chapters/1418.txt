Translator: 549690339

“Number 33 ... Number 8 ...”

Xia ruofei started to announce the number of the winning ticket. The audience cheered from time to time. The staff who won the prize were so excited that their faces turned red. The colleagues at the same table also urged them to treat. The atmosphere was very lively.

However, when Xia ruofei finished announcing the fourth number and picked up the fifth ticket, he stopped and had a strange look on his face.

Everyone was confused. At first, they thought that Xia ruofei had learned from Liu Qian and was trying to keep them in suspense.

The cameraman was still working loyally. Although Xia ruofei was stuck, the close – up shot of the ticket was still transmitted to the big screen.

Everyone naturally turned their attention to the big screen. At first, it was silent, but after a few seconds, they all laughed out loud in unison.

There was a number printed on the lottery ticket,”Cricket 1″.

Everyone knew that lottery ticket No. 1 corresponded to Xia ruofei, and lottery ticket No. 2 corresponded to Feng Jing.

So Xia ruofei had drawn his lot just now!

No wonder he looked like he had seen a ghost. There were hundreds of lottery tickets in the lottery box, and he actually drew his own number. This was too much of a coincidence!

Xia ruofei’s brain worked quickly, and then he smiled and said,””As everyone can see, I’m the last second prize winner. I’ll follow the rules of the game and be the last one to go in and make money!”

The staff laughed. Indeed, according to the rules, Xia ruofei was one of the participants. In theory, even if he won the grand prize, he could still receive the award.

Therefore, no one felt that there was anything wrong with it. Even if Xia ruofei had picked himself, no one would think that there was any shady business behind it.

A Big Boss like Xia ruofei was not short of money. Judging from the banquet and the level of the prizes, the annual meeting would cost at least a few million Yuan. With so much money given out, how could Xia ruofei play any tricks on the prize money that was only tens of thousands?

Besides, the annual meeting was just for fun. The chairman, who was usually elusive, would personally go into the glass Room to make money later. This was a rare “wonder”! The employees were all looking forward to it.

The other staff members who had won the prize also came up to the stage. One of the four winners was a worker working on the production line of the pharmaceutical factory. The worker had just contacted him and told him the news of winning the prize. He had also appointed a colleague at the scene to go in and earn money in his place.

The three employees who won the lottery and the agent of one of them went up to the stage and stood beside Xia ruofei. They looked a little reserved, but at the same time, they could not suppress their excitement and expectation.

Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,””Don’t be nervous, everyone. We’ll go in according to the order of winning the prize announced earlier. ”

“We’ll immediately transfer the same amount of money that the previous lucky winner has earned,” Xia ruofei continued.”We’ll make sure that everyone is playing the game under the same conditions!”

Xia ruofei gestured to the staff at the side of the stage.

The staff of the finance department immediately walked up to the stage with fifteen stacks of hundred – Yuan bills that had been counted. These were the new bills that had been specially withdrawn from the bank today, and each stack was the standard ten thousand Yuan.

The staff of the finance department opened all fifteen stacks of cash in front of everyone on the stage and scattered them in The Glass Room.

In a short while, the floor of The Glass Room was covered with a layer of red hundred Yuan bills, which looked very visually impactful. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The cameraman even gave a special close – up, which made the staff who didn’t win the prize very envious.

However, this was only the second prize. Generally speaking, there were still the first and special prizes. According to the rules, these two prizes were definitely bigger. Although the probability of winning was a little low, there was still hope for everyone.

As for the employees who had already won the prize, they looked at the stage with a relaxed attitude, as if they were watching a show.

Xia ruofei said to the first lucky winner,””You can go in now! The rules were very simple. The time limit was 30 seconds. After entering, you can’t use any part of your body to touch the money and step on it. After the time limit was up, all the money in the net would belong to you! Do you understand?”

“Understood!” The staff member said excitedly.

“Go in!”

The staff member took the long – handled net bag from the staff and walked into the glass Room.

This was just a normal net bag used to catch fish. The hole was quite big, and the company didn’t play any tricks on it.

Xia ruofei personally acted as the judge.”Time ... Start!”

A thirty – second countdown suddenly appeared on the big screen. The staff who won the prize immediately began to use the net to fish for money in a hurry.

“Good luck! Good luck!”

“Hurry up! The money on your left is more ...”

The staff in the audience were all cheering for the lucky winner.

Today, the finance department had prepared all the new notes, so they were smoother. In addition, the notes were scattered very wide, so the opening of the net was a bit thick. In the first few seconds, although the employee was flustered, he only managed to grab a few notes.

Everyone was laughing and cheering, and the atmosphere was quite warm.

The staff member who won the lottery quickly came to his senses. He was not in a hurry to get money directly. Instead, he used the net bag to drive the money together. After increasing the thickness, the effect was much better than before.
