Chapter 1069: Accidentally on the hot search (1)

Translator: 549690339

The peach blossom company’s auction was on the National television!

This was even more unexpected than Feng Jing becoming an internet celebrity.

On the day of the auction, Xia ruofei did see a photojournalist and a paper reporter from the National television at the scene. However, he knew that they were just the staff of the National television station in Hong Kong. These reporters might go to three scenes a day and report five or six times. However, those who were actually selected to be on television might not even have an average of one report a day.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not have much hope. After all, this auction was not important enough for the National television to report it.

In fact, this report was on the National television. The night before Xia ruofei left Hong Kong, he found it on the internet in his hotel and was dumbfounded.

From the interview to the post – production, to sending it back to the headquarters in Beijing, and then going through layers of review, it was already three days after the auction when the report finally met the audience on TV.

This kind of news was not like the leader’s activities. It was not timely, and it was good enough to be on it.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, the news was not broadcasted on the finance and news channels of the National television. Instead, it was broadcasted on a comprehensive channel.

Even though it was not “news broadcast” at Seveno’ clock in the evening, but “News 30 minutes” at noon. Even though it was only 20 to 30 seconds long and only had a few shots, Xia ruofei was still very excited.

This was the National television! This was a whole set!

Even in the age of the internet, the National television still had its own Halo and great influence.

After Xia ruofei saw the video on the internet, he couldn’t help but open the official website of the National television. He looked for the original video and watched it a few times. He grinned as he watched it, as if he had found gold.

Although Huan Huan was reluctant to leave, Xia ruofei had already stayed in Hong Kong for three days, so he still set off on his way home.

Xia ruofei had promised Huan Huan that he would play with her again during the winter break. This year, Tian Huilan might be spending the Spring Festival in the capital. Hence, after discussing it with Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin, they decided to spend the Spring Festival in the three mountains if there were no special circumstances. At that time, Xia ruofei would not have to go to Hong Kong and could accompany Huan Huan.

Initially, MA Xiong wanted to arrange for a private jet to send Xia ruofei back, but Xia ruofei declined.

He had to bring abalone through customs on his way here, so he accepted MA Xiong’s offer and took a private plane.

Now that he was back at the three mountains, he didn’t have to waste it.

Ma Zhiming had booked a first – Class ticket for Xia ruofei and personally sent Xia ruofei to the airport with Tian Huixin and Huan Huan.

An hour later, Xia ruofei’s Airbus 320 landed smoothly at Sanshan International Airport.

Xia ruofei saw ye Lingyun as soon as they left the airport.

“Brother Xia! You’ve had a long journey!” Ye Lingyun came forward and took Xia ruofei’s luggage.

“You’re also a director – Level leader, so why are you still personally picking us up?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Ye linyun smiled honestly and said,””In front of brother Xia, there’s no such thing as a director. I’ll always be the new recruit that you’ve led!”

Xia ruofei laughed as he reached out and punched ye Lingyun’s shoulder. Everything was clear without words.

Ye Lingyun drove the company’s Mercedes – Benz. The two of them got the car from the parking lot. Before ye Lingyun started the car, Xia ruofei’s phone rang.

He took it out and looked at the caller ID, and a smile appeared on his face. He quickly swiped on the screen and said with a smile,””Boss Feng, you’re a big star now!”

“Isn’t it all your fault?”Feng Rao pouted.

“How can you blame me? This is a good thing!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”besides, I can’t do something like this!”

“Then you can push me to my death?” Feng Jing said,”I’ve been so annoyed for the past few days. All kinds of phone calls from relatives, friends, and classmates, as well as the media. I don’t even know where they got their phone numbers from. I don’t even dare to turn on my phone at work now. Otherwise, I won’t be able to work ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

After Feng Rao complained for a while, she said,”Chairman, I’m calling because I think your plane should have landed by now.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Oh? Is there an emergency?” Xia ruofei quickly asked.

“You know that our company’s news is on national TV Department 1, right?” Feng Jing chuckled.

“I only found out last night. I think he was on ‘News 30 points’ yesterday afternoon?” Xia ruofei asked,”what’s the matter?”

“You probably haven’t seen Weibo yet, have you?” Feng Rao laughed. Now open it and see! You’ll know after reading it ...”

After speaking, Feng Jing hung up the phone with a smile.

“You’re still keeping me in suspense ...” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself.”Ling Yun, has there been any news on Weibo these two days?”

Ye Lingyun started the car and said,””I’m not sure! There’s a lot of news about our company on the internet ...”

“Then why did you ask me to look at Weibo, CEO Feng?” Xia ruofei opened the Weibo app on his phone, confused.

Xia ruofei’s eyes widened the moment he entered Weibo.

That was because he saw the words “sky – High abalone” on the eighth most searched topic.

It’s actually on Weibo’s hot search? Xia ruofei even felt that it was a little unreal. He rubbed his eyes and confirmed that he was not seeing things. This auction was really on the hot search list and it was ranked eighth.
