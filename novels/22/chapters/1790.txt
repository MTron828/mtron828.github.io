Chapter 1791: Song Wei's suggestion (2)

Translator: 549690339

However, everything seemed to be set in stone. What seemed impossible just happened.

Even though Xia ruofei said that, he actually listened to Song Wei’s suggestion.

It wasn’t a whimsical idea to let Ling Qingxue cultivate it. Song Wei’s suggestion to let Ling Qingxue come into contact with the “absolute beginning Scripture” and its special cultivation method made Ling Qingxue understand them. This was also one of the reasons.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei felt that it was time to let Ling Qingxue come into contact with cultivation. Even if Ling Qingxue could not accept Song Wei’s existence and even wanted to leave him, at least by guiding her on the path of cultivation, it would still bring her many benefits.

Not to mention strengthening the body and maintaining beauty, Ling Qingxue’s ability to protect herself would also be greatly improved. In the worst case scenario, at least Xia ruofei would leave Ling Qingxue a final gift.

The two of them hugged each other quietly. Although they hugged each other very tightly, they didn’t have the slightest desire.

After a long time, Song Wei blushed and said,””I ... I should go back ...” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei quickly said,”stay for lunch!” I might be returning to the three mountains tomorrow. I want to cultivate one more time before I leave! We all need to consolidate our cultivation. ”

In fact, Xia ruofei had originally decided to return to the three mountains this afternoon. However, he had changed his mind at the last minute.

It would have been fine if Xia ruofei did not talk about cultivation. Once he did, Song Wei’s face turned red as if blood was going to ooze out. She glared at Xia ruofei and said,”Your mind is not healthy!”

Xia ruofei was stunned and said,”not healthy?” We’ve just broken through a realm, and now we need to cultivate to consolidate it. I’m fine! You’ve also cultivated other techniques, but you only have the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra.” If you cultivate it alone, the efficiency of this technique is too low. You have to cultivate it with two people ...”

Speaking of joint training, Xia ruofei finally reacted. He pointed at Song Wei and said,”Oh! Don’t tell me you thought ...”

Song Wei’s face was as red as a ripe apple.”You were the one who deliberately misled me!”

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t. This can’t be considered misleading!” Xia ruofei said,”you’ve really reminded me. We have a more efficient cultivation method! Why would he give it up and not use it? I’m really slow – witted, I can’t be compared to you, a top student of Beijing University!”

“I don’t want to!” Song Wei said shyly,”I’ll go back first! You ... You should just consolidate your cultivation!”

After she finished speaking, Song Wei Ran out of the room as if she was escaping.

Xia ruofei quickly grabbed Song Wei and said,””Don’t go! Don’t go! Can’t we just cultivate normally? Now that you’ve just broken through, it’ll be very difficult for you to practice the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” alone. If your realm is unstable, you’ll have a lot of trouble in the future!”

Seeing that Xia ruofei was being serious, Song Wei threw away her shyness and looked at Xia ruofei seriously.”Is it really just normal cultivation?”

“I swear to the lamp!” Xia ruofei raised his hand and said.

“Alright then!” Song Wei said,”I’ll stay a little longer then ...”

“Ruofei, I’ve thought about it ... Before big sister Qingxue accepts my existence, we ... We shouldn’t try that kind of cultivation method. Also, in reality, we ...” Song Wei said seriously.

Xia ruofei pressed his hand on Song Wei’s lips and said,”You don’t have to say anything, I understand what you mean ...”

“Do you agree?” Song Wei looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes and asked.

“Can I not agree?” Xia ruofei said.

In fact, he was touched. Song Wei was too kind and considerate. To be honest, even Xia ruofei was addicted to the cultivation method in his sea of consciousness. Song Wei must be the same. However, she suggested that they should not try it again before Ling Qingxue accepted it. Her spirit was great.

“It’s good that you agree!”Song Wei said with a smile. Come on! I’m done resting, let’s start cultivating!”

Then, Song Wei walked towards the time formation that had not been removed.

Xia ruofei followed him and the two of them sat down cross – legged in the formation.

Before he started cultivating, Xia ruofei said,””Song Wei ... I might be going back tomorrow. The courtyard here isn’t of much use. Usually, only Wu Qiang and the others stay here to clean it up. Why don’t you move in ...”

Song Wei blushed.”I don’t want to. I’m fine living in the dormitory. Also ... Why am I living here?”

There was a hint of resentment in her tone. After all, she was not in a legitimate position.

“It’s not convenient to cultivate in the dormitory!” Xia ruofei said,”if you feel embarrassed, you can choose another house to stay in this yard! Even if he’s my friend, it’s normal for him to borrow a house! Anyway, when I’m not in the capital, Wu Qiang and the others are basically free. It won’t affect you if you move in! Moreover ... Wu Qiang and the others are very tight – lipped, they won’t spread it ...”

Xia ruofei’s words moved Song Wei a little. She hesitated and said,”I ... I’ll think about it first! You can go back first tomorrow. If I want to move in, I’ll give you a call!”

Xia ruofei knew that it was hard for Song Wei to make a decision so quickly. He smiled and said,”Alright! You can come over at any time. I’ll tell Wu Qiang before I return to the three mountains! Let’s not talk about this, let’s start cultivating!”
