2643 Going to the green cloud Island again (1)

In the eyes of the Liu family, the life – saving pill did not actually require any technical skill. It was just a “perfect supplement pill”. The only useful thing was the addition of the petals of the spirit Heart Flower in the later stage of production.

Hence, Xia ruofei could make the pills with ease.

Two hours later, Xia ruofei walked out of the room with a plastic box. Inside the box were 60 pills, each wrapped in a layer of preservation film.

For Liu Qunfeng, these two hours felt like years. He had been waiting in the corridor ever since he left elder Liu’s room. When Xia ruofei’s door opened, he jogged over subconsciously as if there were Springs under his feet.

Xia ruofei looked at Liu Qunfeng, who had a look of anticipation in his eyes. He smiled and said,””I didn’t fail you!”

Liu Qunfeng let out a long sigh of relief and thanked Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei said,”there are a total of 60 pills in here. Take one pill a day for 30 days, and one pill every two days. If nothing goes wrong, elder Liu should be completely cured in three months.”

“That’s great! That’s great!” Liu Qunfeng said repeatedly. At the same time, he memorized the dosage Xia ruofei had mentioned.

“I’ll leave it to you!” Xia ruofei stuffed the plastic box into Liu Qunfeng’s arms and said with a smile,”you have to keep it well this time! This batch of pills is even better than the one I made last time. Moreover, good spirit medicines can only be encountered and not sought. If the medicine is contaminated or destroyed again, then I really can’t do anything. ”

Xia ruofei was not lying. The pills this time were indeed more effective than the previous batch because the concentration of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution that he added was higher than the previous one. Since he had already decided, there was no need to drag it on.

As for the “course” of treatment, it was designed to be three months, mainly because he took into account that the handover of green cloud Island had not been completed yet. In addition, he also needed time to form his own team. Not only the defense of the island, but also the maintenance and use of the airport and other facilities on the island, as well as the follow – up construction and other aspects, all of which needed time.

Besides, old man Liu’s illness was too dangerous and serious. It was already shocking enough to be able to cure such an illness. Xia ruofei was trying to prolong the treatment so that he would not stand out too much.

Of course, the nature of this treatment was completely different from the previous ones. To be honest, Xia ruofei did not plan to completely cure elder Liu, so he was very strict with the dosage.

“I understand! I understand!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”with this as a lesson, we won’t let a similar problem happen again! Don’t worry!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”There’s nothing to worry about. I’ll hand the things over to you anyway. Other than the patient, no one’s skin can touch the pill. You all know this very well. If something really happens, I won’t be responsible.”

“Of course! That’s for sure!” Liu Qunfeng said.

Then, Liu Qunfeng turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, I’ll have to excuse myself!”

Xia ruofei knew that Liu Qunfeng must have stored the pills and increased the security level.

This was Grandpa Liu’s life – saving medicine. When the time came, the room where the medicinal herbs were stored would definitely be heavily guarded. Even a fly or a mosquito would not be able to get close to the refrigerator. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””You can go! I’m going to see elder Liu!”

Xia ruofei didn’t need to report to Mr. Liu. When he walked in, Liu Kuan was talking to Mr. Liu. When he saw Xia ruofei enter, Liu Kuan immediately bowed to Xia ruofei and greeted him. Then, he excused himself from Mr. Liu and left the room.

Old man Liu had heard all the good news today, so he was in a good mood. He looked at Xia ruofei and said with a smile,”Little Xia, it seems like you’ve succeeded?”

“I didn’t fail you!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Thank you!” Old master Liu looked at Xia ruofei and said seriously.

“Elder Liu, you don’t have to be so polite,” Xia ruofei smiled.”You’ve already paid for the treatment. It’s my duty to treat you.”

A bitter smile appeared on old man Liu’s face as he asked,””Little Xia, can’t we talk about our friendship? Actually, even if you treat this as an equal deal, we, the Liu family, will never forget your kindness. Just now, QUN FENG told me that he would be grateful to you for life!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I can see that elder Liu is a sentimental person ...”

Old man Liu agreed with Xia ruofei’s point of view, but he seemed to be in deep thought. After a while, he smiled bitterly and said,””Qunfeng’s personality is naturally good in an ordinary family, but in our Liu family...I don’t know if it’s good or bad ...”

Xia ruofei said,”elder Liu, you were criticizing me just now!” Humans do need to be rational, but being too rational would make you seem a little cold – blooded. It’s not necessarily a bad thing to be a little more humane!”

Old man Liu was stunned for a moment, but he immediately smiled and said,””What you said makes sense! In any case, after this crisis is over, my old bones can still hold on for a few years, and the peaks don’t have to face that pressure immediately!”
