3367 Chain mission (1)

Xia ruofei tried his best to control the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword and continued to attack the camel thorn.

His control of spiritual power was very precise, and camel thorn couldn’t Dodge, so he could accurately make the blue immortal sword and the qushuang flying sword strike the same position.

However, even so, two consecutive attacks at the same spot only left a white mark on camel’s thorn. It was unknown how many more times it would take to cut it.

Moreover, after being attacked twice, the camel’s thorn would automatically release its thorns to interfere with the flying sword on Xia ruofei’s third attack. This made it difficult for Xia ruofei to control the flying sword to slash at the same spot.

The thorns of the camel’s back could also be retracted, so its attack was almost infinite.

After a few attempts, Xia ruofei recalled the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword because he knew that such an attack was meaningless.

If his cultivation had reached the Yuanying stage and the grade of his flying sword was higher, he might have been able to directly sweep through this thicket of camel thorns with a powerful attack.

However, under the current circumstances, it would take him a long time to deal with this one camel’s thorn. If he wanted to reach the spot where the light spot was, he had to at least get rid of all the other camel’s thorns on this side. Otherwise, he would inevitably trigger their attack.

There were at least a few dozen camel thorns within twenty meters of this side. For safety’s sake, he would probably have to clear out more.

This way, the time spent would probably be measured in years.

Moreover, Xia ruofei saw that after a while, the White marks on camel’s back from the two flying swords had disappeared. In other words, not only did camel’s back have an amazing defense, but it also had a very fast recovery speed.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei completely gave up on his plan to attack.

Since he couldn’t use his flying sword to attack, he could only find another way.

Xia ruofei frowned. The first thing that came to his mind was arrays.

However, the choice of the formation was very particular. If the right formation was chosen, the effect would naturally be very different, and it was very likely to yield twice the result with half the effort.

Some of the ready – made arrays were useless, including the trap & kill array that had been tried and tested in the first few levels of the trial tower. It would not have any good effect in the face of such a large area of camel’s thorn bushes.

Xia ruofei stood up and kept the chair in the spirit map space. Then, he slowly walked back to Ling Qingxue’s side.

“RUO Fei, how is it?” “Are you alright?” Ling Qingxue asked with concern.

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”I’m fine!” However, with these camel’s thorns here, it won’t be easy to deal with them. ”

“Yup! Their attacks are very powerful. I saw you attack them with your flying sword just now, but it basically didn’t have any effect. ” Ling Qingxue furrowed her brows.

“It’s definitely not possible to attack it with a flying sword. The efficiency is too low. Moreover, its recovery ability is quite strong. The speed of damage dealt to it can’t keep up with its recovery speed. It’s equivalent to wasting effort.” Xia ruofei said,”that’s why I’m thinking of using an array to deal with them.”

At this point, Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and asked with a smile,”Qingxue, if it were you, what kind of formation would you choose to deal with this camel’s thorn?”

Ling Qingxue tilted her head and thought for a moment before saying,””I don’t know anything about formations either! What should I say? But to deal with this kind of plant, fire should be more effective!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.””You really woke me up from my dream with one sentence! I’ve analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of several formations, but I didn’t think of this simple principle! Qingxue, you’re right, using fire to attack should be the most effective!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but laugh,”RUO Fei, you’re not just coaxing me, are you?” It’s such a simple logic, how could you not have thought of it and need me to remind you?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”sometimes, it’s like this. You think too much and easily complicate simple problems. Of course, whether the fire attack is effective against the camel’s thorn still needs to be verified, but this is a good idea!”

“I’ll be relying on you then!” Ling Qingxue said happily. She felt that being able to provide Xia ruofei with some ideas would be considered as a help.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”let me think, what formation should I use?”

Xia ruofei had obtained many ready – made array diagrams from the Jade talisman of inheritance. In addition, his array Dao level was no longer the same as before. He had integrated a lot of array Dao knowledge and could also make adjustments and modifications according to the array diagrams of his predecessors. For example, the previous trap and kill array was modified by him based on a few ready – made array diagrams and the effect was surprisingly good.

Xia ruofei quickly went through all the formations he knew in his mind. There were many formations for fire attack, but none of them met the requirements.

First of all, the area of the formation had to be large enough.

The diameter of the ring formed by the camel’s thorn bushes was at least one kilometer, and the inner diameter was about 950 meters. In other words, the depth of the camel’s thorn bushes was about 50 meters.

If Xia ruofei used fire, he must have a formation that covered a large area of at least one kilometer.

There were some formations with large areas recorded in the Jade talisman of inheritance. However, it was rare to see formations with such a large area of effect. There were one or two that Xia ruofei was not particularly satisfied with.
