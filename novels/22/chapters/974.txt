“Don’t worry!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”I already told them to make preparations. Let’s go, I’ll take you to see!”

With that, Ling Qingxue held Xia ruofei’s arm and walked into the courtyard. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

There was a central room between the two courtyards, and the bar counter of the private restaurant was set up there. When Ling Qingxue walked over, she raised her voice and asked,””Old Lu, is the flying Snow Pavilion ready?”

A middle – aged man in a shirt, suit pants, and a red tie quickly said,””President Ling, everything is ready! Do you want to go over now?”

Ling Qingxue nodded.”Yes, let’s go and take a look. The guests should be here soon!”

“Alright, alright!” Old Lu said immediately. Then, he waved his hand and said,”Xiaoli, bring CEO Ling to the flying Snow Pavilion!”

Then, old Lu showed an embarrassed smile and said,””President Ling, I still have a guest to attend to. What do you think ...”

Ling Qingxue waved her hand and said,””It’s okay, go do your thing! You’ve worked hard ...”

“It’s not hard at all ...” Old Lu quickly said.

A waitress in a cheongsam walked over with a smile on her face and said,””President Ling, this way please!”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue followed the waitress inside.

After passing through three courtyards, the waitress opened a moon – shaped door and made an inviting gesture to Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue.

There was an ancient wooden tablet above the moon gate with the words ‘flying Snow Pavilion’ written on it.

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened as he walked in.

He did not expect that the innermost part of this private restaurant had a different world. There was a small courtyard here, which was decorated with rockery, fish ponds, and all kinds of beautiful flowers and green grass. There was a winding stone path, and on both sides of the path, there were some stone tables and stone chairs scattered. The environment was very quiet.

As they walked along the path, they saw a wooden house. This wooden house was built in accordance with the style of Ming and Qing Dynasty buildings, and it looked antique.

After entering the room, Xia ruofei realized that the entire room was actually a big room. In the middle was a round dining table, the left side was the tea area, the middle was separated by a screen, and the right side was separated into a lounge and guest room.

The entire house was built in a Chinese style. Screens, calligraphy paintings, lanterns, Chinese furniture ... It gave off an antique feel.

The moment Xia ruofei walked in, he felt a chill. The service staff had already turned on the air conditioner.

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”what do you think?” The environment is okay, right? This entire courtyard is actually just a private room. The environment is quiet and tranquil, and no one will disturb you!”

Xia ruofei praised,”not bad, not bad!” Qingxue, in the future, who would dare to say that Ling Ji’s food and drink business is not up to standard? You can use this flying Snow Pavilion to slap his mouth!”

Ling Qingxue chuckled.”This flying Snow Pavilion is not usually open to the public. It’s considered a private room reserved by our internal department. We only use it when extremely important guests come.”

“It seems like I’m benefiting from Secretary song’s efforts today!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Nonsense!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”this flying Snow Pavilion was originally meant for when I had dinner with you tonight. However, you said that Secretary song was coming, so my father gave up this private room.”

“Yo! I’m really flattered!” Xia ruofei said exaggeratedly, which made Ling Qingxue laugh.

Then, Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He mumbled to himself, and as if he had discovered a new continent, he said to Ling Qingxue,””Wife, I suddenly realize that there’s something mysterious about the name of this room! Flying Snow Pavilion ... Flying Snow Pavilion ... Xia ruofei’s flying, Ling Qingxue’s snow? I say, wife, you’re too talented! To think that we can come up with such a poetic name by giving each of our names a character!”

Ling Qingxue’s face heated up slightly.””Don’t be so far – fetched, alright? This is just a coincidence!”

“Is it really just a coincidence?” Xia ruofei smiled and looked deeply into Ling Qingxue’s eyes.

Ling Qingxue felt a little uncomfortable under Xia ruofei’s gaze. She could not help but whine,””Aiya ... Why are you so annoying!”

In fact, the name flying Snow Pavilion was given by Ling Qingxue. It contained the names of two people. Ling Qingxue had put a lot of thought into the decoration and layout of the courtyard. The private room was not open to the public and was basically left for Xia ruofei to enjoy alone.

However, after Xia ruofei exposed her, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but feel embarrassed and embarrassed. Hence, she began to use a woman’s sharpest weapon, the coquettish girl.

Xia ruofei also knew that it would not work to reason with a woman. He laughed and stopped teasing Ling Qingxue.

However, when he thought of the name of the private room, Xia ruofei’s eyes still flashed with a smile, causing Ling Qingxue to roll her eyes at Xia ruofei.

“Ruofei, we’ve seen the private room. I’ll take you to my dad ‘s!” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei shrugged.”The environment here is so good. Why don’t you ask uncle Ling to come over? we can make tea and chat together!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””This is for you to receive Secretary song. What is my dad doing here? If it’s messy, I’ll have to clean it up again ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”so what?” You and uncle Ling will be here in a while anyway, so why don’t you come over and wait now?”
