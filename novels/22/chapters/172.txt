Chapter 173: A child’s words carry no harm (1)

Xia ruofei walked onto the stage and expressed his gratitude to everyone. He also announced the new truffle season at the end of the year. Peach blossom company would still launch high – Quality truffles to the market and would gradually enter the field of other high – end ingredients. He welcomed everyone’s cooperation. The contact number of paradise Corporation and the QR code of Xia ruofei’s work WeChat were displayed on the big screen. Many people in the F & B industry took out their phones to record the number and scanned the code to add Xia ruofei’s work WeChat. Gu Hongyang, GE long, and the other rich people also took note of the numbers. The truffle auction this time had left a deep impression on them. They knew that top – Class ingredients could only be encountered by luck and not sought after. The Paradise Corporation was already qualified to get their attention. The total transaction amount of this auction had reached about 2.2 million USD. After deducting the venue, personnel, and other related expenses, the net profit should be able to reach about 2.17 million USD, which was equivalent to more than 14 million Chinese dollars. This was the largest single income that Xia ruofei had ever earned. However, Xia ruofei did not think that this was the biggest gain. In his opinion, the biggest gain from this trip was to make paradise corporation’s name known. Moreover, it had directly made its name known in the high – end food and beverage industry and among the Super – rich, and had also successfully established the high – end and high – Quality image of paradise Corporation. This could be said to be infinitely beneficial for their future development. Everyone chatted as they slowly left the stage. Xia ruofei also walked down the stage. Monica was smiling and chatting with MA Xiong and the others. Lu You was also standing at the side with a playful expression. Xia ruofei walked over with a bitter smile and asked,””Monica, what are you doing?” “Xia,” Monica asked, smiling.”There’s no law that states that truffles can’t be bought, right?” “No, but ...” Xia ruofei was speechless.”The point is, what are you buying it for?” Your family doesn’t lack this ...” Monica smiled.”It’s my grandfather’s birthday in two days. He’s been running the truffle business his whole life. I believe he’ll be very happy to see this Super White truffle at his birthday party.” “I see ...” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then it’s not hard to understand!” Lu You turned her head to the side and pursed her lips discreetly. She seemed to think that this reason was not very convincing. At this moment, Monica asked with a smile,””Xia, is our agreement from this morning still in effect?” MA Xiong and the rest immediately looked at Xia ruofei in unison, revealing a tacit smile. Lu You’s beautiful eyes also moved and glanced at Xia ruofei in disdain. Xia ruofei suddenly felt that he could not speak clearly. Monica was still smiling at him, waiting for his answer. He could only smile bitterly and say,””Of course!” “We’re returning tomorrow afternoon,” Xia ruofei continued.”I wonder if I have the honor to invite you to lunch?” “I’d be very happy to!” Monica smiled charmingly and said,”then I’ll wait for your call?” “Okay, okay ...” Xia ruofei felt that the gazes of MA Xiong and the others were making him feel uncomfortable. He quickly replied. Monica chuckled and nodded to MA Xiong politely. Then, she turned around and left. MA Xiong looked at Monica’s graceful back and laughed. He gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up and said,””Xia Sheng, it’s indeed an advantage to be handsome! I’m impressed ...” Ma Zhiming also joined in the fun and said,”I’ve long heard that miss Grasso has very high standards. Many rich children want to get close to her, but they return in failure!” Xia Sheng is amazing!” Xia ruofei forced a smile.”Don’t make fun of me. There’s really nothing between us. We just met when we were working out. We just chatted for a while ...” “Don’t be so humble,” Lu You said.”You must be feeling so happy now!” “I’m not ...” “Aunt, uncle, I’m a little tired. Can we go back now?” Lu You said directly. “Ah?” Tian Huixin was stunned for a moment and quickly replied,”Oh! Go back, go back! I’m fine now ...” “En!” After Lu You finished speaking, she took the lead and walked forward. Tian Huixin carried Huan Huan and quickly followed. Xia ruofei forced a smile and walked out of the door with MA Xiong. “Xia Sheng, how do you plan to deal with Blake?” MA Xiong asked with a serious expression. Xia ruofei’s expression turned cold as he said,””He slandered our paradise Corporation in public. This matter won’t end so easily. Unless he issues an apology on the mainstream media, I’ll see you in court!” “Alright, I know your attitude,” said Ma Xiong with a nod. Xia Sheng, I’ll contact a few of my good friends who will be attending tonight’s auction later. We’ll work together to put pressure on Blake’s Dining Group and make him come out and apologize! This young man is really outrageous!” Xia ruofei was touched and said,””Old Mr. MA, thank you!” MA Xiong really had nothing to say about him. If this matter were to get serious, there would definitely be wrangling. Even if Blake had said those slanderous words in public, there were many super – rich people and high – end gastronomists present today. How many of them would be willing to testify for Xia ruofei? Especially those in the food and beverage industry, they definitely wouldn’t want to offend the well – known black dining Group. If MA Xiong joined hands with a few super – rich people to put pressure on Blake’s group, the situation would definitely be different. Under the pressure, it was possible that Blake would come out and apologize. Xia ruofei knew very well that the reason why MA Xiong was so nice to him was largely due to his superb ‘medical skills’. Everyone was afraid of death, especially the Super – rich. However, in society, it was impossible for people to not have interests. If you had something that was worthy of others ‘attention, it was also considered your ability. Besides, MA Xiong was not just using Xia ruofei. He was also grateful. Xia ruofei had saved MA Xiong’s life and cured Huanhuan’s illness. He had given both of them a Second Life. MA Xiong was also a grateful person, which suited Xia ruofei’s temperament. The two of them chatted as they walked. Tian Huixin and the others, who were not far away, were also chatting. “Youyou, why do I feel like you’re a little unhappy?” Tian Huixin said with a smile. “No, aunty ...” “Is it because of Xiao Xia and that Italy girl?” Tian Huixin smiled and asked,”I think it’s quite good! If little Xia has the ability to win over that girl, it would be considered as bringing glory to the country!” Lu You’s expression turned even uglier. Tian Hui looked at Lu You thoughtfully and asked half – jokingly,””Youyou, don’t tell me you’ve fallen for Xia?” “How is that possible? What are you thinking, aunt?” Lu You’s reaction was very big.”Do you think I’d like someone like him? One of my besties has been secretly in love with him for a long time. I really didn’t expect this guy to be such a womanizer. I just feel bad for my bestie ...” Tian Huixin smiled meaningfully and asked,””Really?” “Of course!” At this moment, Huan Huan, who was in Tian Huixin’s arms, suddenly pointed at Lu You and said,””Mom, dad, sister Youyou is jealous!” Tian Huixin and Ma Zhiming looked at each other and couldn’t help but burst into laughter. Lu You’s face turned red and she said angrily,””Huanhuan, what are you talking about? You little girl, do you even know what it means to eat ... That?” Huan Huan looked up and said seriously,”I understand!” It’s always like this in TV shows, look ... You’re blushing ...” “I ... I really regret watching those TV dramas with you ...” Lu You held her forehead and said,”I swear, I will never let you watch those messy idol dramas again ...” Tian Huixin, who was standing at the side, was overjoyed. She almost couldn’t hold Huan Huan steadily. Ma Zhiming quickly came over to support her. At this moment, Xia ruofei and MA Xiong had already walked up to them. Seeing this, Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”what’s the matter that made you so happy?” They’re all overjoyed ...” Tian Huixin laughed as she glanced at Lu You. Then, she said,””Nothing, nothing ... Huanhuan just said ...” “Little aunt!” Lu youjiao stomped her feet and said,”are you still leaving?” “Okay, okay, okay. Let’s go ...” Tian Huixin said with a smile.”By the way, Xiao Xia, you already have a date with a beauty tomorrow, so we’ll come to pick you up in the afternoon!” “Alright!” Xia ruofei replied,”take care! I won’t be sending you down ...” Lu You couldn’t wait any longer and walked towards the elevator. MA Xiong and the rest also left after bidding Xia ruofei farewell. Xia ruofei stood on the spot and thought for a while. He felt that the smile of Tian Huixin and her husband was very strange. However, he could not figure it out after thinking for a long time. He could only shake his head and walk back to the Presidential Suite’s special elevator.
