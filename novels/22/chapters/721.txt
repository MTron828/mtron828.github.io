Chapter 722: The power of the Super – stimulant (1)

Hearing this, Xia ruofei quickly walked down the stairs and asked anxiously,””Have you already estimated the score?”

“I haven ‘t! “I came out to tell you as soon as I saw the answers on the website ...” Lin Qiao said.

“Then what are we waiting for? Quick, quick, quick, calculate how many points you can get!” Xia ruofei said impatiently.

Xia ruofei had always been concerned about Lin Qiao’s college entrance examination.

Before Lin Qiao transferred to another school, she was also a student who ranked above average in the county No. 1 middle school. It was not a big problem for her to pass the second – tier University.

After being transferred to the provincial top school, Sanshan No. 8 high school, Lin Qiao studied very hard in the liberal arts class. In addition, the software and hardware conditions in the class were very good, so her grades improved significantly.

In the last mock exam, Lin Qiao had already passed the Tier 1 exam by 20 to 30 points.

Xia ruofei had even prepared an enhanced version of heart – nourishing soup for Lin Qiao for the college entrance examination. Xia ruofei was also looking forward to her final results.

The two of them went to the living room and sat down on the sofa. Lin Qiao crossed her legs and placed the laptop on her lap. She began to estimate the scores based on the answers published on the internet.

Nowadays, the college entrance examination scores were announced first before filling in the application form. Therefore, the management of the examination hall was not particularly strict when it came to the phenomenon of the examinees recording their answers and bringing them out. Many people would record the objective questions ‘answers on an eraser or a transparent pencil case and bring them out of the examination hall.

Lin Qiao was no exception. After she came back, she had already copied her answers on a piece of paper.

Now, he only needed to look at the answers published on the internet and he could quickly estimate his approximate score.

First, it was Chinese. Lin Qiao quickly matched the answers and then estimated the average score for the essay. The final score was 123.

......

Xia ruofei’s spirits were lifted. This was a good start. He had read online yesterday that the college entrance examination this year was more difficult than last year, especially the comprehensive test of language and liberal arts.

Even in previous years, getting more than 120 out of 150 points was already a very good result.

“What a good start!” Xia ruofei said happily,”Qiao’ er, let’s take a look at math!”

“En!” Lin Qiao’s pretty face was red due to nervousness and excitement.

There were no subjective questions in mathematics, so it was faster to estimate the score and the results were more accurate.

Soon, Lin Qiao finished matching the answers. She could get about 130 points in mathematics.

Another high score!

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be excited and urged Lin Qiao to continue with the answers for the other two subjects.

A few minutes later, Lin Qiao’s scores for the four subjects of the college entrance examination were estimated.

In addition to 123 points for Chinese and 130 points for mathematics, she was actually able to get about 140 points for English, which she was best at. Excluding the elements of the composition, the objective question was basically close to full marks.

His comprehensive liberal arts score was also quite good, estimated to be around 210 points.

Adding up the four subjects, the total score reached 603 points!

And this was under the conservative estimation of the Chinese and English essay scores. The actual score might be even higher!

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei happily slapped his thigh and said,”Qiao’ er, you’ve definitely exceeded your usual level!”

Lin Qiao was so excited that her face turned red. She said,”I felt pretty good after the exam, but I didn’t expect it to be this good! According to the results of the mock exam, I can only get around 550 points at most. Brother ruofei, it must be the work of your super – stimulant!”

After yesterday’s college entrance examination, the examinees generally said that this year’s difficulty was much higher than last year ‘s. Some experts estimated that this year’s college entrance examination cut – off point might be lower than last year’s by a few dozen points.

Last year, she scored 547 points in the first – tier University for the liberal arts. If she could get more than 550 points this year, she would be at least 30 to 40 points above the first – tier University’s cut – off point. If she could get more than 600 points, she would definitely be able to surpass the cut – off point for many famous universities.

Lin Qiao knew very well what this result meant. Everyone in her classmates ‘WeChat group was wailing and complaining about how difficult the college entrance examination was this year.

The only reason she knew that the answers to the college entrance examination had been announced was because someone in the group had posted their estimated score.

This student’s grades were usually the same as Lin Qiao ‘s, but this time, he only got around 560 points.

This meant that she had definitely exceeded her level this time!

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think,”If the effect of his company’s heart – nourishing soup was discovered, would it be out of stock before the college entrance examination from now on?

Of course, Xia ruofei also knew that it was almost impossible for this to happen.

This was because Xia ruofei provided Lin Qiao with a heart – nourishing soup that was hand – made and even added the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower without considering the cost.

On the other hand, the heart – nourishing soup that was sold in the end was mass produced and diluted to a certain extent. The effect of the soup was definitely not as obvious as Lin Qiao’s “super – stimulant.”

“Qiao’ er, you have to quickly tell Auntie this good news!” Xia ruofei said excitedly,”where is she?”

“My mom always takes a nap in the afternoon.” Lin Qiao said,”but he’s about to wake up. We have to prepare dinner.”

As the two of them were talking, Hu Zi’s mother had already pushed the door open and walked out.

“What are you guys talking about that made you so happy?” Hu Zi’s mother smiled and asked,”I can hear your laughter from the room.”

Xia ruofei stood up and said happily,””Auntie, this is great news! The college entrance exam’s answers have already been announced. We’ve just calculated the scores, and Qiao’ er’s performance exceeded her usual standards. Her total score is over 600 points!”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
