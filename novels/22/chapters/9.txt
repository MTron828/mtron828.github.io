Chapter 10: Planting Vegetables

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Xia Ruofei smiled and said.

“There are so many types of succulents that Director Liang likes, how can it be so easy to find! But I have a friend who has connections in this area. If you give me some time, it should be no problem.”

Xia Ruofei was already planning to cultivate the seedlings of succulents. He would definitely not lack any succulent plants in the future. When the time came, he would pick one or two pots to cultivate into mature plants and sell them to Liang Qichao.

But to Liang Qichao, these words had a different meaning.

Other than cultivating themselves, there were also other ways to import succulent plants from overseas. Many of the rare succulent plants did not originate from Huaxia, but due to environmental concerns, their imports were forbidden.

Hence, Liang Qichao mistakenly thought that Xia Ruofei had the means to get good stuff from overseas. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Therefore, he was overjoyed when he heard that.

“Thank you! Thank you! I knew that when you stopped me from bidding with Liu Minghao, you must have a way to get more succulents of this grade! Mr Xia, I’ll remember this favor. Haha! Letting Liu Minghao be a fool for once is better than anything else!”

“You’re welcome,” Xia Ruofei said with a faint smile. “Director Liang, I came back today because I wanted to take a look at your greenhouse. Is it convenient now?”

“Of course!” Liang Qichao said readily. “I have quite a lot of experience in cultivating succulent plants. When we tour the greenhouse later, if you have any questions, feel free to ask.”

“Thanks!” Xia Ruofei smiled and said.

Liang Qichao personally brought Xia Ruofei down the stairs and started to tour the succulent plants cultivation base.

“Director Liang, this cultivation base of yours is quite big!” Xia Ruoxin said with a smile as he walked around the shed.

“Hehe… It’s mainly because I like this. I invested some money to build this base. Actually, it doesn’t cost much!” Liang Qichao laughed casually.

Xia Ruofei could tell that he was obviously a rich second-generation heir. He probably ran this store for fun.

Liang Qichao continued to speak.

“By the way, stop calling me Director Liang. I’m just a few years older than you. If you don’t mind, call me Brother Liang. I’ll call you Ruofei!”

Xia Ruofei had a good impression of the straightforward Liang Qichao. He followed his advice and said.

“Sure, Brother Liang!”

Liang Qichao beamed.

“Hey! Ruofei, I don’t have anything else here, but I do have a lot of succulent plants. If you see anything you like later, feel free to tell me. Take it as a gift from Brother Liang!”

“Okay!” Xia Ruofei did not stand on ceremony with Liang Qichao and nodded.

As the two of them walked forward, Liang Qichao introduced to him eagerly.

“Ruofei, one of the big sheds here is filled with Jade Fans. The one next to the big shed is planted with Life Stone Flowers. There are also some tortoiseshell peonies over there, but the quantity isn’t large. This one is too hard to get… And over here, it’s mainly used to cultivate Jade Dew, but they are all ordinary plants. They can’t compare to your supreme-grade Ice Lantern…”

Xia Ruofei looked at them seriously, especially when some workers were caring for the plants, he would stop by the side to watch and ask questions about planting.

Liang Qichao was a succulent plant lover, so he was naturally not annoyed by Xia Ruofei’s questions. He patiently explained everything to him.

Xia Ruofei kept all the information regarding planting and nurturing the succulents in mind.

“Brother Liang, the variety of succulent plants here is really diverse!” Xia Ruofei said with a smile. Then, he raised his question. “But… why are all these succulent plants so small? Can they be sold for a good price?”

Liang Qichao smiled bitterly and explained.

“Brother, succulents plants are famous for growing slowly! If my cultivation base is filled with succulents as big as your Ice Lantern, won’t I be rich?”

“Good quality mature plants are hard to come by. We usually use them to breed other seedlings. In fact, we mainly sell succulent plant seedlings. ”

Xia Ruofei nodded his head secretly. Liang Qichao’s answer was similar to what he had expected. It seemed like he had made the right decision to sell high-quality succulent plant seedlings.

The two of them chatted as they toured the place. Xia Ruofei gained a rough understanding of the growth and reproduction of the succulent plants, and the plan he came up with on Ling Qingxue’s car gradually became more concrete.

The Immortal Succulent Store was not small. In addition, Xia Ruofei would stop to ask questions from time to time. Hence, after touring the place one round, two hours had passed.

Seeing that it was almost time for dinner, Liang Qichao enthusiastically invited Xia Ruofei for dinner, but Xia Ruofei politely declined his offer.

The two of them bade farewell at the entrance of the store.

As Xia Ruoxin got into the taxi, Liang Qichao reminded him outside the window.

“Ruofei, the next time there’s succulent plants, you must consider your Brother Liang first! The price is not a problem!”

It seemed that Liang Qichao was still a little upset that he did not manage to buy the supreme-grade Ice Lantern this time.

Xia Ruofei smiled and nodded. He waved at Liang Qichao and the taxi drove away from the store.

Xia Ruofei alighted from the car near the shantytown. Then, he found a random noodle shop by the roadside and ordered a big bowl of beef noodles. He slurped his noodles and quickly cleared his bowl.

With the training during his military career, Xia Ruofei was not very particular about food. However, the noodles at the roadside stall did not taste good, especially the vegetables in the noodles. They were overcooked and hard and tasted like wax.

After eating, Xia Ruofei suddenly had an idea.

Since the Spiritual Map Space was so magical, why don’t he plant some vegetables inside? Even if it wasn’t for the sake of earning money, it would be good to improve his meals occasionally! The vegetables grown in the Spiritual Map Space would definitely be much better than the vegetables sold in the market!

At the moment, he only wanted to use the Spiritual Map Space to cultivate the succulent plant seedlings. The amount of land in the space was more than enough.

At the thought of this, Xia Ruofei decided to take action immediately. He took a taxi to a seed company in the city and bought some common vegetable seeds. At the same time, he also bought some common farm tools.

Xia Ruofei had been in charge of the team’s vegetable fields when he was a new recruit, so it was not difficult for him to grow vegetables.

After bringing the seeds and farming tools into the Spiritual Map Space, Xia Ruofei dug up a small vegetable patch beside the pool. The soil in the space was very soft, and Xia Ruofei quickly finished the reclamation work.

After soaking the seed in the water from the spiritual pond, Xia Ruofei returned to the outside world to rest for a while. After a few hours, he entered the space to sow.

As for the rest, he basically didn’t have to do anything, because he believed that after soaking the seeds in the spiritual pond water, the chances of them germinating would definitely be extremely high. Moreover, he didn’t have to worry about any harmful bugs.

Xia Ruofei sprinkled the seeds evenly while covering the ground with a layer of soil. After he was done, he used the spiritual pond water to water all the vegetable fields.

After he was done, Xia Ruofei looked at the newly planted vegetable field with a sense of accomplishment and left the Spiritual Map Space in satisfaction.

After showering, Xia Ruofei slept for two hours before waking up at ten in the evening to enter the Spiritual Map Space again.

Actually, he only wanted to drink some water from the spiritual pool because his mouth was dry after waking up.

However, once he entered the space, Xia Ruofei’s eyes were immediately attracted by the patch of green that came into view.
