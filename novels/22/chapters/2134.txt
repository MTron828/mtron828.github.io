2135 Surviving a great disaster (2)

Xia ruofei sighed and sat down cross – legged at the entrance of the cave. He focused all his attention on sensing the situation outside.

If the spirit map was in danger of being destroyed, he would have to leave the space Kasaya as soon as possible. He didn’t know what would happen if the space collapsed. What if he would never be able to return to the outside world?

Therefore, not only was he ready to leave the realm at any time, but he also carefully moved some supplies here with his mind. Then, he stuffed a backpack with a lot of food, water, handheld GPS, maritime satellite phone, and so on that he had originally prepared.

He put his backpack on his back and looked at the thriving and lively spirit map space. He hoped that the worst case scenario would not happen. Otherwise, all the good things would be gone ...

Xia ruofei had expected to encounter all sorts of dangers when exploring the sea on a yacht that was only suitable for offshore navigation. However, he did not expect the situation to be so bad.

He could not help but sigh,”never underestimate the power of nature. In the face of nature, humans are still too insignificant ...”

Xia ruofei could feel that in the sea outside, the spirit map scroll was rolling up and down with the huge waves. Sometimes, it would sink to a depth of ten to twenty meters, and sometimes, it would be thrown up.

The storm lasted for a few hours, and no one knew how big the storm was. At least, when Xia ruofei used the small weather radar on the yacht to observe, he found that the weather was extremely bad for more than ten nautical miles.

Now, Xia ruofei did not know where the waves had brought the spirit map to. It was an impossible task to determine the direction and position of the spirit map while it was rolling.

Of course, Xia ruofei was not too worried. He was well prepared this time. The yacht had a GPS positioning system, a handheld GPS, and a maritime satellite phone. As long as the storm subsided, he believed that he could quickly determine his position and even continue to sail.

After all, the yacht was not damaged in the storm and Xia ruofei had already kept it in the medium.

Although the storm was still raging outside, Xia ruofei could clearly feel that the storm was weakening. Waves that were dozens of meters high were rarely seen.

He was overjoyed. He knew that the storm was about to pass, and the sea should be calm again soon.

In the past few hours, the spirit map had been drifting with the waves. It had been hit and thrown by the waves countless times, but there was no sign of damage. Xia ruofei had been paying attention to the condition of the spirit map and knew very well that there was not a single trace of damage to it. He was much more at ease now.

“I’ll just wait for this damn storm to pass and then immediately leave the space!” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

The storm came suddenly, but it didn’t retreat so quickly.

Xia ruofei waited for more than an hour before the wind and waves outside reduced to a level that he thought he could deal with. The sky outside was already bright, but everywhere his spiritual power could reach was the vast sea. He had no idea where the waves had brought the spirit map to in the past few hours.

Xia ruofei felt that the water outside had started to calm down. He left the space.

He couldn’t wait any longer and didn’t even take off his backpack.

As soon as he appeared in the outside world, Xia ruofei immediately kept the spirit map scroll in his body. He was completely relieved.

Although the storm was not as terrible as last night, the waves were still quite big. Xia ruofei decided to take out the yacht later.

Thinking of the thirty – meter long azmu yacht, Xia ruofei felt a headache. If he wanted to retrieve the yacht again, he would have to use all his strength. The feeling of having a splitting headache from overusing his mental energy in an instant made him feel a lingering fear.

Although he was carrying a heavy backpack, Xia ruofei could still easily stabilize his body in the water.

At this moment, a white mist began to rise from the sea. The mist seemed to have appeared out of thin air and Xia ruofei could not help but click his tongue in wonder.

The fog came quickly. In a short while, Xia ruofei felt as if he was in a sauna. His field of vision was no more than two or three meters.

This made Xia ruofei feel a little uneasy. He could not help but release his spiritual power. After all, the White mist was a little strange.

However, to Xia ruofei’s surprise, he realized that his spiritual power was greatly restricted in the fog. He could only detect up to 10 meters away.

“What the hell is this?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Mutter to himself.

He didn’t have any good ideas. He could only roughly identify a direction and then swim forward in the fog. It was difficult to even distinguish North, South, East, and West. It was not an easy thing to distinguish the direction.

Xia ruofei swam forward for more than ten minutes, but he was still in the thick fog. Just as he was about to lose his patience and retrieve the yacht to use the GPS to determine the location, the White fog began to disperse at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.

This really came and went quickly. Xia ruofei watched as the White mist around him quickly faded and disappeared.

Xia ruofei was confused by this phenomenon. However, since the strange white fog had started to disappear, he did not think too much about it.

In at most two to three minutes, the thick white fog completely dissipated.

Xia ruofei turned his head to look for the sun. However, the moment he turned his head, he was stunned. There was a small green Island about a thousand meters behind him!

Before the White fog appeared, Xia ruofei had scanned the surroundings. It was just the vast ocean and there were no islands.

On the sea, Xia ruofei’s vision was unobstructed. If there was such a small island, he would be able to see it from far away.

He had only been swimming in the thick fog for about twenty minutes, and it was difficult for him to move in a straight line. Perhaps he had been running in circles! Even if he could move forward in a straight line and swim very fast, he couldn’t possibly swim very far!

One had to know that the small island was already very close!

Xia ruofei felt that his mind was a little muddled. From the start of the storm last night to the encounter with this Island, he felt that there were too many things that were difficult to explain ...

At this moment, the White realmfox in the space suddenly squeaked excitedly. It was even jumping on the spot and gesturing with its forelimbs.

Xia ruofei came back to her senses and used her mind to sense the surroundings. She immediately exclaimed in surprise,””What did you just say? There’s a world stone on the island ahead?”

When Xia ruofei kept the spirit map space in his body, he had already released the space’s connection to the outside world. If there were really realm stones on the island, it would not be strange for the white leopard to sense it.

However, the island was already so close. Logically speaking, the White realm Fox should have been able to sense it from far away!

Unless ... Xia ruofei thought of a possibility. Since the thick white fog could suppress the range of one’s spiritual energy, it could also possibly hinder the White realm Fox’s sensing of the realm stone.

No matter what, after experiencing such a terrifying storm, the skies were clear now that the rain had passed. Furthermore, they had actually discovered an Island with world stones. Perhaps this was a blessing after surviving a great disaster!

Although the appearance of this Island was a little sudden, since the White realm Fox was sure that there were realm stones on the island, Xia ruofei would definitely go to the island to look for them.

However, he did not take out his yacht as he was already very close to the island. He did not know the situation on the island yet. If it was not a deserted island but a inhabited one, the people on the island would probably see a yacht appearing out of thin air if he took it out now. To the cautious Xia ruofei, this was something that he would never allow to happen.

Moreover, he was not familiar with the surrounding water environment. If there were hidden reefs around the island, the yacht might be damaged before it reached the shore. It would not be worth it. If Xia ruofei wanted to return to land, the azmu yacht was the key!

Xia ruofei was only about a thousand meters away from the island. This distance was nothing to Xia ruofei. When he was in the Army, he had to travel at least a few thousand meters during armed swimming training. Moreover, his physical fitness was much better after the training. This distance was nothing to him.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate and immediately swam towards the nameless Island ...Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
