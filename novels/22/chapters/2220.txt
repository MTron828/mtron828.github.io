2221 The good boss of Huaxia (1)

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Alright. There are a few things you need to remember. First, clean up the reception room in advance tomorrow and prepare the fruits that should be prepared in advance. Second, even though the southeast SARFT is responsible for food and accommodation, station head Gao is here to inspect our company, so we can’t just treat it as nothing. We have to send someone to pick him up. ”

Since Gao Jun had put so much importance on this, Xia ruofei could not be too reserved. After all, he was representing the government, while the Paradise Corporation was just a private enterprise. As the saying went, everyone would give face to a person with high status. If others gave Xia ruofei face, Xia ruofei would always give them the respect they deserved.

“Alright!” Qin Yanan asked as she recorded,”Chairman, then ... What level of leader should we send to pick them up?”

Gao Jun was the Deputy Director of xiangnan TV, and his administrative level was equivalent to the Deputy Director level. If the person who went to pick them up was of a lower level, it was better not to go. Maybe it would be easier to make the other person feel bad if he went, so Qin Yanan naturally had to ask clearly.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Go and report to President Feng. If she’s free, ask her to work hard. If she’s busy with work and can’t leave, then I’ll have to trouble President Dong to make a trip!”

“Alright!” Qin Yanan quickly jotted it down, then asked,”Chairman, do you have any other instructions?”

“No, go do your work!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said.

“Alright!” “Yes,” Qin Yanan replied crisply and bowed slightly to Xia ruofei. He left Xia ruofei’s office with light footsteps and closed the office door gently.

After Qin Yanan left, Xia ruofei continued to read the documents.

About half an hour later, Qin Yanan knocked on the door and walked in.

She came to Xia ruofei’s desk and bowed.””Chairman, I’ve already reported to CEO Feng. She said that she’ll personally pick us up tomorrow morning. She’ll probably attend the southeast radio and television station’s welcome luncheon for the high platform before returning to the company.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, I understand.”

Qin Yanan smiled and said,”Chairman, I’ll report to you. I’ve already moved all my office supplies here. From now on, if you have any instructions, you can directly contact me through the internal line.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””You’re pretty quick!”

“I don’t have many things,” Qin Yanan pursed her lips and smiled.”Your service and guarantee work are the most important!”

“Mm! You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said,”you can go down first ... Oh, right! If there’s nothing else, I won’t be coming in the afternoon. I might not be coming tomorrow morning, but I’ll definitely be there before 3:30 in the afternoon. If you need anything, just call me directly. ”

“Understood!” Qin Yanan said.

Seeing that Xia ruofei didn’t have any other instructions, Qin Yanan filled Xia ruofei’s Cup with hot water and left the office quietly.

Xia ruofei stayed in the office until noon before he picked up his handbag and left.

Qin Yanan, who was at the door, saw Xia ruofei coming out and immediately stood up. He pressed the elevator button for Xia ruofei first and then bowed slightly to him.””Take care, Chairman!”

Xia ruofei smiled at Qin Yanan and nodded, then walked into the elevator.

Xia ruofei was in a good mood as the elevator went down.

Although Xia ruofei did not think much of Feng Jing’s arrangement for him to have a service team, he felt that it was a good idea now. With such a team, he could save a lot of trouble. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Soon, the elevator reached the first floor.

Ding! The elevator door opened and Xia ruofei walked out.

In the lobby on the first floor, this side was the dedicated elevator to the top floor, and the opposite side was the general elevator to the other floors.

Xia ruofei saw a few delivery men in yellow or Blue Coats, holding a few bags of food in their hands, waiting for the elevator.

He couldn’t help but take a few more glances, deep in thought.

Currently, no other company had settled in the Paradise building. All of them were employees of the Paradise Corporation.

According to Xia ruofei’s thoughts, he would rather leave the remaining floors empty than rent them. After all, the company would definitely be in a stage of rapid development in the past few years. The scale of the company would definitely expand rapidly, and the demand for office space would gradually increase.

He didn’t want to rent out his office building just to earn more rent. If that happened, when the company needed more office space in the future, he would have to clear out the tenants first and then renovate it again, which would add a lot of trouble.

It was lunch break, and it seemed that many employees had ordered takeaway.

Xia ruofei pondered for a while. As he walked out, he took out his phone and gave Feng Jing a call.

“Ruofei, what’s the matter?” Feng Jing answered the call and asked in a relaxed tone.

When there were no outsiders around, Feng Jing and Xia ruofei would not show a clear superior – subordinate relationship and would address each other more casually.

“Sister ran, I suddenly have an idea that I want to discuss with you,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Feng Rao laughed,”based on my experience, your new ideas are usually golden!” Every time, it would bring huge benefits to the company! To be honest, I’m quite interested in it. What are you thinking?”
