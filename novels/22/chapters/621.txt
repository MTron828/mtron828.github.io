Chapter 622: Bringing a loli back to the farm (1)

Xia ruofei also hugged Huan Huan affectionately. He reached out and gently pinched Huan Huan’s pink and tender little face. He smiled and said,””Huanhuan, you’ve grown taller!”

Huan Huan seemed to like Xia ruofei’s peaceful aura. She snuggled into Xia ruofei’s arms and asked,”Brother RUO Fei, when did you arrive? Why didn’t you wake me up?”

Xia ruofei teased,”I’ve been here for a long time!” If Huanhuan doesn’t wake up soon, I’ll be going home ...”

Huan Huan pouted as if she had been wronged and tears were about to burst out of her eyes.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”little Huanhuan, I’m just joking with you!” I’ve already finished treating Chengcheng, and I’ve been sitting here waiting for you to wake up!”

Huan Huan laughed through her tears.

Tian Huixin looked helplessly at her daughter, who refused to move from Xia ruofei’s arms, and smiled bitterly.

Huan Huan and Xia ruofei seemed to have endless things to talk about. Moreover, she had been sitting on Xia ruofei’s lap. Tian Huixin called out to her a few times, but she refused to get off. She seemed to have a heartfelt reliance on Xia ruofei.

It was almost time for dinner. Tian Huixin invited Xia ruofei to dinner at the restaurant of Hengfeng hotel.

Tian Huixin asked Xue Biyun to come down to eat with them, but because Chengcheng had been sleeping the entire time, the child had finally settled down for a while. Xue Biyun didn’t have the heart to wake him up, so she politely declined.

Tian Huixin saw that Xue bi Yun was indeed not in the mood to go downstairs for dinner, so she did not force her. Instead, she called Xue bi Yun and ordered two sets of nutritious meals, asking them to send them directly to the guest room.

Then, Tian Huixin brought Xia ruofei and Huanhuan downstairs.

When Huan Huan saw Xia ruofei, she did not want to take another step. Xia ruofei laughed and carried her easily with one hand. He followed Tian Huixin out of the suite.

......

When they arrived at the private room that the hotel had arranged for them, Huan Huan got down from Xia ruofei and sat next to him.

Soon, the exquisite dishes were served. Considering that Xia ruofei had to drive, Tian Huixin did not order any wine. Everyone ate and chatted. There was even a little Huanhuan to lighten the mood. It was quite a happy atmosphere.

After the dessert was served, Xia ruofei patted his head and smiled.””I almost forgot, Huanhuan. Big brother even made you some delicious food!”

Huan Huan’s eyes lit up when she heard that. She clapped her hands and shouted,””Brother RUO Fei! What is it? I want to eat! I want to eat it!”

Tian Huixin glanced at her daughter and teased,””You’ve already eaten a lot just now. Can your small stomach still hold enough food?”

“I’ll definitely be able to eat it if it’s made by big brother ruofei!”Huan Huan raised her head and said.

Tian Huixin was stunned for a moment, and she smiled bitterly at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”aunt Huixin, it’s actually just a dessert. I’ve put it in the refrigerator in the car. Please wait a moment. I’ll go down and get it!”

Xia ruofei patted Huanhuan’s head lovingly and walked out of the room. He went straight to the parking lot downstairs and found his Knight XV SUV.

He took out the things he had prepared before he set off from the car’s refrigerator and returned to the hotel.

The Knight XV’s refrigerator could be powered by a battery after the car was turned off, so the cooling effect was always maintained.

The car’s battery capacity was very large, and it had no problem supplying power to the mini refrigerator for a day and a night. It also came with an automatic protection function. If the owner forgot to turn off the battery to power the refrigerator and didn’t start the car for a few days, the power would be automatically cut off when the battery was close to a critical value, so there was no need to worry about the problem of not being able to start the car the next time they came.

When Xia ruofei appeared in the room with a small bowl that was still emitting cold air, Huan Huan’s eyes lit up.

It was a bowl of crushed ice. The colorful smoothie mixed with various fruit juices and fresh fruits piled up into a small mountain, which gave people a strong appetite visually. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Although the weather was not completely warm yet, in the southern cities, food such as ice cream could already be eaten.

In fact, Xia ruofei had personally made this before they set off. He really liked little Huanhuan and wanted to give her a small gift after not seeing her for so long.

There was nothing special about the fruit juice and fruits. They were all from Xia ruofei’s kitchen and refrigerator. They had all been bought from the supermarket, so the quality was naturally top notch.

The key was that Xia ruofei had added half a bottle of spirit Heart Flower petal solution into the juice. After stirring it well, he put it in the refrigerator for quick freeze and then took it out to make ice.

The spirit Heart Flower petal solution would definitely bring the little girl some benefits.

Looking at her daughter happily taking the glass bowl and eating, Tian Huixin smiled and said,””Little Xia, you’re so busy, yet you still personally made food for Huanhuan! That’s too much trouble for you ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”aunt Huixin, Huanhuan and I are fated. I came out in a hurry today and couldn’t prepare a gift for her. I thought of making some food and bringing it over. I didn’t expect to forget it when I was busy just now. Fortunately, I can make it in time as dessert!”

“I’m really afraid that I’ll spoil her too much!”Tian Huixin smiled and shook her head.

Xia ruofei laughed.”She’s such a cute little princess. It’s only right to spoil her.”

The ingredients that Xia ruofei used to make the crushed ice were all very fresh. The main point was that after adding the spirit Heart Flower petal solution, it naturally had an alluring fragrance. Huanhuan ate with great relish.
