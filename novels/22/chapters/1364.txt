Chapter 1365: Finalizing the cooperation (1)

Translator: 549690339

At this point, Xia ruofei looked at Xu Zixuan and said with a smile,””Zi Xuan, you won’t mind me doing this, right?”

Among them, other than song Rui and Liu Jian who invested 50 million each, Xu Zixuan contributed 10 million. Xia ruofei lent Hou Liang and Wei Jun 5 million each. This meant that the three of them had the same amount of shares.

In reality, Xu Zixuan’s shares didn’t decrease. The extra shares that Hou Liang and Wei Jun had were given out by Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei. Strictly speaking, Xia ruofei was the one who gave the money, so it was Xia ruofei’s shares. However, Xia ruofei gave Hou Liang and Wei Jun money, and at the same time didn’t lend any to Xu Zixuan. He was worried that Xu Zixuan would have other thoughts, so he decided to just tell him everything.

Everyone came out to do things together for fun. If they were unhappy because of this kind of thing, it would not be worth it.

Xu Zi Xuan himself was also a magnanimous person, he immediately laughed when he heard this, saying: “Brother Xia, what are you talking about? How could I mind? If it wasn’t for the fact that I don’t have enough money, I would’ve helped liangzi and Wei Jun too!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It doesn’t matter who pays. We’re all brothers, so we have to calculate the shares clearly. But I can still afford to pay a few million!”

Last time, Hou Liang and Wei Jun had put in a lot of effort for the incident at Tongren Hall. Through this encounter, Wei Jun was also quite compatible with Xia ruofei’s temper. There was no need to talk about Hou Liang, Xia ruofei had known him even earlier. Previously, because of the spokesperson of Yushi cream in the capital, Hou Liang had spared no effort to help and had used many connections. Until now, that small – time artiste was still banned!

Hence, Xia ruofei took this opportunity to return the favor.

Zhao Yongjun saw this and laughed,””RUO Fei, you can’t be the only good person! Wouldn’t you make me look like a bad older brother?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look embarrassed.

Of course, Zhao Yongjun was joking. However, he had his own considerations. He wanted to contribute a little and help Xia ruofei reduce his burden.

So after making a joke, Zhao Yongjun said,””We’re all brothers, how about this, liangzi and Wei Jun will follow ruofei’s suggestion and invest 10 million, but ruofei and I will each pay 5 million. Wei Jun’s share will be lent to ruofei, and I’ll pay for liangzi’s first!”

No matter what, Hou Liang had been with Zhao Yongjun for many years. He had done many things for him. It would be inappropriate if Zhao Yongjun didn’t do anything, especially when Xia ruofei was acting so high and mighty.

Xia ruofei also realized this, so he didn’t decline. He smiled and said,””Alright! Then we’ll do as big brother Zhao says!”

“Thank you, brother Jun, brother Xia!” Hou Liang said gratefully.

Wei Jun also expressed his gratitude.

The bosses had already agreed. If they refused, it would seem pretentious. They could only accept this kind offer. However, they also secretly made up their minds to put in more effort during the construction and operation of the club. Otherwise, they would be letting down the care that Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun had taken for them.

Xia ruofei laughed and waved his hand. “We’re brothers, no need to be so formal!”

“Then let’s calculate the investment amount!” Zhao Yongjun said. With this 10 million, you guys can come up with 130 million. The remaining 170 million, why don’t ... Ruofei, we each take half?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I’m fine with anything!” It doesn’t matter if it’s more or less, I’ll listen to brother Zhao!”

“Then 85 million each!” Zhao Yongjun said readily. It’s decided!”

They were all very trusted friends and brothers, and their fathers had similar political ideas. They were considered allies of the same camp. This kind of relationship was very reliable, so there was no need to fight for the largest shareholder or absolute control.

As a result, everyone in paradise corporation’s cafeteria finally decided on the investment ratio for this investment.

The initial investment was 300 million Chinese dollars. Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun each contributed 85 million Chinese dollars, each holding 28.33% of the shares. Song Rui and Liu Jian each contributed 50 million Chinese dollars, each holding 16.67% of the shares. Xu Zixuan, Hou Liang, and Wei Jun each contributed 10 million Chinese dollars, each holding 3.33% of the shares.

As for the part of the cooperation with Ling’s private kitchen that involved the exchange of shares, everyone would dilute their shares according to the proportion of investment and hold the same proportion of shares of Ling’s private kitchen.

After the matter was settled, the long breakfast finally came to an end. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

At this time, the company’s employees had already finished eating and gone upstairs to work. When everyone’s mood relaxed, they began to clamor about visiting the rich Xia’s farm.

Other than song Rui, it was everyone’s first time here. These young masters from the capital were all very envious of Xia ruofei for having his own farm.

Especially when they found out that Xia ruofei had a 6000 – acre farm in Australia, their eyes lit up and they clamored to make an appointment to go to Australia for some fun.

Xia ruofei naturally agreed with a smile.

He asked ye Lingyun to drive the electric car that the Veterans usually patrolled over, and then he drove himself to show Zhao Yongjun and the others around the farm.

The advanced modern greenhouses, the newly built cold storage, and the heavily guarded pomfrets cultivation workshop all made Zhao Yongjun and the others feel a sense of novelty.
