3312 Victory in the beginning (1)

Finally, after the flame flickered, the flying sword found an opening and accurately cut through the Star Beast’s neck.

However, the Star Beast’s neck was also protected by very thick scales. Although the flying sword was extremely sharp, it could only leave a small wound on the Star Beast’s body. It didn’t even bleed much.

Xia ruofei was already mentally prepared for the Star Beast’s rough skin and thick flesh, so he was not discouraged.

However, the Star Beast was injured, so it became more irritable and roared repeatedly.

Xia ruofei nimbly controlled the two flying swords and the flame while he hid in the outer circle and dealt with the Star Beast. The Star Beast wanted to break out and attack Xia ruofei several times, but it was still afraid of the flame. In addition, the two flying swords were very sharp and its defense was almost impregnable. The Star Beast couldn’t find an opportunity to attack, so it was even more furious.

Xia ruofei was getting more and more stable. Not long after, he left a few more wounds on the Star Beast.

In fact, Xia ruofei had the chance to kill this Star Beast, but he didn’t do so because the forest was too big. He wandered around for a long time before he found a star Beast. It wasn’t easy to kill a Star Beast with thick skin and meat. If he kept this up, he wouldn’t be able to break the record in the remaining time.

Therefore, Xia ruofei had intentionally held back. He wanted to replicate the previous successful experience and let the Star Beast escape so that he could call his friends to take revenge.

This was the fastest way Xia ruofei could think of to complete the task. This was the only way to maximize the effect of the array.

The situation was developing in the direction that Xia ruofei had predicted. The astral beast had gradually calmed down after a long time of attack. It began to realize that it was in danger because the flying sword had almost hit its vital parts twice. In addition, that seemingly ordinary little flame had made it feel a little scared.

Therefore, after a stalemate of more than ten minutes, this astral beast finally made the same choice as the last one. It roared unwillingly, then turned around and ran.

Xia ruofei pretended to chase after him for a while. The Star Beast was determined to escape and also exerted its speed to the extreme. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared into the dense forest.

Xia ruofei was just putting on an act. He didn’t really want to chase after it and end its life.

Hence, Xia ruofei quickly returned and set up the formation at the location of the battle.

The next step was to wait.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t stay where he was. He continued to explore in other directions. As long as it was within the range of his spiritual power, he would be able to detect the star beasts as soon as they came. Time was of the essence, and he had to race against time. It was obviously not the best choice to wait here like an idiot. He still wanted to find a few more star beasts! It would be best if he could set up the traps one by one seamlessly and directly reap the lives of the star beasts.

However, the forest was huge and the density of astral beasts was low. Xia ruofei looked around but did not see any other astral beasts.

He only turned back when the location of the formation was almost out of Xia ruofei’s spiritual perception range.

Fortunately, the fleeing astral beast did not make Xia ruofei wait for too long. Perhaps there was a special way of communication between astral beasts. Xia ruofei could not find a single astral beast in the forest for a long time. The fleeing astral beast only took about ten minutes to return with twenty astral beasts.

Xia ruofei had already returned to the location of the formation and was hiding behind a huge rock.

His spirit power sensed that the Star Beast that had run away just now had returned with its companion to seek revenge. He was immediately invigorated. He stood up from behind the rock and went forward to meet the star Beast.

Soon, the astral beasts also noticed Xia ruofei. They immediately let out fierce roars and increased their speed. They fanned out and surrounded Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei did not panic. He even had the time to confirm the number of astral beasts in this group and whether there were any terrifying high – Level astral beasts mixed in.

Soon, he confirmed that this group of star beasts, including the one that had just escaped, had a total of 21 star beasts, and all of them were intermediate star beasts.

Xia ruofei was relieved. He turned around and ran into the forest.

How could the star beasts let Xia ruofei go so easily? Hence, they increased their speed and chased after Xia ruofei. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Thus, the previous scene played out again.

The twenty – one star beasts all rushed into the range of the trap and kill array. Their vision was suddenly blocked by the fog, and they suddenly became twenty – one headless flies.

Xia ruofei emerged from the forest. He could easily sense the exact location of the 21 star beasts in the array. A sharp look flashed in his eyes.

This time, he didn’t hesitate at all. Before the star beasts could even try to break the formation with force, he had already formed a hand seal and launched an attack on them. Moreover, he didn’t want to save spirit stones at all. He directly adjusted the attack of the formation to the maximum, all in order to buy as much time as possible.

Immediately, countless streaks of black light appeared within the formation, almost filling the entire space.
