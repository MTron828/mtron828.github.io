Chapter 469: Chapter 390 – clash of eight characters (1)

After Xia ruofei entered the alley, heavy footsteps could be heard behind him. It was obvious that the other party had no intention of hiding their whereabouts.

A faint smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He stopped in his tracks and turned around slowly.

He saw a 1.9 – meter tall bald man standing still at the entrance of the alley.

Due to the light, Xia ruofei could not see the expression on the bald man’s face. However, the familiar murderous aura made Xia ruofei squint his eyes.

This person must have killed someone before.

But ... So what? I can’t even count the number of lives I’ve ended!

Xia ruofei thought of the body tempering soup he had been drinking and the amazing body – forging movements. The smile on his face grew wider.

The bald man, Zhao he, was also observing his opponent. Unlike Xia ruofei, he found that the young man standing in front of him was very ordinary.

Apart from being pleasing to the eye, his opponent was just an ordinary young man. He had no aura from head to toe, and he didn’t feel the slightest bit of danger.

What’s the use of being good – looking? It’s the same even after being beaten into a pig head! Zhao he’s face slowly revealed a sinister smile. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He stepped forward without a word and then sped up towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei remained standing at the same spot. Facing Zhao he, who was bursting with murderous intent, his expression was extremely calm.

It was only when Zhao he had already rushed up that Xia ruofei exerted force in his legs and shot out like lightning. His target was Zhao he.

Zhao he was shocked by Xia ruofei’s speed.

By the time Zhao he reacted, Xia ruofei was already right in front of him. There was no time to think about how Xia ruofei could have such a strange speed. Zhao he gritted his teeth and clenched his bowl – sized fist, smashing it towards Xia ruofei’s head.

However, he only felt a blur in front of his eyes. Xia ruofei, who was clearly in front of him a moment ago, suddenly disappeared without a trace.

Zhao he felt all the hair on his body stand up, and a sense of extreme danger arose in his heart. He almost subconsciously twisted his body and forcibly stabilized his center of gravity.

At this moment, Zhao he felt a strong wind coming at him. Before he could react, he felt a strong force on his waist. Then, his heavy body, which weighed more than 180 pounds, was directly sent flying. He hit the wall of the courtyard in the alley with a dull sound.

This speed, this strength ... Was he still human? Zhao he grunted and thought with an ashen face.

At this moment, he had even forgotten about the excruciating pain in his body. In fact, Xia ruofei’s kick had already dealt him a heavy blow, especially when he had hit the wall. He had broken at least five bones.

Xia ruofei had never shown any mercy to his enemies.

He did not hesitate to step on Zhao he. With two cracking sounds, Zhao he’s legs were broken by Xia ruofei.

Zhao he trembled in pain. He gritted his teeth so hard that his lower lip bled, but he did not scream.

Xia ruofei frowned slightly. This guy was obviously a tough guy. It would take a lot of effort to get the mastermind out of him.

However, it was only a small effort. Xia ruofei had received professional interrogation training and had endless ways to deal with prisoners.

There was a limit to a person’s endurance. This was determined by their physiological characteristics. The difference was that people with strong willpower could last a little longer, while people who had received professional anti – interrogation training could last a little longer.

Ever since Xia ruofei joined the Army, he had carried out many missions and there had never been a mouth that he could not pry open.

Zhao he was panting heavily. His eyes were like a wild beast’s as he glared at Xia ruofei.

A cold smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He squatted down in front of Zhao he and asked indifferently,””Tell me! Who asked you to come?”

Zhao he clenched his teeth and glared at Xia ruofei fiercely without saying a word.

Xia ruofei had already expected this and was not surprised at all. It would be strange if Zhao he confessed immediately!

Many painful interrogation methods flashed through Xia ruofei’s mind. He had to choose the most effective and painful one from these methods and use it on Zhao he.

Xia ruofei made his choice quickly.

He gently clenched his fist, and his knuckles cracked. Then, he slowly reached out and grabbed Zhao he’s collar ...

“Stop!” “Let go of that man!” A cold voice shouted.”Put your hands on your head and turn around!”

Xia ruofei was stunned. Why did this voice sound so familiar?

When Xia ruofei turned around, a bitter smile appeared on his face. It was the big – breasted police beauty, Qin Xiao Yu, who had taken him to the police station last time.

Officer Qin and four other Criminal Police officers were watching Xia ruofei vigilantly. In view of the tragic scene, Zhao he’s legs were bent at a strange angle. It was obvious that the officers were ruthless. They took out their guns and pointed the black muzzles at Xia ruofei.

Qin Xiao Yu already felt that the back of the figure was familiar and when Xia ruofei turned around, she couldn’t help but frown.””Why is it you again!”

“Officer Qin, I should be the one asking you that ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Are our eight characters at odds with each other?” Why do I bump into you everywhere?”
