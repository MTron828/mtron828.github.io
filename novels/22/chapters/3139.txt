3140 Breakthrough point?_

Mu Sheng also stroked his beard and laughed.”Nephew Chen is right. We didn’t have any clue before. But now, at least we have a research direction.”

Liu Mansha’s expression was somewhat excited as she said,”Fellow Daoist Xia’s discovery has indeed allowed us to take a big step towards the truth! If we continue to research in this direction, we might be able to make a breakthrough soon!”

Xia ruofei saw how excited everyone was and wanted to pour cold water on them.

The black dots on the surface of the floating point sphere might be undetectable to ordinary people, but under the detection of a cultivator’s spiritual power, they were completely undetectable. Xia ruofei didn’t believe that the nascent soul or even the immortal soul Stage cultivators in the ancient cultivation world wouldn’t notice it.

Such an obvious clue, yet they were unable to make any substantial discoveries. What did this mean?

It meant that it would not be easy to decipher the content of the floating point.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had some basic knowledge of cryptography during his military service. From a cryptography point of view, even if Xia ruofei’s guess was correct, each floating point represented a word. The black spots on the surface of the floating Points corresponded to different words according to the style of the different sections. It was extremely difficult to decipher the meaning of the floating Points based on these.

Over three thousand Floating Points were equivalent to over three thousand samples.

And some of them were repeated.

They could start with these repeated Floating Points and list out the possible words. Then, they could make an arrangement according to the level of the possibility and replace these Floating Points with the corresponding words. Then, together with the context, they could deduce the words represented by the other Floating Points.

This was a process of constant trial and error and constant trial and error.

In theory, the first step was the most difficult. As more and more Floating Points were deciphered, the speed of cracking the later steps would also become faster and faster. This was because there would be more Floating Points converted into context as a reference.

No matter what, the amount of calculation required was an astronomical figure.

Xia ruofei made some speculations and finally understood why the ancient cultivation world had been unable to produce any results after 50 years of research.

“Two seniors, brother Chen, I’m afraid things aren’t as simple as they seem. There are countless possibilities to deduce the content of more than 3000 words from these Floating Points alone. To try all of these possibilities, it might take decades. ”

Mu Sheng found it unbelievable and said,””Little brother Xia, I don’t think it’s that exaggerated! It’s only a total of three thousand plus Floating Points!”

Mu Sheng thought from the perspective of a golden core stage cultivator. Because they had strong spiritual power and high brain development, their thinking speed was much faster than ordinary people. He felt that it wouldn’t take long to try it word by word. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Three to five years would be the maximum!

How could it be impossible to complete it in decades?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sect leader mu, let me give you an example.” Currently, there are about two to three thousand Chinese characters that are commonly used. If it is the ones that are used more frequently, there are at least one to two hundred of them. In other words, even if he only checked for high – frequency Chinese characters, there were one to two hundred possibilities for these Floating Points that had appeared many times. And for every single floating point deciphered, we will have to multiply it by two to three thousand. In addition, we will have to take into account the age of this token and the difference between the words of that time and the words of today ... The final amount of calculation may be beyond our imagination!”

“Uncle mu, brother Xia is right,” Chen Xuan added. I’ve heard that some organizations in the secular world that study code – cracking use super – computers with extremely fast computing speed to do their work because it’s completely human ...”

Suddenly, Chen Xuan stopped and looked at Xia ruofei. Both of their eyes lit up and they shouted in unison,””Supercomputers!”

“What chicken? Wasn’t chicken supposed to be eaten? How can you help us solve the secret of the token?” Mu Sheng was confused.

Mu Sheng did not know much about the secular world, and he was not interested in modern technology.

In comparison, his son Mu Jianfei was still a young man, so he was more or less familiar with the secular world.

Seeing his father’s confused look, mu Jianfei couldn’t help but cover his face. He raised his head and said helplessly,””Father, it’s a supercomputer. It’s a piece of technological equipment from the secular world. It’s not like the chicken you usually cook.”

Xia ruofei explained briefly and said,”Sect leader mu, a supercomputer is an advanced machine that can replace human beings to perform some complicated calculations. Its biggest feature is its large data storage capacity and its computing speed far exceeds that of the human brain. Take our Huaxia ‘s’ godly light of Taihu territory ‘supercomputer as an example. It can complete an average of 930 million calculations per second, and its fastest speed can reach 1.25 billion calculations. No matter how strong a cultivator’s spiritual power is, it’s impossible for them to do this. ”

Mu Sheng was dumbfounded and said,””A trillion times ...”

Actually, Xia ruofei’s explanation was not very accurate, but it was very direct. It allowed Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha to understand the huge advantage of supercomputers over the human brain.

In fact, supercomputers were not meant to be compared with the human brain at all because they were not on the same order of magnitude.

Chen Xuan said excitedly,”brother Xia, it might really be possible!” If we were to calculate the text represented by each floating point bit by bit, we might not be able to complete it even if we worked hard for our entire lives. However, if we were to hand it over to a supercomputer, it would definitely be much faster!”
