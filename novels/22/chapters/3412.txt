“How could there be such a thing…” Scholar Yuntai said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Then, he seemed to have thought of something and suddenly said,”fellow Daoist Xia, you said that it can increase one’s cultivation, but I did think of something… However, this trial space is so strange that even the golden thread nether snake can’t store it in a storage treasure. I’m not sure if there’s such a thing…”

Xia ruofei said,”senior Yuntai, why don’t you tell us what it is?” It’s not good to speak halfway, isn’t this tantalizing?”

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” Grandmaster Yuntai said with a smile.”I was just thinking about something. I didn’t mean to keep you in suspense.”

Then, he paused for a moment and said,””Fellow Daoist Xia, under normal circumstances, there will be an extremely precious spirit fruit in places where golden thread nether snakes appear. It’s called the Vermillion Jade Fruit. Golden thread nether snakes don’t have any inner cores that can increase a cultivator’s cultivation level, but this Vermillion Jade Fruit can greatly increase a cultivator’s cultivation level. In fact, golden thread nether snakes are fond of eating the Vermilion Jade Fruit, so they usually guard the place where the Vermilion Jade Fruit grows, waiting for the fruit to ripen. At the same time, they also prevent other people or demonic beasts from taking the Vermilion Jade Fruit before they do!”

Xia ruofei was excited when he heard that. He quickly asked,””Senior Yuntai, does the Vermilion Jade Fruit look like a red wild fruit? The tree with the Vermilion Jade Fruit wouldn’t be very tall, and the leaves would be long and have sharp teeth on the edges?”

Xia ruofei was reminded of the two dark red fruits he saw in the poisonous fog at the bottom of the cliff. The reason he had found his way there and encountered the goldthread nether snake was because of the fruit’s unique fragrance. It was very alluring, and even the tight – fitting spacesuits could not block it. It was a fragrance that seeped into one’s soul. Xia ruofei had followed the trail of incense and found the goldthread nether snake.

Scholar Yuntai said with a smile,”the Vermillion Jade Fruit is indeed dark red. It has long, sharp, saw – edged leaves. However, these are not any obvious characteristics. Moreover, there are several kinds of spiritual fruits in the cultivation world that look like this. Its most prominent characteristics are actually…”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei interrupted master Yuntai and said,””It’s actually a special fragrance! Am I right? Senior Yuntai, the fragrance of this Vermilion Jade Fruit is very alluring, and cultivators with lower cultivation might even lose their minds. Moreover, this fragrance seeps into the soul, so even if you hold your breath, you can still feel the rich and alluring fragrance, right?” “That’s right!” Layman Yuntai said in surprise,”so you’ve seen the Vermillion Jade Fruit before, fellow Daoist Xia?”

“It wasn’t before, it was just now!” Xia ruofei said,”at the bottom of this cliff, where I met the golden thread nether snake, there is a fruit tree like this. There are two Vermillion Jade fruits on it. It’s those dark red fruits, they should have been fully ripened!”

“Oh?” Layman Yuntai asked,”so … The bottom of this cliff should be shrouded in clouds and mist?” And those clouds are highly toxic and can corrode most things, right?”

This time, it was Xia ruofei’s turn to be stunned. He said,””Yes! Senior Yuntai, could it be that this poisonous mist is related to the Vermilion Jade Fruit?” Scholar Yuntai chuckled and said,”not only is the Vermilion Jade Fruit itself not poisonous, it can also greatly improve one’s cultivation. It can be said to be a very rare and precious natural treasure!” However, the most amazing thing is that this Vermilion Jade Fruit tree will release a poisonous mist, and as the Vermilion Jade Fruit ripened higher and higher, the mist released would also become thicker and thicker. All of it would gather around the Vermilion Jade Fruit tree, forming a natural poisonous barrier!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei immediately told him what he had observed about the poisonous mist.

Scholar Yuntai pondered for a while and said,””The poisonous fog is already so thick and wide. In addition to the appearance, color, and smell of the Vermilion Jade Fruit that you described, we can basically judge that the Vermilion Jade Fruit should have ripened.”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s a crime to leave such a good spiritual fruit in the trial space! I’ll go and pick them all now!”

Layman Yuntai was puzzled,”didn’t you say that you can’t take anything away from this trial space?” What’s the use of taking it off?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”senior Yuntai, I can’t take it away, but I can eat it!” It’s just that they can’t be stored in Storage Treasures, it’s not like they can’t be used!”

Xia ruofei was quite confident in this. The yellow jade essence was like this before. Although he could not store it in the spirit map space, Xia ruofei could absorb it normally.

It was because of the large amount of yellow jade essence that both Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s spiritual power had made great progress.

The Vermilion Jade Fruit this time would probably be the same.

If he couldn’t take it away, then he would just cat it directly!

Scholar Yuntai was stunned for a moment, and then he laughed at himself and said,””That makes sense! I’m really getting old and muddle – headed … However, the poison formed by the Vermillion Jade Fruit tree is extremely corrosive, so it’s not easy to pick!”

“I was already near the Vermilion Jade Fruit tree, but I wasn’t sure if the Vermilion Jade Fruit could be consumed or if it was poisonous. When we arrived at the fruit tree, we found the goldthread nether snake hiding in the dark, very close to us. We didn’t have time to think so much and immediately started running for our lives!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”although the poisonous fog is terrifying, it’s not dangerous to me..”
