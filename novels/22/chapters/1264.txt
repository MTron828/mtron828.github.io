Chapter 1265: Chapter 767 – Chu Yin’s heart rises, and he makes his move (1)

Translator: 549690339

Once a horse’s leg was broken, the best solution was euthanizing it. The reason for this was that the recovery period of a fracture was very long, and horses were Born to Run, so during the long recovery period, they would almost certainly break the bones that had not yet healed. After all, no one could restrict the movement of a horse for a long time. It would take at least three months!

If he could heal the broken bones of the horse in a short time, wouldn’t this problem be solved?

Xia ruofei obviously had the ability to do so as long as he was willing to pay the price of the petals of the spirit Heart Flower.

Most of the time, he used a diluted petal solution. He didn’t use a lot of it. Now that there were more and more petals in the spirit map space, Xia ruofei didn’t think it was a big deal to use one or two to save the “star of Hong Kong.”

It could be said that he was fated to be the “star of Hong Kong”. After all, he had come here for the “star of Hong Kong”. He had even bet 10000 Hong Kong dollars on the “star of Hong Kong” winning the game!

Of course, the main reason was that Xia ruofei could not help but feel sympathetic after hearing MA Xiong talk about the reason why the horses had to be euthanized after their legs were broken.

Although it was beyond his ability to cure all the horses that had encountered such injuries, since he had encountered them, what was the harm in spending one or two Spirit Heart Flower petals?

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei also quickened his pace and chased after Guo Hongjiang.

The facilities in the arena were complete. There was a stable not far away. When Xia ruofei and MA Xiong followed Guo Hongjiang into the stable, it was already surrounded by many staff.

These were all people who worked for Guo Hongjiang.

The star of Hong Kong’s series of dazzling results was definitely due to the support of an entire team.

Guo Hongjiang had equipped it with a professional trainer, an experienced rider, and a complete team of veterinarians. With some other staff, the whole team was quite large.

“Director Guo!”

“Director Guo!”

Everyone greeted Guo Hongjiang one after another, but everyone’s mood was a little low.

Such a champion horse, because of an accident, everything before had become a fleeting cloud.

The members of the team had spent almost all their time with the “star of Hong Kong”, but now they had to send it to heaven with their own hands. It was hard to describe the feeling.

Guo Hongjiang nodded with a gloomy expression.

The “star of Hong Kong” was now tied to a rack with a rope. The horse was very strong and was struggling in pain. It was impossible to control it with human strength.

Its shiny fur was now covered with mud, and the fracture on its hind leg was obviously twisted and swollen.

The star of Hong Kong screamed in pain from time to time. He struggled hard, and the hemp rope cut into his flesh, leaving blood marks.

The muscles on Guo Hongjiang’s face trembled as he walked to the “star of Hong Kong.”

The “star of Hong Kong” seemed to have felt something and looked up at his master.

Xia ruofei and MA Xiong did not say anything. They just stood quietly beside Guo Hongjiang.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was shocked to see that “star of Hong Kong” had tears in its eyes. It seemed to have predicted its fate. However, after seeing its master, it stopped struggling and looked at Guo Hongjiang with tears in its eyes.

Xia ruofei was shocked.

Guo Hongjiang didn’t say anything. He just stared at the “star of Hong Kong” for a few minutes.

The staff at the side didn’t dare to say anything. They didn’t even dare to breathe.

The veterinarians in white coats had already prepared the injection to euthanize the “star of Hong Kong”, but they didn’t dare to remind Guo Hongjiang at the moment. They just waited carefully with a large syringe.

The colorless and transparent liquid in the syringe was shocking under the light of the stables.

After a long time, Guo Hongjiang sighed and turned his head away from the star of Hong Kong. He said softly,””Let’s start!”

The veterinarian who received the order immediately came forward.

“Wait!” Xia ruofei quickly shouted. Director Guo, please wait!”

Guo Hongjiang frowned slightly and turned to look at Xia ruofei in confusion.

MA Xiong couldn’t help but pull on Xia ruofei’s sleeve, trying to remind him.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t seem to notice it. He still said to Guo Hongjiang with a slightly anxious tone,””Director Guo, don’t euthanize the star of Hong Kong yet! There might be a way!”

At this moment, Guo Hongjiang was in a terrible mood. However, he was still considered to have some self – restraint. Furthermore, Xia ruofei was a guest that he had invited. If it was someone else who had said this, he would have turned hostile on the spot. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The horse racing industry had been in Hong Kong for more than 100 years. For horses with broken legs, the most humane and scientific treatment was euthanizing them. This was common sense in the circle.

Even with the rapid development of science and Technology in recent years, this problem was still an unsolvable problem.

When MA Xiong heard Xia ruofei’s words, he knew that things were going to be bad.

He quickly said,”Xia Sheng, didn’t I just explain it to you?” A broken leg is fatal to a horse. If there’s a way, director Guo will do everything in his power to save the star of Hong Kong!”
