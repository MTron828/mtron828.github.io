Translator: 549690339

Hence, Xia ruofei was very happy to do so. Without a second word, he took ten more servings and brought them over.

Elder song personally received Xia ruofei.

After wearing the spirit – gathering Jade Guanyin on his body for a few days, elder song’s energy was much better than before. His entire face was glowing, and he looked quite good.

Elder song asked Xia ruofei to stay for a meal. His words were full of care and concern. He told Xia ruofei to look for song Qiming if he was in trouble or to call him directly.

After Xia ruofei finished his meal, he left the song family’s old residence and returned to the courtyard house to pack up. Then, he asked Wu Qiang to drive him to the capital’s airport.

After getting off the car, Xia ruofei smiled at Wu Qiang and said,””Wu Qiang, after I go back, help me look after the courtyard in Beijing. If there’s any problem that you can’t solve, you can go to brother Zhao!”

“Don’t worry, boss!”Said Wu Qiang with a serious face.

Xia ruofei patted Wu Qiang’s shoulder and did not ask him to send him in. He carried his simple luggage and walked into the airport departure hall.

Security check, waiting, boarding, everything went smoothly.

At 3:30 in the afternoon, Xia ruofei’s Airbus 320 took off and soared into the sky under the afternoon sun.

Two hours later, Xia ruofei walked out of the departure hall of Sanshan airport.

Although this trip was not long, Xia ruofei felt as if it had been a lifetime ago. It was mainly because too many things had happened.

He had accidentally picked up a lucky opportunity and earned almost 200 million Yuan. He then spent another 100 million Yuan and became one of the property owners in the capital. Moreover, it was a large siheyuan in the center of the city. He also made a group of rich and powerful friends from all walks of life.

Of course, this was not the most important thing.

Instead, he was caught off guard by the icy beauty Lu You’s confession ...

In fact, Xia ruofei had not yet recovered from the shock.

Looking at the setting sun in the distance, Xia ruofei was a little dazed.

“Brother Xia ... Brother Xia!”

“Ah?” Xia ruofei snapped out of his daze and realized that ye Lingyun was already standing beside him.

“Brother Xia, what are you thinking about?” Ye linyun asked with a smile.

Before Xia ruofei flew back to San Shan, she gave ye Lingyun a call and told him her flight number so that he could arrange for someone to pick her up.

Ye Lingyun was now the head of security at paradise Corporation. At the same time, he was also in charge of the establishment of the tea leaves studio. He was very busy with work, but ye Lingyun still came to pick them up personally.

“Oh, Ling Yun is here! It’s fine, let’s go back!” Xia ruofei returned to her senses and smiled.

Ye Lingyun took Xia ruofei’s bag and the two of them walked to the parking lot.

On the way back, Xia ruofei briefly explained the company’s situation to ye Lingyun, then leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes to rest.

Ye Lingyun quickly turned off the car’s sound system and drove quietly.

The Mercedes – Benz drove smoothly on the airport Highway.

After a long time, Xia ruofei suddenly opened his eyes and asked,””Ling Yun, how’s the construction of the tea – making workshop going?”

Ye Lingyun drove steadily as he replied,””It’s all done! We can make tea at any time, but we don’t have tea leaves yet!”

This season was not the production season for tea leaves, and there was still some time before the autumn tea would be released.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll take care of the tea leaves. I’ll get you a batch of high – quality tea leaves in a few days. You can choose a few smart veterans to help you. We’ll make a batch of tea leaves and see how good the quality is!”

“Yes!” Ye Lingyun was overjoyed. Brother Xia, I promise to complete the task!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Show us what you’ve got. Let’s see if you’ve learned anything from Mr. Li Zhifu!”

“Alright! Just knock!” Ye linyun said happily.

When he returned to the farm, it was almost time for dinner. Now that Hu Zi’s mother had moved back, the villa was empty. Xia ruofei was too lazy to cook for himself, so he went to the company cafeteria for dinner before returning to the villa alone with his bag.

Xia ruofei came out of the shower and picked up his phone, ready to call Ling Qingxue. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After staying in Beijing for so many days, the two of them had only contacted each other by phone and WeChat. Now that she was back, he definitely had to let her know.

Moreover, Xia ruofei had even made a protective Jade Leaf this time. Even Lu You was equipped with it. As Ling Qingxue was his official girlfriend, he naturally had to give it to her at the first opportunity.

Just as Xia ruofei found Ling Qingxue’s number in his call history and was about to dial it, his phone rang with a WeChat notification.

Xia ruofei saw the notification that popped up on the top of his phone and his eyelids twitched. It was a WeChat message from Lu You.

He hesitated for a moment, but he still clicked on the message.

“I heard you’ve returned to the three mountains? Do you have time to have dinner together tomorrow? Don’t worry, I’m not the only one. There’s also little Yueyue who’s worried about you ...”

At the end of the message was a laughing emoji with its mouth covered.

Xia ruofei muttered to himself for a long time, not knowing how to reply to this message.

Just as Xia ruofei was hesitating, his phone vibrated again. This time, it was a call.

Xia ruofei was deep in thought, and the phone in his hand kept vibrating. After a while, he finally noticed Ling Qingxue’s image on the screen. He quickly shook his head and answered the call.

“Qingxue ...” Xia ruofei’s voice sounded guilty.

Ling Qingxue naturally didn’t notice it. She smiled and asked,””What are you doing? Why did you take so long to answer the phone?”
