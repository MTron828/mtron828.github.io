Translator: 549690339

It was better to do such things occasionally. If he really wanted to make money, he had plenty of ways to do so since he had the spirit map space in his hands. He would not choose to expose himself in the spotlight and become the center of attention.

When they returned to the MA residence, little Huanhuan still insisted on not going to sleep.

Although the little girl was very tired, she refused to go upstairs and insisted on waiting for Xia ruofei in the living room.

After seeing Xia ruofei, little Huanhuan, whose eyelashes had grown a lot longer, was no longer sleepy. She happily pounced on Xia ruofei and did not mind the smell of alcohol on him.

Tian Huixin and Ma Zhiming couldn’t help but feel a little jealous when they saw this.

Xia ruofei played with Huanhuan for a while more. In the end, Tian Huixin persuaded the little girl and she finally said Goodnight to Xia ruofei reluctantly.

Xia ruofei finally got away and went to the guest room that the MA family had prepared for him. He took a shower and went to sleep.

The next morning, Xia ruofei took the initiative to send Huanhuan to kindergarten after breakfast. He waved goodbye to her at the entrance of the kindergarten.

Xia ruofei did not tell Huanhuan that he was going back to the three mountains today. He was afraid that the little girl would be sad. Although he knew that Huanhuan would be sad when she learned that he had left Hong Kong after school in the evening, Xia ruofei could not bear to tell her the news in person.

After sending Huan Huan back to the MA residence, the people sent by Guo Hongjiang had already arrived.

He had sent his own Butler to bring the car over, which was second only to him personally.

After all, Xia ruofei was still a young man in his 20s. If Guo Hongjiang came here personally, it would definitely attract the attention of some people. He knew that Xia ruofei did not want to attract attention, so he sent his Butler over.

The Butler was his most trusted aide, and basically represented him.

Guo Hongjiang’s career was so big, so he must be very skilled in dealing with people.

“Uncle Guo, why did you come here personally? you’ve really worked hard!” Xia ruofei said gently to Guo shunian, the Butler of Guo Hongjiang.

Guo shunian bowed slightly and said with a humble expression,””Mr. Xia, you’re too kind. This is my duty!”

“Mr. Xia,” Guo shunian continued,”the MA family has already put your luggage in the car. But there’s something I need to report to you.”

“Uncle Guo, speak!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“I’ve received news from the Hong Kong airport. Due to the weather, the airport is temporarily closed this morning. Our departure time may be slightly delayed.” Guo shunian said.

“Oh? The airport is closed?” Xia ruofei asked,”is the situation serious?”

“It’s not a big problem. The main problem is that the clouds are too low and the forecast said that there might be thunderstorms. It doesn’t meet the flight conditions, so the airport is temporarily closed.” Guo shunian said,”but according to the satellite cloud image, the visibility will meet the flight standard in about two hours. It won’t take too long.”

“Oh, that’s good.” Xia ruofei nodded and said.

“Mr. Xia,” Guo shunian said,”I’ve asked director Guo for your opinion. He has some time this morning, and would like to invite you to the house on Repulse Bay Road so that you can recognize the door.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”okay!” I’ll follow your arrangements!”

“Shall we set off now?” Guo shunian said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said goodbye to MA Xiong and his family. Then, he got into the Bentley that Guo shunian had brought.

The car drove smoothly along the mountain road. After passing through a section of the mountain road, they arrived at the seaside. After driving along the seaside road for more than ten minutes, they arrived at the Emerald Home Real Estate. This was the real estate where the house that Guo Hongjiang had given Xia ruofei was located. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Guo shunian sat in the front passenger seat and turned to Xia ruofei.””Mr. Xia, we’ll be there soon.”

The car drove into the residential area and drove along the beautiful road for a short while before arriving at a high – rise residence.

Xia ruofei looked left and right after he got out of the car. There were only eight high – rise residential buildings in the entire community. He could vaguely see a corner of the beach in the distance. He estimated that the whole Repulse Bay could be seen from the top floor.

The distance between the buildings was also very large. The buildings were scattered among each other, so the view of each building was not blocked. Basically, every household could enjoy the unparalleled sea view. Of course, the view was better on the higher floors, but the price naturally rose as well.

In Hong Kong’s qianshui Bay, where every inch of land was worth its weight in gold, the distance between the buildings was so large that it could be seen that the location of the building was quite high – end.

Guo shunian didn’t bring Xia ruofei upstairs immediately. Instead, he registered Xia ruofei’s information as the owner, and applied for an access card to the community, a Bluetooth sensor for the parking lot, and so on.

Of course, all of this did not waste much time.

Guo Hongjiang was the big boss here, and the property management of the community was also managed by the property company under Guo Hongjiang’s real estate Group. With a phone call from Guo shunian, the person in charge of the Property Management Office was already waiting for them downstairs before they arrived.

The access card and Bluetooth sensor were prepared in advance. Xia ruofei only helped to enter the facial recognition and fingerprint identification information.

It was only then that Xia ruofei found out that the house that Guo Hongjiang had given him had four parking lots for townhouses.

After Xia ruofei entered the information, Guo shunian and the manager of the Property Management Office accompanied Xia ruofei and took the elevator to the top floor.
