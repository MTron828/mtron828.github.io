3250 A free lunch?_

In the end, Mannu said,”Mr. Masker, I don’t know how Dr. Xia did it.” However ... To be able to make his condition improve so much without any surgery or chemotherapy, he had to admit that this was a miracle! Congratulations, Mr. Masker, you’ve found an excellent doctor! Our treatment plan should be put on hold ...”

He knew very well that no matter how hard he and his team tried, they would not be able to achieve such a healing effect due to the limitations of reality.

Elon Musk’s anxious heart finally settled down. He said,””Does this mean that there’s a high chance that little X’s illness can be cured?”

“At least, that’s what it looks like at the moment!” Of course, whether it could be completely cured and whether it would relapse after the treatment would depend on the effect of the follow – up treatment. I can only say that the chances are very high!”

Elonmask was pleasantly surprised, but he quickly controlled his emotions. He took a deep breath and said,””Thank you very much! Dr. Mannu, you and your team have also done an excellent job, thank you for your contribution!”

“This is all thanks to doctor Xia. We didn’t provide any help.” Mannu said as a matter of fact.

He knew that he had completely lost this competition, so he might as well be open and honest. Maybe he could leave a good impression on the boss.

“Of course, doctor Xia’s work is amazing!” Elon Musk said with a smile. However, your support checks are also essential! Dr. Mannu, I still want to talk to Dr. Xia in private. I think ... Gramus will be very happy to hear this news. I hope you can share this good news with her as soon as possible!”

Mannu tactfully replied,”alright!” Mr. Masker, I’ll take my leave first!”

Elon Musk smiled and nodded.

After Mannu left the room, Elon Musk then said to Xia ruofei excitedly,””Mr. Xia! You’ve created a medical miracle! It’s the luckiest thing in little X’s life to have met a doctor like you!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”To me, this is just a normal treatment. It’s not a miracle. I’ve already expected the result.” Besides, I don’t want to be a world – famous doctor. ”

At this point, Xia ruofei winked at Elon Musk and said with a smile,””I’m sure Mr. Masker is very clear about what I care more about!”

“Of course!” Elon Musk nodded and said. “Mr. Xia, the production of parts for the spacesuits has already begun, but this will involve many companies. We still need to assemble them in secret, so you may have to wait a few more days ... The production of the oxygen supply module is relatively simple. The factory has already pushed its production to the maximum, and I believe that we should be able to prepare enough oxygen supply modules in two weeks!”

“It seems that Mr. Mersk has indeed done his best.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you very much!”

Elon Musk lowered his head and pondered for a moment. He suddenly raised his head and said,””Mr. Xia, I can provide you with a Dragon Ship! If you need it ...”

“Of course!” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows in surprise.”We really need it!” It would be great if Mr. Masker was willing to help! However, the time ...”

“If I’m not wrong, you don’t have any requirements for the ship’s dynamic performance and control.” Elon Musk said,”in other words, you need a spaceship that can provide a space for human survival in space. Its role is to provide oxygen and a suitable environmental temperature, as well as to shield against fatal cosmic rays, right?”

“Very accurate!” Xia ruofei gave a thumbs up to Elon Musk and added,”one more thing, the space can not be too narrow. It must be able to accommodate nine normal – sized adults. It’s best to open up a certain amount of private space.”

If it was a space voyage that lasted one or two months, even the cultivators would have to solve the “three emergencies” problem. Also, there were both men and women in the expedition team. If everyone was wearing an EVA suit, they could only solve the problem by right, including adult paper and diapers. In addition, the “waste” had to be temporarily stored in the storage magical equipment through the EVA suit, which was a bit uncomfortable to think about.

If they were in a spaceship, they would have to create a relatively comfortable environment as much as possible.

Elon Musk pondered for a moment and said,””It shouldn’t be a big problem.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He sat down on the sofa opposite Xia ruofei and continued,””The Dragon ship’s design can carry up to seven people. Even if we reduce the equipment, it’s not enough to accommodate nine people. However ... When our spacecraft was designed, it was built according to the standard interface. The spacecraft can dock with the International Space Station. In other words, we can connect the two Dragon spacecraft together through the docking mechanism. Of course, there might not be a need for two spaceships. Our company has also designed some cabin modules for orbital travel, including a rest cabin. As long as one or two more such cabins are connected to the Dragon Ship, the demand will be met!”

“Is the connection secure?” Xia ruofei asked.

“There’s no problem with the tightness and sturdiness of the interface!” There’s a special locking mechanism designed to maintain the docking state and operate in orbit for a long time. This way, it’s like several cabins connected together on the inside, and we can distinguish the function space!”

“It sounds great!” Xia ruofei asked,”can we make it in time?”

“It shouldn’t be a big problem!” “A lot of the materials and parts are ready,” said Elon Musk.”They just need to be assembled!”

At this point, elonmask reminded,””However, I have to remind you that after a spacecraft dock with multiple cabins, it will be in an irregular shape. It definitely can’t be launched into space. No rocket can fit it. Also, with so many cabins and nine people, it’s already beyond the maximum load of the rocket, so it can only be used on the ground ... In fact, these cabins are usually launched in batches and then docked in orbit. This is the prototype of the space station. ”

“We didn’t want to launch them into space with rockets!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s why this is not a problem at all!”

“Then it’s okay!” Elon Musk smiled and said,”this problem can be considered solved! Mr. Xia, I can provide you with the spaceship and the extended cabin for free!”

“Thank you, Mr. Masker!” Xia ruofei smiled.”I want to know what price we have to pay to get the Dragon ship’s extended cabin.”

There was no such thing as a free lunch in the world. The more free something was, the greater the price one had to pay.

Naturally, Xia ruofei had to ask clearly in advance.

Of course, even if Elon Musk was demanding an exorbitant price and caused the business to be unable to close, Xia ruofei already knew of a relatively perfect solution. He had plenty of ways to get the Dragon spaceship and the corresponding expanded cabins from Elon Musk’s company.

These things were not like spacesuits. Spacesuits and extended cabins were readily available and did not need to be ordered to be produced. Therefore, it did not seem too difficult for Xia ruofei and the other cultivators to get them from SpaceX.

Of course, if he could get a spaceship and an extended cabin through normal trade, that would naturally be a better choice.

Hence, Xia ruofei still wanted to hear the offer from Elon Musk.
