Chapter 846: Chapter 547 – growing well (2)

Translator: 549690339

After locking the door and windows, Xia ruofei immediately summoned the spirit painting scroll and entered the medium.

Although Xia ruofei had long gotten used to the rich spiritual Qi in the space, he still felt extremely comfortable the moment he entered the space. It was as if every pore in his body was cheering.

Xia ruofei had appeared in an Archean realm. Xia Qing, who was in the mountain and sea realm, immediately felt it. The moment Xia ruofei entered the spatial zone, she also appeared in the Archean realm.

“Master!” Xia Qing respectfully bowed and greeted him.

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,””Xia Qing, after the spirit map world absorbed the world stone, did it level up?”

“Master, the spirit map world has not been upgraded yet ...” Xia Qing said with her head lowered.

Xia Qing had gotten used to Xia ruofei’s words. For example, he knew that “upgrade” meant a breakthrough.

Xia ruofei was a little disappointed, but he quickly understood that after Yingying absorbed the world stone, the spirit map space had only leveled up once. Although the effects of the world stone were much better than jades, it was impossible for it to level up every time it absorbed a piece of the world stone. Wouldn’t it be like cabbages?

Xia ruofei smiled.”This is within my expectations. However, I believe that after absorbing an entire realm stone, the spirit map world should have evolved quite a bit, right?”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing quickly said.

Xia ruofei nodded and began to patrol the space. Xia Qing also followed Xia ruofei.

The spiritual Qi in the space condensed even more. Xia ruofei could clearly feel that the humidity in the air had increased by quite a bit. In some places, the spiritual Qi had started to liquify, especially in the area where the Phoebe zhennan forest was. The spiritual Qi had already formed dewdrops on the leaves.

This would undoubtedly further promote the growth of the crops in the entire space.

Xia ruofei’s eyes fell on the two plastic boxes beside the pond.

One of them was a big orange box. Xia Qing saw it and immediately said,””Master, I change the seawater four times a day and pour in the petal water of the spirit Heart Flower every once in a while. The abalones in here grow very fast!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and quickly walked over.

It had been 11 to 12 days since he had placed the 30 net abalone seedlings in orange plastic boxes and placed them in the care of Archean realm cultivators. In other words, these net abalones had actually been in this environment for nearly a year.

They had been living in an environment rich in spirit Qi for a year, and the seawater they had been living in was also the space seawater. Xia Qing had also been regularly injected with the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower. With all these factors combined, how far would these net abalone seedlings grow? Xia ruofei was also full of anticipation.

He reached the orange plastic box in a few steps. The seawater inside was very clear, and he could clearly see the small rocks and some seaweed at the bottom of the box.

When Xia ruofei saw a few abalones leisurely crawling on the reef, he couldn’t help but gasp in surprise.

When the net abalone seedlings were first bought, they were only about the size of a one – Yuan coin.

But now, among the few that Xia ruofei had seen, the smallest one was about 12 or 13 centimeters in diameter, and the biggest one was even 15 centimeters in diameter.

This was basically the size of an average three – headed or four – headed abalone that was sold on the market.

One had to know that even if the flow of time was taken into account, these abalone sprouts had only been around for less than a year! The breeding cycle of abalones was about three years.

If the time was doubled, or even less, the net abalones would undoubtedly grow to an incredible level. By then, two – headed abalones and one – headed abalones would no longer be a dream!

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. It was not because the abalones were growing fast, but because this phenomenon had proven that it was completely possible to raise abalones in a spatial environment!

Xia ruofei knew that these 30 abalones were just preliminary experiments. The real big ones were in the mountain sea realm, where there were more than 10000 abalones!

Moreover, looking at the current situation, there was no need to wait for three years. At most, in a year to a year and a half, the abalones in the mountain sea realm could be sold in batches.

“Very good!” Xia ruofei said happily,”Xia Qing, continue to take good care of these abalones. Add some spirit Heart Flower petal solution regularly and try to change the water as often as possible to ensure their living environment.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing immediately responded.

Xia ruofei had a large stock of the solution from the spirit Heart Flower petals. He could only use one or two petals to cultivate these abalones, so he was not too worried.

He was doing this to cultivate the abalones as much as he could. It wouldn’t take long for him to harvest 30 one – Head abalones.

One – headed abalones were legendary existences. Every single one of them was an incomparably precious treasure!

If Xia ruofei released the news that he was going to sell 30 one – headed abalones, the rich people in Hong Kong would probably take action immediately. It would definitely cause an uproar. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course, most people wouldn’t believe that the one – headed abalone was not as common as Chinese cabbage. One might not even appear in several years, let alone 30 one – headed abalones.

However, if Xia ruofei released the news through authoritative channels, there would surely be a large number of rich people waving their checkbooks to buy it.

After looking at the abalones, Xia ruofei took a look at the large plastic tidying box beside him. It contained the whole piece of vegetation and soil that he had transported from the caterpillar fungus – producing area in Nagqu two days ago.

Xia Qing followed Xia ruofei and introduced,””Master, these bat moth larvae have been in the Archean realm for more than two months. I followed your request and watered them with some petal water of the spirit Heart Flower. The larvae are growing very quickly. Dozens of them have already come down from the grass and burrowed into the soil.”

Xia ruofei looked through the veil. There were many bat moth larvae on the leaves. Some of them had just hatched from their eggs and were slowly crawling on the leaves.

Just as Xia ruofei was observing, a bat moth larva on the surface of the soil began to drill into the ground.

Xia ruofei knew that as long as these larvae burrowed into the loose soil, they would instinctively absorb the nutrients from the plant roots. At this time, their bodies would gradually become white and fat. At that time, the spherical spore would take the opportunity to drill into the insect’s body, absorb its nutrients, and germinate its mycelium.

The fungus’s sphere of influence was growing. The larvae that were infected by the fungus gradually wriggled to a spot two to three centimeters above the ground and died from head to tail.

Although he could not see the changes in the soil and the insides of the larvae, Xia ruofei was full of anticipation.

It would take about a year for Cordyceps sinensis to form. Xia ruofei estimated that in an environment with such rich spiritual Qi, the time needed might be even shorter.

Hence, Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”Xia Qing, in the next six to seven days, you have to pay attention and observe at all times. If there are purplish – Red grass growing in the soil, you have to report to me immediately.”

The grass had broken through the soil layer, which meant that the aweto had already taken shape and could be harvested.

Xia Qing’s knowledge of aweto was much deeper than Xia ruofei ‘S. He nodded and said,””I understand, master. I’ll keep an eye on you!”

Xia ruofei nodded and walked towards the spirit heart tree.

If the spirit map space was the foundation of Xia ruofei’s life, then the spirit heart tree was undoubtedly the key. The continuous production of spirit Heart Flower petals from the spirit heart tree had become an indispensable help to Xia ruofei’s career.

The space had absorbed an entire world stone. Although it had not completely upgraded, the spirit heart tree had grown a section as a result. Although it was still very small compared to the gold Phoebe nanmu in the distance, it was completely different from the small sapling it had been before.

Xia ruofei could not help but imagine the day when the spirit heart tree would grow into a towering tree.

His gaze quickly fell on the spirit Heart Flower that seemed to have a soul – stirring magic ...
