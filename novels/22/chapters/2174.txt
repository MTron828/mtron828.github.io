2175 Curve back to China (1)

Chapter 1203: the first Prince!

Xia ruofei checked his exact location through the satellite positioning system on the yacht and could not help but smile bitterly.

He was now in the depths of the Indian Ocean. If he wanted to return to China, he would have to make a detour around the Malacca Strait and then pass through the South China Sea. In theory, the nearest supply point was in the South China province. However, after simulating the route and calculating the fuel consumption through the main computer, he found that the 100 tons of fuel he had stored was not enough.

He did some calculations. At the most economical speed, they might not even reach the Strait of Malacca. The 100 tons of fuel would be consumed, which was less than two – thirds of the voyage.

According to the calculations of the main control computer, the current fuel could only reach the Maldives at most.

Although he could definitely replenish his supplies in the Maldives it would not be of much use! A Chinese yacht that was generally used for offshore navigation suddenly appeared in the Maldives without any entry documents. Wouldn’t it be arrested immediately?

Xia ruofei’s eyes couldn’t help but move down the map. Since it was impossible to return to the country directly, he had to think of another way.

From where he was now, the distance between the Maldives and Australia was about the same. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It seems like I can only go to Australia ... Xia ruofei laughed bitterly in his heart.

After all, they were unfamiliar with the Maldives and Australia had Tang Yitian. She believed that with Tang Yitian’s status in the Chinese society in Australia, it wouldn’t be difficult to help him settle this matter.

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei did not hesitate anymore. He quickly set the route on the main control computer and activated the autopilot system at the most economical speed. He headed in the direction of Persia.

The yacht sailed forward, cutting through the waves. Xia ruofei sat in the cockpit and pondered for a while. He took out the maritime satellite phone and connected it to the satellite. He found Tang Yitian’s phone number and dialed it.

The call was hung up after two rings. Xia ruofei was stunned when he heard the busy tone from the receiver.

He thought for a moment, then found Jennifer’s number and dialed it.

This time, it went relatively smoothly, and the call was connected very quickly.

“hello?”Jennifer’s voice came from the receiver.

Xia ruofei immediately smiled and said,”Jennifer, it’s me!” Xia ruofei!”

As soon as Xia ruofei opened his mouth, Jennifer recognized his voice. She said in surprise,””Xia! You haven’t contacted us in a long time! Is this your new number?”

Xia ruofei replied,”no, no. My phone has no signal now. This is a satellite phone number!” Jennifer, how’s Haoran doing?”

Although he wanted to find Tang Yitian as soon as possible, Tang Haoran was his disciple after all. He naturally had to care about him when the call went through.

Jennifer laughed and said,”he’s very good!” He had grown a lot taller! I’ve been following your instructions every day ... And cultivating! By the way, he misses you very much too. If he knows that you’re calling, he’ll be very happy! But he’s in school now ...”

Xia ruofei said,”it’s okay. I’ll call you again during my rest time next time. Jennifer, I’m looking for brother Tang for something, but I couldn’t get in touch with him on the phone just now. Are you with him now?”

“Isaac went to the company, maybe in a meeting!” Jennifer said,”he must have seen an unfamiliar number and hung up. Xia, I’ll contact him immediately and ask him to call you back!”

“I’ll have to trouble you then!”Xia ruofei said.

“It’s no trouble, no trouble at all ...” Jennifer said quickly.”Are we just going back to this number?”

“Yes, I am!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll keep in touch and wait for brother Tang to call me back.”

“OK!”Jennifer said,”then I’ll help you contact them right now.”

“Thank you!”

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he placed the Haishi satellite phone on the dashboard and used the phone to connect to the internet on the yacht’s WiFi.

He hadn’t gone online for a few days, so he immediately received a lot of WeChat messages.

There were messages from Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, Feng Jing asking when he would return to the company, and even from song Rui and his other friends.

After all, since he had gone out to sea, there had been no news of him except for the message he had posted on Weibo that day. Everyone was more concerned about him.

Xia ruofei’s heart was filled with warmth. He quickly replied to everyone on WeChat. He mainly said that there was no cell phone signal at sea and the Internet was intermittent, so he did not see everyone’s messages immediately. He also told everyone that he should be returning in a few days so that they did not have to worry.

He had just finished replying to WeChat when the maritime satellite phone on the driver’s seat rang.

Xia ruofei immediately reached out for it and picked it up.

“RUO Fei?” Tang Yitian’s uncertain voice came from the phone.

Xia ruofei replied,”it’s me!” Big brother Tang, were you in a meeting just now? I’m sorry for disturbing you ...”

“I’m sorry!”Tang Yitian quickly apologized. I saw that it was a number I didn’t recognize, so ...”

“I’m fine, I’m fine!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”big brother Tang, I need your help with something ...”

“Speak!” Tang Yitian said without hesitation,”your brother Xia’s matters are my matters!”

“It’s like this, I might be coming to Australia in the next few days ...”Xia ruofei said.
