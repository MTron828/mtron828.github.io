Chapter 1430: It makes sense to act cute (1)

Translator: 549690339

The topic of the peach blossom company’s annual party was on the top of the search rankings. When one clicked on the topic, it was filled with shock and envy ...

Xia ruofei couldn’t count how many times the topic of paradise Corporation had been on the hot search.

When did it become so easy to get on Weibo’s hot search? He made Weibo look like it was owned by his family. How could those big and small celebrities, who had spent a lot of money to hype it up just for the hot search, endure this?

Xia ruofei didn’t mind the free publicity.

This kind of thing, the more the better!

He happily flipped through the Weibo posts.

The one with the highest views and comments was naturally the one that was first posted, the one that reposted the entire Banyan Tree forum.

This Weibo post was also pinned at the top of the annual meeting topic page.

Everyone’s comments were naturally very enthusiastic, and netizens from all over the country expressed their opinions on the peach blossom company’s nouveau riche behavior.

Of course, it was also inevitable that it would be like the Banyan Tree forum, saying that the Paradise company was sensationalizing and hyping up the news. This topic quickly became a hot search and became the best evidence.

Xia ruofei just laughed it off.

At the very least, he didn’t create any hype. Even if he did, so what? Can’t you see how many half – famous celebrities are hyping up their own scandals and scandals every day? Even those male idols who had their own traffic could not help but create topics to maintain the popularity of their fans.

In this impetuous era, for a little bit of exposure, many people could sell their moral integrity by the ton.

Moreover, an upright person was not afraid of a crooked shadow. No matter how much these people said, the Paradise Corporation would not be affected in the slightest. On the contrary, it would gain even greater influence.

However, when Xia ruofei saw a comment, he could not help but be stunned.

This comment wrote,[many netizens said that the person in the money – making picture is the boss of paradise Corporation. Should I say that the boss is very friendly and gets along with his employees?] Or should he be said to be fighting for benefits with the people? This award is not a small one, right? The least one was more than 20000 Yuan! How could he, a boss, take up the spot to win the prize?

Xia ruofei didn’t expect to be criticized for this.

However, Xia ruofei was in a good mood today, so he was not angry. Instead, he had a strange thought and used his Weibo account to reply to the comment.

He wrote,”the boss is also one of the employees!” What could he do if he just happened to be drawn? The boss said,”baby’s heart is bitter!”

This comment wasn’t eye – catching and didn’t attract much attention in the beginning.

After all, Xia ruofei’s popularity on the internet was not as high as Feng Jing ‘S. Feng Jing had the advantage of being young, beautiful, and gender. Last time, her exposure was much higher than Xia ruofei’ s. It could be said that if Feng Jing wanted to debut in the entertainment industry now, many management companies would be willing to extend an olive branch.

Xia ruofei was just joking. However, he had forgotten that Qin Zhuan company had once applied for a mass verification of their employees ‘private Weibo accounts. As the company’s number one, he naturally had someone to help him with it. Therefore, his Weibo account was now verified as “Chairman of paradise Corporation.”

Any trace on the internet would be discovered by people. After all, the population base was too large.

Very quickly, someone realized that the owner of this reply was actually the person in question.

In an instant, the topic of the peach blossom company’s Annual Meeting immediately soared to an order of magnitude, firmly entering the top eight most searched topics.

“Catch a wild Chairman alive!”

“What a cute shop owner!”

“Boss Xia, is your company still short of people?”

[I’ve suddenly become a fan after seeing boss Xia’s reply!]

“Passerby fan +1”

“Black turn!”

......

After Xia ruofei replied to the Weibo comment, he threw his phone aside and went to take a shower.

When he came out of the shower, he habitually swiped on his phone screen to take a look at Weibo. He was suddenly shocked by the red corner sign at the bottom. In a short while, there were thousands of new notifications.

What was going on?

Xia ruofei opened the messages in fear and realized that most of them were notifications from new fans. In such a short time, he had gained more than 3000 fans.

Originally, he didn’t post much on Weibo, and he had very few fans. Most of them were followed by his company’s employees.

It could be said that even his friends didn’t pay much attention to his Weibo. After all, he rarely posted anything.

Originally, an alternate account with a total of two to three hundred fans had gained more than three thousand fans in a short ten minutes. Even if one spent money to buy hardcore fans, it would not be so fast!

And the red corner sign was still constantly popping up, with new fans following it every second.

The other messages were about his account being tagged.

Xia ruofei opened it and realized that most of the comments were replies to his previous comment.

He couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. How did his identity get exposed so quickly?

When he saw the certification mark on his Weibo account, he came back to his senses and suddenly felt like he had been F * cked.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel lucky that he didn’t pretend to be a righteous passer – by and spoke up for justice. The tone of the comment was basically the boss’s own tone. Otherwise, it would really become a big joke.

Looking at everyone’s comments, he was also very happy.

The popular phrase “the baby’s heart is bitter” had an inexplicable sense of humor here. Many people became fans because of this sentence.

Of course, this was also due to his status as a rich boss.

If a loser acted cute and said this on the internet, everyone would probably ignore it. However, it felt completely different when a rich boss who spent millions at an Annual Meeting and gave a year – end bonus of ten to twenty million said this. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
