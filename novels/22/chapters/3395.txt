Chapter 3396: A difficult mission (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei raised his head and shouted,”Qingxue, down!”

Ling Qingxue also squatted down and grabbed the rope with one hand. Then, with a flip of her body, her movements were very elegant as she arrived at the edge of the cliff.

To do such a move without any protection, it would be very dangerous for ordinary people. However, to cultivators, it was not difficult at all.

As the situation below was unclear, Xia ruofei carefully released the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword, one on the left and one on the right, keeping a lookout.

This was also one of the reasons why Xia ruofei didn’t choose to use the flying sword. This way, the flying sword could be used as a warning. After all, in the trial Pagoda, the flying sword of the bent frost was the most suitable for him.

The qushuang flying sword was right beside Xia ruofei’s feet. If there was an emergency, Xia ruofei could jump on the flying sword at any time and use sword Kinesis to avoid danger.

“Let’s go down slowly!” Xia ruofei raised his head and said.

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue replied loudly.

The two of them held the rope with both hands and supported their legs on the cliff wall. They alternated their hands and their bodies descended bit by bit.

From a distance, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked like two ants in the background of the huge cliff. They were slowly climbing down the cliff. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After the height was lowered by a few dozen meters, the angle of the cliff was no longer so steep. At least, it would not maintain a 90 – degree angle all the time. It was relatively gentler. This way, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s legs were more durable, and the speed of their descent increased.

Just like that, the two of them used about twenty minutes to descend about two hundred meters.

“Qingxue, stop and take a rest!” Xia ruofei raised his head and shouted.

“I’m not tired!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

Indeed, for cultivators, this kind of seemingly dangerous rock climbing activity didn’t consume much physical strength. Even the delicate Ling Qingxue didn’t sweat much, so naturally, she wasn’t tired.

Xia ruofei said,”the misty area is right below us. I’m afraid that there might be some unknown danger. Let’s rest for a while and adjust our state of mind. Then, I’ll go in first to explore the way!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and said,””Oh! Then I’ll listen to you!”

Xia ruofei nodded and took out the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword. He slashed at the cliff.

Suddenly, stone fragments flew, and after a while, a small platform that could barely accommodate two people was excavated.

“Come down and take a rest!” Xia ruofei jumped onto the platform and said with a smile.

Ling Qingxue nodded and swung down. Xia ruofei reached out and hugged her. Then, they turned around and retreated back to the small platform.

After Xia ruofei helped Ling Qingxue sit down, he smiled and asked,'”‘You’re really not tired?”

“I’m not tired!” Ling Qingxue said,”ruofei, actually, we don’t need to rest. Just climbing the mountain took almost half an hour. The mission time is very tight.”

Xia ruofei furrowed his brows.”I know we’re short on time, but we can’t be reckless. It’s covered in clouds and we don’t know what’s going on down there. It’s better to be careful!”

“And …” Xia ruofei said,”I keep feeling that something is wrong! It’s too quiet here, so quiet that it’s a little strange…”

Ling Qingxue shrunk her neck and said,'”‘It’s a little scary…”

“Also, I feel that the rope is obviously lighter!” Xia ruofei said with a serious expression.

“What?” Ling Qingxue didn’t know how to react.

Xia ruofei reached out and pulled the rope upwards. He felt that it was very light. Indeed, he had only pulled for ten to twenty meters before he reached the end.

Xia ruofei showed the broken end of the rope to Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue took a closer look, and her expression became very serious.”It seems to be corroded…”

“If I’m not wrong, there’s something wrong with the clouds!” Xia ruofei said in a deep voice.

“En!” Ling Qingxue also came to her senses.”From the remaining length of the rope, the remaining part is above the cloud Mist. Basically, it broke as soon as we entered the cloud Mist area…”

“Or maybe it’s been corroded to the point that nothing is left…” Xia ruofei said.

“Ah?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but look worried.”Then how are we going to get down?” If we can’t go down, how are we going to find the goldthread nether snake?”

“There’s no hurry. We still need to confirm it first!”Xia ruofei said calmly.

With that, Xia ruofei took out a Stainless Steel Tube and a PvP tube from the spirit map space. Then, he used his spiritual power to lift them and slowly lowered them down the cliff.

The platform that Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were resting on was a dozen meters away from the misty area. Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to grab the two tubes and arrived at the misty area.

Xia ruofei was even more careful. He slowly inserted the two tubes into the fog and immediately lifted them up again.

At this time, the part of the pipe that had entered the cloud and mist had completely disappeared.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other in shock.

The corrosive nature of the cloud Mist had already exceeded their expectations. It had only been one or two seconds since the tube had entered the cloud area, but as long as it had entered the cloud area, it had been corroded completely without leaving anything behind.

Xia ruofei picked up the two tubes and noticed that the fracture was uneven and there were obvious signs of corrosion.

“This …” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but reveal a look of fear.

Xia ruofei’s expression was also very ugly. He took out different materials from the spirit map space and tried them out.

They discovered that the cloud not only corroded items at a fast speed, but it could also corrode almost all materials. The only difference was the speed.

Xia ruofei even tried to use glassware to test it and found that it would still be corroded by the fog.

There were many living people in the Xuanji spirit map space, but Xia ruofei was not a brutal person. There was no need to test it out. There was a high chance that even a human’s bones would not be left if he were to throw them in. Why should he kill more?

Ling Qingxue felt a sense of powerlessness. In such an environment, how was she supposed to enter the misty area? If he couldn’t even see the goldthread nether snake, how was he going to complete the mission?

Xia ruofei’s brain was working quickly. He said,””There’s one more thing I haven’t tried…”

Ling Qingxue also thought of it immediately. She hesitated for a moment before saying, “”You mean… An EVA suit?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” The spacesuits are designed to deal with the harsh space environment, so they’re definitely much more resistant to corrosion than normal materials!”

“But that’s too dangerous …” Ling Qingxue said.”Although we all have a backup set, if it’s damaged, the return trip …”

“Actually, the journey back to Earth from the moon is relatively safe. We didn’t use a spare spacesuit on the way here, did we?” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll take out a set and try it on! It’s decided …”

Seeing that Xia ruofei had already made up his mind and that they could not afford to waste any more time, Ling Qingxue reluctantly nodded and said,””Alright! It’s good to try…”

Xia ruofei took out the spacesuit that he had used on the way here. He used his spiritual power to grab the spacesuit and slowly sent it down.

Ling Qingxue nervously stuck her head out and stared at the slowly descending spacesuit.

Xia ruofei was fully focused. Very quickly, the spacesuit descended to about half a meter above the cloud. Then, Xia ruofei made up his mind and sent the lower half of the spacesuit into the cloud. After a few seconds, he grabbed it.

At first glance, the two of them saw that the spacesuits were still intact, and they couldn’t help but feel happy.

Soon, the spacesuit was retrieved by Xia ruofei and placed on the temporary platform. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue quickly went over to check.

There were obvious signs of corrosion on the lower half of the spacesuit, but it was still relatively intact. Xia ruofei connected the power source to test the air seal of the spacesuit and found that it was still fine. There were no obvious damages. Although the surface was corroded, it did not penetrate the spacesuit..
