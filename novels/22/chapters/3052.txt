3053 Breakthrough together (1)

When the wild tea entered her stomach, Ling Qingxue subconsciously wanted to praise the tea. However, before she could open her mouth, her body suddenly stiffened, as if she had fallen into a state of shock.

Xia ruofei, who was already prepared, pulled Ling Qingxue and leaped into the time array flag’s range. Then, they immediately entered a state of cultivation.

When Song Wei saw Ling Qingxue’s expression, she suddenly felt like laughing. However, she immediately realized that she would be drinking this magical tea very soon. Would she be like Ling Qingxue later?

Song Wei didn’t have much time to think about this problem because the time inside and outside the time array flag was very different. Even if she used the time array flag alone, the range of effect of the array was smaller, so the time flow difference was about 90 times.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue came out after three to four hours of cultivation.

To Song Wei, who was outside the array, only two to three minutes had passed.

Ling Qingxue’s face was still a little red when she left the formation. On one hand, it was the “side effect” of cultivating the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” together. On the other hand, it was also caused by your excitement.

When she saw Song Wei, the blush on her face deepened.

This was because when they were cultivating the “absolute beginning Scripture” together, in that kind of alluring and charming environment, although it was the spirit bodies that were entangled with each other, in fact, the body would also have the same reaction.

She could not help but feel embarrassed when she thought of how Song Wei had seen her embarrassing look. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ling Qingxue was overthinking things. The time inside and outside the formation was too different. Song Wei couldn’t see the change in Ling Qingxue’s expression from the outside.

Very quickly, Ling Qingxue’s mood was filled with excitement again. She excitedly pulled on Song Wei’s hand and said,””Wei Wei, quickly drink this cup of tea! Do you know? In such a short time, my cultivation level has increased by one level, and now I’m already refined Qi Level 5! And after breaking through, it can’t be stopped at all, and my cultivation level is still rising. I feel that I will be able to break through to refined Qi Level 6 very soon!”

Song Wei’s eyes widened in shock.”Just a cup of tea ... Can actually achieve such an effect?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’ll know if it’s effective or not after you try it!” Wei Wei, it’s your turn, drink up!”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,””Yeah, yeah! Eldest brother, it’s time to drink your medicine ...”

Song Wei burst out laughing at this sudden nonsense. She had already reached for the teacup, but her hand trembled and almost spilled the tea.

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry as he looked at Ling Qingxue and said,”Qingxue, even if you’re joking, you should look at the occasion ... Only the first dish of wild tea is effective. If I spilled the tea just now, where am I going to find more wild tea?”

Ling Qingxue was shocked too. She did not dare to look at Xia ruofei and Song Wei. She stuck out her tongue and said,””I didn’t do it on purpose. My brain just twitched, and I suddenly said that I’m fine ...”

She patted her chest as she spoke. Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat when he saw her trembling figure. He did not want to reprimand Ling Qingxue at first, but now he could not bring himself to do so.

“Qingxue definitely didn’t do it on purpose. It’s a good thing she’s fine!” Song Wei added.

Then, Song Wei quickly changed the topic and asked,””Ruofei, then I’ll just drink it?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”drink!”

With Ling Qingxue as an example, Song Wei wasn’t as nervous as before. She drank the tea in one gulp.

Her reaction was similar to Ling Qingxue ‘s. Even though she was mentally prepared, after the tea entered her stomach, she still couldn’t help but fall into a state of cultivation.

Xia ruofei pulled Song Wei into the array and sat down cross – legged to start their cultivation.

Ling Qingxue had also involuntarily entered a state of cultivation, so she didn’t know what had happened after she drank the wild tea. Now, she was naturally very curious.

However, she still knew her limits and did not dare to enter the array to disturb the two of them.

She was just outside the range of the time array flag, looking into the array.

However, due to the difference in the flow of time between the inside and outside, what she saw inside the array was like a video played at 90x fast – forward speed. Everything she saw was blurry. After all, even though they were in a state of cultivation, the two of them were not completely still. Some of the subtle movements in the time dimension for a few hours were condensed into a short two to three minutes, so it was naturally very blurry to see from the outside.

Ling Qingxue felt a little dizzy and gave up.

She had just sat down to rest for less than two minutes when Song Wei walked out of the array feeling refreshed.

“Wei Wei, how is it? Have you broken through?” Ling Qingxue immediately stood up to welcome him.

Song Wei nodded happily and said,”My situation is similar to yours. I think I can break through to refined Qi Level 6 at any time!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ll choose a suitable cultivation technique for you. This way, even if I’m not by your side, it won’t affect your cultivation.”

“En!” Ling Qingxue said,”pick a good cultivation technique! I really want to break through to the Golden core stage now! He was riding a flying sword! Just thinking about it makes me excited!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”It’s not necessarily the best. But it has to be the most suitable for the two of you!”
