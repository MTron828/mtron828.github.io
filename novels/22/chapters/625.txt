Chapter 626: Temporary healer (2)

Feng Rao wiped her sweat and smiled.””You’re welcome, it’s ... A small matter!”

No matter how he heard this, it was against his heart. He had raised his hand a thousand times, but he was not even tired from giving Huanhuan a bath!

“Um ... CEO Feng, did you sleep with your little friend?” Xia ruofei asked again.

“No, I didn ‘t! I’ve never brought it!” Feng Jing jumped up as if she had seen a snake or Scorpion.”Chairman, I really can’t help you!”

Feng Rao was sitting on the toilet lid and putting on her socks. After saying that, she took a sock that she had not had time to put on. She had a sock on one foot and no sock on the other. She did not even pull up the upper of her shoe and fled, leaving Xia ruofei alone in a mess ... L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He had no choice. Feng Jing could run, but Xia ruofei could not!

He could only pray that nothing else would happen to Huanhuan in the coming days ...

Xia ruofei prayed to the gods and prayed for their blessings in his heart as he walked out of the bathroom with a death – defying expression.

Huan Huan was watching one piece with great interest in front of her computer. She wondered how such a young child could be so familiar with operating a computer and even find the cartoon she wanted to watch.

“Huanhuan, don’t look at it for too long!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s getting late. I’m going to bed!”

“I know, big brother ruofei!” Huan Huan turned around and smiled sweetly.”Can I look at it for another ten minutes? This episode is ending soon!”

Huan Huan’s angelic and pure smile made Xia ruofei unable to reject her. He nodded and said,””Okay, you have to promise me that you’ll turn off your computer and go to sleep after this episode!”

“Alright!”

......

Soon, after the first episode was over, Huan Huan took the initiative to turn off the player on the computer. Xia ruofei was surprised.

Xia ruofei carried Huanhuan to the bed and tucked her in. He carefully covered her with the blanket and said,””Huanhuan, be good and go to sleep!”

With that, Xia ruofei reached out to turn off the lights in the room. He left a dim night light on to create a warm sleeping environment.

The room was very quiet, and the breathing of the two could be clearly heard.

Xia ruofei was also leaning against the bed with his clothes on. He was prepared to take a shower after Huanhuan fell asleep.

After a while, Xia ruofei turned his head to look.

His eyesight was very good. Although the environment was dark, he could still clearly see that Huanhuan was lying on the bed obediently, but her eyes were wide open, and she did not feel sleepy at all.

“Huanhuan, why aren’t you sleeping?” Xia ruofei asked softly.

“Big brother ruofei, I want to hear a story ...” Huanhuan turned her head and said,”at home, my mother has to tell me stories so that I can fall asleep ...”

Xia ruofei’s face darkened and he started to search his mind.

For the first time in his life, he tried to tell a bedtime story to a child.”In a distant country, there lived a King and a Queen. They longed to have a child ...”

“This is Snow White and the Seven Dwarves!” Huan Huan said,”brother ruofei, I’ve heard it eight times ...”

“Dorothy, Uncle Henry, and aunt AMU live in the middle of the great Kansas prairies ...” Xia ruofei changed his answer awkwardly.

“The Wizard of Oz ...” Huanhuan looked at Xia ruofei with disdain.”I can almost memorize it!”

Hey! This little girl was quite hard to please!

If you force me, I’ll give you a few stories from liaozhai. Are you afraid?

However, Xia ruofei could only think about it. He did not want to scare the little girl so much that she would not be able to sleep anymore and would even have nightmares and scream at night ...

Hence, Xia ruofei continued to search through her distant childhood memories and tried the beginning of a few classic fairy tales. Huanhuan had a look of disgust on her face as she said that she had heard of them.

In the end, when Xia ruofei tried out the king of fairytales ‘work, Huanhuan did not say anything and listened carefully.

Xia ruofei was telling Huan Huan the story “the adventures of Schuck beta,” which was a classic work of Zheng Yuanjie. Perhaps it was because it was not very popular in Hong Kong, but Huan Huan had never heard of it.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief. This was one of the fairy tales that left the deepest impression on him when he was a child. He was familiar with the classic content. Back then, the two little mice that flew a helicopter and a tank were really popular all over the country! Any kid who didn’t know Schuck and betta would be despised.

Hence, Xia ruofei deliberately slowed down and lowered his voice to tell the story.

In the beginning, Huanhuan was still very energetic and very interested in the content of the story. She even asked a lot of questions from a child’s point of view from time to time.

However, a child was still a child. Soon, she felt sleepy and slowly closed her eyes. Her breathing also became slow and even.

Xia ruofei did not realize that Huanhuan was asleep. He was still leaning against the headboard with his eyes slightly closed as he told the story in a slow tone.

His voice was getting lower and lower, and the speed of his speech was getting slower and slower. Unconsciously, he felt his eyelids getting heavier and heavier, and finally, he fell asleep while leaning against the bed.

After an unknown period of time, Xia ruofei lost his balance in his sleep and tilted to the side. He then woke up.

Xia ruofei turned his head and saw that Huanhuan was already sound asleep. He carefully took out his phone to check the time. Suddenly, he laughed bitterly. It was already one in the morning!
