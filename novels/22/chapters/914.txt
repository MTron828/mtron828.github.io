Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian also quickly walked over.

After little Haoran woke up, he called out weakly,””Father, mother ...”

“Woof! Baby, how are you?” Jennifer asked as she held little Haoran tightly.

Little Haoran said,”I felt so hot just now!” It felt like I was in a stove, and then I can’t remember ... Mom, will I die?”

Jennifer’s tears flowed down at once and she quickly said,””No, no... With Mr. Xia here, you’ll be fine ...”

“Haoran, come and thank Mr. Xia!” Tang Yitian said hurriedly. It was Mr. Xia who saved you!”

Little Haoran looked at Xia ruofei in Jennifer’s arms and said sensibly,””Thank you, brother!”

“Haoran, you should call him Mr. Xia!” Tang Yitian corrected him.

When they met at the airport, little Haoran called Xia ruofei “brother” and “sister”. In fact, it was more intimate. Besides, Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao were both very young, so Tang Yitian and the others would never correct them.

But now, it was different. Tang Yitian knew that Xia ruofei was an extraordinary person, and his life experience had taught him a lot of things that ordinary people didn’t understand. He knew that such an extraordinary person must be treated with respect.

Otherwise, even though he was all – Powerful in Australia and had wealth comparable to a country, people would still not care about a rich man like him.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.””It’s okay. It’s nice to call me brother. It’s kind and makes me look younger ...”

“This ...” Tang Yitian was in a difficult position.

Jennifer was a Westerner, so she did not have a strong sense of Chinese etiquette and seniority. She also said with a smile,””Isaac, since Xia said so, then let Allan call him brother! Alan has such a capable brother, no one will dare to bully him in the future!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Little Haoran has such excellent parents. Who would dare to bully him?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Little Haoran was still a child, so he didn’t understand the adults ‘jokes. He just looked at them with a blank face.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Haoran, come here. I’ll examine you again.”

Jennifer quickly put little Haoran down and then patted him on the shoulder.

They had known each other at the airport. Besides, Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao were very approachable, so little Haoran was not shy and obediently walked to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei carried little Haoran to his lap and reached out to feel his pulse.

Although Xia ruofei had used up a lot of his spiritual energy, it was not a problem for him to just check it out.

His mental energy seeped into little Haoran’s pulse and started to flow through his meridians.

Xia ruofei realized that after a quarter of the pure Yang Qi in his body had been absorbed, the blocked meridians in little Haoran’s body had greatly improved. There was still a large amount of pure Yang Qi in his body, but it would not cause his meridians to be completely blocked.

In other words, the qi and blood in little Haoran’s body could already be barely circulated, so those terrifying symptoms gradually subsided, and he also woke up.

After Xia ruofei checked, he raised his head and said,””It’s not a big problem for the time being. After the plane lands, I’ll go to your house to unblock little Haoran’s meridians again. Then, I’ll do it one last time before I return to China. This hidden danger should be completely solved.”

Tang Yitian was overjoyed and thanked Jennifer repeatedly.

Little Haoran was still a little dispirited and it was getting late. It was almost Teno’ clock in the evening when the plane took off, so after everyone chatted for a while, Jennifer brought him to the other side of the seat to rest.

Tang Yitian still wanted to chat with Xia ruofei for a while, so Lin Qiao gave up her seat obediently and went to the other side where Jennifer was.

Jennifer was carrying little Haoran. There was an empty seat on the other side. Lin Qiao finally had the opportunity to get close to her idol, so she sat there and chatted with Jennifer.

Jennifer was very friendly and did not put on any airs. In addition, Lin Qiao’s brother, Xia ruofei, was now little Haoran’s Savior, so Jennifer was naturally very friendly to Lin Qiao and the two of them had a very warm conversation.

On the other side, Tang Yitian and Xia ruofei were still talking about the charity fund.

Tang Yitian was still inclined to establish a “Xia ruofei Foundation,” but Xia ruofei was firmly opposed to it.

Ten million US dollars was definitely not a small charity fund. If it really had such a name, he could forget about keeping a low profile.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Mr. Tang, I appreciate your good intentions, but I think it’s better for us to each take half a step back. This new fund will be named after my company!”

“Oh? Mr. Xia has his own company? What industry is it?” Tang Yitian was a successful businessman, so he asked with great interest.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I can’t compare to your business empire. I’m just a small fry.” My company is mainly engaged in the production and sales of high – end agricultural products, including vegetables, fruits, meat, and some high – Quality Chinese medicine. ”

“Paradise Corporation? That’s a good name!” Tang Yitian exclaimed in admiration,”then let’s call this Charity Foundation ‘paradise Foundation’! In addition ... My company’s main business is in the retail industry, so I think we should have many opportunities to cooperate in the future. ”
