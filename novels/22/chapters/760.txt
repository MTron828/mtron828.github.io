Chapter 761: Return if there’s a battle summon (3)

“Of course, if there’s a battle, I’ll definitely return!” Guo Zhan said without hesitation.

This was the oath that every veteran would make when they left the military camp they loved. They would not fall behind when they left the Army, and their colors would not fade when they left the Army. If their motherland needed them, as long as they were summoned, they would not hesitate to put on their clothes and set foot on the battlefield without hesitation!

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”yes!” If there was a battle, he would return! Now, I solemnly request to the organization to recall me back to lone wolf until the completion of this mission!”

Guo Zhan was finally moved. He looked deeply at Xia ruofei and asked,””Little Xia, Are you sure? I can tell you clearly that this mission is extremely dangerous, and your life could be in danger at any time!”

Guo Zhan changed his usual way of addressing Xia ruofei. He called him “little Xia” to remind him that he was now an ordinary person and there was no need to put himself in such a dangerous situation.

Xia ruofei puffed out his chest without thinking and said,””Wolf King, I will always be the blood Wolf of the lone wolf assault team! The organization can conduct a strict review of my past year’s experience, and they can also conduct a professional assessment of me. I will prove that I have the ability to participate in this mission!”

Guo Zhan fell into deep thought. After a long while, he raised his head. His eyes were very bright in the night. He patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder heavily and said,””Brother! Welcome back to the team!”

Xia ruofei suddenly raised his head and looked at Guo Zhan. He asked excitedly,””You agree?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I can’t think of a reason to refuse,” Guo Zhan nodded. However, according to the rules, I have to report this kind of temporary recall to the higher – ups for approval, and also go through the relevant procedures. Of course, special circumstances should be handled in an emergency, so there should be a result soon. ”

Xia ruofei nodded heavily and clenched his fists.

The death of the squad leader, old Luo, had deeply stimulated Xia ruofei. His heart was filled with the flames of revenge. If not for this, Xia ruofei would not have been so insistent on returning to the team to participate in this mission.

The only obsession in his mind right now was to avenge the death of class monitor old Luo.

That night, Xia ruofei did not go back. He stayed in the hospital for the whole night. Guo Zhan booked a room on the sixth floor, and the two of them shared a bed each.

......

Guo Zhan used his secret phone to make many calls that night, urgently coordinating the recall of Xia ruofei.

The next morning, Niu Tao rushed to the hospital and handed a thin one – Page document to Guo Zhan.

After Guo Zhan took a glance, a smile finally appeared on his cold face. He extended his hand to Xia ruofei and said,””Blood Wolf, I can finally say this to you with certainty. Welcome back!”

After shaking hands with Xia ruofei, Guo Zhan handed the document to him.

Xia ruofei took it and saw the words “” on it.

Paradise Corporation:

Your company’s employee, Xia ruofei, was originally a corporal of a certain Department in the southeast war zone. According to the relevant provisions of the “National Defense Law” and the military notice, he is now ordered to return to the Army to carry out his mission. It is a sacred duty given by the National law to perform National Defense duties according to the law. No unit or individual is allowed to obstruct him. We hope that your company will support and cooperate.

At the end, it was signed off as “Southeast province military.”

Xia ruofei also smiled. He folded the document carefully and put it in his bag.

Paradise company was his own company, so he naturally didn’t need to take this document back to apply for leave.

He only needed to make a call back to the company’s management to let them know. Of course, he also needed to find another reason to let his girlfriend, Ling Qingxue, Hu Zi’s mother, and Lin Qiao know so that they wouldn’t worry.

However, from a legal point of view, this document confirmed the fact that Xia ruofei had been recalled back to his original unit to perform a mission, making Xia ruofei’s participation in this mission legally legitimate.

Xia ruofei looked at Guo Zhan and said,””Wolf King, can you tell me now?”

“You guys continue, I’ll go find out more about flamy’s situation!” Niu Tao said.

He immediately left the room and closed the door from the outside.

After Niu Tao left, Guo Zhan finally opened his mouth,”Blood Wolf, this mission started two months ago ...” He said.
