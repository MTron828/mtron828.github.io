During this period, the company’s business had basically stopped. Xia ruofei had always been a hands – off manager, so he had been very free these few days.

Today, he had taken advantage of Ling Qingxue’s free time to ask her out to go shopping.

After the two of them got together, they didn’t see each other much even though they were in the same city.

It was mainly because Ling Qingxue had been too busy with work. Ling Xiaotian was gradually passing the power of the company to Ling Qingxue. Every time Xia ruofei saw Ling Qingxue’s Haggard look, he would feel his heart ache. He could not help but blame his future father – in – Law.

Today, Ling Qingxue was wearing a red woolen coat, a light yellow high – collared cashmere sweater, and a red scarf. It was very appropriate for the occasion as the Spring Festival was approaching.

She held Xia ruofei’s arm and pressed her body against Xia ruofei ‘s. Her face was also filled with a happy smile.

The two of them were walking in the Wanda Mall. They had just finished watching a New Year film and were about to come out to look for food.

There was also a Ling’s restaurant chain near Wanda Mall, but Ling Qingxue did not want to take care of her own business. Instead, she was interested in walking around with Xia ruofei, looking for a restaurant with special characteristics.

After all, they were in their own store and the employees all knew her. It would be a little uncomfortable for them to hold hands.

As Xia ruofei walked, he said with an apologetic expression,””Qingxue, I’ll still have to eat with Godma and Qiao’ er for the New Year’s Eve dinner this year ...”

“It doesn’t matter! I understand!” Ling Qingxue smiled sweetly and said,”you should just keep them company! Don’t forget to come home on the second day of the first lunar month! Don’t let my dad pick a fight!”

In the three mountains, the second day of the first lunar month was the day when the daughter returned to her Maiden Home. Although Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were not married yet, their relationship had already been acknowledged by Ling Xiaotian. Therefore, it was only proper for them to visit on the second day of the first lunar month.

“That’s for sure,” Xia ruofei gently hugged Ling Qingxue and said,”it’s mainly because it’s the new year. I’m afraid that the mother and daughter will be alone. It’s inevitable that I’ll think of Hu and feel sad. Furthermore, they’re spending the new year at their new home this year. I’m sure ...”

“You fool! You don’t need to explain!” Ling Qingxue said,”if it wasn’t for the fact that I don’t want to leave my dad alone at home, I would have wanted to spend the new year with you and them ...”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.””Why don’t we ... Ask uncle Ling to come with us? you can all spend the new year at godmother’s place?”

“This ... Isn’t convenient, is it?” Ling Qingxue was a little hesitant.

“It’s not inconvenient at all! It’s more lively with more people!” Xia ruofei said,”you’re so close to godmother Qiao’ er and uncle Ling. He’s not a loner. We’re all family!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but feel a little moved when she heard this. She said,””I’ll go back and ask my dad ...”

“He’ll definitely agree!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“That’s not for sure,” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.”Wait for my news!”

For so many years, Ling Xiaotian had always spent the new year with Ling Qingxue. Although his disciples had also wanted to invite him to celebrate the new year together, Ling Xiaotian had never agreed.

Therefore, Ling Qingxue was not sure if Ling Xiaotian would agree to Xia ruofei’s suggestion.

The two of them talked as they walked forward. Ling Qingxue saw a stone pot grilled fish shop nearby, and her eyes lit up.”Ruofei, I suddenly feel like eating grilled fish! How about this one!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” As long as you’re not afraid of getting pimples from the heat!”

“With your unlimited supply of jaded skin cream, it’s so hard to get pimples!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

“I like to hear that!” Xia ruofei grinned and said,”let’s go! Let’s go eat grilled fish!”

The two of them walked into the shop.

Although it was already lunch time in the bustling Wanda Mall, there were not many customers in the store.

It wasn’t that the food in this restaurant didn’t taste good. This grilled fish restaurant was quite famous in San Shan. The chain store had six or seven restaurants, mainly because it was close to the end of the year, and many people had left the city to return to their homes.

In fact, the bigger the city, the more deserted it would be during the spring Festival. International metropolises like Beijing and Shen Cheng would almost become empty during the spring Festival.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue didn’t like noisy environments either. This kind of situation was exactly what they wanted.

The two of them randomly found a table by the glass window and sat down. Soon, a waiter came over with the menu.

Ling Qingxue excitedly ordered a large serving of the restaurant’s signature grilled fish, then ordered a few stir – fried dishes and two glasses of fruit juice.

The waiter placed a hourglass at the corner of the table and said,””Please wait a moment. Our grilled fish is freshly made, so it will take some time. If the hourglass is completely filled and the dishes have not started to be served, we will exempt you from the cost of the main course. ”

After the waiter left, Xia ruofei smiled at Ling Qingxue and said,””This is interesting! With this hourglass, everyone’s waiting time won’t be so boring. Sometimes, they even hope that the dishes will be served later!”

“I think this idea is pretty good!” Ling Qingxue said,”I’ll talk to the marketing department later. Our Ling Ji F & B can also use this trick!”

In fact, Ling Ji F & B already had a lot of experience in kitchen resource management. When cooking, they also used the overall planning method to the extreme. Basically, there would not be a situation where one table of customers kept waiting for food to be served while the other table kept on serving food. It was a very hateful phenomenon.
