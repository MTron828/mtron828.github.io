Ling Xiaotian was also very interested after hearing this and said,””That’s a good suggestion! If we exchange our shares, our cooperative relationship will be more solid, but ...”

“Uncle Ling, don’t worry! The stock exchange is only for the Ling’s private kitchen branch in Beijing!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”in our initial plan, I have 28.33% of the club’s shares, which is one of the two largest shareholders! Therefore, this cooperation will definitely not be a mess. It will be beneficial to both sides!”

“Then I’m relieved!” Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,”ruofei, when do you think your friends are free these few days? invite them to the company. Let’s sit down and have a talk!”

“Alright! However, they’re mainly here for a vacation, and this conference was a sudden idea. Many of the ideas are not mature enough, so everyone can only discuss one thing at most. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as for the details, we’ll have to wait for them to return to the capital and make an evaluation before we can decide.”

“That’s for sure,” Ling Xiaotian was very understanding.”However, since everyone wants to cooperate, it’s not a bad idea to get in touch with each other in advance!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei replied readily,”uncle Ling, let’s make an appointment later on for the exact time!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Good, good, good! Then go entertain your friends first!” Ling Xiaotian seemed to be in a good mood.

However, before he hung up, Ling Xiaotian remembered something and quickly said,””Oh right, ruofei, wait a moment. I have something to tell you!”

“Uncle Ling, what’s the matter?” Xia ruofei asked.

“It’s about our Dingfeng winery!” Ling Xiaotian said,”isn’t it almost the end of the year? The winery’s profit this year is quite good, so we’ll split the bonus at the end of the year. A few days ago, I asked the finance department to do a detailed calculation. In addition to the necessary development funds, you can get about 50 million in dividends ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and said in surprise,””So much money?”

Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,”the winery’s gross profit every month is about 21 million Yuan. After deducting the tax, management, and financial costs, it’s about 17 million Yuan. This is basically the net profit. The profit we’ve made in the past six months has already exceeded 100 million Yuan.”

The main reason why they could achieve such good sales was because of the good products.

The old Dingfeng winery was an old brand, and it was even a memory of old San, but the winery had never been dead.

After Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian took over, other than investing a certain amount of money to upgrade and transform the equipment, they did not actually spend much on the cost. The raw materials were basically the same as before. In fact, because the equipment was more advanced, they even saved a lot on labor costs.

Under the situation where the cost remained the same, the selling price of the product had increased significantly. Furthermore, the sales volume had increased by several times compared to the past. As the spirit map space’s range was limited to the primal realm, it was impossible to increase the production volume limitlessly. This also led to the Ding Feng winery’s Drunken Eight Immortals liquor being in a state of supply falling short of demand.

Moreover, as its reputation grew, the prices of Drunken Eight Immortals were relatively more affordable compared to the intimidating prices of the top – tier white wine brands, and the taste was not inferior to them at all. In fact, the taste of may and 1 – Year aged white wines was even better than that of old Maotai. Naturally, more and more people liked the wine of Drunken Eight Immortals.

Therefore, Ding Feng winery didn’t have to worry about sales. The existence of the sales department was very weak, because this was a seller’s market.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Ling, do you need to leave more development funds?” 100 million of profit was taken away all of a sudden, there shouldn’t be any problems with the winery’s capital chain, right?”

He and Ling Xiaotian each had 50% of the shares. If he took 50 million in dividends, he would think that Ling Xiaotian had also taken 50 million in dividends, which would add up to 100 million.

“That’s enough!”Ling Xiaotian said. We still have at least 30 million Yuan in our account. Due to the booming sales of Drunken Eight Immortals, the distributors have taken the initiative to shorten the accounting period. Some of them even used cash to transfer the goods in order to get a bigger share. Our raw material suppliers are all old customers, so there will not be a bank run. The winery’s capital chain is very healthy! Also ... Even if there’s a small problem with the capital chain, I can easily transfer some money from the Ling Ji F & B group to solve the problem. Besides, I still have you, don’t I?”

At this point, Ling Xiaotian said with some regret,””The reason why we’re taking out so much money to split the dividends is mainly because the winery’s production capacity is already full, and we can’t further expand the production. There’s no point in leaving too much money on the books, right?”

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed. He was the main cause of this problem. However, the spirit map space was only so big. A hundred tons of wine a month already took up a lot of space.

He had even specially ordered a batch of firm shelves that allowed the wine jars to be placed in layers. Otherwise, there would be wine jars everywhere in the Archean realm.

Therefore, it was basically impossible to continue to expand the production capacity.

Unless the space was upgraded. However, after the space was upgraded a few times, the area of the Archean realm did not expand. Xia ruofei also knew that it was not easy to maintain a time flow of 30 times. Hence, he did not have much hope of expanding the area of the Archean realm after the space was upgraded.
