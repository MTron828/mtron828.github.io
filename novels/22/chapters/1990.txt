1991 True brothers (1)

Zhao Yongjun was standing beside Wu Qiang with a smile on his face.

Xia ruofei was not surprised. Since he had informed Wu Qiang to pick him up, it would be very easy for Zhao Yongjun to get the news.

Although he told Zhao Yongjun that he didn’t need to pick him up, he couldn’t resist Zhao Yongjun’s enthusiasm!

In fact, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others were not only Xia ruofei’s close friends but also important business partners. The clubhouse project in Beijing might not be a big deal to Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun, but it was very important to song Rui, Hou Liang, and the others.

Moreover, even the elders in Zhao Yongjun’s family, including general Zhao Cheng, were very supportive of them being on good terms with Xia ruofei.

Hence, Zhao Yongjun came to pick Xia ruofei up to show how important he was to him.

Of course, this time Xia ruofei suddenly wanted to apply for another set of identity documents, so Zhao Yongjun did not inform song Rui and the others. Instead, he went to Wu Qiang to find out the exact time Xia ruofei would arrive in the capital. Then, he followed Wu Qiang to the airport alone.

Xia ruofei smiled and walked over quickly. He gave Zhao Yongjun a hug and said,””Brother Zhao, we’re all brothers. I said you don’t have to pick me up. Why are you still so polite?”

“I’m also free!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”I just wanted to see you earlier.”

Zhao Yongjun continued,”kid, you’re good now!” He even used a public jet! If I didn’t ask Wu Qiang in advance, I would have run to the terminal and waited for an entire day without seeing you!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”just say the word when you need it!” I’ll give you the guarantee!”

“You didn’t rent it?” Zhao Yongjun asked,”you bought it?”

Xia ruofei laughed,”it’s almost the same as buying it!” In short, you can use it whenever you need it!”

“Not bad, you!” Zhao Yongjun said,”we’re still having a small fight! You’re already using a private jet! This speed of making money was unparalleled! However, your company has indeed become very popular recently! If we can get 100 million US dollars from an auction, buying a bugger plane is nothing …”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not explain much about the plane.

The three of them walked to the car and got into Xia ruofei’s Land Rover. Zhao Yongjun didn’t drive here today. He left his car at Xia ruofei’s courtyard in liuhai Lane and came with Wu Qiang’s car.

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun sat in the wide back seat of the Land Rover. Wu Qiang started the car and drove out of the airport, heading in the direction of the siheyuan.

Zhao Yongjun threw a big envelope from the back seat to Xia ruofei and said,””Take it! I didn’t fail you!”

Xia ruofei quickly opened the envelope. It contained the documents for his new identity. There was an ID card, a driver’s license, a passport, and so on. There was even a Visa card. Zhao Yongjun knew that Xia ruofei was going to Italy, so he carefully helped him with the card.

“Ruofei, I don’t have much spare money,” Zhao Yongjun said.”I’ve saved 100000 dollars in my card for you, and I can also withdraw another 100000 dollars. If you spend it sparingly, it should be enough!”

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei smiled and put the documents and bank card back into the envelope. Then, he said,”give me your account number. I’ll transfer the money to you later. Oh, do you want US dollars or Chinese dollars …”

“Nonsense!” Zhao Yongjun cursed,”you want to settle this with me? it’s just a small amount of money. You little brat, are you asking for a beating!”

“Don ‘t!” Xia ruofei said,”this matter is already troublesome enough for you! I can’t let you pay for it …”

Xia ruofei was clear that it was not easy to get a real identity like this. Even if Zhao Yongjun did it personally, he would have to use up a lot of favors. How could he still accept so much money from Zhao Yongjun?

“If you don’t treat me as a brother, then continue to talk to me about money!” Zhao Yongjun said,”although I’m not as rich as you, I can still afford a hundred thousand dollars! I’m a man of this rule. If I’m working for my brother, I must do it well!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”Okay, okay, okay!” Brother Zhao, I won’t mention this anymore!”

He and Zhao Yongjun weren’t just business partners. They were good friends, so he didn’t feel like he owed Zhao Yongjun a favor just because of 100000 dollars, which wasn’t much to either of them.

Besides, in terms of profits, Xia ruofei would have plenty of opportunities to repay Zhao Yongjun and the others in the future. The future profits from the club project alone would far exceed Zhao Yongjun’s expectations. Xia ruofei was definitely the key reason why this project could be established and become popular.

“Now this is more like it!” Zhao Yongjun nodded with satisfaction.

Then, he took out a name card from his pocket and handed it to Xia ruofei.””Go and find this person tomorrow. He will help you settle the rest!”

As Wu Qiang was still driving, Zhao Yongjun did not make himself clear. It was not that Jian Jia did not trust Wu Qiang, but Xia ruofei’s trip abroad was very urgent and he had specially created an identity, so Zhao Yongjun was very careful. So far, he was the only one who knew that Xia ruofei was using this identity. Even song Rui and the others did not know. They did not even know that Xia ruofei had come to the capital.
