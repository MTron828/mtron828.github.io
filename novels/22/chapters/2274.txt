Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh in his heart. None of these old men were easy to deal with! Back at the hospital, elder Liu had rejected the offer without hesitation, but now, elder song had spoken his judgment without hesitation.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re right. Old master Liu is very determined. I can tell that there’s no room for negotiation.”

Elder song looked at Xia ruofei with a smile and said,””RUO Fei! You can just get what you deserve, you don’t have to consider the song family. The song family and the Liu family have been fighting for decades, and neither has gained any advantage. My body is still good now, so I don’t need to find outside help. ”

The more elder song looked at Xia ruofei, the more satisfied he was. He regretted that he did not have a granddaughter of the right age. Otherwise, he would definitely make the decision to marry Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei said,”Grandpa song, although the Alliance didn’t come to an end, Grandpa Liu has agreed to stay out of the song family’s way. They won’t go against the song family. They’ll remove all their previous arrangements. Also, when the song family has conflicts with other forces, the Liu family can remain neutral. At least, they won’t help either side.”

Elder song’s eyes widened. This was beyond his expectations.

“Did old Liu say it himself?” he asked.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei smiled.”Before I left, old master Liu also said that in a complicated situation, there’s no way to stay out of each other’s way. However, if there is a conflict of interest between the two sides, we can negotiate to resolve it. ”

Eccentric song nodded. After a long pause, he smiled and said,”I really didn’t expect that you would bring back such a big surprise when you met that old man.”

Indeed, the promise of nonaggression that Xia ruofei brought back was undoubtedly very positive for the song family.

“Alright!” Elder song continued. Since old Liu has spoken, I’ll give the order as soon as possible to stop the confrontation between the two sides at all levels. If there is a conflict of resources and interests, try to negotiate!”

“I’m only in charge of pulling the strings. I won’t interfere in the specific matters. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The disputes of interests between big families were very complicated, and could not be explained clearly in two or three sentences. However, the two helmsmen of the Liu and song families were both veterans who had been in battle for a long time. With such a tacit understanding and consensus between them, the conflict between the two families should be basically resolved.

Although it was impossible to have one more ally, one less enemy could also reduce a lot of consumption, especially a huge enemy like the Liu family.

Therefore, elder song was in a good mood and invited Xia ruofei to stay for dinner. He even made an exception and had two more glasses of wine.

While they were eating, elder song asked Xia ruofei about his company, especially about taking over the Liu family’s Pharmaceutical Group. There were many things involved, and elder song expressed that he would have the song family’s full support to ensure the smooth completion of the share transfer and the acquisition of the factory.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that Liu Lifang had the idea of keeping a portion of the shares, and Liu qun Yan even had the idea of using these shares to gradually nibble away at Tao Yuan company. However, he knew that it would be a very complicated matter to take over such a huge Pharmaceutical Group. With Tao Yuan company’s current strength, it would be difficult to check all the reports and accounts.

Therefore, he didn’t decline. He only expressed his gratitude to elder song and said that if there was a need, he would be the first to ask the song family for help.

After dinner, Xia ruofei did not stay too long in the song family’s old house as he knew that the old man went to bed early. He chatted with elder song for a while and then got up to leave.

Manager Lu personally accompanied Xia ruofei to the front yard in the same bulletproof car with the red flag.

The chauffeur opened the door and waited by the car.

As Xia ruofei was saying goodbye to manager Lu, Fang Zhongming, the head of the song family’s security guards, came over in a hurry and said,””Mr. Xia, please wait!”

Xia ruofei had already bent down to get into the car, but when he saw this, he straightened up and looked at Fang Zhongming.

Fang Zhongming held a long paper box in his hand and walked quickly to Xia ruofei. He said,””Mr. Xia, this is a gift from the Bureau chief. Please accept it.”

Xia ruofei quickly took it with both hands and said,””This is too precious!”

Manager Lu was very envious and couldn’t help but say,””Ruofei, the Bureau chief rarely inscribes you! Isn’t this already your second painting?”

“Hehe!” Xia ruofei was so happy that he could not close his mouth.

“Open it and take a look!” Manager Lu said,”let us also broaden our horizons ...”

“Manager Lu, you work beside Grandpa song every day. Do you think you don’t have a chance to see his calligraphy?” Xia ruofei hugged the box and said,”don’t tell me you’re thinking of ...”

“You child!” Manager Lu chuckled and said,”the Bureau chief gave it to you. Who would dare to snatch it from you? I just wanted to experience it ...”

“You’re quite curious!” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

He opened the box and carefully took out elder song’s calligraphy.

This piece of calligraphy was rectangular in shape and had been rolled up and placed in the paper box. After Xia ruofei took it out, Fang Zhongming helped from the side and the two of them slowly unfolded it.
