Luo Qingfeng closed his eyes and raised his head slightly without saying a word.

How could he not be reluctant to leave this world? Even ants covet their lives, let alone humans? After he broke through to the Aurous core stage, he had a place in the current cultivation world. Furthermore, he was in charge of a sect and had absolute authority in the star Seizer sect.

Living such a Wonderful Life, if it wasn’t for the fact that he couldn’t escape even after using all his means, how could he stay here and wait for death?

Seeing that Luo Qingfeng did not speak, Xia ruofei’s face darkened and he said,””He’s really unafraid of death! Is it so embarrassing to submit to me? You’d rather lose your precious life than work for me?”

Luo Qingfeng suddenly opened his eyes and asked,””Submit to you? Would you be at ease letting me leave the formation? Rather than becoming your prisoner and struggling on whilst at death’s door, I’d rather die!”

“Haha!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if that’s the case, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

After he finished speaking, he had a thought.

Luo Qingfeng immediately felt the blue travel immortal sword in front of his neck tremble slightly, as if it was about to cut down.

At that moment, even though Luo Qingfeng thought that he had already seen through life and death, he could not help but be scared out of his wits.

There was great Terror between life and death.

Luo Qingfeng could clearly feel Xia ruofei’s killing intent. At that moment, he felt that he was so close to death.

He could not help but shout,”wait!” Wait a minute!”

A mocking smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. Under his control, the blue travel immortal sword settled down again. Luo Qingfeng could not help but secretly heave a sigh of relief. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You have any last words?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

Luo Qingfeng took a deep breath and asked,””As long as I submit to you, you will not kill me?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”of course. Why else would I waste so much time talking to you?” Don’t forget, your life and death are in my hands!”

Luo Qingfeng hesitated for a moment before he looked up at Xia ruofei and said,””Good! I can submit to you! I only hope that you will keep your word! Let me go first. ”

Luo Qingfeng was still fantasizing. He guessed that Xia ruofei might have wanted to ask for information or something from him, which was why he had spent so much time and effort. He might as well go with the flow and pretend to be a snake to save his life first. If he could find a good opportunity, he might be able to reverse the whole situation.

After all, Luo Qingfeng’s actual cultivation was much higher than Xia ruofei ‘s.

Without the constraints of the array and a sudden sneak attack at the same time, Luo Qingfeng felt that his chances of success were quite high.

Xia ruofei seemed to have seen through Luo Qingfeng’s thoughts. He sneered and said,””Luo Qingfeng, what are you thinking? Do you really think you’ll submit just because you say so? Do you think I’m a three – year – old kid?”

Luo Qingfeng could not help but feel angry from embarrassment. He asked,””Since you don’t trust me, why waste your breath?”

“Since I said I want you to submit, I have my own way!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After saying that, he moved his mind, and an extremely complicated mark made up of spiritual power appeared in front of him.

Xia ruofei said coldly,”Luo Qingfeng, this is your only chance!” The choice is up to you! Now, completely open up your sea of consciousness and don’t resist, or ... You can choose to die immediately!”

The complicated mark was the child mark of the soul mark. It was the last child mark that Xia ruofei had condensed.

When the child seal of the soul seal appeared, Luo Qingfeng’s face turned pale.

He was only five to six meters away from Xia ruofei. At such a close distance, the moment the child seal appeared, he could already feel a terrifying aura. Especially when he looked at the child seal, he felt as if his soul would be sucked in.

Luo Qingfeng was filled with fear toward the child seal of the soul seal. He had already vaguely guessed the use of this seal.

Under Xia ruofei’s control, the child seal slowly floated toward Luo Qingfeng.

Xia ruofei also said indifferently,”Luo Qingfeng, you’d better not try to destroy this imprint. Also, don’t deliberately reject it in your spiritual sea. Otherwise, if you damage the imprint, you’ll be dead too!” I don’t mind telling you that it takes a lot of time and energy to form a mark like this. If it’s damaged because you don’t cooperate, I won’t try to form it again. I can’t guarantee that you won’t really submit, so I can only kill you! So ... You’d better not have any other thoughts, and at the same time, pray that I succeed!”

After saying this, Xia ruofei’s tone softened a little.””You don’t have to be too pessimistic. This thing is just to prevent you from having disloyalty towards me. It won’t make you lose your self – consciousness, and I won’t use it to force you to do something against justice. In truth, submitting to me is also an opportunity for you. In the current cultivation environment, it’s already extremely difficult for someone at your level to make progress. The cultivation resources I have here are beyond your imagination. Let’s not talk about other things, you saw the spirit crystal that Zheng Yongshou brought back for you, right? I still have a lot of intact spirit crystals. As long as you perform well, it’s not impossible to give you one or two. Moreover, I have also mastered the great void clear sky formation. I don’t think I need to explain the cultivation environment of this Paradise Island in the future, right?”

Initially, Luo Qingfeng had wanted to resist and secretly destroy the mark. However, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he could not help but feel a chill in his heart. Xia ruofei’s next words were full of enchantment, and even Luo Qingfeng could not help but be tempted.

Finally, a bitter smile appeared on Luo Qingfeng’s face. He had finally given up on that Last Fantasy.

Seeing Luo Qingfeng’s expression, Xia ruofei asked lightly,””I’m sure you’ve already thought it through?”

Luo Qingfeng let out a long sigh and nodded silently.

Xia ruofei’s mind moved slightly, and the soul imprint that was slowly floating toward Luo Qingfeng suddenly sped up by several times. It flashed like a meteor and directly sank into Luo Qingfeng’s forehead ...

Sure enough, Luo Qingfeng did not resist at all. He completely let go of his sea of consciousness, and the soul seal entered his sea of consciousness without any hindrance.

Qingfeng Luo’s spiritual power had also reached the spirit gathering realm, and his sea of consciousness was much wider than Zheng Yongshou, Wang Boshan, and Liu chengfeng. There was no need to mention an ordinary person like bainilatti. Compared to Qingfeng Luo’s sea of consciousness, bainilatti’s sea of consciousness was simply a small puddle.

As Luo Qingfeng had completely given up on resisting, the child seal of the soul seal easily found its position in his spiritual ocean and successfully imprinted itself on it.

When Xia ruofei felt the spiritual connection with the child seal, he finally heaved a long sigh of relief.

He knew that the soul seal had completely merged with Luo Qingfeng’s consciousness. Even if Luo Qingfeng’s spiritual power cultivation had reached the spirit gathering realm, there was no way he could remove it.

If he tried it by force, there was a high probability that it would cause permanent damage to his sea of consciousness, or even directly die.

Furthermore, after leaving the soul seal, Luo Qingfeng would not resist him at all, nor would he try to remove the soul seal.

Sure enough, after planting the soul seal, a complicated look appeared on Luo Qingfeng’s face. The hostility in his eyes when he looked at Xia ruofei had completely disappeared. In its place was absolute submission from the depths of his soul.

With a thought from Xia ruofei, the blue travel immortal sword flew back to his dantian.

On the other hand, Luo Qingfeng knelt on one knee and cupped his fists at Xia ruofei respectfully.””Master! This subordinate has offended you, please punish me, master!”
