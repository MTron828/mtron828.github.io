2261 Decisiveness_In an antique study, elder song was reading today’s newspaper with his reading glasses. Although elder song had left his position as a leader, he would still read the newspaper and documents sent by the veteran Cadre Department every day. He was still very concerned about the state affairs.

Manager Lu knocked on the door and said,””Chief, Xia ruofei is here.”

Elder song took off his reading glasses and smiled at Xia ruofei, who was standing at the door.”Why are you standing there? Come in and sit!”

“Yes!” Xia ruofei responded and walked into the study.

Manager Lu personally went to fill elder song’s teacup with water and then poured another cup of tea for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei quickly stood up and thanked manager Lu. Manager Lu’s administrative level was the Deputy Department, which was the same level as the Deputy Governor of the southeast province. Since he personally poured water for Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei naturally couldn’t just accept it. He still had to be polite.

Manager Lu smiled and nodded at Xia ruofei. Then, he left the study quietly and closed the door behind him.

The study immediately fell silent.

Xia ruofei stared at elder song, who was sitting opposite him. He noticed that elder song’s face was ruddy and he looked energetic. What was even more exaggerated was that his silver hair had turned Back to Black and white.

“Grandpa song, you look great.” Xia ruofei smiled.”That’s really worth celebrating!”

Elder song laughed heartily and pointed at Xia ruofei.”This is all thanks to you, little guy! The Guanyin pendant you gave me was too magical. It wasn’t so obvious at first, but as I wore it for a long time, the effect became more and more magical. Not only did I grow black hair, but I also feel a little dizzy wearing these reading glasses. I think my eyes have also improved. I’ll have to get Xiao Lu to give me a new pair of reading glasses tomorrow. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’ve regained your youth!” This is great news!”

The spirit – gathering Jade Guanyin could gather spiritual energy to nourish the wearer at all times. Naturally, the longer one wore it, the more obvious the effect would be. Now, it seemed that the effect of elder song wearing the Jade Guanyin was gradually showing. Xia ruofei was naturally happy for him.

“I want to dye my hair back to white so that people won’t think I’m an old monster!” Elder song said with a smile.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Grandpa song, you’re exaggerating! Besides ... Even if he wanted to dye it, he should have done it black! Who dyes their hair white?”

“That’s not a bad idea. ” Elder song said with a smile.

In fact, when he held a leadership position, he had dyed his hair black. Of course, that was for the sake of the country’s image. After all, as a leader, he was on the news almost every day. After he retired, he did not dye his hair at all. It should be known that hair dyes were not good for the body. No matter how natural it was, it was impossible to not have any harm.

Elder song continued,”and that Zhong Kui ornament you gave me last time, it’s also quite extraordinary!” In the past, This Old House always had a cool feeling, and after living here for a long time, I felt a bit uncomfortable. However, after that decoration, I feel that the air has become much warmer, and the staff at home look much better!”

“It’s good that you can help!”Xia ruofei smiled.

Elder song sighed,”ruofei!” It’s the song family’s fortune to have met you. If it wasn’t for you, I would probably be playing chess with my old comrades at the eight Treasures mountain. Our song family has been going smoothly for the past two years, and it’s all thanks to the miraculous hand that brought us back to life!”

Xia ruofei replied,”Grandpa song, you’re too kind!” You’re the general that I admired the most when I was a soldier. It’s my honor to be able to help you with your health!”

Xia ruofei knew that elder song was going to talk about the Liu family, so he just said a few polite words and closed his mouth. He looked at elder song with clear eyes, waiting for him to continue.

Elder song looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Did Xiao Rui tell you?”

Xia ruofei was stunned and said,”you mean the Liu family?” He didn’t tell you the details ... He only said that the old master of the GAO family came to see you. ”

“You don’t have to be nervous,” said eccentric song with a smile. Old Gao came looking for me, and it’s about old Liu. He hopes that I can persuade you to help. ”

Xia ruofei looked at elder song quietly without saying a word. He knew that elder song had already made his decision. He just needed to listen.

Of course, elder song couldn’t force him. If he really didn’t want to, it was useless even if the God of heaven came to intercede. Although paradise Corporation was in the country, its core competitiveness had nothing to do with the domestic farms and pharmaceutical factories. If he was forced into a corner, Xia ruofei could directly go abroad.

Most of his funds were in his overseas account, and as long as the spirit map space was still there, it wouldn’t be difficult to build another paradise company. The only loss he would suffer was the money from the initial investment.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not want to do this unless he had no other choice. He also believed that elder song would not force him to do something he was not willing to do.

“You know, old Gao saved my life. If he didn’t carry me down from the battlefield, I would have been dead. How could I have become a general or even a leader of the country?” elder song continued.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
