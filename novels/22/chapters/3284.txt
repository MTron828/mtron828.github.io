This difference was too great!

However, Xia ruofei did not have the time to lament. This was the only place where he could find clues. Even if there was any danger inside, he could not back out now.

Hence, Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He followed the Daoist boy and entered the true yang temple.

After walking through the gate, there was a small and dilapidated courtyard. The courtyard was overgrown with weeds, and it was obvious that it had not been maintained for a long time.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think,”it seems like this little Daoist is also a lazy puppet!” He didn’t even bother to maintain his own courtyard ...

After passing through this dilapidated courtyard and walking up a few steps, they would reach the front hall of the Taoist temple.

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks. He took an incense stick from the side and lit it up respectfully for the Three Pure Ones holy man.

Even though Xia ruofei was not a Taoist, it was only right for him to show some respect to the statue of the patriarch.

The little Daoist naturally did not rush him and just waited at the side.

At first, Xia ruofei had wanted to give some incense money, but he only had Chinese dollars or US dollars. He thought that these earthly currencies were useless here.

So, he looked at the dusty Merit Box and finally gave up the idea of being happy.

After they finished burning the incense, Xia ruofei followed the little Daoist from the side of the main hall to the back. After going down a few steps, they arrived at the back of the hall.

The building of the back hall was much lower than that of the front hall. In fact, it was a relatively small siheyuan. The building of the front hall was one side of the small siheyuan of the back hall. The other three sides were one – story single – story houses, with about seven or eight rooms.

As soon as Xia ruofei arrived at the rear hall, he heard footsteps. He couldn’t help but be invigorated. At the same time, he raised his guard and was ready to release his flying sword to fight at any time.

Xia ruofei looked up and saw an old Daoist walking out of a room with a smile. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The old Daoist’s hair and beard were all white, and he was wearing an old Daoist robe that had been washed a little white. He even had a sword on his back. Although this old Daoist looked very old, his face was very ruddy, and his skin was very smooth, with almost no wrinkles. In addition, his legs were tied with Greaves, and he walked like a tiger. One look and you could tell that he had some cultivation.

The White – haired old Taoist walked in front of Xia ruofei, bowed and said,””The Buddha of immeasurable longevity! May I know your name?”

Xia ruofei bowed slightly and said,”I’m Xia ruofei. May I know your Dharma name?”

“So it’s scholar Xia, it’s a pleasure to meet you!” The White – haired Daoist said with a smile,”I’m Zhen Yang. I’m cultivating here with my disciple, Qingfeng.”

It turned out that the Dao child puppet also had a name. However, the name Qingfeng was too common and it was difficult to leave a deep impression on people!

Of course, the White – haired Daoist priest’s name wasn’t that advanced. It was unknown whether he had taken over the true yang temple and decided to call it true yang, or if it was because his original Daoist name was true yang that he named the temple true yang temple.

In any case, no matter what the situation was, it was definitely an act of laziness.

Of course, this wasn’t because Daoist Zhen Yang was slacking off, nor was it because the little Daoist Qing Feng was slacking off. It was because the Almighty being who had created them was slacking off.

Yes, although it was only a short contact, Xia ruofei could basically judge that this white – haired old Taoist Zhen Yang was still a puppet, even though he was much more realistic than the Taoist child Qing Feng and had a higher level of intelligence.

When he saw Qing Feng outside the tower, Xia ruofei could not make a quick judgment. However, after interacting with Qing Feng and observing the residents of the mini town, he had gained a lot of experience in judging.

At first glance, this white – haired Zhen Yang Daoist was basically flawless. However, Xia ruofei had already gained a lot of experience. After a little test, he could confirm his judgment.

For example, when Xia ruofei was speaking, he seemed to have moved a few times. Under normal circumstances, the other party’s gaze would definitely follow Xia ruofei’s movements to show courtesy. In fact, the White – haired Daoist Zhen Yang had indeed done so. However, his reaction was slightly slower than a normal human ‘s. Hence, the final effect was that Xia ruofei moved his feet while Zhen Yang continued to smile at the position where Xia ruofei had been standing before quickly adjusting himself.

The delay was only for a second, but it was enough for Xia ruofei to make a judgment.

Of course, he had also used a few other tricks to test this white – haired old Daoist Zhen Yang. The conclusion was that there was a 90% chance that this old Daoist wasn’t a real human, but a puppet.

To be honest, Xia ruofei was a little disappointed to come to such a conclusion.

He really wanted to meet a real human now, because he knew that communicating with these “NPCs” would not yield any results. Unless the other party wanted to tell him the information in the first place, he would not be able to get anything out of them.

Besides, Xia ruofei was the only living person in the secret realm so far. To be honest, he was still very lonely.

Especially when Xia ruofei passed by the bustling streets of the mini town, the sense of loneliness was even stronger.

It was as if the bustling scene described in Zhu Ziqing’s essay “moonlight in the Lotus pond” belonged to them, and I had nothing.

Xia ruofei’s mood was only down for a short while. He quickly adjusted his mood and smiled.””So it’s Daoist priest Zhen Yang, this one offers his greetings! May I know why you asked little Daoist Qing Feng to bring me here?”

Even though Xia ruofei felt that Taoist Zhen Yang was much more advanced than the little Daoist Qing Feng and could at least have basic communication, he still spoke in accordance with the customs of the ancient people. He even specifically said,”what’s the matter?” he thought that this should be able to trigger the next mission, right?

The White – haired Daoist Zhen Yang smiled.”This poor Daoist indeed has a request. I’ve taken the liberty to invite you here. Please forgive me!”

“If there’s anything you need, just say it!” Xia ruofei said,”as long as it is within my power, I will do my best!”

“Thank you, thank you!” The White – haired Daoist Zhen Yang said,”scholar Xia, please follow this poor Daoist. Let’s sit down and slowly talk!”

With that, the White – haired Taoist, Zhen Yang, led Xia ruofei into the quiet room facing the front hall. Xia ruofei looked around. Although Zhen Yang looked dilapidated, this quiet room was tidied up very neatly. Although the furnishings were simple – there was nothing more than a bed, a table, and a chair. There were no unnecessary decorations, but it appeared very clean. The simple furniture was spotless. There was even a sandalwood incense burning on the table, emitting smoke.

One must always be on guard against others. Xia ruofei secretly held his breath in case the sandalwood scent was strange.

In any case, with his current cultivation level, holding his breath for an hour was no problem at all. He could hold on for such a long time just by relying on internal breathing.

After old Daoist Zhen Yang invited Xia ruofei to take a seat, he instructed,””Qingfeng, why aren’t you pouring some tea?”

“Yes! Master!” Qing Feng, the Daoist boy who was standing at the door, bowed and said.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”Taoist Zhen Yang, there’s no need to drink tea. If you have anything to say, just say it!” As long as I can help, I won’t hesitate to help!”

“Hahaha! You’re very straightforward, master Xia!” Old Daoist Zhen Yang smiled and said,”I took the liberty to invite you here because I have a few questions to ask you. To tell you the truth, these questions have troubled this poor Daoist for many years, and I haven’t been able to find an answer, so I urgently need someone to answer them. ”

At this point, old Taoist Zhen Yang looked at Xia ruofei and continued,””Of course, I won’t let you help me for nothing. As long as you can answer my questions, I’ll definitely thank you!”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”this should be the successful trigger of the mission, right?” I’d like to see how difficult this mission is.

Xia ruofei said without hesitation,””What problem has troubled you for so many years? Daoist priest, Why Don’t You Tell Me So that I can also consider it!”
