2894 Quarreling between brothers (1)

“My dear brother, you’re too naive!” Davis revealed a sinister smile and elegantly took out a piece of paper from the inner pocket of his suit. He slowly spread it open and said,”Charlie, did you forget that you signed a will a year ago? once you die, all the shares under your name will be inherited by me?”

It turned out that this middle – aged white man, Charlie, and Davis, who was holding a gun in front of him, were actually brothers. What was happening now was obviously not brotherly respect, but a quarrel between brothers.

Charlie was stunned for a moment before he shouted angrily,”Davis! When did I sign such a will? You’re crazy about money!”

Davis’s expression didn’t change as he calmly said,””You’ll sign it soon, and the time of signing was a year ago. Is there a problem? My dear brother!”

Charlie suddenly came back to his senses. His eyes were burning with rage as he glared at Davis and roared,””You want to forge a will? In your dreams! I’m about to die, why should I cooperate with you to sign this bullshit will? Even if I die, I won’t let you have your way!”

Davis smiled and lightly said,””Charlie, you’ll definitely cooperate.”

“In your dreams!” Charlie gritted his teeth and said,”just kill me! Don’t be delusional!”

Davis laughed and said,”don’t be anxious!” The moonlight is so bright tonight, I don’t want to send you on your way so early! Why don’t you listen to what this will is about?”

After saying that, Davis ignored Charlie, who had his eyes closed and was seeking death, and continued to read,”I, Charlie cohe, am now under the witness of my personal lawyer Mr. Jenkins, making the following will ...”

Charlie’s eyes snapped open and he roared with anger,”You scoundrel! You even bribed Jenkins!”

Even if a will was signed by him, it could still be invalid if there wasn’t a qualified lawyer present to witness it. Davis wrote the will like this to make sure it was safe, and obviously, he had also bribed Mr. Jenkins.

Jenkins was Charlie’s personal legal counsel, and he had been working for Charlie for more than 15 years. Basically, all of Charlie’s major legal problems were all handled by Jenkins, including some of the more shady ones. From this, it could be seen how much trust Charlie had in Jenkins.

Clearly, even Jenkins had betrayed him, which made Charlie even more furious.

Davis seemed to be enjoying the sight of his brother’s emotional breakdown. A bright smile appeared on his face as he said,”Charlie, my dear brother, you’re just too impatient. Jenkins is just a small fry, and I haven’t even finished reading my will!”

After that, Davis continued to read,”if I die, all the assets under my name, including but not limited to my family business group shares, all real estate, and cash, 100 million dollars will be inherited by my wife Anina and son Luca. The rest will be inherited by my younger brother, Mr. Davis Koch.”

Davis finished reading the will, then patiently folded it and put it in his pocket. He then smiled and said,””Charlie, did you hear that? I’ve left 100 million US dollars for my dear sister – in – Law and nephew! To be honest, I’m really a soft – hearted person! This will is too beneficial for you!”

After listening to it, Charlie also completely understood that the reason Davis had taken out this will without fear and was certain that he would sign it was because he had completely taken the initiative and understood his mentality.

It was true that if he insisted on not signing, he would be dead tonight. According to the federal law, his wife, Anina, would be the first in line to inherit his property. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

However, Charlie knew very well that if he were to pass away, Anina and Lucca would be left behind. Even if they inherited all of his inheritance, what ability would they have to keep it? Davis only needed to make the mother and son disappear without a trace like he did to him, and he would be able to rightfully inherit these assets.

Of course, Charlie had already seen through Davis’s thoughts. The reason Davis had taken out such a will and left Anina and her son with a hundred million dollars in assets was not because he was soft – hearted and would not kill his own brother. How could he be soft – hearted to his sister – in – Law and nephew?

Davis was completely considering his own interests.

First of all, if Charlie’s family of three were to encounter accidents and die one after another, then Davis, the vested beneficiary, would definitely be questioned. Although it was difficult for others to find evidence, Davis was not willing to lose his reputation, so he was willing to spend some money to buy this reputation.

Second and most importantly, if Anina and Lucca inherited the inheritance and died in an accident, and Davis inherited the inheritance as a relative, it would be equivalent to paying two taxes. The taxes in the United States were very heavy, and 100 million dollars was nothing compared to that.

After all, the famous Coch family was one of the few big families in America. The Coch family’s assets had already reached more than 300 billion US dollars. As the current head of the family, Charlie had more than 70% of the shares in the family group under his name, and his net worth was at least 200 billion US dollars.
