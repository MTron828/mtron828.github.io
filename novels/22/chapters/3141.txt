3142 Going to the capital (1)

On the Clearwater flying boat, Chen Xuan took out some high – quality tea leaves for everyone to enjoy. Although he had already given the last bit of wild tea he brought to Xia ruofei, the flying boat naturally did not lack good tea leaves.

“Brother Xia, the first heaven society doesn’t have a large business in the secular world, but we have an office in the capital. When we arrive in the capital today, let me settle the place for you!” Chen Xuan chuckled.

Hearing this, Song Wei smiled and said,”Brother Chen, the capital is ruofei’s territory. Of course, he’ll settle the accommodation!”

“Yeah!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if not, wouldn’t that be a slap to my face?”

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”isn’t little brother Xia’s territory in the three mountains?” How did the capital become your territory?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m sorry, sect leader mu. I don’t have much territory, but I have many friends in the capital. I’ve also bought some properties ... By the way, let’s stay at my house today!” I bought a courtyard house in liuhai Lane in the capital. It’s quite spacious. ”

“Siheyuan?” Liu Mansha smiled and said,”is it an ancient building? This is quite to my liking!”

“It’s not particularly old. It’s a Qing Dynasty building with some renovations done at the back.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“That’s good!” “It’s a deal then. We’ll stay at brother Xia’s house today!” Chen Xuan said.

“Oh, right. Brother Xia,” Chen Xuan continued,”have you thought of who you can find to coordinate with the people in the Forbidden City?”

Before Xia ruofei could reply, Song Wei asked curiously,””RUO Fei, you’re going to the Forbidden City for business?”

“We want to borrow the high – definition scanning equipment from the Forbidden City’s Natural Museum,” Xia ruofei explained.”Song Rui or brother Zhao should be able to help us with this, right?”

Song Wei laughed and said,”why do you have to go so far?” You’re looking for my help!”

“You?” Xia ruofei could not help but turn to look at Song Wei. Then, he realized.

He patted his forehead with a bitter smile and said,””I’m really giving up what’s near and seeking what’s far! I almost forgot that you major in archeology. You must have been in contact with the relic restoration team of the Forbidden City’s Natural Museum, right?”

Song Wei smiled and nodded.

“Is it okay to borrow equipment from them?” Xia ruofei asked.

“What problem could there be?” Song Wei said,”just leave it to me! When we arrive in Beijing, I’ll make a few calls first. As long as they don’t have a lot of cultural relics that need to be scanned, then it’ll be fine!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he chuckled and said to Chen Xuan,””Brother Chen, look, the problem has been solved ...”

Chen Xuan was speechless. Xia ruofei had not even thought of who to ask for help. Whoever he caught was the one he was looking for!

However, this also showed that Xia ruofei did not think much of the equipment. Chen Xuan was relieved.

Although the speed of the Clearwater flying boat was not as fast as Xia ruofei’s Black flying boat, it only took about an hour to travel from the three mountains to the capital.

After chatting for a while, the airboat was already close to the sky above the capital.

The Clearwater flying boat hovered above a secluded alley near the siheyuan. Everyone jumped off the flying boat, and Chen Xuan kept it.

Everyone followed Xia ruofei and walked along the alley for a while before they arrived at the main entrance of Xia ruofei’s courtyard house.

Liu Mansha and Mu Sheng couldn’t help but sigh in admiration when they saw the spacious and bright door.

At their age, although they had not experienced the Qing Dynasty, most of their childhood living environments were buildings of this style. Furthermore, all of these cultivation sects had ancient buildings. Hence, when they saw this courtyard house, they naturally felt a sense of familiarity.

Xia ruofei used his fingerprint to unlock the door. Then, he turned around and said with a smile,”Everyone, please come in!”

There were also security guards living in the side rooms on the side of the main entrance. They were comrades recruited by Wu Qiang.

After hearing the sound, the veteran had already walked out of the penthouse and saw Xia ruofei walking in. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The veteran was so scared that he quickly stood at attention and shouted,””Mr. Xia, you’re back!”

Xia ruofei’s return was very sudden. He did not inform them to prepare a room or to pick him up.

However, under Wu Qiang’s leadership, the staff of the courtyard house had kept the place in order. Everyone had their own duties and did their best to complete their work, so they were not afraid of Xia ruofei’s sudden attack. The veteran just felt that it was a little sudden.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,”tell the kitchen to make more dishes. I’m inviting my friends to dinner.” Also ... Clean up the guest rooms in the middle courtyard. My friends are staying here today. ”

“Yes! Mr. Xia!” The veteran quickly said.

Xia ruofei continued to lead the group inside while introducing the siheyuan to them.

In the capital, it was rare to see such a large and perfectly restored courtyard house. Naturally, everyone was full of admiration.

After passing through the moon gate, everyone arrived at the middle courtyard where the master lived.

Right in the middle of the room was a row of three rooms that were connected to the main room. There were also many guest rooms on both sides of the room, more than enough for Chen Xuan and the others to stay in.

Wu Qiang had already rushed over from the backyard after receiving the notice from the main gate.
