3320 The inevitable choice (3)

It was because of Lin Hu’s roar that Xia ruofei resisted the urge to jump up. In the end, he hid in the sniper’s blind spot and watched Lin Hu sacrifice himself in front of him.

Seeing Lin Hu again in such a situation, and in the state he was in before he died, Xia ruofei’s mind was in a mess.

Lin Hu was still holding a Type 95 automatic rifle. He grinned at Xia ruofei and said,””RUO Fei, you’re doing pretty well now! Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten me! I’ve blocked a bullet for you before!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with tears as he said in a trembling voice,””How could I forget you? You’re my best brother and my best comrade in this life. I can forget anyone but you! Hu, I promised you back then that your mother is my mother! I’ve already brought your mother and sister to San Shan. Now that your mother has recognized me as her godson, I’ll take good care of them ...”

“Is that so?” Lin Hu’s lips curled up slightly as he said,”kid, can you really take good care of them? I don’t really believe it. ”

“What do you mean?” Xia ruofei was confused.”Hu, I don’t understand ...”

“My sister Qiao’ er likes you so much, but you turn a blind eye to it and make her sad every day. Is this how you help me take care of my sister?” Lin Hu said with a dissatisfied look.

Xia ruofei was stunned. He was not a fool. He could naturally feel Lin Qiao’s feelings for him. However, he would rather think that Lin Qiao’s dependence on her brother had shifted to him after her brother’s sacrifice.

After all, he already had Ling Qingxue and Song Wei. He also had Monica overseas. Even song Wei and Ling Qingxue didn’t know about this. He really didn’t dare to mess with any more girls.

Lin Hu had suddenly pointed this out today, and Xia ruofei was caught off guard. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Hu, I ...” Xia ruofei was at a loss for words.

“I’m just joking!”Lin Hu grinned. You were like this when you were in the Army. You liked to take everything seriously and couldn’t tell if it was a joke. I remember back in the recruit company, there was an old squad leader who was teasing you, and you almost broke his head. A new recruit dared to hit the squad leader. You were the only Scorpion in our Regiment to sh * t!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”You still have the nerve to talk about me? Don’t you know what kind of person you are? Who was the one who had secretly taken out the photo of the platoon leader’s fiancée from his theory study notebook for everyone to admire? I remember you were punished by the platoon leader to copy the discipline order a hundred times! How many nights did you stay up to finish it?”

Lin Hu couldn’t help but laugh out loud. The two of them sat down on the stone steps along the corridor and talked about some interesting things in their military lives. When they talked about the happy parts, they couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

The back garden of the house was filled with the laughter of the two.

After a long time, Xia ruofei sighed and said,””Hu, thank you for coming to accompany me for the past half an hour. I’m really happy to be able to talk to you about the past, but you should leave ...”

“Leave? Where to?” Lin Hu was dumbfounded.

“Go to where you came from ...” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and a sword light flashed, leaving a bloody wound on Lin Hu’s neck ...
