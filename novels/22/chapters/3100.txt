“Master, please give your orders!” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I don’t have any special instructions. In short, I just want you to be safe.” The production of wild tea was limited, so the scope of use had to be controlled in the early stages, and it had to be kept strictly confidential. In my opinion, it’s best to make the brewed wild tea into a ready – made drink. If it can be mixed with other flavors, it’s better not to make the tea fragrance so obvious. In this way, even if the disciples drink the wild tea themselves, they may not be able to guess what they are drinking. ”

Luo Qingfeng nodded and said,”this old servant understands!” Please rest assured, master, this old servant will definitely choose the disciples with the highest loyalty and relatively better talent to take it first!”

“In addition, some disciples with low cultivation levels should not consume the wild tea for the time being.” Xia ruofei nodded. It’s mainly because we’ve taken into account that only the first time a person drinks wild tea will have an effect. If a Qi Layer 3 or 4 cultivator drinks wild tea, although their cultivation can also improve by a large margin, once they reach the high Qi layer, they won’t have this opportunity. And the higher the cultivation, the harder it is to break through the bottleneck. ”

Although Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, Tang Haoran, and the others did not have a high cultivation level when they consumed the wild tea, they were different. Xia ruofei was confident that when they encountered a bottleneck in the future, he would provide them with better cultivation resources so that their cultivation path would be smooth. However, the ordinary disciples of the star Seizer sect definitely did not have such a blessing. Therefore, the effects of wild tea were even more precious to these ordinary disciples. Of course, they could not simply use it when their cultivation was very low.

Luo Qingfeng immediately understood and quickly said,””Yes! Master, this old servant understands! I’m just about to use it on the blade!”

“This is what I meant!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”in short, you have to grasp the specific scope of use by yourself. I don’t have any specific requirements. Just pay attention to the few points I mentioned just now!”

“Understood!” Luo Qingfeng said,”don’t worry, master! This old servant will definitely not let down master’s painstaking efforts. With the wild tea, the star Seizer sect’s strength will definitely increase by a large margin. The sect’s formation is also much better than before. I believe that in time, a second or third Aurous core cultivator will appear in the star Seizer sect. By then, it will only be a matter of time before the sect becomes a top sect!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I naturally believe you! In the future, the star Seizer sect will definitely be a great help to me!”

With that, Xia ruofei took out a small bag of wild tea from the spirit map space and handed it to Luo Qingfeng. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

There wasn’t a lot of wild tea, enough for about ten people to drink.

In reality, the spirit map space naturally produced more wild tea than that. After all, there were two wild tea trees. As long as Xia ruofei was willing to use the time array flag, he could pick tea leaves almost every day.

Of course, even so, the number of wild tea leaves was not so high that it was overflowing.

As Xia ruofei was concerned about the effects of the tea leaves, he had very high requirements for the tea leaves. There were not many leaves that could be picked from a wild tea tree. Even if he used the time array flag to grow these two wild tea trees every day, he could only harvest about two taels of finished tea leaves a day.

“I’ll give you this much first!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”there will be more. Pick the disciples who meet the conditions and give priority to their cultivation!”

Qingfeng Luo’s eyes were burning as he looked at the small bag of wild tea as if he had seen his dream lover. He grabbed the tea bag in his hand and said with a trembling voice,””This old servant here represents the star Seizer sect! Thank you, master, for your great kindness!”

After he finished speaking, Luo Qingfeng was about to kneel on the ground. However, Xia ruofei raised his hands and a gentle force lifted Luo Qingfeng up.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”there’s no need for this between us.” Qingfeng, you’ll be in charge of the star Seizer sect during this period of time and focus on improving the overall strength of the sect! I have a feeling that the world of cultivation won’t always be so peaceful, and the cultivation environment might not be so bad either. When the time comes, it will be a great era where the winds and clouds will surge. I hope that the star Seizer sect can seize the initiative!”

“Yes!” Luo Qingfeng said solemnly,”I understand!” Please rest assured, master, this old servant is willing to do my best and will not disappoint master’s high hopes!”

Xia ruofei nodded and patted Luo Qingfeng’s shoulder, saying,””I believe you! Qingfeng, I’ll take my leave!”

Luo Qingfeng was slightly stunned and quickly said,””Master, you’ve just arrived at the sect. Why don’t you ... Stay here for a few days? This old servant is usually unable to serve you by your side ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”We’ll have plenty of time in the future. I still have some matters to attend to in the country. I won’t be staying in the star Seizer sect for long!”

“This ...” Luo Qingfeng said,”alright then! This old servant will see master off!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. The two of them went to the top floor of zhaixing tower. Then, they flew out of the window on their flying swords and went up to the roof.

Xia ruofei took out the black flying boat and landed on the deck of the flying boat. He waved at Luo Qingfeng and then controlled the flying boat to leave.

The most important thing for Xia ruofei’s return to the country was to test the effects of the wild tea. He was very satisfied with the results and was very excited.
