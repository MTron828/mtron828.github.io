Song Wei gently put down the magazine in her hand and brushed her hair behind her ear. She smiled and said, “You’re back?”

She didn’t look particularly surprised. From the beginning to the end, she was calm with a touch of joy, like a wife welcoming her husband back from a long journey. This calmed Xia ruofei’s heart.

Xia ruofei, who was still a little tipsy, nodded and said,””I’m back!”

“Why didn’t you tell me that you were coming? I could’ve rushed back!” He asked.

Song Wei raised her head slightly and said with a smile,”I didn’t have any plans this afternoon, so I came over! You’re definitely going home anyway, so why did I tell you in advance? I didn’t want to disturb you!”

“But I’ve been drinking with brother Zhao and song Rui the whole afternoon ...” Xia ruofei said with a trace of guilt.

“I smell it ...” Song Wei smiled and said,”you brothers haven’t seen each other for a long time. It’s nice to have a drink together!”

Then, Song Wei sniffed playfully and said,””But the smell of alcohol on you is a little strong! Hurry up and take a shower ...”

With that, she pushed Xia ruofei in the direction of the bathroom.

Xia ruofei was still puzzled in the bathroom.

Song Wei had always been a quiet person. To people who were not familiar with her, she might even look a little cold. However, in front of him, Song Wei was still a delicate young girl. Today, she was a little too virtuous!

After a quick shower, Xia ruofei put on a bathrobe and walked out of the bathroom while drying his hair.

……

After a long time, when the storm finally calmed down, it was already late at night.

“Thank you, ruofei!” Song Wei said softly.

“Why are you thanking me again for no reason?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Thank you!” Song Wei’s eyes were misty as she said,”even though I know this is very formal, I still can’t help but thank you after seeing you ... Ruofei, you must have put in a lot of effort to teach my father how to cultivate!”

Xia ruofei finally understood why Song Wei was so virtuous today.

He could not help but laugh,”silly girl!” Helping uncle song embark on the path of cultivation, didn’t we agree on this long ago? He’s your father, and now he has the physique to cultivate. Isn’t it right for me to help him take this step?”

“I’m just so touched!” Song Wei said coyly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Okay, okay ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but uncle song is still in the dark!” I still don’t know how to explain it to him in the future ...”

“My dad’s very opinionated, but that doesn’t mean he’s stubborn,” replied Song Wei with a smile. “Before he really takes that step, no matter how much we talk about it, we might not be able to move him and make him break the world view that he has formed over the years. However, when he has a certain level of cultivation and can truly feel the changes brought about by cultivation, it won’t be so difficult to persuade him. ”

Song Wei paused for a moment before she continued,”ruofei, don’t worry!” I’ll talk to him when the time comes!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s late. Weiwei, go to sleep!” I’ll train with you tomorrow!”

“En!” Song Wei nodded.

With a wave of his hand, Xia ruofei pressed a switch not far away with his spiritual power. The room fell into darkness. In a short while, the room was filled with the sound of their heavy breathing ...

For the following weekend, Xia ruofei and Song Wei were like hermits.

During the day, the two of them would cultivate in Xia ruofei’s house. Other than going to the backyard to eat, they would occasionally go out to the courtyard to get some fresh air, make tea, and chat. Most of the time, they would be immersed in cultivation and their own world.

After two days of cultivation, Song Wei’s cultivation had improved again. However, Xia ruofei’s benefits were not as obvious. There was a gap of several levels between his cultivation and Song Wei ‘s. If the two of them cultivated together, Song Wei would definitely benefit more, while Xia ruofei’s cultivation was not as effective as his own cultivation of the great Dao technique.

However, Xia ruofei was not too bothered by it. After all, he did not spend much time with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue. When they were together, he would seize the opportunity to help them improve their cultivation. He also had plenty of time to cultivate. Now that he had reached the ninth level of the Qi refining realm, it was not easy to break through to the next realm. Hence, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry.

On Monday morning, after having breakfast at the courtyard in liuhai Lane, Song Wei was ready to return to school.

Xia ruofei asked Wu Qiang to send Song Wei back in the Toyota Elfa. He went back to his house to make some preparations. Two to three days had passed. It was time for him to visit the Liu family. Based on old master Liu’s condition at that time, the medicine he used would only stabilize his condition for three to four days at most.

Besides, after two to three days of searching, the Liu family was probably feeling helpless. According to Xia ruofei’s estimation, they might not even be able to find a single medicinal herb on the list.

In fact, Xia ruofei had not thought of asking the Liu family for any benefits.

Of course, he didn’t need to think too much. As long as elder Liu woke up and understood the whole story, he would naturally give him a satisfactory offer.
