Chapter 708: A trace of gloominess (2)

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Qiao’ er, you did the right thing!”

Lin Qiao giggled,”brother ruofei, let’s not talk about these disappointing things. Now that the college entrance examination is over, I want to have some fun!” I’m going to stay at the farm for a few days!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I welcome you with both hands up! But you guys still need to estimate your scores and fill in your choices, right?”

“Brother ruofei, you’re out of date!” Lin Qiao said with a smile,”nowadays, the results are released after the application. The college entrance examination results will only be released at the end of the month at the latest. I guess it will be early July when the application is completed! We’ll be the ones estimating our own scores. The answers to the college entrance examination are all available online!”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said,”so you’re saying that you’ll be free from today until the beginning of July?”

“Correct!” Lin Qiao said,”brother ruofei, I remember that you have an orchard on your farm, right? When will the fruits ripen? I want to go and play picking!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” The cherries should be ripe soon, and as for the lychees ... It would be no later than the end of June! By then, you can eat as much as you want, and you can harvest and eat as you please!”

Lin Qiao showed an expectant look and agreed. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei casually asked,”Qiao’ er, your school and class should be organizing some group activities during this period of time, right?” What’s with the gathering?”

Xia ruofei was worried that Xue Fei was up to no good. That was why he was so concerned about Lin Qiao’s schedule.

As long as Lin Qiao didn’t leave his sight, Xue Fei would never succeed!

Lin Qiao thought for a while and said,”I guess we’ll have a gathering with our classmates.” After all, everyone wants to relax after the exam ...”

“Have you set the time?” Xia ruofei asked again.

......

Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei strangely and smiled,””No, I didn ‘t! The class Committee members should be able to organize it. We have a WeChat group, so it’s very easy to gather people!”

Then, Lin Qiao said with a smile,””Brother ruofei, why are you suddenly so concerned about my Affairs? Don’t tell me ... You’re interested in one of the girls in our class?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he said,”I don’t even know where the door to your class is. How am I supposed to meet the girls in your class?” Didn’t you say you were going to stay at the farm? I have to find out more about your schedule so that I can make arrangements in advance!”

“I’m fine! Changping County isn’t far from the city, so I’ll just come back when we have a gathering!” Lin Qiao said casually.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” If that’s the case ... Why don’t you and Auntie go to the farm tomorrow? I have an optical fiber network there too, so it doesn’t matter if you estimate your score or not. ”

“Good, good!” Lin Qiao said,”I haven’t been to the farm for a long time ...”

The last time Lin Qiao went to the farm was during the Chinese New Year. In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed. The last semester of the third year of high school was particularly intense, so Lin Qiao didn’t have time to come out and play. She spent almost every day in high – intensity revision.

The two of them chatted and the car soon arrived at the forestry Bureau’s residence where Hu Zi’s mother had rented.

After they got in the car, they went upstairs. Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared dinner. When she saw the two of them coming back, she quickly came up to take Lin Qiao’s bag and asked with concern,””Qiao’ er, how did you do?”

In the past two days, she was worried that she would bring pressure to Lin Qiao, so she didn’t dare to ask about the exam. Today, the exam was finally over, and she couldn’t wait to know how her daughter did.

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”mom, don’t worry!” This time, he did very well! There shouldn’t be a problem with the main points ...”

Hu Zi’s mother immediately let out a long sigh of relief and said, “That’s great ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Auntie!” I’ve discussed it with Qiao’ er on the way here. Now that her college entrance examination is over, you two might as well stay at my farm for a while! The environment there is good and the air is fresh!”

Hu Zi’s mother had been taking care of Lin Qiao for the past year. She was a full – time study companion and didn’t go out to work. She thought for a while and said,””Alright, then let’s go and stay there for a while! When Qiao’ er goes to University, I should go out and find something to do. ”

“Mom! You haven’t fully recovered yet!” Lin Qiao pouted and said,”your most important task now is to take care of your body. Don’t go out to work ...”

“I’ve been fine for a long time!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”after you go to college, I’ll be alone at home. If I don’t find something to do, I’ll be bored to death ...”

Lin Qiao smiled and said,”what if I’m studying at Sanshan?” I’ve been coming back every night to keep you company, I won’t be so bored that I’m sick, right?”

“Qiao’ er, didn’t you say you did well?” Xia ruofei asked,”then shouldn’t you apply to a better University?”

“It’s not like there aren’t any good universities in the three mountains. ” Lin Qiao said,”Sanshan University and Southeast Normal University both got 211! There were also a few 985 school! I think these schools are pretty good. They’re not bad and they’re close to home ...”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother said,”we’ll talk about it after your results are out!” Let’s eat!”

Hu Zi’s mother had specially prepared a sumptuous dinner. The three of them sat together happily, eating and chatting. The atmosphere was particularly harmonious.

After the meal, Xia ruofei chatted with the two of them for a while on the living room sofa. Then, he stood up and said,””Auntie, I’ll go back first. I’ll come and pick you up tomorrow morning!”
