During breakfast, Xia ruofei found out that Ling Qingxue had taken leave today and did not have to go to work the entire morning.

So after the two finished eating, they didn’t need to talk, just a look.

Xia ruofei’s phone, which he had casually thrown on the desk, rang.

Xia ruofei released his spiritual power and turned off the power on his phone. The disturbing ringing stopped abruptly. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

After the two of them took a hot bath, Xia ruofei wrapped himself in a bathrobe and walked to the desk. He picked up his phone and turned it on.

Soon, a string of text message notifications came from the phone.

There were many people who called him. Yingying’s match on Saturday had started at about 3 a.m. Chinese time on Sunday. By the time it ended, it was almost dawn. After a day of brewing, this matter had formed a huge impact on the internet. Xia ruofei had turned off his phone during the ten – hour flight. It was almost Monday, so all the calls for him were concentrated at this time.

Xia ruofei glanced around and saw that it was a call from his company’s director’s assistant, Qin Yanan, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, his friends, Tang Yitian in Australia, and Tang He in the United States he even saw the eldest son of the Liu family, Liu Qunfeng.

Xia ruofei naturally put Liu Qunfeng’s call as the last priority.

He muttered to himself for a moment before calling Qin Yanan back. Qin Yanan must be looking for him for work. He had already been free for more than half a month, and now that he was back at the three mountains, he naturally had to put work first.

Xia ruofei heard a ring on the other end and Qin Yanan quickly picked up.””Chairman, I hope I didn’t disturb you just now?”

Xia ruofei immediately knew that the call was from Qin Yanan. If it was someone else, he would have turned off his phone and would not have asked if it was a bother.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed and said,””I was just about to answer the phone! My phone ran out of battery, and I couldn’t find the charger ... Yanan, what’s the matter?”

Xia ruofei’s explanation was very reasonable. When the phone was ringing, he would press the power button for a long time. The effect was the same as pulling out the battery of old phones, so Qin Yanan naturally didn’t think too much about it.

“Chairman, I have a few things to report to you,” she said. The first thing is that the company received a fax official letter from the Chinese Football Association yesterday. They want to meet you, mainly to discuss the possibility of you joining the Chinese men’s football team in the future ...”

When she said this, Qin Yanan still had a strange feeling. When she saw the overwhelming news on the internet yesterday, she was really shocked. She didn’t expect her boss to have this skill. He was simply a superstar who was delayed by his business!

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Did they fax it over? Also, didn’t you make any phone calls?”

“I haven’t received any yet.” Qin Yanan said,”they directly fax it to the fax machine that our company announces to the public. That fax machine receives it automatically.” I’ve asked around, but I didn’t receive any calls. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shake his head.

The contact information that the Paradise company had announced to the public included the company’s fax number, phone number, and so on. These were all managed by professionals, and the Chinese Football Association only needed to go to the Paradise company’s official website to inquire about it.

In fact, they must have used this method to inquire, but they just sent a cold official letter. Were they waiting for the Paradise Corporation to contact them? He really did act like an official!

They were probably already used to this mode. As the boss of the industry, who would dare to not reply?

However, the Paradise Corporation was not a Football Club in the domestic league, and the Chinese Football Association had no jurisdiction over the Paradise Corporation. Why should they spoil their bad habits?

Xia ruofei said directly,”then let’s just pretend that this never happened!” If the other party calls, try to delay it. I won’t agree, but I won’t reject either. ”

Xia ruofei was more cautious about this matter. He knew that the domestic football circle was very deep. Besides, he could not reject it immediately. Otherwise, if he left evidence, he would be accused of “refusing to play for the country”. It would be a little disgusting.

Therefore, since the Chinese Football Association did not pay much attention, he would just play dumb at this stage.

Qin Yanan immediately understood and said,””I know what to do, Chairman. There was one more thing. Director Xue had received a request for instructions. Considering that they had just taken over the pharmaceutical Group, the equipment installation, debugging, and personnel training were currently being carried out in full swing. They felt that it was best to follow the principle of purchasing nearby raw materials and sign a supply and marketing contract with the surrounding villagers in advance. President Feng agreed to their proposal in principle and asked me to ask you for instructions. ”

“Didn’t Kanayama just fly back from Spain with us?”Xia ruofei laughed. How come you’ve already sent me a request for instructions?”

“It’s probably the other leaders of the pharmaceutical factory. This request was already sent to the company headquarters yesterday. You were still on the plane at the time!” Qin Yanan said with a smile.

Xia ruofei did not find this strange. Communication was so advanced now. Even if Xue Jinshan was overseas, it was easy to control remotely. Moreover, with Xue Jinshan’s personality, it was unrealistic to ask him to completely ignore his work while he was abroad for a week.
