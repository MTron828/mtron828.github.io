2233 The crisis of the Liu family (1)

Song Rui chuckled and said,”of course.” The entire Liu family is ...”

“Xiao Rui!” Zhao Yongjun suddenly interrupted song Rui,”don’t speak without thinking!”

Song Rui also came back to his senses. He was actually just a little drunk, and it just happened that they were talking about it, so he blurted it out. Once Zhao Yongjun reminded him, he immediately felt that it was inappropriate.

Although the people present today were not outsiders, there were still two employees from Xia ruofei’s company. Besides, even if they were people from their small circle, they could not say anything without restraint.

Just like Hou Liang and Wei Jun, their families were not that powerful yet. There were some things that could not be said in front of them. Otherwise, if word got out, it would have a negative impact on the song family.

Xia ruofei smiled and changed the topic.””Come on! Everyone, try this fish. It was very fresh when I bought it ...”

This dinner was a joyous one, and everyone was a little tipsy.

Zhao Yongjun and the others didn’t regard Xia ruofei as an outsider, so they stayed in the courtyard house since there were many rooms here anyway.

Zhuo Yiyi went to the front yard to keep Qin Yanan and he Yu company, while Zhao Yongjun and the others went to the middle yard to find a few guest rooms.

After Xia ruofei returned to the master suite, he sat on the sofa in the living room and smoked a cigarette. Then, he stood up to wash up.

Just then, there was a light knock on the door. Xia ruofei looked up and saw Zhao Yongjun and song Rui pushing the door open and walking in side by side.

“Brother Zhao, you haven’t gone to rest?” Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.

“I can’t sleep, so I came over to chat with you!” Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,”I ran into Xiao Rui the moment I went out!”

“Hahaha! Then come over and sit!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it just so happens that this tea has just been brewed. Let’s drink some tea to help with the alcohol!”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun and song Rui walked over and took their seats.

Xia ruofei leaned over and poured tea for the two of them. Then, he smiled at them.

Zhao Yongjun laughed.”Xiao Rui almost let it slip when we were eating. It’s about the Liu family’s elder.”

“Hehe ...” Song Rui scratched his head and said,”I’m a little loose – lipped after drinking, hehe ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t worry, brother Zhao. Don’t you know what kind of person I am?” I won’t go out and talk about it. Qin Yanan and he Yu, they don’t know anything about the circle in Beijing, and they don’t know anything about the Liu and Zhao families. I’ll talk to them later, and they’ll definitely keep their mouths shut. ”

“You’re mistaken, ruofei,” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.”It’s not appropriate to talk about this at the table. After all, there are too many people, so I stopped Xiao Rui in time. But you’re different. Is there anything I can’t tell you?”

Xia ruofei finally understood Zhao Yongjun’s intention. He was worried that he would be unhappy, so he came over to explain!

He smiled.”Brother Zhao, I’m not interested in these things. I’m just listening to it for fun. I don’t care.”

“I can’t not care!” Song Rui said,”Speaking of which, this matter has something to do with you!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile.””Related to me? Other than having some disputes with their good – for – nothing grandson, I don’t have any dealings with the Liu family at all! I’ve never even seen old man Liu before. He can’t blame me for his illness, can he?”

In fact, Xia ruofei had a history with the two “good – for – nothing” grandsons of the Liu family. They had even had a direct confrontation. However, the impact of him dealing with Liu haojun was too great, so he could not even tell Zhao Yongjun and the others.

Of course, this was also for their own good. Not knowing was the best situation for them.

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”look at you!” Ruofei, this is the general situation ...”

Then, Zhao Yongjun told Xia ruofei about the Liu family.

It turned out that the old man of the Liu family used to be quite strong, but the younger generation had been disappointing recently. They had been facing problems one after another, especially Liu haojun, whom he had high hopes for. His career was basically ruined because of such a stupid problem.

It was said that when he heard the news of Liu haojun’s accident, old master Liu shut himself in for three days and his entire person looked dejected.

It was normal for an old man to have a weak body, but old man Liu’s condition was different. The routine physical examination not long ago had found that his body was not just aging.

During the physical examination, they discovered that there were a few abnormalities in his physical indicators. After further examination, they discovered that it was actually pancreatic cancer, which was the most dangerous disease!

This was undoubtedly a bolt out of the blue for the Liu family.

Pancreatic cancer, and it was even in the late stage. This was basically a countdown to his life. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Even if it was one of the largest families in China, it could not escape the laws of nature.

Not to mention in China, even in the world, there was no treatment for such a highly malignant cancer. It was difficult to even delay the symptoms.

It could be said that old man Liu didn’t have much time left after the disease was discovered, and the process would be very fast.

Xia ruofei was still a little confused. He said,””I understand a little, but ... This doesn’t seem to have anything to do with me!”
