However, if Tang Yitian’s elder could even predict this, Xia ruofei would never believe it.

Of course, even if he didn’t believe it, Xia ruofei wasn’t so bored as to convince Tang Yitian to accept his point of view. So, he just smiled and changed the topic.

The two of them sat and chatted for a while. Soon, it was midnight in China.

Tang Yitian knew that Xia ruofei had consumed a lot of energy to save Tang Haoran, so he didn’t dare to disturb her for too long. He got up and returned to business class.

Xia ruofei called the flight attendants over to help him and Lin Qiao’s seats become a soft single bed. Then, he asked them to bring two blankets over.

After the flight attendant made the bed, Xia ruofei called Lin Qiao, who was in the middle of a conversation, back to her seat to rest.

On the other side, little Haoran had already fallen asleep in Jennifer’s arms.

Lin Qiao said hello to Jennifer reluctantly before returning to her seat and lying down.

Xia ruofei wrapped himself in a blanket and a shirt. He had used up a lot of his energy today and was extremely tired. He soon fell asleep with the faint sound of the plane’s engine.

Before Xia ruofei fell asleep, he could still hear Lin Qiao tossing and turning in bed across the aisle.

Obviously, everything that happened today made Lin Qiao so excited that she couldn’t fall asleep for a while.

When Xia ruofei woke up the next morning, he saw that Lin Qiao was still sleeping soundly in the blanket.

Xia ruofei didn’t disturb Lin Qiao. He got up quietly and stretched his body in the aisle. Then, he took out his bag and went to the first – Class washroom to brush his teeth, wash his face, and shave.

After cleaning up, Xia ruofei walked out in high spirits. After a night’s sleep, he had recovered most of the spiritual energy he had used up yesterday.

At this time, he found that Lin Qiao had also woken up. She was sitting on her seat and rubbing her sleepy eyes.

“Qiao’ er, go and wash up first!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”have some breakfast later. The plane will land soon ...”

“Oh, I know ...” Lin Qiao said with a trace of sleepiness.

Just as Lin Qiao went to wash up, Xia ruofei saw that Jennifer and little Haoran had also woken up. Xia ruofei smiled and greeted them.

“Good Morning, brother!” Little Haoran politely greeted Xia ruofei and looked at him with a more intimate gaze.

“Good Morning, Haoran!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”how was your sleep?”

“I slept very comfortably! I didn’t dream of those flaming monsters chasing me last night ...”Little Haoran said.” Mom said it was all because brother helped me yesterday. Brother is so powerful!” You can even defeat those flaming monsters!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, and then he couldn’t help but laugh. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Haoran,” he said,”those monsters are only temporarily hiding. I’ll help you heal again and drive those monsters far away, okay?”

“Good, good!” Little Haoran said happily,”thank you, brother!”

Xia ruofei continued,”I might feel a little uncomfortable when I’m chasing the monsters away for you. You have to hang in there and don’t move. Can you do it?”

“Sure!” Little Haoran raised his little face and said,”I’m so brave! She never cries when she gets an injection!”

Jennifer, who was next to him, could not help but smile when she heard that, but her eyes were a little wet. She was thinking of the suffering that Haoran had suffered from since he was a child, which might be unbearable for adults.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, then come to big brother’s side!” Big brother will help you fight the monsters!”

At this time, Tang Yitian walked over from the business class. He was surprised to hear this and asked,””Mr. Xia, are you going to give Haoran a second treatment now?”
