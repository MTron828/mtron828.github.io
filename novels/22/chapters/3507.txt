  He wanted to visit song Qiming to see how his cultivation was going. However, he thought that Song Wei would be back after she was done with her school matters. Hence, he decided to visit her only after she was back.

  In the afternoon, Xia ruofei drove the eye - catching Knight XV off - Road car out of the villa district. As soon as he reached the entrance, he saw the black Mercedes - Benz that Zheng Yi had driven in the morning. Zheng Yi and Zheng Yongshou were waiting by the side of the road.

  Zheng Yi had obviously done his homework in advance and knew that the Knight XV was Xia ruofei's car. He pulled Zheng Yongshou and said,""Mr. Zheng, President Xia is here!"

  The two of them quickly came forward.

  Xia ruofei stopped the car slowly, rolled down the window and said,""Elder Zheng, get in the car!"

  Then, he smiled at Zheng Yi and said,"thank you for your hard work!" President Zheng!"

  "You're welcome!"Zheng Yi quickly replied. This is my job! President Xia, do I still have to pick Mr. Zheng up from here?"

  "There's no need to. Elder Zheng can go back by himself!"Xia ruofei said after a moment of silence.

  He had to go to the company, the pharmaceutical factory, the farm, and many other places today. He might not even be able to finish it in an afternoon, and the time was not accurate. In addition, Zheng Yongshou should also train his basic life skills. He didn't expect him to immediately learn how to book an online taxi or something, but at least it shouldn't be difficult to learn how to hail a taxi by the side of the road and pay for the fare with cash.

  "Then ... Alright!" Zheng Yi said,"call me if you need anything!"

  "Mm! If there's anything, I won't be polite with President Zheng. " Xia ruofei said with a smile. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

  He bade Zheng Yi goodbye and drove straight to paradise Corporation.

  Xia ruofei arrived at the peach blossom mansion with ease. The parking space reserved for the chairman was empty. After he parked the car, he took Zheng Yongshou to the elevator and went upstairs.

  The elevator door opened with a 'ding'. As soon as Xia ruofei stepped out, he saw Feng Jing standing at the elevator door, looking at him with a faint smile.

  Xia ruofei was not surprised by Feng Jing's timely appearance. His Knight XV SUV was too eye - catching. Everyone in the company knew about this car. As soon as he entered the company, the security guard would definitely call the president's office.

  This time, he had disappeared for two to three months. Xia ruofei felt a little and poured it into the teapot. Then, he said,"No hurry! Don't worry, I'll introduce you guys first!"

  This time, he had disappeared for two to three months. Xia ruofei felt a little apologetic. He laughed dryly and greeted,""Sister che, long time no see ..."

  Feng Jing looked at Zheng Yongshou, who was half a body's length behind Xia ruofei. He didn't give Xia ruofei any face since there were outsiders.

  "Chairman, it's been a long time indeed ..." She said with a smile."I thought you'd forgotten you have a company!"

  "I was delayed by some personal matters ..." Xia ruofei laughed dryly and continued,""Let's go! Let's talk in my office!"

  After he finished speaking, he quickly walked towards the office. Zheng Yongshou naturally followed behind him. Feng Jing looked at Xia ruofei's back helplessly before quickly following him.

  Xia ruofei went straight to the reception area after entering the house. He skillfully set up the tea set, drew water, boiled water, and then found tea leaves from the tea cabinet at a constant temperature.

  "Chairman," Feng Jing couldn't help but say,"don't be in such a hurry to make tea. I still have a lot of work to report!"
