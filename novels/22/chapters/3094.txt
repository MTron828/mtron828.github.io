3095 Wild tea becomes (1)

The main purpose of this meeting was to study the back – end framework that Chen Xuan had spent three days building.

Of course, Tao Ran also introduced Chen Xuan to everyone. It had been three days since he started work, but Tao Ran had yet to properly introduce Chen Xuan to everyone. The people in the project team only knew that there was an intern in their team. Some of them didn’t even know Chen Xuan’s name. It was clear how low Chen Xuan’s presence was in the beginning.

However, all of this had become a thing of the past.

Tao Ran formally introduced Chen Xuan and told everyone that Chen Xuan was the one who came up with the back – end framework.

The way the programmers in the project team looked at Chen Xuan suddenly changed.

The world of a programmer was actually very simple. If your skills were good, then you were awesome. There was no need to be afraid at all.

If your code was well – written, with few or no bugs, the comments were never confusing, and there were no random twists and turns, then you were awesome, and others couldn’t be convinced.

Through the projection, Tao Ran first demonstrated the back – end framework to everyone. After analyzing the structure of the code, he introduced Chen Xuan.

With that, everyone’s impression of Chen Xuan was completely different.

And so, Chen Xuan was finally able to integrate into the team in an astonishing manner.

In the following days, Chen Xuan felt that his life was very fulfilling.

The project leader, Tao Ran, was very polite to him and had entrusted him with some relatively important work.

The other programmers in the group were even more respectful to him. Two of the younger programmers even called him “teacher Chen” and asked him questions from time to time.

Of course, Chen Xuan’s personality was as easy – going as ever. He didn’t look down on Qianqian just because he was skilled. In the secular world, status was nothing to him. Even in the world of cultivation, he was considered to have a prominent status. He was the young sect master of the first heaven society. Before Xia ruofei’s sudden appearance, he was still the youngest golden core stage cultivator in the world of cultivation. However, he was always polite to people. He would also not show his arrogance just because the other party’s cultivation was low or the sect’s strength was weak.

Coming to the secular world to train, Chen Xuan naturally wouldn’t put on airs.

His personality, coupled with his “non – mainstream programmer” looks, made him very popular in the project team from the beginning. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

With Chen Xuan’s help, the progress of the Tao Ran project team was much faster.

Even yang Xincheng praised Tao Ran many times during the middle management meeting in the development Department.

This was because their project team had the most important tasks, and it was easy to delay progress.

Previously, yang Xincheng had urged Tao Ran many times because the progress of the quest was a little slow.

But now, the situation had changed greatly, and their progress was even faster than the other project teams.

All of this was because of Chen Xuan.

After Yang Xincheng understood the situation, he even joked to Tao Ran,””Tao Ran, you didn’t seem too happy when I assigned Chen Xuan to your project team the other day! Do you think I’m a burden to you? Why don’t I transfer him to another group to help you reduce your burden?”

Tao Ran quickly waved his hand and said with a bitter smile,””Old leader, don’t laugh at me! This time, I failed to recognize Mount Tai ... No! He had eyes but didn’t recognize the great God! Chen Xuan, you can’t be transferred away! Otherwise, our project team will never be able to complete the task!”

“You brat, you’ve learned how to threaten your leader?” Yang Xincheng laughed and scolded.

“I wouldn’t dare ...” Tao Ran chuckled.”I’m just telling the truth! “At least 40% of our project team’s workload is completed by Chen Xuan. His efficiency is simply too high. Furthermore, his error rate is extremely low. In my memory, there has never been a bug in the code he produced ...”

“Now you know you’ve picked up a treasure!” Yang Xincheng chuckled.”Chen Xuan is ...”

“I know! I know!” Tao Ran quickly said,”you personally interviewed him! Chen Xuan is a horse that can travel a thousand li, and you are Bo Le!”

“Haha!” Yang Xincheng laughed and said,”Alright, alright! Don’t flatter me!”

……

The Paradise Mall project was progressing in an orderly manner according to the plan, and Chen Xuan was slowly gaining some fame in the company.

Even Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and the other company executives had heard that a young programmer had joined the development Department and that he was very skilled.

While Chen Xuan was training in the peach blossom company, Xia ruofei also spent a peaceful time on the island.

In addition to cultivating every day, he would also go around Paradise Island, including the guard Camp, the airport, and other places. When he had nothing to do, he would drive a boat to the nearby Sea area to play diving and fishing. His days were very pleasant.

Xia ruofei even felt that it would be pretty good if he retired now and continued to cultivate on Peach Blossom Island.

This kind of carefree life lasted for almost half a month.

In addition to the few days before, the two wild tea trees had actually grown for more than 100 years under the dual effects of the time array flags and the Archean realm.

Now, they had already grown into two big trees. The variety of wild tea was indeed strange. It was clearly a tea tree, but it could continue to grow, and could even grow into a towering tree.
