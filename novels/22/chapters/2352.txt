2353 The spirit of the Chinese (2)

When the old passenger plane accelerated, the cabin creaked as if it was shaking everywhere.

Especially after the plane took off from the ground, every time the flap was retracted, the sound of the flap could be clearly heard. The wings were constantly shaking in the process of flight, as if they would break at any time.

Recently, Xia ruofei had been traveling in Gulfstream business planes, which were much more comfortable than commercial planes. Now that he had changed to a small side passenger plane, it was like changing from a sports car to a tractor. He was not used to it.

He looked curiously at Daka and the passengers around him. He found that they all looked normal, as if there was nothing to be afraid of when flying in such a shaky way.

Xia ruofei was not afraid because he was confident. If the plane really fell, he could still hide in the spirit map space. Although it might be more troublesome in the end, at least his life would not be in danger.

However, were the ordinary passengers really not afraid at all?

Xia ruofei was curious and could not help but ask Wenda.

Daka grinned and said,”Xia, you’ll get used to it!” I have to take this plane at least once or twice a month, and sometimes three or four or even four or five times. It has been more than two years in a row. Do you think I will still be afraid? Most of the passengers on the plane are used to this route, so they’re used to it!”

“I see ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ve learned a lot!”

“You’re not nervous?” Dhaka was also a little curious. He smiled and said,”I remember that our company has a Chinese friend who took this plane for the first time. He was so scared that his face turned white and his hands and feet turned cold. After he landed, he swore that he would never take this kind of plane again. When he returned to China, he even crossed the border by car to Ethiopia and then took a train to Ethiopia.”

“Isn’t this a little too exaggerated?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m not nervous. I’m just not used to it!”

Fortunately, such bumpiness did not exist throughout the flight. When the plane rose to the cruising altitude, the degree of bumpiness suddenly reduced a lot. The stewardess even began to push a small cart out to serve Jian Jia. When Jian Jia took the domestic plane in the past, when she encountered such a degree of bumpiness, the stewardess would basically be asked to stop service, sit in her seat, fasten her seat belt, and wait for the plane to fly stably before continuing to serve.

Xia ruofei politely declined the in – Flight meal provided by the stewardess. He was not interested in the sticky local specialty “food”, especially when the sticky food was cooked and heated on the plane. It looked terrible and Xia ruofei had no appetite at all.

Daka, on the other hand, enjoyed the food very much. Seeing that Xia ruofei did not want to eat, he asked the stewardess to give Xia ruofei’s share to him and ate it with relish.

There was a strange smell in the cabin.

Xia ruofei did not know how to describe the smell of the food. To put it simply, it smelled like a mixture of curry and durian. One could imagine how touching the smell in the cabin was.

Xia ruofei even used his vital energy to temporarily seal his sense of smell.

It was not until most of the passengers had finished eating that the smell in the cabin became less intense.

Xia ruofei saw that Daka had finished his lunch and asked with a smile,””Daka, are there any fun places in arulei? Why don’t you introduce me to them?”

Xia ruofei had set his identity as a backpacker. Now that China’s economy had improved, more and more people were traveling abroad. There were many people like him who carried simple luggage and traveled to non – mainstream tourist spots.

Daka grinned and said,”brother, you’ve asked the right person!” I’m quite familiar with arulei!”

“Oh? Then can you recommend some fun places?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Let me think!” Daka raised his head and thought for a moment. Then, he said with a bitter smile,”arulei really doesn’t have many tourist resources. There aren’t many places to play. Speaking of interesting places ... The temple of arulei should be one. Although we locals don’t look like much, I think you’ll be interested. After all, you can appreciate a different culture from the East there. ”

“Arulei temple?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”a temple named after the country. I really have to go and take a look!”

“Arulei is a very small country. It’s not even as big as a province in China!” Said Daka, pouting. No... Even many Prefecture – Level cities were bigger than it! You’ll get used to it after seeing it for a while. For example, our destination this time is arulei city. This city is the capital of arulei and is also named after the country. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,’Daka’s spirit as a Chinese is really not an exaggeration. He always shows this kind of thinking inadvertently. The words’ our China ‘were said so naturally without any sense of disharmony.’

Along the way, Xia ruofei chatted with Dhaka from time to time and gained a better understanding of Dhaka and Aruray.

The Chinese company that Dhaka worked for was involved in road and bridge construction and had contracted many projects in arulei. There were several construction sites in the country that were working at the same time.

Of course, the so – called “nationwide” was actually not as big as a Prefecture – Level city in China.

In addition, arulei, the president of this country, was also a weirdo. He had issued many ridiculous laws, such as “no farting in public” and so on. The regulations were very detailed. If farting was not discovered, it was not considered illegal. However, if they were discovered and reported, they might even face jail time.

In addition, the president had also given him many titles, such as the commander – in – chief of the arulei Republic’s armed forces, the arulei Navy honorary Admiral, and so on. In fact, arulei’s armed forces were very weak, and as a small, purely inland country, it did not have a Navy at all.

Even a mercenary group like mord could become the local tyrant of arulei. One could only imagine how backward the armed forces of this country were.

With the spirited Chinese, Dhaka, sitting beside him, Xia ruofei’s journey was not so boring. He felt that the flight time seemed to have passed faster, and soon, the plane began to lower its altitude.

The crazy jolts started to appear again.

Xia ruofei and Daka put on their seat belts and calmly waited for the plane to land. Da ka saw that Xia ruofei’s expression was so relaxed. He could tell that he was really calm and was not pretending. He could not help but give Xia ruofei a thumbs up.

Although the plane was shaky, the pilot’s skills seemed to be good.

Today, the crosswind at arulei airport was quite strong. The side flight was relatively small, so landing in the crosswind was a test of skill. When it finally landed, the plane was almost perpendicular to the runway. This was using an angle to offset the influence of the crosswind.

After the rear landing gear touched the ground, the pilot adjusted himself. When the front landing gear also touched the ground, the plane was also adjusted to the center of the runway.

After getting off the plane, Xia ruofei put a US dollar in his passport as usual and quickly passed through the customs.

Daka worked here and often entered and exited the country, so he was naturally faster than Xia ruofei.

When Xia ruofei walked out of the restricted area, he saw that Daka was already waiting for him at the exit with his luggage.

“Brother, do you need me to be your guide?” Daka asked enthusiastically. It’s free of charge!”

Since Xia ruofei was going to cause trouble for the modr organization, he naturally could not bring Dhaka along. He smiled and said,””I want to walk around alone first. Don’t you have to go back to report? I’ll contact you again in two days!”

Daka smiled and nodded,”no problem!” We’ll keep in touch on WeChat!”

The two of them had already added each other on WeChat at the airport.

Of course, Xia ruofei was using a new WeChat account. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The two of them walked out of the airport Hall and waved goodbye. They got into a taxi and headed toward the city.
