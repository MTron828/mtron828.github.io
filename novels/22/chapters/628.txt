Chapter 629: The brat is finally gone (2)

Xia ruofei laughed bitterly and could only nod helplessly. Then, he started to comb Huanhuan’s hair clumsily.

As a result, the image of Huanhuan in the mirror began to change frequently. One moment, two braids appeared on her head, like Nezha in a little dress. The next moment, she had two ponytails, but it didn’t seem to be symmetrical. Moreover, several strands of her hair fell out, making her look like a village girl ...

In the end, the exhausted Xia ruofei gave up and took out his phone to call Feng Jing.

“President Feng ...” Xia ruofei said weakly,”can you come to my villa?” It’s an emergency ...”

“What’s the matter, Chairman?”Feng Jing asked warily. Let me make this clear! I don’t have any experience in taking care of children ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”don’t worry!” It shouldn’t be difficult for you, I just need you to help Huanhuan comb her hair. You know how to do that, right?”

Combing hair? Feng Rao thought for a while and said hesitantly,”This ... I think so ...”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll wait for you! Please hurry up ...”

Feng Rao could imagine Xia ruofei’s embarrassed look. She smiled and said,””Got it. Do you want me to drive over?”

“I don’t mind even if you fly the plane here, just be faster!” Xia ruofei said.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei said to Huanhuan,””The pretty sister from yesterday will help you comb your hair. Huanhuan, take a rest!”

With that, Xia ruofei collapsed on the small sofa.

Feng Jing soon arrived at the villa. With her help, she finally finished combing her hair. The little princess, who cared a lot about her image, was finally willing to go out. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

......

Xia ruofei thanked Feng Jing profusely and brought little Huanhuan to the staff canteen in the complex for breakfast.

The company started work at nineo’ clock, and it was time for the employees to have their meals. When Huanhuan, who looked like a little porcelain doll, arrived at the cafeteria, it immediately caused a small commotion. In particular, the head assistant Liu Qian and a few other young girls, who loved the little princess so much, surrounded her one after another.

Little Huanhuan was extremely calm. When Cao tieshu’s wife brought her breakfast, she even expressed her thanks very politely, just like a little adult.

The princesses of the rich and powerful had received an aristocratic education. When facing strangers, they were still very appropriate to deal with.

Liu Qian and the rest were quickly chased upstairs by Feng Rao to work. After Huanhuan had her breakfast, Xia ruofei brought her to the farm for a walk. They drove the security guards ‘electric car directly. Huanhuan had a lot of fun and could not stop laughing along the way.

When he arrived at the orchard in the back of the mountain, neither the lychees nor the blueberries were ripe yet. The little guy walked around for a while and then went down the mountain in a depressed mood. If he wanted to play with picking, he had to wait until summer.

Back in the villa, Huanhuan was having a lot of fun with lightning again. The whole yard was filled with her happy laughter.

Then, Huanhuan saw two super Blood Dragons as she had wished. In the little girl’s eyes, everything on the farm was so fresh that it was too much for her to take in.

Xia ruofei didn’t do anything and just played with Huanhuan.

It was almost noon, and Huanhuan was a little tired. She curled up on the sofa in the living room and ate potato chips while watching a cartoon on TV.

There was the sound of a car in the courtyard, and two honks.

Xia ruofei stood up and went out to take a look. It was Lu You’s BMW MINI. Xia ruofei quickly opened the door and turned back to say,””Huanhuan, quickly get up! Your sister Lu You is here to pick you up ...”

At this moment, the people in the car had already gotten out. As expected, it was Lu You and Tian Huixin.

Lu You seemed to have specially dressed up today. A pair of tight black leather pants outlined the curves of her tight and slender legs. She wore a long black trench coat and a tight – fitting beige knitted shirt. Similarly, her curves were also exposed, and her figure was very attractive.

She saw that Xia ruofei’s face seemed to be slightly red as he walked out of the door. Then, he stuck his head in and looked inside. He pretended to be relaxed and asked,””Xia ruofei, where’s Huanhuan?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”he’s inside!” Aunt Huixin, Lu You, come in!”

Xia ruofei brought Tian Huixin and Lu You into the villa. Only then did Huan Huan start to put on her shoes slowly. When she saw her mother and cousin, she called out,””Mother! Sister Youyou!”

“Huanhuan, you heartless little thing!” Lu youyan said angrily. You’ve just arrived at the three mountains and you’re already standing me up! Hmph, I was even waiting for you at home yesterday! And you actually came straight to the farm ...”

Huan Huan ran over and hugged Lu You. She said,””Sister Youyou, don’t be angry! Huanhuan missed you too ...”

“But you miss brother ruofei more, don’t you?” Lu You asked.

Huan Huan smiled in embarrassment and didn’t answer Lu You’s question. However, the answer was obvious.

“No, I’m angry!” Lu You shouted,”quick, give me a kiss!”

Huan Huan chuckled and kissed Lu You’s fragile face. Lu You then turned her displeasure into joy and carried Huan Huan.

“Huanhuan, did you behave yourself when you slept last night?” Tian Huixin asked.

“Of course I’m obedient! I promised mom and brother ruofei!” Huan Huan raised her head and said.

Tian Huixin didn’t really believe Huan Huan’s words. She smiled and asked,””Xia, did Huanhuan cause you any trouble yesterday? This little ancestor is really good at tormenting people ...”
