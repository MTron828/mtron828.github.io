This time, Xia ruofei‚Äôs first thought was that the spirit body‚Äôs speed had slowed down.

Although it was still extremely fast compared to ordinary people or cultivators, Xia ruofei could see its movement. It was no longer as impossible to guard against as it was last time. At that time, the spirit was still occupying Song Wei‚Äôs body, but it was so fast that Xia ruofei felt that she was teleporting.

Of course, it wasn‚Äôt because the spirit body had slowed down. It was because Xia ruofei‚Äôs reaction speed and overall strength had increased by more than one level. Thus, in comparison, he felt that the spirit body was slower.

Xia ruofei could see clearly that the spirit body‚Äôs movement was very erratic, making it difficult to predict its path.

In the blink of an eye, the spirit body had arrived in front of the three of them.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei finally reacted. However, with their speed and strength, they couldn‚Äôt Dodge at such a close distance.

In fact, they were much stronger than Xia ruofei when he first entered the stone room.

It was just that neither of them had any actual combat experience, so when a strong enemy was in front of them, they immediately became flustered.

The last time Xia ruofei encountered the spirit in this stone room, the strongest and most direct feeling he had was that it was extremely fast. Xia ruofei did not even have time to react. Even if his brain could react, his body could not keep up.

And that was when the spirit body had already taken over Song Wei‚Äôs body. In fact, because it had not completely taken over her body, its speed and strength were affected to a certain extent. It was definitely not as fast as when it was a pure spirit body.

Even so, Xia ruofei could only make use of the time formation flag to make up for the difference in speed by using the difference in the flow of time inside and outside the formation.

However, the spirit body managed to break the seal very quickly. It made use of Song Wei‚Äôs body to make Xia ruofei cautious and approach the time formation step by step.

This time, the other party was in the state of a pure spirit body, and his speed was a bit faster than the last time.

However, Xia ruofei was no longer the ignorant fool he was back then.

Before he entered the stone room, he was already on full alert. As soon as the spirit body appeared from the corner, he noticed it immediately.
