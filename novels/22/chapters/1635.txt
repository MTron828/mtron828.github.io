Chapter 1636: The powerful Yin formation (1)

Wu Qiang’s body had always been strong, but at this moment, he also shuddered.

The cold didn’t seem to be just a physical feeling, but a chill from the heart.

Moreover, the two of them could clearly feel that this piece of land seemed to have become somewhat different. Although they couldn’t tell what was different, it made them feel very uncomfortable.

Originally, although this piece of land was barren, it did not give off such a gloomy feeling.

Zhao Yongjun hesitantly listened and asked,””Wu Qiang, do you feel anything different? Isn’t it too quiet?”

It was already very quiet in the middle of the night, but after that moment, Zhao Yongjun clearly felt that the silence made him panic.

Wu Qiang listened carefully and said,”Old platoon leader, it seems like the chirping of the insects has disappeared ...”

“Were there any insects chirping just now?” Zhao Yongjun was a little uncertain.”There shouldn’t be any insects in this season, right?”

“There are!” “Yes.” Wu Qiang said with certainty,”I must have heard the chirping of insects earlier, but now, it’s dead silent ...”

On the battlefield, the sudden disappearance of the chirping of insects or the sudden flight of the night birds was something to be careful of. It could mean that some danger was approaching.

Therefore, Wu Qiang was also very sensitive in this aspect. In comparison, Zhao Yongjun, who had been in the Army with the mentality of muddling through his days and had transferred to another job after a few years, was much slower.

After Zhao Yongjun heard Wu Qiang’s words, he couldn’t help but feel nervous. He said,””Qiangzi, how about ... We wait in the car? It’s pretty cold here ...”

“Old platoon leader, why don’t you get in the car and warm yourself up for a while?” Wu Qiang said. I’ll be on guard here!”

The boss had not returned yet, so Wu Qiang naturally would not sit in the car and wait. That would be too insensible. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Zhao Yongjun hesitated and said,””I’ll go with you! Damn it, if I wasn’t afraid of being exposed, I really want to start a fire to roast it! By the way, can you use the walkie – talkie to ask RUO Fei how he’s doing?”

“This ... Old platoon leader, why don’t we just wait!” Wu Qiang hesitated.”What if boss is busy? I’m afraid I’ll disturb him ...”

Since Xia ruofei did not contact Wu Qiang, he could not ask. Otherwise, he would be suspected of urging him. After all, he was not Zhao Yongjun. His relationship with Xia ruofei was that of a boss and subordinate.

Zhao Yongjun wanted to ask through the walkie – talkie, but after hearing Wu Qiang’s words, he could only helplessly say,””Alright, then let’s wait!”

......

In fact, the nine points that Wu Qiang and Zhao Yongjun had set up were equivalent to the foundation of the formation, and the position where the downhill Tiger Jade statue was located was where the formation eye of the nine rotation formation was.

Of course, this was the formation eye of the yin formation. In the future, if Xia ruofei wanted to change the situation and change it to a yang formation, the position of the formation eye would change again.

After Zhao Yongjun and Wu Qiang set up the array base, they left far away. When they reached the place where they parked the car, they could still feel the cold.

One could only imagine what kind of terrifying scene song Rui, who was at the core of the formation and had personally pressed the Jade statue to activate the formation, would face the moment the formation was activated.

The eye of the array was the core of the entire array, and it was the second half of the night, the time when the yin Qi was the strongest.

In fact, the moment song Rui pressed down on the Jade carving, it was as if he had been frozen. Even his eyes were fixed and his body was completely stiff.

At first, he felt a bone – chilling Cold Rush into his body, and then a terrifying scene appeared in front of him.

In his eyes, the world had turned blood red. There were mountains of corpses and seas of blood. One by one, ferocious Devils pounced on him.

Song Rui screamed subconsciously, but he found that he couldn’t make a sound at all, and his body seemed to be out of his control. He wanted to escape, but he couldn’t move at all. He could only watch as the terrifying demons approached him with a sinister smile.

Some of these demons had blood in their eyes and pale faces. Some of them had their eyes gouged out, leaving only two black holes. Some of them were gnawing on their limbs as they walked; Some had hemp ropes around their necks, and their tongues were stretched out ...

In fact, song Rui didn’t know that these were the scariest images in his subconscious. Some of them were made up in horror novels, and some were directly from horror movies he had seen.

Because at this moment, his mind was completely out of control. All of this seemed extremely real to him, and he would never have thought that it was all an illusion.

Just as song Rui was about to give up all hope, a hand suddenly pulled him. Then, a warm current flowed into his body, and he suddenly felt that he had regained his ability to move.

Song Rui hurriedly rolled and crawled away, trying to escape, but Xia ruofei held him back.

In the midst of the panic, song Rui shouted,”ruofei, run!” Quickly run! There are so many ghosts ...”

Xia ruofei covered song Rui’s mouth and said,””Stop screaming! Look carefully, where is the ghost?”

The core area of the formation was filled with the most Yin Qi. However, it had no effect on Xia ruofei and he could not lose his mind.

Moreover, after Xia ruofei transferred some vital energy to song Rui, the cold feeling disappeared.
