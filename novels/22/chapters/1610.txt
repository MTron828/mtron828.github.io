Chapter 1611: Siheyuan’s night talk Part 1

The two of them were in first class. Song Wei refunded her original economy class ticket and booked two new tickets.

A few days ago in Ruizhou, Song Wei had earned three to four hundred thousand Yuan from stone gambling under Xia ruofei’s guidance. Naturally, she did not lack the money for the plane ticket.

Besides, Song Wei was overjoyed to be able to go to Beijing with Xia ruofei. What was two first – Class tickets to her?

More than two hours later, the vacant plane they were on landed smoothly in the capital city, where night had just fallen.

After the plane stabilized in the parking space in front of the terminal, the door opened quickly. Xia ruofei and Song Wei walked into the terminal along the covered bridge.

The temperature in the plane was comfortable. After getting off the plane, Song Wei felt the chill. However, she had put her thick coat in the check – in suitcase. The temperature in Beijing was much colder than in Sanshan. The clothes she wore in Sanshan were very thin in Beijing.

Song Wei couldn’t help but shrink her body. At this moment, Xia ruofei took the coat from his hand and put it on Song Wei.

Song Wei suddenly felt a burst of warmth. She turned around and smiled at Xia ruofei. Her watery eyes were filled with joy.

“Thank you!” Song Wei said sweetly.

“Just put it on! Don’t catch a cold!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“En!” Song Wei nodded her head.

Then she stopped, put her gloves in her sleeves, and put on her coat before continuing to walk with her simple luggage.

Xia ruofei’s clothes were naturally very loose on Song Wei, but it also gave her a different kind of charm. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

They took the escalator to the first floor. Xia ruofei accompanied Song Wei to the luggage wheel in the lobby to get her checked – in luggage. Then, he helped her to move her luggage onto a small cart and walked out of the airport departure hall.

“RUO Fei!”

“Weiwei!”

The two voices rang out at the same time. Xia ruofei and Song Wei were stunned. They stopped in their tracks and looked towards the source of the voice. They were dumbfounded.

Originally, Xia ruofei had only informed Wu Qiang to pick them up. However, not only Wu Qiang was standing at the exit, but Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and Zhuo Yiyi were also there.

In addition, Liu Jian, Xu Zixuan, Hou Liang, Wei Jun Qianqian, and the other scoundrels who had agreed to cooperate to set up the club had all arrived at the airport.

It was song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi who had made that sound.

“What’s the situation?” Xia ruofei mumbled.

Song Rui walked up to him and punched Xia ruofei’s shoulder lightly. He smiled and said,””What are you waiting for? Can’t you see that we’ve come to welcome you in such a grand manner? Aren’t you touched?”

“Aren’t you guys making a big scene?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”I’m a little overwhelmed by your favor!”

“Hey ... How did you know that I was on this flight?” Xia ruofei continued.

Song Rui replied lazily,”isn’t that simple?” If you want to go back to the capital, don’t you need to let Wu Qiang pick you up? Brother Zhao, why don’t you ask Wu Qiang? He wouldn’t dare to hide anything from the old platoon leader, would he?”

At the side, Wu Qiang’s face was full of embarrassment. He was also a little uneasy in his heart, afraid that his boss would be unhappy because of this.

Naturally, Xia ruofei would not blame Wu Qiang for such a small matter. He smiled and nodded his head, then walked over to greet everyone.

Zhuo Yiyi’s gaze was meaningful. She looked at Song Wei and then at Xia ruofei before saying,””Wei Wei, your clothes look like ...”

Only then did Song Wei realize that she was still wearing Xia ruofei’s clothes. She immediately blushed. After Zhuo Yiyi’s reminder, everyone’s eyes were on her. She couldn’t take them off now either. It seemed like she was trying to hide something, but she felt uncomfortable wearing them. She didn’t know how awkward it was.

Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”who knew it would be so cold in the capital!” When I got off the plane, I saw that Song Wei was already shivering from the cold. Of course, I had to show off my style!”

“How gentlemanly!” Zhuo Yiyi giggled and gave Xia ruofei a big thumbs up. However, from her expression, it was obvious that she did not believe him so easily.

Seeing this, song Rui laughed and said,””It’s so cold out here, so stop talking! Get in the car first! We’ve prepared a lot of food at the courtyard in liuhai Lane to welcome you!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,””Why do I feel like something is wrong? I seem to be the owner of the courtyard house! What does it have to do with you?”

Zhao Yongjun and the others burst into laughter.

Song Rui said casually,”there’s no point in saying that!” Who are we brothers with? Besides, I’m only using your venue! We were the ones who bought it!”

Zhao Yongjun also laughed and said,”ruofei, don’t mind these details!” We brothers haven’t seen each other for a long time, let’s have a good drink today!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

A group of people surrounded Xia ruofei as they walked to the parking lot.

Zhao Yongjun and the others drove three cars. Song Rui and Zhuo Yiyi were in one car, so Zhuo Yiyi naturally pulled Song Wei along with her.

Although Song Wei really wanted to sit in the same car as Xia ruofei, she was too embarrassed to show it. After all, Zhuo Yiyi was her four – year classmate and best friend. If she were to sit in the same car as Xia ruofei at this time, wouldn’t it be even more abnormal?

Xia ruofei got into the land Rover that he had bought for the capital.

Four cars drove out of Beijing airport in a single file and headed toward the liuhai Lane courtyard house in the city center.
