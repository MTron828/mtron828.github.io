“Uncle Fu?” Xia ruofei was also a little stunned. The villager in front of him looked to be at least 60 years old. If li Zhifu was the “uncle Fu” he mentioned, how old was he? At this time, eccentric song also walked up and said,””Fellow townsman, if the ‘uncle Fu’ you mentioned used to live in that house, then he should be the person we’re looking for. May I ask if you know his current situation?” “Uncle Fu moved away eight years ago,” the villager said,”I heard that he’s getting old and his daughter took him away for retirement ...” Eccentric song revealed a trace of joy and said,”So, brother Fu should still be healthy?” Xia ruofei was shocked again. It seemed that li Zhifu was not young anymore. Even elder song called him “brother Fu”. Elder song was already in his 80s. “I’m not too sure about that. ” The villager said,”but he was still quite strong before he moved away. He could even go up the mountain to pick tea himself!” Eccentric song’s expression was somewhat excited as he asked,”Fellow townsman, do you know where brother Fu’s daughter lives?” The villager scratched his head.”I’m not too sure about that. I remember that before uncle Fu moved away, his daughter would often come to visit him. I don’t think he married out of town, but I really don’t know where he lives.” “Oh ... Then do you know if brother Fu has any relatives in the village?” Elder song asked. “I don’t think so!” “I’ve never heard of uncle Fu having any other relatives in the village ...” The villager said with uncertainty. “I see ...” Elder song said disappointedly,”thank you, my fellow townsman!” “You’re welcome!” The villager asked,”by the way, are you also here to ask uncle Fu to make tea? I think there was a group of people from the city who came to the village to look for him some time ago ...” “Making tea?” Elder song was stunned for a moment, then he muttered to himself,”brother Fu’s tea – making skills were really good back then! Was he that famous now? Even the people outside came to look for him ...” “Uncle Fu’s tea – making skills are well – known in the surrounding villages, especially in his control of the heat of the baking process,” the villager said. “You can say that no one in the entire Mount Wuyi is better than him.” The tea that he baked himself would at least double his net worth! But uncle Fu hasn’t made tea for many years. If you’re here to ask uncle Fu to make tea, you should go back! Even if we do find him, he won’t do anything. ” “Why?” eccentric song asked, puzzled. “I’m not sure about that. Uncle Fu stopped making tea for people about ten years ago. At first, many bosses came to ask him to come out of retirement, but he refused no matter how much money they offered. Gradually, people stopped coming. ” The villager said. “Oh ... I see. Thank you, fellow townsman!” Elder song said. The villager carried his hoe and left. Eccentric song frowned slightly, deep in thought. “Chief, why don’t we ask around in the village?” Xia ruofei asked. Maybe someone knows where Mr. Li Zhifu’s daughter lives!” “I guess this is the only way.” Eccentric song sighed. Xia ruofei remembered that there were many people sitting at the entrance of the village and chatting. Most of them were elderly people, so he walked towards the entrance with elder song. After asking, there was really an old lady in her 60s who knew the general situation. It turned out that li Zhifu’s daughter had not been married yet when the old lady had just married into xiankeng village. The two were good friends. According to the old lady, li Zhifu’s daughter, Li Guizhi, was married to yangdun town, which was 30 kilometers away. She didn’t know the exact address, but Li Guizhi mentioned that her family opened an electrical repair shop in the town when she returned to her mother’s house. However, this news was from eight years ago. After li Zhifu moved to his daughter’s house, everyone lost contact. Even though the information was vague, it was very useful to elder song. He kindly expressed his gratitude to the old lady. Although the villagers did not know elder song’s identity, everyone could feel elder song’s superior bearing, so the old lady was very polite. Elder song smiled and nodded at the villagers. Then, he left with Xia ruofei. The villagers were still talking about these two strangers with extraordinary bearings. They would never have dreamed that the silver – haired old man was actually a famous legendary General Star in China, one of the core members of the leadership. “Xiao Xia, you must be very curious as to how I know an old man from this remote mountain village, right?” Elder song said with a smile. “I’m indeed curious. ” Xia ruofei said,”but I’m guessing it has something to do with the troops you left behind to exterminate the bandits!” “We were stationed in this small pit village back then,” said elder song with a nod. “I also lived in brother Fu’s house.” After Xiaodong’s death, I’ve been in a very low mood. Coupled with the humidity in the mountains, I had a high fever within two days, and it didn’t go down even after two days ...” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows. He knew how dangerous it was to have a high fever in such a remote mountain village. Elder song continued,”it was brother Fu who risked being attacked by bandits to gather herbs in the mountains. In order to avoid the bandits, he almost fell off the cliff. It was very dangerous. If he wasn’t caught by a Crooked Tree, he would have lost his life. Even so, he still broke an arm.” As he walked, eccentric song revealed a nostalgic expression and continued,”It was these herbs that brother Fu picked that saved my life. My fever went down after two days.” “Chief, did you guys stop contacting each other after that?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask. Elder song used to be in a high position in the core leadership. Even in such a remote mountain village, elder song could be seen on TV. Did that old man Li Zhifu not contact elder song? “I came back once 30 years ago,” said elder song. “It was the time I erected the monument for Xiaodong. I also saw brother Fu.” At that time, it wasn’t as convenient to communicate as it is now. I wrote a few letters to brother Fu, but I didn’t receive a reply. Later, we gradually lost contact. Xiaodong used to live with me at brother Fu’s house, and he was very diligent, often helping brother Fu with chopping wood and fetching water. So after his death, his grave was taken care of by brother Fu until it was later handed over to the local Garrison. ” Eccentric song paused for a moment and continued,””I’m sure brother Fu will continue to take care of Xiaodong’s grave after the garrison was withdrawn. That’s why when I saw Xiaodong’s grave covered in weeds today, I was mentally prepared. Maybe brother Fu has already passed away, or maybe he’s too old to do anything. ” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”chief, since we have a lead, let’s go to yangdun town!” It’s only been eight years since we moved out! This old Mister li Zhifu might still be healthy!” “Good! Let’s go to yangdun town!” Eccentric song said with a hint of excitement.
