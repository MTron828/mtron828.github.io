2966 Who’s the fool (1)

Under normal circumstances, Xia ruofei would have the same thought as Li Yifu.

However, the situation now was special!

Xia ruofei was determined to get this ore. No matter how high Wu Ming’s price was, Xia ruofei would follow. Even if he had to spend over 30000 spirit stones, he would not hesitate!

Of course, this was the last thing Xia ruofei wanted to see. If this happened, everyone would notice this abnormal phenomenon, especially Chen Xuan. He would wonder if the person who wanted to bid for the ore had already discovered the secret. And the value of this ore was extremely high?

It might take some effort for others to find out the identity of the cultivator in Box 20, but for the first heaven society and Chen Xuan, it wasn’t a problem at all.

No matter what the situation was, the best choice was to make a fortune quietly! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei didn’t have much time to think about it because the cultivators participating in today’s auction really didn’t have much interest in this ore. Even when Wu Ming bid 1000 spirit stones, no one raised the bid. On the main auction stage, Hao Qingsong had already asked for the third time if anyone wanted to raise the bid.

Xia ruofei put his worries aside and pressed the increase button in the bidding device without hesitation.

The price on the big screen flashed and was updated to 1010 spirit stones. The starting price of this ore was zero, so the default increment was also the lowest 10 spirit stones.

Hao Qingsong had originally intended to announce that the bidding had ended, so he was clearly stunned when he saw the new price.

However, he quickly reacted and raised his voice,””The fellow Daoist in room 20 has bid 1010 spirit stones!”

In private room 15, Wu Ming was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed and a glass of red wine in his hand.

The reason why he had placed a bid on the spirit stone was just as everyone had expected. He had done so to please the first heaven society and Chen Xuan.

Wu Ming felt that with such an unremarkable ore that had already been proven to be of little use, there would definitely be no one competing with him for it if he offered 1000 spirit stones. There would be no suspense in this round of bidding.

1000 spirit stones for such an ore was a huge loss.

However, using 1000 spiritual stones in exchange for the first heaven society’s favor was more than worth it.

Even Luo Feng, the gold core realm elder who had led the team from the Ling Jue mountain to participate in the auction this time, felt that Wu Ming’s decision was very correct. He even looked at him with a bit of admiration.

Of course, even if Luo Feng was against it, Wu Ming would most likely still insist on his own way.

Although Luo Feng was an elder of the spirit Vulture mountain and his cultivation was much higher than Wu Ming ‘s, everyone in the spirit Vulture mountain knew that the sect leader and his wife doted on Wu Ming, their only son. Wu Ming had been domineering since he was young. However, the sect leader Wu Tiancheng and his wife Ren suling were very protective of their son. As a result, Wu Ming was an existence that no one could touch in the spirit Vulture mountain. Once he lost control of his temper, he would not care if Luo Feng was an elder or not. He would definitely dare to turn hostile.

Of course, the two of them had the same opinion on the matter of bidding for the ore.

Therefore, when they saw the sudden changes on the big screen, they couldn’t help being stunned.

Wu Ming and Luo Feng had not expected that someone would actually bid for it.

Was he another cultivator who wanted to show goodwill to the first heaven sect?

The big screen showed room number 20, but except for the rooms of a few top sects, the rooms of the other sects and the invited rogue cultivators were all in a mess, so this room number didn’t mean anything.

Wu Ming’s face darkened immediately.

This was simply a slap in the face! What could be tolerated?

After being stunned for a moment, Wu Ming immediately entered a new price into the bidding machine and submitted it with a cold snort.

1500 spirit stones!

When Luo Feng saw the price, he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. He naturally felt that Wu Ming was acting on impulse and had raised the price too high.

Even if they wanted to express their goodwill to the heavenly sect, they could just increase the price. Why did they have to increase the price by 500 spiritual stones?

Although 500 spiritual stones was not a big sum for the Ling Jue mountain, they still had other items to compete for! If he spent spirit stones extravagantly now, what would he do if he ran out of spirit stones later?

Luo Feng even suspected that someone had heard some news in advance and knew that the spirit Vulture mountain would compete with them in the subsequent auctions. Thus, they deliberately raised the price to weaken the spirit Vulture mountain’s financial resources.

However, Luo Feng still held back and didn’t say anything. After all, the price had already been submitted, and he knew that Wu Ming definitely wouldn’t listen to him.

Luo Feng could only hope that the other party would not raise the price again. Otherwise, the irascible Wu Ming would really treat spirit stones as a simple number ...

In room 20, Xia ruofei saw Wu Ming’s bid and could not help but grit his teeth, feeling a headache.

On the other hand, Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng looked at Xia ruofei with admiration. Li Yifu said excitedly,””Martial granduncle is wise! This fool actually added another 500 spirit stones!”

Luo Qingfeng also nodded.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he felt very upset. No matter how he heard it, he felt that the word “fool” was very piercing to his ears. It felt like he was being scolded!
