Chapter 1121: Feelings (1)

Translator: 549690339

Lu You stopped in her tracks and turned around. She looked at Xia ruofei with a pair of watery eyes.

“Wait a minute!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

With that, Xia ruofei walked into the bedroom and took out a Jade Leaf from the spirit map space. He held it in his hand and returned to the guest room.

“It’s for you!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“It’s so beautiful!” Lu You’s eyes revealed a look of extreme love. She asked happily,”is this for me?”

“En!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I personally carved this Jade Leaf. Do you like it?”

This time, Xia ruofei had made a total of seven jade leaves. He had originally planned to give them to his closer friends and family. Lu You could be considered as one of his closer friends. Moreover, before Tian Huilan had taken over as a new teacher, she had entrusted him to take care of Lu You, but he had barely contacted her. He felt a little guilty, so he decided to give Lu You a Jade Leaf to protect herself.

Lu You was such a beautiful girl, and her mother was a high – ranking official. It was hard to guarantee that there wouldn’t be people with ulterior motives who had bad intentions toward her. With the protection of a protective Jade Leaf, there would be an additional layer of protection in terms of safety.

When Lu You heard Xia ruofei say that he had personally carved this Jade Leaf, the joy in her eyes grew even more intense, and her face even blushed slightly.

Xia ruofei saw her Bashful and Happy expression and knew that his words could easily cause a misunderstanding. He quickly explained,””That ... I’ve carved a few jade leaves for my friends ...”

The smile on Lu You’s face froze slightly as she thought,”Dumbass! Will you die if you don’t explain this ...

However, this was a gift that Xia ruofei had personally given her, and it was so exquisite and beautiful. Lu You was still very happy. She took the Jade Leaf from Xia ruofei’s hand and said quickly,””Thanks! I really like it ...”

After saying that, she felt her face heat up and quickly turned around to leave.

“Lu You, wait ...” Xia ruofei hurriedly called out again.

“Is there anything else?” Lu You’s eyes were filled with shyness. She did not dare to look Xia ruofei in the eye.

“That ...” Xia ruofei organized his words and said,”this Jade Leaf is a little special. You must wear it on your body and never take it off ...”

Lu You’s face turned even redder when she heard that. It was as if blood was about to drip out of her face. Her eyes were moving, and she had an indescribable alluring look.

Lu You lowered her head, clasped her hands together, and said softly,””I’ll always wear it on my body ...”

After saying this, Lu You was so embarrassed that she didn’t dare to raise her head. She had completely lost her usual cold beauty Aura and was just a shy little girl.

Xia ruofei was even more dumbfounded. He seemed to have said something ambiguous again. The problem was that Lu You did not seem to be angry. Instead, she acted like a little girl ... 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

No matter how slow Xia ruofei was, he could sense Lu You’s heart throbbing.

He didn’t know how to explain it. The more he explained, the messier it would be. If he spoke in a stiff tone, it would be easy to hurt people.

However, Xia ruofei’s brain was spinning quickly. He decided to explain the whole story clearly. If he didn’t explain clearly, how could he make Lu You drip blood on him to acknowledge him as her master? This Jade Leaf definitely had to be bound by blood in order to display its greatest effect.

Besides, Xia ruofei had to tell her to keep it a secret.

Hence, Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Lu You, this Jade Leaf of mine is different from other accessories. It has some special functions, so I have to wear it on my body.”

After Lu You heard this, she realized that she had misunderstood Xia ruofei’s meaning. She felt even more embarrassed, and her pretty face was burning. She said in a mosquito – like voice,””Oh ... I know ...”

Xia ruofei calmed down a little and said,””Also, you need to drip a drop of blood on this Jade Leaf to display its effects ...”

Xia ruofei’s words made Lu You forget about her shyness. She opened her mouth in shock because what Xia ruofei said was too surreal.

Could it be that this fellow had deliberately found such a lousy excuse to make me wear this jade pendant on my body every day? Lu You thought to herself shyly.

“This ... Do you need my help?” Xia ruofei continued.

Lu You was a little dazed. She asked subconsciously,””What?”

“Drip your blood!” Xia ruofei gave Lu You a strange look and said.

This guy was really serious! Lu You said in her heart.

She bit her lower lip and said,””Alright!”

At the same time, Lu You was also pouting in her heart. I’d like to see what this guy is up to.

“Okay, okay, okay, wait a moment!” Xia ruofei said happily.

He was also worried that if he did not drip blood on Lu You to make her acknowledge him as her master on the spot, Lu You might not have taken his advice to heart and did not do it after she returned. This Jade Leaf would not have the protective effect it should have and his efforts would have been in vain.

Moreover, after the blood contract, Lu You would naturally be able to feel the connection between her and the Jade Leaf. She would definitely believe his words. When the time came, he would emphasize to her about keeping it a secret, and she would pay more attention to it.

Xia ruofei quickly returned to the bedroom and took out a silver needle.

After returning to the guest room, Xia ruofei said,””Give me your hand!”

Seeing Xia ruofei take out such a long silver needle, Lu You was a little scared and asked,””Which hand? On the right?”

Xia ruofei looked at Lu You in amusement and said,””Anything is fine! It’s not fortune – telling, there’s a male left and female right ...”

Lu You’s pretty face blushed slightly and she quickly extended her hand.

Xia ruofei reached out and grabbed her hand.””It’ll be quick, it’s just a little painful, don’t be nervous ...”

Lu You was indeed very nervous, not because she was afraid of pain, but because her soft hands were being held by Xia ruofei’s big, warm hands. Her heart was beating wildly, and she did not dare to look Xia ruofei in the eye.

Xia ruofei’s heart couldn’t help but skip a beat when he saw Lu You acting like a little girl. He took a deep breath and knew that this situation was too ambiguous. He had to end it quickly.

The silver needle in his hand quickly pierced out and pierced Lu You’s index finger. He quickly retracted it and then separated a small wisp of true Qi to squeeze the blood in the direction of his finger. Very quickly, a drop of blood appeared on Lu You’s index finger.

Lu You didn’t even feel any pain. She only felt Xia ruofei let go of her little hand and said,””Alright, I’m done!”

She looked up and saw a drop of blood fall on the lifelike Jade Leaf, which was being rapidly absorbed.

A piece of almost transparent glass – Type jade Leaf had completely absorbed the blood. There was no trace of blood inside. This magical scene made Lu You completely forget about her shyness. She slowly opened her eyes.

What Lu You found even more unbelievable was that she could clearly feel that she had a physical connection with this jade talisman and that their minds were connected. It was as if the Jade Leaf and her were one.

The feeling was hard to describe in words, but it was real.

Lu You couldn’t help but exclaim. She took the lifelike Jade Leaf from Xia ruofei’s hand and rubbed it gently.

“Xia ruofei, this ... This is blood ownership claim?” Lu You felt that it was unbelievable because all of this could no longer be explained by science.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Okay. Just wear this Jade Leaf with you from now on. Remember, don’t take it off at any time.”

Xia ruofei emphasized this again so that Lu You would not misunderstand him anymore. She nodded her head seriously.

Lu You could tell how precious and magical this Jade Leaf was. Furthermore, this was a gift that Xia ruofei had personally made for her. Even if Xia ruofei had not asked, she would have worn it every day.

Lu You took off the thin platinum necklace she was wearing and removed the pendant on it. Then, she put the Jade Leaf in.

Then, Lu You said with a hint of shyness,””Can you help me put it on?”

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He couldn’t help but say,””Alright ...”

When he reached out to take the Platinum necklace, he could not help but feel a little regretful. However, he had already said what he wanted to say. Lu You’s beautiful eyes would also sweep over shyly from time to time. It was obvious that she was waiting for him. Xia ruofei secretly sighed and made up his mind to stand behind Lu You.

He circled the Platinum necklace around Lu You’s neck and was about to hang the lock on the back of her neck.

The Platinum necklace was a little short, so Xia ruofei had to be very close to it.

Lu You could feel that Xia ruofei’s body was almost pressed against her back. She could even feel Xia ruofei’s hot breath on the back of her neck. Her heart was beating wildly, and she felt her body going soft. She almost couldn’t stand.

Xia ruofei wasn’t any better off. A faint fragrance assailed his nose. He tried a few times but failed. In the end, he took a deep breath and calmed his mind before he fastened the lock.

Xia ruofei took a step back as if he had been pardoned. Lu You quickly reached out and stuffed the Jade Leaf into her clothes. Then, she tidied her hair to hide the panic in her heart.

“I’ll be leaving first ...”Lu You said softly with a red face.

“Oh! “Be careful on the road ...” Xia ruofei said, stunned.

Lu You left Xia ruofei’s room as if she was escaping. Xia ruofei stood at the same spot in a daze for a long time before he revealed a bitter smile.

There was still a trace of Lu You’s fragrance in the room, and an inexplicable feeling seemed to be growing quietly. This made Xia ruofei very conflicted.

He shook his head with a bitter smile. He really had no experience in dealing with this kind of messy things that couldn’t be sorted out. He could only take it one step at a time now ...

Xia ruofei remembered that he had forgotten to emphasize the confidentiality of the matter to Lu You. However, he was a little afraid to call Lu You. Anyway, Lu You would be looking for him to get the jaded skin ointment when he returned in the evening. He would just tell her then.

Xia ruofei looked at the time. He wanted to go downstairs for breakfast, but he was afraid that Lu You would be in the buffet restaurant too. He called the waiter to send breakfast up.

After the call, Xia ruofei heard someone knocking on the door. He thought to himself,”could it be that Lu You has returned?”

He quickly used his spiritual power to check and found that it was song Rui standing at the door. He heaved a sigh of relief and got up to open the door.
