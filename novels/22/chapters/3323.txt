3324 Passing off the fake as the real (2)

“The performance is over. Just listen to me,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Ling Qingxue’s expression changed slightly. She sighed and didn’t say anything else. However, the pained and uncomfortable expression on her face was still very on point.

Xia ruofei continued,”the biggest flaw was actually the mission prompt just now.” When this voice first appeared, I subconsciously felt that something was wrong, but I didn’t realize it. When she started to issue the mission, I finally noticed the flaw ...”

“Before this, it was always text that appeared in my perceptual mirror’s field of view to prompt me about the subsequent mission. Why did it suddenly become a voice prompt?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”at first, I just thought it was a little abrupt, but after hearing about this mission, my suspicion became stronger. In fact, the method of issuing tasks had become somewhat unreasonable. The perceptual mirror was a magic weapon, and everything was reasonable to issue tasks through it. But how did this female voice appear, and why did it have to be changed to such an abrupt manner? You have to know that the person who set up such a large – scale trial environment must be a powerful figure with extremely high cultivation. How could he design such an online game – like artificial intelligence method to hint me about the next mission?” Xia ruofei continued. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He then looked at the silent Ling Qingxue, smiled, and said,””At that moment, I began to suspect that I didn’t actually escape from that terrifying illusory formation. It was just that the power of the illusory formation automatically increased when it couldn’t do anything to me. My biggest obsession now is to meet up with Qingxue as soon as possible. So, the strengthened illusory realm was designed according to my obsession and created an extremely deceptive image. That’s why I started to test you with words. I know that any image that appears in front of me is based on my memory. You and Wei Wei agreed to be my girlfriend at the same time. I only know the result, but I don’t know the specific content of your conversation. So, as an inner demon created from my memory, you naturally can’t understand the situation at that time. ”

“I’ll say it again, I’m not a demon ...” Ling Qingxue said angrily.”I just didn’t want to tell you!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if you had been like this from the start, I might not have been so sure.” If you were really Qingxue, you might not have been willing to tell me when I asked you that question, but you definitely wouldn’t have acted like a spoiled child. I really know Qingxue too well, which is why you, the demon in my heart, can be so vividly imitated. However, when it comes to some details, an array is an array after all, and it can’t be truly passed off as the real thing. Once a flaw is exposed and you want to fix it ... Hehe, I don’t know about others, but at least for me ... It’s impossible to fix it!”

“I don’t want to explain so much!” Ling Qingxue closed her eyes and said,”since you insist on thinking that I’m your inner demon, then do it!” I can’t beat you anyway! But don’t forget what you promised Wei Wei before we left. If Wei Wei finds out that you killed me with your own hands, what will her reaction be?”

“You’re still a fake after all, the more you talk, the more you’ll make mistakes!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I promised Weiwei that I would do my best to protect Qingxue. That’s right! However, if you were really Qingxue, you would never use this kind of method to retreat in order to advance. You’re a straightforward and straightforward person!”

Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”RUO Fei, I’ll just ask you one thing.” If I’m really your inner demon, I’m born from your memories. Since you already know my personality and habits, how could I not know and even reveal such a big flaw to you? You have to know that I’m a human, not a machine. If I’m a human, I’ll be affected by my emotions. I can’t be like a computer program that follows a planned route without any chaos!”

Xia ruofei clicked his tongue.”Even at this time, you still haven’t forgotten to shake my mind. You’re really dedicated.” However, if you really are Qingxue, you should know how determined I am. All of this is useless. If you really are Qingxue, you wouldn’t have said a single word at this time! So, as long as you keep testing, you’ll find more and more flaws. After all, even though you’re an inner demon, you still have the desire to live! How could she keep acting like how Qingxue looked in my memory?”

With that, Xia ruofei made a hand seal. The flying sword of the bent frost let out a crisp cry and flew towards Ling Qingxue at high speed.

Ling Qingxue took a few steps back and said anxiously,””RUO Fei! What do you want? How can I prove myself? Don’t do anything stupid!”

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything and the qushuang flying sword didn’t slow down.

Ling Qingxue quickly dodged.

Qu Shuang’s flying sword cut through Ling Qingxue’s arm, and fresh blood spurted out. In an instant, half of her arm was dyed red.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but let out a scream and covered her arm.

Dark red blood continuously seeped out from the gaps between her fingers. Her face turned pale as she said,””RUO Fei ... You ... You’re really silly!”

Puchi!

From another angle, the flying sword also made a big cut on Ling Qingxue’s leg.

Ling Qingxue let out a soft moan and fell to the ground.

The blood dripped on the yellow sand, but was quickly buried by the yellow sand blown by the wind, leaving no trace.

The curved Frost Flying sword flew in an arc and aimed at Ling Qingxue again.

This time, the flying sword’s target was her fair and slender neck.

Ling Qingxue’s face was pale. She supported herself with one hand and stared at Xia ruofei.”RUO Fei, I’m really regretful ... After we split up, I’ve been thinking of meeting up with you as soon as possible. On the first level of the Tower of Trials, I faced an entire town of puppets alone. At my most helpless moment, I dreamed of you being like a divine weapon that fell from the sky and coming to save me. “Finally, I was suddenly teleported here, and at the most dangerous time, you appeared in front of me and killed those giant lizards. You were really like my Guardian. I never thought that our reunion would actually sound my death knell ...”

Xia ruofei’s heart could not help but tremble when he heard Ling Qingxue’s tearful words.

His heart, which was originally as hard as iron, could not help but waver a little.

He couldn’t help but say in his heart,”what if I really made a mistake? what should I do?” Could it be that ... I really have to kill her? A single misstep would result in eternal hatred! If I kill my lover with my own hands, how can I still have the face to continue living in this world?

However, another voice in his mind said firmly,”I can’t hesitate! This was an inner demon! And it was the most powerful inner demon that had appeared so far! If you don’t get rid of your inner demons in time, you will forever be lost in the third level of the trial Pagoda!

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with confusion for a few seconds before he regained his composure.

He stared at Ling Qingxue, who was covered in blood, and said,””Don’t waste your time! If you really are Qingxue, I’ll kill myself on the spot after I kill you! I’ll personally apologize to you! I’ll protect you down there and won’t let you get hurt. ”

“Ruofei, wake up!” Ling Qingxue’s eyes were filled with tears as she said,”it’s not too late to turn back now!”

Xia ruofei grinned and said,”actually, there’s a very obvious flaw.” Do you know? The mission issued by the female voice of the system was too unreasonable! Hunting high level star beasts should be something that happened on the second level of the Tower of Trials. The third level’s mission definitely wouldn’t have anything to do with star beasts! Otherwise, the Almighty who designed the trial space is too weak!”

Without waiting for Ling Qingxue’s reply, the flying sword whizzed towards the dazed Ling Qingxue. This time, it was really fierce, without the slightest hesitation!
