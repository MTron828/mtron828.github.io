Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s a good conclusion.” It doesn’t matter if your cultivation progress is slow in the early stages, and you don’t have to worry about the lack of spiritual energy. Master will find a way to solve it in the future. ”

Tang Haoran’s eyes lit up when he heard that. He said happily,””I know, thank you, master!”

“Alright, let’s go out and play!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After all, Tang Haoran was still a child. He was more playful. Lin Qiao had said that they were going fishing during breakfast. So, when Xia ruofei opened his mouth, Tang Haoran immediately greeted Xia ruofei and ran out.

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head. He then left the cabin.

Lin Qiao had already taken her fishing rod and was fishing excitedly at the stern of the ship. Xia ruofei was lying on the deck chair and enjoying the Australian winter sun.

After playing for a while, Lin Qiao gained little.

She had only caught two finger – sized clownfish in total, and she finally lost her patience.

Thus, Jennifer proposed to go swimming in the sea, which was immediately responded to by Lin Qiao.

Lin Qiao grew up in a fishing village by the coast of the three mountains, so swimming was not a problem for her. However, she had never swam in the beautiful sea of a foreign country, so she was naturally very interested in it.

Although it was still winter in Australia, the temperature was still very high near noon. Young people were in good health, so swimming in the sea was naturally not a problem.

“Jennifer, I didn’t bring my swimsuit!” Lin Qiao frowned.

“There are swimsuits on the yacht,” Jennifer said with a smile.”Come with me to pick one!”

Lin Qiao subconsciously looked at Jennifer’s proud peaks. Jennifer immediately understood and smiled,””Don’t worry, I have swimsuits of all sizes here! Come with me!”

Lin Qiao’s pretty face blushed slightly, but she did feel a little inferior. Although she was well developed, there was still a difference in her race. Compared to Jennifer, she was at least two sizes smaller.

She had only taken a glance subconsciously and did not expect Jennifer to see through her mind. She suddenly felt a little embarrassed.

Xia ruofei happened to hear their conversation and looked at Lin Qiao with a smile in his eyes.

Lin Qiao was even more embarrassed. She couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei and said,””Brother ruofei, you lazy bum! You’ve been lying there for half a day! You’re not allowed to be lazy this time. You have to go swimming in the sea too!”

“I don’t know how to swim ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

“Who are you trying to fool?” Lin Qiao pouted and said,”my brother told me that you guys wanted to do some armed swimming training! How can you not know how to swim?”

Xia ruofei laughed awkwardly.”Can I not go into the sea? I’m too lazy to move ...”

“No!” Lin Qiao and Jennifer said in unison.

Then, Jennifer said with a smile,””Xia, with such good sunlight and seawater, how can we not go to the sea and take a swim!”

“Alright, alright ...” Xia ruofei shrugged and stood up.”But if I drown, you have to save me ...”

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but burst into laughter and said, “Don’t worry! I won’t drown you ...”

Then, Lin Qiao took Jennifer’s hand and said,””Jennifer, let’s go change into our swimsuits!”

Then, Lin Qiao turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Hurry up and change! Don’t let the girls wait for you!”

“I know!” Xia ruofei waved his hand lazily.

Tang Yitian smiled and brought Xia ruofei to find a new pair of swimming trunks for him. Xia ruofei returned to the cabin, changed quickly, and walked to the stern of the ship.

At this time, Tang Yitian and Tang Haoran had already changed into their swimming trunks, but Jennifer and Lin Qiao had not come out yet.

Women were always more troublesome in this aspect. The two men, Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian, both expressed their understanding and sat at the stern of the ship, waiting patiently.

In the yacht’s master bedroom, Lin Qiao looked at the swimsuits Jennifer took out with a blushing face and said,”Jennifer, this ... This is too ... Are there any one – piece swimsuits?”

Jennifer took out two – piece bikinis, and the fabric was quite economical. She felt embarrassed just by looking at Lin Qiao, let alone wearing them.

“Lin, I only have bikinis here!” Jennifer said with a smile.

“Ah?” Lin Qiao couldn’t help but ask,”then what should we do? I ... I can’t wear this out!”

Jennifer put her arm around Lin Qiao’s shoulder and said with a smile,””Lin, you have such a good figure, why do you have to wrap it in a one – piece swimsuit? Bikinis suit you the best!”

“I ... We Chinese girls are more conservative. This swimsuit is too revealing ... I’m too embarrassed to wear it ...” Lin Qiao said with a red face.

Jennifer looked at Lin Qiao with a meaningful look and said,””Lin, a girl’s good figure should be shown to the person she likes! Believe me, when you go out in a bikini, Xia will definitely be fascinated by you!”

“Really? “Brother ruofei, he ...” Lin Qiao said subconsciously, but then she immediately came back to her senses and said with a red face,”Jennifer, don’t talk nonsense ... He ... He’s my brother!”

Jennifer said to Lin Qiao with a smile,””But you’re not blood – related, right?”

“We are not blood – related, but ...”

“No buts!” Jennifer said,”when you meet someone you like, you have to pursue them with courage, especially at an age like you where flowers bloom. If you’re afraid of anything, you’ll regret it in the future!”

Jennifer was Lin Qiao’s idol, so Lin Qiao could still listen to her words.

“Thank you for your advice, Jennifer, but ... Brother ruofei already has a girlfriend ...” Lin Qiao said with a red face.

Jennifer shrugged and said,”so what?” It would be surprising if a man as outstanding as Xia didn’t have a girlfriend!”

“But he’s very close to sister Qingxue, and sister Qingxue is very good to me ...” Lin Qiao said.”And brother ruofei ... Really only sees me as his sister ... I can feel it!”

Jennifer put her hands on Lin Qiao’s shoulders and said,””Lin, you’re only 19 years old. You still have a lot of time and unlimited possibilities for your future. It’s not good to be hesitant at this age! Everything you said was an external factor, but you just have to follow your heart ...”

Lin Qiao’s eyes showed a trace of confusion. After a long while, she shook her head and said with a smile,””Jennifer, I’ll consider your suggestion!”

Jennifer smiled and nodded.””Alright! I know it’s hard for you ... But what’s the point of thinking so much? At least Xia will be yours for the next few days! He’s here to travel with you!”

Lin Qiao’s eyes brightened and she said with a smile,”That makes sense!”

“Do you still need a one – piece swimsuit?” Jennifer blinked at Lin Qiao and asked.

Lin Qiao blushed and said,”didn’t you say you didn’t have any?” Then let’s go with a bikini!”

“This is right!” Jennifer said,”I’ll help you pick one! Your skin is fairer, so I think this one is more suitable ...”

……

Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian waited for more than ten minutes before Jennifer and Lin Qiao finally arrived.

Both of them were covered in white bath towels and walked to the deck barefooted.

When Lin Qiao took off the bath towel and laid it on the recliner, Xia ruofei’s eyes couldn’t help but narrow.

Lin Qiao was wearing a pink polka – dot swimsuit. Her figure was actually very good, but she usually wore conservative clothes, so it was not obvious. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After changing into her swimsuit today, her good figure was fully displayed.

Although Xia ruofei only glanced at it subconsciously, he could not help but be moved and quickly looked away.

Xia ruofei didn’t know what he was thinking, but he immediately turned his head to look at Tang Yitian. When he found that Tang Yitian’s eyes were full of love and fell on Jennifer instead of Lin Qiao, he felt much more comfortable.

Lin Qiao naturally felt Xia ruofei’s gaze. She was already a little shy, but now she felt even more embarrassed. She almost wanted to run back to the cabin to change her clothes.

However, she gritted her teeth and insisted on staying on the deck. She couldn’t help but feel a trace of joy in the depths of her heart.

Jennifer gave Lin Qiao an encouraging look, and Lin Qiao also looked at Jennifer and then nodded gently.

Then, Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Brother ruofei, come and help me apply sunblock! I can’t reach my back ...”
