3170 Supercomputing Center (3)

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I understand!” This was the world’s leading supercomputer! From a certain point of view, it’s not an exaggeration to call this a national treasure!”

“Yup!” Wang Chi said with a smile.

Soon, the car arrived at the courtyard of the Supercomputing Center.

The Supercomputing Center was only an eight – story building with a few other low – rise ancillary buildings. From the outside, it could be said to be ordinary. If no one introduced it, many people would not have thought that China’s most advanced supercomputer was installed here.

Of course, Xia ruofei scanned the area with his psychic power and found that there were indeed many hidden sentries around. Many of the security guards were armed with live ammunition. It was obvious that the security was tight.

The car slowly stopped, and the electric door slowly opened with a beeping sound.

The car door was only half open when a few people who had been waiting in the courtyard quickly walked to the car.

“Academician Wang! We warmly welcome you to inspect and guide our work!” The leading official in his 50s came forward and said enthusiastically.

The official was dressed in a white shirt, black suit pants, and a pair of gold – rimmed glasses. His hair was also neatly arranged, and he looked very refreshing.

Wang Chi also revealed a smile and said gently,””Director Cai, long time no see!”

“You’re still as elegant as ever! You look even more energetic than the last time we met!” Director Cai said with a smile.

“That mouth of yours ...” Wang Chi pointed at director Cai and said,”by the way, let me introduce you. This is the chairman of paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei, CEO Xia. CEO Xia, this is Cai linsong, the director of the National Supercomputing Center!” Director Cai has the final say in the new Wu’s Supercomputer Center!”

“Academician Wang, you’re joking. We’re also following the instructions from our higher – ups to manage the equipment.” Cai linsong laughed drily, then immediately showed a warm smile to Xia ruofei. He took the initiative to extend his hand and said,”welcome, CEO Xia!”

“Sorry for the trouble, chief Cai!” Xia ruofei said as he shook hands with Cai linsong.

Wang Chi asked,”director Cai, is there any problem with the timing I booked in advance?” I’ve even brought President Xia here. If you drop the ball here, I’ll really have no place to hide my old face!”

“No problem!” Cai linsong quickly replied. No problem! How would we dare to disobey your words? Don’t worry! Before 10 O’ clock tonight, I’ll make sure that President Xia can use the equipment!”

“Then, thank you, director Cai!” Xia ruofei said happily.

“You’re welcome! You’re welcome!” Cai linsong chuckled.

Then, Cai linsong introduced the other leaders to Wang Chi, Xia ruofei, and the rest. He mainly introduced them to Xia ruofei. Wang Chi often came to the Supercomputing Center, so he was familiar with the other leaders.

After the small talk, the group of people escorted Wang Chi into the Supercomputing Center.

“I’ll go to director Cai’s place to settle some things first,”Wang Chi said while walking. Director Cai, can you arrange for someone to show President Xia around the equipment first?”

“Alright!” Cai linsong said with a smile.

Cai linsong assigned a Deputy Director with the surname Wei to bring Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue on a tour. He brought Wang Chi to his office. As for the other team members, they naturally dispersed and returned to their offices.

“Director Wei, I’ve caused you trouble!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“No, no, no!” Deputy Director Wei smiled and said,”President Xia is a great hero! It’s my honor to be able to receive a great hero like you!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. Then, he realized that Deputy Director Wei might be talking about the incident where he had forced the plane to surrender in Saipan. In a sense, he was really a hero. After all, if it were not for him, the hundreds of people on the plane would have been wiped out. He had saved hundreds of lives.

However, because the plane was Air Australia, half of the passengers were Chinese and half were foreign. Therefore, although the Chinese media focused on reporting, it was always a matter of foreign airlines.

If Xia ruofei had saved a Huaxia airline’s plane back then, it would have been a classic case and publicized all over the country.

“I didn’t expect director Wei to know about my past ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Hey! My daughter really admires President Xia!” Deputy Director Wei said,”I’ve never seen her so obsessed with someone since I was young. She said you’re her ... What bean?”

“Do you like your idol?” Ling Qingxue chuckled.

“It seems so!” Deputy Chief Wei smiled bitterly.”Anyway, I don’t understand these things of young people at all. How did you become a bean?”

Song Wei smiled and explained,”director Wei,” idol “is the English transliteration of” idol,”which means idol!”

“Oh ...” Deputy Director Wei suddenly realized and said with a smile,”the children these days are really ... So what if they are idols?” What idol ...”

“Director Wei!” Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei before asking,”how old is your daughter?”

Xia ruofei could not help but feel a chill down his spine. Was this the rhythm of a jealous lover? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I’m in the first year of middle school this year!” Deputy Chief Wei said,”this child didn’t chase after celebrities in the past! Ever since I saw some of President Xia’s Weibo posts, videos, and that ... That TV show ...”

“The life you yearn for?” Song Wei reminded.

“Yes, yes, yes. It’s the one where a few celebrities played rural tourism together!” Deputy Director Wei said,”anyway, she’s completely mesmerized after seeing these things related to President Xia ...”

Xia ruofei’s forehead was full of sweat as he said,””Director Wei, it’s not a good thing for a child to be obsessed with chasing stars. You have to persuade her. Besides, I’m not a celebrity ...”

“Oh! “That’s good ...” Deputy Director Wei said.”Her academic performance didn’t decline much, and she seems to be a lot more cheerful, so we didn’t really care about her!”
