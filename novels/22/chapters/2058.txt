2059 Not welcomed (2)

Monica’s face changed slightly. She scolded in a low voice,””Rousey, don’t spout nonsense. There’s nothing going on between me and Mr. Xia Tian ...”

Monica stole a glance at Xia ruofei. She was worried that Xia ruofei would be jealous.

If the Mr. Xia Rousey was referring to was someone else, Xia ruofei might have felt a little jealous. However, if it was Xia Tian, how could Xia ruofei be jealous of him?

He said in his heart,”so my brother – in – Law thinks that the other me is more suitable for her sister!” He really had no taste ...

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Rousey, I’m not here to discuss your relationship with you today.”

“Rousey,” Monica quickly added,”Xia came all the way from China to Turin just to treat your leg!”

Rosey’s eyes widened and he looked at Monica for a long time before he said,””Monica, are you sure you don’t have a fever?”

Monica was a little embarrassed. In fact, she did not believe that Xia ruofei could cure Rossi’s leg. It was just that Xia ruofei had come all the way here enthusiastically and she really wanted to see him, so she did not stop him. However, this did not mean that she had much confidence in Xia ruofei’s medical skills.

Rossi sighed and looked at Xia ruofei.””Are all the people with the surname Xia very powerful in China?”

Xia ruofei didn’t quite understand. He shrugged and asked,””Why do you say that?”

“Up until now, I only know two Chinese people with the surname Xia. They’re both quite capable.” Rousey said seriously,”Mr. Xia Tian’s skills are even better than Spiderman and Superman combined. As for you, Mr. Xia ruofei, I’m amazed by your ability to pursue girls. Monica is a calm person. How did you make her fall for you and believe that you can cure the sequelae of polio?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He smiled bitterly and said,””Can I take it as a compliment?”

Rosey shrugged and said,”of course!” In fact, I’m very inexperienced in this area. After all, not many girls are willing to date someone who’s always in a wheelchair. ”

Xia ruofei thought to himself, I don’t think that’s a compliment ...

If this brat wasn’t Monica’s brother, if his hidden hostility wasn’t because of his other self, Xia ruofei would have left.

“Rousey, I don’t need you to worry about my personal relationship,” Monica said with a frown. I didn’t come all the way from China just to hear your sarcasm ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand to stop Monica from continuing. Then, he smiled at Rousey and said,””Hey! A life without love is incomplete. Have you ever thought that if you can stand up, with your intelligence and wealth, there will be countless beautiful women throwing flirtatious looks at you, making you dizzy?”

Xia ruofei only paused for a moment. Before Luo Si could speak, he continued,””I know that you’ve seen many doctors since you were a child, and there are many famous doctors among them, but those are all Western doctors. I believe you haven’t tried Chinese medicine treatment, right?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Chinese medicine?” Rosey said with a frown.

His Chinese was very fluent, so he was naturally familiar with Chinese culture. He shrugged and said,””I’m sorry, Mr. Xia. I don’t think my problem can be cured by drinking water boiled from tree roots and bark ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Even a person with such good Chinese had such a huge prejudice against Chinese medicine. It could be seen that the demonic propaganda of European and American countries had a huge negative impact on Chinese culture and Chinese medicine.

“Traditional Chinese Medicine is not a witch doctor as some media say,” he said seriously.”It’s also a systematic subject that has been passed down for thousands of years. Different from Western medicine, which treated headaches and feet, Chinese medicine focused on the balance of yin and yang and systematic conditioning. And I have to correct you on one point. Chinese medicine doesn’t just use Chinese medicine to treat diseases. This theory also includes acupuncture, massage, and so on. Even the rehabilitation therapy methods in the Western Field have been used by Chinese medicine Masters hundreds of years ago. ”

“Xia, I’m sorry,” Monica said apologetically,”Rousey was rude ...”

“It’s fine. He just doesn’t know much about Chinese medicine.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He was not angry with Rousey and continued,””The Mr. Xia Tian you mentioned earlier is also Chinese. In your eyes, Eastern Huaxia is full of mystery. Xia Tian’s combat strength is comparable to Spiderman, so why can’t the Traditional Chinese Medicine that has been passed down for thousands of years cure your leg?”

Xia ruofei’s mention of Xia Tian made Rosi slightly dazed.

Xia ruofei continued,”Rousey, let me try!” Even if it can’t be cured, you won’t lose anything, right? If I’m lucky enough to succeed, you’ll be able to get rid of the wheelchair completely ...”

Xia ruofei used a bit of spiritual power and his voice was full of enchantment. Rossi could not help but follow Xia ruofei’s psychological suggestion and think about the beautiful life after he recovered his ability to walk and run. He nodded subconsciously.

Monica was both surprised and happy.

Xia ruofei had a gentle smile on his face. He walked over and pushed Rousey’s wheelchair to the table.

“Rousey, hold out your hand, I’ll examine you ...” He said with a smile.
