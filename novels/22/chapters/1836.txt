Xia ruofei walked over and planted a kiss on Ling Qingxue’s smooth forehead. He smiled and said,””Be good!”

Then, he laughed as he walked out of the room, laughing at Ling Qingxue’s embarrassed moans.

This time, Xia ruofei did not let Xie Bing drive. Instead, he drove the Knight XV SUV and left the farm.

After arriving at the new headquarters of the Tao Yuan tower, Xia ruofei first met with Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and the other senior executives to understand the situation of the relocation yesterday.

Then, he took the high – ranking officials around each floor. On the one hand, he wanted to see how everyone was working, and on the other hand, he wanted to encourage the employees.

In general, everyone’s mental state was maintained at a very excited level. After all, the office environment had improved, and the workplace was much more prosperous than before.

In the past, although the interior environment of Taoyuan farm was good, they would have to go to the farmland after leaving the house. If they wanted to shop, they had to go to Changping County, which was more or less inconvenient. Moreover, young people liked to be lively. The environment of the farm was good for cultivation and health, but for them, it was a little too quiet.

Now that he had moved out to work, he would be in the city center. Although there was no staff cafeteria here for the time being, it was simply too convenient to order takeaway and the little brother would send it upstairs in a few minutes!

In addition, the company also provided rental subsidies, so many young employees chose to move out of the dormitory at Taoyuan farm. Those who were better off rented a single apartment by themselves, and those who were slightly worse off rented a unit with a few people.

Most of the staff working at the headquarters were administrative staff, sales staff, and logistics staff. So, in fact, the change of office location did not have much impact on their work. After a day of adaptation, everyone was basically in working mode.

Of course, this was also thanks to Feng ke and Dong Yun’s ample preparations and their efficient management during the relocation.

Xia ruofei walked around and praised everyone’s work. Then, he did not return to the luxurious office on the top floor. Instead, he took the elevator down and left, leaving Feng Jing, Dong Yun, and the other executives to look at each other helplessly.

It was rare to see a boss who didn’t care about anything.

However, for high – end professional managers like Feng Jing and Dong Yun, it wasn’t a bad thing to meet such a boss. They had full autonomy, and the Paradise Corporation had great potential for development, so they could fully fulfill their ambitions.

The reason why Xia ruofei was in such a hurry was that time was of the essence. He still had to go back to prepare lunch! Before that, he had to go to the seed company to buy a batch of high – Quality rice seeds.

In fact, the peach blossom company now had a large demand for seeds, but after his popularity grew, he basically chose to buy seeds from the internet to avoid being noticed by people who bought a large number of ordinary vegetable seeds and thought that he had some secret.

Online shopping was more convenient now, and the few shops that he often bought seeds from had a good reputation. Many transactions had proved that the quality of their seeds was very good.

Naturally, all the items that he bought online were sent to his warehouse in the city.

For this reason, Xia ruofei had hired an old man to look after the warehouse.

He said that he was looking at the warehouse, but in fact, he was mainly responsible for opening the door, receiving the express delivery, and informing Xia ruofei when the seeds and other items from online shopping arrived. Xia ruofei did not ask him to stay in the warehouse at other times.

This time, Xia ruofei only wanted to open up a few acres of paddy fields. He did not need a lot of seeds. He did not plan to plant rice in the outside world for the time being, so he went to the seed company to buy them.

There were many types of rice seeds. Xia ruofei’s request was simple. The rice planted had to taste good. It did not matter if the yield was slightly lower. Very quickly, he picked two types of rice seeds and bought 30 catties of each.

On the way back to the farm, Xia ruofei kept the rice seeds in his interspace.

He first soaked Xia Qing in the spirit pond water before opening up a small plot of land at the Archean realm to nurture the seedlings. With this time difference, the paddy fields in the mountain sea realm would be fully developed, and the rice seedlings could be directly transplanted.

Since the opening up of the paddy field was an experiment, and he had made up his mind to keep all the grains he had planted for himself, he had specially instructed Xia Qing to add a certain amount of spirit Heart Flower petal solution when soaking the seeds.

Planting rice wasn’t a complicated technique. Even if Xia Qing’s “database” didn’t have such knowledge, Xia ruofei just had to explain it to him and he would naturally learn it.

Xia ruofei did not need to worry about the rest.

He drove back to Taoyuan farm. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Qingxue had been in the living room the entire morning, trying her best to memorize the first level of the technique. When she heard the sound of the car engine, she immediately rushed to open the door happily. When she saw Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei, who was parking the car, stuck his head out of the car window and waved at her.

“RUO Fei!” Ling Qingxue cried out,”you’re back so quickly! I thought you were going to eat out!”

Xia ruofei parked the car in the parking space and jumped out swiftly. He laughed and said,””My wife is still waiting at home! I’m so eager to go home, how can I have the mood to eat outside! Besides, if I don’t come back to cook, Won’t You Be hungry?”
