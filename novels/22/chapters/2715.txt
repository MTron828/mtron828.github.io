Li Yifu couldn’t help but feel that this secret technique was too overbearing!

Xia ruofei glanced at Li Yifu and more or less guessed what he was thinking.

Xia ruofei asked,”foster husband, do you think that this method is evil? do you feel a little uncomfortable?”

“Your disciple wouldn’t dare!” Li Yifu replied fearfully.

“There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s good to have the courage to question. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I’ll explain it simply! What was an evil spirit? Are there good and evil secret techniques?”

Li Yifu revealed a thoughtful expression. Xia ruofei glanced at him and continued,””At the moment of life and death, when faced with the cultivation sects coveting the Peach Blossom Island like wolves and tigers, if you still worry about whether the secret technique is in line with the right path, that’s pedantic and not righteous! A secret technique that is used in the right way is the right way, and the opposite is the evil way. The soul seal is the same!”

Xia ruofei’s words were like the evening drum and morning bell, making Li Yifu feel enlightened.

His body trembled slightly, and the confusion in his eyes was swept away.

Li Yifu bowed to Xia ruofei respectfully and said,””Thank you for your advice, senior granduncle. This disciple has learned!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”foster husband, remember this. As long as you stick to your principles, you don’t have to doubt yourself no matter what method you use to achieve your goal. There are good and evil people, but there are no martial arts!”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment and continued,””Of course, the premise is that the cultivation of this technique doesn’t require the assistance of any messy blood essence or even the assistance of young boys and girls. The soul seal is a cultivation technique passed down from our sect, do you think it’s this kind of evil secret technique?”

“Senior granduncle, this disciple knows his mistake!” Li Yifu said,”I was too pedantic ...”

He did have such doubts just now, but after Xia ruofei’s words, he realized that his thoughts were a little too pedantic.

In fact, Li Yifu had been a low – Level individual cultivator for the past few decades. He didn’t understand the cultivation world on earth, especially those cultivation sects. If it were a sect disciple, his first reaction would definitely not be whether this cultivation method would harm the harmony of the world, but whether he could learn it.

The laws of the cultivation world were far crueler than those of the secular world.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”also, the spiritual power requirement for using the soul seal is very high. One has to be at least in the spirit gathering realm. I barely meet the requirements. Also, there is a limit to the number of people who can be controlled by the soul seal.”

Xia ruofei then patted Li Yifu’s shoulder and said,””Alright, let’s not talk about this! He had finally achieved his goal today! Let’s go back first! I need to ask the two of them some questions immediately. ”

“Yes, martial granduncle!” Li Yifu replied.

Xia ruofei and Li Yifu strode towards the warehouse of the airport. Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou did not need to be called and quickly followed.

On the way, Li Yifu couldn’t help but ask,””Martial granduncle, since you’ve mastered the soul seal secret technique, why don’t you use it directly in the capital? Didn’t you guys meet face to face before?”

“Beijing is the core of Huaxia, after all. It’s not good to make a scene.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course, the main reason is that using a soul seal is not always successful. The reason why I went through so much trouble was to find the opportunity when they were distracted. Otherwise, even if my cultivation is higher than theirs, it would not be easy to plant a soul seal in their sea of consciousness. Once they resist, they might die. The star Seizer sect will immediately be alerted. ”

Li Yifu thought about it carefully and recalled that Xia ruofei had asked benilatti to constantly send false information to Wang Boshan. Even earlier, Xia ruofei had also planted a soul seal on an ordinary person like benilatti. In fact, he had already been planning this. It could be said that every step was calculated very accurately to ensure that there were no mistakes.

Li Yifu couldn’t help but say,”senior granduncle’s plan is flawless. This disciple is impressed!”

“No,” Xia ruofei said, waving his hand.”It’s related to a cultivation sect. We can’t be too careful.”

While they were talking, the group had arrived near the airport warehouse.

The four of them were all cultivators, so they easily avoided the patrolling brothers of the Hong sect and entered the warehouse without anyone knowing.

Xia ruofei found a chair and sat down. Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou stood in front of Xia ruofei with their hands down.

Although the two of them did not turn into delirious puppets, under the effect of the soul seal, they did not have any hatred towards Xia ruofei. Instead, they had a kind of absolute obedience that came from the depths of their souls.

Xia ruofei asked Li Yifu to find a chair to sit down as well. Then, he looked at Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou, and asked lightly,””Tell me, how did you set your eyes on the Peach Blossom Island?”

Wang Boshan quickly told him everything about how he accidentally discovered the extraordinariness of the Paradise Island, how he reported it to the sect leader, Luo Qingfeng, and how the sect sent Zheng Yongshou to take charge of the mission. He did not hold anything back.

“So you’re saying that you haven’t confirmed the specific situation of this formation?” Xia ruofei asked. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zheng Yongshou replied respectfully,”master, this subordinate’s array skills are limited. I’ve found an opportunity to examine it up close, but I can only confirm that this array is of a very high level. It’s much higher than the star Seizer sect’s sect – protecting array. I can’t tell anything else.”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked the question he was most concerned about.””Apart from the two of you and Luo Qingfeng, the sect master of the star Seizer sect, does anyone else know about the natural formation on the Peach Blossom Island?”

Zheng Yongshou hesitated for a moment and said,””Master, before this subordinate left the sect, the sect leader had sealed off all information. Even the sect elders didn’t know. The sect leader also strictly ordered his subordinates not to leak the news. He said that once the news spread, it was very likely to attract other sects to snatch it, so it must be tightly sealed. Thus, this subordinate judged that this news should not have spread. It’s just that ... This subordinate has left the sect for some time. I don’t know if the sect master has told this news to anyone else. ”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei felt a little more at ease. Although he could not be sure of the scope of this information, at least he knew that Luo Qingfeng had his own concerns, so he would not spread the news everywhere.

Xia ruofei continued to ask about the star Seizer sect, paying special attention to Luo Qingfeng.

Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou naturally didn’t dare to hide anything. As long as they knew it, they poured it out like beans from a bamboo tube.

Xia ruofei’s information was similar to the one Liu chengfeng had obtained from the sect. However, Wang and Zheng had explained it in more detail, which could be considered as confirmation of the previous information.

The one with the highest cultivation level in the star Seizer sect was undoubtedly the sect master, Luo Qingfeng. He had already reached the early stage of the Aurous core stage and was the only person in the sect who had reached the Aurous core stage.

Xia ruofei calculated in his heart. One golden core cultivator, two Qi level 9 cultivators, 20 to 30 Qi Level 7 and 8 cultivators, plus 60 to 70 low level cultivators. This was the entire strength of the star picking sect. He definitely couldn’t fight against them alone. The good news now was that the information about the Paradise Island had not been spread. If he could deal with sect leader Luo Qingfeng, he could probably block the news.

At the same time, he could also obtain a soul slave at the Golden core stage and even control a cultivation sect indirectly.

Therefore, although this was the most dangerous thing he had encountered since he had obtained the spirit map space, risk and opportunity coexisted. If he could handle it well, the benefits would be huge.

Without the Taixu xuanqing formation, Xia ruofei would not even dare to think about subduing an Aurous core stage cultivator. But now that he had a natural formation and had gone through the test today, Xia ruofei was even more confident. In addition, he had two spies who were absolutely loyal to him. With a good plan, it was not impossible to take down the Aurous core stage cultivator Luo Qingfeng!
