Xia ruofei’s attacks were getting stronger and stronger. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were watching the battle from the side, were also amazed. They rarely saw Xia ruofei in real combat.

After seeing Xia ruofei today, he suddenly felt that Xia ruofei was really extraordinary.

Especially Song Wei. She had a psychological trauma towards this spirit. Now that she saw the fierce spirit being completely suppressed by Xia ruofei and it was only a matter of time before it lost, her admiration for Xia ruofei could not be any greater.

As the attack circle further shrank, the spirit body became more and more stretched.

A sharp glint flashed in Xia ruofei’s eyes as he increased the speed of his attack. The blue immortal sword and the qushuang flying sword were like swimming Dragons as they attacked the spirit body. His palm, which was filled with vital Qi, turned into countless shadows, completely blocking the spirit body’s escape.

The spirit body’s eyes revealed a look of despair.

Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed with killing intent. It was time to end this one – sided battle.

At this time, the spirit body had no space to Dodge at all, and the blue travel immortal sword was directly slashing at the spirit body’s neck from a strange angle.

Although a spirit body didn’t have a physical body, a sharp flying sword infused with vital Qi could cause fatal damage to it.

Pffft!

The figure that was transformed from the spirit body was cut open from the neck by the blue travel immortal sword, and his head almost fell off.

The flying sword of qushuang followed closely behind, whistling down from above.

At this time, the spirit body had no time to Dodge. The flying sword of qushuang directly pierced through the Spirit body’s head, almost piercing through it.

The spirit body was stunned. Its eyes were filled with disbelief. It couldn’t believe that it had suffered for more than two hundred years in exchange for such a cowardly ending.

Just as qushuang’s flying sword pierced through the Spirit’s head, Xia ruofei heard two voices in unison.”Stop! Don’t kill it!”

However, the sound came too late. Even Xia ruofei could not stop in time. Otherwise, he might have suffered from the backlash.

He only had time to slightly slow down the speed of the flying sword.

However, this was far from enough. The flying sword of bent frost still pierced through the Spirit body’s heart.

If it was an ordinary cultivator, they would have died on the spot under the attack of these two swords.

After all, a spirit body didn’t have a physical body. Therefore, although it was severely injured, it didn’t die immediately.

At this time, the spirit body had completely given up on dodging. It just stood there in a daze. Its life force was dissipating at an extremely fast speed, and its vision was finally gradually darkening…

After a while, the spirit body fell to the ground.

At this moment, Xia ruofei finally came back to his senses. He recalled the two voices that had transmitted to him to stop him from killing the spirit body.

He was very familiar with the two voices.

One of them was master Yuntai, who was staying in the mountain and sea realm of Xia ruofei’s spirit map space.

Actually, layman Yuntai was also in the state of a pure spirit body. He was currently living in the mysterious ore that Xia ruofei had placed in the mountain and sea realm.

However, this guy would go into seclusion to cultivate from time to time. The last time he appeared was in the mystic Luna realm. It could be said that he was a Dragon that moved about and never appeared. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A look of despair gradually appeared on the spirit body’s face. At the same time, it was also filled with a trace of unwillingness. It dodged frantically while shouting,””Junior! Don’t you go too far! If I was at my peak back then, killing you would be as easy as killing chickens and dogs!”

This spirit body was at least in the middle Yuanying stage. However, after losing its physical body, it focused on cultivating the spirit body, and its strength was greatly reduced. However, it was difficult for ordinary late Jindan cultivators to defeat it.

Unfortunately, its opponent was Xia ruofei. With his purplish – Gold golden core and his spiritual power, which was comparable to that of a mid – Stage nascent soul cultivator, he had completely suppressed the spiritual body in the battle. There was no chance of him turning the tables.

Xia ruofei’s attack didn’t slow down. He sneered,””What’s the point of saying such harsh words? A real man doesn’t boast about his past achievements. The truth is that you are no match for me!”

“The Tiger is being bullied by the dog!” The spirit body shouted in exasperation.

“You think you’re worthy of being called a Tiger?” Xia ruofei laughed coldly.”A thing that only knows how to hide in the corner of the underground palace and secretly snatch people’s bodies! What’s the use of talking so much nonsense, let’s just fight!”

Xia ruofei’s attacks were getting stronger and stronger. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were watching the battle from the side, were also amazed. They rarely saw Xia ruofei in real combat.
