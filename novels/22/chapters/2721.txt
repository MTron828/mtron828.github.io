2722 Scheming against a golden core cultivator (2)

The two of them had no doubts about Xia ruofei’s arrangements. They only wanted to do their best to complete the task given by Xia ruofei. Even if they were to die, they would not hesitate.

Xia ruofei said, ” your main task this time is to get Luo Qingfeng to come to Peach Blossom Island. It’s best if he comes alone. Once you complete this, you’ll have completed more than half of your task. ” If possible, you can try to find out if the news of the natural formation of the Peach Blossom Island has spread beyond the three of you. Of course, this is only a secondary mission. For safety’s sake, you don’t have to deliberately inquire about it, in case Luo Qingfeng gets suspicious and affects our main mission.”

“Yes! Master!” Zheng Yongshou said.

” Luo Qingfeng, ” Xia ruofei continued. ” When you return to the sect and see Luo Qingfeng, tell him ...”

Xia ruofei gave Zheng Yongshou detailed instructions on how to report to Luo Qingfeng when he saw him. He even analyzed Luo Qingfeng’s possible reactions and gave his responses. At the same time, he handed him a small box that he had prepared in advance.

A cultivator’s memory was very good, so Zheng Yongshou hurriedly and diligently memorized Xia ruofei’s instructions.

In the end, Xia ruofei said, ” after all, we can’t exhaust all the possibilities. Luo Qingfeng might have a reaction that is beyond our expectations and ask you other questions. You have to grasp it yourself. In short, the first rule is to not make him suspicious. The second is to lure him to Peach Blossom Island as soon as possible. Everything will be based on these two rules. You need to adapt to the situation! ”

“Yes!”Zheng Yongshou replied with a serious expression. Don’t worry, master! ” Based on my understanding of palm ... Luo Qingfeng, master’s plan is very meticulous. He will definitely be fooled! If anything happens, I’ll be able to handle it.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,” yes!” Pay attention to your own safety.”

In fact, Xia ruofei was just casually reminding him. Only when Zheng Yongshou was safe would the plan go smoothly. Otherwise, if Zheng Yongshou was exposed, the follow-up plan could not be carried out.

However, after Zheng Yongshou heard Xia ruofei’s casual advice, he shed tears of gratitude and knelt on the ground again. He said in a trembling voice, ” “Thank you for your concern, master! This subordinate will not hesitate to shatter my bones!”

Not only did Wang Boshan not look down on him, but his face was full of anticipation. He felt that it was really enviable that junior uncle Zheng could get the care of his master.

This wasn’t because the two of them were wretches, but because this was the effect of the soul seal. This kind of submission from the soul was something that the two of them couldn’t control at all.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,” get up!” I don’t need you to die in vain, just do your best to complete the mission.”

“Yes! Master!” Zheng Yongshou stood up and said.

Then, Xia ruofei looked at Wang Boshan and said, ” ” As for your task, you will have to wait on the Peach Blossom Island. When Luo Qingfeng lands on the island, you will have to complete the following tasks ...”

Xia ruofei explained Wang Boshan’s mission in detail again. Compared to Zheng Yongshou, Wang Boshan’s mission was much simpler, and he finished explaining in a short while.

Wang Boshan naturally remembered Xia ruofei’s words and said, ” “Yes! Master!”

Xia ruofei’s arrangement was also in line with the current situation. Wang Boshan was originally in charge of the star Seizer sect’s secular Affairs. This time, he would stay behind to guard the Peach Blossom Island and wait for the sect leader’s arrival. Zheng Yongshou, who had a higher position, would return to the sect and report to him. This was more logical.

After arranging their tasks, Xia ruofei asked casually,””By the way, based on your judgment, if Luo Qingfeng were to come to Peach Blossom Island, what kind of transportation would he choose?”

There were only two options to get to Peach Blossom Island. One was to take a plane, and the other was to take a boat. Now that all the staff on Peach Blossom Island had been dismissed, Zheng Yongshou would also report to Qingfeng Luo in the same way, so they could only take a boat or a helicopter. If they could make a prediction in advance, they could make the corresponding arrangements, which would be more active.

Zheng Yongshou said almost without thinking,””It’s very likely that they’re going there by boat. Qingfeng Luo was rather repulsed by means of transportation such as airplanes. This was because he felt that he could not control his own fate when he was not flying with his own strength. If he was alone, he might have chosen to come from nearby on Sword 2, but since I’m with him, he might choose to take the boat. ”

Luo Qingfeng was an Aurous core stage cultivator and was already capable of sword Kinesis flight. However, the star Seizer sect was tens of thousands of miles away from here, so he definitely could not fly on his sword directly from the star Seizer sect.

“If he took a ship from the star Seizer sect, wouldn’t it take a few days?” Xia ruofei frowned.

From the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere, and the distance was so long, it was normal to take one or two months by ocean ship. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s possible according to my understanding of him,”said Zheng Yongshou. However, he should be in a hurry. I’ll try to persuade him to take a plane to a nearby Island ...”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””That’s a real problem! This way, many things would become uncontrollable ... How about this! Didn’t Luo Qingfeng never go to Paradise Island? He’ll definitely need you to lead the way. No matter what mode of transportation he uses, you just have to adapt to the situation. Also, you have to find a way to keep in touch with us. “
