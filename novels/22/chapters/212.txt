Chapter 213: Chapter 209 – the young master’s mannerisms

[Last chapter of September, a 3000 – Word chapter.] In the room. The three of them sat on the sofa in silence. Secretary Xiao was a little reserved. She hadn’t been working for Tian Huilan for long, and this was the first time she had experienced such a big scene. Tian Huilan, on the other hand, looked a little worried. From the moment she found out that the person in charge of the medical team was Liang Haitao, she had been very pessimistic about the prospects of this trip. She wasn’t worried about her political future. Elder song had a deep relationship with her family. She just wanted to do her best. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have asked Xia ruofei to help her. It was a big risk to ask Xia ruofei to save her. Moreover, Tian Huilan was a vice – provincial level cadre and a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee. She already had her own Foundation, so it wasn’t easy for others to suppress her. She was completely worried about elder song’s safety. On the other hand, Xia ruofei was the calmest. He leaned back on the sofa with a relaxed expression and closed his eyes. It wasn’t that Xia ruofei didn’t care about old song. On the contrary, Xia ruofei was full of respect for the idol of countless soldiers. When he heard that he was the patient on the plane, Xia ruofei had already made up his mind to save elder song’s life no matter what. Since he had already made up his mind, there was nothing to consider. It didn’t matter whether the medical group agreed or not, or even if manager Lu failed to bring him to elder song, it didn’t matter. Xia ruofei was very confident in his own skills. He knew very well that the security of the senior leaders was tight on the outside and loose on the inside. They were surrounded by an iron bucket on the outside and were impregnable. The internal defense was mainly made up of a few elite forces. The Reconnaissance Company of the Army Corps was indeed a powerful force. However, in front of the elite member of the lone wolf assault team, Xia ruofei, it was still not enough. Especially since Xia ruofei had absorbed so many petals of the exotic flower, his skills were more than twice as strong as when he was in the Army. Most importantly, Xia ruofei only needed a few seconds to save elder song’s life. He was confident that he could do it even if he had to face soldiers with loaded guns. Hence, at this moment, Xia ruofei was completely calm. Just like before he carried out his mission in the Army, he closed his eyes and rested his mind. He did not think about anything else. The three of them didn’t have to wait long before someone knocked on the door. Manager Lu pushed the door open and walked in. Tian Huilan suddenly stood up and asked,””Manager Lu, how’s the coordination going?” “Secretary Tian, director Liang is making a ward round in elder song’s room. We’ll have to wait for a while,” manager Lu said. “Oh, sorry for the trouble ...” Tian Huilan said. “Secretary Tian, you’re too kind. It’s all for the chief!” Manager Lu said politely. At this moment, major Xu Wu walked over from the room next door with a fax in his hand. He first looked at Xia ruofei with a strange and curious look. Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and quickly thought of the reason. In the information provided by Tian Huilan, Xia ruofei’s military service resume only had a unit code and nothing special. However, when Xu Wu checked the information, he could get more detailed information. This major was obviously elder song’s personal guard. If he was not mistaken, he should be under the National Guard Bureau. With his authority, he naturally had access to more core secrets. Xia ruofei’s service history in the lone wolf assault team was not a secret to him. He could easily find out. From Xu Wu’s strange look, she could tell that he must have found out about Xia ruofei’s military service experience. He even knew about the life – and – Death battles that Xia ruofei had experienced in the sealed files. Xu Wu handed the fax to manager Lu and said in a clear voice,””Director, the information has been checked. Xia ... Doctor Xia has no problems, but ...” “But what?” Manager Lu asked with a frown. “You should see for yourself!” Xu Wu then handed the fax to manager Lu. Manager Lu took the fax and looked at it suspiciously, and the surprise on his face became more and more obvious. Finally, he looked up at Xia ruofei and said,””Doctor Xia, I didn’t expect you to have such a rich military service resume ...” “Manager Lu, is there a problem?” Tian Huilan asked, slightly nervous. “Oh, there’s no problem,” Manager Lu said kindly,”however, Dr. Xia’s resume is confidential, so I’m sorry I can’t let you have a look ...” Tian Huilan looked at Xia ruofei in surprise and said,””It’s okay, as long as little Xia’s Political Review doesn’t have any problems. ” Manager Lu nodded and then asked,””Dr. Xia, I didn’t see any medical practice in your resume. Also, you don’t seem to have a formal medical qualification certificate ...” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve never been to a Chinese medical Academy. I learned my medical skills from my master. I’ve been serving in the Army all these years. I didn’t get a medical qualification certificate.” “Manager Lu, although Xiao Xia doesn’t have a medical license, I’ve seen his medical skills with my own eyes. I can guarantee that ...” Tian Huilan quickly said. “I know, this ... It’s okay ...” Manager Lu said with a bitter smile. In his opinion, it didn’t matter if Xia ruofei had a medical license or not. Liang Haitao would never allow anyone to touch his business, not to mention that Xia ruofei was such a young Chinese medicine practitioner. Liang Haitao hated Chinese medicine the most. He thought that it was witchcraft to trick people. Just as they were talking, footsteps came from the corridor and a few people in white coats walked over. Soon, they arrived at the door of the room. One of the doctors, who was in his early thirties, stopped in his tracks and casually swept his gaze over Tian Huilan and the others. “Director Liang, are you done with the ward round?” manager Lu greeted him. So, this was the leader of the medical team, Liang Haitao. Xia ruofei glanced at him and saw that director Liang’s face was white and clean. He wore a pair of rimless glasses and his hair was smooth and shiny. In all fairness, Liang Haitao’s looks were considered rather handsome. However, Xia ruofei felt that he had a feminine aura about him, especially his eyes, which gave people an uncomfortable feeling. Liang Haitao nodded slightly and asked,””Manager Lu, who are these people?” “Oh, director Liang, let me introduce you,” manager Lu said quickly.”This is comrade Tian Huilan, a member of the Standing Committee of the southeast Provincial Party Committee and the Secretary of the Sanshan Provincial Committee. Secretary Huilan, this is the head of the Bureau chief’s specialist medical Group, director Liang Haitao.” Tian Huilan revealed an elegant smile and nodded at Liang Haitao.””Hello, director Liang,” Liang Haitao didn’t expect the woman in front of him, who seemed to have taken good care of herself, to be a Deputy Provincial Minister. He restrained his arrogance and said,””Oh, it’s Secretary Tian. Hello!” “Director Liang, how’s the chief?” manager Lu asked. Liang Haitao frowned,”not too optimistic!” This kind of cancer has already spread throughout the body, and the prognosis is very bad. Moreover, due to the influence of the cancer cells, the chief ... Has already shown signs of organ failure in many organs ...” “Director Liang, is there any other way?” manager lü asked, his face darkened. “From a medical perspective, the Bureau chief’s condition has entered an irreversible state ...” Liang Haitao shook his head. Manager Lu already knew the answer, but he still couldn’t help but look sad. He hesitated for a moment before making up his mind and saying,””Director Liang, this is Mr. Xia, a doctor that Secretary Tian personally brought here. I would like to ask him to do another examination for the chief!” Liang Haitao was stunned when he heard that. He stared at manager Lu for a few seconds, then looked at Xia ruofei before saying,””Manager Lu, are you sure you’re not joking with me?” “Director Liang, I’m very serious.” Manager Lu said,”with the chief’s current condition, it can’t be any worse. Doctor Xia has some experience in treating liver cancer, so I hope he can do a check for the chief.” Manager Lu didn’t dare to say the word “Chinese medicine” from the start because he knew about the feud between Liang Haitao and the Chinese medicine industry. “Nonsense!” Liang Haitao rebuked angrily,”do you think it’s child’s play to examine and treat the chief? Then what’s the point of having our Specialist Group?” Manager Lu was already a director and was elder song’s personal secretary, but Liang Haitao didn’t give him any face at all. He spoke as if he was lecturing a subordinate. Obviously, this person’s emotional intelligence was very low. Of course, it could not be ruled out that he was certain that elder song’s illness could not be cured and that manager Lu was destined to retire from politics. That was why he dared to be so presumptuous. Manager Lu’s face couldn’t help but sink, no matter how well – mannered he was.””Director Liang, I’m not denying the work of the specialist Group. The current situation is that the specialist Group doesn’t have a good treatment plan. Why can’t you let doctor Xia try it?” Liang Haitao snorted coldly and said,”give it a try?” Who do you think elder song is? Ah? Could any random cat or dog come up and try? The Bureau chief’s health care has a set of systems. As elder song’s personal secretary, you should know about this, right?” Tian Huilan couldn’t help but furrow her brows. She had heard of the Liang family’s young master’s actions, but seeing it with her own eyes today, she realized that the rumors were just too exaggerated. Xia ruofei was brought here by her personally. Liang Haitao was not giving her any face by calling her a nobody in front of her. “Director Liang, do you mean that I, Tian Huilan, have deliberately sent people here to murder elder song?” she said in a cold voice. “I wouldn’t dare,” Liang Haitao replied coldly.”Secretary Tian would never have the intention to harm elder song, but he might be deceived!” Then, Liang Haitao stared at Xia ruofei with a dark look and asked condescendingly,””Which medical school did you graduate from? Who was the teacher? Which hospital do you work in now?”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
