“Mr. Xia, how many did you win?” Yu mingdong asked with a smile as he walked.

Until now, he still treated Xia ruofei as a newbie who did not know anything about stone gambling. This newbie might be rich, but in this public bid where there were so many experts, even if he won, it would probably be a blind cat’s luck or he would only get one or two raw stones that did not look good.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Let me see ... If I’m not mistaken, it should be eight pieces!”

“Oh, eight pieces, not bad ...” Yu mingdong said casually, then his eyes widened and he shouted,”what? Eight pieces! You actually managed to hit eight ...”

Then, Yu mingdong asked nervously,””How much is it in total?”

“Not much, about 12 million!” Xia ruofei said casually,”there are still a few raw stones that I didn’t manage to get!”

Actually, Xia ruofei had only invested these eight Yuan, but he had to say it!

Yu mingdong was a little dumbfounded and a little worried at the same time. Many of the raw stones on the public bid were uncertain. Even he didn’t dare to make a decision easily, so he hired He Ping as a consultant with a high salary.

It was no exaggeration to say that even a Jade merchant like him, who had been in the business for many years, could lose everything here if he was not careful.

Previously, when Xia ruofei said that he had invested more than 20 million, Yu mingdong was only a little surprised. After all, he might not win even if he invested, so he did not say much.

But now that he had actually won, he would have to pay real money!

That was 12 million Yuan!

Yu mingdong felt that Xia ruofei probably didn’t understand the tricks behind this, so he invested an outrageous high price. That was why he could win the bid among so many people in the industry.

If Xia ruofei were to lose a few million at the public bid, it would be hard for Yu mingdong to explain to Ma Zhiming!

Yu Ming Dong suddenly felt a headache.

“Mr. Xia, which raw gemstones did you choose?” he asked urgently.

Although Zhongdu had won and it was too late to say anything, Yu mingdong still wanted to understand the situation. To be precise, he wanted to evaluate Xia ruofei’s losses.

Xia ruofei told her the serial numbers of the raw gemstones that he had won the bid for.

Among these eight raw stones, the first seven were very unremarkable, and there were thousands of raw stones of various sizes in the entire public bid. Yu mingdong naturally had no impression of these numbers.

However, when Xia ruofei reported the number of the eighth raw stone, No. 1896, his eyes could not help but shine.

“So you got number 1896!” Yu mingdong said,”if I remember correctly, the winning bid was 8.6 million Yuan!”

This raw stone was also the focus of Yu mingdong’s attention. However, after many comparisons with He Ping, he felt that the possibility of a big increase was not high. He Ping believed that number 633 had more potential.

Although No. 633’s starting price was higher and the competition was more intense, Yu mingdong still decided to take a gamble in the end. In the end, he got his wish and won the raw stone at a price of 21.35 million.

As for whether it was a profit or a loss, Xia ruofei was the only one who knew.

Yu mingdong thought about it. Number 1896 was not bad. The price of 8.6 million was much higher than he had expected. After he had discussed with He Ping, he felt that 7 million was the upper limit. If it went any higher, there would be no profit. In addition, the competition was more intense, so he gave up.

But in any case, it was unlikely that this raw stone would suffer a huge loss. Even if he was unlucky, according to the current performance of this raw stone, he should be able to get an Imperial Jade worth three to four million Yuan.

When he thought of this, Yu mingdong also heaved a sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei said that he won eight pieces for a total of 12 million. However, this number 1896 had already cost him 8.6 million for one piece. This meant that the other pieces were very cheap. Even if he lost all of them, he would not lose much.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yup! I thought this raw stone was good at first glance, and I saw that many people were interested in it, so I simply set a higher price. I didn’t expect to really win!”

Yu mingdong was speechless. This was more than eight million Yuan, not eight hundred Yuan! He didn’t understand stone gambling at all and had actually placed his bid so casually.

However, it was already a foregone conclusion. Xia ruofei seemed to be quite happy, so he probably wouldn’t go back on his word. Besides, even if he lost money, it wouldn’t be a big loss. Yu mingdong didn’t say anything more.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that he had already become a silly but rich second generation in Yu mingdong’s heart.

The two of them walked to an empty Service Desk.

At this time, many people who won the bid had already come over to pay and hand over the goods. The staff was also busy shuttling back and forth in the raw gemstones display area.

When Xia ruofei and Xia Xiaofei arrived, a good – looking staff member immediately welcomed them with a smile.

Xia ruofei first showed the second couplet of the eight biddings. After the staff checked it on the computer, he immediately smiled and said,””Sir, congratulations on winning the bid. I also wish that the number of raw stones you buy will increase greatly!”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei said and asked,”can I use my card?”

“Of course, please wait a moment!” The staff member said. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She quickly calculated the total amount of the transaction and took the bank card from Xia ruofei. She swiped the card swiftly. Xia ruofei entered the password and signed. Twelve million was spent without even blinking.

“Please wait for a moment. Our staff will send your raw stone over very soon.”
