Xia ruofei packed up his tools and left the spirit map space. He didn’t need to do anything else. All he had to do was wait for the Phoebe zhennan material to decompose naturally in the space. When Liang Qichao’s grandfather returned to the country, he would take it out and sell it. After Xia ruofei left the medium, he went to the bathroom to take a shower. He washed away all the wood shavings and dust, changed into clean cotton home clothes, and walked out refreshed. He sat leisurely on the deck chair on the balcony and lit a cigarette. Night had fallen, and the entire farm was quiet. Only the street lights gave off a gentle light, making the farm seem even more quiet. Xia ruofei took out his phone and dialed Ling Qingxue’s number. “Ruofei ...” Ling Qingxue’s voice was full of joy when she received Xia ruofei’s call. “Wife, did you miss me?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. Ling Qingxue lowered her eyes and said,”you’re shouting again!” I’m not going to talk to you if you continue to be so glib – tongued!” “Eh? How do you know my tongue is slippery and my mouth is oily?” Xia ruofei asked curiously,”could it be that you’ve been thinking about it ever since you tasted it last time?” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”Hey!” You’re getting more and more ridiculous!” Xia ruofei imagined the long – legged Beauty’s shy look and couldn’t help but feel his heart flutter. After the two of them exchanged a few sweet words, Xia ruofei finally asked,””Qingxue, is your dad free these two days? I want to pay a visit!” “Ah? You’re coming in two days?” Ling Qingxue was a little surprised.”Didn’t you say that you were going to look for the Blood Red Dragon?” “Naturally, I’ve already found it!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”otherwise, how would I have the confidence to meet my future father – in – Law?” Ling Qingxue’s face heated up, and she hesitated for a moment before saying,””But ... I haven’t told my dad about us ...” “Is that so ...” Xia ruofei was slightly stunned, but he quickly smiled and said,”then there’s no hurry! Let me know when you can visit. I’ll keep these two Blood Dragons for now!” “Ruofei, I’ve been too busy with work recently, and my father isn’t in the office either, so ...” Ling Qingxue explained hurriedly. “I’m fine! There’s no rush for this kind of thing. ” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”Qingxue, if there’s nothing else, you should rest early!” “...” Ling Qingxue wanted to say something but stopped herself. In the end, she said,”alright, good night!” …… Qingjiang villa district. In a mansion by the river, Ling Qingxue sat cross – legged on the soft princess bed in her pink cotton pajamas. She held her phone with a slight frown on her face, then got out of bed. Her white feet stepped on the cold floor, but she didn’t notice. Ling Qingxue stared blankly at the min river’s fishing fire outside the window, her mind constantly recalling the scene from the call just now. Xia ruofei did not say anything, but Ling Qingxue could feel his disappointment. This was not because Xia ruofei’s tone was different from usual. It was purely Ling Qingxue’s woman’s intuition. She stood there in a daze for a long time before she finally made up her mind and quickly walked to the door. But she immediately came back, put on the cotton Slippers by the bed, and then opened the door and went downstairs. In the living room on the first floor, Ling Xiaotian was sitting alone in front of the carved tea table and making Kung Fu Tea. The news was being broadcasted on the 110 – inch LCD TV. Hearing the sound of footsteps, Ling Xiaotian raised his head and looked over. With a smile, he asked,””Qingxue, what’s the matter?” Ling Qingxue quietly walked over to the sofa opposite Ling Xiaotian and sat down. She crossed her legs and grabbed a pillow before saying,””Dad, I don’t want to go to the dinner tomorrow ...” Ling Xiaotian’s brows raised as he gently put down the teacup in his hand. He looked at Ling Qingxue and asked,””Why? Didn’t we agree to meet up first? If you don’t like it, I won’t force you. ” “No reason, I just don’t want to go.” Ling Qingxue said, frowning. “You child ...” Ling Xiaotian said helplessly,”I’ve already promised him. It’s not good to break the promise at the last minute, right? Besides, I’ve met Secretary Lin’s son before. He’s a man of striking appearance, and he’s polite to everyone he meets. He doesn’t seem like the kind of rich Playboy. Just take it as making a friend!” “Dad, you’re the one who agreed to the other party, not me!” Ling Qingxue’s voice was a little agitated.”Did you ask for my opinion on this? Tell me when everything is settled. Have you ever respected my choice?” Ling Xiaotian furrowed his brows and said,”Qingxue, dad is doing this for your own good. I wouldn’t harm you, would I?” Besides, I’m not forcing you to marry Lin Feng! You’re not young anymore, shouldn’t you consider your personal problems? A girl’s youth is very short!” “Dad, I told you that you don’t have to worry about my relationship problems. I can handle it myself.” Ling Qingxue said,”but you always like to arrange this and that for me, always using your standards to judge. In the past, he Dong was like this, and now, Lin Feng is also like this. When will you consider my feelings?” “Qingxue, I’ve taken he Dong’s matter for granted ...” Ling Xiaotian said awkwardly.”But Lin Feng is different! He graduated from a famous university, and his father is a high – Level leader with real power. He’s a good match for our family ...” “I don’t want to hear this!” Ling Qingxue frowned and said,”dad, I’ll tell you the truth! I already have a boyfriend!” Ling Xiaotian was stunned. He opened his mouth slightly and stared at Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue did not avoid his gaze. The father and daughter just looked at each other. After a long while, Ling Xiaotian asked,”when did this happen?” How come I didn’t know about it?” “It’s only recently!” Ling Qingxue said,”you know my boyfriend too. He’s Xia ruofei from paradise Corporation!” Since she had already laid all her cards on the table with her father, Ling Qingxue might as well not hide anything and directly say it. “What? It’s little Xia?” Ling Xiaotian cried out,”Qingxue, how ... How could it be him?” “Why not him? We were junior high school classmates!” Ling Qingxue said frankly,”although we haven’t seen each other for a few years, after our reunion this time, we both have feelings for each other, so it’s only natural that we get together!” Ling Qingxue then looked at Ling Xiaotian and asked,””Dad, don’t tell me you’re upset that RUO Fei isn’t as rich as we are?” “That’s not it ...” Ling Xiaotian said awkwardly,”it’s just that I feel that it’s a little sudden ...” In fact, Ling Xiaotian was a little disappointed. It was true that he attached great importance to Xia ruofei. That was because Xia ruofei’s peach blossom vegetables was of great significance to Ling’s restaurant at this stage. In Ling Xiaotian’s heart, he naturally regarded Xia ruofei as a very important business partner. However, if he were to be his future son – in – Law, Ling Xiaotian would subconsciously reject him. After all was said and done, it was still the idea of being well – matched in social status that was causing trouble. Although Ling Xiaotian was aware of Xia ruofei’s business development, Xia ruofei’s paradise Corporation was pitifully small when compared to Ling Ji F & B. His assets were not even a fraction of Ling Ji F & B ‘s. Of course, Ling Xiaotian would not voice out his thoughts in front of Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”dad, since you don’t despise RUO Fei, that means ... You agree to our relationship?” In that case, I don’t have to attend tomorrow’s social event, right?” Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment. He stared into Ling Qingxue’s eyes and asked,””No... Qingxue, you’re not using Xiao Xia as your shield to avoid the blind date, are you?”
