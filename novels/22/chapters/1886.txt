Cheng Xiaoxiao didn’t understand why Bastian was doing this, but she was still proud that her idol was so respected.

Soon, the dishes she had ordered for Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were ready.

When Cheng Xiaoxiao served the dishes for the two of them, she also served the authentic Burgundian snail and the precious bottle of Marquis Wang dry red wine that Bastian had given them.

“Mr. Xia, Mr. Ling, this is a gift from manager Bastian!” Cheng Xiaoxiao placed the Burgundian snail and red wine on the table and said,”I wish you a Happy Meal!”

Cheng Xiaoxiao had a good grasp of the situation. After opening the red wine for the two of them, she quietly retreated.

She knew that she had already disturbed the two of them when she asked Xia ruofei for an autograph and a photo. Now, she definitely could not disturb their meal.

Of course, Cheng Xiaoxiao didn’t go far. She just kept a close eye on Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue to make sure that she would be there at the first moment if they needed anything.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue enjoyed an authentic French meal. After paying the bill and preparing to leave, Bastian appeared and handed over his business card with both hands.”Mr. Xia, thank you for patronizing corner restaurant. This is my business card. Please call me directly the next time you need to eat. Corner restaurant will always have a seat for you!”

Xia ruofei took the name card and kept it. He smiled and said,””Okay, thank you, Mr. Bastian!”

He did not give Bastian his business card, and Bastian did not take it to heart.

In Bastian’s eyes, Xia ruofei’s status was naturally much higher than his. How could Xia ruofei’s contact information be given to others so easily? It was normal that she didn’t give him her business card!

Bastian did not expect to make friends like Xia ruofei. He only hoped to make a good relationship and make Xia ruofei have a good impression of him. That was enough.

Xia ruofei drove Ling Qingxue back to the company. On the way, Ling Qingxue smiled and said,””Ruofei, that manager really values you! Food and wine were delivered, and it was actually a 1990’s Marquis uncle Wang dry red wine! The cost of a meal can’t even compare to the price of a glass of wine!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m being polite. I must have something to ask for!”

“What does he need from you?” Ling Qingxue asked curiously.

“You’re also in the gastronomic industry, how could you not have thought of it?”Xia ruofei chuckled.

Ling Qingxue suddenly understood.”You’re saying ... Bastian is hoping to buy some top – grade ingredients from the Paradise Corporation. For example ... The top – grade truffle you were talking about?” she asked.

“I guess so!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but he was too embarrassed to say it!”

“But aren’t your truffles all auctioned in Hong Kong?” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion,”aren’t auctions for the highest bidder? What’s the point of having a good relationship with you?”

“We can’t all be top – grade truffles that can be auctioned, right?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the lighter ones may not be up to the standard of the auction, but they are still very precious ingredients for Western restaurants!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Oh! I understand, I understand!” Ling Qingxue said. Then, she smiled and asked,”ruofei, you couldn’t have been bribed by a bottle of wine, right?”

“What do you think?” Xia ruofei laughed.

“It definitely won ‘t!” Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and smiled.”Our President Xia runs a winery himself! By the way, the sweet wine that you asked me to bring back a few days ago, my dad praised it after drinking it!”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei said,”if uncle Ling likes it, I’ll give him a few more bottles next time! It’s good for middle – aged and elderly people to drink one or two glasses of this expensive rotten wine every day. I heard that it can soften blood vessels!”

“Mm! I won’t tell him yet! To prevent him from overdosing again!” Ling Qingxue said,”there’s only two bottles now, and he’ll drink it sparingly!”

“Hahaha! I’ll listen to you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if you need anything, just let me know in advance!”

The two of them chatted as they talked, and they soon arrived at the Ling Ji F & B headquarters.

“I’m leaving!” Ling Qingxue said,”be careful when you drive!”

Ling Qingxue got out of the car.

“Qingxue!” Xia ruofei leaned forward and asked,”are you coming back with me tonight? We haven’t done that in a few days ...”

Ling Qingxue’s face heated up immediately. She had not kept Xia ruofei’s voice low. If the security guards at the door heard her, her reputation as the president would be ruined ...

Ling Qingxue quickly walked to the pilot’s side and said in a low voice,””RUO Fei, do you want to die? Why are you speaking so loudly?”

Xia ruofei said innocently,”I ... What’s there to be ashamed of?” I’m saying that we haven’t cultivated together for a few days. You can’t say this so loudly, right?”

“You mean cultivation?” Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened.

“Of course ... What did you think?” Xia ruofei asked. Then, he deliberately exaggerated a look of sudden realization and pointed at Ling Qingxue.”You didn’t think it was ... That, did you? My dear wife, I find that your thoughts are getting more and more dirty!”

Ling Qingxue flew into a rage out of humiliation. She kicked the car door and said,””You deliberately misled me! Why are you so bad!”

After that, Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and turned around to walk back to the company.
