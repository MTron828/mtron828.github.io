Chapter 390: Chapter 358 – quietly spreading_1

At the thought of how she had eaten dog food just now and how she had eaten a few pieces and seemed to be eating them with great relish, Lu You could not help but feel her stomach churn and she could not help but vomit ...

She covered her mouth and retched, but nothing came out. Soon, her eyes were full of tears.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”miss Lu, you don’t have to be so touched.” Lightning wouldn’t mind sharing it with you. ”

Lu You’s eyes were about to burst into flames. She glared at Xia ruofei.

At this moment, she saw the evil smile on Xia ruofei’s face and suddenly felt that something was wrong. She reached out to grab the bag of biscuits that she had thrown on the coffee table and looked at it carefully.

Lu You was fuming with anger. She gritted her teeth and glared at Xia ruofei.”This is just an ordinary cookie. How is this dog food?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“When did I say this is dog food?” Xia ruofei tried to hold back his laughter.

“You clearly said that it was Lightning’s mouth ...” Lu You said angrily.

At this point, Lu You suddenly stopped. She realized that she had fallen into Xia ruofei’s trap.

Xia ruofei also laughed and said,””Yup! Food! I only said that it was Lightning’s food, but I didn’t say that it was dog food! I usually feed lightning with these biscuits! It also likes orange – flavored ones. The one you have is strawberry – flavored, which is why it’s still here ...”

“Nonsense!” Lu You said angrily,”who feeds a dog biscuits that humans eat?”

Xia ruofei sighed and looked up at the sky ... No, the ceiling at a 45 – degree angle. He said indifferently,””I can’t help it. I’m so rich ... I’m just so willful!”

Lu You almost spat out a mouthful of blood. She finally came back to her senses and said angrily,””Xia ruofei, you’re playing me!”

Xia ruofei said innocently,”I swear to God!” I was just giving you a casual reminder, but you’re the one who reacted so strongly ...”

Lu You was so angry that she laughed coldly and said,””Xia ruofei, I ... I’ll tell sister Qingxue. I’ll say ... I’ll say that you touched and harassed me!”

“Please! It would be a wonder if Qingxue would believe this kind of nonsense!” Xia ruofei scoffed.

Lu You gritted her teeth and said,”Hmph!” Then ... Then I’ll say that you took the initiative to give Yueyue Jade Flower cakes ...”

“It’s jaded skin cream! “How many times have I corrected you ...” Xia ruofei was speechless for a while. Then, he came to his senses and widened his eyes.”What did you just say?” I’ll give it to Jiang Yue?”

Lu You raised her chin proudly and said,””Right! I’ll tell sister Qingxue this! Hmph, I’ll tell her that in order to give Yueyue the Jade Flower ... Jade skin cream, you even bribed me with a set. There’s both witnesses and evidence!”

After saying that, Lu You even patted the Tupperware in her bag.

Xia ruofei wanted to cry, but no tears came out. You’re the one who begged me to make a few for you, and I’m just asking you to bring one for Jiang Yue as well. How can you distort the truth?”

“Then we’ll see whose words sister Xue believes ...” Lu You curled her lips and smiled.

Xia ruofei really did not dare to take the risk. If this matter involved Jiang Yue, Ling Qingxue’s intelligence would definitely drop. After all, Jiang Yue had a “past record”.

Although Xia ruofei did not know why Ling Qingxue was so close to Lu You and Jiang Yue, he knew that if Ling Qingxue were to hear anything about him and Jiang Yue, she would definitely be jealous.

“You can’t do this!” Xia ruofei said,”Lu You, let’s count it properly. That time on the plane, I also saved you once, right? And that day, you would be in pain for a few days every month. I was the one who cured you, right?”

Lu You blushed and said,””That’s all in the past, why are you bringing it up?”

“Alright, let’s not talk about the past. I was the one who cured you of that jade lion, right? “It’s only been a few days since that incident. I even helped you guys win the Gold Award and gave Agricultural University a hard slap in the face! Don’t tell me you’ve also forgotten?” Xia ruofei said with grief and indignation.

He continued,”and today, when you came to my place, I gave you a face mask and even treated you to a meal. You can’t bite the hand that feeds you!”

Lu You’s expression softened with every incident that Xia ruofei went through. Her heart was filled with warmth, and the past flashed in her mind like a movie.

When she heard Xia ruofei’s last sentence, she could not hold it in anymore and burst out laughing.”Who told you to make fun of me?”

Xia ruofei saw Lu You smiling and immediately said,””Since I’ve made you a sumptuous lunch, how about we call it even?”

Lu You glanced at the fragrant dishes on the table and her heart seemed to have been touched again. She pretended to be magnanimous and said,””Forget it, forget it, I won’t argue with you!”

Xia ruofei said happily,”that’s right!” When would revenge end? We should value peace! Hurry up and wash your hands! I’ll get old master Li and Ling Yun to come in!”

With that said, Xia ruofei quickly walked out of the villa. Lu You watched Xia ruofei’s back view from behind. Then, her gaze landed on the packet of biscuits on the coffee table and she could not help but giggle.

It was the weekend, so pang Hao did not come to work at the farm. Hence, Xia ruofei, Lu You, ye Lingyun, and Li Zhifu were the only ones having lunch.
