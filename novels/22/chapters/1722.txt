Chapter 1723: Tide of praise (1)

Huaxia daily was the most authoritative media in Huaxia. It could be said to be the mouthpiece of the country and one of the newspapers that must be ordered by the government at all levels. Many of the opinions in this newspaper often represented a certain direction.

Of course, in the era of new media, China Daily followed the trend and opened an official Weibo account, official WeChat official account, and headline number.

Unlike the paper media platform, China Daily’s new media account was more down – to – Earth. It basically didn’t have any serious viewing articles. The content pushed was more popular news, life tips, and so on. Sometimes, it even followed the trend of the times and was quite popular with the public.

In the field of WeChat Public Accounts, the official accounts of Huaxia daily, the official accounts of the National television station, and the official accounts of the youth groups were already big V accounts with tens of millions of fans. Articles with more than 100000 followers could be found everywhere, and their influence could be seen.

Although it wasn’t published in the paper version of Huaxia daily, it also represented a direction in a sense on WeChat.

As a result, the article titled “this Chinese man became the National hero of Australia” on the WeChat official account of ‘Huaxia daily’ was quickly spread by everyone. The number of views exceeded 100000 in just over an hour, and the number of shares also reached a few thousand.

The article wrote,”recently, Xia ruofei, a citizen of our country, helped the flight crew deal with a serious case on a flight from the capital to sutsune. He almost saved a plane and its passengers with his own strength.”

A few days ago, Air Australia had held a press conference and announced some details. The local media in Australia reported it and Xia ruofei became the main character of the news ...

The article pieced together the reports from the Australian media over the past two days. At the same time, it also highlighted some reflections on the prejudice against the Chinese, as well as some screenshots of online posts posted by the Chinese in Australia. Guo Xiaoxiao’s post was also cited a lot.

In the end, the article pointed out that in recent years, a few Chinese people did have some uncivilized behavior when they traveled overseas, and such behavior was deliberately magnified by some Western media, which affected the overall image of the Chinese. Even some tourist areas had discriminatory reminders against the Chinese.

We were happy to see that Xia ruofei’s heroic act had restored the image of the Chinese to a certain extent and offset some people’s prejudice.

“Here, we would like to appeal,” when we step out of the country, our words and actions will represent the image of our country. We hope that from today on, every Chinese overseas will have less uncivilized behavior. We also sincerely look forward to the emergence of more and more Xia ruofei in China. ”

Today, let’s give Xia ruofei a like!

Hundreds of the same comments appeared in a short while. In the middle, there were a few who deliberately posted other content, but all of them were likes.

Before this wave of enthusiasm died down, there were more new contents on the Tianya forum. Seeing that so many people had read and supported her post, and it had even made the Tianya headlines, Guo Xiaoxiao immediately went to find other reports about Xia ruofei.

Her hard work paid off, and she really found something very interesting.

It was the original video of the press conference, from the beginning to the end. It was a video of the entire process. Unlike the television media reports, this was without any cuts.

Guo Xiaoxiao had gotten the video from a reporter friend. She immediately treated it as a treasure and specially asked for half a day’s leave. She added subtitles in both Chinese and English to the video on her computer and then posted it on the Tianya forum.

Guo Xiaoxiao excitedly wrote,”the original video of the press conference is here!” Everyone, come and experience President Xia’s style! The entire exchange was in English! To be honest, President Xia is one of the few people I’ve seen who can speak English very fluently and almost without an accent. Friends who study English can use this video for listening training!

There were many onlookers.

“I’m finished, I’m finished, I’m going to become a fan as a passerby! President Xia’s self – confidence and sense of humor when he answers questions is so attractive!”

“I’ve only seen this feeling from one celebrity before, and that’s Yao Ming, who played in the NBA back then!”

“I heard that President Xia joined the Army after graduating from high school. How can his English be so good? I’m so ashamed now! I’ve wasted three years of my four years in college ...”

“Heavens! A passerby turned into a fan! President Xia is so charming!”

......

The comments were all about Xia ruofei.

At this moment, a sharp – eyed netizen posted a message. Then, many netizens who were drinking water and looking at their computers suddenly burst into laughter ...

The sharp – eyed netizen wrote,”I feel sorry for the translator at the scene. He sat there the whole morning in a daze, and his face was full of embarrassment ...”
