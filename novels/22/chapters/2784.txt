2785 The Army and the horses (2)

He couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. There was a reason why she was in such a good state!

As the players grew older, their physical condition would naturally decline. This was a natural physiological law. No one could resist it, unless they became a practitioner like Xia ruofei. In order for these older players to maintain their competitive form, they naturally needed to put in more effort and sweat than the younger players.

Not long after Xia ruofei arrived at the training ground, head coach Ruby arrived with his assistant coach.

Ruby knew that Xia ruofei was coming to the team training today. In order to leave a good impression on his boss, he came early. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be a few minutes earlier than him.

“Good Morning, Mr. Xia!” Ruby greeted him with great enthusiasm.

A few assistant coaches also greeted Xia ruofei.

It was also because of Xia ruofei’s special status. Otherwise, even if he was the boss of the changing room, he would not be treated so attentively by the coaching staff. After all, a player was a player.

Xia ruofei also greeted everyone with a smile.

At this moment, the running team had also arrived. Xia ruofei waved to everyone and joined the running team.

“Brother Xia! Good Morning!” Wu Lei greeted Xia ruofei as he ran.

“Hello, Mr. Xia!”

“Good Morning, Mr. Xia!”

Markeloka, Diego, and the others also greeted Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei replied to everyone as he ran with them.

While they were running their laps, the first team players arrived at the training ground one after another. There were still ten minutes before the assembly time, and everyone was already there.

After Xia ruofei and the others ran a few rounds, they started to prepare for the match.

Seeing that everyone had arrived, Ruby gestured to the assistant manager.

The assistant manager immediately blew the whistle and gathered everyone.

The players had already seen Xia ruofei and greeted him during the gathering.

It could be said that Xia ruofei had won the approval of the entire Spanish team in just half the game.

Putting aside his identity as the club owner, the Spanish players were also convinced of his skills.

Soon, the players gathered around. Ruby walked up to everyone and said in an excited tone,””Guys! As you can see, Mr. Xia has returned to the team in advance to help the team fight against Barcelona. He will play side by side with everyone in the weekend’s game! Let’s work hard to defeat Barca! From today on, Mr. Xia will be training with the team until the end of the weekend’s game! I hope everyone can get used to each other as soon as possible. You must cultivate your tacit understanding before the weekend’s game!”

Ruby looked at his watch and said,””There are some changes in today’s training content. We will be directly carrying out an internal team competition! I’ll be announcing the groups!”

Ruby didn’t plan to practice the formation so soon. He had planned to do some ball training and coordination training today. However, Xia ruofei’s participation gave him new ideas for the weekend’s competition. He immediately made targeted adjustments to the training content.

In Ruby’s opinion, Xia ruofei’s participation would undoubtedly greatly enhance the control of the midfield and the lethality of the front field. The only problem that needed to be solved was the problem of cooperation. After all, Xia ruofei had not trained with the team and had only played in the first half of the game. There was no tacit understanding between him and the other players of the Spanish team, which needed to be improved during training.

The purpose of organizing the internal competition was to simulate the atmosphere and rhythm of the game. More importantly, it was to let Xia ruofei and the players get used to each other as soon as possible through a certain intensity of the game.

Ruby didn’t know that Xia ruofei didn’t need to get used to everyone. He could use his strong spiritual power to cooperate with everyone. On the other hand, the other players needed some time to get used to Xia ruofei’s style. After all, they did not have much time to play together.

Soon, Ruby divided the two teams into two groups.

It could be seen from the grouping that the group in the orange Training Vest, which was Xia ruofei’s group, was mostly made up of the team’s main players, including goalkeeper Diego Lopez, defensive midfielder mark Roca, striker Wu Lei, glaxas, and so on.

Ruby had arranged for Xia ruofei to be the attacking midfielder. Of course, this was only the position in the formation. In fact, Xia ruofei had a high degree of freedom. He did not need to be fixed in a certain area and could play as he pleased.

Ruby hoped that Xia ruofei could hide behind Wu Lei and iglasias and become a Shadow Vanguard with assassination attributes.

After the groups were divided, everyone changed into the training vests of the corresponding color.

After the assistant manager who served as the referee blew the whistle, the team’s group confrontation officially began.

The strength of the main team was obviously stronger than that of the substitutes.

This was also a common phenomenon in small clubs, where the bench was not deep enough.

In the long season, once a player in a certain position was injured and absent, the replacement often could not reach the level of the main force.

After three passes and two passes in the backfield, the main team quickly passed through the midfield and passed the ball to Xia ruofei’s feet.

Xia ruofei took the opportunity to pull the ball and dodged the interception of the substitute’s defensive midfielder.

Although he had his head lowered, he was still using his spiritual power to sense the situation around him.

Xia ruofei realized that both Iglesia and Wu Lei were moving forward at a high speed. He immediately made a decisive move. If he had been a second or two later, Iglesia and Wu Lei would have run behind the opponent’s defensive line and be in an offside position.

Xia ruofei’s pass could be said to be perfect. It was high enough and not intercepted halfway. It was also very fast. It fell quickly not far in front of iglysias and Wu Lei. All the two had to do was to speed up and catch up.

Xia ruofei passed the ball to him because he could sense that iglesias ‘position was better.

As for Wu Lei, he wouldn’t make a wasted trip.

When he judged that the drop point was closer to Iglesia, he did not relax. Instead, he quickly changed direction and rushed into the penalty area. He was ready to grab the second drop point.

Iglasias comfortably took the ball and took a step forward into the penalty area.

He used a simple spike to avoid the substitute team members who were closing in on him from the right, and then raised his leg to shoot without hesitation.

It should be said that there was no problem with iglesias’s shooting footwork, and his movements were very smooth. The only regret was that luck was not on your side today.

His shot dodged the goalkeeper’s ten fingers, but it hit the intersection between the goalpost and the crossbar and bounced back.

Wu Lei had just rushed to the penalty spot and saw the football bounce back in his direction.

He did not hesitate to kick the ball with great force, and the football went into the net with a whoosh ... Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After the goal, Wu Lei gave Xia ruofei and iglysias a light high five to celebrate. Then, the three of them walked towards their own half with their arms around each other’s shoulders.

The team’s internal match lasted an hour, half an hour in the first and second half.

In the case of a relative disparity in strength, the players of the main team scored one goal after another in the first half.

Xia ruofei also took advantage of a free – kick and scored with a standard elevator ball.

...

In fact, if Xia ruofei wanted to, he could shoot from a position of about 30 meters, and his hit rate would not be low. However, he did not do so. Instead, he tried to make the ball for his teammates.

Xia ruofei also wanted to take this opportunity to let the players understand his playing style better. This would be beneficial for their cooperation in the game.

The referee assistant coach blew his whistle three times, and the internal match officially ended. The main team finally defeated the substitute team with a big score of seven to zero.

Xia ruofei, who was in a good mood, walked to the training ground while talking to the soldiers.
