Translator: 549690339

“I know.” Lu You smiled and said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Then, she waved at Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””Then I’ll go back! I’ll see you tomorrow!”

“See you tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Lu You looked at Xia ruofei and suddenly said,””Ruofei, thank you …”

“What’s there to thank me for? there’s no beginning or end to it…” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

“You and I both know this, so there’s no need to go into detail.” Lu You waved her hand and said,”I’m leaving. Goodbye!”

After saying that, Lu You turned around and left.

Xia ruofei stood at the door, dumbfounded. He watched as Lu You’s back gradually disappeared.

What did she know? He really couldn’t read a girl’s mind!

Xia ruofei decided to find a chance to ask Shen Hu what this guy had told Lu You.

On the way back, Lu You had a smile on her face.

Although Xia ruofei did not say anything, her answer was clear from his expression when they bade each other farewell at the door.

Lu You was in a very good mood.

After she was certain that the ‘golden core senior’ was Xia ruofei, she felt excited.

There was also a faint sense of happiness.

At the same time, she felt a sense of relief. From that day on, she had always felt a sense of pressure in her heart, because she didn’t know why the senior had helped her, and she didn’t know when the senior would suddenly appear. At the same time, she was also worried that she wouldn’t be able to meet the senior’s expectations.

If that person was Xia ruofei, there would be no problem.

Lu You had a smile on her face along the way, and all sorts of thoughts kept appearing in her mind.

She stepped into the courtyard where she lived and did not realize that Shen Hu was standing in the courtyard.

“Lu You, what have you been doing?” Shen Hu asked.

Lu You was shocked. She held her heart and said,””Teacher, why didn’t you say anything? you scared me to death …”

Shen Hu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”such a big person is standing in the courtyard and you can’t see him?” You can’t blame me for scaring you …” “No, no…” Lu You quickly said,”I was thinking about something just now! By the way, teacher, what did you say just now?”

“I’m asking you where you went,” Shen Hu said.

Lu You’s eyes flickered and she said,””I… I’m just going out for a walk!”

“You went to find … Mr. Xia, right?” Shen Hu stared at Lu You and asked.

Lu You smiled awkwardly and said,””I just happened to walk by his place, so I went in and chatted with him. We’re old friends!”

“Didn’t 1 tell you not to find him?”Shen Hu said anxiously. Why are you so disobedient? What did you and Mr. Xia talk about?”

“Nothing much! He told me about the past.” Lu You said.

Shen Hu knew that Lu You was not telling the truth, but he could not do anything about it.

This girl had Xia ruofei as her backer. Even he, the sect master of the water element sect, could not scold or beat Lu You. He even wanted to worship Lu You for the sake of that technique.

Therefore, if Lu You did not want to tell the truth, Shen Hu would not force her.

Shen Hu could only say,”the first heaven society’s rules are very strict, so don’t go outside if you don’t have anything important to do.” The spiritual energy here is rich, so you should cultivate more when you have the time!”

“I know, teacher!” Lu You replied obediently.

Shen Hu sighed inwardly and waved his hand,”You can go!”

“Mm! Teacher, I’ll go back to my room to cultivate first!” Lu You said.

Shen Hu looked at Lu You’s back and couldn’t help but feel a little worried. Should he go and find senior Xia to explain? However, he didn’t know what Lu You and Xia ruofei were talking about. How could he start explaining?

On the other hand, Shen Hu was thinking about whether he should explain to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei also wanted to ask Shen Hu what was going on.

Lu You was only a beginner Qi refinement cultivator. This made Xia ruofei and Shen Hu, a cultivator in the intermediate golden core stage and a cultivator in the ninth Qi refinement stage, a little worried.

In the end, Xia ruofei decided not to look for Shen Hu for the time being. Anyway, he did not want Lu You to have too much psychological burden. That was why he concealed his identity and went to help Lu You.

If Lu You really knew about it, it would be fine.

Hence, after Lu You left, Xia ruofei continued to cultivate the mystic origin Scripture. He spent the entire night and finally completed the sixth level of the “black origin Scripture”.

For an Aurous core stage cultivator to practice such a beginner level Foundation cultivation technique, the difficulty was indeed very, very low. There was also no bottleneck at all.

The next morning, Zeng Qing personally brought the handyman disciples to deliver breakfast to Xia ruofei.

While Xia ruofei was eating, Zeng Qing was waiting at the entrance of the restaurant.

Seeing that Xia ruofei had finished his breakfast, Zeng Qing quickly asked the service disciples to clean up the dishes.

He walked in front of Xia ruofei and said respectfully,””Senior Xia! Today, the sect leader will be giving a lecture to all the cultivators at the back mountain’s observation platform. It’s almost time, you see …”

“Then let’s go over too!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yes! This way please, senior Xia!” Zeng Qing quickly said.

Xia ruofei, accompanied by Zeng Qing, came to the grandstand at the back of the mountain.

Today was the day Chen Nanfeng, the only nascent Soul Stage cultivator in the cultivation world, gave a public lecture. Therefore, everyone’s enthusiasm was much higher than that day.

After all, observing a breakthrough could not bring about any substantial improvement. At most, it would increase one’s knowledge. Only a few Aurous core stage cultivators would gain more gains and insights.

And Chen Nanfeng’s personal lecture was a good opportunity that could only be encountered by luck.

Whether they were at the Qi refinement stage or the Golden core stage, perhaps Chen Nanfeng’s words could give them inspiration and greatly improve their cultivation.

Hence, when Xia ruofei arrived at the back of the mountain, the grandstand was almost full.

Even powerful golden core cultivators like Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha had arrived here in advance.

Xia ruofei had been in the limelight yesterday, so his arrival naturally attracted a lot of attention. Many cultivators were whispering in the distance.

Mu Jianfei, Yu xiner, and the others who were close to Xia ruofei also greeted him.

Xia ruofei had a warm smile on his face the entire time. He nodded to the cultivators who greeted him as he walked up to the grandstand. Hence, after Lu You left, Xia ruofei continued to cultivate the mystic origin Scripture. He spent the entire night and finally completed the sixth level of the “black origin Scripture”.
