“No problem!” Deputy Director Wei said readily.

After a while, Xiao Xu, who had been arrested by Deputy Director Wei for work, returned with a lunchbox and said,””Director, President Xia, I’m done!”

“Are you clean?” Deputy Director Wei asked.

“Don’t worry! I’ve washed it twice with detergent and rinsed it with clean water for a long time. It’s definitely clean!” Xiao Xu said.

“Mm! You’ve worked hard, go and do your work!” Deputy Director Wei said in a friendly manner.

Xia ruofei took the lunchbox and said with a smile,””Thank you!”

“You’re welcome! You’re welcome!” Xiao Xu was flattered.

“Director Wei, please wait for a moment. I’ll go and get my two friends!” Xia ruofei said to Deputy Director Wei.

“Good, good, good!”

Xia ruofei pushed the door open and entered the lounge. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were still focused on editing the photos.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m going to meet my fans at the entrance and return the lunchboxes to them.” You guys come with me!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue raised their heads and were both stunned.

“I won’t be joining in the fun,” Ling Qingxue quickly said.

“Ruofei, you can leave by yourself!” Song Wei said. Qingxue and I are retouching your pictures!”

Xia ruofei was stunned at first, but he immediately understood what the two were thinking.

Ling Qingxue was Xia ruofei’s public girlfriend, and the couple was very popular on the internet. Xia ruofei’s fans all knew Ling Qingxue.

If Ling Qingxue and Song Wei accompanied Xia ruofei out, Song Wei would be in an awkward position and she would inevitably feel a sense of loss.

In fact, Song Wei would never appear with Xia ruofei at a fan meeting.

It would be even more inappropriate if Ling Qingxue accompanied Xia ruofei and left Song Wei at the Supercomputing Center.

Therefore, Ling Qingxue quickly decided not to meet Xia ruofei’s fans and to stay with Song Wei.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look at Ling Qingxue deeply. This girl was usually a little boisterous, but she was actually very careful. Now, she was especially concerned about Song Wei’s mood. This was definitely a good sign.

Of course, it was enough to know these things in his heart. It would be bad to say it out loud.

Hence, Xia ruofei was only slightly dazed before he smiled and said,””Alright! You guys can rest here, I’ll be back soon!”

“I’m fine! Chat with your fans for a while more!” Ling Qingxue replied,”we don’t mind! Right, Wei Wei?”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Song Wei was smart. How could she not understand the reason why Ling Qingxue chose to stay? Her heart was as clear as a mirror, and because of this, she felt closer to Ling Qingxue.

So, Song Wei smiled and said,””Yeah! As long as you can get back before 10 pm, don’t delay the important matters!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he said,”how can it take so long ... Alright, you two continue editing the picture!” I’m leaving!”

“Take care!”

“I won’t send you off!”

The two of them lowered their heads to look at the photos on their phones and completely ignored Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head. He took the lunchbox and walked out of the lounge.

Deputy Director Wei came forward and asked curiously,””Eh? President Xia, your friend isn’t going?”

“They’re a little tired, so let them rest in the lounge!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Tired? I’ll get two rooms in the guest house, so you can lie down and sleep for a while!” Deputy Director Wei said,”you can only sit in this reception room. You won’t be able to rest well.”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no, no, no... They can just sit for a while!” Director Wei, let’s go out!”

“Alright then!” Deputy Director Wei said,”director Xia, I’ve already called a car. It’s just downstairs.”

“It’s only a few steps from the entrance ...” Xia ruofei said.”We can walk there.”

“It’s not close! And the sun is very poisonous. It’s not good for such a handsome young man like President Xia to get sunburnt. ” Deputy Chief Wei jokingly said,”besides, the car has already been called. Let’s just take the car!”

“Alright then, I’ll listen to you!” Xia ruofei said readily.

The two of them went downstairs together. A Buick jungyue from the Supercomputing Center was already parked downstairs. Seeing Deputy Director Wei, the driver immediately got out of the car and jogged to open the door of the back seat.

Deputy Director Wei and Xia ruofei gave way to each other and got into the car one after another.

“Director Wei, where are we going?” the driver asked.

“It’s at the entrance of the park. Drive slowly!”Said Deputy Director Wei.

The driver was stunned for a moment, but he immediately replied,””Alright!”

Two minutes later, the car drove out of the gate of the park.

Deputy Director Wei saw the group of fans still gathered in the shade of the tree across the road and felt a little relieved. If the fans had left, Xia ruofei would feel a little embarrassed.

Moreover, if the fans left, it meant that they had listened to his advice. Who knew if Xia ruofei would bear a grudge against them?

Fortunately, the loyalty of these fans was much higher than he had imagined.

Deputy Director Wei pointed at the group of fans across the road and said,””Just drive over to the crowd and Park!”

The driver naturally didn’t ask much. He nodded and said,”Understood!”

The black Buick junyue slowly stopped by the roadside.

This group of fans had already seen the car drive out of the park. When they saw the car actually stop beside them, everyone couldn’t help but wonder if it was here to drive people away. We’re already very far away, and this isn’t even within the park’s range!
