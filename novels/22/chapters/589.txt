Chapter 590: Ling Xiaotian’s moments (2)

After packing them – they would need at least a small truck to fit Yingying’s boxes – they took up too much space.

Moreover, a whole bag of iron – hide maples was also convenient during the transaction. It could be directly weighed, so as to avoid the suspicion of a lack of weight after being packed into a box.

On the third day after Mr. Lin left, Xia ruofei left Taoyuan farm in a pickup truck. He had made an appointment with his future father – in – Law to bring the Blood Red Dragon to the jiangbin villa today.

The night before, Xia ruofei had already chosen six blood – Red Dragons from the medium and placed them in three plastic boxes. Each box was just enough to hold a pair. At the same time, he dripped a slightly diluted solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals into the boxes.

When the car arrived at the entrance of Ling Xiaotian’s Villa, Xia ruofei moved the three plastic boxes from the space directly into the pickup truck.

Before he left, he had already installed the covers of the car. With the protection of the dark – colored glass, people outside could not see the three tidying boxes that had appeared out of thin air.

Xia ruofei did this to avoid the bumps on the road from scaring the blood – Red Dragon. If the blood – Red Dragon were to hit its scales, its value would be greatly reduced.

Xia ruofei honked, and the smart access control camera flashed. Then, the iron gate immediately slid open silently.

Xia ruofei drove into the courtyard and saw Ling Xiaotian walking out of the villa with five to six middle – aged men.

Xia ruofei jumped out of the car and greeted her with a smile.””Uncle Ling,” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ling Xiaotian chuckled and nodded,””RUO Fei, did you bring the Red Dragon?”

Xia ruofei pointed and smiled.””They’re all in the car! There are six in total. ”

At this time, a slightly balding middle – aged man showed a suspicious look and said,””Young man, are all six of them blood – Red Dragons?”

......

“Yes!” Xia ruofei nodded.

The balding uncle laughed and said,”since when were blood red Dragons so common?” Usually, one is a rare opportunity, but now there are six of them, hehe ...”

It was obvious that he was suspicious of Xia ruofei. Seeing this, Ling Xiaotian’s face darkened and he said,””Third brother Xie, if you don’t trust me, you don’t have to come. No one is forcing you to come!”

“Old Ling, I have nothing to do, so I came to see your blood red Dragons,” Xie laosan said casually. Do you really think I have any hope for the so – called six Blood Dragons?”

Ling Xiaotian coldly snorted and said,”Hmph!” Believe it or not! It was RUO Fei who helped me find my pair of blood red Dragons!”

After he finished speaking, Ling Xiaotian ignored Xie laosan and turned to Xia ruofei with a warm smile.””RUO Fei, let me introduce you to my fish friends!”

Birds of a feather flock together. Ling Xiaotian’s circle of fish lovers was naturally different from those of other fish lovers. His circle was filled with rich bosses.

There were a total of five people present, and all of them were successful tycoons. One of them was a middle – aged man with an imposing appearance and wearing a string of expensive heavenly jewels. His name was li Zongheng, and he was the CEO of zongtian real estate. The middle – aged man in the Armani suit was Xu Desheng, the chairman of Huatian Jewelry Group. There was also a boorish middle – aged man named yang Dahua, who also owned a chemical group with assets of over a hundred million Yuan. The last one was a skinny old man named Guo Qinglin. He had been in the seafood business for his entire life, and the seafood company under his name also had assets of over 100 million Yuan.

Of course, in the end, Ling Xiaotian still introduced the balding third Xie with a straight face.

Third Xie’s name was Xie Xun, and he was the boss of a logistics company that wasn’t small.

After Xia ruofei heard Ling Xiaotian’s introduction, he smiled and nodded to greet these potential wealthy customers. When he finally introduced Xie Xun, Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud. He couldn’t help but think of The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber. However, he found it hard to associate this bald and perverted uncle with the Golden – furred Lion King.

The CEO of zongtian real estate, li Zongheng, had a humble aura about him. After Ling Xiaotian’s introduction, he smiled warmly and said,”Xia, let’s take a look at the Arowana you brought. As long as the quality is good, the price is not a problem. ”

“It’d be best if they’re of a higher quality than old Ling ‘s. ” The skinny old man Guo Qinglin laughed and said,”save him the trouble of showing off in front of us all day!”

Yang Dahua and Xu Desheng could not help but laugh.

Xie Xun pursed his lips and said,”the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment!” I’d advise you not to have any expectations ...”

When Xia ruofei saw that Xie Xun’s words were not very pleasant to hear, he couldn’t help but feel a trace of unhappiness in his heart. He didn’t even see anything! How could he be so sarcastic?

Ling Xiaotian’s eyes widened, and he could not help but want to retort. However, li Zongheng spoke before Ling Xiaotian could,”Xiao Xia, please don’t mind him. That’s just how third Xie is. He’s always been annoying with his words and has offended countless people over the years. If not for that, the assets of chengtong logistics would have multiplied by several times ...”

Yang Dahua and the others also revealed knowing smiles. It was obvious that they were more familiar with each other and knew Xie Xun’s personality.

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re all my elders. Why would I mind a few jokes?”

After saying that, Xia ruofei changed the topic. He looked at Xie Xun and asked,””Director Xie, you have no right to speak without investigating. You haven’t even seen the Arowana I brought! It’s too early to make a conclusion!”
