“Hello, aunt Fang!” Guangzhi Cao greeted her as well.

With a smile on her face, Fang Liyun said,”Little Cao is here too! Come and sit for a while!”

“Thank you, Auntie!” Guangzhi Cao quickly said.

“Xiao Cao, sit down and drink some water. Then, go to the entrance of the neighborhood with old Zhang to pick up Xiao Xia. I’ve arranged to meet him at Teno’ clock. He should be here soon,” song Qiming said.

Guangzhi Cao then realized that the Secretary had pushed back his original schedule to meet Xia ruofei.

“Secretary, you don’t have to drink the water. I’ll go over now,” he said hurriedly.

“It’s still early!”Fang Liyun laughed. There’s no hurry ... Little Cao, come, come, drink some water. The weather in the three mountains is too hot ...”

Fang Liyun had been living in the southwest with song Qiming. She had seen the power of the new furnace city the moment she arrived in Sanshan, so she stayed in her air – conditioned room all day and did not dare to go out.

Guangzhi Cao quickly took the cup and said,””Thank you, Auntie!”

He hurriedly took two sips and said,””Secretary, I’ll go wait for ruofei at the door!”

“Mm! Go!” Song Qiming nodded.

Guangzhi Cao said goodbye to Fang Liyun and left the villa.

He called the driver, old Zhang, and drove the Audi to the entrance of the community. First, he told the armed police at the gate that Secretary song’s visitor would be coming in a while. Then, he stood at the gate and waited.

The summer in Sanshan was very hot. The sun was already very bright at 9:00 in the morning. Guangzhi Cao was already covered in sweat. Zhang called him a few times and asked him to wait in the air – conditioned car, but he refused with a smile.

Guangzhi Cao was worried that he did not notice Xia ruofei immediately.

When he found out that Xia ruofei was coming over today, he was even more certain that the Secretary had brought him along because of Xia ruofei. He was eager to have a chance to show his sincerity.

Guangzhi Cao waited under the scorching sun for a while before Xia ruofei’s Mercedes – Benz arrived at the entrance of the villa district.

Xia ruofei could see Guangzhi standing under the sun on a sunny day from afar. He kept looking into the distance, and it was hard not to notice him.

Xia ruofei stopped the car in front of the No – go line, rolled down the window, and waved at Guangzhi Cao.

Guangzhi Cao finally saw Xia ruofei. He quickly signaled the armed police to let him in, then jogged to the front passenger seat of Xia ruofei’s car and got in.

On the other side, old Zhang also started the Audi.

“Just follow that Audi in front, ruofei,” said Guangzhi Cao.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei stepped on the accelerator and the car started moving slowly. He smiled and said,”brother Cao, why didn’t you avoid the sun? Wouldn’t I be committing a huge sin if I get a heat stroke?”

“I’ve only just arrived,”Guangzhi Cao said with a smile. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Xia ruofei glanced at Guangzhi Cao’s shirt, which was almost soaked in sweat. He smiled but did not say anything.

Soon, the two cars arrived at Villa No. 1 one after another.

The moment Xia ruofei got out of the car, he saw song Qiming personally waiting at the entrance of the villa. He quickly walked up to him and called out,””Secretary song!”

Song Qiming smiled kindly and said,””Little Xia, you’ve worked hard!”

“You’re welcome, Secretary song. ” Xia ruofei didn’t waste any time on small talk and said,”let’s go in and see the patient!”

“Yes, yes, yes, let’s go in!” Song Qiming said quickly.

The three of them walked into the villa. Xia ruofei asked,””Secretary song, where is the patient?”

“She was in the room upstairs just now.” Song Qiming smiled and said,”I’ve already asked my wife to go up and get her ...”

As soon as song Qiming finished his sentence, Fang Liyun exclaimed from upstairs,”Weiwei! Wei Wei! Wei Wei, what’s wrong ...”

Song Qiming and Xia ruofei’s expressions changed at the same time. They took two quick steps and ran upstairs.
