“Ruofei, I’ve finished absorbing it!” Ling Qingxue shouted.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief and said,””That’s great! Let’s take the items and leave the formation immediately!”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue packed their things and stepped out of the time formation.

After stepping out of the time formation’s range, the mission time in Xia ruofei’s perception mirror immediately returned to its normal speed. It was already ten seconds.

Xia ruofei’s speed was extremely fast. He grabbed Ling Qingxue’s soft hand with one hand and waved his hand at the same time to put the time array flag, alarm, and defense array materials into the spirit map space.

Then, the two of them stood there quietly, waiting for the last few seconds to pass.

Xia ruofei looked at the quiet wilderness in front of him. At the same time, there was a ticking countdown in his field of vision. He suddenly had mixed feelings.

The fourth level of the trial Pagoda had really given him a lot of benefits.

That much yellow jade essence had already benefited him greatly, and his mental strength had doubled. More importantly, he had really gambled on a one in seven chance of successfully meeting up with Ling Qingxue. This result couldn’t have been better.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had also helped Ling Qingxue absorb hundreds of Topaz essence. Without a doubt, the huge increase in her spiritual power would play a vital role in Ling Qingxue’s future cultivation path.

The ten – second countdown passed quickly. Xia ruofei suddenly felt his vision blur and a pulling force made him lose control of himself.

He subconsciously held Ling Qingxue’s hand tightly, and Ling Qingxue also held his arm tightly. The two of them felt like the stars were moving, and the scenery in front of them was also distorted.

When everything returned to normal, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue immediately turned to look at each other. They realized that they had not been separated and were still holding each other’s hands tightly. They both heaved a sigh of relief.

The two of them looked at each other and smiled, feeling at ease.

Then, Xia ruofei quickly observed the surrounding environment. With one look, he could not help but reveal a trace of doubt. The environment that he and Ling Qingxue were in was almost the same as the wilderness they had been in earlier. It was desolate and there were only a few sparse crops that looked like camel’s thorns lying quietly on the ground.

“RUO Fei, could it be that we didn’t leave the fourth level of the trial Pagoda?” Ling Qingxue asked, puzzled.

Xia ruofei looked around with a serious expression, then shook his head and said,””We can’t be careless. This shouldn’t be the trial Pagoda’s 4th level anymore!”

He said this because he had some confidence.

The reason was very simple. In the vision of the perceptual mirror, the mission time countdown had disappeared. At the same time, the clear map of the trial tower’s fourth floor had also disappeared. In its place was still a map, but the display range was very small, only about a few dozen meters around him. The golden light spot representing the yellow jade essence had also disappeared.

All of these signs pointed to the fact that, although their current environment was very similar to the trial Pagoda’s 4th level, they should have already left the space of the 4th level.

The fourth floor of the Tower of Trials was obviously a reward for the cultivators who completed the first three floors. That was why it was given in the form of a mission to increase the cultivator’s mental strength without any danger.

And this was no longer the 4th level of the Tower of Trials, and it was very likely that they were directly on the 5th level. As such, they couldn’t be careless, as danger could appear at any moment.

“I see ...” Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”ruofei, where are we now?”

Xia ruofei shook his head.”I’m not too sure. Maybe it’s the fifth level of the trial Pagoda, or maybe it’s a special small space. No matter what, we’ll find out soon.”

Xia ruofei did not know how other cultivators received all kinds of information and tips when they were doing the Tower of Trials mission. He had a sensory mirror and basically, the key tips were directly displayed in the field of vision of the sensory mirror. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Therefore, he had enough patience. All he needed to do was to stay alert.

Xia ruofei did not bring Ling Qingxue to explore the place rashly. Instead, he asked,””Qingxue, I didn’t have time to ask you just now. How do you feel after absorbing the yellow jade essence? How much did your spiritual power increase?”

Ling Qingxue said happily,”I feel like my spiritual power has gotten much stronger!” Especially after absorbing more than 100, I feel like my spiritual power has broken through a barrier. If I’m not wrong, I should have reached the spirit gathering realm!”

Xia ruofei was surprised and said,””You’ve broken through to the spirit gathering stage? I didn’t expect the yellow jade essence to have such a good effect on you!”

The spirit gathering realm was equivalent to the mental power of a cultivator in the Golden core stage. Ling Qingxue was actually quite far from the Golden core stage, but her mental power had already reached the level of a cultivator in the Golden core stage. It had to be said that the yellow jade essence was really effective.

Xia ruofei felt that the opportunity on the fourth level of the trial Pagoda was extremely rare for any cultivator. It could be considered a great opportunity in the entire process of exploring the secret realm.

Of course, Xia ruofei had swept up almost half of the Topaz essence on the fourth floor of the trial Pagoda. To other cultivators, it was almost impossible to replicate. Even the powerful person who designed the mission did not expect it.
