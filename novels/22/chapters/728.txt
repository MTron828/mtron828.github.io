Chapter 729: Young, rich, and good – looking (1)

Sanshan city, Bell Tower District.

Grand View Real Estate sales department.

It was a high – end real estate project under the jianda group in the southeast province.

Bell Tower District was the traditional city center of Sanshan city. It could be said that every inch of land was worth its weight in gold. Within a 500 – meter radius of the Grand View Real Estate, all the basic living facilities were basically included, including tertiary Grade A hospitals, large supermarkets, schools, sports fields, subway stations, urban complexes, and so on.

The most important thing was that the children of the owners of the Grand View Real Estate were also divided into provincial key primary schools, the first Central Primary School in the gong Gong Bell Tower District.

As a result, even though the building’s starting price of 25000 Yuan was far higher than the average price in San Shan city, sales were still booming, and it was sold out quickly.

Now, the Grand View Real Estate had basically completed the completion acceptance and was about to be handed over.

The sales office was basically on guard. Although there were still customers coming in occasionally, there were no more houses left.

But today, the atmosphere in the sales office was a little tense.

After the manager received a phone call, he immediately gathered the employees to do a sudden cleaning. Then, he gathered everyone together and emphasized on work discipline. He severely criticized the employees who didn’t dress up to the requirements and asked them to rectify it immediately.

The reason was simple. The head office just called to say that the head office’s Chairman, Liang Weimin, was coming over for an inspection. He had already set off and was on his way.

Sharpening one’s spear in the face of a battle was not fast, but it was also light.

After the sudden reorganization of the sales department, it looked bright and clean, and the employees were all in high spirits. No matter if they had something to do, they all looked busy.

......

Soon, a black Mercedes – Benz limousine drove to the entrance of the sales department.

The sales manager, who had been waiting there for a long time, quickly stepped forward to open the car door.

“Hello, CEO Liang!” The manager bowed slightly.

Liang Weimin stepped out of the car and nodded slightly. The manager respectfully led the way and let Liang Weimin into the sales office.

The staff had already formed two rows, and as soon as Liang Weimin entered, everyone started clapping.

A faint smile appeared on Liang Weimin’s face. He gestured with his hands and said,”Everyone, get busy! I’m here today to take a look around. ”

The sales manager showed Liang Weimin around. Liang Weimin had a faint smile on his face and looked around as he walked, but he didn’t say anything.

The manager became more and more nervous. He didn’t know what the big boss was up to today, but at the same time, he was afraid that the chairman would catch him.

After Liang Weimin looked around, he said indifferently,”Little song, it’s not bad here. Everyone has worked hard.”

Manager song heaved a sigh of relief and quickly said,””President Liang, thank you for your affirmation and encouragement!”

Liang Weimin nodded, then walked straight to the sofa in the rest area and sat down.

Manager song was stunned. Why didn’t they leave after the inspection? Why is CEO Liang so free today?

However, he naturally did not dare to ask too much. He quickly gestured for a good – looking female employee to prepare tea and desserts.

Liang Weimin leaned back on the sofa and said indifferently,”Xiao Song, go and prepare the keys for 1801 and 1802 of Building 1, as well as 1601 and 1608 of Building 3. I have a friend who will be coming over to look at the houses later.”

Only then did manager song understand why Liang Weimin had come today. As he heaved a long sigh of relief, he quickly agreed and personally went to prepare the keys according to Liang Weimin’s request.

The Grand View Real Estate had already been completed and was in the process of inspection. The next step would be to hand over the house.

In fact, at the beginning of last year, all the houses had been bought up.

Of course, this was for ordinary buyers. In fact, real estate companies would build some “internal houses” in their hands, and these houses that were reserved, whether it was the layout, real estate, orientation, or so on, were relatively good.

These “internal rooms” were naturally reserved for the company’s senior management.

Of course, property prices had always been on the rise. There was no cost pressure for real estate companies to build a few apartments, and even if they held them in their hands, they would appreciate in value. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Therefore, this was also a common practice in the industry. When the so – called opening sale was done, no house would really sell all the houses.

After manager song went to get the keys, the employees all knew the purpose of Liang Weimin’s visit.

The employees who were further away from Liang Weimin couldn’t help but whisper among themselves. They were very curious about this customer who was about to arrive.

Normally, Liang Weimin only needed to make a phone call and get the house keys ready. He could also give the other party any discounts or instructions over the phone.

There was only one reason why Liang Weimin came over personally. Yingying was a very important customer.

Just as everyone was speculating and manager song was carefully waiting on them, a domineering Black Knight XV off – Road vehicle drove to the entrance of the sales department.

When Liang Weimin saw the car through the floor – to – Ceiling glass window, he immediately stood up and personally went out to welcome it.

The sales ladies immediately knew that the customer that CEO Liang was waiting for had arrived. Everyone looked outside curiously.

The Knight XV had a domineering appearance, and it was obviously a super luxury car, which made everyone even more interested.

The car door opened, and a young man in his twenties stepped out with a faint smile on his face.

The young man was dressed in casual clothes and had very refreshing short hair. His facial features did not look particularly handsome at first glance, but when combined together, he gave people a very comfortable feeling.

Especially when this young man stood there, he seemed to have a natural affinity, making people couldn’t help but look at him a few more times.
