Chapter 746: Flower Guardian (1)

Xue Fei stuck out his tongue and licked his lips before reluctantly looking away.

Hu Lili was sitting right beside Xue Fei. Xue Fei leaned over and whispered into her ear,””Are Hong Mei and the others ready?”

“They’ve already gone there,” Hu Lili nodded and said.”Don’t worry!”

Xue Fei slightly nodded and asked,””Did you get that thing?”

“It’s already in my bag. ” Hu Lili said.

“Mm! Later on, you have to do it more covertly, don’t let the cat out of the bag. ” Xue Fei said.

Hu Lili’s expression was a little complicated, and a trace of jealousy flashed in her eyes, but she still said obediently,””I know, brother Fei.”

Hu Lili was well aware of what would happen tonight, and she couldn’t help but feel a little sour in her heart. However, she knew that she was not worthy of Xue Fei at all, and that their relationship was just that of each taking what they needed.

Xue Fei was infatuated with her body, and she needed the various conveniences that came with Xue Fei’s father’s power.

On the other hand, what Lin Qiao was going to face today wouldn’t bring her any benefits. On the contrary, it would become a nightmare for her life. Hu Lili felt much better and looked at Xue Fei with more charm.

Lin Qiao was very obedient. Before they left, Hu Zi’s mother and Xia ruofei had told her not to drink, so she insisted on not touching alcohol. She only drank from the beginning. No matter how her classmates urged her to drink, she would only smile and shake her head.

Naturally, the ‘hangover medicine’ that Xia ruofei had prepared for her would not be of any use.

The meal lasted until about eighto’ clock.

......

What Lin Qiao did not know was that for her safety, Xia ruofei had arrived at Haojue nightclub early. Lei Hu and the rest had been keeping watch in the hotel room across the street. They even sent two people to the hotel to be on standby.

Lei Hu didn’t even have time to eat dinner. He had been watching Lin Qiao’s every move with a telescope behind the curtain.

After the students had their fill, the class monitor stood up and clapped his hands.””Students, everyone has eaten and drunk enough, right? Let’s go sing next? I’ve already booked a private room at the Haojue nightclub not far away. No one is allowed to be absent!”

Lin Qiao had already promised her mother to go home early. Now that she heard that the karaoke place was not a KTV but a nightclub, she couldn’t help but show a hesitant look.

Nightclubs were much more complicated than ordinary KTVs. There were all kinds of people here, and she heard that there were “special services”. Lin Qiao couldn’t help but want to retreat.

A few girls in the class had the same thought as Lin Qiao.

The class president seemed to have guessed everyone’s thoughts. He smiled and said,””Don’t misunderstand, everyone. The reason why we booked Hao Jue nightclub is because it’s close to here. We’re just going there to sing. If a girl needed to go home early, it was fine, but she should at least go over and play for a while! If it’s too late, I’ll arrange for a boy to send you home. Anyway, I’ll make sure that everyone gets home safely!”

Since the class monitor had said so, some of the girls who had wanted to refuse were too embarrassed to say anything.

Besides, today’s gathering was quite happy. There wouldn’t be many opportunities for these classmates to gather together in the future, so Lin Qiao finally decided to go and have fun with everyone.

Lin Qiao thought,”I’ll play until nineo’ clock. It’s not too late!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Alright, since no one has any objections, let’s go!” The squad leader waved his hand in high spirits and said,”Haojue nightclub is only about 200 meters away from here. Let’s walk there!”

The boys and girls walked out of the restaurant one after another, and those who were close to them naturally walked together. More than 40 people went to the Haojue nightclub not far ahead.

Just as Lin Qiao walked out of the private room, Lei Hu immediately called Xia ruofei.

“Brother Xia, Lin Qiao and the others are out.” Lei Hu said.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were initially closed, but when he heard Lei Hu’s words, he immediately became alert. He sat up straight on the sofa and said,””Alright! Hu, you must not have eaten yet, right? Take our brothers to get something to eat, and then wait for orders near the nightclub. ”

“Brother Xia, we’re not hungry!” Lei Hu laughed and said,”it’s more important to get things done. After we’re done, you can treat us to a good meal!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”that’s fine. But buy some bread and mineral water. Being on standby won’t affect your eating. Don’t Starve your stomach!”

“Understood!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei immediately summoned the eight Hornets from the medium.

These Hornets had just absorbed the spirit Heart Flower petal solution and had rested for so long in the spirit map space, which was rich in spirit Qi, so they were all full of energy.

Xia ruofei turned on all the Super – tiny cameras they carried.

He thought for a moment, then summoned another 20 strong Hornets from the space. Then, he released his mental power, and the 28 Hornets immediately changed direction and flew directly into the bathroom.

Xia ruofei turned on his laptop and directed the eight Hornets to the surveillance position that he had set up earlier.

As for the other 20 Hornets, 15 of them followed the rest into the box and hid in the light compartment around the ceiling. The remaining five were in the bathroom, hiding behind the cold water pipe.

These 20 Hornets were backup. If anything happened, they could attack immediately and not let Lin Qiao get hurt.
