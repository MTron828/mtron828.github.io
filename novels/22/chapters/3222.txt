3223 Silicon Valley (2)

“No problem!” Chen Nanfeng nodded.”We’ll follow your arrangements for the time being!”

In fact, after two tests, Chen Nanfeng and the others knew very well that even if the black Phoenix flying ship’s defense was strong enough, Xia ruofei would not abandon them and go to the moon for an exploration at this stage.

The reason was simple. With Xia ruofei’s cultivation, it was impossible for him to last that many days without any protection.

In fact, even Chen Nanfeng, who had the highest cultivation, could not have lasted that long.

However, Xia ruofei had gone to the United States to make arrangements for the purchase of the spacesuit. If Xia ruofei successfully obtained the spacesuit and took the black Phoenix flying ship from the United States to the moon, Chen Nanfeng and the rest would be at a loss. Without the black Phoenix flying ship, Chen Nanfeng would not be able to catch up to Xia ruofei, even if he was the number one expert in the world of cultivation.

Even though everyone was in harmony now, this possibility could not be ruled out.

Therefore, Chen Nanfeng and the others would not let Xia ruofei go to the United States alone. It was inevitable that she would go with them.

For the next few days, the cultivators from the three sects stayed in Xia ruofei’s courtyard house.

The older generation generally didn’t like crowds and spent most of their time cultivating on their own.

The young people were still quite curious about the capital.

Especially for those who grew up in sects, everything in the modern city was very fresh to them.

Xia ruofei brought them to all the famous attractions in the capital and even brought them to eat some of the capital’s specialties.

At the same time, on the other side of the ocean in the United States, a Gulfstream G650 private plane landed steadily at San Francisco, California International Airport.

Even after a long flight, Li Yifu was still in high spirits. His eyes were filled with excitement. After such a long time, he could finally help his senior granduncle with some matters. Even though it was only a matter of the secular world, he knew that this matter was of great importance.

Yesterday, Luo Qingfeng had brought Zheng Yongshou to Paradise Island at the fastest speed possible on his flying sword.

Of course, in order to avoid being followed, Qingfeng Luo took a detour, so the time he spent on the road was longer than expected.

After Li Yifu had handed over everything on the island, he asked Luo Qingfeng to take him directly to the nearest Island with an airport on his sword.

He had already transferred his private jet to wait here in advance.

Li Yifu took his private plane directly and refueled it on the way. After a total of more than ten hours of flight, he finally landed in San Francisco at ten in the morning local time.

A black extended Bentley was parked on the tarmac.

This was Li Yifu’s car. It was a specially customized extended version. The body of the car was equipped with thick armor, and the tires and glass were all bulletproof. The safety level was very high.

This was also transferred to San Francisco through a transport plane last night.

“Chairman, you’ve had a long journey!” A Chinese girl in a black suit stepped forward and bowed slightly.

This was Li Yifu’s personal assistant, Lin Wei. She was Li Yifu’s personal assistant who would coordinate all his Affairs. However, Li Yifu wasn’t in the U.S. For more than half a year, and he didn’t care about the company’s Affairs, so Lin Wei became very idle. She even took the initiative to ask to keep her assistant position and train in other departments.

This time, when Li Yifu returned to the United States, Lin Wei was naturally the first to be notified. She handed over all her other work in advance and became a full – time assistant again.

Li Yifu nodded slightly and asked indifferently,””Have you contacted the elonmask side?”

Lin Wei nodded and said,”Mr. Masker has been in Silicon Valley for a while, but his schedule is very full. Our latest confirmed meeting time is 2:30 this afternoon. It’s about half an hour.”

Li Yifu frowned slightly and said,””Such a short time? Can’t you arrange for it to be during dinner time?”

Although Li Yifu grew up in the United States, he was still influenced by the traditional Chinese way of thinking and was more used to talking about business at the dining table.

Moreover, this matter had to be held in a relatively private place, with only him and masker having a secret discussion. Otherwise, it would definitely be impossible to succeed.

Lin Wei said,”Chairman, Mr. Masker’s assistant replied that because SpaceX’s manned flight plan is about to be implemented, Mr. Masker is very busy as the company’s CEO and Chief Technology Officer. His schedule is particularly full.” This half an hour of meeting time was squeezed out at the last minute. For this reason, Mr. Mersk even canceled a meeting ...” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lin Wei was also worried that Li Yifu would feel that she had been neglected, so she quickly explained.

In fact, Elon Musk still gave a great degree of respect to an entrepreneur like Li Yifu, who was a veteran super – rich man. Otherwise, he would not have been able to arrange a meeting in the afternoon as soon as the plane landed.

Li Yifu’s mind was filled with thoughts of helping Xia ruofei do his job well and beautifully, so he did not think about the problem of being slow. He pondered for a while and said,””Alright! Half an hour it is! You’ve confirmed it with them, right? I need to speak to elonmask alone!”

“I’ve already confirmed this with the other party!” Lin Wei quickly said,”Mr. Masker says that there’s no problem at all!”

“Alright then!” Li Yifu said,”let’s go back to the hotel first!”

……

2:30 in the afternoon.

Tesla headquarters in Silicon Valley.

Li Yifu, who had arrived ten minutes earlier, was led by a blonde female secretary into Elon Musk’s office.

Elon Musk fully expressed his respect for the entrepreneur Li Yifu and got up in advance to welcome him warmly.

“Mr. Masker, I’m sorry to bother you today!” Li Yifu said with a smile.

“Please sit, Mr. Li!” With a smile on his face, Elon Musk led Li Yifu to the guest area and said,”it’s my honor to meet with a business giant like you, Mr. Li! In my heart, your status is no less than that Mr. Li in Hong Kong!”

Elonmask had lowered his posture very much, and in fact, it was not too exaggerated.

Speaking of which, Elon Musk’s net worth should be about the same as Li Yifu ‘s, about 40 to 50 billion US dollars.

However, Li Yifu had many businesses under his name, and the cash flow advantage of doing business was huge.

The tech giants in Silicon Valley also had very high market values, but that was all fake. Compared to cash flow, they were much worse than industrial companies.

What’s more, Elon Musk continued to burn money on SpaceX and now needed a continuous injection of funds.

He didn’t know why Li Yifu took the initiative to look for him, but he felt that this might be an opportunity that could bring him a lot of money.

“Mr. Masker, you flatter me!” Li Yifu smiled and said,”our two generations have worked hard for decades, but the speed of our accumulation of wealth is far slower than the new software released by some technology companies in Silicon Valley! So, the world is now ruled by the young!”

The two of them exchanged a few pleasantries before the Secretary brought the coffee and left the office. Maelon Musk also went straight to the point. His time was precious, so he couldn’t keep beating around the bush.

“Mr. Li, what business do you have with me this time?” “What’s the matter?” elonmask asked directly.

“I’ve come to visit you this time to do business with Mr. Masker!” Li Yifu said with a smile.

Elon Musk raised his eyebrows and smiled.””Oh, really? You’re welcome! I love doing business with an entrepreneur like Mr. Li, but ... I wonder what kind of business Mr. Li wants to do with me?”

...

“I hope to purchase a batch of Eva suits and related equipment and accessories from SpaceX in my personal name!” Li Yifu said directly.

The smile on Elon Musk’s face froze, and his face revealed a look of disbelief.

He opened his mouth slightly and stared at Li Yifu for a few seconds before he asked,””Mr. Li, are you sure you’re not joking with me?”
