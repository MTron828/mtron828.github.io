Chapter 874: The arrival of an honored guest (1)

Translator: 549690339

The next day, after breakfast, Xia ruofei drove the domineering Knight XV off – Road vehicle out of the farm and headed to the second Central Primary School in the Bell Tower District.

Xia ruofei didn’t want to drive such a flashy car, but Feng Jing had to go to the city in the morning to inspect the location of the new headquarters. She was using the Mercedes – Benz, so Xia ruofei only had two choices: a pickup truck and the Knight XV.

He couldn’t drive a pickup truck to meet he Feng, could he? Therefore, he could only choose this Knight XV off – Road vehicle.

Xia ruofei left the farm at around 8:20. There was not much traffic in the city during the summer break, so he arrived at the clock Tower No. 2 primary school at around 8:50.

The gate of No. 2 primary school could be seen in the distance. Because it was still summer vacation, the gate seemed a little deserted.

Xia ruofei slowed down the car and drove Knight XV into a parking spot on the street near the entrance of the clock tower.

Just as he opened the door and got out of the car, the back door of the black Passat in the parking lot in front of him also opened. A fat middle – aged man got out of the car and greeted him with a smile.

This man was he Feng, the Deputy District head of the bell tower Division. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He Feng had arranged for the Director of Education to arrive at the school in advance yesterday, and he had also been waiting at the school gate half an hour earlier.

Besides, he Feng did not inform the education Bureau or the second primary school. He had even used a common official car in the district so that no one would recognize his car. That way, he could wait for Xia ruofei at the entrance.

After all, he didn’t know what kind of temper this “young master Xia” had. If he made a big fuss and made him unhappy, it would be impolite not to welcome him here. Therefore, he had already put in a lot of effort for this detail.

When Xia ruofei’s car drove over from a distance, he Feng had already noticed Jian Jia. After all, this car was too eye – catching, and it was hard to ignore.

He Feng immediately realized that Xia ruofei must have arrived. In his mind, it was normal for Mr. Xia to drive such a car. After all, he was someone that Secretary song valued so much!

Therefore, he Feng immediately got out of the car.

He walked over to Xia ruofei and asked with a smile,””Are you Mr. Xia?”

Xia ruofei was dazed for a moment before he came back to his senses and said,””I’m Xia ruofei. You must be Mayor he?”

“Yes, yes, yes, I’m he Feng!” He Feng quickly said,”Hello, Mr. Xia!”

“Mayor he, how could I trouble you to wait for me here?” Xia ruofei smiled.

“I should, I should.” He Feng said,”Mr. Xia, then ... Let’s go in and complete the registration procedures first?”

“I’ll have to trouble Mayor he then,”Xia ruofei nodded.

He Feng brought Xia ruofei into the second primary school. The Director of Education and the principal had rushed to the school in person. They were surprised to see he Feng personally bring a young man to sign up for a student. However, they did not dare to say anything and were very enthusiastic.

The registration process was actually very simple. Xia ruofei took out Nan Nan’s household register and Lin Yue ‘E’s identity card. The school administrative staff made a copy and registered them on the spot. It was done in a few minutes.

Naturally, Nan Nan was arranged to be in the experimental class.

Moreover, since the normal registration had already ended, it was equivalent to forcing a student into the experimental class. He Feng was very careful and personally instructed the principal to arrange Nan Nan’s student number in the middle, while the other students would be pushed back in order.

According to the usual practice, Nan Nan would be last in the queue. In addition, there was one more person in the experimental class. Many people would make their own guesses.

It could be said that he Feng had put all his thoughts on this matter, and he had considered all the details very thoroughly.

Then, he Feng instructed the Director of Education and the principal in front of Xia ruofei to arrange the best teacher and form teacher for the experimental class. He also requested the form teacher to pay more attention to Nan Nan’s studies and life.

These words were already quite obvious, and it was completely not the usual vague hint.

The director and the principal naturally nodded in agreement, patting their chests to guarantee that they would carry out the district head’s instructions.

After the registration, the director of the education Bureau carefully asked,””District head, I’ve asked principal Lin to arrange a hotel. Shall we have lunch together?”

“I won’t be eating. You guys go do what you need to do!” He Feng waved his hand.

“Alright!” The director of the education Bureau said with a hint of disappointment.

Xia ruofei smiled and said to he Feng,””Mayor he, thank you!”

“You’re welcome, you’re welcome. It’s no big deal. ” He Feng quickly said,”Mr. Xia, if Nan Nan needs anything in school, you can call me at any time.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

The director of the education Bureau and the principal of the primary school were speechless. They thought to themselves,”is it necessary to personally trouble a District Mayor with a child’s matters in school?”

Of course, the Director and Principal were also very curious about Xia ruofei’s identity since he Feng was so respectful to him.

At the same time, the principal also reminded himself that he had to take special care of the student named Nan Nan after she entered the school. He must not let anything happen to her. Otherwise, he would have to bear the consequences.

He Feng accompanied Xia ruofei as they left the school. The Director of Education and the principal naturally saw them off.

He Feng waved them off and accompanied Xia ruofei to the car.
