Chapter 3407: Meeting on a narrow path (1)

Translator: 549690339

There was a loud bang!

The blackball exploded violently the moment it came into contact with the goldthread nether snake.

The earth trembled and the mountains trembled. A large amount of flames instantly surrounded the goldthread nether snake.

The goldthread nether snake had been charging upwards at full speed, but it was caught off guard by the black ball’s explosion, and its momentum was immediately halted.

What was even more terrifying was that the black ball just happened to come into contact with the three golden threads on the snake’s head. The golden threads were actually in the shape of a snake, and the seven – inch mark was the snake’s weakest point.

As a result, the goldthread nether snake had suffered significant damage from the explosion.

Its body trembled, and a stream of stinky blood flowed out of its mouth. The top of its head was also blasted open.

However, the goldthread nether snake had thick skin. The explosion and flames from the black ball didn’t cause any fatal damage to it. It only looked extremely miserable.

The goldthread nether snake’s ferocity was triggered. It let out an angry hiss and went berserk. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

However, the distance between it and Xia ruofei was inevitably widened.

Because of the black ball’s explosion, not only did it lose its momentum, but it also slid down a dozen meters.

Xia ruofei made use of the shock wave from the black ball’s explosion to jump up. The qushuang flying sword under his feet also rose at its maximum speed. In the blink of an eye, he was dozens of meters away from the goldthread nether snake.

As soon as he picked up speed, Xia ruofei immediately summoned the spirit map scroll and threw it towards the top of the mountain with all his might.

Xia ruofei was already flying upwards at full speed on his sword. He then threw out the spirit map scroll at full speed. With the two speeds stacked together, the speed of the spirit map scroll was even faster. It made a whistling sound as it tore through the air and even left an afterimage.

After Xia ruofei threw out the spirit map scroll, he immediately entered the spirit map’s space and entered the primordial realm. He was directly inside the time formation.

Scholar Yuntai had been in the mysterious ore space, watching Xia ruofei’s every move.

They had all witnessed Xia ruoxin’s smooth and fluid movements after she had flown out.

Scholar Yuntai clicked his tongue and said,”fellow Daoist Xia, you really have a lot of life – saving methods!” There’s actually a magic treasure like the Thunderbolt seed!”

Only then did Xia ruofei know that the black ball he had found in Shen tianfang’s belongings was called Leiting.

He smiled and said,”I got this by chance. I only have one. If it wasn’t for the urgent situation, I wouldn’t have used it!”

“That’s right!” Layman Yuntai agreed.”In that situation, if you didn’t use the Thunderbolts to blow up the goldthread nether snake, you would have been in danger!”

Then, scholar Yuntai asked,”fellow Daoist Xia, you should have had enough time to fly to the top of the mountain. Why did you enter this small world?”

Master Yuntai also didn’t understand. In the previous situation, if Xia ruofei had flown up quickly on his sword, he should have been able to reach the top of the mountain before the golden thread nether snake caught up to him. However, it was hard to say if he would have the time to set up the nine – turn space splitting formation.

However, Xia ruofei didn’t fly up on his sword. Instead, he chose the same strategy as when he was in an emergency. He threw out the spirit map scroll again and entered the spirit map space by himself. Furthermore, Xia ruofei entered the time formation of the Archean realm. Clearly, he wanted to buy more time. It was just that no one knew what Xia ruofei wanted to do.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”senior Yuntai, I thought about it just now and I think you’re right.” The nine turn space splitting formation was still not enough to deal with goldthread nether snake. I just happened to have some inspiration, so I decided to fight for some time to see if I could improve the formation.”

Layman Yuntai couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. After a long time, he muttered,””! didn’t hear wrong, did I? Or is there something wrong with my ears? It was wrong! I’m in a spirit body state right now, where do I get my ears?”

Since master Yuntai had lost his physical body, he communicated with Xia ruofei through spiritual power. Naturally, there was no problem with his hearing, and it was impossible for him to mishear.

So, he asked again in an uncertain tone,””Fellow Daoist Xia, are you going to modify the nine turn space splitting formation before the battle?”

Xia ruofei gathered all the materials together and smiled.””Senior Yuntai, you didn’t hear wrong. I really want to improve the formation, mainly to increase its offensive power. Of course, the nine turn space splitting formation itself is already very mature, so it’s not very possible to make any major changes to this kind of formation. I only have a preliminary idea to make minor adjustments to some parts of the formation and at the same time add a few more talismans. If there’s no problem with my idea, I should be able to complete the transformation very quickly.”

With that, Xia ruofei skillfully picked out a few talismans from the array materials. At the same time, he beckoned for more blank Jade talismans and began to draw array patterns on the blank Jade talismans with his spiritual power while comparing them.

Scholar Yuntai stared at Xia ruofei’s movements with all his attention. He could not believe that someone could improve a fully developed formation in such a short time and could even increase the power of the attack.

Grand cloud scholar looked at the array pattern that Xia ruofei was inscribing. Compared to the array pattern on the talismans that he had picked out, there didn’t seem to be much difference. Xia ruofei’s inscribing speed was very fast, which showed that he had already deduced it very clearly in his mind..
