Translator: 549690339

The agonizing Grello. Galini was constantly rolling around, and he was very strong. The five bodyguards had to use all their strength to press him to the ground.

The doctor on the ship quickly stepped forward and gave Grello a hand. Kalini injected a tranquilizer.

However, the sedative had no effect at all. Galini did not pass out. As soon as the bodyguards let go of him, he immediately rolled on the ground in pain.

When the doctors on the ship saw this, they were completely helpless.

Sedatives could not be used in large doses, or it would be very dangerous.

As for Grello. Galini continued to roll, collide, and scratch his body, so he had to be controlled.

In the end, the doctor on the ship could only ask the bodyguards to take care of Grello. Galini was tied to the bed.

Grello. Although Galini’s movements were restricted, he was still struggling madly, and his throat was constantly letting out hoarse roars. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At this moment, his eyes were extremely red and his face was covered in bloody wounds. He looked like a demon who had descended to the mortal world.

The doctor on the ship quickly went up to give Grello a doctor’s report. Naturally, he would not be able to get any results from Galini’s examination.

Therefore, he asked the captain to return to the ship and apply for medical help on the grounds that the conditions on the yacht were limited.

Grello. With Galini’s status, it was easy for him to get the attention of the medical unit when he had an acute illness at sea. Therefore, the medical helicopter was quickly sent out to check on the helipad on the rear deck of the yacht. In an emergency, the helicopter could take off and land.

The Galiny also turned around and started to return at full speed, heading in the direction of the medical helicopter.

The doctors on the ship were all guarding Grello. Galini couldn’t do anything but watch Grello. Galini struggled madly in bed.

As for Grello. The medical helicopter didn’t arrive in kalini either, although it wouldn’t be of any use even if the top medical institution on earth sent people over.

He struggled and screamed for more than an hour under everyone’s watchful eyes, and the final moment arrived.

At this moment, Grello. Galini’s voice was completely hoarse. He could only make a hissing sound when he opened his mouth, and his breath was getting weaker and weaker.

The doctor on the ship was helpless and could only keep monitoring Grello. Galini’s vital signs.

Grello. The few friends that kalini had brought along were also in the bedroom. All of them had a dumbfounded expression on their faces. They were just following the big boss out to sea to have fun. How did they suddenly encounter this situation? If Grello … If kalini had really died at sea, then all of them would be involved.

In fact, Grello’s face was pale. Galini really died on the ship. Everyone watched as his breathing became weaker and weaker, and his struggle became weaker and weaker.

In the end, the doctor on the ship simply asked the bodyguards to untie the rope. Without any restraints, Galini could no longer struggle.

He just lay on the bed, his eyes were lifeless, and his mouth was still groaning weakly.

Everyone was shocked to find that, at the last moment, Grello’s body had been destroyed. As if the tendons in his body had been twitched, Galini’s body began to curl up slowly. At first, he was only slightly bent, but gradually, his knees hit his chest. Then, he hugged his knees tightly and curled up into a ball.

When Grello. When Galini completely curled up into the shape of a pangolin, he let out a long breath and lost all signs of life.

The doctor’s face was pale as he went up to touch Grello. Galini sniffed, then felt his pulse. His legs gave way, and he sat down on the bed.

The others might be worried because of Grello. He would be implicated in the death of Galini, but as a doctor, he would undoubtedly receive the most severe punishment.

The doctor on the ship could not help but shiver at the thought of how cruel and merciless the Galini family was.

Xia ruofei observed everything coldly from midair. Galini finally breathed his last. He looked back one last time, then silently activated his Sword Art and flew away from the Galini at high speed.

As for how these people would be dealt with in the future, as well as Grello … He didn’t care what kind of uproar the news of Galini’s death would cause.

Grello. Kalini had attacked Paradise Farm and Liang Qichao, and he had a bad history of harming many Chinese people. Xia ruofei naturally took his life and killed him in a cruel way, which was considered to settle the karma.

Xia ruofei controlled his flying sword and flew for a distance before releasing the black Phoenix flying ship.

The Flying Ship grew in size as it faced the wind, rapidly growing in size and floating in the air.

Xia ruofei controlled the blue travel immortal sword and drew a beautiful arc in the air before landing steadily on the deck of the flying boat.

He steered the black Phoenix flying ship in the direction of Sydney.

Soon, the black Phoenix flying ship arrived at Tang Yitian’s Manor in Sydney.

At this time, Tang Yitian had just finished dinner and was taking a walk with Jennifer and Tang Haoran in the manor.

When Xia ruofei appeared at the entrance of the manor, Tang Yitian’s family, who had received the news, immediately went out to welcome him in a battery – powered car.

“RUO Fei, you’re back already?” Tang Yitian couldn’t help but be secretly speechless.

It had only been a few hours since Xia ruofei left the manor.

In such a short period of time, Xia ruofei had found the galni in the vast sea and killed Grello. He then returned to the manor. This was too efficient!

Because Jennifer and Tang Haoran were both there, Tang Yitian couldn’t ask more clearly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’m done. I’m back now.” Big brother Tang, have you eaten?”

“We just had dinner!” Tang Yitian said,”you haven’t eaten yet, have you? 1’11 get the kitchen to prepare dinner immediately!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’d be even better if there’s wine. Brother Tang, accompany me to drink a few glasses later!”

Hearing this, Tang Yitian knew that Xia ruofei’s trip must have been very successful. He was very happy and quickly said,””No problem! Let’s have a good drink later! It’ll take some time for the kitchen to prepare dinner. Why don’t we go to the study first? 1 just happen to have something to discuss with you!” “Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled.

The electric car quickly sent the four of them to the manor. Jennifer brought Tang Haoran back to his room to do his homework, while Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian went to the study room.

As soon as the door was closed, Tang Yitian couldn’t wait to ask,””RUO Fei, did everything go smoothly today? Grello. Galini has already been beheaded?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Of course. Although Grello is brave and ruthless, he’s just an ordinary person. How can 1 miss when I’m dealing with an ordinary person?”

“I also thought that you would definitely succeed. I didn’t expect you to be so efficient!” Tang Yitian smiled and said,”tell me quickly, how did you deal with Grello?” Galiny’s? It’ll also broaden my horizons!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”! wanted to give him a quick death, but this guy admitted it himself. He admitted that he hated the Chinese and that a few Chinese have died in his hands.” After hearing this, 1 definitely couldn’t let him die so easily, so 1 used some cultivation methods to make him scream for two to three hours! If it wasn’t for the fact that 1 wanted him to suffer a little more, 1 would have returned earlier than now!”

“Scream for two to three hours?” Tang Yitian couldn’t help but shiver.

Xia ruofei laughed as he called Grello. He explained to Tang Yitian what happened after he was struck by the heart – devouring finger, especially what he felt after being struck by it.

Hearing this, Tang Yitian was even more shocked. He was stunned for a long time before he said,””This method … Is ruthless! However, to deal with Grello … A person like kalini can’t be too cruel.”

Just then, the phone on the table in Tang Yitian’s study rang….
