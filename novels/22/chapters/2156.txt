2157 Wealth comes from danger (2)

After the mansion – guarding wooden token absorbed Xia ruofei’s blood, the milky white glow on it suddenly increased.

The next moment, the wooden token floated up. After a short pause, it turned into a white light and entered Xia ruofei’s body.

With Xia ruofei’s reaction speed, even if a bullet was shot at him, he could subconsciously avoid it. However, he could only watch helplessly as the mansion – guarding wooden tablet entered his body. He did not even have a subconscious reaction.

Xia ruofei could feel the wooden token entering his body and appearing in his dantian.

Then, the house – guarding wooden tablet began to emit a mysterious aura. This aura seemed to have intelligence and wrapped around the true Qi in Xia ruofei’s dantian. Then, this aura began to change continuously ...

Xia ruofei didn’t even dare to breathe as he clenched the painting in his hand.

He was thinking that if the wooden token determined that he was not a righteous cultivator and triggered the attack array on the wooden token, he would immediately hide in the spirit map space.

Although he had no way to resist the mansion – guarding wooden token’s attack from his dantian, and it was almost impossible for his dantian to be preserved, it was likely to be shattered in an instant. However, the probability of his survival was slightly higher in the space.

After all, he could use the power of the entire space inside. He was almost the absolute master. By then, he might be able to use the invisible spatial force to dissolve this attack. Even if his cultivation was destroyed, he could at least keep his life.

Hence, Xia ruofei was highly focused and paid close attention to the status of the wooden token at every moment.

Soon, Xia ruofei realized that the aura released by the mansion – guarding wooden token had changed and was almost the same as the genuine Qi in his dantian.

Could it be that this aura also had the ability to learn and copy? Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea.

After the evolution, the aura quickly returned to the wooden token.

The mansion – guarding wooden tablet sat quietly in Xia ruofei’s dantian, emitting a milky white light. After the aura returned to the wooden token, the Halo suddenly grew a little.

Xia ruofei was so scared that he almost teleported into the spirit map space to look at him. He thought that the wooden token had started to attack.

Fortunately, at this moment, bi youzi, who had been frozen in a daze, spoke again.

He had a very kind smile on his face and said,””Congratulations! Junior, you have already obtained the recognition of the mansion – guarding wooden token! This means that you are a cultivator of the same path as me! I, bi youzi, am very pleased that my inheritance in the human world can be handed over to a fellow cultivator!”

After hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but let out a long sigh of relief. The heavy stone in his heart was finally lifted.

It was obvious that bi youzi’s image would only be triggered after the residence – guarding wooden token confirmed that the person who performed the blood contract was not an evil demon.

Xia ruofei only realized then that the back of his shirt was already drenched in sweat.

This process didn’t last long, but he felt like a hundred years had passed. The mental pressure was too great.

After the mansion – guarding wooden token confirmed Xia ruofei’s identity as a righteous cultivator, he could clearly feel that his spiritual connection with the token had become closer. Without anyone’s reminder, Xia ruofei already knew how to refine this wooden token.

In fact, the method was very simple. The first step was to drip blood on it to recognize it as its master. After the wooden token was put into the dantian, it was a painstaking process. One needed to constantly inject mental power into the wooden token and refine it bit by bit.

The time required for this process was inversely proportional to one’s cultivation.

If Xia ruofei was a nascent soul realm cultivator, the refining process would be very short. At most, it would only take one or two days.

If Xia ruofei’s cultivation was higher, he could even refine the wooden token with a single thought.

At that level, even an evil cultivator would be able to easily refine the mansion – guarding wooden token’s attack array, which might not be able to hurt him.

Of course, if one’s cultivation had reached such a high level, this small green immortal mansion would probably not have any attraction.

Xia ruofei was only in the Qi refining stage and had not even cultivated the most basic vital Qi. Although his spiritual power cultivation was higher than his genuine Qi cultivation, there was a limit to it. If he wanted to rely on this little bit of cultivation to completely refine this wooden token, he did not know how long he would have to wait.

However, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He had already kept the mansion – guarding wooden token in his dantian. In other words, this immortal mansion was already in his pocket. Even after he left, the immortal Island would be completely closed until he had completely refined the mansion – guarding wooden token and came back to take the immortal mansion.

Even if it would take a long time, it was only a matter of time for Xia ruofei. Moreover, he had obtained precious origin crystals this time. His cultivation would definitely progress at a tremendous pace. As his cultivation level increased, the speed at which he refined the wooden token would also increase.

Xia ruofei continued to inject his spiritual power into the wooden token happily.

Through this direct test, Xia ruofei also felt the difficulty of refining the residence – guarding wooden token.

Although it was only for a short while, he had poured all of his spiritual power into it, and the consumption was not small. However, he felt that the progress of refining the mansion – guarding wooden token was not even one – millionth.

It could be seen that to completely refine this wooden token, how big of a project would it be?

Even if Xia ruofei could continuously maintain his full spiritual power output without rest, it would probably take a few years.

And Xia ruofei couldn’t possibly not eat or sleep. He couldn’t just sit and refine the wooden token without doing anything. Moreover, his spiritual power couldn’t withstand such a continuous output! Therefore, it might take even longer.

At this moment, bi youzi revealed a complicated expression and said,””Junior, I’ll give you everything that I’ve left behind ... Accept my kindness and tie my karma. Remember, I, bi youzi, am a third generation disciple of the Jade void temple. If you meet any Junior Disciples of the Jade void temple in the future, if you have the ability, help take care of them. Go! Hahaha ...”

Xia ruofei looked at bi youzi, who was on the throne. Bi youzi laughed carefreely, and then his image began to slowly dissipate, finally returning to nothingness.

“Jade void temple ...” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.”Senior bi youzi, I’ll remember it!” However, there are many Taoist temples in China called Jade void temple! How do I know which one is your sect?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know that there were many Taoist temples called Jade void temple. However, more than a thousand years ago in the cultivation world, Jade void temple was the only one.

The real cultivators of the Jade void temple were naturally different from the Taoist priests in the Taoist temple. Of course, most of them had already hidden from the world. The chances of Xia ruofei meeting them were very low. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After bi youzi’s image disappeared, Xia ruofei did not put all his effort into refining the residence – guarding wooden token because he knew that it was not something that could be done in a short period of time. He only maintained a wisp of mental energy and continuously penetrated the wooden token. Most of his energy was still focused on searching for the realm stone.

One had to know that the first goal of this trip had not yet been achieved! If they still could not find the realm stone after spending so much effort, Xia ruofei would not mind. After all, his harvest was already big enough. However, wouldn’t that white realm Fox go crazy?

Xia ruofei wasn’t worried that there were no realm stones in green touring immortal abode because the White realm Fox and the sensing Jade Leaf couldn’t have made a mistake at the same time. The sensing Jade Leaf on his chest was still burning hot!

What he was worried about was that the world stone was like the other treasures he had seen before, protected by a powerful array barrier.

Although he had already taken the mansion – guarding wooden tablet, the degree of refining it was extremely low. After all, he was only a Qi condensation cultivator. He basically had no way of activating any of the immortal estate’s restrictions.

Of course, it was even more impossible for him to destroy it by force with his cultivation base.

If the world stone was really within the restriction, he could only watch helplessly ...
