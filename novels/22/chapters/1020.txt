Chapter 1021: Can’t be biased (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei did not need to worry about the abalones in the spirit map space. In such a good natural sea environment with rich spiritual Qi, they would definitely grow and grow in the future. When the time came, the sales rights in the United States would be given to shengbang group.

Anyway, as long as it was not an investment, Xia ruofei would still welcome normal cooperation.

What’s more, shengbang group had a great influence in the United States, and their sales channels were also very complete. If paradise Corporation wanted to explore the United States market, shengbang group was a very suitable partner.

“Deal!” Tang He was overjoyed. Ruofei, I’ll keep an eye on this auction. I’ve already applied for a flight route for my private jet. I’m going to return to the United States directly, so I’ll take my leave first!”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,’this old man can’t be in such a hurry to leave because he can’t wait to taste the one – headed abalone, can he?

It was no wonder that Xia ruofei was so suspicious. After all, when Guo Song and the others came over just now, old master Tang did not seem to be in a hurry to leave. Instead, he was just watching from the side. Now that he had obtained two top – Quality one – headed abalones and even applied for the flight route, it was really unreasonable for him to be in a hurry to leave.

However, Xia ruofei would not expose her stupidly. He just smiled and said,””Since that’s the case, I won’t keep you! I’ll see you out, old Mr. Tang!”

Xia ruofei and Tang He walked side by side to the entrance of the villa. The personal assistant who had already placed the abalone came forward and handed over a cash check with both hands.

Tang He took the check and looked at the amount. Then, he took out a gold pen from his pocket and signed his name on it. He handed it to Xia ruofei with a smile.

The transaction of the two one – headed abalones involved 6 million Chinese dollars. Although it was not a small amount, there was no need to go through an offshore company account. Tang He directly wrote a cash check in Chinese dollars.

After all, this amount of money was equivalent to more than one million USD. The offshore company had more than twelve million USD from the gold Phoebe nanmu transaction and had plenty of funds. In addition, the profits from Paradise Farm and the winery would be settled with the offshore company. Once things got on track, it would be at least ten million USD a month. Hence, Xia ruofei settled this small amount in HxB.

He didn’t even want to deposit it into the company’s public account. He would just keep it in his personal account for his daily use.

Xia ruofei took the check and put it in his pocket without even looking at it. Then, he sent Tang He to the car and the two waved goodbye. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei watched as the car left the villa’s courtyard before he turned around and returned to his house.

As soon as he entered the living room, Xia ruofei heard his phone, which he had just put on the coffee table, vibrate.

He quickly walked over and picked up his phone. He looked at the caller ID and saw that it was MA Xiong from Hong Kong.

Xia ruofei could guess why MA Xiong was calling. He smiled and answered the phone.”Mr. MA, how are you?”

“Xia Sheng! I’ve seen the photos and videos of your company’s dried abalones!” MA Xiong’s voice was filled with excitement.”That really gave me a huge shock ...”

On the way back to the hotel, Guo Song had already asked Luo Jiahao to send a copy of the materials they had collected today to MA Xiong.

Guo Song realized that his boss would definitely be interested in these things.

As expected, MA Xiong called Guo Song personally and asked him about the dried abalone in detail.

Guo Song couldn’t stop praising the abalones. He even felt that no words of praise could compare to the top – Quality one – headed abalones. It was only when he saw the heavy and huge one – headed abalones placed together with his own eyes that he could feel the strong visual impact.

After MA Xiong understood the situation, he called Xia ruofei immediately without delay.

Xia ruofei joked,”Mr. MA, I think I told you about the dried abalone before!” Did you not trust me before?”

MA Xiong was a little embarrassed.”I naturally have complete trust in Xia Sheng, but I was still shocked when I saw the photos and videos of the abalones with my own eyes ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

“Xiasheng, I have a presumptuous request ...” MA Xiong asked.

“Mr. MA, I’ll reserve two one – headed abalones for you. However, I’m planning to keep the three heaviest ones for the finale of the auction. I hope you can understand ...” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei was well aware of MA Xiong’s intention for calling him in a hurry. He had already sold two abalones when Tang He asked for it, so MA Xiong could not be biased. He just had to do it according to Tang He’s standards.

Of course, this was the end of the ‘back door’. Otherwise, there would only be 25 one – headed abalones in total, which would not be auctioned at all.

MA Xiong was overjoyed,”alright!” Xia Sheng, thank you!”

MA Xiong did not think that Xia ruofei would leave the three largest pets for him. The rarer an item was, the more valuable it would be. The best would naturally be left for the auction.

The main reason MA Xiong called was that he was worried that Hengfeng auction house would be hosting this batch of abalones, so it wouldn’t be convenient for him, the boss of Hengfeng, to bid for it.

Otherwise, people would say that he deliberately raised the price. Even if he successfully bid for one or two abalones, the media would definitely question that Hengfeng group bought and sold themselves just to hype up a sky – High transaction record.
