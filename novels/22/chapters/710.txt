Chapter 711: Xue Fei shriveled in fear (2)

It must have been him coming up just now, but I didn’t see his hand movements at all. What is this person doing? Xue Fei was shocked and scared.

The knife was about 15 centimeters long and had a gorgeous scabbard on it. It was a gift from someone to his father, the Deputy Mayor, and he used it to show off. Recently, he often brought it with him, saying that it was for self – defense, but in fact, he did not have the courage to use the knife in a real fight.

“What do you want to do?” Xue Fei’s voice was trembling.

Wang Lina also showed a look of fear. What was the use of having a strong background? The ones who rushed were afraid of the dazed ones, the dazed ones were afraid of the horizontal ones, and the horizontal ones were afraid of the ones who didn’t want their lives. What if this guy was a Desperado?

Xia ruofei looked at the knife in his hand with a smile and said,””What a good blade! It should be worth a lot of money, right?”

After saying that, he put his hands together and squeezed the knife in his hands.

Xue Fei and Wang Lina couldn’t help but widen their eyes in disbelief.

The gorgeous knife was like plasticine in Xia ruofei’s hand. He bent it effortlessly and then crumpled it into a ball ...

Xue Fei was very clear that how could someone give his father a common product? This was an authentic dagger from the engisha family! Furthermore, it was personally forged by the master of engisha and was extremely hard. It could not cut through iron like mud, but when used to cut iron bars, iron chips would fly up, while the blade would never break or bend.

Such a high – Quality knife was kneaded like dough in Xia ruofei’s hands. This shocked Xue Fei and he was dumbfounded.

At this moment, Xia ruofei stopped what he was doing. A ball – shaped object appeared in his palm. He could no longer tell the scabbard, the blade, and the handle.

Xia ruofei smiled as he grabbed Xue Fei’s hand and placed the metal ball in his palm. The heat from the metal ball brought Xue Fei back to his senses and he looked at Xia ruofei in horror.

Xia ruofei’s display of power had far exceeded his imagination.

......

Xia ruofei continued to smile gently and said,””Xue Fei, if Lin Qiao is hurt, you won’t be any better off than this saber. Do you understand?”

Xia ruofei’s tone was very kind, but to Xue Fei, it sounded like a demon. He looked at Xia ruofei in shock and couldn’t help nodding.

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction. He patted Xue Fei’s shoulder and walked back to the electronics mall.

Xue Fei and Wang Lina stood rooted to the ground as they watched Xia ruofei’s back slowly disappear into the distance.

After a long while, Wang Lina asked,””Brother Fei, who is this person? He ... The Lin Qiao he was talking about ... Isn’t she the transfer student from your class? Do you have any grudges with her?”

Xue Fei was upset, but he didn’t show any impatience since he hadn’t slept with Wang Lina yet. He only said,””It’s fine, Lina. You don’t have to worry about this ... Let’s go! Let’s go to the hotel!”

Wang Lina looked at Xue Fei suspiciously. However, due to Xue Fei’s status, she did not dare to ask more. She obediently held Xue Fei’s arm and walked forward.

Both of them had their own thoughts and soon arrived at the hotel.

Xue Fei’s frightened heart gradually calmed down. At the same time, his heart began to burn with passion. He could finally pick the flower Wang Lina ...

What Xue Fei did not expect was that after being scared by Xia ruofei just now, his little brother actually became weak. Facing the naked Wang Lina, he was dejected and could not show his strength.

In the end, Xue Fei had no choice but to give up on his long – planned erotic plan. Facing Wang Lina’s strange gaze, Xue Fei felt extremely angry.

Xia ruofei’s shadow was like a demon that followed him closely, making him tremble in fear.

In the beginning, he didn’t dare to have any evil thoughts about Lin Qiao as he was scared out of his wits.

However, after he failed to break Wang Lina’s home base after a long time in the hotel, Xue Fei became even angrier. He even blamed Lin Qiao for the “injury” that Xia ruofei had caused him.

Xue Fei said hatefully in his heart,”my plan is flawless, no one will be able to tell that I did it. When the time comes, that devil can’t blame it on me, right?” At most, I’ll just hide at home this summer. No matter how awesome he is, he won’t dare to find me in the city government’s family residence. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

……

Xia ruofei didn’t know that his warning had turned Xue Fei into “brother Wei.” He didn’t expect Xue Fei to be so angry that he didn’t even think about stopping.

After he warned Xue Fei, he ran up the stairs to meet Lin Qiao who had been waiting for him.

“Brother ruofei, what took you so long? I thought you fell into the toilet!” Lin Qiao giggled.

Xia ruofei saw Lin Qiao’s smile and couldn’t help but say in his heart,”Hu Zi, don’t worry! As long as I’m here, I won’t let any harm come to our sister! I’ll cripple anyone who dares to touch Qiao’ er!

Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed with a sharp light, but a warm smile soon appeared on his face.””You’ve been waiting anxiously? Let’s go! I’ll take you to buy a computer!”

“En!” Lin Qiao held onto Xia ruofei’s arm.

The two of them walked forward together. Soon, Xia ruofei brought Lin Qiao into a big shop.
