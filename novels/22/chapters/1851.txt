Soon, the flight crew boarded the plane, and yang Wanxin, the Vice President of the airport Group, tactfully took his leave.

Li Yifu introduced them with a smile,”Mr. Xia, this is Captain Liu An, and the one beside him is Captain Zheng Daming. Both of you used to work at the Kester public jet company in the United States. You are the Ace pilots of their company. I specially poached you with a high salary.”

The two pilots quickly said a few words of humility.

Their technology was indeed impressive, but in front of a billionaire like Li Yifu, they naturally didn’t dare to show off.

Xia ruofei nodded at the two of them gently.

Li Yifu then said to the two of them,”Captain Liu, Captain Zheng, you will have to serve Mr. Xia from now on. If Mr. Xia has any requests in terms of flight, you must do your best to meet them. Ensure the safety and efficiency of the flight!”

The two pilots quickly nodded and expressed their stance. In fact, they already knew before they came that they would be working in China for a long time. They were not against it because Li Yifu offered them twice the salary in the United States and very good supporting benefits. Who would not be able to get by with money in this day and age?

Besides, although the two were American nationals, they were not “Banana Men” born in the United States. They only went to the United States later. They also had many relatives and friends in China, so they were not uncomfortable with Chinese society at all.

“Mr. Xia,” Li Yifu continued,”although the two pilots work in the United States and are also American nationals, their Chinese is very fluent. There won’t be any problems communicating with them.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””You’ve considered it very carefully. ”

Then, he said to Liu An and Zheng Daming half – jokingly,””Pilots, I’ll leave the safety of the flight to you two in the future. My fate is in your hands!”

Liu An’s experience was relatively older than Zheng Daming ‘s, and the flight duration of the Bay stream was also longer than Zheng Daming’ s. Therefore, in this dual – Pilot configuration, he was the captain, and Zheng Daming was the co – Pilot.

Hence, after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Liu An immediately said,””Mr. Xia, don’t worry! The Gulfstream aircraft’s safety performance is even better than that of a commercial plane. Moreover, the total flight time of the two of us on the Gulfstream series aircraft is over 10000 hours. We will definitely do our best to ensure flight safety. ”

On the side, Zheng Da Ming also smiled and said,”To be honest, we’ve both heard of Mr. Xia’s name like thunder! The epic descent not long ago has already spread to everyone in the flying circle. Including us old Fei, we all admire Mr. Xia a lot!”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”I’m just trying to push the duck onto the rack. I can’t be compared to you two in terms of professionalism!” However, if I have time, I can consider getting a private jet driver’s license. ”

“Mr. Xia’s flying talent is beyond doubt. If you learn to fly, I believe you will be able to pass very quickly.” Zheng Da Ming flattered at the right time.

Li Yifu saw that Xia ruofei and the two pilots were chatting very harmoniously and was very happy.

“Have you applied for the flight route?” he asked.

“I’ve already reported it!” Liu An quickly replied,”it should be approved soon! Mr. Li, Mr. Xia, we’ll go get ready for flight!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Thank you for your hard work!”

“You’re welcome, this is our job!” Liu An quickly said.

Then, he and Zheng Da Ming nodded at Li Yifu and Xia ruofei and strode towards the cockpit.

Li Yifu was right. When the flight attendant closed the door and the preparations in the cockpit were almost done, the flight route application was approved, and they soon received the order to slide out.

After the plane was pushed back a little, it steadily drove on the runway.

After waiting for a while at the runway, a Boeing 747 landed and left the runway. The Gulfstream G650 was allowed to enter the runway and take off.

Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and the rest put on their seatbelts. The three air stewardesses stopped their service and returned to the front cabin to sit down and put on their seatbelts.

The plane turned nimbly onto the runway and did not stop. After adjusting the nose of the plane, it began to accelerate.

With a strong push, the plane jumped lightly and took off steadily.

Then, the plane began to rise rapidly.

The Gulfstream plane’s cruising altitude was higher than that of the general civil aircraft, and it would fly more stably at that altitude.

However, today was the day of the take – off and landing, so the plane did not climb to the cruising altitude. It was flat before it entered the clouds, then it made a turn in the air and flew in the direction of the sea.

This was also designed in advance. If they flew into the clouds, there would be nothing but a sea of clouds below, and they would not be able to enjoy any scenery at all.

It was not Ling Qingxue’s first time flying, but it was her first time in such a luxurious private business jet. She looked at the scenery outside the porthole with excitement.

Sanshan airport was by the sea, so the plane quickly arrived above the sea.

Today’s weather was good. From this height, the ships on the sea were only the size of matchboxes. They could clearly see the ship dragging a white track. There were some small sailboats in the distance, which were even smaller, almost as small as white spots.

The entire dark blue background was dotted with ships of all sizes, which looked very spectacular.

After the plane was level, the flight attendants began to perform their duties and served exquisite pastries and fragrant red wine.

Xia ruofei sat on the soft leather seat and raised his glass to Li Yifu. He smiled and said,””Foster husband, this plane is really good! He had thought that such a small plane would be a little bumpy when flying, but he didn’t expect it to be even more stable than a large commercial plane. And the noise control is very good, much less than a commercial plane!”

Li Yifu quickly raised his glass and said,””It’s good that Mr. Xia likes it!”

This was not the first flight of the plane, but it was the first flight in the true sense since Xia ruofei took over.

After flying in the sky for about 20 minutes, the plane started to descend slowly. It drew a beautiful arc over the sea and flew towards the airport.

Ten minutes later, the Gulfstream G650 landed lightly on the runway of Sanshan airport. The landing process was very smooth, and the red wine on the table did not shake at all. It seemed that the performance of this plane was indeed quite good. Otherwise, it would not have been the first choice of so many rich people.

Of course, this was also inseparable from the superb skills of the two pilots.

The plane left the runway and returned to the parking spot along the runway. The test flight was successfully over.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue both felt that it was not enough, but today was just a test flight. In the future, they could use this plane whenever they needed it, so Xia ruofei was quite satisfied with this first flight.

He personally went to the control cabin to express his gratitude to the two pilots, then stepped off the plane with Ling Qingxue and Li Yifu.

As for the flight crew, they still had to stay behind to do some post – Flight work. Their food and living arrangements were naturally arranged by the staff of the Kyushu group’s Southeast Branch, so Xia ruofei did not need to worry about it.

The group left the tarmac on the shuttle bus.

Xia ruofei said to Li Yifu,”Yifu, please send us back to the farm first!” Also, if you have any questions about cultivation, feel free to ask. I’ll try my best to answer them. ”

“Thank you, senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said excitedly.

Now, as long as there were no outsiders around, Li Yifu had to respectfully address Xia ruofei as “senior granduncle”.

Li Yifu had come all the way to Huaxia. Naturally, Xia ruofei would not let him make a wasted trip. It was easy for him to give him a few pointers on cultivation.

Of course, Xia ruofei would definitely not let Li Yifu stay in Tao Yuan farm’s Xuanji. Even if Ling Qingxue was going back today, she would still come back to the farm soon. He still had to cultivate with Ling Qingxue! What’s the deal with an old man joining their two – person world?

Therefore, he only needed to give a few pointers and then let Li Yifu go back to the city to stay in a hotel.
