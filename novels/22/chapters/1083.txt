Chapter 1084: Chapter 685 – remorse (1)

Translator: 549690339

Li Yao immediately frowned and glared at Dong Xinyu.

What kind of occasion was this? In front of him was the world’s richest man, Tang Yitian! This woman’s flustered behavior was really too rude! “This kind of small star is really not presentable ...” Li Yao thought to himself. He was already starting to regret bringing Dong Xinyu and Fang Hongli here.

However, when he saw Dong Xinyu’s dumbstruck expression and followed her gaze, he could not help but widen his eyes and mouth as if he had seen a ghost.

Naturally, Li Yao and the other two saw Xia ruofei with a contemplative look on his face and Feng Jing with her brows slightly furrowed.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were walking with their backs facing them, and the seats were so high up. Li Yao also knew that Xia ruofei and Feng Jing worked for a small company in the southeast province. He didn’t expect that these two people were qualified to eat at the same table as Tang Yitian.

Therefore, when Li Yao, Dong Xinyu, and Fang Hongli saw Xia ruofei, it was as if they were frozen in place.

Dong Xinyu’s heart was filled with incomparable fear at this moment.

She was going to play the second female lead in “the angel of doom” soon, and this movie was funded by Tang Yitian’s Meiya entertainment.

When they were at the booth, Dong Xinyu and Fang Hongli did not care about Xia ruofei and Feng Jing at all. They thought that it was fine to offend such a small company and that it would not affect them at all.

However, they didn’t expect that these two little bosses in their eyes were actually drinking and talking happily with the world – Class rich Tang Yitian, while they were stupidly walking into the muzzle of a gun.

Dong Xinyu’s throat moved up and down a few times, but she did not make any sound. Her body trembled slightly, and she looked at Xia ruofei with a pleading look.

If Xia ruofei had not seen her arrogant and rude appearance, he might have been deceived by this illusion and felt a little sympathy for her.

However, Xia ruofei had no sympathy for her now.

Fang Hongli was also frightened. She stood there, not knowing what to do.

How sharp were Tang Yitian’s eyes? When he saw the expressions of the three people, he immediately raised his eyebrows and asked,””Ruofei, do you know President li and the others?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”We just met. We don’t know each other.”

Seeing that Xia ruofei didn’t complain to Tang Yitian, Li Yao and the other two were slightly relieved.

It wasn’t that Xia ruofei was magnanimous, but that he didn’t want to do it. At the same time, he didn’t know what relationship Tang Yitian had with these three people. Moreover, Tang Yitian’s base was in Australia, so he didn’t want to make things difficult for Tang Yitian.

However, even if Xia ruofei did not say anything, Feng Rao could not help but feel indignant.

It was Xia ruofei’s persuasion that had slowly calmed her down. Now that she had seen Dong Xinyu and Fang Hongli, all the unhappiness from before came back to her.

“Mr. Tang, a big star like miss Dong is beyond our reach!” Feng Jing pouted.

Dong Xinyu almost collapsed to the ground when she heard this. She was at a loss.

No matter how slow Tang Yitian was, he could tell that Xia ruofei and Dong Xinyu were not on good terms with each other. Moreover, Tang Yitian was not slow at all.

He immediately frowned and asked,””Ruofei, what’s going on?”

Xia ruofei laughed nonchalantly and said, “It’s nothing, big brother Tang! You don’t have to worry about this, I can handle it myself!”

Tang Yitian’s face darkened, and he pretended to be angry,””RUO Fei, you’re not treating me as a brother! Could it be that I, Tang Yitian, am a person who is afraid of trouble? Do you think that this isn’t Australia and my words don’t matter?”

When Li Yao and the other two heard this, they were so scared that their faces turned pale, especially Dong Xinyu. Her body began to tremble uncontrollably. If it was not for Fang Hongli holding her, she would have collapsed on the ground.

The little boss of a company in the countryside actually called Mr. Tang his brother!

“Who did I offend ...” Dong Xinyu cried out in her heart. At this moment, she was filled with regret.

If she hadn’t sought her own death and agreed to be the spokesperson of paradise Corporation, but was tempted by Li Yao’s conditions and changed her mind right before the contract was signed, she would have already become the spokesperson of paradise corporation’s brand image.

If that was the case, then she could have a good relationship with the boss of Maya Entertainment. Seeing how close Xia ruofei was with Tang Yitian and his wife, she might even be able to play the female lead if he said something.

But now ... Not only was it all in vain, but he had also offended Xia ruofei. It was hard to say whether “Angel of doom” would be a success or not.

The difference of a single thought was heaven and hell.

“I didn’t mean it that way, big brother Tang ...” Xia ruofei forced a smile.

“Then tell me what’s going on!” Tang Yitian said.

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Rao with a hint of blame and said helplessly,””Big brother Tang, we’re here on a business trip to Beijing this time to find a brand ambassador for the company’s new product. President Feng has basically decided on the candidate after some inspection and remote negotiations ...”

Tang Yitian glanced at the dazed Dong Xinyu and asked,””Is this the Miss Dong you’ve booked?”

“But due to some reasons, we didn’t sign the contract ...” Xia ruofei nodded.

Tang Yitian gave Li Yao a meaningful look. Although Xia ruofei didn’t explain it clearly, with his intelligence, he had already guessed the whole story.

Li Yao immediately felt like he was being stabbed in the back. He hurried to say,””Mr. Xia, I didn’t know that your company had already reached an oral agreement with miss Dong. I was too rash in this matter, please forgive me! We ... We’ll terminate the contract with miss Dong immediately!”

At this moment, Dong Xinyu had also regained her senses. She quickly said,”Mr. Xia, miss Feng, I ... I’m willing to endorse paradise corporation’s products! Please give me a chance, I ... I don’t want any endorsement fees, I’ll endorse you for free!”

Xia ruofei frowned slightly, but before he could speak, Jennifer, who had been silent all this time, suddenly said,””This miss Dong ... Why do I find her a little familiar?”

Dong Xinyu broke out in a cold sweat. If it was not for today’s incident, she would have been recognized by the head of Maya Entertainment and the world – Class superstar, Jennifer. It would probably be enough for her to brag about for years.

But in this case, she would rather Jennifer not recognize her at all. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Under Jennifer’s burning gaze, Dong Xinyu revealed a smile that was uglier than crying. She said in a trembling voice,””Ms. Jennifer, I ... I’m dong Xinyu, the actress who played Lu Yao in ‘the angel of doom’...”

Jennifer suddenly remembered. No wonder she felt like she had seen Dong Xinyu somewhere before.

“Angel of doom” was the first time that Maya Co. Ltd. Had tried to work with a Chinese distributor. They had hired a gold – medal screenwriter from Hollywood to personally produce the movie. Many of the characters in the movie were Chinese, and the background of the story was also in China.

During the casting, even though Jennifer did not do it herself, the information of the selected actors would eventually be reported to her, so she had seen Dong Xinyu’s makeup photos.

Dong Xinyu was still looking at Jennifer, hoping that the matter would not be too bad.

After all, Xia ruofei didn’t mention the details of the conflict just now, and although Feng Jing looked very indignant, she didn’t say anything more. So, Tang Yitian and Jennifer didn’t know that she had an ugly face when she faced Xia ruofei and Feng Jing just now.

Moreover, she felt that her attitude of admitting her mistake just now was still very good, so she still had a trace of hope in her heart.

To Dong Xinyu’s surprise, after Jennifer nodded slightly, her expression immediately turned serious and she said firmly,””Miss Dong Xinyu, on behalf of Meiya entertainment, I would like to officially inform you that you have been fired from the production team of ‘the angel of doom’. We will re – Select the second female lead!”

Dong Xinyu was dumbfounded. Her manager, Fang Hongli, was also stunned, her face pale.

This Jennifer was too decisive!

Furthermore,”Angel of doom” was extremely important to Dong Xinyu, whose stardom had just begun to take a turn for the better. It was a once – in – a – lifetime opportunity for a talent show Celebrity like her to be able to get such an opportunity.

When it was confirmed that she would be able to star in “Angel of doom”, Dong Xinyu felt as if she was floating in the air. It was as if she could see the scene of herself shining on the red carpet in the near future.

He didn’t expect that because of a small conflict, all of this would come to naught.

After Dong Xinyu regained her senses, she quickly pleaded,””Ms. Jennifer, I ... It was just a misunderstanding with Mr. Xia. I know I’m wrong. Please ... Don’t fire me ...”

Then, Dong Xinyu grabbed Xia ruofei’s hand and said,””Mr. Xia, I failed to recognize Mount Tai just now. Please forgive me and help me speak up! I can’t lose this opportunity! I ... I’m willing to be your company’s spokesperson for free, no matter how many years you want me to sign!”

Xia ruofei let go of Dong Xinyu’s hand in disgust and said indifferently,””Miss Dong, our company can’t possibly hire someone who doesn’t keep his word and has bad character to be our spokesperson.”

Dong Xinyu’s heart sank to the bottom of the valley. Tears streamed down her face as she cried,””Ms. Jennifer, I know I’m wrong. Please give me another chance ...” He said.

Fang Hongli, who was holding onto Dong Xinyu, was also begging for mercy.

Li Yao, the instigator, had already retreated a few steps away with a pale face. He did not even dare to plead for mercy.

Jennifer frowned slightly and said,”miss Dong, you’re a public figure now, so please take note of your image!” You guys go back first! The production team will send you an official notice soon. ”

Dong Xinyu looked at Xia ruofei in a daze and then at Jennifer, who had a cold expression. She suddenly broke free from Fang Hongli, pointed at Jennifer’s nose and said loudly,””On what basis? What right do you have to treat me like this? Is it because I didn’t agree to be the spokesperson for paradise Corporation? It’s my freedom to endorse any company I want!”
