Chapter 647: In full swing (3)

Xia ruofei was covered in sweat and dirt. He ran to the bathroom and took a thorough shower.

As soon as he came out, Xia ruofei immediately lay on the bed to take a nap. He was really exhausted this time, especially after not sleeping for dozens of hours. He felt very dispirited.

However, before he could fall asleep, he was woken up by a phone call.

The call was from Ling Xiaotian. It turned out that tomorrow was the “wine” day of the Eight Immortals drunk. Ling Xiaotian had asked Xia ruofei in advance if he was ready.

Xia ruofei quickly said that they had arrived in advance. Tomorrow, the winery would send a car over to bring the new wine and the improved Drunken Eight Immortals back.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

These two things had to be done at the same time. He had planned to go to the warehouse the next day to take out the iron – Skin Dendrobium fresh strips from the medium and find a car to transport them back to the farm.

This time, he could do two things at the same time.

That was why Xia ruofei had asked Ling Xiaotian to get another small truck for him.

After hanging up, Xia ruofei set an alarm to turn off his phone. Then, he turned off the power and fell into a deep sleep.

The next morning, Xia ruofei was woken up by the alarm on his phone. He quickly got out of bed and washed up.

After a night’s rest, his spirit had almost completely recovered.

Xia ruofei got dressed and went downstairs to get a Knight XV. He first went to the staff cafeteria to have breakfast before driving to the warehouse in the city.

......

Xia ruofei first took out the one – month wine jar from the medium and arranged it neatly.

Then, he took out a dozen large wine jars that were slightly different from the previous ones and placed them in front of the one month wine jar. These were three month wine jars.

Finally, Xia ruofei took out the iron – Skin Dendrobium strips that he had already packed into the bag from the medium.

He waited in the warehouse for a while before the convoy from the winery arrived. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Xia ruofei asked the small truck to drive to the entrance of the warehouse first and asked the movers to load the Ironhide and vessel – like fresh strips into the truck.

Then, the workers began to move the wine jars skillfully.

Jars of new wine were unloaded from the car and placed on the other side of the warehouse.

Meanwhile, the ‘improved’ jar of wine from the Drunken Eight Immortals was being carried onto the emptied truck.

Soon, the winery’s car left the warehouse with the Drunken Eight Immortals wine. Xia ruofei drove the small truck back to Taoyuan farm.

After returning to the farm, Xia ruofei called the Veterans to unload the truck and move the fresh strips into the small warehouse in the workshop.

After he was done, Lei Hu gave Xia ruofei a call. He had already picked up master Luo and the rest at the train station.

Before Xia ruofei left, he had arranged for Lei Hu to pick him up at the station. He had borrowed a seven – seater business car from lingji restaurant.

After master Luo and the others returned to the farm, they had a simple lunch and immediately began to process the iron – Skin Dendrobium fresh strips.

When master Luo saw that the quality of the fresh noodles was as good as ever, he was full of energy. He led the farm employees who had been learning for more than a month and began to work in full swing.

Xia ruofei was also in a good mood as he watched from the side, occasionally giving a hand.

In the afternoon, Jiang Hua and manager li came to the workshop to find Xia ruofei. The budget for the fish pond transformation had been prepared.
