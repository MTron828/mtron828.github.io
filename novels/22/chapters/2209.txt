2210 Meeting_Song Wei was about to end the video call when Ling Qingxue suddenly appeared. She was stunned. Her eyes were wide open as she stared at her phone screen. She did not move an inch, as if the video call was stuck.

Xia ruofei was also stunned. Then, he said in his heart,”You’re the one who exposed yourself, so you can’t blame me!

As he thought about it, he looked at Ling Qingxue carefully.

Song Wei was stunned for a while before she came back to her senses. She looked very embarrassed and did not dare to look at the screen. She bit her cherry lips and said,”Qingxue ... So ... So you’re here too!”

Ling Qingxue could empathize with Song Wei’s pain, which was why she had jumped out in a moment of impulse. Now, she was also a little regretful, because the situation was too awkward.

Even though this was not a face – to – Face conversation between the three of them, the atmosphere of awkwardness was very thick.

Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Song Wei, I’ve heard about what happened between you two ...”

“I’m sorry, Qingxue!” Song Wei quickly said.

“This isn’t your fault ...” Ling Qingxue sighed and said,”I’m not an unreasonable person. RUO Fei has already told me about it. You were poisoned because you were trying to help him. In addition, the matter of cultivation ... It was purely an accident. No one can be blamed for this. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel surprised. Ling Qingxue was actually so reasonable? She wasn’t like this before the video call! Once a woman threw a tantrum, who cared if it was reasonable or not?

It was a huge mistake to reason with a woman.

Song Wei didn’t know what Ling Qingxue meant by that, so she just went along with her and said,””Qingxue, you’re right. This was indeed an accident. “But ... It’s all my fault. If I wasn’t so anxious, I could have waited for ruofei and I to improve our cultivation before getting rid of the peach blossom miasma. Maybe it wouldn’t have been so dangerous. Ruofei wouldn’t have taken the risk and rushed into the core of my sea of consciousness. Then, there wouldn’t have been those things ... So, you can’t blame ruofei. If you want to blame someone, blame me for being too anxious ...”

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei unhappily and said,””Don’t take all the responsibility on yourself. This guy might be secretly happy!”

“I didn’t ...” Xia ruofei immediately explained.

“You shut up!” Song Wei and Ling Qingxue said in unison.

After saying that, the two of them felt a little embarrassed and their faces became slightly hot.

Ling Qingxue said to Xia ruofei,”you have no right to speak here!” We haven’t even found lunch yet! Hurry up and go fishing!”

“Oh ... Then you guys can talk ...” Xia ruofei awkwardly handed his phone to Ling Qingxue and then ran away.

He knew that the best thing to do at this time was to hide far away. The two women were like gunpowder barrels now. Perhaps he would just sit there and detonate their emotions.

Xia ruofei obediently took the fishing net and came to the affinity platform at the end of the yacht.

Of course, he couldn’t really focus on fishing. He was just mindlessly digging and pulling in the net. It didn’t matter if he got anything or not. Most of his attention was still on Ling Qingxue.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already spread out. He was carefully observing Ling Qingxue’s situation, afraid that she would fall out with Song Wei again.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was much higher than Song Wei ‘s, so his spying did not attract Ling Qingxue’s attention.

After Xia ruofei left, Ling Qingxue sighed and said to Song Wei,””Song Wei, tell me ... What do you plan to do?”

Song Wei blushed and said,”My thoughts ... RUO Fei should have told you, right? At that time, I was the one who suggested for you to come into contact with the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra.” Other than feeling that cultivating it would bring you countless benefits, there was another important purpose. I hoped that after you personally experience the feeling of cultivating it, you could understand us ...”

“Don’t you think this suggestion is too ridiculous?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t take it anymore. She frowned and said,”what era is it now? Which man would have three wives and four concubines? Why can men be so fickle?”

“Qingxue, I know that you’re feeling indignant. After all, RUO Fei is your boyfriend. I ... Although it was an accident, I’m still the disgraceful third party ...” Song Wei said awkwardly.

When she said this, Song Wei could not help but lower her head in shame.

However, Ling Qingxue suddenly asked,””Song Wei, you’ve liked him even before you combined cultivation with his spirit body, right?”

Song Wei was stunned when she heard that. She looked up at the screen.

Ling Qingxue was also staring at the camera. From Song Wei’s angle, it was as if Ling Qingxue was looking at her. Her gaze seemed to be able to see through her heart and it made her panic. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After hesitating for a while, Song Wei nodded her head.

“As expected ...” Ling Qingxue said softly.

“Qingxue, please don’t misunderstand. Even RUO Fei doesn’t know about this. I’ve been keeping it to myself ...” Song Wei quickly explained.

“He doesn’t know?” Ling Qingxue was in disbelief.”Men and women are very sensitive to such things. If you have feelings for him, he can definitely feel it. Maybe he’s just secretly happy!”
