This pair of wood carvings was about 50 centimeters tall. They looked simple and dignified. They were painted in Vermilion. The divine beast under the door God’s throne was also painted in gold. Whether it was the red or gold paint, it had become mottled with the erosion of time, revealing the paint inside.

While Xia ruofei was looking at it, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui were also staring at the wood carvings. They wanted to see what was so special about this ordinary – looking wood carving.

Song Rui knew nothing about antiques, and Zhao Yongjun was not good at wood. The mystery of wood carvings did not lie in the wood carvings themselves, so the two naturally could not see anything.

Some hard materials, such as rocks and porcelain, could not be completely penetrated by the power of the mind, so the exploration of the power of the mind was not omnipotent. For example, it was basically impossible to use the power of the mind to detect whether there was Jade in the raw stone. The resistance would be very high if the stone was penetrated a little bit.

Of course, if Xia ruofei wanted to detect the Jade content in the raw stone, he only needed to use the spirit map scroll. He did not need to use his spiritual power.

Even though mental power was not omnipotent, it was still very useful to investigate this wooden tool.

In particular, the mystery of this wood carving was actually very simple, but it was concealed very well. Even if one had a good eye, it would not be easy to see through it.

However, with Xia ruofei’s spiritual power, everything was revealed.

Like a CT scan, Xia ruofei scanned the wood carving bit by bit with his mental energy. Soon, he found that there was a secret at the base of the wood carving.

He immediately revealed a smile.

“Ruofei, did you see anything?” song Rui asked impatiently.

Xia ruofei smiled at the two of them and took out a sharp military dagger. “I’ll show you a magic trick!”

Then, Xia ruofei picked up one of the wood carvings and placed it on the table.

Xia ruofei used his military dagger to scratch the base of the wood carving, and a piece of mottled paint was cut off.

“Hey ...” Song Rui called out, trying to stop Xia ruofei.

Although the wood carving was not very expensive, it was still worth thousands of Yuan. This cut had destroyed the paint that had naturally formed due to the erosion of time, and the wood carving was basically useless.

However, Xia ruofei was so fast that song Rui could not stop him in time.

On the other hand, Zhao Yongjun didn’t make a fuss. Instead, his eyes brightened slightly and he revealed a thoughtful expression.

Xia ruofei’s knife was very fast. In the blink of an eye, almost all the paint at the bottom of the wood carving had been scraped off.

Then, Xia ruofei used the tip of the knife to draw a line on the base. Soon, a small gap was revealed.

Zhao Yongjun’s face changed and he cried out,””The wood carving is hollow? Could it be that something is hidden inside?”

Xia ruofei had already found all the gaps in the base.

He then inserted the tip of the knife into the gap and pried it gently. Soon, a round piece of wood on the base was pried out, revealing a hole.

“There really is a mechanism!” Song Rui shouted,”ruofei, quickly look inside!”

Zhao Yongjun also looked at Xia ruofei in disbelief. The cork and base of the wood carving fit perfectly. The gaps were filled with plaster and then polished flat. It was hard to find any flaws with the naked eye. Furthermore, there was another layer of paint and at least three layers of paint. Even if it had worn down over the years, it was impossible to see the gaps at the bottom.

Xia ruofei had found the secret in such a short time. This was beyond Zhao Yongjun’s imagination.

Xia ruofei smiled and put two fingers into the hole. He quickly took out the item.

When song Rui saw this, he immediately showed a disappointed look and said,””So it’s this! I thought there would be some treasure!”

Xia ruofei took out a gold ingot.

Most people would be overjoyed to see such a large piece of gold. It was worth at least 100000 Yuan! However, song Rui’s expectations were already very high. Now, he naturally felt that there was a big gap.

Zhao Yongjun was an old player in the antique circle. When he saw the gold, he was slightly disappointed, but he quickly thought of something and said,””Something’s wrong! After spending so much effort and hiding it so well, it definitely wasn’t just to hide a gold ingot!”

Xia ruofei, who already knew the answer, smiled and said nothing.

Song Rui couldn’t wait to ask,””Could there be something else inside?”

Zhao Yongjun looked at song Rui with disdain, then said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, I think this gold ingot is just a counterweight! Quickly take a look at the other wood carving, you might find some unexpected gains!”

“Weights?” “What do you mean?” song Rui asked.

“The two wood carvings are of the same material and size,” Zhao Yongjun said.”If there’s something hidden in one of them, the weight will change, and it’ll be easy for people to find out. So I guess the person who hid the thing made the two wood carvings into the same structure. One of them hid something, and the other stuffed a gold ingot of the same weight in! So, the real secret should be in the other wood carving!”

Xia ruofei immediately clapped his hands and said,””Big brother Zhao is indeed experienced, unlike some of our comrades who are so flustered ...”
