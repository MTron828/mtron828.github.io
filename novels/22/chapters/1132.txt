Chapter 1133: The emperor’s Green (2)

Translator: 549690339

“You two experts are bullying a blood amateur. Do you have the guts to do that?” song Rui rolled his eyes.

“This is fun, I’m simply enjoying it!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Go, go, go, cut the crap. Quickly open the other wood carving and take a look!” Song Rui laughed and scolded.

Xia ruofei had already known that the real secret was in the other wood carving. He had also guessed that the thing inside should be made of Jade because the spirit painting scroll would have a very strong reaction when approaching it. Therefore, the Jade must be of very high quality.

He picked up another wood carving and scraped off the paint at the bottom with great familiarity. Sure enough, he soon found a small crack.

Xia ruofei pried open the wooden stopper at the bottom.

“RUO Fei, quickly take a look at what’s inside!” Zhao Yongjun’s eyes were filled with anticipation.

Even the weight was a pure gold ingot, so the real thing hidden here must be even more complicated. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei nodded and put his hand in. At this moment, he could feel the spirit map scroll in his palm shaking violently. Soon, he felt a smooth block. He pinched it and took it out of the hole.

After this well – hidden treasure was revealed, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui gasped at the same time. Then, they slowly opened their mouths, their eyes full of shock.

Even Xia ruofei himself could not help but look surprised.

In front of everyone was a jade square card, about six centimeters in length, four centimeters in width, and nearly two centimeters in thickness. There was a gold base and a diamond inlaid.

This size of Jade was not very big, but it had a kind of soul – stirring beauty. The touch of vivid green rippled in front of the three people’s eyes like blue waves, intoxicating their hearts ...

After a moment, Zhao Yongjun shouted,””Oh my God ... This ... This is the glass type of King’s Green! A large, Jade – Green token ... Oh my God! Oh my God ...”

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t be any more shocked. He used “Oh my God” two times in a row. It was as if there was no other word that could reflect the shock in his heart.

Xia ruofei’s knowledge of jadeite was superficial. However, the violent shaking of the spirit painting scroll had already indicated that the Jade in the wood carving was not simple, so he was already mentally prepared.

Song Rui grew up in a rich family. He might not be an expert in antiques, but he had the basic ability to identify jadeite. When he saw the king’s Green square plate, he couldn’t help but Mutter,””RUO Fei, you Rascal ... You’ve really picked up a great opportunity this time. You’re rich ... You’re rich ...”

“Brother Zhao, tell me about it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”is this Jade token very valuable?”

Zhao Yongjun sized Xia ruofei up with a strange look and sighed,””RUO Fei, I don’t know what to say ... You don’t know anything about antiques, but you were able to point out the flaw of the Yingzi wood incense cabinet. He randomly picked a pair of wood carvings and found that there was a square plate of Imperial Green inside! Your luck is too heaven – defying!”

Xia ruofei smiled and scratched his head.””I’ve always been lucky ... Tell me about this Jade plate!”

“If this King’s Green is real, then it’s worth a lot of money!” Zhao Yongjun said. I’ll put it this way ... If I were to exchange this Emperor’s Green square tile for the courtyard house I told you about this afternoon, there wouldn’t be a problem at all!”

Xia ruofei was stunned as well. He looked at the Jade token in his hand and said,””This small piece of Jade is worth more than 100 million Yuan?”

After he finished speaking, he couldn’t help but weigh the emperor’s Green square card in his hand. The reaction of the spirit map scroll was so strong that he had a hunch that the quality of the Jade inside was very high, but he didn’t expect it to be worth more than a hundred million Yuan.

Xia ruofei’s actions almost gave Zhao Yongjun a heart attack. He quickly said,””Aiyo! Hold on tight! If this Emperor’s Green tile falls to the ground and shatters, that’ll be a hundred or two hundred million wasted!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Big brother Zhao, it’s not that exaggeration...Besides, you haven’t even looked at it carefully! What if it’s a fake?”

Zhao Yongjun shook his head and said,”if it’s a fake, why would they spend so much effort to hide it in the wood carving?” Wasn’t this crazy? Moreover, this wood carving was made during the period of the Wanqing People’s Republic of China. The level of counterfeit Jade during that period couldn’t have reached such a level of confusion and authenticity, so even if you don’t look at it, you can roughly confirm that this should be the real King’s Green square card!”

Then, Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,””But it’s also my first time seeing such a pure glass type of Imperial Green. I can’t let go of such a good opportunity. I have to take a good look!”

Xia ruofei handed it over and said,””Here, take a look!”

“No no no, let’s go to the sofa!” Zhao Yongjun quickly waved his hand. It’s soft on the sofa, so it won’t break even if my hands shake ...”

In fact, there were rules in the antique industry. If one wanted to appraise an object, one definitely couldn’t take it directly from someone else’s hand. The first person had to put it down, and the other person had to pick it up carefully. Otherwise, if it fell to the ground and damaged it, it would be hard to say who would be responsible.

However, Xia ruofei was not in this line of work and naturally did not know the rules, so Zhao Yongjun did not bother to remind him.

The three of them walked to the sofa. Zhao Yongjun took out a pair of gloves and put them on. Then, he carefully took the emperor’s Green jade card from Xia ruofei’s hand. He also took out a small flashlight and a magnifying glass to observe it carefully.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile at song Rui,”brother Zhao, why are you like Doraemon?” You have so many little things on you!”

“This is what I do for a living,” Zhao Yongjun said without even lifting his head.”These are all standard tools!”

“Brother Zhao is a Big Shot in the antique industry in the capital,” song Rui said with a smile.”Xu Qiang’s shop may be big, but it’s just a small shop compared to brother Zhao ‘s!”

“The thing is, I’m interested in this ...” Zhao Yongjun chuckled.

Zhao Yongjun said, but he didn’t delay his appraisal of the king’s Green square card. He looked at it for a long time and even took it off the Golden base. He shone it with his flashlight for a long time before he reluctantly put it down.

Zhao Yongjun’s eyes lit up.”Ruofei, this is indeed a large square plate of the king’s Green of the glass type. Let’s not talk about its cultural value for the time being, just this piece of Jade alone is the best of the best. Its value is immeasurable!”

Xia ruofei was also very happy after hearing this. He said,””Brother Zhao, tell us!”

“Yup! At most, we can only watch the show. ” Song Rui also said,”what’s so good about this piece of Jade?”

Zhao Yongjun immediately became excited at the mention of Jade. He pointed at the king’s Green square card and said,””Look, this Jade is big and round. The color, type, and water quality of the Jade itself are all good. It’s the top glass type of King’s Green, with high density, fine crystals, and good transparency.”

Zhao Yongjun paused, then said,””Generally speaking, jadeite that is too thick will inevitably lose its color and charm, losing that spiritual Qi. However, this large square card was an exception, winning with its thickness and purity. Its shape was simple, thick but not clumsy, it contained a rich and luxurious feeling. The color is bright, mellow and not stagnant, and there is a trace of charm in the atmosphere. ”

Zhao Yongjun looked like he had just seen a beautiful woman. He carefully picked up the king’s Green square card that hadn’t been put back into the Golden base and turned on the bright flashlight.

He held the flashlight close to the square card and said,””Look, such a thick piece of Jade, but it has such good light transmission! The green inside was extremely rich, and it was not rigid at all. It was a kind of fresh green! It’s definitely the best of the best!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,”brother Zhao, you’ve already made a detailed assessment. I want to know how much this Emperor’s Green square plate can be sold for.”
