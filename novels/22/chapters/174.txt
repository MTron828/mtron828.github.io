Chapter 175: Top – tier food (1)

Xia ruofei arrived at the restaurant on the top floor ten minutes earlier than the agreed time. To his surprise, Monica had arrived earlier than him. She was standing on the huge balcony of the restaurant, looking at the river view. Monica was wearing an elegant and fashionable suit jacket. The top had a ruffled design, and with a belt, it perfectly highlighted her small waist. With black wide – legged pants and stiletto heels, she had a fashionable workplace style. “I’m sorry ... I think I’m late. ” Xia ruofei said. When she heard Xia ruofei’s voice, Monica turned around. She took off her sunglasses and smiled.”Xia, I should be the one who arrived early. I just like the beautiful scenery on the top floor, so ... Uh – huh!” Monica shrugged her shoulders. Xia ruofei smiled.”It just so happens that the seat I reserved is on this balcony. It has a 360 – degree river view with no dead angle!” “That’s great!” Monica said happily. At this moment, the restaurant waiter walked over and politely led the two to the table that Xia ruofei had reserved. Xia ruofei pulled out a chair for Monica. “Thank you!” Monica smiled and sat down. After Xia ruofei sat down across the table, the waiter brought the menu over. Xia ruofei gestured to the waiter and said,””Ladies First!” “Very gentlemanly!” Monica chuckled. “Actually, I’m just an uncouth fellow.” Xia ruofei grinned.”I went online to read up on it just to have lunch with you!” Monica, who was looking down at the menu, suddenly laughed. Actually, Xia ruofei was not joking. He really did not know much about Western food etiquette. He was just an uncouth retired soldier. Before he joined the Army, his family was also ordinary. He had no chance to come into contact with such knowledge. The two of them ordered the dishes very quickly, and the dishes were served in a short while. Appetizer, appetizer, soup, appetizer ... They were served one by one. Xia ruofei and Monica chatted in a low voice while enjoying the delicious French food on the balcony. At this moment, the restaurant’s chef, Mark Lawrence, came to the two of them with two main dishes. Lawrence said enthusiastically,”Ms. Grasso, Mr. Xia, welcome to the top – Floor restaurant of Jiahua.” The main course is the Rosini steak that I personally cooked. Please have a taste!” At the auction last night, MA Xiong had won two huge pieces of white truffle. The one he won from the Grao family’s auction was reserved for the top – Floor restaurant. Therefore, Lawrence was quite enthusiastic when he saw Xia ruofei and Monica. “To be able to taste a Michelin star chef’s cooking, my trip today was really worth it!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Thank you, Mr. Lawrence!” Monica also smiled. Rosiny steak was a famous dish in French and Western cuisine. Xia ruofei saw a slice of foie gras on top of the well – fried beef tenderloin. After it was paired with the black fungus juice, the fragrance assailed his nose. Just the smell of it made him hungry. “The main ingredients of this dish are the best fillet steak and the most authentic Strasburg foie gras,” said Mark Lawrence.”They’re cooked with black fungus juice. I’m going to complete the last step of the cooking process!” Then, Lawrence opened the lid of a sealed container on the food cart. Xia ruofei and Monica smelled a familiar fragrance. It was the White truffle that the Grao family had auctioned off last night. Lawrence picked up the White truffle and took it out of the pocket of his chef’s suit. After he put a few pieces of truffle on their plates, he said,””Please enjoy your meal!” Lawrence carefully put the White truffle back on the dining cart, covered it, and stood aside. Xia ruofei and Monica picked up their forks and knives and started to enjoy the main course. “It tastes very good! The steak is just right!” Said Monica with a smile. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was more focused on the foie gras. He said to Lawrence,””Mr. Lawrence, this foie gras is really delicious! The taste is extremely rich, smooth, and extremely delicious!” Lawrence said,”thank you for liking my cooking!” Mr. Xia, this foie gras is Strasburg foie gras that we air – shipped directly from France. More than two hundred years ago, our King, Louis XVI, tasted foie gras and exclaimed that it was the world’s top delicacy. Since then, foie gras has gradually become well – known to the world. And the dish that His Majesty Louis XVI was tasting was Strasburg foie gras!” “So there’s such a story behind it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this foie gras must be very precious, right?” Monica smiled and continued the conversation.”Authentic France foie gras is quite precious. It’s one of the three top delicacies along with the truffle and caviar that were auctioned yesterday. Strassburg foie gras is the top dish for French foie gras, followed by lande foie gras and Toulouse foie gras. Among the caviar, the most precious is the caviar made from the eggs of Beluga sturgeons. This is also the rarest caviar in the world. Less than 100 Beluga sturgeons are caught every year, and its caviar is extremely precious. They’re known as the Pearl of the Caspian Sea ...” Speaking of delicacies, Monica was also very familiar with them. It had indeed opened Xia ruofei’s eyes and allowed him to have a very direct understanding of the world’s top food. After tasting the best Strasburg foie gras, Xia ruofei also had the idea of exploring new ingredients. After all, among the three most delicious foods in the world, he could basically produce top – grade truffles every year. As for caviar, Sturgeon grew in the sea and the current environment in the realm was obviously not suitable for raising it, so foie gras was the most likely choice for the time being. Of course, Xia ruofei only had a preliminary idea. He did not know the breeding process of foie gras in France. Foie gras was not like truffle, which was expensive because it required a large number of geese. This meant that Xia ruofei had to find a way to raise them in the outside world. If not, even if he were to die of exhaustion, he would not be able to complete such heavy work, let alone the problem of whether the space could accommodate them. Therefore, he still needed to explore step by step to realize this initial idea. Chef Lawrence’s cooking skills had been acknowledged by the distinguished guests and he went down happily. Xia ruofei also put aside his thoughts and started chatting with Monica. Monica smiled and said,”Xia, I’ve carefully looked at the White truffle we bid for yesterday. The quality is even higher than the top white truffles produced in the Alba area. So, I really want to know, where did the Paradise Corporation find those top – Quality truffles?” Before Xia ruofei could react, Monica immediately smiled and said,””But I know that this must be your company’s core trade secret, so please don’t worry, I won’t ask around ...” “Thank you for understanding!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “But I still hope that we can have some business cooperation!” Monica said.
