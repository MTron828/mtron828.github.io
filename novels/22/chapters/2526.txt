2527 A world – shaking kick (2)

This time, Mark Rocca was well prepared. After the football was kicked out, whether it was the initial speed or angle, it was very good.

The football quickly bypassed the human wall and spun in the direction of the goal.

The speed of the ball was very fast. In the blink of an eye, the ball had arrived in front of the goal and was about to fly into the goal from the dead angle in the upper right corner of the goal.

However, everyone heard a “bang” as the football slammed heavily into the angle between the crossbar and the pillar, and then bounced out.

Everyone could not help but let out a huge sigh in unison.

Mark Rocca’s kick was almost perfect, but his luck was a little bad. The ball did not go in.

He was also very depressed. He felt that the ball should have been there as soon as he kicked it, but it was just a little short. It was estimated to be an error of one or two centimeters. Otherwise, it would have been an absolute dead end.

Markelka held his head in regret and sighed. He then nodded at Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, it’s your turn!”

A staff member had already brought another football over. Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He casually placed the football in the position where markelka had served.

Then, Xia ruofei looked up at the goal and took a few steps back. Without any preparation, he strode forward and kicked the ball in the middle.

The ball flew up with a whoosh and quickly exceeded the height of the human wall.

After crossing the human wall, the football was still rising rapidly. Looking at the movement, it was definitely an anti – aircraft shot. By the time it reached the goal, it would definitely be high in the sky.

Just as everyone was sighing in secret and markelka was rejoicing in his heart, the football had already reached the highest point. Immediately after, its trajectory seemed to go against the law of a parabola, and it suddenly dropped rapidly.

In the blink of an eye, the football whizzed into the net from the bottom of the crossbar.

The training ground was silent for a long time before a burst of applause broke out.

“This is the ‘elevator ball’!” An assistant manager couldn’t help but reveal an extremely surprised expression as he muttered.

The manager, Ruby, looked at the field and nodded.””Yes, and his mastery of the footwork is quite accurate!”

Ruby looked at the calm Xia ruofei with a complicated expression. If Xia ruofei’s kick was not a fluke, then his talent was too scary. However, such a talented person was not a professional player. This was a waste of God’s gift!

Xia ruofei’s free – kick shocked mark Rocca. He took a while to come back to his senses and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, good footwork!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said to Jiang Xiaochen,””Xiaochen, tell him it’s his turn to kick.”

After listening to Jiang Xiaochen’s translation, mark Roca nodded and picked up a football to go to the penalty spot.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei’s amazing performance did not make him discouraged. Instead, it aroused his fighting spirit.

This time, Mark Rocca no longer pursued extreme speed and angle. He steadily sent the ball into the goal with one kick.

However, the speed of the ball was much slower than Xia ruofei’s earlier kick and the arc was average. If it were an actual match, the goalkeeper would probably have missed the ball.

Markelka’s face was a little hot, and he felt like he was cheating. Xia ruofei didn’t care at all. He smiled and clapped at him, then walked to the penalty shot.

Just like before, Xia ruofei did not prepare carefully. He just casually placed the ball with his foot, took a few steps back, and then strode forward to kick again.

With a whoosh, the football went into the net.

This ball was the same as the previous one. It was extremely fast and had a strange arc. Even the position where it flew into the goal was similar to the previous one.

2 to 1. Xia ruofei was still in the lead.

The competition continued.

The two of them took turns to make free throws. In a short while, both of them had made nine shots. Under the pressure, mark Rocca did well and scored a total of six shots. Although the speed and arc of the ball were barely satisfactory, considering the distance and the difficulty of the human wall placement, the result was quite good.

However, compared to Xia ruofei’s results, the six free throws were not worth mentioning. The first nine shots were all sent into the net by Xia ruofei in the same way, in the same position. It was like a computer’s copy and paste, with almost no mistakes.

9 – 6, the result was already decided. No matter what the result of the last free throw was, markroka had already lost the match.

However, he didn’t give up on the last free throw just because he was going to lose.

This time, Mark Rocca also went all out. After putting down all the psychological burdens, he played beyond his level and kicked the ball into the goal with a beautiful arc.

Out of his 10 free kicks, this one was the most beautiful.

After the penalty, markelka could not help but raise his arms and cheer for himself.

Xia ruofei smiled and clapped at markelka.””Good play!”

Markelka said guiltily,””Compared to Mr. Xia’s footwork, I’m still far from it …”

“No, no, no. In my opinion, you’re already very good!” Xia ruofei said.

He was not just trying to comfort mark Rocca. After all, the player was still very young. It was already very rare for him to be able to play such a beautiful free kick.

Xia ruofei placed the ball on the penalty spot and started to retreat.

Everyone was even somewhat immune to Xia ruofei’s beautiful elevator ball. Although Xia ruofei’s field goal percentage was a frightening 100% and each of his shots interpreted the art of football very well, the first nine shots were almost exactly the same. No matter how beautiful the goal was, anyone who watched it nine times in a row would feel aesthetic fatigue.

However, everyone soon realized that Xia ruofei had retreated a little too far this time.

During the first few free throws, Xia ruofei only took three to five steps back, then he ran up and made the free throw in one go.

But now, Xia ruofei had already retreated seven or eight steps. The distance of the run – up was obviously longer than before.

Xia ruofei took a total of nine steps back. He looked at the goal again, took a deep breath, and started running with small steps.

Xia ruofei’s speed was getting faster and faster, and his steps were getting bigger and bigger. By the time he reached the back of the ball, his speed had already increased. When he took his last step, his right leg had already started to swing backward.

After a large swing of his leg, Xia ruofei’s body tilted slightly. His right leg was like a whip, heavily hitting the middle part of the football.

The football whizzed out like a heavy cannon and went around the right side of the human wall. After avoiding the human wall, the football crossed a very large arc and deviated to the left side of the goal.

However, in the process of flying, the football changed direction again. It made another huge arc and just flew past the goalkeeper’s dummy, directly drilling into the upper right corner of the goal.

If one were to stand directly facing the goal, one would be able to see that the football had crossed a very exaggerated “S” shaped arc and finally entered the goal.

If this was a real match, the goalkeeper’s center of gravity would have been shaken, and there would only be one result, which was to watch the football enter the net.

After the penalty kick, the whole court was silent. Even Wu Lei, who had blind trust in Xia ruofei, could not help but open his mouth in surprise.

…

A scene appeared in everyone’s mind. It was the short and strong Robert Carlos, who was wearing a yellow jersey, after a super – long run – up, and the violent free kick.

Xia ruofei’s free kick was a perfect copy of Robert Carlos’s S – shaped free kick.

It took a while for everyone to come back to their senses. They broke out in applause and praises, and some players couldn’t help but whistle.

Mabroka was dumbfounded. After a while, he laughed bitterly and said,””Mr. Xia, I admit my defeat!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”since I’ve won, don’t forget your promise!” I’ll be there to watch the next round of the competition!”

“I will do my best to fulfill my promise!” Said markelka seriously.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”alright, I’ve wasted so much of everyone’s time. You guys can continue with your training!” Wasn’t there still an internal match? I’ll be your cheerleader!”
