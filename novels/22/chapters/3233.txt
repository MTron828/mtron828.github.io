Elon Musk and gramus led Xia ruofei and Li Yifu to the huge living room on the first floor of the main building of the mansion.

“Mr. Li, Dr. Xia, tea or coffee?” asked Elon Musk.

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and smiled.””Mr. Masker, you have tea here too?”

“It’s a gift from a Chinese friend not long ago,” said Elon Musk with a smile.”Although the two of us are not used to the taste of Chinese tea, the tea leaves this time seem to be especially fragrant. We would occasionally drink some.”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then let’s try this tea!”

“No problem!” Elon Musk smiled and nodded, then gestured to the Butler standing at the side.

The Butler bowed slightly and walked to the side to prepare tea for everyone.

The tea cabinet was at a corner of the living room. Although the living room was huge and was a little far away, Xia ruofei and Li Yifu could tell at a glance that the tea the Butler took out from the tea cabinet was the Taoyuan Da Hong Pao. From the packaging, it was the most expensive kind.

The two of them couldn’t help but smile at each other.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, there was an exquisite kungfu tea set beside the tea cabinet. It was probably from the friend of Elon Musk who had given him the tea.

The Butler’s movements were a little awkward. What made Xia ruofei and Li Yifu both laugh and cry was that the Butler basically used the complicated tea set as a filtering tool. In the end, the tea that was brewed was actually in the coffee cups, filling everyone’s cups.

This cup of tea, if it was a normal tea tasting cup, could hold at least ten or twenty cups.

No wonder the Butler took so long to make the tea. After all, the tea made by this kind of Kung Fu Tea set was only enough to fill four to five tea cups.

The Butler placed four large coffee cups filled with steaming hot tea on a tray and placed them in front of Xia ruofei and the others.

Elonmask smiled and said,””Mr. Li, doctor Xia, please have a taste!”

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei’s expression was a little strange. He picked up the heavy coffee cup uncomfortably and took a sip.

Although the tea brewing technique was extremely bad, the peach blossom Da Hong Pao still had a strong fragrance, and the taste was not bad.

Of course, he could only get an evaluation of “not bad.” It was impossible to get any higher.

Every time a good tea leaves were brewed, there would be subtle differences in the taste and sweetness of the tea. People who often drank tea would be able to feel the subtle changes with a slight taste.

There were several cups of tea mixed together in the cup, so the taste had naturally become a little strange.

Elonmask also took a bite, and even showed an expression of savoring the aftertaste, and asked,””Doctor Xia, how’s the tea?”

“Not bad,” Xia ruofei said tactfully.

He couldn’t possibly say that the tea was impeccable, but the tea – brewing technique was terrible, wasting such expensive tea leaves ...

However, Xia ruofei still felt that his peach blossom Da Hong Pao was not worth it, so he couldn’t help but say,””Mr. Masker, in China, there are many things to pay attention to when making tea. Your tea set is pretty good, but there seems to be some problems with the way you use it ... Of course, this is not important! If there’s a chance, I can demonstrate the correct way to brew the Da Hong Pao tea leaves! As for now ... Let’s talk about the illness first!”

Elonmask quickly nodded and said,””Alright! Little X had been diagnosed three days ago, and he had done a comprehensive examination in the past three days. Dr. Xia, I’ll get someone to bring the examination report over, and then bring Dr. Mannu’s Medical Group over. How about you guys have an exchange first?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’d rather see the patient first!” “Mr. Masker, I’ve told you just now that Chinese medicine focuses on looking, listening, asking, and feeling. It’s very important to make a face – to – Face diagnosis for the patient. In comparison, we don’t rely as much on medical reports as Western medicine. ”

Elon Musk and gramus looked at each other. They both thought of Xia ruofei’s magical Chinese medicine “Wang” formula just now outside. She could accurately judge the disease of the other party with a glance. This was even more powerful than CT and MRI scans!

Since they were willing to give it a try and agreed to Xia ruofei’s visit, they naturally would not reject Xia ruofei’s normal request to diagnose in person.

Therefore, elonmask quickly nodded and said,””No problem! However, I’ll have to trouble doctor Xia to move him to the third floor. Little X is receiving preoperative treatment and can’t leave his room. ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Of course!” Xia ruofei picked up his coffee cup and took a big gulp of tea. He stood up and said,”let’s go see the patient now!”

“Good! Please follow me!” Elon Musk also stood up. He looked at Li Yifu, hesitated, and said,”Mr. Li, how about ... You take a rest here?”

Li Yifu had already stood up with Xia ruofei. He said,””I’ll join you! Uh ... Is it convenient?”

His martial granduncle had gone to see someone’s illness, so how could he, as his Grand – disciple, sit here and drink tea with a coffee cup? Even if he couldn’t help, he had to correct his attitude!

Elon Musk felt a little strange, but he immediately said,””Of course! This way, please!”

Elon Musk and grams took Xia ruofei and Li Yifu directly through the indoor elevator and arrived on the third floor.
