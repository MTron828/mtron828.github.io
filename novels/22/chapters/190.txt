Xia ruofei’s spirit was lifted. He tried to concentrate and endure the fatigue to continue the investigation. He sensed that a golden light seemed to be shining out of the endless fog, as bright as the stars in the dark night. Although it was only a tiny bit, it seemed to contain endless truth. Xia ruofei had felt this way before. When he had first obtained the spirit map space and was carefully observing the nameless plant, he had also had a vague feeling as if he had seen the truth of heaven and earth. However, Xia ruofei felt that this golden light was many times stronger than the nameless plant. Xia ruofei tried his best to “see” more clearly through the fog, but his spiritual energy was exhausted. Soon, he opened his eyes tiredly and sighed before moving his hand away. Xia ruofei did not realize that the moment he opened his eyes, there was a golden light in his eyes. His gaze seemed to contain countless truths. The golden light flashed and disappeared, and his eyes quickly returned to normal. The whole process happened in an instant. Even if someone was standing right in front of Xia ruofei, he might not be able to detect it. Xia ruofei’s temperament had also changed subtly. Xia ruofei had made some progress in the investigation of the stone tablet, but strictly speaking, he had returned with nothing. He knew that the main reason was that his spiritual connection with the spirit map space was not close enough. In addition, his own spiritual power was also insufficient. This could only be improved step by step through constantly evolving the space and absorbing the petals of the strange flower. For a moment, he even wanted to swallow the spirit fruit to improve his mental power and his spiritual connection with the space. This was because he had caught a glimpse of the stone tablet’s Secret, and it made his heart itch. Xia ruofei believed that the spiritual fruit would definitely work. But in the end, he suppressed this impulse. That spiritual fruit was very precious, and if he rashly consumed it, it might be a waste of a heavenly treasure. Who knew when it would have a great effect in the future! Even if he wanted to take one to test its effects, he would have to wait until he had harvested more spirit fruits. After inspecting the two spaces, Xia ruofei started to think about the problem of the original space. In the end, he came to a conclusion: When a new dimension appeared, the original dimension might have already evolved to its final form. Even if he continued to upgrade the evolution space, he could only increase the density of the spiritual energy in the space. The area of space and the flow of time had already reached the limit of the original space. Xia ruofei put himself in the shoes of the person who had created the spirit painting and felt that it was not difficult to understand. The original space had different time laws, so the difficulty of supporting its normal operation was definitely higher than the new space. The space’s range was naturally limited. Furthermore, there were already eight acres of the area where time flowed at thirty times the normal speed. There was no point in increasing it any further. Hence, Xia ruofei made a bold deduction that the evolution of the original space would stop here and the new space would continue to expand in the future as it evolved. It could even form mountains, rivers, lakes, and even the sea. The small mountain he saw today had obviously grown a lot taller and the small stream had widened. These were all very obvious clues. Xia ruofei turned around and looked at the stone tablet. He was a little unwilling, but there was no other way. He could only wait until the evolution was complete before he tried. One day, I’ll be able to unravel all the secrets contained in the stone tablet! Xia ruofei said in his heart. Xia ruofei played with Blackie and the rest for a while and added some dog food to their plates. Then, he left the new space and returned to the original space. He tidied up the remaining truffles from last time. These truffles were not big, and the big ones were all picked out by Xia ruofei and auctioned off. However, there were indeed quite a lot of them. Of course, it was only relative. The truffles produced in the spirit map space, even the leftovers, were much bigger than the ordinary truffles outside. The two large sorting boxes here were full, and the other large sorting box was almost half – filled. The smallest white truffle in the box was more than 200 grams, and the average was 300 to 400 grams. The black truffle could also reach a weight of two to three hundred grams. Xia ruofei used the scale to measure. There was a total of 18 kilograms of white truffle and 12 kilograms of black truffle. He put the truffles back into the box and left the spirit map space. Although Xia ruofei was in a hurry to upgrade, he did not have much spare money. He had just earned 14 million Yuan and had not even had the time to buy it, but he had already spent 10 million Yuan. In a few days, he would have to spend another 2.2 million Yuan to buy a house and transfer it to another account. This was not including all kinds of taxes and handling fees. The remaining money, together with some money he had saved up before, was only about 2 million Yuan, less than 3 million Yuan. Therefore, he couldn’t buy more Jade for the time being. After all, now that he had started a company, he had all kinds of expenses every day, so he had to keep a portion of the funds in hand. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had been thinking about building the staff dormitory. There were only a dozen workers now, and Cao tieshu and the rest were from the nearby villages. This was not a big problem. In the future, when they had more manpower, dormitories would definitely be indispensable. Moreover, ye Lingyun had mentioned to him twice that he wanted to build a dormitory. He wanted to move an entire set of surveillance systems over and move himself over to be in charge of security. After all, this villa was Xia ruofei’s private residence. It was only a temporary measure to stay here for now, and it would be inconvenient for him in the long run. Therefore, he could not use a single cent of the money. Fortunately, he had always been making money very quickly. The vegetables and succulent plants could bring him hundreds of thousands of Yuan of income every month. After a month, the supply would increase, and with the addition of Hengfeng group as a new partner, the number would still increase significantly. Therefore, for the time being, the evolution of the space could only be put on hold. …… The next morning, Xia ruofei received a call from Hengfeng group’s San Shan office’s manager Zhong. He asked Xia ruofei very politely about the truffle. Xia ruofei said that the truffles would be delivered soon and asked him to pick them up at the farm in the afternoon. After lunch, Xia ruofei left the farm in his car. After more than half an hour, when he drove back, there were three large tidying boxes in the pickup truck. Naturally, Xia ruofei’s trip out this time was to deceive people and create the illusion that he had brought these things back from outside. Now that Hu Zi’s mother, Lin Qiao, and ye Lingyun were all living together, it was indeed a little inconvenient. As soon as Xia ruofei got out of the car, ye Lingyun came out to greet him. He saw the large tidied box in the trunk and asked curiously,””Brother Xia, What’s this?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”good stuff!” Ling Yun, help me move my things to the garage first. Someone will come to pick them up in a while. Be careful! This thing is too expensive ...” “Alright, don’t worry!” Ye linyun agreed. Xia ruofei walked into the villa and was about to pour himself a glass of water when he received a call from manager Zhong, informing him that the car had arrived at the entrance of the farm. Xia ruofei called ye Lingyun out again and asked him to bring the man in. After a while, a small refrigerator Van arrived at the entrance of the villa. Manager Zhong greeted Xia ruofei very politely after he got out of the car. Xia ruofei had dealt with him before. The last time MA Xiong and the others came to San Shan city, this manager Zhong had accompanied them the entire time, so they could be considered acquaintances. The two of them exchanged a few pleasantries before heading to the garage to trade truffles. Ye Lingyun and Lin Qiao followed them with curiosity. When they arrived at the garage, Xia ruofei opened the tidying boxes that ye Lingyun had just moved in. “Manager Zhong, let’s take a look at the goods first!” He said with a smile. “Okay, thank you, Mr. Xia!” Manager Zhong said very politely. Then, he stepped forward and put his hand into the rice in the box. He quickly picked up a piece of white truffle. Manager Zhong showed a surprised expression and looked at it carefully for a long time before putting it down. He then took out a few more pieces, and his expression changed slightly as he said,””I’m sorry, Mr. Xia, I need to make a phone call first!” “Please ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile. After manager Zhong apologized, he took his phone and went to the yard to make a call. Xia ruofei was also confused, not knowing what had happened. He muttered in his heart, could there be a problem with the quality of this batch of truffles? It can’t be ...
