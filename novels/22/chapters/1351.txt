Chapter 1352: Two main dishes (2)

Translator: 549690339

Of course, with song Rui’s example, they were very careful when they ate. They would blow on the ingredients they picked up before putting them into their mouths.

Their actions at the beginning were still quite elegant, but when the food entered their mouths, Xu Zi Xuan, who was the most concerned about maintaining his demeanor, also became a little unsettled. He couldn’t help but speed up the pace of chewing. Obviously, no one was snatching it from them, but they just couldn’t wait to eat it in big mouthfuls.

Zhao Yongjun was the same. After eating the abalone, chicken, and pork trotter, he picked up the spoon and took a sip of the soup. After drinking it, he felt the rich fragrance in his mouth and couldn’t help but exclaim loudly.

The Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup had so many types of ingredients, and it was processed so meticulously. In the end, it had been stewed for a long time with the fire. Therefore, the essence of the ingredients had been integrated into the soup, and the taste of the soup was the best.

Therefore, everyone immediately changed to drinking the soup. For a time, the sound of slurping could be heard in the private room. Everyone stopped talking and focused on dealing with the small jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ in front of them.

If it was the top rich people in the capital who saw Zhao Yongjun and the others eating without care for their manners, they would definitely be shocked.

Look at how inexperienced they are!

However, if they had tasted the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ personally, they would probably not be any better than Zhao Yongjun and the others.

In a short while, everyone had basically finished the small jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’.

Song Rui, who ate the fastest, even picked up the small jar and drank the rest of the soup.

Xia ruofei put down his chopsticks before he finished eating. He picked up a towel and wiped his mouth. Then, he smiled and asked,””How is it? This dish can be considered to have caught everyone’s eyes!”

“It’s more than that!” Hou Liang said,”I’ve eaten ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ before, and it was even made in a five – Star hotel. Only now do I know that compared to the one in sister-in-law’s shop, they’re not worthy of being called ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’! It’s more like a ghost hitting the wall!”

“This taste is really good!” Zhao Yongjun also gave him a thumbs up.

Xu Zi Xuan asked curiously,”brother Xia, you just said ...... You personally improved this” Buddha Jumps Over the Wall “?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Ling Qingxue said,”ruofei’s improved cooking method is a little different from the traditional ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. The taste is also much better than the traditional ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. Furthermore, he added some Chinese medicinal herbs into it. It’s also very good for health ...”

“What?” Liu Jian couldn’t help but exclaim,”there are medicinal herbs in it? Why can’t I smell any medicine?”

Xia ruofei used his chopsticks to pick out the Chinese medicine packet and said with a smile,””There! There should be some in everyone’s jars with Chinese medicine added. As for why there’s no smell of medicine ... Well, this is more advanced technology, so I won’t explain it in detail ...”

“Hahaha ...”

Everyone couldn’t help but laugh. Liu Jian joined in and said,”Brother Xia, you’ve already prepared such a high – tech dish for the first dish. Wouldn’t the next dish be filled with alien civilization?”

Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,””There’s no alien civilization, but it’s definitely not worse than this Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. And this is a new dish, so in the future, Ling’s private kitchen will have two signature dishes!”

Song Wei could not help but be interested.

She had eaten ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ before. Even though she was still impressed by the deliciousness, she was not as surprised as Zhao Yongjun and the others. The new dish that Xia ruofei mentioned made her look forward to it even more.

“Then what are we waiting for? Hurry up and do it!” The foodie song Rui was even more eager.

“What’s the hurry?” Xia ruofei said calmly,”this dish was a little greasy. Let’s eat something light first and then drink some wine. Good food should be done step by step! Otherwise, no matter how delicious the food is, it will not achieve the desired effect. ”

“Alright, you’re keeping us in suspense,” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile. Alright! We guests do as the host does, so I’ll give my respect to ruofei first!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei raised his glass and said,”brother Zhao, let’s drink!”

“Cheers!”

The two of them clinked their glasses on the table and drank the white wine in their glasses.

“Good wine!” Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but praise.

His personality was similar to his father, general Zhao Cheng, and he had grown up in the military. He had no resistance to a top – grade liquor like Drunken Eight Immortals.

After finishing a glass, Zhao Yongjun immediately poured another glass and took the initiative to drink with song Rui.

Song Wei also picked up her glass of half – Lon. She smiled and said,””RUO Fei, Qingxue, let me give you a toast!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei laughed as he poured himself more wine.”Oh right, I need your help with something!”

He was thinking about the ancient tomb that Song Wei had excavated previously. It was highly possible that there would be a world stone there. He had wanted to mention it to Song Wei a few times before, but he had been busy and had delayed it until now.

“Oh?” Song Wei said,”tell me! No matter what it is, I will do my best to help!”

Xia ruofei was Song Wei’s Savior. Song Wei had always been grateful to Xia ruofei. She even had some feelings for Xia ruofei, but she had always hidden them well in front of Ling Qingxue.

“I’ll talk to you about this in private after we come down!”Xia ruofei said after some thought.

Song Wei felt a little embarrassed. At the same time, she quickly glanced at Ling Qingxue guiltily. After seeing that Ling Qingxue’s expression was normal, she let out a sigh of relief and said,”Alright then, give me a call when the time comes!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”okay!” Come, come, come, let’s drink!”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue clinked their glasses with Song Wei, and everyone toasted.

After a while, the steamed kun fish was finally served.

The Three Waiters each carried a plate and walked into the room.

Xia ruofei looked at him and smiled.””The new dish is here! Comrades, prepare your praises!”

Zhao Yongjun and the others who were drinking and chatting immediately turned to look.

Song Rui looked at it and said in disappointment,””So the main dish you were talking about was fish! And these fish aren’t that big ... Even though there are three of them, it’s not that many!”

Xia ruofei smiled mischievously and said,””It seems that young master Song doesn’t like this steamed fish! How about this ... You let me have your portion?”

“No way!” Song Rui immediately said warily.

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”it seems like song Rui isn’t stupid!” For RUO Fei to seriously introduce it to everyone, it was definitely not an ordinary fish! RUO Fei, I didn’t guess wrong, right?”

“Big brother Zhao, you have sharp eyes!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Because he was worried that it wouldn’t be enough, Xia ruofei brought three beluga at once and asked Su Yu to steam them all.

The waiter placed the steamed kun fish on the table, and everyone’s attention was naturally focused on the three fish.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked the waiter to divide the three fish, trying to give everyone the same amount.

Thus, the three plates of fish that had been served for a while were brought to the side by the waiter. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The waiter quickly divided the three steamed beluga into ten portions and placed them on small plates. Then, he distributed one portion to everyone.

“Try it!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Rui picked up his chopsticks and fiddled with them. He said with some disdain,””RUO Fei, why haven’t you removed the scales? Your chefs must be slacking off!”

After he finished speaking, he was about to pick up the fish scale and throw it away.

Xia ruofei quickly shouted,”Hey!” That’s the most delicious part, don’t mess around if you don’t understand!”

“What? Eat fish scales?” Song Rui was dumbfounded.

“Look at your ignorant face!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he picked up a piece of fish with fish scales and put it in his mouth. He chewed it a few times, feeling the fresh and tender beluga meat and jelly – like fish scales exuding a delicious taste. He closed his eyes and revealed a trace of enjoyment.
