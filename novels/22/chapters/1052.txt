Chapter 1053: An incomparably successful warm – up (1)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Rao was a very attractive beauty, and everyone who came here was very interested in the top – Quality one – headed abalone, so everyone applauded her.

The rich people sitting in the VIP area also smiled and clapped gently.

With a charming smile on her face, Feng Rao continued,”Before the auction officially begins, we’ve also arranged a small segment. I believe everyone will like it!”

After speaking, Feng Jing turned to the side and gestured.

Two tall beauties in cheongsam each carried a transparent lucky draw box on the stage and showed it to the audience to confirm that the box was empty.

Feng Jing continued,”all our distinguished guests and media friends have received a ticket before entering the venue. Now, please tear off the secondary ticket. Our Lady will come and collect it.”

The reason why they used a transparent lottery box and did not collect the lottery ticket when they signed in was to show that there was no hidden operation during the whole process.

After Feng Rao finished speaking, the two female receptionists walked off the stage. One went to the media area, and the other to the guest area. They began to collect secondary vouchers.

Everyone didn’t know the purpose of the Paradise Corporation holding a lucky draw before the auction, but no matter what, they wouldn’t lose anything. They might even bring a surprise, so they were very cooperative.

There were about 30 people in the VIP area in the first few rows. They did not get any tickets, so the hostess did not go to the VIP area to collect them.

Very quickly, the two waitresses collected all the secondary vouchers and placed them on the table in the middle of the stage.

Feng Rao smiled and said,”in order to let all the guests and media friends have a more intuitive understanding of the top – grade abalones provided by our paradise Corporation, we will draw 30 lucky people for the next segment. Together with the 30 guests in the VIP area, they will personally taste our paradise brand’s top – grade dry abalones!” Next, let’s invite the chairman of Hengfeng group, Mr. MA Xiong, to the stage to pick the lucky guest!”

The audience couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed when they heard that the prize was only tasting the abalone.

Generally speaking, before the start of an auction, there would be a public display time. Under the condition of ensuring safety, those interested in competing and media reporters would be allowed to come into close contact with the auction item.

They didn’t expect that this unknown paradise Corporation would actually use such a normal segment as a reward. Could it be that those who didn’t get it didn’t even have the chance to see the abalones up close? You don’t even let people see it and you want people to spend money to bid for it? How could there be such a good thing?

They couldn’t help but curl their lips when they saw Feng Rao asking the highly respected MA Xiong to draw the lucky guests.

Some of the rich people and some of the media in Hong Kong looked down on the mainland. Many people were waiting to see the small domestic company that had recently attracted a lot of attention.

MA Xiong was the main reason why so many people and media outlets were present at the auction this time.

It was obvious that Feng Rao had informed MA Xiong about this beforehand, so MA Xiong immediately stood up with a smile and bowed slightly to the VIP area. Then, he walked up to the stage. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Chairman MA, please draw 15 vouchers from each of the two lottery boxes!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

“Alright!” MA Xiong said with a bright smile.

Then, he walked directly to one of the waitresses. The lucky draw box in the hostess ‘hand was filled with the guest’s lottery tickets.

MA Xiong reached his hand into the lottery box, stirred it, and drew the first ticket.

He gave it to Feng Jing after a quick glance.

Feng Rao showed the ticket to the camera, and the camera immediately captured the number on the ticket. Everyone could see it clearly on the big screen.

“Congratulations to the guest with lottery ticket number 0213! You’re the first lucky person!” Feng Jing said with a smile.

The people in the audience also clapped in cooperation, but the applause wasn’t very enthusiastic. It was obvious that many people didn’t care about the opportunity to “taste” the top – Quality abalone.

However, Feng Rao didn’t mind and continued to host the event with a confident smile.

Soon, MA Xiong had drawn 30 vouchers, 15 for the guests and 15 for the media.

The big screen on the side of the stage was connected to the computer, and all thirty numbers were displayed on the screen, so everyone could see them at a glance.

“Thank you, Chairman MA. Please go back to your seat and rest!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

MA Xiong smiled and nodded. He walked down the stage and returned to his seat. The two female assistants also walked down from the sides of the stage.

Feng Rao waved to the people behind her.

Melodious music started playing, and a few people in white chef’s uniforms pushed a moving stove onto the stage.

There were two stainless steel steaming pots on the moving stove, and a chef wearing a tall chef’s hat was looking after the two steaming pots.

This chef was the head chef of Jiahua restaurant that MA Xiong had invited Xia ruofei to dinner last night. He was a Michelin star chef, Liu fuwang, and his specialty was cooking seafood.

While everyone was still confused, Xia ruofei moved and immediately looked at the vertical freezer at a striking position on the stage.
