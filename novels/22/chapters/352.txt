“Mm! Brother Xia, you still don’t know where our booth is, right? I’ll Take You There!” Jiang Yue said happily. The group of people tacitly ignored Chen Song and directly walked into the University. Peng Hui and you Jun were the last. After hesitating for a moment, they did not follow. They still stood beside Chen Song. Chen Song felt extremely humiliated after being ignored. His face turned pale and his lips trembled slightly. He was clearly furious. “Xia ruofei, stop!” Chen Song shouted. Chen song’s voice was very loud, and the commotion attracted the attention of some students. Everyone looked over. Xia ruofei frowned and stopped. He turned around and asked,””Do you have any advice? If you’re going to teach me how to grow orchids, then save it! Let me know when you’ve successfully cured Mo Lan of the withered leaf disease. ” Xia ruofei’s meaning was clear. When the mo Lan was infected with the dry leaf disease, Chen Song could not do anything about it. However, Xia ruofei only used three days to cure Mo Lan. From this point of view, Chen Song was considered to have lost to him. How could he be qualified to talk to Xia ruofei about the orchid? “Didn’t you hear what I just said?”Chen Song sneered. It seems that Your Excellency’s education is limited!” “Bah! Do I have to respond to you just because you’re talking to me?” Xia ruofei said mercilessly,”do you want to eat sh * t? do I have to make you some hot sh * t?” Xia ruofei’s words were very vulgar. Lu You, Jiang Yue, and the other girls from the gardening club could not help but frown. However, they really did hate Chen Song, so they quickly covered their mouths and laughed. Xia Cheng and the other guys laughed out loud. “Big brother Xia, you’re so disgusting ...” Jiang Yue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”don’t use vulgarities!” Xia ruofei showed an innocent expression and shrugged.””I’ve always been very civilized, but whenever I meet this student Chen, I can’t help but curse. Is this the legendary saying ‘one who is marked by the company of ink’?” Chen Song was so angry that his entire body was trembling. He had really never seen someone with such a vicious mouth. After a long while, Chen Song gritted his teeth and said,””You dare to do it but don’t dare to admit it? Just now, you said that you could defeat our yang suhe with that pot of mo orchid. Why did you run away after I questioned you? Are you feeling guilty?” Xia ruofei sneered,”you’re asking me and I have to answer you?” We were having a good chat. Did you come? In the end, you came up and said something so boastful, so why should we respond to you? Do you think that everyone in the world is your mother? Does everyone have to indulge in your bad habits?” Then, Xia ruofei said to Lu You and the rest,””Let’s go!” Xia ruofei had just turned around when Chen Song shouted from behind him,””Xia ruofei, what’s the point of arguing? Since you’re so confident in yourself, do you dare to bet with me on who will win the gold Prize?” Xia ruofei turned around and pouted.””Sure, I’ll bet a million!” “You ...” Chen Song was suddenly angry. How could he have a million? Even if he could, he couldn’t use it as a bet so rashly! One million was not a small amount. Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”if you don’t have money, why are you gambling?” Could it be that you want to use that pot of Hui LAN to bet with me? I’m not interested in that. ” Previously, Chen Song had brought a pot of pretty good Hui LAN to Sanshan University. He had wanted to take the opportunity to get close to Lu You, but he had not expected Xia ruofei to cure the Jade lion Mo Lan. He had been slapped in the face. Although the pot of Hui LAN was pretty good, it was still a few grades lower than the Jade lion Mo Lan. The expression on Chen song’s face kept changing. It seemed like he was having an intense mental struggle. Xia ruofei lost interest. He pouted and said,””Since you can’t even take out the bet, then there’s nothing more to say. Bye!” “Wait!” Chen Song shouted,”I’ll use this to bet with you!” Then, with red eyes, he took out a chain from his pocket. The chain was made of pure silver, and there was an object the size of a pigeon’s egg hanging on it. It looked like jade but was not Jade, like stone but was not stone. The object was completely black, like a black hole, and it emitted a faint cold air. Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed with surprise, but it quickly disappeared. He asked calmly,””You want to bet with me with just a silver necklace and a broken stone?” In fact, Xia ruofei was extremely excited. When Chen Song took out the silver necklace, his palm suddenly trembled ... It was the spirit painting scroll that started vibrating on its own. The last time it happened was at Lingyu house. That time, Xia ruofei found a black raw stone in a pile of low – Quality raw stones. It was this ordinary – looking black rough stone that Xia ruofei had given to the spirit map space to absorb. After absorbing the black rough stone, the spirit map space’s evolution suddenly sped up by a large amount. Xia ruofei vaguely knew that the ordinary – looking black “raw stone” might not have any Jade in it. It might be something that could help the space level up faster. Today was the second time that Xia ruofei felt the spirit painting vibrating on its own. He could also feel the spirit painting’s jubilant emotions. In fact, he had already made a judgment in his heart. Xia ruofei realized that the black stone in Chen song’s hand was probably better than the black rough stone he had found by accident. It was such a small stone, but it could make the spirit map scroll shake non – stop. The force was so strong that it felt like it was going to break through Xia ruofei’s palm. I must get this stone! Xia ruofei said in his heart. Fortunately, he had received special training. Although he was extremely excited, he did not show his emotions. On the contrary, Xia ruofei even pretended to be disdainful to prevent Chen Song from becoming suspicious. After all, Chen Song was just an inexperienced college student. How could he see the changes in Xia ruofei’s emotions? “This rock of mine is not a simple thing!” He quickly said. Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked,””Oh? Then tell me, what’s not simple about it?” Xia ruofei also said in his heart,””Does he really know the origin of this thing? That can’t be ... If he knew how precious this stone was, how could he use it as a bet?” “I got this stone by accident. Although I don’t know what it is, I’m sure it’s not simple!” Chen Song said. I’ve looked at it with a few experts, but they couldn’t determine the composition of this stone. I’ve also taken it for testing, and its hardness is actually the same as diamond!” Xia ruofei was relieved. It turned out that Chen Song did not know much. He had only judged that the stone was extraordinary through some other evidence. Xia ruofei pretended to be tempted and looked at the stone again. Then, he forced himself to say,””Alright then! I’ll bet with you ... But since you don’t even know what this is, I can’t bet a million with you ...” “If you lose, I want your jade lion!” Chen Song quickly said. He had already taken a fancy to this pot of jade lion when he went to Sanshan University last time. Although this pot of orchid was far inferior to the Yang – style Lotus that the University of Agriculture and Forestry had brought out to participate in the exhibition, it was definitely a very precious orchid species. Furthermore, yang suhe did not belong to Chen Song. In fact, the most precious orchid in his possession was that pot of Hui LAN. Now that he had the opportunity to obtain this pot of jade lion Mo Lan, he naturally could not wait to make such a request. Xia ruofei shook his head.”I can bet some money. But I can’t bet on this jade lion. It’s not mine.” At this moment, Lu You suddenly said,””Xia ruofei, bet with him!”
