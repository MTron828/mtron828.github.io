“MMM, it’s delicious!” Xia ruofei gave Ling Qingxue a thumbs – up and said,”Uncle SU’s food is indeed the most authentic!” Qingxue, try it!”

When everyone saw Xia ruofei’s slightly exaggerated expression, they couldn’t help but be interested in the plate of fish in front of them. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Only Zhao Yongjun’s eyes were not on the fish, but on Xia ruofei. He asked with uncertainty,””RUO Fei, this fish ... Could it be the legendary Chinese perch from the Yangtze River?”

Zhao Yongjun had seen a lot, at least he knew about the Yangtze River pomfrets. He had also tried the expensive artificial United States pomfrets on the market. The two kinds of pomfrets were close relatives and looked similar, so Zhao Yongjun felt a sense of familiarity when they were served.

Moreover, Xia ruofei had emphasized the deliciousness of the scales. Zhao Yongjun vaguely remembered that this was one of the special characteristics of the Chinese perch, so he couldn’t help but ask.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he gave her a thumbs up and laughed.”Brother Zhao is indeed knowledgeable! He’s not like some comrades who speak eloquently about food, but are actually just pure foodies ...”

Xia ruofei was the most familiar with song Rui, so he did not hold back when he mocked him. Anyway, they were so close that no matter how much he joked, they would not really turn hostile.

Song Rui was depressed, but Zhao Yongjun was shocked.

He asked in surprise,”is it really a Chinese perch?” I heard that this fish is almost extinct! You actually took three at once ... Good boy! Such a big move ...”

Zhao Yongjun immediately slapped his forehead and said,””Something’s wrong! No... You just said that this will be the new signature dish of sister-in-law’s store, which means that there will be no problem with the supply of ingredients ... Since when can the Yangtze River pomfrets be supplied in batches?”

Xia ruofei smiled. ” Brother Zhao, you’re indeed from the Army. You’re so meticulous! ”

” Don’t keep us in suspense ...” Zhao Yongjun said with a bitter smile. ” Tell us, what’s the situation? ”

As for Hou Liang, he was even more dumbfounded. He said, ” “Jun bro, don’t keep us in suspense. What’s this Chinese perch you guys are talking about? How come I’ve never heard of it? ”

Zhao Yongjun said, ” I don’t know much about it, but I know that this fish lives near the mouth of the Yangtze River. At a fixed time every year, it will go up along the river to lay eggs. That’s why it’s called pomfrets. ” It was said that the Chinese perch was very delicious and was once a tribute to the Imperial court. Not only did the Emperor like it, but many scholars and poets also liked it. It was also said that many famous poets and lyricists had made famous poems about the Chinese perch! However, in the past 20 to 30 years, due to over-harvesting and environmental damage, the Chinese perch has basically gone extinct ...”

Zhao Yongjun’s introduction stunned Hou Liang and the others. They didn’t think that three ordinary-looking fish would have such a huge background and be so precious ...

“RUO Fei, is this really a Chinese perch? ” Song Rui also became restless.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. ” Brothers, I won’t keep you in suspense. This is indeed a Chang Jiang Chinese perch, but it’s not as rare as brother Zhao said. This is because our paradise Corporation has already developed the technology to artificially breed Chang Jiang Chinese perch in an artificial environment. Today’s Chinese perch is the first batch of products on the market in our company’s Chang Jiang Chinese perch cultivation workshop. ”

“Artificial cultivation? ” Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but exclaim, ” how is this possible? The Chinese perch are known for their cowardice, and from what I know, there were government agencies that tried to breed them more than ten years ago. Of course, they did it to protect the species ... But they all failed. Reproduction is a big problem, and there’s no solution ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said, ” we’ve solved the technical problem. Although the production will not be particularly large in the future, we can basically guarantee a continuous supply of pure Yangtze River Pomfret. ” Our baby fish are also the most authentic Chang Jiang Kun fish, and their bloodline is quite pure!”

Zhao Yongjun gave him a thumbs up. “This is amazing ...”

“Everyone, don’t just listen to the story!” Xia ruofei smiled and said, ” the steamed beluga cools down quickly. If you don’t eat it now, it won’t taste as good! ”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, everyone picked up their chopsticks and reached for their plates expectantly. Even the elegant Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who had already tried the Chinese perch, were no exception.

For a moment, the private room became very quiet. Only the sound of everyone chewing could be heard.

Xia ruofei also calmly picked up the fresh and tender fish and put it into his mouth. He was not worried about the attraction of the Chinese perch. He believed that the famous ” three delicacies of Yangtze River ” would definitely catch the most picky glutton. Zhao Yongjun and the others would not be an exception.

Sure enough, everyone didn’t say anything because their mouths were too busy and they didn’t have time to talk.

When the Pomfret in front of them was finished, Zhao Yongjun and the others started to praise the pomfrets.

In particular, the jelly-like fish scales had won a lot of attention. They had never heard of fish scales being so delicious, even more delicious than fish meat.

Xu Zi Xuan couldn’t help but sigh: ” ruofei, after coming to the three mountains and tasting such delicacies, when we return to the capital, I’m afraid the so-called delicacies of those star hotels and high-end clubs will taste like chewing wax ..... ”
