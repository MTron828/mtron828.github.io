Chapter 473: The missing military dagger (3)

It was said that& the counterfeit buck; Strider 888 could be bought at will on the all – Purpose Taobao. Some foreign fans even bought the counterfeit for testing, with the intention of criticizing China’s fake and inferior products; however, the result was shocking; the counterfeit was actually of better quality than the original. In all kinds of destructive extreme tests, the counterfeit lasted until the end ...

Therefore, they didn’t think much of the military dagger.

Of course, even sun Hao could not be sure if Xia ruofei had really taken the dagger from under their eyes. After all, they had been discussing the case excitedly and had not been paying attention to Xia ruofei.

Just as Xia ruofei and Qin Xiaoyu were arguing, the ambulance finally arrived.

The police heaved a sigh of relief at the same time. Although it was interesting to watch the show, what if Captain Qin vented his anger on them after the incident? Captain Qin’s outburst was very terrifying ...

The oldest police officer, song Dajun, came forward and said,”Captain Qin, let’s send the suspect to the hospital first! A long night may bring more trouble ...”

Qin Xiao Yu naturally knew what was more important. She glared at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re lucky! I’ll let you off today, but I’ll definitely bring you to justice next time!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””It seems that officer Qin still doesn’t believe me! In order to prove my innocence, I think we should search him! You’d better search thoroughly ...” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After speaking, Xia ruofei made a gesture to take off his clothes.

Qin Xiao Yu screamed in fear, her face turned pale as she hurriedly turned around and walked out of the alley.

Xia ruofei shouted from behind her,””Officer Qin, I helped you catch an A – Class wanted criminal. There should be a reward, right? Don’t forget to let me know when you get it!”

Qin Xiao Yu was so angry that she wanted to turn around and beat Xia ruofei up but she held it in and walked out of the alley without looking back and got into the police car.

The policemen secretly gave Xia ruofei a thumbs – up and then directed the medical staff to carry Zhao he to the ambulance outside the alley on a stretcher.

Xia ruofei looked at the policemen leaving with the “spoils” and sighed.”You’ve done a good job, but my lead has been completely cut off ...

Before Xia ruofei could extort a confession from Zhao he, Qin Xiao Yu appeared with her men. Now that Zhao he was confirmed as the family murder suspect, he would definitely be closely guarded by the police. Naturally, Xia ruofei would not be able to find any clues from Zhao he about who was after him.

Xia ruofei shook his head helplessly and left the secluded alley. He got into his pickup truck and continued to drive to the Jade Market in the city.

He had already made up his mind that no matter who wanted to deal with him, unless the other party stopped, they would definitely give themselves away. For now, he would focus on his own matters and wait for the other party to come to his door.

From the fact that the other party had sent out a Desperado like Zhao he, and that Zhao he did not hide his killing intent at all, and had attacked him ruthlessly without saying a word, it could be seen that the other party had come with the purpose of crippling him or even taking his life.

Then, it would be a situation where they would fight to the death.

Xia ruofei clenched his teeth and muttered to himself,””I don’t care who you are, but once I find you, I’ll definitely kill you!”

Since he wanted someone’s life, he had to be prepared to be killed by others.
