Chapter 1679: I’ve become a WiFi (2)

“No, no, no!” Guan Ping quickly said. Of course there was something! That ... President Dong and President Xiao have discussed it. We need to add more fuel to the fire, so ... We need your cooperation ...”

“You guys have made a big deal out of it! How else do you want me to cooperate?” Xia ruofei asked.

Guan Ping laughed.”It’s actually very simple. We just want you to record a short video and send it back to us after you’re done. We’ll post the video on Weibo!”

“What? And you want me to record a video?” Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”no! You can go find whoever you want!”

“Don ‘t!” Guan Ping said,”ruofei, do you know how many fans you have now? It’s just that you don’t have a Weibo, otherwise, I’m afraid your backstage would be jammed! Our company’s official Weibo gained millions of followers in just one or two hours! This is all directed at you!”

“So what?” Xia ruofei asked.

“The fans are very concerned about you!” Guan Ping said exaggeratedly,”they all want to know how you are now! The text and pictures are too pale. If we directly record a video, the effect will definitely be explosive!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Guan Ping paused and said,”ruofei, it’s not an exaggeration to say that this is a once – in – a – century opportunity to gain fans for the company!” After all, you can’t take a plane every day, and it’s even more unlikely that plane accidents happen every day, right?”

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”are you hoping for something to happen to me?” How can you speak like that?”

“Don’t mind the details. I’m just saying that!” Guan Ping said,”the popularity on the internet comes and goes quickly. We must make full use of such a good opportunity! Of course, your popularity won’t die down too quickly. After all, there will be a lot of follow – up reports, and there might even be honors and awards in the country. ”

“Commendation and reward?” Xia ruofei said in confusion,”I’m not surprised that qiuhang sent me a big red flower or something. But what does it have to do with our country?”

Guan Ping chuckled,”even the China Civil Aviation Administration of China has made a statement, it seems like they want to give you a commendation and reward!” After all, you’re making a huge contribution to Aviation Safety! And there are so many passengers on the plane!”

Xia ruofei was speechless.

Guan Ping continued,”moreover, Sina Weibo contacted our company as soon as possible. They hope that you can create a Weibo account. You don’t have to worry about your identity verification. They will also send someone to maintain this account. They are even willing to give you a signing fee of no less than one million Yuan! This is the treatment of a celebrity!”

“What the ... There’s such a thing ...” Xia ruofei was also shocked.

He had underestimated the influence of this epic – Level forced downgrade. In fact, except for some big stars and some foreign stars, the now – developed Sina Weibo rarely invited others to join them. As for the feira people who paid for the contract, they were even rarer. Only when Penguin Weibo was still fighting with them did they frequently spend money to recruit people.

“Ruofei, I hope you have a clear understanding of your influence,” Guan Ping said.”Of course, we don’t want you to open a Sina Weibo account immediately, lest you take away the traffic from the company’s official Weibo account ...”

“I don’t have the time to open a Weibo account, okay?” Xia ruofei ridiculed.

“Of course you don’t need to maintain your own Weibo account, right?” Guan Ping said,”you’re too outdated! The self – Media accounts of those big – shot celebrities were all updated and maintained by their managers or assistants! In the future, our company will definitely send someone to manage your Weibo account!”

At this point, Guan Ping said,”Hey, hey, hey, can you stop interrupting?” International roaming is so expensive! Let’s talk about the video!”

Xia ruofei also realized that the impact of this incident might be far beyond his imagination. He began to seriously consider Guan Ping’s request. At this time when the public’s opinion was at its peak, his personal appearance would definitely bring about a big wave. This was without a doubt.

“How do you want me to cooperate?” he asked helplessly.

Guan Ping said happily,”I’ve already written the lines for you!” President Dong personally did it! I’ll send it to you on WeChat later. You just have to find a place with good scenery and recite the lines once! Of course, don’t be too stiff! Make a natural expression ...”

“Alright, alright, alright! I don’t need you to teach me this ...”Xia ruofei said,” hurry up and send it over!” I might have something to do soon!”

“Alright!” Guan Ping said.

......

After about half an hour, the netizens found that paradise Corporation had updated its Weibo again.

Xia ruofei was also paying attention to his company’s official Weibo. When he clicked on the video, he could not help but be stunned.

How could it be this version?

At the beginning of the video, there was a beautiful beach, the sea in the distance, and people playing under the setting sun. The environment was very peaceful.

Then, Xia ruofei appeared in the camera. In fact, he was going to set up the camera with the tripod, turn on the camera function, and then walk over.

Xia ruofei smiled at the camera and said,”Hello everyone, I’m Xia ruofei! Thank you for your concern, I’m very well now! Look, behind me is the most famous Michael Beach in Saipan. Although I came to Saipan by accident, the scenery here is really good! This trip was not in vain!
