2259 Elder song’s summoning (1)

Song Rui took a puff of his cigarette, smiled, and said,””Of course not!”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui quietly, waiting for him to continue. Xia ruofei knew that song Rui must have something important to tell him. Otherwise, he would not have avoided the people around him.

“Grandpa wants to meet you and talk to you about old master Liu ...” Song Rui said lightly.

Xia ruofei was a little surprised. He raised his eyebrows and asked,””Grandpa song, have you made a decision?”

Song Rui shrugged and said,”I don’t know ... The Liu family asked to see him many times, but he refused them all.” However, this time, the Liu family found a person whom Grandpa couldn’t refuse. After talking with him for more than an hour, Grandpa asked you to meet him at home ...”

Xia ruofei nodded thoughtfully and said,””Alright! The time is easy to arrange on my side, you can set the specific meeting time!”

Song Rui couldn’t help but say,”ruofei, that lobbyist is the old master of the GAO family. How should I put it ... Back then, Grandpa Gao and my grandfather were in the same Army. In a fierce battle, my grandfather was seriously injured. It was Grandpa Gao who risked his life to carry my grandfather down. Otherwise, my grandfather would have died!” So ... My grandfather owes Grandpa Gao his life. If he comes to my grandfather in person, there’s no way the old man can avoid him. ”

“Is this old man Gao very close to the old man of the Liu family?” Xia ruofei asked curiously.

He was indeed curious, and he couldn’t understand the relationship between the elders. Elder Gao and elder song were friends who had fought to the death on the battlefield, and the song and Liu families were competitors in various fields. It was unlikely that elder Gao would be close to the Liu family!

Of course, Xia ruofei had simplified things.

If they were still the hot – blooded young men from back then, this set of standards might still be applicable. But now, whether it was elder Gao, elder Liu, or even elder song himself, they all had a huge family on their shoulders. Any decision they made would not be measured by their own likes and dislikes.

What’s more, it had been decades since that war. How could the events that had happened in those decades be explained clearly with a few simple words? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Grandpa Gao and Grandpa Liu are life – and – Death friends,” song Rui nodded and said,”besides, their families have helped each other both politically and economically. You can say that they’re allies! “As for our family, although we’ve maintained a rather friendly relationship with the Gaos, we’ve rarely cooperated with them because of the Liu family. It’s already good enough that we don’t have any friction in various fields.”

Xia ruofei immediately understood. He nodded and said,””I understand. Then please arrange for me to meet with Grandpa song as soon as possible!”

Song Rui couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, you don’t have to do things that you’re not willing to do for Grandpa. Grandfather definitely wouldn’t force you. I’m guessing grandfather probably wouldn’t make any promises to Grandpa Gao. At most, he’d only agree to persuade you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”we’ll talk about it after we meet.” Report to Grandpa song and set a time for the meeting as soon as possible. I should be in the capital for the time being. ”

“Grandpa said that he can adjust his schedule at the last minute.” Song Rui said,”since you don’t have any problems, let’s set it for tomorrow morning! I’ll bring a car over to pick you up, you just have to wait at home!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said as he stood up from his chair. He smiled and said,”we’ve been out for a while. Let’s go in!”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s relaxed look, song Rui was a little confused. If it was someone else in this situation, even if they had a little confidence, they would still be a little nervous. After all, they were facing the pressure from the GAO clan and the Liu Clan, two behemoths.

Unless Xia ruofei had already decided to treat old master Liu, how could he be so calm?

However, song Rui felt that it was unlikely. It was not the first time that the Liu family’s disciples had a conflict with Xia ruofei. Last time, when they fought for land in the capital, Liu haofan of the Liu family was already at odds with Xia ruofei. Later on, Liu haojun, who had been working in the southeast province, returned to the capital with an ashen face. Although there was no evidence, song Rui and the others had vaguely guessed that Xia ruofei had something to do with it. With Xia ruofei’s personality, how could he easily bow to the Liu family?

Song Rui was deep in thought and followed Xia ruofei back to the private room.

When everyone saw Xia ruofei and song Rui return to their rooms, they quickly invited them to take their seats. Gao Jun and the others came forward to toast the two of them. The two female directors that Gao Jun had brought with him were obviously experts at drinking. They were good at adjusting the atmosphere and had good tolerance for alcohol. They also came forward to toast Xia ruofei and song Rui.

Recently, Li Zhe had been thinking of becoming a shareholder of the Paradise Association. Even if it was just a small share, it would be fine. Therefore, he was very attentive to Xia ruofei and song Rui.

Li Zhe’s investment in the Paradise society naturally wasn’t for the sake of making money. To be more precise, it wasn’t just for the sake of making money. What he valued more was the connections in this circle.

As a shareholder of the Paradise Club, not only could he be in the same boat as song Rui and Zhao Yongjun, but the nature of the club itself also determined that this was a top social event. As a shareholder of the club, he would naturally be able to enjoy the benefits of being in a favorable position.
