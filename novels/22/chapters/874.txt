Chapter 875: The arrival of an honored guest (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Mr. Xia, I’ve made a reservation. Let’s have lunch together!” He Feng said.

“Don’t worry,”he Feng quickly added,” the place I’ve chosen is very quiet, and there won’t be any random people. It’s still early, so we can go and make some tea first. ”

The director of the education Bureau had offered to treat he Feng to lunch, but he had rejected it. He wanted to treat Xia ruofei to a private meal.

From he Feng’s point of view, this was an opportunity that could not be missed.

He had been the Deputy District head in charge of education for several years. The change in leadership of the district Party Committee was coming soon. Originally, he did not have much hope, after all, his ranking was relatively low. But now, he saw a glimmer of hope.

Such an opportunity naturally had to be firmly grasped.

Xia ruofei did not have any special arrangements today. Besides, he Feng had put in a lot of effort to help Nan Nan with her enrollment. In the future, Nan Nan would also be studying in HE Feng’s area. Hence, Xia ruofei could not reject him. He thought about it and nodded in agreement.

“Mr. Xia, I’ll lead the way for you in my car!” He Feng was overjoyed and quickly said.

“Mayor he, please wait a moment,” said Xia ruofei after some thought.

With that, Xia ruofei quickly walked to his car, opened the door, and got in from the back.

He took out a small box of tea leaves from the medium.

He Feng had been busy preparing for Nan Nan’s studies. Xia ruofei felt that he should express his gratitude.

This small box of tea leaves was naturally the best Da Hong Pao tea leaves that Xia Qing had personally made. Xia ruofei had specially bought some exquisite small clay pots, each pot only able to hold about 50 grams.

In fact, even 50 grams was already a very precious gift. However, Xia ruofei’s gifts were all very expensive. For example, he had a gift box of iron – skinned Kaede bucket in his storage space, which was worth one to two hundred thousand Yuan.

Even if Xia ruofei didn’t care about the money, it was enough to be considered a bribe.

So after some consideration, he decided to give he Feng a small box of tea leaves to express his gratitude.

After taking the tea leaves, Xia ruofei got out of the car and handed the jar to he Feng. He smiled and said,””Mayor he, I’ll have to trouble you to help me with this matter. I don’t have much to give you, so just take these tea leaves as a token of my appreciation!”

“Mr. Xia, you don’t have to be so polite!” He Feng quickly declined. It’s just a small matter, how would I dare to accept your gift?”

“Could it be that Mayor he thinks my things are too bad?” Xia ruofei said angrily.

“I wouldn’t dare!” He Feng quickly said,”then ... Then thank you, Mr. Xia.”

Then, he took the tea leaves with joy.

In he Feng’s opinion, this small jar could not hold much tea leaves. However, Xia ruofei’s kindness made him even happier.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mayor he, this Da Hong Pao is not bad. It’s just that the annual production is too little. So, I don’t have much of it. Please don’t think that I’m stingy ...”

Xia ruofei could tell that he Feng’s attention was not on the can of tea leaves, so he tactfully reminded Wanwan that she should let the other party know the value of the gift. It was not Xia ruofei’s style to do good deeds without leaving a name.

He Feng then realized that this seemingly small jar of tea leaves could be very precious. In the southeast province, almost everyone knew a little about tea. Moreover, Xia ruofei had mentioned Da Hong Pao, so he Feng’s heart could not help but be moved.

“Mr. Xia, could this Da Hong Pao be ...” He quickly asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”although it’s not from the mother tree, the quality is about the same.”

“Aiya, this is really too precious,” he Feng quickly said.

He was very shocked, not only because he knew the value of the mother tree Da Hong Pao, but more importantly, he knew that tea leaves of this quality would not be sold on the market. Only a few leaders could get a certain quota.

But Xia ruofei was able to give away such tea leaves. What did this mean? It went without saying.

He Feng was even more certain that he had met a benefactor. While rejoicing, he also secretly made up his mind to firmly grasp the opportunity. Even if this team adjustment could not go further, he must continue to maintain a good relationship with Mr. Xia.

He Feng thanked Xia ruofei again and went back to his car with Xia ruofei. He Feng drove in front and led the way.

Xia ruofei followed behind. As he drove, he felt that the road seemed familiar. He couldn’t help but Mutter, “Don’t tell me he’s going to Xi Jiang Yue again?”

Xia ruofei’s guess was right. He Feng drove all the way to the side door of the West River Moon Club. After pressing the horn, he stuck his head out and waved. Immediately, a staff member opened the door and let them in.

Even if the average person had a membership card, they could only Park their car outside the scenic Area and walk in.

Although he Feng’s rank was not very high, only Deputy Director level, the West River Moon Club was opened in his jurisdiction. As the leader of the district government, he still had some face.

Xia ruofei laughed and followed.

The two of them parked the car under the guidance of the staff. Immediately, a tall and delicate welcoming lady in a cheongsam led the two of them to a private room.

The two of them passed through the quiet bamboo forest and arrived at the “moonlight at the Lotus pond” private room that he Feng had booked in advance.

Xia ruofei had been to the West River Moon Club a few times. He knew that this ‘moonlight lotus pond’ was the best private room in the club.
