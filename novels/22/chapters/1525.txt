Chapter 1526: Upgrade! Upgrade!_1

Translator: 549690339

Spirit map world, mountain and sea realm.

Xia ruofei’s face was pale. Song Wei was lying quietly on the grass, not showing any signs of waking up.

It had been more than eight hours since Song Wei first drank the soup.

In these eight hours, Xia ruofei did not rest at all. He kept sending song Wei into the time formation.

Song Wei had also consumed a total of seven bowls of soup.

However, there was no effect after he had consumed so much of the soup.

If not for the fact that the essence of the herbs in the soup was immediately absorbed by the body, Song Wei’s stomach would have burst.

Fortunately, Song Wei’s metabolism was extremely slow in her unconscious state. Besides, she did not eat anything other than the petals of the spirit Heart Flower. Hence, even though she had already been in a coma for 40 to 50 days, she did not need Xia ruofei to help her relieve herself.

Otherwise, it would be really awkward.

Although it wouldn’t affect a person much if they aged more than 50 days than normal, the key question was, when would this end?

If there was no effect after drinking so much soup, would it be effective if he continued to drink it?

Not to mention Xia ruofei, even Xia Qing’s tone became uncertain. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xia ruofei wanted to curse. The senior in the coffin must have had a way to wake Song Wei up, but he refused to say anything. Xia ruofei was helpless.

Were all experts this arrogant?

“Xia Qing, is there really no other way?” Xia ruofei asked, frowning.

“Actually ...” Xia Qing hesitated for a moment and said.

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. He grabbed Xia Qing’s shoulder and said anxiously,””You must have a way, right? Hurry up and tell me!”

Xia Qing revealed a very difficult expression. Xia ruofei immediately understood. Like a deflated ball, he asked weakly,””It’s that damn rule again?”

Xia Qing silently nodded.

Xia ruofei let go of his hand dejectedly. He knew how the rules were binding Xia Qing. No matter how he ordered or begged, Xia Qing would never be able to go against the Supreme rules.

This was like the famous Three Laws of Robotics.

After a long while, Xia ruofei still asked,””Xia Qing, I know you can’t tell me, and I won’t force you ... But, can’t you give me a hint? Just a little bit ...”

Xia Qing also revealed a conflicted expression. He lowered his head and muttered to himself, while Xia ruofei looked at Xia Qing nervously. He did not reject her, which meant that there might still be a chance.

Finally, Xia Qing raised her head and said,”master, I really can’t tell you ... But ... You’ve obtained so many world stones this time. Why don’t you let the spirit map world absorb them first?”

“I don’t have the time to care about the world stone now ...” Xia ruofei suddenly stopped mid – sentence and stared at Xia Qing’s eyes. Then he said,”I understand. Let’s try to see if we can upgrade the space first!”

Xia ruofei knew that Xia Qing wouldn’t speak without thinking. Just now, they were clearly discussing Song Wei’s soul injury, but Xia Qing suddenly brought up the world stone. This change of topic was too stiff and illogical.

The only explanation was that there might be an opportunity to heal Song Wei after the space was upgraded. Xia Qing could not say it directly due to the rules, so she could only hint to him.

After all, Xia ruofei had obtained the world stone. It was normal for Xia Qing to suggest him to upgrade the spatial realm. This was not against the rules. However, if she told him what he would gain after upgrading the spatial realm and that the gain might be helpful to Song Wei’s soul injury, then it would be against the rules.

It must be like this! Xia ruofei was certain.

At this time, the White realm Fox, which had been concentrating on comprehending the space rules at the entrance of the cave on the mountainside, suddenly opened its eyes. Then, in a flash, it flew down from the mountainside and ran in the direction of the herb garden.

The White realmfox’s speed was too fast. In addition, Xia ruofei was discussing with Xia Qing about treating Song Wei’s soul injury, so he did not notice it. Hence, by the time Xia ruofei reacted, the White realmfox had already run into the herb garden.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He saw the white fox waving its forelimbs a few times, and suddenly, a few herbs were uprooted. Everywhere it passed by was a mess.

Xia ruofei was shocked and angry. He quickly shouted,””Stop!”

This herb garden was painstakingly opened up by Xia Qing. A large portion of the herbs planted here were provided to the manufacturing factory to produce heart – nourishing soup and jaded skin ointment. Many of them were very precious Chinese herbs. Seeing these herbs destroyed by the realm Fox, Xia ruofei’s heart ached.

After letting out a cry, he immediately used the invisible force of space without hesitation to imprison the white fox.

The realm Fox wanted to struggle, but with its current weak cultivation, it was unable to compete with the power of the entire spirit map space. It was as if it had been frozen, unable to even move its toes. Only its black eyes showed a look of fear.

With a thought from Xia ruofei, the white fox was lifted by an invisible force and brought in front of him.

“Little brat! Are you crazy!” Xia ruofei asked,”do you know how precious those herbs are?”

The white fox had an innocent look on its face. In fact, it had just gained some insight when it was comprehending the rules of space and wanted to go to one of the space nodes to verify it. And that space node just happened to be in the medicine garden.
