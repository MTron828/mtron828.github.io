2849 A stone that stirred up a thousand ripples (1)

Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face. He waited for the reporters to calm down before he said,””I’m sorry, I’ve said just now that we’ll only release news today and will not accept questions and interviews. To respect the wishes of the video provider, I can’t reveal more information, but I can guarantee the authenticity of this video. Interested reporters can also go to Mr. Mayers to verify it!”

Only then did the reporters stop. Xia ruofei had the right to refuse to answer their questions, even if it was a press conference. However, the organizer had said that the press conference would only release news and there would be no Q & A session. This was completely acceptable.

“Mr. Xia, can you provide us a copy of this video?” a reporter asked loudly.

This was not an interview question. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Of course, no problem. Friends who need it, please leave your email number with our press officer after the press conference is over. We will send the video and the full statement released today to your friends!”

The reporters were relieved. The video was undoubtedly a bombshell that completely nailed The Sports Daily to the pillar of shame of the liar. Once the authenticity of Mayers ‘words was confirmed, especially the recording of what Mayers said in the video, it would be impossible to reverse the situation if they could get it.

The reporters ‘minds were no longer on the press conference. They couldn’t wait to go out and find Mayes to verify everything.

However, Xia ruofei had just said that he would release two pieces of news today. Therefore, other than this big video, there must be something else to be announced to the media. Thus, everyone was still patient, and they were more or less looking forward to it. After all, Xia ruofei’s performance and experience were legendary.

Xia ruofei looked around and smiled.””The second piece of news that I’ve released is also related to The Sports Daily and Pablo.”

The reporters ‘eyes brightened when they heard that. Everyone’s attention was back to the press conference and they all stared at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Pablo and The Sports Daily have been making a lot of strange comments about me and Wu Lei these days. They said that our joining of La Liga was a business operation. They said that our standards simply can’t meet the requirements of the top European leagues.” Even when the two of us broke the goals of the so – called cosmic team bar?a several times in the game against bar?a, such ridiculous remarks were still spreading. I don’t want to escalate the issue to racial discrimination, but I can’t pretend that I didn’t see or hear anything ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused for a moment to whet everyone’s appetites, then continued,””A small number of media outlets have such comments, when it comes to our goal in the last game, they all attribute our indisputable performance to luck. This was obviously laughable, and I didn’t even feel like refuting it. However, since someone has raised such a point of view, then I think ... I’ll use my actions to respond!”

He picked up the sponsored mineral water in front of him and took a sip before continuing,””As you all know, I’m usually very busy. I may only be able to represent the team in a few key games every season. But this time I’ve decided ... In the next round of our home game against Herona, I’ll still represent the real Espanyol club! I’ve already started the team’s training yesterday, and I believe that I can still help the team win with an outstanding performance in the next game! I’ve always believed that it’s useless to say anything to those people who wear colored glasses. Only by scoring goals can we shut their stinky mouths!”

Before the reporters could digest the news, Xia ruofei had already stood up and said with a smile,””That’s the news I want to announce! Today’s press conference came to an end! Once again, thank you to the media! Goodbye!”

Xia ruofei was even doing his job as a press officer. After he finished speaking, he left his seat and walked into the lounge next door from the side passage.

Jiang Xiaochen had not even recovered from the shock because Xia ruofei had not informed anyone about the two pieces of news in advance. Like the reporters, it was Jiang Xiaochen’s first time hearing about this.

It was only when Xia ruofei walked past him that he snapped out of his daze. He quickly stood up and followed her. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The club’s press officer stayed behind. Of course, without authorization, he couldn’t answer any of the reporters ‘questions. He just organized everyone to leave and registered their e – mail accounts. Every reporter at the scene asked him for the video.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the lounge, Zhou leiyun, who had been watching the live video of the press conference through the television in the lounge, had not recovered from his shock. When he saw Xia ruofei, he smiled bitterly and said,””President Xia, if there’s such big news next time, can you let me know in advance? This is too exciting!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I also received this video last night!” Wasn’t it the same whether he said it or not? If you knew about this video, would you stop me from releasing it to the media?”
