“That’s true ...” Zhao Yongjun was also happy.”Do you guys think we should thank ruofei? Or should we blame him for making our appetites too picky?”

“So I did something bad out of goodwill?” Xia ruofei’s innocent expression caused everyone to laugh.

But song Rui’s concern was obviously different from everyone else ‘s.

He asked,”ruofei, can you buy the Chinese perch from paradise Corporation in the capital?” I wanted to bring Yiyi to try the taste of this Chinese perch. ”

When the dish was first served, song Rui was a little disappointed. However, as an all – Natural foodie, he was the first to be conquered by the food. Not only that, but he also cared if his Yiyi could eat this dish.

Song Rui’s question was obviously what everyone wanted to ask as well. Everyone’s eyes were focused on Xia ruofei’s face.

On the other hand, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had nothing to do with this.

Naturally, Ling Qingxue could eat it whenever she wanted to. On the other hand, Song Wei was mainly active in the three mountains. As long as Ling’s restaurant had Yangtze River Chinese perch, it wouldn’t be difficult for her to eat it.

Xia ruofei said,”we’re still communicating with the distributors. In general, other than setting aside a portion of San Shan market and ensuring the monthly supply of lingji food and beverage, there should be a portion that will be sold nationwide. In theory, you can buy it in the capital, but there might not be too much.”

Xia ruofei’s words made everyone feel at ease.

As long as they could be sold in Beijing, there was no problem with the quantity. If they really wanted to buy it, they would definitely have a way.

Zhao Yongjun thought about it and smiled,” “What channels are we still looking for? If we work together, your goods can be sold in the capital tomorrow!”

“Yeah! Such a good Pomfret, there’s definitely no need to worry about sales!” Hou Liang said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said, ” I won’t trouble you guys with such a small matter. If you really want to eat kun fish, you can contact me at any time! ” I’ll get someone to send it over!”

Then, he explained the quick-freezing transportation of pomfrets, the need to create momentum on the internet, and the considerations peach blossom company had for developing a brand. He mainly didn’t want Zhao Yongjun and the others to misunderstand.

After hearing this, Hou Liang said, ” brother Xia, I don’t dare to say much about other things, but I can still contribute a little in terms of publicity. It’s not difficult to create momentum on the internet. Moreover, I can also contact a few television stations to do some interviews or something. It’s an online and offline collaboration! ”

Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued. Although the mobile internet was very advanced and traditional media was gradually declining, the National television and those satellite channels in various provinces still had a lot of influence.

Moreover, the advantage of traditional media was its credibility.

Compared to the information on the internet, everyone had developed a habit of subconsciously trusting the information on television, radio, and newspapers. If they could coordinate with the television station to participate in the dissemination of information, the effect would be much better.

“I think liangzi’s idea is pretty good!” Zhao Yongjun immediately replied, ” Beijing TV, shencheng TV, etc., They have a lot of influence! And it’s not that hard to coordinate the two.”

“Then I’ll have to trouble liangzi to ask around!” Xia ruofei did not stand on ceremony. He smiled and said, ” I don’t know much about the specific work. I’ll get our company’s Marketing Director to contact you later. ”

“No problem! You can count on me!” Hou Liang said straightforwardly.

This group of hedonistic young masters were very reserved in front of outsiders, but when it came to Xia ruofei, they would not “only speak a little”. Hou Liang directly took charge of everything.

Of course, he also had the strength to do so, so he didn’t have to worry about messing things up.

Liu Zhe, who was standing at the side, could not help but feel envious when he saw Xia ruofei, Hou Liang, and the others settling such a big matter in such a short time.

In the past, he had been doing pretty well in Sanshan city. However, compared to Hou Liang and the others, he was much smaller.

At the same time, he was even more grateful to Xia ruofei. Being able to attend such a dinner and get to know Hou Liang, Zhao Yongjun, and the others was undoubtedly a great opportunity for him.

Wei Jun had been a little reserved. After Xia ruofei and the others finished talking about this, he asked curiously,””Brother Xia, this Chinese perch must be very expensive, right?”

Xia ruofei said calmly,”our initial price is 3888 Yuan per 500 grams. I think there should be a lot of people who can afford it. This is because the kun fish is generally not very big. Like today’s fish, it’s only around 200 grams ...”

Hou Liang did some mental calculations and said,”So, this dish tonight will cost more than 20000 Yuan?”

Song Rui looked at Hou Liang with some disdain and said,””That’s the price for the Chinese perch. Don’t tell me the hotel doesn’t make money? I think it’s even possible to double ...”

“Did we eat 40000 to 50000 Yuan for this dish tonight?” Xu Zi Xuan couldn’t help but be a bit speechless.

To Xu Zi Xuan and the others, a meal of tens of thousands of Yuan was considered normal. Sometimes a bottle of wine was worth hundreds of thousands, but that was the best weapon for showing off. If it was just a dish of forty to fifty thousand Yuan, it still sounded a bit scary.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re all brothers. Isn’t it too vulgar to talk about money over a meal?” “Besides, that’s the supply price. In fact, our cost isn’t that high ...”

“No matter what, if we go to a hotel to eat, we’ll have to spend that amount!” Xu Zixuan said,”brother Xia is too open – minded! This level of hospitality is even higher than the state banquet!”

Quite a few of these guys had freeloaded on the state banquet before.

“Brother Xia, you’re so generous!” Hou Liang and the others also noisily echoed.

“Come, come, come, let’s toast to RUO Fei!” Zhao Yongjun laughed as he raised his glass.”To his warm reception, cheers!”

In fact, he hadn’t drunk for a while, and his appetite was getting a little restless again. He finally found an excuse, so he immediately brought a glass of wine.

After tasting the two main dishes, the lighter vegetables were served, followed by sweet soup, desserts, and fruits ...

Ling Ji’s private kitchen was a high – end specialty, and the ingredients used were all first – Class. The appearance of the dishes was also quite good, and even this group of well – informed nouveau riche in Beijing couldn’t help but sigh in admiration.

In fact, Hou Liang had been constantly egging Ling Qingxue on to open a branch in Beijing as soon as possible.

One could imagine that if Ling Ji private kitchen really opened a branch in Beijing, the number of customers that Hou Liang and the others would be able to bring in would be enough to keep them busy.

Xia ruofei’s girlfriend opened a shop in the capital. Wouldn’t these guys go and support her?

Ling Qingxue was also moved by his words. She said that she would suggest to her father to put it on the agenda as soon as possible.

After the meal, Zhao Yongjun suggested,””Brothers, have you all eaten and drunk well? Why don’t we ... Go out and take a look at those goods?”

“Alright!”

“I’ll have some after – meal games to digest my food!”

“That makes sense! Brother Xia and sister – in – Law are too good at entertaining me, I’m a little full. ”

This group of people were not afraid of anything. They were famous in the capital for being reckless, and they were even more courageous when they came to the three mountains, so they were all eager to give Zhao Yongjun’s proposal a try.

Xia ruofei said,”then let’s go out and take a look!” But I’ll still say it, if you can avoid using violence, then don’t use violence. We’re all refined people!”

“Let’s go!” Zhao Yongjun stood up and walked out.

By the wall, Tian Xiaojun and the others were on the verge of despair. Their bodies were so cold that they were about to turn into popsicles.

However, Zhao Yongjun and the others were too powerful. They didn’t dare to leave, so they could only squat there.

When he heard the courtyard door creak, Tian Xiaojun helplessly turned his head to look at the courtyard door. The door had creaked many times that night, but it was always the waiters coming in and out. At the beginning, Tian Xiaojun would look at the door with anticipation, but now he was a little numb to it.

When he saw the tall Zhao Yongjun walk out of the courtyard and walk straight towards them, Tian Xiaojun was stunned for a moment, then he reacted. A trace of anticipation welled up in his heart, but at the same time, he was very nervous, not knowing how Zhao Yongjun and the others would deal with him.

Seeing that Zhong Zixin and Xia Ling were still squatting there in a daze with their heads down, Tian Xiaojun quickly pushed them.

At this time, Zhao Yong Jun and the others had already walked in front of Tian Xiao Jun and the other two, forming a semi – Circle behind them.

Tian Xiaojun tried his best to squeeze out a flattering smile. He raised his head and said,”Young master Zhao! Hello ...”

Zhao Yongjun’s cold eyes shot over and he asked indifferently,””You’re Tian Xiaojun?”
