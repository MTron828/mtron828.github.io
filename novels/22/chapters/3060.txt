3061 A night in the capital city (2)

Xia ruofei immediately imagined himself wearing a floral nightdress and could not help but shiver. He quickly said,””Then forget it!”

Song Wei chuckled as she ran up the stairs. She found some clothes in the closet in the bedroom and went downstairs to take a shower.

Although she had been with Xia ruofei for a long time, Song Wei was still very shy.

She even specially rolled her undergarments under her pajamas before walking downstairs with them.

The sharp – eyed Xia ruofei saw this and couldn’t help but laugh.””Wei Wei, you didn’t hide it well! The shoulder straps are showing ...”

Song Wei blushed and rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei. She tightened her grip on her clothes and walked into the bathroom on the first floor barefooted.

After a while, the sound of water could be heard.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he couldn’t help but feel an itch in his heart. It had been a long time since he was with Song Wei and Ling Qingxue. Although he was a golden core cultivator, his cultivation technique was not one that focused on pure heart and few desires. He also had such needs.

He couldn’t help but stand up, take a bottle of iced Coke from the refrigerator, and gulp down a few mouthfuls before he felt the evil fire in his heart slightly suppressed.

Half an hour later, Song Wei was finally done. She was wearing a cute pajama with a bear pattern. She wiped her wet hair with a towel as she walked out of the bathroom.

“It’s your turn!” Song Wei smiled and said,”I’ve prepared a new set of toiletries for you!”

“Thanks!” Xia ruofei walked over and wanted to hug Song Wei.

However, Song Wei dodged it nimbly. She chuckled and said,””Let’s go take a shower! I smell on my body!”

Xia ruofei sniffed and said with a puzzled look,””There’s a smell? I didn’t smell it!”

In fact, after becoming a golden core cultivator, the impurities in one’s body had been cleaned up. Even if one sweated occasionally, there would not be a strong smell of sweat. Moreover, Xia ruofei did not sweat much today.

“It’s the smell of alcohol!”Song Wei said with a smile. Have you forgotten how much you drank in the Tang family manor?”

Song Wei felt as if she was in a dream. A few hours ago, they were still drinking and chatting happily in an Australian Manor in the Southern Hemisphere. In such a short time, they were back in Beijing and even took a detour to the three mountains ...

Xia ruofei touched his nose and said embarrassedly,””Then I’ll hurry and go wash up!”

With that, he also rushed into the bathroom.

It was naturally not so troublesome for a man to take a bath. He took off his clothes quickly and quickly, turned on the cold water, and began to wash.

In less than ten minutes, Xia ruofei was done washing up. He took out a set of clean pajamas from the spirit map space and put them on. Then, he put the dirty clothes back into the spirit map space and walked out of the bathroom.

As soon as he stepped out of the door, Xia ruofei saw Song Wei putting some snacks on the coffee table in the living room into her storage ring.

Song Wei was embarrassed that Xia ruofei had noticed her. She explained,”I was thinking ... If I put some food in my storage ring, I can take it out to eat when I’m hungry. It’ll be quite convenient!”

Xia ruofei suppressed his laughter and did not expose Song Wei. Instead, he nodded seriously.

In fact, he knew that Song Wei’s novelty had not passed and she wanted to put everything she saw into her storage space.

This was similar to a new driver who had just gotten his driver’s license and wanted to drive.

On the airboat, there was nothing for her to keep and play with, except for some small things in her own small bag. Now that she was home, she naturally wanted to keep this and that.

Xia ruofei said,”actually, you can also put some clothes in the storage ring!” This way, I can change and wash up wherever I go!”

“Oh, right!” Song Wei’s eyes lit up.”That’s a good idea! I’ll go tidy it up and put some clothes in the ring!”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. He was just joking, but Song Wei took it seriously.

How could he use the precious time of the night to tidy up his clothes? Isn’t that a bit too wasteful? UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xia ruofei suddenly felt like he was trapped in his own cocoon.

He cleared his throat and said,””Well ... Wei Wei, have you ever thought about a question? A lot of clothes have to be hung in the closet. If you put all of them into your storage ring, won’t they wrinkle after a long time? Then how are we going to wear it!”

“It seems to make sense!” Song Wei stopped in her tracks and frowned.”What should we do? RUO Fei, I really think it’s very convenient to put some clothes in the storage ring!”

Xia ruofei laughed in his heart and said,”well ... There’s a way. As long as there’s a wardrobe to hang the clothes, they won’t crumple!” So, actually, you’re lacking a wardrobe. When you’re free tomorrow, go buy a wardrobe, then sort out the clothes you want to put into the ring and put them in this wardrobe. Can’t you just put them all in the wardrobe? I’ve checked it, and the space in this storage ring is quite large!”

“Good idea!” Song Wei immediately gave him a thumbs up. At the same time, she gave up the idea of tidying up her clothes.

“Let me see ...” Song Wei thought for a while and said,”some toiletries and daily necessities can also be put in the storage ring!” Even kitchenware and utensils ... Wow! I’m going to have to tidy up!”

Xia ruofei quickly stopped the excited Song Wei and said with a bitter face,”Great aunt, look at what time it is now. It wouldn’t be too late to do these things tomorrow! Now ... Shouldn’t you go and rest?”

Song Wei saw the desire in Xia ruofei’s eyes and felt her face heat up. Then, she couldn’t help but burst out laughing.”Then go rest! But I’ve already made an agreement with Qingxue, we can only sleep in separate rooms ...”

“How can there be any rooms to share!” Xia ruofei was speechless.”There’s only one room in total!” Can you teach me how to split it?”

“Isn’t there still a sofa in the living room?”Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled.

“It’s not easy for me to come to your house and you want me to sleep on the sofa? Isn’t this a little inhumane?” Xia ruofei said pitifully.

“I mean, I can sleep on the sofa!” Song Wei said with a smile. I’m not like some golden core cultivators who can’t even take this little bit of pain ... Besides, my sofa is very soft. I often lie on it and watch TV, so I fall asleep directly!”

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t. That’s even more unacceptable!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”Weiwei, what’s our relationship? let’s just squeeze in the same bed! Your bed is pretty big, I promise ... I won’t mess around ...”

“I’d rather believe in ghosts than your mouth!” Song Wei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei saw that the soft approach did not work, so he could only use the hard approach.

He used his fastest speed and easily carried Song Wei by the waist. As Song Wei screamed, he quickly walked up the stairs and placed her on the soft bed.

Actually, Song Wei was just being reserved with her words. Since she had promised Xia ruofei that she would spend the night at her house, she knew what would happen. She could not possibly keep her promise.

The rejection just now was partly to make her feel at ease and partly to joke with Xia ruofei.

Song Wei lay on her side on the bed, her tender arms supporting her head. She glanced at Xia ruofei flirtatiously and said,””You’re really fast! I can’t even react in time! As expected of the Golden core stage! But ... You’ve spent all your cultivation on this ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”this is the most important matter!” It wasn’t embarrassing to use one’s cultivation on this! I finally understand that you can’t be too honest!”

With that, Xia ruofei kicked off his slippers and jumped onto the bed.

Song Wei giggled as she tried to hide, but Xia ruofei hugged her.

Soon, a heart – shaking music score came from the small single apartment ...
