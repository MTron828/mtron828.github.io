Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.”Alright then! Be good and go to class this afternoon. I’ll drive over to pick you up!”

“Yay! Thank you, brother ruofei!” Lin Qiao said with joy.

Xia ruofei sent Lin Qiao back to the dormitory, then got into his car and left the campus of Heron Island University.

Xia ruofei went out from the main entrance and went directly to the Nanputuo Temple next to Egret University. After touring around, he drove to the Fort on huli mountain near the other gate of Egret University and stayed there until threeo’ clock. After receiving Lin Qiao’s call, he left huli mountain and drove to the gate of Egret University to pick up Lin Qiao. Then, he went straight to the dock.

At around 4:30, Zhao Yongjun and the others, who had been free for the whole day in Heron Island City, arrived at the dock one after another. Xiao Zhang also took the ferry to pick them up, so everyone took the boat back to Gulangyu.

On the ferry, Zhao Yongjun took out a small box from his bag and said with a smile,””Little sister Lin Qiao! I didn’t prepare a gift for our first meeting, but I saw something nice when I was shopping today, so I bought it for you!”

“Big brother Zhao, I have another gift?” Lin Qiao said in surprise.

“Of course, you’re ruofei’s sister, so you’re our sister! It’s the first time we’re meeting, so of course there’s a gift!” Zhao Yongjun laughed,”open it and see if you like it!”

Lin Qiao took the box and opened it. There was a beautiful Women’s Watch inside. It had a steel case, a key – shaped crown, a synthetic spinel, a silver – plated dial with carved patterns, a sword – shaped Blue Steel pointer, a bright wine – red crocodile – Skin watch strap, and a sun – pattern radiation effect.

Xia ruofei also came over to take a look. It was a classic Cartier female watch. Although it was not considered a luxury item, it cost at least 30000 HxB.

Xia ruofei said,”brother Zhao, this gift is a little too expensive. Qiao’ er is a young lady. It’s not good for her to use such a good watch ...”

When Lin Qiao saw the watch, she was already very fond of it. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she couldn’t help but ask,””Brother ruofei, is this watch very expensive?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it should be around 30000 to 40000!”

Lin Qiao was shocked and quickly stuffed the box into Zhao Yongjun’s hand. She stuck out her tongue and said,”Brother Zhao, I don’t dare to accept such an expensive gift ...”

Zhao Yongjun glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Girl, it’s not as expensive as RUO Fei said. There’s an event today, and it’s only 29999 Yuan!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s different!” That’s 30000 Yuan!”

Zhao Yongjun said,”ruofei, I’m just giving a gift to a girl, what’s wrong with that?” You’re meddling too much! Lin Qiao, don’t listen to your brother. It’s just a meeting gift. This amount of money is nothing to me!”

Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei hesitantly.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””Qiao’ er, since big brother Zhao has already bought it, you should just accept it! This is a female watch that he can’t wear himself. If we take it, we can prevent him from using this watch to harm other girls. It’s also a good deed ...”

Lin Qiao couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Why are you so mean?” Zhao Yongjun said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After a round of banter, Lin Qiao still accepted Zhao Yongjun’s gift. She took it out and tried it on. The Burgundy strap made her wrist look even whiter. The watch was small and exquisite, but it didn’t lose its heroic spirit, which suited Lin Qiao very much.

Zhao Yongjun’s eyes were pretty good.

“Thank you, brother Zhao!” Lin Qiao said sweetly.

“You’re welcome, as long As You Like It!”Zhao Yongjun laughed. I was afraid that the gift I bought at the last minute wouldn’t be to your liking! It’s all RUO Fei’s fault. He kept it a secret so well that he only told us that his sister was studying here when he was about to arrive at Heron University ...”

Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei with smiling eyes and chuckled.

At this moment, song Rui and the others came over. Song Rui shouted,””Big brother Zhao, you’re too unkind!”
