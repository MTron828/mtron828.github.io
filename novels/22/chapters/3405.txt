Chapter 3406: Nine turn space splitting formation (2)

Translator: 549690339

Just like that, Xia ruofei used more than 50 minutes to prepare the materials for the nine turn space splitting formation.

When Xia ruofei was done with the last set of formation materials, he was surrounded by a pile of processed formation materials. They were floating around him, almost blocking his entire body.

After confirming that Xia ruofei had finished preparing the materials for the formation, master Yuntai muttered,” “Fellow Daoist Xia, you’ve really scared me…”

Xia ruofei was checking the materials for the formation. He was stunned for a moment and then smiled. “Senior Yuntai, what do you mean?”

“I didn’t think that fellow Daoist Xia would be so talented in the rules of space,” said scholar Yuntai.”You’re also so accomplished in the array path. It’s really amazing!”

“Senior is too kind!” Xia ruofei quickly checked the materials that had been processed and said,”! was pressed for time and had no choice but to take such a risky approach. Fortunately, I was lucky and did not make any big mistakes.”

“It should be said that there are no mistakes!” Scholar Yuntai said,”I’ve seen the entire process of you handling the array materials just now. It seems that there are no mistakes.”

Xia ruofei shook his head slightly and said,”it’s still too rushed. Two of the talismans have a small deviation. It might affect the effect of the array.” But luckily, I still have a few minutes to salvage the situation!”

In reality, the goldthread nether snake was already very close to the spirit map in the outside world. If the spirit map was a human, he would have been able to smell the stinky poison that the snake was exhaling.

However, with the help of the time formation, Xia ruofei could still handle the materials with relative ease.

As he spoke, he took out two more Jade talismans and quickly began to carve.

This was his second time inscribing these two talismans. He was also multitasking, so it was much easier than before. Moreover, because he had already carved it once before, he was already aware of the deviations in the parts. Therefore, this time, it was very smooth. In just two to three minutes, the two array talismans were completed.

In the mysterious ore space, layman Yuntai was speechless when he saw Xia ruofei’s actions.

To be honest, from his point of view, the two talismans that Xia ruofei had made were no different from the previous two. It could be seen that the difference that Xia ruofei had mentioned was actually very small.

Under such a tight situation, Xia ruofei was still striving for perfection, which made master Yuntai sigh.

Could this be the standard of a genius?

Xia ruofei didn’t have much time to chat with master Yuntai. He was constantly paying attention to the outside world. At this time, the goldthread nether snake had almost caught up with the spirit map. He had to go out and set up the array as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei tried to set it up in the spirit map space.

There were 108 talismans for this nine turn space splitting array. Each talisman had a specific position and could not deviate from it. Otherwise, the array might lose its effect. This was a test of Xia ruofei’s control. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was a good thing that his spiritual power had improved by a large margin, and he had a very deep understanding of this array.

Therefore, he set up the array with a wave of his hand.

Xia ruofei felt the operation of the formation and nodded in satisfaction.” “It looks pretty good… But if I have enough time, the power of the formation can increase by at least 20%. But that’s all 1 can do now…”

Yuntai scholar was speechless. So Xia ruofei was not satisfied with this formation, or rather, it was just barely satisfactory to Xia ruofei. This requirement was too high!

With master Yuntai’s understanding of the nine turn space splitting formation, even a nascent Soul Stage cultivator would find it hard to do better than Xia ruofei in the same amount of time.

To be more precise, not many original infant stage cultivators could do what Xia ruofei did.

As for Aurous core stage cultivators, there was no need to even mention them.

Even if there was no time limit, it was an almost impossible task for an Aurous core stage cultivator to make the talismans for the nine turn space splitting array.

Not to mention that in such a short period of time, he had to deal with the materials of the array three times at the same time. It was simply a fantasy. If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, perhaps even he himself would not have believed it.

Xia ruofei waved his hand to remove the formation and let the materials float in the air. He then used his spiritual power to check the situation outside.

At that moment, the goldthread nether snake had almost caught up to the spirit map. Xia ruofei saw a frozen scene. The goldthread nether snake had extended its long tongue halfway, and the Crimson spikes on it were clearly visible.

It was obvious that the golden thread nether snake was trying to wrap its tongue around the spirit map. However, the time inside and outside was two thousand times faster, so Xia ruofei could only see the extremely slow and almost fixed image.

However, he could not delay any longer. Xia ruofei muttered to himself and left the spirit map space with a thought.

Before he left, he had already investigated the surrounding terrain and the situation of the goldthread nether snake, so he was well-prepared.

Xia ruofei appeared about three meters to the right of the spirit map. He used his Yuan Qi to protect himself and grabbed a protruding rock at that spot. At the same time, he kept the spirit map without hesitation.

Almost at the same time, the golden thread nether snake’s fearsome tongue had already reached the spot where the spirit map had been, and it directly struck the rock, sending rock chips flying.

Just as the goldthread nether snake was about to capture the painting, it suddenly disappeared into thin air. Then, that annoying human appeared in front of it. Naturally, it was both shocked and angry.

The snake’s agile tongue did not retract at all. It turned to the right and stabbed at Xia ruofei’s forehead.

The snake’s tongue was very fast and it could turn in the middle. This was indeed out of Xia ruofei’s expectations.

However, Xia ruofei did not dare to stay where he was. He appeared in the outside world and grabbed the protruding rock. As he collected the spirit map, he exerted more force in his hand and his body suddenly rose into the air. He managed to avoid the snake’s attack.

However, the goldthread nether snake was too close to him, and its speed had increased. Even if Xia ruofei dodged one attack, it would be difficult for him to Dodge the subsequent attacks. Furthermore, to ensure his agility, he did not even wear his spacesuit this time. In other words, he was completely relying on the energy shield to protect himself. Once the shield broke, he would be instantly killed by the poisonous mist. Therefore, it was very dangerous to fight the snake at such a close distance.

Xia ruofei had also made his move after careful planning. He did not intend to rely on his speed and strength to deal with the goldthread nether snake. After he dodged the attack from the snake’s tongue, a black ball had already appeared in his palm. Then, he threw it at the goldthread nether snake without hesitation.

Xia ruofei had planned all of this before he left the spirit map space. He appeared in the outside world, grabbed the protruding rock wall, retrieved the spirit map scroll, jumped up to avoid the snake’s tongue attack, and threw the black ball. All of these actions were done in one go. He had dodged the snake’s attack. It was a close call.

Xia ruofei had gotten the black ball from Shen tianfang’s storage belt.

When Shen tianfang and Xia ruofei were fighting, he had also used this black ball and caused great damage to the trap and kill array.

Therefore, Xia ruofei was very clear about the power of the black ball. The Super high temperature and air waves produced by its explosion, as well as the burning flames, were difficult for ordinary intermediate golden core cultivators to withstand.

Even though he was a little heartbroken, Xia ruofei did not hesitate to use the life-saving item left behind by Shen tianfang.

The golden thread nether snake was moving upwards at an extremely fast speed while the black ball was thrown downwards by Xia ruofei with all his might. Hence, in the blink of an eye, the black ball had hit the snake’s huge triangular head. At the same time, Xia ruofei’s trace of vital Qi had also touched the ball.

Suddenly, the black ball exploded..
