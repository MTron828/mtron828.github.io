“Brother ruofei ... These ... These ... Are the two ornamental fish you were talking about?” Lin Qiao was dumbfounded.”This is ... Too big ...” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I never said it was little Yu ‘er!” They were already this big! Otherwise, I’ll make such a big fish tank for two fish. I’m sick ...” “Who told you to keep me in suspense!” Lin Qiao blushed and rolled her eyes. Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun carried the two large boxes into the living room. Xia ruofei first found a water ladle from the kitchen and scooped some water from the box into the big fish tank that had been cleaned. Then, he carefully picked up the red Arowana with both hands and gently put it in. The two red Arowana had changed their environment and Xia ruofei had scooped them out of the water. Logically, they should be shocked. However, the red Arowana had been living in the Spirit map space for a long time and were very familiar with Xia ruofei’s aura. Furthermore, Xia ruofei often fed them and added flower petal solution to them, so their reaction was not very intense. They just swam quickly in the shallow water in the fish tank. Xia ruofei quickly scooped the water from the two large tidied boxes into the fish tank. He tried his best to pour the water along the walls of the fish tank so as not to cause any more disturbance to the red Arowana. The two large boxes were filled with spatial spirit pool water. There was even some flower petal solution. Hence, Xia ruofei did not waste a single drop and added it all into the fish tank. After the water was added, the water level in the fish tank was just right. Ye Lingyun and Lin Qiao were also looking at the two rare red Dragons in front of the fish tank. Lin Qiao couldn’t help but click her tongue in wonder. Xia ruofei turned on the lights. The fish tank was equipped with a kind of light tube specially produced for the blood red Dragons. Under the light, the surface of the two big red Dragons emitted a faint red light. There was a trace of golden light in the red light, which made them look very beautiful. It was said that this lamp also had all the spectrum needed for the growth of the Blood Red Dragon, which was very beneficial to the growth of the Blood Red Dragon. The side of the fish tank against the wall was also black. When they swam in the fish tank, it was as if they were in a painting, especially the delicate fins and neatly arranged scales under the light, which really gave people a sense of amazement. “Brother ruofei, this pair of fish is so beautiful ...” Lin Qiao said,”why are their heads raised?” What kind of fish is this? I’ve never seen this before ...” “This is a Red Arowana.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as for their heads ... Don’t you think that they look beautiful when they tilt their heads up?” “I can’t tell ...” Lin Qiao said,”but the curve of the whole fish is quite beautiful!” “Mm! It’s said that wild red Arowana mainly relied on speed when hunting, so they slowly evolved into this streamlined body. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “So that’s how it is!” Lin Qiao looked at the red Arowana and said,”this fish is really big! No wonder you ordered such a long fish tank. ” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”didn’t you say you could pack 20?” Give me twenty of these red Arowana ...” The two red Arowana were close to 90 centimeters long. The fish tank looked big, but it was just enough to keep the two red Arowana. There was just a little space left for the length. “It’s you who didn’t explain clearly ...” Lin Qiao blushed and said,”who knew you would bring back two such big fish?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he saw Lin Qiao’s exasperation. Lin Qiao rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”I can’t be bothered with you! I’ll take some photos and post them on my moments, Hmph!” After that, Lin Qiao took out her phone and took several photos of the fish tank from various angles. Then, she adjusted the camera to the front and took two selfies with the phone. Lin Qiao clicked on the photo that she had just taken and pouted,”The angle of the selfie isn’t good...Brother ruofei, help me take a few pictures ...” After that, Lin Qiao stuffed the phone into Xia ruofei’s hand. Then, she walked to the fish tank, lifted one leg slightly, and made a cute Pose. Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head. He took out his phone and took a few pictures of Lin Qiao. “It’s fine this time!” Lin Qiao looked at the photo and said with a smile,”thank you, brother ruofei! I’m posting it on my moments ... Done!” Xia ruofei opened WeChat on his phone with interest and looked at Lin Qiao’s post. He laughed and said,””Girl, are you posting a picture of the red Arowana or a selfie? How come I don’t see any pictures with fish?” “None of your business! “I like it ...” Lin Qiao blushed and pouted. “Okay, okay, okay, as long As You Like It ...” Xia ruofei was also admiring the red Arowana in the living room. He felt more and more that he had made the right decision. Other factors aside, although the red Arowana were more suitable for the wild environment, he had to admit that they were really beautiful in the tank. Against the black background, the two red, nearly one – meter – long big fish swam leisurely back and forth, which was really pleasing to the eye. Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao didn’t expect that after that seemingly ordinary post, these two red Arowana would become popular in such an unexpected way. In the district of the capital of the great Confucian sect. In the penthouse apartment in block A of Building 5. A middle – aged man with slicked – back hair and a big belly came to the living room with a glass of water. He glanced at his daughter, who was playing with her phone on the sofa. He frowned and said,””Lulu, why are you still playing with your phone? Have you finished your winter homework?” “There’s only a little left!”Lulu replied without raising her head. Isn’t there still a few days before school reopens?” The middle – aged man put down the cup and sat next to Lulu. He said in a serious tone,”Lulu! You’re going to be in the second semester of your third year of high school soon. Time is very tight, and your learning tasks are very heavy! Your priority now is to take the college entrance examination. Do you think you can get into university if you hold your phone every day?” As the middle – aged man spoke, he looked at Lulu’s phone screen and continued, “He’s refreshing his moments again! What’s there to see in this moments? I think you’ll have to do it 800 times a day ... Huh?” When the middle – aged man saw the photo displayed on Lulu’s phone, his preaching came to an abrupt end, and his face showed a very surprised look. Then, he couldn’t help but move his head closer to Lulu’s phone screen. Lulu subconsciously protected her phone and said in a coquettish voice,”Dad, why are you still looking at my phone? This is my private ...” “No... You ... This ... This photo ...” The middle – aged man was very shocked, and he was even incoherent. Lulu looked at the middle – aged man warily and said,””What’s wrong with the photo? This is my classmate! Dad, do you have to be like this? Do you believe that I can tell my mom that you can’t move after seeing my beautiful classmate ...” The middle – aged man didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”you child! What are you talking about ... What beauty? I’m talking about this fish!” [PS] I was delayed by something at home tonight, so I was still a few minutes late. Please forgive me, brothers and sisters. This chapter was the third update on the 24th, and the number of updates remained the same on the 25th. Finally, I’m asking for monthly votes. The ranking is about to slip out of the top ten. Do you still have tickets? How about a few thousand assists?
