2931 Listening to his words and observing his actions (2)

When he saw that Charlie cohe was calling him personally, he hurriedly picked it up and respectfully said,”Mr. Cohe! Hello there!”

“Goodman, I’ve talked to my Chinese friend. He’s pretty satisfied with your Bay group’s decision and the compensation you proposed, but he also put forward a condition ...”

“Please speak!” Goodman quickly said,”we’ll do our best to satisfy your friend’s request!”

“My Chinese friend said that from today on, the Bay group’s drugs are not to be sold to China in any form. If you can do this, then this matter will be considered over!” Said Charlie cohe.

Goodman hesitated.

For the past two to three years, the Bay group’s major strategy had been to develop the Asia – Pacific market. After all, there were vast sales and huge potential there. It was a huge market that had not been developed by them yet. Although the profits in the Asia – Pacific market still accounted for a high proportion of the group’s total profits in the past few years, it had shown a trend of increasing year by year, and the increase was very obvious.

If they gave up, it would mean that the Bay group would have to adjust its strategic direction, which would inevitably cause great losses. At least, the initial investment would be in vain.

However, Goodman quickly realized that giving up on the Chinese market did not mean giving up on the entire Asia – Pacific market. Although losing the Chinese market would result in a huge loss in the future, they could still make a move in other Asia Pacific regions and try to make up for their losses. And if he didn’t agree to the other party’s conditions, then all his previous efforts would have been in vain, and ERAD’s death would have been in vain.

Goodman quickly came to a conclusion.

Therefore, he immediately said,”no problem!” Mr. Cohe! In the future, all of Bay group’s ice, marijuana, and Coke would not enter the Chinese market! We’ll be withdrawing all of our Chinese market explorers in the near future!”

Charlie cohe naturally noticed Goodman’s hesitation. He said sternly,”Goodman, I hope you can keep your word! Don’t try to fool people with tricks that deceive children! If you sell the drugs through a shell company or to distributors that are deeply rooted in the Chinese market, or use other means to sell drugs to China, you will be subject to the harshest sanctions of the cohe family! I’m not trying to scare you, but the entire Bay group will cease to exist!”

Goodman shuddered and quickly said,””Mr. Cohe! Even if you lend me a few guts, I wouldn’t dare to deceive you! I’ll definitely follow up on this matter personally, there won’t be any mistakes!”

“I hope so!” Charlie cohe said indifferently,”I’ve made a promise to my Chinese friends. If anything goes wrong on your side, you know the consequences.”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Goodman quickly said,”there won’t be any problems! Please rest assured!”

Only then did Charlie Koch’s tone become slightly more relaxed,”Goodman, you should thank God for getting through this safely. If it were my Chinese friends, you and your confidants would’ve been dead by now!”

Goodman was so scared that his whole body shivered. He knew that there was no need for Charlie Coch to lie to him, and he didn’t care about it at all. Adding on his previous reasoning, he was pretty sure that this Chinese friend of his, Charlie Coch, was a non – existent Kong that he couldn’t fight against.

Goodman quickly said with tears of gratitude,””Mr. Cohe, thank you so much for this! If there’s anything I can help you with in the future, please let me know!”

Charlie Koch did not respond to Goodman’s words, and only said,”Goodman, I’ll tell you one last thing. It was also from my Chinese friend.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Goodman was a little disappointed that he didn’t get a response, but he still said,””Mr. Cohe, please speak!”

“There’s a Chinese saying,’listen to what you say, observe what you do’. Right now, my friend is basically satisfied with your attitude. The next step will depend on your performance. If you’re just talking without actually taking action, I’m afraid ...”

Goodman quickly said,”Mr. Cohe!” I will fulfill all my promises immediately, including the preferential treatment and protection for the Chinese!”

“That’s good!” Charlie cohe said,”the people from Huafeng shipping will contact you for the details of the follow – up. I hope you can fulfill your promise.”

“Yes! Mr. Charlie!” Goodman said.

Charlie cohe did not say anything else and directly hung up the phone. When Goodman heard the busy tone from the phone, he carefully hung up and let out a long sigh. He realized that his forehead was covered in sweat.

Goodman calmed down and immediately picked up his phone to give orders. He arranged everything as quickly as possible, including mobilizing 100 million US dollars to be ready to withdraw at any time. He also arranged for a full withdrawal from the Chinese market and to give preferential treatment to The Chinese in Mexico in the future, providing protection to the Chinese, etc.

Fortunately, Bay group wasn’t like the traditional big companies, where there were Board of Directors and other shareholders. Basically, Goodman had the final say in Bay group. Although he gave some of his trusted subordinates some shares and dividends, as long as he gave the order, his subordinates would immediately carry it out without any doubt.

Hence, Goodman’s orders were quickly passed down and carried out.

……

Over at iswatlan, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to find Zhang Chao. Instead, he waited until he received the email from Pierre before asking Luo Qingfeng to call Zhang Chao over.

While waiting for Zhang Chao, Xia ruofei looked at the two videos and the photos.

Xia ruofei only took a quick look at the photos and videos of ERAD’s execution. With his eyes, he could naturally tell that there were no traces of fraud in the photos and videos. Unless ERAD had a twin brother who looked exactly the same, this guy who had been spouting sh * t about the Chinese people would have been sent to meet Satan by the people of the Bay group.

Xia ruofei had watched the video that Goodman had recorded from start to finish.

The video wasn’t long. In the video, Goodman first sincerely apologized to Huafeng shipping and said that he had severely punished the parties involved. Then, he promised that there would be no similar incidents in the future, and that the Bay group would provide protection and various preferential treatment to the Chinese in the future. It was basically the same as what Charlie Koch had told him.

Xia ruofei had just finished watching the video when he heard a knock on the door. He closed his laptop and shouted,””Please enter!”

The door was pushed open, and Luo Qingfeng walked in with Zhang Chao.

Zhang Chao’s face showed a trace of fatigue as he respectfully asked,””Mr. Xia, you were looking for me?”

“Brother Zhang, please have a seat!” Xia ruofei nodded.

After Luo Qingfeng brought Zhang Chao over, he filled Xia ruofei’s cup with water and then made another cup of tea for Zhang Chao.

Zhang Chao had seen Luo Qingfeng’s powerful performance with his own eyes. When he saw Luo Qingfeng serving him tea, he was so shocked that he stood up and said,””Old Sir, I don’t dare! I don’t dare!”

In fact, with Luo Qingfeng’s pride as a golden core cultivator, how could he serve tea to an ordinary person under normal circumstances? He positioned himself as Xia ruofei’s servant. Zhang Chao was just a guest who came to visit Xia ruofei. It was the servant’s duty to serve tea to the guest.

“Brother Zhang, let’s sit down and talk!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Okay ...” Zhang Chao took the tea from Luo Qingfeng with some trepidation and then sat down.

“I heard that you’ve already arranged for the evacuation?” Xia ruofei asked kindly.

“The Bay group is too powerful,” Zhang Chao nodded and said,”I’m afraid we’ll suffer a great loss if we fight them head – on, so I’m going to arrange for my brothers to leave the country to avoid the limelight first. We’ll decide whether to come back and develop according to the situation. Maybe we won’t be going back to Mexico anymore! But don’t worry, Mr. Xia, we’ll take care of your goods and help you get them out of Mexico!”
