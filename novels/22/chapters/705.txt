Chapter 706: Super – doping drug (3)

“Yes, I heard that my classmate also booked a hotel near the exam site ...” Lin Qiao said.

The two of them walked into the hotel lobby as they talked.

Hu Zi’s mother carried a large bag and an insulated lunch box. She was sitting on the sofa in the lobby, looking at the door from time to time.

Xia ruofei waved at Hu Zi’s mother and said,””Auntie, over here!”

When Hu Zi’s mother saw Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao, she quickly stood up and walked over with her bag and lunch box.

Xia ruofei hurriedly took two steps forward and took the heavy bag from Hu Zi’s mother.

The group took the elevator and quickly arrived on the 18th floor.

Xia ruofei swiped his card to open the door and inserted the room card into the battery box at the door.””Auntie, I’ll leave the room card here. Remember to take it with you when you go out.”

“Alright,” he said. Hu Zi’s mother looked around and asked,”ruofei, this hotel must be quite expensive, right?”

“It’s at least three to four thousand a day!” Lin Qiao said,”this is a five – Star hotel, and it’s a suite!”

“Ah? It’s so expensive! RUO Fei, this is too costly!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”no, I have to give you the money ...”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”Auntie, please don ‘t!” Qiao’ er is my sister. Do you think I’ll ask for your money to book a hotel room for her? Wouldn’t hu Zi beat me up if he knew about this?”

“This ...”

Xia ruofei continued,”I don’t mean to be wasteful. All the cheap hotels nearby have been booked. This Kempinski Hotel is the last one left. I have no choice.” But this is good, the environment here is very good, and it’s very quiet. Qiao’ er’s rest is more important than anything else. ”

After that, Xia ruofei showed Lin Qiao and Hu Zi’s mother around the room and said,””Auntie, Qiao’ er is the oldest these two days. She’ll sleep in the bedroom at night, and you can sleep on this small bed for the night. The study room here is perfect for Qiao’ er to study, so this room is especially suitable!”

“Ruofei, thank you!” Hu ‘er’s mother said gratefully,”you’re too thoughtful!”

“Aunty, you don’t have to be so polite with me ...” Xia ruofei said,”Oh, you brought lunch, right?” Quickly take it out for Qiao’ er to eat!”

“Yes, yes, yes! I’ve been cooking chicken soup the entire morning!” Hu Zi’s mother hurriedly said,”ruofei, you can eat too. I brought a lot.”

“Alright! Then I’ll be in for a treat too!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Hu Zi’s mother had already eaten at home and was just watching Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao eat.

Xia ruofei gobbled down a big bowl of rice and a big bowl of chicken soup. He wiped his mouth and said,””I’m done eating! Aunty, your cooking skills are really amazing. It’s too delicious!”

“If you like it, then come home more often. Auntie can make it for you every day!” Hu ‘er’s mother said happily.

“Then I’ll go there every day! As long as you don’t find it annoying!”

“I won ‘t, I won’ T. I’m so happy! Why would I be annoyed?”

Lin Qiao was also munching on the chicken and mumbled,””It is! You haven’t been home for more than half a month, and my mom has been talking about you all day ...”

Soon, Lin Qiao also finished her meal. Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Auntie, you and Qiao’ er should rest for a while! I’ll be waiting for Qiao’ er downstairs at half past two. ”

Hu Zi’s mother could not help but ask,”Oh right, ruofei, there’s only one room left in this hotel. Where are you staying?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll make do with the afternoon nap in the car. I’ll go back to the farm at night.” Qiao’ er’s exams start at nineo’ clock, I have plenty of time. ”

“That’s too much trouble ...” Hu Zi’s mother said.”Ruofei, why don’t you go back directly?” It’s so close to the exam site, and it’s only a few minutes walk. I’ll just send Qiao’ er there. ”

“Yes, brother ruofei, you don’t have to pick me up every day!” Lin Qiao said.

Xia ruofei grinned.”It’s fine. It’s just two days. Besides, I’m not tired!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Lin Qiao,””Qiao’ er, have you forgotten? I still have to give you a super stimulant before every exam! How could I not come?”

“Oh, right ...” Lin Qiao said.

“RUO Fei, Qiao’ er, what’s a super – stimulant?” Hu ‘Zi’s mother was confused.

“Mom, don’t worry about it. It’s a little secret between me and brother ruofei!” Lin Qiao said with a smile.

“You ...”

Xia ruofei also smiled and said,”Auntie, I was just joking with Qiao’ er!” It’s actually nothing much. It’s just some Chinese medicine that nourishes the mind and nourishes the brain. I concocted it myself and gave Qiao’ er a can of it before every exam. It’s good for her. ”

“RUO Fei, you’re really thoughtful ...” Hu Zi’s mother said emotionally.

Hu Zi’s mother had never doubted Xia ruofei’s medical skills. He could even use Chinese medicine to cure uremia, so how hard would it be to prescribe him some Chinese medicine that could calm the nerves and nourish the brain?

“Hey! Qiao’ er is my sister, if I don’t care about her, who should I care about?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”aunty, all of you should have a good rest. I’ll go down first!”

With that, Xia ruofei waved at Lin Qiao and Hu Zi’s mother and left the room.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei picked Lin Qiao up from the hotel lobby at 2:30 sharp and drove her to the exam venue.

Before entering the examination hall, Xia ruofei handed Lin Qiao a small half – filled jar of strengthened heart – nourishing soup as usual.

The afternoon exam was mathematics, which was originally Lin Qiao’s weak subject. However, with the help of the enhanced version of the heart – nourishing soup, it seemed that Lin Qiao’s thinking of solving the problems was particularly clear. Lin Qiao could solve several difficult big questions, which was impossible in the past mock exams.

Therefore, Lin Qiao was both surprised and happy after the math exam.

After Xia ruofei sent Lin Qiao back to the hotel, he drove back to the farm.

The next morning, he still brought the enhanced version of the heart – nourishing soup to pick up Lin Qiao.

Today’s exam was comprehensive liberal arts and foreign language.

Lin Qiao’s homework was good to begin with, and with the help of the enhanced version of the heart – nourishing soup, she performed exceptionally well in the arts.

The last foreign language test was in the afternoon.

After Xia ruofei sent Lin Qiao to the examination hall, he sat in a car nearby to rest like yesterday. He waited at the entrance when the examination was almost over.

There were more than ten minutes before the end of the exam. Xia ruofei stood under the shade of a tree and fiddled with his phone, bored.

Just then, two boys in No. 8 high school’s uniform walked out of the exam venue and passed by Xia ruofei. They looked like two candidates who had handed in their papers early.

There were not many people who handed in their papers in advance, so Xia ruofei could not help but take a second look at them.

The two boys were talking as they walked. Although Xia ruofei didn’t mean to eavesdrop, his hearing was better than ordinary people. He could hear their conversation clearly.

After Xia ruofei heard this, he couldn’t help but frown and his face suddenly showed a trace of anger ...
