Chapter 3466: Super genius (2)

Translator: 549690339

The teetering look made Daoist Qing Xuan and immortal mountain river’s hearts clench.

However, they couldn’t help and couldn’t remind Xia ruofei not to waste time on this floor and to just rush up.

The two of them were extremely nervous and excited. Their expressions were also colorful. They did not look like two Almighty cultivators with extremely high cultivation.

As time went by, the amount of Yuan Qi Xia ruofei could mobilize was decreasing.

Even though Xia ruofei was absorbing the pure energy from the crystals at full speed, the consumption was still much greater than the absorption. Hence, the total amount of vital Qi was decreasing very quickly.

Finally, the last bit of vital Qi in the elemental storage Pearl was absorbed by Xia ruofei. There was less than 10% of vital Qi left in his body.

Xia ruofei sighed to himself. Although he still felt that he was not confident, his Yuan Qi reserves did not allow him to continue wasting time on this level.

Hence, Xia ruofei stopped controlling it and activated his vital Qi defense to the maximum. He immediately felt his body relax, but his vital Qi was being consumed at a faster rate.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to waste any time. He took out a spirit Heart Flower petal from the spirit map space and quickly absorbed it into his palm to absorb the medicinal properties.

Some of the injuries on his body began to heal at an extremely fast speed.

Xia ruofei had been paying close attention to the consumption of his vital Qi. After another minute or so, Xia ruofei knew that he could not wait any longer. He had to save some of his vital Qi on the last step. Otherwise, once he stepped on it, he would not have any strength to resist and would be thrown out of the competition.

Therefore, even though he had only recovered half of his injuries, he still took the final step with determination.

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, immortal mountain river and Taoist Qing Xuan heaved a long sigh of relief when they saw that Xia ruofei had finally moved. They felt their bodies relax.

“This kid is finally willing to take this step!” Immortal mountain river said with relief.

Daoist Qing Xuan laughed and said,”I knew it!” This child knew what he was doing! If he was an idiot, how could he have made it to this level!”

Immortal mountain river was showing off again. He slightly raised his chin and said,””That’s right! The disciples of Daoist master mountain river are naturally smart!”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan couldn’t help but curl his lips, but he had nothing to refute. Seeing that other people’s disciples were about to set a dazzling record, what was the point of bragging? If this was his disciple, he would definitely boast even more!

On the Obsidian stairway, Xia ruofei did not hold back at all. He immediately covered his entire body with vital Qi. Naturally, he adjusted the strength of his protection to the maximum and stepped onto the last step.

With a loud “Dong”, Xia ruofei’s left foot landed heavily on the steps. The huge vibration even made his ankle hurt.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. There wasn’t even a trace of pressure on the last step!

This was also the reason why he had taken such a heavy step.

On the previous steps, Xia ruofei felt as if he was living in a thick liquid due to the immense pressure and pressure. Every step he took was met with great resistance.

This was a bit like someone who missed a step and thought that there would be another step next, but it turned out to be flat ground. Then, he must have stomped on it heavily.

Xia ruofei’s situation was similar.

He had taken this step according to his estimation of the pressure. He didn’t expect that the pressure didn’t exist at all. This step was naturally quite heavy, even making his ankle feel pain.

Of course, this was also because the injury to his ankle had not fully recovered. During the process of Huanhuan’s challenge, his ankle had suffered the greatest pressure, so the injury was naturally unavoidable. Just now, he did not have time to wait for the medicinal properties of the spirit Heart Flower petals to be completely absorbed and directly ascended the last step, so it was normal for him to be injured again. Fortunately, there was still a lot of medicinal properties in the petals of the spirit Heart Flower. Once they were all absorbed, his injuries would naturally heal.

Xia ruofei did not expect the Obsidian Stairway to Heaven to be so unpredictable. He had thought that the pressure on the last step would suddenly increase to a point where he could not bear it, including being eliminated on this step. He had been mentally prepared and had done his best to prepare for it. He did not expect that there was no pressure at all on the highest step.

So he was stunned at first, but when he came back to his senses, the first thing he did was to quickly lift his right foot up to see that his right foot was still on the next step, so he was actually still bearing the pressure of going up a step.

When both of Xia ruofei’s legs were on the top of the stairs, he suddenly felt more relaxed than ever.

There was no longer any pressure, and the air was no longer so thick that it seemed to have solidified. The strange force that was constantly stirring the vital Qi had also disappeared without a trace. Only the remaining medicinal properties of the spirit Heart Flower petals continued to heal his injuries, and a cool force flowed through his entire body…

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, Daoist Qing Xuan and immortal mountain river clenched their fists at the same time, and they could no longer hide the joy on their faces.

“Good boy! You’re really good!” Immortal mountain river said as he looked at Xia ruofei in the bronze mirror.

“To be honest, I really envy you!” Daoist priest Qing Xuan said with a complicated expression,”why do you think your luck is so good? I can’t believe I’m able to find such a super genius after leaving a good karma in the cultivation world of the divine land!”

“What do you mean by picked it up?” immortal mountain river glared. RUO Fei and I are destined to be master and disciple. As a cultivator, don’t you know about karma? Forget it, I’m happy today! I can’t be bothered to argue with you

Daoist Qing Xuan smiled bitterly and said,”this kind of karma … I also want it!” Brother mountain river, please teach me!”

Immortal Shanhe was certainly thick – skinned enough, so his expression didn’t change at all. He just started to change the topic and pointed at Xia ruofei in the bronze mirror. He laughed and said,””Daoist Qing Xuan, look at this kid, he’s stunned …”

Daoist Qing Xuan looked at Xia ruofei in the image of the magic treasure and couldn’t help but smile.””This child has been full of wisdom all the way here. It’s my first time seeing such a stunned expression!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“This means that the design of the Obsidian Stairway to Heaven was very successful!” Qing Xuan continued.

Immortal mountain river looked at Qing Xuan and for the first time, he didn’t attack him.

Now that immortal Shanhe’s state of mind was so good, he was amazed at his disciple’s amazing performance. Such a result was enough for him to brag about for a year, while Daoist priest qingxuan was guarding the pass bitterly. What else was there to brag about other than the design of the pass? That’s right, he had also lost the treasure, the cloud heaven Palace. If it wasn’t for the fact that there were guests, he would have cried himself to sleep in the toilet…

On the eighth level of the Tower of Trials, at the top of the Obsidian stairway.

Xia ruofei was indeed a little shocked. He had made too many difficult preparations. The more prepared he was, the more shocked he was at the moment of reaching the top.

He couldn’t help but show a bitter smile on his face. It seemed that the Almighty who designed the Obsidian stairway really didn’t play his cards according to common sense!

However, Xia ruofei did not realize that the difficulty of the Obsidian stairway had long exceeded the capabilities of a golden core cultivator. Even if there was no pressure on the last step, no one would be able to reach this position. Hence, this design was meaningless before today.

Xia ruofei stood at the top of the Obsidian stairway and continued to absorb the remaining medicinal properties of the spirit Heart Flower petals as he slowly turned around to look.

The long heavenly stairs went all the way down. The place he had started from was already very far away, and the stone tablet with the words “Jindan” engraved on it was almost invisible.

After all the difficulties, he had finally reached the top!

Xia ruofei let out a long breath, his heart filled with emotions ….
