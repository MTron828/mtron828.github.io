“Let them in!” Xia ruofei said.

After Xia ruofei hung up, Ling Qingxue asked,””RUO Fei, do you want to go out and receive him? You’re a guest!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what do you mean?” Didn’t you hear what I just said? It’s my Grand – disciple!”

“But he’s still an elder ...” Ling Qingxue said.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no need. If we really go to welcome him, he will definitely be anxious. Let’s just wait in the house!”

Xia ruofei was right about this. If Li Yifu saw that his senior granduncle had come out to welcome him personally, he would probably be terrified beyond words.

After a while, the sound of a car could be heard outside the villa.

However, the car did not drive into the courtyard. Instead, it stopped not far from the entrance. It was a black Mercedes – Benz. For Li Yifu, this car was quite low – Key.

After Li Yifu got out of the car, he stood at the door and pressed the doorbell. He said,””Martial granduncle! This disciple’s adopted husband has taken the liberty to come and visit!”

“Come in,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Although his voice was not loud, it was extremely penetrating, and it was clearly transmitted to Li Yifu’s ears.

“Thank you, grand uncle – Master!” Li Yifu quickly replied.

Then, Li Yifu respectfully pushed open the courtyard door and stepped into the villa’s courtyard with a heart as if he was on a pilgrimage.

This was not an exaggeration at all. In Li Yifu’s heart, Xia ruofei was no doubt as Supreme as a God. This was because Xia ruofei was not only his senior in the sect, but also had a high cultivation at a young age. In addition, he had given Li Yifu a new life.

If any other stranger had walked into the courtyard like this, little black and the others would have rushed up immediately. However, after Li Yifu came in, little Black’s fur stood up, and then it lay on the ground, whimpering.

These dogs that had lived in the spirit map space were more intelligent than ordinary dogs and had sharper senses. Although Li Yifu looked like an old man, he was a cultivator at Qi disciple Level 4. The aura he exuded made Blackie and the others not dare to act rashly.

Li Yifu walked to the front of the villa, and the double door automatically opened. To Xia ruofei, this was a piece of cake.

When Li Yifu saw Xia ruofei standing in the living room, he quickly rushed forward and knelt down without hesitation.””This disciple pays his respects to martial granduncle!”

Ling Qingxue, who was at the side, was already dumbfounded.

Although Xia ruofei had already warned her, she was still shocked to see an old man with white hair and a white beard being so respectful to Xia ruofei.

People in the modern era rarely knelt down to pay their respects. However, Li Yifu knelt down without any hesitation. He looked very natural, which made Ling Qingxue feel that it was a little out of place.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”get up!” Today is the first time we’ve met since you returned to the country. Don’t kneel down so easily in the future!”

“Thank you, grand uncle – Master!” Li Yifu stood up and said,”yes, your disciple!”

Then, Li Yifu finally dared to look at Xia ruofei. Of course, he still had his head lowered.

Li Yifu’s entire body trembled as he glanced at her. He asked in a trembling voice,””Martial granduncle! You ... You ... You broke through again?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei nodded slightly.”Yes, I had some enlightenment a while ago. Now, I’ve already reached Qi disciple Level 6.”

Although the breakthrough this time could not be separated from the accumulation of continuous cultivation in the early stages, the change from quantitative to qualitative was only completed when he cultivated with Song Wei in that charming situation. Now, in front of Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei felt a little unnatural, so he did not want to say more.

Li Yifu’s heart was already in a state of shock. He was already halfway into the grave. If it wasn’t for Xia ruofei’s advice in Australia, he might still be stuck at Qi disciple Level 3! On the other hand, Xia ruofei was only in his early 20s and had already reached Qi disciple Level 5. How long had it been since they last met? He had actually broken through another level.

Why was there such a huge difference between people? Li Yifu couldn’t help sighing in his heart. He had to admit that geniuses really existed in this world, and a cultivator with mediocre qualifications like him simply couldn’t understand the world of geniuses.

Xia ruofei glanced at Li Yifu and smiled.””Foster husband, your cultivation has also improved a lot during this time! Not bad, not bad!”

Li Yifu’s current cultivation level had already reached the middle stage of Qi disciple Level 4. It seemed that he had not slacked off in his cultivation during this period of time.

Of course, this was also very normal. The older a person was, the more he would treasure his life. Especially Li Yifu, who was originally struggling hard in his cultivation. Now that he saw the light of hope, he was naturally full of motivation to cultivate.

Li Yifu quickly replied respectfully,”it’s all thanks to senior granduncle!” The spirit – gathering Jade sculpture that martial uncle Tang rewarded me also helped a lot. Otherwise, my cultivation wouldn’t have advanced so quickly with my poor aptitude!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. Then he said,””By the way, let me introduce you to my girlfriend, Ling Qingxue!”

Li Yifu had actually noticed Ling Qingxue’s presence long ago, but Xia ruofei had not introduced her to him, so he did not dare to ask.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he quickly bowed and greeted respectfully,””Hello, martial grandmother!”

Ling Qingxue was so scared that she quickly dodged to the side and said,””Don ‘t, don’ t, don’t ... You’re already so old, I can’t afford to be called that! Besides ... I’m not even married to ruofei yet!”
