2167 Leaving_1

David, who was obviously the weakest, quickly said,””I’ll remember! Boss Puyol, don’t worry! I’ll take good care of John Junior ...”

Xia ruofei stood at the entrance of the cave and said with a smile,””Our workplace is on the beach not far ahead. If there’s anything, just shout and we’ll hear it. Don’t worry about Puyol!”

Puyol rubbed his hands and laughed drily,””Yes! Daoist immortal! Then let’s go!”

The other survivors quickly took all their tools and followed Puyol out of the cave.

When Puyol and the others arrived at the entrance of the cave, they immediately saw dozens of huge logs of wood and a large pile of old vines on the beach not far away. All of them were so surprised that they couldn’t speak. If they were asked to prepare so much wood, it would probably take them more than half a month. After all, it was already very difficult to cut down trees with primitive tools, and such heavy logs had to be transported out of the forest. It would be considered good if they could finish one log a day.

In the eyes of Puyol and the others, Xia ruofei was definitely a God if he could prepare so many wooden materials and rattans in one night.

“Great divine immortal, this ...” Puyol was dumbfounded.”Did you prepare all this by yourself?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Yup! It’s too inefficient for you to cut wood on your own. I’m in a hurry ...”

Puyol couldn’t help but sweat. They had been trapped on this deserted island for so many years and couldn’t leave even if they wanted to. As long as they could leave this place, even if there was only a little hope, it didn’t matter if they had to wait a few more days!

But this Daoist immortal clearly didn’t think so.

“Don’t just stand there, hurry up and get to work!”Xia ruofei said.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Puyol quickly said.

The group of people followed Xia ruofei to the beach and started to work with great enthusiasm.

The only requirement for them to build the raft was that it was strong enough. They had no pursuit for beauty or comfort, so they didn’t even peel off the bark. Puyol and the other two were busy cutting off all the branches of the wood, then saw off the thinner parts at the top, cutting out about ten meters of wood.

After that, he chiseled a few circles of grooves on the wood, and then wrapped the old vines around these grooves. He tied the wood side by side tightly, and the prototype of the wooden raft was out.

Of course, as the tools that Puyol and the others used were relatively simple, these tasks took them an entire day. This was the result of Xia ruofei’s help. Otherwise, they might not have been able to finish it in two or three days.

With Xia ruofei’s participation, the construction of the raft sped up greatly, especially when it came to tying the rattan. Puyol’s strength was still passable, and the other two survivors could not tie the rattan as tightly as they could. However, Xia ruofei easily tied the rattan tightly with one hand.

After a day’s work, Puyol and the others were exhausted.

As usual, Xia ruofei did not stay in the cave with them. Instead, he returned to the boundary of the array and entered the spirit map space to rest.

The next day, Xia ruofei brought Puyol and the rest to modify the raft. For example, they installed a simple mast so that it could be leveled when it was not in use. Then, the other two survivors used some old cloth found in the camp to sew a triangular sail.

In addition, Xia ruofei had gotten Puyol and the rest to nail a simple deck on the raft with the branches they had cut off.

After all, the raft would get wet after going into the sea. There was a platform for them to place their supplies, and because they had to take a baby with them, it would be much better to set up a tent on the platform when the sea was rough.

After another day of work, the wooden raft was basically completed.

Pyol took the survivors to the ruins of the camp where they had lived for several years and dug out everything that might be useful after going out to sea. In addition, they also went to the water source to get a large amount of fresh water. All the containers that could be used were used. They placed all these things on the raft and used thin vines to secure them.

This wooden raft had more than a dozen logs lined up side by side, about five to six meters wide and ten meters long, which was relatively spacious.

On the simple deck, the supplies were stacked in a triangular shape. The concave part in the middle was Xia ruofei’s single tent, which John Junior could stay in.

After a day’s preparation, Xia ruofei decided to go out to sea the next morning.

He told Puyol and the survivors to have a good rest tonight, while he returned to the array barrier to rest as usual. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The next day, Xia ruofei left the boundary of the array at dawn and came to the beach.

Puyol and the others were so excited that they didn’t sleep for the entire night. They had been looking around at the entrance of the cave since early in the morning.

When they saw Xia ruofei, they quickly walked out.

All the things they needed to bring were carried onto the raft yesterday. Puyol carried John Junior in his arms, and the remaining three survivors followed closely behind. They almost ran all the way to the beach.

Puyol and the rest came to Xia ruofei, their eyes full of anticipation.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”is everything ready?” Then let’s go!”

“Yes!” Puyol said with a trembling voice.

He handed John to David, the thinnest survivor, and then took the other two survivors to the back of the raft.

Yesterday, they had already cut down some branches as thick as fists and laid them under the raft all the way to the sea.
