Chapter 96: Magical healing effect (1)

After settling Huan Huan in the bedroom, Tian Huixin went downstairs to prepare lunch with Tian Huilan. Meanwhile, Ma Zhiming accompanied professor Tian as he made tea and chatted with Xia ruofei. Lu You didn’t stay in the living room either. She went to the kitchen to chat with her youngest aunt, Tian Huixin, who she hadn’t seen in a long time, and then ran upstairs to see Huanhuan. Very quickly, the Tian sisters had prepared lunch. Huan Huan was still sleeping, so everyone went to the dining room to eat. This was the second time that Xia ruofei had the privilege of being personally cooked by the Secretary. He was much calmer than the first time. During lunch, professor Tian and Ma Zhiming frequently toasted Xia ruofei, especially professor Tian. His daughter and son – in – Law had returned from Hong Kong, and his granddaughter’s autism had always been stone – cold, so he was especially happy to see a glimmer of hope. There were very few things that soldiers could not drink. Xia ruofei had been in the Army for a few years. From being drunk from a bottle of beer when he first joined the Army, he could drink two catties of white wine by the time he retired. Therefore, he did not reject anyone. Among the three men, he drank the most, but he was the most sober. Even the Tian sisters, Tian Huilan and Tian Huixin, gave Xia ruofei a toast. Naturally, everyone was full of praise for the peach Garden vegetables that Xia ruofei had brought, especially the taste of the carp. Even a young master from a wealthy family like Ma Zhiming could not help but praise it. Although Lu You was eating quietly, it was rare that she did not glare at Xia ruofei and go head to head with him. There were a few times when she couldn’t help but secretly look at Xia ruofei. However, when Xia ruofei looked over, she quickly looked away. After the meal, Xia ruofei chatted with professor Tian and the others for a while and told them about the precautions for taking the rest of the herbal soup. He thought that the family had finally reunited after a long time and it would be inappropriate to disturb them. He got up and was ready to leave. At this moment, footsteps could be heard coming from the stairs. Everyone looked up. It turned out that little Huanhuan had already woken up and had gotten up to go downstairs. Tian Huixin quickly stood up and went over to welcome her. However, before she could hug Huanhuan, Huanhuan nimbly twisted under her arms and ran directly to Xia ruofei. Her big, watery eyes sized Xia ruofei up with curiosity and shyness. Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He could clearly feel that Huanhuan’s eyes were different from that in the morning. There seemed to be a hint of liveliness in them. Xia ruofei knew that the petal solution was probably working. He was secretly happy. It seemed that his guess was right. Although autism showed social and language barriers, it was still a problem with the development of the nervous system. As long as it was a physical problem, the petal solution had almost no flaws. It had been tried and tested. Xia ruofei’s face revealed a kind smile as he squatted down and looked at Huanhuan. Sure enough, although Huanhuan subconsciously avoided his gaze, she still maintained eye contact with him for a second or two. Tian Huixin and the others also walked over. Tian Huixin, in particular, was very sensitive to this scene. She couldn’t help but cover her mouth with her hands, her eyes filled with tears. Xia ruofei gently held little Huanhuan’s toot little hand and said with a smile,””Huanhuan, call me uncle!” Huan Huan hesitated for a moment. Xia ruofei looked at her encouragingly and said,””Call me uncle!” Huan Huan slowly opened her mouth and said with some difficulty,”Phew ... Phew ...” Tian Huixin suddenly burst into tears, and even Ma Zhiming’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red. Huan Huan was almost five years old, but this was the first time she had truly “spoken” since she was born. Although she could speak before, it was all meaningless syllables. This time, although his pronunciation was still unclear, it was very obvious that he was responding to Xia ruofei’s request and was trying hard to say the word “uncle.” The fire of hope was burning in the hearts of Ma Zhiming and his wife. Such an obvious improvement was like crossing a huge threshold. The two of them understood Huanhuan’s situation the best. They were sure that Xia ruofei’s Chinese medicine had a decisive effect. Although it sounded like a fantasy that a single dose of medicine had such an effect, the two of them believed it without a doubt. Xia ruofei gave Huanhuan a thumbs up and encouraged her,””Huanhuan, you’re awesome!” Then, Xia ruofei held Huan Huan’s shoulders and turned her to Tian Huixin. He pointed at Tian Huixin and said to Huan Huan,””Huanhuan, call mommy!” Tian Huixin gently bit her lower lip and looked at her daughter very nervously. She felt that her heart was about to jump out of her chest. What made her feel gratified was that Huanhuan’s eyes met with hers, and there was an obvious sense of intimacy. The next moment, Huanhuan finally opened her mouth,””Mom ... Mom ...” Tian Huixin’s tears rolled down her face as she hugged Huan Huan tightly in her arms. Her body trembled uncontrollably as she sobbed,””My good daughter ... Mommy has been waiting for this day ...” Ma Zhiming couldn’t help but go forward and hug his wife and daughter. His eyes were also filled with tears. Only Huan Huan still had a confused expression on her face. She didn’t understand why her parents were so excited. Tian Huilan’s eyes were also wet. She gently wiped her tears and said to Xia ruofei,””Xiao Xia, thank you so much!” “Xia, you’ve helped our family so much, thank you ...” Professor Tian said excitedly. Lu You looked at Xia ruofei, and a strange light flashed in her eyes. She opened her mouth, but in the end, she didn’t say anything. She walked over and consoled little aunt in a soft voice. Xia ruofei waited for them to calm down before he said,””Mr. MA, Ms. Tian, it seems that my prescription is right. I believe that Huanhuan’s condition should be greatly improved after the treatment. However, she still has to start learning the language from the beginning. She’s only four years old now, so it shouldn’t be too late!” “I know ... I know ...” Tian Huixin said excitedly.”The doctor said that if the problem with the nervous system can be solved, the problem of social disorder will naturally not exist, and the ability to speak can also be restored very quickly ...” The language barrier of people with autism was mainly due to problems with their nervous system, resulting in a lack of learning and understanding ability in this area. Once the root of the problem with the nervous system was solved, they only needed to learn to speak like normal children, which was not a very difficult thing to do. Ma Zhiming was also very excited,”Xia Sheng, you’re really a Divine Doctor!” You’ve saved Huanhuan’s fate and also saved our family. Thank you! Thank you!” “Mr. MA, you’re welcome.” Xia ruofei smiled. Whether my prescription is effective or not, we’ll only know after the entire course of treatment. ” “It’ll definitely be effective! It’ll definitely be effective!” Ma Zhiming said,”I’ve only taken one dose of the medicine, and the effect is immediate. If I take ten doses of medicine in a row, the effect will definitely be more obvious!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I hope so too!” Huanhuan is so cute. She should have a happy childhood like a normal child and not be immersed in her own lonely world. ” “By the way, Mr. MA, please keep my treatment of Huanhuan a secret.” Xia ruofei said,”firstly, the medicine has not been tested. Secondly, I’m not qualified to practice medicine. Besides, I like peace and quiet. If word gets out that a bunch of patients are coming to my door, I really don’t know how to deal with them ...” “Okay, okay. Don’t worry, we won’t tell anyone.” Ma Zhiming answered. Now, whatever Xia ruofei said was treated as a golden rule. Naturally, he would not go against it. “Okay, then I’ll take my leave first.” Xia ruofei said,”you can call me anytime to let me know about Huanhuan’s situation.” If the effect is good, I’ll prepare the medicine for the second course of treatment. After three courses, it should be almost done. ” Three courses of treatment were basically the amount of a whole petal of the wondrous flower. Unless it was a particularly serious illness, it would definitely be cured. Just as Fang Yang was about to walk out of the door, Lu You suddenly called out to him,” “Xia ruofei, wait a minute ...” [PS] yay! The China Women’s team won! Did everyone watch the Olympic final? It was truly stirring the Qi and returning to the bowels!
