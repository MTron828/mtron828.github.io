Chapter 1300: Chapter 782 – bottom – hunting success (3)

Translator: 549690339

The current situation of bojun real estate was a reflection of its internal and external difficulties.

Seeing Xu Jiahui’s dejected look, Xia ruofei patted his forehead and said,””Boss Xu, it’s all my fault for digressing ... Let’s not care about that. Bojun real estate is such a big corporation, I don’t have to worry about its funding. Let’s get back to the main topic of the negotiation!”

Xu Jiahui forced a smile and said,”okay ... President Xia, I won’t beat around the bush. Before I left, I specifically called President Zhou to ask for instructions. 370 million is really our bottom line. If you are still not satisfied, I have another plan on my side ...”

“Oh? Please speak, boss Xu!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“The cash Payment can be adjusted to 350 million.” Xu Jiahui said,”for the remaining 20 million, we hope that your company will use shares to pay for it. Just 2% of the shares of paradise Corporation will do!”

20 million Yuan for 2% of the shares was the valuation of paradise Corporation at 1 billion Yuan. Xu Jiahui thought that Xia ruofei would most likely accept this proposal.

He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to say,””This is impossible! I can’t sell the company’s shares now and at any time in the future!”

Xia ruofei would not sell his shares even if it was 100 million, let alone 20 million.

Besides, it was not that Xia ruofei could not pay with 370 million in cash. It was just that he would be letting himself down if he did not lower the price as much as possible at this time. So, how could he accept the plan to transfer the shares?

“This ...” Xu Jiahui frowned slightly and said with embarrassment.

Xia ruofei said straightforwardly,”boss Xu, I don’t want to beat around the bush. In short, 350 million in cash is my final offer.” Boss Xu Can think about it, and you can also ask your boss Zhou for further instructions. If it’s acceptable, we can sign the agreement today. If not, then there’s no need to continue the discussion, because no matter how many rounds of discussion, I won’t be able to offer a single cent more!”

Xia ruofei immediately blocked the way out.

He stood up and said,”boss Xu, I’m sorry. I still have a lot of things to deal with. I’ll take my leave first. You can take your time to think about it ...”

With that, Xia ruofei strode out of the conference room. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Wait!” Xu Jiahui hesitated for a while and then quickly said,”director Xia, we want to receive the transaction payment within a week after the agreement is signed!”

Feng Rao, Xiao Qiang, pang Hao, and the others quickly looked at each other, revealing an extremely surprised expression.

It was an unbelievable surprise to get it at a low price of 350 million.

Xia ruofei seemed to have expected it. He reached out his hand to Xu Jiahui across the conference table and said with a smile,””Happy cooperation!”

......

The legal work of both parties was very efficient. In a short time, the transfer contract was drafted. After both parties confirmed that there were no mistakes, they signed their names.

Xu Jiahui came prepared and even brought the company seal. The seal of paradise Corporation was naturally more convenient.

The contract would come into effect after the signature and stamp.

From now on, the balance power building could be changed to the Paradise building at any time.

When everyone shook hands, Xu Jiahui said with a bitter smile,””I hope that I will never meet a negotiator like President Xia again in my life ...”

Director Zhou had already authorized him to accept 350 million Yuan.

However, this was his bottom line. In fact, the market value of this asset was definitely more than 400 million. Before coming, Xu Jiahui’s bottom line was 360 or 370 million. He did not expect Xia ruofei to be more difficult to deal with than he had imagined. In the end, he made the deal with general manager Zhou’s bottom line.

In other words, in this negotiation, his KPI was almost below the passing line, and he might even leave the impression that he was not capable enough.

If that was the case, it would be too unjust. No matter who was in charge of the negotiation, Xu Jiahui felt that the result would not be any better than this.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”boss Xu, you’re too serious!” I’ve already asked the canteen to prepare some food and wine. After signing the agreement, I’ll invite everyone to try our Taoyuan vegetables!”

Then, Xia ruofei turned around and asked,”Liu Qian, have you prepared the tea leaves for boss Xu and the rest?” Don’t forget to put it in the car!”

“Yes, Chairman!” Liu Qian quickly replied.

Xu Jiahui saw Xia ruofei’s enthusiasm after signing the contract and could not help but smile bitterly. Fortunately, he had completed his task successfully and he was slightly relieved.

The dinner was less hostile than the negotiation table, and the guests and the host were happy.

After sending Xu Jiahui and the others to the car and leaving, Feng Jing asked,””Chairman, it’s 350 million! And you’ll have to pay in a week. Have you thought about where to find the money?”
