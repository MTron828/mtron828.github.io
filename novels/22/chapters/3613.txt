“You’re too kind,” doctor Qi quickly said.”It’s my honor to be of service to you!”

In the intensive care unit’s duty room, it was still Dr. Karim’s shift. He had to stay there until eighto’ clock the next morning before his colleague would come to change shifts.

Dr. Karim and Dr. Kevin Qiao were sitting in the duty room with the surveillance screen in front of them. The surveillance screen in Liang Qichao’s ward was still full of snowflakes and stripes.

When the screen flickered a few times and became clear again, doctor Karim immediately said,””Dr. Qiao, Mr. Xia has already come out, I’m sure!”

Kevin got up and took a look, and found that it was indeed the case. He quickly greeted doctor Karim and quickly walked out to greet him.

Doctor Karim sat in the duty room and muttered,””Mysterious Eastern magic

“Mr. Xia!” Qiao Kaiwen stepped forward and asked,”how’s Mr. Liang’s condition?”

“He’s already asleep,” Wang Yao said.”His condition is stable for the time being. It shouldn’t be a problem to transfer him to another hospital tomorrow.” Xia ruofei said,”doctor Qiao, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go back first. You’ve worked hard these past two days. Go back and rest early!”

“Alright!” Kevin Qiao said,”then we’ll see you tomorrow morning!”

Kevin Qiao’s team took turns on duty in the hospital. Today, Kevin Qiao was in charge of the duty. Even if he was resting, he could only sleep in the doctor’s lounge next to the intensive care unit area. He had to ensure that the doctor on duty could find him as soon as something happened to the patient.

Kevin Qiao walked Xia ruofei to the first floor and waved goodbye to her.

Xia ruofei got into Tang Yitian’s Rolls – Royce and went back to the manor.

As for the driver and bodyguard who had sent him over in the afternoon, Xia ruofei had already called them to Return to Paradise Farm.

At the same time, Xia ruofei called Daphne and briefly told her about Liang Qichao’s situation. He also told her that he would transfer Liang Qichao to another hospital tomorrow.

After returning to the manor, Xia ruofei greeted Tang Yitian and his wife and went to rest in the guest room that they had prepared.

The next morning, Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian left for Saint Saint Vincent Hospital.

At the entrance of the hospital, a Chinese man in a suit and leather shoes was already waiting there in advance. This Chinese man was in his early forties, wearing a pair of gold – rimmed glasses, and his hair was neatly combed. One look and you could tell he was an elite.

When he saw the Rolls – Royce limousine, he immediately came up to greet Tang Yitian. As soon as Tang Yitian got out of the car, he immediately bowed and greeted,””Hello, Mr. Tang!”

“Doctor Qi, I’ll have to trouble you this time.” Tang Yitian smiled and nodded.

It turned out that this was Tang Yitian’s private doctor and the owner of the high – end private clinic that provided the treatment venue.

“You’re too kind,” doctor Qi quickly said.”lt’s my honor to be of service to you!”
