Translator: 549690339

Hou Liang couldn’t help but be stunned when he heard this. Brother Jun is treating Wei Jun to tea? What did this kid do?

“Big brother Jun, just tell us if there’s anything you need, Wei Jun wouldn’t dare to be slow!” Or I can ask him to come to you immediately ...” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Why are you talking so much nonsense?” Zhao Yongjun laughed,”it’s settled then! By the way, you should come along too!”

“Alright! I’ll inform him immediately!” Hou Liang could only say helplessly.

After ending the call with Zhao Yongjun, Hou Liang didn’t dare to delay and quickly called Wei Jun.

“Liang bro!” Wei Jun called out respectfully.

In fact, Hou Liang was younger than Wei Jun by a year, but Wei Jun could call him “brother Liang” quite smoothly, without any psychological burden at all. It was because Hou Liang’s father was more awesome. Moreover, Hou Liang had a reputation in the circle and was a thousand times better than an outsider like him. He was also very willing to call him brother.

“Wei Jun, where are you?” Hou Liang asked.

“Liang bro, I’m just about to go play Go – Kart in the western suburbs!” Wei Jun quickly said,”there’s a new car park there. The conditions are quite good! Liang bro, do you want to come over and play?”

“Don’t go, turn back immediately!” “Yes.” Hou Liang said,”I have an important matter here!”

“Alright!” Wei Jun said without hesitation, then carefully asked,”Liang bro, can you tell me what it is?”

Hou Liang was also somewhat puzzled. He said,””I can’t explain it clearly over the phone, but it should be a good thing for you. Come back soon! It shouldn’t be a problem to get to auspicious fortune store in front of the gate within half an hour, right?”

“No problem, no problem!” Wei Jun quickly said,”I haven’t left the city yet! There’s no traffic jam now!”

“Alright, I’ll wait for you at the entrance!” Hou Liang said.

Half an hour later, Wei Jun arrived at auspicious fortune store in a hurry. Seeing that Hou Liang was already standing at the door, he hastened his steps and said,”Liang bro, I’m so sorry! I even asked you to wait for me here!”

Hou Liang waved his hand nonchalantly and said,”Come in with me!”

“Alright!” Wei Jun followed closely behind him and asked carefully,”Liang bro, what are your orders? Tell me about it first!”

“To be honest, I don’t know what’s going on either. It’s brother Jun who’s looking for you today, so be careful of what you say later!” Hou Liang said.

Wei Jun trembled in fear and said in a trembling voice,””Jun bro? It’s ... It’s Zhao Yongjun, brother Jun?”

He really couldn’t believe it, so he couldn’t help but ask.

“Other than him, who else can make me call him brother Jun?” Hou Liang looked at Wei Jun and said,”but you don’t have to worry. It shouldn’t be a bad thing. If Jun bro has something for you to do, you have to do your best. This is a good opportunity for you!”

“Understood!” Wei Jun quickly replied. Understood! Thanks for the reminder, Liang bro!”

He was just worried that he wouldn’t have the chance to enter Zhao Yong Jun’s circle! Today Zhao Yongjun took the initiative to ask him to do something, this was a once in a thousand years opportunity! Thus, Wei Jun couldn’t help but feel excited.

Of course, he also secretly made up his mind. No matter how difficult the task Zhao Yongjun asked him to do, he would do everything he could to complete it, and he would do it beautifully!

Very quickly, Hou Liang brought Wei Jun, who was unable to suppress his excitement, to a small room. Hou Liang gently knocked on the door and called out,”Big brother Jun!”

Wei Jun’s heart thumped. He heard a steady voice coming from the room,””Come in!”
