2016 The stormy seas (3)

After his subordinates analyzed it for a while, Lu zhengfeng also felt that it was quite interesting. Although he still did not think that this plan had the possibility of being implemented, it was quite good to occasionally deduce it and have some fun. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Seeing lui hai coming in, LV zhengfeng stood up immediately,Big brother hai, what did adopted uncle say Do we still have to carry out this plan

If Li Yifu agreed to persuade Xia ruofei to give up on the plan, then everything they were doing now would be in vain.

Lyu hai glanced at Lyu zhengfeng,Uncle Yi only said eight words,I’ll do my best to fulfill all your requests!

What Lu zhengfeng cried out involuntarily. Are we really going to do as Mr. Xia said Don’t tell me uncle Yi also ...

Li Yifu’s prestige was too high. Even though he was not by their side, Lu zhengfeng still did not dare to say anything disrespectful.

Even so, lui hai still glared at lui zhengfeng,Zhengfeng! You’ve got guts, huh You actually dare to speak ill of uncle Yi behind my back!

I didn ‘t! Big brother hai, don’t you slander me! Everyone can be my witness! Lu zhengfeng quickly said.

Lui hai pouted,Okay, okay! Let’s not talk about this! He had to hurry up and draw up a plan! I’ll work overtime with you tonight. We must come up with the most efficient plan with the highest success rate and the least loss!

Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t. You should go rest! Lu zhengfeng quickly said,we can handle this! I guarantee that Mr. Xia will be satisfied with the plan!

Lui hai glared at lui zhengfeng,You think I’m joking We’ll work on the plan together, and I’ll check for you! Also, inform the brothers to start preparing tomorrow. We must be ready to be pulled out at any time!

Lu zhengfeng was dumbfounded as he looked at his cousin’s meaning. He was going to mess around with that Mr. Xia! What had he experienced when he went out to make this phone call Why did his attitude suddenly change 180 degrees

......

The next morning, when Xia ruofei saw lui hai and the others, they all had huge dark circles under their eyes and their eyes were bloodshot.

Lui hai, Lu zhengfeng, and the others stayed up all night.

Lyu hai was not familiar with the specific situation of the Gelman family, so he asked Lyu zhengfeng to explain it in detail at the beginning. After that, they all worked together to figure out what to do to maximize the impact.

The result of an all – nighter was a thick book of plans.

Xia ruofei quickly flipped through the pages and nodded in his heart. Obviously, lui hai and his team had put in a lot of effort. The first part was the basic information about the Gehrman family, written in detail. It seemed that the intelligence work of the Hong sect was really good. The middle part was the suggestions on the main targets, attack routes, order, and the arrangement of the existing forces. At the end, a list of the core members of the Gelman family was attached.

This list was not just a name. There were photos, resumes, personality analysis, lifestyle habits, and so on.

At the same time, the list was also arranged according to their importance. It could be said to be clear at a glance.

After Xia ruofei finished reading, he said with satisfaction,Very good! Ah hai, I can tell that you’ve put in a lot of effort! You’ve worked hard!

You’re welcome! You’re welcome! Lui hai said hurriedly with a more humble attitude than yesterday,Mr. Xia, what do you think ... Of this plan

Xia ruofei nodded and said,it’s done very carefully. Not bad! However ... I have a few suggestions for some changes!

Please speak! Lui hai said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei picked up the red and blue pencil on the table and circled the last part. Then, he used the arrow to point at the first part of the plan.

Facing the confused looks of lui hai, lui zhengfeng, and the others, Xia ruofei smiled,My opinion is to move the part of attacking the core members of the Gelman family to the front! After we clear the area, I’m sure the Gelman family will be in a mess. That way, it’ll be much easier for us to carry out our other plans!
