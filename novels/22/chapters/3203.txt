In order to control the scope of information, the disciples of the few sects were not aware of their mission in the capital, including Luo Qingfeng and Wang Shan of the star Seizer sect.

Of course, as the sect master of the first heaven society, Chen Nanfeng naturally knew about it.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not explain the situation clearly. He only told them to listen to a song.

Everyone had received instructions from their sect leader to follow Xia ruofei’s orders after they arrived in the capital. They were to do whatever he told them to do and were not allowed to ask any questions. Hence, everyone nodded and no one asked about the purpose of this.

Xia ruofei looked at Chen Xuan, Yu Xin ‘er, mu Jianfei and the others who were sitting on the outer side of the crowd. They were all like Xia ruofei, they had entered a wonderful dream after listening to the music. This time, their mission was to observe everyone’s reaction when they heard the song.

Of course, Xia ruofei and the rest would ask about everyone’s feelings after listening to the song. However, they could not rule out the possibility that some people would not tell the truth. Hence, it was necessary to let these people, who had personally experienced the wonderful experience, observe from the side.

Chen Xuan and the rest nodded at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei then walked into the screening room and started playing the song.

While the song was playing, Xia ruofei walked out of the screening room and observed the reactions of Chen Nanfeng and the others.

According to his experience, if the song was effective, it would pull people into the wonderful situation as soon as the first note was played.

Hence, after Xia ruofei looked around, he had a rough idea of who could react to the song and who could not.

Xia ruofei was mesmerized by the beautiful music while observing the cultivators who were listening to it for the first time.

As long as one entered that wondrous state once, listening to this song again would not have any effect.

He had only experienced that once.

Before he knew it, a song had finished playing.

Xia ruofei walked into the screening room, closed the music arrangement software, and then walked out of the room. The first thing he did was to cast a questioning look at Chen Nanfeng.

Chen Nanfeng revealed a bitter smile and shook his head.

Xia ruofei nodded to himself. In fact, he had already gotten the answer. It seemed that Chen Nanfeng was honest and did not lie about this matter.

Of all the people who were listening to this song for the first time, only Chen Nanfeng knew. If he wanted to pretend that he had entered that wonderful situation, he would definitely be able to tell it flawlessly.

However, Xia ruofei also paid attention to Chen Nanfeng as he played the song. He could tell that although Chen Nanfeng was listening very seriously, he had not entered the wonderful experience.

Initially, Xia ruofei was a little worried that Chen Nanfeng would force himself to say that he had a reaction to this song! If that was the case, they actually had no other choice.

In the world of cultivation, the fist was the law. Chen Nanfeng was basically unrivaled in the cultivation world on earth if the reclusive experts were not taken into account.

If the number one expert in the world of cultivation were to act shamelessly, no one would be able to do anything to him.

Fortunately, Chen Nanfeng’s character was not bad, or he had other considerations, so he did not play any tricks on this matter.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”now that everyone has heard it, we will follow our arrangements. Everyone will first report to their respective sect leaders in their respective sects. I will summarize the situation later!”

This was also arranged in advance. The various sects would first understand the situation themselves, and then everyone would analyze it together.

Even the venues of the various sects had been arranged. There were only a few relatively spacious guest rooms. Xia ruofei had even set up a sound – proof barrier for them.

So, after Xia ruofei finished, he said directly,””Sect leader Luo, Wang Shan, come with me!”

With that, Xia ruofei walked out of the studio and led Qingfeng Luo and Wang Shan to the living room of his own master suite.

After closing the door, Xia ruofei asked directly,””After listening to the song, did the two of you have any different experiences or feelings?”

Luo Qingfeng and Wang Shan were slightly stunned, and then they shook their heads at the same time.

Luo Qingfeng asked with a puzzled expression,””Great elder, this tune is quite nice. I’ve never heard such a melody before, but that’s all!”

As Wang Shan was present, Luo Qingfeng could not address Xia ruofei as “master”. It was not disrespectful to address him with the honorary title of great elder, but it would also not make him seem too flattering as the sect leader. It was obviously the most appropriate form of address. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Xia ruofei already knew the result through observation, but he still held on to a glimmer of hope. After seeing the feedback from Luo Qingfeng and Wang Shan, Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

“It’s nothing,” he said.”Since you don’t have any other reaction, it means that you’re not fated to play this song. This matter ends here, so don’t ask anymore. ”

Luo Qingfeng and Wang Shan nodded at the same time. Xia ruofei continued,””I’ll have to trouble Royal Mountain to stay behind and help me receive these cultivators for the next two days! Sect leader Luo, if you have something to do at the sect, you can go back first. ”

“The entire sect has been relatively stable recently,” Luo Qingfeng said with a smile.”I’m not in a hurry to go back. Why don’t I stay and help?”
