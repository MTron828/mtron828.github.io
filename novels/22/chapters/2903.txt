2904 Receiving the military arms (1) Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The two of them regulated their breathing for a while. Suddenly, a few muffled explosions came from the North.

Although the two yachts were more than ten kilometers apart, for early – Stage golden core cultivators like Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng, they could still clearly hear the explosion ten kilometers away. They could even feel the weak fluctuations caused by the shock wave after the explosion.

Luo Qingfeng suddenly opened his eyes. Xia ruofei also stopped cultivating and spread his spiritual power to the North.

Qingfeng Luo’s spiritual power could not cover such a long distance, so he did not know what had happened. He asked respectfully,””Master, do you want this old servant to go and investigate?”

Xia ruofei had already investigated Charlie’s situation. He smiled and waved his hand.”No need! What’s happening over there has nothing to do with us. You can continue to adjust your breathing!”

Charlie’s pure gold name card was still in the spirit map space, but Xia ruofei felt that he would not have much contact with Charlie in the future. To him, this was just a chance encounter. Since they had met, it meant that they were fated, so he decided to help him out.

“Master,” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”I’ve recovered most of my vital Qi. I can set off at any time.”

In fact, Xia ruofei had almost fully recovered. The remaining half of the journey could basically lead them to their destination.

Since Luo Qingfeng had said that he had almost recovered, Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Alright then! Let’s continue our journey!”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said.

Then, he immediately summoned his flying sword, leaped onto it, and rode it to the outside of the yacht.

As Xia ruofei was still on the yacht, Luo Qingfeng did not dare to fly too high. It would be disrespectful to the master. He controlled the flying sword and floated close to the sea.

Xia ruofei also took out the blue immortal sword and flew up.

Then, Luo Qingfeng saw Xia ruofei wave his hand and the ten – meter – long yacht disappeared into thin air. It was obvious that Xia ruofei had stored it in his storage treasure.

Not only did this mean that Xia ruofei’s storage treasure was big enough, but it also showed that Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was very strong. Using the storage treasure to store items was the same as using the spirit map space. The size and heavier the item, the more spiritual power was required. Xia ruofei could store such a big yacht with ease, so his spiritual power was obviously strong.

In fact, if it was an ordinary person, even if they had a top – notch storage ring, it would be useless because they could not use it at all. Ordinary people’s spiritual power had not been trained. Only a few people were born with strong spiritual power, and most people were very weak. Even those who were born with strong spiritual power did not know how to use it. At most, they would show some extraordinary abilities, such as people with various special abilities. Most of them were people who were born with stronger spiritual power than ordinary people.

After Xia ruofei kept the yacht, he called out to Luo Qingfeng. The two of them continued to fly on their flying swords towards the northeast direction of the American continent.

……

On the other side, after calling for help through the satellite phone, Charlie Koch patiently waited for rescue on the lifeboat.

The lifeboat that the yacht was equipped with was extremely advanced. It could send out location information 24 hours a day. Furthermore, it had stored enough food and drinking water. As long as his luck was not particularly bad and he did not encounter a huge storm, Charlie could live comfortably on the lifeboat for at least ten days.

As the lifeboats were also equipped with advanced satellite equipment, Charlie could even connect to the internet on the vast sea.

Therefore, he was not very worried about his own safety. However, he had just killed his own brother, so he could not completely calm down for a while.

Charlie drove the lifeboat towards the North for a short while before his yacht sank in these waters. There were so many corpses that had sunk here. Even an atheist would feel a little terrified if he were to stay alone on the dark sea. Moreover, he did not want the rescue team to discover any clues in these waters. Therefore, the only way was to get the place where he was rescued as far away as possible.

There was also a satellite navigation system on the lifeboat. He was prepared to drive in the direction of the mainland for a few hours and then wait in place.

Under normal circumstances, the rescue team should have arrived faster.

They were far away from land, and the helicopter couldn’t reach them. They could only use the fixed – Wing aircraft to investigate and search for the rescue. At the same time, they would send a ship to search for the location signal sent by the chip on the lifeboat. However, large rescue ships were also equipped with helicopters, so as the ship moved in, the helicopter would also fly into the sky and search the nearby waters. It would only return to the rescue ship to replenish the fuel when it was almost used up.

Therefore, Charlie estimated that the rescue force would arrive here by tomorrow evening or the day after tomorrow at the latest.

……

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng kept flying towards the northeast direction. In a short while, Charlie’s lifeboat’s position had already exceeded the range of Xia ruofei’s spiritual sensing.

Xia ruofei turned around and looked at Charlie. He said to himself,””You’re on your own now! If you can’t even survive this, or if you encounter a storm at sea, you can only blame your own bad luck ...”
