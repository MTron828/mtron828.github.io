Chapter 1600: Returning to Spirit map Island (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei placed the realm Fox in front of him and said,””Hold on tight to my clothes, I don’t care if you fall!”

The white fox was curiously observing the motorboat. It wanted to figure out why something made of metal would not sink in the water, so it did not pay much attention to Xia ruofei’s warning.

Xia ruofei chuckled and ignored it. He started the engine of the motorboat. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This sudden burst of Tutu sound startled the realm Fox, and its body subconsciously curled up.

“Let’s go!” Xia ruofei patted the white fox and laughed.

Then, he clenched the handle and twisted the accelerator with his right hand. The sound of the motorboat’s engine increased again, and the whole boat shot forward like an arrow leaving the bow. It plowed a ditch on the sea, and white water splashed on both sides. The scene was spectacular.

Under the huge inertia, the white fox’s body was pushed back. Fortunately, Xia ruofei was there to block it. Otherwise, it would have been sent flying.

The little fellow was so scared that its face turned pale. This time, it didn’t need Xia ruofei’s reminder. Its claws clung onto Xia ruofei’s belt, not daring to let go for even a moment.

Xia ruofei’s childlike innocence was also activated. He controlled the motorboat to drift on the sea, and a large amount of water was rolled up. Xia Qing, who was on the shore, was also amazed.

Although Xia ruofei could easily achieve such a speed in this space without the motorboat, as a man, he was almost inborn with the excitement of such high – speed control. He felt that his adrenaline was soaring.

Xia ruofei was having a great time on the sea and did not even notice that he was drenched.

However, the white fox was in a bad state. When had this little fellow ever experienced such an exciting thing? It only knew to subconsciously grab Xia ruofei’s clothes and belt tightly. It curled up into a ball and was so scared that it did not even dare to open its eyes.

It was only when Xia ruofei had slowed down to his heart’s content that the White realmfox opened its eyes and looked outside. Then, it quickly shrank back into Xia ruofei’s arms.

Xia ruofei laughed,”little guy!” Exciting! Do you want another wave?”

The white fox quickly shook its head like a rattle – Drum and mumbled to itself that it would never want to experience such an experience again.

“Ignorant!” Xia ruofei said,”alright, I’ll send you back!”

Xia ruofei drove the motorboat straight to the beach and let it rest on the beach. He then carried the white leopard and landed on the beach steadily.

“How is it? This metal can float on the surface of the sea and move forward at high speed. I didn’t lie to you, right?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Xia Qing was still in shock. He nodded his head numbly and muttered,””This is unbelievable ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and put the white leopard down.

The little guy ran away like a wisp of smoke, as if the motorboat was a poisonous snake or a ferocious beast.

“I’m going to change my clothes. Wait for me here!” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing replied respectfully.

With a thought, Xia ruofei immediately teleported to the Archean realm. He changed out of his drenched clothes and changed into dry and comfortable casual clothes before returning to the mountain sea realm.

“Master, this mo ... Tuo ...”

“A motorboat!” Xia ruofei reminded.

“Yes, this motorboat is a godly item! This subordinate’s horizons have been greatly broadened!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is a very common thing in the outside world. There are no powerful cultivators in the outside world, but technology is very advanced. The machine that can fly like I just said was made by ordinary people.”

In fact, Xia ruofei was already used to the technological products of the outside world. In comparison, he was more amazed by the creativity of cultivators. Whether it was the magical array or the various cultivation techniques, they were all different from the evolutionary path of technology.

Take Xia Qing as an example. She often gave Xia ruofei the illusion that she was a living person. It could be said that this level of artificial intelligence had far exceeded the artificial intelligence technology of the outside world.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think of the problem he was facing. The space was getting wider and wider. He could clearly use this large piece of land and the unique environment to do more things, but he was facing a shortage of manpower, which made it difficult for him.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh and said,””Xia Qing, it would be great if there were more spiritual spirals in the space ... There are many things that you can’t handle by yourself, especially when it comes to harvesting Cordyceps ...”

Xia Qing said,”master, in fact, your control over the spirit map world is getting stronger and stronger. As long as you continue to let the spirit map world evolve, there will come a day when you will be able to have absolute control over every blade of grass, every tree, and even a speck of dust. At that time, things like harvesting Cordyceps, you can do it with a single thought!”

Xia ruofei also knew that Xia Qing wasn’t exaggerating. He could also feel that his compatibility with the space was constantly increasing. In theory, when this kind of control reached the extreme, he would become the absolute master of this space, just like the creator.

At that time, he could harvest all the Cordyceps in the soil with a single thought. Not only would he not hurt them at all, but he could even clean the soil on the surface of the Cordyceps.

However, this was only in theory! Only God knew how many more upgrades he would need to make to reach this level.

At least for now, Xia ruofei knew that he was still far from that level.

“Distant water can’t quench present thirst!” He could not help but smile bitterly.

“Master,” Xia Qing said after some thought,”why don’t you take a look around spirit map Island? maybe you can find a solution!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but turn to look at the small island in the distance. His voice was a little excited.”Are you saying that there’s a way to create spiritual spirals on that Island?” 1

Although Xia Qing had a lot of restrictions, spirit map Island had already been unsealed, so there was nothing she couldn’t say.

He smiled and said,”there is a thatched cottage in the depths of the spiritual herbal gardens. There are refining notes left behind by the previous master. Among them is the method of making puppets. However, this method is very complicated. Master, you still have to be mentally prepared for failure.”

Xia Qing was talking about puppets and not soul puppets, and she also said that the manufacturing method was very complicated. However, Xia ruofei, who was in a good mood, did not care about these details. He said happily,”Then what are we waiting for? I’ll go get it now! What did failure matter? If it doesn’t work the first time, I’ll try the second time. If the second time doesn’t work, I’ll try the third time. I don’t believe that I can’t make it with the blueprint!”

With that, Xia ruofei’s figure flashed and he immediately went to the seaside.

He pushed the motorboat into the sea and got on it. Without a word, he started the motorboat and flew straight in the direction of spirit tu Island.

Xia Qing stood on the shore with a bitter smile on her face.

Although master’s talent was not bad, and in a short two years, the spirit map world had evolved to this extent, after all, his cultivation was still shallow, and it was not easy to create a puppet.

Xia ruofei steered the motorboat and sped across the sea. Soon, they were close to spirit map Island.

He found a flat beach and rushed directly to the shore. The motorboat plowed a deep mark on the beach and only stopped after a few meters due to friction.

Xia ruofei got down from the car and headed straight for the spiritual herbal gardens.

The precious spiritual herbs in the herb garden were greedily absorbing the spiritual Qi. Xia ruofei knew that these spiritual herbs were not ripe yet so he did not pay too much attention to them. He just avoided them carefully and walked into the depths of the herb garden.

After a while, Xia ruofei saw a small thatched cottage.

To be more precise, it was a bamboo house. The roof was covered with thatch and there was a low fence outside. All the materials used were bamboo.

It was unknown how long this small house had existed, but whether it was the fence or the walls of the house, the bamboo was still green in color, as if it had just been cut down, looking quite wild.

While Xia ruofei was amazed, he did not slow down. He pushed open the wooden door and walked into the small courtyard. He stopped in front of the bamboo house, pushed open the bamboo door, and walked in ...
