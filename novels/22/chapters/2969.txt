Li Yifu looked at Xia ruofei worriedly and said,””Senior granduncle ...”

He stopped after saying three words because he saw that Xia ruofei did not look depressed at all. On the contrary, Xia ruofei looked relieved. He even clenched his fist and waved it in the air, saying excitedly,”“YES! We’ve finally taken it!”

Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng looked at each other, and the same thought came to their minds: Could it be that the master’s martial granduncle was muddled from anger?

Li Yifu called out carefully,”senior granduncle!” Senior granduncle!”

Only then did Xia ruofei come back to his senses. He turned to look at Li Yifu, his eyes still carrying a trace of unconcealed joy.

“What’s the matter, foster husband?”Xia ruofei asked.

“Great uncle – Master, this ore ...” Li Yifu said carefully,”it fell into our hands ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what do you mean by” smashed my hand “? I originally wanted to buy this ore! I was worried that Wu Ming would fight me to the end. I didn’t expect him to think he was so smart and stop all of a sudden. He thought he had tricked me! Hahaha!”

Li Yifu and Qingfeng Luo looked at each other in disbelief, and their expressions became strange.

Xia ruofei glared at them and said,”what’s with your expressions?” Don’t tell me you think I’ve broken my teeth and swallowed it? I really want this ore!”

“Grand uncle – Master, could it be that this ore is of great use to you?” Li Yifu asked tentatively.

If there was only one person in the world who believed that Xia ruofei could recognize this ore and know how to use it, it would definitely be Li Yifu.

He had a personal admiration for Xia ruofei. In his opinion, there was nothing that Xia ruofei could not do. Besides, he did not know much about the cultivation world in Huaxia. The first heaven society and Chen Xuan were no different from the star Seizer sect to him. Even though he had heard Luo Qingfeng’s introduction, it was not direct. Xia ruofei’s miraculous performance had long formed a deep impression in his heart.

Luo Qingfeng was obviously very interested as well. He could not help but stare at Xia ruofei, waiting for his answer.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””This ore is indeed very important to me. However, to you guys ... Or to most cultivators, it should be of no use. “Anyway, don’t ask too much about this matter. Since even you guys have such a misunderstanding, then the other cultivators, including Chen Xuan from the first heaven society, shouldn’t be suspicious. This is a good thing, so we don’t have to be targeted by people with ill intentions.”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!”

“Yes! Master!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng responded at the same time.

Since Wu Ming had publicly announced that he was no longer competing for this ore, Hao Qingsong, who was on the main auction stage, quickly made his third round of inquiry. Then, he loudly announced that this ore had been sold for the price of 6010 spirit stones, and that it was the cultivator from room 20 who had won the bid.

At this moment, Wu Ming suddenly said in an intriguing tone,””Seeing the fellow Daoist in room 20 so desperate to bid for this ore, I can’t help but guess that this fellow Daoist has already seen through the secret of this precious ore. If that’s the case, then even though I’m sorry to have missed this ore, I still hope that the fellow Daoist in room 20 can satisfy my curiosity and give me some pointers about this ore. I’m sure there are many fellow Daoists who have come to the auction today with the same thoughts as me!”

Wu Ming’s words were a little harsh.

Of course, he wouldn’t have thought of this with his brain. In fact, this was Luo Feng’s idea. On one hand, he wanted to make it look like he was raising the price on purpose and not wanting the ore. This way, he could please Chen Xuan while not losing face. On the other hand, it implied that the cultivator in room 20 had discovered the secret of the ore and that the ore must be very precious, so he was willing to buy it at all costs.

This was a very disgusting move.

The best outcome would naturally be for Chen Xuan to have the same thoughts as well. Even if Chen Xuan ignored it, if the other cultivators were to agree with this judgment, even if there were only a few of them who were tempted, it would still bring trouble to the people in room 20.

To put it bluntly, it was a matter of time. Even if no one believed his speculation, it was no loss for him. He was completely in an invincible position.

Wu Ming had also decided to give up the bid after hearing Luo Feng’s analysis. Otherwise, with Wu Ming’s personality, he would not have cowered after being humiliated like this. Grandma!

In room 20, Li Yifu and Luo Qingfeng’s expressions changed drastically when they heard this. Xia ruofei could not help but frown.

However, he immediately said without hesitation,””It seems fellow Daoist Wu was the first to make a bid! I’m just following his example. I also think that the item brought by elder Chen of the first heaven sect is definitely worth this price! If fellow Daoist Wu knows about this ore’s situation, I hope fellow Daoist Wu won’t be stingy with your teachings!”

Xia ruofei didn’t say much, but his meaning was obvious.”You, Wu Ming, are the first one to bid. I’m just following you.” On top of that, he was also trying to get on Chen Xuan’s good side. Naturally, he was also hinting that he was trying to get on Chen Xuan’s good side by bidding for the ore.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
