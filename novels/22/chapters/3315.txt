3316 A Pyrrhic victory and an unexpected joy (1)

Xia ruofei could only try his best to maintain the formation’s maximum attack. In fact, after some nodes were damaged, the formation’s attack power had started to decrease.

Fortunately, the high – Level astral beast was also injured quite badly, especially the continuous burning of the flames, which continued to cause damage to it, and also made it continue to be in a weak state.

At the end of the day, the only thing that mattered now was who could last longer.

The critical points of the formation were being continuously attacked, and the damage was getting more and more serious. The flames on the high – Level astral beast’s body were also burning more and more fiercely, and its mournful cries echoed throughout the formation.

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and continued to use the curved Frost Flying sword to stab the vital parts of the high – Level Star Beast.

Although the flying swords couldn’t do much damage to the Star Beast, they could distract it and disturb it. At the same time, they could also stimulate the Star Beast’s anger.

No matter if it was a human or an astral beast, once they were overwhelmed by anger, their judgment would naturally not be as accurate as when they were calm.

The black light continued to attack the high – Level Star Beast. Because it was in a state of Fury, it was persistently attacking its surroundings, so its defense was naturally lax. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As a result, even though the high level astral beast’s front claws were still moving like the wind, there were still many black lights that passed through the light curtain formed by the claws and landed on the high level astral beast, leaving big and small wounds.

Of course, more importantly, the wounds formed by the black light would burst into flames in a short time.

The high – Level astral beast’s injuries were getting more and more serious, and its roars were endless. However, its attacks were gradually weakening.

Of course, as the formation was damaged, its attack power was also constantly decreasing.

In fact, the high – Level astral beast had already thought of retreating when the battle had reached such a tragic stage.

Unfortunately, they were in a trap and kill array. Not only could this array attack with a terrifying sharp light, but it could also trap the enemy.

If this was an ordinary battlefield, the high – Level Star Beast would have already abandoned its dignity and face and fled. But now that it was trapped in the formation, it had no place to escape. It could only continue to attack aimlessly in despair.

Time passed by.

This was the third time Xia ruofei had added spiritual crystals to the formation.

Under the despairing attacks of the high – Level astral beast, the formation was becoming more and more broken.

Finally, the high – Level Star Beast couldn’t hold on any longer.

It let out an unwilling roar, and its huge body fell to the ground.

At this time, there were already over a hundred wounds of various sizes on his body. These wounds were all burning with raging flames, and he looked extremely miserable.

As for Xia ruofei’s trap and kill array, even though it was still attacking, the black light had become much sparser. It was only about one – fifth of its peak.

After the high – Level Star Beast fell, the black light landed on the high – Level Star beast’s body, which had been burned out of shape, without the Star Beast being able to resist.

The high – Level astral beast trembled a few times, but it could no longer stand up, let alone resist the attack.

Xia ruofei didn’t let his guard down. He didn’t come out of his hiding place and didn’t even stop attacking the array. He continued to activate the array without caring about the energy consumption and released the weakened attack.

The black light continued to fall on the high level Star Beast.

In the beginning, the high – Level astral beast would continue to struggle, but soon, it could only Twitch on the spot.

After a few minutes, when the black light landed on the high – Level astral beast, it could only move its claws. Its body could no longer move.

Xia ruofei finally heaved a sigh of relief.

This was the most dangerous situation he had ever been in since he entered the Tower of Trials.

Fortunately, the trap & kill array had a miraculous effect. In the end, he still managed to kill this high level Star Beast. Although the high level Star Beast was not completely dead under the support of its strong vitality, the result was already determined.

On the first floor of the Tower of Trials, the original infant stage puppet was extremely powerful, but Xia ruofei did not face it head on. It was only when he left the first floor of the Tower of Trials that the original infant stage puppet rushed to the entrance of the tunnel. However, the two of them still did not fight face to face. Xia ruofei entered the second floor of the Tower of Trials without any danger.

But this time, he was being held back by a high – Level astral beast. Xia ruofei had no choice but to face it head on.

One had to admit that the power of the original level was indeed very terrifying.

Without the help of the formation, it would be impossible for Xia ruofei to kill a high – Level Star Beast.

The black light continued to fall on the high level Star Beast. At this moment, there was not a single part of the high level Star Beast that was intact. The flames had completely surrounded it, but it still did not move. It was obvious that it had already died.

However, Xia ruofei did not feel any joy.

Although he had killed the high – Level Star Beast, it was an out – and – out Pyrrhic victory. His trap & kill array had basically been destroyed after this battle.

What made Xia ruofei even more depressed was that from the time he ran away from the high – Level Star Beast to the time he set up the trap & kill array and killed it by luck, the whole process had taken a lot of time.

One had to know that what he lacked the most now was time.

Xia ruofei looked at the mission notification in his perceptual mirror and realized that he only had three minutes left to break the record.

He could not help but smile bitterly.

What could he do in three minutes?

He would need at least ten times the time to reforge the materials for a new set of the confinement killing array. Moreover, even if the confinement killing array was intact now, he couldn’t kill 20 star beasts in three minutes.
