2998 The key person_

Wu Ming felt a little better after hearing that. He said,””That’s true. Furthermore, if this Xia fellow were to fight with Chen Xuan for a few more rounds, Chen Xuan might even get angry at him!”

Hearing this, Luo Feng shook his head secretly. However, he did not want to say anything more to Wu Ming, so he just smiled and continued watching the auction.

Just as Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan were chatting, a new price was announced.

105000 spirit stones.

The bidder was from Room 5, the cultivator from the Black Dragon cult.

The Black Dragon cult was also one of the top sects, and they had never made a bid before. Everyone had thought that they were no longer interested in the five sacred medallions. No one had expected them to suddenly make a bid. Furthermore, under such a high price, they had even added 4000 spiritual stones in one go. It was clear how determined they were.

In Room 6, Liu Mansha and Yang Liu looked at each other, then said,””As expected, old ghost Zhou is here for the five Holy badges!”

“It seems like they’re after something big ... Senior Sister, if the Black Dragon cult gets their hands on a five Saints token, then ...” Willow said with a grave expression.

“It’s fine!” Liu Mansha waved her hand and said,”the first heaven sect and the surging waves sect are both here. There’s also our soaring Flower Valley. They won’t be able to cause any trouble! I’m more worried about ...”

At this point, Liu Mansha’s beautiful brows furrowed slightly. She looked at the big screen above the main auction stage and said,””There’s still one five Holy badges that we haven’t received any news of. What I’m most worried about is that the Black Dragon cult has already quietly obtained one of the five Holy badges. If they take this one away, they’ll have two badges. They’ll obviously be the leaders in the future ...”

“We can’t let them succeed!” Yang Liu said,”Senior Sister, if it really doesn’t work, we can lend the spirit stones to the vast waves sect or the first heaven sect ...”

“Are we going to let them have two tokens?” Liu Mansha said,”then aren’t we also controlled by others?”

“Then what should we do?” Yang Liu said in distress,”choosing the lesser of two evils, if it really doesn’t work, this is the only way, Senior Sister! It was better for the first heaven society or the surging waves sect to control the two tokens than for the Black Dragon cult to get involved! Even if they only have one token, it’s easy for them to ruin things!”

Liu Mansha calmly thought for a moment and said,””There might be another way ...”

At this moment, a new bid appeared on the big screen: 11000 spirit stones.

The bidder was from room 20, a cultivator from the star Seizer sect.

“Could it be that you’re talking about ... The star Seizer sect?” Yang Liu’s brows also raised.

“In comparison, letting the star Seizer sect obtain this five Saints token might be the best outcome for us,” Liu Mansha said with a nod.

Both Liu Mansha and Yang Liu could see very clearly that no matter if it was the Cang lang sect or the first heaven sect, if they obtained this token, then this sect would have control over two five Saints tokens. This meant that they would definitely occupy a leading position in the future operation to crack the secret. This was something that the soaring Flower Valley was unwilling to see.

It was even more unacceptable for the Black Dragon cult to obtain the five Saint tokens.

As for the star Seizer sect, their strength could only be considered average. Even if they had obtained the five Holy badges, it was equivalent to everyone having one. Everyone was of equal status.

Of course, in reality, the star Seizer sect, which was on the weaker side, would definitely be in a subordinate position. At the very least, the soaring Flower Valley, the first heaven sect, and the Cang lang sect would be able to speak on relatively equal terms.

It was the same for the first heaven sect and the surging waves sect. They couldn’t accept the fact that the remaining two sects had obtained two tokens. If a new sect had to obtain the five Saints token, they would also think that the star Seizer sect was a good choice.

Liu Mansha had been in control of the flying flower Valley for many years, so she could be said to have a clear understanding of the human heart. She very quickly understood the key points, stood up, and said,”Junior Sister yang, I’m going out for a while ...”

Yang Liu naturally knew what Liu Mansha was going to do. She asked,””Senior apprentice – Sister, can’t we do the back...And ask the star Seizer sect to lend us spirit stones?”

Liu Mansha smiled faintly and said,”why do you have to force me?” And if the star Seizer sect does this, they’ll definitely offend the first heaven sect, the vast waves sect, and even the Black Dragon cult. You know very well what that old ghost Zhou is like. We have no enmity with the star Seizer sect, and we’ve even received their favor. How could we bear to put them in danger?”

“But once they obtain the five Holy badges ...” Yang Liu didn’t understand.

“That’s different!” Liu Mansha said,”the situation is a little complicated. I’ll explain it to you later ...”

With that, Liu Mansha walked out of the private room and headed straight for room 20, where Xia ruofei and the others were. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

As Liu Mansha walked along the corridor behind the private rooms to room 20, she thought about how to phrase her words.

Before she knew it, she had already arrived at the door of room 20.

Just as Liu Mansha was about to knock on the door, she saw the door to room 20 suddenly open.

To her surprise, the person who walked out of the room was Chen Xuan from the first heaven society.

When Chen Xuan saw Liu Mansha, he was clearly a little taken aback as well. However, he quickly regained his composure and smiled.”Valley master Liu, you’re here to see fellow Daoist Xia as well?”

Liu Mansha stared at Chen Xuan for a few seconds before saying,””It seems that fellow Daoist Chen has already looked for him?”

Chen Xuan smiled gently and nodded.””To be honest, I’ve already arrived. I’m afraid Valley master Liu is a little late ...”

At this moment, Xia ruofei also walked out after hearing the commotion. He was also slightly stunned when he saw Liu Mansha, and then said,””So it’s Valley master Liu. Are you here for me?”

Liu Mansha revealed a bitter smile and said,”Yup! However, it seems that I’m a step too late. ”

“That’s just my personality. I’ll do what I think, so I’ll always be one step ahead of others.” Chen Xuan chuckled.

Liu Mansha looked at Chen Xuan and asked,””I don’t know if fellow Daoist Chen can tell me what the result of your discussion is? After all, our flying flower Valley is also one of the owners of the five Holy badges. ”

“Of course!” Chen Xuan shrugged. Even if Valley master Liu didn’t say anything, I would’ve informed them anyway. ”

Chen Xuan looked at Xia ruofei and smiled,””After a friendly discussion, fellow Daoist Xia has agreed to lend us 110000 spirit stones, so ...”

Liu Mansha looked at Xia ruofei in disbelief. Then, she said to Chen Xuan,””Does the first heavenly sect want to keep two five Holy badges? Fellow Daoist Xia agreed so easily?”

Chen Xuan chuckled.”It’s not convenient for me to tell Valley master Liu the details of our discussion. However, since I’m indebted to fellow Daoist Xia, I naturally can’t let fellow Daoist Xia get into trouble because of this. So, if Valley master Liu has any dissatisfaction, I’ll also talk to sect leader mu. If he has any dissatisfaction, he can direct it at the first heaven society. Please don’t take it out on fellow Daoist Xia.”

Chen Xuan’s words were naturally a promise of protection to the star Seizer sect.

Liu Mansha didn’t realize it at first, but the intelligent her quickly understood the meaning behind this.

If one were to ask which sect had the right to possess two five sacred writs, it would definitely be the first heaven sect.

What Liu Mansha was concerned about was balance. She felt that by pulling the star Seizer sect in, a New Balance would be formed. However, from Chen Xuan’s point of view, the first heaven sect didn’t need any balance. They wanted to become the leader, and this was something that they had never concealed.

Liu Mansha didn’t know what promise Chen Xuan had made Xia ruofei. However, since Xia ruofei had agreed to lend out so many spiritual stones so readily, it must have been a very attractive condition.

Just the fact that the first heaven society was protecting the star Seizer sect was enough to move Xia ruofei.

And the truth was as such. As long as Chen Xuan made the announcement, there would be very few sects that would dare to not give him face. At the very least, no one would dare to make things difficult for the star Seizer sect on the surface. This way, the worry that Liu Mansha had mentioned to Yang Liu in the private room would naturally not exist.

Thinking of this, Liu Mansha felt a little discouraged. She looked at Chen Xuan and Xia ruofei with a complicated expression and said,””Fellow Daoist Chen, you’re being too serious. This matter has nothing to do with fellow Daoist Xia. How can we vent our anger on him?”
