Chapter 1239: the first Prince!

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course not. We’re not aviation soldiers.” However, I’ve received a period of helicopter piloting training, the kind that’s accelerated. It’s not for the purpose of training pilots, but purely for us to know the basic operations in emergency situations. ”

“Then how long has the crash course been trained for?” He Jiong’s mouth was wide open.

“Less than a month, I think!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”besides, the one – month training is not just about helicopter piloting. There are many other subjects such as landing. The actual flight time is less than 50 hours, and they are all accompanied by professional pilots. We have never flown alone.”

“This is simply unbelievable!” He Jiong said,”although I don’t know much about the flying industry, I still have some basic knowledge. Let’s not talk about what I can learn from the training in just a few dozen hours. The key is that the helicopter has no similarities with those large passenger planes!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I remember that when the plane was forced to land in Saipan, the injured Captain said something. He said that all of this was God’s arrangement. Although I don’t believe in Christianity, I agree with his words. If you have to name a reason, it’s probably because I’m a good learner. It was the captain who explained it to me, and I learned it now ...”

He Jiong could not help but laugh as well.”Or perhaps your desire to live is too strong!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””You can say that. After all, that was the situation at the time. If I didn’t succeed, I would have lost my life ...”

He Jiong and Xia ruofei were talking about the forced landing. They were also overjoyed. Although it had been a while since the incident, there were still many people on the internet who were paying attention to it. Some aviation enthusiasts were still doing various analyses on the basis of the existing information. However, not much information was revealed. For example, many of the details that Xia ruofei had mentioned in their chat were disclosed for the first time.

There was no doubt that after the show was broadcast, this small interview would definitely become the focus of netizens ‘discussion. This would definitely be a shot in the arm for the show’s ratings.

The two of them chatted and drank tea. The atmosphere was very harmonious and leisurely, which was quite in line with the positioning of the show.

After a while, Huang Lei stuck his head out and said,”Comrades, come and serve the dishes! Let’s get ready to eat ...”

“It’s coming!” He Jiong responded loudly, then smiled at Xia ruofei and said,”let’s go and see what delicious food teacher Huang has prepared!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhang Xing and Peng Chang were helping out in the kitchen. Of course, there were also cameramen recording the entire process. The scene of Huang Lei cooking was also the most attractive part of the show!

The few of them worked together and soon, the dishes that Huang Lei had prepared were served.

The dining area was near the pergola. Not far from the root – carved coffee table where Xia ruofei and he Jiong made tea, there was also a long, solid dining table. The table was very long and looked a little like a conference table. It would not be a problem for a dozen people to eat together.

It was clear in all directions, and the view was very wide. Not far away was a quiet lake, and the scenery was infinitely good. As long as the weather wasn’t too cold, the environment was a form of enjoyment to eat here.

Huang Lei had prepared a sumptuous lunch. Other than the pork stew with vermicelli that Xia ruofei had ordered in the morning, he had also made a few dishes with the vegetables that Xia ruofei and Zhang Xing had picked from the greenhouse and the small amount of ingredients that the festival team had prepared.

In addition, there was also a steamed Chinese perch.

After he Jiong saw it, he could not help but smile and said, “We’re all thanks to President Xia! This is the most sumptuous lunch I’ve had since I started recording this program!”

These words revealed a deep resentment towards the director team. The on – site director, who was directing the shooting in the courtyard outside the pergola, laughed awkwardly.

Most people would definitely not be used to eating and chatting under the watchful eyes of more than ten to twenty people. However, He Jiong and the other three were professional artistes and Xia ruofei’s psychological quality was quite good. He acted naturally in front of the camera.

He Jiong smiled and said,”teacher Huang, you’ve worked hard!” He prepared such a sumptuous meal for us! This is our first meal in the mushroom house, and it’s a good start! In that case ... Let’s dig in!”

Xia ruofei raised his hand and said,”that ... Teacher he, let me stop you ... I still have a question ...”

The expressions on He Jiong, Huang Lei and the rest’s faces suddenly became a little interesting. The director’s face turned green. Could he be up to no good again?

“Please speak, President Xia!” He Jiong’s smile was extremely bright.”I guess it must be something good!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s like this ... I don’t know what you guys were like when you were recording shows in the past ... The guests would come over and bring a few bottles of wine for everyone to try. Is that against the rules of the show?”

He Jiong winked at the director and laughed,”I don’t think so! Isn’t it normal to have human relations?”

Huang Lei also joined in,”that makes sense!” It’s such a good dish, wouldn’t it be a waste if there’s no wine?”

This time, the director didn’t even need Gao Jun’s instructions and just nodded at them.
