Chapter 1161: Buying property (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Yes, boss!” Wu Qiang replied respectfully.

Although the third courtyard was not big, there were still five to six bedrooms. Wu Qiang was not picky about the accommodation. He randomly chose a room and put his things in it. Then, he ran over to help serve the dishes.

“Ruofei, what did you make that smells so good?” Zhao Yongjun asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed.”You guys are in luck. I saw our company’s paradise vegetables at the Sam’s Club. I bought some for you guys to try!”

“Oh, really? I’ve been hearing from Xiao Rui about how delicious the vegetables in your company are these past two days, and I’ve been itching to go to San Shan to have a good meal!” Zhao Yongjun said happily,”I didn’t expect your products to be sold in Beijing!”

“We’re working with a super merchant. The production capacity is limited in the early stages, so we should be able to distribute the goods all over the country later.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Rui saw the Drunken Eight Immortals wine on the table and couldn’t help but call out,””Woof! Even Drunken Eight Immortals had one! Today’s meal is very sumptuous!”

“I also bought it from the Sam’s shop.” Xia ruofei said without changing his expression.

“Drunken Eight Immortals?” Zhao Yongjun was confused.

Song Rui said with a smile,”brother Zhao, you only know that ruofei’s company produces high – end vegetables, but you don’t know that he has invested in a winery!” Let me tell you, this wine is selling like crazy in the southeast province. It’s not expensive, but the taste is no worse than the Maotai Wuliangye!”

“Oh, really? Then I’ll have to drink a few more cups today!” Zhao Yongjun said happily.

He was also a wine lover, and he was in a good mood today because he had accidentally reunited with the soldiers he had led in the past.

Soon, everyone was seated at the table and eating. Without any suspense, drunken eight immortal and the table full of Peach Garden vegetables conquered Zhao Yong Jun and Wu Qiang.

Wu Qiang was still a little reserved, but Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but praise him loudly. It wasn’t song Rui’s first time tasting the Taoyuan vegetables, so he didn’t say anything at all from the beginning and just ate it.

Everyone was a man today, so they didn’t have to eat in a refined manner. In a short while, everyone had finished the food on the table and drank two bottles of Drunken Eight Immortals wine.

Zhao Yongjun wiped his mouth and said,””Satisfying! Today’s meal was really satisfying! Those clubs and private restaurants were not as good as RUO Fei’s cooking! Ruofei, if you open a restaurant, I’m sure you’ll make a lot of money too!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”the main thing is that the ingredients are good!” My cooking skills can only be considered average ...”

After the meal, everyone returned to the main courtyard and sat around the stone table under the grape trellis, making tea and chatting.

Both Zhao Yongjun and song Rui decided to stay here tonight, so the three of them went out again and bought a few sets of beddings. As for Wu Qiang, he stayed at home to pack his things.

They drove to a nearby store. Xia ruofei thought about it and bought a few more sets of bedsheets, pillows, and blankets.

He had considered that he could use it if there were guests in the future, so it was also a regular home item.

After returning to the courtyard house, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui each picked a guest room and brought a set of bedding to the room. They did it themselves and had enough food and clothing.

Xia ruofei also kept one set and asked Wu Qiang to put the rest of the sets in the empty guest room cabinets.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was staying in the biggest master bedroom in the second courtyard.

The huge master bedroom also came with an independent bathroom with an extra – large Jacuzzi and a separate cloakroom. There was also a study room and a living room. The entire large room spanned two courtyards, and the interior decoration was very luxurious.

After taking a hot bath, Xia ruofei took out a set of clean home clothes from the space and changed into them. He lay on the bed and looked at his phone for a while before falling asleep.

It was a quiet night.

The next day, Xia ruofei gave the control system of the smart home to Wu Qiang. This way, even if he was not at home, Wu Qiang could come and go as he pleased.

Zhao Yongjun’s friend, who was in the restoration of ancient buildings, also came over. After checking the site, he quickly came up with a preliminary restoration plan and budget.

Xia ruofei had been making many changes, so the total amount was only about 500000.

For the restoration of ancient buildings, such a small project was really too small. If it wasn’t for Zhao Yongjun’s relationship, his friend probably wouldn’t even be willing to take on such a small project.

Xia ruofei trusted Zhao Yongjun’s men, so he nodded in agreement after a quick look.

However, he couldn’t stay in Beijing all the time. Fortunately, Wu Qiang had officially come to work, so he could keep an eye on the reconstruction of the siheyuan. Besides, Zhao Yongjun was also in Beijing, so there shouldn’t be any problems with him taking care of it.

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun’s friend went out to the bank to transfer the advance payment to him.

Wu Qiang stayed in the courtyard house alone.

After he tidied up the place, he picked up a broom and began to sweep the fallen leaves in the yard. It was early autumn, and some trees in the North had already begun to shed leaves.

After cleaning up the three courtyards, Wu Qiang found a leather pipe from the tool room and connected it to the tap in the courtyard. He then began to wash the bluestone slabs.

People had been coming and going for the past two days, and they had brought a lot of dust in. The military camp was generally spotless. Wu Qiang was not used to seeing any dirt, so he had to clean it up.

Although Xia ruofei had said that they could hire a part – time cleaner, Wu Qiang still felt a little apologetic for not having much work to do despite his high salary.

Therefore, he had decided that he didn’t need to hire a part – time helper to clean the yard. He would clean it himself every day. It didn’t take much effort anyway. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Just as Wu Qiang was cleaning the courtyard, the front courtyard’s side door opened.

Wu Qiang placed the hose that was still flowing into the flower bed and straightened his body.

A brand new Land Rover slowly drove in.

When Wu Qiang saw Xia ruofei sitting in the car, he quickly turned off the tap and walked up to her. He greeted her respectfully,””Boss, you’re back!”

Xia ruofei opened the car door and jumped out. He smiled and nodded.

Then, he said,”why are you cleaning by yourself?” Didn’t I tell you to just get someone to do it?”

“Boss, I’ll just do this small task, don’t waste any more money ...” Wu Qiang said with a simple and honest smile.

Wu Qiang’s parents had to take medicine for a long time in the countryside. His younger brother and sister were more hardworking. All three of them had been admitted to college. The whole family relied on his salary every month to survive.

When he was the security Captain, although his monthly salary was 6000 Yuan, he always tried his best to eat his fill during the meal. The other two meals were basically just passable. He spent as little money as possible and sent the money he saved to his parents and siblings.

Now that he was working for Xia ruofei, his salary had increased by a huge amount. Food and accommodation were also included, so he was much more well – off.

Yesterday, Xia ruofei had paid him a month’s salary in advance and even asked for his bank account number. He had also signed a formal employment contract with the Paradise Corporation. From now on, he would be an official employee of the Paradise Corporation and his salary would be transferred to his bank account every month.

Wu Qiang’s gratitude towards Xia ruofei came from the bottom of his heart. Naturally, he did the cleaning out of his own will.

Xia ruofei could feel Wu Qiang’s sincerity. He also knew that he could not dampen Wu Qiang’s enthusiasm at this time. Hence, he smiled and nodded.”Alright, do your best. I’ll give you a raise at the end of the year ...”

“Boss, the salary is already very high ...” Wu Qiang quickly said.

Xia ruofei laughed.”Our company’s employees all have a fixed capital increase. We’re not giving you any special treatment!”

After saying that, he casually threw the car keys to Wu Qiang.

Wu Qiang caught it subconsciously. At this moment, he heard Xia ruofei say,””I went out to buy a car this morning. From now on, this car is under your control!”
