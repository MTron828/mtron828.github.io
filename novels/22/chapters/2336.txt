Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and said,””I wish I could move my house here! I’ve been dreaming about it!”

Song Wei blushed. She knew what Xia ruofei meant.

After being with Xia ruofei for so long, Song Wei had become immune to this kind of teasing. She blushed and retorted,””I don’t have any objections! I’m sure my parents won’t have any objections! Why don’t you go in now and tell them that you’ve broken up with Qingxue and that you want to be our live – in son – in – Law? I think they might really agree to it!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. He smiled bitterly and said,”Please spare me!”

Song Wei rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and burst into laughter.

Then, she pointed at Knight XV’s spacious trunk and said,””By the way, you have too many of these things!”

The wide trunk was almost filled to the brim, and this did not even include the backpack that Xia ruofei had been carrying.

There were large and small bags of medicinal herbs in the trunk, and some other bags contained unknown things. There was also a small Plastic Sealing Machine, and there were even several buckets of water piled in the corner of the trunk. It really looked like they were going to move.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”these are all for uncle song’s rehabilitation. Let’s not talk so much. Let’s start moving!” You can just take the lighter ones!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he took a step forward and easily lifted the heaviest Plastic Sealing Machine. Song Wei also quickly took a few big bags of herbs. As a cultivator, this little weight was naturally nothing to her.

The two of them had to make three trips to move most of the things. They had sent everything to Xia ruofei’s guest room on the first floor. In the end, there were only four buckets of water left in the car.

“Are you going to move this too?” Song Wei asked, feeling a little speechless. We have bottled water at home! And it can be sent over with a phone call ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course we’re moving!” This was no ordinary water! I prepared this especially for uncle song! Wei Wei, you don’t have to do this hard work, I’ll finish moving the rest of the things in two trips!”

In terms of weight, he could easily carry four buckets of water by himself, but it was not easy to carry, so two buckets at a time was the most appropriate.

“Are you looking down on me?” Song Wei pouted and said. This little weight can trouble this young lady?”

After she finished speaking, she took the lead and walked to the back of the car. She gently carried a bucket of water in each hand and walked into the house.

Xia ruofei quickly moved the remaining two buckets of water out of the car. After closing the trunk, he took the two buckets of water and quickly chased after them.

Fang Liyun was just coming down the stairs when she saw Song Wei and Xia ruofei carrying two buckets of water. She was stunned.

Her first reaction was,”did your family call for water?”

However, Fang Liyun immediately realized that even if they did call for water, they would not let them move by themselves! Even song Wei, the delicate – looking young lady, had rolled up her sleeves and joined the battle. What was going on?

“Where did the water come from?” Fang Liyun quickened her pace down the stairs and said,”put it down, put it down! You two kids, why are you doing your own hard work? Wei Wei, did you order RUO Fei around?”

Song Wei put down the two buckets of water and said with a wronged expression,”Mom! How can you be so biased! He’s the one ordering me around, alright?”

Xia ruofei chuckled as he put down the bucket of water.””Aunty, Song Wei is helping me! I prepared this water for uncle song, it’s good for his recovery ... I wanted Song Wei to help me carry some small things, but I didn’t expect her to be so strong!”

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei with a smile.

Fang Liyun could not help but look at her daughter and said,””Yup! Wei Wei, when did you become so strong? Didn’t you need your dad’s help to open a can of drink before?”

Song Wei was embarrassed and anxious after her mother exposed her dark history in front of the person she loved. She said in a low voice,”Mom! What old history are you talking about? Even when I was in college, I still worked out, okay?”

“Alright, alright, alright. I’m the one who didn’t understand my precious daughter ...” Fang Liyun said with a smile.

She looked at Xia ruofei and Song Wei and thought of the scene where they carried water together. The more she looked at them, the more she felt that they were a good match.

Fang Liyun couldn’t help but shake her head, trying to stop herself from having such a dangerous thought. She changed the topic and asked,”Ruofei, is this water prepared for your uncle song?”

He was just trying to find something to talk about. Xia ruofei had already said it!

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””I made this with spring water. Although it’s colorless and tasteless, it actually has many medicinal ingredients that can promote the recovery of brain injuries.”

The barrelled water was actually the spirit pond water in the spirit map space. Xia ruofei had specially bought a few barrelled water and poured out the drinking water before filling the space with the spirit pond water.

The spatial spirit pool water was beneficial for the recovery of one’s spiritual power. Xia ruofei believed that long – term drinking of it would help song Qiming recover his sea of consciousness.

Since Fang Liyun was asking about the buckets of water, Xia ruofei decided to explain clearly. He said,””Auntie, from today onwards, uncle song’s daily water will be changed to the bottled water I brought. This is drinkable, or you can heat up the tea. Just treat it as daily drinking water.”
