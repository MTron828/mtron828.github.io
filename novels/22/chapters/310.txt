Liang Weihua said shamelessly,”that’s different. Mine doesn’t have that many tree lumps. I even had an expert verify it. But the risk of this material is obviously much higher!” “How can there be no risk in buying wood!” Liang Qichao sneered. After open the window, if the quality was not good, he would not take it. All the risks would be borne by RUO Fei! What kind of logic is this?” When Liang Weihua heard this, he immediately caught on to the flaw in Liang Qichao’s words and said quickly,””Qi Chao, you’re wrong! The person who wants to buy wood now is uncle. Whose position are you standing on?” “RUO Fei is my friend! He spent so much energy to find the Phoebe zhennan material, and he has already helped me a lot! Why should he take the risk?” Liang Qichao said, unwilling to be outdone. Liang Weimin couldn’t help but frown when he saw this. He quickly said,”Little Chao, don’t say anymore ...” In his opinion, Liang Qichao was still too inexperienced. Liang Weihua had obviously set a trap for him, but he had fallen right into it. Now that the topic had been brought up, Liang Qichao was speaking for Xia ruofei, and it would be easier for elder Tang to misunderstand. Liang Xiaojun couldn’t help but reveal a mocking smile, and he was secretly happy. Only old master Tang remained calm and did not express his opinion. He allowed the younger generation to engage in a verbal battle. Xia ruofei had been watching coldly from the side for a while now. He could clearly see that Liang Weihua was not willing to be outdone by Liang Weimin, so he made such a shameless request. Liang Qichao’s words were a pleasant surprise for Liang Weihua. Of course, Xia ruofei still felt warm inside. It seemed that he had good taste. Liang Qichao was indeed a worthy friend. When he saw Liang Weihua and Liang Xiaojun’s proud smiles, he couldn’t help but sneer in his heart. Xia ruofei was 100% confident about this material, so Liang Weihua’s little trick was destined to fail. Furthermore, Liang Weihua had been making things difficult for him time and time again, treating him as a source of income. Even if he was a clay Buddha, he would still be angry, so he naturally couldn’t just let it go. Now that Liang Weihua had made this request, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea. Hence, he decided to help Liang Weimin and Liang Qichao once again and completely step Liang Weihua into the pit! Thinking of this, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Old master Tang, what do you think about the matter of ‘opening the windows’?” “Mr. Xia, the decision is in your hands.” Elder Tang chuckled. Of course, even if you don’t want to’ open the window ‘, I’ll still buy this material for 10 million. Based on its current appearance, it’s worth the price!” Xia ruofei’s impression of elder Tang improved. Of course, he knew that this amount of money was nothing in the eyes of this elder. Even if it was eye – catching, it was not a big deal. Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”I’ve always been honest when I do business. Since someone has suggested to’ open the window ‘, I’ll open one. But ...” Xia ruofei suddenly changed the topic and continued,””If the quality of the car is not good, I won’t say anything if you just leave.”However, if the quality is far beyond our imagination, then the price of ten million is not very appropriate ...” Elder Tang laughed and said,”you’re so straightforward, Mr. Xia!” However, I don’t like to take advantage of others. Even if the quality of this piece of material is very bad, as long as it is a Phoebe zhennan, I will still buy it for ten million! If the quality is very good, then we will give you as much as you deserve!” “Uncle, this ...” Liang Weihua quickly said. According to elder Tang, Xia ruofei was basically undefeatable. No matter what the result was, as long as the Phoebe zhennan was real, they could earn at least ten million Yuan. “Wei Hua, this is my final decision!” Elder Tang said indifferently. “It’s ... Uncle!” Liang Weihua quickly said. His expression was a little unsightly, but he thought about it again. If the material was bad, it would mean that Liang Weimin and his son had messed up the matter, and elder Tang had wasted money for nothing. His goal of suppressing Liang Weimin and his son would have been achieved. Thinking of this, Liang Weihua’s mood improved. He rolled his eyes and immediately said,””Uncle, since I’m the one who suggested this, I’ll also express my stance. If the quality of this material is really very good, then I will pay the extra difference!” Elder Tang only gave a slight smile and did not say anything. Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened and he immediately said,””Then it’s decided!” Xia ruofei then looked at Liang Weimin and said,””Uncle Liang, I’ll have to trouble you to arrange for a master to bring the equipment and open the window for this material!” “Sure, no problem!” Liang Weimin nodded. Liang Weimin took the phone to the door to make a call to the carpenter, while Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Please sit, old master Tang! I hope you don’t mind that the warehouse is a little shabby. ” There were only four plastic stools in the storage unit, so elder Tang didn’t mind. He smiled and nodded his thanks, taking the plastic stool from Xia ruofei. Then, Xia ruofei gave Yuan Shan and Liang Qichao a plastic stool each. Naturally, Xia ruofei kept the last one for himself. As for Liang Weihua and the others, Xia ruofei could not be bothered! Just let them stand. Liang Weihua’s cold eyes swept across Xia ruofei. He did not say anything and just stood quietly behind elder Tang with a cold smile on his face. I can’t believe this kid has F * cking luck! Hmph! It would definitely be trash! Liang Weihua said to himself. After waiting for more than ten minutes, the carpenter that Liang Weimin had contacted arrived with the tools. Very quickly, everyone had gathered around that piece of material. After consulting with Xia ruofei and elder Tang, the carpenter quickly plugged in an electric plane and got ready to start working. If elder Tang were to buy this piece of material, he would have to transport it back to be used as a longevity material, so he had to ensure that the entire piece of material was intact. Therefore, the carpenter only removed a part of the bark, and then used a plane to cut off the edge material little by little. Soon, the proportion of the core material, which occupied 95% of the entire material, was close to 95%. With the sound of the electric plane, the thin outer layer of the Phoebe zhennan was quickly cut off, revealing the core of the Phoebe zhennan, which was also where it was really sold. After the core was exposed, the carpenter was even more careful. After all, this was a precious material made of gold Phoebe Wood! Soon, the carpenter also removed a small part of the outermost core, revealing a flat cut surface of about 25 centimeters wide and about one and a half meters long. In order for old master Tang to better judge the quality of this expensive wood, the carpenter had specially made three burls on the cut.
