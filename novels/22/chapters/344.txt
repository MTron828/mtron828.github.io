Chapter 345: Chapter 334 – finally together (2)

Xia ruofei immediately smiled bitterly.”I saw her face turn pale from the pain the other day. That’s why I’m feeling sorry for her.” “I didn’t expect you to be so protective of women ...” Ling Qingxue said with a half – Smile. “This is called a doctor’s parental heart! A patient is a patient, and there’s no difference between a man and a woman. ” Xia ruofei said seriously, then gritted his teeth and said,”I just didn’t expect miss Lu to be so unkind and deliberately ruin my show ...” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing.””You deserve it!” “You’re not angry anymore, are you?” Xia ruofei said cheekily. “I’m angry!” Ling Qingxue said fiercely,”I’ll let you have tender and protective feelings for women!” “Then I’ll treat you too. I’ll treat you three times!” Xia ruofei said immediately. Ling Qingxue was embarrassed and said,”I didn’t ... It hurt!” Cure my ass!” “Alright, alright!” Xia ruofei put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s shoulder and said,”in my memory, Qingxue is very magnanimous. When you were in junior high school, a boy from the class next door wrote you a love letter. A girl who liked that boy ran to the class and scolded you, but you didn’t take it to heart ...” Ling Qingxue was so angry that she pinched Xia ruofei and said,””You can’t remember! I’m the one who told you this, okay? You didn’t even remember me when we were in junior high ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. However, after Xia ruofei’s comedic banter, Ling Qingxue was no longer angry about that matter. She let Xia ruofei hug her and even rested her head on his shoulder. In fact, Ling Qingxue had almost cooled down over the past few days. She knew very well that Xia ruofei, Lu You, and Jiang Yue were fine. They were just a little uncomfortable in their hearts. When she saw Xia ruofei today, she could no longer hold on to her little reserve, so naturally, she went with the flow and forgave Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei also heaved a sigh of relief. He picked up some food for Ling Qingxue, poured her some wine, and kept on saying sweet words and jokes, making Ling Qingxue laugh. Of course, Xia ruofei would not be so honest. As he picked up the food with his right hand, his left hand was still around Ling Qingxue. He even started to move around slowly. Ling Qingxue twisted her body in embarrassment and said,”Are you going to let me eat ...” “Eat, eat, eat ...” Xia ruofei touched his nose awkwardly and said,”come, wife, let me toast you again ...” The two of them had a great meal, and even finished the entire bottle of red wine. Although most of it went into Xia ruofei’s stomach, Ling Qingxue had at least six or seven glasses. After drinking, Ling Qingxue’s exquisite face was flushed red, and her eyes became a little dazed. Under her white knitted sweater, her proud curves rose and fell slightly. There was even a slight smile on the corner of her mouth, which was really attractive. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but stare at Ling Qingxue in a daze, his eyes a little blank. Ling Qingxue’s heart was beating fast under Xia ruofei’s gaze. She bit her lower lip and glared at Xia ruofei. Then, she said,”Ruofei, you’ve had your drink and your meal. Hurry up and sign the contract! So that I can report back to the company ...” Xia ruofei didn’t say anything. He reached out and held Ling Qingxue’s delicate waist. Then, with a little force, he easily carried Ling Qingxue onto his lap and lowered his head to kiss her as she screamed. After a long kiss, Ling Qingxue was so embarrassed that she buried her head in Xia ruofei’s chest. Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Wife, I’ve been waiting for you for an hour and a half this afternoon. Do you know your mistake?” Ling Qingxue shot a quick glance at Xia ruofei and said,””I ... I have a lot of things to do at the company!” “This reason is not sufficient!” Xia ruofei said domineeringly,”you’re purposely leaving your husband out here. Don’t you think ... I should punish you?” “You ... How do you want to punish me?” Ling Qingxue felt Xia ruofei’s invasive gaze and felt a sense of panic. “Hehe ... What do you think?” Xia ruofei said. After he finished speaking, he stood up with Ling Qingxue in his arms and walked towards the resting room in the inner room. Ling Qingxue’s soft arms wrapped tightly around Xia ruofei’s neck to keep her balance. She said shyly,””RUO Fei, it ‘s...It’s not safe here ...” “Wife, have you forgotten what I used to do?” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I’ve already checked the entire room in the one and a half hours I was waiting for you. There’s no sign of any sneaky cameras ...” Xia ruofei was habitually cautious and alert. Even though the possibility of boss Zheng setting him up was very low, he still carefully checked the room after entering it. It was almost an instinctive act that had integrated into his blood and soul. Ling Qingxue glared at Xia ruofei in embarrassment and said,””Scoundrel! It turns out that you’ve already planned this ...” Xia ruofei chuckled but did not say anything. Although he didn’t have much experience in love, he knew that there were times when men should be more thick – skinned. It was like a joke that said, if a woman stopped when she called you a beast, she would say that you were worse than a beast later on ... While they were talking, Xia ruofei had already carried Ling Qingxue into the lounge ... Everything was done. After a long time, the storm finally stopped. Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue as they sat on the bed. Ling Qingxue’s face was still slightly red, but she was smiling happily. Xia ruofei fumbled around in his coat pocket and took out an exquisite porcelain bottle. He handed it to Ling Qingxue and said,””Qingxue, this is the nutrient solution I concocted. Drink it ...” “Nutrient solution?” Ling Qingxue took the bottle doubtfully and took a sip.”It doesn’t taste good! It’s almost the same as plain water ...” “The fruit juice has a taste, but it doesn’t have any healing properties!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”drink it all. It’s good for your body.” Ling Qingxue knew that Xia ruofei would never harm her, so she obediently drank the entire bottle of “nutrient solution”. This small porcelain bottle only had a capacity of two to three hundred milliliters, about the same as a box of milk. Ling Qingxue finished it very quickly. After a short while, Ling Qingxue cried out in surprise,””Ruofei, your nutrient solution is really powerful! I feel like I’m full of energy!” One had to know that after the “fierce battle” just now, Ling Qingxue had long been exhausted. But now, she had suddenly recovered her strength. This “nutrient solution” was really too magical. “Have you recovered your strength?” Xia ruofei chuckled. Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei’s expression and suddenly realized that something was wrong. She quickly pulled the blanket to cover her delicate body and asked,””What do you want to do?” “Hehe, now that I’ve recovered my strength, it’s time for the second half!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, as Ling Qingxue cried out in surprise, he pulled the duvet away. At first, Ling Qingxue resisted symbolically, but she was soon lost in it. After a while, the moving music score reverberated throughout the room ...
