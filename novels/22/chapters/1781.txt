Chapter 1782: Getting your wish (3)

Therefore, without any hesitation, the two of them said in unison,””Boss Xia, we’re willing!”

Wu Qiang also expressed his gratitude to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”in that case, it’s settled. You’ll sign the employment contract with the peach blossom company under my name. Your salary will also be paid by the company. This way, it’ll be more convenient for you to apply for medical insurance and social security.” “Wu Qiang, I’ll talk to the Human Resources Department and have them send the contract over by Express Mail. You can get Auntie Wu and Xiao LAN to sign it and send it back!”

“Yes, President Xia!” Wu Qiang hurriedly replied.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Wu Qiang, please arrange the accommodation. Among the three of you, Wu Qiang is the person in charge. When I’m not in the capital, you just have to listen to Wu Qiang’s arrangements.”

The three of them nodded.

“Director Xia, I would like to let sister – in – Law and Xiao LAN live in the backyard as well. It’ll be more convenient for work,” Wu Qiang said.

Other than the backyard, there were also many empty rooms in the front yard. However, Xia ruofei’s big yard was in the middle, so in comparison, it was more convenient to live in the backyard.

Xia ruofei said,”you can decide on these things yourself. The bed and bedding are all ready – made. Wuqiang, take a look and see if you lack any daily necessities. Remember to buy them tomorrow.” Keep the receipts for the expenses and the groceries. I’ll reimburse you regularly!”

“Alright, director Xia!” Wu Qiang said,”then we’ll go over first!”

“Go! Auntie Wu and the others have been on the road for the whole day and even caught up with the traffic control. They must be very tired, you should all rest early!” Xia ruofei said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wu Qiang and the other two left Xia ruofei’s room.

Although Xia Rufei had been very gentle, Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan felt an inexplicable pressure. They only heaved a sigh of relief when they left Xia ruofei’s courtyard.

“Qiangzi, it’s done?” Wu Xiujuan asked in disbelief.

“Of course!” Wu Qiang laughed. I’ve told you that President Xia is very kind and doesn’t put on any airs! Sis – in – Law, Xiao LAN, you’ll find out later that director Xia is really good to his employees!”

“Brother Qiang, we’ll definitely work hard!” Xia Xiaolan said excitedly,”we definitely won’t let the boss down for giving us such a high salary!”

“En!” Wu Qiang smiled and nodded. I’ll arrange a place for you to stay! Sister – in – Law, Xiao LAN, there are six rooms in this courtyard. I’m staying in the easternmost room. You can each choose one of the other five rooms!”

Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan looked at the rooms prepared for the staff in the backyard. They were also beautifully decorated, with an independent bathroom and a soft bed. They felt like they were in a dream.

Yesterday, they were still in the mountain village in their hometown. Today, they had come to the bustling capital and lived in such a large courtyard. Even when they came to work, they could live in such a good room. It was simply a life like heaven!

The two of them discussed for a while. Xia Xiaolan asked for the room at the far west end, while Wu Xiujuan stayed next to Xia Xiaolan.

In this way, they and Wu Qiang would live on the opposite side of the room, which also reflected the difference between men and women. Moreover, Wu Xiujuan was separated between Xia Xiaolan and Wu Qiang, which was also suggested by the shy Xia Xiaolan.

After choosing their rooms, Wu Qiang moved their luggage into them and taught them how to use the water heater and other facilities in the house. He then told them to rest early and returned to his room.

That night, Wu Qiang, Wu Xiujuan, and Xia Xiaolan, who had met their blind date, tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep.

Xia ruofei, who was staying in the middle courtyard, was also suffering from insomnia.

Every time he thought about Song Wei, he would have a headache. Song Wei might come to see him again tomorrow. How could he make song Wei give up on the idea? Xia ruofei’s heart was in a mess when he thought about it ...
