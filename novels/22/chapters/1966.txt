1967 The feast (2)

“Uncle Xu personally set up the Feng Shui Bureau for you. There’s no mistake!” Guo Hongjiang smiled and said,”the number of people in Hong Kong who are waiting for uncle Xu’s help could line up from the nine Dragons to the new worlds!”

Xu lang laughed.”Director Guo, you’re wrong this time. Even without me, Xia Sheng’s company will still be doing well!”

Guo Hongjiang was surprised and asked,”Oh?” Could it be that the building is a treasure?”

Xu lang shook his head and said,””The building’s Fengshui can only be said to be average, and there are even some small flaws.”

“Then I don’t understand ...” Guo Hongjiang was very curious.

Xu lang laughed and said,”director Guo, Xia Sheng has some good stuff in his hands!” A few flaws in the Feng Shui are nothing, it can be suppressed easily!”

“Oh? It must be a treasure if uncle Xu praised it!” Said Guo Hongjiang. Then, he turned to look at Xia ruofei.”Xia Sheng, when will you let us see it?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said!”It’s just a decoration. It’s in my office.! Uncle Xu said it’s best not to move it. If you’re interested, I’ll welcome you to San Shan anytime!”

“I’m interested! Of course I’m interested!” Guo Hongjiang said,”xiasheng, it’s a deal! When I visit the three mountains one day, I’ll definitely go and see such a treasure!”

Xia ruofei did not expect Guo Hongjiang to be so concerned. How would he know how important Xu lang was to the rich people in Hong Kong? If Xu lang praised it as something good, it must be a rare treasure that could not be bought with money.

Of course, Guo Hongjiang also had the intention to support Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” As long as director Guo is willing, you can look at it for as long as you want, just don’t move away!”

Everyone burst into laughter.

The meal lasted for more than an hour. The ingredients used for each dish were quite expensive and all of them were the best. Among them, there were naturally vegetables produced by Tao Yuan company. The Hengfeng group and Tao Yuan company had a deep cooperation. The sales of Tao Yuan vegetables in Hong Kong were all handled by the subsidiaries of Hengfeng group.

Other than Feng Jing, who often went out with Xia ruofei, this was the first time that Dong Yun and pang Hao had seen Xia ruofei socializing outside.

They saw Xia ruofei chatting and laughing with the top tycoons of Hong Kong that they had seen on TV or the news. They were not at a disadvantage at all. MA Xiong and the others were even supporting Xia ruofei. They felt proud of him.

In the past, Xia ruofei did not seem to be in charge of the company and was kind to everyone. However, after coming out, they realized that he was the boss. Pang Hao felt that he might not even be able to speak properly if he was in a relationship with tycoons like MA Xiong and Guo Hongjiang.

Xia ruofei and MA Xiong sent Guo Hongjiang and the rest off.

At the door of the private room, he said to Ma Zhiming in a low voice,””Mr. MA, please wait for me here with aunt Huixin and Huanhuan.”

Ma Zhiming did not know Xia ruofei’s intention, but he immediately nodded and said,””Alright!”

Xia ruofei and MA Xiong returned to the party room after sending the guests off.

MA Xiong wanted to send Xia ruofei to her room and talk about the auction tomorrow. He wanted to order a piece of top – Quality truffle, one – headed abalone, and wormgrass from Xia ruofei.

It was not convenient for him to say this in front of so many people. If MA Xiong had made the first move and all the rich people present had made the same request, Xia ruofei’s goods would be split in half. Would the auction be able to continue tomorrow?

Seeing that Ma Zhiming and the others didn’t leave, MA Xiong couldn’t help but feel strange and asked,”Zhiming, why haven’t you left yet? You should bring Huanhuan back to rest soon! You still have to go to school tomorrow. ”

“Daddy, it’s Xia Sheng who asked us to stay,” Ma Zhiming said.

“Oh?” MA Xiong looked at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”yes!” Old master Ma, let’s talk in my room!”

Xia ruofei’s suggestion was just what Ma Xiong wanted. He immediately nodded and said,””Alright! Xia Sheng, this way please!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xia ruofei was MA Xiong’s Savior. Every time they met, MA Xiong would treat Xia ruofei with great respect. Although he was not completely respectful, he was still very polite.

Feng Jing and the rest had already gone upstairs. Although Xia ruofei had said that Liu Qian would be in charge of the auction, Feng Jing was still a little worried. After dinner, she brought Dong Yun, Liu Qian, and pang Hao to her room so that everyone could go through the process and details one last time to avoid any problems.

Xia ruofei and the four members of the MA family took the Presidential Suite’s exclusive elevator to the top floor.

“Xia Sheng, welcome home!” The Butler, Tony, was standing at the door of the suite. He immediately bowed and greeted Xia ruofei when he saw him.

Tony asked MA Xiong after he had finished his job.

MA Xiong nodded and signaled for Tony to open the door.

“Xia Sheng, please!” MA Xiong stepped aside at the door.

“Mr. MA, you’re my elder. Please go first!” Xia ruofei said.

The two of them pushed each other around for a while, but in the end, they still walked into the Presidential Suite side by side. It had two double doors and was very spacious. It would not be a problem for four or five people to walk in together.

After they entered the house, Xia ruofei asked,””Do you want anything to drink?”

“Xia Sheng, everyone just finished eating. You don’t have to work!” MA Xiong chuckled and said,”Oh right, you asked Zhiming and the others to stay. Do you have any orders for them?”

“Oh, it’s nothing serious. I just wanted to ask if Huanhuan has been wearing the pendant I gave her the last time?” Xia ruofei asked.

Tian Huixin immediately replied,”I always carry it with me!” He didn’t even take it off to sleep or shower. Huanhuan likes it very much too, and she won’t let us touch it!”

The last time Huanhuan was in danger, this pendant suddenly emitted a light and protected Huanhuan at the critical moment. This made the MA family realize that the pendant that Xia ruofei had given Huanhuan was an extraordinary treasure, so they naturally valued it very much.

Xia ruofei had heard about this from Ma Zhiming before.

“Huanhuan, can you show me the pendant?” he asked with a smile.

This pendant was Huanhuan’s treasure. Usually, even Tian Huixin and Ma Zhiming would not let her touch it. However, Xia ruofei said so, so she immediately nodded and said,””Alright!”

Then, he quickly took off the pendant and handed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled as he took the pendant. He gently touched Huanhuan’s head and said,”Be good!”

His mental strength penetrated the pendant and immediately noticed that the array he had set up earlier had indeed been activated once. There were very small cracks inside the pendant. Under normal circumstances, the pendant should have completely shattered after this protective array was activated two or three times.

MA Xiong and the others stared at Xia ruofei, not knowing his intention.

They had already guessed that Xia ruofei was a mysterious person. This could be seen from the fact that Xia ruofei had cured an acute cerebral hemorrhage that even the experts in the private hospital could not do anything about, and also cured Huanhuan’s autism.

These were not things that could be done with ordinary medical conditions.

And the magical effect of the pendant further explained this point.

Now that they saw Xia ruofei taking back the pendant, they were both nervous and excited.

Xia ruofei’s expression was very relaxed. His fingers gently touched the pendant a few times, and then he smiled and returned the pendant to Huanhuan. He said,”Huanhuan, wear it close to your body. Just like before, don’t take it off when you shower and sleep, okay?”

“Yes!” Huan Huan immediately replied. I’ll remember it! Uncle Xia!”

Then, she took the pendant and put it on herself.

“Uncle Xia, this pendant seems different from before. It’s so comfortable!” Huanhuan exclaimed after putting it on.
