Chapter 1050: A precious gift (2)

Translator: 549690339

No one noticed that when the Jade Leaf came into contact with Huanhuan’s skin, an undetectable red light shot out from Huanhuan’s body and quickly entered the Jade Leaf.

Huan Huan was immersed in the joy of receiving a gift. She felt as if she had been bitten by an ant and did not care at all.

Following that, she felt that she was even closer to the Jade Leaf, as if there was a connection of flesh and blood between them.

The child didn’t know so much. She felt that since this was a gift from brother RUO Fei, it was normal for her to like and be so close to this Jade Leaf.

In fact, Xia ruofei had just used his spiritual energy to wrap a wisp of genuine Qi and gently stabbed Huanhuan’s body. Then, he brought out a little blood and threw it into the Jade Leaf.

With Xia ruofei’s cultivation, no one present could notice him.

In fact, the MA family did not know that the most precious thing about this Jade Leaf was not the carving.

Although Xia ruofei’s spiritual power and a cultivator’s understanding of the way of heaven and earth far surpassed ordinary people ‘s, and the Jade Leaf he carved was indeed amazing, the most precious part of the Jade Leaf was the runes that Xia ruofei had carved with his spiritual power.

With the high – grade Jade as a carrier and the recognition of its master through Huanhuan’s blood just now, it was no exaggeration to say that this Jade Leaf was equivalent to Huanhuan’s other life.

Whether it was an accident in life, such as an unpredictable car accident, a fall from a high place, some premeditated injuries, or even a gun attack, the protective rune contained in this Jade Leaf could save Huanhuan’s life.

If those super – rich people knew about such a magical amulet, they would definitely fight to buy it even if they had to spend hundreds of millions.

The richer a person was, the more they cherished their lives. They had worked hard for most of their lives to earn hundreds of millions of dollars. Once they died, everything would be for nothing.

Of course, MA Xiong and the rest could not see the magic of this Jade Leaf and Xia ruofei would not specifically tell them.

He just felt that he hit it off with Huanhuan, and he did not want to win the favor of the MA family with such an expensive gift.

After hanging the beautiful jade Leaf on Huan Huan’s neck, Xia ruofei gently touched Huan Huan’s nose and said,””Huanhuan, you can’t take off the gift from brother ruofei no matter what. You can’t lose it either!”

Huan Huan nodded seriously and said,””Mm! Brother ruofei! I’ll be very careful!”

Xia ruofei nodded with relief. Then, he looked at Ma Zhiming and said with a smile,”Mr. MA, I’ve prepared gifts for old Mr. MA, aunt Huixin, and little Huanhuan, but I really can’t think of what to give you ...”

“Xia Sheng, there’s no need ... You’re already being too polite ...” Ma Zhiming quickly said. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Initially, Xia ruofei was only half – jokingly explaining. However, after he took a look at Ma Zhiming, a hint of undetectable surprise flashed in his eyes. He couldn’t help but take another look.

“Mr. MA, I do have a gift for you, but not now ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei looked at Tian Huixin with a strange expression, but he immediately looked away.

“There’s really no need for that, Xia Sheng,”Ma Zhiming said.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”you’ll definitely like this gift!” Mr. MA, how about this ... After the auction ends tomorrow, you can come to my room to find me. ”

Ma Zhiming still wanted to decline tactfully, but MA Xiong’s eyes slightly narrowed and he said in a deep voice,”Zhiming, there must be a reason for Xia Sheng’s instructions. You must remember to visit him tomorrow!”

MA Xiong was experienced and experienced. He noticed something strange from Xia ruofei’s expression and associated it with Xia ruofei’s magical medical skills. He immediately suspected that there was something wrong with his son’s body that Xia ruofei had already diagnosed. Hence, he did not dare to delay and quickly instructed Ma Zhi Ming.

In fact, MA Xiong was right about half of the time, but not all of it.

Although Ma Zhiming’s situation was a little tricky, it was not a fatal problem.

If it was Xia ruofei who had relied on the petals of the spirit Heart Flower to conquer the world in the past, he would naturally not be able to discover anything. However, ever since he had absorbed the massive amount of information from the human – shaped jade talisman, he would digest and absorb it whenever he had free time.

The knowledge in the Jade talisman had been imprinted into his mind, so the efficiency of his learning was naturally extremely high.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s medical skills could be considered to have reached a higher level. He was not inferior to an ordinary Chinese medicine master.

If it was supplemented with the assistance of mental power, his diagnosis could be said to be superb.

He seemed to have glanced at Ma Zhiming twice, but in fact, he was looking at the “look” in Chinese Medicine’s “look, listen, ask, and feel”. This word sounded simple, but in fact, it was broad and profound. A truly experienced Chinese medicine master could make a general judgment of the patient’s condition by simply observing the patient’s improvement, the condition of the tongue, and so on.

When Xia ruofei looked at Ma Zhiming for the second time, he secretly used his spiritual power. Naturally, he was able to spot Ma Zhiming.

Of course, Ma Zhiming’s problem was not life – threatening, so Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. He decided to help him solve it after the auction.

Ma Zhiming was known far and wide for his great filial son. He never dared to disobey his father’s words, so he immediately said,”I know, daddy!”

While everyone was chatting, Jiahua restaurant was also rushing their preparations and the dishes were served very soon.

MA Xiong treated Xia ruofei with the highest standard.

Many of the ingredients were expensive Taoyuan vegetables, and many of them were high – Quality ingredients that were flown in from abroad. The skills of Michelin star chefs were impeccable, so Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were full of praise for the taste of the dinner dishes.

This was the first time Xia ruofei had tasted paradise vegetables cooked by a Michelin star chef. It felt different. He was probably the one who had eaten paradise vegetables the most, but he still had a deep impression of those dishes.

The color, fragrance, and taste were all impeccable. It retained the appearance of the Paradise vegetables that made people drool to the greatest extent, and the freshest and most tender taste of the vegetables was also vividly displayed.

The same ingredients could be made differently by a brilliant chef.

MA Xiong, who was in a good mood after seeing an old friend, even opened a bottle of precious red wine. This bottle of wine was produced in Bordeaux, France. The brand was called Tummons. It was different from the Lafite red wine that the nouveau riche in China often used to show off. Tummons red wine was truly low – Key luxury. A 700 – milliliter bottle of red wine often sold for tens of thousands of dollars.

MA Xiong’s bottle of wine was produced in 1987, the best year in the history of tumons, and its price was even more shocking.

Of course, there was a reason why it was expensive. You get what you pay for.

This bottle of red wine had a unique taste. Even Xia ruofei, who did not know much about red wine, could not help but praise it.

The meal was naturally a joyous one.

After the meal, Huanhuan was still clinging to Xia ruofei. Tian Huixin tried her best to persuade Xia ruofei, and Xia ruofei promised to take her to Disneyland and Sea World after he was done with work the next day. She then said goodbye to Xia ruofei unhappily and left the hotel with her parents and grandfather to go home.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing returned to the Presidential Suite.

Feng Jing had also drunk a few glasses of red wine during the banquet, so her face was flushed red, making her look even more beautiful. The moment the two entered the room, they felt an awkward and ambiguous atmosphere.

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Feng Rao quickly said,””Chairman, I’m going back to my room. Good night!”

Then, she quickly ran back to her room as if she was escaping.

Xia ruofei felt a little relieved. He was not in the mood to enjoy the luxurious facilities in the Presidential Suite and the spa pool on the huge terrace. He went straight to the master bedroom.

After Xia ruofei returned to his room, he first went to the sauna room to steam for a while. Then, he soaked in the Super large Jacuzzi for a long time. He felt refreshed from head to toe before he got up and put on his bathrobe.

He thought of Ma Zhiming’s situation he had checked before the banquet, and his heart moved slightly. He immediately contacted Xia Qing in the space through his divine sense ...
