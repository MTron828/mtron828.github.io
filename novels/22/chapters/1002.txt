Chapter 1003: The “uncle” who is pretending to be young_1

Translator: 549690339

“Bang!”

Although the engine of the motorcycle was roaring loudly, the muffled sound was still very obvious. Even Xia ruofei and song Rui, who were on the other side of the road, could hear it clearly.

The rider was wearing a helmet. Normally, even if something were to hit the helmet, it wouldn’t cause too much damage.

However, after being hit by the “flying shoes,” the rider felt as if his helmet had been hit by an iron hammer. Although the outer shell of the helmet was hard and the inner lining was soft, the strong shock wave still made him dizzy, as if countless stars were flashing in front of his eyes.

The rider’s vision turned black, and he let go of the handle and fainted.

The motorcycle lost control and fell to the ground. The wheels were still spinning at high speed, but the body of the motorcycle had already fallen to the ground. Because of the inertia, the motorcycle was still moving forward, and for a moment, sparks flew everywhere.

The man in the back seat screamed and waved his hands, but in a moment of desperation, his foot got stuck in the motorcycle, and his body was dragged forward by the motorcycle.

No one would wear a lot in the summer, so the robber in the back seat was only wearing a pair of shorts and a T – Shirt. As he was dragged on the ground, his arms and thighs were torn open, and he couldn’t help but let out a terrible scream.

The motorcycle slid for a full seven to eight meters before the man finally broke free. He lay on the ground, groaning. The man who had been hit in the helmet had fainted.

The motorcycle slid forward for a few more meters before it made a turn and stopped.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye. Before song Rui could react to Xia ruofei snatching his shoes, everything was over.

Song Rui was still flabbergasted as he stood there barefooted.

“What are you doing?” Xia ruofei said calmly,”let’s go and take a look!”

With that, Xia ruofei ran out first.

There were not many cars on the road in the middle of the day. Xia ruofei crossed the street easily. With one hand on the barrier, he crossed the barrier in a very natural and unrestrained manner and ran towards the place where the two street racers had fallen.

At this time, song Rui came back to his senses and quickly followed.

However, song Rui’s running posture was a little strange. Yingying was wearing a shoe on one foot and barefooted on the other. The height of both sides was unbalanced, and it looked strange.

Zhuo Yiyi was already panting as she ran over. Xia ruofei picked up the bag from the ground and handed it to Zhuo Yiyi. Smiling, he said,””You threw this, right? Be more careful next time. ”

“Thank ... Thank you ...” Zhuo Yiyi said, panting.

Just as she reached for her handbag, song Rui also jumped over the guardrail a little clumsily.

Song Rui saw this and shouted,””RUO Fei, wait!”

After that, song Rui ran up to the two of them and said,””RUO Fei, how can you be so sure that she’s the owner? At least let her tell us what’s in her bag, right?”

Hearing this, Zhuo Yiyi’s brows instantly furrowed, and she retorted angrily,””Hey! Uncle, what do you mean by that? Do you think I can pretend to be the owner?”

“Uncle ... Uncle?” Song Rui was dumbfounded.”I’m that old? Hey! I’m only in my twenties! You’re actually calling me uncle?”

“In his twenties?” Zhuo Yiyi sized song Rui up and pouted.”Uncle, aren’t you a little too eager to grow up?”

“You ...”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui, amused. This guy had been so scared of AIDS that he had no appetite for food or water. He had no time to take care of his personal hygiene. He had not shaved for days and his hair was unkempt. His eyes were red and had dark circles. He did look old, like an internet – addicted otaku.

Song Rui touched his stubble and unkempt hair. Perhaps he felt that it was too late to save his image now, so he simply skipped the topic.

“Sister, even if you’re the owner, it’s normal for us to verify it, right?” he said, a little annoyed. Besides, we’re doing a good deed! Why are you so fierce?”

Zhuo Yiyi immediately said,”please don’t use the word ‘we’, okay?” I saw it very clearly just now, the one who did the right thing was this little brother. Uncle, it’s hard for you to even climb over the guardrails, so the difficult job of doing the right thing shouldn’t be suitable for you, right?”

Song Rui almost choked on the sharp – tongued Zhuo Yiyi’s words.

He held it in for a long time before he said angrily,””Do you know what weapon this guy used to knock down the speeder Union? It’s my shoes! Without my leather shoes, how could he be so courageous?”

Zhuo Yiyi subconsciously looked down and saw song Rui wearing a shoe on one foot and bare on the other. She couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Zhuo Yiyi laughed so hard that her body trembled, and the peaks on her chest trembled slightly as well.

Song Rui looked up and saw this somewhat erotic scene, and his heart couldn’t help but sway.

Earlier, Zhuo Yiyi had been running madly all the way here, so she was also sweating profusely. Her navy blue divkiest shirt was also soaked, and only the part covered by her bra was still dry. The part that was wet with sweat was darker in color, while the two round parts and the two shoulder straps were lighter in color, making them look more obvious.

Therefore, song Rui’s gaze fell on it subconsciously.

Zhuo Yiyi’s sharp senses detected song Rui’s gaze. She immediately clutched her chest, glared at song Rui, and shouted,””Hey! Uncle, where are you looking at?”

Song Rui was very embarrassed. This guy was well – known in the capital’s rich and powerful circle. He did not expect to show his fear in front of a strange woman in Sanshan city.

“I ... I’m going to find the shoes!” Song Rui said, looking a little embarrassed.

With that, song Rui hurriedly ran towards the shoe that had landed not far away. Zhuo Yiyi looked at song Rui’s back and made a face at him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

With song Rui’s example, Xia ruofei naturally would not look around. He looked straight at Zhuo Yiyi and smiled.”Actually, what my friend said makes sense. After all, we don’t know each other. Out of a responsible attitude, I do need to verify your identity.”

Zhuo Yiyi said magnanimously,”your words are much more pleasant to hear!” Unlike that uncle just now, his tone was full of suspicion, as if I was going to pretend to be the owner of the item to cheat!”

Song Rui was squatting not far away, putting on his shoes. After hearing Zhuo Yiyi’s words, his body couldn’t help but tremble again.

I just haven’t taken care of myself for the past two days. That kid, RUO Fei, is just a little whiter and taller than me! Both of us clearly wanted to express the same meaning, but why is there such a big difference in attitude? Girls nowadays judge people by their looks too much! Song Rui’s heart was filled with blood and tears as he complained.

“Thank you for your understanding!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“But I really don’t know what’s inside this bag,” said Zhuo Yiyi.”It’s because this bag belongs to my friend. But she should be here soon.”

As she said this, Zhuo Yiyi saw Song Wei dragging her tired legs and running towards them. She immediately jumped up and waved her hands.”Wei Wei! I’m here!”

Comparing the two, Zhuo Yiyi’s physical fitness seemed to be much better than Song Wei ‘s.

She had the image of a cute girl, but she had the heart of a tomboy. In terms of physical fitness, she was not inferior to men. This girl was quite interesting.

Xia ruofei also noticed Song Wei. He could not help but look surprised.

Where were they? He did not expect to run into Song Wei in such a big provincial city.

It seemed like this cute tomboy was Song Wei’s friend? Xia ruofei smiled as he waited for Song Wei.

At this moment, song Rui had already put on his shoes and walked over. He also saw Song Wei’s figure and could not help but widen his eyes.”A girl from the keeper of initial enlightenment? What’s going on?”

Soon, Song Wei arrived in front of the three of them. She was also drenched in sweat, and her pretty face was flushed from the strenuous exercise.

Before Song Wei could catch her breath, Zhuo Yiyi said impatiently,””Wei Wei, it’s all thanks to this little brother this time. You didn’t see him just now! He directly threw a shoe at him from the opposite side of the road, simply piercing through the Poplar from a hundred steps away! If not for the two little bastards, they would have been able to escape ... Wei Wei! Wei Wei! Are you even listening to me?”

Zhuo Yiyi said a lot before realizing that Song Wei was not paying any attention to her. Instead, she was staring straight at the young man who could shoot through trees with a hundred steps. The expression on her face was one of utter shock.

This woman ... Even if she saw a handsome guy, she didn’t have to be like this, right? The insensitive Zhuo Yiyi couldn’t help but Mutter in her heart.

Xia ruofei smiled and blinked at Song Wei.”Song Wei, I didn’t expect to see you again.”

Song Wei exclaimed in surprise and joy,”RUO Fei, why is it you? You were the one who helped us subdue the street racer gang just now?”

Only then did Zhuo Yiyi understand the situation. She asked,””Weiwei, you guys know each other!”

Before Song Wei could answer, song Rui walked out from behind Xia ruofei and waved at Song Wei. He said,””Long time no see, Song Wei!”

Song Wei’s expression was even more surprised. Her cherry lips opened slightly, and she was stunned for a moment before she awkwardly greeted,”Uncle ... Song Rui, you’re here too ...”

Although Song Wei was not used to calling a young man who was only a few years older than her uncle, she could not say that she and song Rui were relatives who were not even from the fifth server! Song Rui and song Qiming’s great – grandfathers were blood Brothers.

Even though song Qiming addressed elder song as “general” out of habit, Song Wei still had to address song Rui as “uncle” due to their seniority. When she was young, she had visited the song family as a guest. She was against calling a kid who was about the same age as her “uncle”. She had even been reprimanded by song Qiming for that.

“Hehe!” Song Rui chuckled and said,”just now, it was ruofei and I who cooperated tacitly and subdued the two street racers in one fell swoop!”

“Is that so ... Then I really have to thank you!” Song Wei said awkwardly.

At this moment, Zhuo Yiyi jumped out and pointed at song Rui.””Ha! Uncle, so you’re Weiwei’s uncle! Just now you were still acting young, saying that you’re only in your twenties, now you’ve been exposed!”

Song Rui’s face turned black and he was filled with grief and indignation. Xia ruofei couldn’t hold it in anymore and burst out laughing.
