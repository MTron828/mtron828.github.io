Chapter 1481: So you’re in Yuezhou (1)

Translator: 549690339

Zhuang Yan was a little embarrassed as he smiled and said,”Brother Xia, you’ve asked the wrong person. I’m usually a homebody. I haven’t even been to many places in Tanzhou city.”

“No way! Aren’t you a native of tan Zhou?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“She doesn’t like to go out and walk. She likes to stay at home to read books and surf the internet.” Zhuang Yan said as he scratched his head.

Xia ruofei asked without changing his expression,”aren’t you working at the cultural relics Bureau?” Don’t you usually go out to do archaeology work?”

Xia ruofei knew that the ancient tomb was not within tan Zhou. If it was in tan Zhou, the tan Zhou cultural relic Bureau would have participated in the investigation. That way, Song Wei would not have met Xu Yuan Yuan only now.

However, he just wanted to get some information from Zhuang Yan. Anyway, he didn’t know how long the two women would be talking for! He was idle anyway.

Zhuang Yan smiled honestly and said,”occasionally, there will be field archeological activities, mainly when some ancient tombs are excavated during construction. In this case, we need to carry out rescue excavations. In addition to this situation, some tombs have been opened by tomb robbers. We also need to investigate and excavate. Otherwise, for the sake of protection, we will not take the initiative to excavate ancient tombs.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”I understand. I heard that the Mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang in Shaanxi was filled back with soil!”

“Yup! The best way to preserve cultural relics is to seal them in tombs. ” When it came to professional things, Zhuang Yan would not be so stingy with his words.”As long as it is excavated and exposed to oxygen, no matter how good the protective measures are, it will be damaged. The Qin Emperor’s mausoleum that you mentioned earlier, the terracotta soldiers inside are actually all colored. It’s just that the moment they come into contact with oxygen, the paint on the surface is oxidized within a few minutes, resulting in their current appearance ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””You guys are quite professional in this line of work.”

“There are specializations in every field, and it’s actually just that.” Zhuang Yan said humbly,”actually, it’s quite boring in our line of work. Don’t you see that Yuanyuan has only been working for more than half a year and she’s already thinking about taking the postgraduate entrance examination? I’m just wasting my time in the unit!”

“I don’t think so! I find it quite interesting to hear you talk about this. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Zhuang Yan, tell me about some interesting things that happened at work!”

Seeing Xia ruofei’s enthusiasm, Zhuang Yan could only rack his brain to think about what “interesting things” they had in their work. However, their work was quite boring and there was nothing to talk about.

After thinking for a while, Zhuang Yan smiled and said,””Brother Xia, last year, there was an exciting event in the xiangnan cultural relics system. However, it was not in Tanzhou city and I was not involved in it. I only heard about it from others.”

Xia ruofei’s eyes brightened. He asked calmly,””Oh? Tell me about it!”

Zhuang Yan said,”an ancient tomb was found in Yuezhou at that time. The experts speculated that it should be from the Ming Dynasty. It was also opened by tomb raiders. After it was discovered by the villagers, they reported it to the higher levels. Later, it was discovered that the scale of the tomb was very large. The National cultural relics Department, Historical Museum, and the archeology Department of Capital University formed a joint inspection team to prepare for a rescue excavation of the tomb ...”

Zhuang Yan paused for a while, took a puff of his cigarette, and continued,””In the process of excavating the ancient tomb, something happened ...”

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. Song Wei had been unwilling to tell him the exact location of the tomb. Now that he had found out about it, he had narrowed down the scope to Yuezhou city.

“Could it be that the mummies in the ancient tomb have been resurrected?” Xia ruofei joked.

“No, I didn ‘t,” Zhuang Yan said,”but it was also a very serious accident. I heard that several archeologists who entered the tomb at that time felt dizzy and nauseated. They quickly ended the operation, but it was too late. I don’t know what’s in the tomb, but I heard that a few archeologists died of illness one after another ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh secretly. Zhuang Yan had indeed only heard rumors. Most of the information was not accurate. For example, one of the archeologists, Song Wei, was still alive and had just met them.

“Then ... What about the ancient tomb? How is it now?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I heard that the experts suspect that there is unknown poison in the ancient tomb, and they have not found an effective treatment for it yet.” Zhuang Yan said,”in order to prevent the spread of the poison and cause a large – scale epidemic, the Yuezhou government immediately filled back the ancient tomb and even sent someone to guard it.”

Xia ruofei could not help but frown. It seemed like it would take some effort to enter the tomb! Especially when he had Song Wei with him.

After Xia ruofei heard the news, he didn’t continue to talk about this topic. He didn’t want to arouse Zhuang Yan’s suspicion and he didn’t want people to link them to the tomb in xiangnan.

Zhuang Yan naturally didn’t suspect him. To him, this was just a topic of conversation after a meal.

At 10 pm, Yuan Yuan, accompanied by Song Wei, finally arrived at Xia ruofei’s room. She had asked Zhuang Yan to go home with her.

Xu Yuanyuan blinked at Xia ruofei and said,””We won’t be staying here to be the third wheel, but ... This room will be empty tonight, right?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
