Chapter 1603: Guye’s arrival (1)

Translator: 549690339

The girl at the front desk looked at Xia ruofei in a panic and said,””I understand, Secretary Huang ...”

“Wait a minute!” Secretary Huang said. I’ll come and pick him up immediately!”

“Oh ... I know ...” The front desk girl was a little confused.

Xia ruofei was not angry and just smiled at her. The front desk girl’s heart was beating very fast. She said with a little panic,””Mr. Xia, please wait for a moment. Secretary Huang will come to welcome you personally!”

“Why is it so troublesome ...” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself.”Can’t I just go in by myself?”

The front desk girl didn’t know how to respond to Xia ruofei’s words and could only maintain a polite smile.

Fortunately, Secretary Huang did not make Xia ruofei wait too long. In at most a minute or two, the Chairman’s Secretary had already rushed to the front desk of the company.

This Secretary of Ling Xiaotian’s had been by his side for many years. Unlike most bosses, Ling Xiaotian’s personal secretary was a man.

In fact, after Ling Qingxue’s mother passed away, a diamond Bachelor like Ling Xiaotian was in high demand. However, he was so deeply in love with his deceased wife that he was not even willing to put on a show at social events, let alone remarry.

Even using a male as his Secretary had become a tradition for many years.

Of course, Ling Xiaotian had more than one secretary. It was an entire team, and not all of them were men. However, his personal secretary was definitely a man.

This Secretary Huang was considered as Ling Xiaotian’s trusted aide, so he was naturally more familiar with Xia ruofei. As soon as they met, he smiled and said,””I was wondering why the Magpies kept chirping today! So it’s Guye who has come!”

“Brother Huang, when did you learn such a glib tongue?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”is uncle Ling free?”

“Since you’re here to visit, the chairman must be free,” Secretary Huang said.”However, shouldn’t you be more concerned about whether our President Ling is in the company?”

“Then, is Qingxue here?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“You’re in luck. President Ling is in the office today!” Secretary Huang said,”recently, she has been going to the next branch quite often. It’s rare for her to be in the company today to deal with some matters, and you just happened to come ...”

“This is called tacit understanding, understand?” Xia ruofei said,”let’s go in!”

“This way, please!” Secretary Huang stepped aside and asked Xia ruofei to leave first.

The two of them walked straight into the company’s headquarters. The front desk girl’s mind was filled with the fire of gossip. It turned out that this fair and tender – looking young man was actually President Ling’s boyfriend! Many of the male colleagues in the company were heartbroken ...

In fact, the front desk girl did not know that anyone with some experience in the company knew about the relationship between Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue. Only the new employees did not know about the situation.

Secretary Huang was half a step behind Xia ruofei and said,””President Xia, the chairman is meeting a guest. Why don’t you ... Go to President Ling’s place first?”

Xia ruofei replied,”I’m fine with anything!” I’m just here to take a look today. There’s nothing particularly important. Oh right, if you have something to do, then go! I’m not an outsider, do I need you to accompany me the entire time?”

“Alright, I won’t disturb you guys any further!” Secretary Huang smiled. President Xia, please help yourself!”

Since Ling Xiaotian was receiving guests, Secretary Huang could not leave for too long.

Xia ruofei arrived at Ling Qingxue’s office with ease. He knocked on the door lightly and soon heard Ling Qingxue’s clear voice.”Please enter!”

Xia ruofei pushed open the office door and locked it from the inside.

Ling Qingxue was in front of her computer dealing with an email and didn’t notice that it was Xia ruofei. Her eyes didn’t leave the screen as she asked indifferently,””What is it?”

Xia ruofei had a smile on his face. He leaned against the door and looked at his girlfriend.

Ling Qingxue was dressed in a professional suit. When she was at work, she looked a little intimidating. She was very different from a few months ago. This was also because Ling Xiaotian had deliberately increased her burden and trained her bit by bit.

Ling Qingxue didn’t hear any response and felt a little strange. She raised her head and looked over.

When she saw that the person who had come was actually Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue’s powerful woman’s aura instantly disappeared. She cried out in surprise, dropped her mouse, and stood up.

“Why did you suddenly come over?” Ling Qingxue said in surprise and joy as she walked quickly towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face. He looked at Ling Qingxue dotingly and asked,””What’s wrong? I’m not welcome here?”

“Where?” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I’m just a little surprised! Why didn’t you give us a heads up ...”

“How can I see my wife’s strong woman side if I say hello in advance?” Xia ruofei said with a smile as he pulled Ling Qingxue into his arms. He lowered his head and kissed her tender red lips.

Ling Qingxue’s entire body went soft as she responded to Xia ruofei’s kiss passionately.

After a long time, she finally got out of Xia ruofei’s arms, blushing. She said coyly,””You’re too bold! We’re in the company ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I locked the door when I came in!” No one will be able to enter ...”

“Looks like you’ve already planned this!” Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei and said,”ruofei, you’ve been out for so many days. Have you had enough fun outside?”

Xia ruofei touched his nose awkwardly and said,””I’m going to do some serious business ... I’ve gained a lot from this trip! I’m telling you ...”

“No need to explain! I was just joking!” Ling Qingxue replied,”I don’t care where you go ...”

“Really?” Xia ruofei said half – jokingly,”what if I bring you a few sisters? what will you do?”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”if you have the ability, then bring me!” I promise I won’t be angry ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue and thought to himself,”you’re just too stubborn. If I really brought a woman back, I’m afraid you won’t have this attitude.”

Xia ruofei was no longer a newbie in love. He knew when to listen to a woman’s words and when to listen to them the other way around. Of course, he was not stupid enough to think that Ling Qingxue really did not care about this aspect.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was silent, Ling Qingxue asked,””What’s the matter today?”

“I miss you!” Xia ruofei said without thinking.

“What else?” Ling Qingxue’s heart felt sweet, but she still said,”that’s not the only reason, right?”

“What other reason could there be?” Xia ruofei spread his hands and said. Then, he pretended to suddenly remember something and said,”Oh right, there’s one more thing!”

“I knew it!” Ling Qingxue pouted slightly and asked,”speak! Is there anything else?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s mainly because I miss my wife!” And then ... I brought some gifts for you and uncle Ling. I’ve already spent the money, so I have to send the gifts out as soon as possible! That’s why I’m here. ”

“There’s a gift?” The disappointment in Ling Qingxue’s heart instantly disappeared. She laughed and asked,”what is it?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and took out an exquisite jewelry box from his bag. He handed it to Ling Qingxue and said,””You can see for yourself!”

Ling Qingxue opened the box expectantly. When her eyes fell on the box, she couldn’t help but exclaim,””It’s so beautiful!”

This jewelry box contained a pearl chain, which was also made by Xia ruofei. Each Pearl was made from the best black jade and was almost the same size.

Other than making a few jade carvings, Xia ruofei made the rest of the black jade into pearl chains, rings, earrings, and other small accessories.

The handiwork of this beaded necklace was undeniable. It was definitely the peak of Xia ruofei’s skills during this period.

However, Xia ruofei did not inscribe any formation patterns on the Pearl chain.

His main consideration was to inscribe formation patterns on all of the Jade carvings. As for small items like the beaded chains and earrings, on one hand, they were too small and could only hold a limited number of formation patterns. On the other hand, Ling Qingxue already had a protective jade talisman, so there was no need to add a similar formation.

“Do you like it?” Xia ruofei asked, smiling.

“I like it!” Ling Qingxue put the beaded necklace on her finger and turned it around to admire it.

Her fair skin formed a sharp contrast with the Black Pearl chain, as if there was a Black Dragon on her wrist. It was visually impactful.

“Ruofei, do I look good in it?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said,”my wife is a natural beauty. She’ll look good no matter how she dresses up!”

Ling Qingxue’s heart was filled with sweetness, as if she had just drunk honey.

She held Xia ruofei’s arm and asked,””You said you’ve prepared a gift for my dad? What was it? Give us some information in advance!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s also a product of black jade!” This time, I came to Dian province to see the public Jade bid in Ruizhou. This black jade is the trophy of the stone gambling I participated in!”

“So you’re saying that you made this yourself?” Ling Qingxue asked as she looked at the chain in her hand.

“Of course, how else can I show my sincerity?” Xia ruofei said.

Instantly, in Ling Qingxue’s eyes, this beautiful string of beads weighed even more.

“Ruofei, let’s go and find my dad!” Ling Qingxue said,”I can’t wait to see the gift you’ve prepared for him ...”

“Just now, Secretary Huang said that uncle Ling was receiving a guest.” Xia ruofei said,”why don’t we talk about it later?”

However, Ling Qingxue stood up and pulled Xia ruofei’s hand as they walked out. She said,””I know, my dad’s guest is uncle du! It doesn’t matter, it’s not a business meeting. He and my dad have been friends for decades. This time, he’s definitely here to brag and chat, or to play chess!”

Since Ling Qingxue had already said so, Xia ruofei naturally would not stupidly insist on waiting. He followed Ling Qingxue out.

When they reached the door, Ling Qingxue let go of Xia ruofei’s hand. She was shy and embarrassed to be so intimate with Xia ruofei in front of so many employees.

The chairman’s office was on the upper floor, and there was an exclusive elevator in the company.

The Chairman’s private elevator was also available to Ling Qingxue. She led Xia ruofei into the elevator and the two of them quickly arrived at the floor where the chairman’s office was.

Secretary Huang had already returned to his post. When he saw Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue walking over together, he quickly stood up and went up to them.

“Secretary Huang, is the chairman in his office?” Ling Qingxue asked. In the company, Qianqian usually addressed her father as Chairman, and only called him ‘dad’ when she was home.

Mr. Ling, the chairman and Mr. Du are chatting in the guest room.” Secretary Huang said and then asked,”do you need me to go in and report?”

“No need, we’ll go in ourselves!” Ling Qingxue said.

Then, she brought Xia ruofei and pushed open the double door with the words “chairman’s office”...
