Chapter 760: Return if there’s a battle summon (2)

The security guards who dared to be on duty in such a place were all very bold. Xia ruofei glanced at them. The two of them seemed to have been playing cards in the house. The TV was on and there was a babbling opera.

“Doctor Lin called just now,” the nurse said,”these two want to see the body that was sent here today.”

One of the black – faced security guards laughed and said,””Alright, leave it to us!”

When the nurse heard this, she immediately left as if she was escaping. At least Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan were accompanying her just now. Now, she had to walk through the cold corridor alone. She wondered if her legs would be trembling in fear.

The other security guard looked at Guo Zhan and Xia ruofei, then went back to his room. The black – faced security guard pressed his fingerprint on the access control system next to the iron door and opened the mortuary door.

The light in the mortuary was very dim, and there were rows of body storage cabinets against the wall. Each cabinet had a blue number. Although the exhaust fan was slowly turning, there was still an unpleasant smell.

The black – faced security guard had been working in such an environment all year round and had long lost his fear. He led the two people to a body storage cabinet marked with number 23 and looked up at Guo Zhan.

Guo Zhan nodded slightly, and the security guard pulled the cabinet open.

There was a gust of cold air. Xia ruofei could vaguely see a person lying quietly in the body cabinet.

He took two steps forward. Although he already knew the news of old Luo’s death, when he really saw the body of old Luo, he still felt as if his heart had been stabbed. He couldn’t help biting his lower lip, and the muscles on his face trembled slightly.

Squad leader old Luo’s face was very serene. His eyes were closed, and his face was determined.

There was already some white hair on his sideburns, and there were fine wrinkles on his forehead. His face was completely pale, and he just lay quietly in the cold body cabinet.

The body had been disinfected and treated with cosmetic surgery, so the location of the fatal wound could not be seen.

......

Guo Zhan also stared closely at the body of the squad leader, old Luo, and gently said,”I was supposed to be the one lying here, but at the last moment, the old squad leader stood in front of me and took three bullets. One of the bullets hit his heart ...”

Guo Zhan’s voice trembled. Xia ruofei finally understood why the iron – hearted Wolf King was so emotional today.

A former squad leader who had been with him since he was a recruit, a comrade – in – arms brother who had been through life and death with him for more than ten or twenty years, and an elder brother who had taken a bullet for him without hesitation had sacrificed himself in front of him. It was already very strong of Guo Zhan’s mental strength that he did not have a mental breakdown.

Xia ruofei bit his lower lip and looked at the body of old Luo in silence. His expression seemed calm, but his trembling body revealed the extreme fluctuations in his heart.

After a long while, Xia ruofei nodded at the security guard. Then, he took one last look at old Luo and walked out of the mortuary.

The sound of the sliding track of the body cabinet came from behind him. He knew that squad leader old Luo would fall into the dark environment again.

Just now, Xia ruofei had a strong impulse to take out the solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals from his bag and pour it into the mouth of old Luo. He could not believe it, or rather, he could not accept the fact that old Luo had been sacrificed.

But in the end, his rationality triumphed over his impulse.

He knew very well that the dead could not be brought back to life. No matter how magical the spirit Heart Flower petal solution was, it would not be able to save a person who had already died. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After Xia ruofei left the mortuary, he walked forward step by step. Guo Zhan also followed Xia ruofei silently, not saying a word.

The two of them walked into the elevator. When the red numbers on the elevator started to change, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””Wolf King, I want to know the whole story! Who did this?”

“Blood Wolf, you know the rules. I don’t need to repeat them, do I?” Guo Zhan said calmly.

The moment Xia ruofei completed his retirement procedures, he was no longer a member of the Huaxia Army. He had become a local citizen. The lone wolf assault team’s missions were all extremely secret and difficult. Naturally, Xia ruofei had no right to know what had happened in between.

Xia ruofei suddenly turned around and stared at Guo Zhan with his bloodshot eyes. He said stubbornly,””Wolf King, I have no intention of violating the confidentiality rules. You just need to tell me who killed squad leader old Luo and leave the rest to me!”

A warm expression flashed across Guo Zhan’s cold face, but he quickly shook his head firmly and said,”I don’t have the authority to do so. I’m sorry!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with unwillingness. He punched the elevator wall hard. The elevator shook, and a clear fist – shaped dent appeared on the aluminum alloy wall.

Guo Zhan sighed and said,”sanguine Wolf, you’ve done enough to come in time and pull Xiao Ling back from the gates of hell! You’ve done enough!” We, lone wolf, will take care of the rest ...”

Ding! Ding!

The elevator reached the sixth floor.

The two of them walked out of the elevator. Xia ruofei grabbed Guo Zhan and said,””Wolf King, remember that I’m here ...”

His voice was a little loud in a moment of desperation. The two nurses leaned over and looked over. Xia ruofei swallowed the rest of his words.

He pulled Guo Zhan to the balcony where the two of them had just smoked, then lowered his voice a little and continued,””Wolf King, do you remember the oath I made when I bid farewell to the military flag a year ago?”
