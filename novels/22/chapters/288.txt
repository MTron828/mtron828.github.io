Chapter 289: One person holding the field (1)

Except for the black – shirted man who was shot, everyone else was silent. Xia ruofei took control of the situation with a shot without hesitation. A cold smile hung on the corner of his mouth as he slowly raised his hand again. The black muzzle of the gun was pointed at Wu De, who was in the crowd. This guy was wearing a beige Tang suit, and he was too obvious a target among a group of black – clothed men. Wu De was so scared that he quickly hid behind his two underlings and shouted,””Don’t mess around! You have to pay with your life for killing someone!” The two underlings ‘faces turned green. They were also afraid of death! How could they not be afraid when they had to face the dark muzzles of the guns and act as shields for their boss? However, the two of them did not dare to move away because they knew how ruthless brother de was. If they moved away at this time, they would definitely be tortured by brother de after this matter was over. The two men’s faces were as pale as paper. They looked at Xia ruofei with trembling bodies and pleading expressions. Xia ruofei sneered,”a life for a life?” This old man has killed many people, but no one has ever made me pay with my life!” Xia ruofei was telling the truth. In his seven years in the military, he had killed many people. However, most of them were drug dealers or terrorists who deserved to die. However, to Wu De, these words had another meaning. This kid was really a Desperado! This thought emerged in Wu De’s mind at the first moment. He cursed in his heart, why am I so unlucky? How did that old man Li know such a ruthless person?! Old man Li has no background at all. His relatives and friends are all ordinary people! Where did this kid come from? At this time, Xia ruofei’s hand that was holding the gun moved slightly. Once the gun was pointed at the Men in Black, they immediately dodged to the side in fear. In an instant, these Men in Black felt threatened and wanted to turn around and run. Xia ruofei said indifferently,”back off, all of you. Why are you surrounding his shop?” As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, the group of men in Black immediately retreated far away. However, without Wu De’s order, they did not dare to escape. Wu De had several underlings as meat shields, and his heart was a little more at ease. “Brother, we don’t mean to offend you. We just want to ask old Mr. Li to cooperate with us ...” He shouted at the top of his voice. Xia ruofei pointed at the deformed rolling curtain Door behind him and sneered.””Is this how you invite people to cooperate?” Then, Xia ruofei picked his nose and said leisurely,””I think I heard someone say that the person who beat up his little brother should come out and die! I’m the one who beat him up, and now that I’m out, I’m ready to die!” Wu De’s face alternated between red and white. He felt extremely embarrassed. He gritted his teeth and shouted,”brother, we’re all from the underworld. Tell me your name!” Maybe we have some history!” Xia ruofei laughed,”from the underworld?” That Dao? Is it Jianguo Avenue or Red Star Avenue?” Wu De snorted coldly and said,”a straightforward person doesn’t resort to insinuations. Today, I, Wu De, have failed to recognize Mount Tai. What do you want, brother? just lay out the rules!” “I don’t want anything!” Xia ruofei smiled innocently and said,”I just heard someone bragging that there’s a super cool brother de here. I really want to get to know him!” “I’m Wu De! Friends in the underworld, please give me some face and call me brother de!” Wu De said,”brother, do you have any advice for me?” “Why am I the one looking for you? Didn’t you bring your men here to teach me a lesson?” Xia ruofei said calmly,”brother de, you’re so awesome. Why don’t you come out and have a fight with me?” I promise I won’t use a gun!” Wu De’s expression turned even uglier. The gun in Xia ruofei’s hand was extremely glaring to him. As long as the gun was in Xia ruofei’s hand, he would not dare to go out! If Xia ruofei was a hothead, wouldn’t he be dead if he shot him? Bullets don’t have eyes! Wu De had been in society for so many years, and it was not easy for him to have his current wealth and status. Naturally, he cherished his life more and more. “Brother, since you don’t have any advice, we’ll go back.” Wu De said with a cold face,”we admit defeat for today’s matter! I won’t bother old Mister li anymore. ” “Let’s go!”Wu De waved his hand and said. At this moment, Xia ruofei said indifferently,””Did I let you go?” Although his voice was very calm, it carried a cold killing intent, causing the hearts of the Men in Black to tremble. Wu De’s heart also inexplicably palpitated. He was even more certain that this young man in front of him was a Desperado. Only people whose hands had been stained with blood would have this kind of murderous aura. Wu De gritted his teeth, turned his head and said,”brother, I advise you not to go too far!” Leave a line in your work, and we’ll meet in the future!” “I’m not glass! I have no interest in meeting you!” Xia ruofei said,”since you’re here today, don’t leave! Just stay here obediently!” Wu De’s expression changed drastically, and his voice turned cold. He said,””Brother, don’t tell me you think you’re invincible just because you have a gun in your hand! I have more than a hundred brothers here! Don’t tell me you have an endless supply of bullets?” Wu De’s threat was very obvious. He meant that if Xia ruofei continued to force him, he would have to fight to the death. If it really came to that, with more than a hundred people rushing at him at the same time, even if Xia ruofei hit every single one of them, he would not be able to hit many of them. After all, there was a limit to the number of bullets. However, Xia ruofei’s expression did not change. He still had a relaxed smile on his face and said,””You can try!” “What do you want?” Wu De asked angrily. “Are your ears covered in shit?” Xia ruofei said rudely,”I want all of you to stay where you are. Whoever dares to move, my bullets have no eyes!” “You ...” Wu De’s eyes were filled with smoke.”I advise you to stop while you’re ahead!” It looks like you’ve taken a few lives. If the police call you, I’m afraid you won’t be able to handle it, right?” “You don’t have to worry about this!” Xia ruofei said indifferently. In fact, Xia ruofei was still worried. If so many people rushed over recklessly, he would not be able to control the situation and elder song might be in danger. However, he, who had a strong psychological quality, still showed a relaxed and casual expression. Wu De could not see it at all. However, Wu De’s casual remark just now reminded him of something. He immediately gave a look to one of his underlings next to him and made a phone call gesture with his hand. The underling immediately nodded slightly in understanding. Under the cover of the Men in Black, the underling quietly took out his phone and dialed 110. At the same time, the atmosphere in Songping city and the city of Wuyishan City became extremely tense because of what had happened in this remote town ...Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
