“Things haven’t even started!” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”even if we recruit her, giving her the position of Administrative Director is the best we can do. After that, it will still depend on her performance. If she is promoted too quickly, what will the elders think? Let’s not talk about the others, but Xiao Qiang was the first to be unconvinced!”

As the company grew bigger, Xia ruofei’s considerations became more and more comprehensive. After all, the company was like a small society. Sometimes, they needed to know how to manage things.

The Paradise Corporation was different from other companies. As long as Xia ruofei was there, even if he started a new company, it would still be successful. To put it bluntly, the core competitive force was Xia ruofei. However, this did not mean that he could completely ignore the rules of the company’s management.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have had to hire a high – Level professional manager like Feng Jing, nor would he have had to get Feng Jing to look for candidates everywhere for a few high – Level positions.

Feng Rao seemed to have absolute confidence in Dong Yun. She smiled and said,”If we can successfully recruit Dong Yun, I believe she will soon prove her strength. Even if she becomes the Vice President, she will definitely make others speechless.”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”then I’ll wait and see!” But the most important thing now is to get in touch with her. What if she doesn’t like a small company like ours?”

Feng Rao chuckled,”ruofei, this isn’t like you!” Haven’t you always been very confident?”

“Confidence can’t be eaten, but it can’t stop others from being biased!” Xia ruofei said helplessly.

“Alright ...” Feng Jing said with a smile,”I’ll do my best!” Just wait for my good news!”

Then, Feng Rao exhaled and said,””I’ve finally finished reporting my work! You can also be liberated! Why don’t you go back and rest! I’m going back to my office too ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”let’s have some tea before we leave!” This tea is really not bad ...”

Feng Rao glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Don’t be so fake! You can’t wait for me to leave! You’ve already found me annoying just now ...”

Xia ruofei laughed in embarrassment.”To be honest, you’re still very cute when you’re not talking about work!”

Feng Rao’s face heated up, and her heart beat faster for no reason.

She glared at Xia ruofei and stood up.””I find that you’re getting more and more talkative! I’m not going to talk to you anymore, I’m going back to work for you, capitalist ...”

Xia ruofei laughed as well. He stood up and walked Feng Jing to her office door. After that, he came back for some tea and cleaned up the tea set. Although there were professionals in the company who were responsible for the cleanliness of his office, he didn’t want to let others do such a simple task.

Then, Xia ruofei picked up his handbag and skipped work with a peace of mind.

Back at the villa, Xia ruofei played with Blackie and lightning for a while before returning to the house.

He had thought that he should clean the house since he had not been home for a few days, but he found that the house was very clean, almost without a speck of dust.

Xia ruofei shook his head with a bitter smile. It must have been ye Lingyun and his men.

He was going to be away for a few days. Little black, lightning, and the blood Dragon in the fish tank in the living room all needed someone to take care of them, so he left the keys with ye Lingyun.

Xia ruofei had absolute trust in ye Lingyun.

Of course, his biggest core secret was the spirit map scroll that was hidden in his palm. There was nothing to hide in this small villa.

Seeing that there was no need to clean up, Xia ruofei went upstairs to take a shower and sleep.

When he returned to his bedroom, he saw a thin layer of dust on the table. It seemed that ye Lingyun had a good sense of propriety and did not enter his bedroom at will.

Hence, Xia ruofei rolled up his sleeves and cleaned his room. He took a hot shower, changed into his home clothes, and went to sleep.

The next day, Xia ruofei patrolled around the farm, including the water tower at the hilltop, the water tower in the pomfrets cultivation workshop, and so on. He added some spirit Heart Flower petal solution without anyone knowing.

Then, he drove to the new headquarters of the company in Hengli building to check on the renovation.

Liang Weimin received a call from the foreman and knew that Xia ruofei had arrived at the balance power building. He put down his work and rushed over personally, making Xia ruofei feel a little apologetic. He kept blaming Liang Weimin for making a mountain out of a molehill, but Liang Weimin just laughed and let Xia ruofei complain without explaining.

The progress of the renovation was satisfactory. The workers were obviously experienced veterans. Furthermore, Liang Weimin had personally instructed them, so they worked very hard. Many details were perfect, and Xia ruofei was very satisfied with them.

Xia ruofei didn’t mind that the construction might be delayed because of the Spring Festival.

After walking around, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Uncle Liang, I’ll treat you to lunch! We haven’t seen each other for a long time, and you even dropped your work to come here today. I’d feel bad if I didn’t treat you to a drink or two!”

Liang Weimin laughed and said,”ruofei, I won’t be polite with you!” Since you’re treating, I’ll definitely go!”

“That’s great!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s almost time. I’ll give Ling Ji private kitchen a call and ask them to prepare in advance. We’ll drive over now!”
