2197 Chapter 1214 – willing to bet, willing to lose (1)

The two of them did not have a specific destination. Xia ruofei simply set a location on the navigation system and turned on the autopilot system. He brought Ling Qingxue to the deck of the flying bridge.

The view was the widest here, and there was also a control panel on the bridge. If anything happened, they could switch to manual control at any time.

It was still a little cold in winter, especially when the yacht was traveling at high speed. The wind on the flying bridge was also very strong, but the two of them were cultivators, so this cold did not affect them at all.

They really enjoyed the feeling of being able to sail freely on the sea.

They were far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and the vast sea was all they could see. It was as if they were the only two people in the world. This was a real world for the two of them.

Ling Qingxue was also very excited. She held onto the railing of the deck and shouted at the sea,””Ah ... I want freedom!”

Xia ruofei also laughed and shouted along.

After a long while, the two of them looked at each other and smiled. Xia ruofei put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s waist and said with a smile,””Wife, let’s go out to sea when we have time in the future! Relax!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head.

After sailing for about an hour, Xia ruofei stopped the yacht.

The weather was very good today. The cloudless sky was blue, and the warm sun shone down on them, making them feel very comfortable.

Ling Qingxue lazily leaned against the sofa on the deck and asked with a smile,””Ruofei, when are you going to catch a blue lobster for me to see?”

“Wife, you still remember this?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I must remember!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I’ll send you to and from work every day for a month, and I’ll get a Chinese perch every day!”

“You’ll have to win the bet!”Xia ruofei laughed.

Ling Qingxue shrugged her shoulders and said,”I don’t see any chance of you winning this bet!” Student RUO Fei, why don’t you just admit defeat? How about losing half of the battle if you surrender? “I know you have to go to Beijing to record a program at the end of the month. It’s a little too much for you to stay at the three mountains for a month ...”

“You even know that?” Xia ruofei asked in surprise.

“Sister che told me!” Ling Qingxue lifted her chin proudly and said,”how is it? Please consider my suggestion!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no need to consider!” My wife, since you can’t wait to lose, I can only fulfill your wish! Let’s go! Let’s cast the net now!”

“Really?” Ling Qingxue immediately sat up from the sofa.

“How can it be fake? I didn’t prepare many ingredients this time, so I’ll be eating seafood for the next two days!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go! I’ll go get the fishing net!”

Ling Qingxue immediately got up without even putting on her shoes. The deck was warm from the sun anyway, and it was very comfortable to step on it with her bare feet.

After Xia ruofei took the fishing net, he brought Ling Qingxue to the bottom of the yacht, where the last of the intimate platform was. He smiled and said,”Just wait and see!”

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”I don’t believe you’re that lucky!” I’m telling you, I’ve also specifically checked the information. The nearby Sea area is not the production area of blue lobsters at all, and the lobster’s range of activity is very deep in the sea. You were able to catch one with a net last time, and you already don’t know what kind of luck you have! I don’t believe that such luck can come a second time!”

Xia ruofei didn’t argue. He tidied up the net unhurriedly and then threw it out with great ease.

In fact, he had already prepared the blue lobster. In the past few days, he had specifically asked Xia Qing to get seawater, and then used the time array flag to quickly cultivate the blue lobster.

In fact, he had been out at sea for more than ten days, and the young lobsters attached to the blue lobsters he had caught had all left their mothers ‘bodies and settled down at the bottom of the space sea.

However, Xia ruofei had absolute control over every blade of grass and every tree in the space. With him taking action personally, the twenty to thirty young prawns naturally had nowhere to hide.

He scooped up all the young prawns and raised them in a breeding box with seawater. Then, he handed it to Xia Qing and asked her to take care of the young prawns and change the seawater for them regularly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

In any case, one sheep was chased, and a herd of sheep was also chased.

Xia ruofei wanted to make use of the huge difference in time flow to “mature” all the young lobsters. This way, he could quickly breed the rare blue lobsters in the space ocean.

The time array flags, in addition to the time acceleration effect of an Archean expert, could accelerate time to a maximum of 2000 times. Even if Xia Qing frequently removed the array and changed the seawater, these few days were enough for the young prawns to grow up.

Now, the young prawns had grown to the size of their mothers. Xia ruofei had put them back into the sea space so that they could live and reproduce freely.

Xia ruofei only needed one blue lobster today. If he wanted to, he could take it from the space sea anytime.

For the first net, Xia ruofei did not immediately take out the blue lobster. He used his spiritual power to sense a small school of fish passing by and threw the net over decisively.

This net was quite a good catch. Xia ruofei threw some smaller fish and shrimp back into the sea, leaving only a few fish that weighed two to three catties.
