2782 The return of the great weapon_Translator: 5496903The actual flight from Paradise Island to Barcelona in Spain was slightly longer than the actual flight back to China. However, with the Gulfstream G650’s endurance, it only needed to land in Australia to refuel once before it could arrive directly.

Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei were on the public jet named paradise. After about 15 hours of flight, they finally arrived in the sky above Barcelona.

Along the way, Xia ruofei gave the two girls the big bedroom in the back cabin. He was not thick – skinned enough, so when the two of them were resting, he only stayed outside.

Of course, the seat in the passenger cabin could also be laid flat and turned into a single bed, but the comfort level was not as high as the big bed in the bedroom in the rear cabin. There was no problem in resting.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue only left the bedroom in the back cabin when the plane started to lower its altitude. They went to the middle of the cabin and sat opposite Xia ruofei. They fastened their seatbelts.

Xia ruofei saw the two of them in high spirits and asked with a smile,””Did you sleep well?”

“Very good!” Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”the captain’s flying skills are very good. The plane was very stable all the way. There’s no difference between sleeping on the bed and on the ground!”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, you’ve worked hard! You gave us the bedroom, but you didn’t sleep well, did you?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”I can fall asleep anywhere. I can fall asleep as soon as I lay down. Besides, this flight seat is very soft and comfortable when laid flat. How can I not sleep well?”

The three of them chatted as they drank the freshly squeezed fruit juice served by the flight attendant.

The plane quickly lowered its height according to the standard entry procedures, built a slide, and finally landed smoothly on the runway of Barcelona Airport.

When Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue, and Song Wei passed through the customs and walked out of the airport, Zhou leiyun, Jiang Xiaochen, and Wu Lei from Espanyol club were already waiting outside to welcome them.

Originally, for such a big game like Espanyol versus bar?a, and it was also the Catalan derby, Zhou leiyun, as the club chairman, had to be present. Otherwise, the fans would also wonder why the chairman did not take the club seriously. If you don’t even show up in the stands to cheer for the team in a game against your nemesis, what’s the use of you?

Zhou leiyun had only needed to rush to Barcelona on the day of the game, but when he confirmed Xia ruofei’s schedule, he immediately put down everything at hand and rushed over from China in advance.

Jiang Xiaochen was Zhou leiyun’s spokesperson in the club, so he was naturally here to pick him up on behalf of the club.

As for Wu Lei, he was also invited by Zhou leiyun to welcome Xia ruofei because he had a good personal relationship with Xia ruofei.

“Chief Zhou! Leizi! Director Jiang!” Xia ruofei walked over and greeted him with a smile.

“President Xia! You’ve had a long journey!” Zhou leiyun extended his hands and shook Xia ruofei’s hand enthusiastically. Jiang Xiaochen and the chauffeur quickly took the luggage of the three.

“Brother Xia!” Wu Lei also stepped forward and greeted Xia ruofei with a trace of gratitude.

Wu Lei’s gratitude towards Xia ruofei was genuine.

At first, under Xia ruofei’s suggestion, he had his shoulder surgery brought forward and Xia ruofei had used the magical hands of youth to help him recover to the level where he could participate in training within a week.

After that, Xia ruofei taught him a set of very effective body – tempering movements. After he persisted in training these movements every day, his strength and body coordination had improved greatly compared to when he had played football in China.

Because of better coordination and stronger physical confrontation ability, Wu Lei was more confident when he dribbled the ball to break through. After using his own awareness to run for the single – Blade opportunity, his goal rate had improved a lot because of his better control of footwork and his confidence. He was no longer the “Wu who lost the single – Blade” who frequently missed shots.

More importantly, everyone in the club knew that Wu Lei and Xia ruofei had a good personal relationship, so they took good care of him. Some of the older brothers in the team were more enthusiastic about him in the locker room, so he quickly integrated into the team.

Of course, it was also because his ability was indeed worthy of the RCD Espanyol first team. Now, coach Ruby still valued him more. He was basically a regular main force. The most frequently used striker was the partner of Wu Lei and iglaisias.

He had just transferred from the Chinese Super League to La Liga and the platform had improved so much all of a sudden. Wu Lei thought that it was Xia ruofei who had given him such a good start.

Without Xia ruofei’s help, Wu Lei felt that he would have encountered more difficulties.

Xia ruofei chuckled and lightly punched Wu Lei’s shoulder.””Not bad! It looks like you haven’t been slacking off in your training recently. You’re obviously much stronger than before!”

Wu Lei chuckled and said,”training in Europe is more scientific. The nutritional meals are also matched according to the individual conditions of the players. In addition, I have been doing extra training, so I have made some progress.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei naturally knew what Wu Lei meant by extra training. He nodded in satisfaction.

Then, Xia ruofei introduced everyone to each other. Of course, when he introduced Ling Qingxue and Song Wei, he only said that they were his friends and that they were here to relax.
