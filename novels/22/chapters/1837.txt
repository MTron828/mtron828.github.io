Ling Qingxue’s face turned red as she said,”you’re underestimating me!” You make it sound like I’ll starve to death if I leave you!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”isn’t that so?” Don’t mention your cooking heritage. Uncle Ling is probably crying in the toilet ...”

“Nonsense!” Ling Qingxue flew into a rage out of humiliation and pouted.”I’m pretty good at cooking!”

“Haha ...” Xia ruofei blinked at Ling Qingxue. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ling Qingxue stomped her feet in anger and said,””Even if I don’t cook for myself, I can ...”

“I’m sorry, there’s no village or shop here, so I can’t even order take – out!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Who said I’m going to order take – out?” Ling Qingxue said,”can’t I just go to the staff cafeteria to eat?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and said,”yeah!” I forgot there was such a function ...”

Ling Qingxue immediately revealed a proud smile.

However, Xia ruofei continued,”it seems like I was worried for nothing ... Fine!” He still had things to do at the company! Then I’ll go back to work ...”

With that, Xia ruofei pretended to walk towards the car. Ling Qingxue hurriedly pulled him back and said,””Don’t leave! Didn’t you say you’re coming back to cook? As a man, you can’t go back on your words!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t hold it in any longer and burst out laughing.”Wife, you’re too cute ...”

The two of them played around for a while before Xia ruofei took the initiative to go to the kitchen to prepare lunch.

After he put on the apron, he stuck his head out of the kitchen and asked,””Qingxue, how’s your progress on memorizing the cultivation technique?”

Ling Qingxue frowned.”It’s more difficult than I thought ... Mainly because these words are too obscure. I don’t even understand what they mean, and there’s no pattern to speak of. I can only rote and memorize them!”

Ling Qingxue then said proudly,””But I’ve basically memorized it, just that I’m a little unfamiliar with it. I’ve been reciting it repeatedly! You can test me later!”

Xia ruofei cut the vegetables quickly and said without looking up,””You can recite it now, I can hear it!”

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue said.

Then, she started to recite the cultivation technique that Xia ruofei had written on the paper in the morning.

Although she stuttered a little, at least she didn’t make any mistakes. It looked like Ling Qingxue wasn’t bragging. She had memorized it, but she wasn’t familiar with it.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”not bad, not bad!” It seems like you didn’t slack off this morning!”

“I won ‘t!” Ling Qingxue replied,”who’s as lazy as you!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”continue to recite it a few more times. The more proficient you are, the better.” I’ll start explaining it to you after lunch. Once you’ve understood the meaning of this incantation, you’ll find that your memory has become very profound!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded.

After that, Xia ruofei did not mention anything about cultivation or talk to Ling Qingxue anymore. This was to give her an undisturbed environment.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had prepared lunch.

Because it was only the two of them, the portion was not much. There were three dishes, a soup, and white rice.

Ling Qingxue’s mind was filled with cultivation and she did not care about what she ate. As she ate, she did not forget to look at the piece of paper that Xia ruofei had left behind in the morning.

They finished their lunch very quickly. Ling Qingxue made Xia ruofei a cup of tea and started to clear the dishes.

The two of them had a clear division of labor. One was in charge of cooking, and the other was in charge of cleaning.

After they were done packing, Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue back to the bedroom upstairs. The two of them sat on the bed and Xia ruofei began to explain the meaning of the first level of the technique to Ling Qingxue.

Memorizing it in advance seemed to be helpful in understanding the cultivation technique. Ling Qingxue felt that the first level of the cultivation technique wasn’t as difficult to understand as she had imagined. It didn’t seem to be much more difficult than the introductory level cultivation technique.

After Xia ruofei explained it two or three times, Ling Qingxue had basically understood the first level of the technique.

Since officially cultivating the “Scripture of the primordium origin” required the cooperation of two people, and the control of balance was of utmost importance, Xia ruofei used the same strategy as when he guided Song Wei to cultivate. He first used his own true Qi to circulate in Ling Qingxue’s body a few times according to the meridians that she had been cultivating alone.

On the one hand, he wanted Ling Qingxue to have a more thorough understanding of the technique. On the other hand, he also hoped that Ling Qingxue would be more familiar with his true Qi.

This way, it would be easier for the two of them to cooperate during cultivation.

After that, Xia ruofei let Ling Qingxue start cultivating the first level of the “absolute beginning Scripture”.

Of course, Ling Qingxue was only cultivating by herself.

Before Ling Qingxue’s control of true Qi reached a certain level, Xia ruofei did not dare to take the risk and try joint training.

Ling Qingxue was naturally filled with anticipation and couldn’t wait to immerse herself in cultivation.

Xia ruofei also took out spiritual crystals and used this time to cultivate the great Dao technique.

Time passed by quietly.

Ling Qingxue only opened her eyes in the evening. Xia ruofei had also ended his cultivation at the same time and turned to look at Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue’s eyes revealed a trace of confusion as she said,””Ruofei, is this really the first level of the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “?”

Xia ruofei was well aware of Ling Qingxue’s doubts. He smiled and said,””Of course! It’s the real deal!”

Ling Qingxue revealed a trace of worry and said,””Then could it be that there’s something wrong with my cultivation method? I ... Why do I feel that the effect of my cultivation is not as obvious as the beginner cultivation technique I cultivated yesterday?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s right!” Don’t worry! This was a normal phenomenon! Because, strictly speaking, you weren’t cultivating the real “absolute beginning Scripture” just now. ”

“Then isn’t there a problem with the cultivation method?” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion.

“There’s no problem with the cultivation technique. It’s just that the cultivation method is a little special.” Xia ruofei smiled and explained,”actually, I don’t have much hope for the results of your cultivation. What I really care about is that you can improve your control of true energy through this cultivation. Besides, I believe that your control of true energy should be much better than yesterday, right?”

“That’s true ...” Ling Qingxue said.”I was so scared yesterday that my true Qi didn’t seem to listen to me. After a few rounds of cultivation today, my true Qi seems to be more obedient!”

Xia ruofei clapped his hands and laughed,”this is the effect I wanted!” Your talent really didn’t let me down! It would take an average person at least a few days to cultivate true Qi to the point where they can control it like their own arms and fingers!”

“But ...” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion,”you still haven’t told me what’s so special about the cultivation method. Why is the effect of cultivation so bad?”

Xia ruofei smiled and explained the key points of the “Scripture of the heart” to Ling Qingxue. He then said,””The most amazing thing about this technique is that if a person practices it alone, the effect will be worse than the average low – Level technique. But if two people practice it together, it will become a well – deserved top – tier technique!”

Ling Qingxue was smart to begin with, so she immediately understood what he meant.””I know! Only when you can completely control the true Qi in your body can you begin the joint practice!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded.”Try to run it a few more times. I want to see how well you can control your genuine Qi.”

With that, Xia ruofei reached out and took Ling Qingxue’s pulse, sending his spiritual energy into her body.

To a cultivator, it was extremely dangerous for someone to grasp their pulse while they were cultivating. However, Ling Qingxue had absolute trust in Xia ruofei. Without any hesitation, she immediately began to follow the mnemonic chant of the first level of the cultivation technique and began to absorb the spiritual Qi released by the spiritual crystal into her dantian. After that, she transferred the genuine Qi from her dantian into her meridians and completed a Qi circulation.

After a few rounds, Xia ruofei retracted his hand and smiled.””Very good! Qingxue, your progress has exceeded my expectations. We can start our first joint training tonight! However, before that, you still need to be more familiar with the cultivation technique. It would be best if your control of true Qi could also be raised to a higher level!”

“There shouldn’t be any effect in such a short time, right?” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion.

“Since I’ve suggested it, I naturally have a way!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”just you wait! I’m going to get something!”
