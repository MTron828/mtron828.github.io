Chapter 1242: Chapter 756 – each wave higher than the previous

Translator: 549690339

Feng Jing, who was standing at the side of the stage, had seen everything that had just happened.

A smile appeared on her pretty face. She felt that Xia ruofei was really too evil. He had played Blake like a fool. When she saw Blake’s expression, she started to doubt her life.

However, Feng Rao’s worry didn’t decrease at all. After Blake’s incident, the two pieces of white truffle had already been sold out. The piece that Blake bought was also a product of their fight.

The negative impact of Xia ruofei personally raising the price was still present.

Besides, if Blake continued to stir up trouble, the auction today would become a joke.

At this moment, Xia ruofei stood up and gestured for the staff to pass him a microphone.

Then, Xia ruofei took the microphone and said,””Ladies and gentlemen, some of you may already know me, but let me introduce myself first. I’m Xia ruofei, the chairman of paradise Corporation. Today’s auction items are all provided by our company.”

Then, Xia ruofei turned around and looked at Blake indifferently. She continued,””I just said that there’s no personal grudge between Blake and me. He once slandered our company’s reputation in public and doubted the quality of our truffles without any basis. He even has racial discrimination and publicly called Chinese people liars, saying that it’s impossible for China to grow high – Quality truffles. It’s been more than half a year since the incident, and he still hasn’t apologized!”

In addition to the rich and famous people from Europe and the United States, there were also many upper – Class people in Hong Kong who came to the auction.

These super – rich and famous people were all from the older generation of Hong Kong and were very patriotic. Hearing Xia ruofei’s words, they all looked at Blake with dissatisfaction.

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””This auction is open to the public. As long as you pay enough security deposit, you can participate in the auction. This is the Hengfeng auction house’s rule and I can’t break it. So, even though we don’t welcome Blake, we didn’t stop him from entering the arena. ”

“But!” Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,”I’ve said it before. I’m not willing to sell our truffles to such a person. I’m not even willing to have any business dealings with the Blake group in France. If he must buy it, then be prepared to pay a few times the premium!”

Xia ruofei stared at Blake and said,”as long as you participate in the auction, I will definitely raise the price. As for the price I will stop at, that will depend on my mood!” So, it’s best to be careful when you bid ...”

Blake’s face turned very ugly. He snorted coldly and sat in his seat without saying a word.

He had already lost all face today, and after returning home, he would be questioned by his family, so he was in a bad mood at the moment.

He had just bought a piece of white truffle at a sky – High price of 950000 dollars. He couldn’t leave the venue at this time, and he couldn’t go back on his word. He had paid a million dollars as a deposit! The Hengfeng auction house wasn’t afraid that he would break his promise.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s reasonable words, Feng Jing felt a little more at ease.

Although these remarks might not be able to restore all the negative effects, at least they could improve it and make their own voice.

Under such circumstances, it was already a great achievement to be able to do so. At least, that was what Feng Jing thought.

Just as Feng Rao thought that Xia ruofei had finished speaking and the auction would continue, Xia ruofei had no intention of sitting down.

He glanced at the guests and buyers in the hall and continued,””But no matter what, it’s my fault that the auction was affected because of this interlude. So, I’ve decided that the truffles that I bought because of Blake’s bidding will all be auctioned at a small private auction tonight. Friends who are interested can sign up with our paradise Corporation staff after the auction. You can participate after you pass the review. I also hereby announce that tonight’s private auction will be charity – based, and 10% of the proceeds will be donated to the Hong Kong Charity Association!”

After Xia ruofei said this, Feng Jing almost slapped the table and praised him.

This had basically saved all the negative effects. Xia ruofei also admitted that his fight with Blake had affected the auction, causing some people who really wanted truffles to be unable to buy them. That was why they were holding a private auction tonight so that people could still bid.

The so – called review, everyone knew that it was only for Blake. As long as the others had enough financial strength, they would definitely be allowed to participate.

Wasn’t the Hengfeng auction house unable to stop Blake from entering the auction? Then Xia ruofei would organize a private auction. It would be considered a small – scale social gathering. As the host, Xia ruofei would have the right to invite and reject anyone.

For those who really liked the Paradise brand truffles and wanted to bid, it was nothing more than waiting for half a day, and it didn’t have much of an impact.

Therefore, the previous negative effects were basically non – existent.

Even God would forgive a young man who was happy to take revenge.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s statement would add points to paradise Corporation. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
