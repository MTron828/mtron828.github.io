2344 Strike_After he changed his clothes, he picked up his phone and saw that he had a few missed calls.

These calls were all from the same person, Liu Qunfeng, the eldest son of elder Liu.

Xia ruofei pouted and threw his phone aside. He took out a cigarette and lit it up. He crossed his legs and lay on the sofa, not planning to return the call.

But after a while, his phone rang again. It was still Liu Qunfeng.

Xia ruofei calmly took two puffs of his cigarette and stubbed out the cigarette before answering the call.

“Hello, chief Liu.” Xia ruofei said calmly.

On the other end of the phone, Liu Qunfeng seemed to be relieved. He said,””Mr. Xia, did I disturb your rest?”

Xia ruofei hummed noncommittally and then asked,””Chief Liu, what’s the matter?”

Liu Qunfeng could do nothing about Xia ruofei’s act of pretending to be confused. Besides, he didn’t call to condemn Xia ruofei. On the contrary, he wanted to explain what had happened today to Xia ruofei.

“Mr. Xia, I heard that my sister came to your house to look for you ...” Liu Qunfeng said, a little embarrassed.

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei interrupted Liu Qunfeng and said,”I’m not sure! Chief Liu, I’m tired from the journey today. I’ll rest as soon as I get home. I’ve also told my subordinates to reject any guests that come to visit. That’s why ... I’m not sure what’s going on. ”

Liu Qunfeng was speechless. He did not know how to respond to Xia ruofei’s words.

Xia ruofei continued,”by the way, Secretary Liu, did you say that President Liu just came to visit?” I just entered the house! Boss Liu was really well – informed! Could it be that ... You’ve been monitoring my movements?”

Xia ruofei’s tone became unfriendly as he spoke.

In fact, this was also what he was most displeased about. He had not even entered the house yet, and Liu Lifang was already waiting at the door. Wasn’t this clearly saying that the Liu family had full control of his whereabouts?

Although it was easy for the Liu family to know the flight plan of the peach source, Xia ruofei was quite disgusted by their behavior.

Liu Qunfeng grumbled to himself as he smiled bitterly.””Mr. Xia, you’ve misunderstood us. We wouldn’t dare to monitor you ... It’s ... It’s like this, my sister just came back from another city today. She saw you at the airport, but before she could say hello, you got into your car and left. My sister is also concerned about my father’s condition. She thought that since you have returned to the capital, she would like to pay a visit and discuss my father’s condition. That’s the situation!”

Liu Qunfeng’s words were full of loopholes.

Xia ruofei had taken a public transport back to the capital. He had left the restricted area from the private plane building and did not walk out of the normal passenger passageway. The private plane building and the terminal building were still very far apart! How could Liu Lifang have seen it?

Furthermore, Liu Lifang was behind Xia ruofei. How did she reach the courtyard house in liuhai Lane before Xia ruofei?

These details couldn’t stand up to scrutiny at all.

However, Liu Qunfeng’s intention to show his goodwill was quite obvious.

In fact, Liu Qunfeng was also helpless.

Liu Lifang’s sudden visit to Xia ruofei was not his idea at all. He did not even know that Liu Lifang and a few other people had been following Xia ruofei’s whereabouts. They had even asked for the flight plan of the peach source through their connections in the Civil Aviation sector. He was completely unaware of all this.

If Liu Qunfeng knew about this, he would have stopped Liu Lifang. How could she do something so stupid? she must have a low EQ.

Liu Qunfeng didn’t know what to say. There were many people like Liu Lifang in the Liu family, all of whom were used to being pampered and domineering.

If it was any other person, they would not dare to provoke them. However, they did not use their pig brains to think about who Xia ruofei was. Could he spoil their bad habits? His intelligence was really low!

If Liu Lifang hadn’t called Liu Qunfeng to complain and even made a scene, Liu Qunfeng wouldn’t have known about this at all, let alone know that Xia ruofei had already returned to the capital. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He had reprimanded Liu Lifang harshly and had to clean up Liu Lifang’s mess while pinching his nose. After being mocked by Xia ruofei, he still had to smile obsequiously. What sin had he committed!

After Xia ruofei heard Liu Qunfeng’s explanation, he smiled and said,””So it’s like this! I really didn’t know, I’ve neglected your sister!”

“Mr. Xia, you’re being too serious,” Liu Qunfeng quickly said.”It’s my sister’s fault. She’s not sensible enough to visit you like this. ” I’ve already severely criticized her, so please forgive me, Mr. Xia. ”

Liu Lifang was already in her forties. According to her age, she should be more than enough to be Xia ruofei’s Auntie. However, after hearing Liu Qunfeng’s words, she felt like a child who had not grown up. No matter how she heard it, it did not feel right.

The image of Liu Lifang’s face with heavy makeup appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind. He could not help but feel a chill down his spine. He quickly said,”Forget it, it’s not a big deal. Chief Liu, did you come to me just for this? It’s not worth your call to explain! I’m not that petty. ”

Liu Qunfeng smiled wryly and thought to himself,”if I don’t make this call now, I’m afraid you’re going to ignore my house for a few more days!”

Elder Liu had been taking the pills that Xia ruofei had given him. Although his condition did not improve significantly, it did improve.
