Soon, Feng Rao gathered Jiang Hua, the person in charge of the pomfrets cultivation workshop, Xue Jinshan, the person in charge of the pharmaceutical factory, and Qin Xiaojun, the person in charge of making the iron – skinned maples, to the comprehensive office building.

The company’s administrative team’s supervisor was also attending the meeting. The company didn’t have an overseas business department yet, but there were people in charge of contacting Paradise Farm in Australia. These people naturally had to attend the meeting.

Xia ruofei didn’t beat around the bush. After he sat down, he went straight to the point and arranged the work. To these people in charge, Xia ruofei’s news was good news.

Hence, the atmosphere of the meeting was very lively. Everyone was very excited, especially Jiang Hua. He had been looking forward to new clam fish for a long time. When he heard that Xia ruofei would be sending in the clam fish soon, he immediately said that the cultivation workshop was ready to welcome Xia ruofei’s clam fish at any time.

After the meeting, Xia ruofei left the farm.

In the morning, the Dingfeng winery that produced the Eight Immortals drunk had already called him, carefully asking him when he could go to the warehouse to get the wine.

Xia ruofei wanted to do it today. He might as well finish the winery business today and bring back the iron – Skin Dendrobium.

Therefore, he used his spiritual sense to inform Xia Qing in the spatial space to prepare the fresh strips of iron – Skin Dendrobium according to a month’s supply. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Although the iron – Skin Dendi had already been transplanted in large quantities in the mountain sea realm, before the mountain sea realm could produce iron – Skin Dendi steadily every month, the iron – Skin Dendi in the Archean realm had not been eradicated.

Therefore, with the time acceleration of 30 times, Xia Qing still had plenty of time to prepare the iron – Skin Dendrobium fresh strips.

Xia ruofei arrived at the warehouse he rented in the city about half an hour earlier than the agreed time. Then, with a thought, he took out the Drunken Eight Immortals wine that he was going to hand over to the winery from the medium.

The one – month, three – month, and five – month bottles of wine were neatly sorted and placed in the warehouse.

As for the one year wine, the first batch of it was not yet up, so there was no one selling it on the market.

However, the Dingfeng winery would use wine jars of different colors and shapes as labels for the new wines they sent over every month. One of them was the one year Drunken Eight Immortals, so after the first batch of one year Drunken Eight Immortals left the factory, they would be able to produce a steady stream of wine every month.

Of course, the quantity of one year’s Drunken Eight Immortals was also very small. The monthly output was only 500 catties. According to the standard packaging of 500 ml per bottle, it was only 500 bottles a month. In the Dingfeng winery that produced one to two thousand tons of wine a year, such a small amount of wine was very little.

However, the rarer an item was, the more expensive it would be. This year, Drunken Eight Immortals had been selling his goods in an impressive manner.

The price that Xia ruofei had discussed with Ling Xiaotian was also very impressive. It was 8888 Yuan per bottle.

After calculating that it was about time, Xia ruofei took out the fresh iron – Skin Dendrobium strips that Xia Qing had prepared from the space and stacked them in another corner of the warehouse.

The winery’s convoy arrived on time, and the workers were already very familiar with the operation process. Very quickly, they unloaded the new wine in an orderly manner and loaded the “improved” drunken eight immortal onto the truck.

As usual, Xia ruofei asked the winery to send two more trucks.

After the two trucks loaded the fresh iron – Skin Dendrobium strips, Xia ruofei drove in front and led the way. The three trucks returned to the farm together.

Qin Xiaojun, who had received the news, was already waiting with his men. After they had unloaded the truck, they immediately threw themselves into work.

The next day, Xia ruofei went out again. This time, he brought a new batch of kun fish to Jiang Hua.

The rays in the realm were basically free – range now. Normally, rays would live in the sea of the realm. They were sea fish to begin with, and when it came to the breeding season, the rays would go from the mouth of the sea to the stream of the realm, mate in the right place, and lay eggs.

After the clam fish were born, they would return to the space ocean after they grew to a certain extent.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s mental strength and control of space were different from the past. He could still easily identify the size and condition of the beluga and use the invisible spatial force to wrap the suitable beluga and move them into the oxygen – increasing water tank without hurting them or alarming them.

Jiang Hua also threw himself into his new work happily.

The staff in charge of the overseas business in the administrative team was also in close contact with the Australian side. Once they received the specific demand for the seeds, they would immediately report to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had already informed the seed company he was familiar with in advance. The demand this time was a Little Big, and he had even specially sent a deposit of 100000 Yuan to them so that they could gather some seeds in advance.

Then, Xia ruofei went to the pharmaceutical factory for an inspection.

He saw that the pharmaceutical factory was operating in an orderly manner. Every day, boxes of heart – nourishing soup were produced and transported to various hospitals participating in the clinical trials.

In the clinical trial stage, these medicines were provided for free. It could be said that the manufacturing factory was burning money every day. However, Xia ruofei was still very happy.

Not to mention that this was a good thing to do good, even if it was purely in terms of profit, when it was officially put into production in the future, it would be listed as a heart – nourishing soup to guide the medication for autism, and it would definitely create enviable benefits.

Xia ruofei focused on the main computer that was completely isolated from the outside world.

His most trusted veterans rotated regularly and guarded the computer room 24 hours a day, including several access points connected to the production line and the main control computer.

After the inspection, Xia ruofei was relieved. These veterans were all loyal to their duties. The possibility of a leak at this stage was extremely low.

After two to three days of hard work, Xia ruofei could finally take a break.

Xia ruofei had not been so “fulfilled” in a long time. In fact, he preferred to be a hands – off shopkeeper. It was rare for him to be competent for a few days, but he felt uncomfortable all over.

Hence, after finishing some of the phases of the work, Xia ruofei started to slack off for three days and hang out for two days. He rarely appeared in the general office building.

One day, Xia ruofei received a call from an unknown source in Hong Kong.

He thought it was an employee of Hengfeng group sent by MA Xiong to confirm the quality of the one – headed abalone, so he immediately picked up the phone.

However, to Xia ruofei’s surprise, Tang He’s hearty voice came from the phone after the call was connected.””Little Xia, are you busy?”

Xia ruofei said in surprise,”Oh, it’s Mr. Tang!” Why? You’re back?”

Hong Kong had returned to China in 1997, so even though Tang He was in Hong Kong, he was still back in China.

“I’m here in Hong Kong to discuss a business deal.” Tang He chuckled.”I’m done with work today, so I called to ask you about the Phoebe zhennan wood. How’s it going?”

Tang He immediately explained,”Xia, I’m not rushing you!” I know that this matter can’t be rushed. It’d be best if there’s one, but it doesn’t matter if there isn ‘T. You can help me slowly find it. ”

Xia ruofei immediately smiled and said,”Mr. Tang, I was just about to call you!” I’ve already found the Phoebe zhennan wood, but I don’t know if it meets your requirements. Since you’re in Hong Kong, can you make a trip back to the mainland in the next two days?”
