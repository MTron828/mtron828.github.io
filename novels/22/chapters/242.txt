Chapter 243: Chapter 239 – coming in one after another (1)

Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei were sitting on a bench by the road. Ling Qingxue rested her head on Xia ruofei’s shoulder and asked,””Ruofei, can the leader you found really get our hotel back into the preliminary list?” “I think so ...” Xia ruofei smiled.”She’s pretty capable anyway.” Qingxue, don’t worry, I can always find someone else. I’ll do my best to help you with this. ” Xia ruofei was not a person who liked to talk big. He did not make any guarantees before the matter was settled. “En!” Ling Qingxue said softly. …… At the headquarters of the Ling Ji food and beverage group. Ling Xiaotian felt a little overwhelmed. He had received a call from the municipal Party Committee at noon that Lingyun hotel wasn’t on the list of shortlisted candidates for the primary election. He didn’t expect this to be just the beginning. In the afternoon, all of Ling Ji restaurant’s restaurants in San Shan city were suddenly inspected. There was more than one such spot check. The health Bureau had just left, and the Environmental Protection Bureau had come, followed by the Industry and Commerce Bureau ... The inspection team came to the door like a trotting horse lamp. Furthermore, these inspection teams were all nitpicking. They said that the kitchen rags were not clean, the kitchen hood was too greasy, the oil stove’s emission exceeded the standard ... In short, after their inspection, the well – known chain of Sanshan city, Ling Ji restaurant, became a classic example of dirty and messy. According to the severity of the situation, the customers would probably die after just one meal. What gave Ling Xiaotian the biggest headache was that the inspection team did not only go to one store, but also the same team. It was as if they were sweeping through all the Ling Ji restaurants. The outcome was a huge fine and suspension of business for rectification. The group’s public relations department was already very busy, trying to find ways to make connections. Ling Xiaotian was also sitting in his office with red eyes. He had been in the business for so many years, so he naturally knew that Ling Ji F & B was being targeted on purpose. Who was it? Ling Xiaotian’s brain was spinning rapidly. He knew that it was most likely Lin Wanshui, but he couldn’t understand why Lin Wanshui would be so against Ling Ji restaurant. Ling Qingxue didn’t tell him what happened at jingmi restaurant. He thought that Lin Feng didn’t like Ling Qingxue because of her cold attitude. In fact, other than Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue had been cold to all the other men. Now, it seemed that things were not as simple as they seemed. Should I give Qingxue a call and ask? Could it be that Lin Feng had touched her in the afternoon and was taught a lesson by Qingxue? Ling Xiaotian was a little hesitant. However, he didn’t hesitate for too long, because a new situation soon appeared. It was still a surprise inspection. However, this time, it was not the restaurant chain Under Ling Ji restaurant that was being inspected. It was the headquarters of the corporation. The people from the tax department came to the group and said that they had received a report that lingji F & B group had serious tax evasion and wanted their accounts to be sealed immediately for inspection. This time, Ling Xiaotian didn’t have to hesitate anymore. Ling Qingxue was the Finance Manager, and with such a big problem in the company, she would definitely rush back. Thus, Ling Xiaotian dialed Ling Qingxue’s number. Taoyuan farm. The phone rang. Ling Qingxue lazily got up from Xia ruofei’s arms. When she saw that it was Ling Xiaotian calling, she couldn’t help but smile and say to Xia ruofei,”Ruofei, my dad is calling. Perhaps the matter has already been resolved! It seems that the leader you found is quite powerful!” “Hurry up and answer it!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Ling Qingxue nodded and picked up the phone.””Hello, dad!” “Qingxue, are you still at Taoyuan farm?” Ling Xiaotian asked in a low voice. Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment because she felt that Ling Xiaotian’s voice was a little hoarse. He was clearly not in a good mood. “Yes, dad. What happened?” Ling Qingxue asked, concerned. “There’s a situation at the company. Come back immediately and we’ll talk in detail when you meet!” Ling Xiaotian said. “Oh, I know!” Ling Qingxue said,”I’ll be right back!” Xia ruofei also felt that something was wrong and quickly asked,””Qingxue, what happened?” “I’m not too sure. My dad said that there’s a situation at the company and asked me to rush back immediately. ” Ling Qingxue furrowed her brows.”I think it’s not a small matter!” Xia ruofei immediately stood up and said,””Then let’s go! I’ll send you back ...” “Alright ...” The two of them quickly walked back to the villa. Ye Lingyun had already cleaned Knight XV and parked it in the yard. However, he did not stay in the villa. Instead, he took lightning out for a walk. Xia ruofei drove Ling Qingxue to San Shan city. On the way, he gave ye Lingyun a call and asked him to look after the farm and the construction site. On the way, Ling Qingxue was worried while Xia ruofei drove very fast, almost at the speed limit. Soon, they entered the city and arrived at the office building where the Ling Ji restaurant headquarters was located. Xia ruofei was a little worried, so he accompanied Ling Qingxue to the elevator. The two of them heard Ling Xiaotian’s voice as soon as they entered the company. “Leaders, our company has always been operating legally and paying taxes in full. There is absolutely no problem with tax evasion. Is there any misunderstanding?” A strange voice said,””It’s not up to you to decide whether there’s a problem or not. We received a report, so of course we have to verify it. If there really isn’t a problem after we check it, wouldn’t that prove your innocence?” Ling Xiaotian said,”we’ll definitely cooperate with the inspection. However, can you make an exception? the accounts and financial computers have been sealed. We can’t carry on with our daily operations ...” “We can’t do anything about that! We’re checking your company according to the law and have issued a written notice. The sealing of the accounts and computers is also in accordance with the relevant regulations!” “Then ... How long do you need?” Ling Xiaotian asked helplessly. “We’ll see ... If we’re fast, we should be able to finish the investigation in ten days to half a month!” The man said indifferently. When Ling Qingxue heard this, she couldn’t help but pick up her pace. She almost jogged to the Finance Office. Xia ruofei also quickly followed. Ling Qingxue saw that the finance department was in a mess, and all the computers were sealed. She couldn’t help but ask anxiously,””Dad, what’s going on?” “Qingxue’s back!” Ling Xiaotian said helplessly,”these are the comrades from the National Tax bureau and the local taxation Bureau. Today, the joint inspection team came to our company to check our accounts ...” Ling Qingxue looked at the few people in tax uniforms and asked with a slight frown,””Leaders, I’m the Finance Manager of the lingji F & B group. Do you have any evidence? Isn’t it a bit of an abuse of power to seal our accounts and computers without solid evidence?”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
