“Then I won’t stand on ceremony with you. I’ll treat you to a drink when I have time!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright!”

While they were talking, they arrived at the lobby on the first floor.

A middle – aged man in a suit and leather shoes saw li Chenggong’s embarrassed look and was shocked. He quickly walked over.

Deputy Director Xu didn’t wait for him to speak. He directly took out his id and showed it to the middle – aged man. “I’m from the discipline Inspection team of the state – owned assets Inspection Commission. We’re performing official duties!”

The middle – aged man looked at li Chenggong in shock.

At this time, li Chenggong was completely disheartened. He seemed to have aged a lot in an instant. He looked at the middle – aged man with a dull look and shook his head with a bitter smile.

The middle – aged man immediately understood. He sighed and made way.

Xia ruofei walked to the front desk, took out a small stack of cash and handed it over. He said calmly,””I accidentally broke the glass door of the balcony. This is compensation for you!”

With that, Xia ruofei quickly followed and the group walked out of Shixin hotel.

Xia ruofei watched as Liu Zhe and Deputy Director Xu’s cars disappeared into the night. He smiled and said,””Done! President Feng, let’s go! I’ll treat you to supper!”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression. She opened her mouth but did not say anything.

However, today’s events made her feel very defeated.

She had been personally following up on the acquisition of Hengli building. She had done a lot of work but to no avail, and finally, she had reached a dead end.

And Xia ruofei had easily solved the biggest problem.

It was the same with the spokesperson of jaded skin cream. After the small star changed her mind at the last minute, Feng Jing was also in a terrible state. In the end, Xia ruofei solved it easily.

This made Feng Jing feel useless. She even felt sorry for her high salary and year – end bonus.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice Feng Jing’s abnormal behavior. He immediately went to a roadside stall for skewers behind Shixin hotel and ordered a lot of skewers and a few bottles of beer.

Xia ruofei was not a person who was greedy for enjoyment. He could drink a bottle of red wine that cost tens of thousands of Yuan, and he could also eat with relish at a roadside stall like this. Besides, he was born poor, so he felt more comfortable this way.

“President Feng, this restaurant’s food is really good. You should try it!” Xia ruofei passed Feng Rao a few mutton skewers and said with a smile.

Feng Rao was in a daze. She only came back to her senses when Xia ruofei passed her the kebab skewer and even shook it in front of her. She quickly said,”Oh! Thank you, Chairman!”

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Rao suspiciously and ate the skewer in a few bites. Then, he asked,””President Feng, what’s wrong?”

“I’m fine!”Feng Ye forced a smile.

“Wasn’t today’s matter resolved perfectly?” Xia ruofei said,”why do I see that you don’t seem very happy?”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but smile bitterly. She lowered her head and said,”Chairman, I just feel that I’m too useless. I can’t even do such a simple thing well. Last time, I screwed up the issue of being the spokesperson of the Jade skin cream. In the end, it was you who made up for it ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, and then laughed.””Why do you think so?”

As he poured wine for Feng Rao, he continued,””We’re a team! Wasn’t it only right for them to make up for each other’s shortcomings? Besides, everyone’s field of expertise is different. You’re a human, not a God! Don’t be too harsh on yourself. ”

“I just feel like I’m not capable enough ...” Feng Jing said as she raised her head.

“You’re still not capable enough?” Xia ruofei deliberately put on an exaggerated expression and said,”CEO Feng, your ability is in business management. Do you know how complicated the daily work in the company is? You’ve taken care of everything. I can’t even imagine how messy the company would be if you didn’t help me!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “You’re just lazy!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Xia ruofei said seriously,”it’s not that. Some abilities are born. Anyway, if you ask me to manage the company, especially when our company is getting bigger and bigger, I definitely won’t be able to do it. But you can do it with ease!” So, you really don’t have to belittle yourself!”

Feng Rao looked at Xia ruofei deeply and said,””Chairman, I didn’t expect you to be so good at comforting people!”

“I’m just telling the truth, okay?” Xia ruofei said,”CEO Feng, put away those nonsensical thoughts! I’m very satisfied with your work! Don’t even think about deserting! Our paradise Corporation can’t live without you!”

Feng Rao was touched and nodded,”Mm! As long as you don’t chase me away, I’ll always stay in paradise Corporation!”

“That’s the way!” Xia ruofei smiled happily, raised his glass, and said,”come, come, come, let’s have a toast. I wish the company a smooth success in taking over the headquarters building!”

Feng Rao drank a glass of wine with Xia ruofei and said with a smile,””You’ve already helped me clear the biggest obstacle. If you still can’t take me down, I’ll really have to resign!”

Xia ruofei laughed heartily.”No, no. It’s best if we can complete the acquisition. If the competitors offer too high a price, we won’t force them. If we have money, we can afford a house. Come, come, come, let’s drink!”

The two of them were eating and drinking at a roadside stall while chatting. Under the dim yellow street light, the two figures sitting opposite each other seemed so harmonious and warm.
