Translator: 549690339

However, he had to rent a high – Class car in advance. The Toyota Coaster should be good.

Xia ruofei scribbled on a piece of paper as he thought about it. For a moment, he forgot to make a call to an overseas bank to make an appointment for a transfer. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

By the time he remembered it, he realized that the bank over there should have closed due to the time difference.

Therefore, this matter could only be discussed tomorrow.

Fortunately, the time limit given by bojun real estate was a week. There were still a few days left, so he was not in a hurry.

......

In the capital, Zhao Yongjun’s face darkened after he finished his call with Xia ruofei.

After Xia ruofei had mentioned the incident with Chen shun at Tongren Hall, he had been suppressing his anger and scolding this B * stard. He was obviously there to find trouble! Xia ruofei was Zhao Yongjun’s brother. Since when could a mere purchasing manager bully him?

Zhao Yongjun sat in his chair, deep in thought.

It was fine if he didn’t know about this, but since he did, he would definitely help Xia ruofei vent his anger, and he would do it to his heart’s content.

Zhao Yongjun grew up in the capital. Other than serving in the Army for a few years, he spent most of his time in the capital. In terms of connections, he was even stronger than song Rui.

Moreover, he was well – known in the circle, and with his forthright personality, he had many friends.

Zhao Yongjun also needed to think about who he should find to do this with the least effort and complete it beautifully.

Names and their backgrounds flashed through his mind. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something. He frowned and tried to recall.

Then, Zhao Yongjun took out his phone and called Hou Liang.

Hou Liang’s father was the leader of the SARFT. Even though the SARFT was not an influential Department, Hou Liang was a decent person. That was why song Rui and Zhao Yongjun were willing to bring him along. Previously, when Xia ruofei flew to Beijing, she had hired a small – time celebrity to represent her in jadeskin ointment. However, when she changed her mind at the last minute, it was Hou Liang who had helped her settle it without saying a word. Now, that small – time celebrity was still in the cold storage, and her future as a star was basically ruined.

After the phone rang twice, Hou Liang picked it up. His voice was very enthusiastic.”Brother Jun! You’re looking for me?”

“Yeah,” Zhao Yongjun said,”liangzi, when we went bowling at Junhao last month, did you bring a guy with the last name Wei?”

Hou Liang was stunned for a moment, then he immediately said,”Oh! Brother Jun, you’re talking about Wei Jun, right? The one with a small split, the one who’s not very tall ...”

“Yes, yes, yes, it’s him!” Zhao Yongjun immediately said.

“What’s wrong, brother Jun?”Hou Liang asked uneasily. Did this kid make you angry? I’ll help you teach him a lesson!”

Other than this reason, Hou Liang couldn’t think of another reason why someone like Zhao Yongjun would suddenly care about Wei Jun.

This was because there was a huge gap between Wei Jun’s social circle and Zhao Yongjun ‘s. His father was only the president of a city – owned state – owned enterprise, and he was transferred from outside of Beijing. Wei Jun’s father, Wei Jianming, was so unremarkable even in Beijing, where there were many high officials, let alone Wei Jun. He had just entered Beijing with his father and had no foundation at all.

Wei Jianming had worked with Hou Liang’s father before and was even his leader for a short period of time. However, Hou Liang’s father’s career was much smoother than Wei Jianming ‘S. He quickly became Wei Jianming’s leader and was then transferred to the Ministry.

That was why Wei Jianming brought his wife and child to visit Hou Liang’s house as soon as he was transferred to Beijing.

Hou Liang’s father was quite a nostalgic person and took care of Wei Jianming. He also told Hou Liang to take care of Wei Jun more often.

Wei Jun had long yearned for the circle of the second generation in Beijing, so he was very respectful to Hou Liang. He had revealed many times that he wanted to get to know the big shots in the circle, and Hou Liang would only occasionally bring Wei Jun to some gathering activities with great difficulty.

In Hou Liang’s memory, Wei Jun had probably met Zhao Yongjun when they were bowling at Junhao. For such an insignificant person to suddenly call Zhao Yongjun in such a serious manner, Hou Liang felt that Wei Jun must have been insensible and offended Zhao Yongjun, so he was also quite scared.

Zhao Yongjun snorted and said,””Liangzi, you’re always teaching this and that, you’re from the underground society, aren’t you? I’m just asking!”

“Hehe, brother Jun, I was wrong ...” Hou Liang quickly said with a cheeky smile.

“This Wei Jun, his family ...?” Zhao Yongjun asked indifferently.

Last time at Junhao, Hou Liang had introduced him, but Zhao Yongjun didn’t have a deep impression of him. Every day, there were so many young children like Wei Jun who wanted to squeeze into their circle, so how could Zhao Yongjun remember to come?

Zhao Yongjun vaguely remembered that Wei Jun’s family seemed to have some connections with Tongren Hall, so he called Hou Liang to ask about the situation.

“Big brother Jun, Wei Jun’s father was transferred to the capital a few months ago. He’s now the chairman of the Tongren group ...” Hou Liang quickly said.

Zhao Yongjun’s eyes brightened. It seemed that his memory was not bad. Although this kid’s background was not that great, he was the most suitable person to do this.

Thinking of this, he immediately said,”liangzi, give this Wei Jun a call and tell him I’ll treat him to tea!” See you at the front gate of Xiangfu teahouse in half an hour!”
