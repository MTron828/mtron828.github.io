Chapter 1572: Tacit understanding (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei stayed outside the formation for more than five minutes. He calculated that it should have been eight to nine hours inside the formation, so he walked in again.

Song Wei was still sleeping soundly. It was clear that she had expended a lot of energy during her previous cultivation. It was only under such circumstances that she entered a deep sleep.

Xia ruofei did not wake Song Wei up. Instead, he sat down beside her.

Anyway, Song Wei’s cultivation speed had already exceeded his expectations. With the help of the formation, there was enough time. There was no need to rush.

After another 20 minutes, Song Wei woke up naturally. She rubbed her eyes and sat up on the sofa.

“Ruofei, how long have I been sleeping?” Song Wei asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and replied,”eight to nine hours!” How do you feel?”

“You’re in good condition! I feel like I’m filled with energy!” Song Wei said.

“Go wash up and have something to eat!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll put away the time formation first.”

“Ah? It’s better to keep it!” Song Wei said,”this will save us a lot of time!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this is not the time to be anxious. Besides, you can’t really think that one minute is equivalent to ninety minutes, right?” You’ve actually experienced 90 minutes of it. If you use it for a long time, you’ll age 90 times faster than others!”

“Don’t try to scare me!”Song Wei chuckled. To give the most extreme example, if I stay in the formation all the time, to the outside world, I may look like a hundred – year – old old woman in less than a year, but in reality, I have also experienced eighty or ninety years of life in the formation! It’s just that the time dimension is different for everyone!”

“Alright, alright, alright, you’re the most thorough!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”but you should go wash up and eat now. Also ... Your mother must have replied to the WeChat message you sent last night. You should at least reply to her, right?”

“Alright then!” Song Wei said,”but you have to quickly test the results of my cultivation! I can’t help but shiver at the thought of the evil poison in my body ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded in agreement. Then, he waved his hand and kept the array flag.

Song Wei saw Xia ruofei wave his hand and the array flag flew to his hand. She could not help but look envious.

It was nine in the morning, not too early or too late. Hence, Xia ruofei and Song Wei did not go downstairs to look for food. While Song Wei was washing up, Xia ruofei made himself a bowl of instant noodles. He had not been in the array for long, so he did not feel hungry.

Song Wei called her mother as she ate her noodles to let her know that she was safe.

At around 9:30 pm, Song Wei finished her work and said,””Ruofei, let’s start!”

Xia ruofei nodded and set up the time formation again. Then, he pulled Song Wei to sit down with him.

He first checked on Song Wei’s cultivation.

She had been cultivating for almost an entire day and night, and the results were still very obvious. The true Qi in Song Wei’s dantian had strengthened by a lot. It was at least a few times stronger than when she had just produced true Qi.

Of course, this was also related to the continuous supply of spiritual Qi from the spiritual crystals. Even if an ordinary person had the talent, it was impossible for them to cultivate so quickly in the current environment.

“How is it?” Song Wei asked expectantly.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””The strength of my true Qi is already not bad. I should be able to try a joint training with him!”

“That’s great!” Song Wei couldn’t help but clench her fist and exclaim in excitement.

“Calm your mind ...” Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and said,”how are you going to cultivate in your current state?”

“Oh ...” Song Wei couldn’t help but stick out her tongue and laughed in embarrassment.

After Song Wei had calmed down a little, Xia ruofei sat down cross – legged opposite her.

The two of them pressed their palms against each other, and at the same time, both of them placed the spiritual crystal in their dantian.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”now, move your true Qi to your right palm ...”

Song Wei nodded her head with a serious expression and began to use the true Qi in her dantian.

Xia ruofei also transferred a wisp of true Qi from his dantian. He had already checked the strength of the true Qi in Song Wei’s dantian, so the amount of true Qi He transferred was about the same. This was the only way to reach an equilibrium.

The “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” placed the most emphasis on balance, and the two people had to have a very good understanding of each other.

Soon, Xia ruofei also transferred the genuine Qi to his left palm.

“Transfer your zhenqi over.” Xia ruofei said,”this process might be a little difficult. Don’t be in a hurry. Try it slowly ...”

The process of circulating genuine Qi in the body and releasing it out of the body were two completely different difficulties. Song Wei had never tried it before, so Xia ruofei was preparing for a rainy day. He didn’t want Song Wei to lose her confidence after one or two failures.

Song Wei’s talent was outstanding. After a while, Xia ruofei could feel Qi coming out of Song Wei’s palm and merging with the Qi that he had stored in her palm.

The next moment was the most crucial.

Xia ruofei’s voice was steady.”Next, let’s merge the two strands of true energy together. Then, I will first guide the true energy to circulate in my body according to the route of the technique. Then, this strand of true energy will pass through my right palm and return to your body through your left hand ... You will be in charge of the second half of the process!” So, you have to pay attention to your feelings for the first half of the journey ...” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
