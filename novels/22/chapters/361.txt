Chapter 362: Light at the end of the tunnel (3)

Chen Dong’s cheers also exploded in the entire venue, and the area where the students from Agricultural University were gathered became a sea of jubilation.

On the contrary, the side of the three mountains University was dead silent. Everyone could not accept this result.

He had lost, and he had lost so badly that he didn’t even get a bronze prize.

How did this happen?

This didn’t make sense ...

Everyone’s heart was filled with mixed feelings. There was unwillingness, resentment, helplessness, and confusion ...

Only Xia ruofei was looking at professor Tian who was still smiling on the stands.

Just as the cheers and celebrations were getting louder and louder, Chen dongbai spoke into the microphone,”Students! Students! Everyone, please quiet down!”

Chen dongbai called out a few times before the crowd slowly quieted down. An awkward smile appeared on his face. He didn’t expect the students to be so enthusiastic. They didn’t even say a word before they started cheering.

Yes, Chen dongbai hadn’t finished his sentence.

When he saw that everyone had gradually quieted down, he continued to speak into the microphone,””Students, please let me finish! The quality of the flowers and plants that everyone had brought to this year’s flower exhibition was very high. The overall level was much higher than the last flower and plant exhibition two years ago. In particular, the quality of the two pots of flowers is comparable and quite excellent. The experts and teachers of our Evaluation Committee have been arguing about these two pots of flowers, which is why it took so long in the final selection stage. ”

When Chen dongbai said this, the audience was already very quiet. Everyone was listening quite seriously.

Chen Song from Agricultural University seemed to have realized that something was not right. ‘This President Chen seems to be implying something ...’

On the side of the three mountains University, everyone’s despairing mood was somewhat revived at this moment. Could it be ...

As expected, Chen dongbai continued,”In the end, our expert judges reached a unified opinion. One of the two pots of flowers is yang suhe from Agriculture and Forestry University, and the other is the Jade lion Molan from Sanshan University. In the end, our opinion is that the two pots of flowers are tied for first place, so there are actually two gold medals in this year’s flower exhibition. Congratulations, Agriculture and Forestry University! Congratulations to the three mountains University!”

Chen dongbai finished his sentence in one breath. He didn’t dare to keep them in suspense any longer, in case he was interrupted by the excited students. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As soon as Chen dongbai’s words fell, the students from Agricultural University looked at each other. How did they get a tied gold medal?

Originally, they had won the only Gold Award and a Silver Award. It could be said that they were unparalleled in their glory. Now, this most valuable award had to be shared with Sanshan University. It was as if half of what originally belonged to them had been snatched away by someone else. Naturally, everyone was very unhappy.

Naturally, Chen Song was the most displeased. He had thought that he had already won the bet, and that he had completely won the pot of Black Orchid from the three mountains University in Xuanji without even getting the bronze prize! He didn’t expect the final result to be a tie for first place.

After being at the end of their rope, Sanshan University did not expect to find a way out. Their mood rose from the bottom to the peak. This kind of surprise was far greater than winning the gold medal directly.

“We won the gold Prize!” Jiang Yue jumped up in excitement and hugged Xia ruofei tightly.”Brother Xia! We’ve really won the Gold Award ...”

Xia ruofei stood there awkwardly. He did not know where to place his hands and his body was stiff.

A young and shy girl was hugging him so tightly. The girl’s delicate fragrance entered his nose. To Xia ruofei, it was hard to accept this Beauty’s grace.

Jiang Yue quickly realized that something was wrong and quickly let go of Xia ruofei. Her face was burning.

The two of them felt extremely awkward.

Lu You, who was watching from the side, couldn’t help but giggle. Lu You’s laughter made the two of them blush.

Fortunately, Mo Lan had won the Gold Award. Everyone was overjoyed and no one else noticed this scene. Xia ruofei and Jiang Yue parted ways very quickly.

Everyone laughed and made a scene. It was as if all the hard work during this period of time had been vented.

But soon, Jiang Yue realized something. She frowned and said,””Brother Xia, Youyou, now that both pots of flowers have won the gold Prize, how are we going to deal with our bet with Chen Song?”
