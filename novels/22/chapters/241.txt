Chapter 242: Deputy Secretary Lin (1)

Du du du! “Please enter!” Lin Wanshui’s dignified voice came from the office. Xiao Mei pushed the door open and saw Lin Wanshui writing something. When he looked up and saw that it was Xiao Mei, he immediately put down his pen, stood up, and said with great enthusiasm,””Little Xiao! Come, come, come, please sit!” Xiao Mei was now a popular person in the office. Being the Secretary of the top leader was a very important and special position. Lin Wanshui was the leader of the office and was Xiao Mei’s superior in name, but he didn’t manage the Secretary. Moreover, Xiao Mei’s real direct leader was Tian Huilan, so Lin Wanshui didn’t put on any airs. The Deputy Secretary General, who was usually known for being strict, immediately became a generous elder in front of Xiao Mei. Xiao Mei hadn’t been Tian Huilan’s Secretary for a long time, so she didn’t have Wu Liqian’s aura, so she was a little reserved. “Thank you, Secretary General,” she said. Lin Wanshui personally poured a glass of water for Xiao Mei. Xiao Mei quickly got up and took it with both hands, thanking him again and again. Lin Wanshui sat down on the sofa next to Xiao Mei and asked,””Little Xiao, what’s the matter? Does Secretary Tian have any new instructions?” “No, no...” Xiao Mei said,”Secretary Lin, I have something to report to you.” “Oh? Go on. ” Lin Wanshui said in a friendly manner. “Secretary General, it’s about the designated reception unit of the municipal Party Committee ...” Xiao Mei said carefully,”I have a good friend whose hotel is very good in all aspects, but he didn’t pass the first round of preliminaries, so he asked me to find out more about it.” “Oh, really? What’s the name of the hotel?” Lin Wanshui said,”logically speaking, the possibility of this is very small. We all have clear standards! We also Welcome Hotels that meet the requirements to compete, so we can get more favorable conditions!” “Secretary General, there must be some misunderstanding! “That hotel is called Lingyun hotel ...” Xiao Mei said. Lin Wanshui’s expression didn’t change at all and he still had a kind smile on his face, but he felt a little gloomy. However, this kind of cunning official was able to hide his emotions very well and didn’t show it. Lin Wanshui nodded and said without changing his expression,””Alright, little Xiao, I understand. However, I don’t know the specific situation. You know that I’m busy all day, and I can’t ask about everything, right? How about this! I’ll go and check it out immediately. If the situation is true, I’ll add this hotel in!” “Okay, thank you, Secretary Lin!” Xiao Mei said with a hint of joy. Speaking of which, Xiao Mei was still too young, not as old as Wu Liqian. She had only been the leader’s Secretary for a short period of time. When she first entered the office, she didn’t know how to use Tian Huilan’s influence. Instead, she took the initiative to say that it was her personal matter. In fact, she could be completely ambiguous. Even if someone mentioned it later, she wouldn’t be considered to be working under the leader’s banner. In addition, her observation skills were not as good as Wang Xiao ‘S. Wang Xiao had clearly said that Lin Wanshui was personally involved in this matter, but Lin Wanshui said that he did not know the details. Although Xiao Mei noticed it, she took it for granted that Lin Wanshui was only concerned about her face as a leader. Xiao Mei’s judgment was that Lin Wanshui had asked the staff to kick out Lingyun hotel, which had no background, in order to shortlist another hotel. Now that he had come over to say hello, Lin Wanshui definitely couldn’t slap his own face, so he said that he didn’t know the situation and then corrected the mistake. This way, it wouldn’t hurt his face. And the one who would be eliminated would be another hotel without any background, and it would not hurt his vested interests. Of course, Xiao Mei’s misjudgment and Lin Wanshui’s shrewdness were also the reason why Lin Wanshui had been so friendly. When she said that, Lin Wanshui agreed without thinking. This gave Xiao Mei the wrong impression. Xiao Mei once again expressed her gratitude to Lin Wanshui and then politely left. Lin Wanshui laughed and personally sent Xiao Mei to the door before turning around and returning to the office. The moment he closed the door, Lin Wanshui’s face turned dark. Kicking Lingyun hotel out of the preliminary list was Lin Wanshui’s personal order. In the afternoon, his son, Lin Feng, was a little flustered and exasperated when he called him. After telling him about what happened at Jing MI’s Western restaurant, he was completely furious. This Ling Xiaotian really didn’t put him, the Deputy Secretary General of the municipal Party Committee, in his eyes! It was their fortune that Xiao Feng had taken a liking to his daughter. It was fine if he didn’t give them face, but he even acted two – faced behind their backs. He had agreed to it the day before yesterday, but today he deliberately put on such a show in front of the restaurant. This was a blatant slap in the face! Lin Wanshui immediately ordered the General Administration Office to directly remove Lingyun hotel from the list. Originally, Lin Wanshui had thought that he could knock some sense into Ling Xiaotian and make him bring his daughter along as an apology. As long as his attitude was sincere, this matter could be considered over. He didn’t expect Ling Xiaotian to find someone so quickly, and he even went straight to Secretary Tian’s Secretary, Xiao Mei. He didn’t have any respect for him at all! What could be tolerated? In fact, to put it bluntly, it was still Xiao Mei who didn’t have enough power. Otherwise, even if a low – ranked Deputy Mayor of the government came out to persuade her, Lin Wanshui would also do her a favor, let alone Tian Huilan. But Xiao Mei’s appearance made Lin Wanshui feel like his authority was being challenged. Although Xiao Mei’s position in the municipal office was like the sun at its zenith, her Foundation was still shallow. She was just a mere official level cadre. Lin Wanshui might be polite to her because of Tian Huilan, but when it came down to it, Lin Wanshui didn’t put Xiao Mei in his eyes. Hence, after Lin Wanshui finished smoking a cigarette, he picked up the phone on his desk and called the General Affairs Office. “Has the primary selection list of the designated reception units been drawn up?” Lin Wanshui immediately asked,”en ... Hurry up and send it over. Then, let Secretary Wu have a look at it as soon as possible!” After hanging up the phone, Lin Wanshui used his phone to call Lin Feng. “It’s me. ” Lin Wanshui said with a dark face. “Dad, what’s the matter?” Lin Feng asked. “Have you made arrangements for Ling Ji’s restaurant?” Lin Wanshui asked. The moment Lin Feng heard this, he immediately replied in a proud manner,””Don’t worry! This time, it’s enough for them to suffer. Industry and Commerce, taxation, Environmental Protection, health ... As long as it’s a functional Department that can manage them, I’ve already informed them, hehe! This time, we’ll let him know how powerful we are!” Lin Wanshui nodded.”En, go and rush them. Tell them to do it as soon as possible. It’s best if they do it today!” “Alright!” Lin Feng excitedly replied. Lin Feng was the most enthusiastic about causing trouble for Ling Ji’s restaurant. After hanging up the phone, he immediately started to contact people everywhere to pass down his father’s instructions. At Taoyuan farm, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were taking a walk after lunch. The two of them cuddled together and bathed in the warm winter sun, not knowing that Ling Ji restaurant had been targeted ...Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
