2778 Travelling together with America (1)

After about two hours of flight, paradise successfully arrived at Beijing International Airport.

After Xia ruofei let the flight crew handle the follow-up work, they were on standby at a nearby hotel. He and Ling Qingxue left the restricted area of the airport through the private passage for the public business plane.

Wu Qiang was already waiting outside the airport in the Elfa commercial car.

When he saw Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue walking out, he quickly walked up to them and called out, ” “Boss!”

Then, Wu Qiang quickly took Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s luggage.

Xia ruofei followed Wu Qiang to the parking lot and asked, ” “Is Song Wei here? ”

“When I set off, miss song had already arrived at her house in liuhai Lane. She should be waiting for you in the courtyard house now,”Wu Qiang said.

“Alright,”he said. Xia ruofei nodded and continued to ask, ” is there anything going on at home? ”

“Everything is normal!” ” Yes. ” Wu Qiang replied respectfully, ” other than the two people who came to your door some time ago, saying that they had a business deal worth billions of US dollars to discuss with you, no one else came to look for you. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,” okay, I got it!” I’ve already sent those two away, so they probably won’t bother me again in the future.”

Wu Qiang heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that. He had felt that this matter was a little unreliable from the start. Although it looked extraordinary and did not look like a swindler, a few billion US dollars was a little too exaggerated. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Wu Qiang had always been worried that the shop owner had been deceived, but he could not speak out to persuade him. Even if he were to ask, it would be a little presumptuous. Hence, when Xia ruofei took the initiative to tell him this news, he felt relieved.

After getting their car from the parking lot, the three of them drove back to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

It was the weekend, and it was not yet noon, so the traffic was not bad. It took the three of them about 40 minutes to return to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

The car stopped and the electric door slowly opened with a beep. Wu Qiang quickly went to the back and took down Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue’s luggage.

Wu Qiang’s girlfriend, Xia Xiaolan, and his sister – in – Law, Wu Xiujuan, who were working in the backyard, came out to greet Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei also smiled and greeted them. He asked,””Sister – in – Law, what delicious food did you prepare for lunch?”

“Boss, I’ve prepared some braised lamb, braised carp, and the Beijing roasted duck I learned recently. The main course is noodles with soybean paste. I’m not sure if it’ll suit your taste ...” Wu Xiujuan said quickly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I have absolute confidence in sister-in-law’s cooking!” Speaking of which, I’m really a little hungry. Just hearing the names of these dishes makes me drool!”

“Lunch will be ready soon,” Wu Xiujuan said quickly.”You can go and rest for a while. It will be ready soon!”

“Alright! You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, Xia ruofei said to Wu Qiang,””Wu Qiang, you should also go and rest! I’ll take my luggage by myself. There’s not much stuff. ”

“Okay, boss!” Wu Qiang replied respectfully.

Xia ruofei dragged the small suitcase and stopped after two steps. He handed the bag in his hand to Wu Xiujuan and said,””Sister – in – Law, please keep these fried buns in the refrigerator.”

These were the love fried buns that Fang Liyun had prepared for her daughter. She had kept them in the refrigerator during the flight, including on the way back from the airport. Xia ruofei had also stuffed them into the car refrigerator. He had promised Fang Liyun that he would keep the fried buns fresh.

“Alright, boss, leave it to me!” Wu Xiujuan said.

Only then did Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue pass through the corridor and the moon gate to the master’s courtyard in the middle.

Song Wei was also a cultivator, and her hearing was very sharp. She had already heard the footsteps of the two, so she walked out of the room.

When she saw that it was indeed Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue, Song Wei’s face broke into a smile. She exclaimed,””RUO Fei, Qingxue, you’re here!”

Ling Qingxue’s face also blossomed with a sweet smile. She pushed her luggage towards Xia ruofei, then quickly walked over to Song Wei and held her arm.”Wei Wei, long time no see. I missed you so much ...”

Xia ruofei was speechless. It hadn’t been long since they separated, right? As for this?

Moreover, whenever he was alone with Ling Qingxue, whenever he talked about Song Wei, Ling Qingxue would more or less feel a little jealous. Of course, this was normal. If it were any modern woman, they would not be as generous as Ling Qingxue.

“I missed you too! Sister Qingxue!” Song Wei said, blushing.

Ling Qingxue pinched Song Wei’s delicate cheek and smiled.””Our Wei Wei is getting more and more beautiful! You must have a lot of suitors in school, right?”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei in panic and said,””Qingxue, don’t talk nonsense! Who’s chasing me?”

“I don’t believe it! With your beauty, you’re also the campus Belle of Beijing University! How could no one be chasing after him?” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”I won’t say anymore, I won’t say anymore. A certain someone’s face is already filled with anxiety!”

After she finished speaking, Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and burst into laughter.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly.”How am I nervous?” He was clearly looking helpless, alright?

The three of them walked into the room together.

The heater in the house was on, and the moment they entered, they felt as warm as spring. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue both took off their coats.

Xia ruofei said as he hung up the clothes,””Right, Weiwei, I went to visit your parents before I came. I was worried that uncle song would practice the [modest Sutra] alone, so I went to check on his progress.”

“How’s the situation?” Song Wei quickly asked.

“Don’t worry! Uncle song’s comprehension is still very high. There are no problems with his cultivation, and the flow of his meridians is very accurate. ” Xia ruofei said,”I don’t have anything to correct him. I’ll just let him persist normally.” However ... He didn’t know that he was cultivating. He always thought that he was using the same kind of health – raising method as the old people in the park!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Song Wei smiled and said,””Isn’t my dad a little too slow?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’m not slow. It’s just that it’s hard to believe in cultivation if you don’t experience it in person. Besides, uncle song has always been a materialist. Of course, he should have noticed that this set of martial arts was extraordinary. After this period of cultivation, some of his chronic diseases had been cured. Even his hair had begun to turn black, and his strength was greater than that of a young man. Uncle song was a little scared himself, and he kept asking me if there was a problem!”

“Now that you’ve mentioned it, I really want to go back and see him ...” Song Wei chuckled.

Xia ruofei said,”Speaking of which ... Uncle song is really caring towards Auntie Fang!” After he confirmed that the changes in his body were normal, the thing he was most concerned about was whether he could pass on this set of cultivation techniques to aunt Fang. I told him that although this set of martial arts is very precious, it’s not a secret that can’t be passed on, at least not to him and aunt Fang. It’s just that even if aunt Fang learns it, it’s useless. If her physique doesn’t meet the requirements, she won’t even be able to enter the beginner level. ”

“Yeah!” Song Wei nodded. The threshold for cultivation is too high ...”

Ling Qingxue felt the same way. She said,””Yup! It’s all thanks to RUO Fei that we’re able to cultivate. In order to change our Constitution, we’ve paid a huge price. ”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Everything is difficult at the beginning. It’s worth it no matter how much it costs to let you guys take this step!” And it will get better and better in the future. I called you all together this time to take you to a good place! It can be said that with this place, we won’t have to worry about cultivation resources for a long time!”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei asked at the same time,””What kind of place is it?”

Song Wei then turned to Ling Qingxue and asked,””Qingxue, even you don’t know? I thought he had told you about it long ago. ”

Ling Qingxue smiled faintly and said,”do you think this guy will favor one over the other?” He’s been keeping us in suspense since Sanshan, and now that he’s in Beijing, he still won’t tell us ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this is more of a surprise!” Anyway, I’ll definitely surprise you! It’s almost time, let’s go eat first. I still have some things to do in Beijing. We’ll leave the day after tomorrow at the latest, and you’ll know then! By the way, Weiwei, aunt Fang made you a lot of your favorite fried buns. I asked Wu Xiujuan to put them in the refrigerator. If you want to eat, you can just heat them up!”

...

Xia ruofei refused to say and even changed the topic. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had no choice but to glare at Xia ruofei and let him keep them in suspense.

……

Xia ruofei stayed in the capital for two days. He went to visit elder song and brought Ling Qingxue and Song Wei to the Paradise chapter for a walk. He had a drink with his brothers and Ling Qingxue also learned about the Ling Ji private kitchen’s operations in the Paradise chapter.

Then, Xia ruofei went to the Liu family’s courtyard to check on old master Liu and left him a batch of pills that he had prepared in advance.

On the third day, Xia ruofei boarded the Gulfstream G650 public jet with Ling Qingxue and Song Wei, who had applied for leave from the school. They departed from the Capital International Airport and flew to Paradise Island in the depths of the South Pacific Ocean.

The flight from Beijing to Paradise Island was longer than the flight from Sanshan, so the plane naturally landed in rainboas to refuel and continue the rest of the flight as usual.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei had been on the plane for a long time and saw that the plane had been flying over the sea. Their curiosity grew and they pestered Xia ruofei several times to ask where they were going. However, Xia ruofei refused to tell them and kept it a secret.

Ling Qingxue even tried to act coquettishly. Even the shy Song Wei held Xia ruofei’s hand and shook it. She asked him in a coquettish voice, but Xia ruofei remained unmoved.

The two of them could only shake Xia ruofei off and sit down in the middle of the cabin. They looked at the scenery outside the window and chatted, no longer paying attention to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled as he sipped his red wine. He knew that Ling Qingxue and Song Wei’s curiosity had been completely aroused. Although the two of them pretended not to care, in reality, they felt as if their hearts were being scratched by a cat!

After more than ten hours of long – distance flight, the plane finally began to slowly descend.

...

When Ling Qingxue and Song Wei noticed that the plane was going down, they quickly put their faces close to the window and looked out.

After the plane passed through the thin clouds, the scattered islands on the sea could be vaguely seen.

When the two of them saw the plane slowly descending towards a small island, their hearts gradually became excited. After holding it in for so long, they were finally reaching their destination. The answer to the mystery was about to be revealed.

Although there was no command from the tower staff, there were no other aircraft in the nearby airspace. Furthermore, Peach Blossom Island Airport was clean. There were no aircraft taking off or landing. In addition, Liu An’s crew was already very familiar with the airport, so they landed the plane on the runway very smoothly.

After taxiing, the plane slowly stopped in the parking lot.

Even before the cabin door opened, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei could already feel the difference. They looked at each other and said in unison,””The spiritual Qi here is so dense!”
