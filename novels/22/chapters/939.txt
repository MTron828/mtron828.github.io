Chapter 940: Beyond the legendary level (1)

“You should know old Mister Li Jiu Zhou, right?” Elder Xu asked.

“How could I not know Grandpa Jiuzhou?” Tang Yitian immediately said. The old man passed away last year. I heard that the Hong sect brothers in the United States held a Grand funeral for him. Unfortunately, I just happened to take Haoran back to China to seek medical treatment and didn’t make it in time for the old man’s funeral. ”

Li Jiu Zhou was a legendary figure in the Hong sect. When he was young, Li Jiu Zhou was known for his strong combat power in the Hong sect in the United States. He had once struck fear into the hearts of other gangs.

When Li Jiu Zhou was ninety years old, he was still a martial arts expert, and three to five young men could not easily get close to him. At the age of 100, he could still drink a pound of white wine and walk up and down the stairs as if he was flying. He had lived for a total of 126 years and only died last year.

Even Tang Yitian’s father had to respectfully call li Jiuzhou “Grandpa li”, which showed that he was of high seniority.

Li Jiu Zhou had fought countless battles in his youth. He did not abstain from smoking or drinking, but he managed to live to a lifespan that was close to the world record. There were many legends about him in the Hong sect. A more reliable one was that Li Jiu Zhou had met an expert in his youth and had cultivated a Qi cultivation technique.

Elder Xu nodded and said,”it’s good that you know Mr. Jiuzhou.” Three years ago, Haoran’s condition began to worsen. I once went to the United States to ask Mr. Kyushu for help ...”

“What? Uncle Xu, you actually went to the United States for Haoran, and you even went to ask Grandpa Jiuzhou for help?” Tang Yitian was shocked.”Why didn’t you tell me about this?”

Elder Xu smiled faintly and waved his hand.””What’s there to say about this matter not being done? Yi Tian, this is not the main point, you should listen to me. ”

Tang Yitian was very touched. He nodded and said,””Uncle Xu, no matter what, I’ll remember your kindness!”

“Alright, alright, we’re all family. Do you have to be so pretentious?” Elder Xu laughed and scolded,”do you still want to listen?”

“Please, please, I won’t interrupt ...” Tang Yitian smiled.

Elder Xu continued,”do you know what happened at that time?” After I described Haoran’s condition to Mr. Kyushu, he directly shook his head and said that if he were twenty years younger, he might have the ability to help, but the probability of success was very low ...”

“What? Even grandfather Jiuzhou is not confident?” Tang Yitian’s expression changed.”So, Mr. Xia’s strength ...”

After hearing elder Xu’s words and thinking about how Xia ruofei had treated little Haoran, he couldn’t help but be shocked.

Elder Xu smiled and stroked his beard.””So, do you think that such a person is not worthy of your respect?”

“It’s worth it, worth it ...” Tang Yitian said without hesitation.”Mr. Xia’s strength has surpassed grandfather Jiuzhou, so he is worthy of our respect. Not to mention that he is Haoran’s Savior.”

……

Although it had been three or four days since he had met elder Xu, Tang Yitian still felt like he was in a dream when he thought about it.

He had thought that Xia ruofei was very strong. Otherwise, he would not have been able to cure little Haoran. However, once he had a clear reference, the concept of strength was even more intuitive and shocking.

Tang Yitian didn’t tell Jennifer about this. Even if he did, Jennifer wouldn’t be able to understand. She didn’t know about the internal affairs of the Yi Xing society, and she didn’t know about Mr. Li Jiu Zhou’s magic.

Of course, Jennifer’s gratitude to Xia ruofei was no less than Tang Yitian ‘s. On the contrary, as a mother, she watched her most beloved child’s condition get worse day by day. She had hundreds of millions of assets but was helpless. In that desperate and helpless situation, Xia ruofei’s appearance had pulled little Haoran back from the edge of death. As a woman with a softer heart, Jennifer’s gratitude to Xia ruofei was even far more than Tang Yitian’ s.

Hence, when little Haoran wanted to see Xia ruofei, the couple decided to come to the Hunter Valley after a short discussion.

There was a light knock on the door.

“Come in!” Tang Yitian said imposingly.

A 27 – or 28 – year – old man opened the door and walked in. He was wearing a well – ironed Tang suit and had a very strong body. His eyes were bright and his temples were slightly raised. His whole person was like a sharp sword that had been unsheathed, with a dazzling edge.

However, he was very respectful in front of Tang Yitian. As soon as he entered the room, he slightly bowed to Tang Yitian and said,””Fifth uncle, the banquet has already started. Please move to the banquet hall with second aunt!”

This man was Tang Yitian’s nephew, Tang Hu. He was the son of Tang Yitian’s older brother who had died.

Tang Yitian nodded and stood up with Jennifer. He waved at little Haoran and said,””Haoran, let’s go!”

Little Haoran raised his head and asked,”are you going to find brother RUO Fei?”

Tang Yitian smiled.”It’s late now. It’s impolite to look for brother ruofei. I’ll take you to a party.”

Little Haoran suddenly lost interest and said,””Oh ...”

However, he had received a good upbringing since he was young, so he didn’t throw a tantrum. He still stood up obediently and left the villa with Tang Yitian and the others.

A small electric car was parked at the entrance. After Tang Hu respectfully invited Tang Yitian’s family into the car, he jumped onto the front passenger seat and signaled the staff to set off.

On the way, Tang Hu turned his head and said with a smile,”Fifth uncle, if those suppliers know that you’re personally attending the banquet, they’ll definitely be overwhelmed by the favor.”

Tang Yitian smiled faintly and said,” “It was just a coincidence! You’ve done well in the New South Wales market these past few years, so I’m not worried. ”

“It’s all because of your cultivation, fifth uncle!”Tang Hu quickly said.

Tang Yitian smiled and said,”that’s also because of your own efforts.” However, Tiger, it’s best to change the business of the Yi Xing society as soon as possible. The situation is not like before. ”

“I understand, fifth uncle,” Tang Hu said with a solemn expression. The transformation has been going on, but it’s a process. ”

“In short, we must strictly restrain our subordinates,” Tang Yitian said seriously.”In addition, we must not touch sensitive businesses like drugs and firearms!”

“I understand! Don’t worry, those businesses have been completely shut down for the past two days, and drug trading is absolutely not allowed in our territory. ” “Yes,” Tang Hu said, and then he smiled and said,”the state police chief even expressed his approval of our righteous Association some time ago!”

The director of the state police praised the leader of the underground world. It might sound a little ironic, but it was indeed an objective fact. There were not so many black and white people in this world.

Just like Tang Yitian, who in the Australian police didn’t know that he used to be an important figure in the entire Australian underground world? However, he could still drink and chat with the federal politicians.

Tang Yitian nodded and asked,”Oh right, how’s the cooperation with the Wei nation?”

He frowned slightly when he asked the question. He had a certain resistance to this cooperation. Although Yingluo was born and raised in Australia, he had yellow blood in his body, and he had been in the Chinese society with his father since he was young. He had a strong Chinese complex and naturally disliked the Wei people.

However, this cooperation was strongly advocated by Tang Hu, so it was a pilot project in New South Wales. The conditions proposed by the other party were very attractive. The two sides would set up a new retail brand and promote it in Australia and Wei nation at the same time. Maya also had a controlling stake, so the initiative in the cooperation process was in Maya’s hands. Therefore, Tang Yitian reluctantly agreed to let Tang Hu try.

“We’re almost done with the discussion. They’ve basically agreed to our conditions. We should enter the substantive implementation stage if we can reach an agreement on some details,”said Tang Hu immediately.

Tang Yitian nodded.”Be careful. The Wei nation people have always been cunning and untrustworthy. You can’t trust them too much.”

“Don’t worry, fifth uncle!” Tang Hu grinned.”In Australia, especially in New South Wales, the Wei nation people can’t cause any trouble at all. In the Wei nation, Yamada Co. Ltd. Is also facing the pressure of several major retail giants, and it’s hard to survive, so they don’t dare to have any crooked thoughts about cooperation.”

“That’s good ...” Tang Yitian closed his eyes after he finished.

Tang Hu also tactfully turned his head.

Soon, the electric car arrived in front of the hotel’s main building. Tang Hu respectfully invited Tang Yitian’s family out of the car, then personally led them into the main banquet hall.

Before they reached the door, Tang Yitian and the others heard a burst of noise inside. Some people even whistled and cheered.

Tang Yitian slightly frowned and asked,””What’s going on? Is there a party going on inside?”

This kind of reception usually had a peaceful atmosphere, and everyone was communicating elegantly. They didn’t even speak too loudly, or else it would be quite rude. But now, it was as if they were in the stands of a football field, which was a bit unbelievable.

Tang Hu also couldn’t help but feel a bit embarrassed, hurriedly saying: “Something might have happened! I’ll go take a look!”

Finished speaking, Tang Hu hurriedly took two steps, first pushing open the banquet hall’s door.

As soon as Tang Hu entered, he saw a scene that made him furious. Almost everyone in the banquet hall was gathered together, and then he saw Yamada Jiro trembling and kneeling on the ground, begging for mercy with snot and tears. An Asian man held a gun to Yamada Jiro’s forehead, his expression calm and cold. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What are you doing?” “Immediately put down your gun!” Tang Hu roared.

The banquet hall fell silent for a moment, and then everyone began to whisper. For a moment, it was as if buzzing sounds were everywhere.

Tang Hu’s reputation in New South Wales was too well – known. When these people saw that Tang Hu had arrived personally, they immediately looked at Xia ruofei with sympathy. Of course, many people were gloating.

Yamada Jiro, who was kneeling on the ground, seemed to have found a life – saving straw. His face regained its vitality and he shouted,””Mr. Tang, help me!”
