After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei smiled and met elder Liu’s sharp gaze. His expression was calm as usual and he did not feel any restraint or uneasiness from the old man’s shocking aura.

Actually, Xia ruofei had another unspoken meaning that he did not say.

In a sense, the Liu family was also the song family’s enemy. According to old man Liu’s theory, the Liu family should also be hostile to Xia ruofei. If she saved old man Liu, wouldn’t that strengthen the enemy by a large margin? Why? Just based on the old man’s empty words? He was not a fool. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The sharp glint in old man Liu’s eyes quickly disappeared, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

Obviously, he was not so na?ve as to think that he could convince Xia ruofei so easily. However, he also knew that since Xia ruofei was willing to meet him today, it meant that there was still room for negotiation. Otherwise, Xia ruofei would not have made such an unnecessary move.

Old master Liu looked at Xia ruofei and said,”Little Xia, I heard that haofan suffered a loss on your side?”

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”elder Liu, I don’t think I’ve suffered a loss.” It was normal business behavior. After your grandson bought that piece of land, he wasn’t very optimistic about the development prospects of the land, so he transferred it to us at a low price. This should be a very normal operation in the real estate industry!”

A smile appeared in old man Liu’s eyes as he said,””Is it really that simple? That piece of land is haunted for no reason. Don’t you know what’s going on?”

Xia ruofei shrugged innocently and said,”I really don’t know. How would I know such metaphysical things? However, he heard that brother Yong Jun did invite a famous Fengshui master in Hong Kong to help decorate it. Maybe he had a higher level of Feng Shui! I guess your grandson didn’t find the right person?”

Old Liu was speechless. With the Liu family’s intelligence network, how could they not find out whether the Feng Shui Master of Hong Kong, Xu lang, had played a role in this matter?

However, old man Liu obviously didn’t want to be entangled in this matter. He waved his hand and said,””It doesn’t matter, it’s just a piece of land! Haofan had always been arrogant, and he could temper his mind by hitting walls! Speaking of which, I really have to thank you!”

“Elder Liu, you’re being too polite. I can’t afford to be thanked. After all, I don’t do anything.” Xia ruofei’s answer was flawless.

At that moment, elder Liu suddenly asked,””Xiao Xia, something happened to our haojun at the three mountains. It has something to do with you, right?”

After old man Liu finished speaking, he fixed his eyes on Xia ruofei, trying to find some clues from the subtle changes in Xia ruofei’s expression.

In fact, Liu haojun’s incident had blown up so much that the Liu family had naturally done their best to investigate it. Xia ruofei’s arrangements had been too meticulous, so the Liu family had not found any useful clues. It could be said that this matter was a headless case.

However, some people in the Liu family had analyzed that Xia ruofei was probably involved in this. Of course, this judgment was based on motive. After all, the relationship between Xia ruofei, Wu Liqian, and Liu haojun and some of the things that happened could not be hidden from the Liu family.

After that incident, Wu Liqian was undoubtedly the one who gained the most.

Therefore, old man Liu wanted to use this opportunity to launch a surprise attack. If Xia ruofei’s heart was not firm, he would be exposed.

With the short interaction between Xia ruofei and old man Liu, he actually did not have much hope. After all, Xia ruofei’s previous response was too strict. He did not look like a young man in his twenties at all. In old man Liu’s opinion, he was probably as steady as his son, Liu Qunfeng, and the others.

However, what old master Liu did not expect was that Xia ruofei did not deny it. Instead, he smiled meaningfully and asked,””But you don’t have any evidence, do you?”

Old man Liu was stunned. His eyes were sharp as he stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes. Xia ruofei didn’t back off and looked back at old man Liu calmly.

“So, you admit it?” old man Liu said indifferently.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”elder Liu, you must have heard wrong.” What did I admit? I’m just saying that what you said just now is pure speculation, and there’s no evidence at all, right?”

“Is there a difference?” Old master Liu’s voice became a little gloomy.”Xiao Xia, to be honest, I admire your courage. You dare to admit this in front of me ... Do you know that haojun is the third generation of the Liu family? His political life has almost come to an end in this incident!”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”I’ve read about Liu haojun’s situation on the internet. I just want to say: One could do evil by the heavens, but one could not live for one’s own sins! Such a good – for – nothing child, even if he is forcefully pushed to a high position, won’t he still become a time bomb in your family in the future? If it were to detonate at that time, I’m afraid the damage would be much greater!”

The corners of old master Liu’s mouth curved up slightly. He looked into Xia ruofei’s eyes and asked,””Little Xia, do you think that there’s only the two of us here and you won’t leave any evidence behind no matter what you say? Don’t you think that the Liu family is a little too simple?”
