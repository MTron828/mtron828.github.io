Chapter 1229: Astonishing profits (2)

Translator: 549690339

These dumplings were not frozen dumplings from the supermarket. Xia ruofei had asked Cao tieshu’s wife to make them for him. They were kept in the refrigerator so that he could quickly get food when he was too lazy to cook.

The filling of the dumplings was made from Taoyuan vegetables. After it was cooked, the fragrant taste immediately spread out, making Xia ruofei’s appetite increase.

He gobbled up the entire bowl of dumplings, at least twenty or thirty of them, before he felt that his stomach was almost full.

After dinner, Xia ruofei did not rush to go upstairs. Instead, he took out a special cigarette without any logo, flicked one out, and lit it up. Then, he walked out to the yard to take a walk to digest his food.

Xia ruofei walked around the farm for a while and returned to the courtyard of the villa. He sat down on the stone bench in the courtyard and sighed as he smoked.

Ever since he had obtained Xia Qing’s spiritual puppet, Xia ruofei felt that he had less to worry about. Xia Qing’s working ability was beyond doubt. He had created it to assist in the management of the space.

But today, Xia ruofei felt that one Xia Qing was not enough.

If he were to encounter such a complicated job, no matter how capable Xia Qing was, he was the only one!

“If only we had a few more soul puppets like Xia Qing ...” Xia ruofei looked at the stars in the sky and muttered to himself.

If there were 100 spiritual puppets in the medium, everything would be done quickly.

Not to mention a hundred spiritual puppets like Xia Qing, even if there were three or five more, the work efficiency would be improved several times.

However, Xia ruofei was only thinking about it. At least, it was impossible for him to realize it at the moment.

Xia Qing, the only soul puppet, was also left behind by the space’s original owner. All he did was inscribe the core runes to activate Xia Qing and make her recognize him as her master.

It was impossible for Xia ruofei to make a spiritual puppet by himself. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

A soul puppet at Xia Qing’s level had already exceeded the peak of the outside world’s technology by a large margin. At least, Xia ruofei had never seen any intelligent robot developed by any organization that could be as realistic as Xia Qing.

Not only in appearance, Xia Qing’s body was also made of unknown materials. Even Xia ruofei couldn’t tell the difference between her and a real person.

The most important thing was that Xia Qing had a certain level of independent thinking ability and could communicate with Xia ruofei like a normal human being. This was a level that the artificial intelligence in the world today was far from reaching.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head. He knew that he was being too extravagant.

However, he suddenly thought of another possibility. Perhaps, the only possibility that he could create a spiritual puppet himself was that mysterious cave in the mountain and sea realm, with those unsealed treasures.

Xia ruofei had gained immeasurable benefits just by getting the human – shaped jade talisman.

There were also the earth and heaven Jade talismans at the back, and there was a small Jade box in the last light ball. Since it was placed behind the heaven Jade talismans, it must be more precious.

If there was still a glimmer of hope to obtain the method to create a spiritual puppet, it would definitely be in the two Jade talismans and the jade box.

However, Xia ruofei would give it a try every now and then. He was still some distance away from breaking through the protective light film of the earth jade talisman. He did not even dare to think about the heaven jade talisman and the jade box.

Besides, even if he did get the method to make the spiritual puppet, Xia ruofei estimated that the conditions to make it would be very harsh. The materials might be very difficult to collect, or the method might have a very high cultivation level requirement.

In short, Xia ruofei did not believe that such a high – Level spiritual puppet could be easily created.

He shook his head with a smile, knowing that he was thinking too much. These things were still far away for him.

He could only let Xia Qing try her best to harvest the Cordyceps, as it would take some time, but there was no other way.

After playing with Blackie and lightning in the yard for a while, Xia ruofei went upstairs to take a shower. It was almost 10 O’ clock in the evening when Xia Qing took the initiative to contact him with her divine sense.

Xia ruofei immediately locked the door and windows and entered the spirit map space.

He had stayed in the outside world for about two to three hours, which meant that three to four days had passed in the Archean realm. Those Cordyceps had already been dried.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the space, Xia Qing immediately came to greet him.

“Master! These 2,000 pieces of Cordyceps have already been processed!” Xia Qing pointed to a plastic box and said.

Xia ruofei took a look and saw that the aweto had been neatly placed in the plastic box.

If a timid person, especially a person with trypophobia, saw these thick “dried worms” with dark purple grass on the head of each worm, they would probably be scared to death.

However, in Xia ruofei’s eyes, the Cordyceps sinensis was very pleasing to the eye.

“What’s the weight of the finished dried grass?”

Xia ruofei knew that Xia Qing had definitely weighed it before. He didn’t need to tell her to do so.

Xia Qing wasn’t a machine that executed commands. Most of the time, she would make decisions based on her own “database,” which was the most valuable part.

Of course, this was also the main reason why Xia ruofei felt that he had no hope of creating a spiritual puppet.

Sure enough, Xia Qing immediately said respectfully,””Master, the total weight of the 2160 wormgrass is 1963.6 grams, almost 2.5 kilograms!”

Xia ruofei quickly calculated in his heart and said with a smile,””In other words, almost every 1100 of them weigh a thousand grams?”

The wormgrass he had harvested this time were all quite uniform in size, no big or small.

Hence, Xia ruofei didn’t even need to divide them into different levels. He only needed to do a simple division to get the result.

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing nodded.

“Very good!” Xia ruofei was genuinely happy.

The last time he tried planting it, it weighed about 1200 wormgrass per kilogram, which was far beyond the standard of 1500 wormgrass per kilogram.

Xia ruofei didn’t expect that the quality of the wormgrass harvested from this large – scale planting would be even higher than the ones harvested from the experimental planting.

Back then, they had harvested less than 500 grams of wormgrass for the experiment, but it was bought by President Lin of Qiantang Tongren Hall for 350000 Yuan.

In other words, the purchase price given by Mr. Lin at that time was 700000 Yuan per kilogram.

When CEO Lin returned to Qiantang, he immediately asked a professional organization to test the aweto that Xia ruofei sold him. The test results were far beyond their expectations.

For this reason, President Lin even called Xia ruofei to report the test report’s data. Then, he embarrassedly said that the price of 350000 Yuan was a little too low and insisted on paying Xia ruofei another 50000 Yuan.

Xia ruofei had smiled and declined.

That little bit of money was nothing to Xia ruofei. The bulk of the wormgrass would be his.

However, the fact that Mr. Lin was able to offer 800000 Yuan per kilogram also reflected the high quality of the batch of Cordyceps.

This time, the Cordyceps he had harvested was even better than the one he had planted last time. Xia ruofei estimated that President Lin would buy it without hesitation even if he asked for 1.1 million grams.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but start to calculate how much profit he could make if he harvested all the wormgrass in the Cordyceps sinensis nursery.

He conservatively estimated that these two acres of land could harvest about 500000 Cordyceps sinensis.

This batch of wormgrass was more average. After being made into dry grass, 1100 wormgrass would weigh about 1000 grams.

In other words, Xia ruofei would be able to harvest about 450 kilograms of dried grass.

Even if it was calculated at 800000 Yuan per kilogram, that would still be ... 360 million Yuan!

Xia ruofei was shocked by the result.

It was just two acres of land. In a few months ‘time, besides making a trip to the production area of Naqu, he basically did not pay any other costs, but he could obtain a profit of three to four hundred million Yuan.

This was simply a zero capital ten thousand profit!
