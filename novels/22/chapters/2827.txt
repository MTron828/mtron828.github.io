2828 Throwing a solid hammer (1)

Xia ruofei shrugged and asked,””Otherwise? This is good enough!”

Zhou leiyun did not know whether to laugh or cry.”President Xia, I see that your Facebook account is newly applied, right? There weren’t many fans or followers, so it was useless to just post this video! There aren’t many people who will see it!”

At this point, Zhou leiyun took out his phone and said,””I think we should inform the club and put this video on the club’s official website! Also, we have a few media outlets that we’re on good terms with, so ask them to help repost it!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said with a smile,””Chief Zhou, there’s no need! The reason why I chose to use my alternate account to post this video is because I don’t want the club to use its official name. As for finding other media to repost it, unless it’s absolutely necessary, I don’t want to leave behind any traces of manipulation. ”

“But ...”

“Director Zhou, didn’t you see the few emails I sent?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“I saw it! What’s the use of a few emails?” Zhou leiyun asked,”are you submitting a draft to the media? For this kind of unknown email, the other party might not even look at it and just throw it into the trash!”

“That will depend on which media it is sent to!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the few emails I sent just now were for Maca news and as news. General manager Zhou, do you understand?”

“What?” Zhou leiyun was slightly taken aback.”These are all media outlets that are closer to Royal Horse ... CEO Xia, I think I understand what you mean ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s good!” Let’s go! Let’s go down for dinner!”

“Alright!” Zhou leiyun nodded.

The group walked out of Xia ruofei’s room. Ling Qingxue and Song Wei followed behind Xia ruofei. Ling Qingxue gently nudged Song Wei’s arm and asked in a low voice,””Weiwei, what did RUO Fei mean by sending the email to the media?”

Song Wei smiled and said,”The Spain sports media generally have an obvious bias. Just now, ruofei mentioned Maca and as, both of which are relatively concerned about Real Madrid. They are not so friendly to bar?a. And the relationship between the two media outlets is quite tense because of their different standpoints and competition between their peers. Ruofei has given them such good material so that they can severely humiliate and criticize sports daily. They could also stand on the moral high ground and criticize bar?a, which was definitely what they wanted! That’s why RUO Fei isn’t worried that these mail will sink into the ocean!”

Ling Qingxue understood the complicated relationship between the media. She smiled and nodded.”The enemy of my enemy is my friend!”

“That’s more or less what it means!” Song Wei said with a smile,”but in fact, marca is not very interested in the teams in Catalonia, including Espanyol, who is often criticized by them. However, they could still cooperate with them on this matter. There’s no such thing as an eternal enemy or an eternal friend. There’s only eternal profit!”

“RUO Fei really has a lot of ideas!” Ling Qingxue chuckled. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Although the two of them had lowered their voices, Xia ruofei was not far from them. With his hearing, he could hear their conversation clearly.

He chuckled as he turned around and said,””In fact, I not only sent emails to a few media outlets that were close to Barcelona, but I also copied a letter to deportamento. I believe they will be interested!”

“World sports news?” Song Wei raised her eyebrows slightly and mumbled to herself,”if I remember correctly, this media company should be on Barca’s side ...”

“That’s right!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but it’s also because of this that the competition between them and The Sports Daily is even more intense. This is because they have a very important audience group, which is the bar?a fans. On this point, the two audiences overlap, which means that the competition between the two media outlets is more direct. Therefore, they should be very interested in this video!”

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei looked at each other and said in unison,””Black – bellied!”

“Weiwei, I think we should stay away from this guy in the future!” Ling Qingxue said.

“That makes sense!” Song Wei agreed.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be confused ...

After dinner, Zhou leiyun still did not want to go back. He said that he wanted to stay and follow up on the next step.

However, he was quickly persuaded by Xia ruofei to go back. The reason was simple. Even if the media editors received the email and immediately paid attention to it, they needed time to write the manuscript and review the manuscript. It was still a question whether the video tonight would appear on these media websites.

Moreover, it would take time for the public opinion to ferment. There was no point in waiting here tonight.

After Zhou leiyun heard this, he accepted Xia ruofei’s suggestion and returned to his Manor.

However, on the way back, he called his assistant during his time in Spain and asked him to pay attention to the websites of Maca, as, and world Sports. If there was any news about Espanyol, he had to report it to him immediately.

After Xia ruofei and the other two finished their meal, they went for a walk near the hotel. This was the Laocheng District of Barcelona, and the architectural style was very distinctive. The pace of life here was not fast either, so it was quite a unique experience to walk on the streets.
