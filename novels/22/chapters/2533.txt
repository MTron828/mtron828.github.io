Jiang Xiaochen stopped in his tracks and looked at Xia ruofei with a hopeful expression.

After being convinced by Ruby, Jiang Xiaochen actually hoped to facilitate this seemingly crazy thing. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Zhou leiyun hurriedly said,”director Xia, you don’t really want to join the club as a player, do you?” This ... This is a little degrading ...”

In fact, becoming a professional player was certainly not a drop in value. Many football stars had a large number of fans around the world! However, in Zhou leiyun’s eyes, Xia ruofei was already a successful entrepreneur with a strong background in the country. With all these factors, it would be a little “reverse” for Xia ruofei to become a professional player.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what’s so cheap about that?” General manager Zhou, you should know the one who played in Serie A a years ago, right? Ka zhafei’s third son!” If Prince can be a professional football player, it’s not a big deal for a small boss like me to play professional football!”

“Director Xia, does that mean you agree?” Jiang Xiaochen asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””I agree with this in principle, but some details still need to be discussed. After all, I can’t train and play with the team all year round.”

“No problem!” Jiang Xiaochen hurriedly said,”you can state any conditions you want! Coach Ruby’s original intention was to use you as a surprise, not to make you a regular main force or substitute. ”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,”first of all, I can’t be at Barcelona all year round. The number of games I can play in is limited. If the coaching staff wants to put me on the list of matches, they must inform me in advance and get my permission. I have the right to refuse to play.”

If it were any other professional player, even a Big Shot like Messi or crony, it was impossible to make such a request, because it was a matter of reflecting a professional player’s attitude in the game. However, even if Xia ruofei joined a team, he would still be considered an “atypical” professional player and could not be measured by the standards of a professional player.

“Of course, no problem! Coach Ruby has the same idea, and the coaching team will definitely respect your personal wishes!” Jiang Xiaochen said without hesitation.

“Second, the registration of players will be handled by the club. I will join the team as a free agent without a signing fee. I don’t need a salary either. I will play for the club for free.” Xia ruofei said,”but the contract must also state that I have full rights and the club can not sell me to another club. Besides, I have the right to terminate the contract at any time.”

“Director Xia, that won’t do!” Zhou leiyun quickly said. Since you’re joining the team for free, according to the usual practice, the club must give you an individual signing fee. And since you’ve signed with the club, how can you not get a salary?”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”I’m different from the average professional player. It’s just for fun. Even if I sign with the club, I can’t play a few games a year. Most of the time, I won’t even be in Spain. My contribution to the club is limited. I don’t want the signing fee and salary. Besides, I’m a shareholder of the club. Isn’t this like changing my left pocket to my right pocket? There’s no need for that. ”

“That’s not the same. Even if you have limited playing time, it’s possible that every time you play, you can score a goal worth thousands of gold!” Zhou leiyun said seriously,”a player’s contribution to the team has never been measured by playing time! At least, it was not measured by this index. And even though you’re a shareholder, you only have 20% of the shares! How could he change his left pocket to his right pocket! What should be there still needs to be there!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”General manager Zhou, there’s no need. I’m not short of money.” Besides, you’re always fishing and fishing. I’ll feel like my hands are burning with this money, so don’t fight with me!”

At this moment, Jiang Xiaochen said weakly,””Director Xia, director Zhou, I have a suggestion. Since President Xia insists on not getting paid, and President Zhou feels that we can’t let President Xia work for free, then we might as well compromise. As long as President Xia is on the list of contestants, the club will pay him an appearance fee. If President Xia is on the competition, the appearance fee will be raised to another level. If President Xia scored a goal in the game, he would be given a bonus. The bonus could also be divided into tiers. The more important the game was, the higher the bonus.

There was also a limit to the bonus if the club achieved various achievements at the end of the season, such as successfully avoiding relegation, entering the European tournament, or entering the King’s Cup rounds. If President Xia won some official personal honors, such as the official Selection of the best player in a single game, the top ten goals in a single round, the top ten goals in a season, and so on, another bonus would be given. In short, he just wanted to use the bonus to replace the salary and list the terms in detail.

The reward was a fluctuation, and it was generally given according to the contribution. This way, President Xia wouldn’t feel like he was reaping what he had sown, nor would he have to work for the club for free. What do the two of you think of my suggestion?”

Zhou leiyun’s eyes lit up, and he said,”you don’t say ... But Xiaochen, this idea is quite interesting!” Xiaochen, let’s do this! When the time comes, I’ll write it in the contract! The various types of bonuses were listed in more detail, and the standards had to be higher! It was formulated by referring to the standards of top star players! After all, President Xia plays with a zero – Salary salary, so it would be a bit unreasonable if the bonus is not higher!”
