Cheng Xiaoxiao’s mouth suddenly opened wide, as if a pie had fallen from the sky.

Corner Western restaurant was considered a high – end Western restaurant in Sanshan, and the salary was higher than many five – Star hotels. For Cheng Xiaoxiao, it was already very difficult to find such a job. Her only hope was to perform well and not be fired.

What she did not expect was that because of Xia ruofei’s few words, not only did her work position become more stable, but she also got a chance to be promoted.

There were a total of four foremen in the Western restaurant, and the salary of each foremen was much higher than that of an ordinary waiter. They would also receive a certain floating reward based on the performance of the restaurant. The average monthly income could reach at least 20000 Yuan.

Cheng Xiaoxiao couldn’t even believe her ears.

“Xiaoxiao, why don’t you thank Mr. Bastian?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Cheng Xiaoxiao came back to her senses and quickly stood up.””Thank you for your trust, Mr. Bastian! I’ll definitely work hard!”

“Cheng, this is the reward you deserve!” Bastian said with a smile.

Cheng Xiaoxiao naturally knew that she was able to get promoted so quickly because of Xia ruofei, so she immediately said to Xia ruofei,””President Xia, I don’t know what to say ... Thank you!”

“You’re welcome,” Xia ruofei smiled.”Do your best at the Western restaurant around the corner! Maybe you can take over Bastian’s position after he’s transferred back!”

Xia ruofei had said this to Cheng Xiaoxiao in Chinese, but Bastian could also understand some Chinese. Xia ruofei’s words moved his heart slightly, and he had really listened.

If he left China, then the restaurant would need a new manager. Now it seemed that Cheng Xiaoxiao was a good candidate.

It seems that I have to train her well in the future. At least before I leave, I have to let her establish a certain prestige so that she can take over the position of manager in the future! Bastian reminded himself in his heart.

Xia ruofei had already spoken. If they didn’t take this matter to heart, they would offend a high – Quality ingredient supplier for no reason. It would not be worth it.

After today’s auction, Bastian had a new understanding of Xia ruofei and the Paradise Corporation. The field of high – end ingredients was different from the ordinary supply field. It was basically a seller’s market. With a rich product line like the Paradise Corporation, and each of their products was of the highest quality that exceeded the industry’s standards, they would have a large say in the process of cooperation.

A restaurant manager position in exchange for the friendship of the Paradise Corporation and Xia ruofei was a sure – win deal.

Bastian even felt that if he reported everything to the headquarters, the headquarters would directly appoint Cheng Xiaoxiao as the restaurant manager, and he might be transferred to another Western restaurant to work as Wanwan. After all, he had only been out for a short time, and it was unlikely that he would be transferred back immediately without special circumstances.

Therefore, Bastian decided not to mention this to the headquarters for the time being. Instead, he would focus on training Cheng Xiaoxiao in the next few days.

Cheng Xiaoxiao naturally didn’t know that so many thoughts were going through Bastian’s mind. She only knew that Bastian could understand Chinese, so her face turned red. She quickly glanced at Bastian and said,””President Xia, I’m just an ordinary waiter. How can I be a manager?”

“Cheng, Mr. Xia thinks so highly of you, so you can’t undervalue yourself!” Bastian took the initiative to say,”being a manager of a Western restaurant is not a high – tech job. As long as you study hard and train in the position of a Foreman for a while, it is not impossible for you to be competent as a manager.”

“Okay, Mr. Bastian,” Cheng Xiaoxiao said quickly.”I’ll definitely work hard and learn from my old employees!”

Bastian revealed a kind smile and nodded slightly.

He was usually a serious man and was very strict with his management, so the waiters in the restaurant were a little afraid of him.

Cheng Xiaoxiao felt that Bastian was a completely different person from the manager she had in mind.

“Mr. Xia, we won’t disturb you any longer ...” Bastian continued.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Bastian, don’t be in a hurry to leave!” I’ve already ordered three dishes. Why don’t we have dinner together?”

“That’s a great honor!”Bastian said in surprise.

Cheng Xiaoxiao felt like she was in a dream. She didn’t expect to have dinner with her idol. She was so happy that she kept giggling and couldn’t close her mouth.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”My friends have all gone shopping. It’s boring to eat alone. You guys can chat with me!”

Soon, Tony came in with a waiter pushing a food cart.

Cheng Xiaoxiao saw the waiter placing food on the long table in the restaurant next door and quickly asked,””President Xia, can I take a photo?”

“Take a picture?” Xia ruofei was stunned.

“Yup! I’m so happy today!” Cheng Xiaoxiao had a love – struck expression on her face.”I want to take a picture of the Presidential Suite and our dinner. I’ll post it on Tieba and make them die of envy!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He waved his hand and said,””Pat! Take whatever you want! Let’s even take a group photo together!”

“Really?” Cheng Xiaoxiao asked, her eyes wide open.

“How can it be fake? Come, come, come, I think this background is not bad, let’s take a picture first!” Xia ruofei took the initiative.

Anyway, he didn’t feel itchy anymore. Tao Yuan company had made a big splash this time, and he knew that his popularity on the internet would definitely increase instead of decrease. It didn’t matter if Cheng Xiaoxiao posted a few more photos.

“They’re coming!” Cheng Xiaoxiao quickly opened the camera function on her phone and scurried to Xia ruofei’s side. Then she raised her phone high and took a few photos from an angle.

Xia ruofei also showed a bright smile.

“I’ll take a picture of this Presidential Suite ...” Cheng Xiaoxiao said.”I’ll let those country bumpkins on the forum have an eye – opener!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He said to Bastian,”Mr. Bastian, let’s go to the restaurant first! I don’t think Xiaoxiao will be able to finish it in a short time!”

“Hahaha! Alright, alright!” Bastian smiled and said,”Mr. Xia, after you!”

Seeing Xia ruofei treat Cheng Xiaoxiao so well, Bastian was even more determined to focus on Cheng Xiaoxiao’s training. Before he left, he must strongly recommend the headquarters to let Cheng Xiaoxiao take his position!
