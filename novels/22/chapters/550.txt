Chapter 551: No story without a coincidence (1)

When Xia ruofei got up, he received a notification on his phone that 5 million HxB had been deposited into his private account.

President Lin quickly handed over the work at hand and the two left Tongren Hall together.

CEO Lin didn’t even bring his chauffeur. He personally drove Xia ruofei out of Qiantang city and towards laoyan mountain.

Laoyan mountain was located within the borders of Jiang Zhe province’s Anyue city. It was more than 300 kilometers away from Qiantang city. President Lin personally drove Xia ruofei to laoyan mountain without saying anything. It showed how important this matter was to him.

Along the way, President Lin did not miss the chance to beat around the bush. However, Xia ruofei was very cautious and did not reveal anything, so President Lin tactfully did not ask too much. Instead, he introduced the local customs of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province to Xia ruofei, especially the area around laoyan mountain, where everyone had the history of planting iron – Skin Dendi and so on.

After a five – hour drive, they finally entered the borders of Anyue city.

It was obviously not Mr. Lin’s first time here. He drove the Mercedes – Benz for another half an hour and arrived at the entrance of a metal – skinned Dendrobium cultivation base.

Xia ruofei looked from the outside and did not see the large greenhouse. There was a simple sign at the door with the words “Qian’s iron – Skin Dendrobium” written on it. The paint on it had peeled off and it looked very mottled.

President Lin seemed to have read Xia ruofei’s mind. He laughed and said,”Brother Xia, don’t be fooled by this cultivation base’s shabby appearance. In fact, the Qian family’s iron – Skin Dendrobium is the most famous in the area of laoyan mountain. Our Tongren Hall imports a lot of goods from them every year!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”big brother Lin’s judgment can’t be wrong ...”

There were no special security guards at the entrance. President Lin got out of the car and opened the iron gate himself. Then, he drove into the cultivation base.

As the car drove further in, Xia ruofei saw that there were forests on both sides of the road. Each tree had a coil of hemp rope tied to the iron – Skin Dendi. The branches of the iron – Skin Dendi were attached to the trunk in a spiral shape. It was a spectacular sight from afar.

Director Lin chuckled.”Brother Xia, the iron – Skin Dendi here are all imitated from the wild environment. Although the iron – Skin Dendi grown under such conditions have a longer maturity period, its quality is infinitely close to that of the wild Dendi ... Of course, compared to the quality of the fresh strips you brought, it’s still a lot worse.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”From the looks of it, this cultivation base is quite large.”

“That’s for sure! Old Qian’s production may not be ranked among the top in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, but the quality is definitely among the best. ” President Lin smiled and said,”brother Xia, if this was an unreliable place, do you think I would dare to bring you here?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I really have to thank you this time, big brother Lin. After this is done, I will definitely not forget your help.”

“Haha, you’re welcome!” President Lin said happily.

As they spoke, the car drove to a large courtyard in front of the forest.

There was a small four – story building with several rows of single – story houses on both sides. Some workers were busy working.

CEO Lin stopped the car in front of the four – story building and got out of the car with Xia ruofei. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A middle – aged man in his fifties was standing in front of the small building and talking to a few workers. When he saw Mr. Lin, he was stunned for a moment. Then, he immediately came up to him with a smile and said enthusiastically,””Yo! President Lin, what brings you here?”

“Boss Qian! I see that you’re glowing, your business has been good recently!” President Lin said with a smile.

“Mr. Lin, why didn’t you tell us you were coming? I’ll make some preparations and do my part as a good host!” As boss Qian spoke, he looked at Xia ruofei and asked,”Mr. Lin, this is?”

“Boss Qian, this is boss Xia from the southeast province. Don’t underestimate him just because he’s young. His business is very big!” President Lin quickly said.

Xia ruofei came up and said with a smile,””Boss Qian, how are you?”

Boss Qian quickly took the initiative to shake hands with Xia ruofei and asked,””Boss Xia is really young and promising!”

Then, boss Qian said to boss Lin,””Boss Lin, did you bring boss Xia here to buy the iron – skinned fengdou? Why did you have to make such a long trip? I’ve kept the best goods for you! Can’t you just give me a call and I’ll get someone to send it over?”

CEO Lin chuckled.”Boss Qian, you’ve misunderstood. I’m not here to acquire kaedo. Actually, I’m just a middleman. Boss Xia has some business to discuss with you.”

Boss Qian was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and said,””Oh? What business did boss Xia want to talk about? Other than cultivating iron – Skin dendrobes, I basically have no other business these past few years ...”

Boss Qian’s words revealed a hint of desolation. At the side, President Lin chuckled and said,””Boss Qian, this is your ancestral craft. Look at how good it is now! The iron – Skin Dendrobium business is booming. Isn’t it better than your previous business? I’ll see! You didn’t do proper work in the past, but now you’re on the right track!”

“My boss Lin!” Boss Qian said with a bitter smile. If you don’t mock me the next time we meet, I’m really not used to it ...”

President Lin raised his head and laughed heartily. It was obvious that the two of them were very familiar with each other, and they didn’t have any scruples when joking with each other.
