Chapter 3412: Finishing everything in one stroke (2)

Translator: 549690339

In terms of strength, the goldthread nether snake was much more powerful than Shen tianfang. It was even stronger than Chen Xuan’s father, Chen Nanfeng. In addition, it was highly poisonous. If they were to fight head – on, Xia ruofei would not be its opponent.

However, with the help of the formation, Xia ruofei had killed the golden thread nether snake, which was at the peak of the late golden core stage, without even coming into direct contact with it. This sounded like a fantasy.

After a long while, Xia ruofei asked,”senior Yuntai, I… Successfully killed the goldthread nether snake?”

The tone of layman Yuntai was also very complicated,””Of course! Although I was unable to see what was happening inside the formation due to the formation’s shielding, since there was no more movement, it was likely that he had already been killed. Based on my understanding of the goldthread nether snake, it won’t give up as long as it’s still breathing!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”That’s true. It doesn’t have any chance of survival. I just can’t believe it. Haha…” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Layman Yuntai couldn’t see the situation inside the formation, but Xia ruofei could see it clearly.

Scholar Yuntai sighed and said,”this old man also can’t believe that a golden thread nether snake was killed by an early gold core cultivator like you!” And it was so easy…”

“Senior Yuntai, it’s all thanks to your guidance!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I can’t think of a way to deal with it with a Space Array on my own!”

With that, Xia ruofei waved his hand to remove the formation and carefully kept the materials.

He now had a lot of materials for the array, all ready – made. He could take them out at any time when he needed them, and he could set them up with a wave of his hand.

Xia ruofei also felt that if the formation was used well, it could really be very effective.

However, formation path was profound and vast. If he wanted to achieve results in formation path, he still needed to continue exploring.

As soon as the nine turn space splitting formation was removed, the goldthread nether snake’s massive body was revealed. Its body was covered in countless wounds of various sizes, and it was a horrendous sight.

After the death of the goldthread nether snake, its body naturally could not recover on its own, so the wounds remained.

Xia ruofei recalled that Ling Qingxue was still in the small space of the mountain and sea realm. Now that he had confirmed that the goldthread nether snake had been killed, he quickly moved Ling Qingxue out of the space.

Ling Qingxue had been in a small space within the mountain and sea realm the entire time. She had been surrounded by chaotic mist, and she could only move in a small area of a few meters.

From the golden thread nether snake’s sudden appearance to Xia ruofei’s killing, not much time had passed.

In the beginning, although Xia ruofei had studied arrays and created array talismans, he had only completed them within the time array of the Archean realm. The time in the outside world had been calculated in seconds.

When the goldthread nether snake was trapped in the nine turn space – splitting formation, Xia ruofei used the formation to attack and kill the snake in about ten minutes.

Thus, the total time that Ling Qingxue had been trapped in the small space of the mountain and sea realm was only 16 or 17 minutes.

However, for Ling Qingxue, these 16 to 17 minutes were a great torment.

Because the situation had been so urgent and everything had disappeared, she was very concerned about Xia ruofei’s safety.

Moreover, the surrounding environment was so unfamiliar, and there was no way to get out. It was like being locked up in a cage. Ling Qingxue’s heart was naturally quite nervous.

So, when Ling Qingxue returned to the outside world, she was already burning with anxiety.

Ling Qingxue was still wearing her bulky spacesuit. When she returned to the mountaintop outside, the first thing she saw was the huge goldthread nether snake. It was so close that she could even see the wounds and exposed flesh on the snake’s body.

Ling Qingxue screamed in fear.

Xia ruofei quickly called out,”Qingxue!” Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid! The goldthread nether snake is already dead!”

Ling Qingxue heard Xia ruofei’s voice and quickly turned her head. She saw that Xia ruofei was standing there, unscathed, with a relaxed smile on his face. Her hanging heart immediately relaxed.

Ling Qingxue sobbed and said,””Ruofei, I was so worried, you know? I… I… I was suddenly trapped in a small space that was only a few meters wide. I couldn’t escape no matter how hard I tried. It was like an endless loop …”

Xia ruofei patted Ling Qingxue’s back gently and said,””I’m fine! He was fine! Look at me, I’m perfectly fine, aren’t I? I killed that goldthread nether snake!”

“I knew it! RUO Fei is the best!” Ling Qingxue nodded and said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I released a life – saving treasure just now. I used a small space to protect you. I just didn’t have time to explain it. I’m sorry for scaring you.”

“It’s good that you’re fine!” Ling Qingxue said, then said in surprise,”RUO Fei, you released that small space? I feel that it’s very sturdy! My full – Power attack wasn’t able to hurt him at all…”

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if it’s not sturdy, how can it protect the people inside?”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”let’s go!” We don’t have much time left for our mission, so let’s complete the mission first!”

“En!”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue held hands as they walked towards the goldthread nether snake. Xia ruofei could feel that Ling Qingxue’s palms were slightly sweaty. She was still a little nervous.

Xia ruofei gently patted Ling Qingxue’s back and smiled.””Qingxue, don’t be afraid. This evil creature is already dead!”

“I know! It’s just that this snake is really too big, I can’t help but feel a chill in my heart just by looking at it!” Ling Qingxue said.

When the goldthread nether snake was alive, it could be said to have an extraordinary bearing and an astonishing momentum. Even after its death, its eyes were still wide open, giving off an extremely strong sense of oppression.

Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand and walked over. When his hand gently touched the corpse of the goldthread nether snake, a line of words immediately appeared on the mission bar in the field of vision of the perceptual mirror: Congratulations! He had successfully passed the sixth level of the Tower of Trials!

Xia ruofei secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Although he had judged by common sense that the mission only required him to kill one goldthread nether snake, he could not guarantee that he would be able to complete the mission if he could kill one. It was only at this moment that he could confirm that he only needed to kill one goldthread nether snake for this round.

In the stone chamber in the mountain sea realm, the mysterious ore was placed on the stone table.

The spiritual body of scholar Yuntai was living in such a mysterious ore. He happened to see Xia ruofei, so he went up to touch the corpse of the goldthread nether snake and turned to leave.

Scholar Yuntai couldn’t help but remind him,””Fellow Daoist Xia, this golden thread nether snake is very rare. Its scales can be ground into very thin lancets, and the poison in its teeth is the best in the world. The number of people in the cultivation world who can cure this poison can be counted on one hand. And its meat…”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He used his spiritual power to interrupt scholar Yuntai’s words,””Senior Yuntai, you might not know this, but no matter how good this golden thread nether snake is, we can’t take it away.”

Xia ruofei had tried it just now, but it was the same as before. The corpse of the goldthread nether snake could not be put into the spirit map space.

Ling Qingxue had also secretly tried to store the corpse of the goldthread nether snake in her storage ring, but the ring she used to store inanimate objects was also unable to store the corpse.

“Can’t take it away? What do you mean by that?” Layman Yuntai was confused.

Xia ruofei explained the rules of the trial Pagoda to him again.

Of course, Xia ruofei and layman Yuntai communicated through spiritual power, so Ling Qingxue, who was beside Xia ruofei, didn’t notice at all.

At the end, Xia ruofei said,””Senior Yuntai, this thing looks envious, but in fact, it’s impossible to take it away, so we don’t have to waste time. Unless this golden thread nether snake has an inner core or something like that, the kind that can greatly increase one’s cultivation after eating it..”
