Chapter 512: Agree to him (2)

Xia ruofei frowned and asked,””Officer Qin, do I have the right to refuse?”

Qin Xiao Yu felt something was wrong and quickly said,””Of course we can’t force you to participate, but ... This won’t do you any harm! Not only will you get a 100000 Yuan prize, but you’ll also be on TV and in the newspapers. You’ll be a hero!”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”I refused because I don’t want to be some bullsh * t hero!”

Zhao Zhixi, who was under the alias Zhao he, was Liang Haiming’s thug. The police had publicized the arrest of Zhao Zhixi. If he participated, wouldn’t it be obvious that he was embarrassing the Liang family?

Even if he didn’t participate, if the Liang family wanted to investigate, they could also find out that Xia ruofei had caught Zhao he. However, Liang Haiming was dead now, and he had killed him without anyone knowing. At this time, why would Xia ruofei take the initiative to provoke the Liang family?

“Officer Qin, I don’t like to show my face in public, so I’m sorry ...” Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I’ll give up on the 100000 Yuan reward too.”

Qin Xiao Yu frowned,”Xia ruofei, how can you be like this?” The chief has already contacted the media. If you don’t show up, how are we going to hold the award ceremony tomorrow?”

Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”yeah!” The one who contacted the media was your chief Chen, not me. You should be asking chief Chen this question! I even gave up my prize money, you can’t force me to attend the award ceremony, right?”

Qin Xiaoyu was speechless. She did not expect Xia ruofei to be so determined. He did not seem to have any respect for Chen Bo, the director of the Public Security Bureau. He just refused to go.

Qin Xiao Yu’s mind turned quickly, and finally, she gritted her teeth and lowered her posture: “”Xia ruofei, I know that there might be some misunderstandings between us. A few days ago, when we captured Zhao Zhixi, I deliberately used the dagger to make things difficult for you. It was my fault, and I apologize to you ... Please reconsider the award ceremony! There was no need to act on impulse, right? There’s at least a hundred thousand Yuan in the reward ...”

Xia ruofei was a little surprised. In his eyes, Qin Xiao Yu should be the kind of woman who was proud and arrogant. He could see that her background was not simple. He did not expect Qin Xiao Yu to take the initiative to give in today.

However, Xia ruofei still smiled and shook his head.””Officer Qin, you’ve really misunderstood. My refusal to participate has nothing to do with you. In fact, I’m speaking from the bottom of my heart. I really don’t want to show my face in public. It’s as simple as that. ”

When Xia ruofei said this, he saw Qin Xiao Yu’s disappointed look and remembered that she seemed to have a good relationship with Lu You. He pondered for a moment and said,””Officer Qin, how about this ... I’ll tell you a compromise. Tomorrow, I’ll have someone attend the award ceremony on my behalf as my friend. This is the only thing I can do ... I’m sorry, I’ll have to leave!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he left the Plaza and walked quickly in the direction that Feng Jing and manager li had left.

On the way, he took out his mobile phone and saved Qin Xiao Yu’s phone number from the small dark room to avoid any misunderstanding.

On the other side, Qin Xiao Yu stood in front of the small square, her heart was in a mess. She was in an awkward situation now and there was nothing she could do by staying here. If she left, it would be equivalent to failing the mission.

In the end, Qin Xiaoyu had no choice but to take out her phone and call Chen Bo.

“Chief, I, Xiao Qin ...” Qin Xiao Yu said in a low voice.

“Little Qin! Did you manage to contact the enthusiastic crowd?” Chen Bo immediately asked,”how’s the situation?”

“I’m sorry, chief,” Qin Xiao Yu said with some shame,”I didn’t complete the task well ... The other party has rejected me.”

“Rejected?” Chen Bo was also very surprised.”How could this be?”

“Xia ruofei said that he doesn’t want to show his face in public. At the same time, he has given up on the bonus.” Qin Xiao Yu said,”in the end, I discussed with him for a long time, but he didn’t make any concessions. In the end, he agreed to let one of his friends attend in his place ...”

Before Qin Xiao Yu could finish, Chen Bo interrupted her,””Xia ruofei?”

“Uh ... The one who helped us catch Zhao Zhixi ...” Qin Xiao Yu said.

“Is it the Xiao Xia who runs a farm in Changping County?” Chen Bo asked.

“Yes ...” Qin Xiaoyu said,”chief, do you know him?” Why don’t ... You talk to him personally, this is too outrageous ... What’s the point of arranging a friend to come? If we were to arrange for someone else, can’t we do it ourselves?”

“Agree to his request!” Chen Bo said firmly.

“What?” Qin Xiao Yu was stunned for a moment and asked subconsciously.

“Agree to his conditions! “We’ll get his friend to attend in his place ...” Chen Bo said.”And our bonus will be given to him as usual. In addition, the 100000 Yuan is the department’s bonus. We’ll give him another 50000 Yuan in the name of the Sanshan Public Security Bureau!”

Qin Xiao Yu suspected that there was something wrong with her ears and couldn’t help but call out,””Chief Chen, Are you sure? He’s not participating, and we’re giving him an extra 50000 Yuan? What’s the point of his friend participating? Isn’t it the same if we just find someone?”

“Little Qin!” Chen Bo’s tone could not help but become a little more serious.”How can this be the same? It’s called cheating if we find people ourselves! The news media would have to report it. Wouldn’t it turn out to be a bad thing? It was Xiao Xia’s own arrangement, so there was no problem. It was understandable that he didn’t want to show his face in public! After all, Zhao Zhixi is a Bandit. There’s no need for him to take the risk of being attacked and retaliated against to attend our award ceremony!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Little Qin, you need to go back now and settle this with little Xia!” Chen Bo said.

“Oh ... I got it, chief.” Qin Xiao Yu replied,”I’m still at the farm!”

“That’s even better, get it done immediately!” Chen Bo hung up the phone after saying that.

Qin Xiao Yu put away her phone. Although Chen Bo’s words made sense, she still felt that something was not right. Chen Bo’s attitude towards Xia ruofei was better than she had expected, especially the 50000 Yuan bonus that he gave at the end, which made Qin Xiao Yu even more surprised.

Although the Sanshan Public Security Bureau was a provincial public security organization, all the public security organizations in the country were the same. The funds for handling cases were always tight. Giving out 50000 Yuan in one go from the Bureau’s account was not against the rules, but the Ministry had already given out the reward. It would not be right for Chen Bo to take the initiative to give out the reward.

In fact, Qin Xiaoyu did not know that Chen Bo had already dealt with Xia ruofei before he had made a name for himself.

That time, Chen Bo had seen with his own eyes how Tian Huilan had called him, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to rush to Changping County overnight for Xia ruofei’s matter.

Chen Bo was very clear about Xia ruofei’s weight in Tian Huilan’s heart.

He had only just found out that this ‘warm – hearted person’ was Xia ruofei. Otherwise, he would have contacted him personally and not let Qin Xiaoyu do it.

Chen Bo was in the midst of a promotion. Tian Huilan was not only his immediate superior but also a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee. If he could get Tian Huilan’s support, he would be much more confident in this matter.

How could Chen Bo take the risk of offending Tian Huilan for such a small matter?

Wasn’t the purpose of the press conference to gain reputation in order to show his face in front of the leaders? Besides, if Xia ruofei let his friends participate, the effect would be the same.

The media didn’t care who the hero was, and they had already spoken to him. In the end, they would definitely focus on the Public Security Bureau.

The benefits of using this matter to befriend Xia ruofei were even more obvious. That was why Chen Bo did not hesitate to increase the reward.

The clueless Qin Xiao Yu had received instructions from the Bureau chief. Even though she did not understand, she could only follow the instructions and drove the police car in the direction that Xia ruofei had left in.
