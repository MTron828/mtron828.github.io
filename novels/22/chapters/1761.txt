Chapter 1762: A soft persimmon is not soft_2

Shen Zhongliang said,”President Lu, we understand ... Sigh!” What the hell is this!”

What du Qinghong was more concerned about was how the Feng Shui situation was reversed. He had always been obsessed with Feng Shui metaphysics. Today’s situation was like a child meeting his favorite toy. If the parent didn’t buy it, he would feel itchy in his heart.

Lu Shengsi gave a few instructions in a low voice, and the group walked towards Liu haofan and Xia ruofei.

Lu Shengsi and the others had been whispering to each other from a distance, and Liu haofan was getting impatient. If Shen Zhongliang and du Qinghong were not seniors in the field of metaphysics, and even his elders were quite polite to them, Liu haofan would have fallen out with them today.

She had come here to accompany him, but at the most critical moment, she had left them to the side to talk. Was this unbearable?

When Liu haofan saw du Qinghong and Shen Zhongliang finally walk over, he immediately raised his voice and said,””Old Shen, why don’t you explain to them what a Yin gathering place is? In case they don’t know anything and waste the investment money!”

Shen Zhongliang was the director of the Huaxia mystical society, and du Qinghong was only accompanying him, so Liu haofan naturally looked for Shen Zhongliang to settle this.

Shen Zhongliang laughed bitterly in his heart, he couldn’t avoid this ...

Xia ruofei had a faint smile on his face as he looked at Shen Zhongliang calmly. Liu haofan’s face was filled with anticipation as well. At this moment, he was already imagining Zhao Yongjun and Xia ruofei’s miserable looks after they found out the ‘truth’. He felt especially good when song Rui was unable to speak his mind.

Shen Zhongliang was in a dilemma. He could not lie through his teeth, or he would really ruin his job. Besides, it was meaningless. He was not the only Feng Shui Master in the world. However, he couldn’t be too explicit, or he would offend Liu haofan.

After hesitating for a while, Shen Zhongliang said with an awkward expression,”Liu, the Feng Shui of this land...I’m not so sure now ...”

Liu haofan’s eyes widened and he cried out,””Old Shen, what’s going on? You didn’t say that last time ...”

Liu haofan was very depressed right now. It was a critical moment! How could Shen Zhongliang drop the ball? If it wasn’t for the fact that Shen Zhongliang had a good relationship with his father, he would have cursed out loud.

Shen Zhongliang smiled bitterly and said,”Liu, the Feng Shui situation is not static. There are many factors that can lead to changes ...”

Liu haofan was about to go crazy. Shen Zhongliang did not say that last time. At that time, Shen Zhongliang told du Qinghong that the yin gathering place was very fierce and that it was basically impossible to break out of it. How did it suddenly change?

At this time, song Rui couldn’t stand it anymore. He smiled and said,””Liu er, don’t force this old man! Do you still not understand? I’m really starting to doubt if you have any EQ at all!”

“You!” Liu haofan was so angry that his teeth were itching, but he was helpless against song Rui’s taunting.

Shen Zhongliang couldn’t find a breakthrough, and Liu haofan saw du Qinghong as a life – saving straw.

He looked at du Qinghong eagerly and asked,””Old man du, you were there at the time, what happened? Didn’t you and old Shen both believe that this land was only suitable for building a Yin residence, and that it was a place to gather Yin?”

Du Qinghong looked hesitant. He wanted to tell the truth, but then he remembered Lu Shengsi’s instructions and was somewhat afraid of this young master Liu.

At this moment, an old man stood out from the crowd and said with a frown,””Sir, aren’t you being unreasonable and pestering me? What kind of Yin gathering place was this? It was clearly a place to gather wealth! Anyone who knows a little about Fengshui can tell that if this is really a Yin gathering place, how can we all be standing here safe and sound and in such a good mood?”

He was right. If Xia ruofei had not reversed the formation, even if the terrifying situation that song Rui had encountered would not have happened in broad daylight, some small problems would have happened continuously. For example, the sound system would have broken, or the backdrop would have been blown over by the wind. In serious cases, it would have even hurt people.

Moreover, the aura of a place with dense Yin Qi would make a stranger feel very uncomfortable. It was impossible for them to be in such a state.

Liu haofan was very angry at the moment. When he saw someone suddenly stand up and sing a different tune, and this person had a strong accent, he was obviously a foreigner. He was even more furious.

“Who the F * ck are you!” Liu haofan pursed his lips and said,”so many Feng Shui masters have not said anything. Why the hell did you jump out and complain?!” Are you trying to show off your ability?”

The White – haired old man was so angry that his beard trembled. He pointed at Liu haofan and said,””Young man, watch your mouth! Is this how your family taught you to speak to the elderly?”

Zhao Yongjun also frowned and said in an unfriendly tone,””Liu haofan! And you still say you’re not here to cause trouble? You’re not welcome here! Please leave immediately!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Liu haofan was burning with anger. He couldn’t accept this reality. He had come here with the idea of revenge, but he didn’t expect to be the one to lose face. If there was nothing wrong with this land, then wouldn’t it be a big joke that he bought it at a high price and sold it to Zhao Yongjun and the others at almost half the price?

Not to mention the heartache of losing so much money, the key was that he had lost all his face. How could he survive in the circle of rich young masters in the future?

Liu haofan, who was in a daze, wasn’t as polite to Zhao Yongjun, who he usually respected and feared.

He straightened his neck, raised his chin, and said,””Zhao Yongjun, I don’t need you to remind me. I wouldn’t even be willing to come to your lousy place! But who was this old man? Don’t tell me he’s someone you guys invited! Even elder Shen and elder du didn’t say anything! He just jumped out so impatiently?”

Zhao Yongjun’s face was ashen as he looked at Liu haofan, who had completely fallen out with him and was smiling coldly.

“Liu haofan, you’ll definitely regret what you’ve said today!” Zhao Yongjun said,”Xu Bo De is highly respected. He’s not someone you can insult!”

“Zhao Yongjun, who are you scolding!” Liu haofan glared at him and shouted, unwilling to be outdone.

At this time, Lu Shengsi, the Vice President of the Chinese mystical society, came out and said,””Mr. Liu, this is the famous Fengshui master in Hong Kong, Mr. Xu lang. He is as good as us old guys in metaphysics.”

Lu Shengsi had originally planned to protect himself, but Liu haofan pointed the spearhead at Xu lang like a Mad Dog, so he had no choice but to step forward.

This was because Xu lang was an honored guest that Lu Shengsi had personally invited to the mainland to exchange Fengshui metaphysics. Xu lang was definitely one of the top three Fengshui Masters in Hong Kong, and all the Fengshui Masters in the mainland were looking forward to this exchange. It was just a coincidence that he came to attend the groundbreaking ceremony. Xu lang happened to be in Beijing, and Zhao Yongjun’s family elders happened to be friends with him, so they invited him to attend.

As the Vice President of the metaphysics society, he had to stand up when Xu lang was being humiliated by Liu haofan. Otherwise, he would be drowned by the spit of his Hong Kong peers.

Liu haofan’s expression froze. He didn’t know Xu lang, but he certainly knew Lu Shengsi.

Initially, he thought that Xu lang was an unfamiliar face and had a southern accent, so he wanted to take the opportunity to vent his anger. However, he did not expect the ‘persimmon’ to be so tough ...

Zhao Yongjun also laughed coldly,”Liu er, you’ve really grown up now!” Even your old man would be polite to uncle Xu, but you’re being so rude! I wonder how the elders in your family will react when they hear about it!”

“Uncle Xu is in Hong Kong, and even the richest man in the country, Mr. Li, treats him as a distinguished guest.” Song Rui curled his lips and said,”so many rich people and politicians are lining up to invite him to see Feng Shui, but you’re saying that he’s just a prop we invited!” Truly ignorant and fearless!”

Liu haofan’s face turned red and white. That “soft persimmon” was no longer as simple as a “hard persimmon” but had become a steel plate ...
