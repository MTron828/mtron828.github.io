Chapter 442: Immortals from all walks of life (1)

Wu Liqian obviously didn’t inform jianggang town. Otherwise, not only would the invited Deputy Mayor come, but their Secretary and Mayor would have come to wait at Taoyuan farm long ago.

Xia ruofei naturally walked up quickly and extended his hand from afar.””County Head Wu, welcome, welcome!”

Wu Liqian’s eyes were smiling as she said,”Ruofei, congratulations! The business is getting bigger and bigger. ”

“No, no, it’s just a small fight.” Xia ruofei replied humbly and then said,”but you look younger and prettier.”

When Wu Gang heard this, his heart couldn’t help but race. It was rare to see someone who dared to speak to Wu Liqian in such a manner in Changping County. Although this beautiful Deputy County Head was young, she had already established her prestige among the cadres and the masses. She had a lot of power in her hands and was an important figure in Changping County.

In fact, if there weren’t so many people present, Xia ruofei would have spoken to Wu Liqian more casually.

Moreover, after Wu Liqian used the jaded skin cream, she did look much younger, and she was in high spirits.

Wu Liqian’s face blushed a little but quickly returned to normal. After a few words of greeting, Xia ruofei led Wu Liqian to the guest area.

The ribbon – cutting ceremony was to start at 9:38 in the morning. Liang Weimin had helped the Feng Shui Master calculate the auspicious time. As property developers believed in Feng Shui, Liang Weimin had taken the initiative to help arrange the ribbon – cutting ceremony, so Xia ruofei could not reject his good intentions and had to do as he had arranged.

There was still some time before the ceremony started. Xia ruofei was chatting with Wu Liqian and the others in the guest area.

Naturally, Wu Liqian became the center of attention. Although Liang Weimin, President Zheng, Ling Xiaotian, and the others were all countless times richer than Wu Liqian, in Huaxia where officials were the most important, an executive Deputy County Head still carried quite a lot of weight in such an occasion.

Ling Qingxue, who had accompanied Ling Xiaotian to the ribbon – cutting ceremony, was also standing beside Xia ruofei. For some reason, ever since Wu Liqian had arrived, Ling Qingxue had subconsciously moved closer to Xia ruofei. She even held Xia ruofei’s arm tightly, as if she was declaring her ownership.

A woman’s intuition was sometimes quite sharp.

Xia ruofei didn’t notice anything strange. Wu Liqian was also in the crowd as usual. Only when no one noticed did her eyes flash with a faint sense of loss.

As they were talking, three black Mercedes – Benz cars drove into the small square in front of the complex.

Xia ruofei looked over in confusion – all the guests he had invited were here. Who could it be?

The car door opened quickly. Xia ruofei recognized the woman who got out of the car in front. She was the person in charge of Hengfeng group in the southeast province of Hong Kong. The woman’s name was Feng Yun. She used to be the manager of the southeast Branch of Hengfeng jewelry. Later, due to her outstanding performance, she was transferred to the southeast Branch of Hengfeng group as the person in charge and coordinated all of the Hengfeng Group’s business in the southeast province.

A middle – aged man in his early forties got out of the other car. He was also wearing a well – tailored suit and had an extraordinary aura. However, Xia ruofei did not recognize him.

As for the third car, it was quietly parked on the spot, and no one got out.

Since they were guests, Xia ruofei greeted Wu Liqian and the others and went up to them with a smile.

Feng Yun, who had gotten off the car first, walked up to Xia ruofei and said with a respectful expression,””Mr. Xia, I’ve been entrusted by the head office’s President Ma to congratulate your company on your housewarming.”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He felt that MA Xiong was making a mountain out of a molehill. He had only built a building on the farm. Although it was the company’s first building, it was still a little too much to call it “housewarming.”

However, Xia ruofei still smiled and expressed his gratitude.

Feng Yun immediately asked the driver and assistant to bring the big flower basket to the arch. Then, she took out an exquisite gift box from her bag and handed it to Xia ruofei. She smiled and said,””Mr. Xia, this is a small gift from our company.”

“You’re too kind, Chairman MA. ” Xia ruofei said as he took the gift box.

Xia ruofei opened the box and saw a Jade thumb ring and a jade bangle. These two jade products were obviously made from the same material. Xia ruofei had been in contact with so many Jade materials that he was already used to it.

Hence, Xia ruofei could not help but exclaim,””The king’s Green!”

The Jade ring and bracelet were all made of the best Imperial Green jade. Although it was not as transparent as the ice type, the ring and bracelet were worth at least hundreds of thousands or even a million.

“This gift is too expensive ...” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.”Manager Feng, I dare not accept it!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Mr. Xia, this is the Chairman’s kind intentions,” Feng Yun said with a smile. “If you don’t accept it, I won’t dare to take it back!” Besides ... These are our company’s own products, and the cost isn’t as high as the market price. ”

Hengfeng group started out in the jewelry business. Now, Hengfeng jewelry’s influence in the world, especially in Greater China, was still one of the best in the industry. For them, the thumb ring and Jade really didn’t cost that much money.
