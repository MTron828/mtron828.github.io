After thinking about it, he felt that the most urgent thing was to improve his movement technique. After witnessing the wonders of the floating steps, he couldn’t wait to cultivate it to the great success stage.

Challenging the Jade pillar formation was one thing, but Xia Qing had said that once one passed the test of the Jade pillar formation, there would be a reward. Xia ruofei valued the help of the Jade pillar formation in the cultivation of movement techniques more than the final reward.

Combining it with the Jade pillar formation to practice the floating steps was simply the best partner.

Other than the floating steps, there was also a set of swordsmanship called the gentleman sword. This required the use of a flying sword, and Xia ruofei planned to try it out when he was free.

However, regardless of whether it was the floating Lotus steps or the noble Sword technique, he could cultivate them anywhere. If he stayed in San Shan, his villa would be very convenient. No one would disturb him.

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “You’re the boss in the company, who cares if you’re late or leave early! As long as you can show up at the company more often, I’ll be thanking you already!”

“Alright, alright, alright! I’ll listen to you. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”actually, it doesn’t matter if I’m in the office or not. Haven’t you guys been doing well recently?”

Although Xia ruofei wasn’t in the three mountains during this period of time, Qin Yanan would sort out the important work every day and email it to Xia ruofei. If there were more important things that needed Xia ruofei’s approval, she would even call him directly to ask for instructions.

Hence, even though Xia ruofei was in Spain, he was still very familiar with the company’s situation.

Feng Rao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”you’re everyone’s pillar! It was the soul of the company! It’s all because of you that the Paradise Corporation is so dazzling! Otherwise, this would just be a mediocre startup. ”

“Although I think you’re right, I’m still embarrassed to praise me in front of you ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.

Feng Rao couldn’t help but burst out laughing. She pointed at Xia ruofei and said,””Your shamelessness is quite ...”

“You have the same style as you did back then?” Xia ruofei asked with a mischievous smile.

“No way!” Feng Ye pouted.

After a few jokes, Feng Jing gave Xia ruofei a simple report on the company’s work.

Even though it was already time to get off work, to Feng Jing, there was no difference. In her eyes, there was only work that she had completed and unfinished.

During this period, the company’s operations had been relatively stable, and the sales of each product line were as good as ever. The progress of the manufacturing factory in Changping and the expansion of Tao Yuan farm was also very smooth. The manufacturing factory in Qiantang city, Zhejiang Province, had also been fully taken over. Part of the production line equipment was already in place, and the preliminary debugging work had already begun.

It could be said that everything was fine.

“After Xue Jinshan brought this group of employees back to China, they started working at flying money pond this afternoon,” Feng Jing said with a smile.

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and said,”this Xue Jinshan, why is he acting so obediently?” Didn’t I tell him to give his employees a day or two off?”

These employees had performed well in the process of taking over the pharmaceutical Group, so Xia ruofei had rewarded them with a vacation in Spain. Most of them had their first experience in flying a private plane.

Although a vacation was a reward, to be honest, it was quite tiring to travel, and the return trip was a dozen hours of flight.

Hence, Xia ruofei gave everyone a two – day break so that they could rest at home and have more energy to work when they came back.

He didn’t expect Xue Jinshan and the others to fly back to Qiantang in the afternoon after getting off the plane in the morning.

“Ruofei, this is what the employees strongly requested!” Feng Jing quickly said. Even if Xue Jinshan can’t put down his work, he’ll go alone. He can’t force all the employees to give up on their leave!”

Xia ruofei’s expression softened and he said,””But he can’t just agree to his employee’s request! Don’t you know how to balance work and rest?”

Feng Jing said,”these employees are all very eager. They all say that President Xia has given them such good treatment. In the past, they didn’t even dare to dream of traveling abroad. This time, they even took a private jet. So, they all want to get back to work immediately to repay you!” I’m just short of writing a letter of challenge!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Are you exaggerating? We must punish those who make mistakes and reward those who make contributions. This is our consistent principle!”

“You don’t say. Other than burning a lot of money, your way of encouraging others is perfect!” Feng Jing laughed.”With this experience, this batch of employees will definitely work for you with all their hearts!”

Then, Feng Jing started to talk to Xia ruofei about the other business matters of the company.

Although the sales of Yangxin soup and jaded skin cream accounted for more than 80% of the company’s income, neither Xia ruofei nor Feng Jing had ever thought of reducing other businesses. They had even expanded Taoyuan farm several times.

Speaking of which, the profits brought by the vegetables and fruits in Taoyuan were really not much from the company’s perspective.

However, both Xia ruofei and Feng Jing knew that every product of paradise Corporation was the best in the market. Whether it was paradise vegetables, Paradise Tea, or paradise – Brand iron – skinned fengdou, one – headed abalone, truffle, and so on, every product was the trademark and face of paradise Corporation.

It was these products that formed the overall “quality” image of paradise Corporation.

Besides, low profits were only relative. If other farm operators heard this, they would be furious.

Compared to ordinary farms, Paradise Farm’s profits were definitely huge.

Xia ruofei considered the fact that it was his break time and that he and Feng Jing were the only ones in the house, so he did not stay for long. After chatting for a while, he got up and left.

At night, Ling Qingxue did not come over to Xia ruofei’s place to tease him. After all, she lived with her father and was not married to Xia ruofei. It would not be appropriate for her to spend the night over at Xia ruofei’s place.

Even though Ling Xiaotian would definitely not mind, he might even encourage her.

After Xia ruofei returned to his house, he did not go to bed immediately. Instead, he took a shower and sat on his balcony, lighting a cigarette. As he smoked, he thought about a problem.

He wanted to choose a cultivation technique that was suitable for song Qiming.

Ever since song Qiming’s head was severely injured in the accident, Xia ruofei had used the precious heart – concentrating grass to treat him. His body had undergone a sudden change. He had no talent for cultivation at first, but now he was suitable for cultivation.

Even though song Qiming was getting on in years, Xia ruofei had promised Song Wei that he would choose a martial art for song Qiming.

In fact, cultivation was different from what many people thought of as martial arts. Practicing martial arts was really about the Virgin boy technique, but cultivation was not the same.

Of course, it would be even better if he could start cultivating from a young age.

However, even if one missed the golden period, as long as there was a suitable cultivation technique, one could still cultivate it. However, song Qiming was indeed too old, and his body’s various functions had deteriorated. Therefore, he was destined to not achieve much in cultivation.

Song Wei did not expect her father to achieve immortality through cultivation. In reality, cultivation was extremely difficult. No one could guarantee that they would reach the peak. Even Xia ruofei, who was blessed by the heavens, could not guarantee it.

As long as song Qiming could become a cultivator, even if he was a low – Level cultivator, it would be very beneficial to him. He could easily live to a hundred years old and he would be free of any illness. He would be much better than ordinary people.

Xia ruofei’s brain was filled with many cultivation techniques. They were all recorded in the Jade talisman of inheritance. The techniques that could be stored in the Jade talisman might be slightly inferior to the “great Dao techniques”, but they were definitely not too inferior. Otherwise, they were very unique, like the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”.

It was not good to have too many techniques. Xia ruofei had difficulty choosing when he was sorting through the techniques in his mind ...
