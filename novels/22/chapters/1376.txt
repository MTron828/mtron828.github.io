Chapter 1377: Leisurely Gulangyu (2)

Translator: 549690339

Chen Xi, who was the most lively, chewed on the frozen ground bamboo shoot and said,””The taste of this frozen ground bamboo shoot is even better than the one at the South Gate of our school! Brother Xia, can I take one back?”

The mud bamboo jelly had bamboo shoots in its name, but it actually had nothing to do with bamboo shoots. Its main ingredient was a mollusk from the sea. It was shaped like an earthworm, so the locals usually called it sea earthworms. Sea earthworms had a lot of colloid. After boiling, they were poured into a mold to freeze, and after forming, they were cut into small pieces. It was a famous dish on Heron Island with soy sauce, eternal spring vinegar, sweet chili sauce, mustard, garlic, jellyfish, cilantro, shredded white radish, shredded chili, and tomato slices.

To outsiders, it looked like jelly with earthworms sealed inside. Zhao Yong Jun and the others were all grown men, and they maintained a strong curiosity for new things. It was understandable that they liked to eat this.

Chen Xi was a girl, but she was not afraid at all. Instead, she ate with relish, which made Xia ruofei click his tongue in wonder.

“Chen Xi, you really live up to your reputation as a Cantonese!” He said with a smile.

The people of Guangdong were famous for their delicious food. There’s nothing that Cantonese people don’t dare to eat!

Chen Zhao grinned,”I’ve eaten things much stranger than this! What was the frozen earth bamboo shoot? You even dare to eat the roe deer!”

Although the quiet Cheng Juan also ate, she only had a small taste and didn’t like it as much as Chen Xi did.

When she heard Chen Xi mention her, she couldn’t help but blush and say,””Isn’t it all your fault?”

Lin Qiao laughed and said,”Brother ruofei, Wei Xi was the one who bought the frozen ground bamboo shoot for zhezi the first time. She even crushed it and put it on a plate for zhezi to eat. Later, when she found out that she had eaten sea earthworms, zhezi almost vomited her bitter gallbladder out ...”

Chen Zhao laughed and said,”Juan Zi is too timid, but didn’t she get used to it?” Was it really that scary? Not to mention sea earthworms, even if it’s a real earthworm, as long as it tastes good, I’ll still dare to eat it!”

Cheng Juan was originally eating a piece of frozen ground bamboo shoot, but when she heard Chen Xi’s words, she almost vomited. She put down her chopsticks and said coyly,””Wei Xi, can you not talk about such a disgusting topic while we’re eating?”

Everyone burst into laughter.

After the meal, everyone became more familiar with each other. Cheng Juan and he he were not as reserved as they were at the beginning. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He he even took the initiative to change her red wine and toasted Xia ruofei. She especially apologized for misunderstanding Xia ruofei at the entrance of the girls ‘dormitory.

Xia ruofei didn’t take it to heart at all. On the contrary, he thought it was quite interesting. Several girls were worried that Lin Qiao had gone astray and hurriedly chased after her ... And from another perspective, this also showed that he he and her dormitory had a good relationship. Her sisters were very concerned about Lin Qiao, which made Xia ruofei feel more at ease.

After the guests and the host had their fun, Xiao Zhang, who had paid the bill in advance, came over with a few fast food boxes and said with a smile,””Brother Xia, I’ve packed some of the girls ‘favorite bamboo shoot jelly, ginger duck, and so on. Please ask your friend to take them back and try them!”

“You’re so considerate!” Xia ruofei smiled and expressed his gratitude. Then, he passed the takeaway to Chen Xi and said with a smile,”here, Chen Xi. This is something Xiao Zhang prepared for you!”

“Thank you!” Chen Zhao said with a sweet smile.

Lin Qiao had already decided to skip class in the afternoon, while he he and the others had to rush back to school. Ran ran and the other three had already signed up for this elective course, so even if Lin Qiao didn’t go to class, they still had to.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked Xiao Zhang to send them back to school.

Before leaving with Chen Xi and the rest, Xiao Zhang helped Xia ruofei and the rest with the check – in procedures. They were all rooms with a sea view. Lying on the bed, one could see the vast sea. The beach was just a few steps away. It was the best room in the hotel.

Since Lin Qiao was also staying, they booked another room temporarily. It was also a room with a sea view, just next to Xia ruofei’s room.

After checking in, Xiao Zhang was busy arranging an electric car to send Chen Xi and the others back to Heron Island University.

At the entrance of the hotel, he he and the other two got on the electric car with Xiao Zhang. They waved goodbye to Xia ruofei, Lin Qiao, and the others.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Little Zhang, since you’re leaving the island, I’ll have to trouble you to help me with something!”

“Brother Xia, you’re too kind. If you need anything, just tell me!” Xiao Zhang said with a smile.

Xia ruofei took out his car keys and handed them to Xiao Zhang.””My car is in the parking lot in the East of the dock. It’s a Knight XV off – Road vehicle. It should be easy to find. After you send the girls back to the neighborhood of the dock, help me take a white plastic bag here. It’s full of food boxes. I’m sure it’s a good one!”

Xia ruofei had considered that they would be spending the night at Gulangyu. If the marinade made by Hu Zi’s mother was left in the car for an entire night, it might go bad even if the weather was cold. Hence, he wanted Xiao Zhang to bring the big bag of marinade to Gulangyu and store it in the hotel’s refrigerator.

“No problem!” Xiao Zhang said readily,”after I find your car, I’ll call you again if I don’t understand anything!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Alright! I’ll have to trouble you then!”

“You’re welcome, it’s what I should do!” Xiao Zhang smiled and said,”brother Xia, it will take me about an hour and a half to go back and forth. If you need anything, just tell the hotel. I’ve already given the orders!”

“I know. You don’t have to worry about this!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”we’re free this afternoon. We’re going to explore the island!”

“Alright, call me if you need anything. I should be back at the hotel before 3:30 in the afternoon. My room is opposite yours!” Xiao Zhang said.

Their company had reserved a standard room in the hotel for a long time. Usually, everyone could stay overnight at Gulangyu. When there was a reception task, it could be used as a staff room, which was very convenient.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”okay, Xiao Zhang. Your mission is to send the three girls back to school safely. We can handle it ourselves.” You guys should leave quickly! Don’t delay the afternoon class!”

After that, Xia ruofei waved goodbye to he he and the rest. He watched as the electric car drove out of the hotel, turned on the tree – lined road, and disappeared from everyone’s sight.

Xia ruofei turned around and said with a smile,””Brother Zhao, we’re here for leisure. How about we arrange our own afternoon? If you want to go out, then go out. If you want to sleep, if you want to daydream, if you want to see beautiful women on the beach, then go out. Anyway, everyone is free!”

“I agree! It’s been a long time since I’ve been so relaxed. After coming to this beautiful island, I feel that the rhythm has slowed down and I’m much more relaxed!” Zhao Yongjun said.

So, everyone dispersed at the entrance of the hotel. Hou Liang, Wei Jun, and Liu Jian went to buy beach clothes, ready to go to the beach to enjoy the beauty of food. Zhao Yongjun and Xu Zixuan were more interested in Gulangyu’s various buildings, so they left the hotel one after another. Song Rui went straight back to his room. He wanted to have a good sleep after eating and drinking.

“Brother ruofei! I want to go out with you!” Lin Qiao looked at Xia ruofei and said.

Xia ruofei rubbed her nose lovingly and smiled.””You’ve been on Egret Island for half a year. You’ve visited Gulangyu, haven’t you?”

“That’s different!” Lin qiaojiao said,”I used to come with my classmates. This time, you’re accompanying me!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no problem!” You can go anywhere you want! My mission today is to accompany you!”

“That’s great!” Lin Qiao said happily,”then let’s go! I know a shop that makes the best immortal – burning herb. I’ll Take You There to try it!”

“You ate so much at noon, you can still eat!” Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”be careful not to eat until you become a chubby girl and then be unable to get married ...”

“Brother ruofei, you’re so bad! Why are you making fun of me?” Lin Qiao said.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh heartily. The two of them walked out of the hotel side by side. Lin Qiao naturally held Xia ruofei’s arm tightly, and her face was filled with a happy smile that came from the bottom of her heart.
