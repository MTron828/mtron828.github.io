    Xia ruofei was overjoyed. The spirit map scroll also had a reaction to the Jade bracelet. Obviously, his previous judgment was 80% correct. The real thing that could evolve the spirit map space was the Jade itself.

  In other words, in the future, he could buy jadeite for the spirit map scroll to absorb, thus achieving the goal of further upgrading.

  In order to make sure that he was not mistaken, Xia ruofei held the icy glutinous jade bracelet and looked at it repeatedly. Of course, he was actually trying to confirm if the spirit painting had really reacted.

  Not only that, Xia ruofei picked up a few other bracelets and made a selection.

  After looking at it for a while, the professional smile on the waiter's face was almost frozen. Xia ruofei was finally 100% sure that Jade could evolve the spirit map space.

  This was because the spirit painting would react to every jade bracelet. However, the strength of the reaction would be different due to the different quality.

  All in all, except for the 100000 Yuan ice glutinous type bracelet, the reaction of the spirit paintings to the other bracelets was very weak. Fortunately, after the spirit map space evolved today, Xia ruofei's spiritual connection with the space had become closer, so he could sense even the slightest reaction.

  Even if it was the bracelet that was worth 100000 Yuan, the reaction strength of the spirit painting scroll was at most similar to that of the Jade paperweight.

  Seeing that the waitress was still waiting for him, Xia ruofei felt a little embarrassed to ask her to serve him so passionately for so long. He had wasted at least twenty minutes of her time by looking at her face.

  It seemed like he had to buy one ...

  Xia ruofei thought for a while and pointed at a bracelet that was about 40000 Yuan."

  "I'll take this! Do you accept credit cards here?"

  The waitress was so bored that she was yawning. She thought that Xia ruofei was someone who would only look and not buy, so she had wasted her time. She did not expect Xia ruofei to really buy one.

  Although a jade bracelet that cost more than 40000 Yuan wasn't considered high - end, her Commission was still quite a lot!

  The waiter immediately perked up and quickly said,"

  "Sir, you can pay by card! If you're sure you want this bracelet, I'll help you wrap it up! Please pay the bill!"

  Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After the waitress had wrapped the bracelet, he followed her to the cashier and took out his bank card to pay.

  Xia ruofei was not short of money for the time being. Hu Zi's mother insisted on returning the 400000 Yuan. After adding the 100000 Yuan that he originally had, he bought a pickup truck. With some recent expenses, he had nearly 400000 Yuan left in his card. It was not a big deal to buy a bracelet that cost 40000.

  Moreover, the spirit picture scroll of the bracelet could also be absorbed, so it wasn't a waste.

  The waiter kept the receipt and handed the Jade bracelet to Xia ruofei with both hands.

  Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,"

  "By the way, I actually need raw jade more. The demand is quite high, and I'll be buying it for a long time. Can you help me ask the higher - ups if spirit Jade house is interested in this business?"

  It would be a waste if he bought jade products for the spirit map scroll to absorb. It was naturally much cheaper to buy jade directly. Anyway, it would be absorbed, so what was the use of processing it?

  "Sir, we usually sell finished products ... But I can call the boss for you!" The waiter said, a little embarrassed.

  "Alright, then I'll have to trouble you!" Xia ruofei said with a smile.

  "You're welcome. Please have a seat. I'll make the call now!" The waiter said.

  Then, she quickly walked back to the counter, picked up the phone, and made a call.

  After a while, the waiter came over and said,"

  "Sir, our boss Chen just happens to be working nearby. He said that if it's convenient for you, please take a seat in the shop for a while. He'll be right there!"

  "Alright, thank you!" Xia ruofei said with a smile.

  "You're welcome," The waitress said with a sweet smile.

  Xia ruofei was not only handsome, but also rich! The saleswoman looked at Xia ruofei in a different light now that she had bought the 40000 Yuan bangle and was about to discuss the sale of Jade with the boss.

  However, Xia ruofei only had an indifferent expression. Although he was very kind, he obviously did not react to her secret flirtatious looks.

  The waitress was a little disappointed, but she immediately thought of something else.

  "By the way, Sir, you've bought more than 20000 Yuan in our shop, so you'll get a free old pit raw stone!" You can go over there and choose!"

  "Old pit raw stone?" Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked,"What is this?"

  The waitress didn't expect Xia ruofei to come and buy jade without even knowing about raw gemstones. This made her even more certain that Xia ruofei was a rich man's son, which was why he didn't care about money.

  She quickly explained,"

  "It's raw jade! "All the Jade comes from these raw gemstones, but there's no device or ray in the world that can penetrate through the raw gemstones to detect whether there's Jade inside, so many people bet on raw gemstones. If there's a high - Quality Jade inside, they'll make a lot of money. Of course, there's also a high possibility that there's nothing inside, and the raw gemstones that they've bought at a high price will become worthless trash ..."

  The waiter explained for a long time before Xia ruofei finally understood what a raw stone was. He asked curiously,"

  "Then wouldn't it be a huge loss for you to give away a raw stone for every 20000 Yuan spent in your store?"

  The waiter looked amused. He looked around and said in a low voice,

  "Sir, these raw stones aren't big, and they're all leftovers from the customers. The probability of them being green is very low, so the boss took them out as a gift ..."

  "I see ..." Xia ruofei couldn't help but laugh.

  He was also a little naive. How could a businessman do a losing business?

  The waiter quickly said,"

  "Don't tell him I told you! You'll be fired by the boss ..."

  "Alright, I won't say anything." Xia ruofei said with a kind smile.

  "Sir, since it's a gift, why don't you go and pick one? Just treat it as a game!" The waiter said,"maybe we can really get Jade! No one can see through raw gemstones. It's all based on experience and feeling. There are always times when you're wrong. "

  Xia ruofei knew that the waiter's words made sense, but the probability of that happening was too low.

  However, since he had nothing to do, Xia ruofei did not reject it since it was free. He stood up and walked to a pile of raw stones in the corner of the shop.

  These raw stones looked black. The big ones were as big as a millstone, and the smallest ones were smaller than a volleyball. It was hard to imagine from their appearance that the fascinating Jade was extracted from these ordinary stones.

  Xia ruofei squatted down in front of the pile of raw stones and reached out to pick.

  He came here with the mentality of playing a game, so he was very relaxed. He kept flipping through the raw gemstones, trying to find a piece that he liked.

  Just as Xia ruofei's hand touched a rough stone the size of a volleyball with pockmarks on its surface, the painting in his arms suddenly shook without warning. The magnitude of the vibration was even greater than that of the bracelet.
