2103 A small matter (1)

Xia ruofei was stunned at first, then he asked in surprise,””Uncle Ling, is it about the house?”

“En!” Ling Xiaotian laughed heartily and said,”I’ve already called old Jiang. When he heard that it was Qingxue’s boyfriend who wanted to buy it, he immediately said that he would give a discount of three million Yuan from the original price! However, this was a large bungalow with property rights of more than 500 square meters. Moreover, the housing price in this community was much higher than the average price of the three mountains, so even with a lot of discounts, the total price of the house was still 33 million Yuan. Moreover, old Jiang was in urgent need of money and might not be able to wait for you to apply for a loan, so he would need to pay in full. RUO Fei, do you have any financial difficulties? Do you want me to help you first?”

Xia ruofei said,”uncle Ling, thank you, but I have a lot of cash on hand. I can pay in full!” How about this ... Let’s find some time to look at the house, and if it’s enough, I’ll take it!”

“Old Jiang has already spoken to the property management. You can go over anytime you want to look at the house. I’ve asked Qingxue to go to the property management today to get the key.” Ling Xiaotian said.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said, then immediately asked,”Oh right, uncle Ling, you said yesterday that President Jiang has a smaller villa in that community. Is he willing to sell it as well?”

Xia ruofei had plenty of money now. He was not particularly concerned about the total price of the house he wanted to buy. He was more concerned about whether he could find a suitable house for Feng Jing.

“Ruofei, you’re quite concerned about that CEO Feng from your company!” Ling Xiaotian said with a smile.

Xia ruofei felt that something was not right and quickly said,””Uncle Ling, CEO Feng has been working for our paradise Corporation since the beginning of the company. In the past two years, you can say that he has been working hard for the company. As the boss, of course, I have to be considerate of my subordinates!”

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”you brat ... I didn’t say anything!” I’m still very confident in your character ...” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sweat. Song Wei and Monica’s figures appeared in his mind. Even though Ling Xiaotian wasn’t in front of him, he couldn’t help but feel guilty.

Fortunately, Ling Xiaotian did not notice anything and continued,””Old Jiang didn’t want to sell it at first, but he reluctantly agreed after I persuaded him for a long time. However, I don’t think there will be any discounts on the price. Let’s go with the current market price ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei happily said,”that’s great!” Uncle Ling, this is called “one thing doesn’t trouble two owners.” You can settle the house problem at once and save a lot of trouble ... Oh right, how much does that small house cost?”

Ling Xiaotian said,”the smaller one is a small terrace house. It’s not too big, less than 200 square meters.” Old Jiang’s terrace house is in a very good location. It’s on the second row of the river, and it’s at the end of the river. The first row of the river is full of detached houses, so this house should be the best out of all the terrace houses ... According to the current price of the second – hand houses in our community, the total price of this terrace house is about thirteen million!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”no problem. This price is acceptable. However, as for the details, we will have to wait for President Feng to see the house. After all, she is the one who will buy it.”

Ling Xiaotian smiled and said,”that’s for sure!” Ruofei, if that’s the case, please bring President Feng here to look at the house as soon as possible! I asked Qingxue to take the keys to both houses. ”

Xia ruofei said,”sure!” I think tomorrow morning is better! Please tell Qingxue to wait for me at home. ”

“No problem!” Ling Xiaotian said.

After the call with Ling Xiaotian, Xia ruofei thought for a while, picked up the telephone on his desk, and dialed the internal number of the president’s office.

“Hello?”

“Sister che, I’m going to fly!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”don’t arrange any work for tomorrow morning! I’ll take you to see the house!”

Feng Rao hesitated for a moment and said,””Ruofei, there are a lot of things to do at the end of the year. There’s no hurry to look at the house, right? Shouldn’t we wait for a while?”

Xia ruofei said,”who said we’re not in a hurry?” A good house doesn’t wait for people! It just so happens that Qingxue’s neighborhood has two very good houses. If we don’t hurry and take a look, we might just sell them to someone else. There won’t be such a shop after this village!”

After that, Xia ruofei said,”it’s settled then!” Tomorrow, you’ll come with me to look at the house! No matter how busy you are, you can’t be so busy that you can’t even spare half a day’s time. Besides, you’re the president, not a small clerk under you. You can just arrange for others to do a lot of things!”

“Alright then!” Feng Jing said,”I’ll go with you tomorrow ...”

“That’s the way!” Xia ruofei said happily,”you don’t have to work overtime tonight. Go back to the farm and stay there. I’ll drive you tomorrow morning and we’ll go directly to the jiangbin villa district!”

“Alright!” This time, Feng Rao agreed more readily. She probably felt that since Xia ruofei had already said so much, she couldn’t reject him.

After calling Feng Rao, Xia ruofei called Ling Ji private kitchen and told them to leave a private room in the backyard. At the same time, they had to prepare the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall and the Chinese perch.

Xia ruofei spent the entire afternoon dealing with some company matters in the office. At FiveO’ clock, he left the office with his handbag and drove to Ling Ji private kitchen.
