Chapter 1496: The strange stone gate (1)

Translator: 549690339

Soon, Song Wei realized how intimate their position was.

Although they were all wearing protective clothing, her delicate and exquisite body was now completely under Xia ruofei’s body. In order to protect her, Xia ruofei tried his best to cover her body on top, and at the same time, he pressed her very low. Her peaks were deformed under the pressure of Xia ruofei’s firm chest.

“Ruofei, why aren’t you getting up?” Song Wei whispered, blushing.

“You can’t get up!” Xia ruofei said subconsciously.

“Ah?” Song Wei was stunned for a moment. Did he have any bad intentions?

Song Wei was very confident in her charm. In such a quiet and remote environment, and with the two of them in such a position, it was normal for Xia ruofei to not be able to control himself.

Song Wei’s heart started to beat faster. She was a little nervous, but at the same time, she was filled with anticipation.

Xia ruofei continued,””I didn’t expect it to be a trap and kill array ...”

Only then did Song Wei realize that she might have misunderstood. Her pretty face could not help but burn. Fortunately, the gas mask covered her expression.

“What trap & kill array?” Song Wei asked, suppressing her shyness.

“At first, I thought this was just a trap array. I didn’t expect the array to have changes.” Xia ruofei said in a low voice,”this formation is very well hidden. If we didn’t sense that something was wrong, we would have been dead by now ... We can’t move now, or we might trigger an even more terrifying trap.”

In fact, Xia ruofei had only felt his heart palpitate for no reason. Then, he sharply sensed the change in the atmosphere in front of him. A huge murderous intent was brewing in the calmness.

He didn’t have time to think and used all his strength to push Song Wei to the ground.

Song Wei looked at the quivering arrows on both sides of the wall and her heart skipped a beat. If Xia ruofei had not risked his life to save her, her body would have been pierced by the arrows.

Xia ruofei knew that he and Song Wei had been trapped in the trap and kill array. If they made a wrong move, they would be doomed.

However, it was definitely not possible to keep this position. It was of no help to escape. Moreover, how could he not feel anything when a beautiful woman was lying under him? If his body had some sort of primitive reaction, it would be really embarrassing. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Hence, Xia ruofei tried his best to keep his mind clear. At the same time, he released his spiritual power crazily, trying to find a way out of this fierce killing intent.

The surrounding aura had changed completely. With Xia ruofei’s spiritual perception, he could clearly sense the Dao patterns that were filled with murderous intent.

Xia ruofei used the array Dao knowledge that he had just learned to analyze these Dao patterns with all his might. He gradually entered a mysterious state.

This kind of state was a bit like when he was in school, learning how to solve a linear equation of two variables, and then facing a very complex equation, he had to solve it step by step.

The complicated Dao patterns gradually became clear under Xia ruofei’s analysis. He slowly discovered the rules hidden in the chaos ...

For Song Wei, who was under him, it was a little difficult.

This was the first time in her life that she had maintained such an ambiguous position with a boy, and she could not suppress the shyness in her heart.

The key was that Xia ruofei was still like an old monk in meditation, maintaining this posture without moving.

At this moment, Xia ruofei let out a long breath and mumbled to himself.

“Ruofei, how is it?” Song Wei asked softly.

“I’ll stand up first, then I’ll pull you up. ” Xia ruofei said,”remember not to touch the ground with your hands, and don’t move your feet!”

“Alright!” Song Wei said nervously.

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up. He reached out his hands and pressed on the two spots that he had calculated. Then, he pushed himself off Song Wei.

Then, he reached out to Song Wei and pulled her up from the ground.

Xia ruofei said,”Song Wei, from now on, you have to follow behind me. Remember, you must step on the places that I have stepped on. You can’t take a single wrong step. Do you understand?”

Song Wei also realized the danger in the tomb and quickly said,””Understood!”

“Let’s go!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he took a step forward steadily. Song Wei’s heart trembled a little. Fortunately, everything was calm as usual and nothing unusual happened.

Xia ruofei did not move quickly. Every step he took was steady. Song Wei did not dare to be careless. She shone her flashlight on Xia ruofei’s feet and followed his footsteps. The two of them walked forward, one in front and one behind.

Sometimes, Xia ruofei would take two steps forward and then three steps back. He would even circle around in a small area. It seemed like there was no pattern, but the amazing thing was that the sudden arrow shooting did not happen again. Everything seemed to have returned to its original calm.

After walking for an hour, Xia ruofei finally let out a long sigh of relief. He smiled and said,””I should be able to walk out this time!”

Xia ruofei leaned against the wall and sat down. His back was drenched in sweat. The journey seemed easy, but it was actually a huge drain on his energy. The calculation of “solving the equation” alone was beyond the imagination of ordinary people. If it was not for the support of his spiritual power, he would not have been able to complete such a huge calculation.
