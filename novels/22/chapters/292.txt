Chapter 293: The leading figure in the tea – making industry (1)

Du Xiaohai still had a glimmer of hope, but elder song didn’t meet him, so his hope was shattered. With such a big incident happening in his jurisdiction, he felt that he had really come to an end as the Secretary. Xia ruofei frowned slightly and looked at the dazed du Xiaohai. He couldn’t help but say,””Secretary du, you ... You should take care of the aftermath here first! The Bureau chief is still waiting to return to the hotel after this place is cleared!” Du Xiaohai suddenly came back to his senses and quickly said,”Alright, alright ...” The situation had already come to this. Du Xiaohai also realized that all he could do was to deal with the aftermath as beautifully as possible. As for the rest, he could only do his best and leave it to fate. At this moment, the back door of the shop opened again. Manager Lu walked out and asked,””Which one of you is the leader of WYS city?” Du Xiaohai shivered and quickly said,”Hello! I’m du Xiaohai, the Secretary of the WYS city government!” Manager Lu nodded slightly.”Hello, Secretary du. My surname is Lu. I’m the chief’s secretary.” Du Xiaohai quickly came forward and slightly bowed,”So it’s manager Lu, Hello!” The personal secretary of a bureau chief like elder song was at least at the level of a department head. Du Xiaohai looked at manager Lu’s age and knew that manager Lu was probably a vice – Minister leader. Moreover, manager Lu was an employee of elder song, so du Xiaohai had to lower his attitude. “Secretary du,” manager Lu said,”the Bureau chief asked me to pass you a message. He asks you not to feel too much pressure. Just focus on your current work.” Du Xiaohai suddenly felt refreshed, as if he had just drunk iced sour plum soup in the hot summer. He said with a happy expression,”Yes! Thank you for your concern, chief. Please tell the chief that I will definitely deal with the aftermath and ensure that these rioters will be severely punished! I’ll definitely tighten security management in the future to ensure that the city’s atmosphere is clean and positive!” “Okay, Secretary du, I won’t disturb you anymore!” Manager Lu said indifferently. Xia ruofei watched from the side and sighed in his heart. It seemed that elder song still couldn’t bear it! With Xia ruofei’s temper, he would never let it go so easily. However, since elder song had made the decision, Xia ruofei would not question Jian Jia. It was none of his business anyway. Du Xiaohai was full of energy again, and the work efficiency here was much higher. It didn’t take long for more than a hundred ruffians to be handcuffed and escorted to military trucks. Each truck was guarded by more than a dozen armed police officers with live ammunition. The rest of the armed police gathered on the street and prepared to rush back to the city on foot. It was only a dozen kilometers from the city. For these armed police soldiers, it was just a very easy training. The police officers also got into the car. Du Xiaohai came over to report to manager Lu, Xia ruofei, and the others, then they got into the car and left. Du Xiaohai still had a lot of work to do. He had to personally monitor the follow – up interrogations of these people. In addition, there was another urgent matter, which was to rectify the social atmosphere. A city – wide operation to crack down on the underworld and evil would soon be fully launched, and he, as the Secretary, would need to take charge of all these. The town’s old Street regained its peace. Only the neighbors in the neighborhood were still secretly watching from not far away. The big commotion that Gong Jie had caused today was already known to everyone in this small town. It could be predicted that in the future, all kinds of rumors about Niu Yusheng’s electrical appliance repair shop would be popular in the small town. Xia ruofei and the others also returned to the shop. After elder song knew that the crowd had been cleared, he smiled and said to li Zhifu,””Brother Fu, I didn’t expect to cause such a big commotion just by coming to see you ...” “It’s all because of me!”Li Zhifu sighed. It’s a good thing you’re fine, little song. Otherwise, I’d be in deep trouble!” “Brother Fu, what are you saying?” Elder song said,”you should have told me about this in advance. If it wasn’t for this today, I wouldn’t have known that you were injured because of the threats and harassment of those hooligans!” At this point, eccentric song’s expression turned stern.””Some people in the local area are really lawless and too arrogant! He must be severely punished!” Song Rui asked curiously,””Grandpa Li, I heard that the reason why those people threatened and bribed you was to ask you to be the technical advisor of their tea factory. Putting aside their character, this is actually a good thing! Why don’t you agree to leave the mountain?” “I haven’t made tea for anyone for more than ten years, except for the tea I drink myself ...” Li Zhifu shook his head. Then, li Zhifu explained the reason why he didn’t want to show his face in public. It turned out that the market for tea leaves had been on the rise in recent years. Some local tea farmers didn’t pay much attention to their business, and it was very common for them to set prices at random. Some people asked li Zhifu to make a move once, and then they dared to announce that their tea factory had hired a master tea master, li Zhifu, and that all the high – end tea leaves were made by him. In fact, the quality of the tea leaves sold by these people varied. They could sell them at a sky – High price under li Zhifu’s name, but in the end, it would damage li Zhifu’s reputation. After this happened two or three times, li Zhifu, who had always paid attention to his reputation, directly announced to the public that he would quit the tea – making industry and would no longer make tea for any tea factory. Li Zhifu didn’t care about material enjoyment. He valued the inheritance of tea culture more, but he regarded tea as his love. Therefore, over the years, there were many people who offered him attractive high salaries, but he firmly refused all of them. Until this time, Wu De had also set his eyes on li Zhifu’s golden signboard and wanted to invite li Zhifu to come out of retirement. Li Zhifu still refused with a very firm attitude. He simply disdained Wu De’s offer of a hundred thousand annual salary, accommodation, car, and other favorable treatment. It was just that he didn’t expect that Wu De was not a proper businessman. Once the soft temptation failed to achieve his goal, he began to use the threatening method. In the end, the matter was finally blown up and out of control. After hearing li Zhifu’s words, Xia ruofei and the others looked at him with admiration. This old man who was nearly a hundred years old could be said to be the leading figure in the tea making industry, but he still adhered to his professional ethics. Everyone sincerely admired him. “Brother Fu, you’re still the same old brother Fu who couldn’t stand a grain of sand in your eyes!” Elder song sighed. It’s been so many years, and you haven’t changed at all!” “Hehe, I can’t change my bad temper for the rest of my life!” Li Zhifu said with a smile. “Brother Fu, I’m going back to the hotel now.” Elder song stood up and said,”why don’t you come to the hotel with me? There are several rooms in my suite, so we can have a good chat tonight. ” Li Zhifu shook his head and said,”little song, such a big thing happened today. So many leaders are coming. You must have a lot of things to deal with. I won’t go and join in the fun. If you haven’t left Mount Wu Yi by tomorrow, I will go to the hotel to see you!” “That’s fine!”Elder song smiled. Brother Fu, you should rest early today. ” After he finished speaking, elder song also bade farewell to Niu Yusheng and Li Guizhi before walking out. As soon as they stepped out, Huang Fang and the others protected elder song tightly. After what had happened just now, Huang Fang was still very afraid, and now he was even more cautious. Before elder song got into the car, he saw that li Zhifu had also come out with Niu Yusheng and his wife to send him off. He quickly said,””Brother Fu, you don’t have to see me out. It’s windy outside, go in quickly!” “I’m fine, I’m fine!”Li Zhifu said with a smile. Li Zhifu couldn’t help frowning as he said that. He pressed his hand on his stomach, and his face turned pale. “What’s wrong, brother Fu?”elder song asked. Li Zhifu’s expression quickly returned to normal as he said,””It’s okay. Recently, my stomach hurts sometimes, but it’s only for a while. I’ll be fine after that!” Elder song looked at li Zhifu and found that he was indeed fine, so he said,””Alright, brother Fu, I’ll take my leave first. If you’re not feeling well, you should go for a checkup as soon as possible. After all, you’re already so old, and you can’t take any problems with your body lightly. ” “I know, hurry up and get in the car!” Li Zhifu said. Elder song then got into the car. Xia ruofei and the others also got in the car. Li Zhifu’s family stood at the door and waved goodbye to them. The three cars started up slowly and left the electrical repair shop, heading towards the city. “Xiao Lu,” elder song said calmly in the car,”when we reach the hotel later, there’s something you need to do first. Call the relevant leaders in WYS city and ask them to arrange for the best doctor to do a full physical examination for brother Fu!”
