3035 The young great elder (1)

Luo Qingfeng continued to explain,”master, I want to announce to the public that you are the direct disciple of a nascent soul Grandmaster of our sect who has been living in seclusion in the mountains. This time, you have come out to cultivate under the orders of the master. This way, your identity will be closely related to the star Seizer sect. In addition, the modification of the sect’s protective array has been of great help to the sect, so it is reasonable to grant you the title of great elder!” In addition, the next step is for master to screen out the disciples in the sect on a large scale. With this identity, it will be more legitimate!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After Luo Qingfeng finished speaking in one breath, he looked at Xia ruofei with apprehension and asked,””Master, these are just some of this old servant’s rough thoughts. It’s just that the identity of great elder is somewhat unfair to master, what does master think?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”That’s a good arrangement. Let’s do it.”

Luo Qingfeng immediately heaved a sigh of relief and quickly said with a happy expression,””Master, this old servant will immediately gather all the disciples and announce this matter!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Go! I’m going to study this stellar evolution formation for a while longer. Call me when you’re ready. ”

“Yes! Master, this old servant will take his leave!” Luo Qingfeng said quickly.

……

Soon, the melodious sound of a bell rang out in the star Seizer sect.

All the disciples in the sect stopped what they were doing and listened carefully.

Every time the bell rang, it was a major event.

When everyone finally confirmed that the bell had tolled nine times, they quickly put down what they were doing and hurried to a Hall not far north of Zhai Xing Lou.

The bell rang nine times, and all the disciples in the sect had to gather at the heaven seeking Palace within the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. Those who were late or late would be severely punished, and in serious cases, they would be expelled from the sect or even executed.

In the past two days, after Luo Qingfeng had returned to the sect, Zhai Xing Lou had been completely shut down. Even the core disciples were not allowed to approach.

Now that the bell had rung again to gather all the disciples, everyone realized that something big had happened.

After all the disciples entered the heaven seeking Palace, they could not help but shut their mouths. The solemn atmosphere here made everyone afraid to make a sound, even if they had many questions in their hearts, no one dared to whisper to each other.

Rows of futons were placed neatly in the spacious hall. Everyone found their seats according to their seniority, time of entry, and cultivation level, and sat down cross – legged.

The entire heaven seeking Palace could hear a pin drop, and everyone was waiting quietly.

After a while, sect master Luo Qingfeng appeared on the high platform at the front of the hall. Standing beside him was a young cultivator whom none of the star Seizer sect disciples recognized.

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the high platform, wanting to know why the sect leader had gathered everyone.

Luo Qingfeng’s face was dignified. After looking around, he said,””I’ve gathered all the disciples in the heaven seeking Palace today because I have an important announcement to make!”

After saying that, Luo Qingfeng turned his body to the side, making Xia ruofei stand out. Then, he said,””The person beside me is Xia Tian, the direct disciple of a reclusive nascent soul Grandmaster of our star Seizer sect!”

When Xia ruofei walked in the world of cultivation, he used the identity and appearance of ‘Xia Tian’.

With his current cultivation, it wasn’t difficult for him to maintain his appearance for a long time.

The star Seizer sect disciples were so shocked that they even forgot the rules. After a brief moment of shock, they couldn’t help but start whispering to each other.

Of course, the focus of everyone’s attention was not the young ‘Xia Tian’, but the ‘nascent soul Grandmaster’ that Luo Qingfeng had mentioned.

In today’s cultivation world, the top combat power on the surface was the Golden core cultivators. The forces in the cultivation world were also divided according to the number of golden core cultivators in the force. The so – called top, first – rate, and second – rate sects were nothing more than whether they had golden core cultivators and how many golden core cultivators they had.

However, other than Aurous core stage cultivators, there were all sorts of legends circulating in the cultivation world, all of which were related to nascent Soul Stage old monsters.

For example, the number one sect, the first heaven sect, not only had many Aurous core stage cultivators, but everyone also thought that the first heaven sect had a nascent Soul Stage cultivator.

In other sects, the news about the reclusive nascent soul cultivators was also endless, and it was difficult to distinguish the truth from the false.

But no matter what, a nascent soul cultivator was obviously a deterrent force.

No one might have seen a nascent soul cultivator in the past few years, but if a sect had a nascent soul cultivator as its backer, even if the sect did not have a golden core cultivator, ordinary forces would not easily provoke them.

The star Seizer sect’s strength had been constantly declining in recent years, and its status in the cultivation world was also declining day by day. If they really had a Yuanying stage ancestor, it would undoubtedly be a shot in the arm.

How could everyone not be excited when they first heard this news?

Luo Qingfeng heard the buzzing sound below and could not help but frown. He shouted in a deep voice,””Silence!”

All the disciples immediately fell silent and quickly shut their mouths.

Luo Qingfeng continued.”Junior Brother Xia has been following the nascent soul Grandmaster since he was a child. He has been cultivating in seclusion. Now that he has achieved some success, the Grandmaster ordered him to enter the world to cultivate. That’s why he returned to the star Seizer sect!” In fact, according to seniority, Junior Brother Xia is several generations older than me, but he insists on treating me as an equal and calls me senior brother. He also said that this was the intention of the Yuanying ancestor. I can’t disobey the elder’s order, so I can only accept it!”
