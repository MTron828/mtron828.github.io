Chapter 1303: Spectacular_1

Translator: 549690339

At around 11 am, a light yellow Toyota Coaster slowly pulled up in front of the complex of Paradise Farm.

With a beep, the automatic door slowly opened. CEO Lin was the first to step out of the car because he saw the chairman of paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei, and the General Manager, Feng Jing, standing in front of the building, waiting for him.

Xia ruofei and Feng Rao also stepped forward.

This time, Xia ruofei was counting on this deal to pay for the 350 million from bojun real estate, so he was paying a lot of attention to it.

President Lin’s attendants also came out of the car. Xia ruofei even saw the old Chinese medical doctor Huang, whom he had interacted with a few times before, among them.

“Brother Xia!” President Lin enthusiastically quickened his steps and walked in front of Xia ruofei.

“President Lin, you’ve had a long journey!” Xia ruofei smiled and extended his hand.

President Lin shook hands with Xia ruofei enthusiastically and asked impatiently,””Brother Xia, where’s the thing?”

“Let’s go to my office!”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Just like that, without any small talk, the group of people went straight to Xia ruofei’s office.

Xia ruofei knew that CEO Lin was in a hurry, so he did not keep him in suspense. He walked to the corner of the office, opened the safe, took out a sealed bag, and placed it on the coffee table.

There were two kilograms of aweto inside.

Xia ruofei did not take out all the Cordyceps. A hundred kilograms of Cordyceps was not small. He could not possibly pile them all in the office. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

President Lin didn’t say anything and personally opened the sealed plastic bag. He reached out and grabbed a handful of Cordyceps.

Hiss ...

Everyone in Tongren Hall, from President Lin to Dr. Huang, and even the retinues, took a deep breath at the same time. Then, they widened their eyes and stared at the aweto in President Lin’s hand.

President Lin’s hands were even trembling.

The six or seven wormgrass that he had casually caught was simply perfect. It was even better than the 500 grams he had bought last time.

He put his hand to his nose and took a deep breath. Suddenly, he felt a strong smell of butter.

Combined with the shape and color of the wormgrass, it was without a doubt the most authentic wormgrass of Nagqu.

However, the quantity of the top quality Cordyceps was extremely low. How could Xia ruofei produce so much? CEO Lin’s heart was also filled with doubts.

However, this was not his first time doing business with Xia ruofei. Wasn’t it the same with the premium iron – Skin maple?

No matter how one looked at it, it was a pure wild top – grade iron – Skin Kaede. After professional laboratory tests, the nutritional content was even better than the best wild iron – Skin Kaede on the market.

However, Xia ruofei had the ability to supply in bulk, which made people unconvinced.

Mr. Lin gave the aweto to to Dr. Huang, who was standing next to him. Then, he asked his other subordinates to grab some from the sealed bag to identify.

Xia ruofei smiled as he sat in his office chair. He was very sure that the business today would be successful.

President Lin and the others were getting more and more excited because the quality of this batch of Cordyceps was too even. They simply grabbed a handful from the bag and saw that they were almost all the same size and of the same high quality.

Feng Jing didn’t know much about aweto, but when she saw how excited President Lin and the others were, she couldn’t help but pick one up from the bag out of curiosity.

The caterpillar fungus was actually a strong worm with a blade of grass on its head. Although Feng Jing knew it was a nourishing herb, she still couldn’t help but shiver and quickly threw it back into the bag.

She looked at the expressions on President Lin and the others ‘faces as if they had seen the most beautiful women in the world, and she could not help but feel a chill in her heart.

Finally, President Lin recovered from his excitement and asked anxiously,””President Xia, we’re taking all these wormgrass! We can offer you 750000 Chinese dollars per kilogram!”

750,000! Feng Rao was also excited when she heard the price.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Mr. Lin, there’s no hurry. You guys should take a look at the quality of the wormgrass first.” This isn’t the only amount of goods I have!”

President Lin was stunned for a moment, but then he immediately understood what Xia ruofei said on the phone. He said that he had a business deal of tens of millions. The Cordyceps here was at most two kilograms. Even if he sold it at 750 thousand per unit, it would only be a little more than a million.

If the transaction amount really reached tens of millions, then ...

CEO Lin did some quick calculations in his mind and came to the conclusion that he needed at least a hundred kilograms of such high – Quality wormgrass.

He felt like he was having difficulty breathing.

Hundreds of kilograms of high – Quality Cordyceps, for the entire Tongren Hall, could be said to be a big purchase. This kind of top – grade nourishing herb could only be found by luck, not by searching for it. Tongren Hall had always been willing to pay any price to acquire it, because it was really important for building a brand image.

Moreover, even if such aweto was purchased at the price of 750000, Tongren Hall would still make a lot of profit.

More than 100 kilograms seemed like a lot, but China was so big, and Tongren Hall had stores in almost all the prefecture – Level cities and above. After they spread it all over the country, this little amount of goods was nothing.

There were so many rich people nowadays, and they were very willing to spend money for health. It was easy to sell hundreds of kilograms of wormgrass.
