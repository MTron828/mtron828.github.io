2686 A thorough investigation (3)

Finally, the last employee also finished his “interview” and left the small conference room. Liu Qingfeng quickly walked in and immediately turned around to close the door of the conference room.

“President Xia ... Uh ... Commissioner Xu, how did the interview go?” Liu Qingfeng asked.

These people were all carefully selected by him and were basically the minimum number needed to maintain the normal operation of the Peach Blossom Island. He didn’t want any of them to fail, otherwise, wouldn’t it be a problem with his vision?

Xia ruofei was arranging the forms on the table. These were the resumes of the employees who had been interviewed today.

He tidied up the stack of forms and put them aside. Then, he picked up two forms on the other side and said without looking up,””The overall situation is not bad. These two people ... Zeng Zilong and Jiang dandan ... Let them prepare and return to China with that group of people today!”

Liu Qingfeng’s face revealed a strange look, and he quickly asked,”Xia ... Commissioner Xu, is there a problem with these two people? The two of them were usually quite honest! And their background is clean, I know them quite well ...”

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”it’s not a big problem, but it might not be suitable to work on Peach Blossom Island.” Don’t tell them anything. Tell them this isn’t an elimination and that they should go back and arrange their work. ”

“Alright ...” Liu Qingfeng said with a bitter smile.

In fact, it was not an elimination, but 50 people participated in the “interview” and only two people were sent back. If that was not elimination, what was it? The two young men would be greatly affected by this.

Xia ruofei raised his head and glanced at Liu Qingfeng. He knew that Liu Qingfeng was definitely unwilling. But Xia ruofei did not explain too much. He only said,””The others can stay! Especially with so few people, the workload will definitely increase. I hope everyone can overcome the difficulties and persevere through this period. ”

Xia ruofei was actually being very tactful. Zeng Zilong and Jiang dandan did not pass Xia ruofei’s screening.

Both of them had fallen to the same problem.

If someone was willing to pay you a high price to buy information about the situation on Peach Blossom Island, would you agree?

Under the state of hypnosis, both of them chose the correct answer.

In other words, although these two people had not betrayed Paradise Island for the time being, once there were enough benefits, they would most likely choose to betray it.

Naturally, Xia ruofei could not allow such a person to stay on Peach Blossom Island.

In his previous questions, he had confirmed that the two of them had not actually betrayed Tao Yuan, or they might not have had the chance to do so at all. Otherwise, it would not have been as simple as sending them back to their country.

“Okay, Commissioner Xu!” Liu Qingfeng replied.

“By the way, without Zeng Zilong and Jiang dandan, do we have enough people?” Xia ruofei asked again.

“They’re not in the core positions, and their technical skills aren’t particularly good. If the other employees do more work, they should be able to fill in their vacancies.” Liu Qingfeng said.

The list of people returning to China had already been confirmed. Liu Qingfeng really didn’t want to go through it again. If he chose two people to replace Zeng Zilong and Jiang dandan, Xia ruofei would definitely have to go through “interviews” again, and it would be a hassle.

Rather than that, it would be better to let the remaining employees share the burden.

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”hurry up and make the arrangements! Also, inform the airport that there should be a Chartered plane landing on Peach Blossom Island today. I’ve also sent some of my men in. ”

“Alright!” Liu Qingfeng quickly said,”Commissioner Xu, do you need us to make any preparations in advance?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”mainly about food and accommodation.” As for accommodation ... Now that many of your people have left, the mobile temporary houses at the previous construction site have been vacated. This afternoon, arrange for some people to build a few mobile temporary houses next to the airport warehouse. As for the food, ask the canteen to prepare more. The first batch of about 50 people will arrive, so we’ll send food over together!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Xia ruofei did not want the brothers of the Hong sect to have too much contact with the people who used to work on Peach Blossom Island. That was why he made such an arrangement.

“Alright!” Liu Qingfeng replied,”I’ll arrange it immediately!”

“Mm! Thank you for your hard work, everyone!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

After that, he didn’t change his appearance anymore and directly left the small conference room as the “personnel Commissioner” of paradise corporation’s headquarters. He then drove the car in the direction of the airport warehouse.
