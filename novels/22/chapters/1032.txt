Translator: 549690339

Xue Jinshan had already processed the herbs according to Xia ruofei’s instructions. He was chatting with a few veterans who were in charge of the security of the control room.

In fact, Xue Jinshan didn’t dare to go far for the entire afternoon. He was supposed to patrol the workshop that was producing the heart – nourishing soup a few times, but today he handed it over to the Deputy Director.

When he heard Xia ruofei’s voice, he immediately responded loudly and walked over quickly.

Xia ruofei waved at the three veterans and said,””Liu Lin, you guys can continue with your shift!”

Then, he turned to Xue Jinshan and said, “Let’s go. Take me to the herb preparation workshop.”

Xue Jinshan quickly led the way and brought Xia ruofei to the herb preparation workshop.

He had specially found a separate room to store the medicinal ingredients that Xia ruofei had asked him to buy at the last minute. He had personally brought a few of his most trusted employees to process the medicinal ingredients.

“President Xia, these are the medicinal herbs you wanted. Please take a look and see if the quantity and type are correct.” Xue Jinshan said respectfully.

These medicinal herbs were placed in different categories. The few medicinal herbs that Xue Jinshan and his men had ground were placed separately at the side, and they were also labeled accordingly.

Xia ruofei glanced at it and had an idea. He nodded and said,””Not bad, not bad. Kanayama, we might have to work overtime today. Take a few trustworthy and skilled workers with you and stay behind.”

Xue Jinshan knew that Xia ruofei was going to deal with these herbs, so he quickly said,”Alright, President Xia. We’ll wait for you outside!”

Xia ruofei nodded. Xue Jinshan immediately left the room and closed the door.

After Xue Jinshan left, Xia ruofei did not immediately process the medicinal herbs. He had long developed a habit of being cautious and careful, so he first checked the room very carefully to make sure that there was no monitoring equipment.

Even though Xue Jinshan was a trustworthy employee, Xia ruofei did not let his guard down.

Xia ruofei was already very experienced in counter – reconnaissance, and now that he had strong mental power, if there was any spy device in the house, it would be exposed. He quickly checked it and confirmed that it was safe.

Then, Xia ruofei walked to the herbs.

According to the minimum standard of feeding these medicinal materials to the production line, they could be produced almost three times. Of course, about half of these medicinal materials were completely useless for the Jade skin cream, but many of them could be used for the refining of the pregnancy soup and body tempering soup.

Hence, the first thing Xia ruofei did was to pick out all the unrelated medicinal herbs. Of course, he kept all the herbs that were related to the pregnancy soup and body tempering soup in his interspace.

Xia ruofei threw the rest of the useless herbs into the grinder and threw them aside.

Then, Xia ruofei started to process the herbs needed to make the jaded skin ointment.

Other than the medicinal ingredients that Xue Jinshan had brought people to grind, the rest of the process, according to Xia ruofei’s design, had to be divided into three batches.

Xia ruofei mixed the ingredients from the same batch together and crushed them. Then, he divided them into three portions and labeled them.

Most of these herbs were roots, leaves, and the like. After a certain degree of crushing, they were mixed together. Unless someone used a special instrument to analyze them, it was basically impossible to restore their composition.

After processing the medicinal herbs, the sky outside gradually darkened. However, the workshop next door that produced the heart – nourishing soup was still working, but the workers were taking shifts to rest.

Xia ruofei opened the door and called Xue Jinshan and a few skilled workers in. He explained the trial production process to them in detail.

Of course, it was mainly the processes that required human intervention. The other processes such as heating, adding water, stirring, and separation were highly confidential and were automatically completed by the central computer. Xia ruofei naturally did not have to explain too much. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

There weren’t many parts that involved manual labor, and it wasn’t complicated either. Xue Jinshan and the others recorded it down very seriously, then nodded to show that they had remembered it.

Hence, Xia ruofei said,”that’s good. Kanayama will assign work to everyone. Then, each of you will receive a set of raw materials. Everyone, please take your places!”

“Alright, director Xia!” Xue Jinshan’s voice was slightly excited.

Although he didn’t know what the new product Xia ruofei was testing was, with the heart – nourishing soup, Xue Jinshan was full of anticipation for the new product.

He was no longer a fresh college student. After this period of experience, his working ability had greatly improved, and his prestige in the pharmaceutical factory was also very high.

Xue Jinshan quickly assigned the tasks. Every worker had a corresponding job, and he was responsible for overall coordination and inspection, as well as handling emergency situations.

The workers brought the raw materials to their assigned positions, while Xia ruofei brought Xue Jinshan back to the control room.

“Everyone, report on your preparations!” Xue Jinshan picked up the control room’s walkie – talkie and said in a deep voice.

“Work desk 1 is ready!”

“Work desk No. 2 is ready!”

......

Xue Jinshan turned his gaze to Xia ruofei.

“Let’s begin!”Xia ruofei nodded.

With that, Xia ruofei opened the sealed production program on his computer, double – clicked to run it, and then pressed the green button on the interface.
