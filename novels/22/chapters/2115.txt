2116 Goose – raising plan (1)

Xia ruofei stayed in the company until around 11 O’ clock. He picked up his bag and left for the farm. He could make it in time for lunch in the canteen.

Now, Xia ruofei was getting lazier and lazier. If he could avoid cooking, he would try not to cook.

He had lunch with the workers in the farm cafeteria and returned to the small villa for a short lunch break. He went downstairs at 2:20 sharp and walked to the complex building that had become much more deserted.

“Chairman!”

“Chairman!”

Xue Jinshan and Cao tieshu had already arrived at the small meeting room on the second floor.

The meeting room looked very clean, and it was obvious that someone had cleaned it in advance. Otherwise, there would definitely be a layer of dust on it since no one had used it for such a long time. There was also a steaming cup of tea on Xia ruofei’s seat.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re well prepared!” I thought I’d have to clean up before the meeting!”

“Chairman, after factory manager Xue called me in the morning, I asked my wife to bring a few employees from the cafeteria to clean up the conference room and boil two pots of water,” Cao tieshu said with a smile.

“Thank you for your hard work, sister – in – Law ...” Xia ruofei said. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s just a matter of convenience, you don’t have to be so polite!” Cao tieshu said.

Cao tieshu used to be a fisherman. During the No – Fishing season, he would farm a little. After working at the peach blossom company, Xia ruofei entrusted him with important tasks. Now, Cao tieshu was in charge of the farm business.

Cao tieshu did not let Xia ruofei down. He managed the farm in an orderly manner and took in dozens of workers who were all very impressed with his management. The current Cao tieshu was more dignified than before and looked like a middle – ranking employee in the company.

Xia ruofei came to his seat and sat down, indicating for Xue Jinshan and Cao tieshu to sit down as well. Then, he went straight to the point and said,”Jin Shan, big brother Cao, the company is preparing to develop a new product, which will mainly involve the business that you two are in charge of. We need the full cooperation of the pharmaceutical factory and the farm, so I called you here today to let you know and to give you some preliminary work,” Wang Yao said.

Xue Jinshan and Cao tieshu were very excited when they heard this.

Xue Jinshan, in particular, immediately said,”Chairman, we’re going to release a new product! This was a good thing! I also think that our pharmaceutical factory’s product line is a bit too singular. We only have two kinds of Jade skin cream and heart nourishing soup ...”

Xia ruofei laughed.”Kanayama, I’m afraid you’re going to be disappointed. This time, the farm is the main focus of the product. The pharmaceutical factory is just a support.”

“Ah?” Xue Jinshan was stunned.

Cao tieshu became extremely excited. He rubbed his hands and said,”Chairman, if you need us to do anything, just assign us the task!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’ll give you a brief introduction.” “The company might be trying to start the breeding industry soon, mainly the Strasburg goose ...”

“What ... What goose?” Cao tieshu was a little confused and couldn’t help but ask.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s a Strasburg goose!” Big brother Cao, you don’t have to know what it’s called. It’s just a kind of goose, but it’s different from the ones raised at home. This kind of goose is mainly used to provide foie gras, a very common ingredient in Western food!”

After all, Xue Jinshan was a University Graduate, so he was more knowledgeable than Cao tieshu. He immediately replied,””Chairman, foie gras isn’t cheap! I’ve heard that the price of foie gras in some top restaurants is comparable to gold!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”that’s right!” The products produced by our company must be the best of the best, and the foie gras this time is no exception!”

At this point, Xia ruofei looked at Xue Jinshan and Cao tieshu and continued,””The breeding of Strasburg geese is mainly done on the farm. Isn’t the farm expanding this time? We need to revise our plan and draw out enough area for breeding farms. Kanayama, you’re in charge of the entire construction site, so I’ll leave this job to you. ”

“No problem!” Xue Jinshan readily agreed. He then asked,”Chairman, do you have any specific requirements for the construction of the farm?”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”just build it like a normal farm. But remember, design it to be spacious. If the terrain is suitable and there is enough space, try to design it as free – range farming. Don’t design it like those overseas where you can breed it densely.”

He was also worried that Xue Jinshan would inquire about the information after hearing that they were raising Strasburg geese, and finally design a “concentration camp”- style farm specially prepared for the feeding method, so he specially reminded him.

Xue Jinshan nodded and said,”sure!” I’ll consult a professional in this field later. The expansion of the farm has just finished leveling the land, so there’s still time to modify the design. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”You can consult a professional. However, you must remember what I’ve just said!”

“Understood!” Xue Jinshan said.

Xia ruofei then looked at Cao tieshu and said,””Big brother Cao, you have to make preparations in advance. First, you have to recruit some employees. If they have working experience on the farm or have been in the breeding industry, you can have priority in recruiting them. The person in charge of the farm must have experience in this area.”
