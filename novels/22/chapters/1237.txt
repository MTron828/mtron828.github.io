Chapter 1238: Victory in the first battle (1)

Translator: 549690339

Blake’s tone was as if he was giving alms. MA Xiong’s face darkened. He did not expect the young and aggressive Blake to be so domineering. He had already started to provoke Xia ruofei before he even entered the arena.

Xia ruofei’s expression did not change. He glanced at Blake and said,”Take care of our business? Perhaps you’ll be disappointed, but you won’t be able to bid for any truffles today!”

Blake sneered and said,””You can buy truffles with money. What a big joke!”

Xia ruofei ignored Blake and said to MA Xiong,””Mr. MA, let’s go in!”

MA Xiong immediately nodded and glared at Blake. Then, he said to Xia ruofei,”Xia Sheng, please!”

The two of them had just taken two steps when Xia ruofei heard Blake’s surprised voice from behind.””Monica! You’ve come ...”

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and turned around. He saw Monica, who was dressed in a luxurious gown, walking out of the elevator with elegant steps.

She was tall to begin with, and with a pair of handmade high heels from Ferragamo, her long legs looked even more slender. When she walked over with elegant steps, she immediately attracted many stunned gazes.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think of last night’s charming scene and his heart couldn’t help but skip a beat.

Monica’s eyebrows furrowed slightly at the enthusiastic Blake, and then she nodded at him as a greeting.

Then, she shifted her gaze to Xia ruofei. A beautiful smile bloomed on her delicate face. She quickened her pace and walked towards Xia ruofei.

“Xia! It’s a pleasure to meet you again in the beautiful Hong Kong!” Monica said in English.

Xia ruofei also pretended that they had just met and smiled.””Monica, you’re getting more and more beautiful!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Monica glanced at Xia ruofei flirtatiously. At this time, she had already walked in front of Xia ruofei. Without hesitation, she hugged Xia ruofei and kissed him on the cheek.

While they were hugging, Monica pinched Xia ruofei’s waist lightly. This small action in front of everyone made Xia ruofei’s heart skip a beat. He felt nervous and excited.

Although hugging and kissing were normal European customs, Xia ruofei still attracted many envious gazes to be able to hug a beauty like Monica.

When Feng Rao saw this scene from a distance, she didn’t know why, but she felt a faint sorrow in her heart.

Blake’s eyes were almost on fire.

Just now, he had taken the initiative to greet Monica, and the two of them were old acquaintances. Even the Grao family that Monica belonged to and the black family that he belonged to had the intention of matchmaking the two of them for marriage, but Monica had been so cold to him.

Following that, Monica hugged Xia ruofei and pressed her face against his.

The difference in treatment almost drove Blake crazy with jealousy.

There was a deep chill in his eyes as he gritted his teeth and stared at Xia ruofei. He clenched his fists under his sleeves so tightly that his nails were almost piercing into his flesh.

Blake really wanted to go up and beat Xia ruofei up, but in the end, his rationality won over his impulse. He just stood there and watched Xia ruofei, Monica, and MA Xiong walk into the auction venue while talking and laughing.

“Chinese country bumpkin, I’ll definitely teach you a lesson!” Blake said in his heart with hatred.

Blake also stepped into the auction hall. He didn’t have an invitation, so after checking the security deposit receipt and ordinary admission ticket at the entrance, he was led to the ordinary area at the back by the staff.

Xia ruofei, Monica, MA Xiong, and the others were naturally seated in the guest area in the middle of the front row.

MA Xiong was also a smart person. He arranged Xia ruofei and Monica to sit next to each other.

After Xia ruofei and Monica sat down, MA Xiong greeted them and left his seat to chat with his old friends who had been invited to the auction.

MA Xiong didn’t introduce Xia ruofei to his friends before the auction started. There was a small Appreciation Luncheon after the auction. Those who were invited were MA Xiong’s old friends of many years. Each of them was an influential figure in Hong Kong and held an important position in the upper class of their respective industries.

MA Xiong planned to introduce the place to Xia ruofei during the lunch as it would be more suitable for them to interact.

After MA Xiong left, Xia ruofei and Monica were left in their seats.

However, there were cameras everywhere in the venue, and there were many people behind them. There were also cameras from the media everywhere, so the two of them still sat upright and did not dare to do anything out of line.

Of course, although the two of them were sitting in their seats without looking at each other, they could still speak softly. However, when they spoke, they would cover their mouths with their hands to prevent others from reading their lips. The Hong Kong paparazzi were too powerful, so Xia ruofei had to be careful.

“Monica, are you done resting?” Xia ruofei asked in a low voice.

Monica’s eyes were looking forward, as if she was watching the official promotional video of the auction very seriously. At the same time, she covered her mouth and said softly,””Very good! I feel full of energy now. Xia, you’re a man with magic!”
