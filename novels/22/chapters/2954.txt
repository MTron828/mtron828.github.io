2955 Inside information (1)

In fact, Xia ruofei had considered the risk of the Qi gathering pills and talismans being sold to other sects.

After all, the current situation in the cultivation world was like this. Resources were extremely scarce. Even among the senior and junior brothers of the same sect, there were open and secret struggles, not to mention different sects.

However, Xia ruofei felt that even if a set of spirit gathering talismans and a hundred Chi – amassing pills were given to the same sect, there would be a limit to how much they could improve.

In addition, as long as he was willing to spend time on these things, he could have as many as he wanted.

If he really had to consider the contest between the sects, he would just have to spend some time and effort to nurture the star Seizer sect.

All in all, the items he took out for auction were not enough to create a huge gap between the sects. Moreover, the possibility of these resources being concentrated in the hands of the same sect was very small, including the Qi gathering pills, which he had auctioned separately. These resources themselves were not a lot, and if they were scattered among several sects, there was even less to worry about.

Xia ruofei saw Luo Qingfeng put away the three protective array talismans and said,””I’ll prepare these three things for now! When the time comes, if the spirit stones are still not enough, we should be able to temporarily add more items, right?”

“No problem!” Qingfeng Luo said with certainty,”this auction is meant to promote communication between sects. Everyone has treasures that they can’t use, and it’s a waste to leave them unused. Other cultivators might need them, so they took advantage of the auction to exchange their treasures. Therefore, the rules aren’t that rigid, and you can basically add items to the auction at any time. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s good!” Qingfeng, adopted husband, you two go back to your rooms and rest! The auction is tomorrow!”

“Yes! Master!”

“Martial granduncle, this disciple will take his leave!”

After Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu left, Xia ruofei took a shower, sat cross – legged on the bed, and cultivated for a while. Then, he fell asleep.

The next day, Xia ruofei had breakfast in his room.

Many cultivators liked peace and quiet. When they reached the Golden core stage, it didn’t matter if they ate or not. They would often cultivate for days without eating. Although Xia ruofei had already reached the beginning stage of the Golden elixir realm, he had only cultivated for a short period of time. He still maintained his normal lifestyle.

However, there were many cultivators this time. Xia ruofei wanted to keep a low profile and did not go to the restaurant to eat. Instead, he called the front desk and asked them to send breakfast to his room.

After asking the waiter to clear the plates, Xia ruofei wanted to meet up with Qingfeng Luo and Yifu li, but his phone rang before he left.

Xia ruofei took a look at the caller ID and saw that it was a local landline number.

Xia ruofei didn’t have any friends or acquaintances in the southwest. His heart skipped a beat as he thought about how he could sense Liu chengfeng’s soul seal more clearly. He immediately determined that the caller was probably Liu chengfeng.

Hence, Xia ruofei returned to his room and set up a soundproof barrier before answering the call.

“Hello?” Xia ruofei asked calmly,”who is it?”

Sure enough, Liu chengfeng’s excited voice came from the phone,””Master, it’s your subordinate!”

“Chengfeng!” Although Xia ruofei had already expected this, he still revealed a happy smile and asked,”you’ve arrived in Shuangqing city?”

There was a connection between the child and mother soul seals. The closer the distance, the clearer the connection. Hence, when Xia ruofei woke up in the morning and found that Liu chengfeng’s soul seal had become very clear, he knew that he must have come to Shuangqing city.

As expected, Liu chengfeng said respectfully,””Yes! I was transferred here to protect the auction ... Master, are you also in Shuangqing city? So, you’re here to attend the auction?”

Because of the auction, many cultivators had gathered in Shuangqing city. If Xia ruofei appeared in Shuangqing at this time, he was most likely here for the auction. This was Liu chengfeng’s normal judgment.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yes!” This is the first time I’ve heard of such a gathering between cultivators, so I’m here to broaden my horizons!”

“Master,” Liu chengfeng quickly said,”as far as I know, many of the people attending the auction are high – Level executives of major sects, including many golden core cultivators. Master, you must pay attention to your safety during the double celebration! In addition ... If you accidentally offend an expert, please inform this subordinate at once! This subordinate’s position in the sect has been getting higher and higher, and the sect leader and elders have been focusing on training me. It shouldn’t be a problem for me to go to them and mediate!”

Xia ruofei’s heart felt warm.””I know. Chengfeng, you don’t have to worry about your safety. I’m with the sect master of the star Seizer sect, Luo Qingfeng.” In addition ... I’ve already broken through to the early jiedan stage, so I should have no problem protecting myself. ”

Hearing this, Liu chengfeng couldn’t help but gasp,””Master, you ... You’ve already broken through a major realm! This cultivation speed was simply shocking! Master is truly a peerless genius!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s not that exaggerated. I was just lucky.” Chengfeng, you’ll be busy with the auction for the next two days. Even if you see us, you’d better pretend that you don’t know us. After the auction is over, we’ll find an opportunity to meet again. ”

Xia ruofei letting Liu chengfeng return to luoye sect was equivalent to planting a nail in the sect. Although the fallen leaves sect might not become Xia ruofei’s enemy in the future, it was still necessary to plan ahead.

Since he was going to plant a mole, he naturally couldn’t let anyone find out that he had any connection with Liu chengfeng.

“I understand! Master!” Liu chengfeng said,”I’ll keep the phone we use to contact each other on for the next two days. You can contact me at any time!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Just as he was about to hang up the phone, he suddenly had an idea and asked,””By the way, chengfeng, do you know anything about the auction items?”

“I’ve been in charge of sorting out the information related to the auction,”said Liu chengfeng.”I’m also in charge of making the auction manual, so I know more or less about the auction items.” Master, what do you want to know?”

Xia ruofei asked,”I have my eyes on that pair of storage rings.” Tell me what you know. ”

“That pair of storage rings should be the most popular item in this auction, master,” said Liu chengfeng immediately. “I expect a fierce fight to be held over it.” Our internal department has determined that this pair of storage rings should be able to reach a price of around 30000 spirit stones, or even higher. After all, anything can happen at an auction, and it’s possible that someone will be so hot – headed as to bid an astronomical price. ”

“Okay, continue ...” Xia ruofei said calmly.

Liu chengfeng’s estimated price was probably made by the internal department of the sect according to the situation of the auction item and the financial resources of the cultivators who participated in the auction. It was more or less a reference value.

This price was slightly higher than what Xia ruofei had expected, but he did not take it to heart.

“This pair of storage rings was entrusted by Mu Sheng, the sect leader of the surging waves sect in the southwest, to be auctioned off,” Liu chengfeng continued.”It’s said that sect leader mu is in urgent need of a spiritual herb, but he doesn’t have enough spiritual stones, so he had to part with it.”

This was the advantage of having a mole. In the auction manual, the client who entrusted the auction item was confidential. Although it would be possible to find out if he spent some effort, how could it be more convenient than directly asking the organizer?

“As far as I know, sect leader MU’s mental price is also 30000 spiritual stones,” said Liu chengfeng.”The higher the price, the better. But he might not sell it if it’s below this price.” This is because he won’t have enough spirit stones to buy that spirit herb. ”

“Chengfeng, do you know what spiritual herb sect leader mu wants to buy?” Xia ruofei nodded and asked.

“I’m sorry, master,” Liu chengfeng said with some shame.”I’m really not too sure about this ... However, it’s said that it’s a spiritual herb that nourishes the meridians. It’s said that leader MU’s only son had an accident during his cultivation and his meridians were severely damaged. He urgently needs this medicine to repair his damaged meridians. The spiritual herb he’s buying this time is also said to be related to the meridian nourishment. Of course, these are all rumors, and I can’t guarantee their authenticity. ”

Xia ruofei smiled gently and said,””It doesn’t matter. The information you’ve provided is very important! It’s of great help to me. Thank you, chengfeng!”

Liu chengfeng was a little flattered and quickly said,””Master, you’re too kind. This is what I should do.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Do you know anything else about the storage ring?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Liu chengfeng thought for a moment and said,”master, I heard that many cultivators are very interested in these two storage rings. Among them, elder Yang Liu of the flying flower Valley and young sect leader Wu Ming of the spirit Vulture mountain are even more determined to get them. Wu Ming even spread the word that he hopes that everyone will give him face and not compete with him.” It’s said that Wu Ming wanted to buy this pair of storage rings and give them to a pair of female twin cultivators ...”

A smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. It seemed that many things were related to the cultivation world and the secular world. At least, this young sect leader Wu Ming seemed to have many similarities with the rich second generation of the secular world.

Liu chengfeng thought for a while and said,””Master, that’s all I know. If you’re interested in that pair of storage rings, you’d better be mentally prepared. The competition may be very fierce. ”

“I know! Thank you, chengfeng!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you went outside to make a call, right? Let’s not talk too much. You should go back quickly to avoid suspicion. I’ll contact you if there’s anything!”

“Yes! Master, please take care and be careful!” Liu chengfeng said.

...

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei hung up the phone.

He had originally wanted to go out to find Qingfeng Luo and Yifu li, but after the call with Liu chengfeng, he was not in a hurry to go out.

The auction would only start at night. There was still some time during the day, so Xia ruofei decided to do some preparation work.

He walked over and locked the door from the inside, then turned on the do not disturb light. Then, he returned to his bedroom, locked the doors and windows, and drew the curtains.

Following that, talismans were scattered out, and array barriers with different functions lit up one by one. Xia ruofei took out the spirit map scroll from his palm after he was done with the protection.

He also stuffed the spirit map scroll into his bed and entered the medium with a thought.
