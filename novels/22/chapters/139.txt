Chapter 140: The news from Hong Kong (1)

“It’s true, but I don’t have any girls. Why don’t you send me a few?” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “You wish!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”if one is not enough, how many more do you want?” “I don’t even have one, okay?” Xia ruofei cried out, full of grievances. After he said this, the two of them fell into silence. Because they all thought of the meaning behind the words that Ling Qingxue had blurted out. “Uh ...” Xia ruofei broke the awkward silence. “Dumbo!” Ling Qingxue lowered her eyes and said,”Happy New Year!” “Happy New Year!” Xia ruofei said subconsciously. As soon as he finished speaking, Ling Qingxue quickly hung up the phone. Xia ruofei sat there with his phone in his hand for a long time. He was thinking that he should be more proactive after the new year. The lady’s intentions were already very obvious. Xia ruofei also had feelings for Ling Qingxue. Thinking of this, Xia ruofei picked up his phone and sent a WeChat message to Ling Qingxue: Qingxue, do you have time during the new year? Come to my farm to play! After a while, a WeChat notification rang. Xia ruofei opened it and saw Ling Qingxue’s one – Word reply: MMH! Xia ruofei grinned and put his phone aside. He didn’t plan to enter the spirit map space again. He went to the bathroom to take a shower and then fell asleep. Xia ruofei slept soundly that night. Even the firecrackers in the morning of the first day of the new year did not wake him up. He only woke up at nineo’ clock. The precise biological clock that he had developed in the Army seemed to have begun to degenerate, but this was nothing. Sleeping until he woke up naturally and counting money until his hands cramped-wasn’t this the life that many people dreamed of? If he were to return home after retiring and still live strictly according to the Army’s work and rest schedule, that would be old – fashioned! After washing up, Xia ruofei put on his slippers and went downstairs. Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared breakfast. Ye Lingyun had already woken up and was practicing military boxing in the courtyard. His head was steaming, and he had obviously been practicing for a while. In this aspect, Xia ruofei could not compare to ye Lingyun. This kid had always stuck to the Army’s daily routine. He would get up at six in the morning and go to the courtyard for physical training. In his own words, he was now the head of security at the Paradise Corporation, so he couldn’t neglect his culinary skills. Xia ruofei suspected that if it wasn’t for the fact that guns couldn’t be bought in the country, this kid would probably not even skip his shooting training. Hu Zi’s mother saw Xia ruofei coming down and greeted him with a smile.””If it flies! Come and have breakfast!” “Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and replied,”Auntie, where’s Qiao’ er?” “This girl is still sleeping! Ignore her, let’s eat first!” Hu Zi’s mother said. “Woof! “You still dared to call me a lazy bum yesterday ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”You actually woke up later than me ...” “This girl had a lot of fun last night and didn’t go to bed until one. She hasn’t been this happy in a long time ...” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile. “We’ll all be happy in the future!” Xia ruofei said. “En!” Hu Zi’s mother nodded and said,”come and eat quickly. Otherwise, the congee will get cold ...” Then, Hu ‘Zi’s mother stuck her head out and shouted,””Little ye! Stop practicing, let’s eat!” “Aunty, please eat first. I’ll be done soon ...” Ye Lingyun replied. Xia ruofei turned around and saw that he had finished a set of military boxing and was now doing push – ups quickly. He smiled at Hu Zi’s mother and said,””Auntie, don’t worry about him. This guy won’t eat until he’s done with his training. Let’s eat ...” According to the custom of the southeast province, the first meal on the first day of the new year was vegetarian. Because it was difficult for most people to maintain the habit of vegetarian all year round, it was a symbolic meaning to vegetarian for the first meal of the new year, as if they had been vegetarian for the whole year. There were many similar customs. For example, on the first day of the new year, they couldn’t sweep the floor and wash dishes. On the one hand, it was to gather wealth, so they couldn’t sweep things out. On the other hand, it was also because they couldn’t work hard on the first day, because it would indicate an entire year of hard work. However, Hu Zi’s mother’s cooking skills were very good. Furthermore, the ingredients were all Taoyuan vegetables, so even without any meat or fish, it was still very delicious. Xia ruofei slurped down three bowls of porridge with the side dishes. At this time, ye Lingyun had finished his physical training and returned. Xia ruofei called him to wash up and come over for breakfast. Then, he took his phone and left the villa for the farm outside. He still had to make a few new Year calls, mainly to professor Tian, Tian Huilan, and MA Xiong from Hong Kong. Xia ruofei called professor Tian first. After the call was connected, professor Tian’s hearty voice came through,””Happy New Year, Xiao Xia!” “Professor Tian, here’s my New Year’s greetings to you!” Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,”how’s your body recently?” “It’s all thanks to you! My body is much tougher than it was in the past!” Professor Tian said happily,”before the new year, the school organized for us old professors to go for a physical examination. All of my physical indicators are very good! Those old guys are so envious that they’re all asking me what kind of health – Maintenance method I have!” “That’s good, that’s good ...” Xia ruofei was also very happy. He continued to ask,”Oh right, Secretary Tian should be with you, right?” “Hahaha! That’s right!” Professor Tian said,”she comes to my place every year at this time to get some peace and quiet!” Xia ruofei smiled and expressed his understanding. For a high – ranking official like Tian Huilan, if she didn’t find a place to hide during the holidays, she would probably be trampled on. Not to mention, she had entered the ranks of the Deputy – Level and Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee this year, so the situation was even worse than in previous years. Moreover, it was not good to drive her out during the new year, so the best way was to make sure that no one could find her. “Professor Tian, please help me convey my New Year’s greetings to Secretary Tian!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I won’t make another call.” Only Xia ruofei had a quiet personality. If it was anyone else, they would probably wake up laughing from their dreams if they could speak to Secretary Tian of the municipal Party Committee. How could they let go of this opportunity so easily? “Alright, alright, alright! She’s right beside me, I’ve received your blessing!” Professor Tian laughed and said,”Xiao Xia, if you’re free, come over and play!” “Alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. The two of them chatted for a while before hanging up. Xia ruofei was about to call MA Xiong when his phone rang. Xia ruofei saw that it was a Hong Kong number and couldn’t help but laugh. “Hello!” Xia ruofei answered the call. “Happy New Year, Xia Sheng!” MA Xiong’s voice was heard from the other end of the phone. “Thank you! Old Mr. MA, I also wish you and your family a Happy New Year!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Oh right, how’s Huanhuan’s condition now?” “Huanhuan is recovering very well!” “Huanhuan’s score on the ‘autistic behavior scale’ is now normal. The professional said that Huanhuan has already taken off her ‘cap’!” MA Xiong said excitedly. “Taking off a hat” was a term used in the industry. It referred to the recovery of an autistic patient. With the recognition of a professional organization, it further proved that Huanhuan had completely recovered. “That’s great!” Xia ruofei said happily. “Xia Sheng, I have you to thank for this!” MA Xiong sighed and continued,”Huanhuan missed you so much! She always talks about uncle Xia ...” “Then please tell Huanhuan that I miss her too!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I will come to Hong Kong to see her when I have time!” MA Xiong laughed.”There’s no need to wait. We’ll be going back to the mainland in two days. You’ll see Huanhuan soon!” “Oh, really? That’s great ... I’ll think about what kind of New Year’s gift I should get her. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “The gift is fine. Huanhuan will be very happy as long as she sees you!” MA Xiong said with a smile,”by the way, xiasheng, I have another purpose for going to the mainland this time. I’m going to shencheng city to attend a truffle tasting auction. I wonder if you’re interested in joining me?” When Xia ruofei heard MA Xiong mention the truffle auction, his heart skipped a beat ...
