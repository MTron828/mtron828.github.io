Chapter 222: Knocking on the mountain to scare the Tiger (1)

Everyone’s attention was on eccentric song, so they all saw the slight tremble. Everyone stood up in unison and surrounded the bed. On the other hand, Xia ruofei was slower by half a beat because he did not pay attention to elder song’s condition all the time. Xia ruofei knew that half an hour was enough for elder song’s body to absorb the petals of the strange flower in the soup. With the dose of medicine yesterday, elder song had absorbed almost one – fifth of the petals. He would wake up at this time. When Xia ruofei got up, elder song’s bed was already surrounded by people. Song Zhengping, song zhenglin, Song Zhiping, song Zhilan and her sister, manager Lu, Tian Huilan, and song Rui. There was no space for Xia ruofei in front of the bed. “Uh ...” Xia ruofei said awkwardly. Manager Lu then realized that the doctors were being blocked outside. He awkwardly moved aside and said,””Doctor Xia, can you please take a look? is the chief about to wake up?” Xia ruofei nodded and went over to take elder song’s pulse. In fact, he knew with a glance at the monitor that elder song’s vital signs were almost the same as a normal person ‘s. This meant that the cancer cells in his body might still be raging, but he should be able to wake up from his coma very soon. As expected, just as Xia ruofei let go of elder song’s wrist, before he could speak, elder song’s fingers moved again. Then, his eyelids trembled slightly and he opened his eyes slowly with great difficulty. “Dad ...” Song Zhengping called out in a trembling voice. Song Zhengping’s younger siblings were also looking at their father with tears in their eyes. Elder song opened his turbid eyes and scanned his children’s faces. Then, he looked at manager Lu, Tian Huilan, song Rui, and Xia ruofei. Seeing his children, elder song’s eyes clearly showed a trace of relief. His lips under the oxygen mask moved a few times, but he did not make a sound. “Chief, you’re still very weak. Please don’t speak,” Xia ruofei said. “Dad, this is Xia ruofei, Dr. Xia,” song Zhengping said from the side. “He was specially invited by Huilan to treat you.” Your coma was very dangerous this time, and it was all thanks to doctor Xia’s miraculous hands!” Elder song’s gaze fell on Tian Huilan and Xia ruofei. He showed a trace of gratitude and even nodded slightly with difficulty. Xia ruofei also smiled and nodded at elder song. Xia ruofei continued,”Chief Judge song, leaders, the chief has woken up. You can rest assured.” What the Bureau chief needs the most now is rest. Let’s go out first!” “Yes, yes, yes, doctor Xia is right!” Song Zhengping said,”let’s all go out! Don’t disturb dad’s rest!” Song Zhengping then turned to elder song.”Dad, have a good rest. Don’t worry! Doctor Xia is very skilled, he will definitely be able to make you recover!” Eccentric song still couldn’t speak. He only nodded slightly and slowly closed his eyes. The group of people quietly left the room, leaving squad leader Lu to look after them. The bottle of petal solution from yesterday had been taken back by Xia ruofei. Elder song was no longer in danger, so naturally, he had no use for it. In a small meeting room on the second floor, Xia ruofei and song Zhengping’s family were sitting on the sofa. “Doctor Xia, thank you so much for this.” Song Zhengping said,”I’ll have to trouble you with the next step of the treatment.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re welcome, Chief Judge song. Elder song was everyone’s idol when I was in the Army. All of us are familiar with his legendary experiences. I’m very honored to be able to do something for him this time!” Then, Xia ruofei continued,”Chief Judge song, my medicine seems to be the right one. I’m going to give the Bureau chief three more doses. I’ll adjust the prescription according to the effect. If the effect is ideal, it should be able to inhibit or even kill the tumor.” “Good! You can decide on the treatment, we will fully cooperate!” Song Zhengping said excitedly. Then, he looked around at the other people in the room and said,””We’re all here today, so let’s discuss the problem of Liang Haitao’s medical team! How should we deal with this matter? everyone, please tell us!” “Chief Judge song, why don’t I leave for a while ...” Xia ruofei stood up. Song Zhengping smiled and waved his hand.”No need, no need, Dr. Xia. It’s not a state secret. There’s no need to hide.” Besides, doesn’t this matter have something to do with you? I still have something to ask for your opinion on later!” Hearing song Zhengping’s words, Xia ruofei could only sit back down. Manager Lu had told song zhenglin and his sister about the medical team as soon as they arrived the night before, so they knew what was going on. The second son, song zhenglin, thought for a moment and said,”Big brother, I don’t think we should treat this as an isolated incident. Liang Haitao is not an ordinary chief physician! What was the Liang family’s attitude on this matter? It’s very thought – provoking!” “Big brother, I think second brother’s words are very reasonable.” The youngest of the siblings, song Zhilan, said,”recently, father has been seriously ill. Some evil spirits and monsters have appeared! This time, Liang Haitao’s matter could be said to be due to a lack of professional ability and self – opinionated; To put it more seriously, he was neglecting his duty and not taking the safety of the Bureau chief seriously! We must have an attitude!” Song zhenglin and song Zhilan had the same idea. They were just using this as a pretext to make a scene. Song Zhengping muttered to himself for a while, a glint in his eyes. He had clearly made up his mind.
