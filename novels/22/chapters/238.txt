Chapter 239: Love stronger than gold (1)

Xia ruofei gently hugged Ling Qingxue’s delicate body and smiled.””Silly girl, how can I leave you? Didn’t we say that we’ll always be together?” Ling Qingxue looked up at Xia ruofei with tears in her eyes and said,””Then, when you saw me just now ... Why did you turn around and leave?” “I didn’t ...” Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry. “You must have seen me ...” Ling Qingxue interrupted Xia ruofei with red eyes.”I can feel it!” Xia ruofei shrugged.”Okay ... Actually, I just didn’t want to disturb you!” He said. “Are you not jealous?” Ling Qingxue stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes and asked. “It’s just a business meeting, what’s there to be jealous about?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re the future leader of lingji F & B and also a senior executive in the company. Isn’t it normal to go out and have a meal with a customer?” Then, Xia ruofei touched Ling Qingxue’s cute nose and asked,””Could it be that in your heart, I am such a petty person?” Ling Qingxue chuckled and then asked,””Ruofei, what if I tell you that this is not a business meeting? I’m here for a blind date ...” Ling Qingxue stared at Xia ruofei after she finished speaking. Xia ruofei was obviously stunned for a moment before he said,””Blind date? Did your dad arrange this? This Chairman Ling isn’t very kind ... I’m considering whether I should reduce the vegetable portion of Ling Ji’s food and beverage ...” “Don’t you dare!” Ling Qingxue said as she gently pinched Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. “Ruofei, are you really not angry?” Ling Qingxue asked. Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue a little tighter, then asked softly,””Qingxue, what do you think is the most important thing for two people to be together?” “Love!” Ling Qingxue said without hesitation. “You’re right. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but other than love, I think trust is also very important.” He gently caressed Ling Qingxue’s soft hair and continued,””If there’s no trust and suspicion, what’s the point of being together? Just like today’s matter, you didn’t tell me about it because of your reasons. I just need to know that we love each other, and that’s enough. Why should I be angry over such a small matter? You’re not my exclusive item, you should have your own space and freedom! Am I right?” Ling Qingxue was touched by Xia ruofei’s words. She nodded her head and buried her face in Xia ruofei’s broad chest, her heart filled with happiness. “Ruofei, thank you for trusting me.” Ling Qingxue mumbled,”I’m just here to handle the situation, so I didn’t tell you ... But don’t blame my father, he has his own difficulties.” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I know, don’t worry! He’s my future father – in – Law, I can’t wait to curry favor with him! Who would blame him ...” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Her eyes were still glistening with tears, but her smile was so sweet. Xia ruofei continued to ask,”alright, now that I’ve explained everything, do you still want to go back to the restaurant?” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””You’ve already run out, why go back?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s good. Let’s go!” Will you accompany me to do something?” “By the way, what are you doing here?” Ling Qingxue asked. “Real estate transfer!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I bought the villa on the farm. After the transfer of ownership is done today, the house will be mine!” “Oh, really? Then we have to celebrate!” Ling Qingxue said happily,”I didn’t eat much in the afternoon. When we’re done, go back to the farm and cook something good for me!” “No problem! Let’s go and do something first!” Xia ruofei said. Then, Xia ruofei wrapped his arm around Ling Qingxue’s slender waist and the two of them walked towards the real estate transaction Center not far away. And on the opposite side of the street, a pair of sinister eyes were staring at the two people who were gradually moving further and further away. This person was none other than Lin Feng. His face was as black as the bottom of a pot, and his eyes were about to spew fire. However, Lin Feng didn’t rush out with a pale face. He always believed that as the son of an official with a dream, he had to be good at using the resources in his hands to do what he wanted. Going out at this time wouldn’t be of any help. Hence, Lin Feng quietly watched as Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue disappeared from his sight. However, his clenched teeth and fists revealed his current mood. Only when he could no longer see her did Lin Feng take out his phone and make a few calls. By the time he put away his phone, his expression had already become calm as usual. He had become the gentle and modest gentleman again. However, he gritted his teeth in his heart. Ling Qingxue, just wait and see! The good show is about to start. I don’t believe you won’t come back and beg me. When the time comes, I’ll teach you a lesson in bed ... …… Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue naturally did not know about the series of arrangements that Lin Feng had made after they left. Just like that, Xia ruofei held onto Ling Qingxue’s slender waist as they walked to the real estate transaction Center. Guan Ping saw the two of them from afar, but until the two of them walked in front of him, he had a blank expression on his face. Ling Qingxue shyly broke free from Xia ruofei’s embrace. Guan Ping then came back to his senses and pointed at Xia ruofei,””Good job, Xia ruofei! You’ve quietly won the heart of our second middle school’s campus Belle! You didn’t even admit it last time! I’ve caught you in the act this time!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Nonsense! I wasn’t even together with Qingxue the last time! I’ll admit my ass!” Ling Qingxue also greeted Guan Ping with a red face. Xia ruofei had generously displayed their relationship in front of his old classmates, and it made Ling Qingxue’s heart feel as sweet as honey. Zhao Xueqing, who was at the side, also came forward and said with a smile,”Mr. Xia, your girlfriend is so beautiful!” “Thank you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister Zhao, you’re beautiful too!” Next, Xia ruofei introduced Zhao Xueqing to Ling Qingxue. After exchanging a few pleasantries, their numbers were called out and they went over to complete the final procedures. Very quickly, the new property and land certificates were out. Xia ruofei was officially the owner of the villa. On the first floor of the real estate trading center, there were branches of major banks. Xia ruofei went straight to ICBC and transferred the money to the account provided by Zhao Xueqing in one go. The transaction was considered successful. At the entrance of the real estate transaction Center. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister Zhao, it has been hard on you and Guanping these past few days. It’s almost time for dinner. How about this? I’ll treat everyone to a meal to express my gratitude.” Zhao Xueqing smiled gracefully and said,”Mr. Xia, I appreciate your kindness! There’s really something going on at the company today, so you guys can just gather. ” “I see ... Alright then!” Xia ruofei said. Then, he looked at Guanping thoughtfully and said,””Little ping, sister Zhao is leaving, why don’t you go and see her off? Why are you following us? Are you trying to be a third wheel?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but hit Xia ruofei lightly with a red face. Then, she couldn’t help but laugh. Guan Ping hesitated,”that ... I don’t have a car ...” Zhao Xueqing glanced at Guan Ping and said,”I have a car!” Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up as if he had a chance! He quickly nudged the stunned Guan Ping and said,””Little ping, what are you doing? Hurry up and go over!” Xia ruofei even winked at Guan Ping. “Oh, oh ...” Guan Ping finally regained his senses and quickly walked towards Zhao Xueqing. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue returned to the side of Jing Mi Western restaurant to get their car and drove straight back to Taoyuan farm. Melodious music was playing in the car. Xia ruofei had one hand on the steering wheel and the other holding Ling Qingxue’s fair little hand. Ling Qingxue was blushing as she sat on the passenger’s seat, her heart filled with happiness. “Ruofei, from the way Guanping is acting, is he interested in sister Zhao?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile. “My wife’s eyes are quite sharp!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you can even see through this ...” “Tsk ... Even a fool can tell that Guan Ping is so smitten with girls!” Ling Qingxue said,”sister Zhao would definitely feel it too ...” “Then why did she ask little ping to send her? it seems like there’s really a chance!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “I can tell that sister Zhao has a good impression of Guanping.” Ling Qingxue nodded. As the two of them chatted, the car quickly left the city and drove on the expressway around the city. After leaving the congested traffic, the speed of the car began to increase. At that moment, the phone in Ling Qingxue’s bag rang. She took it out and looked at the caller ID. It was her father, Ling Xiaotian, calling. She immediately pressed the answer button ...
