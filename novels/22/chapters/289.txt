Chapter 290: Chapter 286 – shock from all sides (1)

Manager Lu’s phone call was directly to the relevant leaders of the southeast province. The news that elder song went to Mount Wuyi in plain clothes and was surrounded by more than a hundred hooligans in yangdun town caused a thousand ripples. Secretary Lin of the southeast Provincial Party Committee had personally instructed the Songping and WYS municipal governments to immediately activate the emergency mechanism to deal with the situation, ensure the personal safety of the chief, and punish the rioters. At the same time, the political and law secretary personally led the team from the Provincial Party Committee to rush to Songping city with the relevant comrades from the provincial Public Security Department. Of course, the people in the province were far away, so they had to deal with the follow – up matters. What was really getting nervous was that Songping city and WYS city’s Mount Wuyi was a County – Level city that was under the jurisdiction of the prefecture – Level city, Songping. The order reached WYS city in the shortest time possible, and the only city that had the time to deal with it was the first – tier city. When du Xiaohai, a member of the Standing Committee of the Songping Municipal Party Committee and the Secretary of the WYS Municipal Party Committee, got the news, he was also shocked. As a world – famous tourist city, Mount Wuyi had many opportunities to receive leaders of various levels. However, leaders at elder song’s level were still very rare, especially when this former core Big Shot had come to Mount Wuyi without any notice. What was even more ridiculous was that he was now surrounded by more than 100 gangsters in a small town. Du Xiaohai broke out in a cold sweat in an instant. This was a real feeling of coldness from head to toe. His first thought was that his prospering official career would come to an end today. As the first person in charge, he couldn’t absolve himself from the blame for such a big incident. However, du Xiaohai was the first to calm down. He knew that his top priority was to deal with the emergency. If he delayed any more time and caused elder song to be hurt, he was afraid that it would not be as simple as ending his political life. He might even have to be put in jail. Du Xiaohai, who quickly calmed down, began to issue a series of orders. He didn’t have time to hold any meeting, nor did he have time to communicate with the leaders of the branch. He directly passed the order to the specific unit. The Public Security Bureau quickly took action, and a large number of police forces were dispatched urgently. Du Xiaohai considered the fact that there were so many hooligans surrounding elder song, and the police force of the Public Security Bureau must be severely lacking. Therefore, he immediately asked for help from the local Garrison. WYS city didn’t have any other Garrison troops. It was just a regular County – Level armed police Squadron and fire Brigade. The armed police Squadron was led by two people. Therefore, after du Xiaohai’s call, the entire Squadron immediately assembled. Everyone quickly collected their equipment. Soon, armed police soldiers boarded the trucks and rushed in the direction of yangdun town. The leaders of the southeast province and Songping city were all on their way to Wuyi Mountain, but du Xiaohai couldn’t care less about welcoming and sending them off. He followed the first batch of Public Security Bureau vehicles and rushed to yangdun town. In fact, there was another group of people who had arrived in yangdun town earlier. They were the security team led by Xu Wu and Huang Fang. Manager Lu called the leaders of the southeast province. The order was passed down layer by layer, so it would take some time. Xu Wu and the others received the call directly and immediately rushed over. Therefore, Xu Wu and Huang Fang were ahead of the armed police and public security Bureau. On the way, Xu Wu and the others were burning with anxiety, but Xia ruofei was still calm and composed in yangdun town. As for that Wu De, he had also calmed down at this time, and stood in place with a sullen face. Because under Wu De’s instructions, the underling had secretly taken out his mobile phone to call the police, and said that someone with a gun wound was likely to be on the run. The control of guns in China was extremely strict, and the police would definitely pay special attention to gun – related cases. Wu De could foresee that a large number of police officers would arrive at the scene soon. He said hatefully in his heart,”kid, aren’t you very powerful? Let’s see how you’re going to act when the police come later! The two sides were in a stalemate for more than ten minutes. The roar of an engine came from the old Street of the small town, and two black Mercedes – Benz sped over. Xu Wu and Huang Fang’s expressions changed drastically when they saw so many Men in Black surrounding elder song’s small shop. They immediately drove towards the men. The Men in Black were so scared that they dodged to the sides, leaving a passage. The Mercedes – Benz drove straight to the entrance of the electrical appliance repair shop before stopping. Xu Wu and the others quickly got out of the car. When he saw Xia ruofei holding a gun and guarding the door of the store, he was slightly relieved. When Xia ruofei saw Xu Wu and the others, he grinned and said,””You’re quite fast! Not bad, not bad, your emergency response is pretty good!” How could Xu Wu still be in the mood to joke? “Ruofei, is the chief alright?” he asked anxiously. “In the house!” Xia ruofei said casually,”supervisor Huang, take your men inside to protect the chief! Staff officer Xu and I will be enough!” “Alright!” Huang Fang hurriedly replied. He and his security guards opened the small door on the curtain Door and entered the shop. Then, Xia ruofei said to Xu Wu,””Xu Can, keep a close eye on him! Don’t let those bastards get away!” Seeing this, Xu Wu also took out his gun and glanced at the hooligans, then asked,””What’s going on? What are these people doing?” “They’re just a motley crew!” Xia ruofei looked at them contemptuously and said,”I think he’s the local tyrant here, called brother de or something. He wanted to ask old Mr. Li to be a technical consultant for their tea factory. After he was rejected, he came here every day to threaten and scare him. Today, a few more came and I taught them a lesson and chased them away. I didn’t expect them to be so bold. They directly pulled a few truckloads of people over and blocked the shop!” “F * ck! This is too lawless!” Xu Wu was also dumbfounded. “Isn’t that so?” Xia ruofei said,”it was an emergency. I shot them immediately. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to stop them!” Then, Xia ruofei laughed evilly and said,”Xu Can, when we get back, you’ll have to write the report on the use of guns!” I don’t care about these things ...” When they used guns during the mission, they had to write a report, including the time, place, reason, what equipment was used, how many bullets were fired, what the consequences were, etc. All of it had to be clearly explained, and all the shells had to be collected for inspection. Naturally, Xu Wu did not care about this. If Xia ruofei had not been so fearless, he would not have been able to bear the consequences if anything happened to elder song. In comparison, what was the point of writing a report? On the other side, when Wu De saw Xu Wu and the others rushing over, his expression became even more uncertain. The other side’s support was definitely extremely disadvantageous for their side, especially when Xu Wu also took out his pistol. Wu De’s heart sank. Moreover, although Xia ruofei was a little far away from them and he could not hear the conversation between Xia ruofei and Xu Wu very clearly, he could vaguely hear the words “chief” and so on. This made Wu De start to feel a little suspicious. Wu De, who had originally been greatly relieved after reporting to the police, was now a little uneasy. He began to think of escaping. Wu De slowly moved back without a trace, but Xia ruofei noticed him immediately. Wu Decai had only taken three or four steps back when Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and fired a shot without thinking. Pa! The crisp sound of a gunshot rang out. The bullet accurately passed through the gap between several big Men in Black and then pierced through Wu De’s calf. Wu De let out a blood – curdling screech and fell forward to the ground. “Whoever dares to take one more step will end up like your awesome brother de.” Xia ruofei said emotionlessly,”and ... I’m not a good marksman. I can’t guarantee where I’ll hit. I might accidentally hit the heart or the head. Don’t blame me for not warning you!” “We wouldn’t dare, we wouldn’t dare ... We definitely won’t move ...” “Big brother, please spare me!” …… When the little punks saw that brother de had been shot to death, they did not dare to resist or escape. One by one, they began to beg for mercy. Xia ruofei’s expression was cold as he scanned these people over and over again with his gun. They were also as silent as cicadas in winter, not even daring to breathe loudly. More than a kilometer away from yangdun town, a convoy of public security and armed police dispatched by the city was also moving at lightning speed. When the gunshot was heard, du Xiaohai, the Secretary of the municipal government in car No. 1, couldn’t help but change his expression.”Not good! They’ve already fired!”
