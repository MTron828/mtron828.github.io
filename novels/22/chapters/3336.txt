Translator: 5496903Xia ruofei seemed to be prepared. When Shen tianfang’s flying sword was in front of him, his body moved half an inch sideways and dodged the sword. At the same time, his feet seemed to be installed with Springs. His body was pulled up from the ground and he retreated five meters away.

After Shen tianfang’s attack missed, he did not rush to chase after Xia ruofei. Instead, he had a playful look on his face. He smiled and said,””You’re quite vigilant! It was no wonder that he could rise to fame in the cultivation world in such a short time. Xia ruofei, I’m getting more and more interested in you!”

Obviously, Shen tianfang, who was close to the advanced stage of the Golden elixir realm, had already regarded Xia ruofei as a meal. If this sneak attack was successful, it would save him a lot of trouble. However, since it did not succeed, he did not care much. Anyway, in his opinion, the difference in strength between the two of them was huge. It would just take a little more effort to get rid of Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei looked at Shen tianfang and asked calmly,””Why?”

Shen tianfang shrugged and asked,””What do you mean why?”

“We’re companions, and we’ve come to this secret realm together. Why did you attack me?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

Shen tianfang laughed exaggeratedly. He pointed at Xia ruofei and said,””I didn’t expect you to ask such a naive question! From this point of view, you really are a rookie in the cultivation world! What else do you think? People die for wealth, birds die for food. It’s said that you’re the direct disciple of a nascent soul old monster. On earth, everyone was afraid to attack you and didn’t dare to touch you easily. But what was this place now? There’s only the two of us in this trial space. Even if I kill you, who would know?”

“Just this?” Xia ruofei asked in surprise.

Shen tianfang said,”Xia ruofei, don’t you know?” Everyone’s test in the Tower of Trials is completed in a separate small space. If you can’t leave the secret realm by then, it must be that you died in there because you were not strong enough. Who would suspect me? Who in the world of cultivation doesn’t know that you’re rich and imposing? Any cultivation technique or recipe could be exchanged for a large number of spiritual stones! This was only the part that was exposed. What about the other parts that no one knew? I think if it wasn’t for the name of the Yuanying stage old Monster Master behind you, you would have been killed by those jiedan stage Masters in minutes! However, I’m still the lucky one! You actually courted death by coming up with some hidden reward and teleporting yourself to the same small space as me! It would be inappropriate if I didn’t accept this gift that was delivered to my door! So, I’ve decided to kindly accept it!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Shen tianfang, you’re so direct. You’re much better than those hypocrites!”

“Hahaha!” Shen tianfang laughed proudly. Do you have any last wishes? As long as it doesn’t expose the fact that I killed you, I can consider helping you achieve it! But in exchange, I hope you can be quick and tell me the secret of your rapid increase in cultivation and your cultivation resources. Don’t hide it, since you can’t bring it underground anyway! It’s better to be quick and fulfill my wish! When I break through to the late – Stage of the Aurous core stage in the future, I’ll definitely burn more paper money for you!”

Xia ruofei’s mouth twitched and he said,”Shen tianfang, it seems like you’ve got me ...”He said.

“Cut the crap. There’s no point in stalling for time!” Shen tianfang’s expression turned cold.”It’s impossible for anyone to come out and save you in this small trial space. Even your legendary master, whether he’s at the nascent Soul Stage or the immortal soul Stage, or even an old monster who’s about to ascend, can’t do anything!” Besides, you can’t leave this small space before you finish the trial mission. So, you can’t escape! Just accept your fate!”

Shen tianfang then grabbed his flying sword with his spiritual power and said coldly,””Since you don’t have any last words, I’ll send you on your way! All the treasures you have must be in your storage treasure! After you die, this storage treasure will become ownerless. At that time, I’ll help you make good use of these cultivation resources!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Shen tianfang waved his spiritual power, and the flying sword whizzed toward Xia ruofei again at a speed that was even faster than the sneak attack.

There was only a distance of five to six meters between the two of them. In the blink of an eye, the flying sword had already arrived in front of Xia ruofei’s face!

With a thought, Xia ruofei summoned the flying sword. He stepped on the flying sword and activated the sword technique. Then, he turned into a shadow and disappeared.

Shen tianfang was stunned when he saw this.

Xia ruofei didn’t fly too far away. He stood on the qushuang flying sword that was about a foot off the ground. He floated in the air and looked at Shen tianfang calmly.

Shen tianfang pointed at Xia ruofei and was dumbfounded. After a long while, he muttered,””Sword Kinesis flight! You can actually ride a flying sword in this small space! You ... How did you do that?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When Xia ruofei first entered this place, he could not ride a flying sword as the rules of this world were very different from the outside world. Even now, he could only use his spiritual energy to wrap the blue travel immortal sword and attack like Shen tianfang, using the flying sword as an ordinary weapon.
