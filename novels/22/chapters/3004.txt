3005 Magical wild tea (2)

“Haha!” Mu Sheng laughed and said,”sect leader Luo, can you drink wild tea now?”

“I’m sorry,” Qingfeng Luo said, feeling a little guilty.”I was too careful.”

Chen Xuan smiled gently and said,”It’s human nature. Sect leader Luo’s concern for brother Xia is from the bottom of his heart.”

Xia ruofei looked at Luo Qingfeng in confusion and asked,””What’s going on?”

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”sect leader Luo just saw you meditating. He was worried that you would be in danger. So, he has been protecting you from the side!”

When Xia ruofei heard this, and combined it with what Mu Sheng had said about Luo Qingfeng drinking wild tea, he immediately understood. Luo Qingfeng was naturally loyal to him, so it was completely normal for him to be worried after seeing him enter a meditative state.

However, this made Luo Qingfeng a little embarrassed.

At this moment, Chen Xuan poured tea for Xia ruofei and Mu Sheng. He smiled and said,””Sect leader mu, brother Xia, another cup!”

Chen Xuan had also helped Luo Qingfeng out of his predicament. He had always been so generous with people and things, making people feel as if they were bathing in a spring breeze.

“Thank you!” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Senior brother Luo, you should have some tea too ...”

Luo Qingfeng also wanted to try this magical wild tea, but Mu Sheng’s half – joking words made him embarrassed to drink it.

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan had helped Luo Qingfeng out of his predicament.

“Alright ...” Qingfeng Luo quickly replied.

After drinking the wild tea, Luo Qingfeng, like Xia ruofei, immediately entered a state of cultivation.

When Xia ruofei drank the second cup, although the taste was still very special and the tea fragrance was very strong, it no longer had the effect of promoting cultivation.

Of course, just from the point of view of tea, wild tea could definitely be called the best tea.

Xia ruofei secretly made a comparison. The taste of this wild tea was even better than the Da Hong Pao that he had grown in the medium.

Mu Sheng introduced with a smile,””Little brother Xia, if you drink wild tea often, it can also improve your cultivation, but the effect is not as good as the first time.”

“It’s already very lucky to be able to taste such precious tea leaves once. ” Xia ruofei chuckled.”How can I expect to drink it every day?”

“As long as brother Xia comes to the heavenly sect as a guest, I’ll definitely welcome you with open arms. I’ll even bring out wild tea for you!” Chen Xuan replied with a smile. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Hahaha! If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll definitely visit brother Chen!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re more than welcome!”Chen Xuan nodded.

After that, Chen Xuan took out the box of tea leaves and split out a small portion of it.

This tea box was not big to begin with, and the wild tea inside was not full yet, so this small half of the tea could only be brewed two or three times at most.

Chen Xuan split the tea leaves into two and wrapped them up. He handed them to Xia ruofei and Mu Sheng and said,””This is a small token of appreciation from this Chen, don’t think I’m stingy! The production of wild tea is indeed very small, and the production process is very complicated. I dare to make the decision to give away only this much. If I don’t leave some on the Clearwater flying boat, my father will probably blame me. ”

Mu Sheng took the Flat Tea Bag and said with a smile,””Your son is indeed more generous than your father. I’ve asked your father several times, but he didn’t even give me a single tea leaf ...”

Chen Xuan couldn’t help but smile bitterly. His father was good at everything, but he was a little stingy and kept all the good things to himself. This feature was often joked about in private in the heavenly sect, not to mention Mu Sheng, who had a good relationship with Chen Nanfeng. Mu Sheng had already teased Chen Nanfeng several times today.

As the son, Chen Xuan naturally couldn’t say anything, much less agree with him.

Xia ruofei happily took the tea bag and said,””Then thank you, brother Chen! This is a generous gift!”

A cup of tea could allow a Qi refining cultivator to break through a level. This effect was much better than the Qi gathering pill that Xia ruofei made.

Of course, there was no comparison. For Xia ruofei, he could get as many gathering Qi pills as he wanted. On the other hand, the production of wild tea was limited, and the annual output was fixed.

“It’s just a small token of my appreciation, brother Xia. You don’t have to be so polite,”Chen Xuan said with a smile. By the way, if it’s for a Qi layer cultivator to drink for the first time, it’s best to use all the tea leaves in one go, and no more than five cups, otherwise the effect might be reduced. ”

“I understand. Thank you for your reminder, brother Chen!” Xia ruofei said.

Such a good thing should, of course, be given to his own people.

There were many cultivators around Xia ruofei.

If he could increase the cultivation of five people by one level, Xia ruofei would naturally choose Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, Li Yifu, and his disciple, Tang Haoran.

He would leave the last spot for song Qiming.

Of course, it would be best to gather everyone together and let Xia ruofei make five cups of tea for everyone to drink.

Xia ruofei kept the bag of tea leaves into the spirit map space and carefully placed it in the stone chamber of the mountain sea realm cave, together with the two storage rings.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He couldn’t help but say,””Brother Chen, I have a presumptuous request ...”

“Brother Xia, just say it!” Chen Xuan smiled.

“Your sect’s wild tea tree, do you normally trim it or something?” Xia ruofei asked,”if it’s possible, I’d like to ask brother Chen for a few wild tea tree branches ...”

This was clearly not Chen Xuan’s first time receiving such a request. He replied without hesitation,””No problem! Every year, the wild tea trees were pruned regularly, usually twice a year. However, if brother Xia goes to the heavenly sect as a guest, you don’t have to wait for the trimming period. It’s just one or two branches, and they won’t cause any harm to the tea trees. I’ll just go to the wild tea trees and cut them. ”

Xia ruofei was overjoyed and quickly said,””Then I’ll thank brother Chen in advance!”

If it wasn’t necessary, Xia ruofei didn’t plan to visit the first heaven society. After all, Chen Nanfeng was a late – Stage golden core expert. If Xia ruofei were to face Chen Nanfeng, it could be said that he had no chance of winning. Even the possibility of escape was very low. The only way was to use the spirit map space to hide.

The first heaven society had no ill intentions towards Xia ruofei, and the possibility of Xia ruofei falling out with them or even fighting Chen Nanfeng was very low.

However, Xia ruofei did not like the feeling of things being out of his control.

However, if it was for the wild tea leaves, Xia ruofei felt that it was necessary to go to the first heaven society. It was not a big risk anyway, and if it really didn’t work out, he still had the spirit map space, which was his biggest reliance.

Chen Xuan waved his hand and smiled,”you’re welcome. However, brother Xia should be mentally prepared ... Our sect has also tried to use the branches of wild tea trees to expand the scale of planting. Some of my father’s friends have also asked for the branches of wild tea trees to try planting them, but so far, whether it’s US or my father’s friends, all of them have failed without exception. ”

Chen Xuan took a sip of his wild tea before continuing,””Perhaps the wild tea trees have extremely harsh requirements for their growth environment, or perhaps the place where the wild tea trees grow on Tianyi peak just happens to meet some special conditions. In short, so far, there is only one wild tea tree. So, if brother Xia wants to try planting it, that’s not a problem, but don’t have too much hope, or you’ll be very disappointed. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thanks for the reminder. Don’t worry!” I’m just trying to plant it for fun. It’s fine even if I don’t succeed. ”

“It’s good to have such an attitude. ” Chen Xuan smiled and said,”brother Xia, you can visit the first heaven society at any time. When the time comes, I will naturally offer you the branches of the wild tea tree!”

“Many thanks! Many thanks!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Everyone was chatting and drinking tea. Xia ruofei also noticed that besides him and Luo Qingfeng, even mu Jianfei did not meditate and cultivate after drinking the wild tea. It was obvious that mu Jianfei had drunk wild tea before. So, even though Mu Sheng often ridiculed Chen Nanfeng, their relationship must be very good. Otherwise, how could mu Jianfei have drunk wild tea before?

...

After a while, Qingfeng Luo stopped cultivating. He opened his eyes and a look of surprise and joy appeared on his face.
