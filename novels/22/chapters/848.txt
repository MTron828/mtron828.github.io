Chapter 849: The invisible key (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Master, the key to opening the Tri – elements jade talisman is precisely the spiritual power,” Xia Qing said respectfully.

“It can’t be?” Xia ruofei was shocked.”Did I use the wrong method?”

Xia Qing pointed at the Jade talisman in Xia ruofei’s hand and said,””Master, the key is the pattern on the Jade talisman. It’s actually a talisman. You need to use your spiritual power to draw an identical talisman in the air and then print it on it. The cultivation technique stored in the Jade talisman will naturally appear.”

“Using spiritual energy to simulate runes?” This was the first time Xia ruofei had heard of such a method of unlocking, so he was very surprised.

“Yes! The rune simulated by spiritual energy is like a key. ” Xia Qing said with absolute certainty,”master, you must have tried it just now. There is no effect when you pour your spiritual power into the pattern. You must simulate the exact same rune out of thin air and then print it on it. As long as there is a slight deviation, it will have no effect.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but take a deep breath and said,””This is too difficult ...”

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, when your spiritual power has been condensed to a certain extent, it can be almost tangible. It is nothing more than repeated attempts. Practice makes perfect. Since you have the strength to take out the ‘man’ character, you will definitely be able to open it successfully!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it seems like we can only try a few more times ...”

Xia Qing continued,”if master can successfully simulate this talisman, not only will you be able to obtain the first three levels of the” great Dao Arts,”but this talisman itself will also have a very wonderful use.” After the human rune was activated, it could instantly draw on the surrounding spiritual Qi to form a protective shield on the body. The defensive power was very strong. Of course, this requires master to be extremely familiar with runes and be able to simulate them in an instant. Otherwise, it won’t be of much use in actual combat. ”

Xia ruofei agreed,”yeah!” You have to take things one step at a time. I’ll think of a way to simulate the runes first!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I believe that with master’s aptitude, you should be able to do it very soon,” said Xia Qing with a smile. That’s right, after master practices the “great Dao Arts,” he should be able to engrave this rune on a jade pendant or similar carrier. This way, you can give this defensive rune to the person close to you. If she is attacked or encounters any accident, the rune will be activated, which is equivalent to having an additional layer of protection!”

Xia ruofei was even more motivated after hearing that.

To him, a defensive rune wasn’t very attractive. After all, with his current combat strength, there shouldn’t be many people who could threaten his safety.

However, if he could carve it on a Jade carrier and give it to someone else, it would be much more useful to Xia ruofei.

People had their ups and downs, and no one could guarantee that they would not encounter any accidents. Even if they were walking on the road, they could be hit by drunk and unscrupulous drivers.

If he could give Ling Qingxue, Hu Zi’s mother, Qiao’ er, and the others he cared about a piece of Jade with defensive runes engraved on it, his safety would be even more guaranteed.

Therefore, after listening to Xia Qing’s words, Xia ruofei had made up his mind to practice well and grasp this rune firmly.

“Master,” Xia Qing continued,”the Tri – elements jade talisman’s benefits don’t stop here. The talismans on each piece of jade talisman have their own magical effects. And if you can gather all three pieces of jade talismans, there will be a surprise!”

“Oh, really? What surprise?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

Xia Qing revealed a mysterious smile and said,””I’m sorry, master. I can only disclose this part of the information to you after you have obtained all three Jade talismans.”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shrugged his shoulders. It’s the damn authority again ...

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei said,”is there anything else you haven’t told me about the tripartite jade talisman?” If you don ‘t, you can go back to your work! I’m going to start learning that rune!”

“Alright, master!” Xia Qing immediately said,”I’ll take my leave now!”

After Xia Qing left, Xia ruofei took the human – shaped rune and looked at it carefully.

According to what Xia Qing had said, the pattern on the side of the Jade talisman with the character ‘Ren’ engraved on it was the talisman that he needed to completely simulate with his spiritual power.

He first spent about half an hour to memorize the shape of the Rune’s veined pattern.

The spirit nourishment soup and body tempering soup had a comprehensive effect on Xia ruofei’s body and mind. Now, Xia ruofei’s memory was quite amazing. It was not an exaggeration to say that he had a photographic memory. Under such circumstances, he still spent half an hour to firmly memorize the runes. It was clear how complicated the rune patterns were.

After Xia ruofei memorized the lines, he tried to concentrate his spiritual energy.

The first was naturally the release of his spiritual power.

It was not difficult for Xia ruofei as he used it almost every day.

Then, it was the process of condensation.

Xia ruofei was extremely focused. He controlled the spiritual power that had left his body to a very small area in front of him, and then continued to output the spiritual power.

In this way, the spiritual power that was confined in a small area naturally became more and more condensed and dense.

Finally, Xia ruofei continued to compress the space of his spiritual power. This was originally an invisible wave, but after compressing it to the extreme, the space in front of Xia ruofei actually had a faint golden light.
