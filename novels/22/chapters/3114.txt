“I’d be very happy to!” Chen Xuan replied,”brother Xia, please keep my identity a secret. Let me experience the life of an ordinary person as an ordinary employee! No matter what my father’s real purpose was for asking me to come to paradise Corporation to gain experience, I really enjoy this kind of life!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”As long as you don’t think it’s hard. I have a golden core stage master working for me for free. Why would I be unhappy?”

Chen Xuan finally heaved a sigh of relief. He stood up and said sincerely,””Brother Xia, thank you!”

After Chen Xuan left, the smile on Xia ruofei’s face disappeared and he became serious.

He didn’t manage to obtain much information from Chen Xuan, but he had to take it seriously.

He didn’t know what Chen Nanfeng knew, but he didn’t dare to underestimate the intelligence gathering ability of a top sect in the cultivation world.

Since the other party had already found out about the Paradise Corporation through his real appearance, his situation in the secular world was probably no longer a secret to Chen Nanfeng. This included his past experiences and even his service in the lone wolf Brigade. It was probably difficult to hide.

Therefore, Xia ruofei was considering whether there were any flaws in his carefully created identity as the “hidden disciple of a Yuanying expert”. On the other hand, it was naturally related to the rising Dragon Token. In other words, it was the token that was known as the ‘five Saints token’ in the current cultivation world.

He took out the rising Dragon Token from the stone room in the cave in the spirit map space. Since the information provided by scholar Yuntai was more accurate, he only studied it briefly and left it in the spirit map space. He didn’t take it out to the outside world from the beginning to the end.

However, this time, Chen Nanfeng had very abnormally requested Chen Xuan to come to the Paradise Corporation for training. He had even specifically asked Chen Xuan to bring along the two tokens of the first heaven society. This was something worth pondering over.

Could it be that Chen Nanfeng had already realized that he had the last token that had never appeared before? Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

No matter what was said, the feeling of not having any secrets in front of him was really uncomfortable.

Besides, Xia ruofei was worried that the first heaven society might not have found out about the situation on Paradise Island.

He carefully thought for a moment and felt that although he didn’t dare to say that Paradise Island was flawless, it wouldn’t be easy for the other party to find out.

Recently, he had been using the flying boat to enter and leave the Peach Blossom Island, which could basically prevent him from being followed.

Therefore, if there was a flaw, it was nothing more than the fact that there would be a flight record left when the public jet was used to enter and leave the island in the early stages.

However, the public jet paradise was a private jet, and the airport of Paradise Island was under his control, so the possibility of the flight record being leaked was not high.

Then there were the workers on the island. They hadn’t gone off the island for the first time, and they didn’t know much about the situation on Peach Blossom Island. Even if the first heaven society’s intelligence gathering ability was heaven – defying, the only information they got from the family members of the workers was that Xia ruofei owned a private island. This was very common among the rich in the secular world and wasn’t special. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

After Xia ruofei ran through the information, he came to the conclusion that there was a possibility of leakage on the peach source Island, but the possibility was relatively low.

Of course, even if the first heaven society knew about the situation on the peach Garden Island, Xia ruofei was not afraid.

At most, he would play face cards!

He was still very confident in the Taixu xuanqing formation. If he wanted to defend it to the death, even if Chen Nanfeng attacked with the entire Tianmen, it would be difficult to take it down in a short time.

Not to mention that the resources in the cultivation world were getting more and more scarce. Even a powerful sect like the first heaven sect would find it hard to support a full – scale war. The losses they would suffer were not something they could afford. Even if they managed to conquer the Paradise Island, the losses would not be worth it.

If Paradise Island was exposed, Xia ruofei could even have the star Seizer sect move half of their forces to Paradise Island. Then, he could openly develop his forces on Paradise Island.

With the star Seizer sect’s strength, they had a place in the cultivation world. Besides, they also had two Aurous core stage cultivators, himself and Luo Qingfeng. They were much stronger than many first – Class sects. It was not a crime for them to be in control of a precious cultivation ground.

After careful analysis, Xia ruofei felt a little more at ease.

No matter what Chen Nanfeng’s purpose was, it was not a bad idea to respond to changes by staying the same.

Of course, he wouldn’t let his guard down, especially at the Peach Blossom Island. He had to strengthen the security to prevent a sneak attack.

Hence, Xia ruofei immediately set up a soundproof barrier around himself. Then, he took out a satellite phone from his space and called Li Yifu.

Now that there was a golden core cultivator in the company, and Chen Xuan’s identity was a little sensitive as he was the young sect master of the first heaven society, Xia ruofei had to be careful. He contacted Luo Qingfeng in his office and set up a barrier.

As for using a satellite phone instead of an ordinary mobile phone, it was naturally for the sake of privacy.

After the call went through, Xia ruofei immediately told Li Yifu to be more alert from now on, especially against the sudden attack of high – Level cultivators.

Li Yifu didn’t know what had happened, but he didn’t question Xia ruofei’s orders at all. He immediately said that he would be very careful and wouldn’t let anything happen to Paradise Island.
