Chapter 487: The brain circuit of a strong woman (2)

Yet, Feng Jing’s first thought was to mass – produce the jaded skin cream and add a new product to the company ...

Seeing Xia ruofei’s dazed expression, Feng Rao asked nervously,””Chairman, is it difficult to mass produce?”

Xia ruofei came back to his senses and said,””Ah? No, no, I was a little distracted just now ... You mean mass production? Let me think ...”

Xia ruofei went through the process of brewing the jaded skin ointment in his mind.

He found that although the whole brewing process was very complicated and had high requirements for temperature and time, modern automatic production processes were very advanced. If he had a customized production line, it did not seem very difficult to achieve automatic control of each process.

Moreover, the medicinal herbs required to decoct the jaded skin ointment were very common and could be purchased in large quantities on the market.

If he were to mass produce them, he could directly purchase them from the farmers who grew these herbs. The raw materials didn’t seem to be a big problem.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,””Mass production should be possible, but ... There doesn’t seem to be a good way to keep the technology confidential for the time being. If we try to mass – produce it rashly, once the secret is leaked, others will be able to replicate it in large quantities.”

Feng Rao calmed down and said,”I see ... Then we really can’t be too hasty. We need a foolproof method to keep it a secret. Otherwise, we’d rather not do it.”

Feng Jing didn’t even mention applying for a patent.

She was also someone who had seen the world in a big company, so she knew very well what the so – called patent protection was.

Not to mention that every patent had a corresponding protection period, even if someone stole the formula and directly produced it, it would be very troublesome to go to court.

Moreover, China was essentially a society based on officials. Various powers and local protection would make such lawsuits even more difficult.

In addition, once the jaded skin cream was produced, it would inevitably set off a storm in the cosmetics market. At that time, it would be inevitable that some cosmetics Giants would be envious. These giant crocodiles would not play their cards according to common sense at all. They would probably directly use various means to steal the formula and process.

They were not afraid of a lawsuit at all.

Such companies all had a strong team of lawyers. Even if they were bound to lose a lawsuit, they could drag it out for a long time. Rich and powerful, they didn’t have to worry about this at all. For a small company like paradise Corporation, the legal costs would probably drag it down.

Therefore, the only way was to come up with a technological barrier so that the competitors had no way to copy your products.

Xia ruofei nodded.”Chief Feng, your suggestion is too sudden. I’ll go back and think about how to keep it a secret.” If this problem is solved, it’s not impossible to mass produce. ”

“Alright,” Feng Rao said. Chairman, there’s no need to be too anxious about this matter. After all, our company is still in its initial stage and there are still many other things to do. No matter when the jaded skin cream is introduced to the market, it will definitely be a phenomenal product, so we just have to take it slow and steady. ”

“I understand. Don’t worry! If there isn’t a foolproof method, I won’t try to mass – produce it. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Feng Rao nodded with a hint of excitement in her eyes.

Feng Jing’s confidence in paradise Corporation increased when she accidentally discovered that Xia ruofei had such a good cosmetic product.

Perhaps in the near future, that seemingly insignificant 1% bonus will bring me unimaginable wealth ... Feng Jing thought to herself excitedly.

After breakfast, Feng Rao brought Qin Xiaojun to the city in a Mercedes – Benz to meet up with pang Hao. They were going to continue casting their nets at the job fair.

Meanwhile, Xia ruofei had also left Taoyuan farm in his pickup truck. He was preparing to go to the Jade Market again to buy more low – Quality white jade to practice.

The core rune of the soul puppet was the center of the entire soul puppet. He had to practice it to the point where his muscles could remember it. He had to be able to engrave all the runes even if he was slightly distracted. Only then would he try to engrave on the Supreme – grade sheep – Fat white jade.

As the car left the farm, Xia ruofei’s eyebrows furrowed.

The feeling of being spied on appeared again.

It seemed that the other party had not given up! Xia ruofei’s eyes glinted.

However, after the car turned onto the provincial road and drove for a few kilometers, that feeling disappeared.

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows. He didn’t bother to think about the reason and drove straight to the Jade Market.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that the middle – aged man beside Liang Haiming had indeed arranged for a few people to keep an eye on Tao Yuan farm and monitor Xia ruofei’s movements through binoculars from afar.

However, due to the skills that Xia ruofei had displayed when she crippled Zhao he yesterday, the middle – aged man had ordered his men not to get close to the farm or follow Xia ruofei without permission. Hence, after Xia ruofei’s car drove out of a certain range, the feeling of being spied on completely disappeared.

Xia ruofei arrived at the Jade Market and quickly started to sweep up the goods.

From the end of the street to the end, Xia ruofei continued to spend money. He only bought white jade of average quality and did not even look at the other items sold by the merchants. Xia ruofei would not touch white jade of slightly better quality just because it was good!

Xia ruofei was buying it to practice. Even if he had money, he didn’t need to be so wasteful.

When Xia ruofei left the Jade Market, the bag in his hand already had more than two hundred pieces of low – Quality white jade.

All the merchants in the Jade Market were very happy today because a spendthrift buyer came and bought all the low – end goods that they couldn’t sell.

The only flaw was that the color of this sucker was not deep enough. Although he was not picky about the quality, he was very familiar with the market. The price of those white jades could only let them earn a small profit.

Xia ruofei took the White jade and drove back to the farm.

He would lock himself in his room and continue to practice like crazy. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He didn’t even eat lunch and locked himself in his room for the whole day. When he was hungry, he would eat a few mouthfuls of bread and gulp down the spiritual spring water. After a meal, he would continue to practice.

The individual runes that Xia ruofei had chosen ranged from easy to difficult. The remaining eight runes were all very difficult. After an entire day, Xia ruofei had finally mastered three of them.

The remaining five runes were the most difficult. If Xia ruofei wanted to master them all, he would need to spend a lot of time.

There were still about a hundred pieces of white jade left.

With the principle of not wasting anything, Xia ruofei picked out another hundred pieces of white jade from the used ones. These were the thicker ones.

Xia ruofei had bought a set of small cutting machines and grinders for cutting stones. He took the grinders out of the space, connected them to the power source, and started to Polish the White jade.

Soon, the shallow and deep rune marks left by the previous practice were all polished clean, and the smooth surface was restored.

Xia ruofei kept all the practice materials and put the grinder back into his storage space.

Because all the practice was done in the outside world, his bedroom was already dirty and messy, so he cleaned the bedroom thoroughly again.

After doing all this, Xia ruofei raised his hand to look at his watch and realized that it was already around 5:30 in the evening.

Thus, he hurriedly went to the bathroom to take a shower, changed into a clean set of clothes, and quickly walked downstairs. He had made an appointment with Ling Qingxue yesterday to have dinner tonight. Although the two of them were busy with their respective careers, it was still necessary for them to come out occasionally to have some alone time.

Ling Qingxue’s company ended work at Sixo’ clock. Xia ruofei’s time was a little tight, so he went downstairs and drove out of Taoyuan farm in the pickup truck, heading straight for the city.

At the same time, at the luoxing Bay Pier in Sanshan city’s luoxing District, Liang Haiming and the middle – aged man were bidding farewell to a customs officer.

Liang Haiming was smiling brightly. His “car parts” had just arrived at the port last night, and all the goods had been cleared this afternoon. This efficiency was so high that it was scary.

After the customs clearance was completed, the goods could be transported out of the dock with a legal identity. Liang Haiming’s biggest purpose for this trip had been achieved. It wouldn’t take long for him to earn more than 20 million Yuan in profit.

After the “business” came to an end, Liang Haiming’s mind naturally fell on another thing that was stuck in his throat ...
