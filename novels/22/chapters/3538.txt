“It’s not that serious!” Elder song laughed and said,”speaking of family, I was also born as a Cowherd boy. How noble am 1? 1 don’t think so! Our old comrades who went through the war didn’t say that they wanted a match of equal social status when they got married. Come to think of it, your mother was really born into a good family. If we were to talk about family status, I should be the one who wasn’t good enough for her …”

“How is that the same?” Song Zhilan couldn’t help but Mutter.

She was a little puzzled. She didn’t know what was wrong with her father today. She felt that there was something wrong with his words! Didn’t he agree to the marriage with the Li family? Why did it seem like he was going to support Xiao Rui now?

When song Zhilan thought of this, she couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei. A thought that even she herself felt was ridiculous appeared in her heart.”Could it be all because of Xia ruofei?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Grandpa song, aunty song is doing this for the good of the song family. She might be doing this out of concern for Xiao Rui.” But what 1 want to say is that if one’s strength is really strong to a certain extent, there doesn’t seem to be a need to use means like marriage and sacrifice the happiness of the younger generation to maintain the development of the family.”

“What ruofei said makes sense. 1 agree.” Elder song said with a smile.

“Ruofei, I’ve said it just now. Anyone can talk about great principles, but the reality is not that simple.” Song Zhilan said, her interest waning.

She knew very well that if elder song’s side was leaning towards song Rui, it would be futile no matter what she said.

Elder song’s prestige in the family was greater than all of his children combined. Even though elder song lived in seclusion, he could make decisions in the song family as long as he wanted to.

Of course, if elder song clearly stated that song Rui should marry into the Li family, song Rui would not be able to resist no matter how stubborn he was.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”elder song, Auntie song, I believe you can see that I’m here to persuade you. Xiao Rui and Zhuo Yiyi are truly in love. I personally support them.” But I can’t just talk big, right, Auntie song?”

Song Zhilan squeezed out a smile and said,””Ruofei, I’m not blaming you. You’re Xiao Rui’s good friend. It’s only right for you to support him.”

Elder song chuckled and said,”you’re right. Reason is reason. Nowadays, many people think that talking about great reasons is pedantic, hypocritical, or even easy to say. In fact, as long as it’s right, we have to say it with confidence. It’s nothing.”

Xia ruofei was touched. He could tell that elder song was also inclined to let song Rui marry. The reason why elder song’s attitude changed was because he saw that Xia ruofei supported song Rui.

Xia ruofei said,”you’re right, but it’s not enough to just talk about the big picture.” So … 1 still want to prove that as long as you have enough strength, you don’t need to rely on marriage to consolidate the power of the family.” “Oh? How can you prove that?” Elder song asked with interest.”And there’s no need to prove it!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let me keep you in suspense!” Grandpa song, you guys eat first, 1’11 go out and make a call…”

“Alright!” Eccentric song said with a smile.

Song Rui quickly stood up and said,””Grandpa, I need to go to the washroom too…”

“Sit down!” Elder song said calmly,”if RUO Fei went out to make a call, why did you follow? Don’t you know how to respect your privacy?”

“Oh!” Song Rui could only sit down gloomily.

Actually, he wanted to go out too. On one hand, he wanted to ask what other tricks Xia ruofei had up his sleeve. On the other hand, he felt a little guilty. He did not know what had gotten into him today that he had actually said everything that was in his heart. Now that Xia ruofei had gone out, only his grandfather and aunt were left in the house. He was starting to feel a little scared. If he stayed here, wouldn’t he have to endure the storm? Therefore, he quickly found a reason to escape.

However, he didn’t expect to be stopped by elder song before he could succeed.

Elder song didn’t say anything until he saw song Zhilan and Xia ruofei start to argue. He cleared his throat and said,””Zhilan, 1 was the one who told RUO Fei to say it. Moreover, he only said his own thoughts. You don’t need to have such a big reaction.”

“Dad!” Song Zhilan was a little anxious,”I’m doing this for this family! “It’s actually for Xiao Rui’s own good. Young people don’t have social experience, so why should they pursue love? he’ll understand in the future. It’s reasonable to pay attention to people of equal social status. When two people of different social status are together for a long time, they’ll find that they don’t fit in and might regret it for the rest of their lives …”

“It’s not that serious!” Elder song laughed and said,”speaking of family, 1 was also born as a Cowherd boy. How noble am I? I don’t think so!
