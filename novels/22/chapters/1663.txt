Chapter 1664: You’ll Control_1

You take control

Just as Brook pushed the control stick forward, he felt a bone – deep pain in his arm. His hand trembled, and the plane shook violently.

It turned out that during the explosive loss of pressure, Captain Brook’s right shoulder had hit the back of the passenger seat heavily, and his bone had been injured.

Brook’s courage was also triggered. He shouted,””Facak! Farkoff!”

He pushed the control stick forward while enduring the pain.

The plane finally shakily changed its attitude and began to lower its altitude with the nose facing down.

Captain Brook immediately realized that this was also very dangerous because the plane’s speed would become faster and faster. At this time, the windshield was broken, and the body of the plane had been damaged to a certain extent. The faster the speed, not only would the wind speed in the cockpit become higher, but it could also exceed the maximum load the plane could bear, causing the structure of the plane to collapse and disintegrate in the air.

Therefore, the experienced captain Brook immediately wanted to reduce the aircraft’s thrust, which was to slow down the throttle.

The plane’s throttle was manually operated. Between the two pilots, Captain Brook was sitting in the right co – Pilot seat with his right hand on the control stick. He subconsciously wanted to reach out his left hand to stop the throttle, but he found that his left hand didn’t listen to him at all.

It turned out that his left arm had been hit by the bouncing steel ball and had been fractured. It was just that he was in an extremely tense situation and did not feel the pain at all.

Captain Brook looked at his right arm and couldn’t help but curse again. He then shouted,””Sir, please pull the gas lever back a little! My left arm is broken!”

“Okay!” Xia ruofei immediately replied loudly.

He leaned over and pulled the gas lever back to about half the thrust. Captain Brook shouted,””It’s done! Thank you!”

Then, Brook turned around and said,””Where are the pilots? Come and take over my work ...”

After saying this, Captain Brook immediately realized that he had been spouting nonsense. Apart from the half – crippled Captain, who else was there?

This flight crew was equipped with two captains and a co – Pilot. Now, the in – charge Captain Johannson had gone to see God, and the co – Pilot, Wilkins, had directly started a 20000 – foot wireless bungee jump. His body should have fallen into the sea by now if he was lucky enough not to be sucked into the plane’s engine and be crushed to pieces.

From the looks of it, there shouldn’t be any, because the two engines of the plane were still working normally.

Then ... Captain Brook suddenly felt a deep sense of helplessness.

He knew that in his current state, it was impossible for him to fly the plane. Both of his hands were basically disabled. His right hand, which was slightly injured, could not exert much strength. Moreover, the pain was coming in waves. He was afraid that he would not be able to hold on for a while.

The plane’s autopilot system was already damaged, and they were now on the vast sea. They didn’t know where the nearest airport to land. If they wanted to fly manually the entire time, find the airport, and land successfully, the possibility of this was infinitely close to zero.

In the final stage of the plane’s landing, it was necessary to have precise control of the plane’s attitude. It might take a few seconds to make a dozen or twenty fine adjustments. A slight shake of his hand would cause the plane’s attitude to deviate greatly. With the current condition of his right hand, even if someone cooperated with him to control the accelerator, it would be impossible for him to successfully land.

A look of despair appeared in Brook’s eyes.

Naturally, Xia ruofei also quickly noticed Captain Brook’s situation. He thought for a while and said loudly,””Mr. Captain, I once served in the Chinese Air Force and have some flying knowledge. I wonder if I can help you?”

Xia ruofei lied. He was not actually serving in the Air Force. He was serving in the lone wolf Special Forces. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Due to the special nature of the task force, Xia ruofei had indeed gone through preliminary flight training. However, he had mainly been trained on transport helicopters and attack helicopters. Moreover, this kind of training was to deal with the pilot’s accidents in an environment behind the enemy’s rear. It was only an emergency measure. Therefore, the training they had received was not as systematic as that of professional pilots. It was basically a crash course. The entire training period was less than a month.

As for the fixed – Wing aircraft, whether it was a jet fighter or a propeller transport aircraft, Xia ruofei had never come into contact with them.

The flying principle and landing method of a helicopter and a fixed – Wing aircraft were completely different. In fact, Xia ruofei was a complete rookie in flying.

However, under the current circumstances, Xia ruofei could only bite the bullet. Otherwise, there was no way to save the plane. If he stood up, there might still be a glimmer of ... Hope?

As Xia ruofei thought about it, he lost confidence.

However, Xia ruofei’s words made Captain Brook’s eyes light up. He quickly said,””Good! You take a seat immediately! By the way, you can take the captain’s seat on the left! The plane isn’t on autopilot now, so I can’t let go!”

After saying that, Captain Brook turned around and said loudly,””Guli! Find a few people to move Captain Johannson......Out of here!”
