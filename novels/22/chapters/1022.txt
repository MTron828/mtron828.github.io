Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

After Xiao Qiang returned to his office, Xia ruofei smiled at Zhong Lingling and said,””Lingling, show me your office!”

“Yes, President Xia!” Zhong Lingling said with a smile.

She had a good relationship with Lin Qiao and never hid her skills. She taught Lin Qiao patiently every time. In addition, she was young and had a good attitude, so she was not as nervous in front of Xia ruofei as she was in front of Xiao Qiang.

There were about seven or eight people in the art design team, and they occupied a few booths in the northeast corner of the office. Zhong Lingling led Xia ruofei over and introduced them to Xia ruofei.

Recently, the art team’s main work was still on the overall design and beautifying of the flagship store. There were four art designers who were divided up to do this.

The flagship store of heavenly cats was upgraded from Xia ruofei’s paradise rotisserie. According to Feng Jing’s thoughts, the flagship store of paradise Corporation would be managing all of paradise corporation’s products in the future. In the short term, it would mainly be selling Ironhide Kaede and succulent seedlings.

Xia ruofei immediately saw Lin Qiao who was working hard in front of the computer.

Xia ruofei made a shushing gesture to Zhong Lingling and then stood behind Lin Qiao, watching quietly.

Lin Qiao’s computer had the PS software on. It seemed that she was making a promotional poster. She stared at the computer screen, moved the mouse quickly, and pressed the combination shortcut keys with her left hand from time to time. She seemed to be quite familiar with the use of this software.

The little girl was so engrossed in her work that she didn’t even notice the person standing behind her. From time to time, she would stop and look at the computer screen with her chin in her hand, deep in thought. Then, she would operate the computer to make fine adjustments to color matching or a certain design element.

Xia ruofei watched for a full six to seven minutes. Zhong Lingling and the art designers who were blocking the area couldn’t help but cover their mouths and laugh. Lin Qiao didn’t even notice.

It wasn’t until she finished adjusting the font of the poster that she let out a long sigh of relief. She stretched her back and moved her sore neck.

Lin Qiao reached out and touched Xia ruofei who was standing behind her.

She was also shocked. She quickly turned her chair around and said,””I’m sorry, I’m sorry ... Brother ruofei! What are you doing here?”

When Lin Qiao saw Xia ruofei, her tone immediately became quite surprised.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I’ve been standing behind you for a long time. Aren’t you a little too engrossed?”

Lin Qiao blushed and said,”How can you be like this? You didn’t even say anything when you came and just stood behind them. Don’t you know how scary it is?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”I’m not a Japanese who entered the village. What do you mean by silent?” So many people greeted me just now, even director Xiao from your marketing department came out. You were too focused and didn’t hear it. ”

“Okay!” Lin Qiao pouted and nodded.

Then, she asked curiously,”brother ruofei, what are you doing here?” Could it be that you, the big boss, have a conscience and are ready to give us poor art designers benefits?”

The girls in the art design team couldn’t help laughing and looked at Lin Qiao with envy.

Although Lin Qiao was also their colleague, they knew that Lin Qiao was different from them. Not only was she the younger sister of the company’s boss, but she was also a top student who had just been admitted to Heron Island University. Her future was limitless!

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”what are you thinking?” Of course I’m here to assign tasks!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Zhong Lingling, “There’s an exterior packaging design job that I’ll have to trouble you with. ”

“You’re welcome, President Xia. It’s our job,”Zhong Lingling quickly said.

Lin Qiao was also very interested and quickly said,”Design the packaging? Brother ruofei, let me do it!”

Xia ruofei said,”aren’t you starting school soon?” Besides ... You still have work to do!”

Lin Qiao said indifferently,”there are still a few days before school starts!” As for the work on hand ... Which art team doesn’t have a few jobs on hand! Now that there are only a few of us and many things to do, we are used to it! He had sinned in his previous life, so he had made a picture in this life! Right, master?”

Lin Qiao turned to look at Zhong Lingling with a smile.

Zhong Lingling smiled awkwardly. This was what the art girls would always say when they joked.

This was because art design work was time – consuming, and design required creativity. When a task was handed to the hands, the process from creativity, planning to specific design was very complicated. If the leader was not satisfied, he would have to redo it.

It was common for designers to redo things. Sometimes, it was normal to do seven or eight drafts in a row for a job.

However, they could joke in private. In front of Xia ruofei, the boss, and Lin Qiao, as his sister, they could say it, but ordinary employees like them could not.

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao helplessly and said,””Lingling, I’ll leave the task to you as the team leader. You can decide how to assign the tasks.”

After that, Xia ruofei listed out some requirements for the seal of the dried abalone, such as size, style, elements to be included, and the middle part to be left empty to show the real details of the dried abalone.

Zhong Lingling quickly jotted down notes in her little notebook and nodded as she wrote.

She heaved a sigh of relief. Xia ruofei’s task wasn’t too complicated. If she had done the design herself, she could have completed it in one night. Even if she were to train a newbie, she could have completed it in one or two days.

After Xia ruofei finished, Zhong Lingling immediately asked,””President Xia, when do you want this design?”

“I’ll give you three days. Can you finish it?”Xia ruofei asked after some thought.

“No problem!” Zhong Lingling replied with a smile. We’ll be able to get the first draft the day after tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs up and said,””Alright then, thank you for your hard work!”

Lin Qiao shouted from the side,”master, let me do this!” I’ll definitely do a good job!”

Zhong Lingling looked at Xia ruofei hesitantly.

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and smiled.””I’ve said it before, you decide for yourself! I’ll be leaving first, you guys work hard ...”

With that, Xia ruofei strode out of the office.

Lin Qiao held Zhong Lingling’s hand and looked at her expectantly.

In fact, Lin Qiao was already able to complete some design work on her own. However, this was a task that Xia ruofei had personally assigned to her. Zhong Lingling was worried that Lin Qiao was not very familiar with the task and that the final product would not satisfy Xia ruofei. Not only would she have to redo it, but she might also delay Xia ruofei’s time.

Zhong Lingling weighed the pros and cons for a while before she said,”How about this! This is a task personally assigned by President Xia. We have to make at least three sets of designs for President Xia to choose from! I’m one, so is Qiao’ er, and then ... You’re done with the sub – Page for Lihua, right? Then she’s one too, let’s each make a set!”

“Yes, sir!” Lin Qiao said happily. Then, she eagerly took the notebook that Zhong Lingling had just made and snapped a few photos with her phone. After that, she immediately saved and closed the poster she had just made and created a new SD file. She then skillfully pulled the reference lines and began to design the packaging.

Meanwhile, Xia ruofei strolled out of the marketing department’s office. He had wanted to take a stroll back to the villa and wait for lunch, but he bumped into Feng Jing after a few steps.

Feng Rao was stunned for a moment, then she smiled and said,””Chairman, I was just about to call you! I didn’t expect you to be in the office building! Do you have time now? I have something to ask you ...”
