Chapter 1308: I’m not going to serve you anymore (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Manager Chen, the things are here, feel free to take a look!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Chen shun didn’t stand on ceremony. He immediately called the purchasing Specialist he brought to check the Cordyceps. As for President Lin and the others, they sat there without getting up. Chen shun clearly didn’t believe their test results, so why ask for trouble?

The purchasing Specialist Chen shun brought was very experienced, and had a lot of experience in identifying aweto. This was specially assigned by Chen Weinan to his ignorant and incompetent nephew, to protect him.

When the purchasing Commissioner saw the aweto, he was as shocked as CEO Lin and the rest. In fact, he was even more shocked than CEO Lin. After all, CEO Lin had seen Xia ruofei create miracles more than once, while the purchasing Commissioner had no idea about it before.

Chen shun didn’t know anything, but he also pretended to take out some wormgrass to look at it.

The purchasing Specialist opened every bag of aweto and took samples for inspection. It took him more than half an hour to finish looking through all of them.

Then, he leaned close to Chen shun’s ear and whispered,”Manager, the quality of this batch of wormgrass is very high. The price of 750000 Yuan per kilogram from the East China region is more appropriate.”

Chen shun nodded expressionlessly, then put the Cordyceps in his hand back. He patted the non – existent dust off his hands and sat back in his seat.

“President Xia, we’ve seen the items. The quality is indeed passable.” Chen shun said casually,”Tongren Hall wants this batch of wormgrass. The purchase price is ... 500000 Yuan per kilogram! That’s a lot more expensive than the price we pay for special grade grass!”

The purchasing Commissioner’s face changed slightly when he heard this. He quickly turned to look at Chen shun, but after Chen shun gave him a dark look, he quickly lowered his head and did not dare to say another word.

President Lin’s and Dr. Huang’s expressions changed drastically. President Lin even glared at Chen shun.

Chen shun’s words were a little harsh. When chief Lin reported to the chain headquarters, he had proposed the purchase price of 750000 Yuan per kilogram. Now, he cut it to 500000 Yuan. Wasn’t this clearly saying that he, surnamed Lin, had deliberately set a high price to provide benefits to the peach blossom company? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Moreover, President Lin more or less understood Xia ruofei’s temper. With Chen shun’s insincere offer, it was very likely that Xia ruofei would leave in a Huff and this business would no longer be related to Tongren Hall.

Xia ruofei might even stop the supply of the iron – skinned fengdou.

President Lin knew that peach blossom company’s iron – Skin maples were also very popular on the internet, and the price was lower than that of Tongren Hall. Even if they didn’t cooperate with Tongren Hall, they didn’t have to worry about sales.

On the other hand, Tongren Hall had lost their partner, Xia ruofei, who could provide them with an endless supply of top quality Chinese medicinal herbs. It was a huge loss.

“Manager Chen, are you joking with me?” Xia ruofei’s face darkened.

The purchasing Commissioner had whispered to Chen shun. Although his voice was soft, it could not escape Xia ruofei’s sensitive ears.

“President Xia, I don’t quite understand ...” Chen shun said unhurriedly.

“Then I’ll make it clearer!” Xia ruofei said coldly,”President Lin’s team offered me 750000 Yuan, but manager Chen cut it by 250000 Yuan. What’s the meaning of this?”

“President Xia,” Chen shun said with a fake smile,”now it’s our Tongren Tang chain headquarters that are acquiring the company. Vice President Lin can only represent East China at most. His offer doesn’t count. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have to call for instructions, right?” Besides ... Our offer is not low. 500000 per unit is already the highest price we can offer!”

Xia ruofei stood up and said to Feng Jing,””In the future, don’t call me for such a waste of time.”

After that, Xia ruofei turned around and left the meeting room without even saying goodbye.

Chen shun was dumbfounded. He only came back to his senses after Xia ruofei’s figure disappeared from the conference room.

By then, Xia ruofei had already left the meeting room. Chen shun could only shout at Feng Jing,””President Feng, what does President Xia mean by this? Is this the attitude of cooperation?”

Feng Jing was furious. Even though she knew that Xia ruofei wasn’t angry at her, Chen shun’s actions still made her upset, especially when the 100 million Yuan that was already in place seemed to have changed again.

Hence, Feng Jing didn’t give Chen shun a good look. She said,””What other meaning could there be? We’re not doing this business anymore! Manager Chen, please leave!”

Chen shun’s face turned red and white, and the anger in his heart grew.

He had his uncle’s protection in the Tongren Tang chain headquarters, so he had always been very high – Profile. Moreover, the people in Beijing more or less had a sense of superiority, which was the kind of feeling that came from the roots of the Imperial City. This time, he came to San Shan with this sense of superiority.

Tongren Tang was a well – known Chinese medicine company. In the past, Chen shun had always had an absolute advantage in purchasing. He thought that it would be the same this time. In addition, after yesterday’s cold reception, he wanted to take advantage of it. He didn’t expect that he would fail to show off. The other party didn’t take him seriously at all.

Chen shun felt embarrassed. He said in exasperation,”President Feng! It seems that Tongren Hall is nothing in your eyes! If I remember correctly, we’re still acquiring your company’s iron Kaede in the long term! Is this how you treat your customers? If this is your attitude, I think we should just call it a day!”
