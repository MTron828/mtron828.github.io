Chapter 423: Chapter 372 – letting go of past enmity (3)

After she finished speaking, Lu You looked at Xia ruofei nervously. At this moment, she had already forgotten the awkwardness that Xia ruofei had felt when he helped her change her undergarments.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””I know.”

“Then ...” Lu You bit her lower lip and asked,”are you still angry with me?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I was very angry at first, but then I thought about it. With your temper, I don’t think you’d think about such a deep problem. It was probably an unintentional mistake! That’s why I’m not that angry. ”

“I’m sorry ...” Lu You said softly.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Forget it. It’s all in the past. I’m not such a petty person.”

Then, Xia ruofei asked again,”but after you met song Rui yesterday, did you realize that the problem was not as serious as you thought?” Actually, you should have told me earlier. That way, there wouldn’t have been so many misunderstandings!”

“You ... You already knew that song Rui ...” Lu You asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”he’s my good brother!” I already knew what he was thinking, but song Rui didn’t tell me that you were his marriage partner. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be so many misunderstandings later on!”

Lu You couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei and said angrily,””Then why didn’t you tell me you were going to leave the restaurant yesterday?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’ve already set me up. Why should I tell you so much?” Besides, song Rui is already at the door. You’ll naturally talk it out when you see him. Why would I do anything unnecessary?”

“You ...” Lu You was also speechless.

“Alright, is there anything else? I’m going to make congee. ” Xia ruofei said.

Lu You still had an angry look on her face and ignored Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei laughed, pushed the door open, and walked out of the room.

After Xia ruofei left, Lu You couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Her pretty face was red, and she didn’t look angry at all.

Xia ruofei made congee with pork and century egg for Lu You. Since ye Lingyun and Li Zhifu had gone to Mount Wuyi and there was no one else living in the villa, Xia ruofei brought the pressure cooker into the house. The two of them sat in the bedroom and ate breakfast together.

After eating, Xia ruofei went downstairs to clean up the pots and bowls. He returned to the room and said to Lu You,””Your clothes aren’t dry yet. I think you should rest here for today!”

“Alright!” Lu You said immediately.

“Oh, you should stay in your room during the day. Don’t go out!” Xia ruofei said,”there are people working downstairs during the day and there are many workers on the farm. If you go out from here, I won’t be able to explain myself.”

Lu You laughed and said,”I know!” I won’t go anywhere, I’ll even eat in my room, okay?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I’ll bring you lunch. ”

As the two of them were talking, Lu You’s phone rang. She took her handbag from the bedside table and took out her phone. She quickly made a shushing gesture to Xia ruofei and said,””It’s Yueyue. ”

“Hey, Yueyue ...” Lu You looked at Xia ruofei and said guiltily.

“Youyou, why didn’t you go back to the dormitory last night?” Jiang Yue asked with concern.

“Oh ... I ... I’m going back to my grandfather’s house.” Lu You’s face turned slightly red.

“I see! Don’t you usually go back on the weekends? Why did you suddenly run back yesterday?” Jiang Yue asked curiously.

“Something came up at home.” Lu You said,”by the way, Yueyue, help me apply for leave from professor Liu’s elective class this morning! I’m not feeling well, so I don’t want to go. ”

“Are you okay? Are you sick?”

“Oh, it’s nothing. Just a little cold.” Lu You quickly said,”Yueyue, my grandfather is calling me. I won’t talk to you anymore!” Remember to ask for leave for me!”

After she finished speaking, Lu You hurriedly hung up the phone. When she looked up, she saw Xia ruofei looking at her with a smile that was not a smile. She couldn’t help but feel embarrassed and said,””What are you looking at? It’s all because of you!”

“How is it related to me again?” Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”am I wrong to help you wash your clothes?”

“If you didn’t leave in a Huff yesterday, would I have gone to the bar to drink?” Lu You rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”it’s all your fault!”

“Fine ...” Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”miss Lu, I’m impressed by your logic!”

Lu You laughed and rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei. She didn’t say anything else.

Xia ruofei said,”I’ll go out first. If you’re bored, you can watch TV or go online. Call me if you need anything.”

“I know.”

After Xia ruofei left Lu You’s room, he went straight to the study.

Xia ruofei had a laptop in his own bedroom. He rarely used the study room, but there was still a desktop in it.

Xia ruofei turned on the desktop case and took out the hard drive that he had taken out from the zero degrees fantasy bar last night from the spirit map space. He found the backup power cable and data cable in the case and connected the hard drive to the computer. Then, he turned on the power supply of the case.

After entering the system, Xia ruofei took a quick look and realized that the system had recognized the hard drive with only one drive symbol. It seemed that the kick yesterday had not damaged the hard drive.

He immediately clicked on the hard drive, and sure enough, it contained a copy of the surveillance video.

The images from each camera were stored in different folders. Xia ruofei searched through them and quickly found the video file that was an hour around the time when Lu You sent him the WeChat message.

Xia ruofei opened the player software and started to look at the videos.

He wanted to know what had happened before he rushed to the bar yesterday, and at the same time, he wanted to make a backup of these videos.

Last night, he had made a scene at the bar and a few people had been seriously injured. This matter could be big or small. In an emergency like yesterday, it was impossible to make it watertight, so Xia ruofei had to plan ahead.

These videos were the best evidence.
