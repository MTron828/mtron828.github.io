2086 The arrival of the materials (1)

Qin Lan also knew that it was impossible to settle this matter in one go. In order to make this deal happen, she still needed to go back and forth between Xia ruofei and President Huang. However, no matter what, she was already very satisfied with this result. At least she could see the hope of a successful deal, so she was very happy.

After Qin Lan, Liao Bo, and the rest left the warehouse, Xia ruofei went to lock the door and used his spiritual power to check to make sure that no one was spying on them.

Then, he went to the Atlantean 34 small yacht. The yacht was firmly fixed to the frame by the workers. If Xia ruofei wanted to loosen the fastening device, he would have to remove at least a few dozen large screws. It was almost noon now, and he had asked Ling Qingxue out for lunch.

Hence, after a moment’s deliberation, Xia ruofei decided to put the yacht and its frame into the spirit map space. When he had time at night, he would go into the space to remove the yacht from the frame and put it out at sea.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power locked onto the yacht and its frame. With a slight thought, the ten – meter – long yacht and its frame strangely disappeared from the warehouse.

Xia ruofei placed the yacht and the bracket on a flat beach by the space sea. Although the beach was soft, Xia ruofei used the invisible force of space to push the tripod down. Soon, it was firmly held on the beach. There were no strong winds or waves in space, so there was no danger of it flipping.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to communicate with Xia Qing, who was in the space. He asked Xia Qing to look after him when he was working. Then, he warned the White realm Fox sternly and told it not to get close to the yacht. Otherwise, it would not be able to eat realm stones anymore.

After settling down the yacht, Xia ruofei did not stay in the warehouse. He opened the door a crack, dashed out, and quickly locked the door. Then, he drove to the Ling Ji F & B headquarters.

The security guards of the lingji food and beverage building were already very familiar with this flashy off – Road vehicle and let them pass. Xia ruofei parked the car in front of the building, but no one came to stop him.

Xia ruofei raised his hand to look at his watch. Just as he was about to get out of the car for a smoke, he saw Ling Qingxue’s tall figure appear at the entrance of the building.

Xia ruofei put the box of cigarettes back into his pocket, pushed open the car door, and jumped out. He smiled and went up to them.

Ling Qingxue was wearing a black suit today, and her black hair was tied up behind her head. She looked like a capable white – collared beauty.

“RUO Fei!” When Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei, a bright smile appeared on her face and she quickened her pace. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei stood at the bottom of the stairs in front of the building, smiling at his girlfriend. After she walked down the stairs, Xia ruofei naturally held her hand and smiled.””Mm! You look good!”

“That’s right!” Ling Qingxue raised her chin proudly and said,”I’m a cultivator after all. What’s the big deal with staying up for one or two nights?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”With your cultivation level, if you really meet someone from the world of cultivation, don’t tell them that I taught you. I can’t afford to lose face ...”

Ling Qingxue pinched Xia ruofei in embarrassment and said coyly,””It’s all your fault! He had left for such a long time! If you had accompanied me in my cultivation in the three mountains every day, my cultivation would have gone up a long time ago!”

Ling Qingxue naturally could not bear to hit him too hard, but Xia ruofei still cooperated and groaned in pain.””Wife, I was wrong, I was wrong! Didn’t he come back already? This time, I’ll stay a little longer and accompany you in your cultivation!”

“This is more like it!” Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei proudly and asked,”where are we going for lunch?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”let’s go to the Western restaurant around the corner from last time!” I think it tastes pretty good!”

“Sure!” Ling Qingxue said.

As long as Ling Qingxue was with Xia ruofei, she didn’t care what they ate. Besides, the environment and taste of the Western restaurant around the corner were very good.

When they drove to the Western restaurant around the corner, manager Bastian and Xia ruofei’s fan Cheng Xiaoxiao were naturally very surprised. They treated them as distinguished guests and insisted on giving Xia ruofei a free meal.

Xia ruofei tried his best to persuade Bastian and even threatened that he would never come again if the bill was free. Bastian finally gave up, but he still gave them a very high discount and even gave them two specialty dishes and a bottle of good wine.

While they were eating, Xia ruofei remembered that Feng Jing had said that she would actively update her Weibo and increase her exposure, so when Cheng Xiaoxiao served them the dishes, he took out his phone and asked Bastian to take a photo of the three of them.

Then, he took a few photos of the day’s food and red wine and posted them on Weibo with the caption: He came to the corner to check in with our CEO Ling again, and it was still the same feeling!

At the same time, Xia ruofei also tagged Ling Qingxue and Cheng Xiaoxiao’s Weibo accounts.

To Xia ruofei, this was just a simple action. It was more of a show of how much importance he attached to Feng Jing’s suggestion.

However, his casual operation had gained Cheng Xiaoxiao another wave of fans, and the number of followers on Weibo had increased by several thousand.

Even the Western restaurant around the corner had become a slightly famous online restaurant. Many people came because of its fame. Some were looking forward to a chance encounter with Xia ruofei, while others simply wanted to try the Western food that even overbearing CEOs liked.
