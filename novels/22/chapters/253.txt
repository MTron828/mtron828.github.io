The two blood – Red Dragons regained their vitality, and Ling Xiaotian’s attention was completely focused on the fish tank again. “It’s too beautiful ...” “This hair color ... It’s Red! It’s definitely the Emperor gene!” “It’s unbelievable that he has such a perfect body ...” Listening to Ling Xiaotian’s continuous muttering, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other and smiled bitterly. It seemed that they had underestimated the attraction of this top – grade blood – Red Dragon to the fish – crazy Ling Xiaotian. Xia ruofei took out the three bottles of wine he had prepared and said,””Uncle Ling, I also brought you some wine ...” “Oh, thank you, Xia.” Ling Xiaotian did not even turn his head as he said,”you give it to Qingxue! Just ask her to help me keep it ...” Seeing this, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but stomp her feet and say,””Dad! How can you treat a guest like this? It’s RUO Fei’s first time here!” Only then did Ling Xiaotian reluctantly retract his gaze and sneered,””My dear daughter, you know that your dad has this kind of hobby. Besides, Xiao Xia is one of us. He won’t mind these formalities, right?” Xia ruofei was also a little embarrassed. He handed over the glass of wine in his hand and said,””I don’t mind, I don’t mind ... Uncle Ling, it’s mainly because this wine and the nutrient solution just now were contained in the same bottle, so I wanted to give you a reminder in case you get it wrong ...” When Ling Xiaotian heard this, he quickly replied,”yes, yes, yes!” Little Xia, you’re right! I’ll go and make a mark. ” What a joke! What if he accidentally poured the wine into the fish tank as nutrient solution and made the two precious blood red Dragons drunk to death? He might not be able to find a more perfect Blood Red Dragon in his life! Thus, Ling Xiaotian put the three bottles of wine that Xia ruofei had given him aside and picked up the bottle of “nutrient solution”. He found a roll of transparent tape from the drawer under the TV cabinet and wrapped it around the porcelain bottle. “Now I won’t be confused!” He said with a smile. “Qingxue,” Ling Xiaotian continued,”sit with little Xia for a while. I’ll keep this bottle of nutrient fluid!” With that, he ran upstairs with the porcelain bottle. It seemed like he was really going to lock the “nutrient solution” in the safe. Ling Qingxue was a little embarrassed as she said,””Ruofei, my dad is like that. Please don’t mind him!” “Hey! “What’s the big deal ...” Xia ruofei laughed nonchalantly and asked,”Oh right, Qingxue, you didn’t tell him that the pair of super blood red Dragons he saw on the internet last time was in my villa, did you?” “Of course I didn ‘t!” Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”if he knew, how could he sit still? I’m afraid I’ll have to go to your farm overnight ... I might just stay at your house every day and annoy you to death ...” At this point, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Then, Ling Qingxue warned again,”ruofei, you’re not allowed to say anything either!” This pair of little red Dragons had already made him so obsessed. If he knew that such a pair of blood red Dragons were in your house, how terrible would that be? When he comes to your house every day, do you think you should give it to him or not? You promised me that we’ll raise the blood red Dragons together!” Xia ruofei chuckled,”sure, sure, sure!” I must listen to my wife on this matter!” At this moment, the sound of Ling Xiaotian’s footsteps could be heard from upstairs. He chuckled and asked,””Little Xia, Qingxue, what are you two talking about? Why do I seem to hear you guys talking about some Blood Red Dragon?” This old man’s ears are quite sharp! “Oh, we were talking about this pair of blood red Dragons!” Ling Qingxue said hurriedly, and then gave Xia ruofei a look. Xia ruofei quickly chimed in.”Yes, yes, yes. Uncle Ling, we’re talking about giving these Blood Dragons to a fish lover like you. It’s like giving a sword to a hero. They complement each other!” “Hahaha! Little Xia, you really have a way with words. ” Ling Xiaotian laughed heartily,”come, come, come! Let’s Drink Tea! Didn’t you like the Tieguanyin from yesterday? There are still a few more at home, let’s make them and drink them today! Qingxue, ask Madam Chen to prepare a few more dishes. Xiao Xia will stay for lunch!” “Alright!” Ling Qingxue happily went to find the nanny, Madam Chen, while Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei sat in front of the antique tea table. Ling Xiaotian personally began to make tea. After a while, Ling Qingxue also came over and sat next to Xia ruofei very naturally. The three of them chatted and the atmosphere was very harmonious. For Xia ruofei’s visit today, Ling Xiaotian had also pushed aside some social events, including company matters. It was clear that he valued Xia ruofei. It was inevitable that this was affected by yesterday’s incident. After all, Xia ruofei had such a strong network that even Tian Huilan had personally stood up for him. However, it was more because of Ling Xiaotian’s love for Ling Qingxue. As the saying goes,”love the house and its Crow”. Since he had acknowledged Xia ruofei as his future son – in – Law, he naturally liked him more and more. Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei both had military experience. Now that their two companies were in close cooperation, they naturally had many common topics to talk about. Ling Xiaotian’s cheerful laughter could be heard from the living room from time to time, and it was clear that he was in a good mood. Before they knew it, it was time for lunch. The three of them sat down in the dining room, and the nanny, Madam Chen, had already prepared a sumptuous lunch. “Ruofei, have some wine at noon!” Ling Xiaotian asked for Xia ruofei’s opinion.”Rest at home after you’re done. You’re not in a hurry to go back!” After chatting for an entire morning, Ling Xiaotian had changed the way he addressed Xia ruofei from “little Xia” to the more intimate “ruofei”. Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Then I’ll drink two glasses with uncle Ling.” “How can two cups be enough?” Ling Xiaotian said boldly,”US soldiers don’t drink in such a refined manner!” “Alright! Then I’ll risk my life to accompany you today!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Now this is more like it!” Ling Xiaotian nodded his head in satisfaction and said,”Qingxue, go to my wine cabinet and take that bottle ... Oh right! RUO Fei seemed to have brought wine today! Why don’t we try the wine RUO Fei brought today?” “Good, good! I’ll go get it!” Ling Qingxue said immediately. Ling Qingxue quickly brought the three bottles of wine over. Ling Xiaotian held one of the bottles in his hand and examined it for a long time before saying,””RUO Fei, why have I never seen this wine before? This bottle doesn’t look like it’s used to store wine ... Could it be that you brewed this wine yourself?” “Uncle Ling, try it first!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”ruofei, you’re still keeping me in suspense!” But I’m also an expert in alcohol testing! I’ll know the origin of this wine once I taste it!” “Dad, be careful not to blow your own trumpet!” Ling Qingxue chuckled. Ling Xiaotian sighed,”AI!” Girls are really biased towards outsiders ... They’re already working together with ruofei to target me, their father ...” “I didn’t ...” Ling Qingxue said coyly, her face red. Ling Xiaotian laughed and continued,””Let me taste what kind of good wine RUO Fei brought!” With that, Ling Xiaotian opened the bottle, and a rich aroma of wine immediately filled the dining room. ~
