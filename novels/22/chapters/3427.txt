Chapter 3428: Danger in the garden (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei controlled the qushuang flying sword and directly cut off the head of the high – Level Star Beast. Only then did he stop the operation of the array. He immediately put the materials into the spirit map space and moved Ling Qingxue out of the spirit map space.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but be frightened when she saw the high level Star Beast curled up in a ball.

When they encountered the high – Level astral beast, Xia ruofei didn’t even have time to tell Ling Qingxue before he kept her in the “protective magical equipment”. She also didn’t have time to remind Xia ruofei to be careful. So, for the past ten to twenty minutes, every second felt like a year to Ling Qingxue.

She had never seen a high – Level astral beast on the second level of the Tower of Trials. However, the characteristics of high – Level astral beasts were very obvious. One look and she could tell that they were much stronger than intermediate – Level astral beasts. Naturally, she was very worried about Xia ruofei.

Fortunately, it didn’t take too long for Xia ruofei to finish the battle.

Ling Qingxue pointed in surprise at the lump of black charcoal that could no longer be identified and said,””RUO Fei, is this the Star Beast from earlier? How did you get burned like this?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”This guy is a little hard to deal with. I used a formation!”

“Oh …” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but stick out her tongue. She laughed and said,”that’s too brutal…”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Actually, we can slowly grind it to death. However, 1 don’t want to complicate things. I’m also afraid that you’ll be worried if we take too long. So, I’ve decided to end it quickly!”

“Isn’t it? I was worried sick!” Ling Qingxue said.

She then asked,”isn’t this astral beast a monster from the second level of the Tower of Trials?” How could he appear on the trial Pagoda’s 7th level?”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,”I’m not sure … But I guess the seventh level is a test of overall strength. All kinds of monsters can appear in the cloud Palace. We must be careful.”

“Mm! No wonder the reward is given according to the evaluation of the completion rate of the mission.” Ling Qingxue nodded. Then, her expression darkened.”! can’t even help you. I might even be a burden at critical moments

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”look!” You’re doing it again … I told you, don’t undervalue yourself. You being by my side is my greatest support! And many times, your role is irreplaceable! Fighting and killing isn’t something you’re good at, so isn’t it just right for me to handle it? In addition, it’s also because you were with me that you encountered such a powerful monster. If you were alone, the test would definitely be arranged according to your strength, so Speaking of which, it’s my fault!”

Ling Qingxue laughed in embarrassment and said,””What are you saying? I can’t make it to this level by myself, okay?”

“So don’t overthink it! In any case, we’re making a profit now, and I have a magic treasure that can protect you. If you’re in danger, you can hide, and I won’t have any worries, right?” Xia ruofei smiled and consoled her.”It’ll be fine. Don’t worry!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xia ruofei continued,”let’s go!” Let’s continue our exploration!”

“En!”

The two continued to walk inside. After passing through the hall, they came to the square between the third and second entrances. This square was slightly smaller than the previous square. To be precise, this was not a square, but more like a garden. There were many pavilions and pagodas, as well as a murmuring sound. The winding path strung these sceneries together. When walking on the path, one could see a different scenery every time they changed direction.

This was the typical style of Jiangnan gardens, where one could change the scenery with one step.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but be attracted by the scenery in front of her. She praised,””The level of design of this garden is very high!”

“That’s for sure! Cultivators can sense the great Dao of nature all year round, and the buildings and gardens designed by them are also devoid of smoke and fire, making them closer to the Dao of nature.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but don’t get lost in the beautiful scenery! Danger is often brewing in such a scene!”

“I know…” Ling Qingxue smiled, a little embarrassed.”! was just thinking that it would be great if we had a house like this!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”you want to live in the palace?” Don’t tell me you want to be the Empress?”

“There’s no point in living in a Palace. It’s so high up and so empty…” Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and said,”but this kind of garden is very comfortable. Look, there’s even a bamboo house over there. In summer, you can sit in the bamboo house to listen to music, make tea, enjoy the beautiful scenery of the garden, and enjoy the gentle breeze…”

“There are also mosquito bites. Maybe there are even mice!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

Ling Qingxue’s face froze. She hit Xia ruofei and said,””Why arc you such a killjoy!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”You’re thinking about poetry and the distance. I just want to remind you that life is more about the present.” Think about it, there are so many plants here, and the stream is so humid, how can there be no snakes, insects, rats, and ants? Especially in the summer, when the wind blows through the bamboo building, there will be a lot of mosquitoes. ”

When Ling Qingxue thought of the scene that Xia ruofei described, she could not help but shiver. However, she immediately realized that she had been played by Xia ruofei. She could not help but glare at Xia ruofei in embarrassment and said,””Nonsense! This is a Palace created by a powerful senior. How can there be snakes, insects, rats, and ants?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”how can there not be?” Didn’t we encounter a group of ants the moment we entered the palace? And it’s such a Big Ant…”

Xia ruofei said as he gestured the size of the ants with his hands.

“That’s not the same …”Ling Qingxue said.

“Shh!” Xia ruofei suddenly made a shushing gesture.

Ling Qingxue immediately shut her mouth and looked around nervously. Then, she looked at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei listened for a while, then released his spiritual power. After a while, he asked,””Qingxue, did you hear footsteps just now?”

Ling Qingxue’s voice trembled as she said,””No, I didn’t! What’s the situation?” “Oh!” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said,”I didn’t hear it either!”

After he finished speaking, he walked forward in a relaxed manner.

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment before she realized that she had been tricked by Xia ruofei again. She could not help but shout,””Xia ruofei! Do you not want to live anymore? You actually dare to tease this old lady!”

After she finished speaking, she quickly caught up to him and grabbed Xia ruofei’s clothes, as if she was going to hit him.

Xia ruofei struggled for a while, and his expression changed.””Qingxue, listen

“Again!” Ling Qingxue said in embarrassment,”do you really think I’m stupid? I’ve been tricked again and again!”

“I’m not lying to you this time!” Xia ruofei made a shushing gesture and pointed to the right.

There was a field of low green plants. At first glance, there was nothing wrong with it, but now it was shaking slightly, and there was no wind at all.

Ling Qingxue also realized that something was not right. So it was not a joke this time. She looked at the small trees and became a little nervous. At the same time, she let go of Xia ruofei’s clothes.

“RUO Fei, what’s the situation?” Ling Qingxue asked softly.

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”Don’t be afraid. We’ll deal with all changes by staying the same.”

After he finished speaking, he released his spiritual power and extended it towards the small forest.

After he scanned the small forest with his spiritual power, the feedback made Xia ruofei’s heart tighten. He only had time to call out softly,””Qingxue, relax your mind and don’t resist!”

Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei had a good rapport. After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he immediately put Ling Qingxue into the spirit map space. It happened in the blink of an eye. Ling Qingxue had completely given up on resisting. There was no hesitation throughout the entire process.

In that split second, Xia ruofei could clearly feel a strong wave of spiritual energy coming from the direction of the small forest. Then, he felt the world changing and the environment around him had changed dramatically..
