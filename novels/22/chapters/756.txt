Chapter 757: Just right (1)

Following that, Xia ruofei’s movements were very fast. In the blink of an eye, he had inserted silver needles into seven or eight acupuncture points. It was quite a dazzling feeling.

Xia ruofei’s pulse – checking and acupuncture were not all covered up in front of Guo Zhan. He had been self – learning Chinese medicine all this time and it was not in vain. Now, he was no longer an outsider in the theory and practice of Chinese medicine.

This acupuncture naturally could not detoxify the poison, but it could effectively slow down the blood circulation and prevent the poison from spreading further.

Of course, if he wanted to completely detoxify the poison, he would naturally need the spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

Xia ruofei did not take out the silver needles on Jin Gang’s body. Instead, he stood up and took out a porcelain bottle from his bag that contained the solution of the spirit Heart Flower petals.

When Xia ruofei received Guo Zhan’s call, he had already thought of the possible situation, so he had taken the flower petal solution from the spirit map space in advance.

Furthermore, it was a petal solution with a higher concentration.

Now, it seemed that this decision was very correct. In Jin Gang’s situation, the poison was obviously very dangerous. Moreover, it had spread to the whole body along with the blood. It could be said that he was in danger. If the petals of the spirit Heart Flower were diluted too much, it was possible that it would not have a good effect.

Xia ruofei took a look at Jin Gang’s condition and realized that he had undergone a tracheotomy after the operation. He had been put on a ventilator, so it was obviously not realistic to feed him the medicine directly.

Xia ruofei’s eyes moved up and he suddenly had an idea.

After the patient was put on the ventilator, if he needed to eat, he would need to use the gastric tube and put it through the nose. Of course, the patients in ICU didn’t need to eat because most of them had lost the ability to chew. Therefore, all the nutrients and electrolytes they needed were sent into the patient’s body through an intravenous infusion.

Which meant an intravenous drip.

One of the bags was almost finished. Xia ruofei walked to the other side of the bed. There were some commonly used medical equipment on the small shelf, including disposable syringes.

......

Xia ruofei picked one up and tore open its outer packaging. Then, he inserted a syringe into the small porcelain bottle and sucked in a syringe full of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

Then, Xia ruofei turned on the flow regulator on the infusion set and temporarily cut off the flow. Without hesitation, he picked up the syringe and inserted it into the medicine adding port, injecting the spirit Heart Flower petal solution into the infusion bag.

When Guo Zhan saw this scene, he opened his mouth, but in the end, he didn’t make a sound to disturb Xia ruofei. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He had absolute trust in his comrade, so he kept quiet about Xia ruofei’s obviously violation of the operating rules of the intensive care unit.

Xia ruofei sucked a few times in a row, and the originally shriveled infusion bag became full again. He kept the porcelain bottle that was half – filled with the petal solution into the bag, then turned on the regulator and started the infusion again.

This might be more effective than taking the petal solution, because the solution was directly injected into the vein, and the stomach didn’t need to absorb it.

Of course, the most effective way was to inject it directly. After all, the infusion speed was slower.

However, Xia ruofei had never studied nursing, so he could not do this job well. It was even more impossible to find a nurse outside to do it. They could only turn a blind eye to it outside. If they injected the patient with an unknown drug without a doctor’s notice, they would lose their jobs if they were pursued!

Moreover, Xia ruofei had just checked on Jin Gang’s condition. It was stable for the time being and would not be in any danger for the next few hours.

As more and more of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution was injected into his body, his life would naturally not be in danger. This way, the recovery process would be slower and not too eye – catching.

After Xia ruofei was done, he nodded slightly to Guo Zhan and said,””Captain, don’t worry too much. This is an antidote that I specially concocted. It has a very good effect on many poisons. I just happened to have two bottles in my bag today. I made it in time.”

“You’ve worked hard, Blood Wolf,” Guo Zhan said,”regardless of whether Xiao Ling can survive this time, I’m very grateful to you!”

“Wolf King, we’re all brothers. Xiao Ling was even a soldier that I’ve personally led. Don’t you think you’re treating me like an outsider by saying this?” Xia ruofei said.

Guo Zhan reached out his hand and patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder heavily. He didn’t say anything else.

At this moment, silence was better than words.

Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan didn’t leave the ICU. They moved chairs and sat down together, paying attention to Jin Gang’s situation.

The two of them had a tacit understanding. Xia ruofei did not ask Guo Zhan about the mission, nor did he ask which of his comrades had died.

In fact, the two of them were silent most of the time. Occasionally, they would talk about the past.

Time passed by. In the ward, there was only the regular beeping sound of the monitoring Instrument. Guo Zhan raised his head and glanced at Jin Gang by chance. He could not help but rub his eyes and take a closer look.

Then he said,”Blood Wolf, come and take a look. I don’t know if it’s my illusion, but flamy’s face seems to be much better.”

Of course, this was not an illusion. When the two of them had just entered the door, Jin Gang’s face was dark gray, and the color of his skin was also very dull. What was more shocking was that although the wound had been treated to reduce inflammation, it was still greenish – Purple in color. It was obvious that he had been deeply poisoned.

But now, the dark gray color had faded a lot, and a trace of blood had begun to return to his face. The terrible purple – Green color around his wounds had also faded a lot.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Wolf King, it seems that my antidote is effective!” At the very least, Xiao Ling’s vital signs are very stable, and they’re showing signs of improvement. ”
