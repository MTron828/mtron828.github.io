Chapter 1657: Going to Australia together (2)

After returning to the big courtyard in liuhai Lane, Xia ruofei wanted to give the master bedroom to Feng Rao, but Feng Rao firmly rejected it. So, he settled for the second best and let Feng Rao live in the side room in the second courtyard.

After Wu Qiang returned to his room in the backyard to rest, Xia ruofei invited Feng Rao to his room to make tea and chat.

After taking a sip of the hot tea, Feng Rao felt that the house, which had a floor heater, was even warmer than spring.

She smiled and asked,”ruofei, what are you doing in the capital?” It must have been many days! You’re really leaving the company to me!”

Xia ruofei scratched his head and said,”sister che, I swear to God. I didn’t mean to be idle. There are a lot of things in the capital. I haven’t settled them yet!” When they heard that I was going to Australia at the last minute, my friends had some opinions!”

Then, Xia ruofei told Feng Jing about the club that he, Zhao Yongjun, and a few others were planning to set up together, as well as the inspection and land acquisition.

Of course, he did not mention the nine revolutions heaven and earth formation and the battle of wits and courage with Liu haofan.

After Feng Rao heard this, she smiled and asked,””Then what are you going to Australia for this time?”

Xia ruofei was excited when he heard that. He said,””Didn’t I buy two wineries over there? It’s the season for grapes to ripen over there, and the winery is about to start picking grapes to make wine. I have to go and take a look!”

“Alright then!” Feng Jing was a little speechless.”You seem to be very busy too ... But why do I feel like you’re slacking off?”

“Prejudice! This is definitely a prejudice!” Xia ruofei said.

Feng Jing couldn’t help but cover her mouth and laugh. Although the journey was a little tiring, drinking tea and chatting with Xia ruofei was Feng Jing’s most enjoyable leisure time.

Considering that they still had to take a long flight tomorrow morning, Feng Jing returned to her room to rest after chatting for a while.

......

The next morning, when Xia ruofei and Feng Jing were having breakfast in the courtyard and preparing to leave for the airport, at the Capital International Airport tens of kilometers away, Zhifei’s Australian Air Service crew, which was flying from the capital to chetminneginsford Smith Airport in Australia, had just finished their pre – Flight preparation meeting. They were walking out of the conference room, boarding the crew car at the door, and driving towards the terminal building not far away.

In the group, there were three pilots at the front. The first two were captains with four bars, and the third was the co – Pilot with three bars. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

On the flight route between qanduin and the achetani, it was conventional to have two pilots instead of two crew. Three pilots took turns to fly to ensure that one person could take turns during the long – distance flight.

The 32 – year – old co – Pilot was Wilkinson. He was Eurasian, his father was Portuguese, and his mother was from Wei nation. He had been living in Australia with his immigrant parents since he was a child.

Wilkinson had the distinctive features of a traditional European. His eye sockets were deeper, and he had beautiful blonde hair and blue eyes. At the same time, he had the features of an Asian, and the lines of his face were softer than that of Europeans.

Wilkins had a handsome appearance, a strong body, and a good family background. His parents had immigrated to Australia many years ago and had a large business in Australia, so naturally, many flight attendants were interested in him.

However, Wilkins was a quiet person and gave off an unapproachable feeling. In the past, a few female flight attendants who felt that they were very charming had tried to get close to Wilkins, but they had all returned in failure.

However, the stewardesses who were walking at the back of the group noticed that Wilkinson seemed to be in a good mood. There was a special glow on his face, and he even smiled, which was rare.

He even told the purser beside him,””Today’s really a good day for flying!”

The purser also smiled and nodded, “It’s indeed rare to see the blue sky and white clouds in the capital of China ...”

Those who often flew on this route had a deep understanding of the haze in Beijing.

Wilkinson laughed out loud. He felt as if a ball of lava was boiling in his heart. After a long period of preparation, the best opportunity had finally arrived for the thing that he had always wanted to do ...

......

At around 8:30 am, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing arrived at the Capital International Airport. They successfully went through the boarding pass, customs, license inspection, quarantine, and other exit procedures and entered the waiting area.

At this time, on the tarmac, an Airbus A350 aircraft was parked quietly. The carbon fiber wing tips were glistening under the rare sunlight in Beijing.

In the cockpit, the co – Pilot, Wilkinson, and the other Captain, Brook, were carrying out the pre – take – off routine inspection, while the responsible Captain, Johannson, was doing a lap inspection on the tarmac.

Wilkinson pressed down on his pocket, and then glanced at the ink mirror box next to him. There was a trace of eagerness in his eyes, as if his soul was trembling.

Time passed by.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing waited in the waiting room for nearly 40 minutes before they finally heard the announcement that they were boarding.

The two of them walked to the boarding gate with their luggage and successfully boarded the plane through the covered bridge.

The two of them were in the Airbus A350 piloted by the Wilkinson family.

The first – Class cabin was at the front of the plane and was connected to the kitchen. Further ahead was the cockpit.

Under the guidance of the A.I. Air stewardess, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing successfully found their seats. Although the 350 first – Class cabin was not as luxurious as the 380, it was still quite comfortable compared to the economy cabin. Moreover, the seats could be flattened during the long flight so that they could get better rest.

The two of them naturally ordered the two seats close to each other. After they sat down, a flight attendant brought over a tray with toiletries. The toiletries were divided into gender – specific types. The male – Type kit that Xia ruofei received was made of black leather. After opening it, he found that the items inside were all SK III. In addition, there was a razor, toothpaste, toothbrush, and other items. It was quite complete.

Then, another flight attendant came over to distribute the pajamas. The pure cotton charcoal black pajamas were wrapped in a black wire, with slippers and socks in the middle. It felt quite good to the touch.

These items were all included in the ticket payment. Of course, passengers could also choose to take them away after using them.

After the two of them put their luggage away, they sat down and chatted while waiting for the plane to take off.

In the cockpit, the in – charge Captain Johannson had already taken his seat. On his right side was the co – Pilot, Wilkinson, and the second captain, Brook, who was in the back seat. The three of them were making the final preparations before take – off.

Wilkinson tried his best to calm himself down, and even secretly took a few deep breaths.

It was rare that there was no traffic control at the capital Airport today. Everything went smoothly. After the plane door closed, it pushed out the parking lot on time.

The take – off was personally controlled by Captain Johannson. After the plane glided on the runway, it jumped into the air lightly.

After the busy air – ground communication and flight control during the initial stage of take – off, the plane finally entered a level flight posture.

In the back seat, Captain Brook unbuckled his seat belt and said goodbye to the two colleagues in front of him. Then, he left the cockpit. According to the flight schedule, he would rest in the cabin at the top of the cabin for the first four hours of the flight. Then, he would take over from Wilkins.

After resting for four hours, Wilkinson would return to the co-pilot’s seat. Captain Johannson would then rest, while Brook would take the captain’s seat.

At the end of the landing phase, Captain Johannson would return to the cockpit.

The first – Class cabin was at the forefront of the cabin. Xia ruofei and Feng Rao could see Brook coming out of the cockpit and opening a small door at the back of the cockpit. He went up the secret stairs to the lounge that was almost above the kitchen.

The long – distance flight was actually very boring. Although it was daytime, most of the passengers chose to rest in their seats.

After Xia ruofei and Feng Jing chatted for a while, they both adjusted their seats and leaned back to rest.

In the stratosphere, the plane was very stable and the cabin was very quiet.

No one knew that in this calm, a shocking Super Storm was brewing ...
