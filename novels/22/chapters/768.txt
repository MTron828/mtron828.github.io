Chapter 769: Nowhere to hide (1)

Guo Zhan and Tian Feilong also looked at the canteen with a thoughtful expression. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Guo Zhan had a flash of inspiration and called out, “There’s a lead!”

Only Tian Feilong was still frowning slightly. It was obvious that he still had no clue.

“Captain, squad leader Xia, what kind of clue is it?” he couldn’t help but ask.

Guo Zhan looked at Xia ruofei with a smile and said,””Blood Wolf, you tell us!”

Xia ruofei gently stroked Blackie’s smooth fur and asked with a smile,””Feilong, think about it. That group of people is a big target. They left with professor Liang and possibly other scientists. How did they avoid the surveillance?”

Tian Feilong looked at the cafeteria next to him and analyzed,”These people don’t know how to be invisible, so it’s impossible for them to escape the campus through the sewer. And it’s probably one of those sealed cargo trucks ...”

Xia ruofei snapped his fingers and said,”Correct! This is the school canteen, so the food consumed every day must be a lot, so ...”

“A truck transporting food!” Tian Feilong’s eyes immediately widened as he shouted. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

At this moment, Guo Zhan’s Secret phone vibrated. He picked it up and said a few words. After hanging up, he said with a smile,””Those little brats are here. Let’s go and meet them first. Then we’ll go to the school security Office to check the surveillance cameras!”

They had been in the sewer for a long time, and it was not far from the ground to the laboratory building. It was only 400 to 500 meters, so the three of them returned to professor Liang Qiming’s laboratory building very quickly.

All the members of the two teams had arrived. In addition to the deceased squad leader Luo, Jin Gang, who was hospitalized due to serious injuries, and a member who stayed in the General Hospital to take care of the patient, there were nine other team members.

Those who were brought out by Guo Zhan to carry out such an important mission were all experienced veterans. Naturally, they were very familiar with Xia ruofei.

......

When everyone saw each other, there was another round of excited hugs and small talk.

However, Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan were in a hurry to check the surveillance video, so they did not waste too much time. They did not even have time to wash off the stains on their bodies. They were led by a police officer to the school’s security Office, carrying a strange, unpleasant smell.

Officer li explained the situation to the security Director, and the director naturally cooperated unconditionally. He personally led everyone to the monitoring room and instructed the staff to pull up the surveillance records according to Guo Zhan’s request.

Yesterday’s battle had taken place at FiveO’ clock in the afternoon. Guo Zhan had directly asked to see the surveillance footage of the second canteen at that time.

Just as Xia ruofei had expected, the place where the smell had disappeared from was the blind spot of the second canteen’s surveillance cameras. None of the cameras had captured that location.

But after a while, a white van appeared in the surveillance camera. The car had driven out from the side of the open space. If the car wanted to leave the cafeteria and drive out of the campus, it was impossible to avoid all the surveillance cameras.

“Stop!” Xia ruofei called out.

The staff immediately pressed the button, and the picture froze.

Xia ruofei pointed at the cargo van on the surveillance screen and asked,””Director Luo, do you recognize this car?”

Director Luo of the University Security Department said with a wry smile,””There are so many cars going in and out of the campus every day, and we can’t possibly recognize every one of them. However, those that can enter the campus must have a pass. This car is most likely to deliver food to the cafeteria. Should I call old Xu from the logistics department to identify it?”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you!” Xia ruofei said politely.

Soon, the logistics department’s director Xu, who was also in the same building, came to the monitoring room. He looked at the LOGO on the truck and immediately said,””This is the delivery truck of the Oasis agricultural products company! The ingredients in our school’s five canteens are all outsourced to the Oasis company. They come here several times a day to deliver the ingredients!”

Xia ruofei and Guo Zhan looked at each other. Then Xia ruofei said,””Can you Zoom in on the image? Can you identify the car plate number?”

“No problem! We have a few HD cameras on the main road of the school. ” The staff member said,”this car will definitely have to go through the main road to leave the campus.”

After that, he skillfully operated the computer and pulled up the history of another surveillance camera.

Sure enough, after a while, the van appeared on the screen. Not only was the license plate number clear, but the passengers in the van could also be seen clearly.

Xia ruofei quickly noted down the car plate number and asked officer li to coordinate the police force to go to oasis to investigate the situation of the car. He then said to the staff,””Please send us a few screenshots of the person inside the car, thank you!”

After the staff took the picture, everyone looked at the surveillance for a while. The van started about 20 minutes after the gunfight and drove out of the campus.

Then, Xia ruofei asked the staff to look at the surveillance camera at the entrance of the cafeteria. They found out that the car had arrived at the second cafeteria a little after fouro’ clock. Then, it was parked on the side of the open space and left after FiveO’ clock.

The timing matched perfectly!

After watching the surveillance footage, director Luo of the security Office took Xia ruofei and the others to the reception room next door. They sat down, had tea, and chatted while waiting for the results of the police investigation.
