2002 Murderous intent on a rainy night (3)

She walked towards Toles, and Xia ruofei’s figure appeared in her mind again. Xia, farewell ... I used to think that the concept of chastity of Chinese women was ridiculous, but when the clan leader asked me to please this demon with my body, I felt a strong sense of guilt towards you! Don’t worry, my body will always belong to you alone. It’s just a pity ... I won’t be able to see you again ...

Toles had already stood up and walked toward Monica. He narrowed his eyes, which were filled with an ominous glint, and grinned at Monica.

Monica felt that his mouth of yellow teeth was as disgusting as it could get, but she still endured the discomfort and showed Toles a charming smile. She knew that if she wanted to assassinate a top fighter like Toles, she had to first make him completely let down his guard.

Monica clenched her hands tightly and followed Lorie to Toles.

Toles laughed and opened his arms at Monica. He said arrogantly,Little baby, you’re finally here! You’ll know very soon that this is the right decision!

Mr. Toles, how could I refuse your summoning Monica tried her best to smile.

Toles laughed heartily and said,let’s go! My little darling! I’ve already prepared a candlelight dinner, a candlelight dinner for the two of us!

After saying that, Toles reached out to Monica’s shoulder, wanting to pull her into the villa.

Lorie and the others looked envious. They even began to imagine the scene of this hot and beautiful woman being trampled on by Toles.

Monica’s eyes revealed a hint of determination. She still had a charming smile on her face, but the razor in her hand began to slide down gently.

Toles stretched out his hand, and the front door was wide open. Monica only needed to wave her hand, and the razor would cut Toles ‘carotid artery. The premise was that she was fast enough, accurate enough, and strong enough.

Monica gritted her teeth and said goodbye to Xia ruofei in her heart. Then, she held the razor with two fingers and raised her hand ...

At this moment, everyone felt as if a gust of wind had blown past, and then a person suddenly appeared in the villa’s courtyard.

While everyone was still in a daze, the masked person had already appeared between Toles and Monica in a strange flash.

Monica didn’t see the masked man’s actions, but she felt the weight in her hand lighten. The razor had disappeared.

Monica was in despair. She thought that the masked man had been secretly protecting Toles and had only appeared after sensing danger.

Now that her only weapon had fallen into the hands of the other party, she would not even have the chance to commit suicide in the face of such a group of wolves.

Monica couldn’t help but tremble when she thought of the tragic situation she was about to face.

However, in the next moment, Monica watched in shock as the masked man raised his hand, and the razor flew towards Toles like a bullet.

After a soft sound, the razor blade flew into the darkness with a silver light.

Toles’s eyes widened as he stared at the masked man.

A Thin Red Line appeared on his neck at first, then it quickly extended and almost wrapped around his entire neck.

At first, it only slowly oozed blood, but it soon spurted out. No matter how hard Toles tried to hold his neck, it was to no avail.
