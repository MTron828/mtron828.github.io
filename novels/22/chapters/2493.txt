On the third day, Xia ruofei received his passport and visa.

Moreover Spain a Shengen. Within the effective period of the visa, Xia ruofei could easily enter and leave more than 20 Shengen countries, including most of the European countries.

After Xia ruofei received the passport that Qin Yanan had given him, he sat in his office and pondered for a long time. Then, he took out his phone and called Liu An, the captain of the public jet who was on standby at San Shan.

“Hello, Mr. Xia!” Liu An said respectfully.

Xia ruofei asked,”Captain Liu, I’d like to ask if your flight crew can enter European countries?” Spain, Italy, and so on. ”

“Mr. Xia,” Liu An replied immediately,”we have an United States passport. We don’t have to go to Shengen.”

Xia ruofei held his forehead and smiled bitterly. He had really forgotten that although the crew members were all Chinese, they were all United States citizens. It was just that Li Yifu had specially selected Chinese who could speak Chinese to form this crew for the convenience of serving Xia ruofei.

At the same time, Xia ruofei could not help but complain that the treatment of the citizens of the lighthouse nation was really good ... But Xia ruofei immediately said to himself in his heart,”No matter how good their treatment is, don’t they still have to work for me?

“Is it okay for paradise to fly to Europe?” Xia ruofei continued.

“Of course!” Liu An said,”as long as it’s within the range of the flight, it can fly anywhere!”

“OK!”Xia ruofei said,”then you guys can apply for the route first! I’m going to ... Fly to Barcelona, Spain, the day after tomorrow. Can I make it in time?”

“There’s more than enough time to request for a flight route!” Liu An said,”as long as the airport at the destination meets the landing conditions, there will be no problem!”

“Alright! Let’s apply for a flight route first!” Xia ruofei said,”we’ll take off at San Shan the day after tomorrow!”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Liu An said.

“Oh, that’s right!” Xia ruofei thought of something and immediately asked,”how many passengers can paradise carry at most?”

“The Gulfstream G650 can carry a maximum of 18 passengers,” Liu An said without thinking.”However, Mr. Li paid more attention to the comfort of the plane back then. So, according to the current cabin layout, in addition to two pilots and two crew members, it can carry eight more passengers!”

“Alright, I got it.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”if nothing goes wrong, we should take off the day after tomorrow with a full load. You have to take this into account when you make the flight plan.”

“Understood!” Liu An replied briefly.

After the call with Liu An, Xia ruofei raised his wrist and looked at the time. There were about 20 minutes left before he got off work. He thought for a while, picked up the phone on his desk, and dialed an internal number.

“President Dong, you’re still working, right?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”do you have time now? I have something to discuss with you ... Okay, I’ll wait for you in the office!”

After a few minutes, someone knocked on Xia ruofei’s office door.

“Please enter!” Xia ruofei shouted.

Dong Yun, who was dressed professionally, pushed the door open and walked in. She came to Xia ruofei’s desk and asked,””Chairman, you were looking for me?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”come!” Sit down and talk!”

After Dong Yun sat down, Xia ruofei asked,””How many people will be in the first group to Spain?”

“Including you and me, there are 12 of us,” Dong Yun said without hesitation.

“That means there are 10 more employees?” Xia ruofei nodded.

“Yes, I am!” Dong Yun said. She then asked,”Chairman, when do we plan to leave?”

As a loyal fan of Barcelona, Dong Yun was looking forward to this trip to Spain.

“I really can’t ...” Xia ruofei muttered to himself.

“What?” Dong Yun asked.

“Oh! It’s nothing!” Xia ruofei said,”President Dong, why don’t you create a WeChat group and add the first batch of people to Spain, including me!”

Dong Yun didn’t think much about it. Usually, when a team went on a trip, they would create a WeChat group. If there was anything, they could just call out in the group and it would be more convenient for everyone to communicate.

Therefore, Dong Yun immediately took out her phone and created a WeChat group. There were a few employees that Dong Yun did not add as friends on WeChat, so she asked the other employees to pull each other in. Soon, all 12 people were in the WeChat group.

As soon as the group called “Spain freshman” was created, Dong Yun sent an emoji in.

Soon, the employees started to talk at the same time.

“There’s a group! Are we going to spend too much?”

“I’m looking forward to it!”

“Waa! The chairman was also in the group! Chairman, we’re all taking turns today. We’re not playing with our phones during working hours!”

“Yes, yes, yes! President Dong gave us a few days off!”

Dong Yun couldn’t help but laugh at everyone’s comments. She glanced at Xia ruofei.

Although Xia ruofei rarely appeared in the company, he had a high prestige among the lower – Level employees. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything. Instead, he sent a red packet in the group.

After he sent it, he immediately said,””President Dong, don’t order it! A total of 10 copies were distributed!”

Dong Yun couldn’t help but burst out laughing and said, “Don’t worry! I won’t fight with my employee for benefits!”

In fact, Dong Yun did not know Xia ruofei’s intention at all. She thought that Xia ruofei was just sending a red packet to liven up the atmosphere in the group. Under such circumstances, she would not snatch the red packet from the employees. Unless Xia ruofei sent a red packet to everyone, she would only count it at the end.
