Chapter 3442: Immortal mountain river (2)

Translator: 549690339

“No! How can we let her take away such an important treasure of the cloud Palace so easily?” The green – robed elder couldn’t help but Mutter to himself,”even if she’s the descendant of fairy Lingbo, she can’t…”

“Hahaha!” A burst of hearty laughter rang out in the lofty Hall,”Daoist Qing Xuan! I heard that my disciple from the cultivation world in China found the trial Pagoda and did quite well?”

As soon as he finished speaking, an old man who was also wearing a Daoist robe walked into the hall with a smile on his face.

If Xia ruofei was here, he would have recognized the old man. He was the previous owner of the painting, immortal mountain river.

When Xia ruofei had broken through to the Golden core stage, he had seen a trace of spiritual will left behind by immortal mountain river.

The old Daoist who had appeared in the lofty Hall of this hidden space enshrouded in purple Qi was exactly the same as the image that had been condensed by the thought.

Obviously, this was the original body of immortal mountain river. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The old man in the green Daoist robe was the “Daoist brother Qing Xuan” that Daoist master Shan He had mentioned. He turned around after hearing Daoist master Shan He’s voice.

This immortal mountain river wore a Grey – White Daoist robe. Although he had a smile on his face, there was a thick murderous aura between his brows. It was as if his entire person had a thick smell of blood.

Qing Xuan frowned and asked,””Brother mountain river, you’re back in rotation? You have such a strong killing intent! Is the situation there not good?”

Immortal mountain river grinned and said,””When will the situation over there get better? But with us old guys holding the fort, there won’t be any problems for a while! Daoist Qing Xuan, let’s not talk about these things. You still haven’t told me how my disciple in the cultivation world of the divine Lands performed.”

It would have been fine if the immortal mountain river had not mentioned it, but now that he did, Qing Xuan Taoist priest was so angry that he pouted at the mirror and said,””Your precious last disciple? He’s there! You can see for yourself!”

In the mirror, the figure was Xia ruofei.

Obviously, the disciple that immortal mountain river had left behind in the cultivation world of China was Xia ruofei.

When Xia ruofei communicated with the spiritual Pearl that was left by Reverend mountain river, the spiritual Pearl only knew what happened before it was separated from him. It had no memory of what happened to Reverend mountain river after that.

Just as the thought was about to disappear, Xia ruofei made a request to be apprenticed to a master. The thought of the immortal Shanhe accepted it with pleasure.

So, Xia ruofei was really the last disciple of immortal mountain river.

However, at that time, immortal mountain river had already sent this thought away for three to four hundred years. He himself had already left earth a long time ago, but he still knew about Xia ruofei’s situation. This did sound a little magical.

However, in reality, for an expert at the level of spiritual master Shanhe, this was not a difficult task.

Once the will left the spiritual Pearl, it would not be maintained for a long time. All the memories in this short period of time were considered to be quite small. Therefore, when immortal mountain river set up the spiritual Pearl, he had already thought of this. When the will disappeared, a special array would be activated. No matter how far away immortal mountain river was from earth, this array could directly transfer the short – term memory left by the split will to immortal mountain river’s original body.

He knew that his split – off consciousness had taken in a disciple in the cultivation world on earth, so it was no surprise.

Venerable Shanhe had rushed over because he had heard that Xia ruofei had entered the Tower of Trials and had performed outstandingly.

He did not care about Qing Xuan’s attitude and looked at the mirror Magic treasure with a smile.

“My disciple is already in the middle Jindan stage? Not bad, not bad. How long has it been? As expected, your talent is unparalleled!” Daoist master mountain river said happily. Then, he showed a puzzled expression and said,”isn’t he in the Tower of Trials? Where was this place? Eh? This place looks a little familiar!”

Immortal mountain river took a closer look and his eyes widened. He cried out, “Isn’t this the seventh level of the Tower of Trials? How did you become like this?”

After he finished speaking, he turned to look at the dark – faced Qing Xuan Daoist priest and suddenly laughed out loud.

“Hahaha! It really is the seventh level of the Tower of Trials!” “Hahahaha!” Daoist mountain river laughed.”The heavenly cloud Palace has disappeared!” This disciple of mine is amazing! Even the heavenly cloud Palace had been wiped out by him! Daoist Qing Xuan, you’re going to have a headache this time

Daoist Qing Xuan said unhappily, “with him?” A cultivator in the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm wanted to take away the heavenly cloud Palace? Shanhe, what are you thinking?”

Immortal mountain river also showed a trace of doubt and said,””He didn’t take away the heavenly cloud Palace? Then where did the heavenly cloud Palace go? Could it have turned into a spirit and flown away?”

Qing Xuan said angrily, “the heavenly cloud Palace has indeed been taken away by someone. However, it was not done by your precious disciple. It was his cultivation partner. It was the little girl beside him!”

Immortal mountain river glanced at Ling Qingxue, who was beside Xia ruofei, then shook his head and said,””Impossible! That was impossible! This little girl was only at the Qi refining stage! Daoist Qing Xuan, your joke is not funny at all! Even if you want to make up a story, at least make it look like it!”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan said unhappily,”I’m worried to death, I don’t have the mood to joke with you!” It really was that little girl!”

“So fierce?” Daoist master mountain river couldn’t help but take another look at Ling Qingxue in the mirror and asked,”what exactly is going on? That little girl

“I don’t know either!” Qing Xuan said,”but if I’m not wrong, this girl should have the aura of fairy Lingbo’s bloodline. The ward did not stop her at all. Moreover, once she got the control core of the heavenly cloud Palace, it recognized her as its master! I was also caught off guard!”

Hearing this, immortal mountain river could not help but be stunned. After a long while, he burst into laughter and pointed at Taoist priest Qing Xuan,”Daoist brother Qing Xuan, such a thing actually happened! You’ve really suffered a great loss this time… As expected of my disciple, even the Dao companion you found is so powerful, and has the aura of fairy Lingbo’s bloodline…”

“Brother mountain river, stop gloating! I’m worried to death!” Daoist Qing Xuan said,”the seventh level of the trial Pagoda is in such a state now. How are we going to test the cultivators who enter the trial Pagoda? I’m considering whether I should take back the cloud Palace!”

“You must not! He got the treasure with his own ability, why should he take it back!” Immortal mountain river said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei was his disciple and his cultivation partner was his junior. He naturally had to protect her.

Qing Xuan couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said,”You two are indeed master and disciple. You say almost the same thing, and you two are the same … Thick – skinned!”

Immortal mountain river laughed and said,””Daoist Qing Xuan, thank you for the compliment! But I’m right! Since the control core of the heavenly cloud Palace was there, and the cultivators who entered the Tower of Trials had the ability to take it away and make it recognize them as its master, then they should recognize it! Besides… Even if you want to take it back, can you? Don’t forget that the control core has taken the initiative to recognize its master. Now, my disciple’s cultivation partner is already the master of the heavenly cloud Palace! Unless you kill her, how are you going to take it back?”

At this point, immortal mountain river stared into Qing Xuan’s eyes and said,””You’re not really thinking of doing that, are you? Daoist Qing Xuan, let me tell you! That’s my disciple’s wife, I won’t sit by and watch this happen!” Daoist Qing Xuan pouted and said,””Do I look like such a brutal person? You’re underestimating me!”

Then, he sighed and said,””Forget it! Forget it! Since she has already obtained the heavenly cloud Palace and did not cheat, I will respect the rules and admit it!”
