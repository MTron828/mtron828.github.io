Chapter 110: Chapter 108 – daggers drawn -1

Deng Ming stood still and slowly turned around. He stared at Xia ruofei viciously and said,””I didn’t ask this damn fatty to compensate me. Do you think I’m too easy to talk to? Go out and find out who I am first! Even if you’re taking advantage of me, you still have to find a good partner!” “You knocked down my friend, insulted him, and even asked him to pay for it. I just want you to apologize, and you’re taking advantage of me?” Xia ruofei said sarcastically,”I really don’t know who you are. However, I’ve traveled the world with reason. It doesn’t matter who you are!” This was Xia ruofei’s temper. If others opened their hearts to him, he would also open his heart to others. Pang Hao had been his good friend for many years and had stood up for him many times during the class reunion. Naturally, Xia ruofei saw him as a brother. Since pang Hao had been wronged, Xia ruofei would definitely help him get back at him. As for Deng Ming’s identity, to be honest, he really didn’t care. “I ...” Deng Ming gritted his teeth. “I forgot to remind you!” Xia ruofei rudely interrupted Deng Ming’s words.”If you keep saying ‘I’m your father’, I can’t guarantee that I won’t make your face swell first!” “You ... How dare you be so arrogant in front of me!” Deng Ming’s eyes were spitting fire as he said,”don’t think that you’re great just because you’re skilled. There are some people you can’t afford to offend!” Ye Lingyun was enough to make Deng Ming afraid. Since ye Lingyun called this fair and clean – looking young man an instructor, his skills must be no worse than ye Lingyun ‘s. This was also an important reason why Deng Ming had been suppressing his anger. Otherwise, with his temper, he would have already called his scoundrels to gang up on him and give him a beating. “You talk too much nonsense!” Xia ruofei pouted and said,”I’ll give you two choices. One, apologize to my friend. Two, I’ll beat you up until you apologize to my friend.” You can choose!” Xia ruofei’s tone was exactly the same as Deng Ming’s when he spoke to ye Lingyun. In fact, he was even more arrogant than Deng Ming. Deng Ming was so angry that smoke was coming out of his seven orifices. He glared at Xia ruofei fiercely and panted as he said,””Good, you have guts! I’ll play with you to the end today!” He then turned around and said,”Dahua, call old Zheng from West River moon!” Tell him that if he continues to play dead, I’ll bring people here tomorrow to seal off this damn club of his! Changqing, call Ah Biao and tell him that I told him to come over with his men! Tell him that if he doesn’t show up in ten minutes, he can forget about staying in the three mountains!” Deng Ming looked at Xia ruofei ferociously and said,””Come on! If you have the guts, try and touch my finger!” “Ruofei, forget it, forget it ...” Pang Hao said from the side. He could tell that Deng Ming had a powerful background. If this matter was blown out of proportion, Xia ruofei would definitely be implicated. As a brother, he naturally did not want to see such a thing happen. Deng Ming sneered and said,”now you’re scared?” I’m telling you, it’s too late! Come and hit me if you dare!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”I’ve seen people proposing to me. I’ve never thought that someone would ask for a beating!” There’s really no such thing as the most despicable, only even more despicable!” As soon as he finished speaking, he exerted a little force on his feet and his whole body shot out like lightning. He arrived in front of Deng Ming almost instantly. Then, two crisp slaps sounded. Deng Ming stood in place in a daze, even forgetting the burning pain on his face. He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to hit him without any hesitation. Ye Lingyun, on the other hand, was watching Xia ruofei’s back. Xia ruofei’s speed just now had made his eyes light up, and his heart was filled with admiration. “You keep calling me your father. Whose father are you?” Xia ruofei said coldly,”I did remind you, but your pig brain doesn’t have a good memory!” Deng Ming’s eyes were bloodshot. He had been slapped in the face by Xia ruofei in front of so many friends. It was a great humiliation! “Motherf * cker! Go all out with him! Let’s attack together!” Deng Ming shouted. Just as Deng Ming’s scoundrels were about to rush forward, a cold voice rang out,”Stop!” Wu Liqian, the new deputy head of Changping County, was wearing a fitting suit and walked quickly between the two groups of people. She was slightly out of breath, and there was a little sweat on her bun. It was obvious that she had rushed over quickly. Wu Liqian had some alcohol that night, so her face was white with a tinge of red. When she panted, her full chest rose and fell, adding a bit of mature charm to her. Deng Ming looked at Wu Liqian’s perky breasts greedily and said,”So it’s County Head Wu!” Wu Liqian had previously been Tian Huilan’s Secretary for a long time, and Tian Huilan’s position at the time was the mayor. She was Deng Ming’s colleague, so Deng Ming naturally knew Wu Liqian. Wu Liqian glanced at Deng Ming indifferently and nodded slightly, but her attitude was obviously very calm. Then, she looked at Xia ruofei and asked with a frown,””Ruofei, what’s going on?” “Sis Wu, you’re here too!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”my friend was bumped into by Mr. Deng. Not only did he not apologize, but he also insulted my friend. I’m trying to reason with him!” “Xiao Deng, is that so?” Wu Liqian asked with a frown. “So you know this kid, Mayor Wu!” Deng Ming immediately said. Things were not as he said! It was that fat guy who hit me. Look, my clothes are all stained with red wine. And you saw it too, that kid hit me first!” He glared at Xia ruofei and continued,””County Head Wu, since you know him, then please uphold justice! Now, it’s me, Deng Ming, who got hit by him. Tell me what to do!” “You’re quite good at twisting the truth!”Xia ruofei smiled. Then, he pointed at the top of Deng Ming’s head and said,”Do you see what that is? A surveillance camera! Let’s go check the surveillance footage now. If my friend really hit you, I’ll pay for your suit and give you an explanation for hitting you!” Then, Xia ruofei paused, stared at Deng Ming, and said coldly,””If it’s like what my friend said, that you’re the one who knocked him down and made a false accusation, what do you say?” “I think this is a good idea!” Wu Liqian smiled and asked,”Xiao Deng, what do you think? The surveillance cameras won’t lie. If RUO Fei’s friend is in the wrong, I won’t help him. ” Deng Ming was immediately at a loss for words. He knew very well who was right and who was wrong. After hemming and hawing for a while, Deng Ming said,””I drank some wine just now, so I can’t really remember ... But even if I accidentally touched that fatty, so what? Does that mean he can hit people as he wishes?” “When it comes to you, it’s called” accidentally “?” Xia ruofei sneered.”What a double standard! You were begging me to hit you just now!” “You ...” Deng Ming was furious.”County Head Wu, you’ve seen his attitude. It’s not that I’m not giving you face!” “Chang Qing, call the police!” Didn’t he say that there were surveillance cameras? There’s irrefutable evidence that he hit me just now!” “Alright!” The long – haired young man behind Deng Ming grinned and took out his phone to call the police. Wu Liqian frowned and said,”Xiao Deng, there’s no need to call the police.” It’s just a little friction, why make a mountain out of a molehill?” Then, Wu Liqian said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, it’s not right for Xiao Deng to bump into your friend, but you’ve already vented your anger just now. Can you give sis Wu some face and let this matter go?” Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders indifferently and said,””Since sis Wu has spoken, of course I have no problem with that!” Pang Hao wasn’t injured anyway. Deng Ming, on the other hand, had been slapped twice. His molars must have loosened. Xia ruofei didn’t hold back at all. No matter how he looked at it, he didn’t seem to be at a disadvantage. Deng Ming sneered,”County Head Wu, aren’t you being too obvious with your bias?” I, Deng Ming, have never suffered such a big loss in my life! Just a little friction and you call it that?” “Evergreen! What are you doing? Aren’t you going to call the police?” Deng Ming said to the long – haired young man with a frown. Obviously, he was not going to give Wu Liqian any face. Seeing this, Wu Liqian’s expression turned cold and she said indifferently,””Xiao Deng, you should reconsider! It’s a waste of police resources to call the police over such a small matter ...” Then, she paused for a moment before she said meaningfully,””By the way, I heard that you have a big investment project in Changping County? I want to thank you for your support in the economic development of Changping!” The threat in his words was already very obvious, so Wu Liqian didn’t continue to make it clear. She just looked at Deng Ming quietly.
