Chapter 475: A roundabout stratagy_2

“There is! What’s the matter?” Lu You said.

“Help me call him and tell him that the Public Security Bureau has a bonus for him. Tell him to contact the publicity department in our Bureau.” Qin Xiaoyu said,”I’ll send you the contact number later.”

Qin Xiao Yu did not want to contact Xia ruofei directly, so she thought of such a roundabout way. She was thinking of telling the publicity department about this matter later. Anyway, they were also in charge of the bonuses and press conference that Chen Bo had ordered. When Xia ruofei contacted them directly, she would not have to see Xia ruofei’s smug look.

However, Lu You’s curiosity grew after hearing Qin Xiao Yu’s words.

She took a few steps to the side and asked in a low voice,””Bonus? Sister Xiaoyu, what’s going on? Why did you give him a bonus out of the blue?”

“It’s nothing much ... He just happened to help us catch a fugitive, and the reward was the reward for the arrest of the suspect ...”Qin Xiao Yu said lightly.

Lu You was very interested and said,”sister Xiaoyu, tell me in detail.” Why was that guy so good at causing trouble? The farm owner was fine, but he went to catch a fugitive for you? Isn’t he trying to steal your jobs?”

Lu You had touched on a sore spot and Qin Xiao Yu couldn’t help but roll her eyes.”You can ask him about the specific situation yourself! He would definitely talk about it with great enthusiasm, and he would even want to make himself into a Superman who wore his underwear on the outside! Youyou, it’s such a small matter. You won’t refuse to help, will you?”

Lu You smiled and said,”no problem!” You can count on me. You want him to contact your publicity department, right? Just send me your number and don’t worry about anything else. ”

“Thanks!” Qin Xiao Yu said, then she was a little worried and reminded,”tell him to contact me as soon as possible! By tomorrow at the latest, you won’t be able to wait until you’re late!”

“I know!” Lu You said.

She was just worried that she had no reason to contact Xia ruofei! The “mission” that Qin Xiao Yu gave her was exactly what she wanted.

After hanging up the phone, Lu You thought for a while and walked to Jiang Yue.”Yueyue, I have something urgent to attend to. Please help me apply for leave ...”

Lu You did not look into Jiang Yue’s eyes. Although Jiang Yue was not together with Xia ruofei and she only had a faint feeling for her, she always felt guilty in front of Jiang Yue.

“Youyou, what’s so urgent?” Jiang Yue asked, not understanding the situation. Can’t you go after class?”

“If you can delay it until after class, then it’s not an urgent matter.” Lu You said as she avoided his gaze.

“But ... Teacher li is very strict in this class.” Jiang Yue said worriedly,”he takes attendance for every class and ... If you take leave after you’ve left, wouldn’t you be acting first and reporting later? It definitely won’t work. ”

“Oh yeah! “If you didn’t mention it, I would have almost forgotten. This class is teacher Li’s ...” Lu You said.

Jiang Yue heaved a sigh of relief. She thought that Lu You had changed her mind and decided to go to class. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Unexpectedly, Lu You’s eyes darted around, and she said with a smile,””Yueyue, then I’ll give you the glorious task of asking for leave!”

After she finished speaking, Lu You leaned close to Jiang Yue’s ear and chuckled,””I heard that this instructor li asked you out for a meal some time ago! If you use a little honey trap, you can definitely settle a small matter like taking a leave of absence. I have high hopes for you ...”

Jiang Yue was dumbfounded. Lu You had already turned around and walked in the opposite direction.

Lu You walked a few steps and returned. She stuffed the book in her hands into Jiang Yue’s arms and said,””Yueyue, help me to the end. After class, help me bring my books back to the dormitory! Thank you ... I’ll bring you some good food!”

After saying that, Lu You quickly left, leaving Jiang Yue with an expression of not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

At the thought of having to help Lu You apply for leave from that lecturer Li, Jiang Yue’s face turned even more bitter.

She didn’t see the conflicted expression in Lu You’s eyes when she had her back to her.

Lu You’s heart was always wavering when it came to matters related to Xia ruofei. It was obvious that she had not thought of how to tell Jiang Yue.

Lu You shook her head in self – mockery,”actually, she and Jiang Yue are in the same boat. Xia ruofei already has a tall, beautiful, and well – off girlfriend. Moreover, the two of them are quite in love. What’s the point of thinking so much?”

Very quickly, Lu You threw these distracting thoughts to the back of her mind. She found her BMW MINI that was parked in a nearby parking space. After getting into the car, she took out her phone and called Xia ruofei with a trace of anticipation.

Xia ruofei was at the Jade Market. He had visited many shops and was dazzled by the quality of the Jade. However, he was disappointed that there was no high – Quality sheep – Fat white jade without any impurities.

When he received Lu You’s call, Xia ruofei was about to return to the house. He did not have much hope and could only ask Hengfeng jewelry for help if it really did not work.

Seeing that it was Lu You, Xia ruofei immediately picked up the phone.

“Lu You, what’s the matter?” Xia ruofei said.

“Can’t I find you for no reason?” Lu You asked almost subconsciously.

“Of course not.” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”miss Lu, it’s my honor to have you call me!”
