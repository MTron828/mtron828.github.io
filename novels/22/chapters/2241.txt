2242 The hard – working guest (2)

“I’ve already gotten the feeling after cutting it every day ...” The older lady was a little embarrassed by He Jiong’s praise.

She swiftly wrapped the meat and handed it to He Jiong.

There was a QR code on the meat stall now. He Jiong directly scanned the code and paid for the meat.

Such a small piece of meat was gone in just over 30 pieces.

From the looks of it, a hundred Yuan was really not a good spending.

Then, He Jiong and Xia ruofei strolled around and bought a pound of vermicelli.

Before they left, Huang Lei, who held the glorious position of a chef, specifically reminded He Jiong to bring back some spices. Hence, He Jiong and Xia ruofei continued to buy.

By the time the two of them walked out of the farmer’s market with a few bags of ingredients and condiments, the 100 – Yuan meal allowance provided by the festival Group was almost gone.

He Jiong was a natural opinionated person. He did not worry about the food allowance for the future recording of the show. Instead, he was in high spirits as he chatted with Xia ruofei about some of his experience in the market.

Agricultural products were a very important product of Xia ruofei’s company, and Xia ruofei had some experience in this area. As the two chatted, they felt like they should have met earlier.

The two of them got into the car and drove back to the mushroom house.

The car stopped by the steps below the mushroom house. He Jiong honked the horn a few times before he stuck his head out of the window and shouted,”My children! Hurry up and move the things!”

A head peeked out from behind the one – meter – High courtyard wall, his black eyes looking around. This person was indeed Peng Chang, who was chopping firewood in the courtyard. He quickly said,””They’re coming! It’s here! It’s coming!”

Soon, Peng Chang pushed open the wooden door of the mushroom hut and jogged down the steps.

Peng Chang looked at the big and small bags of ingredients, and his eyes couldn’t help but light up.”Teacher he, President Xia, did you buy all these?”

“Then why don’t you talk nonsense?” He Jiong laughed and said,”are we going to Rob? Pengpeng, don’t worry about it. Hurry up and bring the things in and hand them over to teacher Huang!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Alright!” Peng Chang quickly responded and took the bag of food from He Jiong’s hand.

At this time, Huang Lei and Zhang Xing had also come out.

Seeing this, He Jiong immediately said,”Ms. Huang, I’ve prepared everything you wanted. The ingredients for the pork stew with vermicelli are also ready. You can show your skills now!”

“That’s great!” Huang Lei said happily,”Pengpeng, you can just put the things on the stove!”

“Alright, teacher Huang!” Peng Chang said as he walked in.

He Jiong then said to Zhang Xing,”Xiao Xing, bring President Xia to the vegetable greenhouse!” Can you assist him in watering the vegetables and at the same time, pick some vegetables for him?”

“No problem!” Zhang Xing patted his chest and promised.

Zhang Xing was naturally more than willing to work and harvest with his idol.

“Mr. Xia, let’s go!” Zhang Xing said to Xia ruofei. I’ll take you to ...”

“Alright! Then I’ll have to trouble you, Little Star!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He Jiong and the rest returned to the mushroom house while Xia ruofei and Zhang Xing went around to the side of the mushroom house.

After turning a corner, Xia ruofei saw a row of vegetable greenhouses.

What surprised him was that the greenhouse was quite large, and there were several rows. The scale was much larger than he had imagined.

Moreover, these weren’t simple greenhouses. On the contrary, the construction was quite particular. Although it couldn’t be compared to the greenhouses of Taoyuan farm, it was at least the kind of high – end vegetable greenhouses that could maintain a constant temperature.

It seemed like xiangnan TV had invested quite a bit in this show!

After the recording of the show ended, this place could even be regarded as a harvesting experience. It was considered an overall special project with the mushroom house.

At the entrance of each vegetable greenhouse, there was a sign that read the vegetables grown in the greenhouse. The LOGO of paradise Corporation was very eye – catching.

Xia ruofei strode into the greenhouse and instantly felt as warm as spring. The temperature difference between the inside and outside of the greenhouse was already quite obvious.

Xia ruofei looked around. The peach Garden vegetables planted in the greenhouse were all full of energy and vitality.

Moreover, most of the vegetables in the greenhouse were already or about to ripen, and could be picked at any time.

A young man in work clothes bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and greeted,””Hello, President Xia!”

Xia ruofei looked at him and asked in surprise,””You’re ... An employee at the farm?”

The management of the farm was becoming more and more formal. The employees all wore work clothes to work. These clothes were wear – resistant and dirt – resistant, and they were more breathable, which made it more convenient to wear when working.

Hence, Xia ruofei recognized the familiar uniform at a glance.

“Yes, director Xia. Manager Cao sent me here to provide technical support for the Jie Ji group,” the young man nodded.

This young man was in front of the company’s Big Boss, and it was also his first time facing so many cameras, so he seemed a little nervous and even spoke with a trembling voice.

Only then did Xia ruofei realize that Cao tieshu had not only prepared sufficient vegetables for the festival Group to transplant, but he had even sent maintenance personnel over. His service was really on point!

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Xiao Xing and I are here to water the vegetables ... Oh, what’s your name?”

“Chairman, I’m Liu Fu!” The young man quickly said. He’s one of the first people the company hired!”

“Oh, really? That’s an old employee!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, he continued the topic,”our task is to water the vegetables and then pick some of them back ... Xiao Liu, can you teach us how to water the vegetables first?”

“Sure, sure!” Liu Fulai said quickly,”President Xia, Zhang Xing, this way please!”

After that, Liu Fulai led the way, followed by Xia ruofei and Zhang Xing.

Soon, they came to the side. Liu Fulai pointed at a switch and said,””The greenhouse has already been laid with irrigation pipes. As long as you press this button, the watering will start ...”

“It’s that simple?” Xia ruofei was slightly surprised.

He had thought that he would have to fetch water to water the plants, but it turned out to be so simple.

Wasn’t the task given to the guests by the festival team too unchallenging? This mission ... Even a fool could complete it, right?

Of course, Xia ruofei would not show it. Under Liu Fulai’s guidance, he tried to press the switch that Liu Fulai had pointed out.

Sure enough, after a while, the slightly raised irrigation faucet in the greenhouse began to spray water, and it would spin as it sprayed, so that the radius of the irrigation faucet could be used to the greatest extent.

Liu Fulai said,”director Xia, this matter can be said to be simple, but it’s also complicated!” It was actually quite complicated ... For example, you had to take care of the watering. If you watered too much, the roots would rot, so you had to calculate the time. In addition, there were some blind spots that needed to be watered. Moreover ... There are so many greenhouses here, and it will take quite a long time to water them one by one. ”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then let’s wait!”

Xia ruofei and Zhang Xing waited for a while. Xia ruofei went to observe the soil’s absorption to prevent too much water.

After watering one greenhouse, Xia ruofei and Zhang Xing went to the next one and watered the vegetables one by one.

It was only then that Xia ruofei found out that the transplanted vegetables that Cao tieshu had provided had been specially selected for different stages. Some vegetables in the greenhouse could be directly picked, while some needed to be planted for a period of time. This way, it could be guaranteed that the guests in each episode would have the opportunity to pick them themselves.

After the irrigation, Xia ruofei and Zhang Xing picked some vegetables, such as water spinach, tomatoes, broccoli, and so on ...

The two of them put the vegetables into plastic containers, each grabbing a head, and carried them back to the mushroom house.

He Jiong was playing with the two dogs in the courtyard. When he saw Xia ruofei and Zhang Xing, he quickly said,”Pengpeng! Hurry up and give her a Helms...Look at how tired our guest is ...”
