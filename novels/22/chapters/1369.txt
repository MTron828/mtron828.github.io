Xia ruofei skillfully poured the tea from the sea of tea into small teacups, then used a Tea Clip to serve the small teacups to everyone.

He smiled and said,”come and try this Da Hong Pao!” When everyone leaves, I’ll give each of you a little. It’s not a lot, so you can keep it for a taste!”

“Alright! Then I’ll thank you in advance!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

Zhao Yongjun and the others didn’t reject the tea.

“Good tea!”

“I think it’s even better than my dad’s special pre – rain Longjing tea!”

“Nonsense, they are two different types of tea leaves. How can they be compared?”

Song Rui, Hou Liang, and the others were discussing among themselves. Although they weren’t experts, their ability to judge tea leaves was still better than ordinary people. They were full of praise.

The group of them sipped tea and chatted in Xia ruofei’s Villa. When it was close to noon, they set off for the city.

Liu Zhe was the host for lunch.

They had eaten at Ling Ji’s private restaurant the night before, so Liu Zhe had decided to go to another restaurant for lunch. It was neither a popular restaurant nor a star – rated hotel. He had chosen a membership – based restaurant on hot springs Road.

This hot spring Club was quite famous in Sanshan city. The specialty dishes of Sanshan were pretty good, mainly because there were natural hot springs here. After everyone finished eating, they took a short break and directly soaked in the hot spring in the club.

In the afternoon, they slept in the guest room provided by the club. They only woke up at around fouro’ clock. Then, Liu Zhe brought everyone to the only relatively well – known scenic spot in San Shan city, the San Huang San Fang Qi Street.

There were well – preserved ancient buildings and the former residences of many famous people, including famous historical figures such as Bingxin, Lin Zexu, and Lin Juemin. Zhao Yongjun and the others were all wandering in the antique alleys in high spirits and touring the place.

Under Xia ruofei’s special instructions, Liu Zhe did not arrange for dinner at a hotel. Instead, he brought everyone to San Fang Qi Street to try San Shan’s specialty snacks. They ate as they walked and were very relaxed.

Walking from one end of the commercial South back street to the other end, everyone had basically eaten until their stomachs were round. Whether it was Sanshan’s specialty fishballs, swallow meat, or the paste by the cauldron, they were all very full. Even people with large appetites would be full soon after eating a few more kinds.

Moreover, the shops on both sides of the road hung red lanterns and antique sign flags. In addition, there were many tourists and it was full of life, so everyone had a good time.

Liu Zhe had wanted to arrange for everyone to go sing, but song Rui and the others, who were always in those places in the capital, were not very interested. After playing for half a day, they missed the quiet environment of the farm, so they decided to go home.

Of course, after two interactions, Liu Zhe had established a certain relationship with Zhao Yongjun and the others. Hou Liang even took the initiative to exchange contact information with him. This made Liu Zhe quite satisfied.

After all, a relationship had to be stabilized step by step. Through constant contact, as long as one had the intention to make friends and their emotional intelligence was not low, their relationship would naturally get better and better.

The most difficult part was that there was no guide. Xia ruofei had already completed the first step for Liu Zhe, and the rest would be up to him.

However, for Xia ruofei’s sake, Hou Liang and the others would take care of Liu Zhe.

On the way back, Xia ruofei asked for everyone’s opinion.

There were indeed not many places to visit in the three mountains. In the entire country, the most famous place in the southeast province was the island’s special district, Egret Island City. Even some people who did not know much about the southeast province would mistakenly think that Egret Island was the capital of the southeast province.

Zhao Yongjun and the others weren’t so ignorant, but they also yearned for the coquettish air and ocean charm of Heron Island.

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to take them on a trip to Heron Island the next day.

Anyway, Zhao Yongjun and the others had come to the three mountains to play with Xia ruofei and visit his farm. They had no objections to the specific arrangements, so they did as they pleased.

Besides, Xia ruofei also considered that he could visit Lin Qiao if he went to Egret Island.

The New Year’s holiday was coming, so Lin Qiao didn’t plan to go back to the three mountains.

Now, there were only three days of holiday for New Year’s Day and several exams for the final term. Therefore, Lin Qiao decided to stay in school to review. Since the winter vacation was not far away, she could go home directly during the winter vacation.

Back at the guest house on the farm, Zhao Yongjun and the others were playing cards. Xia ruofei didn’t join in the fun. He told the staff on duty to make sure everything was in order and then went home.

Xia ruofei first called Hu ‘Zi’s mother and told her that he was going to Egret Island tomorrow. If there was anything he needed to bring, he could prepare it tonight and take a detour to get it tomorrow.

Although Egret Island was very close to the three mountains, a mother’s concern for her daughter would not decrease because of the geographical location. When Hu Zi’s mother heard that Xia ruofei was going to Egret Island, she indeed said that she would bring some thick clothes for Lin Qiao.

Didn’t they say that there was a type of cold called ‘mom thinks you’re cold’? It was this kind of situation ...

Besides, she also decided to cook a few of Lin Qiao’s favorite dishes for Xia ruofei to bring along.
