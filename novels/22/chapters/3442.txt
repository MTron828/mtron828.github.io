“That’s the way!” Daoist mountain river was overjoycd.”It’s just a place to test cultivators in the nascent Soul Stage, the Aurous core stage, and the Qi refining stage. Without the heavenly cloud Palace, it can’t be carried out? Will this be a problem for you, Qing Xuan?”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan blew at his beard and glared,”you’re just standing there and talking!” Why don’t you try it?”

Immortal mountain river waved his hand and said,”every profession has its own specialty!” Everyone has their own duties, how can I overstep my duties?”

Then, he quickly changed the topic,””That’s right, this disciple of mine should have passed the trial Pagoda’s 7th level test! The two of them had even accepted the heavenly cloud Palace. This mission’s completion rate had definitely reached 100%! Then the mission reward …”

Daoist Qing Xuan glared at him and said,”you’ve even taken away the heavenly cloud Palace, and you still want other rewards?” No way!”

Immortal mountain river didn’t mind. He curled his lips and said,””I knew you were stingy! You’re a miser!”

“You…” Daoist Qing Xuan could not help but feel angry.

On the seventh level of the trial Pagoda, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue stood in the empty square.

The two of them did not know what to do next. The heavenly cloud Palace had been taken away and the seventh floor of the trial tower was empty, but the mission prompt had not been updated.

Could it be that because he had taken over the cloud Palace, he was stuck here? Would it be impossible to evaluate the mission completion rate without the cloud Palace?

Xia ruofei’s heart couldn’t help but beat like a drum.”Should I… Put the cloud Palace back first?”

Just as he was hesitating, a new line of text appeared in the mission prompt:

Mission completed. Please enter the eighth floor of the Tower of Trials through the passageway.

It was a line of cold words, but Xia ruofei could feel a trace of resentment between the lines.

This must be an illusion! Xia ruofei shook his head.

However, wasn’t this mission hint a little too simple?

Didn’t they say that they had to evaluate the mission completion rate and give out the reward?

What about the mission completion rate? Where’s the reward?

In addition, where was the entrance to the passage? He had to give some hints! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei had had enough of these riddles, but he was helpless.

He had no choice but to lower his head!

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly. Ling Qingxue saw this and could not help but ask,””RUO Fei, what’s wrong?”

Xia ruofei told Ling Qingxue about the mission and said,””Qingxue, what do you think… Is going on? Didn’t they say that the reward would be given according to the completion rate of the mission? Why isn’t the evaluation result out yet? and where to receive the reward?”

In the hidden space enshrouded in purple mist, Daoist Qing Xuan snorted and said,””Shanhe, your disciple is just like you! He had already wiped out the entire heavenly cloud Palace and he still wanted a reward! Isn’t this too greedy?”

Immortal mountain river laughed and said,””Who told you to set the rules and reward according to the completion rate of the mission? Now that he had completed the mission, and had done it so well, you had no reward. It’s fine if you don’t give out the reward, but you don’t want people to have doubts? Isn’t this too overbearing?”

Daoist priest Qing Xuan glared at Daoist master mountain river and did not even bother to say anything.

Losing the cloud Palace had indeed made him very depressed.

On the seventh floor of the trial Pagoda.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Ling Qingxue hesitated for a moment before saying,””Could it be because I took away the cloud Palace, so there is no reward? Do you want to …”

“Silly girl!” Xia ruofei did not wait for Ling Qingxue to finish her sentence and interrupted her,”what reward can be more valuable than the cloud Palace! Do I need to say how to choose? Forget it! So what if there’s no reward! The problem is that we don’t know where the exit is. The quest prompt didn’t say anything, and there’s no indication on the perceptual mirror map. How are we supposed to find it?”

As soon as Xia ruofei’s voice fell, a light screen door appeared two to three meters away from them.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue could not help but widen their eyes.

It can be operated like this?

After a long while, Xia ruofei said,”I’m starting to feel that this trial Pagoda doesn’t operate on its own. Maybe someone is controlling it from the background!” Maybe the person operating the Tower of Trials can even hear us!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but look around and said,'”’Don’t scare me. This is too…”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”even if there are people watching, I’m not afraid!” I’m just telling the truth! Am I right? There was no rule that anyone who participated in the trial could not take away the heavenly cloud Palace! Otherwise, he wouldn’t have placed the control core there! If we can’t find the control core, we won’t have any ideas about it, right? The rules state that there will be a reward for completing the mission, but now that we’ve completed it and there’s no reward, why can’t we say anything?”

In the lofty Hall in the space enshrouded in purple mist, immortal mountain river looked at the mirror – like magical treasure and laughed, saying,””Daoist Qing Xuan, my disciple is telling the truth! You can’t take revenge!”

Daoist Qing Xuan glared at immortal mountain river and said,””Is Qing Xuan such a petty person? To stoop to the level of a golden core child? However, there was definitely no reward! You can’t say anything!”

Immortal mountain river laughed and said,”alright, alright, alright!” I won’t give it to you just because you say so! My disciple doesn’t lack that little bit of reward! When I meet him, I’ll give him a big gift! It’s much better than any reward you’ve given me!”

Daoist Qing Xuan’s eyes could not help but narrow as he said,””Brother mountain river, you’re going to meet this disciple? He was only at the Golden core stage! Knowing too much is not a good thing for his cultivation…. To be honest, although this disciple of yours is a little talkative, his talent is still very good, and he will definitely become a great person in time! You can’t spoil things by pulling up seedlings!”
