Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””Follow me for the next few days. 1’11 take you around, and you’ll know what you need to do. Also, it’s to meet everyone. In the future, the pharmaceutical factory and winery will contact you directly.”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Zheng Yongshou said respectfully.

In fact, in Zheng Yongshou’s view, these things in the secular world were naturally not worth mentioning. How could they be more important than cultivation? Farms, farms, wineries, pharmaceutical factories, and so on were nothing more than to earn some money, and money was meaningless to cultivators.

However, since Xia ruofei had personally arranged for this to be done, the meaning was different.

Even if Zheng Yongshou didn’t understand at all, he would still carry it out to the letter.

Xia ruofei continued,”this period of time might affect your cultivation. You need to familiarize yourself with the three mountains first. At the same time, you need to get used to the life in the secular world and learn how to interact with the ordinary people in the secular world. This includes using mobile phones and some of the technological products in the secular world. In the future, when you get used to it, these specific matters will not take up too much of your time.”

As a cultivator, it wouldn’t be too difficult for Zheng Yongshou to adapt to life in the secular world. After all, his spiritual power was much stronger than ordinary people, which meant that his brain development was greater and his learning ability was stronger. For Zheng Yongshou, the difficulty might actually be in dealing with the ordinary people of the secular world. After all, he had basically been cultivating in the sect for the past few decades. Even if he came out, he rarely came into contact with the ordinary people of the secular world. In terms of worldly wisdom, he was much worse than the average person.

“It doesn’t matter if it affects my cultivation!” Zheng Yongshou said,”it’s my honor to be able to serve Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”I’ve never let my subordinates suffer. So, you don’t have to worry about cultivation. I’ll compensate you.” In the future, after you’ve adapted to these daily tasks, you can cultivate on the Peach Blossom Island. Every month, you can take some time to come to the three mountains to deal with some matters. If there are any special circumstances, you can come back at the last minute. The rest of the time, you can cultivate in peace!”

What Zheng Yongshou had to do was nothing more than adding the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower to the water source of Tao Yuan farm. Every month, he would hand it over to the winery and provide the medicinal factory with the raw materials of Chinese medicine. The rest was to provide Da Hong Pao tea Green tea, Cordyceps, top – grade ginseng, and so on from time to time. After he became familiar with it, he could completely concentrate all these work on one or two days. Even if there were some unexpected situations that needed to be dealt with, he could still have a lot of time to cultivate on Tao Yuan Island every month.

the cultivation environment on the peach blossom island was obviously much better than that of the star seizer sect.

therefore, zheng yongshou was pleasantly surprised when he heard this, and said gratefully,””mr. xia! thank you! thank you!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

he still didn’t know that the highest heaven formation had been added to the peach blossom island, otherwise, he would have been even more surprised, after a luotian formation was embedded in the taixu xuanqing formation, its effect was definitely greater than one plus one. the assistance of the luotian formation to cultivation was really all – round, any cultivator who enjoyed the assistance of the luotian formation would feel that it was boring to go to those paradisiacal lands.

after all, there would be no harm without comparison.

xia ruofei patted zheng yongshou’s shoulder and said,””that’s all i have to say. go and settle down with president zheng first, in the afternoon, i’ll bring you around the various locations of paradise corporation to familiarize you with the situation, you’ll be in charge of the management of paradise corporation.” “yes! mr. xia!” zheng yongshou said respectfully,”then i’ll take my leave!” xia ruofei nodded and said,”keep your phone open, call me if you need anything!” remember to learn more from president zheng and master the life skills of the secular world as soon as possible, don’t make a fool of yourself.” “i know, don’t worry! i will!” zheng yongshou said.

Xia ruofei came to the door personally. Zheng Yi got out of the car when he heard the sound. He quickly walked up to Xia ruofei when he saw him.

“President Xia, are you done with your discussion?” Zheng Yi asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sorry to keep you waiting, President Zheng!” 1’11 have to trouble you to take old Zheng to settle down first. I’ll take him to the company in the afternoon.”

“Alright! Alright!” Zheng Yi quickly said,”director Xia, Mr. Zheng has us to take care of him. Don’t worry! Should 1 send him to paradise Corporation in the afternoon or…”

“Let’s go to the entrance of my neighborhood! It’s two in the afternoon!” Xia ruofei said.

“Alright! No problem!” Zheng Yi said,”director Xia, then… If you don’t have any other instructions, we’ll take our leave.”

“Yes, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re too kind!” Zheng Yi said.

Xia ruofei stood at the entrance of the courtyard and waved at Zheng Yi and Zheng Yongshou. He only turned around and returned to the courtyard after the car started to leave.

Ling Qingxue had gone to the company with Ling Xiaotian in the morning. Some of the specific work she had on hand would be handed over in the next two days. By then, she would only retain the nominal position of the company’s director. She basically didn’t have to manage any Affairs and could be said to be completely free.

The handover of work was also quite complicated, especially since the work she was in charge of was more important. So, Ling Qingxue did not come back in the afternoon and had lunch directly at the company.

Alone, Xia ruofei made some noodles for a simple meal and went upstairs to take a nap..
