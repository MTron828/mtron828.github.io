3063 I don’t dare to reject an elder’s gift (2)

“I’ll remember that!” Xia ruofei hugged Song Wei and kissed her on the forehead.”Weiwei, I’ll be leaving now!”

“I’ll drive you ...” Song Wei said quickly.

“No need, I’ve already left by airboat from the rooftop. Don’t go upstairs anymore!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you should stay and pack your things! You have to make good use of your storage ring!”

“Alright then!” Song Wei said,”remember to visit me in Beijing when you’re free!”

“Definitely!”

With that, Xia ruofei let go of Ling Qingxue and walked towards the door.

When they were about to leave, Xia ruofei waved at Ling Qingxue, closed the door, and walked towards the elevator.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei arrived at the rooftop of this high – Class apartment. After retrieving the flying boat, he quickly steered it out of the Yujing Sky City district.

Xia ruofei did not notice that Song Wei was standing behind the glass door of the balcony, watching the futuristic – looking black airboat suddenly accelerate, turning into a small black dot in the blink of an eye and disappearing into the horizon ...

After Xia ruofei had found the location of Peach Blossom Island, he controlled the airboat to rise to an empty level that even commercial planes could not reach. Then, he flew straight in the direction of Peach Blossom Island.

The black flying boat flew steadily for about two and a half hours before it arrived at the sea near the Peach Blossom Island.

Ever since he had this black flying boat, spatial distance no longer seemed to be a problem. In the past, it would take more than ten hours to fly from Huaxia to Peach Blossom Island by private jet, and he had to land and refuel once in the middle.

It had only been two hours, which was the time it took to fly from Beijing to Sanshan by Civil Air.

Besides, Xia ruofei did not waste the two hours. He entered the spirit map space to cultivate.

Xia ruofei skillfully maneuvered the flying boat through the Taixu xuanqing formation and steadily hovered above the roof of the Yanhuang building.

Naturally, Li Yifu had already sensed it when the swift Boat triggered the array at the outermost layer.

Hence, when Xia ruofei jumped off the airboat, he saw Li Yifu already waiting for him on the rooftop.

“Senior granduncle, you’re back!” Li Yifu said respectfully as he bowed.

Xia ruofei kept the shrunken flying boat into the spirit map space and nodded with a smile.””Yup! After I sent them home, I stayed in the capital for a night before flying back to Paradise Island early in the morning. Do you think it’s easy for me to give you this surprise?”

“Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu said. Your kindness in cultivating this disciple, this disciple will not be able to repay even if this disciple’s bones are crushed! It’s really the greatest fortune of this disciple’s life to be able to reunite with martial granduncle in this old age ...”

At this point, Li Yifu’s voice couldn’t help but choke up.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”no, no, no! Foster husband, I was just joking, why did you have to be so emotional? Go, go, go! Let’s go downstairs first, the wind is too strong on the rooftop!”

“Martial granduncle, do you want to go eat first?” Li Yifu said,”I’ll ask the chef in the cafeteria to cook a few of your signature dishes ...”

Xia ruofei quickly waved his hand and said,”I just had breakfast two hours ago. I really can’t eat anything now. Let’s go to my room first!” I just happen to have something to talk to you about!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu quickly replied.

The two of them came to the large suite on the top floor. After Li Yifu closed the door, he asked,””Martial granduncle, do you have any orders?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”I don’t have any orders. I just have something to give you!”

With that, Xia ruofei took out a flying sword and a crystal. With the support of his spiritual power, the flying sword and the crystal floated quietly.

Li Yifu’s eyes suddenly widened as he looked at the thing in front of him in disbelief. He stuttered,””Flying ... Flying sword? And these are origin crystals, right? This ... This is ... For me?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””These are all the gains from this auction. Now that I have quite a number of origin crystals on hand, I’ll leave one for you. This way, even if you leave the range of the Taixu xuanqing formation, you can still cultivate!”

“But ... But ... This is too precious ...” Li Yifu said.

“Don’t talk nonsense, quickly put away the origin crystals!” Xia ruofei did not allow for further explanation.”I still have to teach you how to control the flying sword!”

This was one of the five flying swords. It was black all over, and its blade was wider than Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s autumn water and Yiren. What they had in common was that they all exuded a sharp aura, as if the space around the flying sword was about to be cut apart.

This flying sword named “Black Gold” was also chosen by Xia ruofei to be given to Li Yifu.

This time, Xia ruofei had obtained a total of five flying swords in the nested space. Among the people close to Xia ruofei, there were only five people who had embarked on the path of cultivation. They were Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, Li Yifu, Tang Haoran, and Song Wei’s father, song Qiming.

Song Qiming’s cultivation level was too low. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had not told song Qiming about his cultivation. Naturally, he could not give him a flying sword.

On the other hand, Tang Haoran’s cultivation level was barely enough. The main reason was that he was too young and his mind was not mature yet. Xia ruofei naturally did not dare to hand over such a sharp flying sword to Tang Haoran.

Of course, Xia ruofei had also chosen a flying sword named “blazing flame” for Tang Haoran.

It was unknown what kind of rare ore was used to make this flying sword. It was dark red in color and constantly emitted a scorching aura. This was obviously the most suitable for Tang Haoran, who cultivated the Yang cultivation method. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, he could not give the flying sword to Tang Haoran now. At least when he was a little older, Xia ruofei would consider giving the “blazing flame” flying sword to Tang Haoran.

“This ...” Li Yifu hesitated for a long time before finally saying,”grand uncle – Master, I don’t dare to reject the elder’s gift, so I’ll shamelessly accept this crystal! But this flying swords.....Is indeed too precious. Martial granduncle, you should keep it for your own use! This disciple knows that you already have a flying sword, but it’s not bad to have another flying sword for self – defense!”

Xia ruofei said,”I’m giving you some cultivation resources now and you’re still haggling?” Oh! You take half and return half, do you think I’m giving you a bonus? Hurry up and put away the origin crystals. As expected, learn from me how to leave a spiritual imprint on a flying sword!”

Xia ruofei pretended to be angry so that Li Yifu did not dare to decline. He could only nod his head with tears in his eyes and said,””Thank you for your gift, grand uncle – Master!”

After he finished speaking, he was about to kneel down and pay his respects to Xia ruofei.

However, the Golden core stage cultivator’s reaction speed was very fast. Li Yifu’s knee had just bent and Xia ruofei immediately noticed it. He lifted his hand and Li Yifu realized that he could no longer kneel.

“I don’t like to kneel and worship!” Xia ruofei said,”adopted husband, I don’t want to criticize you, but we are all from the same line as immortal mountain river, right? If I’m the sect leader, then you’re the only disciple of my sect. If I don’t give these cultivation resources to you, who should I give them to? You called me martial granduncle, so I have the responsibility to do my best to cultivate you! You’re not allowed to decline any more cultivation resources in the future, understand?”

“Yes! Senior granduncle!” Li Yifu’s eyes were slightly red. He looked deeply at Xia ruofei and said,”I will remember this!”

“Come on!” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”keep this flying sword first! In the future, don’t reveal your flying sword so easily. Just let it rest in your dantian. First, he didn’t want to show his wealth! To avoid being noticed by people with ill intentions and causing trouble; Second, it’s to give you a trump card. If you encounter danger in the future, this flying sword might be a surprise weapon that can save your life!”
