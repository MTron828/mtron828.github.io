?2000 Murderous intent on a rainy night (1)

The taxi drove along the river. The rich District of Turin was on the other side of the river. The lights were beautiful and it was a peaceful scene.

However, the place was destined to be stained with the smell of blood tonight ...

After the taxi crossed the bridge, there were fewer people. Both sides of the road were filled with dense woods, and the villas were faintly visible among the trees. This place was backed by the Green Mountains and faced the river. From the top, one could see the distant Mount Perga, and from the bottom, one could have a bird’s eye view of the whole city. No wonder rich people were willing to live here.

The taxi stopped about a hundred meters away from the villa area. There were guards on guard further ahead. The inside was a private road, and the taxi driver was not allowed to enter, unless the person taking the taxi was an owner.

Obviously, Xia ruofei was not a resident, so he had told the driver to stop when they were about to reach the periphery of the villa area.

Xia ruofei paid the fare and gave an extra 5 euros as a tip according to international practice. Then, he asked the driver to turn around and leave.

After the car disappeared around the corner, Xia ruofei’s figure flashed and disappeared into the dense forest ...

A villa deep in the residential area was brightly lit, and many people were singing to their hearts ‘content on the grass in the courtyard.

There was a white man sitting by the pool. He was about 30 years old. His golden hair was tied up, and his eye sockets were deep. He had the typical Mediterranean look. There was a deep murderous aura in his eyes. In addition, there was an eye – catching scar on his face that extended from the corner of his eye to the corner of his mouth, making him look even more ferocious.

The white man was wearing a tight – fitting vest, and his exposed thick arms were covered in tattoos. His thick chest hair was also exposed, and he looked very tough at first glance.

He was holding a wine glass in his hand, and as he swirled it, he looked at the girls in the courtyard who were twisting their bodies to the music, and a lecherous light flashed in his eyes.

Hey! The white man shouted. Lorie! Didn’t you say that girl would be coming over tonight Where is he

A red – haired white young man quickly ran over and said,Toles, I’ve already made a call to confirm. Old Grasso personally promised that he would send that girl over tonight! He should be on his way now!

The white man with a knife scar on his face was Toles. He spat on the ground and said,Why are you dilly – dallying! Is following me, Toles, an embarrassing thing

The red – haired white young man, Lorie, smiled and said,Toles, it’s her honor that you’re interested in her! She’ll understand soon ... Hehe ...

Toles glanced at Lorie and asked,Hey! Do you have any thoughts about her

No, no! Lorie quickly laughed.

Toles pouted and said,anyone would have thoughts when they see such a stunner, unless they’re a guy without balls! Don’t worry! When I’m done playing with her, she’ll be yours!

Lorie quickly said,thank you! Thank you!

He muttered in his heart, when you’re tired of her ... Will that girl still be alive It wasn’t the first time ...

Even if he was given a hundred guts, he would not dare to say such a thought out loud. He could only silently criticize it.

The Gelman family was now at the top of the pyramid in Turin, and Toles was the best fighter in the family. He had made a great contribution by helping the family expand their territory in Turin.

This villa was given to Toles by the head of the Gehrman family.

The villa in the wealthy District of Turin cost about 4000 euros per square meter. If Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, and the others were here, they would have scoffed at the price. It was too cheap compared to the 100000 – Yuan house price in Beijing.

However, in Turin, it was indeed one of the best mansions.

Toles pouted and said,Lori, go and make another call! Where’s that girl I don’t have the patience to wait forever!

Alright, please wait a moment! Lorie quickly ran to the side to make a call.

......

At the place where Xia ruofei had just alighted, a black Mercedes – Benz quietly drove to the entrance of the residential area.

The security guards reached out to stop the car. The driver stuck his head out and said a few words to them. The security guards immediately contacted them through the walkie – talkie and then waved to let them through.

After the Mercedes – Benz entered the residential area, it drove toward Toles ‘villa.

A middle – aged white man with a cold expression sat in the front passenger seat. He turned back to look at the person in the back seat from time to time, giving him a hint of warning. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Monica was sitting in the back seat.

She had obviously been carefully dressed up. She was wearing a strapless evening dress, which revealed her curvaceous figure. She also had exquisite light makeup on her face, but her face didn’t look too good, and her expression revealed deep despair.

Today was the day her family gave her an ultimatum. She could either agree to sacrifice herself for the family and become Toles ‘woman; Otherwise, they would be expelled from the family.

To be honest, Monica was not afraid of being expelled from the Grasso family. She even felt that it was a form of relief. She no longer had any feelings for this family that had no human feelings.

However, she was not alone.

Although her grandfather who loved her, her strict father, and her loving mother had all passed away, she still had a brother.

He was a beautiful 18 – year – old boy, but unfortunately, he had severe polio when he was young and had been unable to leave the wheelchair since.
