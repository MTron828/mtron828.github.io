Chapter 796: Buying vegetable seeds (2)

Seeing the two of them walking down the stairs, Lin Qiao immediately greeted them with a smile,””Brother ruofei, sister – in – Law, you’re up!”

Ling Qingxue’s face turned red and she rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was thick – skinned and chuckled. “Qiao’ er, I’ll send your sister – in – Law back to the city. I’ll just eat something outside later. Don’t wait for me to have dinner. ”

“Oh, I know!” Lin Qiao said. Then, she looked at Ling Qingxue and asked,”sister – in – Law, don’t be in such a hurry to go back! I might as well stay here today ...”

Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”I still have things to do at the company!” Qiao’ er, I’ll come and visit you again when I’m free!”

Lin Qiao nodded and said,”yes!” If you’re here to see someone, you can just drop by to see me ...”

“You little girl ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

Ling Qingxue bade farewell to Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao, then followed Xia ruofei out of the villa.

Xia ruofei brought Ling Qingxue to the side of the pickup truck. Ling Qingxue furrowed her brows and said,””Oh right, my car is still parked at your office building ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and put his arm around Ling Qingxue’s shoulder.””Just throw it there! Give me a call when you’re free in two days. I’ll drive to the city to pick you up, and then you can drive back by yourself!”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei with a half – Smile and said,””You’re trying to play dirty again, right?”

Xia ruofei chuckled,”yeah!” The environment of the office is indeed better than the bedroom ... Wife, I think the environment of the orchard in the back mountain is even better. Next time, why don’t ...”

Ling Qingxue’s face paled. She covered her ears and said,””Scoundrel! I don’t want to listen, I don’t want to listen ...”

......

Xia ruofei laughed heartily, opened the car door, and got in.

Ling Qingxue then rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and walked to the other side of the car.

Xia ruofei drove Ling Qingxue back to the city. He had wanted to send her home directly, but Ling Qingxue saw that there was still some time, so she let Xia ruofei send her back to the company. She had some urgent business to deal with today, and then she would go home with Ling Xiaotian.

After dropping Ling Qingxue off at the lingji F & B headquarters, Xia ruofei did not get out of the car. He waved goodbye to Ling Qingxue in the car and watched her walk into the building.

Then, Xia ruofei took out his phone and dialed Feng Rao’s number.

The phone rang twice before Feng Jing picked it up.””Chairman ...”

Her voice seemed to be trembling a little, and she seemed to be a little flustered.

Xia ruofei asked curiously,”CEO Feng, are you feeling unwell?” Your voice sounds weird ...”

Feng Rao thought to herself,”this guy is the one who’s acting preposterous, I didn’t eavesdrop on him. Why should I feel guilty?”

With that thought, Feng Jing’s voice returned to normal.””Oh ... I’m fine! Chairman, what’s the matter?”

Xia ruofei felt a little strange, but he could not figure out what was wrong, so he decided not to think about it.

“You mentioned in the morning that the problem of seeds needs to be solved urgently,” he asked.”Has old Cao calculated the required amount yet?”

“Oh ... He sent it to me as soon as he got to work this afternoon.” Feng Rao said,”he’s probably anxious too.”

“Then send it to me!” Xia ruofei said. He thought for a while and said,”if you don’t have an electronic version, just take a photo and send it to my WeChat.”

“Alright,” he said. Feng ke said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You’re really fine?” Xia ruofei could not help but ask.

“What are you talking about? what could happen to me?” Feng Jing couldn’t help but complain to herself. She then continued,”didn’t you just see me this morning?”

“It’s good that you’re fine. ” Xia ruofei said,”thank you. Send it to me immediately!”

Since Feng Jing didn’t want to say anything, Xia ruofei didn’t ask further. After all, she was a girl. What if she was feeling a little unwell because of her ‘relative’? It would be awkward if he asked too many questions.

“Alright,” he said.

Not long after he hung up, Xia ruofei’s phone rang with a WeChat notification. Feng Rao had sent him the seed requirement form that Cao tieshu had made.

Xia ruofei replied with a shaking hand emoji on WeChat. Then, he opened his contact list and dialed the number of the seed company’s manager.

He often bought seeds from the seed company in large quantities, so he was considered a big customer of the seed company. He had exchanged contact information with the manager.

Xia ruofei told the manager about the seeds he wanted to buy and told him the approximate amount.

Coincidentally, the seed company had just received a batch of seeds yesterday, so there was an abundant supply. When the manager heard that Xia ruofei wanted to buy such a large number of seeds, he was very happy and very enthusiastic. He even said that he could deliver the seeds to their doorsteps.

Hence, Xia ruofei sent the request form that Feng Jing had just sent over to the manager of the seed company through WeChat. He also sent the address of the small warehouse that he had rented in the city.

The manager immediately said that he would organize his staff to transfer the goods to the warehouse and that the goods would be delivered before Sixo’ clock this afternoon.

Xia ruofei looked at his watch. There was still enough time, so he started the pickup truck and left the Ling’s F & B headquarters. He found a restaurant nearby and ordered a few simple dishes for dinner.

It was only about FiveO’ clock, not yet the peak hour for dinner, so there were not many customers in the restaurant, and the dishes were served very quickly.

After Xia ruofei finished his meal, he drove straight to the warehouse.

It had been a long time since he last came to this warehouse. There was a faint moldy smell. Xia ruofei opened the door to let in some air. Then, he took out a picnic chair from his space and sat at the entrance of the warehouse. He lit a cigarette and started smoking.

After a while, he received a call from the manager of the seed company. The delivery car had arrived nearby. In order to show his importance, the manager also came in person.

Hence, Xia ruofei shared the location with the manager through WeChat.

Soon, a small truck drove over, and two workers deftly unloaded the bags of seeds that had been sorted and packaged and moved them into the warehouse.

Xia ruofei and the manager were smoking and chatting at the side. After unloading the goods, Xia ruofei counted the quantity and opened two bags of seeds at random to check. Then, he paid with his card.

After sending off the seed company, Xia ruofei closed the warehouse door. Then, with a thought, he kept all the seeds into the spirit map space.

Then, Xia ruofei let Blackie, fluffy one, and fluffy two out of the medium. After the last mission, Xia ruofei had temporarily sent Blackie back into the medium.

Now that the farm’s expansion project had been completed and the area had expanded a lot, it was time for Blackie and the others to live in the outside world. After all, they had been staying in the spirit map space all year round. Although the spiritual Qi was rich, it was too lonely. After all, these dogs had gained spiritual intelligence.

Walking out of the warehouse, Xia ruofei opened the back of the pickup truck. With a wave of his hand, xiaohei jumped in first. Fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest also scrambled to get in.

Xia ruofei closed the door and smiled.””Let’s go! I’ll take you to your new home!”

With that, Xia ruofei turned around and locked the warehouse door. Then, he returned to the pickup truck.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to start the car, there was a sudden shout from the intersection ahead. Then, two figures ran in Xia ruofei’s direction.

The person running in front was panting heavily. It was obvious that he had already run quite a distance.

When Xia ruofei’s eyes fell on the person who was chasing after him, he could not help but freeze.
