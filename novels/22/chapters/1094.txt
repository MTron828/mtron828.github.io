The influence of the two in the entertainment industry was like heaven and earth.

In her excitement, Feng Rao had forgotten that Jennifer was still waiting for her answer. She just stood there in a daze, her eyes full of disbelief.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but gently touch Feng Jing’s shoulder and said,””Boss Feng, what are you daydreaming about? Jennifer is asking you a question ...”

Feng Rao came back to her senses and quickly said, “I’m willing! Of course I’m willing! Jennifer ... You ... You’re not joking with me, are you?”

Jennifer pursed her lips and smiled,”Feng, why would I tease you for no reason?” Xia is our best friend. If his company needs our help, of course we have to give it our all!”

Tang Yitian also smiled and said,””Yup! Originally, Jennifer was going to endorse you personally, but RUO Fei firmly refused. It just so happened that Duff came to China with us this time, so Jennifer recommended her to you!”

Xia ruofei was touched. He looked at Tang Yitian and Jennifer and said,””Big brother Tang, sister – in – Law, thank you!”

“Ruofei, you’re treating me like an outsider?” Tang Yitian pretended to be angry.

“No, no!” Xia ruofei smiled.”But I really have to thank you for this! President Feng has been so anxious that he can’t sleep these two days ...”

Tang Yitian suddenly laughed,”how do you know that President Feng can’t sleep?” Ruofei, could it be that last night, you guys ...”

Xia ruofei was speechless, and Feng Rao didn’t expect that Tang Yitian, a super – rich man, would make such a joke about his lack of respect for his elders. She couldn’t help but blush.

She quickly changed the topic and asked,”Jennifer, you just said that miss Dave is here to attend the press conference of” the angel of doom “?” Does that mean she’s going to act in this movie?”

Jennifer smiled and nodded.”Duff is the female lead for this movie. In fact, we hired a gold – medal screenwriter from Hollywood to tailor this movie according to Duff’s temperament and characteristics!”

Xia ruofei and the others were conversing in Chinese, so Duff could not understand them at all. She just stood at the side with a smile.

Jennifer had told her about the brand endorsement last night. According to her own thoughts, this kind of unknown small company was definitely not within her consideration. It was impossible to move her no matter how much money was given.

But Jennifer was her boss, and in order to make her famous, she was not stingy with the company’s resources. And last night, Jennifer didn’t hide it from her and told her that the boss of the Paradise company was a very good friend of Tang Yitian.

Thus, Duff agreed without hesitation.

Although she didn’t understand what they were talking about, she didn’t dare to look down on this small company when she saw Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian talking and laughing.

After hearing Jennifer’s words, Feng Rao could not help but ask,””Since miss Duff is going to star in ‘the angel of doom,’ will there be any conflicts in the timing?”

Jennifer smiled and said,”the crew of ‘the angel of doom’ is not fully prepared yet. It may take some time for all the staff and equipment to be in place. We’ll start shooting in Beijing in five days. Time is a little tight.”

“That’s enough!”Feng Rao quickly said. We only need miss Dave to cooperate with us to shoot a short advertisement and a few posters. We’ve already finished the script and other things. I’ll gather the people immediately. It should be no problem to finish it in five days. ”

Jennifer nodded and said,”Feng, if your short film isn’t complicated, why don’t I ask the crew of” the angel of doom “to send a few people to help you?” Their staff and equipment are more professional ...”

“Ah? This ... How can I accept this?” Feng Rao said hesitantly.

Feng Jing’s plan was to find a small studio to film it. This kind of short advertisement was mainly about creativity. The shooting techniques and special effects didn’t need to be too high – end.

Of course, Jennifer’s proposal to get the crew of “the angel of doom” to come over and help also made Feng Rao’s heart beat faster.

That was a Hollywood team they were talking about! One of their video cameras might be worth more than an entire studio. Moreover, these people were all experts in post – production and special effects.

If he could get their help, he would be able to perfectly realize the idea in the advertisement script. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It’s okay,” Jennifer said with a smile.”They’ve been resting for the past few days. It won’t be a problem for them to help you with a small task! Feng, let me arrange it!”

“Thank you!” Feng Rao said gratefully. Jennifer!”

The service was really on point! Not only did they find a star to endorse their products, but they also found a photography team and a post – production team, all of which were first – Class!

Feng Jing had a more direct understanding of Xia ruofei’s position in the Tang couple’s hearts.

“You’re welcome. We’re very happy to be able to do something for Xia’s company!” Jennifer said.

Feng Rao was so overjoyed that she almost lost her sense of direction. Meanwhile, Duff had been standing at the side with a dumbfounded expression, not knowing what Jennifer and Feng Rao were talking about.

Seeing this, Xia ruofei smiled and said to Duff in English,””Miss Duff, thank you very much for being our company’s brand ambassador. Our company’s products will definitely not disappoint you! In the future, you’ll realize that this endorsement is definitely a win – win choice!”

Duff didn’t think much of it. She had never even heard of a company’s name. How good could their products be? She would thank the heavens if she didn’t ruin her reputation.

However, Xia ruofei and Tang Yitian had a good relationship, so she didn’t dare to neglect him. She quickly showed an elegant smile and said,””Mr. Xia, it’s my honor!”

“Then ... Let’s talk about the endorsement fee!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Dave froze for a moment and repeated subconsciously,””Endorsement fee?”

Could it be that there was still money to be earned? Isn’t this a friendly help to the boss’s friend?

Tang Yitian immediately pulled a long face.””RUO Fei, what’s with the endorsement fee? I’m helping you out, how can I ask you for money? Aren’t you slapping my face?”

Jennifer immediately said,”Xia, Duff’s endorsement this time is free!” We can’t take your money!”

Feng Jing’s jaw dropped. She had never even imagined that they would be able to get a superstar like Duff to endorse their products, yet they didn’t even plan to charge them?

Feng Jing had already prepared herself mentally for the endorsement fee to be doubled or even doubled. She was worried that Xia ruofei did not know the value of Duff and was thinking about how to get as much money as possible from Xia ruofei after they came down!

He didn’t expect that Tang Yitian and the others didn’t take the money at all!

Xia ruofei quickly said,”big brother Tang, sister – in – Law, this ... Is business!” We still have to pay for the expenses. Besides ... If miss Duff were to endorse another company, she would also benefit from it! She won’t be able to take on similar advertisements while she’s our spokesperson. This is a huge loss for her!”

Tang Yitian snorted and said,”of course I thought of that. Our company will compensate her for her losses!” You don’t have to worry about it ...”

“How can we do that?”

“Ruofei, if you insist on paying, I won’t recognize you as my brother anymore! “Just pretend I didn’t say anything about the endorsement. We’ll take Daphne away now ...” Tang Yitian pretended to be angry.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no, no, no!” If you don’t want to give it, then don’t give it! Big brother Tang, don’t be angry ...”

He was very touched. On second thought, the jaded skin cream was destined to become a phenomenal product that would take the world by storm in the future. It would not be a problem for it to compete with the major luxury brands. From this perspective, it would be beneficial for Duff to endorse the jaded skin cream.

Moreover, Tang Yitian had already said that, so Xia ruofei didn’t insist on paying.

Tang Yitian’s anger immediately turned into joy.””Now this is more like it!”
