Chapter 25: Let’s Leave Together

“What… what do you want?” Zhong Qiang was so frightened that he couldn’t even hold his machete properly. It fell to the ground with a clang.

He backed away, putting on a brave face and shouting.

“Don’t come near me! My uncle is the deputy director of the police station. If you dare touch me, you’re dead!”

Xia Ruofei did not even blink as he walked towards Zhong Qiang unhurriedly.

Although Xia Ruofei did not take any actions and only walked towards Zhong Qiang step by step, Zhong Qiang felt a great pressure.

He still felt like he was dreaming. He couldn’t even believe his eyes.

Why were the dozen or so people he had brought all taken down in less than a minute? They were all armed. Whereas this fellow was unarmed!

He’s… practically a monster!

Zhong Qiang finally couldn’t take the pressure anymore. He shouted and turned around to run out of the door. As for those dozen or so lackeys, he had no time to care about them!

Xia Ruofei snorted coldly and took a few steps forward with a flying kick. Zhong Qiang immediately flew up and fell to the ground. His teeth hit the door frame and two of his front teeth were knocked out. He cried out in pain.

Xia Ruofei walked forward and easily picked Zhong Qiang up with one hand. There was no emotion in his eyes as he said indifferently.

“What did you just say? The soldier’s families are nothing? And you wanted to beat up Hu Zi?”

“Big Brother… I was wrong… I was blind… Please spare me!” Zhong Qiang was in pain and afraid. He could not help but cry.

Tears mixed with the blood in his mouth, and he looked extremely sorry.

Xia Ruofei looked at the sobbing Zhong Qiang in disgust. A cold glint flashed across his eyes and he slapped him as fast as lightning for more than 10 times. Then, he let go and Zhong Qiang immediately sat on the ground.

Xia Ruofei’s attack was extremely strong. Almost all of Zhong Qiang’s teeth had been knocked out, and both his cheeks were swelling up at a visible speed. His entire face looked like a pig’s head, and it was very miserable.

“Take your men and disappear!” Xia Ruofei said calmly. “If this happens again, it won’t be just this!”

“Ye ye ye… We’ll get out of here right away…” Zhong Qiang spoke through his missing teeth.

He and the dozen or so hooligans supported each other and disappeared from Xia Ruofei and Lin Qiao’s sight.

“Brother Ruofei! You’re amazing!” Lin Qiao’s eyes lit up as she looked up at Xia Ruofei.

There was clear admiration in her eyes.

Xia Ruofei smiled faintly and said.

“They are just a few hooligans. Your brother and I even arrested vicious international drug dealers back then!”

When Xia Ruofei said this, his voice suddenly paused. He and Lin Qiao both looked sad. They naturally thought of Hu Zi who had lost his life again.

Sadness flashed across Lin Qiao’s eyes. She bit her lower lip gently and forced a smile.

“Brother Ruofei, let’s go in! My mother must still be worried!”

The two of them returned to the house. As expected, Hu Zi’s mother was sitting by the bed anxiously. When she saw the two of them enter, she quickly asked.

“How is it? I thought I heard a fight outside. Are you hurt, Ruofei?”

Before Xia Ruofei could speak, Lin Qiao smiled and said.

“Mom! Brother Ruofei is amazing! You didn’t see it just now. Brother Ruofei fought more than ten of them alone and defeated everyone in two or three moves. Zhong Qiang was beaten up by Brother Ruofei!”

Lin Qiao had been harassed by Zhong Qiang a lot these days. Today, when she saw Xia Ruofei beating up Zhong Qiang, she felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction.

Hu Zi’s mother’s face fell. She said.

“Ruofei, did you hit Zhong Qiang again?”

Xia Ruofei nodded and said.

“Auntie, I didn’t want to attack him. It’s just that these people were too nasty with their words. It’s really too detestable. Besides, they were the ones who attacked first…”

“What should we do…” Hu Zi’s mother looked anxious and said,” Ruofei, leave quickly! Leave Little Island Village. Zhong Qiang’s family is very powerful. Us commoners can’t afford to offend him…”

At this moment, Lin Qiao also realized the seriousness of the problem and quickly said.

“Yes, yes, yes. Brother Ruofei, leave quickly! As long as you leave Little Island Village and Changping County, no matter how powerful Zhong Qiang is, he can’t do anything to you!”

She pushed Xia Ruofei towards the door as she spoke.

Xia Ruofei smiled wryly, then frowned slightly.

The beating just now was satisfying, but the aftereffects did not seem to be insignificant.

Of course he couldn’t just walk away.

After he left, only Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao were left. If Zhong Qiang came to take revenge, the two of them would not be able to resist at all.

Hu Zi was no longer around, and he had sacrificed himself to save him. How could he abandon the two of them and leave?

Xia Ruofei thought for a moment and said.

“Auntie, Lin Qiao, why don’t the two of you come with me? Let’s go to Three Mountain City and stay there for a few days. We’ll talk about the rest later.”

Hu Zi’s mother said.

“Ruofei, stop caring about us! Auntie has lived in this village for decades. Everyone is our neighbors. As long as you’re not here, the Zhong family can’t do anything to me.”

Lin Qiao’s expression changed slightly. Her mouth opened, but she did not say anything.

How could Xia Ruofei not know that Hu Zi’s mother was comforting him? With Zhong Qiang’s personality, if he left, the two of them would definitely be in trouble.

Therefore, Xia Ruofei said.

“Auntie, if you don’t leave with me, I won’t leave either. I’ll stay here and wait! Let’s see what that Zhong Qiang can do!”

“You…” Hu Zi’s mother did not expect Xia Ruofei to be so stubborn. “Why is this child so disobedient?”

Xia Ruofei looked carefree as he found a chair and sat down.

“Auntie, if you want me to leave, let’s leave together. If you want to stay, I’ll stay together. Do as you see fit…”

Hu Zi’s mother looked anxious. She knew that it would be too late if she delayed any longer. Over the years, Zhong Qiang had been running rampant in the countryside. She knew his methods very well. No matter how good Xia Ruofei was, he would still suffer if he encountered the family of officials.

In the end, Hu Zi’s mother gave in reluctantly.

“Alright… then let’s go together… Ruofei, hurry up, or it’ll be too late!”

Xia Ruofei grinned and said.

“That’s right! Auntie, you need to go to Three Mountain City for further treatment anyway! Let’s go!”

Lin Qiao also looked relieved. Clearly, she had her reservations about staying. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“There’s no need to pack anything! Just buy new ones in Three Mountain City!” Xia Ruofei said. “Qiao’er, help Auntie over. I’ll carry her!”

Soon, Xia Ruofei carried Hu Zi’s mother out the door while Lin Qiao followed closely behind them.

As for the courtyard door, it had long been broken by Zhong Qiang and the others. In addition, there was nothing valuable at home, so they did not bother about it.

To return to the city, they had to go to the county road at the entrance of the village to get a taxi, so Xia Ruofei carried Hu Zi’s mother and led Lin Qiao straight to the road outside the village.

However, after the three of them arrived at the village entrance, they waited for more than ten minutes but did not see a passing bus.

At this moment, Xia Ruofei heard the sound of sirens approaching. Soon, he saw a police car arriving at the village entrance.

Seeing three or four people in police uniform getting out of the car and running straight towards him, Xia Ruofei could not help but frown…
