After a long time, everything calmed down. Even the water that had been stirred by the giant python had returned to its calm state.

Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down. He continued to control the blue immortal sword and slashed at the giant python a few times. The purple – blooded spirit Python did not move at all. It seemed to be completely dead. One of the slashes had almost cut off the snake’s head. If the giant python was pretending to be dead, then its acting was really good.

With a thought, Xia ruofei appeared in the outside world.

Without touching the water, he tapped lightly on the corpse of the purpleblood spirit Python and flipped over to the shore of the pool. At the same time, he waved his hand, and the blue immortal sword and the spirit map scroll floated in front of him.

At first, Xia ruofei wanted to take a bucket of clean water from the spirit map space to wash them away. The pool outside had been dyed purple by the snake’s blood, so it was useless.

However, with a glance, he found that the immortal sword and the spirit map were not stained by a trace of filth, not even a drop of water. So he directly put them into his body with a thought.

Xia ruofei sat down on the grass beside the pond and looked at the motionless corpse of the purpleblood spirit Python. He felt as if he had just survived a disaster.

He used his mind to communicate with Xia Qing, who was in the space,””Xia Qing, I’ve killed a purpleblood spirit Python. Is its corpse of any value?”

“Master, what’s the cultivation level of this purple – blooded spiritual Python?” asked Xia Qing.

“At least the Golden core stage, I guess!” Xia ruofei replied casually.

Xia Qing couldn’t help but exclaim,”golden core stage! Master, a golden core purple – blooded spiritual Python is very powerful. You were actually able to kill it!”

Xia Qing was aware of Xia ruofei’s cultivation. Even if Xia ruofei’s cultivation technique was more powerful and he could challenge those of a higher level, this was still too many levels ...

“I’m lucky!”Xia ruofei laughed.

“Master, the corpse of the purpleblood spirit Python is still very valuable,” said Xia Qing quickly. “The most precious thing is its golden core! This was the energy essence that it had cultivated for many years. Also, the gallbladder of a golden core purple blood spirit Python also had high medicinal value. In addition, the snakeskin is very strong, it can ...”

Xia Qing suddenly stopped. As Xia ruofei had already kept the entire corpse of the purple – blooded spiritual Python into the medium, Xia Qing saw that the purple – blooded spiritual Python was riddled with holes. She knew that there was no need to say anything more about the use of the skin.

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed.”This beast is very lethal. I was afraid that it wasn’t completely dead, so I stabbed it a few more times. This snake skin is probably useless now ...”

“With this degree of damage, if it was stabbed at a vital part, it would have been killed with one strike ...” Xia Qing said with a bitter smile.

At that time, Xia ruofei could not care about his vitals. In any case, he just had to fight to the death. It was just a piece of snakeskin that was destroyed, so he had nothing to feel bad about.

“Xia Qing, I’ll take its golden core and gallbladder first!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

With that, Xia ruofei summoned the blue immortal sword from his body and cut open the purple – blooded spiritual Python’s stomach.

After the death of the purple – blooded spiritual Python, the defensive power of its outer skin seemed to have dropped a lot. In addition, the blue immortal sword was extremely sharp, so Xia ruofei did not have to spend much effort to cut it open.

He quickly found a fresh snake gall in the snake’s stomach. This snake gall was at least ten to twenty times bigger than the ones Xia ruofei had seen on the internet.

Then, with Xia Qing’s help, he found a golden core.

The Golden core of the purple – blooded spiritual Python was as big as a volleyball. Xia ruofei could sense that it was formed by pure energy. He felt his heart palpitate when he held it in his hand as if it would explode if he was not careful.

Xia ruofei didn’t really care about the snake galls. He asked,””Xia Qing, what use does this golden core have for me?”

“Master, you’re cultivating the” great Dao Arts. “This golden core can be directly refined and absorbed!” Xia Qing said with a smile,”the biggest feature of the ‘great Dao Arts’ is that it is close to the origin. The closer it is to the origin, the more inclusive it is. Therefore, even if master is in a harsh environment outside, his cultivation speed will still be much faster than ordinary cultivators ...”

Xia ruofei nodded his head slightly. He had already realized that regardless of whether it was the “scorching sun Scripture” that he had passed on to his disciple Tang Haoran or the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” that he had passed on to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, they were all superior cultivation techniques. However, the cultivation speed of these two cultivation techniques was still far inferior to the “great Dao Arts”.

Even in the combined state, the cultivation speed of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” would be hard to catch up with the “great Dao Sutra”.

Xia Qing continued,”this golden core is the essence of energy that the purpleblood spirit Python has accumulated over countless years. If it were a cultivator who had cultivated other cultivation techniques, they might not be able to absorb the energy directly because the energy was too large and pure, or because the attributes were not compatible. However, master has cultivated the” great Dao technique “, so there is no such problem at all. You can just treat it as a spirit crystal or origin crystal. Moreover, the cultivation efficiency will far exceed that of origin crystals!”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei nodded.

He wrapped this golden core with an invisible spatial force and sent it into the small cave. For the time being, he didn’t intend to absorb the Golden core to cultivate. After all, he was still thinking about the survivors of the shipwreck outside and didn’t know if anyone could survive.

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, this snake gallbladder ... I suggest you use it to brew wine. There are many good wines at the Archean realm. If you use this snake gallbladder together with some medicinal herbs, you can brew a very good medicinal wine!”
