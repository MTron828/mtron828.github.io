Chapter 1849: Grand uncle-master’s generous gift (1)

Translator: 549690339

Hearing this, Li Yifu immediately motioned for the accompanying flight crew to leave first without hesitation. Even yang Wanxin, who was boarding the plane with him, was asked to leave temporarily.

Seeing this, Ling Qingxue stood up after Yang Wanxin and the flight crew got off the plane.

Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand and asked,””Qingxue, where are you going?”

“Didn’t you want to talk to ... Your adopted husband alone?”Ling Qingxue asked.

Ling Qingxue felt a little awkward when an 80 – year – old man called her by her name.

Xia ruofei laughed,”silly girl!” I’m asking those unrelated people to leave, why are you leaving? Do I need to carry you when I’m talking to my adopted husband?”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”who knows?” What if it’s a secret of your sect?”

Even though she said that, she was still very happy that Xia ruofei asked her to stay, so she sat back down.

“Senior granduncle, do you have any orders?” Li Yifu asked respectfully.

Xia ruofei sighed and said,””Foster husband, I’ll accept your gift ...”

Li Yifu was overjoyed when he heard this.

Xia ruofei did not wait for him to speak. He waved his hand and said,””Let me finish ... I’ll take this plane, but I’ve also prepared a small gift for you ...”

Li Yifu quickly said,”Grand – uncle, you’ve already given me a very precious gift in Australia. I don’t deserve it. I don’t dare to accept another gift from you!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Xia ruofei smiled.”I didn’t even say what I’m giving you. How do you know it’s a ‘generous gift’?”

Li Yifu smiled awkwardly but did not answer Xia ruofei.

Although he was very respectful in front of Xia ruofei and always regarded himself as a junior in the sect, he was still an 80 – year – old man with a lot of experience in life. How could he not see Xia ruofei’s intention?

Therefore, Li Yifu knew that his senior granduncle felt that the plane he had given him was too expensive, so he wanted to give him a gift in return.

As for the Grand uncle-master’s gift, it was most likely related to cultivation. Furthermore, it was a return gift for a top – notch public jet, so the value of the gift was naturally not low.

Therefore, before Xia ruofei could finish his sentence, Li Yifu quickly declined.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you haven’t seen my gift yet!” Don’t be in such a hurry to reject me. ”

Xia ruofei then took out a diamond – shaped crystal from his pocket and handed it to Li Yifu with a smile.

Seeing this, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Eh? RUO Fei, isn’t this the thing you’ve been holding in your hand when we were cultivating?”

“Master granduncle, this is ...” Li Yifu looked at the ‘diamond – shaped crystal’ in Xia ruofei’s hand and was stunned. Then, his eyes widened and he cried out,”spiritual crystal!” It’s a spirit crystal!”

Seeing that Li Yifu could recognize the crystals, Xia ruofei didn’t need to waste his breath. He smiled and asked,””Foster husband, do you still want to reject this gift?”

Xia ruofei was well aware of the importance of spirit Qi to a cultivator in the current cultivation environment on earth. Last time in Australia, he had only given Li Yifu a spirit – gathering Jade sculpture on behalf of Tang Haoran, and Li Yifu had almost cried with joy.

The spirit – gathering Jade statue could indeed speed up Li Yifu’s cultivation, but with his current cultivation, the spirit Qi gathered was obviously not enough for his cultivation.

Spiritual crystals were different. Each spiritual crystal contained a huge amount of spiritual Qi. To Qi refining stage cultivators, it was an inexhaustible guarantee. Xia ruofei felt that even if he were in Li Yifu’s position, he would find it extremely difficult to refuse such a huge temptation.

In fact, as Xia ruofei got to know Li Yifu better and his usual behavior, he had already accepted this junior of his sect. Giving him a spiritual crystal was not just because he felt it was inappropriate to accept such a big gift like a private plane.

Perhaps Xia ruofei did not dare to hand over the original origin returning Sutra to Li Yifu, but as an elder, it was not a big deal to reward a junior with a spiritual crystal.

After all, Li Yifu was already so old. If he wanted to make some progress in his cultivation, it might be difficult to follow the prescribed order in his cultivation. He still had to rely on some external help.

What Xia ruofei did not expect was that Li Yifu did not hesitate at all in the face of such temptation. He was stunned because he could not believe that Xia ruofei had taken out the legendary and precious spiritual crystal. His mind went blank for a short while.

Li Yifu said directly,”grand uncle – Master, how can I have such precious cultivation resources?” Please withdraw your order, martial granduncle!”

Li Yifu’s answer was very firm, which stunned Xia ruofei. He asked,””Foster husband, since you’ve recognized this as a spirit crystal, you should know what it means to you, right?”

“I know!” Li Yifu nodded and said. With a spirit crystal, at least before I reach Foundation establishment, I won’t have to worry about the lack of spiritual energy, and my cultivation speed will more than double. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”You’re already so old. If you have a spiritual crystal, you’ll still have a chance to build your foundation in your lifetime. If you don ‘t, then forgive me for being blunt. Even if you find the original copy of the Guiyuan Scripture, the hope is slim.” Have you really thought it through? do you not want this gift?”
