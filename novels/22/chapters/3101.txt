3102 Returning to the three mountains (2)

Other than that, he still had some things to do.

This included teaching the “nichang Heart Sutra” that he had carefully selected to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue. In addition, since the wild tea had already been proven to be effective, he naturally wanted to make use of this opportunity to give Song Wei’s father, song Qiming, a taste of it.

Although song Qiming’s cultivation level was low, Xia ruofei hoped that he could improve his cultivation as fast as possible. After all, song Qiming was not young anymore. Xia ruofei was confident that he would encounter a greater bottleneck in the future. He would have better resources to help song Qiming continue to break through.

Therefore, the use of wild tea could not be delayed.

Other than these matters, Xia ruofei had not returned to the company for a long time. Although he had put most of his attention on cultivation, he had founded the company himself. Even though he was getting less and less interested in worldly wealth, he still had a special feeling for paradise Corporation. Hence, he decided to go back to the company and take a look at how Feng Jing and the others were doing and if they needed his help.

Xia ruofei controlled the flying boat and flew directly in the direction of the capital.

As they neared the capital, Xia ruofei lowered his altitude. He maintained an altitude of 30 to 40 meters at a secluded location in the suburbs. Then, he took out his phone and contacted Song Wei.

“Weiwei, are you in Beijing?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Of course! It’s not winter or summer break yet, so a good student like me is naturally in school. ” Song Wei smiled and asked,”did you come back to China?”

In the past, even with a private jet, it took more than ten hours to fly from Paradise Island to China. Moreover, they had to land to refuel on the way, so the return trip was not particularly convenient.

Ever since he had the black flying boat, he could return to China from Paradise Island in just over two hours, which was much more convenient.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re right!” And I’m already in the capital!”

“Ah?” “Really?” Song Wei exclaimed in surprise.

“It’s not true?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Weiwei, are you free to take a leave of absence for the next two days?”

“Did something good happen again?” Song Wei asked with a smile. Could it be that it can help one’s cultivation break through to another level?”

“Do you think cultivation is like eating and drinking?!” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”I just want to bring you back to the three mountains!”

“Return to the three mountains?” Song Wei asked curiously,”why did you suddenly think of bringing me back to the three mountains?”

“Two things!” Xia ruofei smiled mysteriously and said,”but I want to tell you when we meet. Just tell me if you can take a leave of absence for the next two days!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“You’re keeping me in suspense again!” Song Wei said coyly, but she quickly replied,”of course, it’s okay to take leave. There are fewer courses for postgraduate students, and our boss is very easy to talk to!”

“Then it’s a deal!” Xia ruofei said happily,”hurry up and take the day off. I’ll come and pick you up!” By the way, what’s your position?”

“Same old place!” Song Wei laughed.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he laughed.”Library? You really are a good student ... No problem! I’ll be waiting for you on the rooftop of the library!”

“I won’t leave until we meet!” Song Wei said happily and hung up the phone.

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head. He put his phone into his pocket and controlled the flying boat to rise again, flying in the direction of the capital University Library.

The place where he had just stopped was already the suburbs of Beijing. Therefore, with the flying speed of the airboat, it would take them a blink of an eye to cover such a short distance.

Xia ruofei controlled the flying boat and hovered above the rooftop of Capital university’s library.

The flying boat had opened its shield, so ordinary people couldn’t detect its existence at all. If there were cultivators nearby, they wouldn’t dare to get close at all when they saw such a domineering flying boat.

Even so, Xia ruofei still released his spiritual power to check the surroundings and remained alert at all times.

With his current spiritual power cultivation, it was not a particularly heavy burden for him to detect a range of ten kilometers at the same time.

Xia ruofei did not have to wait too long. Soon, he saw Song Wei’s figure on the rooftop.

Xia ruofei saw this and lowered the flying boat. Song Wei also went straight to the flying boat and jumped onto the deck.

Xia ruofei was standing at the door of the control room. Their eyes met. Song Wei pouted and said,”Ruofei, I realized that you’re especially fond of keeping people guessing now! He just likes to keep us in suspense ...”

“Have you applied for leave yet?” Xia ruofei chuckled.

“Please!” Song Wei said unhappily. It wouldn’t be a problem to go back for two or three days! Now, you can tell me why you’re bringing me back! I hope your reason is good enough, or I’ll ask Qingxue to teach you a lesson!”

At this point, Song Wei could not help but burst out laughing.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course, the reason is sufficient!” As for the first place ... I’ve carefully selected a cultivation technique for you, which is very suitable for young and beautiful female cultivators like you. This way, even if I’m not by your side, your cultivation will not be delayed! That’s why you’ll need to go to the three mountains with me and call Qingxue along. I’ll teach you all together. How was it? This reason should be sufficient!”

Song Wei seemed to be moved. She blinked her big eyes and asked,”Really? You’ve already chosen a cultivation technique?”

“I’ve always been very concerned about you two, okay?” Xia ruofei said,”actually, I’ve already chosen a cultivation technique. If it wasn’t for the fact that I had other matters to attend to these few days, I would have specially come back to look for you!”

“Alright! This reason is sufficient!” Song Wei smiled and asked,”what about the second? You just said there were two things!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the second reason is even more sufficient!” I’ll have to visit uncle song when I get back. ”

“My dad?” Song Wei was even more surprised.”Why did you suddenly visit him?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”what else can I do?” Of course it’s to ask for my hand in marriage ...”

Song Wei’s face turned red. She patted Xia ruofei lightly and said,””Don’t mess around! We’re talking about serious business!”

Xia ruofei stopped smiling and said,””There’s indeed something important! Have you forgotten how you all raised your cultivation levels a few days ago? How can we leave uncle song out of such a good thing?”

Song Wei was stunned at first, but she quickly reacted. She revealed a surprised and happy expression and asked,”Ruofei, you mean ... The wild tea has been successfully cultivated?”

Xia ruofei snapped his fingers and said with a smile,””Correct answer! To be more precise, not only did I successfully transplant them, but I also used time array flags. In this half a month, the wild tea has actually grown for more than a hundred years, so I’ve already harvested the first batch of finished tea leaves. Well ... I just went to the star Seizer sect and found two disciples to test the effects of the wild tea. After that, I rushed back without stopping! He wanted uncle song to drink wild tea as soon as possible! How was it? I’m a filial son – in – Law, aren’t I?”

Normally, if Xia ruofei teased her like this, Song Wei would be embarrassed and angry.

However, Song Wei was so shocked that she did not notice what Xia ruofei had said. She was surprised and happy.”RUO Fei, you’re really amazing! In this way, my father’s cultivation will also increase by one level?”

“It might be more than that!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”uncle song’s cultivation is only at the first level of the aura refining realm. With the effect of the wild tea, it’s possible for him to break through two or three levels in a row. After all, uncle song’s cultivation talent is still relatively high after the last incident! In short, the effect of this wild tea is worth looking forward to!”

“That’s great!” Song Wei said excitedly,”ruofei, don’t just stand there! Let’s hurry back to the three mountains!”
