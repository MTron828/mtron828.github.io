2823 Fearless (2)

The expedition this time was mainly initiated by Tieba, and the main force was the netizens of Xia ruofei’s Tieba. Of course, there were also the netizens of RCD Espanyol and Wu Lei’s Tieba, but the proportion of these netizens was not high, and many of them overlapped with the netizens of Xia ruofei’s Tieba.

Soon, the team member in charge of monitoring Pablo’s Facebook reported that Pablo had updated a post.

The screenshot of the post and the translated content were also sent to Qin Yanan.

Qin Yanan’s brows furrowed slightly. After carefully reading through the content, she sent out an order in the group chat.”Immediately post the content of this post on Tieba, Weibo, and all major forums!”

It wasn’t that she didn’t want to provide more guidance, but she couldn’t think of what kind of script to use at the moment. After all, the reason Pablo was still so fearless was that he couldn’t produce any evidence to convince the official broadcast team that they were already dismantling the equipment at that time. As for the surveillance footage, it was Camp Nou. Even if there were surveillance footage, would they use it to slap their own faces?

Qin Yanan was very clear that if there was no solid evidence, Pablo could say whatever he wanted. The Spanish side would at most have a war of words with him, and in the end, it would still fulfill his purpose of creating hype.

Qin Yanan guessed that Xia ruofei didn’t want pabulo to get what he wanted, so he wanted to borrow the power of the Chinese netizens.

She felt that the only thing she could do now was to use the Chinese netizens ‘sea of people tactic to suppress all the voices supporting Pablo and control the comments with the Chinese netizens’ comments.

As for the copywriting, the wisdom of the netizens was infinite. Instead of letting a few people in the team work behind closed doors, it was better to adopt an open strategy and let the netizens decide for themselves.

The members of the team quickly divided their work and posted the latest post and translated content on major domestic platforms.

Qin Yanan first calculated the time difference. In fact, it was already midnight in China, and it was almost evening in basaros.

She guessed that Xia ruofei should not be resting so early, so she picked up the phone on the desk and called him.

Xia ruofei was eating in the restaurant of the hotel.

Zhao Zhenghao took the earliest flight back to China in the afternoon. He had gained a lot from his meeting with Xia ruofei. He needed to go back and implement the consensus they had reached after the discussion. He also needed to talk to Lippi’s team in person and try to make Lippi accept it happily. This time, he had brought a lot of video recordings of Xia ruofei playing football. With these, he was very confident. Although Lippi was a big – Name coach, in the football desert of China, the sudden appearance of such a talented player was definitely a key figure that could greatly alleviate the situation of “cooking without rice.” Lippi would definitely put down his reservations for such a special talent.

Although Zhao Zhenghao had gone back, Zhou leiyun was still in Spain. Hence, he came over to have dinner with Xia ruofei and the other two.

As long as Xia ruofei was in Spain Zhou leiyun would take good care of him. If he was in Barcelona, he would try his best to be present for every meal, and he would even lower himself.

Just as everyone was eating and chatting, Xia ruofei received a call from Qin Yanan.

He took a look at the caller ID and saw that it was the company’s landline number, so he didn’t avoid everyone to answer the phone. He just greeted everyone and sat in his seat to answer the phone.

“Yanan!” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”what’s the matter?”

“Director Xia,” Qin Yanan said respectfully,”we’ve completed the task you’ve asked us to do. We’re here to report the latest progress to you!”

“Go ahead,” Xia ruofei said.

Hence, Qin Yanan reported to Xia ruofei everything that she had done after accepting the task, including the reactions of the netizens in Huaxia and the situation of the Tieba forum organizing the netizens ‘expedition.

After Xia ruofei heard Qin Yanan’s report on the comments on Facebook, he smiled and said,””Well done! Yanan, it’s almost midnight in China now! You’ve all worked hard!”

“It’s what we should do!” Qin Yanan quickly said,”director Xia, there’s a new situation. First of all, we found that some Spain media have noticed the situation with Pablo’s Facebook. Some media have already begun reporting on this matter. I will send the summarized public opinion analysis report to your email later. “There’s also another thing. Pablo has posted a thread claiming that he’s been subjected to cyberbullying. He’s scornful of the Chinese netizens ‘expedition and even clamored for everyone to produce evidence. He said that if there’s any evidence, he’ll apologize immediately. That’s the general content of the thread. ”

Xia ruofei said with great interest,”Oh?” This guy must have thought that he had picked up a treasure! This righteous post is most likely trying to stir up public opinion!”

Qin Yanan said awkwardly,””In fact, the Chinese netizens have objectively helped him to hype up the matter. All we can do is to group up and condemn him, especially the post that deliberately belittled you and Wu Lei. Everyone was filled with righteous indignation when they read it. That post also has the most comments because everyone has seen your and Wu Lei’s performance. It’s the easiest to refute. As for the lights – off and water – spraying incident, there’s no evidence at the moment. This is also the main reason Pablo is so happy right now. ”

“Then let him jump around first!” Xia ruofei said in a relaxed manner,”the more you jump, the more pain you’ll feel when you fall!”

“Understood!” Qin Yanan said,”I’ve already asked someone to send screenshots of the latest posts to the domestic forum. We’ve also arranged for people to take screenshots and translate some of the media articles that are obviously biased toward Barcelona. We’ll gradually push them to the domestic internet in the future.”

“Very good!” Xia ruofei said,”but everyone has worked hard today. Let’s go back and rest. We’ll continue tomorrow!”

Public opinion needed time to ferment. From Xia ruofei’s point of view, it was still a little short. All the evil people had not yet emerged. Besides, he had solid evidence in his hands, so he was naturally sitting on the fishing platform.

“Well ... It’s the peak time for internet access in Spain. I think it’s better to keep a close eye on it.” Qin Yanan said,”we can adjust our schedule. When it’s late at night in Spain, everyone can go and rest.”

“There’s no need for that!” Xia ruofei said,”just arrange for one or two people to take turns on duty. The rest of you can go and rest!”

“...Alright!” Qin Yanan said,”I’ll do it now!”

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yanan informed everyone in the group chat to finish up their work as soon as possible. Then, she would get off work and rest. She decided to personally keep an eye on things tonight, so she stayed in the office for the night.

On the Spain side, Xia ruofei had just put his phone back into his pocket when Song Wei asked,””RUO Fei, what’s the situation?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”our Chinese netizens are really awesome!” The netizens on Tieba had already formed a group to go out! Pablo’s Facebook is filled with messages from our Chinese netizens!”

Ling Qingxue said happily,”I knew it!” There’s nothing else in China but a lot of people!”

Zhou leiyun, who was listening by the side, was completely confused. He could not help but ask,””President Xia, what’s the situation?”

Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”director Zhou, haven’t you been paying attention to the situation on the internet these two days?” There was a Spain reporter on Facebook who was being sarcastic, hinting that Ruby was too smug and said that the water spray incident was a complete lie. He also greatly disparaged Wu Lei and me, saying that our skills were not good at all, that we were lucky to score goals, and that even joining the Spanish team was a means of capital manipulation ...”

“There’s such a thing? I’ve heard from my subordinates that some media reports in the gatai region are not very objective and are more biased towards bar?a. But these media are very biased and I’m used to it. ” Zhou leiyun said,”I didn’t expect there to be such a comment! I’ll get the club’s press officer to handle it immediately!”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
