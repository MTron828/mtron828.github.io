The production of the jaded skin ointment was also completed.

Xia ruofei put away the jaded skin cream in the container carefully and left the medium in a flash. He went back to his room to wash up and sleep. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

……

At noon the next day, Xia ruofei had just finished lunch and was preparing to go to the construction site to see that the main construction of the office building and employee’s apartment building was basically completed. Now, the construction site had started to carry out the exterior decoration, interior decoration, and surrounding environment renovation. Although Xia ruofei was very assured of the construction team sent by the Liang family, as the boss, he would go over whenever he had the time. This also showed that he took this seriously.

Xia ruofei’s phone rang when he reached the construction site.

He took out his phone, glanced at it, and quickly pressed the answer button.””Uncle Ling, how are you?”

The call was from Ling Xiaotian. Xia ruofei naturally did not dare to ignore his future father-in-law’s call.

“RUO Fei! Have you been busy recently?” Ling Xiaotian laughed heartily as he asked.

“It’s alright, just the farm stuff!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle Ling, what’s the matter?”

“Yes, the acquisition of the winery is basically complete.” Ling Xiaotian said,”if you have the time, come to my house in the afternoon! Let’s discuss the follow – up production. ”

“No problem, I’ll be there in a while!” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei did not dare to decline his future father-in-law’s call. Besides, he had shares in the winery! The earlier it went into production, the earlier it would be profitable.

Xia ruofei quickly walked around the construction site and had a brief chat with manager li, who had been watching the site. Then, he quickly left the site.

He returned to the villa, informed pang Hao and ye Lingyun, and then drove the Knight XV SUV towards Ling Xiaotian’s jiangbin villa.

Naturally, it was not good to visit Ling Xiaotian – handed. Xia ruofei found a place to Park his car, then took out two bottles of high – Quality Drunken Eight Immortals from the spirit map space, which had been mixed with flower petal solution. He also took a bucket and filled it with the spirit pool water. Then, he took two big carps from the fish pond in the original space and put them into the bucket.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and took out a small bottle of diluted flower petal solution. He put it into a bag together with the two bottles of wine. He thought that the flower petal solution that Ling Xiaotian had left for him should be almost used up since he was feeding the two high – Quality Blood Dragons.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to start the car again, he suddenly had an idea. He took out the container that contained the jaded skin ointment and put it in his bag. Then, he started the car and continued to drive to the jiangbin villa.

After half an hour, Xia ruofei arrived at Ling Xiaotian’s Villa.

At the entrance, Xia ruofei stopped the car and pressed the doorbell.

The camera on the metal door lit up, and Ling Xiaotian’s voice came from the communication device,””RUO Fei is here! Come in quickly!”

Then, the remote – controlled iron door slowly slid open.

Xia ruofei got into the car again and drove Knight XV into the courtyard of the villa. At this time, Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue had already come out of the villa.

“Uncle Ling, Qingxue!” Xia ruofei smiled and greeted him.”Why didn’t you go to the office today?”

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Today is Saturday. Even if we don’t rest, the staff have to rest!”

Xia ruofei touched his nose awkwardly. He really couldn’t remember what day it was. The farm’s construction site had to work overtime even at night, let alone rest on weekends. Although Xia ruofei had clearly stated that Cao tieshu and the other workers could rest on weekends, these simple farmer brothers would come to the farm as long as there was nothing particularly important at home.

In Cao tieshu’s words, these dishes were precious! She had to serve him well every day. What weekend?

After a while, Xia ruofei let them be. However, she told pang Hao to register them and pay them overtime every month.

Ling Xiaotian laughed and patted Xia ruofei’s shoulder,””Ruofei, quickly enter the house!”

Xia ruofei winked at Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue blushed for no reason, then rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei flirtatiously. Everything was clear without words.

The three of them came to the living room of the villa. Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian took their respective seats, while Ling Qingxue obediently served them tea.

Xia ruofei glanced at the big fish tank and asked,””Uncle Ling, how have the two red Dragons been recently?”

“I’m good! Don’t worry!” Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”ruofei, you don’t know! When my fish friends saw the blood Dragons, they were so envious! There are even people who want to buy it at a high price. Do you think I, old Ling, am someone who lacks money? I refused without even thinking about it. I said that this was a gift from my son – in – Law, and I wouldn’t sell it no matter how much money you offered!”

Ling Qingxue placed the teacup in front of Ling Xiaotian and said,””Dad! What son – in – Law? I didn’t say I was going to marry him!”

Xia ruofei immediately smiled and said,””Qingxue, isn’t this just a matter of time? Uncle Ling isn’t wrong!”

Ling Qingxue became even more embarrassed when she heard this, while Ling Xiaotian burst out laughing. The more he looked at Xia ruofei, the more he liked him. He felt that Xia ruofei and his daughter were a match made in heaven.
