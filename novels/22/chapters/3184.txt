3185 Early completion (2)

As time passed, even Xia ruofei started to get excited. This was a token that even the ancient cultivators couldn’t crack! If it could be cracked today, what a great achievement that would be!

Moreover, he was filled with curiosity and anticipation towards the contents of the token.

However, Xia ruofei had designed the algorithm himself, so he knew how much it would take to calculate.

Using the method of elimination to list all the possibilities and compare them with the database, then sorting them according to the size of the possibility. It sounded simple, but in reality, even a supercomputer would have to spend a lot of effort.

Hence, Xia ruofei knew that the results would not be out soon.

He waited patiently.

Time passed by slowly. At about oneo’ clock in the evening, Xia ruofei, who had been monitoring the situation with his spiritual power, noticed that the drowsy technician in the control room suddenly stood up.

Xia ruofei’s spirit was lifted. Could it be that the calculation was completed so quickly? The light of Taihu territory really lived up to its name!

Unexpectedly, the technician just stretched and then strolled to the bathroom connected to the control room ...

Xia ruofei pouted. He could not use his spiritual power to pay attention to someone else going to the toilet. What was so interesting about an otaku with an unkempt beard? If it was a beautiful technician ... Of course, she couldn’t spy on people going to the toilet!

After the technician went to the bathroom, he entered hypnosis mode again.

Other than recording the various parameters at fixed times, he spent most of his time sitting in his chair and dozing off.

At around two in the morning, Xia ruofei ‘saw’ the technician stand up again with his spiritual power.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He felt that it was necessary to suggest to this guy to check his kidney and bladder functions ...

However, the technician didn’t go to the bathroom this time.

He walked to the control panel and looked at it. After double – checking, he picked up the phone on the control panel and began to dial a number on a piece of paper.

Then, Xia ruofei’s phone rang ...

Xia ruofei quivered and picked up the phone.””Hello, are you President Xia?”

“I am!”

“This is the central control room, I’m on duty, little Xia! Director Xia, your program has completed its calculations. Do you need to come over now to copy the data?”

“I’ll be right there!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation.

Xia ruofei put down the phone and rushed out of the room.

At the same time, the door to Chen Xuan’s room was opened. He was also using his spiritual power to monitor the situation in the control room. Therefore, when the technician on duty called Xia ruofei, he was the first to know about the situation.

“Brother Chen, get senior mu and senior Liu. We’re going to the computer room!” Xia ruofei said.

Soon, Mu Sheng and the others also walked out of the room.

“Is this a success?” Mu Sheng asked.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”I haven’t seen the data yet. I don’t know if it’s a success or not!” However, the calculations have already been completed!”

“I hope everything goes well!” Chen Xuan asked with a face full of anticipation.

Xia ruofei looked at Chen Xuan and noticed that his face was a little pale. He asked with concern,””Brother Chen, you don’t look like you’re in a good state! Are you feeling uncomfortable?”

Chen Xuan couldn’t help but think to himself,’you’re the one who’s not in the right state! I’m just an early – Stage golden core cultivator. It’s already not easy for me to maintain this state after continuously spreading my mental power for four to five hours!

Then, Chen Xuan looked at Xia ruofei, who did not seem tired at all. He could not help but say,”Both of them were Aurous core beginner stage cultivators, so why was there such a huge gap between them?

“Thank you for your concern, brother Xia. I’m fine, just a little tired!” Chen Xuan squeezed out a smile.

“Brother Chen has been working hard recently!” Xia ruofei said,”I have to work on the algorithm program here and also modify the code for paradise Corporation. It’s really tiring to work on both sides!”

Chen Xuan was speechless,’am I tired because of this?’ There was simply no common language with this kind of person with freakishly strong spiritual power ...

Mu Sheng laughed and said,”now that this matter is over, nephew Chen can have a good rest!” It’s been hard on nephew Chen and little brother Xia this time ...”

They talked as they walked and soon returned to the computer room building.

Outside the control room, the technician was already waiting. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“President Xia! You’ve completed all the procedures!” The programmer said,”the result of the calculation is a data package. I have already placed it on this computer. As required, the working computer in the control room has already cleared the data.”

“Thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei nodded.

On the way from the guest house to the computer room, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had been covering the control room. He knew the technician’s every move like the back of his hand, so he knew that the technician was not lying.

Xia ruofei connected the portable hard drive to the computer and copied the data while telling the technician,””We need to use the lounge to check the data.”

“No problem! I’ll call someone to open the door!” The technician said.

Cai Songlin had already instructed them to do their best to satisfy Xia ruofei’s requests. Not to mention, this technician saw that even academician Wang Chi was friendly to Xia ruofei, so he naturally wouldn’t be impatient over such a small matter.

Although it was already the second half of the night, the staff on duty at the Supercomputing Center were on standby 24 hours a day. It was just a matter of opening the door.

The technician was making a call on the phone while Xia ruofei waited for the data to be copied.

The amount of data was not huge. Even though the probability was astronomical, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan had discussed it and decided that the lower – ranked combinations were meaningless after the algorithm had filtered them. Therefore, he set it to retain only the combinations with the highest probability in the top 1000.

Pure text data was naturally very small.

In a short while, Xia ruofei had copied the sealed data into the USB drive. He then used a small tool that he had developed to completely destroy the data package on the computer.

Although it was possible to recover a part of the data if they were to encounter a special and powerful recovery software, it was relatively safe.

“President Xia, the door is open. You can move to the lounge now.” The technician said.

“Thank you! You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei patted the technician’s shoulder, took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, and gave it to him.”Keep this for yourself. It’ll help you stay awake.”

Although it was only a pack of soft Chunghwa cigarettes, it was considered a high – cost cigarette for most people, especially for smokers who bought half a pack a day. They would not be willing to buy a pack that cost a few dozen Yuan.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to monitor the entire control room. Naturally, he knew that this technician was an old smoker. He had to smoke a cigarette every once in a while. In fact, this kind of shift work was very boring. Many people who did similar jobs could not avoid smoking.

“No need, no need!” The technician quickly declined,”this is my job ...”

...

“Take it!” Xia ruofei stuffed the cigarette into his hand and smiled.”I might have to trouble you!”

“No problem, no problem!” The technician reluctantly accepted the cigarette and said,”until eighto’ clock tomorrow morning, it’s still your time. If you need anything, you can find me at any time!”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Thank you for your hard work. Let’s go to the lounge to check the data.”

“Alright, alright!” The technician said.

Xia ruofei and the rest went to the lounge. Xia ruofei connected the hard disk to the laptop and copied the data.

The software to analyze the data was installed on this laptop.

It was actually a software similar to a decompression software that Xia ruofei had written himself. However, he had specially designed the decryption logic, which was not easy for ordinary people to crack.

After the software read the data, it automatically began to analyze it.

Xia ruofei and the others looked at the progress bar and became more and more excited ...
