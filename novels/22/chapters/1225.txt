Chapter 1226: Harvesting aweto (1)

Translator: 549690339

When Xia Qing took the initiative to contact Xia ruofei, Xia ruofei was packing up.

In fact, all of his daily items were stored in the spirit map space. Every time he went out, he would bring a small suitcase for show, so he didn’t have much to pack. He was mainly thinking about what gift to bring for MA Xiong.

Xia ruofei had a lot of good things. Tea leaves and wine were all rare treasures in the outside world. However, these things had been given away before, so there was nothing new.

Just as Xia ruofei was at a loss on what to choose, Xia Qing’s voice rang in his mind,””Master.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and immediately replied with his spiritual will,””Xia Qing, what happened? Is there a problem with the spirit map world?”

The number of times Xia Qing took the initiative to contact him could be counted on one’s fingers. Xia Qing was only a soul puppet. Most of the time, she completed her work meticulously according to Xia ruofei’s instructions. She did not have much of a human’s complex emotions and ability to make impromptu decisions.

“No, master,” Xia Qing replied,”I just wanted to report to you that we should be able to harvest the mountain sea realm’s Cordyceps!”

Xia ruofei immediately revealed a look of joy. A few months ago, he had personally rushed to the wormgrass production area in Nagqu and brought the local plateau vegetation, soil, wormgrass, and fungi all into the space. He had also asked Xia Qing to specially open up two mu of land in the mountain sea realm to cultivate wormgrass.

Other than paying some attention to this matter when he was doing cultivation experiments at the Archean realm, Xia Rufei basically didn’t care about it after that.

He had never thought that he would be able to harvest the Cordyceps that he had cultivated on a large scale in the mountain and sea realm so quickly.

“I’ll come in immediately!”Xia ruofei said expectantly.

He was already in his bedroom, so he immediately got up and locked the door and windows. Then, he summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and entered the space with a thought.

Xia ruofei immediately appeared next to the two mu of Cordyceps sinensis cultivation nursery in the mountain sea realm.

Xia Qing was already waiting for him there.

“Master, look!” Xia Qing came forward and pointed at the net as she spoke to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei looked in the direction that Xia Qing was pointing at. He saw that the originally black and fertile soil within the silk net was now covered with a layer of purplish – Red grass. From afar, it looked like a layer of purplish – Red Carpet had been laid on the ground.

There were also some Lucky Bat moth larvae that were not infected with the mycelium and successfully grew into bat moths. They flew around in the two acres of space, some attached to the gauze, and some stayed in the land between the grass.

These bat moths would be the new force to harvest Cordyceps in the future. They would lay eggs on the ground, and in the next growth cycle, some of the bat moth larvae hatched from these eggs would be infected by mycelium and produce new Cordyceps.

Xia Qing’s judgment was right. The grass exposed on the ground had turned purple, which meant that the Cordyceps in the soil could be harvested.

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. After a while, he said,””What the ... Isn’t the density a little too high? How can those bats and moths lay eggs?”

In Nagqu, where these Cordyceps sinensis were produced, it would take herb harvesters a long time to search inch by inch on the hillside of the plateau at an altitude of 4000 – 5000 m before finding one wormgrass. The probability of finding two wormgrass in a very close distance was very low.

The two acres of land covered by the net were covered with purple – Red grass. If the grass harvesters of Nagqu saw it, they would not believe their eyes.

Xia Qing said,”master, the spiritual Qi in the mountain and sea realm is too rich. These bats and moths grow very quickly, and their egg – laying rate is also very high. The survival rate of the eggs is even more astonishing. It’s not surprising that their production rate is high.”

Xia Qing paused and continued,””Bats and moths breed very quickly. I suggest expanding the scope of cordyceps cultivation after this harvest. The next time the Cordyceps grows, it will be too dense, which may affect the quality.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”No problem. I’ll buy the mesh and other materials and send them over. I’ll have to trouble you to get them ready.”

“It’s my duty, you’re too kind, master!” Xia Qing quickly said.

After taking a look outside the mesh, Xia ruofei decided to harvest all the wormgrass.

There were many bats and moths within the range of the net. If he went in directly, he might disturb them and even hurt these fragile moths.

However, in the spirit map space, this was not a difficult task for Xia ruofei.

With a slight thought, his powerful spiritual will enveloped the two acres of area.

Following that, the tens of thousands of bats and moths within the net were all bound by an invisible force and gathered in one area.

Whether it was those that were still on the net, those that were hidden among the dense grass, or those that were flying in the air, all of them were wrapped in spatial force without exception.

Xia ruofei’s control over the entire spirit map space had reached a very deep level. This piece of land was only two mu, which was a small corner in the mountain sea realm. Even if the number of bats and moths doubled, with Xia ruofei’s current strength, he could still easily control it.

Xia ruofei had already done the relevant design when he was building the Cordyceps sinensis cultivation nursery.

These bats and moths were restrained by an invisible force in space and slowly gathered in a corner. Then, Xia ruofei used another spiritual thought and a piece of silk net hanging at the side immediately unfolded.
