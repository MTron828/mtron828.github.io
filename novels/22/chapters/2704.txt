2705 The great array is activated (1)

The first thing Xia ruofei did was to call Liu Qingfeng and ask him to arrange for all the staff to leave their posts and gather in the project department building.

The project department building was designed to receive guests. In addition, there were not many employees left. Including the management level, there were only about 50 people, so it was completely able to accommodate them.

In addition, there were only a few posts on the peach source Island that required people to be on duty at night. Most of them were at the airport, dock, and other places. There was actually nothing much to do during the duty because there were very few foreign planes and ships entering the port. Therefore, it was not a problem for people to leave for one night.

At this time, Liu Qingfeng was at the peak of his enthusiasm. As for Xia ruofei’s order, he didn’t ask for the reason at all. Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately expressed his determination to carry it out and said that he would not miss a single person and would gather them all in the project department building.

Then, Xia ruofei called the mercenary group stationed on Peach Blossom Island and told them that there was an important event tonight. He also asked Jonathan to restrain his troops and soldiers from leaving the base without permission. Otherwise, they would be responsible for any problems.

Jonathan didn’t think much of Xia ruofei’s call, but since Xia ruofei was the employer, he agreed to it for the sake of US dollars.

Of course, the most important thing was that Peach Blossom Island was isolated from the sea and there was no entertainment on the island. Who would be stupid enough to run around in the middle of the night if they didn’t stay in the barracks?

After informing the Liu family’s employees and the mercenaries, Xia ruofei asked Tang Hu to call back all the brothers from the Hong sect. No one was left at the construction site.

Xia ruofei also told Tang Hu not to leave the temporary housing area tonight.

Regarding Xia ruofei’s order, Tang Hu naturally wouldn’t have any hesitation and immediately carried it out resolutely.

Li Yifu watched as Xia ruofei made phone calls one after another. He was getting more and more excited. He had been on edge these days and had been busy until now. Wasn’t it all for this moment?

After Xia ruofei finished the call, he looked at Li Yifu and couldn’t help but find it funny that this 90 – year – old Grand – disciple of his had completely lost the steadiness that an old man of his age should have. He was like an impatient young man who could not sit still. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Foster husband, it’s still early!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you haven’t rested for the past few days. Go back and rest. I’ll wake you up in the middle of the night!”

“Senior granduncle, how can I sleep at this time ...” Li Yifu said with a bitter smile,”you’re the one who can keep calm ...”

“If you can’t sleep, go out and take a walk. At the same time, see if there are any other people waiting outside.” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going to sleep for a while!”

“Yes!” Li Yifu quickly replied. In that case, have a good rest, martial granduncle. This disciple will go and patrol the area!”

Li Yifu bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and strode away.

Xia ruofei smiled and shook his head. He turned around and got into the car as well, driving in the direction of the Sosnovka Military Base’s warehouse.

Xia ruofei was also very excited, but it was not to the extent that he could not sleep.

After returning to the warehouse at the airport, Xia ruofei took out the core array disc and some supplementary materials from the spirit map space and put them into a backpack.

Then, he went to his military bed and lay down in his clothes. After a while, he began to snore softly.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes at around one in the morning.

He sat up and saw Li Yifu, who was not sleepy at all, sitting in the dark not far away. Li Yifu was very careful to keep quiet, probably because he was worried about disturbing his rest.

Hearing the sound of Xia ruofei waking up, Li Yifu quickly looked over and whispered,””Senior granduncle, you’re awake?”

Xia ruofei stretched his back and said,””You really stayed up for half the night ... You’re good!”

Li Yifu laughed in embarrassment and said,””This disciple really couldn’t sleep. I’ve embarrassed myself in front of martial granduncle ...”

“Let’s go! Let’s go!” Xia ruofei said,”whether we can succeed or not depends on this one move!”

Li Yifu’s spirit was immediately lifted and he said,””Yes! Senior granduncle!”

After the door of the warehouse was opened, the two of them walked out quietly. Then, they crossed the cordon guarded by several disciples of the Hong sect without anyone knowing and met the practitioners who were deliberately hiding their tracks. It was impossible for ordinary people to find their traces.

The two of them didn’t drive. After crossing the warning line, they flew directly to the west side of the island to remind Xia ruofei that he needed to set up the core array board. The location of the array board had been determined long ago. It was on the west side of the island, about 500 meters away from the seaside cliff.

At this point, Xia ruofei had already set up a solid concrete house. It was completed on the first day by the brothers of the Hong sect.

Although the cement was not completely dry yet, it did not affect its use.

The two of them were both cultivators, so their speed was naturally very fast. Of course, Xia ruofei could still suppress his speed. Otherwise, Li Yifu would not be able to keep up even if he used all his strength.

After a while, the two of them arrived in front of the cement house.

Li Yifu already knew all the modification locations by heart, so he understood the moment he arrived. He asked,””Martial granduncle, is this where the core of the formation should be placed?”
