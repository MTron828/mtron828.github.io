Chapter 3404: Light at the end of the tunnel (2)

Translator: 549690339

Layman Yuntai was in the state of a spiritual body and should have dissipated over time. However, because of Xia ruofei’s mysterious ore, his spiritual body could survive for a long time. It was also because of this that scholar Yuntai had always stayed in the inner space of this mysterious ore. Moreover, he spent most of his time in closed – door cultivation, strengthening his spirit body bit by bit.

During this period, master Yuntai had a few short moments of consciousness, but it was very short, and Xia ruofei never had the opportunity to have an in – depth exchange with him.

The situation was urgent. After all, master Yuntai was a senior and had more experience than Xia ruofei. He might be able to help.

That mysterious ore had always been placed in the stone chamber of the mountain sea realm’s cave. However, Xia ruofei was the master of the spirit map space, and he only needed to move his thoughts slightly, and the ore would be directly moved over.

“Senior Yuntai!” Xia ruofei’s voice was filled with surprise.

If there was anyway to turn the situation around, it would be on layman Yuntai.

Layman Yuntai said in surprise,””Your time formation is interesting! Two layers of nesting, and the effect can be stacked, creating a difference of two thousand times time flow. Amazing!”

Scholar Yuntai was indeed very experienced. Although his spiritual body was in the mysterious ore space, he could accurately judge the difference in the flow of time in his current position by just using a trace of his mental power.

Xia ruofei was not in the mood to talk about time formation. He said anxiously,”Senior Yuntai, you’ve seen the current situation. It’s quite critical… Do you have any good ideas?”

Scholar Yuntai also knew that although the current situation was dangerous, it was not particularly urgent because of the time formation. Therefore, he slowly said with a smile,””If I’m not mistaken, the one chasing you should be a goldthread nether snake, right?”

Xia ruofei was overjoyed when he heard scholar Yuntai’s words. It was good that this old senior could recognize the goldthread nether snake. Perhaps he would have a way to deal with it.

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”yes!” Senior Yuntai, do you know about this golden thread nether snake?” What are its weaknesses?”

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”Speaking of which… This golden thread nether snake should have gone extinct a long time ago!” When 1 first started on the path of cultivation, I saw a senior of my sect catch one, and it was a young goldthread nether snake. I remember that senior saying that goldthread nether snakes were very rare and almost extinct. And the one that’s chasing us now is obviously an adult! Where was this place? Why would there be such a huge goldthread nether snake?”

Although Xia ruofei was anxious, he still said patiently,””Senior Yuntai, this is a trial space!”

Then, Xia ruofei briefly explained how they went into the arcane realm after they arrived on the moon and how he went into the Tower of Trials. Of course, he skipped over the details of Ling Qingxue being teleported to the same place as him and the Tower of Trials.

Upon hearing this, scholar Yuntai said with interest,””! didn’t know that the rising Dragon Token had such a wonderful use! This secret realm is really on the Moon Far Away!”

“Senior Yuntai, the golden thread nether snake is about to catch up. Please tell me how to deal with it!” Xia ruofei said. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Even though time was 2000 times slower, the goldthread nether snake was still very fast. Xia ruofei roughly estimated that it would take at most an hour, which was two to three seconds in the outside world, for the snake to catch up to the spirit map. If they could not come up with a solution before that, everything would be out of control.

“Fellow Daoist Xia,” said layman Yuntai with a smile,”in our time, although the golden thread nether snake was rare, its strength was actually average. Under normal circumstances, even an early stage nascent soul cultivator could easily deal with it…” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be speechless. The nascent Soul Stage was still far from him. In the eyes of master Yuntai, cultivators in the early stage of the nascent Soul Stage were not even worth mentioning. Hence, he felt that the goldthread nether snake was not difficult to deal with.

“If 1 had the cultivation of an early nascent soul realm cultivator, I wouldn’t have to run away in such a sorry state …” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,””The Yuanying stage isn’t difficult, but there’s no way to improve your cultivation in a short time. You’re only at the early Aurous core stage, so it won’t be easy for you to deal with the goldthread nether snake.”

Speaking up to this point, scholar Yuntai paused for a moment. He was probably trying to recall the characteristics of the goldthread nether snake.

He pondered for a moment and said,””The weakness of all snakes is at the seven – inch,” ye mo said.”To deal with the goldthread nether snake, we have to find its seven – inch.”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment.”But this snake is much bigger than a giant python. Its strength is comparable to a cultivator at the peak of the late golden core stage. It doesn’t seem easy to attack such a large snake.”

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,””The goldthread nether snake’s weakness isn’t on its body!”

“All?” Xia ruofei was confused.”It’s not the weakness?” What… What do you mean?”

Scholar Yuntai laughed and said,”it’s indeed not on its body, it’s on its head!” Did you notice that there are three golden threads on the head of the goldthread nether snake, about an inch long…”

“I’ve already seen that.” Xia ruofei said.

“If you look closely, you’ll see that the three golden threads on the snake’s head are in fact the shape of three snakes.” Said layman Yuntai.

Xia ruofei quickly used his spiritual power to check. Because time was two thousand times faster inside and outside, everything outside seemed to be still and moving very slowly. Hence, Xia ruofei easily found the three golden lines. After checking carefully, Xia ruofei said,”Senior Yuntai, you’re very accurate. Those three golden lines are really in the shape of three little snakes.”

Scholar Yuntai chuckled and said,”so, the weakness of the golden thread nether snake isn’t in the seven – inch spot on its body, but in the seven – inch spot of these three little golden snakes!” If you attack the vital points of those three little golden snakes, you should be able to obtain a good result!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””If it wasn’t for senior Yuntai, then this junior really wouldn’t have thought that this beast’s Mingmen was actually on its head. Normally, the head should be the most vulnerable place to attack. In the process of natural selection, how did it survive? Such a huge weakness actually didn’t evolve…”

“Fellow Daoist Xia,” said layman Yuntai with a smile,”I learned this from the elders in my sect. I’ve never fought against the goldthread nether snake before, so 1 can’t guarantee that this weakness is accurate.”

Then, layman Yuntai said,””That’s right. As far as I know, goldthread nether snake’s ability to sense space is extremely weak, and your ability to control the laws of space is even better than some nascent soul cultivators. You can try to use this characteristic of goldthread nether snake and give it a fatal blow!”

“Spatial rules?” Xia ruofei muttered thoughtfully. Then, his eyes suddenly lit up and he said,”thank you for your guidance, senior Yuntai! I’ve benefited a lot!”

Since the space rule attack was the most effective, Xia ruofei decided to recall all the space – related formations he knew.

The laws of space were considered to be of a higher level. Xia ruofei’s talent in array Dao was higher, and his understanding of space was also amazing. He had been trapped in the mysterious ore for thousands of years and had been studying the laws of space during that time. In this area, he was an absolute expert.

Using the laws of space to set up an array was even more advanced.

After all, it was extremely difficult to grasp the laws of space, and it was even more difficult to use the laws of space to form an array.

Spatial law formations were more powerful than ordinary maze and trap formations, and most of them were nested in multiple spaces. If one used ordinary methods to break the formation, if one’s strength was strong enough, it was possible to break a trap formation or maze formation with force. However, the formation of space rules was different. It was really useless. Even if one could break the space with brute force, a powerful space formation could nest countless space cages. Even if an ordinary Aurous core stage or nascent Soul Stage cultivator died of exhaustion, it was impossible to break so many nested spaces with brute force.

As Xia ruofei thought about it, his expression started to relax..
