Chapter 638: The reproduction of the Stingray (2)

“I understand!” Tian Huixin said excitedly,”Xiao Xia, I’ll settle this matter as soon as I get back. In addition, while these children are receiving treatment, our Hengfeng hotel will provide a standard room for each family for free! Their three meals a day will also be covered by our hotel! Also, the Hengfeng group will be responsible for the round – trip transportation expenses of the children from other places!”

“That’s great! Thank you, aunt Huixin!” Xia ruofei said happily.

Tian Huixin really wanted to help the autistic community. The MA family’s Hengfeng group was rich, so this little fee was naturally nothing. In fact, the Hengfeng group also had a special charity fund, and the annual charity funds were in the hundreds of millions.

“This is just a tiny bit of my power!” Tian Huixin smiled and said,”those children should be thanking you! Little Xia, this is really a great deed with boundless merit. I’ll say thank you on behalf of all the autistic children!”

Tian Huixin was very serious. Xia ruofei quickly said,””You’re praising me too much, I’m just trying my best ...”

……

Tian Hui was full of motivation as she began screening for children with autism who would participate in the research stage. Feng Jing also began to understand the process of setting up a pharmaceutical factory and the approval of the new drug. At the same time, she also took the initiative to pay attention to the operations of the surrounding pharmaceutical factories.

Feng Jing always put a lot of things in front of her when she did her work. There was no doubt that it was much more convenient to acquire a pharmaceutical factory directly than to build a new one.

Xia ruofei put these things aside for the time being because the Hengfeng group’s San Shan office had called him and told him that the Jade he needed was ready.

This time, Xia ruofei had asked for 50 million Chinese dollars worth of Jade. The quantity was indeed a little large. The Hengfeng group was able to prepare it in such a short time because they had urgently transferred the goods from all over the world.

After Xia ruofei received the call, he immediately drove to the city and handed over the Jade in the Hengfeng jewelry’s vault. Then, he went to the bank to make a 50 million Chinese dollars transfer.

Xia ruofei flew with the Jade and soon returned to the farm.

He easily carried the two huge and heavy metal boxes and ran upstairs. After closing the door and windows, he impatiently took out the spirit map scroll and opened the two metal boxes.

......

The box was full of jadeite.

That’s a whole 50 million Chinese dollars! They were all replaced with Jade, and it was quite shocking to see them piled together.

However, no matter how beautiful the Jade was, it couldn’t be eaten as a meal. It could be eaten as a meal for spirit paintings.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate at all. With a thought, the Jades in the box flew towards the spirit map scroll.

As soon as they came into contact with the spirit map, they were like snowflakes falling into a pot of oil, instantly disappearing without a trace.

With Xia ruofei’s current spiritual power, he could control small objects with great precision even in the outside world. He could even retrieve objects from a distance without any problem.

The Jades flew up one by one, one after another, towards the spirit map, forming two green arcs.

After a short while, the two metal boxes were empty.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel the pain. 50 million Chinese dollars! If it was thrown into the water, it would probably cause a huge wave, but it was absorbed by the spirit map scroll just like that.

What was worse was that the spirit map scroll was like a bottomless pit. If he wanted to level up, he didn’t know how much Jade it would absorb.

At the very least, this 50 million was definitely not enough.

However, after absorbing so much Jade at once, the spirit map scroll would definitely change.

Xia ruofei had tested it before. After absorbing the Jade, even if the conditions for upgrading were not met, the spirit map scroll could still expand its range and change the terrain. Once the conditions for upgrading were met, there would be a qualitative change.

Hence, after the jadeite was completely absorbed, Xia ruofei could not wait to enter the spirit map space.

He first arrived at the original space.

The first obvious feeling was that the density of the spirit Qi had changed again. Originally, there was already a trace of spirit fog above the space. Now, the spirit fog seemed to be thicker, and he could clearly feel the dense water vapor.

“It seems like the spiritual energy in this space will be liquefied the next time I level up,” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself.

The size of the original space did not change, which was within Xia ruofei’s expectations. The changes should be in the new space.

Xia ruofei strolled around and looked at the Phoebe zhennan wood, the mother tree Da Hong Pao, wild ginseng, iron – Skin Dendi, and so on. He then came to the small fish pond.

It had been about twenty days in the outside world since the pair of wild Chinese perch entered the medium, which meant they had been in the medium for almost two years.

Xia ruofei had been busy making the parts of the array disc and didn’t have time to pay attention to them. Today, when he was patrolling the space, he suddenly thought of it and rushed over to take a look.

Xia ruofei took a closer look and was instantly overjoyed. Other than the two Chinese perch that were swimming leisurely in the pond, there were also many small baby fishes. These baby fishes were obviously just born. They were so small that one would not be able to notice them if they did not look carefully.

He didn’t expect this pair of pomfrets to be so powerful. They had just settled down in the fish pond and had already started to carry on the family line.
