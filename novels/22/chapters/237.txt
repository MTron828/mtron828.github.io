Chapter 238: An unexpected encounter (1)

The next day, at around 11 pm, Ling Qingxue arrived at the agreed location. It was a Western restaurant called Jing Mi. A young man in a suit and leather shoes was sitting next to the glass display window facing the street. When he saw Ling Qingxue push open the door and enter, his eyes lit up. The young man stood up and quickly tidied up his already – Flat suit, then waved at Ling Qingxue. “Miss Ling, over here!” The young man called out. Ling Qingxue looked at the young man and squeezed out a smile. She walked over to the seat. Today, Ling Qingxue did not deliberately dress up. She was just wearing a black business suit that she wore for work, and she only had light makeup on. However, Ling Qingxue was a natural beauty, and she did not need to dress up to attract a lot of attention. Her tall figure, in particular, allowed her to immediately catch the attention of people in the crowd. “You’re President Lin?” Ling Qingxue asked with a professional smile on her face. According to Ling Xiaotian, Lin Feng had started his own information consulting company. This was also a common routine of many second generation officials. The so – called information consulting was actually just using connections to help people get “consultation fees”, and money came quickly. Lin Feng had a gentle and refined smile on his face.””Miss Ling, you don’t have to be so polite. You can just call me Lin Feng. Miss Ling, please sit!” After speaking, Lin Feng pulled out a chair for Ling Qingxue. Ling Qingxue thanked him and sat down. Lin Feng also came to the opposite seat and sat down. The waiter came over with the menu, and Lin Feng elegantly raised his hand to signal for Ling Qingxue to order. Ling Qingxue randomly ordered a few dishes, and Lin Feng also quickly ordered. After the waiter left, Lin Feng smiled and said,””Miss Ling, I’ve long heard that there’s a beautiful little princess in Ling Ji restaurant. Now that I’ve seen her, I realize that the rumors were too conservative. Miss Ling is really a natural beauty!” “President Lin, you’re too kind.” Ling Qingxue said indifferently. From the moment they met, Lin Feng’s behavior could be said to be refined and polite, decent and generous. However, Ling Qingxue kept feeling uncomfortable, especially when it came to Lin Feng’s gaze. Although he concealed it very well, Ling Qingxue could still keenly sense a hint of lust in his eyes. “Miss Ling, I heard that your company’s Lingyun hotel is also competing to be the designated reception unit of the municipal Party Committee.” Lin Feng smiled and said,”my father is the one who is in charge of this bidding. I’ll talk to him later. It’s not a big problem for him to give your company some care within the rules.” “Then, thank you, President Lin.” Ling Qingxue squeezed out a smile. The corners of Lin Feng’s lips curled up slightly, and he felt a little proud in his heart. All these years, Lin Feng had seen countless women. Money and power were two methods that had been tried and tested time and time again. The long – legged beauty in front of him definitely did not lack money, but no matter how rich she was, she still had a request to ask from his family. Lin Feng believed that using the opportunity of this bidding, in addition to his good appearance and the gentle and elegant image he deliberately created, it was only a matter of time before he won her over. Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, was thinking about when she should get up and leave so that she could end this nonsensical meal as soon as possible without appearing too rude. The two of them had their own thoughts. Lin Feng kept hinting at the power and influence of his family, while Ling Qingxue kept on pretending to be polite, her mind somewhat elsewhere. …… At the same time, Xia ruofei was driving his Knight XV into San Shan city. Guan Ping had called him in the morning to tell him that he would be able to complete the entire transfer process that day. At the end, he wanted to be there in person to sign the papers and then go to the bank to transfer the money. Because they got the number later, they agreed to meet at the real estate trading center at 11:30. These days, second – hand property transactions were very popular. The parking spaces in the real estate Center were always full, so Xia ruofei did not drive there. He remembered that there was a row of parking spaces with parking watches on the street diagonally opposite the real estate Center, so he drove there directly. There were empty parking spaces on the meter. As many citizens did not have a parking card, Xia ruofei found a parking space very quickly and skillfully moved the Knight XV’s huge body into the parking space. After alighting, Xia ruofei swiped his parking card on the parking meter and was ready to cross the street to the real estate Exchange Center across the street. At this moment, Xia ruofei’s eyes swept across the room and saw Ling Qingxue through the glass window. She was sitting opposite a young man who was dressed like a groom. They were eating and chatting. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but freeze. At this moment, Xia ruofei felt a little sour. It was a normal reaction for a man. However, he quickly adjusted his state of mind. This was because he had absolute trust in Ling Qingxue. He believed that Ling Qingxue would never go behind his back and have any relationship with other men that went beyond friendship. It should be just an ordinary business meeting! Xia ruofei thought. Xia ruofei thought for a while and decided not to go over and say hello. Both parties in love were free to do whatever they wanted. Xia ruofei did not like to be controlled by others. Hence, even though he was with Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei did not treat her as his personal belonging. He felt that it was necessary for them to keep some space. Since Ling Qingxue didn’t tell him about the lunch appointment, his sudden appearance at this time would inevitably make Ling Qingxue feel a little awkward. After making up his mind, Xia ruofei took another look at Ling Qingxue in the Western restaurant and then walked across the street. At this time, the bored Ling Qingxue was dealing with Lin Feng’s flattery while turning her head to look out of the glass window. The Knight XV’s majestic carriage came into her sight. Ling Qingxue’s expression changed slightly. The car was a limited edition, and there were only a few in the country. Xia ruofei was the only one in San Shan city who owned it. RUO Fei had just been here? Ling Qingxue had this thought. Then, she looked around and quickly saw Xia ruofei’s back as he crossed the road. For some reason, Ling Qingxue felt that Xia ruofei’s tall figure seemed a little lonely. She couldn’t help but tremble ... RUO Fei must have seen me! Ling Qingxue said in her heart. “Miss Ling, miss Ling ...” Lin Feng couldn’t help but call out when he saw Ling Qingxue looking out the window in a daze. “Ah ...” Ling Qingxue regained her senses. She then glanced at Lin Feng before suddenly standing up and saying,””I’m sorry, President Lin. I suddenly remembered that I have something urgent to attend to. Please excuse me!” Ling Qingxue then grabbed her phone and handbag and quickly walked out of the restaurant. Lin Feng was stunned for a moment before he hurriedly replied,””Miss Ling, eat before you leave! Ling ...” Before Lin Feng could finish his sentence, Ling Qingxue had already left the restaurant in a hurry. Lin Feng’s face darkened. He called the waiter to get the bill and quickly left the Western restaurant, chasing after Ling Qingxue. After Ling Qingxue left the Western restaurant, she saw that Xia ruofei had already walked to the other side of the road. She couldn’t help but shout,””RUO Fei! RUO Fei! Wait for me ...” With that, Ling Qingxue immediately dashed towards Xia ruofei. There were many cars on this road, and Ling Qingxue’s sudden appearance made many drivers break out in cold sweat. A few of them hurriedly braked, and some bad – tempered drivers even stuck their heads out and started cursing. Ling Qingxue didn’t care about any of this. Her eyes were only on Xia ruofei, who was on the other side of the road. The moment Ling Qingxue called out, Xia ruofei, who had exceptional hearing, had already heard it. However, he was still stunned for a moment. When he turned around, he saw Ling Qingxue charging towards him from the other side of the road. Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat and he quickly turned around to face her. Ling Qingxue threw herself into Xia ruofei’s arms. Her eyes were misty as she looked up at Xia ruofei. She said softly,””RUO Fei, don’t leave me ...”
