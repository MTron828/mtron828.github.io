2069 Rapid recovery (1)

“I understand, I understand!” Lui hai said hurriedly,”it’s our last chance to save our lives, and it’s a one – time thing. We won’t use it unless we have no other choice.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You can’t use it even if you want to. This thing is triggered passively. Once it works, it means that you’ve already brushed past death once.”

“Yes, yes, yes! Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Lui hai said.

“Thank you, Mr. Xia!” Lu zhengfeng and the others also said in unison.

This time, their gratitude came from the bottom of their hearts. Previously, they respected Xia ruofei because of Li Yifu’s repeated reminders, but it was more because of Xia ruofei’s identity. However, it was completely different now. This respect came from the bottom of their hearts.

For people like them who lived on the edge of blood, such a jade pendant was no exaggeration to say that it was their Second Life! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Hence, it was not an exaggeration to say that Xia ruofei had given them a new life.

Xia ruofei laughed as he looked at Lu zhengfeng and asked,”You won’t be pointing a gun at me again, right?”

Lu zhengfeng’s face was full of shame. He lowered his head and pondered for a moment. Then, he immediately raised his head and said,”Mr. Xia, zhengfeng didn’t know what was good for him and misunderstood your good intentions! My brothers are all following my orders, it has nothing to do with them! This spear – wielding arm will be zhengfeng’s apology to you!”

After saying that, Lu zhengfeng secretly gritted his teeth, pulled out a dagger from his waist, and cut his arm fiercely.

Xia ruofei’s eyes narrowed and he exerted a little force on his feet. He was a few meters away from Lu zhengfeng and in a flash, he was in front of Lu zhengfeng. He stretched out his finger and gently touched Lu zhengfeng’s arm that was holding the knife.

Lu zhengfeng suddenly felt half of his body go numb, and the dagger in his hand fell to the ground with a clang.

Just now, Lu zhengfeng was very determined. Although Lu hai and the others were very close to him, none of them could react in time. When they came back to their senses, Xia ruofei had already come to Lu zhengfeng’s side from a few meters away. Then, they saw the dagger fall to the ground.

Lui Hai’s heart skipped a beat. Seeing that Xia ruofei stopped Lu zhengfeng, he let out a sigh of relief. If Lyu zhengfeng really cut off his arm, they would have nothing to say, they would even take it for granted. But Lyu zhengfeng was Lyu Hai’s cousin after all. From the point of view of justice, he could not stop Lyu zhengfeng, but from the perspective of a brother, Lyu hai naturally did not want to see Lyu zhengfeng become disabled.

If Xia ruofei stopped him, that would be the best result.

Except for being slightly relieved, lui hai was also shocked by Xia ruofei’s strength.

The instantaneous speed that was almost beyond the limit of human beings and the light finger attack reminded lui hai of Xia Tian who had killed more than a dozen core members of the Geerman family like a ghost a few days ago.

Xia ruofei’s face darkened.”I’m most annoyed with you people who live in the underworld. You Cut Off Your Hands and feet for no reason. Is it fun to make blood all over the place?” Why would I want your arm? Roast and eat? Will the fishy smell be lighter if I add more cumin?”

Lyu hai and the others didn’t dare to speak. Lyu zhengfeng also said awkwardly,””Mr. Xia, I ...”

“You what you?” Xia ruofei said,”you were concerned about ah Hai’s safety and subconsciously took out your gun to protect him. What’s wrong with that? You don’t know that I’m showing you the function of the jade pendant. Haven’t you heard of the old saying “those who don’t know are not guilty”?”

“I see ...” Lu zhengfeng said,”thank you for your magnanimity, Mr. Xia ...”

“Use your brain when you do things in the future, don’t cut yourself for fun! How much meat do you have on your body? how many cuts is it enough for you?” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes!” Lu zhengfeng lowered his head and said.

Although Xia ruofei’s words were rude and his tone was a little harsh, Lu zhengfeng felt warm in his heart.

Lui hai was also touched,”Mr. Xia, thank you!” Zhengfeng is just an impulsive person, thank you for your magnanimity!”

“Ah hai, you should be very happy to have a brother like zhengfeng,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Lui hai said.

Xia ruofei looked around and said seriously,””I have to emphasize one more thing. What you saw in this conference room today, including this jade pendant, must be kept in your heart after leaving here. You can’t tell anyone else except your foster husband, even your closest family members. Am I clear?”

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power when he said this. He was already very familiar with this kind of hypnosis technique.

Lui hai and the others were all ordinary people without any cultivation. Plus, Xia ruofei’s superb skills had left a deep impression in their hearts, so they were all affected by the spiritual power at the first moment.

Of course, they didn’t realize it themselves. They only felt that Xia ruofei was full of pressure when he said those words. Everyone felt a kind of respect from the bottom of their hearts.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s order had been deeply imprinted in their subconsciousness. Every time they thought about what happened today, they would unconsciously think of this scene. Even if they were drunk, or if they were forced to confess or if they were under special drugs, their subconsciousness would still tell them to keep this secret.
