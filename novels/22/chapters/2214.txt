2215 A subtle relationship (1)

“What do you mean?” Ling Qingxue’s face reddened slightly as she replied,”of course I mean what I said!”

Xia ruofei was still confused. At this moment, Song Wei could not stand it anymore. She suppressed her embarrassment and said with a red face,”RUO Fei, it’s like this. I’ve discussed it with Qingxue. We’ll only be friends with you for the time being, but ... But we’ll continue to cultivate the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “with you.”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. After he came back to his senses, he couldn’t help but look at Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue nodded unhappily, confirming Song Wei’s words. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Xia ruofei swallowed his saliva and asked,””Continue to cultivate the” absolute beginning Heart Sutra “? Then ... Is it only normal joint training, or ... Does it include spirit body joint cultivation?”

The two girls ‘faces heated up at the same time, like ripe apples. Even Ling Qingxue, who had been full of aura just now, suddenly became bashful.

The room was suddenly filled with a strange atmosphere.

Xia ruofei also realized that he had asked a stupid question. He laughed dryly to hide his embarrassment and said,””I understand ... I understand ...”

Ling Qingxue spat and said,””You know nothing!”

“It’s not good for a girl to use vulgarities!” Xia ruofei said immediately.

“I already said, none of your business!” Ling Qingxue said unreasonably,”you’re so evil. You only know how to bully us ...”

As expected, it was a stupid thing to reason with a woman.

Xia ruofei wisely shut his mouth, but after a while, he couldn’t help but Mutter,””What’s there to be embarrassed about? Who would buy a top – tier computer with an i7 processor and still want to use an antique 386?”

In fact, the extreme pleasure of the spirit body joint cultivation process was as big as the difference between a top computer and an antique computer from ten or twenty years ago when compared with the sex in reality.

This was the result of Ling Qingxue and Song Wei’s discussion. Naturally, Xia ruofei let out a long sigh of relief.

However, he had forgotten one thing. Ling Qingxue and Song Wei were also cultivators. Even though his voice was very soft, the two of them could hear him clearly.

In reality, Ling Qingxue and Song Wei’s agreement was a little self – deceiving, or perhaps she just wanted to give herself a reason to convince herself.

Hence, after hearing Xia ruofei’s mumbling, the two of them could not help but feel embarrassed and angry.

Even song Wei could not help but glare at Xia ruofei and said,””Qingxue, you’re right! This person is really too evil ...”

Ling Qingxue nodded in agreement and said,””You’re just too soft – hearted, if it were up to me ... We should just leave him hanging for ten days to half a month, let’s see if he still dares to be so fickle in love in the future!”

Song Wei’s face heated up. She glanced at Xia ruofei and lowered her head without saying a word.

If Song Wei had not taken the initiative to tell Xia ruofei about the results of their discussion, Ling Qingxue would not have revealed it so easily.

Xia ruofei was in a good mood. He smiled and said,””Isn’t that good? It’s fine as long as we make things clear! Qingxue, Weiwei, thank you!”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but roll her eyes.””Wei Wei, look, this guy is so proud!”

“Forget it, didn’t we agree on this?” Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled.

Xia ruofei looked embarrassed. Whatever he said was wrong anyway. The two of them were probably still angry! Ling Qingxue, in particular, must have felt uncomfortable.

He could only slowly comfort her in the future.

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”Alright, we came to inform you of this! If there’s nothing else, we’ll be leaving ...”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”go?” Where are you going this late at night? Just stay here!”

“What are you thinking!” Ling Qingxue said,”could it be that you want to take advantage of the night to plot something?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Xia ruofei said with a bitter smile.

“My house isn’t far away!” Ling Qingxue replied. Of course, she was going home! In order to prevent you from bullying Wei Wei when I’m not around, I’ve decided to bring her to my house!”

Song Wei quickly nodded. She had to make her stand clear at this time! Otherwise, what if Ling Qingxue was overthinking things? Their agreement was to maintain a superficial balance, especially when they were together with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei said,”Oh ... Then I’ll send you there!” The neighborhood might not be safe at this hour! Wait a minute! I’ll change my clothes!”

“Xia ruofei, you look like you can’t wait for us to leave!” Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

Xia ruofei replied innocently,”no way.” Didn’t ... Didn’t you say that you wanted to leave?”

It didn’t seem right! I can’t live like this ... Xia ruofei said in his heart.

Ling Qingxue sat beside Xia ruofei’s bed and said,””I suddenly feel that this bedroom is not bad! Wei Wei and I will be staying here tonight!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei happily said,”that’s great!” Just you wait! I’ll go look for a blanket. This bed is big enough for three people!”

“What good things are you thinking of!” Ling Qingxue and Song Wei said in unison.

“Don’t play dumb, ruofei!”Song Wei chuckled. What Qingxue means is that we’re commandeering this room, so you can find your own room to sleep in!”
