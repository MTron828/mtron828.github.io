Chapter 1733: Winemaking (2)

Although Zhao Yongjun and the others did not discuss the formation in front of Feng Jing, Feng Jing knew that Xia ruofei had something to do the next day.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s fine!” I’d better go and send him off! I’ll be in the capital for a few days, so I’ll leave the company to you when I get back. ”

“Mm, don’t worry!” Feng Jing smiled and said,”the position of CEO of paradise Corporation is probably the easiest. We don’t have to worry about sales at all. Moreover, we’re going for the high – Quality route, so there’s not much pressure in terms of production ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s not as easy as you say.” The scale of the company is getting bigger and bigger, and there are more and more people. There are countless things in all aspects, and a slight mistake may cause serious consequences. It’s my good fortune in my previous life to have you help me take charge of the company!”

Paradise Corporation seemed to be developing smoothly, but in fact, it was all thanks to Feng Jing’s meticulous work. Otherwise, a company that focused on high – Quality products like this could very well collapse once a negative problem that would affect its reputation appeared.

Xia ruofei was no longer a newbie who had just started his own business. He knew that Feng Jing had always been very stressed and had always been walking on thin ice.

Feng Rao blushed and said,””Why are you getting more and more nauseating!”

Xia ruofei also realized that what he said just now was a little inappropriate. He smiled and changed the topic.”By the way, remember to be fully armed when you go back tomorrow! You’d better put on all your masks, sunglasses, and caps. I can’t guarantee that the reporters won’t go to the airport to surround you if they can’t find me!”

Speaking of which, Feng Jing was also directly involved in the emergency landing. Now that everyone knew that Feng Jing had been sitting in the cockpit after the incident, it could be said that she had personally experienced the entire emergency landing. If they could not find Xia ruofei, Feng Jing would definitely be the most suitable target for the interview.

“Am I just a fish in the pond?” Feng Rao asked.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you should be content!” I don’t even dare to go out now ...”

“Then you’ll still send me off tomorrow?”

“That’s not the same, you’re my sister ran!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”even if it’s a knife outside, I wouldn’t dare not to send you! It’s just a few reporters, what’s there to be afraid of?”

“What a glib tongue!” Feng Rao’s face turned red.

Considering that Feng Jing had to take a plane tomorrow, Xia ruofei chatted with her for a while before they went back to their rooms to rest.

Xia ruofei returned to his bedroom. He was not in a hurry to take a shower. Instead, he locked the doors and windows and drew the curtains. Then, he carefully checked the room with his spiritual power before summoning the spirit map from his palm.

After all, he had left for a while. It was not that he was worried about Wu Qiang, but the secret of the spirit map space was too important. Xia ruofei did not dare to take it lightly.

Xia ruofei entered the spirit map space.

He directly arrived at the mountain and sea realm. The small mountain in the mountain and sea realm could no longer be called a small mountain. After the spatial realm had been upgraded a few times, the mountain was now rather lofty and precipitous. On the mountainside of the mountain, two oak barrels were placed at the entrance of the cave.

Inside were the two barrels of clear grape juice that Xia ruofei had brought back from Australia.

Xia ruofei was looking forward to the quality of the wine.

He had personally cultivated the grapes, and even the oak barrels had been built by the space’s high – Quality projects. In the end, the grape juice had been sent into the spirit map space. With so many unique conditions stacked together, these two barrels of wine were indeed something to look forward to.

Old West had already completed the part that required the most skills and experience. Xia ruofei had also inquired about the subsequent steps of brewing wine. He had entered the realm today to complete the final steps of brewing wine.

In fact, the fermentation process of white wine took at least a few weeks, while the fermentation of noble rot wine was even slower, often taking months or even a year. The process of ripening was even longer.

However, Xia ruofei now had array flags that could accelerate time by more than 90 times. Time was not a problem for him.

Xia ruofei waved his hand, and the array flags that he had kept in the mountain sea realm cave flew out. Immediately after, he used an invisible force to wrap around the oak barrel and the array flags and teleported to the time flow of the Archean realm, which was 30 times faster.

Then, Xia ruofei skillfully placed the array flags around the two oak barrels.

As Xia ruofei had a strong control over space, he could immediately feel the difference in the flow of time between the inside and outside of the formation.

Next, Xia ruofei returned to the mountain sea realm in a flash. He sat cross – legged at the entrance of the cave and waited.

Xia ruofei did this to maximize the effect of time acceleration.

The array could accelerate time by 90 times, and the original time of the Archean realm was 30 times. Xia ruofei had already tested it out. Although the combination of the two could not reach the theoretical limit, the effect of accelerating time was about 2000 times. This was a rather terrifying time flow.

A day in the outside world was equivalent to five to six years in the formation!

According to Old West, the best fermentation time for ordinary Semillon wine was about eight weeks.

Hence, Xia ruofei had calculated the time when he was in the mountain and sea realm. After about 40 minutes, he had returned to the Archean realm.

According to the flow of time, about 55 days had passed in the array, and the ordinary Semillon wine should have finished fermenting. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

As for the barrel of expensive rotten wine, Old West said it would take 11 months to ferment, which was still early. It would take about ten hours in the outside world. It was about 9:30 in the evening now, and the fermentation would be almost done by the time he got up the next morning.

Xia ruofei entered the formation in a flash. He opened the wooden barrel and used the wooden stick that he had prepared earlier to stir the barrel.

This was done to allow the dead yeast in the oak barrel to settle at the bottom of the barrel after fermentation. The winemaking workers would mix the dead yeast with the wine at a fixed time to make the wine more mellow.

This process was called barrel cultivation.

Every 10 minutes or so, Xia ruofei would enter the formation of the Archean realm from the mountain sea realm. He would then stir the dead yeast and mix it with the wine.

After stirring it for about five times, the cultivation process was basically completed.

Then, Xia ruofei returned to the mountain and sea realm. After waiting for about ten minutes, he allowed the wine in the barrel to settle down and clear up. The entire wine – making process was basically completed.

Xia ruofei retrieved the oak barrel from the formation, opened the lid, and started to bottle it.

Xia ruofei had asked Old West for the bottle when he was in Australia. Since he had already given Xia ruofei two buckets of grape juice, Old West naturally did not mind a few bottles and gave them to Xia ruofei as well.

Xia ruofei first looked at the oak barrel. The wine inside was golden in color and had a special wine fragrance that made people feel intoxicated.

He couldn’t help but use the invisible power of space to take a sip of the wine and closed his eyes to feel it.

The taste surprised Xia ruofei. The aroma of honey, oak, and preserved fruit was mixed together, and the layers were very distinct.

Although Xia ruofei was not good at wine tasting, he had drunk countless Semillon wines and could make a simple comparison.

At the very least, he could tell that the barrel of wine he had brewed was of a higher quality than the Semillon wine that he had left in the medium for a while.

Furthermore, this was a newly brewed wine. It had not even gone through the process of being ripened in the bottle, yet it had already reached such a level. Xia ruofei could be said to be quite satisfied.

He picked up a bottle, and with a thought, a stream of wine flew out of the barrel, drew a perfect arc, and accurately fell into the bottle. The whole process was quite effortless.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had filled the entire barrel with wine. Looking at the bottles of wine that were neatly arranged, Xia ruofei felt a strong sense of accomplishment. At the same time, he was looking forward to the expensive rotten wine that he would be able to harvest the next day.
