In fact, yang Jinsheng had taken the matter very seriously when yang Jianren had reported it to him a few days ago. After all, even song Qiming’s Secretary, Guangzhi Cao, was so polite to Xia ruofei.

Especially since song Qiming had just taken office, he did not know yang Jinsheng at all. Yang Jinsheng felt that he had to be even more careful when he could not figure out song Qiming’s temperament.

Therefore, the next day, yang Jinsheng took advantage of the opportunity when the organization Department sent a document to song Qiming’s office. He personally took the document to song Qiming’s office and reported to him about his recent work.

At that time, yang Jinsheng felt that although song Qiming was still very indifferent and not very enthusiastic, he did not show any obvious disgust.

Song Qiming even listened very carefully when he reported on the work. In the end, he even expressed his approval of the organization department’s recent work and gave a few instructions.

This made yang Jinsheng’s hanging heart relax by a large margin. If song Qiming really had an opinion of him, he would definitely not have such an attitude.

However, yang Jinsheng did not expect that just a few days later, bad news came from the province. His organization inspection had been temporarily halted.

Moreover, the provincial leader also vaguely said that it was suggested by the Secretary of the municipal government, song Qiming, and that Secretary Lin of the provincial Party agreed to it.

This made yang Jinsheng feel as if he had been struck by a bolt from the blue. The only thing he could think of was the matter with his son, yang Jianren.

Yang Jinsheng had never expected that it was actually just a fuse.

Moreover, most of the officials did not know that the relationship between the two secretaries was closer than they had imagined.

Regarding yang Jinsheng’s situation, first of all, Tian Huilan had her reservations, which was why song Qiming had made up his mind.

Under his father’s murderous gaze, yang Jianren lowered his head and told him what had happened that day in full detail.

Last time, he still had some reservations and avoided the important things and avoided the trivial things about his domineering plot. Today, he didn’t dare to hide anything and told her all the details he could remember.

When yang Jinsheng heard this, he was so angry that his entire body trembled. He pointed at yang Jianren and said,”You ... You unfilial son! You’ll only be satisfied when I’m dead, right?”

In fact, he knew that his son used his name outside and was arrogant and rotten. It was just that he didn’t cause any trouble in the past, so he would at most give him a few superficial lessons. But now that he had caused such a big trouble, he was naturally anxious and anxious.

Yang Jianren lowered his head and mumbled,””It might not be because of that person! Is he really that powerful?”

Yang Jin was so angry that he stood up at once. He raised his arm and then put it down hatefully, saying,””Do you have a pig brain? You’re causing trouble outside at such a critical moment! Who do you think can directly take down the organization’s evaluation index at this time? I’m telling you, this time, song Qiming personally gave the order!”

Yang Jianren suddenly raised his head and said,””It ... It’s really related to Secretary song?”

Yang Jinsheng glared at his son and said,””Tell me everything you know about Mr. Xia!”

“I ... I heard that his name is Xia ruofei, and he runs a farm in the suburbs ...” Yang Jianren stammered.

“Bullshit!” Yang Jinsheng rudely interrupted yang Jianren’s words and said,”how can a farm owner have so much power? You believe this kind of nonsense?”

“I ... I’ve already taught that he Dong a lesson and chased him out of the three mountains ...” Yang Jianren said.

“So what? We’ve already caused trouble!” Yang Jinsheng said.

“Dad,” yang Jianren mustered up his courage and said,”I gave in when I saw Guangzhi Cao being so friendly to him. But Xia ruofei didn’t even bother with me ...”

“Aren’t you talking nonsense? It’s all because of your stinky mouth!” Yang Jinsheng said.

Yang Jianren said submissively,”dad, maybe ... Maybe this isn’t as serious as we think?” It’s not time for department head Niu to retire yet!”

“You don’t understand ...” Yang Jinsheng waved his hand and said,”this time, it’s a batch of organization inspections, and the recent candidates for promotion are all concentrated inspections ...”

“Then ... Why don’t you ask Guangzhi Cao?” Yang Jianren said,”he’s your old subordinate after all!”

“That’s the only way ...” Yang Jinsheng sighed and said.

Then, he took out his phone, found Guangzhi Cao’s number, and called him.

“Director Cao, I’m yang Jinsheng from the organization Department!” Yang Jinsheng’s tone was very polite, and there was no trace of his previous reserve.

Guangzhi Cao was no longer the little Cao who had just been admitted into the organization Department, nor was he the little Cao who had been transferred to the Secretary Department and buried his head in writing materials all day long. He was now the Secretary’s personal secretary and the most popular person in the municipal Party Committee.

Moreover, yang Jinsheng had a favor to ask of him today.

Guangzhi Cao saw that it was yang Jinsheng’s number, and hesitated for a moment before answering.

“Hello, commander yang!” He said in a tone that was neither humble nor overbearing. Do you have any instructions?”

“My chief Cao! I wouldn’t dare to give you any instructions!” Yang Jinsheng smiled and said,”I do have something to ask you.”

“Please go ahead, commander yang.” Guangzhi Cao said.

His attitude was very appropriate, but there was a faint sense of alienation that kept people a thousand miles away.

Yang Jinsheng knew the reason behind this, but he could not care less now. He asked with a smile,””Director Cao, a few days ago, my Jianren had an argument with your friend at Xi Jiang Yue. I’ve already severely criticized him. I would like to ask you to help me settle it. Invite Mr. Xia out for a meal and give us a chance to apologize in person ...”

“Director yang, you’re too kind,” Guangzhi Cao said calmly.”It’s just a small argument between young people. Mr. Xia didn’t take it to heart. There’s no need for an apology.”

Guangzhi Cao was also cursing in his heart. Only an idiot would help you at a time like this. Even the Secretary had been alerted, how could this matter be settled? Back then, your son was so arrogant and domineering to the extent that he didn’t care. Now that he’s in trouble, you’re so anxious that you want to give in?

“Of course, of course. Jianren’s attitude that day was really too bad ...” Yang Jinsheng quickly said.

“Commander yang.” Guangzhi Cao interrupted him before he could finish,”Mr. Xia has already made his stance clear on this matter. I’m afraid I can’t help much. Do you have any other instructions? The Secretary needs some materials urgently ...”

“Oh ... Then you’re busy, then you’re busy. Sorry to bother you ...” Yang Jinsheng said dejectedly.

After hanging up the phone, he frowned. Yang Jianren, who was next to him, quickly asked,””Dad, what did Guangzhi Cao say?”

“He’s not giving in at all. He has no intention of helping at all ...” Yang Jinsheng shook his head and said. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“He’s too much!” Yang Jianren said angrily,”when we were in the organization Department, he was very respectful when he saw you!”

“Times are different now, don’t you understand?” Yang Jinsheng said in a bad mood,”it’s a favor that they helped. No one can say anything if they don’t help!”

“Then what do we do?” Yang Jianren was a little out of his wits.

Yang Jinsheng let out a long sigh and leaned back on the sofa. After a long while, he said in a low voice,””Didn’t you just say that elder Zheng from West River moon is also very close to that Mr. Xia? You ask someone to find out from him, we have to get a hold of the situation first! This person is the key!”

“Alright, I’ll get someone to do it immediately!” Yang Jianren said immediately.

“Also, have you cleared up your company’s accounts?” Yang Jinsheng frowned and asked,”go and sort it out again personally. Don’t leave any evidence behind!”

Yang Jianren asked nervously,”dad, it’s just the promotion that’s temporarily put on hold, right?” It can’t be that serious, right?”

“A storm is coming, wind is sweeping the building!” Yang Jinsheng let out a long sigh and said,”I have a feeling that things aren’t that simple. In any case, it’s better to be safe than sorry. You have to personally go through the accounts of these years. Find a way to wipe out all the funds that can’t stand the inspection! Also, during this period of time, you’d better keep your tail between your legs and don’t cause me any more trouble ...”

“Got it ...” Yang Jianren quickly said.

“Go! Hurry up and find out more about the situation!” Yang Jinsheng waved his hand disinterestedly.

He seemed to have aged a lot as he sat on the sofa.

……

Xia ruofei didn’t know that the conflict that day had caused so many chain reactions. After he returned to the farm with Lin Qiao, he started to prepare for the trip to Australia.

Although Lin Qiao hadn’t received the admission letter yet, it was basically a done deal. As a reward, she would have more time to travel if she redeemed it earlier.

Actually, there was not much to prepare. Xia ruofei just checked the air tickets online and booked the earliest flight to Sydney, Australia.

Considering that it was a night flight and the flight time was close to ten hours, Xia ruofei, who was not short of money, bought the expensive first – Class tickets. Two tickets cost nearly 40000 Yuan.

Xia ruofei had specially chosen this flight. It was the same flight as his last trip to Australia as this was the only direct flight in Sanshan city every two days. It took the least time on the way, while the other flights had to stop. The longest one would take nearly 24 hours.

The latest flight would take off at around 10 p.m. The next day and arrive in Sydney at about 9 a.m. Local time. The whole journey would take nine and a half hours.

The next morning, Lin Qiao, who was about to travel abroad with Xia ruofei, was very excited. She got up early and started to pack.

A mother would be worried when her son traveled a thousand miles. Furthermore, the two children were going out together this time. Therefore, Hu Zi’s mother had been nagging at her since early in the morning, especially Lin Qiao. She told her to listen to Xia ruofei when she was out and to be careful.

Xia ruofei spent the whole day with Lin Qiao’s excited anticipation of the journey and Hu Zi’s mother’s constant nagging.

At around eighto’ clock in the evening, Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao packed their luggage and got into Lei Hu’s Mercedes – Benz under Hu Zi’s mother’s urging. They went straight to the Changping International Airport in Changping County.
