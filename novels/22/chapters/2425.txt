2426 Sense of urgency (2)

Otherwise, he would have left in the middle of the night without any hesitation after capturing Liu chengfeng.

Xia ruofei held the crystal in his hand and cleared his mind of all the distracting thoughts. He quickly entered a state of cultivation.

The “great Dao Arts” was a top – tier cultivation technique. Although it focused on building the foundation in the early stages and did not involve much actual combat content, it was still the most suitable cultivation technique for Xia ruofei.

With the “great Dao Arts” as the main cultivation and the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” as the supplementary cultivation, in addition to the large amount of cultivation resources at hand, Xia ruofei’s cultivation had improved rapidly.

Liu chengfeng’s sudden appearance had given Xia ruofei a sense of urgency.

He didn’t know much about the modern cultivation world. In addition, the cultivation environment on earth was so harsh that he had hardly met any other cultivators in the past two years. Therefore, he had always had a more Buddhist attitude when it came to cultivation and didn’t have a strong desire to improve.

Liu chengfeng’s appearance made Xia ruofei feel a sense of danger.

Although the cultivation world was declining day by day, their strength was still not to be underestimated.

Xia ruofei’s current cultivation was far from being invincible. Moreover, he was alone. Even if Li Yifu, Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and even Tang Haoran were to be considered, they wouldn’t be considered a powerful force. When he encountered a sect like the fallen leaves sect, he had no chance of winning.

Xia ruofei also believed that as the cultivation of himself and the people around him increased, it was inevitable that he would have to deal with people in the cultivation world.

Cultivators like Liu chengfeng were very likely to be a typical example of greed in the cultivation world, who would do anything to improve their cultivation.

Compared to the world of ordinary people, the rules in the world of cultivation were obviously more realistic and crueler. The law of the jungle was an irrefutable truth here.

Of course, Xia ruofei didn’t want to become the ‘weak’ in the cultivation world because of his lack of cultivation.

Moreover, he had a super treasure like the spirit map space. If there was a slip – up in any part of the process and the news was leaked, the entire cultivation world would definitely rush over like a cat that had smelled the fish. With his current cultivation, he would definitely not be able to resist it.

An ordinary man is innocent, but he is guilty of treasuring a treasure.

As long as his cultivation reached a level that no one else could match, then even if the whole world knew that he had a rare treasure like the spirit map painting scroll, no one would be able to take it away from him.

Xia ruofei cultivated with such thoughts.

His cultivation had already reached a small bottleneck. Once he broke through, he would be refined Qi level 9.

Xia ruofei decided to work hard on his cultivation and at least break through this small realm.

While cultivating, one could not feel the passage of time.

It was not until the next morning, when the sun shone on his body, that Xia ruofei slowly opened his eyes.

The clothes on his body were already wet from the dew, but his entire person was refreshed.

After a night of cultivation, he felt that his cultivation had improved a lot. Refined Qi level 9 was already close at hand. He felt that he had touched the bottleneck of that level. Perhaps he only needed an opportunity to break through in one go.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied with the results of his cultivation.

He stood up and moved his hands and feet while releasing a trace of true Qi to dry the water on his clothes.

Then, Xia ruofei left the mountain.

After walking for a while, Xia ruofei arrived at the trail of the pagoda Park. There were already some people jogging there.

Xia ruofei jogged down the mountain like a person doing his morning exercise. He greeted the runners with a smile.

After leaving the pagoda Park, Xia ruofei hailed a taxi and returned to Chang ‘an city.

He had bought a plane ticket back to Beijing with his mobile phone while he was in the car.

There were still about three hours before the plane took off, so Xia ruofei asked the taxi driver to drive directly to the airport.

After changing his boarding pass, Xia ruofei had a simple breakfast at the airport. It was not too early. It was already past nine in the morning.

After that, he passed through the security check and waited for a while in the VIP lounge before boarding.

Xia ruofei had booked a first – Class ticket for the return trip. The journey was smooth, and there were no bumps. After three hours, the plane landed smoothly on the runway of the Capital International Airport.

After Xia ruofei left the airport, he found a place to change into his original appearance and then took a taxi back to the courtyard house in liuhai Lane.

Xia ruofei had just returned to the master’s courtyard. He was about to take a shower, close the door, and go to the medium to deal with the staff. Just as he took off his coat, his phone rang.

Xia ruofei had left his phone on the coffee table in the living room when he entered.

He reached out and easily took the phone. He glanced at the caller ID and saw that it was song Rui.

Xia ruofei picked up the call. Before he could say anything, song Rui asked,””Have you heard?”

Xia ruofei was confused and asked,””Heard what? Did you just wake up in the afternoon? You speak without thinking ...”

Song Rui was not in the mood to argue with Xia ruofei. He said directly,””Liu haojun is dead!”

“What?” Xia ruofei pretended to be surprised and raised his voice.

“Liu haojun! The eldest grandson of the Liu family! He’s the one who just left the southeast province!” Song Rui said,”he died! Last night ...”

“What’s the situation?” Xia ruofei said,”it can’t be ...”

“How is that possible? That grandson doesn’t know how to be afraid of death!” Song Rui said disdainfully,”he was killed by someone! The technique was quite professional! He dodged the ribs and cut his heart with a sharp blade ... Tsk tsk! Who knows how many people this guy has offended ... He’s already been sent to Shaanbei, but he still won’t let him go and wants to take his life. How much hatred does he have?”

Of course, song Rui wasn’t feeling sorry for Liu haojun’s death. On the contrary, his tone more or less had a hint of gloating. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re really well – informed!” Last night’s incident happened in xiabei province. You actually found out so quickly and even knew so many details!”

Xia ruofei had personally witnessed the entire process of Liu haojun’s death. Naturally, he knew that song Rui’s information was very accurate.

In just one night and half a day, the news had already spread like wildfire in the capital’s circle.

Xia ruofei felt that the Liu family had intentionally spread the news. If the Liu family had wanted to hide it, this matter would not have been spread.

Perhaps the Liu family wanted to show the song family that they had done what they had promised.

Moreover, it should more or less carry some resentment, and could also win some sympathy.

Now Xia ruofei knew that people like old master Liu would squeeze everything dry, no matter what it was, even if it was the news of his own grandson’s death.

Song Rui laughed and said,”What is this?” I’m known as an all – knowing scholar in the circle, so there’s nothing that can be hidden from me! Liu haojun, this grandson, used to be very arrogant! He thought that he had a bright future ahead of him, so he looked down on us good – for – nothing scions. I didn’t expect that in just a few months, our official careers would be cut off, and then we’d even lose our lives. How pitiful ...”

Xia ruofei said,”song Rui, stop gloating!” Also, don’t get involved in Liu haojun’s matter! We don’t care what others say, but don’t get involved! We just have to do our own things well and earn our money! Also...We have to learn from the fact that we’re always being treated like a joke, or we’ll become a joke in the eyes of others sooner or later!”

Song Rui was stunned for a moment and said,”ruofei, why do you speak like my dad today?” I’m just sharing some happy things with you, why are you being so serious?”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”song Rui, listen to me. From now on, don’t discuss Liu haojun’s matter. Don’t spread it either. I can’t tell you the reason. Just pretend you don’t know.” If you don’t believe me, you can go back and ask Grandpa song. He’ll definitely ask you the same thing!”

Liu haojun’s death was more or less due to elder song’s personal pressure. Although the Liu family was in the wrong first, he was dead after all. If song Rui continued to talk about this matter in a high – Profile manner, the Liu family would definitely hate the song family even more. Song Rui might even be at a disadvantage. Hence, Xia ruofei thought of this and immediately reminded song Rui.
