2989 Firecloud pill (1)

In private room 20, Xia ruofei’s expression was still very relaxed, while Luo Qingfeng’s brows were tightly knitted.

In fact, when the spirit Vulture mountain began to bid, Luo Qingfeng felt that it would be more difficult to buy the pair of storage rings at a relatively reasonable price. Now, he saw that the spirit Vulture mountain seemed to be at odds with Xia ruofei. Basically, as long as Xia ruofei raised the bid, the spirit Vulture mountain would raise the bid without hesitation as if they did not care about the spiritual stones at all. Luo Qingfeng was even more anxious.

Xia ruofei remained calm and composed. He looked at the big screen and saw that the first bid was 48500 spiritual stones. He pondered for a while and directly entered 50000 spiritual stones into the bidding machine to round it up. Then, he submitted it.

As a matter of fact, Xia ruofei had plenty of spiritual stones now. He did not really care whether he would spend 30000 or 50000 spiritual stones to buy the storage rings. He believed that even if they were to compete in wealth, the spirit Vulture mountain would not be able to compete with him even if they went all out. Therefore, there would not be any surprises in the final ownership of the storage ring.

In room 15, Luo Feng held Wu Ming’s hand and advised him earnestly,””Young sect leader, you can’t raise the price any higher ... This price is already high enough. If you continue bidding, the star Seizer sect might not want it anymore ...”

“Isn’t that great?” Wu Ming flung Luo Feng’s hand away and said impatiently,”I didn’t do all this just to play with them! If they don’t want it, then I can just buy this pair of storage rings, right?”

“Young sect leader, we really can’t spend our spirit stones on this Phoenix ring!” Luo Feng said,”young sect leader, the past few rounds of bids have already cost the star Seizer sect a lot of spirit stones. You should be able to vent your anger now, right? Let’s just stop while we’re ahead!”

“Uncle Feng, I told you not to get involved in this!” Wu Ming said coldly,”if my father blames me after we go back, I’ll bear all the responsibility. I won’t make things difficult for you!”

“It’s not a matter of who will bear the responsibility ...” Luo Feng said helplessly.”That treasure is related to the future development of the sect ... Forget it. Since young sect master already has an idea, then I won’t say anything more. You do as you see fit!”

Luo Feng sat down on the sofa with waning interest. He knew that Wu Ming would definitely not listen to his advice, so he might as well not be the bad guy. Anyway, Wu Tiancheng and Ren suling also knew what kind of character their son had. They wouldn’t be able to blame him when they returned.

Wu Ming said with a cold face,”uncle Feng, just let me be willful this once!” If that brat from the star Seizer sect is really willing to spend eighty thousand spirit stones to buy this pair of rings, then I’ll admit defeat. Otherwise, I can tell you right now that it’s impossible for you to make me give up!”

Luo Feng nodded his head powerlessly and simply leaned back on the sofa, closing his eyes to rest.

Wu Ming then entered a price in the bidding machine and clenched his teeth to submit the bid.

55000 spirit stones!

When the new price was displayed on the big screen, the cultivators who participated in the auction all thought that the people of the Ling Jue mountain were crazy.

The price of 50000 spiritual stones was already quite high, but now he had added another 5000 spiritual stones to it!

After Wu Ming submitted the price, he even said loudly,””That brat from the star Seizer sect! If you want this pair of storage rings, you’ll have to go through your Grandpa Wu! Even if I had a spirit stone in my pocket today, I would add it without hesitation! Or you can just admit defeat now and give me this pair of rings!”

In room 20, Luo Qingfeng was furious when he heard this.

This Wu Ming actually addressed himself as ‘Grandpa Wu’. If this rich second generation was Xia ruofei’s grandfather, then wouldn’t he be Luo Qingfeng’s ancestor?

“Bastard!” “Is this how Wu Tiancheng teaches his son?” Luo Qingfeng cursed.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and laughed.””What’s there to be angry about with a hothead? Besides, their status was not on the same level! If you have anything to say, say it to his father in the future. This kind of devilish child needs to be taught a lesson. Find a chance to give him a deep lesson so that he will remember it!”

“Master, this bastard’s mouth is too smelly ...” Luo Qingfeng said indignantly.

“Ignore him!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

After Wu Ming submitted his bid, he looked at the big screen above the main auction stage triumphantly and thought to himself,”as long as you dare to follow up, I will increase the bid without hesitation!” There’s nothing much I can do with 80000 spirit stones anyway, so I might as well have some fun with you!

Seeing that room 20 had not raised the bid for a long time, he could not help but shout,””Hey! Why is there no movement? Could it be that he was scared by my offer? If you’re so timid, how are you going to survive in the world of cultivation?”

Luo Feng almost couldn’t help but cover his face. They didn’t even bring a single spirit stone when they came to the auction, and now they have two or three times more spirit stones than you. How could you scare them off? He was just wondering if it was worth it to spend so many spirit stones on a pair of storage rings.

However, Luo Feng didn’t stop Wu Ming. On the contrary, he was secretly hoping that Wu Ming could enrage the other.

This was because only in this way would the other party bid desperately. In this way, Wu Ming would definitely not be able to win against the other party in the end. Wouldn’t that mean that the 80000 plus spirit stones would be safe?

“Master!” Luo Qingfeng was so angry that his face and neck turned red. As long as Xia ruofei gave the order, he would definitely rush to room 15 and teach Wu Ming a lesson.

Xia ruofei laughed. He didn’t operate the bidding machine and directly said,””The star Seizer sect offers fifty thousand spirit stones ...”

Hearing this, Wu Ming was slightly stunned at first, then he held his stomach and laughed. He said breathlessly,””Are you out of your mind? Or was there something wrong with her eyes? I’ve already raised the price to 55000 spirit stones! You’re offering 50000 spirit stones ... Haha! Could it be that your spirit stone is more fragrant?”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”where did this fly come from?” I haven’t even finished my words! You’re just so noisy!”

Xia ruofei immediately raised his voice and said,””Elder Hao, please communicate with the fellow Daoist who entrusted the auction of this pair of storage rings. Our star Seizer sect is willing to offer 50000 spirit stones, in addition to five firecloud pills ...”

As soon as Xia ruofei said this, many cultivators in the private rooms couldn’t help but be moved and started to discuss.

“Firecloud pill? Isn’t this the best medicine for repairing damaged meridians?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“To be more precise, it’s the best medicine to repair the damage to the meridians caused by cultivating water or ice attribute cultivation techniques!”

“Yes, yes, yes! The fire cloud pill and the ice cloud pill were both known for their outstanding effects of repairing meridians. However, hadn’t this medicinal formula been lost long ago? There are only a few firecloud pills left in the cultivation world, and they were excavated from ancient ruins a few years ago. It’s said that most of their medicinal properties have already been lost, and they should’ve been used up long ago ...”

“This year, the star Seizer sect has truly exceeded everyone’s expectations! Those bottles of Chi – amassing pills were also put up for auction by them, right?”

“Could it be that the star Seizer sect has recruited a Grandmaster Alchemist? Or did they discover the complete ruins of ancient cultivators and excavate the long – Lost formulas and cultivation Arts from them? Don’t forget that they even brought out the “the true linglang Scripture”!”

“Tsk tsk tsk! The star Seizer sect is going to soar to the heavens!”

……

In private room 6, Liu Mansha and Yang Liu, who had been watching the show, were also taken aback when they heard this. They then looked at each other.

“Interesting!” Liu Mansha said with a smile. The Chi – amassing pill and the firecloud pill are not real pills, but I think only the star Seizer sect is capable of producing such pills in the current cultivation world ...”

“Senior Sister, I’ve never seen Luo Qingfeng’s junior Brother Xia before!” Yang Liu said,”the star Seizer sect is causing such a huge commotion. I guess it has something to do with him!”

“I’m 80% sure ... Junior Sister, this young man Xia Tian ... What do you think his background is?”Liu Mansha nodded.

“Origins? Isn’t he from the star Seizer sect?” Willow said, slightly stunned.

“That’s not what I meant ...” Liu Mansha said.”You see ... Luo Qingfeng called him Junior Brother, but Luo Qingfeng’s master died decades ago. At that time, he wasn’t even born this summer! He’s definitely not Luo Qingfeng’s junior Brother. He’s just calling him that!”

“Senior Sister, you mean ... To live in seclusion ...” Yang Liu shut her mouth halfway.

Liu Mansha nodded and said,”it looks like it!” A lost cultivation technique, a lost medicinal formula, and a treasure that can conceal one’s cultivation ... Furthermore, I’ve never seen this summer before. It’s as if he suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Don’t you think he’s similar?”

Willow pondered for a while and nodded,””Now that you mention it, senior apprentice – Sister, it does seem like...In that case, there might be a nascent soul cultivator behind the star Seizer sect ...”

“Be careful with your words!” Liu Mansha interrupted Yang Liu in time and said,”let’s see! In short, do not rashly engage in any conflict with the star Seizer sect. It’s a good thing that we’ve been getting along well with the star Seizer sect, but the spirit Vulture mountain ...”

“Wu Tiancheng is really bold. He actually let Luo Feng come out with his silly son. That Luo Feng can’t suppress Wu Ming at all!” Willow chuckled.

……

In room 15, Wu Ming shouted loudly,””What bullshit firecloud pill is this? Just use the spirit stones to talk, who knows what your firecloud pill is ...”

...

“Young sect master!” Luo Feng quickly said. If they really do have firecloud pills, they’ll be very valuable!”

Then, Luo Feng quickly explained the situation of the firecloud pill to Wu Ming.

“Even if that’s the case, do you really think five mere firecloud pills are worth 5000 spirit stones?” Wu Ming asked, his lips twitching.
