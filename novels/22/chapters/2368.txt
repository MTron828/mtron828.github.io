2369 The search for Satan (2)

Aruray was not a popular tourist spot, and there were not many tourists in the temple. Although the parking lot was not big, there were still many empty spaces.

After Xia ruofei parked the car, he walked towards the entrance of the temple.

He still maintained his Southeast Asian look, carrying a backpack, wearing sunglasses, and a single – lens reflex camera hanging around his neck. He took photos as he walked, looking like an ordinary backpacker.

Xia ruofei bought the tickets at the entrance. He could use us dollars to buy them. 10 US dollars for a ticket was not very expensive. However, compared to the local income level, the local people could not afford it.

Compared to the famous Egyptian and Mayan temples in Africa, Egypt temple of arulei was naturally insignificant, but it also had a strong ancient Egyptian characteristics. The temple built of sandstone had been weathered for thousands of years, and the appearance was a simple light yellow, with a sense of history.

The entire temple was built facing the east where the sun rose. The outermost part was a “divine path”, and on both sides were statues of lions and sheep heads.

Xia ruofei looked at the English introduction at the front of the divine path with great interest. In ancient Egypt civilization, the lion – bodied RAM was the incarnation of the sun god. This divine path faced the East and symbolized the first ray of sunlight that welcomed the sun god Amon.

At the end of the divine path was a thick door wall. After passing through the door wall, there was a large pillar Hall. The four walls were heavily weathered, and the contents could no longer be seen clearly. However, it still had a strong sense of history.

The pillar Hall was connected to the second door wall, and then it was another slightly smaller Hall.

Xia ruofei walked around as he entered the temple. After that, he was not allowed to take any more photos.

The layered design of the temple gave off a mysterious and deep feeling.

After passing through three halls, Xia ruofei could see the main body of the temple, the Holy Temple of Xuanji.

The temple wasn’t particularly large, but it had a strong sense of history. There were a large number of embossed and murals around the hall. However, the relief sculptures on the sandstone had long been destroyed by the erosion of the wind and sand for a thousand years.

Even so, it still looked exquisite on the whole, and one could vaguely feel the artistic attainments of the ancient people a thousand years ago.

There weren’t many tourists in the temple, and they were all in groups of two or three, so it was very quiet.

Xia ruofei raised his head to admire embossed with great interest. Of course, his spiritual power had already spread out and started to search the temple inch by inch.

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard a surprised voice behind him.””Xia! You’re also here!”

Xia ruofei could not help but be stunned. He had already changed his appearance. This appearance was neither Xia Tian nor Xia ruofei. Why would someone call out his surname?

Could it be that someone was able to see through his means of changing his appearance?

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Mutter in his heart. However, he remained calm and turned around with a puzzled expression. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

When he saw the person behind him, a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes, but it quickly disappeared. He then regained his confusion.

The person who called out to him just now was the black man he had just met when he was in Ethiopia. This man worked in a Chinese company in arulei and called himself a “spirit Chinese.”

Xia ruofei had a deep impression of Daka.

When Xia ruofei turned around, Decca rubbed his eyes and smiled awkwardly. He spoke in English with a heavy accent,””My friend, I’m sorry, I got the wrong person! Your back looks very much like my friend ‘s!”

Xia ruofei immediately understood. It turned out that Daka had mistaken him for the Xia Tian identity that he had used when he entered arulei.

Xia Tian’s identity was a fake, so when Xia ruofei changed his appearance again, he did not deliberately change his figure, walking posture, etc. It was not impossible for Dhaka to recognize him as Xia Tian when he saw his back.

Xia ruofei needed to find Satan as soon as possible. Although Dhaka was an interesting black fellow, he would not interact too much with him now.

This was because this young man had the attribute of being easy to get to know. After chatting with him for a while, he would become familiar with him, and it would not be so easy to shake him off and act alone.

So, Xia ruofei just smiled and nodded. He changed his voice a little and said in English,””It’s okay ...”

He even deliberately added some Southeast Asian accent in his English.

Xia ruofei turned around and prepared to leave.

Unexpectedly, Decca was naturally enthusiastic and immediately said,””Sir, are you from Asia? If you don’t mind, we can tour the place together. I know more about the temple of arulei, I can explain it to you!”

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”I’d rather walk around by myself.” Thank you for your good intentions, goodbye!”

“Alright then!” Darka shrugged and grinned at Xia ruofei.”Goodbye!”

He was used to being friendly to people, especially when he saw people from Asia. Since the other party did not appreciate it, he naturally would not rush to get close to them.

Daka looked at Xia ruofei’s back as he turned to leave. He could not help but Mutter to himself,””It seems a little unreasonable! My new friend Xia Tian isn’t like this ... As expected, we Chinese are more approachable ...”

Daka spoke in Chinese. Although his voice was not very loud, Xia ruofei had not gone far, so he could hear everything clearly with his hearing.

Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud. This dark – skinned young man really had a heart! The country should issue him a green card and even help him become a citizen ...

Xia ruofei held back his laughter and walked out from the side door of the Holy sanctum. He went around to the back of the Holy sanctum.

This place was not originally within the temple’s boundaries, but a small building was built later on, mainly for the work of the temple’s staff.

There was a small yard behind the building, and the high priest of the temple lived there.

This was actually a very strange position. After thousands of years, the temple was no longer responsible for the function of sacrifice. It had become a tourist attraction, but the position of high priest was still retained.

Moreover, this high priest had not been replaced for twenty years.

In theory, the high priest was the Supreme Leader of the temple.

Xia ruofei’s target was the high priest, who rarely came out.

Xia ruofei was very surprised when Boak the Viper revealed that Satan’s hidden identity was the high priest of arulei temple.

Although the high priest was no longer in charge of sacrifices, his status in arulei was still quite high, and he had a lot of prestige.

Xia ruofei did not expect that the high priest and the notorious leader of the Morde organization were the same person.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he was very confident in the hypnotism effect, he would have suspected that beac was just spouting nonsense to confuse him.

Xia ruofei pretended to be a tourist. He looked around and released his spiritual power to the courtyard behind the White office building.

There weren’t many tourists here, and the back of the temple was even quieter.

They could not even see the staff, so no one came to remind Xia ruofei that they were no longer in the tourist area.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to search forward. He also inadvertently approached the small courtyard behind the office building.

His spiritual power had not found anything, but Xia ruofei felt a slight warmth in his chest.

He was stunned for a moment, and he still couldn’t believe it.

Xia ruofei had always been wearing the sensing Jade Leaf on his body. The only function of this sensing Jade Leaf was that it would heat up when he was near the realm stone.

In that case, there were actually world stones nearby?

Xia ruofei did not expect to have such a surprise on this trip to Africa.

To confirm this, he even took a few more steps forward.

The heat from the Jade Leaf immediately increased a little.

Xia ruofei had basically confirmed it. Without any hesitation, he removed the seal on the spirit map space.

The moment Xia ruofei removed the seal, he heard Bai Qingqing’s voice in his head, trembling with excitement,””Hurry up! I’ve found the world stone! The response is very strong!”
