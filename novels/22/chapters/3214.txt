3215 The black Phoenix flying ship (2)

Scholar Yuntai paused for a moment and continued,””Therefore, in the early years, there were still people who wanted to explore the outside world, but as we learned more and more about outer space, such suicidal behavior has never appeared again. Of course, cultivators above the primordial soul realm can survive half a day to one day in that kind of environment without any problem. Therefore, most of the cultivators who have reached the primordial soul realm will go out and take a look out of curiosity. ”

Xia ruofei said,”I understand ... In other words, if you fly up directly on your sword, you can also fly out of the Earth’s atmosphere and into outer space.” It’s the same for flying ships, right?”

“Almost!” Scholar Yuntai said,”however, your question just now is whether a magic treasure like an airboat can fly in outer space for a long time. How should he put it ... It depended on what kind of airboat it was! As I’ve said, it’s very harsh outside. Sometimes it’s extremely cold; sometimes it’s extremely hot. If you’re unlucky, you might be attacked by flying rocks. Therefore, ordinary airboats might not stand that long ...”

Speaking of this, layman Yuntai asked again,””By the way, since you have my storage ring, you should have already obtained my Black Phoenix flying ship, right?”

Xia ruofei almost burst into tears. Master Yuntai finally remembered his black flying ship. After such a long time, he finally knew the name of the treasure. It was called the black Phoenix flying ship.

“So it’s called the black Phoenix flying ship! It’s a good name indeed!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ve been wanting to ask you a few times, but you went into seclusion after a few words. I haven’t had the time to ask you for advice!”

“Hahaha!” Grandmaster Yuntai laughed awkwardly and said,”little brat Xia, since the black Phoenix flying ship is in your hands, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to ride it and explore the world. Do you know what the greatest advantage of the black Blaze flying ship is?”

The black Phoenix flying ship was the proud work of master Yuntai and he only had Xia ruofei to communicate with. Hence, when the black Phoenix flying ship was mentioned, he couldn’t help but want to show off.

Xia ruofei was obviously a good sidekick. He asked,””Could it be that his greatest strength is his speed?”

Xia ruofei had been on the first heaven society’s Clearwater flying boat before. When he compared it to the black Phoenix flying boat, he could clearly feel that the black Phoenix flying boat was much faster than the Clearwater flying boat.

“No, no, no!” Scholar Yuntai repeatedly denied it. “The black Phoenix flying ship’s speed can only be considered above average. In the cultivation world, there have been some people who were known for their speed, but they were much faster than the black Phoenix flying ship!”

“Then this junior doesn’t know. Senior, please give me some guidance!” Xia ruofei said humbly.

Scholar Yuntai proudly said,”its biggest feature is its defense!” I’ve specially searched for precious obsidian crystals and forged it with 18 types of precious ores. At least in the era I lived in, I’ve never seen a flying – Type magical treasure that’s stronger than the Obsidian flying ship! “As I’ve said earlier, the environment in outer space is extremely cold and hot. Furthermore, we might be attacked by flying rocks from outer space. An ordinary flying ship would not be able to hold on for long under the alternating effects of extreme cold and extreme heat. However, the black Phoenix flying ship would definitely not have such a problem!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but reveal a trace of joy and said,””In that case ... Taking the black Phoenix flying ship to the moon and searching for the mystic realm mentioned in the music piece is a feasible plan?”

Scholar Yuntai also stopped blowing his own trumpet and quickly said,””Little brat Xia, are you really going to the moon?”

“Didn’t senior also say so? The disappearance of the token means that the validity period of the message transmitted by the token is not long. If there is really a Mystic realm on the moon, then the location of the exit may change soon. So, we naturally have to go to the moon to investigate as soon as possible!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I was just saying that the black Phoenix flying ship should have no problem adapting to outer space. Even in the extreme cold and heat, it should be able to ensure that it won’t be damaged. I’ve once steered the black Phoenix flying ship away from earth and stayed outside for two days, but the black Phoenix flying ship was completely undamaged!” Said layman Yuntai.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue. He wasn’t shocked by the black Phoenix flying ship’s thick skin. He was shocked that master Yuntai could be exposed to outer space for two days. Were all primordial soul realm cultivators so strong?

Obviously, the words of Yuntai weren’t meant to show off that he could survive in outer space for two days without any external equipment. Therefore, he quickly changed the topic and said,””Little brat Xia, if you’re going to the distant moon, transportation is only one aspect. More importantly, you have to be able to survive in such a harsh environment for a long time! You must know that there’s no air outside. A primordial soul Stage cultivator can go days without breathing, but you, a golden core stage cultivator, can only last for two to four hours. Furthermore, a few days is not enough for you to travel from earth to the moon! It was far from enough! In addition, the extremely cold and hot environment that I mentioned just now is not only a test for the airboat, but also for the passengers of the airboat. In my opinion, at least you, a Jindan stage rookie, can’t survive in such an environment!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I will find a way to solve these problems one by one. I’m not stupid enough to go to my death for a secret realm that might exist. It’s obvious that I can’t return.”

“It’s good that you know!” Layman Yuntai said,”you are a smart person. I believe that even if I don’t say anything, you will not do anything stupid!”

Speaking of this, layman Yuntai immediately said,””By the way, when I said that the black Phoenix flying ship can travel in outer space for long periods of time, that was just my speculation. After all, I’ve never tried to let it fly for more than ten days, a month, or even a few months in a row.”

“I believe in senior’s professional judgment.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Scholar Yuntai was a master of refining in his own era. Xia ruofei trusted his judgment of flying magical equipment.

“The moon is at least a few hundred thousand miles away. No one knows what will happen or what dangers we will encounter on the way.” Scholar Yuntai solemnly said,”no one has ever tried to go to the moon before, so everything is unknown. I can’t guarantee that the black Blaze flying ship will be able to shoulder such a heavy responsibility. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”at least senior gave me more confidence. You let me know that the black Phoenix flying ship’s defense is top – notch. That’s enough.” The path of cultivation was like sailing against the current and changing one’s fate. How could it always be smooth sailing and peaceful? If he dodges every time there’s danger, I don’t think he’ll have any great achievements in cultivation! Therefore, this trip to the moon can not be guaranteed to be foolproof, but it must be done!”

After a moment of silence, layman Yuntai said,””Little brat Xia, you’ve really taught this old man a lesson! In that case, I also support you to explore the moon! Of course, you must first take care of the problem of protection, which is the problem of extreme cold, extreme heat, and breathing I mentioned. Otherwise, no matter how confident you are, you won’t be able to hold on for long. Lofty aspirations can’t be eaten!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry, senior!” I’m thinking of a way to solve this. Didn’t I tell you before? The development of modern technology can sometimes solve problems that cultivators can’t solve. This time, we may have to rely on modern technology to solve it. ”

“It’s good that you can consider these problems and come up with a solution. ” Scholar Yuntai said,”in that case, I’ll go into seclusion for a while!”

Closed up again? Xia ruofei couldn’t help but complain in his heart.

This Yuntai senior was really a closed – door cultivation madman!

Yuntai fell silent, but he quickly said,””Don’t worry! I don’t want to miss out on your magnificent feat of exploring the moon. Remember to let me know when the time comes. It would be best if I could also appreciate the magnificence of the Dark Universe!”

Xia ruofei was shocked by the sudden turn of events by scholar Yuntai. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”No problem. When the time comes, I’ll release all the barriers, and you can use your spiritual power to appreciate it ...”

“Hahaha! Thank you in advance!” Scholar Yuntai laughed.

Then, there was really no more sound.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to sense and confirmed that the closed – door cultivation madman, master Yuntai, had really entered a state of closed – door cultivation.

Xia ruofei then took out the satellite phone from the spirit map space and skillfully dialed a few numbers.
