2533 A crazy suggestion (2)

After Jiang Xiaochen heard this, he gradually calmed down. He was no longer as agitated as when Ruby said that he wanted Xia ruofei to be a signed player of the club. He touched his chin and pondered.

Ruby continued,”Mr. Jiang, I don’t need Mr. Xia’s physical fitness to play the entire game. I don’t even need him to form any effective cooperation with the other players. I don’t need Mr. Xia to participate in the team’s defense. He only needs to take the free kick for the team. That’s enough!” So, I’m not particularly concerned about how long he can last in the game with his physical fitness. In addition, I’ve seen his dribbles and free kicks. From the perspective of a professional coach, Mr. Xia’s sense of the ball is still very good. After he comes on, he only needs to roughly stand in his position and restrain the opponent in the defense. He doesn’t need to really participate in the defense. Then, when the team gets a free kick, he will stand up and take the free kick. It’s that simple!”

After Jiang Xiaochen watched the video of Xia ruofei’s free kick that Ruby had spent the whole night editing, he let out a long breath and said,””Coach Ruby, I admit that I’m a little moved by what you said, but ... This is too crazy! I ...”

“Teacher Jiang, how would you know without trying?” Ruby said,”this won’t affect Mr. Xia at all. How do you know he won’t agree if you don’t try?”

“Alright!” Jiang Xiaochen nodded. I’ll go ask Mr. Zhou for instructions!”

After saying that, Jiang Xiaochen couldn’t help but Pat his forehead and say,””I really don’t know if my decision is right or wrong! I might be scolded badly by Mr. Zhou. If I lose my job, you have to compensate me for my loss ...”

Ruby revealed a smile and said,””That won’t happen, Mr. Jiang. You’re Mr. Zhou’s right – hand man. Even if he doesn’t agree with the proposal, he won’t fire you. But if it’s a success, it’ll be a stable point for the team!”

In a small and medium – sized club like RCD Espanyol, if there was a player who had a high success rate of free kicks, the effect would be very good. In many crucial games, the score difference might only be one goal, and even this one goal could be the key to determining the situation of staying in the league.

Jiang Xiaochen smiled bitterly.”Even if this crazy idea is realized, don’t expect Mr. Xia to play for the team many times. He still has a big company in China to manage. It’s impossible for him to fly to Spain every two or three days.”

“I understand! I understand!” Ruby hurriedly said.

“Alright, you can go back to your work!” Jiang Xiaochen said,”I have to think about how to report this to Mr. Zhou ...”

“Mr. Jiang, I’ll leave it to you then!” Ruby said, then turned around and left Jiang Xiaochen’s office.

Jiang Xiaochen hesitated for a long time before finally deciding to report to Zhou leiyun in person.

There were some things that couldn’t be explained clearly over the phone, and he wanted to play the highlights Ruby had edited last night for Zhou leiyun. It was only after he had seen the highlights that he had been tempted.

What Jiang Xiaochen did not expect was that when he rushed to Zhou leiyun’s Manor in the wealthy district of Barcelona, he found that not only was Zhou leiyun there, but Xia ruofei was also a guest.

Zhou leiyun saw Jiang Xiaochen and said with a smile,””Xiaochen is here! Is there something you need?”

Jiang Xiaochen looked at Xia ruofei, who was at the side, and hesitated.

Zhou leiyun could not help but frown.”Why are you still hemming and hawing? Don’t you know that President Xia is an outsider? What’s the matter? hurry up and say it!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”director Zhou, maybe manager Jiang wants to report something about your company’s secrets!” I think I’d better leave first!”

“Don ‘t! Don’ t! Aren’t you slapping my face?” Zhou leiyun quickly said,”where would there be so many company secrets? President Xia, you stay here and don’t go anywhere!”

Jiang Xiaochen was only in charge of the Spanish club’s work and did not participate in other matters of shengshi group. How could there be any confidential information that Xia ruofei could not hear? Furthermore, Xia ruofei was one of the major shareholders of the club. Strictly speaking, Xia ruofei had the right to know everything that Jiang Xiaochen knew.

Zhou leiyun then looked at Jiang Xiaochen with a slight frown and said,””Xiaochen, what’s wrong with you today? He was so wishy – washy that he didn’t seem like a man! Was there anything in the club that President Xia could not hear? Bullshit!”

Jiang Xiaochen quickly replied,”no!” No! Please don’t misunderstand ...”

Jiang Xiaochen knew that he had to say it today. Otherwise, he would offend Zhou leiyun and Xia ruofei as well.

However, Xia ruofei’s real body was here, so Jiang Xiaochen’s prepared excuses were useless.

He could only bite the bullet and say,”director Zhou, director Xia, I ... The matter I’m reporting is related to director Xia ...”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel curious. He smiled and asked,””Related to me? Tell me, what’s the matter!”

Jiang Xiaochen said,”that ... First team head coach Ruby suggested to me that we could ... Could ... Bring in President Xia!”

“What? I don’t understand. ” Zhou leiyun furrowed his brows and asked,”what do you mean by ‘bringing in President Xia’?”

“I hope to sign a contract with President Xia and let him become a registered player under the club.” Jiang Xiaochen made up his mind and said it directly.

Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun looked at each other in disbelief.

Xia ruofei asked,”manager Jiang, what is coach Ruby thinking?” This brain hole is too big ...”

Jiang Xiaochen quickly explained,”director Xia, coach Ruby has taken a fancy to your excellent free – kick skills!” In addition, he also said that you don’t need to stay in Spain for a long time, and you don’t need to play in every game. It’s just that you can go on the field and take a free kick during the key period of some key games. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”this requirement is too low!” Just because I sent off a few free kicks yesterday, you decided to sign me? Wasn’t this a little too rash?! If our club’s recruitment standards are so low, then in the future ...”

“You’ve misunderstood, President Xia!” Jiang Xiaochen quickly explained,”coach Ruby didn’t make this decision rashly. He spent almost the entire night analyzing the video highlights of your free kick and even edited a video clip himself. I brought it over ...”

As Jiang Xiaochen spoke, he turned on his tablet and played the highlights that Ruby had edited. At the same time, he also played Ruby’s analysis of Xia ruofei’s technical characteristics.

After reading it, Zhou leiyun raised his eyebrows and said,”Xiaochen, I wouldn’t have realized it if you didn’t mention it ... President Xia’s free kicks are almost exactly the same! No wonder Ruby couldn’t help it, haha!”

In fact, Xia ruofei was secretly impressed by the coach’s unique vision.

He had deliberately controlled the first nine free kicks yesterday, so the arcs and angles of the free kicks were so close. However, not everyone could see this.

Ruby edited the video of the nine free throws from the same angle together, and it became very direct.

Jiang Xiaochen looked at Xia ruofei nervously and said,””President Xia, the team still has a non – European Union player spot. If you can ...”

“Xiaochen, you don’t have to say anymore!” Zhou leiyun waved his hand and interrupted Jiang Xiaochen.”What’s your status, President Xia? He could play off the field, but how could he really go on the field to play professional football? You go back and tell Ruby to stop here and don’t even think about it!”

Jiang Xiaochen had actually been mentally prepared before he came. He knew that the success rate of this matter would not be very high, but when he heard Zhou leiyun’s words, he still could not help but feel disappointed.

“I understand, director Zhou ...” Jiang Xiaochen nodded.

He sighed to himself and closed the tablet. He bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and Zhou leiyun and was ready to leave. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Just then, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””Wait a moment!”
