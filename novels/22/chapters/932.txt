Tan Lili was also dazed when she heard that Lin Qiao came to Australia in first – Class.

She was a prideful person and had bragged about her ‘vacation’ in Australia to her classmates many days in advance. She didn’t expect Lin Qiao to come to Australia without a sound and even take the most luxurious first – Class cabin.

Tan Lili thought about how she was squeezed in the economy Class, where she couldn’t even straighten her legs, and how she had to transfer planes twice. It took her more than 20 hours to reach Australia. She couldn’t help but feel aggrieved and looked at Zheng Peng resentfully.

In fact, her relationship with Lin Qiao in school was quite ordinary. They didn’t even add each other on WeChat. Otherwise, she would not only see the luxurious first – Class cabin in Lin Qiao’s circle of friends, but also the photo of Lin Qiao and the world – Class star Jennifer.

If tan Lili knew that Lin Qiao and Jennifer were as close as sisters, she would be so shocked her jaw would drop.

Zheng Peng was not in the mood to hit on the pretty girl. He took tan Lili and said goodbye to Yang Ying before leaving the Hunter Valley Garden.

The two of them sat in Zheng Peng’s Ford, and neither of them was in the mood to talk.

Zheng Peng was rubbing his wrist as he drove. Not only did he lose face today, but his wrist was also swollen from Xia ruofei’s grip. He was full of resentment.

After a long while, Zheng Peng finally couldn’t stand tan Lili’s resentful look and couldn’t help but say,””Lili, don’t be unhappy ...”

“Hmph! I’m just not happy! Other than being good at studying, what else is better than me? Why does she have such good luck to find a rich and doting boyfriend?” Tan Lili pouted.

Zheng Peng thought to himself, she’s not only good at her studies, but she’s also prettier than you!

However, he definitely wouldn’t say this out loud. He just smiled and said,””Hey! It’s her business if she’s lucky. We just have to live our own lives! Besides, it was hard to say whether her boyfriend had money or not! There are so many people who are pretending to be good these days ...”

Tan Lili was so angry that she couldn’t help but glare at Zheng Peng and said,””Then why don’t you slap yourself in the face and pretend to be fat for once? Besides ... You don’t have to slap yourself in the face to buy a first – Class ticket, do you? I’m so tired that I’m almost paralyzed from the journey!”

“And ...” Tan Lili couldn’t help but glance at Zheng Peng and ask,”what’s wrong with you today?” You can’t move after seeing a beautiful woman, right? I’m telling you, if you dare to let me down, I ... I’ll die in front of you!”

Zheng Peng was annoyed. If it wasn’t for the fact that tan Lili was quite obedient in bed, and he hadn’t made friends with other women recently, he really didn’t want to coax this vain woman.

However, he wasn’t tired of playing with her yet, so he still had to coax her when he needed to.

While driving, Zheng Peng reached out to touch tan Lili’s little hand and said,””Li Li, don’t be angry! I’m only talking to her because she’s your classmate. With her thin and small body, how can I be interested? I still prefer the mature and plump type like you!”

“Really?” Tan Lili looked at Zheng Peng with red eyes and asked.

“Of course it’s true!” Zheng Peng was lying through his teeth.

Then, he said,”baby, don’t be angry anymore!” Haven’t you always been living a life of the upper class? There’s a high – Class reception tonight, I’ll Take You There to see ...”

“Really?” Tan Lili’s interest was piqued. She glanced at Zheng Peng and asked,”are you not afraid of your parents?”

“They went to Canberra today for business,” Zheng Peng said indifferently.”I’m the full representative of the winery, so isn’t it normal to bring a female companion?” Just tell me if you want to go or not!”

“Of course I want to go!” Tan Lili was overjoyed and didn’t bother to be angry with Zheng pengxuan.

She even leaned over and kissed Zheng Peng on the face, saying sweetly,””My dear, thank you ...”

……

In the Mercedes – Benz, Liang Qichao said while driving,””Oh right, ruofei, I’m afraid you’ll have to attend the party tonight.”

After saying that, Liang Qichao took an invitation from the console and handed it to the person in the back.

Xia ruofei was puzzled.”You’re the person in charge of Paradise Farm. No matter how high the standard of this party is, it’s enough to have you attend!”

“Why don’t you open it and take a look?” Liang Qichao said, grinning.

Xia ruofei opened the invitation in confusion. Then, he realized that the invitation was for West Winery.

“Uncle Carter sent this to the farm this afternoon,” Liang Qichao said.”He and Auntie caitley will be flying to Melbourne in the afternoon and won’t be able to attend the party. So, they’ll have to invite you, the boss behind the scenes, to attend!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it doesn’t matter if you attend this kind of reception, right?” The West Winery is about to face a business transformation, and its main market may not be in Australia in the future. ”

At this moment, Lin Qiao snatched the invitation from Xia ruofei’s hands and glanced at it,””Brother ruofei, why don’t you go? I can eat and drink for free, and I don’t even need to give anything. Just take it as going to see the world!”

“Free gift ...” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Come on, come on ...” Lin Qiao shook Xia ruofei’s arm and said,”I’ve never attended such a high – end party before!” Take me there to gain some experience!”

“Brother Liang, can I bring a female companion?” Xia ruofei asked helplessly.

“Of course!” Liang Qichao said,”if Lin Qiao were to participate, she would definitely outshine those foreign girls!”

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao with affection and said,””Alright! Then let’s go together. ”

“Yay! Brother RUO Fei is the best!” Lin Qiao raised her arms and cheered.

Xia ruofei was also helpless against Lin Qiao. He shook his head with a bitter smile. Since she wanted to go and have fun, he would go. Anyway, there was nothing to do at night. Moreover, the night at Paradise Farm was very quiet. It was indeed a bit lonely for young people.

It was no wonder that Liang Qichao had said that Paradise Farm’s environment was good for traveling and vacation. If they stayed here for a long time, they would really be unable to stand it.

The evening’s reception was held at the bogolbins pise Vineyard Hotel in the Hunter Valley area. This hotel was only a 20 – minute drive from Paradise Farm, so Xia ruofei and the others had plenty of time.

Formal attire was necessary for an event like a banquet.

Xia ruofei had a ready – made set of clothes. When he went to Shen Cheng to participate in the truffle auction, MA Xiong had asked someone to prepare two suits from Italy’s high – end men’s clothing brand Brioni in advance. Each suit was sold for more than 5000 US dollars, so it was more than enough for Xia ruofei to attend such an occasion.

Moreover, this brand’s suits were not as well – known as big brands like Versace and Armani. Even the LOGO was embroidered on the inner lining of the clothes. If one was not very familiar with high – end custom – made brands, one would not be able to see it. It was rather low – Key, which suited Xia ruofei’s style.

Lin Qiao was just a high school graduate, so she didn’t wear formal clothes. But that wasn’t a problem.

The Hunter Valley area was a tourist destination, so there were naturally various shopping centers. As the rich in China had increased in recent years, some luxury stores that catered to the interests of the Chinese had emerged. It was easy to buy a suit.

On the way back to the farm, they turned into a shopping mall and bought an evening dress for Lin Qiao after trying it on several times.

The evening gown was a ready – made one from Chanel, so Youyou would be using it tonight, so she definitely wouldn’t have time to tailor make it.

However, after careful selection, this evening dress was very suitable for Lin Qiao.

After everyone returned to the farm, Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao went back to their rooms and strolled around the Hunter Valley Garden for a long time. They all wanted to take a shower first.

Clothes make the man. Xia ruofei usually liked to dress casually and casually. However, after changing into a well – fitting high – end suit, his entire aura was completely different from usual.

It was somewhat reserved and luxurious, and at the same time, that lazy smile gave people an inexplicable sense of friendliness.

Girls always took a longer time to get dressed. Xia ruofei and Liang Qichao waited for another half an hour before they heard footsteps coming from the stairs.

Xia ruofei looked up at the stairs and met Lin Qiao’s eyes.

When they saw each other, their eyes lit up.

It was Lin Qiao’s first time seeing Xia ruofei dressed so formally. When Xia ruofei, who was wearing a dark gray suit, glanced at her, she felt her heart racing.

When Xia ruofei saw Lin Qiao in the evening gown, he couldn’t help but feel amazed.

Although the evening gown was chosen together with Xia ruofei, Lin Qiao had just finished her bath and put on the dress. She put on the crystal shoes and her aura was completely different from when she tried it on in Chanelle’s boutique.

She was wearing a white tube top dress with a short velvet shawl coat. The delicate side of the dress showed off her fair legs. She wore a Lotus – colored top hat on her head, and under the brim of the hat were her clear and bright eyes and curved eyebrows. The girl’s lovely temperament had a touch of playfulness.

Her long eyelashes trembled slightly. Because of Xia ruofei’s gaze, the young girl’s face showed a trace of shyness.

Looking at Lin Qiao, who was like a fairy, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dazed ...
