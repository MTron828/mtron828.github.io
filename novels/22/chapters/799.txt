Chapter 800: I’m always too soft – hearted_1

The policeman was stunned for a moment. This wasn’t Captain Qin’s style!

Qin Xiao Yu was famous for her persistence in principles. In this case, according to the procedure, he must take a record. If Qin Xiao Yu had seen this kind of bargaining in the past, she would have taught him a lesson in a righteous manner. Why was he acting so abnormally today?

Did the sun rise from the West?

The police officer looked at Xia ruofei and Qin Xiaoyu and suddenly remembered that Qin Xiaoyu was on rotation today. Could this man be Captain Qin’s boyfriend? The two of them were out on a date today, and they caught a wanted criminal?

The police’s gaze became a little strange. Qin Xiaoyu was undoubtedly a beauty. When she first came to the Sanshan City Bureau, there were several police officers who thought that they were good enough to pursue her.

But after a long time, Qin Xiao Yu’s valiant style was slowly familiarized by everyone, and the suitors gradually knew the difficulties and retreated, even in the hearts of these subordinates, they almost regarded Qin Xiao Yu as a man.

Captain Qin is in love? This was big news!

The fire of gossip was burning in the police officer’s heart, but fortunately, he was still rational. He knew his captain’s temper, so he did not dare to show it. He just nodded and held back his laughter. He went to help the other colleagues take Huang Chunhua in.

Xia ruofei was also surprised. Did Qin Xiaoyu change her personality today?

Xia ruofei’s gaze made Qin Xiao Yu a little uncomfortable. She couldn’t help but glance at Xia ruofei and said unhappily,””What are you looking at?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Officer Qin, I’m done here. I’ll go back first!”

With that, Xia ruofei turned on the car key and was ready to leave the police station.

“Wait a moment!” Qin Xiao Yu called out.

......

Xia ruofei stopped shifting and turned around.

Qin Xiao Yu came to the driver’s seat of the pickup truck and said with a slightly embarrassed look,””Xia ruofei, I have something to discuss with you.”

Qin Xiao Yu had always talked to Xia ruofei as if she had eaten gunpowder. This sudden change in attitude and soft tone made Xia ruofei feel a little scared.

He couldn’t help but shiver and said,””Officer Qin, let’s talk this out ...”

“How did I not say it properly?” Qin Xiao Yu couldn’t help but rebut Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief and said,””Yes, yes, yes, this is the feeling. This Is the Police officer Qin I’m familiar with!”

Qin Xiao Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, she couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””You ... Aren’t you being a bit cheap? I feel uncomfortable talking to you properly, so I have to scold you a few times before I feel comfortable!”

“That depends on the person! “If my wife acts coquettishly to me, I’ll gladly endure it. As for officer Qin ...” Xia ruofei looked at Qin Xiao Yu and smiled without saying the rest of the sentence.

Qin Xiao Yu glared at him and said,”go!” Who’s acting coquettishly with you! You ... I’ve almost forgotten about my business! Where was I just now?”

“You said you had something to discuss with me.” Xia ruofei said. He thought of Qin Xiaoyu’s embarrassed look just now and couldn’t help but feel a chill.”Wait! You’re not being forced to get married by your family, are you? you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend and use me as your shield! Let me make this clear first! I definitely can’t come ...”

Qin Xiao Yu looked at Xia ruofei with a strange expression, as if it was her first day knowing him.

Xia ruofei shrunk his neck and asked,””Don’t tell me I’m right?”

“To your head!” Qin Xiao Yu gritted her teeth in anger,”you’ve watched too many soap operas, right? Besides, if there’s really such a thing, I’d look for anyone but you! There are so many handsome guys in the Public Security Bureau, don’t you think you’re too good?”

Xia ruofei let out a long sigh of relief and said,””It’s good that you’re not, it’s good ...”

Qin Xiao Yu looked deeply at Xia ruofei and said with a faint smile,””Xia ruofei, from your tone ... It’s not fair for you to be my boyfriend! Am I really that unbearable?”

“No, no, no...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”officer Qin is so valiant and heroic. A commoner like me can’t handle him. I’m not worthy of him!”

Qin Xiao Yu snorted lightly and no longer harped on this topic. She bit her lower lip gently and then said in a slower tone,””Xia ruofei, I want to discuss with you ... About your dog. Can you sell this Black Dog to me?”

Today, Xiao hei had saved Qin Xiao Yu’s life at a critical moment. Qin Xiao Yu had a deep impression of Xiao hei’s strength and fierceness, and felt that Xiao hei was much more powerful than those police dogs, so she had the idea of buying it back and raising it at home.

If they were raised well, they would be a great help in handling cases in the future! Moreover, he didn’t need to apply for a police dog and could bring it out directly. It was beautiful just thinking about it!

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”You’ve been beating around the bush for so long. You’ve finally fallen for my Blackie!”

“What do you think?” Qin Xiao Yu’s tone was unfriendly.”Would I still like you?”

“I’m not even as good as a dog?” Xia ruofei said with a bitter face.

Qin Xiao Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter. She was a beauty to begin with, and her smile was even more charming, making the police officers in the courtyard stunned. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They had never seen Qin Xiaoyu smile like this before, it seemed that this pickup driver really had something going on with Captain Qin ...

The policemen looked at Xia ruofei in a different light. He could even deal with Captain Qin, who was such a fierce Overlord flower. This brother was too awesome!
