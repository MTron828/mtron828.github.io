3003 Blue water flying boat (2)

This was the first time Xia ruofei had seen someone else in the cultivation world with spiritual crystals.

The first heaven society was indeed rich. It cost three spiritual crystals to drive the flying boat, which was worth 3000 spiritual stones.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”it seems that even though the cultivation world is short of resources, the top sects don’t lack resources ...”

This was a very realistic thing. The cultivation world was also a pyramid structure. The few elites at the top of the pyramid occupied the vast majority of resources, while the large number of low – Level cultivators at the bottom could only fight for the remaining resources, struggling bitterly in this cruel world of cultivation.

After inserting the spiritual crystal into the console, the first heaven society disciple skillfully made a hand seal.

The mysterious runes on the control panel lit up like an airplane’s dashboard in the mortal world.

Then, this disciple of the first heaven society gently pulled a jade handle on the left side of the main control console. The blue water flying boat trembled slightly, and then began to rise slowly.

“Young sect master, are we heading to the star Seizer sect?” The disciple of the first heaven sect who was controlling the flying boat asked.

“En!” Chen Xuan nodded. We’re flying directly to the star Seizer sect!”

“Yes!” The disciple controlling the flying boat said.

At this time, the Bluewater flying boat had already flown more than ten meters above the rooftop. The disciple who was controlling the flying boat moved another jade handle on the right side of the main control console. The huge Bluewater flying boat immediately turned slowly in the air, and then the disciple pushed the last handle in the middle up ...

Xia ruofei felt that the Clearwater flying boat seemed to have stopped for a moment. Then, its speed suddenly increased several times and it suddenly rushed in one direction.

The feeling of being pushed was much stronger than when he was on a plane.

However, the people on the blue water flying boat were all cultivators, so this level of stimulation naturally did not affect them at all. While the blue water flying boat was accelerating, they were still sitting in their seats, talking and laughing, looking very relaxed.

Xia ruofei observed for a while and realized that the speed of the blue water flying boat was not slower than that of sword Kinesis flight.

The operation of this flying boat was also very simple. After activating it with a spell, it could be completely controlled by the three controllers on the main control console. The method was also very simple. The left controller controlled the height, the right controller controlled the direction, and the middle controller controlled the speed.

This design was actually very clever. As long as the flying boat was started, even low – Level cultivators could fully control the Pixiu. Cultivators who could use such a high – end means of transportation naturally enjoyed the ‘driver’ service. If they had to control it themselves, it would more or less seem a bit low – Class.

The designer of the blue water flying boat had obviously thought of this.

Cultivators were indeed very happy to have such a divine weapon.

Just think about it, when others were riding their flying swords, they would consume their vital Qi, and they would be in direct contact with the strong wind outside. Of course, cultivators would put up a protective shield when they were riding their flying swords. No matter how strong the wind was, it would not affect the cultivator’s hairstyle ...

Although it cost a bit of spiritual crystals to use the blue water flying boat, it didn’t consume spiritual energy at all. Moreover, when others were struggling to ride the sword, the people who used the flying boat could sit in the comfortable cabin to cultivate. The difference between the two was huge.

Xia ruofei looked at other people’s airboats and suddenly felt a little disdainful of the sword Kinesis flight that he was so proud of. As for the private plane, it must be even more low – end compared to this airboat ...

The jadewater flying boat was very fast, silently crossing the sky in the night.

It was dark outside, but the cabin was very bright. Xia ruofei did not see any obvious light source, but the entire cabin was covered in a very soft white light. The white light was very natural, as if it was daytime.

Although the airboat was fast, it was very stable. It didn’t even have the turbulence that was commonly encountered by airplanes.

Like a magic trick, Chen Xuan took out an exquisite purple sand tea set from a secret compartment beside his seat. He used a red clay stove to boil some mountain spring water, then took out a small box of tea leaves and prepared to make tea for everyone.

Mu Sheng took a look and his eyes lit up. He asked,””Fellow Daoist Chen, is this your sect’s wild tea?”

Chen Xuan smiled and said,”sect leader mu, you’re indeed knowledgeable!” This tea is indeed picked from the wild tea tree on Tianyi peak, which was baked by my father’s own secret method. ”

“We’re in for a treat now, haha!” Mu Sheng said happily,”little brother Xia, you may not know. The first heaven society’s wild tea leaves were considered top – notch in the cultivation world! Although the name was ordinary, the tea leaves were definitely the best of the best. Moreover, there was only one wild tea tree on Tianyi peak, so the annual production was pitifully small! Even if you go to the first heaven society, sect leader Chen rarely brings out wild tea to serve his guests. Fellow Daoist Chen is indeed much more generous than his father!”

Seeing that Mu Sheng was making fun of his father again, Chen Xuan wisely shut his mouth and concentrated on using a wooden spoon to pick up seven or eight tea leaves and pour them into the tea set.

As soon as Xia ruofei heard Mu Sheng’s words, he knew that this wild tea was a bit similar to Da Hong Pao. They were all tea leaves picked from wild tea trees. The quality was excellent, but the quantity was scarce.

Although Xia ruofei had never tasted the tea leaves of the Da Hong Pao mother tree, he had tasted the second – generation Da Hong Pao tea leaves produced from the tree’s branches countless times. Furthermore, the second – generation Da Hong Pao tea leaves had been nourished by the rich spiritual energy in the spirit map space all year round. The quality of the tea leaves produced might have long surpassed the Da Hong Pao mother tree ‘s.

This “Da Hong Pao” in the world of cultivation had successfully piqued Xia ruofei’s interest.

He smiled.”I usually drink a lot of tea. However, this is the first time I’ve seen such precious wild tea. I’ll have to taste it later.”

Even though Xia ruofei said that, he couldn’t help but Mutter to himself when he saw Chen Xuan throwing in seven to eight tea leaves. So little? How could this be enough? Yet, sect leader mu actually said that Chen Xuan was much more generous than his father. Could it be that when sect leader Chen brewed tea, he only added one or two tea leaves?

Mu Sheng seemed to have read Xia ruofei’s mind. He laughed and said, Fellow Daoist Xia, don’t think that fellow Daoist Chen only used a small amount of tea. In fact, it’s enough. You’ll know when it’s done!

Hearing this, Xia ruofei also looked at Chen Xuan curiously.

The moment Chen Xuan poured the boiling Spring water into the teapot, an extremely rich aroma of tea wafted through the air. Just a deep breath of the aroma of the tea was enough to make one feel as if they were floating in the air.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be shocked. If the fragrance of the tea alone could reach such an extreme level, what level would the tea be?

Of course, Xia ruofei drank tea often and naturally knew that the fragrance of tea was not enough. Moreover, a strong fragrance did not necessarily mean that it was delicious. Some tea had a fragrant aroma when it was brewed, but once the tea entered one’s mouth, it would be a great disappointment.

However, it was the first time Xia ruofei had smelled such an alluring tea fragrance.

Chen Xuan’s fingers were fair and slender, and his movements were extremely fluid. Every single movement was as natural as floating clouds and flowing water. When they were linked together, there was a unique rhythm to it that caused one’s heart to become calm and peaceful.

If a classical beauty were to be added to the scene, it would be many times more exciting than those paid tea performances.

Very quickly, Chen Xuan finished brewing the tea and poured it into tea cups. Using specially made bamboo cups, he placed the tea in front of everyone. Extending his hand, he made an inviting gesture and smiled,””Fellow Daoists, please have a taste!”

Naturally, Mu Sheng did not stand on ceremony. He picked up the tea cup in front of him, smelled the tea, and showed a look of enjoyment. Then, he drank the tea in one gulp, closed his mouth and nose, and even closed his eyes. After a long time, he opened his eyes and looked at Xia ruofei as if he had not had enough.”Little brother Xia, quickly try it! It’ll definitely leave you with an endless aftertaste ...”
