Translator: 549690339

“I understand!” Pang Hao said. Ruofei, I won’t say anything else. Since this brother trusts me so much, then I’ll definitely keep an eye on the money bag of our paradise Corporation!”

“This is right!” Xia ruofei finally smiled and said,”this is the attitude I want! I’m not asking for your opinion today, I’m just informing you! Don’t you dare think of leaving!”

Pang Hao was one of Xia ruofei’s few good friends in middle school. Besides, Xia ruofei knew him very well and trusted him absolutely. He had to help such a good brother.

Xia ruofei did not wish for his Good Brothers to fall behind one by one when the company’s scale grew bigger and bigger, including ye Lingyun and the Veterans.

Pang Hao revealed an excited expression and said,””I understand! Don’t worry about the finance department, ruofei!”

Xia ruofei nodded with relief and said,””If you really feel that you’re lacking in ability, you can also apply for further studies. You can pick any of those famous schools overseas! The company will be responsible for all your expenses!”

“If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll definitely go there for further studies!” Pang Hao replied,”but not in the near future! Since the company is going to start restructuring and set up a branch company, the finance department will also have to be separated from each other. There’s too much work, and I won’t be able to leave for a few months. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”then let’s wait until we have some free time!” By the way, little fatty, the company’s reshuffling is still in a confidential stage. Just keep it in mind and don’t spread it around!”

“Alright! I’ll definitely keep my mouth shut!” Pang Hao said.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei ended the conversation with pang Hao. The two of them were good friends, so they did not have to make any requests or make any hopes.

Just as pang Hao was about to stand up and leave, he suddenly thought of something and plopped back into his seat.

“Ruofei,” he said,”Guanping doesn’t seem to be very happy in the company recently ... He came to me for a drink last week and complained!”

Guan Ping was Xia ruofei’s classmate who was working as a real estate agent in a second – hand house trading company. When Xia ruofei bought the villa on the farm, Guan Ping had been busy with all the relevant procedures and helped Xia ruofei settle them for free.

At that time, the landlord of the villa was overseas, so he entrusted a friend in the country to manage it. Xia ruofei still remembered that the agent, Zhao Xueqing, was quite good – looking and Guanping seemed to be interested in her.

Xia ruofei had once extended an olive branch to Guan Ping, but at that time, Guan Ping’s job was quite stable. Moreover, the income of the second – hand real estate agency was not bad in recent years, so he did not take the initiative to work at peach blossom company. Xia ruofei could not keep asking.

After that, Xia ruofei was busy with the company’s Affairs and they did not contact each other as much as before.

However, from pang Hao’s words, it seemed that he had quite a few connections with Guan Ping.

When they were still studying, Xia ruofei, pang Hao, and Guan Ping were the closest to each other. To Xia ruofei, the only classmates who still kept in touch after graduation were pang Hao and Guan Ping.

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””This kid never told me! Do you still treat me as your brother?”

Pang Hao laughed.”You can’t blame Guanping. You’re usually too busy, always running around. Even I rarely see you in the company. He might be too embarrassed to disturb you!”

“Bullshit!” Xia ruofei said,”I think this kid is treating me as an outsider! Later, you can arrange for the three of us to have a meal together. I have to give him a good scolding!”

“Alright!” Pang Hao said,”I’ll try to arrange for everyone to get together before the new year. Just the three of us!”

Pang Hao knew that as long as he mentioned it, Xia ruofei would definitely take it to heart. By then, he would not need to say anything. Xia ruofei would naturally come out to help Guan Ping.

The Paradise Corporation was developing rapidly and there were many jobs that were lacking. Guan Ping was Xia ruofei’s good friend and he was quite capable himself, so he was very suitable for the sales position at the Paradise Corporation.

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”let me know the time after you’ve made the reservation. I’ll arrange the place!”

“Understood!” Pang Hao nodded and said,”then I’ll take my leave first!”

With that, pang Hao stood up and left Xia ruofei’s office.

In the next few days, the Human Resources Department of paradise Corporation began to get busy.

They began to draw up various evaluation tables, and then went down to various departments, farms, and pharmaceutical factories to conduct staff evaluations.

At the same time, there was also a group of people working overtime to check everyone’s files. From time to time, someone would receive a notice to check the information or to fill in the information.

The people below were also discussing animatedly. Some said that this was in preparation for the year – end bonus; Some said that this was to promote a group of people to middle – ranking leadership positions. In short, there were all kinds of speculations.

However, most of the speculations were on the bright side. After all, the company was developing well, the employees were working hard, and the internal atmosphere was harmonious. It was unlikely that there would be layoff or other negative news at this time.

Xia ruofei, Feng Jing, and the others were aware of the discussion, but they did not interfere as long as it did not affect the order of work.

In fact, including Xiao Qiang, pang Hao, and several people who were going to be promoted to the director of the new department and the leader of the branch, they were all aware of the company’s possible actions. However, they were asked to keep it a secret, so they could not disclose it to their subordinates. They just wanted everyone to work with peace of mind and not be distracted by these things.

Time flew by, and it was soon the new year.

The annual meeting of the Paradise Corporation was held as scheduled in the grand banquet hall on the third floor of the Shangri – La hotel.

Apart from the necessary staff on duty and the workers at the pharmaceutical factory who ensured the production line ran, most of the employees of paradise Corporation came to attend the Annual Meeting.

There were more than 20 tables in the big banquet hall. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course, the employees who could not attend the Annual Meeting could also get a number on top of the high overtime pay. They could also enjoy the lucky draw benefits at the annual meeting.

As for whether he could win the grand prize or only the general award, it would depend on his character.

The banquet hall had been redecorated in advance, with many logos of the Paradise Corporation set up. There was also a huge spray – painted background board on the stage. In addition to the Paradise corporation’s LOGO and some of the main products ‘images, there was also a line of striking big words: “paradise corporation’s New Year Meeting.”

The company’s executives were all dressed to the nines. Xia ruofei had also changed into a hand – made suit that was only worn for formal occasions. His well – proportioned and strong figure was set off by the custom – made suit that was exquisite in every detail, making him stand out even more.

At around Sixo’ clock in the evening, the employees began to enter the venue.

Before entering the venue, everyone would receive a lottery ticket. When they entered the venue, the secondary ticket had already been placed in the lottery box.

Tonight’s Annual Meeting had a lot of lucky draws. Although no one knew what the prize was, everyone knew that Xia ruofei was a generous boss. It was the company’s first annual meeting and the prizes would definitely not be shabby.

Therefore, everyone was looking forward to it. After taking their seats, they looked around and greeted those familiar with them while discussing in low voices.

Xia ruofei also got along with the staff and greeted them with a smile and a nod from time to time. The annual meeting had not started yet, but the banquet hall was already filled with a joyous and harmonious atmosphere.

Xia ruofei was talking to Feng Rao in a low voice when a few more people entered the banquet hall.

He looked up and couldn’t help but reveal a trace of surprise, looking quite surprised ...
