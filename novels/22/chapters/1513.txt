Chapter 1514: A huge harvest (1)

Translator: 549690339

After Xia ruofei had kept all 12 world stones, the White realmfox also eagerly gathered the small pile of world stones that belonged to it and began to chew on them.

Just like how the realm Fox felt when it saw Xia ruofei put away the realm stone, Xia ruofei’s heart ached when he saw the realm Fox eat the precious realm stone.

However, since both parties had agreed on it, Xia ruofei would not stoop so low as to snatch it from the mouth of the realm Fox.

The realm Fox chewed on the realm stone as if it was chewing on ice. Xia ruofei started to size up the small cave.

The moment Xia ruofei entered the cave, all his attention was drawn to the pile of boundary stones on the stone platform. Now that he looked around carefully, he realized that other than the most conspicuous stone platform, there was a statue at the innermost part of the cave.

The sculpture was about three meters tall and had the image of a middle – aged man with a beautiful beard. The middle – aged man wore red armor and held a long halberd in his hand. He had an awe – inspiring aura.

Especially that pair of eyes, no matter which angle one looked at it from, it had a kind of soul – stirring feeling, as if this wasn’t a sculpture, but a real person.

In front of the statue, there were two boxes, one big and one small.

Xia ruofei tried to use his spiritual power to investigate but found that once his spiritual power touched the surface of the box, it would be immediately repelled. It seemed that the box had the effect of shielding spiritual power.

Xia ruofei’s interest was piqued.

He carefully used his spiritual power to examine the surroundings of the sculpture, but he did not find the existence of any array. There was not even the most basic array pattern.

Hence, Xia ruofei strode towards the sculpture and squatted down in front of the slightly larger box.

The box was made of wood, but it was hard to tell what kind of wood it was. The dark brown box was glowing and looked very strong, giving people the feeling that it was made of Ironwood.

The box was not locked. Xia ruofei carefully reached for the handle and lifted it up.

The box was opened without any accidents.

What Xia ruofei saw were pieces of crystal – like objects that were neatly arranged. Each piece had a standard diamond – shaped structure and looked crystal clear.

Xia ruofei was slightly disappointed at first because there were no new world stones as he had expected.

However, on second thought, if there were realm stones here, the realm Fox would not have remained indifferent until now. Even when he walked over, the realm Fox did not even bat an eye and continued to enjoy its ‘delicious food’.

Then, Xia ruofei grew interested in these diamond – shaped “crystals”.

To be able to be stored in a box and protected by such a complicated formation, these “crystals” should not be ordinary.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to ask Xia Qing, Xia Qing, who was in the spirit map space, couldn’t help but exclaim,””Crystals! It’s a spirit crystal!”

Xia Qing was only a soul puppet, but Xia ruofei could feel the strong surprise in his voice.

“Spirit crystals?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion,”Xia Qing, what are spiritual crystals? Are they spirit stones?”

“How can spirit stones be compared to spirit crystals, master?” Xia Qing asked. Let’s put it this way! Spirit stones are only stones that contain a certain amount of spiritual Qi and are helpful for cultivators “cultivation. Although they are relatively rare, spirit stones with slightly less spiritual Qi can still be found.”

“What about the spirit crystals?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Spirit crystal ... It can be said to be a spirit stone with 100% spirit Qi!” Xia Qing said,”in fact, spirit crystals are formed when the spirit Qi is extremely dense. The spirit Qi in the spirit map world has already reached the extent of turning into mist. If the concentration continues to increase on this basis, it will form liquefied spirit Qi ...”

“So, spiritual crystals are products of extremely high concentration of spiritual Qi, which causes the spiritual Qi to solidify?” Xia ruofei’s voice trembled.

“Yes, I am!” Xia Qing said excitedly,”after the spiritual energy is solidified, it will definitely form a rhombus shape. Every piece of spiritual crystal contains a huge amount of spiritual energy. For example, if we extract all the spiritual Qi in our spirit map world and compress it, we can only form one or two spiritual crystals at most!”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. He was very clear about the concentration of spiritual Qi in the spirit map space. Every once in a while, he would go into the space to cultivate. The reason was that the spiritual Qi concentration in the space was too high compared to the barren environment outside.

He had once dreamed that one day, he would be able to cultivate in such an environment all the time, and his cultivation would definitely advance by leaps and bounds.

He didn’t expect that such rich spiritual Qi could only form one or two spiritual crystals.

The box in front of him was full of crystals!

With a casual glance, one could tell that there were at least 100 spiritual crystals inside!

This was simply an incomparably huge amount of wealth. In fact, it was even more than the 12 world stones he had just obtained.

“Xia Qing, are these spirit crystals good for the spirit map world?” Xia ruofei asked in a trembling voice. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Xia Qing said,”master, the spirit map world can’t directly absorb external spiritual energy, but it is very beneficial to master’s cultivation. The cultivation environment now is extremely poor. Even if master cultivates at midnight and dawn, the effect is not obvious. If you hold a piece of spirit crystal while cultivating and directly extract the spiritual energy contained in it to cultivate, the effect will naturally be different.” In this way, you don’t have to wait for midnight and dawn every day. With spiritual crystals in hand, you can cultivate at any time!”
