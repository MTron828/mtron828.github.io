2808 There’s such a move?_

For Espanyol, the feeling of killing bar?a in nokapu was even stronger than entering the European battle.

Of course, getting the unexpected three points in this game would also have a great impact on their advancement to the UEFA Europa League next season.

Many of the bar?a fans at Camp Nou had already gotten up and left the field when Xia ruofei scored that brilliant kill goal. After the whistle of the game, the fans left the field one after another. No one wanted to see the scene of the nemesis celebrating at their home ground.

Bar?a’s players also quickly left the field, while Ruby and his disciples were still cheering and celebrating on the field. The Spanish fans in the visiting stands also shouted the names of every Spanish player, as if they were celebrating a Festival. Among them,”Xia” and “Wu” were the ones they shouted the most.

Xia ruofei also laughed and celebrated with his Spanish teammates. Ruby even ran over and gave Xia ruofei a big hug. “Mr. Xia! Thank you! This was a perfect match!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re too kind. I also hope that my team can achieve good results!”

“You have become the hero in the hearts of the Spanish fans!” Ruby said happily,”in nokapu, beating their nemesis bar?a with such a score will definitely leave a heavy mark in the history of the Spanish team! And your two wonderful goals will be remembered by the people!”

Hearing Ruby’s words, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.

At this time, the lights in the stadium suddenly dimmed. The Spanish players who were celebrating and the Spanish fans in the stands could not help but be stunned. In fact, the Spanish team’s celebration time was not particularly long. It was just that the Barcelona players had left in a hurry. In fact, there were still many Barcelona fans in the stands lining up to leave. No one expected the main lights in the stadium to suddenly turn off before the visiting players left.

Xia ruofei and Ruby exchanged a look. Just as Xia ruofei was about to call the players back to the locker room, an even more exaggerated scene occurred. The maintenance hose on the pitch slowly rose up and began to spray water!

The nozzle would rotate continuously to ensure that every part of the turf could be watered.

Now that the water spray system was turned on, the unprepared Spanish players were suddenly covered in water. Many bar?a fans who were left behind could not help but laugh when they saw this scene, while the Spanish fans in the visiting stands reprimanded notrump Stadium for such behavior.

However, in this way, the players naturally ran out of the field in a panic without Ruby and the assistant manager’s instructions. Victor Sanchez, who had used up too much physical energy in the game, slipped when he left the field, which made the bar?a fans in the stands laugh wildly.

Xia ruofei could only smile helplessly at the management of nokapu Stadium. He shook his head gently and thought to himself,” There’s actually such an operation! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After rushing into the players ‘passageway, the Spanish players were all drenched. Ruby’s face was a little ugly and he loudly ordered,” “Everyone, quickly go to the changing room to change your clothes! You can’t catch a cold!”

Ruby walked towards the changing room. He walked beside Xia ruofei and asked in a low voice, “Mr. Xia, do you mind going to the post – Match press conference with me?”

If it were any other player, Ruby would only need to instruct them to attend the press conference if he wanted them to. Moreover, it was an honor for the players to be able to attend the press conference. However, when facing Xia ruofei, Ruby had to use a pleading tone.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s performance in both competitions was outstanding. Last time, Xia ruofei represented Spain and Ruby wanted him to attend the press conference. However, Xia ruofei was the boss, so Ruby thought about it and decided not to bring him up. Instead, he brought Wu Lei, who had also performed well in that competition.

Today, they had won against their arch – enemy in nokapu city and obtained three points. Ruby was very happy. He could see that Xia ruofei was in a good mood, so he took the opportunity to ask Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded. “Alright! But I need to change my clothes first!”

“Of course! I’m going to change my clothes too!” Ruby said.

He had just celebrated with the players on the field and was naturally not spared. Luckily, Ruby had also brought a set of sportswear. Otherwise, he could only meet the reporters in this wet state.

After Xia ruofei returned to the changing room, he quickly took a hot shower and changed into the Spanish training uniform.

Manager Ruby had also changed his clothes, but his hair was still wet. He deliberately did not dry his hair.

“Coach Ruby, shall we go?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Mr. Xia,” Ruby said.”There’s no hurry. How about we wait a little longer?”

“If I remember correctly, the post – Match press conference should have already started, right?” Xia ruofei asked in confusion.

“Yes, but the reporters will definitely wait!” Ruby replied,”they must want to hear the winner’s voice!”

The post – Match interview was the best way to get first – hand information for such a focused game. Even if Ruby was late, the reporters would definitely not leave. They would definitely wait.
