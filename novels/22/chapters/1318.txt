Chapter 1319: The sincerity of Tongren Hall (1)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Jing felt a little dizzy. She was not like Xia ruofei, who did nothing. As a business partner of paradise Corporation, she had a detailed understanding of the situation of Tongren Tang Corporation.

Tang weiran was the Vice President of the group. Although it was a business, she was still a Deputy Director. Moreover, there were so many subsidiaries, research institutes, hospitals, and two listed companies with billions of assets. Feng Jing felt it was unbelievable that the Vice President of such a big group would be so humble.

However, she saw that Tang weiran was very sincere and didn’t seem to be faking it, so she could only nod helplessly and go downstairs with Tang weiran and his retinue.

Tang weiran’s follower was a senior researcher from the Research Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine under the Tongren Tang Group. His name was Zheng Xu and he was in his forties. He was also an expert in the research and identification of Traditional Chinese Medicine and had a lot of experience.

Feng Jing secretly sent a WeChat message to Xia ruofei.”Chairman, President Tang of Tongren Hall is already waiting for you downstairs. Please hurry up!

After a while, Feng Jing felt her phone vibrate. She swiped the screen open and saw Xia ruofei’s message. He knew.

Feng Rao was speechless.

She had already given Xia ruofei a reminder. She could only support Xia ruofei unconditionally in whatever he wanted to do.

Feng Jing accompanied Tang weiran and waited for more than ten minutes. It was quite cold on the three mountains in December and the wind by the seaside was quite strong. Tang weiran and Zheng Xu, who were used to the dry environment in Beijing, felt that the wind was going to penetrate their bones. Even if they covered their clothes tightly, it was no use.

It was only when she saw Xia ruofei walking over unhurriedly from a distance that Feng Jing heaved a sigh of relief. She was worried that if she waited any longer, the two of them would catch a cold before they could even start the negotiation.

Compared to Tang weiran and the others ‘bulky clothes, Xia ruofei was much more casual. He wore a pair of blue jeans with a pair of white casual shoes and a white long – sleeved T – Shirt with a dark green pilot jacket. He looked like a young man on the street. If someone said that Xia ruofei was a college student, people would definitely believe it.

Tang weiran came in a hurry, so she only contacted Wei Jun through Wei Jianming. Wei Jun then got Xia ruofei’s phone number from Zhao Yongjun. He didn’t know much about Xia ruofei’s situation.

That was why he didn’t notice Xia ruofei who was walking over. He thought that she was just an ordinary employee of paradise Corporation! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Feng Rao reminded him in a low voice,””President Tang, our President Xia is here!”

Tang weiran suddenly realized that the young man in casual clothes was the Mr. Xia with an unfathomable background that Wei Jianming had mentioned.

He quickly put on a warm smile and walked up to her.””President Xia, Hello! I’m tang weiran from Tongren Hall!”

Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks. With a calm smile on his face, he said,”Hello, President Tang! I’ve made you wait ...”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Tang weiran quickly said,”President Xia, we’re the ones who disturbed you!” Previously, the employees of the chain companies under our group were not familiar with the business. I’m sorry to have offended you ...”

“You’re just not familiar with the business?”Xia ruofei asked.

Tang Wei Ran’s smile suddenly became a little awkward. He said,””This ... Before I came, I already instructed the group’s Discipline Inspection department to investigate this matter. The results should be out soon ...”

Xia ruofei nodded noncommittally and said,””President Tang, let’s go upstairs and sit down before we talk!”

“Alright, President Xia, please go first!” Tang Wei Ran said.

Xia ruofei did not stand on ceremony. He nodded and took the lead.

When they passed by Feng Jing, Xia ruofei said,””Inform President Lin to come to the meeting room.”

“Alright!” “Yes,” Feng Jing replied. Then, she gestured to Liu Qian and slowed down her pace. She and Tang weiran followed Xia ruofei into the complex. Liu Qian took out her phone and informed President Lin.

After entering the building, Tang weiran felt a little warm. He couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He hoped that Xia ruofei would feel his sincerity. He was the Vice President of a big corporation. It was indeed a little hard for him to be so humble.

When they arrived at the conference room, CEO Lin, who had received Liu Qian’s call, came down from the guest suite upstairs. He met Xia ruofei and the others at the entrance of the conference room.

President Lin was stunned when he saw Tang weiran, who was half a step behind Xia ruofei and had a warm smile on her face.

Tang weiran didn’t know President Lin, but President Lin was familiar with her.

Because Tang weiran was the group leader in charge of the chain company, although President Lin had never met Tang weiran, he was very familiar with her from the news on the company’s website and the frequent video conference calls.

“Good day, President Tang!” President Lin quickly greeted him respectfully.

Tang weiran looked at President Lin with some doubts. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Big brother Lin is coming down!”

“President Tang, let me introduce you. He’s an elite soldier from Tongren Hall!” He said to Tang weiran. He’s Lin Zhongming, the Vice President of your chain company’s East China District. ”
