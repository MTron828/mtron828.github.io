2362 A bountiful harvest (1)

From the moment Xia ruofei forcefully opened the door of the secret room that was disguised as a bookcase to the moment he subdued the white man who was most likely Golden Fox, the entire process had only taken a few seconds.

In the blink of an eye, the door of the secret room was pulled open and the white man woke up. Then, Xia ruofei entered the secret room in a flash and easily dodged the white man’s attack. The two of them passed each other and put the white man down with a simple hand knife.

The whole process was relaxing.

Of course, it would be difficult for any other tactical master to do this. Xia ruofei had even used the restraint function of his spiritual power to lock the trigger of the Caucasian man’s pistol.

Therefore, unless it was a practitioner with a good mental power cultivation, it would be difficult to stop the white man from shooting in that situation.

After all, this white man was too cautious. He never left his gun when he was sleeping, and he was not afraid of accidentally touching it in his sleep and causing the gun to go off.

Xia ruofei looked at the unconscious white man on the ground with a relaxed expression. Then, he walked out of the bedroom outside the secret room. There was still a substitute lying unconscious on the bed!

Since Xia ruofei had already confirmed that this guy was a substitute, he was naturally not interested in him. He directly put him into the space cage. Although the substitute was fat, he still had hands and legs. He could still do some work if he was caught.

Xia ruofei did not want to waste anything. Of course, he had to keep it a secret. If possible, he did not want to leave anyone alive in the training camp tonight. If he could keep them in his interspace, he would do so.

After keeping the substitute in the space cage, Xia ruofei walked back to the secret room.

He first used his mental power to perform a comprehensive inspection of the white man who had fainted on the floor of the secret room. He put away all the weapons on the white man’s body. In addition to the desert Eagle pistol, the white man actually had several throwing knives on him. These throwing knives were blue, and it was obvious that they had been dipped in poison.

At the same time, Xia ruofei was sure that the white man did not have any lethal poison on him.

This was within his expectations.

Although the assassins sent by Morde were not afraid of death, they were the result of brainwashing and strong coercion. The higher – ups of Morde had earned a lot of money from the mercenary group, so they would not be so decisive.

Xia ruofei then used his spiritual power to do a thorough scan of the secret room. As expected, there was a hidden compartment in the secret room.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to open the secret compartment. Instead, he walked to the white man’s side and kicked an acupuncture point on his waist. The white man groaned and opened his eyes.

When he saw Xia ruofei, his eyes were filled with shock. As if there were Springs under his feet, he leaped backward in a flash.

Xia ruofei crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked at the Caucasian man like a cat toying with a mouse. He did not chase after him.

Seeing this, the white man was slightly happy and subconsciously reached for his waist.

However, the flying Daggers that were originally hidden there had long disappeared without a trace.

The white man had wanted to take advantage of Xia ruofei’s moment of weakness to give him a flying knife.

In the modr organization, this white man was famous for his knife – throwing skills. At such a close distance, he was completely confident that he could hit Xia ruofei’s throat.

When the white man realized that the throwing knife had disappeared, his reaction was very fast. He immediately crashed into a corner of the secret chamber.

There was a hidden mechanism there that could open the door of the secret room on the other side in an emergency, and then he could escape to the office next door.

Unfortunately, he had met Xia ruofei.

He was already trapped in such a small secret room. There was no way he could escape.

Xia ruofei waved his hand lightly and the white man felt as if he had hit an invisible wall. He groaned and bounced back.

Xia ruofei walked over calmly and said in English,””Alright! I don’t want to continue this boring game, let’s get to the point!”

The white man looked at Xia ruofei warily and did not say a word.

He naturally knew that the current situation was extremely disadvantageous to him, but he did not give up. His mind was constantly working at full speed, trying to think of a way to escape.

However, when his eyes met Xia ruofei ‘s, he couldn’t help but shiver. Xia ruofei’s Black eyes were like an endless abyss, extremely deep. He felt as if his mind was being sucked in.

Almost in an instant, the white man fell into a state of confusion after being hypnotized by his mental power.

Xia ruofei casually pulled a chair from the side of the bed and sat down. He asked,””Tell me your name and code name!”

The white man didn’t resist and said with a dull look,””I’m Metatron, codenamed Golden Fox in the modr organization. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although he had already determined it, Xia ruofei still smiled happily when the white man confirmed that he was Golden Fox.

What followed was a round of interrogation. Naturally, Metatron answered all the questions and Xia ruofei’s smile grew wider.
