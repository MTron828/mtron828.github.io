“Dong Xinyu, what are you saying!” Li Yao was both shocked and angry. He quickly shouted.

“Am I wrong? Isn’t it my freedom to choose which company I want to endorse?” Dong Xinyu was also going all out. Since she had already lost her role, what could be worse than this?

Jennifer shrugged and said,”of course!” Then ... It’s also up to us, the investors, to choose who’s the second female lead!”

Dong Xinyu was suddenly stunned. The words she had said in a fit of anger had been used by Jennifer to slap her in the face in the blink of an eye.

Her chest heaved up and down as she said angrily,””I ... I passed the crew selection and was officially selected. How can you go back on your word?”

Jennifer still had an indifferent expression and asked,””Did we sign the contract?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I ... I’ve already signed an acting contract!” Dong Xinyu suddenly became spirited.

“So?” Jennifer pursed her lips and asked,”did you get the contract signed and stamped by our company?”

All the actors ‘contracts were still in the headquarters of Maya Entertainment. Jennifer herself had not signed them, nor had she used the company seal. How could Dong Xinyu have gotten her hands on them?

Dong Xinyu choked at once. She held it in for a long time before she said resentfully,”Even if I didn’t sign an official contract, I’ve participated in a few rounds of selection, and you were the one who informed me to be officially hired! You’re going back on your words!”

“Yes,” Jennifer shrugged.”Just like what you did to Mr. Xia and the Paradise Corporation, we’ll follow the contract!”

Dong Xinyu was immediately rendered speechless by this rebuttal.

That’s right! If she could do it, couldn’t others do the same?

The cycle of heaven and earth, retribution, and dissatisfaction were used to describe people like her.

Dong Xinyu only reacted now. The reason why Jennifer was willing to tell her so much was to make fun of her all along. Her purpose was to give her a taste of her own medicine.

Even though Dong Xinyu had always been in a pitiful state, like a wronged daughter – in – Law, except for her sudden outburst at the end, Jennifer was not moved at all.

Jennifer knew very well that a magical person like Xia ruofei would not deliberately target Dong Xinyu. Moreover, when she saw Feng Jing’s angry expression, she knew that Dong Xinyu must have made Xia ruofei very angry.

It was just that Xia ruofei did not want to trouble the couple, so he had maintained a calm attitude.

However, Xia ruofei did not want to trouble them, and Jennifer could not just sit back and do nothing.

Xia ruofei had saved her beloved son, Tang Haoran’s life. Furthermore, Xia ruofei was Tang Haoran’s master now. How could she not do anything when this artiste had offended Xia ruofei?

It was just a second female lead role. This kind of half – Popular small – time star was everywhere. With the Golden signboard of Maya Entertainment and the luxurious lineup of “Angel of doom”, as long as the news was released, it was easy to find a more suitable role than Dong Xinyu.

Hence, Jennifer fired Dong Xinyu from the crew without any hesitation.

Dong Xinyu’s chest heaved up and down violently. Her fingers were tightly clenched together, and her pale face reflected the strong fluctuations in her heart at the moment.

Dong Xinyu understood that “the angel of doom” was no longer her. The biggest opportunity she had ever had since she started her career, the opportunity for her to soar to the top, had completely disappeared.

Extreme disappointment, regret, and other emotions intertwined.

Suddenly, Dong Xinyu revealed a crazed expression and said hatefully,””Isn’t it just a lousy show? If you don’t let me act, we’ll just go our separate ways! I’m going to expose the dirty secrets of the crew to the media now! Hahaha ...”

Dong Xinyu was still very young, and she had never encountered any setbacks since she started cultivating. This incident had distorted her mentality.

Fang Hongli and Li Yao’s expressions changed.

Dong Xinyu had actually dared to spout such nonsense in front of Tang Yitian and his wife. She had completely given up!

“Xinyu!” Fang Hongli quickly tugged at Dong Xinyu’s clothes.

“Dong Xinyu, are you crazy?!” Li Yao shouted back. Hurry up and apologize to Mr. And Mrs. Tang!”

“Apologize? Hahaha! Why should I apologize?” Dong Xinyu glared at Li Yao with red eyes and said,”I’m not acting in their show anymore. What’s there to be afraid of? Didn’t he just have a bit of stinky money? This was Huaxia! I can’t be banned by two Australians!”

Jennifer’s face suddenly sank, while Tang Yitian’s brows were slightly furrowed, and his sharp eyes shot to Dong Xinyu.

From Dong Xinyu’s point of view, no matter how rich Tang Yitian and Jennifer were, they were just local tycoons in Australia. This movie was funded by their company, so they could decide the actors ‘fate with a word. However, their power was not in China at the end of the day. She had already lost the role in “Angel of doom”, and her situation could not get any worse.

That was why she was so unscrupulous. Of course, at the same time, she had thrown away all her pretense and exposed all the bad habits in her nature.

In fact, a small star like her could be easily suppressed by Li Yao, who had a certain network in the business and entertainment circles. Let alone a world – Class tycoon like Tang Yitian.

Even if Tang Yitian’s company was based in Australia, as long as he said the word, many people in the country would be willing to listen to him.

Dong Xinyu was too naive.

Li Yao knew the severity of the situation. He felt that Dong Xinyu had gone crazy and would not listen to him at all. So, after giving Dong Xinyu a fierce glare, he immediately bowed to Tang Yitian and said,””Mr. Tang, our company will terminate the contract with Dong Xinyu immediately! On behalf of the Yafu group, I would like to express our sincerest apologies to you for what happened!”

“Terminate the contract?” Dong Xinyu said frantically,”do you think you can terminate the contract just because you say so? We just signed a three – year contract! You can terminate your contract if you want to! Pay me 5 million as per the contract!”

“Dong Xinyu! If you want to die, don’t drag me down with you!” Li Yao said with a hideous face.

His intestines were about to turn green with regret. If he had not been so cheap as to bring this lunatic, Dong Xinyu, to see Tang Yitian, there would not have been so many problems.

The current situation was already completely out of his control.

“Hahaha! Didn’t Maya Entertainment say that I don’t have a contract?” Dong Xinyu laughed heartily and said,”I just signed the contract with Yafu. The contract is still in my bag! Boss Li can’t be that forgetful, right?”

“Enough!” Xia ruofei, who had been silent all this while, suddenly slammed the table and shouted.

The slap was so loud that Dong Xinyu was shocked. Her crazy smile could not help but freeze.

Xia ruofei said coldly,”don’t talk about your mess with the Yafu group here!” We’re going to eat now, so get lost!”

Dong Xinyu’s series of actions today had made Xia ruofei extremely disgusted with her.

Most importantly, Xia ruofei could see that Tang Yitian and Jennifer were also angry.

Xia ruofei had never wanted to trouble Tang Yitian and his wife. Just now, Jennifer had fired Dong Xinyu from the crew with just a word. Xia ruofei could still accept it. If he let Tang Yitian and his wife use their own connections to deal with Dong Xinyu, Xia ruofei felt that it would be too much trouble for them.

It was a matter that she could solve herself, so there was no need to involve Tang Yitian and his wife.

In addition, Dong Xinyu had just announced that she would reveal the truth to the media. The entertainment media nowadays had no moral integrity at all. As long as it was news that could attract attention, they would rush like a flock of ducks. If they allowed this Dong Xinyu to go out and spread nonsense, it might bring a negative impact to’ Angel of doom ‘.

Although the possibility of this happening was very low, the Mei ya group was powerful and it wasn’t difficult to deal with this kind of public relations matter. However, Xia ruofei didn’t want to affect Tang Yitian, or he would feel even more guilty.

Therefore, when Dong Xinyu had said those words, Xia ruofei had already sentenced her to death in his heart.

Dong Xinyu glanced at Xia ruofei with disdain and said,””Tsk! This old lady likes to talk here, what can you do about it!”

Just now, she was still begging for Xia ruofei’s forgiveness and was even willing to be the spokesperson for paradise Corporation for free. However, after she confirmed that she had no hope of acting in “Angel of doom”, her attitude changed completely and her words were unscrupulous.

“Dong Xinyu,” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”you can’t blame anyone else for your own death. Just wait to be banned!”

Dong Xinyu sneered and said in disdain,””Ban me? With just you, a small village boss? I’m dying of laughter! If you didn’t know Tang Yitian, you would be nothing! He really thinks he’s some great figure! Come on! Ban me! I’m so scared ... Hahaha!”

Xia ruofei could not be bothered with this crazy man. He could ask song Rui to do this kind of thing with just a word. Besides, he and song Rui were as close as Blood Brothers. He did not feel any pressure at all when he asked him to do this.

Hence, Xia ruofei took out his phone and dialed song Rui’s number in front of everyone.

The phone rang twice before song Rui picked it up.

Before Xia ruofei could speak, song Rui said in surprise,””Ruofei, I was just about to call you! You brat, do you need to have such a tacit understanding! I’m telling you, the day after tomorrow ...”

Xia ruofei interrupted song Rui and said,””We’ll talk about your matter later! There’s a small star called Dong Xinyu, I think she appeared on a talent show ... Which company is she from?”

Xia ruofei looked at Feng Jing and asked the last question.

Feng Jing had personally been in charge of the endorsement deal in the early stages, so she was naturally quite familiar with Dong Xinyu’s situation.

“Star Media!” Feng Jing replied without hesitation.

“She’s an artiste under Star Media!” Xia ruofei continued to say to song Rui,”I’m very, very unhappy with her. Help me find someone to completely ban her! Is there any difficulty?”
