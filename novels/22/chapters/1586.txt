Chapter 1588: Rare black jadeite (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei’s seemingly simple action had in fact gone beyond the application level and pointed directly to the basic rules of the spirit map space. He had built an independent space above the spirit pool and moved the reclining chair in it.

This meant that Xia ruofei did not need to use the invisible spatial force. Even if he left the spirit map space, this independent space would still exist and its structure was very stable.

Without absolute control of the spirit map space and a deep understanding of the rules of the spirit map space, Xia ruofei would never be able to do this.

Even Xia Qing couldn’t help but be slightly moved when she saw this scene. Xia ruofei’s talent in space was not weak, and he had the unique conditions of controlling the spirit map’s space. He was actually able to construct a space independently when he was only in the Qi cultivation stage, which was somewhat beyond Xia Qing’s expectations.

Of course, Xia ruofei’s understanding of the laws of space was still very shallow. He could only perform such operations within the spirit map space. In the outside world, his ability in the aspect of space was far inferior to that of the realm Fox.

Xia ruofei was like a child who had just gotten a new toy. He was happy to try it out repeatedly.

He first constructed multiple layers of space in the Archean realm. Then, he moved all the large wine jars that contained the Eight Immortals drunken white wine into these multiple layers of space.

Previously, Xia ruofei had built some solid metal frames so that the wine jars could be stacked on top of each other to save as much space as possible. However, in essence, they were still in the same space and the metal frames could not be too high or they would be unstable.

However, it was different now. Xia ruofei had constructed layers of independent spaces according to the height of the wine jar. These spaces were also very stable and connected to the entire spirit map space.

In theory, these wine jars could be stacked up to the space Dome, which saved a lot of space.

In other words, as long as Xia ruofei wanted to, he could use the space on the ground level. Now, it had become a three – dimensional space. The space utilization rate was like heaven and earth compared to before.

The 30 times time acceleration at the Archean realm was very useful for Xia ruofei’s letter. Things that he couldn’t do previously due to the limited space could now be done.

Taking the Drunken Eight Immortals wine as an example, Xia ruofei could definitely increase the production of the wine factory by a few times. He would not have to worry about the Archean realm being filled to the brim.

As for the mountain sea realm, it was incomparably vast to begin with. If one added in these layers of independent space, it could be said that space was basically endless.

Xia ruofei had once again arrived at the mountain and sea realm. That white realmfox was still greedily comprehending the spatial laws.

The moment Xia ruofei appeared in the mountain and sea realm, the realm Fox seemed to have finished its comprehension of this spatial node. Its figure flashed like lightning as it rushed to the next node.

Seeing that the realm Fox was rushing towards the Cordyceps sinensis plant nursery, Xia Qing quickly reminded loudly,””Slow down. Don’t damage the fungi in the soil!”

The corners of Xia ruofei’s mouth curved up slightly, revealing a smile.

With just a slight thought, the realm Fox bounced back as if it had hit a wall.

The White realmfox was also stunned. It did not believe it and rushed in another direction. However, it was blocked again after only two or three meters.

The realm Fox attacked in all directions, but it was to no avail. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Master ...” Xia Qing said,”I’m afraid this spatial cage can’t trap this little fellow. It has a deep understanding of the spatial laws ...”

As it spoke, the realm Fox seemed to have noticed that something was wrong. It did not continue to attack madly, but calmed down instead.

Xia ruofei could tell that the spatial cage was about to be broken.

Sure enough, in the next moment, the body of the realm Fox seemed to emit a mysterious space rule. Then, with a light wave of its claws, the small sealed space that it had built was broken.

Xia ruofei was not surprised. The realm Fox was unable to break the rules of the spirit map space. However, the small space that Xia ruofei had created through the basic rules of the spirit map space could be easily broken by the realm Fox as long as it calmed down and analyzed it.

After the realm Fox escaped, it was not in a hurry to comprehend the new spatial node. Instead, it looked at Xia ruofei proudly, as if to say,”What can you do to me?

Xia ruofei walked up to him with a smile and said,””Little guy, I don’t object to you comprehending the spatial rules here, but you’re not allowed to destroy a single blade of grass or tree in my space. Otherwise ... The spatial cage just now wouldn’t be a good feeling, right?”

The white fox pouted and gestured at Xia ruofei, implying that the space cage was nothing more than this and posed no threat to it.

Xia ruofei did not take it to heart. He smiled and said,””One space cage is no threat to you, but what about ten, a hundred, or a thousand?”

As Xia ruofei spoke, he waved his hand and set up space cages around the white fox. Some of the space cages were independent of each other, some were nested together, and some even formed an array, just like a complicated maze.

Xia ruofei looked at the white fox and said,””Even if you have the ability to crack them one by one, I’m sure it’ll take a lot of energy, right? In this spirit map world, it’s as easy as blowing off dust for me to create such a small space. Besides ...”
