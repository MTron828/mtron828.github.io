Luo Qingfeng sat cross – legged on the ground quietly, steadily circulating the star Seizer sect’s Unique Cultivation Technique,”STAR technique.” The spirit Qi in the crystal in his hand was constantly being extracted. At the same time, all the pores on his body were open. The spirit Qi that had gathered after the activation of the Taixu xuanqing formation also entered his meridians in wisps.

Although Luo Qingfeng still had some thoughts to keep an eye on his surroundings, he did not realize that the mist around him had quietly changed. After all, he was in the middle of cultivation and could not keep an eye on the origin exploration mirror all the time. Moreover, under Xia ruofei’s deliberate control, the mist in the direction of the origin exploration mirror had basically remained stable and had not changed much from before.

Unknowingly, a burst of sobs came from the depths of the fog.

Qingfeng Luo, who was cultivating, did not notice anything unusual. When the whimpering sound entered his ears, his body trembled slightly. In his mind, scenes of him stepping onto the path of cultivation by chance from a Cowherd boy in the countryside for more than a hundred years suddenly appeared.

In that chaotic era, family members were separated, friends were lost, and even the entire village was turned into scorched earth.

Ever since he had entered the star Seizer sect, he had been training diligently in the dense spiritual Qi every day, ignoring the flames of war in the outside world. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He had started out as the lowest servant disciple, and through his own hard work, he had stood out from the fierce competition in the star Seizer sect, and in the end, he had inherited the mantle of the old sect master.

The important experiences in his life for more than a hundred years, as well as some unforgettable and unforgettable moments, flashed through his mind like a movie.

In the end, all the images shattered and then reassembled into a middle – aged woman wearing clothes made of coarse cloth.

This middle – aged woman was in her early forties, but the hair at her temples had already turned white. The wrinkles at the corners of her eyes were also very obvious, and the skin on her hands was very rough. This was the mark of time left behind by years of labor.

When the middle – aged woman appeared, Luo Qingfeng’s body could not help but tremble slightly, and a complicated expression appeared on his face.

He seemed to have forgotten that he was trapped in the Peach Blossom Island’s great array and that he was actually cultivating. It was clearly an illusion in front of him, but he was unable to break free from the mist. In fact, he subconsciously did not want to break free either. Although this was the first time he had seen this middle – aged woman, he felt a sense of familiarity and closeness from the bottom of his heart. Moreover, this woman’s appearance was very similar to his mother ‘s, so her identity was naturally on the verge of being revealed.

“Mother ...” Luo Qingfeng muttered in a trembling voice.

The middle – aged woman gave him a deep look and said,””Little Tao, you’re so cruel! You just left us like that and left for more than a hundred years ...”

“Little Tao” was Luo Qingfeng’s nickname. His original name was Luo Songtao. Qingfeng was a name given to him by his master after he had entered the star Seizer sect. It was given according to the seniority of the star Seizer sect. The Daoist names of his generation all had the word “Qing” in them. In the world of cultivation, he was also known as Daoist priest Qingfeng.

It had been more than a hundred years since anyone had called him by this nickname.

Hearing his mother’s words, Qingfeng Luo felt as if his heart was being cut by a knife. He knelt on the ground and kowtowed as he said,””Mother! I’m unfilial ... After I was separated from you, I was brought to the star Seizer sect by my master. We weren’t allowed to leave the mountain until I had some success in my cultivation. When I finally reached the fourth level of the aura refining realm and was qualified to go out, I didn’t waste a single day and immediately went down the mountain to find you. But ... In those chaotic years, I couldn’t find you at all! Our village is gone, it’s a piece of scorched earth ...”

The middle – aged woman did not seem satisfied with Luo Qingfeng’s explanation. She looked at him indifferently and said,””Little Tao, we’re right under that piece of scorched earth! “That day, an Army rushed into the village and burned the entire village down. All of our villagers ... None of them managed to escape. They were all buried under the scorched earth. Little Tao, we’ve been waiting for you for more than a hundred years ...”

Luo Qingfeng’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets when he heard this. His body trembled even more violently, and his mind gradually began to show signs of losing control.

Xia ruofei, who had been hiding at the side, did not know that Luo Qingfeng had gone through an illusionary array in the misty Taixu xuanqing formation. He only used the demonic sound as a medium to put the person in a state similar to hypnosis. Then, the inner demon would take advantage of this. Therefore, everyone’s experience was different, but it was definitely the most unbearable or the most unforgettable thing in their lives.

Xia ruofei saw that Luo Qingfeng’s body was trembling more and more violently. His face was also turning red, as if he could go into Qi deviation at any time.

Xia ruofei’s heart was filled with joy. He did not expect the illusion of the Taixu xuanqing formation to be so powerful.

If he had known this earlier, he wouldn’t have needed to use the trap formation to probe the situation and would have directly entered the illusionary formation. Xia ruofei said to himself.

Just as Xia ruofei was looking forward to Luo Qingfeng’s mental breakdown so that he could take advantage of it, Luo Qingfeng suddenly felt a slight chill on his chest. A cool breath entered his body from his chest, and his mind suddenly became clear.

Luo Qingfeng’s expression changed. He stood up abruptly and sealed his hearing decisively. Then, he put his hand into his pocket and took out a star – shaped pendant. There were three dark patterns engraved on the pendant. It was the token of the sect leader of the star Seizer sect and also the most precious treasure passed down by the sect. It had been personally controlled by the sect leaders of the past generations.
