2472 A shot to fame (1)

The opening ceremony was naturally very successful. Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others were all from prominent families. The guests they invited today were either the leaders of their circle of rich Playboys or influential wealthy businessmen, so naturally, they were carried by everyone.

Zhao Yongjun only said a few words and then announced the start of the cold dinner.

Everyone was freely moving around the banquet hall, chatting with their close friends.

In order to create an atmosphere, Hou Liang had even specially arranged for a few popular singers to come over and sing.

In the eyes of ordinary people, the line – up of singers who were responsible for warming up the stage could be considered luxurious. In fact, most concerts might not even be able to gather so many a – list celebrities. And at the opening ceremony of the Paradise gathering, they really only played the role of warming up the stage.

All of these celebrities came to perform for free. On one hand, Hou Liang was the son of hou tai. The resources he had in the entertainment industry were so many that it was frightening. Those who were in the entertainment industry were naturally willing to be on good terms with Hou Liang. On the other hand, the Paradise gathering was a high – end social event to begin with, and celebrities naturally flocked to such places.

Therefore, even if it was a free performance, there were still a lot of celebrities who fought to come.

Hou Liang only decided on their current lineup after a round of selection. Celebrities who were not famous enough would not have a chance to come even if they paid for it!

After the cold dinner party started, Ling Qingxue even went to the lingji private kitchen to take a look.

Today’s event was also very important to the Ling Ji private kitchen. Although senior brother Wu’s abilities were outstanding and he was also a disciple that Ling Xiaotian valued greatly, Ling Qingxue was still a little worried.

Although the opening banquet was called a “cold dinner party,” there were actually many “hot dishes”. It was actually a bit similar to a buffet, but on a larger scale and of a higher standard.

Among them, a few of the Ling Ji private kitchen’s signature dishes would also be revealed at the cold dinner party.

Including the secret Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup.

Senior brother Wu had rushed to the capital a few days ago to start preparing. This dish would become the signature dish of the Ling Ji private kitchen in the capital in the future, so he didn’t dare to neglect it.

There was a long dining table around the banquet hall today, and on it was a variety of exquisite desserts and delicacies. The most eye – catching one was the first table at the entrance, on which there was a row of eye – catching jars, a total of five. These jars were placed on a specially designed shelf on the table, with hot water circulating below to keep them warm.

This was the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ that had been specially prepared for Ling Ji’s private kitchen for the past few days.

The jar used to store ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was also specially made. It was several times bigger than the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ sold in Ling Ji’s private kitchen. It looked like a wine jar, and the layers of ingredients inside were very solid. Every ingredient was processed in strict accordance with the standard and in place.

Just these ingredients alone were already expensive.

Before the start of the cold dinner party, the mouth of the jar was sealed with lotus leaves, so no one felt anything strange about it. At most, they were a little curious when they saw a few big jars placed there.

As soon as the buffet party started, the service staff removed the seal on the jar, and the unique rich fragrance immediately spread throughout the banquet hall.

Today’s guests were either rich or noble. What good things had they not eaten? However, everyone still couldn’t resist the temptation of the fragrance and looked in the direction of the source of the fragrance.

Soon, someone couldn’t help but walk over with a plate.

Today, the entire Paradise club’s service staff was basically gathered in the banquet hall. To them, this was the first “real battle” since the opening of the club, so everyone was in high spirits.

When the customers came to the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, a waiter immediately went up to serve them. He scooped out all kinds of ingredients that had been cooked just right from the jar.

Fish maw, chicken, pig trotters, abalone, quail eggs ... Each of these ingredients exuded an alluring fragrance. When these fragrances were mixed together, it had a special attraction. Many customers couldn’t help but swallow their saliva.

Very quickly, the area around the long dining table where the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup was placed became the most lively place. There was an endless stream of customers who were attracted by the delicious food.

After everyone had a taste, they were all convinced by this absolutely beautiful taste, and praises rose one after another.

“Dongzi! This ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was not bad, right? “There’s a private restaurant in the Paradise society, and this ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ is the signature dish of the private restaurant. The chefs were specially invited from the three mountains, and their skills are absolutely authentic! If you have time, you can bring more people here to try it!”

“Director Guo, I’m not bragging, am I? Was the signature Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup delicious? Next time, if you want to try it, you can directly come to our paradise gathering’s Ling Ji private kitchen, but remember to make a reservation in advance!”

“Hahaha! Yongzi, if you have any social events in the future, think of our paradise society’s private restaurant! Not only is the environment here good, but the food here is also first – Class. If you treat your friends to a meal here, you’ll definitely have a lot of face!”

……

Of course, compared to tasting the food, everyone was more interested in communicating with each other. The main purpose of the guests coming here was not to eat. They valued the Paradise gathering as a platform and the network that they could expand here.

Therefore, it could be said that it was a victory for Ling Ji ‘s’ Buddha Jumps Over the Wall ‘to be able to create such an effect in such an environment.
