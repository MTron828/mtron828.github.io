2224 Win – win (2)

The only difference between this lineup and the previous season was that the Chinese music youngster, Liu Xianhua, could not participate in the recording due to his schedule, so he was replaced by Zhang Xing.

For this kind of slow variety show that focused on a leisurely atmosphere, the entire recording process was not very tight. It was just to experience the leisurely village life with the guests. For the sake of the program’s effect, a certain amount of work would be arranged. There was also cooking, drinking tea, chatting, and so on.

They arrived at the mushroom house in the morning, stayed there for a night, and left after lunch the next day. The task of being a guest for the first episode was completed.

The guests for the second episode would arrive the next morning, and the recording would continue.

Xiangnan satellite TV considered the fact that Xia ruofei was different from the other celebrities. To show their respect for him, he was the only flying guest in the first episode. Usually, there would be several guests in each episode. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xia ruofei didn’t have the bad habits of some big stars. After Gao Jun introduced the program in detail, he even took the initiative to ask Xia ruofei if he had any requirements, or if there were any taboos in his life or diet. Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Director Gao, I’m not that particular! I came from a poor life, and what kind of hardship did I not suffer when I was a soldier? Just tell the festival Group to do what they need to do. There’s no need to give me any special treatment!”

Gao Jun said happily,””Thank you! Thank you! President Xia, I’m really grateful!”

The reason why Gao Jun had come personally was that he was worried that Xia ruofei would be difficult to get close to. He was worried that the festival Group would be careless and neglect her. In his opinion, a young rich man like Xia ruofei, who had such a strong network in the capital, would definitely not be easy to get close to. It was normal for him to be arrogant.

In fact, during the groundbreaking ceremony of the capital’s peach blossom society, Gao Jun also felt that Xia ruofei was a little unreasonable through his short contact with him.

At that time, Gao Jun had offered to use the Paradise gathering’s venue to film the third season of life I yearn for together. This was supposed to be a good promotion for the Paradise gathering, but Xia ruofei had flatly refused and was very determined.

If it wasn’t for Zhao Yongjun and the others ‘support, this would have been over.

Gao Jun didn’t expect that Xia ruofei was completely different from what he had imagined. She didn’t put on any airs at all and was very easy – going. She was simply too easy to talk to.

“President Xia, there’s something else that we hope to receive your company’s full support ...” Gao Jun continued.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’re too kind, director Gao!” If there’s anything we can help you with, just tell us. ”

“Thank you!” Gao Jun said,”President Xia, it’s like this. When we were planning the show, we designed a vegetable field. The quality of your company’s vegetables is well – known, so ... We have a presumptuous request. Can your company provide us with some high – Quality vegetables and help us transplant them to the vegetable field next to the mushroom house?”

The life you yearn for was a variety show, so it was naturally impossible to plant the seedlings like a real vegetable garden in a village. After all, the program’s recording cycle was only so long. If you started planting from the beginning, the vegetables might not be ripe by the time the program finished recording.

In fact, in the first season of the show, the vegetable field was directly filled with mature corn. The guests picking corn in exchange for ingredients even became a big selling point of that episode.

Xia ruofei fell into deep thought.

“President Xia, if it’s for confidentiality or other reasons, just forget it. You don’t have to feel embarrassed ...” Gao Jun quickly said.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”director Gao, you’ve misunderstood. It’s just a small matter. It’s not difficult. I’m just thinking about which vegetables are suitable to be provided. After all, the north and south are different.” Moreover, the weather in the North is still very cold. We still need to consider whether the vegetables can survive after being transplanted. ”

“Director Xia, we’ve already built a greenhouse for the vegetables in advance,” Gao Jun said quickly.”There’s no problem with normal planting!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””That’s good! I agree to this! Chief Feng, you can talk to factory manager Cao and let him coordinate the specific things. You must cooperate with him and choose the best vegetables. Also, take the survival rate into consideration and prepare more vegetables. ”

Feng Rao was also in the reception room. She immediately said,””Yes, Chairman!”

“Thank you, President Xia!” Gao Jun was overjoyed. You’ve been a great help to me! With this batch of vegetables, the entire program would be promoted to a higher level! Your company only needs to provide the vegetables that are about to ripen. As for the other matters, including the transportation, we will take care of it ourselves!”

“Alright, this matter can’t be delayed. Send someone to the farm today and communicate with factory manager Cao!” Xia ruofei smiled.

The program would start recording in a week, so the garden had to be prepared in advance.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Gao Jun said. Then he turned to one of his subordinates and said,”Xiao Liu, follow up on this matter. Make sure the garden is built before the shooting!”

“Yes, station head!” Xiao Liu quickly stood up and answered.

Then, Gao Jun put forward some specific requirements, including using the Taoyuan Da Hong Pao to serve the guests in the show, putting the jaded skin cream in the bathroom for the guests to use, and also preparing a small amount of Taoyuan brand iron maple and Cordyceps.

These requests were not so much a request for the Paradise company’s support, but rather an advertisement for the Paradise company.

When the show was broadcasted, the products from paradise brand that could be seen everywhere would appear on the screen from time to time. The host would also randomly insert advertisements. For example, when he was making tea with the guests, he would definitely say that this was paradise Da Hong Pao. When they washed up in the morning, the guests had to use some jaded skin cream, an internet – famous makeup. After all, celebrities paid great attention to their skin.

In addition, there was also the vegetable greenhouse named after the Paradise company. When the guests went to the greenhouse to plant and pick vegetables, they naturally had to thank the Paradise company for their friendly sponsorship. Moreover, paradise vegetables was now popular all over the country. Just its appearance alone could attract countless fans. When the time came, the festival group’s HD cameras would naturally take beautiful pictures of the vegetables.

This was excellent publicity.

In fact, this treatment was second only to the main sponsor in the show. The main sponsor not only had a variety of fixed advertisements, but also a large number of embedded advertisements.

In addition, it was estimated that the peach blossom company’s products had the highest exposure rate.

More importantly, all of this was free.

When Feng Rao heard this, she couldn’t help but feel a surge of emotions and almost cheered out loud.

No matter how well xiangnan satellite TV’s reputation was, their influence in the entertainment industry was undoubted. Besides, a life to look forward to had already gone through the market test and had a large fixed audience base. The advertising effect was undeniable.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had personally participated in the first episode’s recording. He would immediately become a hot topic. As long as the show did not seek trouble, the third season would definitely be a hot topic again.

With regards to xiangnan TV’s “request”, Xia ruofei naturally agreed without hesitation. He even instructed Feng Jing on the spot to provide them with sufficient products according to xiangnan TV’s needs.

Of course, to xiangnan satellite TV, it was not an investment without any returns.

Xia ruofei’s popularity was enough to increase the show’s popularity by a large margin. Although they had sacrificed a lot of advertising spots, the revenue from the hard advertisements during the show’s broadcast time could increase by a lot.

Besides the profits, he could expand the influence of the TV station in the entertainment industry and more importantly, gain Xia ruofei’s friendship. To xiangnan TV and Gao Jun, these were all worthwhile returns.

So, this was definitely a win – win cooperation.
