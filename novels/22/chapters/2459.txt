2460 Diamond card (1)

Xia ruofei was very excited,”let’s go!” Let’s take a look together!”

The group walked towards the small villa.

The entire peach blossom gathering was designed as one. The villa also had some Chinese elements, but it also used some of the modern villa’s assembly concepts. The two were integrated together, and there was no conflict at all. It could be seen that the designer’s level was high. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After walking into the villa, everyone clearly felt their spirits lift.

In fact, because of the natural array, the spiritual Qi concentration in the entire paradise gathering was higher than that in the outside world. Therefore, after stepping into the paradise gathering, even ordinary people could feel refreshed, and even their mood would inexplicably become better.

This was the magical thing about spirit Qi.

This villa was built on top of the array eye, so it could be said to be the core of the entire array. Of course, the spiritual Qi was the densest.

Of course, compared to the spirit map space, it was still a far cry.

However, to Ling Qingxue and Song Wei, this place was already quite good. They could even cultivate here directly.

They all knew that this was Xia ruofei’s doing, and they looked at him with admiration.

Song Rui said enviously,”I feel that this is the most comfortable place in the entire club!” I even want to move here!”

“Xiao Rui,” Zhao Yongjun said,”this was decided by RUO Fei first. You can’t take what he likes!”

“Don’t worry!”Song Rui pouted. Am I that kind of person?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”if you like this place, then move in!” Just leave me a room!”

Then, Xia ruofei pointed to the guest room on the first floor and said,””I want this one! You can arrange the other places as you wish! The reason why we don’t want to open this villa to the public is that we want to have our own space. Also, some things have to be hidden well to prevent others from destroying them, right?”

Xia ruofei’s words were vague, but when Xia ruofei first set up the array, Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the others had personally experienced it. At that time, Xia ruofei set up a Yin array, and it was called a Yin wind! Song Rui almost fainted on the spot, so he naturally had a deep impression of it.

Later on, it was Xia ruofei who took action and turned the yin formation into a yang formation. The aura of the entire paradise gathering’s location was also completely reversed. The gloomy aura was completely gone. Not only that, everyone who came here would feel as warm as spring and their mood would be at ease.

Hence, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui understood what Xia ruofei meant.

They were well aware of the importance of this place to the entire paradise Association.

If the formation core was destroyed, the formation would lose its effect, or even worse, it would turn into a Yin formation, and the club would not be able to continue operating.

Song Rui immediately said,”ruofei is right. This place can’t be opened to the public!” It’s not bad for us to set up our own land! But ... Ruofei, I’ll leave the master bedroom upstairs for you!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””I want this guest room! In addition ... Pass down the order that no one is to enter that room at will. Otherwise, if there is any danger, you will have to bear the responsibility!”

That guest room was located directly above the array eye, and the spiritual Qi was the densest. The master bedroom upstairs was more than three meters above the ground, so the spiritual Qi concentration was naturally not as dense as that of the guest room on the first floor.

Even though Xia ruofei no longer needed to cultivate in the outside world, he could still let Song Wei and Ling Qingxue use it. Cultivating in such an environment would even slow down the consumption of spirit crystals and origin crystals, because the cultivator could also absorb the spiritual energy from the outside world.

Besides, Xia ruofei also had to set up a series of protective arrays in the room.

He had already decided to use his knowledge of arrays to the fullest. This defensive array was as strong as it could be. There was only one purpose, and that was to protect the array eye of the array.

This was why Xia ruofei had warned Zhao Yongjun and song Rui in advance.

“Alright then!” Song Rui said,”since you like to be down – to – Earth, I’ll leave the room on the first floor for you!”

Song Rui had guessed Xia ruofei’s intention when he said that. However, he knew that this matter was of great importance, so he did not say it in front of Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and Zhuo Yiyi.

The group of people took a look around the small villa, then went out from the back door of the villa. They walked around the lake and then prepared to go back.

After all, it was the opening ceremony today. Zhao Yongjun and song Rui were the leaders of their small team, except for Xia ruofei. His status was a little high and he didn’t like to show his face in the circle of rich people in the capital. There would be a lot of guests today, so Zhao Yongjun and the others had to go back as soon as possible to socialize.

The group walked along the lakeside and headed in the direction of the club’s entrance.

After walking for a while, Zhao Yongjun patted his forehead and said,””Look at my memory! I almost forgot about this!”

Then, Zhao Yongjun took out a few cards from his shirt pocket. He gave the top card to Xia ruofei, then gave the rest to Ling Qingxue, Song Wei, and even Zhuo Yiyi.

Zhao Yongjun smiled.”This is the highest level diamond card in our club. Everyone here has one!”

Xia ruofei took the diamond Membership card and played with it for a while. When he saw the number 001 on it, he was slightly stunned and said,””Brother Zhao, why did you give me the number 1 card? Isn’t that a little inappropriate?”
