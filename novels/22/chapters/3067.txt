Tai city, Lu province, night had just fallen.

Xia ruofei found a remote place outside tai city and landed the flying boat.

After he put away the flying boat, he walked to the main road nearby and waved to stop a taxi.

“Master, let’s go to the sky Peak Hotel,” Xia ruofei said as he got into the car.

“Alright! Please fasten your seat belt!” The driver said. Then, he skillfully pressed the taximeter and started the car.

The taxi driver chatted with Xia ruofei while driving.””Sir, this should be your first time in grand city, right?”

Xia ruofei was sitting in the back seat with his eyes closed. He nodded and said,””En!”

“You’re here to Mount Tai?” The taxi driver asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”that’s a thought.”

“It seems like you’re here.” The taxi driver smiled and said,”I think it’s more comfortable to travel freely. We’re rushing every day with a tour group, so we can’t see any good scenery!”

Xia ruofei smiled but did not say anything.

The taxi driver glanced at Xia ruofei from the rearview mirror. Perhaps he felt that this passenger was not good with words, so he did not say anything.

But at this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly opened his eyes and said,””Sir, it’s time to change lanes. You have to turn left at the traffic light ahead. If you don’t change lanes, you’ll enter the marked area ...”

The taxi driver was stunned and could not help but turn to look at Xia ruofei.

He thought that Xia ruofei was looking at the GPS on his phone, but he found that Xia ruofei’s hands were empty, and he had even closed his eyes.

In fact, after Xia ruofei landed in tai city, the first thing he did was to use his phone’s navigation system to check his current location and the route to Tianfeng hotel.

With the memory of an Aurous core stage cultivator, such a simple route plan could be easily memorized.

The taxi driver could tell that Xia ruofei was a first – time traveler in tai city. After some beating around the bush, he wanted to take a detour. He did not expect Xia ruofei to see through him so quickly.

The taxi driver forced himself to turn into the left – turn lane before entering the marked area. He then smiled awkwardly and said,””The traffic on this road is quite serious. Although it’s a little further to go straight, it’s more time – saving.”

When Xia ruofei looked at the navigation system, he realized that the route was green and there was no traffic jam.

However, he didn’t expose her, and only said indifferently,””It’s okay, just follow the normal route!”

The taxi driver could only say resentfully,””Alright then!”

Along the way, the taxi driver kept peeking at Xia ruofei through the rearview mirror. Although Xia ruofei had been resting with his eyes closed, he felt guilty for no reason. He felt that this passenger was a little strange. He did not dare to make any detours and drove along the normal route.

Half an hour later, the car arrived at the entrance of the sky Peak Hotel and slowly stopped.

“Sir, we’ve arrived!” The taxi driver said.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes and nodded.”Oh! Thanks for the trouble, how much is it?”

The taxi driver glanced at the taximeter and said,””It’s 65 Yuan in total. Do you want cash or QR code?”

Xia ruofei looked at the taximeter and said,””This price isn’t right! It’s only about 35 kilometers in total, so it’s at most about 40 pieces!”

Although Xia ruofei had been resting with his eyes closed all the way, as a golden core cultivator with spiritual power in the late stage of spirit gathering realm, he could clearly sense how far the car had gone.

In addition, the local rental prices of tai city were posted inside the car.

Everything within two kilometers was charged at the starting price of 6 Yuan. Beyond that, the charge would be 0.5 yuan for every 500 meters.

There was almost no traffic jam on the way, and there was no additional fee.

After a quick calculation, he knew that the price was about 40 yuan.

Besides, the GPS would always show the estimated price of a taxi. Xia ruofei had checked the GPS before he got on the car and the estimated price was 40 yuan. Although he had only taken a glance, he still remembered it clearly.

The taxi driver didn’t expect a foreign tourist to be so astute. In fact, his taximeter had been tampered with. There was a hidden button under the steering wheel, and after pressing it, it would jump much faster than normal.

In his previous order, he had also pulled in a tourist from another city, so he had pressed that button. When he picked up Xia ruofei, it had not returned to its original state.

Although the taxi driver on the way felt that Xia ruofei was a little strange, he felt that even if he knew the route through the GPS, he would not be so sensitive to the price, so he did not bother about it.

He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to question him as soon as the price was announced.

The taxi driver’s face slightly changed and said,””Sir, this is what the taximeter shows. I’m also following the route you told me. I’ve been running this road a lot, and it’s not just 35 kilometers! There’s no problem with the price!”

Xia ruofei was not short of money, but that did not mean that he was willing to be fooled by a taxi driver.

“Just turn on the GPS and you’ll know how far this road is,” he said indifferently.”Isn’t it 35 kilometers? don’t you know it yourself?”

“What do you mean?” The taxi driver naturally wouldn’t admit it. “Sir, this is a regular taxi. I charge by the meter. You’re being a little unreasonable!”

“I’m pestering you?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Master, if your taximeter is faulty, you should fix it as soon as possible! I can pay you at the normal price, but don’t think about ripping me off just because I’m a foreigner. Tai city is a famous tourist city, and renting a car is like the city’s window and business card. Don’t you try to smear tai city’s reputation!”

Actually, tai city was very small, and the taxi just now happened to be taking guests to the suburbs. If he had not met Xia ruofei, he would most likely have returned to the city empty – handed.

However, he wanted to take a detour and also did something to the taximeter. He was really greedy.

Xia ruofei was being tactful. In fact, he could tell that the taximeter had been tampered with. Many news reports had reported that the taxi drivers had modified the taximeter.

After the taxi driver heard this, he couldn’t help but become angry from embarrassment. His tone also became much colder.”Young man, be careful of what you say! You’re a foreigner in tai city, so it’s best for you to pretend to be muddle – headed. You don’t have much money in total, so why do you have to find trouble for yourself? Didn’t you come out to have fun?”

“Are you threatening me?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”Master, I won’t talk to you anymore. I’ll ask you one last time, how much are you going to charge for this trip?” If it really doesn’t work, I’ll call the transport management to complain. ”

The taxi driver seemed to feel that his dignity as a local had been trampled on. He straightened his neck and said fiercely,””You’re trying to smash my job! Young man, if you have the ability, then complain and see! Cutting off one’s path to wealth was like killing one’s parents! If my job is destroyed, I’m afraid it’ll be very difficult for you to leave our grand city!”

At this time, the security guard at the entrance of the hotel saw that the taxi had stopped and did not disembark the passengers. He could not help but come over to check and knock on the window.

Xia ruofei did not want to argue with a taxi driver, so he rolled down the window and said to the security guard,””Get your manager Sun Xiao here. Tell him that I’m a friend of young master Chen. He’ll know.”

This sky Peak Hotel was one of the first heaven society’s businesses in the secular world. It was also the one closest to the first heaven society.

Therefore, the sky Peak Hotel was actually a contact point for the heavenly sect. Cultivators who weren’t familiar with the heavenly sect would always stop here first.

As for Sun Xiao, he was an outer disciple of the first heaven society, and he was in charge of receiving cultivators.

...

Of course, Chen Xuan was the one who had told Xia ruofei about this.

He had passionately invited Xia ruofei to the first heaven society as a guest. Naturally, he had to tell Xia ruofei the way to contact him.

Manager Sun Xiao naturally had a special position in the Tianfeng hotel. He was not responsible for any specific business, but many times, even the hotel’s general manager had to listen to his words. The staff also vaguely knew Sun Xiao’s position in the hotel.

Therefore, when the security guard heard this, his attitude immediately became much more polite. He quickly said,””Alright, please wait a moment ...”

After that, he immediately said into the walkie – talkie,””Manager sun, there’s someone at the door looking for you. He said he’s a friend of young master Chen ...”

The walkie – talkie buzzed and a voice came through.””I’ll be there immediately!”

The taxi driver smacked the steering wheel and said angrily,””Are you going to pay or not? I’m telling you, you’ve already delayed my work. When the time comes, it won’t be as simple as 65 ...”

“Shut up!” Xia ruofei said coldly.

Although he only released a trace of his aura, it made the taxi driver feel like he had fallen into an ice cave, as if the blood in his body had frozen.

He was so fierce just a moment ago, but he was so scared by Xia ruofei’s two simple words that he didn’t even dare to breathe.

At this time, the taxi driver also regretted a little. He clearly felt that the foreign tourist he had pulled in today was not a good person!

...

After a while, Xia ruofei saw a man in his mid – thirties, dressed in a suit and leather shoes, running out of the hotel.

The security guard was still standing next to the taxi. Seeing this, he quickly waved and shouted,””Manager sun, over here!”

The middle – aged man in a suit and leather shoes looked over and quickly walked to the taxi.

Xia ruofei also opened the door and got out of the car. The taxi driver opened his mouth, but in the end, he did not dare to speak.

Sun Xiao quickly walked over and looked at Xia ruofei. He asked cautiously,””May I ask which young master Chen’s friend you are?”

Xia ruofei smiled and looked at the security guard.

“I’ll take care of this, you can go first!”Sun Xiao said to the security guard.

“Yes! Manager sun!” The security guard quickly said.

Xia ruofei took a few steps away from the taxi and took out a name card from the spirit map space. He handed it to Sun Xiao.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything and just looked at Sun Xiao with a smile.

This name card was given to Xia ruofei by Chen Xuan. It was a sign of advancement for cultivators to use name cards.

However, the card was very exquisite, and there was a special metal wire embedded in it, so it was impossible to forge.

When sun Xiao saw the business card, he was shocked. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He took the business card with both hands and looked at it carefully. Then, he immediately returned the business card with both hands and respectfully said,””Greetings, senior!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know that Chen Xuan had three types of business cards. The one he gave Xia ruofei was one of the rarest. Usually, only very important guests or close friends could get it.

Therefore, as soon as Sun Xiao saw the business card, he immediately realized that the guest in front of him was of high status.

In fact, Sun Xiao was only an outer disciple in the first heaven society, and his cultivation was insignificant.

In terms of seniority, he and Chen Xuan were two generations apart. Xia ruofei was able to get such a name card because he was on the same level as Chen Xuan.

Therefore, even though Xia ruofei was still much younger than Sun Xiao after taking on Xia Tian’s appearance, Sun Xiao still respectfully addressed Xia ruofei as “senior” and did not dare to be disrespectful.
