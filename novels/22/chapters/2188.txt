2189 A small internet celebrity (1)

Translator: 5496903Feng Jing’s Villa was right in front of them. Xia ruofei stopped in his tracks and smiled.”Since I’ve already promised him, I must go. It’s just recording an episode of the program, so there’s no need to go through all that trouble. I’ll just go over directly when the time comes. ”

“Your popularity on the internet isn’t any lower than those hot, young male stars!” Feng Rao grinned. How could xiangnan satellite TV dare to be negligent? I definitely have to communicate with you first. ”

“Is it that exaggerated?” Xia ruofei laughed bitterly.

“It’s not an exaggeration at all!” Feng Jing laughed and said,”all the internet celebrities these days have tender skin and tender flesh, but you turned the tide and saved a plane. If you were a little bigger, you’d definitely be the representative of a tough guy! In addition, you’re so young and have a net worth of hundreds of millions. This isn’t something that those young hunks can compare to. You can be said to be a clear stream in the world of internet celebrities!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”are you complimenting me or insulting me?” And a clear stream! I think it’s a mudslide. ”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Xia ruofei’s popularity on the internet was maintained not only because of his unique attraction and continuous topics, but also because of her. She had always insisted that Xia ruofei maintain a certain amount of exposure and had even appointed a person in the company to maintain Xia ruofei’s social media account.

Although Xia ruofei presented himself in front of the public and was not like some celebrities who carefully created their image, he still needed to keep showing off his image to maintain his popularity.

For someone like Xia ruofei who did not log in to Weibo for days, did not post any new posts, and did not interact with his fans, if there were no full – time operations staff to maintain his account, his popularity would have started to drop.

“Ruofei, I’ll get President Dong to contact xiangnan TV. If you have any requests or taboos, you can let me know. I’ll pass them on to Dong Yun,” said Feng Jing.

Xia ruofei replied casually,”I don’t have any requests. I don’t think of myself as a celebrity. I don’t have that many bad habits.” I’ll just be myself!”

“Alright!” Feng Rao said readily,”then you can go to Beijing one or two days earlier! The festival team will definitely need to discuss the program flow with you in advance. ”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll be staying at the three mountains for a while. Remember to remind me when the time comes!”

“Yes, yes!” Feng Rao nodded and said,”let’s go! Let’s go in and take a look!”

The two of them walked up the steps.

The townhouses were built against the mountains. There were four families in a row, and each family had a front yard. The middle was separated by a high wire fence, which was covered with plants, making it look like a green wall.

Feng Rao had bought the one at the end of the courtyard, which was much larger than the two in the middle.

Feng Rao took out her keys and opened the door. She walked into the courtyard with Xia ruofei. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The last time he was here, the yard was still full of weeds. Now, Xia ruofei saw that the weeds had been cleaned up, and the ground was neatly piled with some decoration materials.

Feng Jing smiled.”There was originally a parking space on each side of this place, but I can’t use two. If my friends come here occasionally, they can Park in the community, so I asked CEO Liang’s renovation company to change this parking space. We’ll use a grape rack made of anti – corrosion wood and a stone table below. It’s good to enjoy the cool in the summer.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”It’s pretty good. If you want to see the scenery or feel the river breeze, go to the balcony. If you want to be quiet, you can make tea under the grape trellis. It’s so nice!”

Because the house was built against the mountain, it was actually built on solid concrete piles. There were two floors below it, so there was a small covered bridge between the front yard and the entrance of the villa. The two of them passed through the yard, walked over the covered bridge, and arrived at the entrance of the villa.

As the house was still under renovation, they didn’t need to take off their shoes. After Feng Jing opened the door, the two of them walked straight in.

With the light in the room, Xia ruofei looked up and down and said,””Sister che, uncle Liang’s renovation company is quite efficient! They had already started to paint the walls! The water and electricity are all laid out?”

“Yeah!” Feng Rao nodded with a smile. We’ve finished the wiring. Other than the water and electrical circuits, we’ve also installed floor heating on the first and second floor. ”

“Not bad, not bad ...” Xia ruofei said as he watched.

Although the renovation wasn’t completed yet, he could basically see the layout of the design.

The first floor had a kitchen, dining room, and an open – Concept living room. The living room was connected to a large balcony that faced Min River.

Feng Rao smiled and pointed at the balcony. “I’m going to make a circle of fabric sofas here. Friends can have a barbeque, party, and chat here. It’s very convenient.”

Xia ruofei touched his nose and asked,””A cloth sofa on this open – Air balcony? What if it rains?”

Feng Rao chuckled and said,”it’s just a platform made of anti – corrosion wood and lacquer!” The cushion and cushion can be moved away at any time. Can’t you just take it out when you need it? Stupid!”

“I see ...” Xia ruofei laughed.

Feng Jing didn’t usually talk this much, but she really liked this house. She couldn’t stop talking about the design of the house. After all, she was the one who personally participated in the renovation plan and made several changes before coming up with it.
