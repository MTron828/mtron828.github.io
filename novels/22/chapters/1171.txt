Translator: 549690339

“Alright,” Song Wei said loudly,”you’ve seen her. Can we eat now?”

“Let’s eat! I have to give a toast to brother Xia later!”

“Of course! Brother Xia, from today onwards, you’re my idol!”

“Don’t fight with me for my idol! I’ll fight whoever tries to snatch it from me!”

The rich Playboys laughed and returned to their seats.

Although the atmosphere was still as warm as before, the feeling was different.

Previously, everyone was only polite to Xia ruofei because of Song Wei.

Even if Xia ruofei’s company was very big and could easily buy a courtyard house in the capital that was worth hundreds of millions, it was still not enough in the eyes of these rich men.

To put it bluntly, this was still an official – based society, especially the way of thinking of these wastrels. Unless they were as rich as Tang He and MA Xiong, it was difficult for ordinary merchants to gain their respect.

However, after Xia ruofei displayed his amazing medical skills, everything was different.

Who didn’t have a headache or a fever? They might not be interested in ordinary doctors, but they could tell that Xia ruofei’s medical skills were superb even if they were laymen. It would be great to make friends with such a miracle doctor.

Moreover, Song Wei had personally introduced Xia ruofei to everyone. Even if he did not have a strong background, his relationship with Song Wei was enough to make everyone think highly of him. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Therefore, everyone was passionate from the bottom of their hearts.

After the banquet started, one by one, people started to toast Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had developed a habit of drinking freely in the Army. He would not refuse anyone and would drink three glasses with anyone who was willing to. This made the rich men like him even more.

After the meal, all the rich men were calling Xia ruofei ‘brother’. The ladies looked at Xia ruofei differently.

However, with Song Wei and Lu You on his left and right, Xia ruofei could only sit still and did not dare to show any expression of being bewitched.

After the guests and the host had their fun, the party ended with Song Wei’s suggestion.

Song Wei heaved a sigh of relief in her heart. She had completed the task her father had given her.

That’s right. This gathering was organized by song Qiming. Song Wei’s purpose was the same as what song Rui did in the capital city a few days ago. She wanted Xia ruofei to get to know more friends.

Although not many of these rich Playboys were in politics, and even their ranks in the system were generally not very high, they were more reliable than anyone when it came to handling matters.

The group left the Chen family restaurant. Liu Zhe had originally proposed to hold another party and sing something.

But as soon as he said it, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Young man, don’t forget my doctor’s advice! Temperance, temperance ...”

Liu Zhe fled in the midst of everyone’s laughter.

However, he really listened to Xia ruofei’s words because Xia ruofei’s medical skills had already convinced him. He did not dare to disobey!

As the host, Song Wei saw everyone off at the door. In the end, only Song Wei, Lu You, and Xia ruofei were left at the entrance of Chen family restaurant.

“Ruofei, I’ll leave the difficult task of sending us home to you!” Song Wei said with a smile.

“As you command! I’ll go get the car now ...”

“Can you still drive?” Lu You quickly said,”why don’t we call a designated driver? You’ve drunk so much tonight ...”

“I’m fine!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Who am I? The doctor! I secretly massaged a few acupuncture points just now, and the smell of alcohol has already dissipated!”

“Really?” Lu You was a little skeptical.”This is not a joke! Drunk – driving is a serious crime these days!”

“Why Would I Lie to You? If you don’t believe me, you can smell it. There’s no smell of alcohol at all!”

Xia ruofei said as he breathed out at Lu You.

However, he regretted it immediately after he did it because it was too ambiguous.

Especially when he saw Song Wei looking at him with a half – Smile, Xia ruofei felt even more embarrassed.

Lu You’s face also turned slightly hot, but she felt sweet in her heart.

She quickly pretended to be nonchalant and said,””It really doesn’t smell like alcohol! Sister Weiwei, do you think Xia ruofei’s words can be trusted?”

“You should know him better than I do!” Song Wei said with a smile. Since he said there’s no problem, then there won’t be a problem!”

Xia ruofei clapped his hands and said,””Look at Song Wei’s words, it’s so comfortable to hear! Fine! Then it’s decided. You guys wait here for a while, I’ll go get the car!”

With that, Xia ruofei jogged to the parking lot.

Song Wei and Lu You stood still. After a moment, Lu You reacted and called out,””I was wondering why he was so forthright when he drank with others! Even the smell of alcohol had dissipated! No wonder he didn’t get drunk! Liu Zhe and his gang had even foolishly forced him to drink, and in the end, they had gotten themselves drunk! This guy is too cunning!”

With a smile on her face, Song Wei said gently, “Don’t the girls nowadays like this kind of bad guy?”

Lu You blushed and said,””That’s just those insensible little girls. A real mature girl is not so childish! I say ... Sister Weiwei, don’t tell me you’re in love with Xia ruofei?”

Song Wei blushed and said in a panic,”What nonsense are you saying! How is that possible?”
