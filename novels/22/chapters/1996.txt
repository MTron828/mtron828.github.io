1997 Urgent matter (1)

Among the plans that Xia ruofei had prepared, the first thing to do was to let Toles meet Satan. Only when this person died would Monica’s threat disappear. This was the most urgent matter.

He never had a sense of superiority over the law just because he had extraordinary strength. However, he didn’t have any psychological burden in killing a complete villain like Toles.

Of course, Xia ruofei was also clear that killing Toles was only a temporary solution. It would not solve the root problem.

Toles ‘death did not affect the German family’s suppression of the Grasso family. Xia ruofei didn’t care about the life and death of the Grasso family at all, especially when he heard that the head of the family had personally brought the family into such a predicament. After knowing that Toles had his eyes on Monica, the head of the family even sacrificed Monica in exchange for a chance for the family to breathe. This made him not have a good impression of the Grasso family at all.

However, Xia ruofei could not guarantee that without Toles, there would not be a second person in the Gehrman family who would covet Monica again. With the personality of the head of the Grao family, he would definitely not care about Monica’s wishes. He might even want to send Monica to his bed.

Therefore, if he wanted to completely help Monica solve her problem, it was far from enough to just get rid of Toles. The permanent way was naturally to uproot the entire Gelman family.

However, as the saying goes,”when there’s a carrot, there’s a stick.” The Gelman family was backed by the famous Italy glory club.

Xia ruofei did not know how influential the backer of the Gelman family was in the glory society, nor did he know how big the reaction of the glory society would be when they found out that something had happened to the Gelman family. However, he could not take the risk and act rashly.

Xia ruofei was not so blindly confident that he thought he could do anything just because he was a cultivator. In fact, a cultivator’s individual combat power might be many times stronger than the world’s strongest Special Forces soldier, but they were not invincible.

At least, as a Qi cultivation stage cultivator, Xia ruofei was still far from being able to ignore the power of the secular world.

Many firearms could pose a threat to Xia ruofei.

A large – caliber sniper bullet could take Xia ruofei’s life. Even if he had a natural sense of danger and could avoid a sniper bullet that was hundreds or even thousands of meters away, he could not be in such a nervous state all the time. It was a torture for anyone.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei had no doubt that as a long – established mafia organization, the glory society would definitely have firearms that were much more powerful than sniper rifles.

In addition, they had eyes and ears all over Europe. It was quite unwise to provoke such an enemy.

Xia ruofei’s many years of experience in the Army made him realize that he either had to not make a move or he had to kill with one strike. Otherwise, he would be in an extremely dangerous situation.

Especially in Italy where he was unfamiliar with the people and had many cross – Border combat experiences, Xia ruofei knew that he could never be too careful.

He couldn’t act rashly against the Gelman family, but killing Toles was an urgent matter.

Xia ruofei decided not to care about the subsequent arrangements. He had to achieve his first goal first.

Xia ruofei was very confident that he could kill Toles without anyone knowing.

The information that old Blake gave him was not really intelligence. It was just some surface information or public information. At most, he just summarized it. Old Blake could not provide much of the key information that Xia ruofei needed.

For example, the information on Toles was mostly about his misdeeds, but the key information about his frequent places, habits, hobbies, and other things were very vague.

Xia ruofei had to collect all these by himself.

After thinking for a long time, Xia ruofei stood up and left the hotel room.

He walked on the streets of Turin. It was getting dark, and many people were out of their homes. The streets were lit up with lights, and the exotic atmosphere was peaceful.

However, Xia ruofei knew that no city would be short of places to hide.

He strolled along the street, seemingly aimless, but in fact, he specifically picked the narrow streets and dimly lit sections. From time to time, he would look up curiously at the European – styled buildings on the side of the street. He looked like a true backpacker.

Xia ruofei quickly noticed the sound of soft footsteps behind him. At the same time, his spiritual power detected that there were a few people in front of him. He could not help but smile. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He quickened his pace, and the footsteps behind him were obviously more hurried.

Xia ruofei was like a Frightened Rabbit. He went from a quick pace to a small jog, and finally “panicked” and ran into a dead end.

At this moment, Xia ruofei turned around. A group of people appeared at the entrance of the alley behind him. They all had a mocking smile on their faces.

Xia ruofei frowned slightly. It was a little different from what he had imagined. This group of people were all black. In the dark alley, if one did not look carefully, they would not be able to see their faces clearly.

After all that hard work, not only did they not attract the gangsters, they attracted a group of black people instead? Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.
