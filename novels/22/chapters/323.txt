Chapter 324: I also have an overseas business (1)

The call was from Grandpa Tang He – after they had contacted each other yesterday – Grandpa Tang had saved Xia ruofei’s number. “Good Morning, old master Tang!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Brother Xia, do you have time this morning?” Elder Tang asked,”let’s find a place to finalize the details of our cooperation!” “No problem!” Xia ruofei asked,”which hotel are you staying at? I’ll come to you now!” “The Shangri – La in the city. Call me when you arrive!” Said elder Tang. “Alright!” Xia ruofei hung up the phone and stopped his inspection. Cao tieshu was very responsible anyway. The greenhouse was well taken care of, and he didn’t have to worry about the construction site. Liang Weimin didn’t know how to thank Xia ruofei. Yesterday, he had personally called manager li and instructed him to use the most serious attitude to create a high – Quality project. Therefore, manager li worked hard and stayed at the construction site all day. He didn’t even work so hard to build a house for his family. Half an hour later, Xia ruofei arrived at the Shangri – La hotel in the Knight XV SUV. In the reception area of the Presidential Suite, Xia ruofei and elder Tang were discussing the details of the cooperation with the Australian farms. Elder Tang’s assistant was in charge of taking notes. Because both sides had reached a consensus, there were almost no objections to some of the details, and they were quickly finalized. The two parties agreed that Grandpa Tang He’s paddinck farm in New South Wales, Australia, would be discounted at 40 million US dollars. Xia ruofei would invest 20.4 million US dollars and take 51% of the shares. Of which, 10 million was cash investment, 5 million was technical investment, and the remaining 5.4 million was deducted from the farm’s dividends. Originally, Xia ruofei had planned to give up the 5 million USD investment, but elder Tang had insisted. After Xia ruofei’s repeated rejections, elder Tang finally revealed his reason. It turned out that after the Phoebe zhennan material had been transported to the warehouse that Liang Weimin had rented near Changping Pier, elder Tang had asked Liang Weimin to find an experienced Carpenter to remove the remaining bark and edges of the material, revealing the true appearance of the material. The result made old master Tang extremely happy. In addition to the cloud patterns that were revealed when he “opened the window” that day, there were even more precious wave patterns on the material. Although it was not as rare as the highest quality wave patterns, it still increased the value of the entire material greatly. Moreover, this was only the outer part. If it was taken out and made into a plate, the inner lines might be even more surprising. Elder Tang had bought this material to make a longevity material for himself, so the rarer it was, the happier he was. Especially this kind of rare material, it couldn’t be bought with money. Hence, elder Tang felt that buying it for 10 million USD seemed to be a great bargain. Hence, he decided to compensate Xia ruofei for the farm cooperation. Since elder Tang had already made it clear, Xia ruofei could not reject him and agreed. In addition, the two sides also agreed to arrange for Xia ruoxin to fly to Australia to inspect the farm in the near future. Then, the first batch of vegetable seeds would be supplied to Taoyuan, and the business would gradually expand to other agricultural products. Xia ruofei had invested in paddinke farm under paradise corporation’s name, which meant that there were two major shareholders of paddinke farm, one being paradise Corporation and the other being Tang He’s grandfather. Therefore, in a sense, it could be said that patdink farm would become a subsidiary farm of paradise Corporation, because paradise Corporation was the major shareholder! The two also agreed to change the name of Paradise Farm, but the Westerners certainly didn’t understand the source of the word “paradise,” so the two discussed changing the name of padink farm to “Paradise Farm,” which had a similar meaning to Paradise Farm. At the same time, they would register the brand “paradise.” In the future, the agricultural products sold by paradise company in the West would be crowned with this new name. The two of them quickly finalized some details. Elder Tang’s assistant quickly added the details of their discussion into the contract and printed it out. This included the rights of elder Tang to race horses on the farm and the right to operate the breeding base for purebreds. Paradise Corporation had to ensure that Paradise Farm could cultivate vegetables of the same quality as paradise vegetables sold in China. All of these were written in the contract. The two of them read through it carefully and felt that there were no problems, so they signed it directly. Elder Tang had bought the farm under his own name, so all he needed was his signature and seal. Xia ruofei had come prepared and had brought the company’s seal with him, so the two signed a formal contract. After the contract was signed, Xia ruofei returned the ten million US dollars check to elder Tang. Elder Tang took the check and tore it into pieces. The money was still in his account, so he just had to tear the check. “Happy cooperation!” Elder Tang extended his hand to Xia ruofei happily.”In the future, when I go to Australia for a vacation, I can eat those delicious paradise vegetables at any time. Oh, no, we should call them celestial realm brand vegetables!” In elder Tang’s eyes, this was the most important point of their cooperation. As for how much the farm could earn, he didn’t really care. Xia ruofei also laughed and said,””After all the vegetables are planted on the farms in Australia, you can send a plane over to have them transported by air at any time! You’re not short of money anyway ...” Elder Tang raised his head and laughed. The assistant poured a glass of red wine for each of them. After they clinked their glasses, Xia ruofei took a small sip and asked,””Old man, are you going back to United States?” “Yeah!” Elder Tang nodded. I was supposed to leave this afternoon, but in order to finalize the cooperation with brother Xia, I pushed it back by a day. ” The appraisal of the farm in Australia and the relevant documents would take time, so elder Tang could only delay his trip. “By the way, old man, who have you decided to bring back to United States with you?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “It’s basically settled. Xiaojun and Lil Chao, the two children, will be coming back with me. ” Elder Tang smiled and said,”I will train them well. First, I will let them gain experience in the company’s basic positions. After that...It will all depend on their performance!” Xia ruofei was a little surprised. He knew that Liang Qichao was not very willing to go to United States, and he did not know how Liang Weimin had convinced him. As for Liang Xiaojun, Xia ruofei knew that he was capable. Otherwise, he would not have been able to get into a prestigious school and even get an MBA in the United States. However, Xia ruofei did not have a good impression of this person. He felt that his character was average. Elder Tang probably wanted to create a competitive atmosphere, so he brought both of them back to United States. However, this was elder Tang’s private matter and Xia ruofei was just asking casually. Naturally, he would not say much. Xia ruofei was curious about why Liang Qichao suddenly changed his mind and agreed to go to the US. So, after he left elder Tang’s place, Xia ruofei took out his phone and called Liang Qichao.
