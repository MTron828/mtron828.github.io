2854 Getting unjustly ridiculed (2)

Founded in Paris in 1924, AIPS was based in luosang, Switzerland, the capital of the Olympics. It was led by the president of the international news Union, Francois Reichel, and Victor Boin from Belgium.

It could be said that this organization was an authoritative organization formed by the sports media and was very influential.

AIPS’s statement was mainly to severely condemn The Sports Reporters ‘fraudulent behavior in news interviews. The statement stated that such behavior, which completely lost the basic ethics of news, should be spurned and boycotted by the entire industry. At the same time, it also issued severe criticism for the lack of security of the media organizations. It could be said that it was a flogging on both the daily sports news and Pablo.

This statement practically declared the end of Pablo’s career.

After all, AIPS had members all over the world, and almost all well – known sports media were its members. In theory, this statement represented everyone’s common attitude.

Under such circumstances, which media company would dare to risk universal condemnation and hire Pablo?

Major media outlets also rushed to report on the matter while taking the opportunity to trample on the daily sports news a few times.

After this incident, The Sports Daily had definitely suffered a huge blow. This loss of credibility would be difficult to make up for for in the future.

One of the key parties of this incident, Mayers, had also suffered a huge mental blow. In addition, many media outlets had been trying to interview him, which caused him a lot of trouble.

In addition, bar?a not only canceled his annual ticket, but also put him on the unpopular list, which meant that in the future, even if he spent his own money to buy a loose ticket, he would not be able to enter the nocapu Stadium.

Meyers was also disheartened. The feeling of being abandoned by his beloved club was even sadder than when his wife had left him.

Disheartened, Mayes sold the property and left Barcelona to live in another city.

Of course, this was all a story for later.

Xia ruofei, who had personally arranged everything and successfully ignited public opinion, did not continue to make any comments in the media after the press conference.

He was like a brilliant swordsman who, after defeating the enemy in one move, brushed his clothes and left.

In three days, it would be Espanyol’s home game against Herona. Xia ruofei’s schedule for the next few days was very simple. Every day, he would take half a day to train with the Espanyol club players, and the other half would accompany Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to continue touring the beautiful city with a long history.

RCD Espanyol’s home game against Herona was scheduled for around 1 p.m. Local time.

At this time, whether it was for the players participating in the game or the fans watching the game live, it was actually not very friendly.

However, almost all the remaining games of the Spanish clubs were held during this time period, and it was only recently adjusted by Spanish football.

Of course, this was not the Spain football Association deliberately targeting the Spanish clubs. Their adjustment was entirely out of market considerations.

Since Wu Lei joined Espanyol and Xia ruofei’s sudden appearance, the exposure of Espanyol clubs in China had greatly increased. In the past, the Chinese fans did not even know that there was such a team in La Liga. Now, after a few weeks, the Chinese fans knew the names of the players in Espanyol’s first team as if they were family treasures.

In particular, the few players who were willing to cooperate with Wu Lei, such as Granello, iglasias, and so on, became very popular in China.

Metatron and the others, who were very clingy to the ball and were not very willing to pass the ball to Wu Lei, became the players that Chinese fans hated the most.

The first match that Wu Lei participated in had tens of millions of people watching the live broadcast in China. There were also other channels that watched the text live broadcast and so on. The total population was even more than that of Spain.

The Spain football Association was also shocked by the number, so they quickly adjusted the game time.

All of Spain’s games were set to start at about 1 p.m. In China, it was just past 7 p.m., Which was the prime time.

Three days passed by in a flash, and soon it was the day of the Espanyol club’s home game against Herona.

PP sports, as always, set the Espanyol’s game as free to watch, and the game started at 7 p.m., Which was simply too good for the Chinese fans. After dinner, they could sit in front of the computer and wait for the game to start. Some fans got off work later, so they simply met up with their friends and went straight to the bar after work. They watched the game while drinking and eating skewers, which was quite carefree.

In Barcelona, although the game started at oneo’ clock in the afternoon, the Spanish fans were still very active. Before 12 o’ clock, a lot of fans had gathered at the home of the Spanish club, the El prate Stadium. Many of them were holding paper bags of McDonald’s and KFC in their hands. Obviously, these fans had not eaten lunch but bought some fast food directly and were ready to eat when they entered the stadium.

The Espanyol club players ‘training this morning was not very intense. It was mainly to adjust everyone’s state and practice free – kick tactics. Everyone was more relaxed.

The morning training also ended earlier than usual, and then the players had lunch together in the training base’s restaurant. After the meal, they took a short break and took a bus to elprart Stadium. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Since Xia ruofei had decided to participate in the competition, he did not want to make things special at a time like this. Hence, he was moving with the team.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, accompanied by Zhou leiyun, had lunch at the hotel they were staying at, and then drove to the El Prat Stadium.

Unlike in nocapu, this was the home ground of the Spanish, so the Spanish clubs naturally left the best box for their club chairman.

The private room that Zhou leiyun, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue were in was the best place to watch the match in the entire Stadium. Furthermore, there was a special passageway that allowed them to enter and exit without any external interference.

When they arrived at the box and took their seats, the Spanish players were warming up on the field before the game. Ling Qingxue saw Xia ruofei, who was fighting for the circle with Wu Lei, iGracias, mark Roca, and Granello at first glance.

The person in charge of snatching the ball in the circle was the tall and long – legged iglasias. The football passed quickly under everyone’s feet, and iglasias’s long legs did not play a role at all. It was precisely because he was taller that he was more or less clumsy, and he almost managed to snatch the ball every time.

In the end, Granello made a small mistake and kicked the ball away. It was only then that iglasias was released and it was Granello’s turn to go in and grab the ball.

Song Wei smiled and said,”ruofei, you look like you’re in good shape!” How about we bet on how many goals he can score today?”

Zhou leiyun thought for a moment and said,”that’s not easy to guess!” He can score two goals while playing bar?a, and he even has an assist. This Herona’s defense is much worse than bar?a ‘s. Who knows how many goals he can score?”

Ling Qingxue grinned.”There’s no point in guessing the number of goals scored. RUO Fei’s goal today is to score goals. He’ll definitely score as many as he can!”

“Yup!” Zhou leiyun said,”I heard that he even asked Ruby for unlimited shots. I think the players will give him more shots today and let him shoot freely. It’s hard to say how many goals he will score in the end!”

Song Wei thought for a while and said,”how about this ... Let’s guess how long it will take for him to finish his first goal!”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes lit up and she said,”that’s a good idea!” How about a bet on a meal? A big meal at the top restaurant in Barcelona! We’ll each say a time, and the person with the biggest difference will lose!”

“Sure!” Zhou leiyun laughed. Then I’ll go first! I think ... Within 20 minutes! Forget it ... Fifteen minutes! I’m guessing 15 minutes!”

“General manager Zhou, don’t you have too little confidence in RUO Fei?” Ling Qingxue said,”I think we can definitely score within ten minutes! I’ll take ten minutes! Wei Wei, it’s your turn!”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei, who had finished his warm – up and was walking back to the changing room. She thought for a while and said,”I feel that RUO Fei’s killing intent is very strong today. You guys are too conservative ... I guess ... Eight minutes! I think RUO Fei will score within eight minutes of the game!”
