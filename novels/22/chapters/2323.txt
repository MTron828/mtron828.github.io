2324 The omnipotent God (1)

Qian guiyou took the lead, and Bao Guijun was the last. The five of them rushed to the beach.

As they stepped on the soft and wet sand, a glimmer of hope gradually appeared in their originally nervous hearts. Because so far, everything had been unusually smooth.

They believed that as long as they could get their hands on the yacht, they would have a high chance of escaping.

Qian guiyou and the others rushed towards the yacht as the cold water reached their ankles. In a short while, the water was already at their waist, so they decided to swim forward.

The small yacht swayed gently with the waves and was already very close.

“Good luck!” Qian guiyou cheered everyone on excitedly.

They didn’t know that even if they could get the yacht, they could only go in circles in the space ocean at most. Now, they were like turtles in a jar. Where could they run to?

Of course, Xia ruofei would not let them come into contact with small yachts. He was still a bit of a clean freak. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Therefore, when Qian guiyou and the others swam desperately towards the yacht, they were shocked to find that they couldn’t move forward no matter how hard they tried. The yacht was just within reach, but they were just a little bit away.

“What’s going on?” Qian guiyou shouted in anger.

However, what made them feel even more devastated was that in the next moment, they were directly lifted up from the sea by an invisible force and suspended in mid – Air.

Then, to the horror of Qian guiyou, Bao Guijun and the others, Xia ruofei appeared out of thin air in front of them. It was as if he had teleported. One second, there was no one there, but the next moment, he appeared.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei was standing in the air. He was more than ten meters above the sea and he looked like an immortal.

Xia ruofei had a teasing smile on his face.””The game can end now ...”

Qian guiyou and the others were dumbfounded. What they had seen was beyond their knowledge. How could a person just float in the air without stepping on anything?

When they thought of Xia ruofei’s ability to change his appearance at will, they were filled with despair.

This made them think of the mysterious Eastern legends. Could this young man be a legendary immortal?

What happened next seemed to confirm their guess.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and the calm sea suddenly became violent. In an instant, it formed a huge wave that was dozens of meters high. Qian guiyou and the others watched in fear as the huge wave came crashing down on them.

In the face of nature’s might, humans seemed so small. The fear that came from the bottom of their hearts could not be suppressed. Qian guiyou and the others couldn’t help but scream in horror.

However, just as the huge wave was about to hit them, it suddenly stopped, as if it was frozen, and maintained its original shape.

Qian guiyou and the others had lost all ability to think. They looked up at the terrifying wave and didn’t even dare to breathe.

Xia ruofei waved his hand again and the wave that was strong enough to flip a ship disappeared into thin air. It turned into water vapor and returned to the sea.

Qian guiyou and the others felt their vision blur, and then they found themselves back in their original position.

The green grass and the faint smell of earth made them feel as if they had not been running for their lives, nor had they entered the ocean, nor had they encountered the terrifying waves. It was as if what they had just experienced was a dream.

However, her clothes were still wet, and it was very uncomfortable to stick to her skin. This made them realize that they weren’t dreaming at all. They had been teleported here by the ‘Huaxia deity’.

Qian guiyou and the others looked at Xia ruofei in a completely different light. They were full of respect and awe.

These mercenaries were all desperadoes, but no matter how unruly they were, they couldn’t resist when faced with a power that was on a completely different level.

Even Qian guiyou, who had killed Xia ruofei’s brother, was in despair. He knew that there was no chance of revenge.

The five of them looked at Xia ruofei in silence.

Xia ruofei’s gaze swept across them one by one.

Wei nation Qian guiyou.

Chinese, Bao Guijun.

The sniper was ruan Zhongyuan from annan.

There was also Park taishu from the bangziguo and Huang rujue from the Lusong.

Xia ruofei didn’t speak for a long time. Bao Guijun and the rest felt the pressure as heavy as a mountain. It was as if the air had frozen. The five of them didn’t even dare to breathe.

After a long time, Xia ruofei finally said,””You can make your choice now. You can either stay and work hard, or you can sacrifice yourself for the modr organization. I won’t interfere.”

Xia ruofei did not tease them. After all, if they wanted to commit suicide, he could not watch them all the time. Besides, these people deserved to die. If they wanted to commit suicide, Xia ruofei would not stop them.

If they were willing to work here, Xia ruofei would not mind making use of the waste.

It was not a difficult decision to make, especially after seeing Xia ruofei’s overwhelming power. It was a simple decision.

After all, it was better to live than die! With Xia ruofei’s strength, even if the modr organization used all their power, they would not be able to do anything to him. Besides, they were professional mercenaries and did not have a strong sense of belonging to the organization.
