Chapter 1443: the first Prince!

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,”old Xu, come in and have a seat.” What would you like to drink?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Brother Xia, don’t bother!” Xu Yougang quickly said,”just tell me if you need anything!”

Xia ruofei laughed and asked Xu Yougang to sit down on the guest sofa. Then he said,””Old Xu, do you have any retired comrades with better military qualities? Of course, the person must be absolutely reliable!”

“Brother Xia, are you looking to recruit some people to work in Australia?” Xu Yougang’s eyes lit up.

If they wanted to recruit people from China to work in Australia, they would need a work visa. Moreover, the security work was more special. They also needed to go through the procedures for holding a gun here. In addition, if people from China worked abroad, they would also need to issue an allowance. The labor cost was not much cheaper than directly recruiting people in Australia, and the process was more troublesome. Therefore, Xu Yougang and the other three people had discussed in the beginning stage and finally chose to recruit people in Australia to form a security team. Xia ruofei had agreed to this.

From Xia ruofei’s words, it seemed like he wanted to recruit some veterans.

In terms of feelings, Xu Yougang was naturally more willing to recruit some old comrades, so after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he couldn’t help but feel a little happy.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It doesn’t have to be working in Australia. I need to train some people first. They might be in Australia in the early stages so that they can participate in the work here while training. Later on, I plan to transfer them to other Places to Work.”

Xia ruofei was making plans for the construction of green cloud Island.

In terms of the safety of green cloud Island, the Liu family’s approach was to put a mercenary army on the island and use money to solve the problem.

Although this would save a lot of trouble, there were also many hidden dangers. Mercenaries only recognized money, and loyalty was nothing at all. Moreover, once they encountered a strong enemy, after paying a certain number of casualties, the mercenaries would most likely collapse and escape. After all, at that time, survival was the most important.

Besides, Xia ruofei needed to do some renovations on clear sky Island. When the time came, the safety issues would have to be handed over to reliable people, not mercenaries.

He did have some men in the spirit map space, but Xia ruofei could not control them in the outside world. Hence, he could not use them to guard the Azure cloud Island. To put it bluntly, these people were destined to spend the rest of their lives in the spirit map space, unless Xia ruofei obtained a method similar to the soul seal in the future and could control a large number of ordinary people.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Xu Yougang didn’t dare to ask more. He nodded and said,””I definitely have the manpower. I have a lot of comrades who have excellent military quality, and many of them have not been doing well in their jobs after they retired. How many people do you want?”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”at least a hundred!” “But I’ll also recruit them through other channels. You can recruit as many as you can. You must follow the principle of” better quality than quantity. “Although we’re all brothers from the Army, everyone’s experience after retirement is different. The necessary screening is still necessary. It’s not that I don’t trust my brothers.”

“I understand, brother Xia!” Xu Yougang said with a straight face. I’ll definitely do a good job in this aspect. I’ll take responsibility for any problems that arise with the people I’ve recruited!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”not that serious!” I’m just giving you a reminder!”

After the recruitment, Xia ruofei would have to “interview” them one by one. The so – called interview would be to hypnotize them with spiritual power and screen them one by one to prevent people with ulterior motives from sneaking in.

After all, once the great formation of the green cloud Island was successfully set up, the importance of the island would be second only to the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei continued,”also ... You have to make it clear to your comrades that the workplace is not in China, so it’s best not to have too many people holding you back. If the elderly at home are not in good health or the children are very young ... Of course, I’m not saying that we don’t want to do it in such a situation. You have to make it clear to them and let them decide for themselves.”

“Understood!” Xu Yougang said,”brother Xia, if that’s the case, I might have to go back to China first. After all, there are some things that can’t be clearly explained over the phone. Also, you said it yourself. We still have to go through some screening!”

Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”arrange the work here today and let Wang Chong temporarily take charge.” You’ll be flying back with me tomorrow!”

“Yes!” Xu Yougang stood up and answered firmly.

……

After Xia ruofei took a short break at noon, he went to visit Paradise Farm and the two wineries in the afternoon. He also listened to Liang Qichao and Old West’s progress reports and gave them full recognition for their work.

After a night’s rest at Paradise Farm, Xia ruofei, Liu Kuan, and Xu Yougang left the farm in a car the next morning and went straight to Sydney’s Kingford Smith Airport.

After a night’s rest, Liu An and the flight crew were “full of energy”. They were all in high spirits. When Xia ruofei and the others entered the landing strip through the public service plane passageway, they were already prepared for flight.

Ten minutes later, paradise took off from the runway of Kingsford Smith Airport and leaped into the sky.
