Chapter 748: Flower Guardian (3)

There was nothing wrong with the entire process.

However, Xia ruofei would not let his guard down. He noticed that while Hu Lili and Lin Qiao were drinking, Xue Fei was talking to his classmates on the other camera. However, he kept glancing at them from time to time, seemingly uneasy.

In private room 607, after Lin Qiao’s “golden body”, which did not touch a single drop of alcohol, was broken, many students began to toast to her. After all, she had done so well in the college entrance examination and was basically in the top ten in her class. Moreover, she was beautiful, so many boys had some ideas about her!

Lin Qiao didn’t want to be biased. As long as someone toasted to her, she would only take a small sip.

Even so, the beer was soon finished.

Lin Qiao didn’t have a high tolerance for alcohol. Although it was only a can of beer, her pretty face was already a little red.

At this moment, Hu Lili came over again with a bottle of mineral water in her hand. She smiled at Lin Qiao and said,””Lin Qiao, you can’t drink too fast or you’ll get drunk easily. Come, drink some water first and calm down!”

“Thank you,” Lin Qiao said with a friendly smile.

She took the bottle of water.

Xia ruofei stared at the screen quietly. This bottle of water was exactly the same as the mineral water the waiter brought. He saw that Lin Qiao twisted the bottle hard when she opened it, so it should not have been opened before. Although he frowned, he continued to observe quietly.

This small bottle of mineral water was only about two to three hundred milliliters. Lin Qiao felt a little thirsty after drinking some wine. After drinking a few mouthfuls, half of the water in the bottle had been gone.

At this time, another classmate came to propose a toast. Lin Qiao put the bottle of mineral water on the table in front of her, opened another can of wine, clinked it with her classmate, and took a small sip.

......

The classmate who came to propose a toast was standing beside Lin Qiao and blocked Hu Lili. Xia ruofei immediately used his spiritual power to command one of the Hornets to change its position and aim the camera at Lin Qiao.

However, when the camera turned to Lin Qiao, Hu Lili had already left with a smile.

Xia ruofei looked at the half – filled bottle of water on the screen and frowned. However, he remembered that Lin Qiao still had his specially concocted “hangover medicine,” so he didn’t act rashly. Xia ruofei also didn’t want to disturb Lin Qiao’s class reunion unless it was absolutely necessary.

On the screen, Lin Qiao didn’t sing. She was just sitting and chatting with her classmates and drinking. Before she knew it, the bottle of mineral water was finished and there were three beer bottles in front of Lin Qiao.

This can of beer didn’t have a large capacity. In total, there was only a little more than one bottle. Normally, an ordinary person wouldn’t get drunk after drinking so little alcohol. However, Lin Qiao felt a little dizzy and her body felt hot as if the alcohol had gotten to her head.

She felt that she might have drunk too much, so when her classmates came to propose a toast, she declined them with the excuse that she couldn’t hold her liquor. She wanted to rest for a while and get up to leave when her head wasn’t so dizzy.

However, even after resting on the sofa for a few minutes, her dizziness did not get any better. Instead, it seemed to be getting worse.

At this moment, Lin Qiao thought of the “hangover medicine” that Xia ruofei had prepared for her. It was definitely not good to take out a bottle of medicine and drink it in front of so many students. Besides, after drinking so much beer and mineral water, Lin Qiao also wanted to go to the toilet. So, she picked up her bag and walked to the toilet.

Xia ruofei had been staring at the surveillance footage on the computer, especially at Xue Fei and Hu Lili, who were also his main targets.

He saw that the moment Lin Qiao stood up, Xue Fei gave Hu Lili a look. Hu Lili, who was sitting near the bathroom door, immediately stood up, rushed into the bathroom, and locked the door from the inside.
