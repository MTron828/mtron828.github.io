2440 Unlocking the Jade talisman (1)

Elder song’s kind reminder warmed Xia ruofei’s heart.

However, he was also very clear that there was already a Rift between him and the Liu family. Even if he sped up the treatment, the Liu family would not be grateful.

This was also why Xia ruofei had defined this treatment as a pure deal from the beginning.

He directly took the pharmaceutical Group from the Liu family, and the song family also got a lot of benefits. For the Liu family, this was no different from cutting their flesh.

In addition, the conflict between Xia ruofei and Liu haojun had been going on for a long time. The reason why Liu haojun went to the extreme this time was because he had failed in his battle with Xia ruofei and ruined his future.

It was basically impossible for them to live in peace with the Liu family.

Of course, Master Song was also thinking for Xia ruofei. Even if they could not make peace, at least they did not have to offend the Liu family. After all, a family of the Liu family’s scale, even if they had suffered some losses in several confrontations, was still a huge force. Moreover, as long as old master Liu was still alive, the losses of the Liu family would not be a big deal. In elder song’s eyes, Xia ruofei did not need to go against such a big family.

This was also why elder song had used Liu haojun’s matter to negotiate with elder Liu. He had been determined to draw Xia ruofei’s name out of this matter.

Xia ruofei nodded,”I understand, Grandpa song ...”

Although Xia ruofei didn’t agree with elder song’s point of view, he still appreciated the concern of an elder.

In fact, as his cultivation level increased, Xia ruofei’s mentality was also slowly changing. In his mind, the Liu family’s threat was far less than those in the world of cultivation. He also did not really take the Liu family, who seemed to be invincible to others, seriously.

Elder song saw that Xia ruofei didn’t want to say more, so he smiled and didn’t mention it again.

Then, elder song asked about Xia ruofei’s company and the construction of the club in the capital.

When he heard that the club’s basic construction was completed and would be ready to go into operation soon, elder song said with relief,””Xiao Rui has changed a lot recently. In the past, this child had nothing to do every day, but now, he’s starting to look like he’s doing something serious!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Grandpa song, Xiao Rui is a good person. He just needs a chance to prove himself.”

Actually, there was something that Xia ruofei did not say. Song Rui’s elders were all too outstanding. They were simply dazzling. It was actually very stressful to grow up in such a family.

In song Rui’s words, if they did well, they would be the help of the family and would have no sense of existence at all. If they did not do well, they would be like mud that couldn’t hold up the wall and would be pointed at every day.

“It’s Xiao Rui’s good fortune to have met you as a friend ...”Elder song sighed.

“Please don’t say that.” Xia ruofei said,”Xiao Rui has helped me a lot too. For example, I didn’t do anything for the club this time. It was Xiao Rui, brother Zhao Yongjun, and a few others who were busy.”

Elder song waved his hand.”To you, the peach blossom banquet is just a small part of the fun. You’re an entrepreneur now. How can you just spend all your time with them?”

Xia ruofei said humbly.

What a joke! With his net worth, he was naturally a rich man in the eyes of ordinary working class people, but he was still not enough to enter the eyes of the person in front of him. Even now, the scale of the song family’s Financial Group was far from what Xia ruofei’s paradise Corporation could compare to, not to mention the projects that could easily cost tens or even hundreds of billions before elder song retired.

A few days ago, Xia ruofei had taken the time to check his assets. Other than the peach blossom company, his overseas account now had about 2.5 billion US dollars. Most of it was from the “black – Market” trip to Africa.

However, even so, all of his assets were only converted to about 10 billion Chinese dollars. Even among private enterprises, it was far from the standards of the first group, not to mention that there were many giant state – owned enterprises in China.

The old and the young sat in the dining room and chatted for a while. Then, elder song pulled Xia ruofei to the study room to play two games of chess. He also asked Xia ruofei to stay for lunch at the song family’s house before letting him go home.

Manager Lu couldn’t help but feel envious.

Elder song admired Xia ruofei from the bottom of his heart. Even among the direct descendants of the song family, few could compare to Xia ruofei in admiration.

Manager Lu also had a good impression of Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei could be said to be successful at a young age and had the full support of people like elder song. However, he was never arrogant and had a calmness that did not match his age.

What was even more valuable was that Xia ruofei had never used elder song’s influence for his own convenience. Although he was close to the song family, he had always maintained a gentleman’s friendship. His magnanimity and breadth of mind had already surpassed most people.

Therefore, when he personally sent Xia ruofei out, manager Lu’s attitude towards Xia ruofei was much warmer. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“RUO Fei! Next time, remember to bring me two sets of jaded skin ointment!” Manager Lu smiled and said,”the higher – ups in my family have already given me a death order. If I don’t complete the task, I can’t enter the house!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”manager Lu, it’s just a small matter. You can just say the word!” How about this! Please send me your address and auntie’s contact information. I’ll arrange for someone to send it to Auntie regularly!”
