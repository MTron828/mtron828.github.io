1995 Turin (1)

After Xia ruofei had booked the plane ticket, he stayed in the courtyard house. Other than Zhao Yongjun, he didn’t alert anyone to his trip to Beijing, including song Rui, Hou Liang, and the others. He didn’t plan to contact Song Wei either. Everything would have to wait until he returned from Italy.

The next morning, Xia ruofei said to Wu Qiang while they were having breakfast,””I left in the morning. I’ll be away for a few days.”

“Alright, chief Xia!” Wu Qiang quickly replied. Then I’ll go prepare the car!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”You don’t need to send me off today. I’ll leave by myself in the morning.”

Wu Qiang didn’t dare to ask further and immediately replied,”Understood!”

After breakfast, Xia ruofei rested in the courtyard for a while before leaving the courtyard house with a simple backpack.

He took a taxi at the entrance of the alley, but he didn’t go directly to the airport. Instead, he went to the crowded Wang Fujing department store and went into the bathroom of the shopping mall.

When Xia ruofei came out again, she was a completely different person. She looked exactly the same as on her passport. Her clothes, pants, and shoes had all been changed, including her watch and other accessories. Her backpack had also been changed into a small suitcase.

The mall was filled with people, so naturally, no one would notice the difference between the people who entered and exited a certain cubicle.

Xia ruofei dragged his small suitcase out of the mall and hailed a taxi to the airport.

He had just gotten out of the car at the airport when his phone rang. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei walked towards the International departure hall and took out his phone. It was old Blake.

“Hello, Mr. Blake!” He answered the call.

“Mr. Xia!” Old Blake said with a smile,”are you satisfied with the information I sent you yesterday?”

“Of course! I’m very satisfied!” Xia ruofei said,”thank you, Mr. Blake!”

“It’s nothing, Mr. Xia, you don’t have to take it to heart. ” Old Blake smiled and said,”since this information is useful to you, then I’m relieved!”

“Mr. Blake, this information will be very useful to me! Thank you very much!” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, I sent you an email yesterday. Did you see it?”

“I see it!” Old Blake said,”don’t worry! I’ve already deleted that email!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei asked,”what’s the matter?”

“Oh, I just wanted to remind you that the batch of young geese you want should arrive at Sanshan airport today,” old Blake said.”I’ve already sent the receipt to your email. You can use it once it’s printed out. Don’t forget about it!” Those little guys have been hungry for more than ten hours, so we have to feed them as soon as possible!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but Pat his forehead. He had been thinking about Monica for the past two days and had completely forgotten about this matter.

However, he didn’t want old Blake to know that he wasn’t in the Sanshan, and he didn’t want old Blake to think that he might have gone to Italy, so he immediately said,””I know! Mr. Blake, thank you for your reminder! I’ll get the goods in time!”

“That’s good! That’s good!” Old Blake said with a smile,”Mr. Xia, I won’t disturb you anymore. Goodbye!”

“Goodbye, Mr. Blake!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei immediately checked his email. As expected, old Blake had sent him a new email.

The batch of young geese would arrive at Sanshan at around threeo’ clock in the afternoon by transnational flight. After inspection, quarantine and other procedures, the procedures should be completed at about four – thirty at the earliest.

This procedure did not directly take the young goose away, but required it to be isolated in the isolation field for 30 days. The procedure only required a one – time 30 – day feeding fee. All living animals needed to go through an isolation process to prevent the spread of unknown diseases into the country.

Xia ruofei pondered for a while and gave Ling Qingxue a call.

“Ruofei, you should be in the capital by now, right?” Ling Qingxue chuckled and asked,”how come you have time to call me?” Shouldn’t you be having fun with brother Zhao and the others?”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”wife, we’re not as bad as you say.” I came to Beijing to work, okay?”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and asked,””Right, how’s the progress at the club?”

Ling Ji F & B also had shares in this Club project. Most importantly, there would be a branch of Ling Ji private kitchen in the club, so Ling Qingxue was also very concerned about this project.

Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry!” Brother Zhao and the others have a lot of connections in Beijing, and the project is progressing very smoothly. The construction team has already entered the site for construction. ”

“That’s good! I’ll come over to take a look when I have time!” Ling Qingxue said.

“Alright! When you have time, just let me know. I’ll ask Captain Liu to apply for a flight route in advance, and the private plane will send you there!”

“That’s so extravagant!” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”as expected, you’re not spending your own money. You don’t even feel the pinch!”

“What are you saying?” Xia ruofei said,”even if it’s my own money, I won’t feel bad! I can spend money on my wife without even blinking!”

“Yo, yo, yo! Why are you so sweet – tongued today?” Ling Qingxue said,”don’t tell me you have something to ask of me?”

“Hehe! Wife, there’s something I really need you to do for me. ” Xia ruofei said,”I’m in the capital and can’t leave for a while! But I asked someone to buy a batch of young geese from Europe. They should be delivered to Sanshan airport today, so I need you to help me with the procedures. “
