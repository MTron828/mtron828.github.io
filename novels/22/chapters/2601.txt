2602 A new plan (1)

When Xia ruofei was making the list, he did not just write down the names of the herbs. Otherwise, the Liu family would not be able to find them. Hence, he also used words to describe each herb and even drew simple illustrations.

Because of this, the Liu family realized that the “sky’s will parasite” that was auctioned in Malaysia three years ago was most likely the “Amethyst blood radish” that Xia ruofei had listed.

“Is that so?” Liu Chongli’s spirits were lifted.”Then let’s hurry up and think of a way to buy it!”

No matter how hard they tried and how many resources they used, the results they got were all disappointing. It could be said that the news that Liu Qunfeng had just brought was the only good news in the past two days.

Although there were more than a dozen herbs on the list, and it was useless to just find the “Amethyst blood radish,” he was still one step closer to success.

“Uncle Chongli, do you know how much this ‘sky’s will Gu’ was sold for back then?” Liu Qunfeng asked with a bitter smile. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“How much?” Liu Chongli asked subconsciously.

” 200 million! And it’s in US dollars!” Liu Qunfeng said,”of course, the problem isn’t the price. If we really want to buy it, it’s not like our Liu family can’t afford it. However, the person who bought the ‘heaven’s will kun’ was Hardy MA from Kuala Lumpur. This person’s family was very powerful in Malaysia, and they didn’t lack money at all. Once the item fell into their hands, the possibility of buying it back was extremely low. Moreover, that auction has already been over for three years. If they didn’t buy a medicinal herb just to keep it at home, this ‘heaven’s will Gu’ might have already been used up!”

Liu Chongli couldn’t help but feel disheartened. He said,”Then after all this, we’re still overjoyed for nothing!”

“You can’t say that ... At least this information answers your question,” Liu Qunfeng said. “Mr. Xia didn’t make up the list. It’s just that these herbs are too precious to be collected in a short time.” In addition, it also shows how precious the pills Mr. Xia provided before were!”

“Speaking of this, I’m reminded of that unfilial daughter, Liu Lifang!” Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but reveal his anger again.”What she did was simply disastrous!”

This time, even Liu Chongli couldn’t refute it. He could only silently nod his head in agreement.

“In the past, some people in the family were quite critical about the ‘treatment fee’ that Mr. Xia charged, thinking that the price was too high. Now it seems that Mr. Xia has already offered a good price!”

Liu Chongli couldn’t help but blush. He was one of the family members who had a lot of opinions about Xia ruofei taking away the pharmaceutical Group.

Because the annual profits generated by the pharmaceutical Group were quite considerable, as the head of the family group, Liu Chongli was naturally reluctant to cut off this fat piece of meat. However, at that time, it was the decision made by old man Liu himself. In this family, it could be said that old man Liu’s words carried enormous weight. What he said was the Golden Rule, and no one dared to refute him.

Liu Qunfeng didn’t notice Liu Chongli’s awkward expression. He only sighed and said,””Although we’ve already made sufficient preparations for the difficulties, it seems that the task of finding all the medicinal ingredients on the list is much more difficult than we thought. I’m afraid ... We won’t be able to complete it ...”

“Maybe Mr. Xia has other ways ...” Liu Chongli said with a trace of luck.

“I hope so!”

After Liu Qunfeng finished, he couldn’t help but sigh.

At this time, a voice came from the headphones of a big Man in Black standing at the door of the room. After hearing it, he was stunned for a moment, then quickly walked into the room, bowed slightly to Liu Qunfeng and Liu Chongli, and said,”Chief Liu, the sentries at the gate have news. Mr. Xia is here!”

Liu Qunfeng’s spirits lifted, and he ran outside without hesitation. As he ran, he said,””Uncle Chongli, quickly! Let’s go and welcome them!”

……

At that moment, Xia ruofei’s Toyota Elfa had already stopped in the courtyard.

When the electric door opened slowly, Xia ruofei saw Liu Qunfeng running out to greet him. Not far behind him was a panting Liu Chongli.

After all, Liu Chongli was an old man, and his hands and feet were not as agile as Liu Qunfeng ‘s, so he looked a little embarrassed.

“Mr. Xia! You’re here!” Liu Qunfeng ran down the stairs in one breath. He was still a little breathless, but he quickly shook hands with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded and asked directly,””Chief Liu, I wonder how many herbs you’ve found?”

Liu Qunfeng looked embarrassed and said,””Mr. Xia, we’ve already used all our resources to search for it, but so far, we haven’t found a single one of them ...”

Xia ruofei wasn’t surprised by the result and just nodded.

Liu Qunfeng continued,””However ... We’ve managed to find out a little bit about the purple crystal blood radish,”

Then, Liu Qunfeng told Xia ruofei about the underground auction in Malaysia that he had heard a few minutes ago.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel surprised. The herbs he had listed were considered rare in the world of cultivation. He didn’t expect that the Amethyst blood radish would really appear in an underground auction in the secular world.
