Chapter 1445: Consultant (2)

Translator: 549690339

The only exception was that Feng Jing chose to spend the Spring Festival on the farm this year, while Dong Yun insisted on coming over every day.

She didn’t ask for the car that the company had arranged for her. She drove the beetle to the farm at nineo’ clock every day and left at FiveO’ clock in the evening.

Xia ruofei did not know how much information Dong Yun had read in the company over the past few days or how many suggestions she had given to the company’s management, system, and other aspects. In any case, during working hours, Dong Yun would either be buried in documents in her small office or have an intense exchange with Feng Jing in her office.

Xia ruofei was speechless at her serious attitude. Success was not something that could be achieved easily. It was not just her talent that allowed her to have her current position in the industry.

It was not until the 29th of December that Xia ruofei finally “blocked” Dong Yun at the general building after work.

“Miss Dong, it’s New Year’s Eve tomorrow, and I’m going to be on vacation. You can rest at home for a few days,” he said with a smile.

In fact, the peach blossom company had already started their holiday a few days ago, but Dong Yun still insisted on coming over every day.

“Isn’t sister che still in the company?” Dong Yun asked.

After a few days of getting along, the relationship between the two beautiful women, who had a lot in common, had become much closer.

Xia ruofei was speechless. If he had not specifically instructed him today, this elite Dong would have really planned to come over on New Year’s Eve. Did he have to be so dedicated?

“Boss Feng needs to rest too! After all, it’s the new year ...”Xia ruofei explained patiently,” besides, don’t you have to spend time with your family?”

“Just go home and have New Year’s Eve dinner!” Dong Yun said.

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Anyway, I’m definitely on holiday. You’re not allowed to come over tomorrow. Stay at home and accompany Auntie. Help her prepare the New Year’s Eve dinner!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Alright then!” Dong Yun said as she shrugged her shoulders.

“By the way,” she added,”I hope to go to Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory for a few days for research after the spring Festival. I hope President Xia can approve it!”

Since she had agreed to be a consultant for the Paradise Corporation, Dong Yun had to do her best. The Paradise pharmaceutical factory was a very important part of the Paradise Corporation, so she had to do a field trip. There were many problems that couldn’t be discovered just by being in the office.

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”after the seventh day of the first lunar month, you can come over at any time. I will inform factory manager Xue!” As for the legal seven – day leave, I don’t want to see you in the company anymore! Listen to me and keep Auntie company!”

“I know!” The corners of Dong Yun’s mouth curled up slightly, and a faint dimple appeared on her face.”President Xia, I’ll be going back then!”

“Mm! Please send my regards to Auntie!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I also wish you a Happy New Year in advance!”

“Received!” Dong Yun opened the car door and got in. She waved at Xia ruofei and drove towards the farm.

It was the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month, New Year’s Eve.

Xia ruofei woke up early in the morning and persevered in completing his daily cultivation. After washing up, he went downstairs in high spirits.

The company’s cafeteria was also on holiday. However, considering that there were still employees left behind, Xia ruofei asked ye Lingyun to organize a few veterans who had worked in the cookhouse during their service to cook a small amount of food every day.

Ye Lingyun also chose to stay, mainly because nearly half of the Veterans in the security Department had gone home for the new year. He was a little worried. In addition, he had younger brothers and sisters who had all gone home for the new year. The old man would not feel too lonely without him, so he planned to skip the Spring Festival and take a few days off after the seventh day of the first lunar month.

Jiang Hua, who was in the pomfrets breeding workshop, was also worried about the treasures, so he chose to stay behind.

However, he had brought his wife and children over, and the whole family was spending the new year on the farm.

Xia ruofei had also specially approved an apartment for the company’s leaders so that Jiang Hua and his family could have a Happy New Year on the farm.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the canteen, the ex – soldiers had already prepared breakfast.

There were no more than 20 people left on the farm, so breakfast was simple porridge, buns, mantou, and eggs, as well as some delicious side dishes.

Feng Jing also arrived at the canteen on time, and everyone greeted each other joyfully.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing went around the farm.

This included the gate guard, the vegetable greenhouse, the Chinese perch cultivation workshop, the office guards...Every time they went to a place, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing would thank the staff who stayed behind for their hard work and then take out the red packets that they had prepared.

This was the most important Festival for Chinese people, but these employees still stuck to their posts. As the company’s leaders, it was necessary to give them the necessary condolences.

Xia ruofei even specifically instructed ye Lingyun to arrange for the Veterans to prepare some dumplings and send them to the people on night shift.

Even if they paid four or five times the salary, they couldn’t do without this kind of humanistic care. Sometimes, a few steaming dumplings were far more able to give employees a sense of belonging to the company than an extra thousand Yuan.

After consoling the farm, Xia ruofei and Feng Jing drove to Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory.

Compared to the deserted Taoyuan farm, this place was much more lively.
