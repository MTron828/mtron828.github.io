Tian Huixin smiled bitterly. She thought for a while and said,””Mom is talking about a real brother, just like ... Yuanyuan from your class and her brother Junhao.”

This time, Huanhuan seemed to understand a little. A hint of joy gradually appeared in her eyes as she said,””I understand! Just like Yuanyuan and brother Junhao, they both had the same parents! But ...”

The little girl looked confused again and asked,””But you’re not uncle Xia’s mother!”

Tian Huixin couldn’t help but blush. She coughed a few times to ease the awkwardness and said,””I’m asking if you’re willing to let uncle Xia be your brother, just like brother Junhao and Yuanyuan. I’m not saying that uncle Xia was born by mom ...”

This explanation made Xia ruofei feel a little awkward.

Huan Huan finally understood. She tilted her head and thought for a while before saying,””I’m willing! With brother Junhao around, the boys in the class never dared to bully Yuanyuan! I can be like Yuanyuan in the future!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Huanhuan, I may not be able to protect you like how Junhao protected Yuanyuan, because I don’t need to go to primary school anymore! But I’ll treat you as well as my own sister!”

Huan Huan seemed a little disappointed, but she still nodded and said,”Okay ... Then ... Does that mean I can’t call you uncle Xia anymore?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Didn’t you call me big brother RUO Fei a while ago?”

“Alright! Brother ruofei!” Huan Huan said.

He could tell that she was quite obsessed with the title ‘uncle Xia’.

MA Xiong was overjoyed and quickly said,”Xia Sheng, this is great news! After the auction is over, I’m going to hold a banquet and announce this good news! Also...Huanhuan, you can just call me big brother from now on, not big brother ruofei!”

The people of Hong Kong attached great importance to God – relatives. This was a connection that was second only to blood relations. In some big families, some of the more Capable God – sons would also have the right to inherit the family.

And to acknowledge godly relatives, one often needed to invite friends to a banquet, which was more or less the meaning of announcing to the world.

Huan Huan blinked her big eyes. She did not know why she had changed the way she addressed Xia ruofei. However, she was very close to Xia ruofei, so it was not difficult for her to change the way she addressed him.

Huan Huan had been very obedient since she recovered, so she immediately nodded and said,”I know, Grandpa!”

Then, she looked at Xia ruofei sensibly. Her expression was a little embarrassed, but she still called out,””Big brother!”

Hearing Huanhuan’s soft voice, Xia ruofei’s heart seemed to melt. He replied happily,””Woof! Huanhuan, it seems like I have to prepare a gift for you!”

“Xiasheng, you’ve given Huanhuan enough. You don’t have to give her this gift!” MA Xiong said hurriedly.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no way!” Acknowledging her as his godsister was an extremely important matter. However, I can’t give you this gift right now. I have to think about what gift I should prepare for my sister!”

Then, Xia ruofei continued,”old Mr. MA, since I’ve acknowledged Huanhuan as my sister, we’re all one family now. I think we should change the way we address each other. How about this? I’ll call you Grandpa MA and Mr. MA, uncle MA. You can call me ruofei like aunt Huixin!”

Of course, MA Xiong couldn’t ask for more. He laughed so hard that he couldn’t close his mouth.”Alright! RUO Fei, then Zhiming and I will be in big trouble!”

Although it was only a change in the way they addressed each other, everyone immediately felt that the distance between them was much closer. Huanhuan could also feel the harmony between the adults and was very happy.

After they chatted for a while, MA Xiong said,””Zhiming, Huixin, take Huanhuan home and rest! I still have something to discuss with ruofei!”

“Okay, daddy!” Ma Zhiming said immediately.

Tian Huixin also said to Huan Huan, who was still in Xia ruofei’s arms,””Huanhuan, let’s go! Come home with mom and dad. ”

“Mom, I want to stay a little longer ...” Huan Huan said reluctantly.

Xia ruofei patted Huanhuan’s head and said with a smile,””Huanhuan, you’re at the age where you’re still growing, so you have to make sure you get enough sleep. Be good and go home with mom and dad to rest first. You can still see your brother tomorrow! I’ll be staying in Hong Kong for a few more days this time, so I’ll have some fun with you!”

“Alright then!” Huan Huan was very obedient to Xia ruofei. Although she was reluctant, she still agreed obediently.

Xia ruofei put Huan Huan down. Tian Huixin held her hand and said goodbye to Xia ruofei. The couple left the Presidential Suite with Huan Huan, who turned back to look at them every few steps.

“Ruofei, I can’t help but feel a little jealous when I see Huanhuan’s attachment to you!” MA Xiong exclaimed.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Grandpa MA, you’re Huanhuan’s grandfather. Blood is thicker than water. No one can replace that.”

“Yup!” MA Xiong said,”moreover, Huanhuan was diagnosed with autism when she was very young. I never dared to imagine that she would be able to communicate with us normally one day. As for her calling me grandfather in person, that was even more of a dream! It has already far exceeded our expectations. RUO Fei, just for this, our Ma family will always be grateful to you!”

Xia ruofei said,”Grandpa MA, didn’t we agree not to talk about this?” We’re a family, you’re being too polite by saying this!”

“That’s right!”MA Xiong said, feeling comforted. Family! We’re family!”

MA Xiong calmed himself down and said,”Ruofei, since we’re a family now, we can’t talk like two different families, right? Therefore, all the expenses of this auction will be covered by our Hengfeng group!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”that won’t do!” Relationships are relationships, business is business. You can’t not accept the money that should be collected, otherwise, how can we cooperate in the long run?”

“You’re Huanhuan’s godbrother, and I’m Huanhuan’s grandfather. I’m just providing the venue and resources for your company’s auction. What’s the big deal?” MA Xiong said.

“No, no, no! You can’t calculate it like this. ” Xia ruofei said,”Grandpa MA, our company is definitely making money from this auction. We’re making a lot of money. There’s no reason for you to help us when we’re making money! There’s no such logic!”

“The venue and resources are readily available, so it’s not like I’m paying for it!” MA Xiong said,”ruofei, if you continue to fight with me, you’re treating me as an outsider!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He didn’t expect this old man to use words to shut him up.

However, Xia ruofei had his own principles. He would definitely accept MA Xiong’s good intentions.

After some thought, Xia ruofei said,””Grandpa MA, it’s impossible to not charge a single cent. The hotel has even cleared the venue for the auction. There are so many publicity resources, material production, and so on. They all cost money. You can’t pay for all these expenses, right?”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”how about this? since you said that we’re family, I won’t stand on ceremony with you. I don’t want Hengfeng auction house to charge according to the market price, but we will bear the normal operating expenses and the expenses of the auction. Our company is making a lot of money. At least Hengfeng should break even! Otherwise, I’ll definitely feel bad! Grandpa MA, this is my bottom line. If you still don’t accept it, then we can only follow the contract!”

“You!” MA Xiong laughed bitterly. Didn’t you just say that you’re not treating me as an outsider? And now, you’re actually haggling with me for so long just for a few million Yuan ... Fine, fine, fine! We’ll do as you say!”

Xia ruofei said,”you’re not allowed to tamper with the accounts!” I’ve even brought the financial director with me this time, and we’ll calculate every single expense clearly!”

MA Xiong couldn’t help but laugh.”Good! Let’s settle our debts as brothers! The cost will be borne by the Paradise Corporation, but I won’t take a single cent of the extra money!”

“It’s a deal!” Xia ruofei said. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After they were done talking about the fees, MA Xiong said,”Oh right, ruofei, there’s one more thing I need to talk to you about.”

Xia ruofei smiled and stood up.””Grandpa MA, you don’t have to say anything, I’ve already prepared everything for you! Please wait a moment!”

With that, Xia ruofei walked straight to the room where the cold cabinet was. After a while, he came out with a small box.

Xia ruofei placed the box on the coffee table, opened the lid quickly, and said,””Take a look and see if you’re satisfied?”
