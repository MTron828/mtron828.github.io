The RCD Espanyol players completed their pre – Match warm – up against the boos of the home fans. Relatively speaking, the younger players, including new players like Wu Lei, who had experienced the Catalan derby for the first time, were more or less nervous. Their movements were more or less out of shape during passing, shooting, and other training. Wu Lei even fired an anti – aircraft cannon, which caused the fans in the stands to laugh.

Xia ruofei was very calm throughout the whole process. He did not show any signs of nervousness, did not deliberately play tricks, and did not provoke the home fans. To him, this was the most ordinary warm – up before the game, no different from the warm – up before the other games.

Xia ruofei finished his warm – up exercises and walked out of the court with Wu Lei’s shoulder. He covered his mouth with his hand and said to Wu Lei,””Lei Zi, when the match starts, the atmosphere will be ten times more intense than it is now. You can’t let your legs go soft!”

Now, many players were used to covering their mouths and speaking under the camera lens because some television stations would hire lip – reading experts to interpret what the players said on the field. The fans were also very interested in this kind of interpretation.

Although it was impossible for the Spain television station to find a lip – reading expert who knew Chinese, Xia ruofei still followed suit and covered his mouth to speak to Wu Lei.

“I understand, brother Xia!” Wu Lei nodded.

……

There was still about an hour before the start of the game. Night had just fallen in Barcelona, and it was already oneo’ clock in the morning in China, far away in the eastern Hemisphere.

Even though it was already late at night, PP sports ‘live broadcast room was still in full swing. The staff were all busy and nervous, and the live broadcast had already started half an hour ago. All kinds of analysis, comments, and all kinds of short videos prepared in advance were warming up the game.

This time, PP sports ‘live broadcast was still free. Ever since Wu Lei joined the Spanish team, PP sports had set free games whenever there were any games played by the Spanish team. This had helped them regain a lot of reputation among the fans. Previously, some of the major games of the Chinese Super League were set to be charged and could only be watched by purchasing members, which had been criticized by many people.

In addition to the two hosts, the live commentary section was still the match between the “Hall leader and vice Hall leader” Shen fangjian and Jia Tianning, which the fans were very familiar with.

While the Spanish players were warming up before the game, the live broadcast room cut to the live signal in time. The two commentators introduced the situation to the fans who were watching the live broadcast late at night according to the live scene.

“We see Xia ruofei and Wu Lei from China on the court!” Shen fangjian said with some excitement,”according to the starting list we got before the game, Wu Lei and Xia ruofei will be starting together today. This will be the first time that Chinese players will step on nokapu’s turf. Will they score? If there is, it will be a historic goal!”

“Wu Lei’s condition has been good recently,” Jia Tianning said. “Although Xia ruofei only played half the game, we still have full confidence in him. From his performance in that half of the game, anyone who knows a little about football can see that he is very strong, even stronger than many players on the field. So, whether it is Wu Lei or Xia ruofei, they both have a good chance of scoring today!”

“We also hope that they can create history!” Shen fangjian said,”no matter which one of them scores a goal, they will be the first Chinese player to break Barcelona’s goal!”

“Actually, to be able to play against Messi in the same match is already a dream for many players!” Jia Tianning joked. Before Wu Lei joined Espanyol, none of us dared to imagine such a scene, but it is about to happen today! And it’s two Chinese players at the same time!”

“It’s not easy being a Chinese fan ...” Shen fangjian said with emotion. However, he knew that this topic was a bit sensitive. It didn’t matter if he complained in private. After all, it was a live broadcast, so he quickly stopped and didn’t continue.

After some forward – looking analysis, the scene cut back to the field. At this time, the Spanish players were leaving in order to return to the locker room.

Shen fangjian smiled and said,”the camera captured the scene of Xia ruofei and Wu Lei. We saw the two of them whispering to each other. However, Xia ruofei had her hand over her mouth and the recording equipment was not nearby. So, we didn’t know what they were talking about!”

“Xia ruofei must have told Wu Lei personally!” Jia Tianning joked,”maybe they are planning a Blitzkrieg, hoping to give Barcelona a head – on blow?”

A lot of fans had already gathered in the comments area. Although there was still about an hour before the kick – off, everyone could not wait.

After hearing Jia Tianning’s words, the fans also began to discuss in the comments section.

“As expected of the hall Master of Wu Chui Hall! You even dare to say this!”

“These two are obviously from Xia Chui Tang, okay? The way they flattered President Xia in the last competition was really mushy!”

“When facing bar?a, shouldn’t we first stabilize our defense? Every opponent who played against bar?a died miserably!”

“That’s right! When did I become a soft persimmon? Hall leader Jia’s ego is really inflated ...”
