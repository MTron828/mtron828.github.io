Chapter 3677: Chen Nanfeng’s breakthrough (1)

Translator: 549690339

Today was the day Chen Nanfeng had set for his breakthrough, so Chen Xuan was naturally busy and had no time to have breakfast with Xia ruofei.

The courtyards in the reception area had become more and more lively since yesterday. Almost every courtyard was occupied, and some small sects even shared a courtyard with several people.

Xia ruofei’s place had always been very quiet. The first heaven society naturally wouldn’t arrange for anyone else to live in this courtyard. Moreover, the courtyards nearby seemed to be occupied by one person or two people from the same sect. They were relatively powerful sects, so it was much quieter at night.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to use the spirit map’s space in the territory of the first heaven society. He was on guard even when he was cultivating and didn’t put his heart and soul into it.

Today’s breakfast was delivered to each courtyard by the service disciples.

After breakfast, a Deacon disciple of the first heaven society came to Xia ruofei’s courtyard and said respectfully,&quot;&quot;Senior Xia, young sect leader Chen wanted to come in person, but he’s too busy today, so he asked me to pick you up and bring you to the grandstand. At the same time, young sect leader also reminded me again and again to pass on his apology! &quot; ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei chuckled.&quotjYou’re too kind, brother Chen. He must be busy. I can understand that.&quot; Since he had come to the first heaven society, he would definitely do as the host did! How should I address you, Deacon?&quot;

&quot;Senior Xia, this disciple’s name is Zeng Qing. It’s this disciple’s honor to be able to serve senior!&quot; The executing – disciple quickly said.

&quot;So it’s Deacon CEng.&quot; Xia ruofei smiled and said,&quot;Deacon Zeng, where is sect leader Chen going to break through today?&quot; You even built a grandstand?&quot;

Zeng Qing quickly said,&quot;the sect leader’s Grandmaster was scheduled to break through in the back mountain a month ago. It’s completely open to all the disciples of the sect and the invited Daoist friends. Everyone can personally witness the whole process of the sect leader’s breakthrough. Our first heaven society has built a Grandmaster’s observation platform in the back mountain for the guests to observe the breakthrough! &quot; Senior Xia, now many guests have already gone to the grandstand, and the sect leader is also preparing to go. He may break through to the nascent Soul Stage at any time, do you think…. We should go there first?&quot;
