Chapter 1294: Chapter 780 – embarrassing_2

Translator: 549690339

Feng Rao was speechless. Then, she became a little embarrassed and asked,””This ... The bet, can you ...”

“Forget it! You’re not allowed to deny it!” Xia ruofei held it in and rejected her without waiting for Feng Jing to finish her sentence.

“I’m not denying it!” Feng Jing hurriedly said,”I’m saying ... Can you honor it now? don’t let Liu Qian ...”

“Boss Feng, are you embarrassed?” Xia ruofei was overjoyed. He continued to tease,”Liu Qian is a witness to our bet. It’s not good for her to be absent, right?”

“You ...” Feng Rao’s face turned red as she said,”how about ... I double the bet?”

“What do you mean?” Xia ruofei did not understand.

“Call out twice!” Feng Rao said with a red face.

Xia ruofei touched his chin and said after a while,””Three!”

Feng Rao gritted her teeth and said,””Deal!”

Liu Qian was her subordinate. If she had to call Xia ruofei “brother” in front of Liu Qian, she would definitely not accept it. Besides, Xia ruofei’s request was not too much, so she could only grit her teeth and agree. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei crossed his arms in front of his chest and sat on his desk, not caring about his image at all. He had a mischievous smile on his face as he looked at Feng Jing.

Feng Rao’s face reddened as she mustered up her courage and finally said in a mosquito – like voice,””Brother ruofei ...”

Xia ruofei picked his ears exaggeratedly and said,””Boss Feng, what did you just say? I didn’t hear anything!”

Feng Rao was so angry that she glared at Xia ruofei. Then, she closed her eyes and shouted,””Brother ruofei! Brother ruofei! Brother ruofei!”

At this moment, a figure rushed into Xia ruofei’s office and said,””Chairman ...”

This person was Liu Qian. However, she only managed to finish her sentence because she heard Feng Jing loudly calling “brother RUO Fei” three times.

Liu Qian was stunned and stood rooted to the ground, not knowing what to do.

Feng Rao felt like killing herself. She glared at Liu Qian with murderous eyes and asked in an unfriendly tone,””What are you doing here?”

Liu Qian was so scared that she trembled and quickly said,”I ... I didn’t hear anything ... I didn’t see anything ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”President Feng, I didn’t ask Liu Qian to come! Isn’t this ... A coincidence?”

Feng Jing wished there was a hole in the ground for her to crawl into. She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as she said to Liu Qian,””I’m asking you, what are you doing here?”

“Oh ... That ... Bojun real estate called again,” Liu Qian said hurriedly. “They hope to restart the negotiations as soon as possible! I ... I couldn’t find you in your office, so I ...”

“Alright, I got it!” Feng Rao quickly said,”you can leave first!”

“Oh! Alright!” As if she had been pardoned, Liu Qian turned around and quickly walked out. On one hand, she was a little frightened, but on the other hand, she felt that the scene just now was a little funny. If she stayed any longer, she was afraid that she would not be able to hold it in.

“Wait!” Xia ruofei said,”Liu Qian, I think you also participated in the gambling event the day before yesterday, right? So ...”

Liu Qian slowly turned around and glanced at Feng Jing. Without hesitation, she shouted,””Brother ruofei!”

“Swish!” Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,”President Feng, look at how good Liu Qian’s gambling ethics are. You have to learn more from him in this aspect ...”

Feng Rao covered her face with one hand and said weakly,””Chairman, let’s talk about bojun real estate first ...”

He didn’t care about a business that was worth hundreds of millions, but he became a brother. This boss was too unreliable.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Okay, okay, okay!” I’ll let go of the bet, but I won’t let you call me brother for nothing! After the matter with bojun real estate is settled, I’ll still treat you to Ling Ji’s private kitchen! And there’s definitely a secret Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup!”

Liu Qian’s eyes immediately lit up when she heard this and said,”Really? Long live the chairman!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”Liu Qian, you can leave first!” Right, tell bojun real estate that we’re busy with work and I’m afraid we don’t have the time to rush to the city to negotiate, but if they come to the farm, I’ll try my best to find time to talk to them!”

Liu Qian was stunned for a moment, and then immediately said,”Alright, I’ll make the call now!”

After Liu Qian left, Feng Rao felt her face burning. She was so embarrassed just now.

She could not help but glare at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, I’ve lost all my face this time ... It’s all your fault! It won’t be long before everyone in the company knows ...”

“Come on!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t you know Liu Qian? Don’t look at how this little girl is in a rush, she’s tight – lipped!”

After being Feng Jing’s assistant for so long and not being replaced, Liu Qian wasn’t the type to blabber. This was the biggest taboo for people around the higher – ups.

“It’s all your fault anyway!”Feng Rao snapped.

“This is a little unreasonable!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I was the one who suggested the bet, but I didn’t force you to participate ...”

Then, Xia ruofei continued,”Alright, alright. I won’t let you suffer any losses. How about this?” In the future, you can call me by my name in private, and I’ll ... Call you sister ran. This way, we won’t seem too distant!”
