2490 Sneaking back to the sect (1)

If anyone had ulterior motives, they would not be able to escape Xia ruofei’s hypnosis.

During the interview, Xia ruofei had found three problematic people. One of them was eliminated on the first question after the hypnosis. He admitted that his Ph.D. Was fake and that his master’s thesis had academic misconduct.

This was a matter of character, so Xia ruofei naturally put him on the elimination list without thinking.

As for the other two people, they made Xia ruofei even angrier.

The two of them had genuine academic qualifications, but they had proposed to stay and work because they knew that Qiantang would also produce Yushi cream and heart – nourishing soup in the future. They had the idea of stealing the formulas of these two products.

Except for these three people, the other 23 people did not have any major problems. Most of them did stay because of the Jushi cream and Yangxin soup. However, they stayed because of the fame and wanted to make a business here, so they had no covetous thoughts.

So, as long as the 23 people’s abilities met the requirements, Xia ruofei would naturally welcome them to stay and work.

Although there was one student who faked his academic qualifications and two who tried to steal the formula, Xia ruofei was still a little annoyed. However, Xia ruofei was satisfied that the Liu family did not send anyone to “hide”.

This was actually the main reason why Xia ruofei personally went to screen the 26 people. If the Liu family really had a hidden hand, they would not be able to escape Xia ruofei’s inspection. By then, Xia ruofei would really not be polite to the Liu family.

Now it seemed that the Liu family had given up on the idea of dealing with Xia ruofei. At least, they did not dare to have any evil thoughts about handing over the pharmaceutical Group. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei, Qin Yanan, and he Yu flew back to Sanshan from Qiantang.

For the next few days, Xia ruofei stayed in San Shan to deal with the company’s Affairs. He even made a special trip back to Tao Yuan farm to add some spirit Heart Flower petal solution to the farm and the water tower of the pomfrets cultivation workshop. He also went to the farm’s expansion and pharmaceutical factory’s construction site to inspect.

At the same time, Xia ruofei had also handed over a batch of Drunken Eight Immortals wine to the winery.

These few days, Xia ruofei had been very fulfilling. It was rare for him to go to work for a few days in a row. He dealt with some documents that needed the Chairman’s signature and even took time to visit Hu Zi’s mother. He brought a lot of nutrition for his godmother and even left a bottle of diluted spiritual heart Flower petal solution. He also added a certain amount of medicinal wine in it to remind Hu Zi’s mother of her serious uremia. Although she had recovered and her body was stronger, Xia ruofei did not forget that Hu Zi’s mother had been poisoned. However, Xia ruofei still hoped that she would be in better health.

Xia ruofei specifically told Hu ‘Zi’s mother to keep this bottle of’ medicinal wine ‘in the refrigerator. If she felt a headache, fever, or pain in her back and legs, she could take it out and drink a sip or two.

After having dinner with Hu Zi’s mother, Xia ruofei returned to his house by the river.

In the afternoon, Xia ruofei drove away from the villa area alone. However, he did not go to the office. Instead, he drove directly to a relatively remote section of the road near jiangbin Park. After making sure that there were no surveillance cameras around and no one was spying on him, he used his mind and a person suddenly appeared in the front passenger seat.

This man was the first soul slave that Xia ruofei had ever taken in. He was a true – Blue cultivator, Liu chengfeng.

Liu chengfeng, who had reappeared in the outside world, was circulating his energy. He had broken through to the eighth level of the Qi refining realm, and his cultivation was very stable. It was obvious that he had been cultivating for a long time after the breakthrough.

As soon as Liu chengfeng appeared, he quickly turned to the side and knelt down in front of Xia ruofei. Fortunately, the front row of the Knight XV was very spacious. Otherwise, he would not have had a place to kneel.

Liu chengfeng’s face was full of gratitude as he said,””Thank you, master, for teaching me!”

“Get up!” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”chengfeng, now that you have broken through to refined Qi level 8, more than ten days have passed in the outside world. It’s time for you to return to the sect.”

“Yes! This subordinate will do as you command!” Liu chengfeng said respectfully and then got up to return to his seat. However, he only sat on half of his butt and kept his side facing Xia ruofei. He was very respectful.

Because of the soul seal, Liu chengfeng’s obedience and worship to Xia ruofei came from the bottom of his heart. Besides, after cultivating for so long in the spirit map space, he felt that his cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds. The endless supply of spiritual Qi was almost unlimited. Since he had started cultivating, he had never been able to cultivate to such an extent.

Hence, Liu chengfeng was even more grateful to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei instructed,”after you return to the sect, you don’t have to collect information. Just note down the valuable information that you can come into contact with. I don’t need you to risk your life for me. Safety should be the most important.”

“Yes, master!” Liu chengfeng said gratefully.

Even if Xia ruofei asked Liu chengfeng to die now, he would not hesitate to do it because of the soul seal. However, he was still very touched that Xia ruofei put his safety first.

“When you return, if someone asks you about your breakthrough, do you know what to say?” Xia ruofei asked.
