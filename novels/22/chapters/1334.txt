Chapter 1335: The older the ginger, the spicier it is (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Swish!” Xia ruofei almost jumped in shock.”Aren’t you guys too greedy? The farm probably produces less than 2000 catties of pomfrets a month!”

Each batch of baby fishes was about a thousand. Although Tao Yuan farm’s pomfrets were larger than normal, reaching about two catties on average, there were still some that were less than two catties. Even if all kinds of measures were taken to the extreme, losses were inevitable during the breeding process, so the monthly output was about two thousand catties.

Xia ruofei continued,”moreover ... This is a high – end ingredient. It doesn’t match your user profile, right?”

Ling Qingxue retorted,”who said that we can only be in the middle to low consumer group?” Don’t you know how popular the private kitchen is?”

Xia ruofei facepalmed. He had not thought about the private restaurant.

As far as he knew, Ling’s F & B group had branches all over the province. These branches were for ordinary consumers, but the money – making ability after being conglomerated was quite amazing.

If it was a private restaurant, it would definitely be a high – end place for consumption. The design of the dishes was very exquisite, and of course, the price was quite touching. Putting everything else aside, the signature ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ dish that Xia ruofei had provided with the secret recipe was definitely not something that ordinary working class people could afford.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”The problem is, there’s only one private restaurant. Do you think it’s worth 300 catties of fish?”

“Why can’t it be used up?” Ling Qingxue said,” 300 catties is only about 150 fish. That’s an average of only five per day. If you ask me, I’d say that it won’t be enough to sell in the end!”

“That’s a few thousand or even tens of thousands of Yuan! Five fish a day?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be a little speechless. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“There are a lot of rich people these days,” Ling Qingxue said.”And with the help of your ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, many gluttons have come to our restaurant to spend money. Many of these people don’t care about money at all. As long as they can eat delicious food, they don’t care how much money they spend ...”

“It seems like I’ve underestimated the spending power of the people of the three mountains ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. After a moment of silence, he said,”sure! Since his father – in – Law had spoken, he had to agree even if there were difficulties! Three hundred catties a month, huh? I guarantee that I’ll be the first to supply!”

“That’s the way!” Ling Qingxue smiled.”You’re quite enlightened!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”If I don’t have a high level of awareness, what if I’m single for the rest of my life? wouldn’t I be in trouble then?”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t stop laughing.

Xia ruofei continued,”Oh right, Qingxue, is uncle Ling free?” I have some questions about the sales of pomfrets that I want to ask him ...”

“He went home for an afternoon nap.” Ling Qingxue complained out of habit,”he doesn’t care about the company’s Affairs as much as he can now. He often leaves them to me ...”

“Don’t be too tired!” Xia ruofei said with heartache,”if we really can’t do it, I’ll talk to uncle Ling!”

In reality, with Xia ruofei’s ability to earn money, there was no need for Ling Qingxue to work so hard. However, Ling Qingxue was not only his girlfriend, but also the only daughter of Ling Xiaotian. She would inherit the family business in the future.

Besides, Xia ruofei knew that Ling Qingxue did not want to be idle all day. She had her own career. She had been exposed to the gastronomic industry since she was young. Furthermore, it had been passed down from her father. It was a matter of great accomplishment for her to be able to bring it to greater heights.

Ling Qingxue was an independent person and not Xia ruofei’s subordinate.

“No need,” Ling Qingxue said.”I’m actually not that tired. I just don’t have much time to spend with you ...”

“After we’re done with this, we’ll find some time to go on a vacation abroad!” Xia ruofei said,”I have a big farm in Australia and two wineries. We can stay there for a while!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue felt a sweetness in her heart.”Then you should tell me in advance so that I can arrange the work at hand!” She said.

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue, I’ll call uncle Ling later!” You should rest in the office for a while!”

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue said happily.

Xia ruofei’s suggestion to go on a vacation abroad had lifted her mood and filled her with anticipation.

After chatting with Ling Qingxue for a while more, Xia ruofei hung up the phone and went back to his bedroom to rest.

When he woke up, it was already around three in the afternoon.

Xia ruofei estimated that Ling Xiaotian should not be taking a nap at this time, so he simply washed his face and picked up his phone to call Ling Xiaotian.

“RUO Fei!” Ling Xiaotian said straightforwardly,”Qingxue said you were looking for me?”

“Uncle Ling, I’d like to ask you about the sales of pomfrets.” Xia ruofei said respectfully.

This was his future father – in – Law, and he couldn’t be neglected.

“Hmm ... That Chinese perch is really good! Su Yu’s evaluation is very high!” Ling Xiaotian seemed to still be reminiscing about the deliciousness of the pomfrets. He paused for a moment before saying,”Oh right, our Ling Ji private kitchen is selling 300 catties of it every month! Did Qingxue tell you?”

“I said it, I said it.” Xia ruofei quickly replied,” 300 catties is no problem. We will definitely prioritize the supply!”

“Hahaha! I knew you wouldn’t refuse!” Ling Xiaotian said happily,”that’s right, you were talking about the sales of pomfrets. Is there a problem?”

Xia ruofei said,”there are two main aspects. The first is the price. Since authentic Chinese perch is very rare, there is no standard for reference.”
