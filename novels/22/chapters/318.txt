Xia ruofei did not answer manager Lu directly. Instead, he snuffed out the cigarette and threw it into the trash can in the corridor. Then, he asked,””Manager Lu, is old Mr. Li’s examination report here? I’d like to take a look. ” “They’re with the medical team!” Manager Lu quickly said,”I’ll get them to send it over immediately!” Manager Lu found an empty room for Xia ruofei before calling the medical team to send li Zhifu’s examination report over. Soon, a doctor from the medical team came into the room with a document bag and said,””Manager Lu, you want the information.” “You’ve worked hard! “Thank you ...” Manager Lu took it with a smile. The doctor politely bade him farewell and left. Manager Lu handed the file to Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei took out the medical report and read it carefully. Manager Lu sat quietly at the side, feeling a little nervous. He was afraid that Xia ruofei would suddenly say that he could not do anything. Manager Lu was the one who coordinated li Zhifu’s treatment. He was also there during the expert consultation. He knew that if Xia ruofei couldn’t do anything, li Zhifu would have to undergo a resection. However, according to the experts, the success rate of the surgery was quite low. Xia ruofei read the medical record very slowly, especially the expert consultation opinion and biopsy report. He read it word by word. Of course, Xia ruofei was not just pretending. He wanted to know how serious li Zhifu’s condition was through Western Medicine’s examination report so that he could control the pace of the whole treatment. He wasn’t worried that he wouldn’t be able to cure li Zhifu. He was worried that if he didn’t control the rhythm well and let li Zhifu recover too quickly, it would easily arouse suspicion. In manager Lu’s eyes, Xia ruofei was naturally thinking hard about a treatment method, so he had been very quiet. Even his breathing was suppressed, for fear of disturbing Xia ruofei. It was only when Xia ruofei gently put down the examination report and looked up that manager Lu asked anxiously,””Little Xia, how is it? Is there any way?” “Manager Lu, if Western medicine doesn’t have a good treatment plan, I can try.” Xia ruofei said,”but ... My personal suggestion is that if Western medicine is more confident, it’s best to treat it with Western medicine. After all, I can only say that I’ll try it out. I can’t guarantee anything.” To be honest, Xia ruofei didn’t want to treat people’s terminal illnesses too often. However, elder song had asked him for help this time, so he couldn’t refuse. However, he still hoped to stay out of it. If Western medicine could work, he wouldn’t have to do anything. “I understand ... The current situation is that the medical experts in the province are somewhat helpless.” Manager Lu said,”it’s precisely because they have no confidence that the chief asked you for help.” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I understand.” Manager Lu, I’ll think about the prescription. ” “Thank you so much, Xia!” Manager Lu was overjoyed. “Xiao Xia,” manager Lu said hurriedly,”you can rest in this room for a while and think about the treatment plan. I won’t disturb you any longer.” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After manager Lu left, Xia ruofei took out his phone and searched for Chinese medicine prescriptions for colon cancer. The internet was very advanced nowadays. Xia ruofei found many prescriptions very quickly. Ever since he had absorbed the petals of many strange flowers, not only had his physical fitness improved rapidly, but his memory had also been greatly strengthened. In addition, these prescriptions were not too complicated, so he could basically remember them after reading them twice. Xia ruofei compared the information he had found through different online channels, hoping to find two or three more mature and reliable prescriptions. Although Xia ruofei’s treatment of his illness was mainly based on the effects of the petals of the strange flower, the best prescription was to treat the right symptoms. At least, it should not have any adverse effects. Just as Xia ruofei had settled on the prescription, he heard a knock on the door. “Please enter!” Xia ruofei said loudly. The door was pushed open. Xia ruofei looked up and saw elder song and manager Lu walking in. He quickly put away his phone and stood up to welcome them. “Chief, why did you come here personally? If there’s anything you need, just ask manager Lu to call me. ” Xia ruofei said. Elder song waved his hand.”There’s no need to mind these formalities ... Xiao Xia, I’ve heard everything from Xiao Lu. Thank you!” “You’re welcome, chief,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I will do my best.” “You don’t need to feel any pressure. No one will blame you no matter if the treatment is effective or not,” said eccentric song with a nod. “Xiao Xia, what’s your decision on the treatment plan?” elder song asked. “The prescription is basically fixed for now, but whether it will be effective or not depends on the situation after taking the medicine.” Xia ruofei said cautiously. “En!” Elder song nodded and said,”if you need anything, just tell Xiao Lu. We will do our best to cooperate and ensure it.” “For now, I just need to prepare the medicinal herbs I need. I’ll write a list for manager Lu.” Xia ruofei said,”also ... This treatment will take a long time. I hope that old Mr. Li can live in my farm. This way, I can observe his condition at any time and adjust the treatment plan in time. Also, old Mr. Li can change his environment.” Another reason was that Xia ruofei was afraid of trouble. He had to prepare Chinese medicine every day in the early stages. He had a lot of things to do at the farm, so it was not realistic for him to come to guling courtyard every day. Of course, Xia ruofei would not say this. “Sure,” elder song said after a moment of silence.”I’ll find a reason to persuade brother Fu to live at your farm for a while.” Xia ruofei said,”that’s great!” Chief, I’ll prepare a few doses of Chinese medicine today. You’d better convince old Mr. Li to live in my farm in a day or two and continue the treatment for a month! If the effect is good, we’ll continue the treatment according to my plan. If the intervention of Chinese medicine can’t achieve the desired effect, then I suggest surgery combined with chemotherapy. ” “Sure!” Elder song said,”it’s settled then!” Hence, Xia ruofei gave manager Lu a list. There was a Chinese medicine room in the Gu Ling courtyard and the medicinal herbs stored inside were quite complete. Very quickly, manager Lu prepared the medicinal herbs according to the requirements. Xia ruofei locked the door and windows and personally brewed the Chinese medicine. He also took out the diluted flower petal solution from the spirit map space and mixed it into the medicinal soup. Then, he kept the amount for the first time and divided the rest into three portions. He put them in sealed medicine bags and asked manager Lu to keep them in the refrigerator. Then, Xia ruofei bade farewell and left the Gu Ling courtyard.
