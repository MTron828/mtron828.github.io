2060 Not welcomed (3)

If it were not for the inexplicable hostility, Rousey would have been a very curious young man. Now that he had already nodded in agreement, he simply did not dwell on those things and began to develop an interest in the treatment methods of Chinese medicine.

He stretched out his hand and placed it on the table. Xia ruofei moved a stool over and sat down opposite Luo Si. He reached out and felt Luo SI’s pulse.

After learning a few Chinese medicine books from the Jade talisman of inheritance, Xia ruofei could easily solve most problems with his own medical skills even if he did not use the petals of the spirit Heart Flower.

Therefore, he was not bluffing when he took Rousey’s pulse. He was really using Traditional Chinese Medicine methods to check Rousey’s pulse. Of course, he also used a little bit of mental strength to ensure the accuracy of the examination.

Xia ruofei closed his eyes and checked carefully. After a while, he asked Luo Si to use another hand to check on the man on the left and the woman on the right. In Chinese medicine, there was no such thing as this. A real Chinese medicine doctor would have to check the pulse with both hands.

The results of the examination were similar to Xia ruofei’s previous deduction. The meridians in Rossi’s leg were severely blocked, and it was difficult for his qi and blood to circulate below his calf. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“How’s the situation?” Monica could not help but ask.

“Rousey’s condition is relatively serious,”Xia ruofei said.

“Of course,” Rousey said, a little disappointed.”I’ve seen countless doctors and done countless tests over the years, and they all gave me the same answer. This is almost the most serious sequelae of polio. It’s very difficult to recover the feeling in the legs by medical means.”

“It doesn’t matter. We will think of a way in the future ...” Monica said.

Xia ruofei laughed.”I only said that the situation is serious. I didn’t say that it can’t be cured!”

“Xia, you really have a way?” Monica suddenly became alert.

She knew that Xia ruofei would not lie just to make her happy. As long as Xia ruofei said that he could cure Rousey, Monica would believe him without any hesitation.

In comparison, Rossi was much more rational. Or rather, he had not been optimistic about Xia ruofei from the beginning, so he was not too disappointed.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”although it’ll be tricky, it’s not like there’s no other way ... How about this?” We’ll use acupuncture and physical therapy today, and I’ll make a few more doses of medicine tomorrow. The effect should be more obvious. ”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at Monica and said,””Get someone to bring my luggage over!”

“Alright!” Monica quickly responded and quickly walked out of Rousey’s room.

Xia ruofei said to Rousey,”let me help you to the bed!” You’ll need to lie down for the acupuncture later ...”

“Mr. Xia, can you really help my leg recover?” Rousey asked, half – believing and half – doubting.

He didn’t dare to hope for a complete recovery. If he could even walk a few steps after treatment, it would be a huge surprise for him.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Rossi, if I’m not wrong, you can’t feel anything below your knee, right?”

“Yes!” Rosey nodded.

“Then, I can tell you ...” Xia ruofei said,”after today’s acupuncture and massage treatment, your leg will regain some feeling. This should be considered effective, right?”
