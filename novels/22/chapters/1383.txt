Gulangyu.

After dinner, Lin Qiao took Xia ruofei to the beach. Although they couldn’t play in the water in the winter and the wind was quite strong at night, Lin Qiao was still in high spirits. She even borrowed beach toys from the front desk of the hotel and built a Castle on the beach like a child. Her hands were covered in sand.

After Xia ruofei saw it, he was helpless and could only go crazy with her.

On Gulangyu’s Beach, one could see the other shore a few hundred meters away. The lights of the entire Heron Island and the ships on the sea formed a beautiful night scene.

He could still hear the sound of the waves and Lin Qiao’s laughter. It would be perfect if he didn’t consider the cold sea breeze.

However, the wind by the sea was so strong that Xia ruofei was worried that Lin Qiao would catch a cold. Since she was having so much fun, he could only take off his coat and put it on Lin Qiao.

At eighto’ clock in the evening, Lin Qiao was pulled back to the hotel by Xia ruofei reluctantly.

Xia ruofei pushed Lin Qiao into her room and asked her to wash the sand off her hands. He then went to Zhao Yongjun’s room and found song Rui, Liu Jian, and Xu Zixuan playing cards. Zhao Yongjun took Hou Liang and Wei Jun out for a walk.

There were quite a few bars on Gulangyu, so Zhao Yongjun and the others went to find a place to drink and chat.

Xia ruofei had no interest in playing cards. He returned to his room after watching for a while.

Lin Qiao went to Xia ruofei’s room and stayed there for a long time. When it was past 10 pm, Xia ruofei persuaded her to go back to her room to rest since she still had class tomorrow. Then, Xia ruofei went to take a shower.

After changing his clothes, Xia ruofei took out his laptop from the spirit map space and went online to listen to music to kill time. Then, he started to cultivate at midnight. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The environment of this small island was better than that of Taoyuan farm. Perhaps it was because of the spiritual energy from the sea, Xia ruofei felt that his cultivation speed was a little faster than usual.

It was not until midnight that Xia ruofei let out a breath of turbid air. He stopped and stood up, feeling comfortable all over.

Xia ruofei slept until five in the morning, which was the beginning of dawn. Then, he started to cultivate as usual until seven.

If he were to cultivate normally, Xia ruofei would sleep less than five hours a night. According to the scientific theory, this sleep was definitely not enough.

However, Xia ruofei was still in high spirits every day. On one hand, it was because he had cultivated the “great Dao Sutra”. Even if he did not sleep for a few days, he would not feel unbearable fatigue. On the other hand, the five hours of sleep he had was the real deep sleep after cultivation. In terms of the effect of rest, it was much better than an ordinary person’s eight hours of sleep. Therefore, he did not have the problem of insufficient sleep.

After finishing his morning cultivation, Xia ruofei tidied up the bed, put on his coat, and walked out of the room. He knocked on Lin Qiao’s door and woke her up. She had to go back to school in the morning, so she had to eat early.

However, Lin Qiao’s class was in the third or fourth period in the morning, so she had more time.

Young girls always took a long time to wash up and put on makeup. Even if Lin Qiao didn’t put on makeup, she still took her time to come to the hotel restaurant at 7:30.

After breakfast, Xia ruofei said,””Big brother Zhao, I’ll send Qiao’ er back to school in the morning. You guys can do whatever you want. Anyway, this is a relaxing trip ...”

Lin Qiao quickly said,”brother ruofei, you don’t have to send me off!” It’s not the first time I’ve been to Gulangyu. I’ll take the ferry to the other side and then take the bus back!”

“That was when I wasn’t on Egret Island in the past!” Xia ruofei said,”since I’m with you, how can I let you go back alone?” Besides, there’s still a big bag of clothes in my car! It’s decided!”

Lin Qiao’s heart felt warm and she said sweetly,”Alright then! Thank you, brother ruofei!”

Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”I think we should all go to Egret Island together!” We went to Heron Island University yesterday, there are still many places to play in Heron Island City! Let’s split up at the opposite dock and go wherever we want. RUO Fei will send sister Lin Qiao back to school. Then, we’ll set a time to meet at the dock. How about we return to Gulangyu for the night? Right, I’ll have to trouble little Zhang to help us coordinate the transmigration!”

“No problem!” Xiao Zhang quickly replied. By the way, I’ll coordinate two more cars for you to use on Heron Island!”

Zhao Yongjun smiled and waved his hand.”We don’t need a car. We have a business car, but we don’t plan on using it. Since it’s a leisure trip, we’ll go wherever we go!” We don’t plan to act as a group!”

“Alright, I’ll follow your arrangements!” Xiao Zhang said.

No one had any objections to Zhao Yongjun’s suggestion. They would go to Egret Island to play by themselves, and they didn’t need to be accompanied. They just had to coordinate the ferry back to Gulangyu in the evening. Xiao Zhang could also take a break for the day. Naturally, everyone was happy.

After breakfast, everyone took the hotel’s electric car to the dock.

They were going directly to Heron Island City, so there was no need to take a speedboat. It would only take five or six minutes to get there by boat.

Xiao Zhang coordinated the nearest ferry and sent everyone on the boat.

A few minutes later, everyone was at the pier on this side of the island. Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,””Brothers, let’s split up here! We’ll meet here at 4:30 p.m. Sharp. We won’t be waiting if we don’t meet after that!”
