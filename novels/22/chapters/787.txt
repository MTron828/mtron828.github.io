Chapter 788: Sharpening the knife (1)

Guo Zhan’s eyes brightened and he couldn’t help but want to clap the table and exclaim, happily saying,”Blood Wolf, this is a good idea! Hehe ... You’re full of ideas!”

Guo Zhan had been racking his brains over the past two days regarding the future of Lin Yue ‘E’s family. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After squad leader old Luo’s death, he was immediately recognized as a revolutionary martyr. He would receive a one – time pension and funeral expenses. As a martyr’s family, Lin Yue ‘e would also receive a certain amount of allowance every month. In addition, in the case of squad leader old Luo, the organization would take into account the difficulties of the martyr’s family. If they did not have a job, they would usually solve their job problems.

However, these were far from enough. The state had policies regarding the pension and preferential treatment for martyrs. It was impossible to give compensation beyond the stipulated scope just because old Luo made great contributions.

Guo Zhan and his comrades had wanted to provide financial assistance to Lin Yue ‘E’s family, such as supporting Nan Nan until she went to college. However, Lin Yue’ e was a stubborn person. She was not even willing to accept the job that was offered by the organization, so it was naturally impossible for her to agree to such financial assistance.

However, after Guo Zhan’s excitement, he immediately frowned and said,”Blood Wolf, sister – in – Law doesn’t even want to accept the job arranged by the organization. Will she agree to work in your company?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”why not?” If you don’t accept the arranged work, it means that you don’t want to cause trouble for the organization. But if you work in my company, you’ll earn a living with your own abilities. Isn’t it only right and proper for you to work hard and get paid?”

“That’s true, but sister – in – Law ...” Guo Zhan had some uncertainty.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I’ll tell sister – in – Law!” As you said, I’ve also contributed to old Luo’s situation, so she should be able to listen to my words. ”

With that, Xia ruofei turned around and walked out of the door.

Guo Zhan quickly pulled him back and said,”Ruofei, I’ve thought about it. You shouldn’t go look for sister – in – Law for now. “She’s going back to Ganjiang in two days. There’s still a burial ceremony for the deceased. After she’s done with these things, there’s still the issue of the two elders. This matter can’t be kept a secret for too long. When the media in Ganjiang reports about it, the elders will definitely find out, so ... Why don’t you wait for a while? after sister-in-law’s family has settled everything, you can go to Ganjiang yourself. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”that works too!” “Captain, I think the difficulty of this matter lies in the two elders ... After all, my company is in the southeast province. If sister – in – Law and Nan Nan move to San Shan, I will definitely be able to settle them properly, but the elders might not be willing to move to the southeast province! After all, it was difficult to leave one’s homeland! Besides, class monitor Luo is buried in his hometown, so they’ll definitely be more willing to be closer to their son. ”

Guo Zhan nodded and said,”this is also a problem ... If you can ‘t, you can go and persuade our sister – in – Law to accept the job arranged by the organization. At the very least, she should be arranged to work in a state – owned enterprise. If it’s better, she might even be able to solve the problem of being a career editor!”

......

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”Wolf King, let’s wait!” As you said, sister – in – Law has to deal with squad leader Luo’s funeral. Even if the organization arranged work, it wouldn’t be so fast. I’ll think about it when I get back and see if there’s any way to get the best of both worlds. ”

“Alright!” Guo Zhan nodded and said,”then you should go and say goodbye to sister – in – Law and Nan Nan! Let’s not mention this for now ...”

“I know!”

Xia ruofei carried his bag and walked out of the living quarters. He placed his bag in the cheetah off – Road vehicle that was sending him to the nearest train station. Then, he walked to the small hall of the lone wolf assault team and said goodbye to Lin Yue ‘e and Nan Nan, who were there to mourn for old Luo.

Xia ruofei didn’t mention anything about work. He only said some comforting words before bidding them farewell and leaving the small hall.

Xia ruofei was stunned when he walked out of the auditorium.

All the soldiers of the lone wolf assault team were neatly divided into two phalanxes in front of the small auditorium, with a path in the middle. At the end of this path was the cheetah off – Road vehicle that Guo Zhan had transferred from the barracks.

Looking at the familiar faces, Xia ruofei was a little moved. Guo Zhan smiled and said,””Blood Wolf, it’s time to go! If we don’t leave now, we’ll miss the bus ...”

Xia ruofei bit his lips and nodded. He walked towards the cheetah SUV.

Guo Zhan gently raised his hand and the soldiers immediately burst into thunderous applause. As Xia ruofei walked past them, the soldiers ‘applause did not stop. When Xia ruofei passed by them, they would turn slightly and look in his direction.

Xia ruofei hoped that they could continue on like this, but the road was only a dozen meters long. Very soon, he arrived at the side of the cheetah SUV.

Just as Xia ruofei reached out to grab the door handle, Guo Zhan, who was behind him, loudly ordered,””Salute!”

Xia ruofei’s movements stopped, and his body stiffened. He slowly turned around and saw that all the soldiers were facing him. One to two hundred eyes were on him, and the soldiers saluted him in unison.

At that moment, Xia ruofei felt as if his entire body was being electrocuted. It was as if every pore on his body was trembling.

This was the highest praise a warrior could receive.

His lips trembled slightly, and his eyes turned red.

Xia ruofei bit his lower lip tightly, trying to hold back his tears. The lone wolf assault team members were all men. They bled and sweated but did not shed tears. It was too embarrassing to cry.
