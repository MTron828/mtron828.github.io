Chapter 1478: Everyone is dumbfounded (2)

Translator: 549690339

“I can’t ask for more!” Cao Jin quickly said.

He had indeed come to visit Xia ruofei because he could see how much song Zhengping valued Xia ruofei. In the afternoon, song Zhengping had even specifically instructed that if Xia ruofei contacted him, he had to do his best to satisfy any needs.

Therefore, after accompanying song Zhengping to a meeting and sending him home, Cao Jin hurriedly had dinner and rushed to the hotel.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei had taken song Zhengping’s car back to the hotel at noon, so Cao Jin did not need to ask at all. He only needed to ask song Zhengping’s driver.

At this moment, Xia ruofei seemed to have suddenly recalled something and said,””Oh, Secretary Cao, I’d like to introduce you to two friends!”

“This is Shu Yuan Yuan, she’s song Wei’s University classmate. This is her husband, Zhuang Yan,” Xia ruofei said,”these two are working at Tanzhou city’s cultural relics Bureau.”

“Zhuang Yan, Xu Yuanyuan, this is Cao Jin. He works in the general office of the Provincial Party Committee!” Xia ruofei continued.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s expression, Song Wei could not help but laugh.

They had just discussed to ask Cao Jin to help ask about Xu Yuanyuan, but Xia ruofei seemed to have just remembered it.

Cao Jin didn’t put on any airs. He smiled and said,””Hello!”

“H – Hello, Secretary Cao!” Yuan Yuan said.

She didn’t know Cao Jin’s position, so she could only follow Xia ruofei’s way of addressing him after a moment of hesitation.

Cao Jin was not displeased at all. He gently shook hands with them and said,””We are both working in tan Zhou. If the two of you need any help in the future, you can give me a call!”

Of course, Cao Jin understood why Xia ruofei had introduced these two people, so he expressed his attitude on the spot very readily.

Zhuang Cheng and Yao na were so envious that they were about to go crazy. Xu Yuanyuan obviously didn’t realize how precious Cao Jin’s statement was, and thought it was just a casual remark.

Therefore, Xu Yuanyuan was not very excited. She just said politely,””Thank you, Secretary Cao!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Secretary Cao, Speaking of which, Yuanyuan has a small matter that she might need your help with.”

“Oh? Please speak!” Cao Jin said without hesitation,”I will do my best!”

Cao Jin couldn’t wait for an opportunity to help. His predecessor had served song Zhengping for many years. After song Zhengping was promoted from the position of provincial governor, his predecessor was also smoothly demoted. He was directly promoted to the Standing Committee of a Prefecture – Level city, and Cao Jin also had the opportunity to take over the baton.

However, Cao Jin had not been with song Zhengping for a long time. He was always on thin ice at work, afraid that the chief would be dissatisfied.

If he could ensure that Xia ruofei’s service was good, it would undoubtedly be a huge bonus.

Xu Yuanyuan came back to her senses. Could it be that Secretary Cao could help her with her postgraduate entrance examination? Isn’t he from the Provincial Party Committee? Moreover, he was only a Secretary. How could he manage the Tanzhou cultural relics Bureau?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s like this. Yuanyuan is a top student who graduated from Beijing University. Now, she hopes to take the postgraduate entrance examination and further her studies while retaining her permanent position. However, the duration of her working experience may not meet the requirements submitted by the unit, so the card ...”

At this moment, a hurried voice interrupted Xia ruofei’s words.””Mr. Xia, there won’t be any problems with comrade Xu Yuanyuan’s postgraduate entrance examination! I’ll immediately go and coordinate the implementation!”

It was bureau chief Wang who spoke.

He and chief Jiang had been listening for a long time. Seeing that Xia ruofei had indeed brought up this matter to Cao Jin, he was afraid that Xia ruofei would also say that he had accepted the banquet but did not do anything, so he hurriedly took the initiative to express his position.

Cao Jin was listening attentively to Xia ruofei’s words. He did not expect that someone would come out of nowhere and interrupt him. He was a little unhappy.

However, he did not know Xia ruofei’s relationship with this person, so he did not show it. He only asked indifferently,””And you are?”

“Hello, chief Cao!” Chief Wang quickly said. I’m Wang yaokun, the Deputy Director of the Tanzhou city cultural Bureau ...”

“Oh, it’s bureau chief Wang ...” Cao Jin said lightly.

It sounded like one was the Deputy bureau chief, and the other was the Secretary. There seemed to be a big difference in status, but in fact, it was the opposite. Cao Jin, the Secretary, was a real Deputy bureau chief, while Wang yaokun was only a Deputy bureau chief in the city’s Qingshui Yamen. Therefore, Cao Jin naturally did not need to be too enthusiastic.

“Chief Wang,” Xia ruofei said,”don’t you know that it’s rude to interrupt someone?”

Wang yaokun suddenly looked embarrassed, and Cao Jin seemed to have noticed a subtle change, his eyes began to become cold.

The Cultural Affairs Bureau was the management unit of the cultural relics Bureau. As a member of the leadership team of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, Wang yaokun could easily take care of Xu Yuanyuan’s postgraduate entrance examination. However, Wang yaokun’s sudden appearance at this time gave Cao Jin some different information.

“Mr. Xia, I was wrong,” Wang yaokun said in a panic.”I shouldn’t have interrupted you. But I just want to solve Xu Yuanyuan’s problem as soon as possible ...”

Xia ruofei was still the same Xia ruofei from before. His tone was also as impolite as before, but in Wang yaokun’s eyes, it was completely different.

The tone of the “country boy” from before would only make Wang yaokun think that this person was arrogant. This “Mr. Xia”, who even director Cao had to treat with respect, was the most reasonable person to speak like this. It would be abnormal if he was polite to everyone and didn’t have a temper.

“Chief Wang didn’t say that just now, did he?” Xia ruofei said,”I remember you saying that this is not an easy task. It’s against the rules and it might even cause chaos in the unit ...”

Beads of sweat appeared on Wang yaokun’s forehead. He had just put on airs with Yuanyuan Xu and said all those words to Xia ruofei. And it was in front of Cao Jin.

Cao Jin had been in the system for so many years and had been polished and trained by the major agencies. How could he not guess what had happened when he heard this?

He glanced at Wang yaokun and said,””If that’s the case, then we don’t have to trouble director Wang with this matter. I’ll call Zheng Jianming later and ask him to consider Xu Yuanyuan’s actual situation and approve her application for the postgraduate entrance examination!”

Zheng Jianming was the head of the city’s cultural Bureau, Wang yaokun’s direct superior.

Wang yaokun’s forehead was full of sweat. He was remorseful. If he had known that Xu Yuanyuan was so stubborn, he wouldn’t have been so reserved. It was originally a matter that could be solved with a phone call, but now there was a big problem.

“Yuanyuan, why don’t you thank Secretary Cao?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Thank ... Director Cao!” Xu Yuanyuan said quickly.

Although Xu Shuyuan did not have a lot of work experience in the system, her emotional intelligence was not low. When she saw that even chief Wang was so respectful to Cao Jin, and that Yao na and Zhuang Cheng, who were always flamboyant, were completely reduced to the background and did not even dare to breathe loudly, how could she not know that Cao Jin’s identity was definitely not ordinary? Since he had spoken, he would definitely be able to help her with this. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Moreover, she had heard Wang yaokun call Cao Jin “director Cao”, so she naturally did not dare to call him Secretary Cao like Xia ruofei did.

Cao Jin smiled and said,”it’s nothing. If comrade Yuanyuan can be admitted to Beijing University’s graduate school, it will also be good for the construction of the unit!” A special talent like you should do things differently. How can you stick to the rules?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but secretly laugh,”the leader’s words are really good. No matter if it’s positive or negative, he can always say something reasonable, and it’s impossible to refute.”

“Secretary Cao, let’s not just stand here and talk. Let’s go to the room and have a seat!” Xia ruofei said.

“Right, Yuanyuan and Zhuang Yan, come up and sit for a while too!” Song Wei said with a smile.

Thus, the group of them walked toward the elevator, leaving Zhuang Cheng, Yao na, and the others standing there looking at each other. They felt as if there was a dagger on their backs, and if they left just like that, they would feel uneasy ...

Xia ruofei looked at Yao na and the others who wanted to follow him but did not dare to. He whispered to Cao Jin and asked Song Wei to lead them upstairs.

Then, he turned around and walked towards Zhuang Cheng and the others ...
