Chapter 3457: Spirit transformation realm, broken

Translator: 549690339

How could immortal Shanhe not know that Xia ruofei was already at his limit? However, Xia ruofei was his disciple. In front of Taoist Qing Xuan, even if he knew that Xia ruofei could only take a few steps, he would not admit it.

“He was already on the verge of collapse at the four – hundredth step. Didn’t he still persist for fifty steps?” Daoist master mountain river said,”moreover, I think that this child still has potential to be explored. At the most difficult time, he might burst out with his potential! So, Daoist Qing Xuan, don’t speak too early!”

Daoist Qing Xuan looked at immortal mountain river with a smile. He was too lazy to argue and just shook his head slightly,”Let the facts speak for themselves!”

“Then let the truth speak for itself!” Immortal mountain river showed no sign of weakness.’The truth will tell you how great my disciple’s potential is!”

8th level of the trial Pagoda.

Xia ruofei stayed on the 450th step for almost ten minutes. He felt that he could not hold on any longer.

Originally, the increase in pressure on the 50th step was already greater than that of ordinary steps. In addition, the pressure had accumulated to this extent, and he was really approaching his limit.

Now, Xia ruofei felt that every bone in his body was creaking and his vital Qi was on the verge of going berserk. Most importantly, his mental energy could not bear the burden anymore. Under the pressure of the strong mental energy, his mental energy was completely suppressed and he felt that his sea of consciousness was being squeezed and shrunk by the huge pressure.

The physical pain was still bearable, but the pressure of the mental power was really unbearable.

Therefore, he struggled on the four hundred and fiftieth step and did not continue to take the next step.

This was because he was very clear that even though the increase in pressure on the 451st step wouldn’t be very large, it was very likely to be the last straw that broke the camel’s back. Before his body could adapt to the current pressure, there was no second possibility of blindly charging forward except for elimination.

As a result, even though he was stuck at the four hundred and fiftieth step, and was also constantly under the immense pressure, he still maintained a clear mind. He did not go blind, nor did he panic.

15 minutes, 20 minutes …

Xia ruofei stayed on this floor for 23 minutes before he felt that his body had gotten used to the pressure.

If he didn’t advance, he might not be able to hold on on this level and be sent flying by the huge pressure.

Hence, even though he was not fully prepared, Xia ruofei still gritted his teeth and took the first step after weighing the pros and cons.

When his left foot landed on the four hundred and fifty – first step, he suddenly felt a buzzing sound in his head and his body shook violently. He was almost thrown out by the force of the pressure.

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and lifted his right foot to step onto the 451st step.

He knew very well that in this situation, if he didn’t put his right foot on the steps in time, it would be even more difficult for him to stabilize his body.

However, as soon as he put his right foot on the ground, the huge pressure also pressed down on him without any reservation.

Although the increase in pressure was not much compared to the 450th step, Xia ruofei was already close to his limit. This small increase was enough to make him teetering on the verge of collapse.

He gritted his teeth and the muscles in his body trembled slightly. The veins on his forehead were protruding and his eyes were bloodshot. He looked extremely terrifying.

While he was using the “great Dao technique” with all his might, Xia ruofei was also constantly enduring the pain from the huge pressure.

But what was even worse was that even though the pressure of his mental energy had only increased a little, it seemed to have really become the last straw that broke the camel’s back.

Xia ruofei felt as if his sea of consciousness was about to collapse. The hundreds of millions of steel needles pierced his head at the same time, giving him the illusion that his head was about to split open.

To make matters worse, his spiritual power supply was starting to run out due to the long – term high – intensity output.

Even though Xia ruofei was extremely determined, he could not help but feel a sense of despair.

However, he still gritted his teeth and persevered. The great pain made him want to roar. He gritted his teeth and tried to stand firm, but his legs were still trembling uncontrollably. He couldn’t even stand straight. He could only barely support himself with a movement similar to the horse stance.

Xia ruofei felt a strong sense of dissatisfaction.

He had already passed four hundred and fifty steps, and it looked like there were less than a hundred steps left, but this road seemed to have come to an end.

The light curtain Door at the top seemed to be close at hand, but even if it was only one step away, it would be difficult for him to reach it in his current state.

From the moment he entered the trial Pagoda, he’d overcome ail obstacles and faced many life and death situations, but he’d made it through all of them.

This Obsidian stairway, as long as you reach the top, you can directly enter the trial Pagoda’s 9th floor, and there are no other tests. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

But it was at this critical juncture that everything was going to fall short.

Xia ruofei knew that he had tried his best. Among the cultivators who were going to the mystic Luna realm, his results should be one of the best. However, he was still unwilling to give up.

From the beginning to the end, he had never wanted to compete with anyone. He felt that he would only have one opponent, and that was himself..
