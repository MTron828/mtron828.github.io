3325 Mission begins (1)

Puchi!

Qu Shuang’s flying sword stabbed into Ling Qingxue’s neck. Because the flying sword didn’t have a hilt, it went straight through, leaving a shocking hole in her neck.

Blood spurted out.

When the qushuang flying sword pierced Ling Qingxue’s neck, Xia ruofei’s heart trembled. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

In fact, he wasn’t absolutely sure. Other than the big and small illogical points he found, his strong intuition was the only thing supporting him.

This was also an instinctive intuition of a cultivator with strong mental power when trapped in an illusion array.

However, no matter how determined he was, Xia ruofei could not be sure that Ling Qingxue was the demon in his heart that was born from the illusion array.

A thought even flashed through his mind – if he had really lost his mind in an illusion formation, to the point that he had completely lost his mind and decided to kill the real Ling Qingxue, that would definitely be a tragedy.

However, Xia ruofei still followed his heart in the end. Without any hesitation, he took out the bent Frost Flying sword and dealt a fatal blow.

The moment the flying sword pierced into Ling Qingxue’s neck, Xia ruofei could not help but close his eyes.

At this moment, he had already made up his mind. If his mind was really affected and he made the wrong judgment, then he would kill himself on the spot and follow Ling Qingxue.

Ling Qingxue fell to the ground, the last bit of life in her eyes slowly disappearing.

The world seemed to have suddenly become abnormally quiet.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath and slowly opened his eyes.

He saw Ling Qingxue’s body on the ground slowly disintegrate into spots of light. The speed of the disintegration was getting faster and faster, and finally, her entire body disappeared. The spots of light also scattered with the wind, leaving no trace behind.

Xia ruofei heaved a long sigh of relief. His strong intuition was right. Ling Qingxue was the inner demon born from the illusory formation.

In fact, he had to be decisive, because if he didn’t kill them, he would be trapped in the illusionary formation forever, and he would be affected more and more deeply. He wouldn’t be able to escape at all, and in the end, he wouldn’t even be able to distinguish between the illusionary formation and reality, and would be completely lost in it.

Perhaps he would still go on a mission with “Ling Qingxue”, or even successfully pass the final trial and welcome the greatest opportunity. Then, he would return to Earth and continue to climb to the peak of his cultivation. However, all of this was illusionary. In fact, he might have only spent a moment in the illusionary array, but he was already trapped to death.

After “Ling Qingxue ‘s” corpse turned into specks of light and disappeared without a trace, the yellow sand – filled environment also began to fall apart.

What was presented in front of Xia ruofei was like a 4D screen, slowly shattering.

Everything came from an illusion and returned to an illusion.

The real world was gradually revealed to Xia ruofei. The flowing streams, the undulating mountains, the dense forest, the green grass ...

Everything here looked like a beautiful painting. The air was filled with dense spiritual Qi, giving Xia ruofei the illusion that he had entered a spirit map space.

Even though it could still be the effect of the illusionary array, Xia ruofei’s uncomfortable feeling had disappeared. His instinct told him that the illusionary array had been broken and what was in front of him now should be the real environment of the third floor of the trial Pagoda.

Of course, just like how he judged that Ling Qingxue was an inner demon created by the illusory formation, Xia ruofei was not confident in his own judgment.

At this moment, a new notification appeared in Xia ruofei’s perceptual mirror.

Congratulations, you’ve passed the preliminary test of the Tower of Trials ‘third level. You’re now qualified to accept the trial mission!

Seeing this short line of words, Xia ruofei’s heart calmed down. The information provided by the perceptual mirror had never been false. Since the perceptual mirror had such a prompt, it meant that he had broken the illusion array.

Xia ruofei turned around and thought about it. She felt that it made sense. After all, Ling Qingxue’s appearance at the end, coupled with the change in the environment, was too deceptive. He might have had many obsessions in his life, but in this secret realm, his greatest obsession was undoubtedly Ling Qingxue. The array had turned his greatest obsession into a demon in his heart, and this was naturally his last resort.

The last method was ineffective, so the illusory formation naturally broke on its own.

As Xia ruofei calmed down, he began to worry about the gains and losses. The facts proved that although he was sent to the same trial space as his companion, they did not appear at the same place. In other words, the companion he sent to this space would also face the test of the illusory formation.

Of course, he hoped that Ling Qingxue would have the one in eight chance. However, at the same time, he was worried that Ling Qingxue would be defeated in the illusory formation. After all, Ling Qingxue had been living in a good environment since she was young. After she started cultivating, she had always been under Xia ruofei’s protection and had never experienced any setbacks. Her actual combat experience was pitifully little. It could even be said that it was almost zero.

It was hard to train one’s mind without going through hardships.

If Ling Qingxue had encountered an illusory formation like the one just now, there was a high chance that she would have gotten lost inside. Xia ruofei could even imagine that if Ling Qingxue had been trapped in an illusory realm, the final obstacle that would have appeared in the end might have been the illusory formation creating an image of herself.
