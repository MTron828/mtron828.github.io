Chapter 467: The Furious Liang Haiming (2)

The answer was self – evident. Fang Luo’s foolishness was the cause of the unexpected disaster that had befallen the city Fox society rats in Sanshan city.

Many people had seen what happened that night, and naturally, Liang Haiming had seen it.

Liang Haiming didn’t dare to provoke Tian Huilan. However, the direct trigger of this incident was Xia ruofei, and Liang Haiming bore a deep hatred for her.

At the Kempinski Hotel in the city center.

Liang Haiming often had to travel between Beijing and Sanshan for business reasons, so he had booked a luxury suite here for a long time.

Liang Haiming was sitting on the soft leather sofa with a gloomy expression. A thin middle – aged man in his forties was standing opposite him, somewhat reserved.

“Young master Liang, I’ve found out that last year, Secretary Tian’s father fainted on the street. Xia ruofei happened to be at the scene and gave his father some first aid.” The middle – aged man said,”maybe that’s why Xia ruofei and Secretary Tian’s family know each other.”

“So, he doesn’t have a close relationship with the Tian family?” Liang Haiming asked with a gloomy face.

“According to our information, Xia ruofei didn’t have any interactions with the Tian family other than that time.” The middle – aged man said cautiously.

“I just want to know how his relationship with the Tian family is!” Liang Haiming frowned and scolded in a low voice.

The middle – aged man’s body trembled slightly as he said,””According to our judgment, they shouldn’t be too close. After all, his identity and background are not in the same world as the Tian family ...”

Xia ruofei’s treatment of elder song was a top secret. With the middle – aged man’s means, he naturally could not find out.

What Liang Haiming didn’t know was that his cousin Liang Haitao had been severely reprimanded by his family because of Xia ruofei. He had even been sent directly from the Huaxia military hospital to the border Army as a basic military doctor.

Because of Liang Haitao’s matter, the song family had tried to negotiate with the Liang family in a serious manner. However, in order to protect Xia ruofei, the song family naturally did not mention Xia ruofei. When Liang Haitao was in the medical team, he didn’t even have the patience to listen to manager Lu’s introduction. He only knew that the young Chinese medicine doctor’s surname was Xia, but he didn’t know Xia ruofei’s full name.

Furthermore, this matter was a great humiliation to Liang Haitao, so he naturally wouldn’t mention it for no reason.

For various reasons, Liang Haiming didn’t know that Xia ruofei had many grudges with the Liang family, and he didn’t know that Xia ruofei was so close to elder song and the entire song family.

“Oh? Have you found out his identity and background?” Liang Haiming asked indifferently.

“Yes, young master Liang.” The middle – aged man quickly said,”this Xia ruofei is a local of the three mountains. His family background is very ordinary. Among his relatives, there is not even a county level cadre or above. He himself just retired from the Army last year and now he has a farm, selling vegetables and other agricultural products.”

When Liang Haiming heard the word “Army,” he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and ask,””What rank was he in the Army when he retired? Company level or Battalion level?”

The middle – aged man’s expression was somewhat strange as he said in a low voice,”Young Liang, he’s not a cadre, he’s just an ordinary soldier. When he retired, he was probably a Sergeant. There’s very little information about his service in the Army. The only thing we can confirm is that his service as a Sergeant hasn’t reached the end of his term. It’s considered an early retirement. I guess he made a mistake in the Army.”

Liang Haiming was completely relieved now. He smiled and said,””So he was only a soldier for a few days! And they were sent back because they made a mistake! I know ...”

Then, Liang Haiming’s expression turned cold and he ordered,””Pass down the order. Ask them to keep an eye on Xia ruofei. Once he comes out, ask Zhao he to take action personally. Tell Zhao he to make him look exactly like Fang Luo. I’ll hold him responsible if he doesn’t break a single bone!”

Fang Luo was just Liang Haiming’s dog. He did not do this just to avenge his dog.

Liang Haiming was holding a grudge because Xia ruofei had ruined his big plan.

Liang Haiming had always been a vengeful person. Xia ruofei’s actions had caused him a lot of losses, so he naturally had to vent his anger. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to get over it!

A trace of fear flashed through the middle – aged man’s eyes, and he quickly replied,””Yes, young master Liang, I’ll get it done immediately ...”

……

Taoyuan farm.

Feng Jing brought Qin Xiaojun and pang Hao to the city to attend a job fair.

Xia ruofei drove the pickup truck out of the farm and headed towards San Shan city.

Yesterday, he had a preliminary understanding of the spiritual puppet’s situation in the booklet, and his heart had long been itching for it.

Most of the materials to make a soul puppet could be bought. Some of them had to be refined and combined with different minerals. However, these minerals were relatively common. Xia ruofei spent half a day on the internet and found most of the required materials.

The e – commerce network was very developed now. After he placed the order, he just had to wait for the logistics to deliver the goods to his door.

However, the core of the spiritual puppet required a piece of Supreme – grade white jade. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The soul puppet core had a very high requirement for the quality of the Jade. It had to be a high – Quality sheep – Fat white jade without the slightest impurity to be able to bear the mind power. This kind of high – Quality Jade was generally hard to come by.

By right, Xia ruofei could have bought it from the MA family’s Hengfeng jewelry. However, he did not want to trouble them with everything. He thought of going to the Jade Market in the city to try his luck. It would be best if he could buy it directly.
