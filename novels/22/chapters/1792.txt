Translator: 549690339

Walking out of the departure hall of the Sanshan International Airport, Xia ruofei saw Ling Qingxue, who was waiting for him in the crowd. Her light yellow down jacket was very eye – catching in the crowd. Ling Qingxue’s face was filled with the joy of a reunion after a short separation, as well as the deep affection that could not be dissolved.

“RUO Fei, this way!” Ling Qingxue shouted as she jumped and waved at Xia ruofei.

Seeing the excited Ling Qingxue, Xia ruofei had mixed feelings. He forced a smile and quickened his pace.

As Xia ruofei walked out of the restricted area, Ling Qingxue had already pounced into his arms.

“Was the journey smooth?” Ling Qingxue raised her head and asked with a bright smile.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” Qingxue, let’s go!”

Lovers were very sensitive to their emotions. Ling Qingxue immediately noticed that Xia ruofei seemed to be in low spirits. However, she did not think too much about it and thought that it might be because he was tired from the journey.

So, Ling Qingxue said,”let’s go!” The car is just outside!”

The two of them walked out of the airport lobby and came to the parking lot.

Ling Qingxue’s car was parked not far from the entrance of the parking lot, and they soon arrived next to the orange Porsche 911.

Ling Qingxue opened the trunk skillfully and let Xia ruofei put the luggage in. Then, the two of them got into the car, one on the left and one on the right.

“Where are we going next?” Ling Qingxue started the car and asked,”are we going back to the farm?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”let’s go to the city!” Let’s have lunch together!”

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue said happily,”but I still have something to do at the company this afternoon, so I might not be able to accompany you ...”

“It doesn’t matter!” Xia ruofei laughed.”If you’re busy, then go!”

Ling Qingxue felt that there was something strange about Xia ruofei, but she could not put her finger on it. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It had only been a few days since they had parted. Xuxu had just returned from the capital. However, in just a few days, Xia ruofei had changed.

After the car drove onto the airport Highway, Ling Qingxue finally couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, is there something wrong?”

“Why are you suddenly asking this?” Xia ruofei forced a smile.

Ling Qingxue glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Usually, when you return to San Shan, the most you do is give me a call. But today, you suddenly asked me to pick you up, and you give me a feeling today ... Something’s not right!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh. Sometimes, a woman’s intuition could be very scary.

“Um ... I do have something to tell you.” Xia ruofei spoke carefully,”but ... Let’s eat first!”

Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”boss Xia, why are you being so wishy – washy?” With our relationship, do we still need to hide things? You’d better say it quickly! Otherwise, I wouldn’t be in the mood to eat! Besides, I’m not hungry right now!”

Xia ruofei gritted his teeth and said,””Alright then! Qingxue, get off the highway at the exit of Zhanggang in front. Let’s go for a walk by the sea! I do have something to tell you. ”

“So Grand?” Ling Qingxue said half – jokingly,”it can’t be a proposal, right? Don’t scare me! I don’t want to get married so early!”

Even though Xia ruofei had a lot on his mind, he was still amused by Ling Qingxue. He said,””Silly girl! Didn’t I have to arrange the proposal in advance? I didn’t plan to go to the beach just now. You were the one who suggested it at the last minute ...”

“That’s true ...” Ling Qingxue mumbled,”what is it?!” Can’t we talk in the car?”

“Let’s go to the beach!” Xia ruofei said.

Ling Qingxue didn’t say anything else, but the curiosity in her heart grew.

Very quickly, Ling Qingxue drove her Porsche 911 out of the highway. After driving along the provincial road for a while, she turned into a beach.

The two of them got out of the car and walked onto the White beach. Ling Qingxue smiled and said,””After keeping me in suspense for so long, you can finally tell me now, right?”

Xia ruofei took a deep breath, looked at Ling Qingxue, and said,””Qingxue, there’s something I have to tell you, but not now ...” He said.

Ling Qingxue laughed and said,”not now ... Then why are you going through so much trouble?” You want me to pick you up personally and even ask me to get off the highway to the beach in advance ... Ruofei, are you kidding me?”

Xia ruofei said seriously,”Qingxue, the timing was not right. You might not believe me even if I told you. So ... I wanted to tell you something else first.”

Ling Qingxue was confused.”Ruofei, you’re beating around the bush. I’m getting dizzy ... If that’s the case, why don’t you just say what you can say now?” she asked. As for the other matter, can’t you tell me when the time is right? If you say it now, aren’t you just letting me hang on to it? There’s no one like you who keeps me in suspense!”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”you’ll understand in the future!” Let’s not talk about this anymore. Qingxue, I’ve called you here today because I have something to tell you!”

Ling Qingxue shrugged and said,”alright!” I will also listen very seriously! Go ahead!”

Xia ruofei organized his thoughts and asked,””Qingxue, do you believe that there is another kind of person in this world who possesses unimaginable power? I’m not talking about money or power, but the great power that the human body can possess. They might be able to fly through the air, grab things from a distance, or even topple mountains and overturn the seas ...”
