Li Yifu couldn’t help but smile wryly,’grand uncle – Master, can you not take a deep breath when you speak? In this short period of time, my mood has gone up and down a few times like a roller coaster ...

Xia ruofei looked at Li Yifu and asked indifferently,””Foster husband, you’ll stay on the island to manage the entire transformation project. If you happen to encounter the people from that cultivation sect who come to attack, your life may even be in danger. So, you should think it over carefully. You can actually choose to spend the rest of your life in America, and I definitely won’t blame you. ”

Hearing this, Li Yifu’s face turned red, as if he had been greatly insulted.

Without the slightest hesitation, he said,”martial granduncle!” Although I’m slow – witted and my cultivation is low, I’m not lacking in courage! This is a matter of great importance to the foundation of the sect. Even if this disciple’s bones are crushed, this disciple will absolutely not retreat!”

A smile gradually appeared on Xia ruofei’s face, and his eyes revealed a trace of relief.

“Foster husband, I’m very happy that you have this intention.” Xia ruofei said,”however, the people from the cultivation sect won’t be coming to Paradise Island for the time being. As long as we are careful, we can still guarantee our basic safety.”

Xia ruofei wasn’t trying to comfort Li Yifu. The star Seizer sect hadn’t fallen out with them yet. They should still have high hopes of buying Paradise Island. Under such circumstances, they wouldn’t come to Paradise Island easily. After all, Paradise Island was a private island. They couldn’t come to the island through normal means. If they sneaked in or snuck into the island, there wouldn’t be much meaning. Besides, if they were discovered, they might even incur Xia ruofei’s hatred and cause the deal to fail.

Therefore, according to common sense, the star Seizer sect’s people wouldn’t be coming to the island at this time.

As long as they did not come to the island, it would be impossible for them to discover Li Yifu’s identity as a cultivator, and he would naturally be safe.

“Senior granduncle, even if there’s danger, I’m not afraid!” Li Yifu nodded.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll tell you the details.” Let’s analyze it together!”

Following that, Xia ruofei explained everything about the star Seizer sect to Li Yifu in detail.

After Li Yifu heard this, he showed a relieved expression and said,””It’s a good thing you discovered it early, or else it would’ve been dangerous!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”my initial plan is to use benilatti to delay time. At the same time, we’ll speed up the formation.” If necessary, we can even send false information to the other party through benilatti and trick them into coming to Paradise Island to trap us!”

Hearing this, Li Yifu pondered for a moment and carefully said,””Martial granduncle, shouldn’t we play it safe? If the trap fails and they manage to escape, the entire star Seizer sect will come at us, and it will be very difficult for us to resist them. Even if the trap was successful, the star Seizer sect would still be able to detect it after some time! And their people being locked up here is a hot potato!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Under normal circumstances, that would be the case. However, what if I’m absolutely sure that I can make the captives betray us and become our people?”

Li Yifu thought about it carefully, and his eyes lit up.”If that’s the case, it might have an unexpected effect!”

However, his expression quickly darkened as he said,”However ... Martial granduncle, it’s not easy to distinguish whether a captive is a traitor. The risk is also very high ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You don’t have to worry about that. Just trust me. I never do things that I’m not confident in.”

After that, Xia ruofei said,”alright, our top priority now is to set up the formation.” This is the key premise of this duel. If the formation is not set up well, then everything is equal to zero!”

Li Yifu felt full of energy. He said eagerly,””Right! Martial granduncle, you can assign the tasks!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You have two tasks at the moment. One is to open the boxes with me and separate the materials so that it’s easy to find and use them.”

“Alright, senior granduncle. What about the second mission?” Li Yifu asked. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Protect me!” Xia ruofei said,”guard this place well and don’t allow anyone to come close or spy on us. You should be able to do this, right?”

Li Yifu was stunned. He didn’t expect Xia ruofei to arrange such “low – end” work for him, such as opening boxes and being a Sentry ... Who wouldn’t be able to do this kind of work?

“Yes, sir!” Out of respect for Xia ruofei, Li Yifu did not haggle. He even hid his disappointment well.

Xia ruofei knew what was going on. He smiled and said,””Foster husband, the main task at this stage is to process these materials. This involves complex array knowledge, and it also has a very high demand on spiritual power, so you can’t help much for the time being. However, your work is also very important, especially the second one. When I’m processing the materials, no one can disturb me. Otherwise, wasting precious materials is a small matter, and even I will be greatly affected and hurt. Therefore, my safety and the safety of the materials are all in your hands. ”

Li Yifu quickly replied,”I understand!” Don’t worry, martial granduncle, this disciple will do my best to complete the task you’ve given me!”

“Mm! Let’s start!” Xia ruofei said.

The two of them found two steel drills in the corner of the warehouse and began to break down the wooden boxes containing the materials.
