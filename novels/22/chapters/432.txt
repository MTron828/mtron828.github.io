Chapter 433: This policewoman is not simple (2)

Qin Xiao Yu hesitated for a moment, her face showed a trace of guilt, then she picked up the phone again, this time she dialed another string of numbers.

If Xia ruofei was here, he would be shocked because the number that Qin Xiao Yu dialed the last time was actually Tian Huilan’s private number.

A mere Deputy Section Chief policewoman had actually called Tian Huilan directly, and she had even called Tian Huilan’s personal phone.

This Qin Xiao Yu was no ordinary person!

Qin Xiao Yu muttered to herself,”Youyou, I really can’t cover up for this!” I can only report this to Auntie Tian. Don’t blame me ...”

The phone rang a few times before it was connected. Tian Huilan’s voice came from the phone,””Xiao Yu.”

“Hello, aunt Tian!” Qin Xiao Yu immediately greeted sweetly.

Tian Huilan chuckled: “Xiao Yu, you’re actually calling me during working hours. Did you get into trouble at work again?”

“Aunt Tian, am I really a troublemaker in your eyes?” Qin Xiao Yu immediately retorted.

“Girl, have you ever stopped?” Tian Huilan’s voice was filled with adoration.

“Auntie Tian, I’m very well – behaved, okay?” Qin Xiao Yu said coquettishly.

“Who doesn’t know about the daughter of the Qin family in Beijing? You think you’re obedient?” Tian Huilan chuckled and continued to ask,”what’s the matter? I have a meeting in 15 minutes. ”

Qin Xiao Yu immediately said seriously: “”Aunty Tian, I have something to report to you.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Tian Huilan was stunned for a moment when she heard Qin Xiao Yu speak in such a formal tone. She then asked,””Xiao Yu, is it about work?”

“That’s true, and not exactly ...” Qin Xiao Yu said,”aunt Tian, before I report this, you have to promise me that you won’t be angry.”

“Yo! He was already bargaining! And you say you didn’t cause any trouble?” Tian Huilan smiled and said,”go ahead! As long as it’s not a big mistake, I won’t be angry with you. ”

“Auntie Tian, it’s not my business!” Qin Xiaoyu pouted and said while operating the computer,”are you in the office now? I’ll send you a video. You’ll know when you see it. ”

“What’s the matter? “So mysterious ...” Tian Huilan said.

The video was about 500 megabytes and it would take some time to upload to the email. Qin Xiao Yu continued,””Auntie, this has something to do with Youyou, but you don’t have to worry. She’s fine.”

“Youyou?” Tian Huilan couldn’t help but be shocked when she heard this. She hurriedly asked,”did Youyou go out and cause trouble?”

“Aunt Tian, it’s like this,” Qin Xiao Yu said.”The day before yesterday, we received a report that there was an armed fight at the zero degree dream bar in the beijiangbin area. I led a team to the scene that night ...”

Qin Xiao Yu used a few simple sentences to report the entire matter to Tian Huilan, then said,””That’s what happened. I thought it was just a normal fight, but when I saw the surveillance video that the suspect kept, I was shocked. The friend he saved was Youyou!”

Tian Huilan sucked in a breath of cold air and cried out,”How could this be? Youyou never goes to those messy places!”

At this time, there was a ding from the computer and Qin Xiao Yu said,””Aunty Tian, the video has been sent to your email. You’ll know after you take a look.”

“Alright, Xiao Yu, thank you!” Tian Huilan said,”don’t hang up. I’ll watch the video first.”

“Alright,” he said.

Tian Huilan quickly downloaded the video and played it on her computer.

At the beginning of the video, Lu You was loitering at the entrance of the bar for a moment before pushing the door open and walking in.

Tian Huilan was naturally very familiar with her own daughter. She did not need to look at her daughter as carefully as Qin Xiao Yu. Even if it was just a vague back view, Tian Huilan could recognize her at a glance.

“How slow ...” Tian Huilan muttered, her eyes filled with disbelief.

When she saw Lu You being chased and blocked by a few burly men in the bar, she could not help but shiver when she saw them rush in and drag her to the second floor after she hid in the men’s bathroom.

Tian Huilan’s husband had been a police officer in his early years, but he had sacrificed himself on the line when Lu You was very young. She and Lu You had only each other, and Lu You, her daughter, was her greatest spiritual sustenance.

When she saw her daughter in the video, Tian Huilan was angry but also worried. Even though Qin Xiao Yu had said that Lu You was fine, she still couldn’t help but feel worried.

After Xia ruofei had edited the video, the waiting time in the middle had been removed. Soon, Xia ruofei’s voice appeared in the camera, and the few men who had blocked him were swept away like chickens and dogs.

“Little Xia!” Tian Huilan couldn’t help but exclaim.

She didn’t expect Xia ruofei to save Lu You at such a critical moment. It was strange, but her heart, which had been clenched, calmed down a lot after seeing Xia ruofei.

Perhaps Xia ruofei had created too many miracles in the past six months!

The video finished playing very quickly. Tian Huilan’s face was a little pale, and the hand holding the phone was even slightly trembling. This vice – provincial official had lost his cool when it came to matters related to his daughter.

Tian Huilan took a few deep breaths and calmed herself down. She then said,”Xiao Yu, I’ve finished watching the video.”

Qin Xiao Yu didn’t hang up the phone just now, she asked tentatively,””Auntie Tian, do you know the person who saved Youyou?”

“Yes, Xiao Yu,” Tian Huilan said indifferently,”Xiao Xia has helped me a lot. This time, he saved Youyou and taught a lesson to a group of scumbags who were worse than beasts. Let’s put an end to this matter!” Let him go immediately. ”

“Oh ... Okay.” Qin Xiaoyu was stunned for a moment and said.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Xiaoyu quickly returned to the interrogation room. She looked at Xia ruofei with a complicated expression and said to the police officer,””Open the chair.”

“Captain Qin ...” The police officer hesitated.

“I told you to open it, so open it!” Qin Xiao Yu said impatiently,”what are you waiting for?”

“Yes!”

The police opened the chair that trapped Xia ruofei and Qin Xiaoyu said coldly,””You can leave now ...”

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and walked out without a second word. After Qin Xiao Yu recognized Lu You, Xia ruofei had already guessed the result, but he didn’t expect it to come so quickly.

The police officer looked at Qin Xiao Yu in disbelief and then watched Xia ruofei leave the interrogation room and walk out of the door.

“Captain Qin, what ... What’s going on?” The police officer asked.

“Don’t ask so much. It’s just teaching a few scumbags a lesson. Do you really want to make things difficult for them? Then wouldn’t we be helping the evildoer?” Qin Xiaoyu said,”I will report to bureau chief Chen personally!”

“Yes!” The policeman said.

“Alright, let’s call back our brothers!” Qin Xiao Yu said,”everyone has worked hard these two to three days, hurry up and rest, maybe there will be a big mission soon ...”

“Is that so?” The police officer was immediately excited and asked,”Captain Qin, what’s the big mission? Let’s leak some information first!”

Qin Xiao Yu said: “you’ll know when the time comes. In short, everyone should take this one or two days to rest. In a few days, we’ll definitely be fighting continuously!”

“Understood!”

Qin Xiao Yu left the interrogation room after she was done explaining.

As soon as she came to the corridor outside, she saw the director of the city Public Security Bureau, Chen Bo, walking over in a hurry.

As soon as Chen Bo saw Qin Xiaoyu, he immediately said,””Little Qin, so you’re here! Hurry up and follow me, Secretary Tian has an urgent mission!”

Qin Xiao Yu was well aware of this and immediately replied: “”Yes!”

Then, she quickly caught up with Chen Bo.

Qin Xiao Yu couldn’t help but feel excited: After two to three months, he finally had the chance to show his skills.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei walked straight out of the Public Security Bureau.

He had come in the police car, but there was no police car to send him back now.

So, he stood by the road in front of the Public Security Bureau, ready to hail a taxi back to the farm.

At that moment, a BMW MINI sped towards the police station. Xia ruofei did not even see it clearly before the car passed him like the wind.

However, just as the car was about to enter the gate, it suddenly braked and quickly reversed to the side of the road.

A pretty girl opened the car door and got out, running towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei was also dumbfounded,’Lu You? What are you doing here?”
