Chapter 409: Xia ruofei’s anger (1)

Xia ruofei placed the things in his hands back into the car and took out his phone to take a look. He realized that it was Lu You calling.

“Miss Lu, what’s the matter?” Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”don’t tell me you want the jaded skin ointment again? I’m telling you, my jaded skin cream is very effective. You don’t have to use it every day. ”

“Xia ruofei, I have something that I need your help with ...” Lu You said directly.

She ignored Xia ruofei’s joke and seemed to be in a bad mood.

“As long as you don’t have any ideas about my jaded skin cream, everything else is fine.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”tell me, what is it?”

“Shall we meet and talk?” Lu You said,”do you have time in the afternoon? Let’s have a meal together. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei hesitated for a moment. It was almost lunchtime and Lin Qiao was about to leave school. Every time he brought Taoyuan vegetables to Hu Zi’s mother’s place, he would stay behind to help with the house’s cleaning and then have a meal with the mother and daughter.

However, Xia ruofei could feel that Lu You seemed to be a little helpless now. He rarely heard Lu You speak in such a weak tone. If he rejected her, he would not be able to bear it.

After a moment of silence, Xia ruofei said,””Alright, see you in half an hour. You decide the place.”

“Mm! I’ll send you the location in a bit. ” Lu You said hurriedly.

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he took his things and went to Hu Zi’s mother’s house. After talking to her for a while, he told her that he had other things to do in the afternoon and had to leave the forestry Bureau’s family courtyard before Lin Qiao finished school. If Lin Qiao came back, it would be difficult for Xia ruofei to get away.

Lu You had already shared the location with Xia ruofei through WeChat. Hence, after Xia ruofei went downstairs, he drove the pickup truck straight to his destination.

Lu You’s restaurant was located in an elegant environment in the yl District. It was about a seven to eight minutes drive from the forestry Bureau’s family residence. Soon, Xia ruofei arrived at the restaurant called “impression of Jiangnan”.

After parking his car in the parking lot, Xia ruofei walked into the restaurant and took out his phone to call Lu You.

“I’m here. ” Xia ruofei asked,”where are you?”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, he saw Lu You standing up from a nearby booth. She was holding her phone in one hand and waving at him with the other.

Xia ruofei smiled and put away his phone. He strolled over to Lu You.

Xia ruofei casually sat down in the seat opposite Lu You. He took a big gulp of the lemon water in front of him and then asked with a smile,””What’s the matter? you’re in such a hurry to find me. ”

Lu You’s eyes flickered, but she did not look at Xia ruofei. She just pushed the menu to Xia ruofei and said,””Take a look and see what you want to eat first!”

“Woof! The vegetables here are not cheap!” Xia ruofei glanced at the menu and said,”let me make this clear. I left in a hurry today and forgot to bring my wallet ...”

Lu You couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei and said,””Order whatever you want. It’s my treat today.”

Xia ruofei laughed. Of course, he was joking. With his current wealth, he could afford a restaurant that was ten times more expensive than this one. In fact, he saw that Lu You was a little depressed and wanted to lighten the mood.

He picked up the menu and randomly ordered two or three dishes, then asked,””What do you want to eat?”

“I’ve already ordered. ” Lu You said.

Xia ruofei nodded and passed the menu to the waiter.””That’s all for now! I’ll add more if it’s not enough. ”

“Alright, please wait a moment.” The waiter took the menu and said respectfully.

After the waiter left, Xia ruofei took another sip of water and asked,””What do you need help with? can you tell me now?”

Lu You hesitated for a moment, gritted her teeth, and said,””Be my boyfriend ...”

Xia ruofei had not swallowed the mouthful of water in his mouth. When he heard what she said, he spat it all out. Fortunately, he had lowered his head to look at his phone, so his saliva had landed on the table. Otherwise, it would have landed on Lu You’s face.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry ...” Xia ruofei said as he randomly took out tissues from the tissue box to wipe the table.

“What did you just say?” Xia ruofei looked at Lu You with a strange expression and said,”is there something wrong with my ears?”

Lu You’s face turned slightly red. At the same time, she felt a little angry. She thought to herself,’am I that unlikable to you?’ He was actually so scared ...

Lu You’s expression became a little cold as she said,””Don’t misunderstand. I’m not asking you to be my boyfriend. I just want you to help me put on an act ... I’m in a bit of trouble and I’m afraid I can’t get rid of you, so I want to ask you for a favor. ”

Xia ruofei seemed to understand. He smiled bitterly and said,””If I’m not mistaken, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend? It can’t be that melodramatic, right?”

Lu You didn’t say anything. She just looked at Xia ruofei quietly.

The bitterness on Xia ruofei’s face intensified. Needless to say, he must have guessed it right. It was so melodramatic.

After calming down, Xia ruofei said calmly,””Tell me the situation in detail.”

Lu You’s expression flickered. She lowered her head and said softly,””There’s a guy who’s pursuing me, and it’s not convenient for me to reject him. I’d like to ask you to pretend to be my boyfriend and make him give up.”

“Is it really that simple?” Xia ruofei asked, frowning.
