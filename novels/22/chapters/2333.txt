Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”uncle song’s most serious injury is a brain injury. It shouldn’t be a big problem for now.” However, he has multiple fractures in his body. According to common sense, he should be able to recover in about three months after a hundred days. ”

“Don’t keep me in suspense, kid,”elder song chuckled.”I’m sure you have a way to help him recover faster, right?”

Song Qiming’s position was very important, and it was unlikely that he would be left vacant for three months. If the recovery period was really that long, a new leader would have to be appointed to replace him.

By the time his body recovered, it would be too late.

Although he wouldn’t stay at home because of this, he would definitely be transferred to another position.

At his level, song Qiming’s current position was already the best. Furthermore, there were not many positions at the top of the pyramid to begin with. It was impossible to arrange a position of similar importance for him. There was a high chance that he would be assigned to a relatively idle Department and only enjoy the corresponding treatment.

Xia ruofei chuckled and asked,””Grandpa song, how long do you want him to recover?”

“Woof! So if I want him to go to work tomorrow, you can do it too?” Elder song asked jokingly.

However, he was only joking. After he finished speaking, he pondered for a while and said seriously,””If you can control the recovery cycle to be about one month, I should have room to coordinate all aspects!”

Elder song did not know that as long as Xia ruofei wanted to, song Qiming could even be alive and kicking immediately.

This was because the problem that troubled Xia ruofei was not these external injuries, but the damage to his soul and sea of consciousness.

Now that this problem had been solved, so what if the external injury was serious? It was just a waste of a few more spirit Heart Flower petals.

Compared to the precious spiritual crystals, Xia ruofei did not feel any heartache for the regrown petals of the spiritual heart Flower. It did not matter if he used them.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not do that.

It was difficult to use Chinese medicine to explain how a serious fracture could be completely recovered in such a short time.

On the other hand, a more serious brain injury would not easily arouse suspicion. After all, the research on the human brain in modern medicine was extremely limited. There were too many unknown areas, and it would not be surprising if anything happened.

Hence, after hearing elder song’s words, Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,””No problem! I can guarantee that in a month ... No! 25 days! I’ll return you a healthy uncle song in 25 days!”

“That’s great!” Eccentric song couldn’t help but exclaim in excitement.

“Grandpa song, I have a request,” Xia ruofei continued.

“You say it! As long as it’s within my means and it goes against my principles, there’s no problem!” Eccentric song said without hesitation.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s not that serious. My request is for uncle song to be discharged in two days after his condition has stabilized. He can receive treatment at home.”

Xia ruofei made such a request because he wanted to keep a low profile.

Elder song immediately understood Xia ruofei’s intention. He said without thinking,””No problem! I will personally coordinate this matter! Then ... I’ll leave Qiming’s follow – up treatment to you!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

An early discharge from the hospital did not seem like a big deal. However, song Qiming’s status was different. Moreover, his external injuries were so serious that it was necessary for elder song to personally come forward to coordinate things. He also needed to inform the higher – ups in the southeast province and Beijing.

“Don’t worry! I promise to complete the mission!” Xia ruofei said confidently.

“Then I’ll be waiting for your good news!” Elder song chuckled and asked,”by the way, you’re still ignoring old Liu! When are you going back to the capital? Can I take care of both?”

Xia ruofei said,”let them wait a few more days!” He won’t die so soon anyway! I’ll go back after I’m done here. It’s not a problem to take care of both sides. It’s just a few more trips! Don’t worry!”

“Hahaha!” Elder song couldn’t help but burst out laughing. That’s good!”

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he turned around and saw Song Wei standing outside the ward and staring at him.

Xia ruofei stuffed his phone into his pocket and walked over with a smile.””Wei Wei, what are you daydreaming about?”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Ruofei, thank you ...”

Xia ruofei looked around and realized that there was no one in the corridor. The people in the ward were all focused on song Qiming. He hugged Song Wei secretly and quickly separated.

“What nonsense are you saying!” Xia ruofei said affectionately,”do you have to be so polite with me?”

Song Wei blushed and said,”I ... Previously, Qingxue and I teamed up to give you the cold shoulder ... Don’t be angry! Actually, when you contacted me, I was so happy! It’s just that ... I’m not in a good position to do that ... After all ...”

Xia ruofei laughed,”silly girl!” Why would I blame you? Come to think of it ... The ones who are really wronged should be the two of you ... Forget it! Let’s not talk about this! Let’s go in! Uncle song just woke up, we should be happy!”

“En!” Song Wei nodded and followed Xia ruofei back to the ward.

Professor Chen personally performed many examinations on song Qiming. Then, according to song Qiming’s condition, he developed a detailed rehabilitation plan.

Looking at the excited and busy professor Chen, Xia ruofei did not have the heart to tell him that all the rehabilitation plans would soon be canceled because song Qiming would not be receiving rehabilitation treatment at the General Hospital.

The medical staff was busy for a while, and the ward finally returned to peace.

In order to give song Qiming enough rest, professor Chen and the others left the room. Even Cao Guangzhi waited outside the ward. Only Fang Liyun, Xia ruofei, and Fang Liyun stayed.

Xia ruofei stood up and poured a glass of water. He walked to the bed and smiled.”Uncle song, have some water first! You’ve been relying on fluid transfusions for the past few days. I’m guessing your mouth must be dry by now!”

Xia ruofei then gestured for Song Wei to feed song Qiming some water.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already secretly put a few drops of concentrated spirit Heart Flower petal solution into the cup.

Even the pot of boiling water was personally fetched by Xia ruofei. He only filled half the pot and the other half was filled with some spiritual water from the spiritual pool.

There were no surveillance cameras in the water room, so Xia ruofei found an empty place and finished the job without anyone knowing.

The petals of the spirit Heart Flower were very effective in healing external injuries. The spirit pond water could also refresh one’s mind. In the past, whenever Xia ruofei’s spiritual power was exhausted, he would take the spirit pond water to speed up his recovery.

To song Qiming, this cup of water was exactly what his body needed.

As expected, song Qiming looked much better after drinking the glass of water.

He said weakly in a hoarse voice,””Ruofei, our family owes you another life ...”

Song Qiming said the same thing as elder song.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”uncle song, you’re welcome!” I’m just in time ... I happen to know some medical skills, and it’s mainly because you’re in good health. If it were someone else, they might not have made it. ”

Then, Xia ruofei briefly told him about how song Qiming had been injured for the past few days and how elder song had called him several times to ask about his condition.

Xia ruofei had also informed song Qiming of his decision to be discharged from the hospital in two days and go home for rehabilitation.

Song Qiming nodded slightly and said,””The Bureau chief’s concern for me is really unrequited ...”

With his political wisdom, he naturally knew elder song’s intention for Xia ruofei to shorten the recovery time. He was touched.

“I’ll listen to you regarding the treatment. I’ll follow your arrangements!” Song Qiming continued.
