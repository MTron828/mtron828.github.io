Chapter 1368: Dividends from the winery_2

Translator: 549690339

Moreover, he felt that the current sales model of Drunken Eight Immortals was quite good. It was appropriate to maintain a bit of hunger marketing. No matter how popular the sales were, the production volume was limited. What he pursued was the quality of the products, so he had to strive for perfection!

Generally, high – Quality brands were a little aloof. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei laughed dryly.”Uncle Ling, actually, it’s quite troublesome to improve the process and link of the liquor production. It must be done by human hands. So...It may not be easy to expand the production ...”

Ling Xiaotian laughed heartily and said,””Ruofei, I’m just saying. I’ve been in the business for so many years, and I’m very clear that greed is not enough to swallow an elephant. It’s already a great surprise for the winery to have such a performance!”

“It’s good that you understand, uncle ...” Xia ruofei said.”Well ... Since there’s no problem with the winery’s capital chain, I’ll take the bonus!”

Now that the accounts of domestic companies had been squeezed dry, with the 50 million, Xia ruofei would be more well – off. Even if the club’s plan was to start ahead of schedule, at least he would not have to use overseas funds.

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”good!” I’ll get the finance department to prepare the dividends documents and send them over for you to sign. Then, I’ll transfer the money to you! By the way, you transferred it to your personal account, right?”

“Mm! You know my account number. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

When Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian had worked together, they had used their skills to buy 50% of the shares. They had not paid any money from the company’s books, so it was equivalent to personal shares. Naturally, the dividends did not need to be transferred to paradise corporation’s account.

Although Xia ruofei held 100% of the shares of paradise Corporation, he had promised to give Feng Jing a dividend from the profits. Furthermore, he would expand the scope of the dividends and benefits. Hence, he had to clarify the accounts in the future. Business was business, and private was private.

Xia ruofei did not plan to use the company’s name to buy in the club in the capital. Instead, he would use his personal name. After all, this had nothing to do with the company’s business.

Of course, it was not because he wanted to give his employees a bonus. That was why Xia ruofei deliberately reduced the profit points of paradise Corporation.

In fact, the highly profitable projects, such as the tin bucket and the Cordyceps, were all managed by Xia ruofei himself. In the end, they were all operated in the name of the company. The profits from these were already unimaginable to ordinary people.

The bonus was meant to motivate the employees. Xia ruofei would not lose the big picture for a small gain or do something that would destroy his own future.

After ending the call with Ling Xiaotian, Xia ruofei returned to the villa and found Zhao Yongjun and the others surrounding the big fish tank in the living room, looking very interested.

When he saw Xia ruofei return, Hou Liang called out,””Brother Xia, you’re a big tycoon indeed! He’s actually raising such a high – Quality blood – Red Dragon!”

Zhao Yongjun was obviously an expert in this field. He said,””RUO Fei, not bad! Your Blood Red Dragon’s body, head, fin, hair color, and range are all top – grade, and the redness is simply perfect! If it wasn’t for its obvious characteristics, I would have mistaken it for a Chili Red Dragon!”

The redness of the blood – Red Dragon was slightly lower than that of the chili Red Dragon. However, Xia ruofei’s blood – Red Dragon was obviously redder than the average Chili Red Dragon. This was extremely rare ...

Even Wei Jun, who didn’t know much about Arowana, couldn’t help but exclaim,””It’s so beautiful! It’s like a piece of art ...”

“That’s the effect of the light. It’s not that red ...”Xia ruofei laughed.

Zhao Yongjun said seriously,”I’ve been playing with Arowana for many years. I can tell if it’s natural or not. Ruofei, don’t be so humble. This Blood Red Dragon is not cheap, right?”

Zhao Yongjun loved antiques and literature, and many of his hobbies were inseparable. Many collectors liked to keep fish, play with crickets, play with walnuts or gourds, and so on. Zhao Yongjun also liked to raise Arowana, and he had a pair of good Red Dragons at home.

Of course, compared to Xia ruofei ‘s, it was a few levels worse ...

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Okay, okay!” We’re almost drooling ... Brother Zhao, I actually have some channels to get good quality Red Arowana. If you like them, I can find you a better pair next time, but they won’t be this big!”

“That’s great!”Zhao Yongjun was overjoyed. It’s fine if it’s a little small. As long as it’s a good breed, I’ll have a greater sense of achievement by slowly raising it myself!”

Red Arowana could be raised for many years. The feeling of raising them from a young age was often much better than buying a pair of adult red Dragons.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Alright! Then I’ll keep an eye out and definitely find you a pair of pure – blooded, high – Quality ones, at least not far from mine!”

“Good, good, good! Big brother thanks you in advance!” Zhao Yongjun rubbed his hands in excitement.

Hearing this, Hou Liang couldn’t help but feel slightly moved. He quickly chuckled and said,”Brother Xia ... That ... If there’s anything good, don’t forget about me! I also want a pair ...”

“And me!” Xu Zixuan, song Rui, and Liu Jian all said in unison.

Only Wei Jun was a little embarrassed, but the expression on his face was also very obvious. It was obvious that he also wanted it.

“What are you all doing?” Zhao Yongjun said, pretending to be serious. Do you think that top quality blood red Dragons are cabbages? You pair up and I pair up. Are you kids splitting the fruits?”

“Brother Jun, no matter how much brother Xia can find, you’ll definitely be given the priority!” Hou Liang quickly said. If you have more, even if the quality is slightly worse, can you consider us? Brother Xia, I was the first one to speak!”

Hou Liang said as he looked at Xia ruofei.

Before Xia ruofei could say anything, Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,””Do you all really think that Red Arowana is one of those common goods sold in the flower and bird Market? Do you know how much a pair of top – grade young red Dragon fish costs?”

“How much?” Hou Liang asked, somewhat confused. Fifty thousand? A hundred thousand? Brother Jun, this fish is so beautiful. Even if it’s a little more expensive, we’d still want to keep it!”

“Fifty thousand?” Zhao Yongjun laughed. A hundred thousand? Liangzi, look at that ignorant face of yours! RUO Fei, tell them, how much would such a fine breed of young blood – Red Dragon cost?”

Xia ruofei looked at Hou Liang and the others and laughed,””A pair of blood red Dragons of similar quality would cost about six million! Last time, there was a pair of purple and red Dragons that were sold for 18.88 million!”

Hou Liang and the others were all shocked by the price, but Zhao Yongjun already knew the market, so he wasn’t surprised. His focus was on the purple dragon.

Zhao Yongjun’s eyes widened in disbelief,””You can actually find the brilliant purple red Dragon? RUO Fei ... This is unbelievable!”

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””It’s such a coincidence ... Brother Zhao, you’re an expert in this field. This kind of mutated species is hard to come by ...”

“That’s right, that’s right ...” Zhao Yongjun said,”but next time, you must leave the best for me! It would be great if there are any mutated species. Price is not a problem!”

“Definitely, definitely!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll call you if I have any news ...”

At this moment, Hou Liang finally recovered from his shock. He muttered, “I’ve really not seen much of the world ... A pair of ornamental fish for six million, and there’s even one that’s close to twenty million ...”

“The rarer something is, the more precious it is!” Xia ruofei was used to it. “Actually, this thing is just to spend money to buy happiness. There are many rich people nowadays!”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said,””But if you guys wanted it, I definitely wouldn’t sell it at such a high price. The price I said was the result of the bidding. For example, the purple and red Dragons were raised so high because several big bosses competed for it and were almost desperate! If you want it, I’ll give you the cost price!”
