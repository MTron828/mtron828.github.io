“Mr. Xia,” old Blake said,”I just said that our only request is the truffle supply. I hope we can get the support of paradise Corporation!”

Xia ruofei looked at old Blake quietly, waiting for him to continue. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Old Blake took a sip of wine and continued,”We hope to get at least 100 kilograms of truffles a year. As long as the quality is on par with the truffles we auctioned yesterday, it’ll be fine.”

100 kilograms of truffles was really nothing to Blake’s group, which had countless chain stores. Even if they were to split it evenly, each store might not even get a piece, especially when each piece of truffle from paradise Corporation was so heavy.

However, there wouldn’t be an unlimited supply of such high – end ingredients. What old Blake wanted was the brand effect. If other restaurants had it but they didn ‘t, then the quality would drop.

If they could get a supply of 100 kilograms, the situation would be reversed. After all, the truffles that their competitors could get were limited, while the black group had so much.

As for the tens of millions of dollars to buy truffles, it was nothing to the big black group. Besides, it was definitely not a loss to buy truffles, and it would definitely make a lot of money if it was sold in a Western restaurant chain.

Xia ruofei smiled faintly.”Mr. Old Blake, there’s such a large supply, and it’s exclusive to you. I’m afraid it’s not enough to deal with one George Blake.” Our company doesn’t produce a lot of truffles either, so our old friends can only buy them through auctions!”

Xia ruofei’s meaning was clear. Not to mention the past grudges with Blake, even if it was a normal business deal, at most, he would not stop Blake’s group from participating in the auction and let them compete normally. If he wanted to enjoy the exclusive supply, old Blake did not offer enough chips.

However, business had to be negotiated, and old Blake was naturally not satisfied with just participating in the normal auction. He had spent so much effort, flying from France as the head of the Blake family, not just to be able to participate in the auction.

Old Blake smiled.”Mr. Xia, we promise that the purchase price will not be lower than the auction price of your truffle. We can also sign an agreement that no matter how the truffle market is in the coming year, the purchase price will not be lower than the previous year’s price. This agreement is valid for a long time.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

Old Blake’s suggestion was quite tempting, and it was also risky. After all, the market price of truffle was closely related to the production, and the production was greatly affected by the climate.

If the next year’s climate was very suitable for truffles to grow, and the production suddenly went up, the price of truffles would inevitably fall. If they still kept the base price this year, the Blake group would have to pay a lot more money.

As for Xia ruofei’s side, it was a greater guarantee.

However, Xia ruofei did not make a sound. He pondered for a while and understood.

In fact, old Blake didn’t take too much risk in doing this.

The key to the problem was that the truffles of paradise Corporation were not ordinary truffles.

For truffles of this grade, the market fluctuations didn’t have much of an impact on their prices. No matter how much truffles were produced back then, the Paradise truffle was definitely a rare product.

The price of such a top – grade ingredient might fluctuate according to the market price. For example, the price of truffles that were auctioned yesterday was generally higher than the normal price, but the fluctuation was very small.

In fact, Blake’s promise to keep the price would not cause them to lose a lot of money.

Xia ruofei had a clear idea of what was going on after he understood this.

He looked into old Blake’s eyes and said calmly,””Mr. Old Blake, I’ll add two more conditions on top of this, and I’ll agree to the cooperation.”

“Mr. Xia, please speak!” Old Blake was a little excited, but he didn’t show it. He still had a graceful smile on his face.

Since he had stated his conditions, there was room for negotiation.

Xia ruofei said,”first, the truffles purchased by the Blake group can only be used for the operation of their branches. They can not be resold. This must be written in the agreement.”

If Blake Corporation bought the truffles from paradise Corporation and sold them at a higher price, even if it was only a part of it, it would affect paradise corporation’s reputation. Xia ruofei was definitely not willing to see that happen.

The Taoyuan truffle had to be an exclusive business, and he didn’t want the cooperation to end up in a sales model.

Old Blake smiled and said,”this is what I should do. I agree.” What’s the second?”

“Second, the purchase price and the auction price are not equal enough.” Xia ruofei said calmly,”I hope it’s at a premium, at least 10%!”

The smile on old Blake’s face froze and turned into a bitter smile,””Mr. Xia, isn’t this ... A little too expensive? The auction price is already much higher than the market price ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”Mr. Old Blake, if I’m only going to buy it at the auction price, why would I need to cooperate with Blake’s group?” Couldn’t they just directly hold another auction? This is actually more beneficial for spreading our company’s brand. You should know that at this stage, our paradise Corporation values brand value more than economic benefits. ”

There was no doubt that the influence of the auction was far greater than the deal with the black group.

“Mr. Xia,” old Blake said,”in addition to the auction price, we’ve also promised a base price for the next year. About this ...”

“Mr. Old Blake, I won’t beat around the bush.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you and I both know the significance of this guaranteed purchase price. How much do you think the price can fall for truffles of this grade? I’m very happy with the terms, but I’m not satisfied with them. ”

A bitter smile appeared on old Blake’s face. A 10% premium was equivalent to paying an extra one or two million dollars, and the truffles were still the same truffles, so the profit space of the Blake group was very small.

After Xia ruofei stated his conditions, he poured himself a glass of wine. He took a sip and leaned back in his chair, waiting for old Blake’s decision calmly.

Old Blake thought for a while and said with a bitter smile,””Mr. Xia, I accept your conditions! I hope that you and I can put aside our past grudges and cooperate sincerely!”

“Happy cooperation!” Xia ruofei raised his glass and said calmly.

“If there’s no ten percent premium, it’ll be a very pleasant cooperation.” Old Blake smiled bitterly and shook his head. Then, he raised his glass and clinked it with Xia ruofei ‘S. He continued,”however, to be able to find such a high – Quality partner like paradise Corporation, it’s still worth it to spend 10% more.”

“Old ginger is spicier.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Mr. Old Blake has made a wise decision!”

“Thank you for the compliment.” “Mr. Xia, when can your company provide truffles?” old Blake asked.

Xia ruofei took a sip of wine and said,””I’ll leave the cooperation to our company’s general manager, Ms. Feng Jing. You can send someone to Sanshan city to discuss the specific agreement with her! As long as the agreement is signed, we’ll get the goods ready as soon as possible. ”

“Okay,” old Blake nodded and said,”I can transfer two million dollars to you today.”

Xia ruofei took out his business card and wrote down his overseas account number. He said, This is my offshore company account. You can transfer the money directly to this account.”

“OK!”Old Blake carefully put away the business card and said,”George’s treatment can be written in the attached rules of the agreement as a prerequisite for the agreement to take effect, but ... I hope your company can keep this a secret.”

“We can sign another confidentiality agreement.” Xia ruofei said immediately.

Xia ruofei had gained some benefits and taught Blake a lesson. Naturally, he would not publicize this matter anymore. It would not do him any good to damage the reputation of Blake’s group.

“That would be the best.” Old Blake said happily.

The two of them stood up and shook hands. Today, they had only reached a verbal agreement. The specific terms of the agreement still needed to be discussed by representatives from both sides before they could officially sign it.

After the deal was settled, Xia ruofei beckoned to old Blake and left the private room. He had no interest in having dinner with an old France man.

Xia ruofei went back to his room and ordered another lunch. After he finished eating, he calculated the time and realized that Feng Jing’s plane should have landed by now. Hence, he searched for Feng Jing’s number on his phone and dialed it.
