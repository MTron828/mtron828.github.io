Chapter 1704: The seniority is in a mess (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was a little confused. According to Li Yifu, his cultivation technique was passed down in his family, but how could his family have the Guiyuan Scripture? Even if it was an incomplete inheritance, it was still a little impossible!

If it was any other technique, Xia ruofei wouldn’t feel that there was anything wrong with it. After all, there were many techniques recorded in the human jade talisman. Most of them were collected by the previous owner of the spirit map space over a long period of time. He chose some techniques that were of a good level and could verify the cultivation of the “great Dao Sutra” and stored them in the human jade talisman.

However, the origin returning Scripture was different!

At the end of the “origin returning Scripture”, the owner of the spirit map space also left behind a paragraph of text, clearly stating that this was a cultivation method he had created himself.

Could it be that Li Yifu’s family had some sort of relationship with the owner of the spirit map space?

Xia ruofei’s mind was racing, and he couldn’t help but think of the words left behind by the previous owner of the spirit map space in the “origin returning Scripture”.

In addition to explaining the origin of this cultivation method, the passage also mentioned that he had once taught this cultivation method to a youth surnamed li in a mountain village in Xichuan province. The specific age was not mentioned in the passage, so it was impossible to test it.

Coincidentally, Li Yifu’s surname was also li. Xia ruofei immediately connected the dots.

He couldn’t help but ask,”senior li, may I ask where your ancestral home is?” When did they move to United States?”

Although Li Yifu was an United States Chinese, there was no doubt that his ancestors must have come from China.

Although Li Yifu did not understand Xia ruofei’s sudden question, he still answered honestly,””Mr. Xia, my family is from Yunan Province. My father went to Southeast Asia when he was young and then went to the United States to make a living. My generation can be considered the second generation ...”

“Ruofei,” Tang Yitian added,”Grandpa Li’s father was the legendary leader of the Hong sect, li Jiuzhou. He passed away a few years ago at the age of 126. In the eyes of the younger generation, Grandpa li Jiuzhou was like a god!”

Li Yifu forced a smile and said,”Yitian, don’t flatter my father and me anymore!” Otherwise, we’ll be laughed at. Mr. Xia’s cultivation will soon reach my father’s level ...”

“What?” Tang Yitian and Xu Ziyuan both gasped and called out in unison.

Xia ruofei didn’t pay any attention to them. Instead, he looked confused and mumbled to himself,””It’s not from Xichuan? And the name is wrong ...”

Tang Yitian, who was the closest to Xia ruofei, couldn’t help but ask,””Ruofei, what Xichuan province?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh!” It’s nothing ... I originally thought that senior li had some connection with my sect, but I might have been wrong. The information doesn’t match ...” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Li Yifu’s expression changed when he heard that. He asked anxiously,””Mr. Xia, may I ask what your sect is? Why would you say that you have a connection with my family?”

Xia ruofei thought about it and felt that it was not a secret. He smiled and said,””It’s like this ... When we were fighting just now, I felt that senior Li’s palm technique and true Qi were somewhat familiar, so I asked. However, my master’s successor is from Xichuan province, and the cultivation technique is only similar, not completely the same, so I must have made a mistake!”

Although Xia ruofei had never met the previous owner of the spirit map space, he had inherited the most precious spirit map space and learned the “great Dao Sutra” that he had left behind. Hence, in Xia ruofei’s heart, he had long regarded this master as his master.

In fact, this was the case. It was just that Xia Qing did not tell Xia ruofei that after Xia ruofei inherited the magic weapon, the spirit map world, Xia ruofei was already the successor of the previous master of the spirit map space.

Li Yifu was so excited that his beard was trembling. He asked in a trembling voice,””Mr. Xia, what is the name of the cultivation method of your sect?”

Xia ruofei said,”it’s very similar to the name of your cultivation technique. It’s called the Guiyuan Scripture!” That’s why I mistakenly believed that senior Li’s family and my sect had some sort of connection. ”

“Origin returning true Scripture!” Li Yifu’s eyes flickered as he cried out.

Seeing Li Yifu so emotional, Tang Yitian couldn’t help but worry,””Grandpa li ...”

Li Yifu waved his hand and looked at Xia ruofei eagerly. He asked in a trembling voice,””Mr. Xia, may I ask ... The successor you mentioned from Xichuan province, is he ... Is his name ... Li beihuai?”

After Li Yifu finished his question, he stared at Xia ruofei, his heart beating even faster.

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and asked curiously,””Eh? How did you know? This li beihuai ... He should be my senior brother, right?”

In fact, according to the records of the spirit map space’s previous owner, he had taught Xichuan’s Li beihuai the origin returning true Scripture on a whim. In fact, he had not officially accepted li beihuai as a disciple.

However, li beihuai could be considered half a senior to Xia ruofei. After all, they had the same teacher.

To that expert, it was just a good relationship. Of course, to li beihuai, it was definitely a super great opportunity that could change his life.

Li Yifu’s voice was like a Thunderbolt, completely stunned. His lips trembled unconsciously, showing the excitement and shock in his heart at the moment.
