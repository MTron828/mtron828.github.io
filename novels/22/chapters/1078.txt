Then, Dong Xinyu looked at Feng Rao with an unfriendly expression and said,””Boss Feng, is this the quality of your company’s employees? If that’s your attitude, then there’s nothing to talk about!”

Xia ruofei was relatively young, and his skin had become very fair after his cultivation. He had also been standing behind Feng Rao the entire time, so Dong Xinyu had assumed that he was Feng Rao’s subordinate.

“Ms. Dong, this is Mr. Xia ruofei, the chairman of our company. He’s my superior,” Feng Rao said with a frown.

Dong Xinyu was stunned for a moment. She glanced at Xia ruofei in surprise, then pouted and said,””So it’s the chairman! No wonder he’s so arrogant!”

Xia ruofei was so angry that he almost laughed.”Miss Dong, President Feng and I flew all the way from San Shan to Beijing to talk about cooperation. We had an appointment to meet tonight, but you stood us up for no reason. I just wanted to ask. Can’t I do that?”

At this moment, the fat middle – aged man sitting opposite Dong Xinyu looked at Feng Jing and Xia ruofei with interest. His gaze lingered on Feng Jing’s beautiful face for a moment before he asked with a smile,””Miss Feng, I’m Li Yao, the General Manager of the Huaxia region of the Yafu group. What business does your company do? Are you also interested in working with miss Dong?”

Feng Jing had just introduced Xia ruofei as the chairman of their company, but Li Yao was acting as if Xia ruofei did not exist. He was smiling cheekily, obviously not taking them seriously.

Feng Jing’s expression changed slightly when she heard the words ‘Yafu group’.

This was a famous cosmetic brand in the Wei nation, and it was definitely a well – deserved giant in the cosmetic industry.

Dong Xinyu had stood them up and was having a meal with the people from the Yafu group. It was obvious that the Yafu group also had their eyes on Dong Xinyu, who was clearly on the rise in her career.

Feng Rao’s mind raced, but she still said calmly,””So it’s boss li, nice to meet you!”

“Miss Feng, this is my name card.” Li Yao elegantly handed over a business card and said,”if your company is also interested in cooperating with Ms. Dong, I might be able to help!”

As he spoke, his burning gaze kept darting around Feng Jing’s face, making her feel very uncomfortable.

Feng Jing didn’t take the name card, but said,””Thank you for your kindness, boss li, but I’m afraid you can’t help us with this. The product that our company is looking for miss Dong to endorse is ...”

“President Feng!” The woman with heavy makeup sitting next to Dong Xinyu quickly interrupted Feng Jing,”can we discuss the cooperation tomorrow? Right now, Xinyu has something important to discuss with CEO li. I’ll have to trouble you to go back first!”

“You must be sister Fang!” Feng Jing smiled faintly.”You seem to be afraid that I’ll introduce our company’s business to boss li?”

The woman with heavy makeup was Dong Xinyu’s manager, Fang Hongli. After hearing Feng Jing’s words, a trace of panic flashed across her eyes, but she pretended to be calm and said,””What are you saying?”

In fact, Fang Hongli was indeed worried.

This was because Li Yao was also looking for Dong Xinyu to discuss the matter of the endorsement.

On the other hand, the same celebrity naturally could not endorse different brands of products of similar nature. This Yafu group was also a cosmetic company. If Li Yao knew that Dong Xinyu had the intention to cooperate with other cosmetic companies, he would most likely not be too happy.

Dong Xinyu said impatiently,””Sister Fang, why are you wasting your breath on them?”

Then, Dong Xinyu glanced at Feng Rao and said,””President Feng, you guys can go back first! If there’s anything, we can talk about it when I’m free ...”

Dong Xinyu had risen to fame through a talent show. Although her popularity had risen rather quickly recently, her Foundation was still lacking.

Previously, Feng Jing had personally spoken to them a few times on the phone, and the two sides had basically agreed on a one – year endorsement contract. The total value was three million Chinese dollars, but it had to be paid in three installments. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This was already a considerable amount of income for Dong Xinyu. Her manager, Fang Hongli, was also encouraging her from the side, so she had basically agreed.

She didn’t expect that just yesterday, the Yafu group would actually come to her door and want to invite her to be their spokesperson. Moreover, it was the General Manager of the Huaxia region, Li Yao, who personally came forward.

Li Yao also promised to sign a three – year contract with her. The first year would be three million Yuan, and there would be a certain increase every year.

This caused Dong Xinyu to change her stance.

No one would go against money.

Not to mention that Yafu group was much stronger than the little – known paradise company.

When a celebrity chose an endorsement contract, they also had to look at the strength of the partner.

International luxury brands like coach and LV were highly sought after by celebrities, because being able to endorse such top brands also represented the influence of a celebrity.

This had nothing to do with economic benefits.

Of course, the endorsement fees of these international brands were not low.

Similarly, between the Yafu group and the Paradise Corporation, Dong Xinyu had chosen the Yafu group without any hesitation.

As for the agreement to cooperate with the peach blossom company and even receiving a “sincerity gold” of 100000 Yuan from the company, Dong Xinyu did not take it to heart at all.

Hence, she treated Feng Jing and Xia ruofei coldly and rudely.
