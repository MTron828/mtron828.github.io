Chapter 127: Cultivating truffle_1

[Please continue to ask for monthly votes Xia ruofei returned to his bedroom, carefully closed the curtains, and locked the door and windows. Then, he summoned the spirit map scroll from his body and entered the spirit map space with a thought. The insulated box with truffles was placed beside the spatial spirit pond. Xia ruofei carried a clean box and walked over. He opened the chamber and took out the truffles that were buried in the rice. Xia ruofei realized that there was not only the precious white truffle, but also the high – Quality black truffle. After a while, there were two piles of truffles in the tidying box. One was white truffle and the other was black truffle. They were all the purest truffle from the Alba region of Italy. Each pile was about two kilograms. Xia ruofei took some water from the spirit pool and poured it into the sorting box. When the water was just above the truffle, he stopped pouring. Then, he took the Tupperware containing the petals of the exotic flower. There were already 16 petals in it. He carefully picked up a petal with a pair of tweezers and threw it into the tidying box. When the flower petal came into contact with the spirit pond water, it immediately dissolved. Xia ruofei used a small wooden stick to carefully mix the ingredients before leaving the spirit map space. He went to the balcony to smoke a cigarette. From a distance, he saw ye Lingyun’s Knight XV driving back, so he left the bedroom and quickly went downstairs. As soon as they arrived downstairs, the huge black SUV rushed into the courtyard and stopped steadily next to the pickup truck. The small pickup truck was like a pocket toy beside the Knight XV. Ye linyun and pang Hao jumped off the car. Ye Lingyun returned the keys to Xia ruofei and said excitedly,””Brother Xia, this is so satisfying! It was like driving an armored vehicle in the Army! And it’s much more comfortable than armored vehicles!” “Next time, if you feel like it, you can come to me for the key!” Xia ruofei laughed. “Yes! Thank you, brother Xia!” Ye linyun said happily. “Ruofei ...” Pang Hao asked meekly,”that ... After I get my driver’s license, can you let me have a hand too?” He was so envious when he saw ye Lingyun driving. Xia ruofei laughed mockingly.”Lil ‘fatty, practice your skills first. Once you get your driver’s license, you can build that pickup truck however you want!” “Ah? “I still have to drive the pickup truck first ...” Pang Hao said with a bitter face. “Of course, there’s no after – Sales service for this car in China. Even if you scrape off some paint, I’ll have to ask the car modification shop in Hong Kong to get it done!” Xia ruofei said,”little comrade, don’t aim too high! When your skills are good enough, it’s not impossible to lend it to you for fun ...” “Alright ...” Xia ruofei laughed.”Alright, alright. Go and do your work!” Ye Lingyun and pang Hao went off to attend to their own matters while Xia ruofei returned to his bedroom, took out the spirit painting scroll, and entered the medium. He had been in the outside world for ten to twenty minutes, which was about five to six hours in the medium. The truffles must have fully absorbed the composition of the petals. After Xia ruofei entered the interspace, he took the box with truffles and walked to the other side. This area was previously empty and Xia ruofei did not have the time to develop them. However, three days ago, when Xia ruofei had just returned to Sanshan city, he had bought more than 20 oak saplings through Liang Qichao and planted them. Xia ruofei even used a petal of a strange flower to make a solution to water it. Three days ‘time was equivalent to almost two months in the origin space. Now, this place had become an Oak Forest. These oak trees had long since survived and had grown to the size of a bowl. Xia ruofei put down the box of truffles and then went to the side to get a shovel. Xia ruofei had also searched for information on truffle cultivation on the internet. Basically, the success rate of artificial cultivation of truffles was extremely low. At present, there were some relevant scientific research institutions in China that had made some attempts, mainly to carry out artificial infection on sterile saplings, and then transplant the infected truffle saplings into the forest. The success rate of this method was still not high, and it required special delicate maintenance and management of the forest, and it would take six to eight years for truffles to be produced. During this period, if the soil quality, temperature, humidity, sunlight, and other environmental factors couldn’t meet the conditions to produce truffles, it was likely to be a waste of effort. Naturally, Xia ruofei did not know how to infect the saplings with the fungi, so he decided to use the stupid method. He first took out a military dagger and cut the White truffle and black truffle into slices. Then, he started to dig under the oak tree with the shovel. Xia ruofei realized that the oak tree had completely taken root. Its roots were very thick, obviously due to the effect of the petal solution. He dug 20 centimeters deep, then used his hands to push away the soil next to the oak tree root. He placed the cut truffle close to the root, then filled the space with soil and poured the newly formulated flower petal solution. Xia ruofei did not know how to infect the oak tree root with the truffle fungi, but the ready – made truffle was stuck to the root and had been watered with the petal solution. It should be able to infect it successfully! Then, they did the same thing. Every thick root of each tree was dug out, and truffles were implanted in them. They were then refilled and watered with a petal solution. In order to increase the success rate, Xia ruofei had placed several pieces of truffle on each root in different positions. Even so, after planting all four kilograms of truffles, Xia ruofei was so tired that he was sweating. He had dug at least one to two hundred holes. For more than ten hours, he had been digging holes, planting truffle slices, filling them back, and watering them. After everything was done, Xia ruofei straightened his body and stretched his sore waist. He muttered to himself,””It’s finally done. You guys have to work hard! Otherwise, all my investment will be in vain. ” Not to mention the expensive truffles, Xia ruofei had spent three petals to plant one in the oak tree and another one to soak in truffles. He had used another one when he planted the truffles at the root. If this stupid method didn’t work, it would be a huge loss. Of course, now that everything was done, he could only wait. It would take at least four to five years to see the results in the outside world. However, Xia ruofei’s interspace had the time acceleration, the petal solution, the spatial spirit pool water, and the spiritual energy in the upgraded interspace. The results would probably be out in a month or so. If truffles could be produced, it would be close to the end of the traditional truffle season and bring Xia ruofei a lot of profits. Xia ruofei left the medium and went to the bathroom to take a shower. After washing away the dust on his body, it was almost time to eat. By the time Xia ruofei went downstairs, ye Lingyun had already prepared lunch. Ever since Yingying moved in, Xia ruofei did not have to worry about cooking. He only had to make sure that there were ingredients in the refrigerator. After having lunch with ye Lingyun and pang Hao, Xia ruofei returned to his room. He took out his phone and was about to call boss Chen of Lingyu house. The farm would be ready for use in a few days, and it would be the Spring Festival soon. They would be very busy then, so Xia ruofei wanted to use these two days to exchange the five million Yuan for Jade to see if he could evolve the spirit map space again. Five million Yuan was a little too much. Xia ruofei was worried that spirit Jade house might not be able to gather so many goods in a short time, so he decided to make a call first in case he found nothing. “Haha, brother Xia!” As soon as boss Chen picked up the phone, he laughed heartily and said,”why did you think of calling me? Are you itching to gamble in my shop again?”
