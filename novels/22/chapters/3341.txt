3342 Dead end (2)

This time, Shen tianfang’s reaction was not fast enough. He managed to avoid getting hit in his vital parts, but his arm was pierced through and blood flowed out.

Shen tianfang groaned in pain and shouted,””Xia ruofei, do you really want to fight to the death?”

“Is there any room for negotiation between us?” Xia ruofei sneered and asked.

“Don’t think that you’ve got me!” Shen tianfang said hatefully,”I’ve been cultivating for more than 200 years, and I still have some trump cards. Even if you can kill me, this precious array will be destroyed! At that time, it will be a lose – lose situation. ”

Shen tianfang had always thought that the trap and kill array was given to him by Xia ruofei’s master. It would be a great loss if such a precious array was destroyed.

What he didn’t know was that Xia ruofei had designed this formation himself. If Xia ruofei wanted to and had enough time, he could make a whole new set without any cost.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”since first elder Shen still has a trump card, then quickly use it!” Otherwise, you won’t have the chance to do so later!”

With that, Xia ruofei controlled the qushuang flying sword to draw an arc again and stabbed towards Shen tianfang’s head.

A few large holes had already been pierced through the light barrier by the flying swords, and its defensive power had been greatly reduced. Many of the black beams were able to drill through the holes.

However, Shen tianfang had a feeling that the black light would be very terrifying, so he would rather be stabbed by the qushuang flying sword than give the black light any chance.

Of course, the protective barrier was already on the verge of collapse, and he did not have much Yuan Qi left.

It could be said that he had no chance of turning the tables now that things had developed to this point.

Shen tianfang was both shocked and furious. He shouted as he tried to block the attack,””Xia ruofei, don’t think that you can kill me here without anyone knowing! If I die, there will be an indelible mark on your body. Any disciple of the first heaven society will be able to sense it! This is a secret skill of the first heaven society. If you kill me, you’ll be hunted down by the entire heavenly sect when you get out!”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be slightly stunned, and his attack was instantly stopped.

Seeing this, Shen tianfang quickly said,”Xia ruofei, there’s no need for us to fight to the death!” What good would it do for you to kill me? Now that everyone was in this trial space, the most important thing was to complete the trial mission and obtain the great opportunity! I can swear to my inner demons that today’s matter will end here and I will never harm you in the future. Also, I, Shen tianfang, will never reveal this to a third person!”

Shen tianfang knew that he was in a critical situation, so he did not dare to act like a senior anymore. His tone was a little humble.

However, after Xia ruofei heard this, he felt that this person should not be kept alive.

People who could yield and stretch were often the most terrifying.

Shen tianfang was one of those people who would throw away his dignity for the sake of survival. How trustworthy was his oath? Swearing on the inner demons was indeed very restrictive, but it was not completely impossible to avoid. It was difficult for others to notice that some words were used in the oath. Even if there were no loopholes in the oath, Shen tianfang would still have other ways to deal with Xia ruofei in the future.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei’s killing intent became even stronger. He no longer cared about what Shen tianfang said. He controlled the qushuang flying sword and launched an even fiercer attack on Shen tianfang.

Shen tianfang thought that he had finally convinced Xia ruofei, but he did not expect the attack to stop for only a few seconds before it came back to him again.

Shen tianfang was shocked and angry.”Xia ruofei!” He shouted.”Are you really going to do this?” I’m not trying to scare you, but you can’t hide it from the first heaven society if you kill me! Are you really prepared to fight against the entire heavenly sect by yourself? And that martial nephew of mine, Chen Xuan, you two are good friends! When that time comes, he’ll definitely break off relations with you!”

Xia ruofei didn’t move at all. The qushuang flying sword became faster and faster, and more and more black rays of light gathered.

Finally, the protective light screen formed by the one – time use Dharma Treasure released by Shen Tian finally shattered under the accumulation of attacks.

Shen tianfang’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. The black rays of light were no longer blocked. They formed a dense attack array around him, blocking all his escape routes.

Puchi! Puchi! Puchi!

A series of muffled sounds rang out. At the same time, Shen tianfang’s body was pierced by many black rays. Some of the rays went directly through his head, chest, and other vital parts. Blood spurted out of the wounds like a fountain.

Shen tianfang’s body suddenly stiffened, and a look of disbelief appeared on his face. He still could not accept the reality that as the cultivator with the highest cultivation level and the longest cultivation time in the expedition team, he was so easily killed by a junior in the early golden core stage.

Shen tianfang could feel that his life force was dissipating rapidly. His eyes were filled with hatred as he said,””Xia ... Xia ... Ruofei ... You’re in ... In big trouble! The first heaven society ... Will fight you to the death!”

Blood gushed out of Shen tianfang’s mouth as he spoke, making him look even more terrifying.

After saying that, Shen tianfang’s eyes lost their light, and his body fell to the ground, stirring up a cloud of dust.

Just as Shen tianfang’s life was about to end, a ray of five – colored light suddenly appeared above his head. The ray of light circled around Shen tianfang’s body and then shuttled through the formation.

The trap formation was still in operation, but it seemed to have no effect on the five – colored light.

The five – colored light flew around the array without restraint, as if it was looking for something. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

At this moment, in the mountain and sea realm of the spirit map space, Xia ruofei, who was using his spiritual power to observe the outside world, could not help but Mutter to himself,””Shen tianfang was not bluffing just now ... Fortunately, I thought of such a wonderful method ...”

After Shen tianfang’s threat, Xia ruofei was already thinking of a solution. Although Shen tianfang might be bluffing, Xia ruofei could not risk his life.

After all, once they lost the bet, it would mean that they would fight to the death with the heavenly sect and never have a peaceful day.

Hence, Xia ruofei had thought of the safest solution in the shortest amount of time. He quickly hid in the spirit map space.

Although Xia ruofei did not know how Shen tianfang’s curse – like threat would come true, and he did not know if hiding in the spirit map space would work, this was the best solution he could find at the moment. After all, he and Shen tianfang would not rest until one of them was dead.

Hence, when Xia ruofei made his last attack, he entered the spirit map space with a thought.

The spirit painting had been prepared long ago and Xia ruofei had hidden it in the grass at the eye of the formation.

After entering the spirit map space, Xia ruofei immediately released his spiritual power to check the situation outside.

Sure enough, the moment Shen Tianqi and Qi Jue died, a five – colored light appeared.

Xia ruofei believed that if he was still in the outside world, the five – colored light would definitely find him and leave an inextinguishable mark on him.

In the future, when he returned to the cultivation world on earth, this mark would be like a light bulb in the dark. Anyone from the first heaven society would be able to see that he was the one who killed Shen tianfang.

At the thought of this, Xia ruofei could not help but feel a lingering fear.

Of course, he could hide in the Peach Blossom Island until he was strong enough to fight against the first heavenly sect, but that wasn’t his style. Besides, he had too many connections in the mortal world, and he couldn’t guarantee that the first heavenly sect wouldn’t be angry and attack his friends and family in the mortal world.

After all, apart from Shen tianfang, there were two other people from the first heaven society in the team, including Chen Xuan. It was impossible for him to quietly Return to Paradise Island.

In other words, as long as he was marked, the news that Xia ruofei had killed Shen tianfang would be spread, unless he killed Chen Xuan and Xu yurou as well. Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan got along well, and he had no enmity with Xu yurou. How could he kill them?
