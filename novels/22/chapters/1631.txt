Chapter 1632: Midnight operation (1)

“Tonight?” Song Rui was stunned.”Aren’t you a little too anxious?” Actually, we can still make it in time if we go tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei was both angry and amused. He said,””Do you think this is a prayer for rain? Picking a time? Besides, my young master Song, you better know what we are going to do! Could he just run over in broad daylight? Of course, I’ll go secretly at night!”

Song Rui came to his senses and smiled embarrassedly. Then, he said excitedly,””Good evening! It’s so exciting just thinking about it ... Hahahaha ...”

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun looked at each other helplessly, and both of them smiled bitterly.

This was a land worth hundreds of millions, and it was a matter of whether their club could be successfully settled in little Tang town in the future. This young master actually thought that he was looking for excitement ...

Xia ruofei cleared his throat and said, “I’ve seen the weather forecast. The clouds are thicker today, so the moon shouldn’t be out. Let’s make it tonight! After dinner, we’ll rest for a while and wait until the second half of the night to act!”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun said,”we’ll follow your orders. Ruofei, is there anything else you need to prepare?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”I’ve prepared everything. I just need to bring a few more shovels. I’ll ask Wu Qiang to prepare them!” You guys don’t have to worry about it ...”

Xia ruofei added,”by the way, don’t go there at night. First, it’s easy to be exposed if the target is too big. Second, there’s no need for so many people.”

Most of the work tonight would be physical work and these young masters would not be of much help. Hence, according to Xia ruofei’s plan, it would be best if he brought Wu Qiang along. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, if that was the case, they would definitely not do it.

Sure enough, song Rui said,”I don’t care about other people!” I’m definitely going!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”how about this?” Big brother Zhao and song Rui will accompany me, and Wu Qiang will drive. The four of us will drive the Mercedes – Benz, so we can bring our things along!”

Since song Rui wanted to go, Xia ruofei couldn’t let Zhao Yongjun stay, so he suggested this.

Zhao Yongjun thought about it and said,”I think it’s fine, let’s do it this way!” Liu Jian, you guys can go back to your homes after dinner! Remember, this matter must be kept a secret. You can’t reveal a single bit! Otherwise, if Liu er goes crazy, everyone will be in trouble ...”

Since the big boss had already decided, Liu Jian, Xu Zixuan, Hou Liang, and Wei Jun naturally didn’t dare to have any objections and quickly nodded in agreement.

Hence, Xia ruofei called Wu Qiang over and asked him to buy some food and wine for everyone’s dinner. At the same time, he asked him to prepare a few shovels.

After dinner, Liu Jian and the others said goodbye to Xia ruofei and left the courtyard in the big Cleaver. Xia ruofei asked Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and Wu Qiang to go back to their rooms to rest. They wanted to recharge their energy in the first half of the night and get ready to kill their way to Xiaotang town in the second half of the night.

However, looking at song Rui’s excited face, it was probably hard for him to fall asleep.

Xia ruofei didn’t care if song Rui had enough rest. Anyway, this kid used to party every night. It was normal for him to stay up all night. It was fine if he didn’t sleep for one night.

He pushed song Rui out of the room and told him to find a room to take care of him. Then, he locked the door and took a shower. He laid on the bed feeling refreshed and fell asleep in a short while.

This was also a skill that he had trained in the special Combat Commando unit. No matter how bad the environment was, when he wanted to sleep, he would touch the pillow.

It was a taboo for special combat soldiers to be so excited that they couldn’t sleep because of such a small matter. This was because they couldn’t guarantee that they would always be energetic. Being able to sleep was also a great ability.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes at around 11:30 pm.

He rubbed his eyes, went to the bathroom to wash his face, put on his coat, and walked out of the room.

As soon as Xia ruofei stepped out, he saw song Rui pacing back and forth in the courtyard in a thick coat.

As soon as song Rui saw Xia ruofei, he said,””Kid, you really can sleep! I thought you were going to sleep until tomorrow morning!”

Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry. I won’t delay anything. I don’t even need an alarm. I can wake up whenever I want!”

“If you’re bragging, then ...” Song Rui muttered.

“Where’s brother Zhao and Wu Qiang?”Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“They went to the backyard to prepare the car and supplies. They told me to wait for you here!” Song Rui said. You’re the one who’s the most patient ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and asked,”don’t tell me you haven’t slept at all?”

Song Rui blushed and said,”you’re meddling too much!” Alright, alright, don’t dawdle, let’s go! If we don’t leave now, it’ll be daybreak soon ...”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He casually slung his backpack over his shoulder and brought song Rui to the backyard.

Wu Qiang had already loaded everything into the car. He had especially woken up earlier and turned on the heater after starting the car. Hence, when Xia ruofei got into the car, he felt that the car was warm.

Xia ruofei sat in the front passenger seat and said to Wu Qiang as he fastened his seat belt,””Let’s go!”

“Okay, boss!” “Yes,” Wu Qiang replied calmly. He started the car and drove out from the side door of the backyard. After turning into the road behind, the electric door behind him slowly closed automatically.
