Chapter 429: Chapter 375 – in the police station again (1)

Xia ruofei saw Qin Xiao Yu’s expression and couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He knew that the investigators must have gotten some evidence and it was very likely that the evidence was pointing to him.

In fact, this was the case.

The case of the zero degree dream bar was definitely not a small case since it had been transferred to the criminal Police. Qin Xiao Yu was the leader of the team who had arrived at the scene that night. She had seen the tragic state of the gang of gangsters with her own eyes, especially brother Hu and Fang Luo’s appearance. Even as a police officer who was used to crime scenes, she still felt a chill in her heart.

That method was too vicious and cruel ...

Especially when they found Fang Luo on the second floor, Qin Xiao Yu almost vomited on the spot. When the other male police officers saw the scene, they clamped their legs together subconsciously.

Qin Xiao Yu was the person in charge of this case and her police officers had split up to handle the case. She had brought two of her subordinates to question Xia ruofei, who was a suspect of the crime, while many other police officers were doing interviews and investigation work.

It was another group of police officers who had just received the news. They had found a few customers who had spent at the bar that night and had taken photos of Xia ruofei beating up the big men who were guarding the place. Brother Tiger and Fang Luo, who were lying in the hospital on the verge of death, had identified the photos as the culprits.

Hence, Xia ruofei had suddenly become the prime suspect.

Qin Xiao Yu stared into Xia ruofei’s eyes and said,””Xia ruofei, you’re suspected of an intentional injury case. I’m now officially summoning you on behalf of the criminal Police detachment of the Sanshan Public Security Bureau! We’ll make up the relevant documents immediately, so please come with us now!”

“Brother Xia!” Lei Hu, who was at the side, looked at Xia ruofei nervously.

Xia ruofei calmly waved his hand at Lei Hu and then said to Qin Xiao Yu,””Alright, let’s go!”

Qin Xiao Yu hesitated for a moment and took out the handcuffs from her waist.

Xia ruofei squinted his eyes and said,”officer Qin, I’ve already agreed to go back with you. Is there still a need for this?” And ... Do you think this thing can handcuff me?”

“Cut the crap!” Qin Xiao Yu snorted coldly and said,”you’re a suspect now, what right do you have to bargain?”

After that, Qin Xiao Yu walked up with the handcuffs.

To be honest, Qin Xiao Yu was actually very nervous at this time. One would know if there was an expert once they made a move. Although Xia ruofei had only shown a little bit of his skills, Qin Xiao Yu could tell that Xia ruofei’s skills were definitely better than hers.

The two police officers were also on guard, their hands already on the handles of their guns.

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and did not resist. Instead, he stretched out his hands with a relaxed expression.

With two clacking sounds, the bright handcuffs were placed on Xia ruofei’s wrists.

Xia ruofei raised his hand and looked at it indifferently, while Qin Xiao Yu gently pushed his back and said,””Let’s go!”

Xia ruofei followed the two police officers unhurriedly to the Santana police car that they had driven over. He did not forget to stop and tell Lei Hu to pass on the message to pang Hao that he would be temporarily in charge of the farm work. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When they reached the police car, one of the police officers opened the back door and got in first. The other police officer gently pushed Xia ruofei, signaling him to get in.

At this time, Qin Xiao Yu also opened the door of the front passenger seat and was ready to get in.

“Officer Qin ...” Xia ruofei called out.

Qin Xiao Yu turned around and saw Xia ruofei holding the pair of handcuffs in his hand. He said with a smile,””You should keep it well! There’s no place to buy this thing if we lose it ...”

Qin Xiao Yu was stunned. She had clearly handcuffed Xia ruofei to his hands just now and she had deliberately done it very tightly in order to make Xia ruofei suffer. She had never thought that Xia ruofei would be able to get his hands off his hands so easily and the three of them had not even noticed.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already learned this trick when he was in the Army. After taking the body tempering soup a few times, Xia ruofei’s control of his muscles and bones had improved. It was easy for him to break free from the handcuffs.

While Qin Xiao Yu was still in a daze, Xia ruofei laughed and hung the handcuffs on the open door handle, then got into the police car.

Qin Xiao Yu finally came back to her senses. She couldn’t help but glare at Xia ruofei fiercely and picked up the handcuffs with a dejected face. She didn’t mention the handcuff on Xia ruofei anymore. Since Xia ruofei could break free so easily, wouldn’t it be humiliating to handcuff him again?

I hope there won’t be any more trouble on the way ... Qin Xiao Yu said in her heart.

The other policeman had a strange look on his face. He looked at Xia ruofei before getting into the car. The other two policemen sandwiched Xia ruofei in the middle.

However, they still didn’t feel safe at all, and their hearts were in their throats the whole way.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes. The car drove all the way to the city Police station. After entering the fast way around the city, Xia ruofei even started to snore softly.

Xia ruofei was sleeping soundly after the bumpy ride. He was still snoring even after the police car stopped in the courtyard of the criminal Police detachment.

Qin Xiaoyu was in a state of fear along the way, afraid that Xia ruofei would suddenly attack her. On the way, Qin Xiaoyu even investigated Xia ruofei’s file through the internal system. However, she could only find out that Xia ruofei had served in a military group before and retired from active service early last year. She could not see any detailed information about his service period.
