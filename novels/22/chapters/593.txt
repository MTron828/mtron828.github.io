Chapter 594: Making a big profit (3)

Xie Xun immediately said,”go!” Why not? I’ll pay six million for this pair of blood red Dragons!”

“You ...” Yang Dahua didn’t think that Xie Xun would actually bid after being provoked.

This kind of top – grade blood Arowana was very rare, and there was no clear price standard. Red Arowana of ordinary quality could range from a few thousand to tens of thousands. The highest record in the past few years was five million for one, so three million for one was already a very high price.

Xu Desheng was already in a dilemma about whether it was worth it to raise the price. When he saw Xie Xun raise the price again, he gave up on the thought and stepped to the side.

Yang Dahua’s eyes widened and he said,””Six million two hundred thousand!”

Xie Xun pouted and said,”6.5 million!” Old Yang, I want this pair of blood red Dragons!”

Yang Dahua was so angry that he rolled his eyes. Why was this old man biting whoever he wanted? He had raised the price by another few hundred thousand all of a sudden. He was simply a madman!

Xia ruofei was overjoyed to see these bosses bidding.

In the end, yang Dahua chose to give up on Xie Xun. This madman didn’t play by the rules. It wasn’t worth it to fight with him until both sides were injured. Anyway, there were still two more pairs to go. There was no need to fight to the death with him.

As a result, Xie Xun got his wish and bought the first pair of blood red Dragons for 6.5 million.

He was so happy that his bald head seemed to be shining. He took out his checkbook and signed a check for 6.5 million Yuan, then handed it to Xia ruofei. Then, he carefully carried the plastic box to the side and looked at the two Blood Dragons inside. The more he looked at them, the more he liked them.

Xie Xun took out his phone and made a call. He sent someone with a special fish tank to drive over and pick up the blood Dragons.

After he was done with the arrangements, Xie Xun came over to watch the show.

......

Xia ruofei moved the second plastic box to the middle of the courtyard. He purposely left the plastic box that li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin had taken a few looks at at last.

Xia ruofei pointed at the plastic tidying box in the middle of the yard and smiled.””Just now, director Xie had successfully bought a pair of blood red Dragons. There are only two pairs left! The shop owners who want it will have to put in more effort. Everyone, start bidding!”

This pair of blood red Dragons was two to three centimeters shorter than Xie Xun’s pair, so yang Dahua had bid four million Yuan at the beginning.

However, it was unrealistic to buy a pair of high – Quality blood red Dragons for four million, especially under the covetous eyes of these rich people.

The price quickly rose.

Even Xie Xun was eager to bid again. However, under the strong protest of yang Dahua and the others, Xia ruofei could only stand up and say that he had already bought the Blood Red Dragon and could not participate in the next round of bidding.

Only then did Xie Xun step to the side resentfully. He and Ling Xiaotian had completely become spectators.

Xia ruofei had also been secretly observing li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin. He realized that although they seemed to be bidding very actively, the increase in the bid each time was not very big. When the price rose to 5.5 million, the two of them decisively stopped bidding.

They don’t seem to want the two pairs of fish in front ... Xia ruofei made his own judgment.

Xu Desheng and yang Dahua were still bidding.

The price for the blood Dragon rose to 5.8 million.

In the end, it was yang Dahua, who had a stronger desire to buy them, who won the pair of Blood Dragons for six million.

In such a short time, Xia ruofei had earned 14.5 million Yuan, including the two million Yuan that yang Dahua had lost to him.

Even Xia ruofei was secretly shocked. The money came too quickly. He only paid attention to the red Arowana when they were laying eggs. After that, they were basically left in the boundless space. It could be said that there was no cost. It was only left for half a year and it was sold at such a sky – High price.

After all, there were still more than 60 Red Arowana of similar quality in the medium!

Of course, the market for high – end ornamental fish was limited, and Xia ruofei couldn’t sell so many at once. He could only release a few after a while.

Even so, Xia ruofei was still very satisfied with this amazing profit.

Yang Dahua also wrote a check for six million Yuan to Xia ruofei. Then, he picked up the plastic box and went to the side. He called his men to bring the fish tank over.

Xia ruofei glanced at li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin thoughtfully. Then, with a faint smile, he moved the last plastic box to the middle of the courtyard.

He smiled and said,”this is your last chance!” President li, President Xu, President Guo, you can make your bids!”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
