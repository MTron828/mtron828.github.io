?Chapter 1649: Take the initiative (1)

Xia ruofei and the others had their eyes on this piece of land. Of course, they could not just leave. Hence, after Liu haofan spoke, Xia ruofei stopped and reluctantly returned to his seat.

“Young master Liu, I’m giving you face.” Xia ruofei said,”actually, there’s nothing to discuss about the price that director Zhou has proposed.”

Liu haofan squeezed out a smile and said,””Thank you, President Xia. Well ... Tang real estate has their own considerations for offering such a price ...”

Song Rui couldn’t help but say,”we don’t know what the great Tang is thinking. We only know the market price in Xiaotang. Your land is only worth a little more than 300 million. You’re obviously not sincere by asking for 380 million!”

Zhou Tianyu smiled bitterly.”Young master Song, after all, we spent more than four hundred million to buy it. If the transfer price is too low, it will be hard to explain to the Board of Directors ...”

Song Rui pursed his lips.”That’s your problem. If you want to explain to the Board of Directors, you have to let the buyer be the sucker. I don’t think anyone will take over this land.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but give him a thumbs up. Although song Rui was sometimes impulsive and even spoke without thinking, his words were reasonable and hard to refute.

Xia ruofei said slowly,”young master Liu, general manager Zhou, I won’t hide it from you. We were quite optimistic about this land at first. We also participated in the bidding!” However, our budget is limited. We just heard that you suddenly wanted to transfer this land, so we came to ask about the market price. If you insist on this price, then we can only target elsewhere. ”

“There’s still some land near little Tang that needs to be sold,” Zhao Yongjun said.”We’re also looking into it.”

In other words, this land was not their only choice. In fact, there were many better options.

Zhou Tianyu sighed secretly. He knew that he was going to be ripped off today. Fortunately, the Board of Directors had given him a relatively low base price. He could only hope that Xia ruofei’s appetite was not too big. Even if he could sell it at the bottom line of the Board of Directors, he would be thankful.

Zhou Tianyu thought about it. “President Xia, how about this ... I will make the decision to give you another 30 million. We will sell this land at the price of 350 million!”

Xia ruofei looked at Liu haofan and shrugged.””Young master Liu, didn’t I say that there’s no need to talk? If you give in like how you squeeze out toothpaste, even if we talk to you tomorrow morning, there will still be a huge gap between you and our psychological price!”

Zhou Tianyu almost spat out a mouthful of blood. He wanted to reduce the price by 30 million. How was that even called squeezing toothpaste? one had to know that the land’s previous transaction price was only 400 million. That was equivalent to cutting it by 10%!

Liu haofan also felt a little depressed. He couldn’t help but ask,””President Xia, why don’t you tell us your psychological price? It’ll be good for old Zhou’s side to make a judgment. ”

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun looked at each other, then said,”” 250 million! This is the most we can offer!”

“What!” Zhou Tianyu couldn’t help but exclaim.

This time, it was he who had the urge to leave immediately. This haggling was too ruthless!

250 million was still 100 million less than the price he had just given in.

Moreover, when the land was auctioned in Pingchang District, the starting price was 250 million Yuan. However, everyone knew that the starting price was usually much lower than the actual value. Now that Xia ruofei and the others had called out this price, they were not just paying back the money on the spot, they were simply looting a burning house.

Liu haofan was also a little upset. He frowned slightly and said,””President Xia, your appetite is too big! This was almost a 50 – 50 bargain! We’re not buying vegetables at the market, nor are we buying clothes from a street stall in a wholesale mall! Isn’t this too insincere?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”didn’t I say that the price difference between us is too big?” You asked me to bid for it. If we weren’t sincere, we wouldn’t have made this trip!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Director Xia, it’s really hard for me to see any sincerity in your offer!” Liu haofan said angrily. The value of this piece of land is clear for all to see. You guys are taking advantage of the situation ...”

In fact, even Zhao Yongjun felt that Xia ruofei’s price was too low. They had agreed on a base price of 310 million last night. Although it was close to the actual value of the land, considering that the so – called haunted problem of the land would not affect Xia ruofei and the others at all, everyone felt that it was acceptable to get it at this price.

Of course, it would be better if they could lower the price.

However, Xia ruofei’s bid of 250 million seemed to be a little too low. The other party would definitely feel that there was too much of a difference and would not be able to continue the discussion.

What Zhao Yongjun didn’t expect was that Xia ruofei not only called out this price, but also said with certainty,””Young master Liu, I have to remind you that the price I offered is the bottom line in Hengrui corporation’s mind. In other words, there is no room for further negotiation!”

After Zhao Yongjun said that, even Liu haofan wanted to slap the table and leave.
