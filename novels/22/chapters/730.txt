Chapter 731: Young, rich, and good – looking (3)

The living room was connected to a large balcony, while the second bedroom had a relatively small balcony. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The entire house was located at the East End of the North – facing south. There was light on all three sides, and the whole house was very bright. There was no problem with the sun in the west at all.

If he bought this house, he could divide it into three bedrooms and a small study room. This way, Lin Qiao and Hu Zi’s mother would have their own bedrooms. There would also be a guest bedroom, which would be enough for relatives to use.

Xia ruofei nodded in his heart.

Then, he vaguely felt that the space above his head was very empty. He couldn’t help but raise his head to take a look, and his eyebrows subconsciously raised.

This house was much higher than the average commercial house, especially in the middle part of the house, which was basically two stories high.

Liang Weimin smiled and explained,”ruofei, this house is on the top floor. Above it is the slope of the building, so the highest floor is about 5.8 meters high. When it’s renovated, you can add a layer of cement board. This way, you can have a very good attic. Moreover, this extra floor is considered a gift and will not be counted into the transaction area. ”

“This is not bad!” Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.

As long as it was a building with a slope, this was the “benefit” of the penthouse residents. Most of the time, the top floor was a duplex structure. It was really cost – effective to have an extra attic in a flat – Level structure like this.

In fact, when the ‘world viewing’ opened for sale, all the units on the top floor of each unit with a slanted roof were sold out in a very short time.

If this apartment had not been reserved by the jianda group, it would not have been Xia ruofei’s turn to buy it now that the house was about to be handed over.

Although it was separated by a floor and could be considered a duplex structure, Xia ruofei still felt that this unit was very suitable.

The area of this apartment was much smaller than the two in Building No. 3. Besides, the attic was built on a slope, so many parts of it were very low. At most, it could only be transformed into an activity room or Lin Qiao’s boudoir. The main living space was still on the lower floor.

......

Therefore, after moving in, Hu Zi’s mother basically didn’t have to climb the stairs often.

The more Xia ruofei thought about it, the more he felt that it was suitable. He found out that unit 1802, which was reserved next door, did not have such a loft space as the top structure was not a slope but a flat top.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not hesitate and said,””Uncle Liang, I’ll take this unit 1801!”

Liang Weimin had already expected this. He smiled and said,”No problem! Ruofei, our grand Vision’s opening price is 25000. As the chairman of the company, the biggest discount I can give you is 20% off, so...Let’s deal at 20000 per square meter!”

The sales manager’s eyes lit up when he heard this. He looked at Xia ruofei with envy.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”no!” Uncle Liang, you’ve given me such a good reserved house. I can’t take advantage of your company anymore!”

It was true that the opening price of the grand vision was 25000, but that was the average price. For a top – tier apartment like this one, it would definitely be worth more than that.

Moreover, the market opened at the beginning of last year, which had been a year and a half. The new prices in this area were at least 30000 Yuan.

How could they use the opening price at the beginning of last year as the standard for buying a house now? Furthermore, Liang Weimin had even given Xia ruofei a 20% discount, which made Xia ruofei feel like he was taking advantage of him.
