“Ah?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but turn pale. She couldn’t help but cover her mouth and then asked with concern,”what happened after that?”

Xia ruofei said,”the situation was really bad at that time. The peach blossom miasma is a poison that invades the soul. Ordinary detoxification methods can’t cure it. I happened to have a spiritual medicine that can warm the soul. I gave it to Song Wei in time and the injury of her soul got better. At the same time, it temporarily suppressed the peach blossom miasma.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this point, Xia ruofei paused and looked at Ling Qingxue before he continued,””However, that method only treats the symptoms, not the root cause. Because the peach blossom miasma had already infected her sea of consciousness, my spiritual power cultivation at that time was not much stronger than yours now, so I had no ability to expel the poison. ”

“And then?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“You know, using spiritual force to penetrate into another person’s sea of consciousness and fighting the poison in her sea of consciousness is an extremely dangerous thing. A single mistake can cause her soul to suffer irreversible damage, and even become a true living Dead.” Xia ruofei said,”Song Wei was poisoned because she tried to help me. I tried my best to think of a way to save her.”

Ling Qingxue had a faint guess in her heart, but she didn’t say anything. She only listened quietly.

Xia ruofei continued,”so I thought of the ‘Scripture of the primordial heart’. I got this by chance. Its biggest feature is that during the cultivation process, it can make the soul Frequency of two people gradually synchronize. Under such circumstances, the risk of entering the other person’s sea of consciousness would naturally be much lower.”

“This means ... Song Wei has also cultivated this technique?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I couldn’t think of any other way at that time. It was almost like a life – saving straw!” Luckily, Song Wei’s talent for cultivation is not bad. Not long after she came into contact with this technique, she successfully completed the first step. ”

“Cultivation talent?” Ling Qingxue asked,”does cultivation require talent? RUO Fei, what about my talent? If I were to compare myself to Song Wei, who is more talented?”

Xia ruofei did not expect Ling Qingxue to interrupt him again when he was about to get to the most important point. He laughed bitterly in his heart, but he still explained patiently,””The path of cultivation is a heaven – defying one, and not everyone can cultivate it. Some people are born with poor physiques, and even if they have top – tier cultivation techniques, they may not be able to enter it even after a lifetime of hard work. As for your talent ...”

Xia ruofei hesitated for a moment.

“What’s wrong? RUO Fei, you can just tell me the truth. ” Ling Qingxue asked,”is it because my talent is too bad?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””That’s not necessarily true. If it’s now, your talent should be a little stronger than Song Wei’s ...”

Ling Qingxue understood the underlying meaning and immediately asked,””Now? Are you saying that my talent was very poor in the past? Could it be that one’s talent can be changed?”

Since Ling Qingxue had asked this question, Xia ruofei had no intention of hiding anything. He thought for a while and nodded.”Your innate talent is indeed not very good. It should be said that you are not suitable for cultivation. Normally speaking, a person’s talent is inborn, and it’s difficult to change it. But there are exceptions to everything ...”

He paused for a moment and continued,””Do you still remember how I gave you a lot of Chinese medicine before I officially taught you the” absolute beginning Scripture “? I said it was for you to recuperate. ”

“Of course I remember!” Ling Qingxue said,”that medicine is bitter ...”

“Do you know what the ingredients in the Chinese medicine are?” Xia ruofei asked again.

Ling Qingxue shook her head.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the main herb in there is called the heart concentrating grass. It’s a precious spiritual herb that has a great nourishing effect on the soul.” This spiritual herb is rare in the entire cultivation world. ”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but stick out her tongue and say,””It’s so precious!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Song Wei’s soul was injured, and she had to use the heart – concentrating grass to recover.” She used one of my heart – concentrating grasses, and you ... You used two of them even though you didn’t have any injuries to your soul ...”

“Heavens!” Ling Qingxue said,”isn’t this too wasteful?”

Even though she said that, she still felt a sense of sweetness in her heart because she could feel how much Xia ruofei cared about her. The more precious the heart – concentrating herb was, the more important she was to Xia ruofei.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei only gave Song Wei a stalk of heart – concentrating grass when her soul was injured. Obviously, he was treated much better.

Ling Qingxue was also very happy to see that it was even more precious now that there was a comparison.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingxue, after you consumed the two heart – concentrating herbs, your cultivation talent is already higher than Song Wei ‘s.” The more you have, the better. If you continue to take it, the effect will be very limited. In addition, I don’t have any more heart – concentrating grass on hand, so ...”

“RUO Fei, you’re already good enough to me ...” Ling Qingxue said, a little touched.”You don’t have to explain!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Let’s continue talking about Song Wei ... She’s quite talented in cultivation, and we soon began to practice the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” together. You know, the efficiency of practicing it alone is very low, and the original intention of me teaching Song Wei this cultivation method was to use the practice together to adjust the soul Frequency of the two to the same state at any time. This way, I can help her suppress the peach blossom miasma in her sea of consciousness. The peach blossom miasma will definitely be destroyed in the end. “
