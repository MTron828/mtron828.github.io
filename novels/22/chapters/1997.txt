1998 Urgent matter (2)

Yesterday, he Nigeria checked Turin’s situation on the internet and heard that the nihilians were very active here. It seemed like he had encountered a group of nihilians.

The leader of the group, a black young man, grinned and mumbled a bunch of words that Xia ruofei could not understand. However, from the looks of the group, it was obvious that they thought Xia ruofei was a fat sheep.

I don’t care anymore! They were all gangsters, so they should know a thing or two about the local mafia! Xia ruofei said in his heart.

Wasn’t there a saying? The people who understood you the most were often your competitors!

Turin’s nihila gang would definitely have conflicts of interest with the local mafia. Xia ruofei did not believe that these black kids would not know anything about the Gelman family.

The black man in the lead was about 27 or 28 years old. He was still wearing a tactical vest even in the cold Spring season, as if he was not afraid of the cold weather at all. His dark skin was shiny under the dim street lamp, and he had a classic black dreadtail on his head.

He saw Xia ruofei’s blank face, thought for a while, and made a money – counting gesture at Xia ruofei. He said in broken English,”“money! money!”

Many of these nihilias were refugees and their descendants. After they came to Europe, they gradually rooted themselves in various places in Europe. These black people generally had a low education level, and many of them were very lazy, so they quickly became a factor of social instability.

This small gang was made up of a group of people who had no skills and were unwilling to go out and find a job. The leader was called Banjita, and he had learned a few words of English.

Among their various “businesses,” their favorite was robbery, especially Asian tourists.

Based on their experience, Asian tourists were generally rich. As long as they succeeded once, they could have a good time for a few days.

Today, Xia ruofei had been targeted by them when he was wandering on the streets. They followed him all the way here and with Xia ruofei’s intentional cooperation, they finally seized the opportunity and blocked Xia ruofei in a dead end.

Xia ruofei looked at the group of black men with shining eyes and asked in English,””Which one of you can speak English?”

Banjita pointed at himself and said,”“me! you……Japanese?”

Xia ruofei was speechless. How could he say that he knew English with such poor vocabulary? Not to mention, he actually saw himself as a Wei nation citizen, what could he not tolerate? Which part of me looks like a Wei nation Japanese? Are you blind? You’re the F * cking Wei nation guy! Your whole family is Wei nation!

After complaining in his heart, Xia ruofei said seriously,”“NO! Chinese! you know?I am Chinese!”

Banjita’s smile became even brighter. In the dark alley, his white teeth looked a little scary.

“China … Is rich!” He said in broken English. Hand over all your money!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Banjita and asked,””Does anyone else know English?”

The group of black kids looked at each other, obviously not understanding Xia ruofei’s simple English sentence.

Seeing this, Banjita said impatiently,””Hey! I’ll say it again, take out all your money!”

Xia ruofei took a look and knew that the kid was probably the only one who knew a few words of English. Hence, he did not hesitate and went up to him.

Banjita and the rest were more experienced in street fighting. When they saw Xia ruofei moving, they immediately took a few steps back and took out their weapons. However, this motley crew did not have any standard equipment. Some took out a steel pipe, some took out a bicycle chain, and some even took out daggers. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Based on Banjita’s “professional experience,” there were very few tourists who dared to resist. Most of them immediately begged for mercy and begged them to only take money and leave their identification documents to him.

Xia ruofei’s actions had undoubtedly angered Banjita. He decided to teach this fat sheep of China a lesson.

However, Xia ruofei’s speed was completely out of Banjita’s expectations. Before he could even raise his sword, he felt his vision blur and Xia ruofei’s figure disappeared from his sight.

Then, Banjita heard a series of screams behind him. He turned around and saw that Xia ruofei had appeared behind him like a Wolf that had rushed into a flock of sheep. His strong – looking brothers were even more vulnerable than women in front of Xia ruofei.

They saw that the Chinese kid was moving through the crowd as if no one was there. With every punch, palm, and elbow, one of their brothers would fall to the ground screaming.

Those who were hit by Xia ruofei could only roll on the ground and wail. No one had the ability to stand up and fight again.

In less than 20 to 30 seconds, Banjita saw that all of the 20 people he had brought with him had fallen to the ground, groaning in pain.

In other words, this Chinese young man, who looked a little thin and weak, could defeat one person per second on average? Furthermore, it was a single blow that caused the other party to lose all combat ability!

Banjita felt like there were ten thousand F * ckers in his mind …

At this moment, Xia ruofei turned around and grinned at Banjita.

Clang!

Banjita’s hand trembled, and the knife fell to the ground.
