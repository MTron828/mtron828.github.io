In the afternoon, Xia ruofei brought Feng Rao to the Hunter Valley Garden at the foot of Brokeback Mountain.

To Xia ruofei, this was a revisit to an old place. Last time, he brought Lin Qiao here and happened to meet Lin Qiao’s high school classmate, tan Lili, which led to a series of events.

Of course, it was also because of that storm that Xia ruofei eventually took over the largest Golden Oak winery in the Hunter Valley area.

Now that he was back in Hunter Valley’s garden, the scenery was still as beautiful as ever. The theme parks were like a dream paradise. Xia ruofei could not help but sigh.

Time had changed, and the scenery here was still the same. However, those people from back then might have had their own paths in life.

Tan Lili, who had come to her senses and returned to the country to repeat her studies, should be at the most tense moment in preparing for the college entrance examination.

There was also tan Lili’s boyfriend, Zheng Peng, who had long since sold his assets and left Australia with his parents. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Robinson and Brody, father and son of the Golden Oak winery, would definitely not dare to stay in the Hunter Valley after selling the winery.

Of course, these people only had themselves to blame. Xia ruofei only felt a little emotional but did not sympathize with them.

It was Feng Rao’s first time at the Hunter Valley Garden. Just like Lin Qiao, she was deeply attracted by the theme park.

Snow White, Mickey Mouse Donald Duck, Cinderella ... Scenes from fairy tales were being played out in real life. Feng Jing couldn’t help but feel like a young girl and asked Xia ruofei to take a lot of photos for her.

The two of them had fun for half a day and returned to their home.

The next morning, they made an appointment to go to the West Winery.

The first batch of grape juice that had been brewed that day had already settled, and old West had organized the workers to pour the supernatant into oak barrels for fermentation.

After Xia ruofei asked Feng Jing, he found out that the fermentation of white wine required a very strict temperature. It had to be controlled between 18 and 20 degrees, or the aroma and taste of the wine would be greatly affected.

In addition, the whole fermentation process took about two to three weeks. In other words, the grape juice in the oak barrel had to be placed in a constant – Temperature warehouse for about 20 days before the main fermentation period was completed. After that, it might take another one or two weeks for the whole fermentation process to be completed.

By then, the grape juice would have already turned into wine, and the strong smell of wine could be smelled when the oak barrel was opened.

Of course, it would still have to be cultivated in oak barrels. At this stage, the dead yeast would settle at the bottom of the barrel after fermentation. The winemaking workers would mix the dead yeast with the wine at regular times to make the wine taste more mellow.

Finally, after a period of clarification and removing the dead yeast and grape crumbs in the wine, it could be bottled.

After hearing Old West’s introduction, Feng Rao was a little disappointed.””It’s going to take so long! It looks like we won’t be able to wait for the wine to be bottled ...”

It would take at least a month to complete the process. Feng Jing couldn’t possibly stay in Australia for so long without taking care of the company’s Affairs in China.

It was possible for Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”why don’t you just take a break?” I’ll give you a month’s leave, so you can come to uncle Wester’s place every day to learn how to make wine!”

“I don’t want to!” Feng Jing said,”since it’s impossible to complete it here in a short time, let’s hurry back to China!”

“How about ... I bring you here again in a month?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

For the past few days, Feng Jing had been participating in the entire brewing process. Xia ruofei could tell that Feng Jing was quite interested in it. Perhaps it was a way for her to relax!

“We’ll see ...”Feng Rao said after some hesitation.

It was obvious that she was moved. If it was in the past, Feng Jing would have rejected him without a second thought.

Xia ruofei looked at Old West again and asked curiously,””Uncle West, I heard you say that the wine will be bottled in about a month? Wasn’t wine supposed to be stored in oak barrels? Why are they bottled so early?”

Old West chuckled.”Xia, this is a specialty of the Semillon wine in the Hunter Valley area of Australia. It’s not ripened in an oak barrel but in a bottle!” The amazing thing is that when the Semillon in the bottle is ripe, it has a lively and fresh taste with a hint of lemon flavor when it’s young. After a period of time, it will develop a classic golden color and the taste will also become rich, such as toast, honey, grass, etc. ”

Xia ruofei kept nodding his head, feeling that he had gained a lot of knowledge.

He used to only know some basic knowledge about Semillon, but this time, after experiencing the wine – making process himself, he felt that there were many details worth paying attention to, and these were all valuable experiences passed down from generation to generation.

“Of course, oak barrels are still very important,” Old West said.”The fermentation and cultivation of the Semillon are all completed in oak barrels. During this process, the wood and grass scents of the oak barrel will blend into the wine, enriching the layers of the wine’s aroma. Therefore, good oak barrels are very important for wine brewing. ”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei asked,”what about our batch of oak barrels?”

“Not bad,” Old West laughed. Above average. “Of course, if it were the Semillon grapes from a few years ago, such an oak barrel would be enough. However, the quality of the grapes this year is extremely high. I originally wanted to find a better oak barrel, but it’s not easy to do so ...”
