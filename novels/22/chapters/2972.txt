After Li Yifu left, Luo Qingfeng looked at Xia ruofei with a serious expression and said,””Master, are you preparing to take action against the spirit Vulture mountain?”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,”if we were to add another item to the auction before the remnant of the spiritual Vulture mountain, would the fallen leaves sect have any problems with it?”

“Under normal circumstances, they would usually fulfill such a request.” Luo Qingfeng said,”but if ...”

“The item I submitted for auction is also the ‘true understanding of the glittering jewel array’. It’s the first and second volumes, two complete volumes.” Xia ruofei knew what Luo Qingfeng wanted to say, so he said directly,”will the falling leaves sect agree if we make it clear to them?” This might completely offend the spirit Vulture mountain. ”

Luo Qingfeng had already guessed that Xia ruofei might have some tricks up his sleeve to deal with the spirit Vulture mountain, but he did not expect Xia ruofei to take out the glittering jewel truth. Furthermore, the first two volumes were much better than the second volume of the spirit Vulture mountain. He had completely cut off the road to the spirit Vulture mountain!

Luo Qingfeng could not help but take a deep breath. Then, he quickly thought about it and said,””Master, this old servant should be able to do it!”

Xia ruofei naturally did not care what method Luo Qingfeng used. After all, time was of the essence.

He directly said,”alright!” The second thing I wanted to say just now was for you to carry it out! I need some time to prepare the contents of the first two volumes of the “glittering jewel true understanding.” Before I return, you have to keep an eye on the auction house. Furthermore, you must not let the lingjue mountain ‘s “glittering jewel true understanding” fragments be auctioned before us!”

With that, Xia ruofei took out a set of sound – proof enchantment talismans from the spirit map space and handed them to Luo Qingfeng.””If you really can’t do it, use this talisman to push it up first. You must drag it out a little longer! Although this set of talismans is only for sound – proof barriers, its quality is much better than most of the barrier talismans used by the sects. It should be qualified to be auctioned!”

Xia ruofei was prepared for both eventualities. If the auction progressed faster than expected and he had not copied the first two volumes of the glittering jewel Wonderland, he would have to throw out an item to stop the lingjue mountain’s remnant volume.

Of course, this talisman wasn’t very precious to Xia ruofei. He could easily make one. The only purpose of auctioning it was to buy time. He didn’t care how many spiritual stones he could sell it for.

Upon hearing this, Luo Qingfeng immediately put away the array talismans and said,””I understand! Master, this old servant will go find sect leader Shao Qingyang and persuade him ... Oh right, master, I wonder if this old servant can give the falling leaves sect a certain discount on the auction’s Commission?”

Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”you will represent me. 10%, 20%, or even 30% will do!” As long as we can stop the Ling Jue mountain, we don’t need to care too much about the spirit stones!”

“Yes! This old servant is much more confident!” “Don’t worry, master,” Luo Qingfeng said excitedly.”The cut is just a supplementary method. I’ll try my best to convince Shao Qingyang!”

“I believe you!” Xia ruofei patted Luo Qingfeng’s shoulder and said,”let’s not waste any time. Let’s split up!” If there’s any emergency, contact me directly through the phone!”

“Yes!” “Yes,” Luo Qingfeng replied solemnly.

Xia ruofei immediately put away all the barrier talismans in the private room and left the private room with Luo Qingfeng. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Luo Qingfeng went straight to the preparation area backstage to look for Shao Qingyang, while Xia ruofei quickly walked to the elevator. He wanted to make a last – minute copy of the glittering jewel Wonderland, so he naturally needed a relatively safe environment. For now, he could only choose a hotel room. With the time array flags and the time acceleration at the Archean realm, he had plenty of time to copy. The real time – consuming part was the time to go up and down the stairs.

Xia ruofei raced against time to take the elevator back to his room. Then, he took all kinds of preventive measures as fast as possible before taking out the spirit map scroll and entering the medium.

He immediately appeared beside the spirit pond at the Archean realm and set up time array flags.

Xia ruofei finally heaved a sigh of relief when he was in an environment where time was flowing 2000 times faster than normal. With a thought, he took out a pack of paper, a box of black gel pens, a table, a chair, and other items from the space. Then, he bent over the table and started to copy.

All the books in the Jade talisman of inheritance were directly imprinted into Xia ruofei’s mind, so he could be said to be familiar with it.

Not only did these ancient books contain complete content, but they also contained the cultivation experiences and insights of many predecessors. Xia ruofei only needed to understand these things a little. In fact, these experiences and insights were even more precious than the ancient books themselves.

Xia ruofei didn’t need to think or recall anything. He copied everything in his mind as if he was copying a book. Naturally, his speed was very fast.

Moreover, he had also deliberately copied down a few of the insights and experiences left behind by his predecessors. These were naturally quite precious, the kind that could enlighten people with a few words.

In this way, the value of these two hand – written copies would naturally be higher.

……

While Xia ruofei was writing furiously in the spirit map space, Luo Qingfeng had also successfully found the sect leader of the fallen leaves sect, Shao Qingyang.

Hao Qingsong was busy hosting the auction at the front desk, and as the sect leader, Shao Qingyang naturally didn’t stay idle either. He had been busy all this time at the back.

Luo Qingfeng found Shao Qingyang and pulled him to a secluded corner to talk. Shao Qingyang did not know whether to laugh or cry as he said,””Sect leader Luo, if there’s anything you want to say, just say it. All of the disciples here are elite disciples of my fallen leaves sect, and they are all very reliable.”
