Chapter 3528: An understatement !

When Shen Hu heard these words, it was as if a basin of cold water had been poured over his head. He was instantly scared silly.

“Young … Young sect master, I… I don’t know anything!” Shen Hu stuttered,”young sect leader, save me! Young sect leader, save me!”

“Hmph!” Chen Xuan snorted coldly and said,”do you know that you’re seeking your own death? Even though Xia ruofei didn’t join any sect, his strength and background are not to be underestimated by my father! Not to mention that even the sect master of the star Seizer sect follows his lead. You could have provoked anyone, but you provoked him!”

Shen Hu panicked and quickly said,”Young sect leader, 1 really didn’t know about this situation! And … And I’ve never thought of snatching this Paradise Club by force! 1 arranged for the new disciple to go back with him because 1 want to do it through merger and acquisition or shares. In short, it is done according to the rules of the secular world. Besides … This … It is not a crime for not knowing!”

“Not guilty for not knowing? You can tell this to brother ruofei!” Chen Xuan snorted coldly.”! don’t have the face to plead for you! What the hell is this!” “Don’t, don’t, don’t!” Shen Hu quickly said. Young sect leader, if you don’t care about us, I’m afraid that our water Yuan sect will really be doomed …”

“Shen Hu, you’d better think of a way to remedy this!” Chen Xuan said sternly. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not warning you when your sect is destroyed!”

After saying that, his tone eased a little and he said,””I’ll also ask brother RUO Fei and see what’s going on. You’d better pray that your men didn’t offend brother RUO Fei, or else you’ll be in deep trouble!”

Although Chen Xuan’s words were harsh, the water Yuan sect was still a vassal sect of the first heaven sect. If something really happened, the first heaven sect would definitely help them. Whether it would succeed or not was one thing, but if they didn’t do anything, it would only disappoint the other sects. It should be known that there were many vassal sects of the first heaven sect. If the water Yuan sect was really destroyed, the other vassal sects would also be in a state of mutual hostility.

“Yes, yes, yes! Thank you, young sect leader! Thank you, young sect leader!” Shen Hu hurriedly said,”I’ll immediately call for a Chartered plane to return to China and apologize to senior Xia!”

“You do as you see fit!” Chen Xuan said impatiently.

In his opinion, the water Yuan sect had caused him trouble, and it was the kind of trouble that was not easy to deal with. Thus, he naturally did not show Shen Hu any good attitude.

Capital University, by the unnamed lake.

Xia ruofei met up with Song Wei very quickly.

“Have you settled the matters here?” Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei and asked as he smiled.

Song Wei was also very happy to see Xia ruofei. She quickened her pace and walked in front of Xia ruofei. She smiled and said,”Yup! I’ve already told my mentor, so I’m going on my winter break in advance!”

“Not bad! Not bad!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”Weiwei, I still have something to deal with in the capital. As for you … Should 1 send you back to San Shan first?”

It would only take Xia ruofei 20 to 30 minutes to travel from the capital to the three mountains on his Black Phoenix flying boat. Hence, it was very convenient for him to send Song Wei off.

The reason why he had decided to stay in the capital at the last minute was to find an opportunity to speak up for song Rui and see if he could help him and Zhuo Yiyi, the two lovers. On the other hand, it was naturally because of Lu You’s matter. Xia ruofei had to at least make sure that Lu You was safe before he could return to the three mountains with a peace of mind.

Song Wei thought for a while and said,”then 1’11 stay with you!” It wasn’t winter vacation yet anyway! Normally, I’ll only be able to go home after a while.” “Then it’s decided!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go! How about we go back to the courtyard house?”

“You can just go back to the courtyard house.” Song Wei smiled and said,”! have a house in Beijing! Even if 1 don’t live in the dormitory, 1 don’t need to stay at your place!”

“Are you sure?” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Qingxue isn’t in the capital. We can cultivate the ‘absolute beginning Heart Sutra’ together! Do you really want to go home by yourself?”

The smile on Song Wei’s face froze. Then, she rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,””Now that you’ve said it, I really have to avoid suspicion! Fine! Let’s just go back to our own homes …”

After she finished speaking, Song Wei turned around and pretended to leave. Xia ruofei quickly grabbed Song Wei’s hand and said with a smile, “Don’t go!

Even if you don’t, you can still live in a courtyard house! Anyway, there were a lot of rooms there. After I’m done with my business here, 1 can return to the three mountains at any time, so it’s more convenient for you to stay with me!” “I’m just joking with you!”Song Wei laughed. Since you have such a strong request and a sincere invitation, then i will reluctantly live in the liuhai Lane courtyard house!”

“Then 1 should thank you for coming!” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Of course!” Song Wei said as she raised her chin.

“Oh right, why did you suddenly decide to stay in the capital?” Song Wei asked. What’s up? Of course, if it’s not convenient for you to tell me, then forget it. I’m just asking!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”what’s so inconvenient about that?” Speaking of which, this matter is more or less related to you …”

“Is it related to me?” Song Wei was even more curious.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the person involved is related to you!” According to seniority, song Rui is considered your uncle, right? And Zhuo Yiyi, she’s your classmate and best friend, right?”
