Chapter 202: Top – tier UTV_1

When he was in the Army, Xia ruofei had learned how to equip an all – terrain vehicle with an all – terrain vehicle. It was almost the standard equipment for Special Operations. The all – terrain vehicle could adapt to a variety of terrains and had high mobility, cross – country nature, reliability, and durability. Moreover, the military version had the ability to install various standard weapons. It could be said to be one of the most reliable partners of Special Forces on the battlefield. When the all – terrain vehicle flashed through Xia ruofei’s mind, he quickly decided to get one and store it in the medium. Needless to say, the all – terrain vehicle was very practical. For the sake of his military love, Xia ruofei also wanted to own a cool all – terrain vehicle. Although the all – terrain vehicle did not seem to be very useful for now, the new space would definitely continue to expand. Xia ruofei would continue to develop in the future as well. By then, it would be very important to have a powerful means of transportation. After making up his mind, Xia ruofei immediately left the spirit map space. He put away the spirit map scroll and sat in front of the computer to look up information. After checking, he realized that there were quite a few brands of all – terrain vehicles, and they were all selling well. In the past, they were called “beach cars” in China, mainly used for some seaside scenic spots to collect fees. Now, they were gradually being used in other fields. Xia ruofei searched for “Polaris” directly. This was a world – famous all – terrain vehicle brand. The military versions they produced were all directly supplied to the United States Army and were specially used to carry out the deceptive missions of the US Army around the world. Of course, the civilian version of Polaris was also of first – Class quality. Xia ruofei easily found Polaris ‘exclusive store in Sanshan city in the sales section. The next morning, Xia ruofei drove his Knight XV off – Road vehicle straight to the San Shan city. Qingshan District Huaxia Car City. Xia ruofei quickly found the Polaris all – terrain vehicle specialty store. This Knight XV had also earned a lot of attention in the car City. All the people here were in the car industry, so they knew more about cars than ordinary people. Everyone was wondering where this rich man came from, who even drove a Knight XV, and what car he wanted to buy. When Xia ruofei parked his car in front of the Polaris exclusive store, a pretty saleswoman’s eyes lit up and she quickly walked up to him. Anyone who could drive a Knight XV was definitely a tycoon! This kind of customer had to be served well. As soon as Xia ruofei opened the car door and jumped out, the salesgirl immediately greeted him warmly,””Hello, Sir. Welcome to the Polaris exclusive store!” “Hello, I’m here to take a look at the all – terrain vehicle.” Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. “Please follow me!” The female sales assistant quickly said,”Sir, Polaris is is one of the best all – terrain vehicle brands in the world, especially our Athlete Series. It is recognized as the world’s strongest ATV with a powerful electronic injection engine and the best shock absorption system. You will definitely be able to find a car to your satisfaction here!” “Oh? Take me to see it first!” Xia ruofei said indifferently. “Sir, this is the model of the athlete 1000. It uses a double – cylinder water – cooled four – Valve engine and has a displacement of 952CC ... This is the athlete 6X6, a six – Wheel all – terrain vehicle ...” The female salesperson’s business ability was obviously very strong. She blurted out the main parameters of each model of the car in the store without looking up any information at all. Moreover, she was able to point out the main selling points of each model. She was indeed a very Good Shopping Guide. However, Xia ruofei still felt that these all – terrain vehicles were not interesting. Compared to the military version he used to play in the Army, the difference was huge. The saleswoman could tell that Xia ruofei was not very interested, so she asked carefully,””Sir, these are all popular models. Are you satisfied with none of them?” Xia ruofei smiled.”The cars are not bad. But ... I like the more masculine ones.” “I understand. I can tell from the car you’re driving ...” The saleswoman said with a smile. Xia ruofei laughed.”That’s why I want to buy an all – terrain vehicle. It’s best if it has a domineering exterior. Of course, the stronger the performance, the better.” “I see ...” The saleswoman fell into deep thought. To be honest, the civilian all – terrain vehicles on the market all looked the same, and Polaris Lord was still playing the performance card. Suddenly, the saleswoman’s eyes lit up and she said,””Sir, we have a new UTV that might be able to meet your requirements. Please follow me!” The saleswoman led Xia ruofei to the other side of the exhibition hall. After they went around a pillar, Xia ruofei saw a four – seater all – terrain vehicle in khaki paint. His eyes lit up. At first sight, Xia ruofei felt a strong military vibe. The appearance was hard and powerful, with wide tires, high suspension, huge air intake, angular curves, and a thick frame. Everything was in line with the all – terrain vehicle in his mind. The saleswoman was good at reading people’s expressions. She knew that there was a chance when she saw Xia ruofei’s expression. She quickly introduced,””Sir, this UTV model is MRZR G. It looks exactly the same as the MRZR light all – terrain vehicle equipped by the Polaris Industries for the U.S. Military. Of course, the material and configuration of the civilian model are definitely different from the standard military model. At the same time, it also removes the standard weapon interface. However, it is definitely top – tier among all – terrain vehicles for civilian use.” The saleswoman pointed at the MRZR g all – terrain vehicle and continued,””Its entire weight is less than 4500 pounds, and it has the world’s top full – load extreme off – Road ability. It can move at extremely high speeds on all terrains. The cargo hold had an open design, which maximized the storage space and ensured the flexibility of the vehicle. In terms of power, it’s powered by a powerful LP8cots diesel engine ...” After listening to the sales lady’s introduction, Xia ruofei was even more determined to buy this car. The configuration was not much different from the military all – terrain off – Road vehicle he had used in the Army. It was definitely the first choice for military fans. “I’ll take this one!” Xia ruofei asked,”do you have any in stock?” The saleswoman quickly said,”yes, yes, sir. This Car model is the new model this year. Two of them just arrived the day before yesterday. In addition to this display car, there is a brand new one left in the warehouse. If you pay the full amount, you can take it away today.” Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”then the full price!” “Yes, sir!” The saleswoman was very happy.”The price of this model is 288800 Yuan. If there are no other problems, I will go through the purchase procedures for you.” This mrtrhood was definitely a high – end model among high – end models. Polaris ‘all – terrain vehicle series cost about 140000 to 150000 Yuan, and this car was almost double the price. The saleswoman didn’t expect her luck to be so good. She closed a big deal on her first day of work during the new year. The Commission of this deal was almost comparable to her base salary this month. Xia ruofei didn’t really care about the price. He smiled gently and said,””Alright, I’ll have to trouble you then ...” Just as the female sales assistant was about to get the bill, she suddenly thought of something. Her expression changed slightly and she said,””Right, Sir, there’s one more thing I have to remind you of ...” [PS] announcing the VIP Reader group number: 295848872, genuine readers are welcome to join the group (after joining the group, you need to verify the screenshot of the full subscription).
