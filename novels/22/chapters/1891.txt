“Hello?” Xia ruofei asked calmly.

“Boss, we’re ready. We’ll be in position this afternoon!” Xu Yougang said.

“So fast?” Xia ruofei was a little surprised.”Didn’t hu Zi say that you would need two to three days to prepare?”

“After the funds arrived yesterday, the brothers split up. I went out of town overnight to get the equipment back, and liangzi and the others modified the car overnight. We tested it today, and there’s no problem!” Xu Yougang said,”boss, we’ll start working this afternoon.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I can. ”

“Do you have any other instructions?” Xu Yougang asked.

Xia ruofei said,”no, you guys take care of it!” But there’s one thing you need to do, you must ensure your safety before doing anything. Otherwise, you’d rather give up. Anyway, I won’t give you a time limit, and I don’t have any other requirements. Just keep a close eye on the target and report to me if you find anything!”

“Understood!” Xu Yougang said,”boss, just wait for our news!”

After hanging up, Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up.

In the afternoon, Wu Liqian left San Shan. Xu Yougang and the others also began to keep an eye on Liu haojun. The show was just about to start.

If this was the second half, then Liu haojun was too arrogant in the first half and touched Xia ruofei’s bottom line. In the second half, Liu haojun was not in control.

……

At two in the afternoon, Xia ruofei drove to Sanshan airport alone.

Wu Liqian’s flight took off at 3:30 pm. Xia ruofei had plenty of time when he left, but he was stuck in a traffic jam on his way out of the city. He had to take a long detour, so he was a little late when he arrived at the airport. Fortunately, he was not too late. Wu Liqian had just sent Xia ruofei a WeChat message and she had just arrived at the airport.

When Xia ruofei parked the car, his eyes swept over an unremarkable van not far away. He could not help but frown.

Although the screen of the van was dark, Xia ruofei could still see Xu Yougang sitting in the van.

He didn’t get out of the car. Instead, he took out his Nokia phone and dialed Xu Yougang’s number.

“Boss!” Xu Yougang said calmly.

“What’s the situation? Why are you guys at the airport?” Xia ruofei asked, frowning.

Xu Yougang, who was in the van, was slightly shocked. He immediately looked around. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei said,”you don’t have to look. I’m in your Seveno’ clock direction. I just came to the airport to see off a friend.”

Xu Yougang was speechless. He did not expect Xia ruofei to have such a sharp eye. There were so many cars in the parking lot, and he did not report their license plates, models, and other information to Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei was able to discover him hiding in the car.

Xu Yougang had always heard from Lei Hu that Xia ruofei was very good in the Army. At first, Xu Yougang did not have a concept of it, but today, Xia ruofei had given him a very deep impression.

Xu You just woke up and quickly said,””Boss, we followed the target to the airport. Liangzi is in the lobby, I’ll stay in the car to support.”

“He’s at the airport?”Xia ruofei frowned and asked.

The first person that came to Xia ruofei’s mind was Wu Liqian. His eyes turned cold and he said,””I know. You guys follow the plan. I’ll go in first ...”

With that, Xia ruofei hung up the phone and kept it. He opened the car door and walked quickly to the departure hall of the airport.

Liu haojun was standing across from Wu Liqian, looking a little upset.

Wu Liqian’s face was frosty. She frowned and said,””Liu haojun, what are you trying to do?”

Liu haojun gritted his teeth.”Deputy Mayor Wu, it looks like I’ve underestimated you ... I didn’t expect you to have this ability. You can go to such a training class just like that ...”

Wu Liqian snorted coldly and ignored Liu haojun.

She had kept a low profile about her training. After receiving the notice, she only reported it to the leader. Then, she packed her luggage in the afternoon and asked the driver to drive her over.

He didn’t expect Liu haojun’s nose to be so sharp. Not only did he find out immediately, but he was also like a dog – Skin plaster that couldn’t be shaken off. He directly drove the car over.

“Do you think that I can’t do anything to you now that you’re in the capital?” Liu haojun sneered. You can’t be that na?ve, right? Don’t forget where I’m from! The capital is my base!”

“Liu haojun, what are you trying to do?” Wu Liqian glared at Liu haojun.”Do you still have the bearing of a leader? You’re just a hooligan!”

Liu haojun chuckled,”I’m a Rascal!” Wu Liqian, let me put it this way! None of the women that I, Liu haojun, have ever been able to escape from my grasp! You will be no exception ... Don’t worry, aren’t you going to Beijing for two months? I’ll make your life for the next two months quite exciting!”

Wu Liqian’s expression changed slightly. She now knew Liu haojun’s family background was terrifying. If Liu haojun was determined to make things difficult for her, she would not be able to live in peace even if she went to the capital.

Perhaps Liu haojun didn’t dare to go back to the capital, but his friends were all well – known figures in the circle of nouveau riches. How could he, a small leader at the bottom level, fight with them?
