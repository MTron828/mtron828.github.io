2587 There’s something fishy going on (1)

After Xia ruofei heard Liu Qunfeng’s words, his first reaction was that he was lying! Because in his opinion, this kind of thing was simply impossible.

Although old man Liu’s recovery was slow, everything was under Xia ruofei’s control. Under his intentional control, old man Liu’s condition was actually slowly getting better.

Before Xia ruofei left the capital, he had left behind enough pills. As long as the Liu family followed his instructions and gave elder Liu the medicine on time and in fixed quantities, there would be no accidents.

“Mr. Xia ... Mr. Xia ...” Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but call out anxiously when he didn’t hear Xia ruofei speak.

Xia ruofei finally came back to his senses and said,””Chief Liu, don’t worry. It’s impossible for such a thing to happen. Please describe elder Liu’s situation to me in detail.”

“Okay ... Actually, about six or seven days ago, my father felt a little uncomfortable, and his mental state was obviously much worse than before!” Liu Qunfeng said,”at first, we thought that the old man was getting old and weak, but his condition was getting worse and worse. He couldn’t get out of bed since the day before yesterday, and today ... He fell into a coma. The doctor said ... His condition might not be good! The tumor is also spreading ...”

Xia ruofei frowned and asked,””Did Mr. Liu take the pills I prepared on time?”

“We give him the medicine on time every day!” Liu Qunfeng said,”there’s someone in charge of this. There’s never been any delay!”

“Did you overconsume it?” Xia ruofei asked again.

In fact, there would not be any side effects even if they overtook it. The main ingredient to treat elder Liu’s illness was the petal of the spirit Heart Flower in the pill. Xia ruofei had only instructed them to take a fixed amount to control the speed of elder Liu’s recovery. In fact, even if they took a few more pills, it would only speed up the recovery and would not cause such a situation.

“Absolutely not!” “Mr. Xia,” Liu Qunfeng said.”We’ve been following your instructions strictly and giving the old man his medicine. Why would he appear now ...”

“Chief Liu, I also find it very strange.” Xia ruofei said,”how about this? I’ll immediately return to the capital. There are many things that I can only understand after seeing it with my own eyes ...”

“Good, good, good!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”Mr. Xia, please come over as soon as possible. Sorry to trouble you ... By the way, do you need me to arrange for a plane for you?”

Liu Qunfeng treated Xia ruofei as a life – saving straw. In fact, if Xia ruofei had not treated old master Liu’s illness, he would have been dead by now. Therefore, even though there was a relapse in the treatment process, he still did not dare to blame Xia ruofei.

Of course, it would be a different story if elder Liu couldn’t make it this time.

The “treatment fee” that Xia ruofei had offered was not cheap. Not only did he ask for the Liu family’s Pharmaceutical Group, but he had also reached a certain level of reconciliation with the song family. It could be said that he had made a huge concession.

If the treatment failed, the Liu family would definitely have to talk to Xia ruofei.

Of course, Xia ruofei was not afraid of the Liu family. It was just that he did not want to go against the Liu family if it was not necessary. Moreover, this matter was strange from the beginning to the end. Xia ruofei had to investigate it no matter what.

This incident was most likely caused by other factors, and Xia ruofei did not want to be the scapegoat.

“There’s no need for that!” Xia ruofei said,”I have a public jet here, and I also have an emergency channel to apply for a flight route. I can reach the capital city in three hours at most!”

“That’s good! That’s good!” “I’ll arrange for someone to pick you up at the airport!” Liu Qunfeng said.

Xia ruofei did not reject this arrangement. He nodded and said,””Alright, then I’ll have to trouble you,”

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei immediately called Captain Liu An and asked him to apply for a flight route from the three mountains to the capital city. He asked for the plane to take off as soon as possible.

It was much easier to apply for a domestic flight route. Hence, Liu An told Xia ruofei confidently to head to the airport now. When he arrived at the airport, the flight route should have been approved.

After the call, Xia ruofei called the logistics department and asked for a car. After all, he did not know how long he would be in the capital. If he drove to the airport by himself, he would have to leave his car in the airport’s parking lot.

Then, Xia ruofei called Feng Rao and Ling Qingxue. He did not tell them what it was about, but he told them that he had something urgent to deal with in the capital and had to go there immediately.

Feng Jing was already used to Xia ruofei ‘s’ sudden disappearance ‘, so she didn’t complain much. Instead, she generously expressed that she would look after the company and let Xia ruofei go to the capital without worry.

On the other hand, Ling Qingxue was a little reluctant to part with Xia ruofei after a short meeting. However, she did not ask much and even joked that Xia ruofei should spend more time with Song Wei in the capital.

After making the call, Xia ruofei got up and took out a small suitcase from the lounge. He took a few clothes from the space and stuffed them in. Then, he dragged the suitcase downstairs.

The company had sent a black Mercedes – Benz car to wait at the entrance of the building. The veteran who was in charge of driving took Xia ruofei’s luggage and quickly loaded it into the trunk. He then jogged to the driver’s side, opened the door, and sat in. Soon, the Mercedes – Benz slid out steadily and sped in the direction of the airport. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

……

Two and a half hours later, Xia ruofei’s private jet landed steadily on the runway of the Beijing International Airport.

As Xia ruofei dragged his small suitcase out of the airport building, an old man in a black Chinese tunic suit came up to him and bowed slightly.””Good day, Mr. Xia!”

Xia ruofei immediately recognized the old man in front of him. His name was Liu Kuan, the head butler of the Liu family. He had been by old master Liu’s side for decades and was the old master’s most trusted person. Although they were not blood – related, they were like family.

“Hello, uncle Liu!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Mr. Xia, you’ve had a long journey!” Liu Kuan said respectfully,”the car is ready. This way please!”

Liu Kuan’s chauffeur had already taken Xia ruofei’s luggage, and soon Xia ruofei got into a Mercedes – Benz business car sent by the Liu family.

“Where’s elder Liu now?” Xia ruofei asked casually from the middle seat.

“The old master is still in the original house.” Liu Kuan, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, turned around and said,”the medical facilities there are quite complete, and 301 Hospital has sent several experts there.”

Liu Qunfeng had also considered the inconvenience of having Xia ruofei treat old master Liu in the hospital. So, even though old master Liu had fallen into a coma, he had decided to let him stay in the house after consulting the experts.

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,””Uncle Liu, has there been anything unusual about elder Liu’s health these days?”

Liu Kuan had been taking care of old man Liu every day, so he should know the situation best. Although Xia ruofei had not seen the patient yet, she decided to ask about the situation first.

Liu Kuan thought for a moment and said,”Mr. Xia, I ... Didn’t notice anything unusual. Master’s life is very regular every day. He doesn’t go out these days. He takes his medicine on time every day.”

“Then where did he put his medicine? Is there anyone else who can come into contact with it?” Xia ruofei asked immediately.

“The pills you’ve provided are all stored outside master’s room. Because the pills need to be stored in cold storage, we specially set up a refrigerator in the outer room. Of course, we were afraid of disturbing the master’s rest, so we put the refrigerator in the outer room, but there are people guarding it 24 hours a day, so no one should have the chance to come into contact with these pills. ” “Mr. Xia, do you suspect that someone has tampered with the pills?” Liu Kuan asked.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I haven’t seen elder Liu yet. I don’t know what’s going on with his body. It’s too early to make a conclusion.” However, in theory, this possibility could not be ruled out! And the measures you mentioned seem to be strict, but there are actually loopholes. For example ... Someone bribed the person responsible for guarding the refrigerator and asked him to add something to the pills ... As long as the price is high enough, it’s hard to guarantee that no one will be tempted!”

Then, Xia ruofei changed the topic and said with a smile,””Of course, this is just my guess. It can’t be accurate.”

Then, Xia ruofei asked,”do many people usually come into contact with elder Liu?”

Liu Kuan understood Xia ruofei’s meaning. He said as he tried to recall,””The doctors, nurses, some family members, bodyguards, and housekeepers ... There are quite a lot of people who can come into contact with the old master every day, but these people are absolutely reliable. Any one of them will be under strict surveillance when they appear in front of the old master, so it’s unlikely that anything will happen to them.”

Xia ruofei smiled and did not argue with Liu Kuan about whether these people were “absolutely reliable”.

After asking Liu Kuan a few questions, Xia ruofei leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes to rest. Liu Kuan turned around and looked ahead. He seemed to be deep in thought.

An hour later, Xia ruofei’s Mercedes – Benz arrived at old master Liu’s house.

The moment Xia ruofei got out of the car, he saw a worried – looking Liu Qunfeng walking up to him.

Without waiting for Liu qun to speak, Xia ruofei said,””Chief Liu, let’s skip the small talk. Take me to see what’s going on with elder Liu right now!”

...

Liu Qunfeng’s eyes showed a trace of gratitude. Although they were on different sides, Xia ruofei still did his best to treat old man Liu after receiving the high “treatment fee”.

Xia ruofei had immediately arranged for a public jet to rush to the capital city as fast as possible when he heard the news. The Liu family had to appreciate this.

“Alright! The old man is on the second floor!” “Mr. Xia, this way please,” Liu Qunfeng said.
