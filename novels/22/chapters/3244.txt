Xia ruofei’s requests gave Elon Musk the feeling that they wanted to set up a space transportation company, and that their business was bigger than SpaceX.

They were just short of proposing to buy their Falcon rockets. Otherwise, they would have just acquired SpaceX.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Mr. Mask...Don’t be impatient ... You can understand that we want to do a space survival experiment. We want to simulate the real environment as much as possible!” Of course, we don’t need a complete Dragon Ship, at least it doesn’t need a power system, uh ... Communication and control system is not really needed. What we need the most is the cabin of the ship. Of course, this needs a cabin that can operate stably in space, and it needs to be able to provide oxygen continuously. ”

If he were to use the Dragon Ship, he would naturally just drag it along the back of the black Phoenix flying ship. There was no need for a propulsion system.

Not to mention that the Dragon ship’s power was mainly to make fine adjustments to the orbit in space, as well as some adjustments to the orbit and speed during the process of returning to Earth. It was definitely not enough to support the flight to the moon.

“Your request is really beyond my expectations ... But according to what you just said, the Dragon Ship can’t fit nine people.” Our ship’s design can carry up to seven people, and under normal circumstances, we won’t fly with full capacity. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there are many systems on the spaceship that we don’t need. After dismantling them, we should be able to add some space, right?” Moreover, we don’t need to carry any supplies or items. I think this will increase the space! Of course, considering the comfort level ... If your company can sell us two spaceships, that would be the best!”

Elon Mask was so scared that he shivered and quickly said,””Mr. Xia, the construction of the Dragon Ship is also very complicated. Even though many systems have been reduced, it still involves a lot of work ...”

“This is an additional option. We can discuss it later.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”however, we still hope that Mr. Masker can help us solve the problem of the EVA suit and the oxygen supply module. Of course, Mr. Masker, you don’t have to worry about the cost. We can pay you in full in advance. ”

To put it bluntly, what Xia ruofei lacked was not money, but technology and production ability. All of these were in the hands of Elon Musk. As long as the funds were in place, it should not be a big problem for him to operate.

Elon Musk smiled bitterly. He took a deep breath and said,””Mr. Xia, since we’ve already made things clear, I won’t beat around the bush! This matter could be done! But you need to give me some time ... I’ll find a way to contact the relevant production companies through some personal connections to produce the parts, and then I’ll secretly form a team to assemble and test them. But ...”

Xia ruofei’s eyes revealed a trace of joy. He smiled and said,”What other problems do you have, Mr. Musk? just tell us, we can solve them together!”

Elonmask laughed and said,””If Mr. Li can provide the required funds in advance, there won’t be any major difficulties. However, there are some things that I have to make clear to you in advance. ”

“Please speak!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I’ll use some means to avoid the related risks, so if there’s any problem, it’s impossible to trace it back to me and my company. Even if Mr. Xia and the rest of you testify, I’ll never admit to it.” Elon Musk said seriously,”so, the risks that may exist in this matter will have to be borne by you. Please think carefully, this is not a small matter.”

Hearing this, Xia ruofei’s heart relaxed slightly. He smiled and said,””So this is what Mr. Masker was talking about! Please rest assured, there will be no problems. Even if there is a problem, it will not involve Mr. Masker. We are friends who help each other, and we will not betray our friends!”

In fact, to Xia ruofei and Li Yifu, the most likely problem would be on the side of Elon Musk.

As long as Elon Musk delivered the goods normally, Xia ruofei and the others would put the things into the storage artifact and leave the United States on the flying boat. No matter how powerful the FBI was, they wouldn’t be able to find any clues.

When elonmask heard this, he nodded and said,””Then this matter is decided for the time being. I’ll provide you with as many spacesuits and oxygen supply modules as possible to meet Mr. Xia’s needs! But ...”

At this point, elonmax shrugged and said,””Please forgive me for not being able to sign any agreement on paper with you, and I need Mr. Li to transfer the required funds to an account I specify in advance. This may require a little trust ...”

“No problem at all!” Li Yifu said without hesitation,”I can pay 600 million US dollars first. If the funds are not enough later on, I can add more at any time!”

When Li Yifu was still on Peach Blossom Island, he had already started to prepare the funds when Xia ruofei had just told him about the purchase of the spacesuit. Most of Li Yifu’s businesses were industrial, so he had plenty of cash flow. It was basically not a problem to raise up two billion US dollars in a short time.
