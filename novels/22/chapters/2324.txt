2325 The omnipotent God_The reason why he had chosen to commit suicide was because he knew that if he fell into the enemy’s hands; he would suffer if he didn’t confess. And if they sold out the organization’s information, then no matter where they ran to, it would be difficult to escape the organization’s revenge. This kind of revenge was a hundred times more terrible than death.

As for Bao Guijun and the rest, they had already revealed all the secrets of the modr organization. In fact, they had already betrayed the organization, so why would they be so silly as to sacrifice themselves in the line of duty?

Moreover, they all thought that working for Xia ruofei would ensure their safety. In this secluded place, the chances of being found by the mord organization were very low.

Even if they lost their freedom, being able to live on was a huge temptation.

Of course, they didn’t know that Xia ruofei’s terrifying power was only limited to the space. Even though he was strong in the outside world, he would still need to cultivate for a long time before he could reach the level that he had just reached. He could create a huge wave with a thought.

After exchanging glances, Bao Guijun quickly said,”Mr. Xia, we’re willing to work for you! Thank you for sparing my life, Mr. Xia!”

“You’re very tactful!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”actually, the job I want you to do is not complicated. I believe you can do it ... Yes! Let the person in charge of you tell us!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei sent a telepathic message to Xia Qing,””Xia Qing, come to my place!”

“Yes, master!” Before Xia Qing’s voice could finish, he had already appeared beside Xia ruofei.

Bao Guijun, Qian guiyou, and the others were shocked.

It was teleportation again! It seemed that this person was also a very powerful character!

“This will be your supervisor from now on. You can call him supervisor Xia Qing,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Bao Guijun and the others quickly greeted him,”Manager Xia Qing!”

Xia Qing was absolutely loyal to Xia ruofei. Since it was Xia ruofei’s arrangement, he naturally had no objection. Thus, he nodded to Bao Guijun and the others.

Xia ruofei said to Xia Qing,”these people will be under your command in the future. You can arrange some jobs that are not very technical but consume more physical strength for them to do.”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said respectfully.

“You can tell them the specific work arrangements!” Xia ruofei said.

Xia Qing pondered for a moment and said,”at present, the most important task is to open up the herb garden. During this time, you will mainly be doing this work. I will arrange the specific things for you!” In the future, after the expansion of the medicine garden is completed, we’ll adjust the new work. ”

Ever since he had acquired miles Corporation, Xia ruofei had arranged for Xia Qing to expand the scale of the herb garden as soon as possible. After acquiring miles Corporation, Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory’s demand for raw materials and herbs would increase by several times. It was impossible to meet the demand by just relying on centralized purchasing and farming contracts.

It would be a huge project to expand the herb garden several times, even if Xia Qing didn’t sleep or rest. Most of the work would be repetitive physical labor, which was suitable for Bao Guijun, Qian guiyou, and others.

“Understood, manager Xia Qing!” Bao Guijun and the others responded.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”Xia Qing will give you a quantitative evaluation based on your work performance. The higher the score, the better your life treatment.” If their performance was average, they would only receive the minimum living supplies. If you’re just wasting time or deliberately causing damage, I don’t mind throwing you into the sea to feed the Sharks. ”

Xia ruofei’s tone was very indifferent. Bao Guijun and the rest had no doubt that if they had any evil thoughts, Xia ruofei would immediately destroy them without hesitation.

In their eyes, Xia ruofei was an omnipotent God. In fact, in the spirit map space, such an evaluation was not too exaggerated. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare ...” Bao Guijun and the others quickly said.

Xia ruofei’s tone softened a little and said,””In here, other than not having freedom, it’s much better than being a mercenary. This was the Paradise of the immortals. Even if you didn’t do anything, you would become very healthy just by staying here. If you stayed here for a long time, you would definitely live a long life! So, before you have any bad plans, you’d better weigh the pros and cons. ”

Out of the five, Bao Guijun was from Huaxia. He was the first to react. Wasn’t this the legendary heavenly paradise? No wonder the air here was so fresh. Taking a deep breath felt like one’s bones had relaxed a few taels, and there was an indescribable feeling of carefreeness in one’s body.

These people had chosen to become mercenaries, and they basically didn’t have any family to worry about. Other than the lack of freedom and entertainment, it was quite good in comparison.

At the very least, they could live, and they could live very healthily. This had long been an extravagant hope when they stepped on that bloody road.

So, Bao Guijun immediately said,”Mr. Xia, thank you for your reminder. We will not dare to have any disloyal thoughts. From now on, we will work for you with all our hearts!”

Xia ruofei smiled faintly and said,”I don’t mind if you have other thoughts as long as you don’t put them into action.” Don’t blame me for not reminding you, Xia Qing’s ability is on par with mine. He can know your every word and action with just a thought. No matter how far you run, he can bring you back with just a thought! So ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t finish his sentence, but his meaning was clear.

“Yes, yes, yes ...” Bao Guijun and the others quickly nodded.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and set up a soundproof barrier around himself and Xia Qing. Then, he said,””Xia Qing, these people in the outside world deserve to die. I have no intention of letting them out since I’ve captured them. If they dare to play any tricks, you can just kill them directly. We only need to ensure that the precious crops in the space can not be touched or destroyed by them, and that’s enough. ”

“Understood, master!” Xia Qing said.

“Alright, you can bring them to work! You have to keep a close eye at the beginning!” Xia ruofei said,”also, you have to keep an eye on the cultivation of the heart – concentrating grass. Don’t let anything go wrong!”

The heart – concentrating grass was grown in an environment where time was 2000 times faster. If any problems were not discovered and dealt with in time, the consequences could be very serious.

If it was just Jade and spiritual crystals, Xia ruofei could afford to lose them. However, he only had one heart – concentrating grass. If he lost the heart – concentrating grass, he would not be able to get back the spiritual crystals no matter how many he had. Hence, he had to be very careful.

“Yes, Master. Don’t worry!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei removed the wizardry barrier and warned Bao Guijun and the others before handing them over to Xia Qing. He asked him to bring Bao Guijun and the others to work at the herb garden.

With a thought, Xia ruofei left the medium.

He saw that it was getting late, so he went downstairs to cook some noodles for himself.

After dinner, Xia ruofei drove out.

When he came back, there was a small truck behind his Knight XV off – Road vehicle, and the trunk of the off – Road vehicle was full.

On the small truck were the iron – Framed bunk beds that he had purchased from a nearby furniture store. They were the cheapest kind, with a total of three and six bunk beds.

In addition, he also went to a small supermarket and bought five sets of bed sheets, blankets, pillows, and the like. They were all very ordinary, but they were cheap.

In addition, he also bought a batch of instant noodles, mineral water, and other daily necessities, which were all stuffed in the trunk of the Knight XV.

Xia ruofei asked the workers to unload the iron – Framed bed in the living room of the villa and let them leave.

The iron frame bed was packed in boxes. It was originally installed by the workers, but Xia ruofei did not need this service.

With a thought, he stored the iron frame bed and all the living supplies into the spirit map space.

Then, he went upstairs to his bedroom, locked the door and windows, took out the spirit map scroll from his body, and returned to the medium.
