2266 The ambitious and ruthless past his Prime (2)

Xia ruofei didn’t avoid his gaze and met it.

Xia ruofei could see that the skinny old man in the patient’s garb had a sickly sallow face. His white hair was very sparse. No matter how he looked at it, he was an ordinary old man who was beyond cure and could be blown away by a gust of wind.

However, even though he was already old, his eyes still had a sharp glint. His turbid eyes emitted a sharp light, as if he could see through people’s hearts.

Their eyes met, and a smile gradually appeared on the old man’s face. He said weakly,””Mr. Xia, please sit.”

Xia ruofei smiled and walked to the bed with steady steps. He bowed slightly and said,””Hello, elder Liu!”

Then, he sat down on the stool beside the bed and looked at Mr. Liu, who was lying on the bed.

The sharp look in elder Liu’s eyes disappeared. He sized Xia ruofei up with a smile and asked,””I heard you want to meet me alone?”

Xia ruofei said in a neither humble nor arrogant manner,”elder Liu has made great military achievements. As a former soldier, I admire elder Liu very much. It’s just that I’ve never had the chance to meet him. I’m taking this opportunity to fulfill my long – cherished wish.”

Elder Liu showed a self – deprecating smile and said,””He was once a Tiger General, but now he can’t get on a horse, can’t hold a gun, and even walking is difficult!”

Then, elder Liu looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Sometimes, I really envy old song for being able to get to know such an amazing person like you ... In fact, my children and juniors also have different opinions about my treatment. Some of them see you as a life – saving straw and insist on doing their best to invite you to treat me;”There are also some people who think that it’s just a rumor without any scientific basis. They hope that I can go abroad for treatment so that my old bones can struggle on at death’s door for a while longer ...”

Perhaps it was because he said too much in one breath, but elder Liu’s breathing became a little rushed. He took a few deep breaths and continued,””From the moment you entered the door, I firmly believed that if there was anyone in this world who could cure my illness, it would be you!”

Xia ruofei replied indifferently,”elder Liu, you’re flattering me. I’m only slightly familiar with medicine. I’m not so arrogant as to be able to cure any illness.” There are some illnesses that even I can’t help with. ”

Elder Liu smiled noncommittally and asked,””Then am I a fated person?”

What was interesting was that he did not ask if his illness was considered “undying disease”, but directly asked if he was “fated person”. It was obvious that he had already decided that as long as Xia ruofei was willing to help, he would not die.

And whether Xia ruofei was willing to treat him would naturally depend on whether he was ‘fated’.

Xia ruofei revealed a thoughtful expression.

Elder Liu took it all in, but he was not in a hurry to get an answer. Instead, he said casually,””Old song and I can be considered old comrades. We’re about the same age, but he joined the Army earlier than me ... That year, when we attacked Pingchuan County, my regimental unit was responsible for covering the flanks, while old song and old Gao’s regimental unit was the main attack unit. The three of us once served in the same company. After the battle ended, I only found out that old song was shot here ...”

Elder Liu pointed to his chest and continued,””And it was a large – caliber machine gun bullet. It even formed a penetrating wound and he went into shock on the spot. It was old Gao who carried him down. Everyone thought he wouldn’t survive, but when they went to the field hospital for a check, they found that his major internal organs were not injured. Of course, even so, his situation was still very dangerous because such a big wound could easily get infected, and he had lost a lot of blood from the front line. Therefore ... After the operation, he was in a coma for a full six days before his life was finally saved. Do you think ... This old man’s life is tough enough?”

Xia ruofei was enjoying the story. He had heard elder song mention it before, but he had not gone into such detail.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”Grandpa song is quite lucky.”

Elder Liu’s eyes lit up when he heard Xia ruofei address him as ‘Grandpa song’. He then smiled and said,””After recuperating for a few months, this old fellow actually recovered and was able to jump around energetically. This battle also allowed him to earn a first – Class merit, and not long after, he was transferred to our group. “Later on, he became the Chief of Staff and I became the Deputy regimental commander. From then on, the two of us were constantly competing ...”

Xia ruofei listened quietly and did not disturb the old man’s reminiscence.

Elder Liu continued,”after that, he became the regiment commander while I lost the competition and went to be the political commissar of another Regiment ... In the decades that followed, we often crossed paths in our work. It could be said that we had been fighting for most of our lives! I didn’t expect that this old man would still be alive and well, while I ... Am beyond cure ...”

At this point, elder Liu couldn’t help but sigh. Seeing that Xia ruofei didn’t say anything, he suddenly asked,””Xiao Xia, do you know what old song’s biggest problem is?”

“What?” Xia ruofei asked subconsciously.

“He’s too upright!”Mr. Liu said with a smile.

“Chief, I don’t think that’s a problem,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“It’s easy to break if it’s just over!” Elder Liu said,”elder song has always been like this. He can’t tolerate any mishaps! Otherwise, with his ability, he might be able to reach even higher heights! It was also because of his bad temper that he had made many enemies in his life. House song is like the sun in the sky now, but there are a lot of forces watching them. If old song falls, house song will be in a much more difficult situation than house Liu without me!”

“Elder Liu, what you’ve just said doesn’t seem to have anything to do with me ...” Xia ruofei asked.

“How can it not be related?” Old Liu laughed and said,”I heard from Qunfeng that this old man even sent himself in the car and his head of security to personally send you here. What was he trying to do? Are you trying to show off to me?”

“You’re mistaken. ” Xia ruofei said,”Grandpa song is just more concerned about me ...”

Elder Liu waved his hand and said,”little Xia, I know this old man too well. I know how many worms he has in his stomach.” However, it was no wonder that he was so proud. I heard that this guy was getting younger and younger as he lived, while I was lying in bed waiting for death. So in the battle between us, he won in the end. The longer he lives, the greater victory!”

Elder Liu shook his head with a self – deprecating smile.

He continued,”little Xia, old song’s care for you is already on the surface. I’m sure all the big and small families and forces in Beijing are aware of this.” In the eyes of outsiders, you, old song, and the entire song family are one. In that case, the enemies of the song family ... I’m afraid they also ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Elder Liu, I’ve always been an upright and honest person, doing business in an honest and upright manner, and never getting involved in these family disputes.”

“We can’t help ourselves in the martial world!” Elder Liu said meaningfully,”it’s not that you don’t do a lot of things, and trouble won’t come to you ...” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Speaking of this, a smile appeared on elder Liu’s face as he said,””That’s all I have to say. You can slowly experience it when you go back. I also have a suggestion ... House Liu’s gratitude towards our Savior is no less than house song ‘s. As long as you’re willing to treat me, house Liu will also be your strong support. I’m sure no force will dare to act rashly against you when that time comes ...”

Xia ruofei had already guessed elder Liu’s intention, so he was not surprised. He smiled and said,””Elder Liu, Grandpa song’s concern for me is not out of selfishness or an exchange of interests. Moreover, I’ve said it before ... I don’t need the protection of any power, so ... Your proposal doesn’t appeal to me at all. “
