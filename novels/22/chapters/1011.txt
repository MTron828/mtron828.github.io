Private planes were all accessed from this passageway.

Sure enough, not long after Xia ruofei’s car stopped, he saw a group of people walking out with Tang He.

Tang He was wearing a white silk Tang suit. His silver hair made him look energetic and vigorous. He walked with vigor and vigor, not like an old man at all.

Xia ruofei greeted Song Wei and the other woman. Then, he immediately opened the car door and got out of the car. He went up to them.

Tang He also saw Xia ruofei from a distance. With a warm smile on his face, he strode towards him.

“You look great, old Mr. Tang!” Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.

“Hahaha! RUO Fei, we meet again!”

Tang He shook hands with Xia ruofei and then asked,””Have you prepared the Phoebe zhennan wood?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”The timber is ready. But I thought you would arrive tomorrow. I don’t know how the preparation for the warehouse is going.” Why don’t you go to the hotel first, and I’ll go to confirm the wood. I’ll call you when I’m done. ”

“Okay, okay, thank you for your hard work!” Tang He nodded.

In fact, the two logs of wood were still lying in the spirit map space! Xia ruofei was worried that Tang He would suggest to look at the materials directly, so he said that.

Fortunately, Tang He did not doubt it and agreed to Xia ruofei’s proposal.

“By the way, Mr. Tang, it must be dark by the time we get back to the city. Are you sure you want to look at the wood all night?” Xia ruofei asked.

After all, the lighting at night was not very good, so under normal circumstances, such precious wood would definitely not be stored at night.

“I can see it tomorrow ... But I can’t wait to see it, haha!” Tang He said after some thought.

Xia ruofei quickly said,”tomorrow morning then!” You’ve had a hard journey. Take a good rest when you get back to the hotel. I’ll also need to make some arrangements for the warehouse. ”

“Alright! I’ll listen to you!” Tang He said with a smile,”take my car back! Let’s have a good chat on the way ...”

Xia ruofei’s expression changed and he said, embarrassed,””Mr. Tang, I have two friends who came to see you off. They’re in my car! Do you want me to visit you at the hotel after I’ve made the arrangements?”

Tang He laughed heartily and said,”sure!” Then, ruofei, you can go ahead with your work! We’ll talk again tonight!”

So, Xia ruofei and Tang He stood by the roadside and talked for a while. After he sent Tang He to his car, he returned to his own.

Xia ruofei started the car again. Song Rui, who was sitting in the back seat, looked forward and asked curiously,””Why does that old man look so familiar?”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””He’s one of the top 500 richest people in the world, don’t call him an old man. ”

“World’s top 500?” Song Rui couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

In China, the world’s top 500 companies could be counted on one’s fingers, and the bosses of these companies were all rich people with more than 10 billion Yuan in assets.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you know the United States shengbang group, right?” The old man you’re talking about is the founder and chairman of shengbang group, Mr. Tang He!”

“I’ll go!” Song Rui couldn’t help but swear.”Shengbang group is ranked very high among the top 500 companies! You actually have business dealings with Tang He?”

Song Wei smiled and added,”and it seems like they have a good relationship!” Student ruofei, you’re amazing!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s nothing much. It’s just a coincidence that I’ve had some interactions with Mr. Tang.”

Along the way, song Rui kept asking and Xia ruofei could only tell him about his relationship with shengbang group.

Of course, he did not mention anything about the Phoebe zhennan wood. He only said that his farm in Australia was developed in cooperation with Tang He.

Even so, song Rui and Song Wei were already very surprised and envious.

Song Rui was now working in his family’s business, so he was well aware of the terrifying financial power of shengbang group.

Song Rui had known Xia ruofei since the beginning of the Paradise Corporation. He had watched the company grow.

Now that paradise Corporation could actually cooperate with shengbang group directly, song Rui couldn’t help but feel a little emotional.

Xia ruofei sent Song Wei home and asked with a smile,””Young master Song, are you going home or are you going to the hotel to get your car?”

“Let’s go to the hotel!” Song Rui said without thinking.

Then, he felt Xia ruofei’s meaningful gaze. He immediately remembered that he had said that his car had been sent for repair in the afternoon.

However, other than being a little shy in front of Zhuo Yiyi, song Rui was quite thick – skinned most of the time. He was only slightly embarrassed for a few seconds before he immediately said as if nothing had happened,””Let’s go! Don’t tell me you can’t bear to part with my niece? He’s already inside!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.”You’re just making bogus accusations!” He scolded.

Song Rui could not help but laugh.

Xia ruofei took out his phone and read the message that Tang He sent him on the way. He did not have time to read it as he started the car.

Seeing the hotel information in Tang He’s text message, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment, and then he couldn’t help but laugh.

It turned out that Tang He was staying at the Shangri – La hotel. Today’s incident was really a coincidence.

However, this was also good. It saved him the trouble of going back and forth.

Xia ruofei drove to the Shangri – La hotel and parked his car. Song Rui greeted him and went to get his car. Xia ruofei shouted behind him,””Hey! Don’t forget to return my clothes!”

“I know!” Song Rui said without turning his head.

“Remember to dry clean it before giving it to me!” Xia ruofei called out again.

Song Rui still did not turn around and waved his hand. Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly and shake his head.”This unreliable guy ...”

He also jumped out of the car, locked it, and walked into the hotel.

Tang He stayed in the Presidential Suite on the top floor. The elevator in the Presidential Suite was set up individually and could not be entered without permission. Xia ruofei called Tang He and a capable middle – aged man came down to pick him up.

When Xia ruofei arrived at the Presidential Suite, Tang He had already changed into a loose set of home clothes. He was wearing the hotel’s shoes and holding a glass of red wine as he stood in front of the window, overlooking the night view of the three mountains.

Seeing Xia ruofei come in, Tang He immediately greeted him with a smile,””RUO Fei, come, come, have a drink with me!”

Then, Tang He personally poured a glass of red wine for Xia ruofei.

“Thank you, Mr. Tang!” Xia ruofei said with a smile and took the glass.

The two came to the spacious living room and sat down on the sofa. Tang He smiled and said,””It’s been hard on you this time for the Phoebe zhennan wood! Ruofei, thank you!”

“You’re too polite!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have money to earn too!”

Tang He laughed and said,”good wood is now in high demand!” You might not be able to buy it even if you have the money ... By the way, you went to Australia some time ago? How’s the farm?”

“It’s pretty good!” Xia ruofei said,”brother Liang has taken care of the farm well. He should have reported to you, right? The experimental planting of paradise vegetables in Australia has been successful, and the next step will be to start large – scale planting. The prospects of this area are still very good!”

“Alright! I’m also very optimistic about it!” Tang He said with a smile,”originally, I bought the farm just to have a place to raise horses and have a vacation. Now it seems that the field of agricultural products is also promising, but the scale of this farm is still a little small ...”

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly. Paradise Farm was still small. It was equivalent to hundreds of Paradise Farms. But on second thought, in the eyes of a world – Class rich man like Tang He, such a farm was indeed just a small business, just for fun.

Tang He then asked,”ruofei, are you interested in expanding the farm?” Or in the United States! There are also many ranches in the Western part of the United States if you are interested in working together, we can buy a larger Ranch together! Don’t worry about the funds, I can help you pay for it!”
