Chapter 1651: Successfully taking down_1

In fact, after Xia ruofei’s analysis, Liu haofan was already tempted. Anyway, he was not the one losing money. When Xia ruofei mentioned that they were going to inspect other plots of land, Liu haofan couldn’t help but stop them.

When Zhou Tianyu saw that, he couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

He had been in the business world for so many years and had much more experience in negotiating than Liu haofan. Although Xia ruofei’s words sounded sincere and her attitude was tough, Zhou Tianyu felt that there was still room for negotiation.

Even though Zhou Tianyu really couldn’t think of any way Xia ruofei and the rest could solve the yin gathering place problem after they got this piece of land, since Xia ruofei and the rest dared to buy it, they must have a way.

Hence, this piece of land would be worth more than 260 million Yuan in the hands of Xia ruofei and the rest.

As for what Xia ruofei said about suppressing the yin gathering place’s Feng Shui Bureau, the cost would be tens of millions. Zhou Tianyu scoffed at it. If they really wanted to do that, Xia ruofei would definitely offer a lower price.

Zhao Yongjun, song Rui, and the other young masters were not living Lei Feng.

Hence, Zhou Tianyu was prepared to delay a little to see if he could lose less money. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, he didn’t expect Liu haofan to be so impatient. In this way, they, who were already suppressed in every aspect during the negotiation, would be even more passive.

As expected, Xia ruofei stopped and asked with a smile,””Young master Liu, is there anything else?”

Liu haofan squeezed out a smile and said,””President Xia, since you’re here, don’t be in such a hurry to leave! Let’s have lunch together and give general manager Zhou and the others some time to ask the Board of Directors ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Zhou Tianyu and asked,””Director Zhou, what do you think?”

Zhou Tianyu quickly smiled.”I will immediately report the situation of the negotiation to the company’s upper management. President Xia, why don’t you take a seat for a while?”

He had wanted to try to negotiate further, but it was impossible now. Otherwise, not only would the negotiations break down, but he might also offend Liu haofan.

“Alright then!” Xia ruofei returned to his seat and smiled.”Then we’ll wait for your good news, director Zhou!”

Zhou Tianyu smiled bitterly.”President Xia, you guys are too harsh on the price. It’s hard for me to convince the company’s top management. I can only try my best!”

Xia ruofei laughed out loud. He was already confident and naturally didn’t believe Zhou Tianyu’s lies. He smiled and said,””It doesn’t matter if we can’t reach an agreement. General manager Zhou, just do your best ...”

Anyway, no matter what Zhou Tianyu said, he wouldn’t give in and add a single cent.

Zhou Tianyu sighed in his heart. He greeted them and left the meeting room.

Zhou Tianyu pretended to go and ask for instructions. The negotiating atmosphere in the conference room was also swept away. Liu haofan and Zhao Yongjun casually chatted about some things in the Beijing rich and powerful circle.

Xia ruofei did not know much about their circle, so he was too lazy to interrupt. However, he listened with interest.

Song Rui, on the other hand, simply wanted to act cool. He didn’t talk to Liu haofan at all and just sat there with a long face.

Zhou Tianyu didn’t dare to waste too much time and quickly returned to the meeting room.

In reality, when he had been reporting to the company’s chairman and several deputy chairmen, he had not spent much time convincing Liu haofan to give up on the company. The other 260 million was only 40 million less than the base price they had in mind. For a company like Great Tang, an extra 40 million was nothing. As long as they could get rid of this hot potato, it didn’t matter if they lost some money.

In addition, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui’s backgrounds were also terrifying, so Tang real estate naturally didn’t mind using 40 million to make friends.

Hence, Zhou Tianyu quickly got the authorization from the company’s higher – ups, allowing him to represent Tang real estate to transfer the land to Xia ruofei’s team at the price of 260 million Yuan.

If it was a normal business negotiation, even if he had the authorization, Zhou Tianyu would definitely take a long time. He wouldn’t be so straightforward. At least, he couldn’t let the other party think that success was too easy. However, facing top nouveau riches like Zhao Yongjun and song Rui, Zhou Tianyu didn’t dare to have the slightest delay. After coming out of the Chairman’s meeting room, he didn’t even take a break and rushed back to the meeting room.

As soon as Zhou Tianyu entered the house, Zhao Yongjun and Liu haofan, who were chatting, stopped. Everyone looked at him.

Zhou Tianyu smiled and said,””CEO Xia, CEO Zhao, young master Song, I’ve tried my best and finally fulfilled my mission. The company’s higher – ups have agreed to transfer the land at the price of 260 million that CEO Xia proposed!”

Success! Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun relaxed slightly.

Although it was expected, after confirming it, Xia ruofei and the other two couldn’t help but feel excited.

Of course, they didn’t show it on their faces, including song Rui, who didn’t usually hide his thoughts. He still had a cool expression on his face because he felt that it was too degrading to show his joy in front of Liu haofan.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thank you, director Zhou!” Then I wish everyone a happy cooperation!”

Liu haofan also heaved a long sigh of relief. He had finally gotten rid of this hot potato.

He also laughed and said,”haha!” Happy cooperation! Happy cooperation!”
