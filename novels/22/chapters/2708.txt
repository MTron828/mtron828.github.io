Apparently, Wang Boshan had been waiting for Xia ruofei’s news for the past two days. He picked up the call very quickly.

Wang Boshan said enthusiastically,”director Xia!” I’ve been waiting for your call!”

“Hello, chief Wang.” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Hahaha! President Xia, you must have good news for me!” Wang Boshan couldn’t suppress his excitement,”has the official relationship of the agate map been coordinated, and the peach Garden Island can perform the transfer procedures?”

Wang Boshan had been eyeing the Peach Blossom Island for a long time. He was the first to discover that the island, which was still called the Azure cloud Island at the time, was somewhat different from the rest. Out of his cultivator’s intuition, he reported the news directly to the sect master of the star Seizer sect, Luo Qingfeng. As the star Seizer sect’s representative in the secular world, although his cultivation level was not high, he had the authority to report directly to the sect master.

Later on, the star Seizer sect sent Zheng Yongshou over to investigate. Although he did not directly confirm that it was the Taixu xuanqing formation like Xia ruofei, he could at least tell that it was a very high – Level natural formation. Thus, Luo Qingfeng sealed off the news and ordered Zheng Yongshou and Wang Boshan to take down the Paradise Island at all costs.

The events that happened after that were full of twists and turns. Now, Wang Boshan could finally see success in front of him. Thinking about the heavy reward that the sect would give him, Wang Boshan could not help but be excited.

“Mr. Wang,” Xia ruofei said calmly,”I’m sorry to disappoint you. I don’t have good news today.”

Wang Boshan could not help but be stunned for a moment and quickly asked,””President Xia, is there a problem? Could it be that the government in the city was not coordinating well? It shouldn’t be difficult to deal with the politicians of such small countries! Just use us dollars. Don’t be afraid of spending money. When the time comes, the cost can be paid by our Stars Group ...”

“It’s not because of the agate. ” Xia ruofei interrupted Wang Boshan’s words and said,”it’s just that I suddenly don’t want to sell myself ... My dream since I was young was to have a world of my own. Peach Blossom Island can be said to be exactly the same as my childhood dream. I don’t want to sell my dream for money. After all, I don’t lack money ...”

When Wang Boshan heard this, he could not help but want to curse. What nonsense childhood dreams! I was just short of this final shiver. You’re actually telling me that you suddenly don’t want to sell it for some dream?

“Mr. Xia, do you think the price is too low?” Wang Boshan asked anxiously. We can still discuss this! Even though the company’s budget is limited, it’s not impossible to increase it ...”

“It has nothing to do with money,” Xia ruofei said,”I just don’t want to sell it ... CEO Wang, I’m really sorry!”

Wang Boshan’s face turned gloomy and his tone turned cold,””President Xia, what you’re doing is a little unkind! We’ve made a deal before, and we’ve been raising money for the past two days. In order to raise so much cash, we’ve paid a lot of money. It’s a bit unreasonable for you to suddenly not sell it!”

Xia ruofei replied nonchalantly,”Oh?” Didn’t chief Wang say that you have sufficient funds and can take out the money at any time?”

“I ...” Wang Boshan choked on Xia ruofei’s words. After a long while, he said angrily,”you’re going back on your word!” We already made an agreement two days ago in the capital. How could you go back on your word?”

“If I’m not mistaken, I didn’t sign any written agreement with your company, did I?” Xia ruofei said calmly.

“Do you think a verbal promise can be changed so easily?” Wang Boshan lost his mind and said loudly,”director Xia, your behavior is a taboo in the business world! If I were to spread this news, who would dare to do business with your paradise Corporation in the future?”

Wang Boshan’s emotions were so agitated, but Xia ruofei remained calm. He said lightly,””Chief Wang, everyone’s understanding is different. According to my understanding, we should have only reached the intention to make a deal in Beijing. It can’t even be considered a verbal agreement. Everything is changing. I’m not optimistic about this deal, so I changed my mind. There’s no problem with that!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Then there’s nothing to talk about?” Wang Boshan asked gloomily,”I can’t even pay more?”

“I’m sorry. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“It seems that President Xia is determined!” Wang Boshan was so angry that he laughed,”very good ... I hope you won’t regret it in the future!”

Wang Boshan didn’t wait for Xia ruofei to speak and hung up the phone.

Xia ruofei smiled and kept his phone.

“Done!” Xia ruofei smiled at Li Yifu and benilatti.”Benilatti, you’d better think back to what I told you. This angry CEO Wang will contact you soon!”

“Mr. Xia, don’t worry! I’ve already memorized it!” Beniladi said.

Li Yifu couldn’t help but ask,””Senior granduncle, aren’t you afraid of completely angering them? it will lead to uncontrollable consequences?”

“For example?” Xia ruofei shrugged and asked.

“For example, the other party has completely given up on acquiring the Peach Blossom Island through commercial means. Instead, they’ve mobilized a large number of cultivators from the star Seizer sect to directly seize the island.” Li Yifu said.

“It’s certain that we’ll give up on commercial means.” Xia ruofei said indifferently,”but they definitely won’t report it directly to the sect. As for the reason, you can analyze it yourself. The relationship within a cultivation sect is actually similar to that in the workplace ...”
