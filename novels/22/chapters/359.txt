Chapter 360: Light at the end of the tunnel (1)

The staff of each exhibition stage walked out of the exhibition hall in groups. Even Xia ruofei followed them out. One of the students from the Garden Club was called out by Xia Cheng and unwillingly stayed behind to watch over the place.

Sure enough, after everyone gathered in line at the entrance hall, the staff of the organizing committee began to move out the 30 pots of flowers that were shortlisted and arranged them neatly in front of the temporary podium.

After a while, the judges came out of the office. The head of the judging panel, Chen dongbai, held a piece of paper in his hand with a faint smile on his face. He walked straight to the podium and sat down.

Other than Chen dongbai, there were two other people who went up to the rostrum, while the other judges sat down directly in the audience.

One of the two people on the stage was vice – Principal li of Agricultural University, who had been accompanying the judges just now.

When Xia ruofei saw another old man with a blue judge’s badge on his chest, he could not help but be stunned.”Isn’t this professor Tian from Sanshan University?”

Jiang Yue and the rest also noticed professor Tian at once. Jiang Yue could not help but exclaim softly,””Youyou, isn’t this your grandfather?”

Xia Cheng couldn’t help but say,’eh? When did professor Tian come?”

“Teacher Hu can’t come,” Lu You said.”The school has sent my grandfather to be the judge.”

“Why didn’t you say so earlier? “You made us worry for nothing ...” Jiang Yue pouted.

Lu You spread her hands and said,”I don’t know if he’ll come or not!” He hadn’t even made a decision when I left! But I told him that Xia ruofei would be here today ...”

After she finished speaking, Lu You looked at Xia ruofei thoughtfully and did not continue.

Professor Tian was a man of virtue and prestige. Under normal circumstances, he would not join in on the fun. However, even though he was a little late today, he had still come. He must have come because of Xia ruofei.

As expected, professor Tian found Xia ruofei and his group in the crowd very quickly. He did not even greet his granddaughter, Lu You, and just smiled at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei quickly greeted professor Tian with a smile.

Chen dongbai, the president of the southeast province florist Association, who was sitting in the middle of the podium, cleared his throat and moved the microphone to his front. He said,”Dear leaders, teachers, and students, after more than two hours of closed – door meeting, the gold, silver, and bronze prizes for this flower exhibition have been decided ...”

Vice – Principal li and professor Tian were sitting on the stage with a smile on their faces.

The only difference was that vice – Principal li was not a judge, so he didn’t know the final result of the evaluation. Therefore, his smile was somewhat nervous.

Chen dongbai continued,”before I announce the results, I would like to introduce the two leaders and experts on the stage. I believe everyone is already very familiar with this person. He is our Agriculture and Forestry University’s Vice President li.” And the one on my right is professor Tian from Sanshan University. He temporarily replaced teacher Hu, who was unable to join the judging team due to illness. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Professor Tian smiled and turned on the microphone to greet everyone.

The teachers and students in the audience also applauded. Professor Tian was a highly respected and well – known expert in the academic world. He was also an old expert who enjoyed special subsidies from the state. The Bioengineering major he was engaged in was an overlapping subject with many other major in the University of Agriculture and Forestry. He had a lot of Academic Exchange activities, so the teachers and students of the University were very familiar with him.

“Professor Tian is very busy with his academic work,” said Chen dongbai. “He only arrived at our Evaluation Committee more than an hour ago. If I had known earlier that professor Tian was going to participate, I wouldn’t have dared to be the head of the judging panel no matter what. Whether it’s in terms of academics or qualifications, professor Tian is much higher than me ...”

Professor Tian chuckled and said,”President Chen, you don’t have to be so polite. Every profession has its own specialty!” There’s no need to worry about this question. Everyone is still waiting for you to announce the result! I’m sure the students can’t wait!”

There was a burst of kind laughter from the audience.

Indeed, they were not interested in who would be the leader of the judging panel. They were only concerned about who would win the award this time, especially the gold medal, which touched the hearts of many people.

“Alright!” Chen dongbai chuckled. Then let’s directly announce the flowers and plants that have won the award. The flowers that won the bronze prize of this year’s Southeast province flower exhibition were: Heron Island University’s four – season Begonia, Puzhou Teacher’s College’s peony blooms in prosperity, Sanshan Engineering College’s calla lily ...”

Chen dongbai announced the five works that had won the Bronze Award.

The teachers and students of the universities where the winning works were located were naturally overjoyed. Of course, some people were more disappointed, such as the pot of four – season Begonia from Heron Island University. They had hoped to win the Silver Award, but they did not expect to only win the Bronze Award.

Among these five works, there was no jade lion Mo Lan from Sanshan University, nor yang suhe from Southeast Agriculture and Forestry University.

Jiang Yue and the others had their hearts in their mouths the entire time, afraid that they would hear the name jade lion Mo Lan. They only heaved a sigh of relief after Chen dongbai announced the flowers and flowers that had won the Bronze Award.

At the same time, they were also a little worried about their personal gains and losses. They did not know if Mo Lan would be listed as a work with a Silver Award, or if she would not even win the award ...

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, looked relaxed. He was still very confident in the Jade lion. Although he was not 100% sure that it would win the gold Prize, at least it would not be a bronze prize.
