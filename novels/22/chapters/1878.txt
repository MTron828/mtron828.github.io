Xia ruofei was overjoyed,”this is the best arrangement!” Aunt Tian, when sister Qian arrives in Beijing, you can ask her about her wishes. If she is willing to work in Beijing, you can go through the transfer procedures at the same time. I estimate that it will take two months. You should be able to complete all the procedures, right?”

“Alright!” Tian Huilan said readily,”this is a big matter. We still need to ask for her opinion!”

“Alright! I’m relieved that Auntie Tian will personally make the arrangements!” Xia ruofei said.

The two of them chatted for a while and talked about their current situation before hanging up.

Tian Huilan didn’t continue to ask questions about Liu haojun. On the one hand, she was working in Beijing, so it wasn’t appropriate for her to interfere too deeply in her previous work. On the other hand, she felt that Xia ruofei was not part of the organization and could only help Wu Liqian so much. There should not be any other arrangements.

Xia ruofei was also glad that Tian Huilan didn’t pursue the matter. Otherwise, he wouldn’t know how to brush it off!

From receiving Wu Liqian’s call to summoning Lei Hu, and then immediately calling Tian Huilan, the whole process had taken almost half an hour.

Xia ruofei was going to pick Ling Qingxue up, but he had already walked to the parking lot. After receiving Wu Liqian’s call, he returned to the office.

Therefore, after he was done with the matters here, he quickly left the house and went to the underground parking lot to drive straight to the Ling Ji restaurant headquarters.

On the way, Xia ruofei received a call from Ling Qingxue.

“Ruofei, why haven’t we arrived yet?” Ling Qingxue asked,”did something happen on the way?”

“No, no. Something came up at the company, so I stayed a little longer.” Xia ruofei said,”he’s already out. He’ll be at your office in ten minutes at most.” I’m so sorry ...”

“It’s okay, I’m just worried about you!” Ling Qingxue smiled and said,”I won’t talk to you if you’re driving! Be careful on the road!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

His car drove to the headquarters of the lingji F & B building. From afar, he could already see Ling Qingxue already waiting downstairs.

Before the car had even come to a complete stop, Ling Qingxue had already opened the door and climbed into the Knight XV that had a very high chassis.

Xia ruofei glanced at Ling Qingxue and asked with a smile,””I feel like you’re in high spirits today! Do you have any happy things to share with me?”

“It’s about hiring a professional manager to take charge of the company’s daily operations. My father is already a little tempted by what I’ve said ...”Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and smiled.

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei was also very happy.”Then you should hurry up and strike while the iron is hot! If you mention it more in front of him, it might be done soon!”

“I think so too!” Ling Qingxue said,”that’s why I’m not planning to spend the night on the farm this time. I’ll go home after we finish our joint training!” I’ll talk to my dad ...”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded. He scratched his head and said,””This ... I’m not in a hurry to wait for a day or two, right? The farm isn’t near, it’s going to be a lot of trouble to go back and forth!”

Actually, what Xia ruofei was thinking was that if Ling Qingxue went home after her cultivation, he would not have the chance to roll around in the sheets with her and do something shameless.

Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”ever since I started cultivating, I feel like I’m full of energy. It’s only a short journey, how can I be tired?” Besides ... I didn’t drive, did I? Aren’t you going to send me back when I come back? I won’t be tired if I don’t have to drive ...”

Xia ruofei wanted to cry but had no tears. He was the first to suggest bringing in a professional manager team to Ling Qingxue. The purpose was to free Ling Qingxue from the complex administrative work and at the same time, let Ling Qingxue spend more time with him.

However, Ling Qingxue had changed her mind and decided to go home every day because of this matter. Did that mean that he would not have any chance to get close to her?

Could this be considered as digging a hole for himself? Xia ruofei’s mind was running wild as he drove.

From the Second Ring Road to the third ring Road, the traffic was smooth all the way. After about half an hour, the two of them returned to the farm at about seven in the evening.

As soon as they returned to the small villa, Ling Qingxue could not wait to ask Xia ruofei to take out the time array flag and start cultivating.

Xia ruofei asked Ling Qingxue to wait in the small gym room in the villa while he went upstairs. After avoiding Ling Qingxue, he took out the time array flag from the medium.

Back at the gym, Xia ruofei did not waste any time. He immediately set up the time formation and the two of them entered it to start cultivating. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It had to be said that Xia ruofei had used two stalks of heart concentrating grass without caring about the cost. After his “magical modification”, Ling Qingxue’s talent was indeed strong to the point of being abnormal. This time, Ling Qingxue’s cultivation had obviously improved by a large margin.

The two of them had been cultivating for about two hours, and the time they had spent in the array was about seven days. Excluding the time they spent eating and going to the bathroom, the two of them had only been cultivating for about four to five days. Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, had already vaguely touched the bottleneck of the peak of Qi disciple Level 1.

Ling Qingxue’s progress in cultivation made Xia ruofei half happy and half sad. He was happy that his efforts had not been in vain and that Ling Qingxue’s future in cultivation was very bright. His main concern was the progress. It shouldn’t be long before Ling Qingxue reached the peak of Qi disciple Level 3. When that time comes, he would have to show his cards. Xia ruofei couldn’t predict how Ling Qingxue would react.

Ling Qingxue, who was immersed in the rapid improvement of her cultivation, wanted to continue but was stopped by Xia ruofei.

On one hand, it was already past nine in the evening. If Ling Qingxue wanted to go home, it was about time to leave. Otherwise, it would be too late.

On the other hand, Xia ruofei was worried that Ling Qingxue’s cultivation was progressing too quickly, which would cause her Foundation to be unstable.

After much persuasion, Xia ruofei finally got Ling Qingxue to accept his suggestion. Then, he personally drove Ling Qingxue back to the city.

Considering that it was already very late, Xia ruofei sent Ling Qingxue to her house and returned to the farm without alighting. He did not enter the house to disturb Ling Xiaotian’s rest.

Xia ruofei also felt that it was quite tiring to travel back and forth between Changping and the city today. It seemed like he had to hurry up and buy a house. It was indeed inconvenient to have no place to stay in the city ...

The next day, Xia ruofei drove to the new headquarters of the company in the city after having breakfast at the farm cafeteria.

At nineo’ clock, Lei Hu brought four capable veterans to Xia ruofei’s office.

Xia ruofei could tell that these unfamiliar – looking veterans were more or less reserved. He greeted everyone with a kind attitude and then led them to the guest area to take their seats.

“President Xia, I’ve thought about it yesterday. I won’t be joining this operation ...” Lei Hu said.

“Why?” Xia ruofei asked, raising his eyebrows.

“I’m an official employee of the company and the person in charge of the security team. If anything happens, the company will definitely be implicated regardless of whether there’s evidence or not!”Lei Hu said.

At this point, Lei Hu pointed at the four veterans and said,”The four of them are new to the company. They haven’t even signed the labor contract yet. If there’s any problem, the company will not be involved!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but secretly praise. Lei Hu’s mind was indeed meticulous.

Yesterday, Xia ruofei had only found someone he absolutely trusted to handle this matter. He had not paid much attention to the hidden danger that Lei Hu had mentioned. Lei Hu could be said to have checked and filled up the gaps and filled up all the possible loopholes.

Xia ruofei looked at Lei Hu approvingly and nodded,””You’re very thoughtful. You should be more careful ...”

Seeing that Xia ruofei had agreed to his suggestion, Lei Hu heaved a sigh of relief. He said to the few veterans,””The four of you can go outside and wait for a while! I have something to report to President Xia!”

The four old soldiers quickly stood up and replied in unison,””Yes!”

After they left the office, Lei Hu said to Xia ruofei,””Brother Xia, I’ve carefully thought about the candidates I’ve chosen this time. They’re absolutely reliable, and their professional abilities are top – notch ...”
