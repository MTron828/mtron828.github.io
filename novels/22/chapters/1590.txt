Chapter 1592: Vivid and lifelike (1)

Translator: 549690339

The image of the clock was originally like a portrait, but it was a little abstract. However, when Xia ruofei used his spiritual sense to sense it, the portrait began to become three ‚Äì dimensional and vivid, as if a 2d picture had suddenly become a 3D picture.

More importantly, Xia ruofei could even feel the righteous energy from the statue. He could clearly understand what the image was trying to express.

Without a doubt, a sculpture sculpted under such circumstances would definitely have the most divine charm!

Xia ruofei already had an idea. This visualization was so magical that it would be the best prototype for the Jade carving. Since he could not find the image of master Bao, he would not use it. He would use Zhong Yuan and master Guan ‚Äòs. Then, depending on the quality of the Jade, he would make a few Guanyin jade carvings.

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei visualized the images of Guan Yu and Guan Yin Bodhisattva. After he understood them, he took out the spirit map and entered the spirit map space.

When he picked up the rare black jade again, he was no longer at a loss. He had some confidence.

This kind of natural jade was definitely irregular, so planning was also a skill. One had to find the best arrangement to maximize the utilization rate.

Although Xia ruofei did not have any experience in this area, his brain was much faster than ordinary people. His calculation ability was also much better than ordinary people. In addition, he had a deep understanding of the content of the sculpture, so he was able to construct a prototype very quickly.

Some of the irregular protruding parts on the black jadeite could be used as part of the Jade carving if used well. It could be done with a little carving. Only by taking these details into account could the jadeite be used to the extreme.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to start. Instead, he repeatedly pondered over the structure of the entire piece of Jade until he understood every detail in his heart. Then, he began to deduce quickly.

Finally, Xia ruofei took out a red marker and started to draw lines on the surface of the Jade.

After checking it a few times, Xia ruofei took out a carving knife and poured his genuine Qi into it. Then, he cut the Jade without hesitation.

As he had already simulated it in his mind many times, Xia ruofei was very decisive when he cut. In a short while, the Jade was cut into dozens of pieces of different sizes.

According to Xia ruofei‚Äôs calculations, this piece of Jade could be used to carve eight Zhong Jue statues, six Guan Gong statues, and five Guanyin statues. The remaining scraps could be used to make at least three sets of pearl chains, rings, earrings, and other small trinkets.

After the cutting was completed, Xia ruofei picked up a piece of black jade. With just a glance, he knew that he was going to use it to carve the Guan Gong statue.

He silently reviewed the image of Lord Guan a few times, and then concentrated on the first strike ...

The Jade spun back and forth in his hand, and he cut it accurately. The image of a Guan Yu quickly appeared.

Xia ruofei had a whole set of jade carving tools, including all kinds of knife ‚Äì edge razors and razors. However, because of his essential Qi, a medium ‚Äì sized ordinary carving knife was enough to satisfy all the carving needs. Throughout the whole process, he only changed the tool once or twice to take care of the small details that the ordinary carving knife could not complete.

Xia ruofei‚Äôs every move was just right. Not only did he recreate the image of Lord Guan in the visualization picture, but his accuracy was almost 100%. There was no excess. Even the scraps he cut off were the same as the result of his deduction.

It should be known that these scraps of different sizes were also useful. If there was a deviation in the cutting, one or two more cuts were needed, and the scraps would inevitably become very small and broken, and could not be used again.

However, with Xia ruofei‚Äôs precise control, it was impossible for this to happen.

After Guan Yu‚Äôs image took shape, Xia ruofei started to work on the details.

During this process, everything that was cut off by the carving knife was considered waste because they were all very small pieces of jade.

However, Xia ruofei did not waste it. He used his mind to control the spirit map space and absorbed all the Jade. Although this little bit of Jade was not even a drop in the ocean for leveling up, Xia ruofei did not have the habit of wasting it.

After a while, a lifelike statue of Guan Gong appeared in Xia ruofei‚Äôs hand. It had a cool beard, a domineering Green Dragon Crescent Blade, and the iconic Phoenix eyes and silk eyebrows ...

The rarest thing was that the moment the Jade carving was completed, it seemed to suddenly have a spirit. It was clearly a lifeless jade carving, but it seemed to have a kind of righteous and fearless temperament, making people unable to help but feel respect.

Xia ruofei took the statue and admired it for a while. He was very satisfied.

He had sculpted a few things before, including A Doraemon pendant for Song Wei. Although they were all very realistic, they were not as good as the Guan Yu statue.

This was the effect of the visualization picture. Xia ruofei visualized the image of Guan Yu and then restored the charm on the Jade carving. Naturally, the effect was better.

He rested for a while and picked up another piece of Jade embryo.

As it was easier to sculpt this Guan Gong statue, and he already had the feeling, Xia ruofei continued to sculpt the Guan Gong statue.

After about ten hours, six lifelike jade statues of Duke Guan appeared beside Xia ruofei. At the same time, there was a pile of scraps of different sizes that Xia ruofei had carefully collected.

As time flowed 30 times faster at the Archean realm, Xia ruofei didn‚Äôt even leave the spirit map space and continued to sculpt the remaining Jade embryos.

When he was tired, he would take a nap on the recliner. When he was tired, he would drink some water from the spirit pond. When he was hungry, he would just eat some biscuits.

It was also thanks to him being a cultivator that he was able to support such a high ‚Äì intensity work.

The physical fatigue was secondary. This kind of work of carving Jade was more of a mental strain. If one was mentally tired, a slight shake of the hand might destroy a priceless jade carving.

To Xia ruofei, whose spiritual power cultivation had reached the stage of the spiritual palpitations, these problems were naturally not a problem.

Of course, to be safe, he would drink some of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution to recover after his mental power had been depleted. At the same time, he paid attention to the balance between work and rest. He would take a break after each jade carving.

Just like that, Xia ruofei stayed in the spirit map space for four to five days before he finished carving all the Jade. √öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

There were eight Zhong Kui statues, six Guan Gong statues, five Guanyin statues, and four pearl chains. Each Pearl on the chain was hand ‚Äì polished by Xia ruofei. They were of the same size and round, as if they were made by a machine.

Other than that, Xia ruofei also used some slightly bigger leftovers to make three pairs of earrings, five small pendants, and nine rings.

The designs of these small accessories were also scientifically designed according to the size and shape of the leftovers. There were water drop shapes, tree leaves, hearts, and so on. Although not many jades were used, each set was a treasure.

Xia ruofei felt a sense of accomplishment when he saw the black jade in his hands become a piece of art.

Of course, he had only completed half of his work. The next step was to engrave formation patterns on the inside of each Jade according to their characteristics.

However, Xia ruofei did not plan to finish it all in one go today.

Firstly, his spirit was also rather tired after continuously fighting. Inscribing array patterns was also a task that required a high level of concentration. It was even more tiring than carving Jade.

Secondly, he needed to think carefully about what kind of array pattern he was going to inscribe. He also had to deduce and practice in advance. He could only start inscribing when he was confident. This was not something that could be completed in a short time.

Xia ruofei didn‚Äôt have any urgent need for these jade articles, so he left the spirit map space after he was done with the carving work.

Even with time flowing at thirty times the normal speed, Xia ruofei had stayed in the spirit map space for so long that three hours had passed in the outside world. It was already one in the morning in the outside world.

Hence, after Xia ruofei took a shower, he went straight to bed to rest.

......

The next morning, Xia ruofei didn‚Äôt make breakfast. Instead, he got up early and cultivated for a while. Now that he had a lot of crystals, he didn‚Äôt have to cultivate on time.

At around Seveno‚Äô clock, Xia ruofei had already washed up. He dressed neatly and went downstairs to the company cafeteria for breakfast.

Xia ruofei had ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù for more than ten days, but the employees did not feel anything. They were already used to the chairman being the boss.

However, Feng Jing, who did not know that Xia ruofei had returned, was shocked when she saw Xia ruofei sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, eating porridge.

She rubbed her eyes and looked a few more times before she was sure that she wasn‚Äôt seeing things.

Feng Rao took her plate and sat opposite Xia ruofei. Then, she asked with a faint smile,‚Äù‚ÄùComrade Chairman, you‚Äôre finally willing to come back?‚Äù

Xia ruofei gulped down the porridge and took a paper towel to wipe his mouth. Then, he picked up a deep ‚Äì fried dough stick, dipped it in the soy milk, and took a big bite.

Then, as he chewed, he said indistinctly,‚Äù‚ÄùPresident Feng, you‚Äôve worked hard ...‚Äù

Feng Jing didn‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry at Xia ruofei‚Äôs thick ‚Äì skinned behavior.

Xia ruofei saw her strange expression and asked,‚Äù‚ÄùPresident Feng, did anything happen to the company while I was away?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn ‚Äòt!‚Äù Feng Rao was a little confused.

‚ÄúThen isn‚Äôt it settled?‚Äù Xia ruofei took another big bite of the youtiao and continued,‚Äùthis means that you‚Äôve done your job well even without me! It also means that you didn‚Äôt betray my trust!‚Äù

Feng Rao gloomily took a bite of her bun and said,‚Äù‚ÄùAnyway, you‚Äôre right, right? You‚Äôre the boss!‚Äù

Xia ruofei smiled and said,‚Äùsister che, I know you‚Äôve worked hard!‚Äù Please forgive me for being such an incompetent boss ...‚Äù

Xia ruofei‚Äôs ‚Äúsister che‚Äù made Feng Jing‚Äôs heart soften. She knew that with Xia ruofei‚Äôs personality, he would not be able to hold the position of Chairman.

Hence, Feng Rao sighed and said,‚Äù‚ÄùIt‚Äôs okay ... I don‚Äôt blame you. It‚Äôs just that you‚Äôve been out for a little long this time ... Don‚Äôt go out again this morning! I need to report to you about the work I‚Äôve been doing recently. ‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry! I‚Äôm not going anywhere this morning!‚Äù Xia ruofei said.

‚ÄúThis is more like it!‚Äù Feng Rao said as she looked at Xia ruofei.

At this time, another figure walked into the cafeteria and went straight to the window to get food.

Xia ruofei looked up and was stunned.
