Chapter 644: Chapter 462 – advancing side – by – side -3

Xue Jinshan could no longer remain calm. He took a deep breath and his eyes were filled with shock. Xia ruofei would definitely not joke about such things. He had even set up a pharmaceutical company. He would definitely be serious.

That was to say, this CEO Xia had really developed a special medicine for autism? Moreover, it wasn’t a team, and they only passed an ancient recipe? Xue Jinshan felt like he was in a dream.

He realized that if Xia ruofei’s medicine for autism could really be effective, it would really fill in the gap and even be an epoch – making achievement.

He was a master’s graduate, and he was able to participate in such a project as a first – generation entrepreneur ... This was a rare opportunity! Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but feel excited.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Mr. Xue, I’m currently recruiting 10 people with autism. We’re preparing for the second round of testing. As long as you join our company, you can participate. We can even disclose the prescription to you.”

In fact, the prescription of the heart – nourishing soup was one thing, but the control of the fire was another. There were many small tricks in this. Even if an ordinary person got the prescription, they might not be able to make the real heart – nourishing soup in their lifetime.

Of course, in the future, when mass production was achieved, the control of the fire could be achieved through automatic settings. It might require repeated debugging in the beginning, but as long as the parameters were determined, the production in the future could be directly fed according to the proportion.

Xue Jinshan no longer hesitated and said,”President Xia, I’m willing to join your company! If it’s successful, this will definitely be a great project!”

Xia ruofei smiled and stood up. He extended his hand to Xue Jinshan and said,”Welcome, researcher Xue!”

The researcher that Xia ruofei was talking about was naturally a researcher at Taoyuan pharmaceutical research Institute. It was not a national title. With Xue Jinshan’s qualifications, he had to start as an assistant researcher in a research institution within the system. It was unknown how many years he would be promoted to a researcher!

After Xia ruofei shook hands with Xue Jinshan, he said,””Researcher Xue, boss Feng has told you before, right? To join our research Institute, you have to sign a confidentiality agreement and competition terms. ”

This was something Xia ruofei had specially requested Feng Jing to prepare. Any information regarding the heart – nourishing soup had to be kept absolutely confidential. Otherwise, not only would they face sky – High compensation, but they might even be imprisoned.

Of course, this was also because if the heart – nourishing soup wanted to be produced, it had to be patented and the ingredients needed to be approved. It was difficult to keep it a secret, and these specific tasks had to be done by the researchers. Xia ruofei could not keep it a secret from them.

......

Besides, he had no intention of using the formula to make a profit. Since he could not prevent the researchers from getting in touch with the formula, Xia ruofei simply restricted it on the contract.

As for the future mass production of the jaded skin cream, since it was not a drug and was a project that would really make huge profits, Xia ruofei would definitely not apply for a patent. He would also have to design a series of confidentiality chains so that he could only control the real key links and avoid the possibility of leaking the secret from the root.

“I understand,” Xue Jinshan nodded. President Xia, please rest assured. This is the most basic professional ethics, and I will definitely follow it. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled and nodded.

Even if the recipe was leaked, it would be difficult for others to replicate the original version of the heart – nourishing soup. However, he was still very satisfied with Xue jinshang’s attitude.

“Researcher Xue, I’ll ask chief Feng to arrange the employment procedures for you later,” said Xia ruofei. After that, I’ll give you a detailed introduction of the prescription and the first preliminary test. Your next step is to first apply for the drug patent, and then prepare for the approval of the new drug. In the next few days, we should be hiring a few more people. I hope that you will work together to push forward our project as soon as possible!”

“Understood!” Xue Jinshan said excitedly,”director Xia, it’s my honor to be able to participate in such a great project!”

Xia ruofei smiled and patted Xue Jinshan’s shoulder. Then, he called Feng Jing and asked her to personally handle the employment procedures for Xue Jinshan. Of course, the most important part was the confidentiality clause and the non – competition clause. Xia ruofei would only be at ease if Feng Jing personally locked him up.

After Feng Jing left with Xue Jinshan, Xia ruofei sat in his office and lit a cigarette.

Manager li and Jiang Hua hadn’t come up with a specific budget yet, but Jiang Hua had reported to him once. Millions of RMB was definitely a must. The requirements of the Bogle fish for water quality and environment were too high, and some of the equipment was very expensive.

In addition, Feng Jing’s registration of the pharmaceutical company was also progressing very quickly. The next step was to verify the capital. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei had spent most of his money on buying jadeite.

Hence, Xia ruofei had to hurry up and get some money back.

Of course, Xia ruofei had already thought of a plan, so he was very confident.
