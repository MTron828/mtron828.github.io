Chapter 283: Reunion after a long separation (1)

“Dad, don’t believe their nonsense ...” Li Guizhi said hurriedly.”Hurry up and go rest!” We’ll take care of this!” Li Zhifu still ignored his daughter and looked at Xia ruofei with excitement. Seeing this, Xia ruofei already had an idea. He smiled and said,””You must be Mr. Li Zhifu! I think you still remember company commander song, who was staying at your house that year, right?” Sure enough, li Zhifu couldn’t help but tremble after hearing Xia ruofei’s words. His cloudy eyes shone with a strange light. “Little ... Little song?” Li Zhifu’s lips trembled as he spoke. “Dad! Do you really know an elder song from Beijing?” Li Guizhi asked in disbelief. In her impression, her father was an old farmer who had to face the earth and the sky all his life. Other than the tea – making skills passed down from his ancestors, there was nothing special about him. Moreover, li Zhifu had never left the southeast province in his entire life. How could he know someone from the capital? In fact, li Zhifu had a daughter at an old age. When the Army was stationed in xiakeng village, Li Guizhi wasn’t even born yet. When elder song returned 30 years ago, Li Guizhi was already married. Li Zhifu had always kept a low profile, especially when elder song’s status was getting higher and higher. Li Zhifu didn’t even mention that elder song had stayed in his house for the night, let alone contact elder song. Hence, Li Guizhi knew nothing about it. Seeing the old man’s reaction, Xia ruofei had an idea. He turned his head and said in a low voice,”song Rui, you can go out and let the chief in.” “Alright!” Song Rui responded and quickly walked out. When the two of them walked over just now, a few cars were following them slowly. Therefore, song Rui walked a few steps back and reached the car. “Grandpa, I’ve found it!” Song Rui said excitedly. “What did you find?” Elder song repeated subconsciously. “Mr. Li Zhifu found it!” Song Rui said happily,”he lives here with his daughter and son – in – Law! Grandpa, Mr. Li Zhifu is in the shop now. ” “Let’s go!” Elder song immediately said. Elder song stepped out of the car and manager Lu, who was sitting in the back, quickly called out,””Chief, slow down! Xiao Rui, quick, quick, quick, hold on to him!” “Alright, Uncle Lu, don’t worry!” Song Rui said with a smile. As he spoke, song Rui reached out his hand to help elder song. However, elder song gently shook song Rui off and walked toward the store not far away. In the small shop, li Zhifu’s lips trembled as he asked,””Young man, did little song really send you?” “Old Mr. Li, you’ll know soon enough if it’s true or not.” Xia ruofei said with a smile. At this moment, a series of powerful footsteps could be heard. Elder song appeared at the entrance of the store, followed by song Rui, Huang Fang, and the others. The two old men’s eyes met, and their bodies trembled slightly. Eccentric song took two steps forward and called out in a trembling voice,”Brother Fu ...” Li Zhifu’s eyes were also wet. He opened his mouth and after a long time, he walked up shakily. He looked at elder song up and down and said,”Little song ... You ... You’re old too!” Elder song grabbed li Zhifu’s hand and said,””Brother Fu, it really is you! We ... Haven’t seen each other for thirty years!” “Yup! “Thirty years ...” Li Zhifu was also filled with emotion.”Little song, I didn’t expect to see you again before I die!” “Brother Fu! I’ll go to xiakeng village to find you. ” Elder song said,”I saw that the old house was abandoned. My fellow villagers told me that you moved out of the village eight years ago. I asked around and finally found this place!” “Brother Fu, why didn’t you reply to my letters all these years?” elder song continued. “Little song, your position is getting higher and higher. I’m just a farmer ... So I thought I shouldn’t disturb you ...” Li Zhifu said slowly. “Big brother Fu, no matter how high my position is, I’m still your little brother,” said eccentric song angrily. Back then, if it wasn’t for you and our fellow villagers, I might not even be alive!” Li Zhifu smiled and didn’t say anything. As the two old men spoke, their wrinkled hands were tightly held together. It was clear that they were very excited. Li Guizhi, who was at the side, had been sizing up elder song. She opened her mouth slightly and exclaimed,””You ... You’re song ... Song ...” It was obvious that Li Guizhi had already recognized elder song. A few years ago, before elder song retired, he would appear on the news every day, so there were very few people in China who didn’t know him. However, elder song had left his leadership position in recent years. In addition, there was no need to consider the country’s image when it came to his personal image, so he appeared much older than he was in the past few years. Li Guizhi didn’t react for a moment, but she quickly recognized him. At this moment, she was extremely shocked. She never thought that her honest farmer father would know a leader who played an important role in China. Her old father even called this leader “little song”, and elder song himself also called himself “little brother.” This was simply beyond her expectations. Li Zhifu looked at his daughter indifferently and said,””This is your uncle song!” Li Guizhi, who was already over 60 years old, called out cautiously,””Uncle song, how are you?” “Brother Fu, this must be your daughter, Guizhi, right?” elder song smiled kindly. When I came back 30 years ago, you told me that you had a daughter who was already married. At that time, I was busy with work and didn’t have time to meet her. ” “Yeah, I’m living with my daughter and son – in – Law now!” Li Zhifu nodded. Eccentric song nodded. After a moment of silence, he turned to Huang Fang and the others.”Huang, I’m going to stay behind to catch up with brother Fu. You guys go back to the hotel! Xiao Xia, Xiao Lu, and Xiao Rui will stay. You guys can just leave the car here. ” “Old commander, this ...” Huang Fang revealed a difficult expression. He was mainly doing this for safety reasons. “Carry out the order!” Elder song said, leaving no room for doubt. What are so many people doing here? It’s fine as long as little Xia is here! All of you, go back. ” Xia ruofei gave Xu Wu a look. Xu Wu immediately understood and pulled Huang Fang’s sleeve. He said in a low voice,””Supervisor Huang, listen to the chief! There won’t be a problem with RUO Fei around!” Huang Fang had already seen elder song and Xu Wu’s blind confidence in Xia ruofei. Seeing elder song’s firm attitude, he could only nod helplessly and say,””Yes! Old commander, we’ll be going back first!” “Go, go!” Eccentric song waved his hand. Huang Fang brought his subordinates and drove away with Xu Wu. They left the Mercedes – Benz car behind and handed the car keys to Xia ruofei. After Huang Fang and the others left, the shop suddenly became much quieter. However, Huang Fang and the others had surrounded the store just now, and this was the main street of the town, so they had already attracted some people to watch. “Yusheng, close the shop. We’re not open for business today!” Li Zhifu said to his son – in – Law. “Alright, dad!” Niu Yusheng hurriedly responded and went over to pull down the rolling curtain Door. “Little song, let’s go upstairs and have a seat!” Li Zhifu said,”I’ll make you some tea!” “Alright!” Elder song laughed and said,”it’s been 30 years since I’ve had brother Fu’s tea ...” Then, elder song said to Xia ruofei and the rest,””Little Xia, you guys are in for a treat today! Brother Fu’s tea – making skills are top – notch. The tea at his house can’t be bought outside even if you have money!” “This is all thanks to the Bureau chief! Then we’ll have to have a good taste!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Everyone, let’s go upstairs and sit!” Li Guizhi greeted him enthusiastically. “Alright, let’s go!” Li Zhifu turned around and led the way. When elder song saw the back of li Zhifu’s head, his face couldn’t help but change slightly.
