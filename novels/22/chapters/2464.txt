Song Wei’s tone turned cold. “I’m sorry, Mr. Zhou. I’m afraid that’s not very convenient!”

Ling Yun furrowed his brows slightly and said,”Zhou Yuan ...”

Zhou Yuan turned to look at Ling Yun and smiled. Young master Yun, I just want to be friends with miss song. I don’t have any other intentions.”

After he finished speaking, Zhou Yuan looked at Song Wei and said with a smile,””It seems that miss song is still a little wary of me. Actually, there’s no need to. I really want to be friends with you. You’ll know in the future that I, Zhou Yuan, am absolutely sincere to my friends!”

He did not wait for Song Wei to say anything and immediately continued,”Miss song, it’s fine if you don’t want to exchange WeChat numbers with me. Since we’re fated to meet, I’d like to give miss song a small gift!”

Ling Yun didn’t know what Zhou Yuan was up to, but he didn’t stop him since he didn’t pester him.

Zhou Yuan looked around and raised his voice,””Where’s the person in charge of this club? Is there anyone in charge? come over!”

Xia ruofei had been sitting and watching the show for a long time and was already bored. He stood up and walked over.”Mr. Zhou, I’m a shareholder of the Paradise Club, so I have some say in this club, right? Do you need something?”

Zhou Yuan took a look at Xia ruofei and found that he was very unfamiliar. His first impression was that Xia ruofei was not one of those rich people he knew and thought that he should be someone who helped the boss of the club.

Hence, Zhou Yuan said indifferently,”you are the person in charge of the Paradise society!” Miss Song Wei should have a membership card, right?”

Xia ruofei’s eyes revealed a trace of interest. He said calmly,””Of course!”

“It’s good! I was worried that you didn’t give miss song a membership card! That’s a huge mistake!” Zhou Yuan said exaggeratedly. He then glanced at Xia ruofei and said indifferently,”top up one million Yuan to miss song’s membership card. I’ll pay for it!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He couldn’t help but smile and look at Song Wei.

Song Wei glared at Xia ruofei with a threatening look in her eyes.

“Mr. Zhou, right?” Xia ruofei asked seriously. I’m sorry! I can’t do this ...”

Zhou Yuan frowned and asked,”what’s going on?” Ah? Aren’t you the person in charge of the Paradise gathering? Why can’t you even do something as small as topping up? Then find someone who has the final say!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It doesn’t matter who comes. If it can’t be done, it can’t be done.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“What kind of attitude is this?” Zhou Yuan was a little angry, especially when he saw the half – Smile on Xia ruofei’s face, which seemed to have a trace of ridicule. He was even more furious,”let me tell you, I have a very good relationship with your paradise Association’s director Zhao! Think carefully before you speak. Now that the economy is in a slump, it’s not easy to find a job!”

“I’m also a shareholder of the Paradise society, so I don’t need to find a job.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You!” Zhou Yuan was at a loss for words. After a long while, he finally said angrily,”alright! Then tell me, why can’t I top up? Don’t tell me that your club doesn’t accept members ‘pre – payment? If you don’t give me an explanation today, I’m going to have a good talk with President Zhao!”

Zhou Yuan had mentioned the name “President Zhao” twice. Xia ruofei guessed that this “President Zhao” should be Zhao Yongjun. After all, Zhao Yongjun and Zhou leiyun were close friends!

However, Xia ruofei did not care about this kind of threat. It was just a joke.

In fact, Xia ruofei was also bored and wanted to tease this idiot rich man.

Xia ruofei shrugged his shoulders and said with an innocent look,””The reason is simple! Weiwei is a diamond card Member of Paradise Club, and it’s a custom – made card issued by the shareholders. All her expenses in Paradise Club are free, so she naturally doesn’t need to top up!”

Of course, Xia ruofei was just making up the so – called custom – made card. However, it was not fake. Xia ruofei was prepared to mention it to Zhao Yongjun after the opening ceremony. In the future, Song Wei’s expenses here would be directly on his account.

Ling Qingxue’s card could also be used to pay for the expenses. Since the Ling family was a shareholder, Xia ruofei had to treat her equally. Song Wei, on the other hand, enjoyed the same treatment.

Zhou Yuan’s originally angry expression suddenly froze, as if someone had grabbed his neck. That expression was simply too interesting.

Ling Yun had been watching the show and felt that Xia ruofei looked familiar, but he couldn’t put his finger on it.

Ling Yun hadn’t been in Beijing for a long time. His father had been working with song Qiming in a southwest province. That was why Ling Yun knew Song Wei. Actually, Song Wei didn’t interact much with the rich kids in Beijing. Many of the rich kids only knew about Song Wei and didn’t meet her often.

Ling Yun’s father had been transferred back to Beijing to work more than half a year ago, and his rank was the same as song Qiming.

Of course, the Ling family’s power was not limited to Ling Yun’s father. In reality, the Ling family was also a prominent family in Beijing. Compared to the song family and the Liu family, the difference wasn’t that great. However, Ling Yun had followed his father from a young age to travel all over the country, so he didn’t have much contact with the rich and powerful in Beijing.
