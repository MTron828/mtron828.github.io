Xia ruofei wanted to take the time array flag. Song Wei was already at Qi disciple Level 4 and her spiritual power had reached the spirit throb stage. Hence, when Ling Qingxue cultivated, she would definitely need the time array flag. Otherwise, it would be difficult to catch up with Song Wei’s progress.

Hence, Xia ruofei had no intention of hiding the existence of the time array flag from Ling Qingxue.

He left his bedroom and walked around the room next door. He took out the time array flag from the space and cultivated the heart concentrating grass. The time array flag was idle for the time being.

Xia ruofei returned to his bedroom with the entire set of array flags.

Song Wei looked at the small flag in Xia ruofei’s hand and asked curiously,””RUO Fei, What is this?”

“You’ve seen the magical power of cultivators last time. Today, I’ll show you an even more magical ability ...”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything. He waved his hand and threw out the array flags. Each flag landed accurately in their position. Now, Xia ruofei could set up an array with the array flags in one thought. He was quite familiar with it. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Then, Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand and walked towards the time formation.

Ling Qingxue was still a little confused. She didn’t know what these small flags were for.

As he walked towards the formation, Xia ruofei waved his hand and a tissue box on the bedside table flew over and landed in his hand.

Then, Xia ruofei held onto Ling Qingxue’s soft hand and stepped into the time formation. At the same time, he casually threw the tissue box up.

After entering the formation, Ling Qingxue didn’t feel any change in the flow of time. In fact, for the people inside the formation, the flow of time was still one to one.

Xia ruofei laughed as he pointed at them.””Look!”

Ling Qingxue looked in the direction of Xia ruofei’s finger and saw that the tissue box seemed to have frozen in the air. Her eyes widened in shock.

However, Xia ruofei could even teleport from a distance, so it should not be difficult to control a small tissue box in the air. This was what Ling Qingxue was thinking at the moment.

Xia ruofei had also guessed Ling Qingxue’s thoughts. He smiled and said,””I didn’t do anything!”

“How is that possible?” Ling Qingxue cried out involuntarily. She stared at the tissue box in disbelief.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”use your imagination. Also, observe carefully ...”

Ling Qingxue looked at the tissue box in confusion. After a closer look, she realized that it was not floating in the air, but was falling at an extremely slow speed. Suddenly, an idea came to her mind.

“Time!” Ling Qingxue’s face was full of shock.””RUO Fei, you can actually control the flow of time!”

“Not me, but these array flags ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.

Ling Qingxue looked at the flags that formed the array and couldn’t help but exclaim,””It looks like an unremarkable flag! To be able to control the flow of time ... This is simply too amazing!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”These time array flags are naturally made by cultivators. You’ll know in the future that arrays are also a very important branch of cultivation, especially arrays of time and space. It’s quite difficult. Anyway, with my current cultivation, I’m far from being able to touch the high – Level rules of time, let alone making array flags that low – Level cultivators can use!”

Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and asked,””RUO Fei, how many times can this formation change the flow of time?”

Xia ruofei said,”the limit is about 100 times. It has a lot to do with the range of the formation. The bigger the range, the worse the effect.” For example, the current formation had a time acceleration of about 70 to 80 times! So, a second outside is equivalent to one or two minutes inside the formation. ”

When the two of them entered the time circle, the tissue box had just fallen from the highest point. In the outside world, the process of falling to the ground took about two to three seconds, which was about four to five minutes in the time circle.

The two of them had been talking for a while, but the tissue box had only dropped a little. The whole process was quite slow, and if one didn’t look carefully, they wouldn’t even notice the change in its position.

Ling Qingxue did some quick calculations and cheered,””So, if we keep cultivating in the time formation, the efficiency will be 70 or 80 times higher?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””In theory, yes, but there are two problems. One is that the time we experience is actually synchronized with the time in the formation. If you stay in the formation for a long time, you will age very quickly compared to the time in the outside world. For example, if you stay in the formation for a year in the outside world, you will actually have spent seventy or eighty years in the outside world. When you leave the formation, your family and friends may not have changed much, and you will already be a hundred years old ... Of course, this is an extreme situation. How could he possibly stay in this tiny formation for seventy to eighty years?”

“You just mentioned two problems. What are the other problems?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Xia ruofei said,”the second problem is that even if you don’t mind staying in this small array for a long time, you can’t continue to cultivate. Your mind won’t be able to take it. Besides, people need to eat, drink, and pee, right?” Also, I’ve always emphasized that cultivation needs a balance between tension and relaxation, just like a rubber band. If it’s always tight, the final result will definitely be breaking. ”
