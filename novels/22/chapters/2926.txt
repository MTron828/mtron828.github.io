2927 Execution (1)

ERAD’s heart thumped wildly. He knew that things were bad, and he subconsciously reached for his waist. Only then did he remember that he had handed over all his weapons at the door.

ERAD quickly stepped back. He was standing at the door of the meeting room. If he took a step back, he would be able to come to the corridor outside, hide in the blind spot of the bullets, and have a chance to grab his pistol from the bodyguard.

However, before he could take a step forward, he felt a gun at the back of his head. The cold muzzle made his heart turn cold.

It was the two bodyguards who had pointed their guns at him.

Manino had already planned this out. The moment ERAD walked into the meeting room, the outcome was already decided.

“Eira, take two steps forward, then slowly raise your hands above your head!” Manino said coldly. I know you’re good at fighting, so you’d better not play any tricks, or I’ll shoot you immediately!”

Manino saw that the bodyguards behind ERAD were too close to him, and he was worried that something might happen. If ERAD snatched a gun, the few of them on his side would be in trouble.

ERAD’s face was dark as he carefully took two steps forward and slowly raised his hand as Manino had asked.

“Mr. Manino,” he said angrily.”What are you doing?”

Manino’s gun was still pointed at ERAD. He shrugged and said,””I’m just carrying out Mr. Goodman’s orders!”

“This is impossible! I didn’t do anything to let Bay group down, why would Mr. Goodman suddenly want you to deal with me?” ERAD shouted,”you must be using this matter to deliberately eliminate dissidents! Manino, you’re jealous that I have more room for development in the group than you! You’re afraid that I’ll climb above you in the future, right?”

“ERAD, I’m not as dirty as you think!” “I don’t care if you do well or not,” Manino said calmly.”As long as you work for me, I won’t make things difficult for you. Believe it or not, this has nothing to do with me. I’m just following orders. I hope you don’t blame me!”

“Hmph! Are you lying to a kid?” ERAD sneered.”After I was in charge of the business in the state of vilacrus, my performance was booming, and I soon became one of the best in the Northeast region. You’re trying to suppress me because you’re afraid that I’ll threaten your position! I want to talk to Mr. Goodman! I’m going to expose your shameless lies!”

Manino could not help but feel sad for ERAD when he saw that he still did not understand the situation.

However, ERAD had never been one of his people from the start. The two of them only had a working relationship, and Manino was not interested in explaining too much to ERAD.

He gestured to one of the bodyguards behind him, and the bodyguard immediately nodded. He quickly took out a handheld camera from his bag, turned it on, and stood to the side to record.

Seeing this, ERAD couldn’t help but widen his eyes, revealing a look of disbelief.

He knew all too well what the bodyguard’s actions meant. He had done it more than once.

Every time he wanted to kill someone and needed to record the video for the higher – ups to record, he would get someone to record the whole process.

The Gulf Group was rampant in Mexico was not worried that the video would be leaked as evidence of murder.

Of course, the Bay group’s internal management was also very strict, and this kind of information was highly confidential. The possibility of it being leaked was very low.

“What ... What are you doing?” ERAD finally panicked a little.

Even if Manino had pointed a gun at him, ERAD had never thought that the corporation would carry out an internal purge on him. He believed that the most serious situation would be him being locked up by Manino, or even being tortured to a certain extent so that Manino could obtain a statement that was not beneficial to him.

It was only when the bodyguard took out the camera and started recording that ERAD realized that Manino was going to kill him directly.

Manino loaded the gun and said,””ERAD, I’ve said it before, I’m only carrying out Mr. Goodman’s orders! I don’t know anything about it, so there’s no point in you asking me!”

“No! Wait a minute!” In front of the shadow of death, ERAD was so scared that he shouted,”Manino, you dare to lie to Mr. Goodman! Do you know what the consequences are for killing me without permission? Don’t do anything stupid!”

“It’s none of my business whether you believe it or not. I’ve told you, this is an order from Mr. Goodman.” Manino raised his gun and aimed at ERAD’s heart.”I’m not telling you this to fake Mr. Goodman’s orders. I just hope you don’t blame me. Of course, there’s nothing you can do if you don’t believe me. If you have any grievances, you can talk about it after you see Satan!”

“No...” ERAD shouted.”I want to talk to Mr. Goodman! Even if you want me to die! Let me die with an understanding! I want to know ...”

I’m sorry, Mr. Goodman doesn’t have time to talk to you.” Said Manino.

His finger was already on the trigger, and he was slowly pulling back. ERAD was so scared that his whole body was trembling, and his heart was filled with despair.

At this moment, Manino’s phone rang. He glanced at ERAD, thought for a moment, and handed the gun to another bodyguard.””Keep an eye on him. Don’t even blink. If he makes any strange movements, don’t hesitate and shoot him to death!”

“Yes! Mr. Manino!” The bodyguard quickly said.

Manino picked up his phone and saw that it was from Goodman. He picked it up immediately and said,””Mr. Goodman!”

Goodman was a little impatient.””How’s the matter?”

“I have him under control,” said Manino quickly.”I was just about to execute the plan!”

When ERAD heard Manino’s words, he knew that it was Goodman on the phone. He quickly shouted,””Mr. Goodman! Mr. Goodman! I’m ERAD! Manino said you ordered him to kill me! This must be a misunderstanding! It must be a misunderstanding!”

ERAD’s strong desire to live made him try to make a final struggle, but he was also afraid that the bodyguard would really shoot, so although he shouted, his body did not move, and he still stood in place with his hands raised.

“Manino,” Goodman said unhappily,”hurry up and take care of him!” Then send me the videos and photos!”

“Alright, Mr. Goodman!” Manino replied.

Just as Manino was about to hang up, Goodman hesitated and said,””I won’t be talking to ERAD. Tell him that he has offended someone he shouldn’t have, and he must use his life to calm the other party’s anger! However, since he has been risking his life for the group all these years, after his death, this matter will end here and his family will not be implicated. ”

“Understood!” “Mr. Goodman, you’re too kind!” Manino said.

“Hurry up and execute it!” Goodman said, then hung up.

Manino casually threw his phone on the conference table, then took the pistol from the bodyguard. He shrugged and said to ERAD,””As you can see, Mr. Goodman doesn’t want to talk to you. However, he asked me to pass you a message ...”

It was as if ERAD had grabbed onto a life – saving straw, and he quickly asked,””What did Mr. Goodman say? Did he order you to detain me first?”

Manino looked at ERAD with a hint of pity and said,””Stop dreaming ... Listen carefully, Mr. Goodman’s original words were: You’ve offended someone you shouldn’t have, and you must use your life to appease the other party’s anger. However, since you’ve been risking your life for the group all these years, I’ll let this matter rest after you die, and I won’t harm your family!”

After hearing this, ERAD’s entire body went limp, and he muttered with listless eyes,””Why? Why is it like this?”

ERAD really couldn’t accept such an ending. This morning, he had come to kuachakuros in high spirits to inspect it, which was to help Madel trample on the weak Chinese people. He didn’t expect that he would first suffer the greatest humiliation of his life in the hands of the Chinese, and then the group actually wanted to carry out an internal purge of him, even losing his life in kuachakuros.

When ERAD set off today, he definitely didn’t think that he had already embarked on a road of no return.

Manino did not say anything more to ERAD. He raised his gun again and aimed at ERAD’s heart from a few meters away. Under ERAD’s eyes that were intertwined with fear, pleading, and despair, he pulled the trigger without hesitation.

Bang!

ERAD’s eyes suddenly widened, and he clutched his chest as he slowly fell to the ground. Then, he twitched a few times, and then completely stopped breathing.

Beneath him, a pool of blood was silently spreading ... Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Holding the gun in one hand, Manino carefully walked up to ERAD. He reached out and touched his neck, then opened his eyelids to observe his pupils. He finally confirmed that ERAD was completely dead, and he heaved a sigh of relief.

ERAD’s mobility was very strong, and although Manino was very confident in his marksmanship, he was still afraid of the unexpected.

...

Originally, he definitely wouldn’t do this kind of thing by himself. A gentleman doesn’t stand under a dangerous wall! However, the entire internal purge mission was recorded, and Goodman was waiting to see it. He had to do it himself, even if it was dangerous.

Fortunately, nothing unexpected happened.

Manino stood up and threw the gun to one of the bodyguards. He then took out a silk scarf from the pocket of his suit and wiped his hands elegantly. He said to the bodyguard,””Go take a few photos, then immediately release the video and photos!”

“Yes! Mr. Manino!”

The bodyguard quickly came to the side of irade’s body and took a few photos from different angles. Then, he also extracted the video he had just taken from the camera and saved it on his laptop.

Manino took the laptop. He was a little hesitant. At first, he wanted to edit out the video from the time when Goodman called, but on second thought, he felt that the video couldn’t have any traces of editing. It had to be original. Even if he wanted to edit it, it would be up to Goodman.

So, he compressed the photos and videos and sent them to Goodman through an internal email account of the Bay group.

After sending the email, Manino quickly called Goodman and respectfully reported the situation on his side. He also told him that the video and photos had been sent.

“Very good!” Goodman replied. Manino, you stay in quachakurakos to clean up the mess. Also, you must protect the safety of that Chinese shipping company!”

“I understand! Mr. Goodman!” Manino said hurriedly.
