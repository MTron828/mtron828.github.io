3067  Rising Dragon medallion (2)

  Scholar Yuntai paused and continued,""However, this strange characteristic made the rising Dragon   Xia ruofei smiled and said,"you said to try to copy the floating Points and then dismantle them immediately."

  "Yes, yes, yes!" Scholar Yuntai said,"make a copy of the floating point, disassemble it into a token, and then immediately put it back together. At this time, the floating point's position would not change. In the end, after some research, it seems that the floating point's position changes periodically. The cycle is about 50 years ... Every 50 years, the floating point's position will change completely from the last time!"

  "I see ..." Xia ruofei said thoughtfully,"it seems that this Fu point is where the secret is."

  "We also know that!" Scholar Yuntai said with a smile,"however, there is no pattern to these FUO points. Some cultivators have spent hundreds of years studying the FUO points of more than 10 or 20 different FUO points, but in the end, they found nothing. So, don't have too much hope ... Of course, you only have one command token right now, and I don't know when all five command tokens will appear!"

  Senior Yuntai, the other four Rising Dragon tokens have appeared." Xia ruofei said,"the only missing one. I didn't expect it to be in my small space ..."

  "Oh, really? In other words, the rising Dragon Token has reappeared?" Scholar Yuntai said with great interest,"if you put the five tokens together, remember to make a copy of the floating point diagram. I'll study it when I'm free."

  In fact, in the era where layman Yuntai lived, many cultivators were devoted to studying the floating point distribution map. Although layman Yuntai was not obsessed with it, he had studied it for a while.

  Moreover, it was not easy to see a treasure that had once stirred up a storm in his era appear, so he also felt a sense of familiarity and closeness.

  In addition, he was currently in a spirit body state, so he could only live in the ore space, which was actually very boring. In this state, studying the floating point split layout could be considered a form of entertainment.

  "Yes!" Xia ruofei nodded and said,"if I can gather all the tokens, I'll definitely make a copy of the floating point diagram for Grand cloud elder to study!"

  "Alright, alright!" Said layman Yuntai. "After such a long time, you still can't find any results?" Xia ruofei asked in disbelief. "Indeed," Scholar Yuntai said,"what's even more surprising is that after almost 300 years, these five Rising Dragon orders all disappeared. Whether they were stored in a storage ring, in a secret room, or protected by layers of arrays, they all disappeared without exception, including the one in our sect. At that time, our sect leader thought that it had been stolen. After contacting the other forces with the rising Dragon Token, he found out that everyone's Rising Dragon Token had disappeared ..."

  "I can't believe there's such a thing ..." Xia ruofei could not help but frown.

  It had been more than three hundred years ... It had been about that long since venerable mountain river had placed the rising Dragon Order in the spirit map space. Didn't that mean that if this rule was still in effect, the rising Dragon Order could disappear at any time?

  "It's indeed very strange," said master Yuntai."And after the rising Dragon Token disappeared, it would appear in the cultivation world again after about ten years." It's also because of this that many sects and forces in the cultivation world have actually possessed the rising Dragon Token before. No matter which force has this token, everyone will gather together regularly and combine the tokens to study it, but there has been no progress. "

  Scholar Yuntai paused and continued,""However, this strange characteristic made the rising Dragon Token very famous in our era. Many people believe that the rising Dragon Token contains the secret of cultivating the ultimate great Dao. They believe that as long as they crack the secret of the rising Dragon Token, they will be able to do what the token's name says, like a fish leaping over the Dragon Gate and achieving the great Dao ..."

  Xia ruofei frowned and asked,"Senior Yuntai, have you ever seen the rising Dragon Token merge into one?"

  "I've seen him once!" Scholar Yuntai said,"as long as the five tokens appear within a certain range at the same time, they will automatically combine together and form a shape similar to the eight trigrams if there is no deliberate restriction on them. In addition to the words 'Rising Dragon', there were some other meaningless words. Everyone thinks that these Floating Points should contain the secret of 'Rising Dragon'. Some people have also copied it down and studied it carefully, but as I said, there was no result at all ..."

  "The most important thing is ..." Layman Yuntai continued,"everyone noticed that the floating Points on the rising Dragon Token seem to be different each time ..."

  "What?" Hearing this, Xia ruofei was even more surprised."Could it be that every time the five tokens are combined, the floating Points on them will change?" Is there any pattern to this?"

  "That's not it ..." Said layman Yuntai."We once tried to make a copy of the floating Points of the rising Dragon Order, and then immediately disassembled them ... Oh right, it's actually very simple to disassemble them. Basically, an early golden core cultivator can break them apart with a full blow and turn them back into five tokens. Where was I just now?"

  Yuntai was interrupted by him and forgot what he was saying.

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,"you said to try to copy the floating Points and then dismantle them immediately." "Yes, yes, yes!" Scholar Yuntai said,"make a copy of the floating point, disassemble it into a token, and then immediately put it back together. At this time, the floating point's position would not change. In the end, after some research, it seems that the floating point's position changes periodically. The cycle is about 50 years ... Every 50 years, the floating point's position will change completely from the last time!" Come down and immediately dismantle it. " "Yes, yes, yes!" Scholar Yuntai said,"make a copy of the floating point, disassemble it into a token, and then immediately put it back together. At this time, the floating point's position would not change. In the end, after some research, it seems that the floating point's position changes periodically. The cycle is about 50 years ...
