Chapter 225: Calming pill (1)

“Thank you for your concern, chief!” Xia ruofei quickly replied. He couldn’t help but sigh in his heart. What did he do to make elder song, a high – ranking official, personally care about a small matter like his medical qualification certificate? “You’re welcome. You’re worthy of that certificate.” “Oh, I heard from Zhengping that you had a conflict with Mr. Desheng’s grandson because of the emergency treatment yesterday?” elder song smiled and asked. Liang Desheng was the old master of the Liang family, and he was also Liang Haitao’s grandfather. “Chief, it was an emergency. If we didn’t treat you immediately, you might have been in a terrible situation ...” Xia ruofei said.”So, I didn’t care about the medical discipline and used a simpler and more violent way to deal with it. This is my problem. You can criticize me!” “Simple and crude?” Elder song couldn’t help but laugh,”that’s a good word! If it wasn’t for your simple and brutal actions, I would probably be in the eight Treasures mountain by now. You saved my life and I’m criticizing you? I, song Yaowu, am not an old fool!” “Chief, I didn’t mean it that way ...” Xia ruofei quickly said. Elder song waved his hand and said,”little Xia, Zhengping and Xiao Lu have reported to me what happened. You did the right thing.” You don’t have to worry about this, I’ve already told Zhengping that the song family will take care of the aftermath. We can’t let you be affected by this. ” “Thank you, chief!” Xia ruofei said. “If there’s anything you can’t do in the future, you can go to Zhengping or Zhiping.” Elder song said indifferently,”of course, the premise is that you have to operate according to the law.” “I understand. Thank you, chief.” Xia ruofei quickly said. Elder song was giving Xia ruofei a calming pill and returning the favor for saving his life. After that, elder song didn’t mention this matter again. Elder song had already learned about Xia ruofei’s background. It was because of Xia ruofei’s brilliant background in the Army that elder song admired him. He started to talk about the Army with Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei was naturally very interested in elder song’s legendary experience. He had long forgotten about manager Lu’s instructions and became a qualified fan. Fortunately, he had a porcelain bottle of petal solution with him and gave some to elder song in time. The diluted flower petal solution might not have an obvious effect on killing cancer cells, but it was quite effective in restoring the old man’s spirit. The old man and the young man chatted in the room for more than an hour before they ended the conversation. Xia ruofei left elder song’s room and saw manager Lu pacing back and forth anxiously. Seeing Xia ruofei, manager Lu quickly came up to him. He looked at the door and said in a low voice,””Doctor Xia, what took you so long? Didn’t you say that you’d advise the chief to rest well?” “Uh ...” Xia ruofei felt a little embarrassed and said,”I was talking to the chief about his condition! The chief didn’t say much ... That ... Manager Lu, I’ve already told the chief that his main task is to rest. Even if he wants to meet someone, it’s best not to exceed ten minutes. The chief has agreed. ” “Oh ... That’s good, that’s good ...” Manager Lu said.”By the way, the new Medical Group has arrived. I have arranged for them to stay on the first floor. Do you want to meet their main person in charge?” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”okay!” It’s fine to meet him. ” Soon, a man and a woman in their 30s were led to Xia ruofei’s room by manager Lu. “Doctor Xia, let me make the introductions.” Manager Lu said,”this is chief physician Zhou Jiaming, who is also the leader of the Bureau chief’s medical team. This is Dr. Su Xiaohong, the Deputy leader of the medical group. ” Manager Lu then said to doctor Zhou and doctor su,””Director Zhou, professor su, this is doctor Xia ruofei. This time, the chief’s treatment will be led by doctor Xia.” Zhou Jiaming and su Xiaohong had obviously received instructions from their superiors before they set off. They understood that their main focus in this mission was cooperation. Hence, they were very clear about their positions. Their attitudes towards Xia ruofei were very warm and they didn’t look down on him even though he was young. After exchanging a few pleasantries, everyone took their seats on the couches. “Doctor Xia, is there anything else you need us to cooperate with you on the treatment plan? we would like to hear your thoughts.” Zhou Jiaming said. Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”director Zhou, this treatment will be based on traditional Chinese medicine. We will no longer use chemotherapy and radiotherapy.” Chemotherapy for cancer was very harmful to the body. To put it bluntly, it was an indiscriminate attack. Whether it was good cells or cancer cells, they would all be killed. Xia ruofei would naturally not use it again. Moreover, elder song’s condition had gone through multiple chemotherapy sessions, which had proven to be ineffective. Zhou Jiaming and su Xiaohong had already expected this, so they didn’t show any surprise. They just nodded and waited for Xia ruofei to continue. Xia ruofei continued.”After giving the chief the fifth dose of Chinese medicine tomorrow, I will give him a diagnosis. From a Western perspective, you should also give him a full physical examination. According to the results, I will further adjust the prescription.” “Sure, no problem.” Zhou Jiaming said. “Some of the more effective anti – cancer drugs can be combined with Chinese medicine. As for which drugs to use, you guys are more professional than me. You can decide.” Xia ruofei said,”after that, I’ll do regular checkups for you. That’s the main thing.” Zhou Jiaming and su Xiaohong understood immediately. Their first task was to do a good index check for elder song and provide a reference for Xia ruofei’s treatment. Next, they needed to find some Western supplementary anti – cancer treatment. “Understood.” Zhou Jiaming said,”if there’s anything else you need, just let us know. We’ll do our best to cooperate.” “Director Zhou, you’re too kind.” Xia ruofei smiled.”Our goal is the same. We must work together to treat the chief.” Zhou Jiaming and su Xiaohong both nodded in agreement. After communicating with Xia ruofei, they were more confident and quickly got up to leave. It was a quiet night. The next morning, after breakfast, Xia ruofei made the fifth dose of Chinese medicine and sent it to elder song. About half an hour after taking the medicine, Xia ruofei estimated that the petals of the strange flower in the medicine should have been absorbed. He asked the doctors to come over and check on elder song. Some routine tests could be done directly, but one or two indicators had to be sent to Hongzhou for a checkup, mainly because of the limited conditions. Some large test equipment was definitely not available here. The results of the comprehensive examination were finally out by noon ...𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
