Chapter 587: Contract achieved (2)

President Lin laughed and said,”President Feng, you’re checkmating me!” You’re a lady and you’re already toasting, so how can I be casual!”

After that, President Lin also downed the wine very quickly.

After that, the welcome banquet finally got on track. Although the dishes were delicious, under Xia ruofei’s organization, everyone toasted each other while eating.

President Lin had a natural disadvantage. He only had a female assistant with him. Although those who could be brought out by him could hold their liquor as well, they were alone after all. Xia ruofei, Feng Jing, Xiao Qiang, pang Hao, and the others took turns to fight, and they quickly finished their glasses of wine.

The Drunken Eight Immortals wine had been left in the spatial dimension for a long time, so it had a very good taste. It was not bad in the mouth, but the aftertaste was also quite strong.

In addition, Xia ruofei had intentionally called Lei Hu and the rest, including Cao tieshu’s wife who worked in the kitchen, out. Everyone had a glass of wine, so President Lin and his female assistant quickly finished drinking. President Lin even started to speak with his tongue sticking out.

Xia ruofei saw that they were almost done drinking, so he asked pang Hao to arrange for President Lin and the other man to rest in the guest room upstairs.

He had also specifically asked the two girls from the finance department to take care of President Lin’s female assistant.

Feng Rao watched as Lei Hu and the rest escorted CEO Lin upstairs to rest. She smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, would you like to have a seat in my office?”

Xia ruofei knew that Feng Jing wanted to report on the negotiation today. He thought about it and said,””Let’s take a walk in the farm yard! I just got rid of the alcohol. ”

“Alright!” Feng Rao nodded in agreement.

Hence, the two of them walked out of the complex building together and strolled around the farm while talking. Pang Hao, Xiao Qiang, and the others naturally returned to their rooms to rest.

The night view of the farm was pretty good. The shadows of the trees swayed slightly under the street lights, and landscape lights were installed on the lawn. It was a peaceful and quiet scene.

......

Xia ruofei laughed as he walked.”President Feng, I can see that President Lin is very resentful! Are your conditions too harsh?”

“Isn’t that how negotiations work?”Feng Rao pursed her lips and smiled. It’s asking for a sky – High price, so I’ll just sit down and pay!”

“Hahaha! Tell me about the negotiation this afternoon!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Hence, Feng Jing started to report as she walked side by side with Xia ruofei.

It turned out that President Lin and the others were more inclined to the sales model, which was that they would buy it from the peach blossom company at a fixed price. After that, the sales would have nothing to do with the peach blossom company, and the money that could be sold would go to Tongren Hall.

Xia ruofei and Feng Jing had discussed this plan yesterday. In principle, Xia ruofei did not reject this cooperation model. Although the profit might be less, the risk would be transferred to Tongren Hall, and the payment would be recovered faster.

Therefore, Feng Jing didn’t insist on their cooperation and basically agreed with Tongren Hall’s opinion.

The difference between the two sides was the unit price and the annual supply of the Ironhide Kaede bucket.

President Lin hoped to buy from paradise Corporation at a price of 150000 Yuan per kilogram. He wanted as much as possible, and he also hoped to state in the contract that the annual supply would be at least 1.2 tons.

In fact, President Lin had made a plan before he came. He bought Xia ruofei’s iron – hide kaedeans at 150000 Yuan per kilogram. When Xia ruofei was in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province, he promised that he would buy no less than 900 kilograms of them a year.

The reason why he raised the supply threshold was naturally that President Lin hoped to develop its potential as much as possible. He wanted to acquire all of paradise corporation’s Ironhide fengdou products to Tongren Hall, forming an exclusive business situation, which was more beneficial to their pricing.

Feng Jing, on the other hand, offered 180000 Yuan per kilogram, and the minimum annual supply was 900 kilograms.

No matter what, Feng Jing refused to compromise on these two conditions. President Lin kept making concessions, but Feng Jing insisted.

What was even more shocking was that Feng Rao had asked her friends in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to find out more about the situation at Tongren Hall. She had obtained very accurate information that Tongren Hall was currently selling a top – grade iron – skinned maple bucket at 200000 Yuan per kilogram.

This iron – Skin maple bucket was packaged in the Tongren Hall’s packaging, and it also came with the test report of the Medical Research Institute, which showed that the content of dendrobe glucose and Dendi amine was far more than the general special products.

There was no doubt that this was the iron – hide maple that Xia ruofei had sold to CEO Lin a few days ago.

This was because Xia ruofei had said that there was only one Ironhide maple that could reach this standard in the market.

Hence, Feng Jing directly set the price at 180000 Yuan, which made President Lin very uncomfortable. This price was definitely profitable for Tongren Hall, but it was far from what President Lin had expected.

If Feng Jing agreed to at least 1.2 tons a year, CEO Lin might just grit his teeth and agree. But if it was only 900 kg, at the current price, he would be able to make about 12 million a year. After deducting labor costs, transportation costs, and taxes, this amount of profit was too little.

The key point was that President Lin couldn’t guarantee how many more tin kaedos the peach blossom company would have left. If the peach blossom company still had a lot of stock, the pricing power of Tongren Hall would be greatly weakened. This was what President Lin was worried about.

Xia ruofei listened carefully and laughed.”CEO Feng, no wonder CEO Lin looked like he was being trampled on after he came out. He’s really unlucky to have met a negotiator like you ...”
