Translator: 549690339

Ling Qingxue’s phone was on speaker mode. Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat when he heard Song Wei’s happy voice.

He said from the side,”Wei Wei, don’t worry!” We’re all fine! And this time, I’ve also gained a lot of benefits, and Qingxue’s cultivation has also broken through!”

Ling Qingxue quickly said,”Wei Wei, we brought back a lot of good stuff!” RUO Fei can’t wait to give it to you! Is it convenient on your side? We’re coming to find you now!”

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei. She was worried that Song Wei would be upset, so she did not want Xia ruofei to mention her breakthrough. She did not expect Xia ruofei to mention it so easily.

Xia ruofei chuckled at the side. He knew Song Wei well. Even though this gentle girl was competitive, she was not a narrow – minded person. She would be overjoyed if she heard that Ling Qingxue had a breakthrough.

“It’s convenient on my side!”Song Wei replied without hesitation. I’m just sorting out my thesis materials. 1 don’t have any class schedule, so I don’t usually have to attend classes!”

“That’s great!” Ling Qingxue said,”we’ll come over now! Right, where are you? We’ll meet up with you!”

“I’m in the school dormitory!” Song Wei said as she got out of bed to change her clothes. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Alright! Then let’s go directly to the dormitory’s roof!” Ling Qingxue said. Then, after a moment of silence, she said,”it will take us about 20 minutes to get here. You should tidy up a little. We’ll meet on the roof in 20 minutes!” “En!” Song Wei suppressed her excitement and said,”see you later!”

In reality, how could Song Wei sit still? After hanging up the phone, she quickly changed into her clothes and packed her things as quickly as possible.

Actually, there wasn’t much to organize. Some of her daily necessities, such as her clothes and toiletries, were all kept in the storage ring. So, she just put together the papers that she had been sorting out in the dormitory for the past two days and put them together with her laptop in the storage ring. It took less than five minutes to organize everything.

Song Wei opened the dormitory door and walked out. She immediately locked the door.

Master’s students had more freedom in their time. Their roommates had just started dating and rarely stayed in the dormitory. Everyone knew that Song Wei had a house in Beijing near the school, so no one would be surprised if Song Wei didn’t appear in the dormitory for a few days.

At this time of the day, the dormitory building must have been locked, including the door to the rooftop. For safety reasons, it had been locked for a long time.

However, for a cultivator in the refinement stage, this was not a problem.

After a while, Song Wei arrived at the dormitory’s rooftop. She had to climb up from the outside to reach the last floor. It looked dangerous, but it was not difficult at all.

At this time, it was already early winter in Beijing. The temperature outside was already below zero at night, and some places on the rooftop where water had accumulated had even frozen.

However, Song Wei did not feel the cold at all. Of course, after she started on the path of cultivation, this level of cold did not affect her at all. Even if she was not affected by the cold or heat, at least she had no problem wearing a thin layer of clothing to move around in this kind of weather.

As soon as Song Wei got on the rooftop, she looked up at the sky, her heart full of expectation.

In reality, Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue were still in the central region of Huaxia. They were on the black Phoenix flying ship and were flying towards the capital city.

The speed of the black Phoenix flying ship was extremely fast to begin with, and Xia ruofei was in a rush. Hence, he pushed the speed of the black Phoenix flying ship to its maximum, not caring about the consumption of origin crystals.

It took about 16 to 17 minutes for the black Phoenix flying ship to arrive in the sky above the capital city.

Xia ruofei was very familiar with the capital. Even though it was dark, he was still able to find the location of the capital University very quickly. He steered the black Phoenix flying boat and flew over quickly.

In fact, before the black Phoenix flying boat arrived at Capital University, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power had already discovered Song Wei’s eagerly anticipated figure on the rooftop of one of the female dormitories.

Xia ruofei’s heart warmed slightly, and the black – Phoenix flying ship sped up.

Song Wei maintained her posture of looking up. She did not feel cold or tired at all. She just felt that time passed very slowly.

Suddenly, a huge flying boat appeared out of thin air in the night sky. Then, it descended from the sky, almost covering the entire dormitory’s rooftop.

A bright smile bloomed on Song Wei’s cold face as she saw Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue standing on the deck of the airboat. Ling Qingxue was waving at her from the side of the airboat! Xia ruofei had a warm smile on his face as he stared at Song Wei without moving.

The black Phoenix flying ship was suspended about two meters above the rooftop. Before Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue could say anything, Song Wei had already tapped the ground lightly with the tip of her foot and leaped into the air, landing lightly on the deck of the Flying Ship.

“Qingxue!”

“Weiwei!”

The two girls held each other’s hands affectionately with tears in their eyes. They looked very excited.

Xia ruofei, who was standing at the side, was completely ignored. He cleared his throat awkwardly and said,”Can the two of you not show off your love in front of me? I’ll get jealous too ….”
