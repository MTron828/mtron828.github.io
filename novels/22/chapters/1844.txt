Chapter 1845: “Small gift”_2

Translator: 549690339

“We cultivators should respect our teachers and follow the path of Dao,” Li Yifu said seriously.”You’re senior granduncle’s cultivation partner, so you’re naturally my Grandmaster’s grandmother!”

Li Yifu could tell that Ling Qingxue was also at Qi disciple Level 1. Xia ruofei said that she was his girlfriend, so Li Yifu thought that Ling Qingxue must be Xia ruofei’s dual cultivation partner.

“Dao – companions?” Ling Qingxue didn’t quite understand.

Xia ruofei smiled and explained,”it means partner. This is what the cultivation world calls it!”

Then, Xia ruofei said to Li Yifu,””Foster husband, Qingxue only started cultivating yesterday. She doesn’t know much about the world of cultivation. You’ll scare her if you do this ...”

“What?” Li Yifu couldn’t help but cry out.

He had originally thought that Ling Qingxue and Xia ruofei were Dao partners. Moreover, Ling Qingxue’s cultivation level was not very high, so he did not pay much attention to her. However, according to Xia ruofei, Ling Qingxue had only been cultivating for a day or two, but her cultivation level had already been consolidated at the middle stage of Qi disciple Level 1. This cultivation speed was a little terrifying.

Li Yifu felt a little numb.

There was no need to talk about Xia ruofei. He was only in his early twenties and was already at Qi disciple Level 6. He was a genius among geniuses. As for Xia ruofei’s disciple, Tang Haoran, he was even more infuriating. A child was already at Qi disciple Level 2. Now, he had a Dao partner who was also very young. He actually used one or two days to cultivate to the middle of Qi disciple Level 1 ...

Was there anything that his senior granduncle could not do? Li Yifu said in his heart.

“Is there a problem?” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion.

“Please forgive me, Master’s grandmother. I heard from master’s granduncle that you’ve only been cultivating for a day or two, so I was shocked and lost my composure ...” Li Yifu quickly said.

“So, my cultivation speed is still okay?” Ling Qingxue asked, elated.

It’s more than just ‘alright’! He was simply a demon, alright? Li Yifu roared in his heart. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”Qingxue, your cultivation speed should be able to kill many cultivators in seconds. That’s why adopted husband was so shocked!” Of course, I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want you to be proud! After all, your cultivation is still very low. Do you know what cultivation base your adopted husband has reached? The middle stage of Qi disciple Level 4!”

Li Yifu quickly said,”Grandmaster, your disciple is ashamed!” I’ve lived for more than 80 years in vain. If it wasn’t for senior granduncle’s guidance last time, I’m afraid I would still be stuck at Qi disciple Level 3! Disciple would never dare to compare with a genius like martial grandmother ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”Okay, okay!” Don’t flatter her, she’s only at Qi disciple Level 1, she still has a long way to go!”

Ling Qingxue secretly made a face at Xia ruofei, but Li Yifu still saw it. However, the other party was his grandmother’s elder, so he could only lower his gaze awkwardly and pretend not to see it.

Xia ruofei said,”adopted husband, do you still remember what I said before?” When there are outsiders around, you are not allowed to call me senior granduncle or senior granduncle ... Just call me Mr. Xia or miss Ling, understand?”

“This disciple will obey!” Li Yifu said.

“Alright, come and sit!” Xia ruofei said.

The three of them sat down in the living room, and Li Yifu naturally sat at the last seat. He only dared to sit on half of his butt, his back straight.

Xia ruofei asked casually,”what kind of investment project is it?” You, a person who doesn’t care about worldly affairs, even personally came over?”

Li Yifu knew that Xia ruofei had seen through his thoughts. He smiled embarrassedly and said,””The Kyushu group is planning to invest in a hotel project in China with a total investment of 8 billion Chinese dollars ...”

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air. Li Yifu had rarely appeared in public in the past few years, so Ling Qingxue didn’t know that he had such a big business in the United States. She only felt that this old man’s aura was extraordinary.

I didn’t expect him to be the person in charge of the Kyushu group, and that he could easily invest billions of Chinese dollars. When she thought about how such a powerful person was so respectful to Xia ruofei and herself, Ling Qingxue felt that it was all the more surreal.

Even Xia ruofei couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows after hearing Li Yifu’s words. The investment amount was really not small.

Li Yifu quickly explained,” 8 billion is just the estimated investment amount for the entire project. This is a long – term plan. We can’t take out so much money in one go. In fact, we plan to open the Kyushu hotel in China. The first super five – Star Kyushu hotel is going to be located in Sanshan. So, this is the main reason we came here this time ...”

Xia ruofei looked at Li Yifu with a faint smile, as if he could see through his soul. Li Yifu could not help but feel guilty and could not help but smile awkwardly.

In order to ease his embarrassment, Li Yifu changed the topic as if he had just remembered something.””By the way, senior granduncle, this disciple has also brought a small gift for you. Please accept it ...”

“Oh? You even prepared a present for me?” Xia ruofei smiled casually and asked,”what is it? Take it out and let me see. ”

“Um ...” Li Yifu said awkwardly,”the gift is too big, so I can’t bring it with me. I’m still at Sanshan airport!”

“Woof! What did you get for me?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Last time in Australia, when you were chatting with Yitian, you mentioned the private jet ...” Li Yifu said.
