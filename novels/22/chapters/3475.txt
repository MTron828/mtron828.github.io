The murderer would always be killed. Since Shen tianfang could not control his greed and attacked Xia ruofei, he had to bear the worst consequences. Xia ruofei was right to kill him.

Chen Xuan’s eyes turned red as he mumbled,””It can’t be elder Shen… His cultivation is so high, and he has accumulated a lot of experience. He has so many life – saving means …”

“Brother Chen, you just went through the trial Pagoda, so you should know that sometimes, it’s useless to have many life – saving methods. If you’re unlucky, you’ll still die no matter how high your cultivation is.” Xia ruofei said,”the Tower of Trials is designed for cultivators of different cultivation levels. The difficulty of the missions will definitely be different. Therefore, everyone’s chances of survival in the Tower of Trials are almost the same.”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at mu Jianfei and continued,””Including elder mu Hua’s situation, I’m afraid it’s the same. I can only say that… Their luck is too bad! Brother Chen, brother Jianfei, we can’t delay any longer. We must leave this place as soon as possible!”

Everyone looked at mu Jianfei and Chen Xuan. If elder mu Hua of the surging waves sect couldn’t return, then mu Jianfei was the only one left. On the first heaven society’s side, Xu yurou, who was in the Qi refining stage, was already at a loss. As the young master, Chen Xuan naturally had the authority to make decisions.

Yang Liu also said,”nephew Chen, nephew mu, fellow Daoist Xia is right. Although no one wants to believe this is true, I’m very regretful… 1 hope the two of you can restrain your grief and accept your changes. Adjust your mentality as soon as possible. We must leave this Mystic realm immediately!” We don’t have much time left!”

Chen Xuan let out a long sigh before turning to look at the towering trial Pagoda. Finally, he steeled his heart and said,””Alright! Let’s go …”

“Let’s go!” Mu Jianfei sighed.

With that, Chen Xuan strode over to the door.

“Brother Chen, wait!” Xia ruofei quickly stopped him.

Chen Xuan stopped in his tracks and looked at Xia ruofei in confusion.

“Brother Chen, don’t forget that it’s a vacuum outside the secret realm …” Xia ruofei forced a smile.

Only then did Chen Xuan come to a sudden realization. In his state of shock, he didn’t think too much about it and walked straight towards the door. One had to know that he was on the surface of the moon!

As an Aurous core stage cultivator, Chen Xuan’s life would not be in any danger for a short period of time. However, if everyone followed him out, Xu yurou, Yu xiner, and the other Qi refinement stage cultivators would be in deep trouble.

“I’m sorry, everyone!” Chen Xuan said apologetically.’Tve suddenly heard of elder Shen’s death and I’m a little flustered …”

“I’m fine! “Xia ruofei smiled.

“Please put on your spacesuits and check each other’s airtight seal and oxygen storage,” he said.”If you don’t have enough oxygen, please replace the oxygen supply module before you leave!”

“Alright!”

“Thank you for your reminder, fellow Daoist Xia!”

Everyone took out their spacesuits and quickly put them on. They also helped each other check.

Xia ruofei checked Ling Qingxue’s spacesuit carefully, then patted her on the shoulder and gave her a thumbs up, indicating that everything was in place.

After everyone finished checking, they walked towards the light screen door one by one.

Willow volunteered to stay at the back to cover for everyone. In fact, Xia ruofei had the highest cultivation level now. However, no one could tell his cultivation level and Xia ruofei would not reveal it himself.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue followed behind Chen Xuan. The two of them held hands as they walked through the door.

After a slight pull, Xia ruofei suddenly felt his body become lighter. He looked at his surroundings and realized that he was on the moon’s surface. The moon’s gravity was only one – sixth of earth’s. Even though he was wearing a heavy EVA suit, he was still as light as a swallow on the moon’s surface.

Xia ruofei immediately looked to his side and saw Ling Qingxue standing there too. They were holding hands and they were not separated. He let out a sigh of relief.

If everyone was separated on the moon’s surface, the situation would become very complicated and dangerous. Although everyone had enough oxygen supply modules and their lives would not be in danger under normal circumstances, if there was an accident, the room for maneuver would be much smaller in such a vacuum environment.

Fortunately, nothing unexpected happened. Not only was Ling Qingxue by his side, but Chen Xuan and Xu yurou, who had come out earlier, were also nearby.

Xia ruofei waved at Chen Xuan and Ling Qingxue, then stood aside with Ling Qingxue, waiting for the other three to come out.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already realized that the place they were teleported to was not the place where they had entered the secret realm. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Perhaps the entrance to the mystic realm changed at any time, or it was possible that the entrance and exit were not together.

However, Xia ruofei was not worried. He had already passed all the levels and received the biggest reward. He did not need to enter the secret realm again.

As for returning to Earth, the blue Earth was hanging in the pure black sky and was so eye – catching. Looking at earth from the moon, it was three to four times bigger than the one seen on earth. Furthermore, there was no atmosphere blocking it, and they could directly see the huge earth in the deep Universe. It was very oppressive. Xia ruofei and the others just had to fly in the direction of earth. No matter what, they could not get lost.
