2943 A new beginning (2)

Xia ruofei brought Ma Jia to the apartment. Lin Yue was packing her things with light steps.

Although this Island was isolated overseas and far from the country, Lin Yue was in a rather happy mood at the moment. She and Ma Jia had been married for several years, and the total time they had been together was less than three months. To a young couple, the days of living in two different places were a huge torment, both physically and mentally.

Now, although she had to work far away from her home country, she could be with her lover. Moreover, the air on peach source Island was extremely fresh, and the scenery of the sea and sky made Lin Yue, who was born and raised inland, feel a sense of brightness in her eyes. Moreover, Xia ruofei had given them such a high salary. The money they earned in a month here was more than what she earned in a year working at the weather station in her hometown. The salary in the Army was not bad, but Ma Jia’s salary here was still several times higher than his.

With such good conditions, what reason was there to be unhappy?

When Lin Yue saw Xia ruofei and Ma Jia, she immediately put down the mop in her hand and greeted them with a smile.

“RUO Fei!” Lin Yue happily said,”the conditions here are really too good!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”as long as sister – in – Law is satisfied!” I was worried that it would be inconvenient to live on this Island! In the future, this will be your home on the Peach Blossom Island, so you have to decorate it well. If you need anything, just tell me, and I’ll find a way to get it. ”

The biggest problem on the Peach Blossom Island was that all the supplies were provided from outside the island. If there was anything lacking, there was no place to buy it. However, the conditions here were already enough to meet the basic needs of life. Some higher level of enjoyment had to be overcome for the time being.

Of course, ma su was Xia ruofei’s old company commander and had a different status in his heart. Hence, if they had any needs, Xia ruofei would still try his best to satisfy them.

Lin Yue quickly replied,”I don’t lack anything!” Before we left, you even asked the company to give each of us a box of daily necessities!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”there will be a small supermarket on the island in the future. You can buy whatever you need.” However, it’s definitely not as convenient as the interior. ”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already planned everything. When everything was on track, he would open a small supermarket on the island so that his employees could at least have a place to buy daily necessities. The scale of the supermarket did not need to be very large, and the items needed were not too complete. One or two employees would be enough to look after the store.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not rely on this small supermarket to make money. He would just treat it as an employee benefit.

As for the supplies in the supermarket, he had the spirit map space at hand, so it was easy to transport them over. In any case, Luo Qingfeng, Li Yifu, and the others all knew that he had a storage spiritual treasure with a large space, so he did not even need to hide it from others.

As for the ordinary employees, they didn’t have any suspicions. After all, there would be ships entering and Leaving Paradise Island every day, and there would be planes taking off and landing from time to time. Wasn’t it normal to transport some supplies?

After all, how could ordinary people get their hands on something like a storage treasure?

Lin Yue smiled and said,”I’m not worried about my life at all. There are so many people working and living on the island!” What I’m concerned about now is, when can you start work? With such a high salary, I think it’s a crime to be idle for a second!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sister – in – Law, you and the old company commander are really ... It’s not like we’re not one family!” If I didn’t remind you just now, the old company commander would have plunged into work and wouldn’t even know his family ...”

“You gave me such an important guard,” Ma Jia laughed.”I wouldn’t dare to relax!”

Lin Yue also said,”it’s the same whether he’s around or not!” I’ve gotten used to it after so many years! Besides, they were originally thousands of miles apart, but the entire Island was only this big now. Furthermore, he could still come home every three to five days, which was already very good! I didn’t even dare to think about it when he was in the Army!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sister – in – Law, since you’re so eager to go to work, then ... You can stay at home in the morning to pack up. I still have to hold a welcome party for everyone at noon!” I’ll have someone bring you to the weather station this afternoon! I’ll leave the weather control to you!”

“No problem!” Lin Yue readily said,”as long as you believe in my ability! I’ll definitely do a good job at the weather control station!”

“Of course I trust you!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”it’s hard to find a top student like sister – in – Law! I still remember that you were the old company commander’s fiancée back then. When you first came to the company, our old company commander was so proud of you! They’re praising you to the heavens!”

“There’s such a thing?” Lin Yue glanced at MA tuo with a smile that was not a smile and said,”he has never praised me in front of me!”

Ma Jia was a little embarrassed. She scratched her head and said,””How come you didn’t praise me? Didn’t I just praise your English?”

Xia ruofei and Lin Yue looked at each other and couldn’t help but laugh.

Xia ruofei said,”alright, I won’t be the third wheel!” Old company commander, sister – in – Law, I’ll be leaving first! Don’t forget that lunch will start at 11:30 sharp!”

Ma Jia also said,”I’ll go back to the guards first!” Everyone had just moved in, and there were a lot of things to do! I’m afraid that old Xu and the others will be too busy!”

“It can’t be!” Xia ruofei opened his eyes wide and said,”old company commander, aren’t you afraid of kneeling on the washing board tonight?”

Lin Yue chuckled and pushed Ma Jia away, saying,””Let’s go! Let’s go! Do you think I don’t understand him? How can he be idle at a time like this!”

“I can’t save you ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

Then, he threw the car keys to Ma Jia and said,””Old company commander, since you’re going back, you should drive the car back! Also, remember to organize everyone to come on time for the meal!”

“No problem!” Ma Jia nodded. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“By the way, the crew from Quto hasn’t left yet!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s all wear the same physical training suit! Don’t make them look like United States soldiers and scare them!”

“Hahaha! I understand!” Ma Jia said with a smile.

After Xia ruofei finished his instructions, he didn’t wait for Ma Jia. He waved at the two of them and quickly left. Although Ma Jia also said that she would return to the guards immediately, she couldn’t leave the couple alone! Xia ruofei’s emotional intelligence was not that low.

As expected, when Xia ruofei walked to the top of the stairs, Ma Jia did not go out. Instead, he heard Ma Jia softly explaining to Lin Yue that Jian Jia blamed his hearing for being too good. He did not deliberately eavesdrop, and the sound just drilled into his ears. There was nothing he could do about it.

In order to avoid hearing more R – rated content, Xia ruofei quickened his pace and closed his hearing temporarily. He quickly left the apartment building.

At noon, Xia ruofei held a welcome dinner for all the security guards in the big restaurant on the first floor of Lin Yue’s apartment. Other than the security guards, the flight crew of qiuhang and the staff who had arrived on the island earlier also participated in the meal.

The restaurant’s chefs were also the first batch of staff to be recruited. As they had to prepare meals for about 200 people, Li Yifu specially arranged for a few staff to help in the kitchen. Finally, the welcome banquet was held.

Although it was a welcome party, the security team members did not drink because they had just arrived on the island and had a lot of work to do. And the crew of qaustralia airlines were about to take off, so they naturally did not drink.

Hence, Xia ruofei asked his men to remove the alcohol and replace it with fruit juice.

Even though there was no wine, the atmosphere was quite good. The Veterans of the guard team all brought juice to toast Xia ruofei. Even qishang’s Nelson, Brook, and the others followed the local customs and toasted everywhere.

After the banquet ended, Brook and the rest bid farewell to Xia ruofei and flew the Boeing 757 back to Australia.

Ma Jia and the guards officially began to carry out the island’s defense duties.

Under Li Yifu’s arrangement, Lin Yue officially took over the weather control and began her first day of work on Peach Blossom Island.

For everyone, this was a new beginning.

Everything on the Paradise Island was slowly getting on the right track and would soon form a mature operating system.

Meanwhile, Xia ruofei was already preparing to leave Peach Blossom Island and return to China.
