Chapter 1268: Subverting one’s knowledge (1)

Translator: 549690339

The originally noisy scene suddenly quieted down.

The horse trainers and veterinarians were even more dumbfounded, unable to believe their eyes.

They had been with the “star of Hong Kong” for more than two years, so they knew his temperament like the back of their hands. He was not an easy horse to serve, and it was hard to control him normally. This time, he had suffered such a serious injury, and under the severe pain, it was impossible to comfort him.

Unexpectedly, this young man who knew nothing about horse racing didn’t seem to do anything. He just gently stroked the horse’s head a few times, and the “star of Hong Kong” calmed down.

They felt like they had seen a ghost.

Guo Hongjiang’s eyes widened, and he could not help but feel a glimmer of hope.

He did not dare to disturb Xia ruofei, so he pulled MA Xiong aside and asked in a low voice,””Chairman MA, is Mr. Xia good at animal taming?”

“I’m not too sure,” MA Xiong said with a bitter smile.”However, Xia Sheng has always been good at creating miracles. I won’t be surprised no matter what amazing things he does.”

Guo Hongjiang took a deep breath.

This was not a low evaluation, especially when it came from MA Xiong’s mouth. It was even more difficult.

Guo Hongjiang looked deeply at Xia ruofei, who was not far away, and his eyes shone with a strange light.

Xia ruofei didn’t know that his small action had already made Guo Hongjiang and his entire team look at him in a new light.

He just couldn’t bear to see the star of Hong Kong struggling in pain, so he released his spirit power to comfort it.

Xia ruofei didn’t understand animal language, but his spiritual power didn’t require verbal communication. Perhaps he couldn’t use his spiritual power to communicate with the “star of Hong Kong” in a complicated way, but he could still convey his goodwill and comfort.

Now that the star of Hong Kong had calmed down, Xia ruofei had to check on his wound.

Before the herbs arrived, Xia ruofei had to have a comprehensive understanding of the star of Hong Kong’s injury.

Therefore, while he continued to release his comforting and warm thoughts, he went around to the other side and walked directly behind the “star of Hong Kong”.

The horse’s leg on this side was very swollen, clearly caused by a fracture.

Xia ruofei slowly reached out to the swollen part. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Guo Hongjiang’s eyelids twitched when he saw this. He quickly said,””Mr. Xia, be careful ...”

He wasn’t worried that Xia ruofei would hurt the star of Hong Kong. Since Wan Wan had decided to let Xia ruofei deal with her, he wouldn’t interfere. It was just that the fracture was in extreme pain and he was worried that the star of Hong Kong would struggle again and hurt Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s alright. I’m just checking its injuries.”

“The medical team has just used a portable X – ray machine for an emergency examination,” Guo Hongjiang said quickly.”I’ll get someone to bring you the film.”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s okay, director Guo. I believe in my own abilities.”

Guo Hongjiang could not help but smile bitterly at MA Xiong.

This was the case for many Chinese doctors. Even though they had the assistance of various sophisticated instruments such as X – rays, CT scans, or even more sophisticated MRI scans, which could clearly show the parts that needed to be checked, many Chinese doctors still insisted on the traditional methods of looking, listening, asking, and feeling. Instrument examinations were only used as a supplement or verification.

“Mr. Xia, please be careful. The star of Hong Kong is very strong.” Guo Hongjiang said.

“I see. Thank you for the reminder, director Guo.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Everyone fixed their eyes on Xia ruofei, afraid that the “star of Hong Kong” would suddenly hurt someone. Although her body was fixed on the shelf, her leg, especially her injured leg, could not be completely tied.

However, what everyone was worried about did not happen.

Xia ruofei’s hand gently touched the swollen wound. The star of Hong Kong only trembled a little and then obediently lay on the shelf without even struggling.

Everyone present had a better understanding of horse racing than Xia ruofei. They could not help but be amazed at the scene.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were slightly closed. His movements seemed relaxed and casual, but in fact, he had already sent his spiritual power into the leg of the “star of Hong Kong”. The condition of the injury quickly appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind.

He pulled many muscles and ruptured tendons. Of course, the most serious one was a fracture.

The star of Hong Kong was not just dislocated. It was smashed on the leg by a horse that weighed almost the same as it. The calf bone in the middle of the three – Section spine was broken. The broken bone pierced into the muscle, and there was a lot of bone residue at the fracture. It was the most serious injury.

It was no wonder that after the medical team’s examination, they did not make any unnecessary attempts at all and directly proposed euthanasia.

According to normal zomanology experience, this was the least painful and most humane solution for the “star of Hong Kong.”

After checking the star of Hong Kong’s condition, Xia ruofei had an idea of what to do.

He opened his eyes and looked up at Guo Hongjiang.

Guo Hongjiang was also looking at Xia ruofei nervously. He asked,””Mr. Xia, how is it?”

Even though he did not believe that Xia ruofei could find out the situation just by touching him, he still had a glimmer of hope. After all, Xia ruofei’s way of comforting the “star of Hong Kong” was not something that even the most experienced trainer could do.
