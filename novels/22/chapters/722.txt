Chapter 723: The power of the Super – stimulant (2)

Hu ‘Zi’s mother’s eyes widened, and she revealed an excited expression. Her voice trembled as she asked,””Really?”

“How can it be fake?” Lin Qiao said proudly,”brother ruofei estimated the score with me! If the essay’s score is higher, it might exceed 610, or even 620!”

Her daughter was taking the college entrance examination this year, so Hu Zi’s mother knew a lot about the situation of the college entrance examination, so she naturally knew what this score meant.

After hearing Lin Qiao’s words, she said excitedly,””That’s great! Qiao’ er, it must be the blessing of your father and brother in heaven ...”

As she spoke, Hu Zi’s mother’s eyes were already filled with tears.

Although Lin Qiao wanted to say that it was all thanks to Xia ruofei’s super – stimulating agent, she couldn’t be so untimely. She looked at Xia ruofei and smiled, letting Hu Zi’s mother vent her emotions.

After Hu Zi’s mother had calmed down a little, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Aunty, you don’t have to worry anymore! I heard that this year’s college entrance examination is much more difficult than the previous years, and the cut – off point might be lower than last year’s by a few dozen points. Although it’s a little difficult for Qiao’ er to get into Tsinghua or Peking University with her results, she should be able to easily choose from most of the famous universities!”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother nodded heavily and said,””Don’t worry, don’t worry ...”

“Auntie! Make a few more dishes tonight!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I happen to have a few bottles of good white wine. Let’s have some tonight and celebrate with Qiao’ er!”

Xia ruofei was reminded of the bottle of Semillon wine he had bought in Australia. This wine was very unique. The taste of the newly brewed wine was not very good, but as it aged, the taste of Semillon would get better and better. This wine was very famous and was called “Hunter Valley’s commanding ray”.

After this batch of Semillon was transported back to the country, Xia ruofei had been storing it in the spirit map space. According to the outside world’s time, it had been more than ten years.

The spirit map space had an environment rich in spiritual energy. Xia ruofei was also looking forward to the amazing taste of this batch of Semillon wine.

Hu ‘er’s mother laughed and said,”good, good, good!” I’ll go prepare dinner now!”

......

Hu Zi’s mother went to the kitchen happily while Lin Qiao was still chatting with her classmates in the WeChat group.

She listened to Xia ruofei’s suggestion and didn’t disclose her estimated score. The score was too eye – catching. Under the circumstances where everyone’s performance was average, it was easy to attract hatred.

Xia ruofei saw that there was nothing for him to do at home, so he took lightning out and strolled around the farm.

The farm expansion project had entered the final stage. Xia ruofei took a tour of the construction site, and when it was almost time for dinner, she returned to the small villa with lightning.

Hu Zi’s mother had already prepared a sumptuous dinner.

Yesterday, after the two of them had moved into Taoyuan farm, Xia ruofei had taken out a lot of vegetables and fruits from his interspace. There were also big carps, chubs, and so on. They were all in the refrigerator, so there was a lot of food.

With such good ingredients, Hu Zi’s mother’s cooking skills were fully displayed. The table of dishes looked, smelled, and tasted great.

Xia ruofei went upstairs and took out two bottles of Semillon from the medium. Then, he came back down.

The three of them sat around happily. Xia ruofei opened a bottle of Semillon with a bottle opener and poured some wine for Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao. Then, he poured himself a glass.

Xia ruofei raised his cup and said,”Auntie, Qiao’ er, to celebrate Qiao’ er’s outstanding performance in the college entrance examination, let’s have a drink together!” I also wish that Qiao’ er can be admitted to an ideal University!”

“Good, good, good!” Hu ‘er’s mother laughed happily.

“Cheers!” Lin Qiao also said happily.

Everyone clinked their glasses and took a big gulp of white wine.

Xia ruofei realized that the aroma of this Semillon wine was very strong and the taste was clear. It was quite comfortable in the mouth.

After savoring it carefully, he could feel the fragrance of lemon sauce, toast, vanilla, honey, and other rich layers. It could be said that the texture was smooth and mellow, with a long aftertaste.

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up. When he visited West Winery in Australia, he had tasted a 15 – year – old Semillon and a newly brewed wine. At that time, he felt that the contrast was quite strong.

This time, the Semillon that he had stored in his storage space gave Xia ruofei a huge surprise. He felt that the Semillon that day was much better than the 15 – year – old wine he had tasted in Australia, be it in terms of taste or fragrance.

Not only did the spirit map space give them the taste of Semillon time, but it also allowed them to bathe in an environment rich with Reiki all year round, causing the wine in the bottle to undergo a pleasant change.

“Ruofei, this wine is quite good!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”it’s a little like the fruit wine we made in the past. It’s not choking at all.”

Lin Qiao also said,”brother ruofei, this wine smells so special!” It’s really good!”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”drink more if you like it. The alcohol content isn’t high.” By the way, I still have a lot of this wine. In the future, aunty can drink one or two glasses a day. Drinking an appropriate amount of wine is good for soothing the muscles and promoting blood circulation, and it also improves beauty!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Hu ‘Zi’s mother smiled and nodded.””Alright! It’s fine to drink a little less. ”

“Brother ruofei, I want to drink too!” Lin Qiao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei looked at Lin Qiao with affection and said,””Okay, okay, okay, I’ll put a box with you first, and you can drink a little every day! But don’t drink too much! Don’t blame me if you become a little drunk cat ...”

“Don’t look down on me, I can hold my liquor!” Lin Qiao said.

“Nonsense!” Hu Zi’s mother laughed and scolded,”why would a girl drink?”

“You’re right, Auntie. ” Xia ruofei also said seriously,”Qiao’ er, it’s okay to drink a little at home. It’s best not to drink outside.” Girls need to have self – Protection awareness. ”

Once Xia ruofei became serious, Lin Qiao didn’t dare to joke anymore. She nodded obediently and said,””Brother ruofei, I know. I won’t drink when I go out.”

Xia ruofei nodded in satisfaction and said,””That’s right! Come, come, come, let’s eat something! Have a good taste of auntie’s cooking!”

“Eat more!” Hu Zi’s mother chuckled and said,”this fish head is not bad. Ruofei, try it!”

Hu Zi’s mother gave Xia ruofei and Lin Qiao a lot of food, and the three of them had a great meal.

……

The next day, Li Jing, the sales manager of Dingfeng winery, rented a coaster car and brought some regional managers, store managers, and fruit area managers to Taoyuan farm to inspect the fruits.

Li Jing didn’t dare to ignore the instructions of the major shareholder of the winery and the group’s “son – in – Law.” He had made many calls yesterday and contacted all the business partners he could contact. He quickly organized an inspection team like today ‘s.

Xia ruofei personally brought the executives of the Super – Commercial channel to visit the orchard.

The appearance of the peach and lychee made everyone secretly nod in approval. After personally tasting them, everyone was full of praise.

If such top – grade fruits were placed on the shelves, it would definitely improve the quality of his supermarket!

Therefore, after tasting the Taoyuan fruit, these people in charge of the Super – merchants took the initiative to cooperate with Taoyuan farm to sell the premium organic fruits.

The southeast Region Manager of Walmart was the most anxious. He said directly,””President Xia, we’ll buy all the fruits your company produces this year! You can set the price! And I can promise on behalf of the General Manager of the Huaxia region that all the Walmart supermarkets in Huaxia will provide you with the best sales, including the thirteen Sam’s Club stores in the country!”
