Chapter 1652: Successfully taking down_2

The next thing was simple. The legal counsel of Tang real estate soon prepared the relevant transfer documents.

Xia ruofei’s Hengrui real estate took over the land of datang real estate at the price of 260 million Yuan. Of course, they also inherited all the rights and obligations of the land.

Zhao Yongjun and the others didn’t bring a full – time legal counsel, but Zhao Yongjun was still experienced in business. Plus, Zhao Yongjun also knew that they wouldn’t dare to play any tricks on the transfer contract even if they had a few guts. So Zhao Yongjun read the contract carefully from beginning to end, making sure there were no traps, and then handed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei skimmed through the book. He had already reached the spirit stage and his brain development was several times more developed than ordinary people. Hence, he did not miss out on any details even at this speed.

After confirming that there were no problems, Xia ruofei passed the contract to song Rui.

Song Rui was just putting on an act. However, he was also very careful.

After a round of inspection, the three of them nodded.

As the legal person of the company, Zhao Yongjun signed his name on the contract. Zhou Tianyu from Tang real estate signed on behalf of him. At the same time, as the partner of this project, Liu haofan also signed his name on the contract.

When Zhou Tianyu saw Zhao Yongjun take out the company seal from his bag, he laughed bitterly in his heart. Zhao Yongjun obviously came prepared, even the official seal was prepared in advance. The previous discussion about inspecting other plots of land was just a means of pressure.

But now that it had become a reality and he had gotten the approval of the company’s top management, Zhou Tianyu was too lazy to care so much. Anyway, it wasn’t his own money that he was losing.

After both parties signed and stamped, the transfer contract officially came into effect.

The contract gave a one – week deadline for the payment. As long as Hengrui Corporation transferred 260 million Yuan to the company account of datang real estate within the time limit, the deal would be officially closed.

After signing the contract, Zhou Tianyu smiled and shook hands with Xia ruofei and the other two. Then, he said,””Director Xia, director Zhao, young master Song, our company has prepared a table of wine for lunch. We would like to invite the three of you to come!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”forget about the meal. We still have to go back and raise money. Also, there’s a big problem with this land. We still don’t have a clue how to solve it!” I’ve been too busy ...”

“Chief Zhou, I appreciate your kind intentions!” Zhao Yongjun also smiled and said,”after we’re done with this, I’ll treat the two of you to a meal!”

Zhou Tianyu was just being polite out of courtesy. Since the other party rejected him, he naturally didn’t say anything more.

As for Liu haofan, although he had agreed to have lunch together, he couldn’t wait to go back now that the contract had been signed. Only a ghost would be willing to eat at the same table as song Rui! So he didn’t mention this matter again.

Hence, Xia ruofei and the other two kept the contract and left the property.

Liu haofan watched the three of them walk out of the meeting room. The polite smile on his face disappeared. He stared at song Rui’s figure with a cold smile on his face and his eyes became a little gloomy.

Previously, when they were bidding for the land, Liu haofan had been tricked by Xia ruofei and became a victim for no reason. In addition, he and song Rui had never been on good terms since they were young. With his arrogant character, how could he let go of the old grudge so easily?

However, he was also eager for someone to take over the land. In addition, the results of the investigation on Xia ruofei made him apprehensive, so he pretended to be polite. Now that the deal had been made, Liu haofan could not wait for Xia ruofei and the others to lose everything after buying the land!

At that time, he could also go and watch the joke ...

Xia ruofei and the others did not care about what Liu haofan was thinking! It was definitely a happy occasion for them to get this piece of land at such a low price. So, when they walked out of the elevator, their steps were a little light.

Of course, the three of them were still tense until Wu Qiang drove over to pick them up. After they got in the car and left Tang real estate, they cheered in unison and high – fived each other!

“Well done! RUO Fei!” Song Rui’s face was red with excitement. He had been holding back in the Tang real estate company for a long time, and now he could finally celebrate without restraint.

“Ruofei, I was really sweating at that time!” Zhao Yongjun also laughed and said,”you’re really too cruel in haggling!”

“The Mingmen is already in our hands, what’s there to worry about?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”what do you think? He had successfully taken down this piece of land! Let’s call Zi Xuan and the others for lunch and celebrate together!”

“It’s a must!” Song Rui immediately said,”Wuqiang, don’t go back to the courtyard house. Go to the private kitchen of the Wang Residence!” I’m so happy today! This meal is on this bro!”

Wu Qiang looked at Xia ruofei and saw him nodding his head. He then said,””Alright!”

He had lived and worked in the capital for several years and was familiar with the roads, so he didn’t turn on the GPS. He turned around at the intersection in front and drove in the direction of the Wang family’s private kitchen.

On the other side, song Rui had already called Xu Zixuan and the others, summoning them to meet at the Wang family’s private kitchen.

Xia ruofei sat in the front passenger seat and said to Zhao Yongjun,””Big brother Zhao, if that’s the case ... We’ll have to pay 260 million in cash in one go. Won’t we be a little short on funds then?”
