2247 A leisurely day (1)

After lunch, Xia ruofei wanted to help wash the dishes but Peng Chang and Zhang Xing fought to do all the work. He Jiong and Huang Lei also pulled Xia ruofei to make tea and chat. In fact, Xia ruofei did not think that doing this little work was very hard, but in He Jiong’s eyes, he was already “the most hardworking guest in history.”

This show was originally a leisurely reality show that focused on slow life. Everyone didn’t have any specific tasks, so after lunch, it became everyone’s leisure time.

Peng Chang and Zhang Xing also came over after cleaning up the dishes. The five of them gathered around the root – carved tea table, drinking tea and chatting.

The charming musky “lantern” and the two cute puppies played a game of chasing from time to time. The two sheep in the sheep pen moaned from time to time. It really felt like time had slowed down here.

In such an atmosphere, even the staff seemed to have subconsciously kept quiet. Only the camera was still working quietly.

The five of them sat on small bamboo chairs, sometimes laughing heartily, sometimes drinking fragrant tea, forming a beautiful picture on this warm winter afternoon.

After half a day of interaction, Xia ruofei had a good impression of the four permanent guests.

The four of them gave off the feeling of a family. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Huang Lei was the head of the family. The two young guests were a little afraid of him, but they also relied on him for a lot of things. He Jiong was more like a warm mother. He understood the sensitivity and gentleness of their hearts and melted you with warmth little by little. Zhang Xing and Peng Chang were brothers in the family. One was shy and gentle, while the other was weird ...

Xia ruofei was like a guest who came to visit this family.

Of course, Xia ruofei, as a guest, was not reserved at all. On the contrary, he enjoyed the atmosphere.

Everyone chatted for more than an hour. In the end, Huang Lei yawned and stood up.””I can’t take it anymore ... I have to take a nap. I woke up early today and I was a little sleepy when I was cooking!”

He Jiong said with a smile,”then hurry up and go rest, teacher Huang!” Don’t forget to make dinner!”

“You guys can order me around!” Huang Lei laughed as he scolded Xia ruofei. Then, he beckoned to Xia ruofei and walked into the mushroom hut. He went upstairs to rest.

“President Xia, do you want to take an afternoon nap as well?” He Jiong asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”Coming here is like a leisure trip. I’m not tired at all. I won’t rest ... Teacher he, is there anything else to do?” Give me some more!”

He Jiong was stunned for a moment, then he could not help but laugh out loud.”President Xia, you really can’t stay idle! The problem is that if you’re so diligent, won’t it make us even more lazy? What if your fans think that we’re exploiting you after the show airs?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”how is that possible?” Teacher he had a huge fan base! Don’t pull aggro for me!”

The two of them teased each other for a while. In the end, He Jiong did not give Xia ruofei any work to do.

After all, this was just a reality show. Arranging for the guests to do work was just the show’s effect. How could there really be so many things waiting for the guests to do?

Xia ruofei did not feel tired, so he brought the two dogs to the mushroom house for a walk. After all, it was his and his brothers ‘business, and it would be open to members in the near future.

Xiangnan TV had put a lot of thought into the location. The scenery near the mushroom house was very beautiful, especially the lake and the distant mountains. In addition, the area itself was covered by an array, so it was refreshing to walk on the road.

Of course, this was also due to the cooperation of the Paradise society. The mushroom house and the surrounding areas were all built first.

Now, the scenic Trail by the lake had been completed, all of which were built with anti – corrosion wood along the lakeside. The winding trail led to a quiet place, which had the effect of changing the scenery.

A cameraman was following them with a camera. Xia ruofei was walking with the two dogs. The winter afternoon sun shone on them, casting long shadows on them. The lake and mountains in the distance formed a beautiful picture.

Xia ruofei returned to the mushroom hut after a round of shopping. He sat under the pergola and made some tea. Then, he saw Huang Lei, who was on his afternoon break, walk out.

Huang Lei stood in the courtyard, stretching his chest a few times, and then yawned. He had obviously just woken up.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved at Huang Lei,””Huang Laoshi, how was your sleep?”

“Comfortable!” Huang Lei said,”the location of the mushroom house was really chosen correctly this time! I was worried that the environment around the capital wasn’t very good, and I was afraid that there would be fog or haze. After coming here, I realized that the air here is so fresh! It’s like the air is filled with sweetness!”

Xia ruofei laughed to himself. This was the effect of the formation he had set up.

It could be said that within the range of this array, even ordinary people would feel comfortable. Although the spiritual energy was invisible and intangible, it was a real existence. Under the infiltration of this invisible spiritual energy, the physical functions of the people inside the array would be subtly improved.

He was certain that Huang Lei and the other three would find themselves in much better condition after recording the show.

For the common sub – healthy state of urban people, this array was definitely a natural medicine. He believed that once the club was put into use, the members would soon experience the benefits.

At that time, the upper echelons of the capital would definitely rush to apply for membership.

Xia ruofei was very confident about this.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’ll naturally feel better if I get enough sleep!” Huang Laoshi, come over and have a cup of tea! It’s still a little early to prepare dinner!”

“It’s good to rest for a while ...” Huang Lei said.

He walked to the pergola and sat down opposite Xia ruofei.

The two of them chatted while drinking tea. Huang Lei was also a university teacher. He had been filming and travelling all these years. It could be said that he had seen a lot, so he chatted with Xia ruofei about many topics.

“President Xia, can we keep the remaining two of the Chinese perch you brought for lunch tomorrow?” Huang Lei asked,”there will be a new guest coming tomorrow. There aren’t many vegetables that can be brought out here, just the peach Garden vegetables in the greenhouse.”

Huang Lei had also considered the fact that Xia ruofei had brought the Chinese perch. He was supposed to finish them off with two meals today, but when he thought about the situation of “cooking without rice” tomorrow, he felt a headache.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”no problem!” You can keep it for later! Since it’s a gift for you, it’s naturally up to you to deal with it! This Chinese perch can be kept in the freezer for a long time. ”

“Thank you!” Huang Lei was overjoyed.”Then make one at noon tomorrow and ice the other one first.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

After the two of them chatted for a while, Huang Lei got up and prepared to make dinner. Xia ruofei saw that there was nothing to do, so he followed Huang Lei into the kitchen to help.

Huang Lei’s nickname of “Little Chef Huang” was not for nothing. He was simply dazzling in the kitchen, and Xia ruofei could not interfere.

In the end, it was Huang Lei who assigned Xia ruofei the task of making a fire.

The mushroom hut used the kind of stove in the countryside, which was divided into two big iron pots in front and back. The one in the front was used to stir – fry vegetables, and the pot in the back was filled with water.

After the fire in the stove was ignited, the smoke would pass through the pot at the back. The remaining heat of the flame would be used to heat the water in the pot so that hot water could be used at any time.

Xia ruofei used to use this kind of stove at home when he was young. It had been many years since he had seen it. At first glance, it felt very familiar.

At first, Huang Lei was worried that a rich man like Xia ruofei would not be able to do such menial work.

He did not expect Xia ruofei to be so familiar with starting a fire. He had helped adults with similar work when he was young. He had also been trained in setting up a stove in the wild and starting a fire in the Army. Hence, starting a fire was a piece of cake for Xia ruofei.

First, he placed a piece of wood of moderate size in it. Then, he used a lighter to light up the pine resin strip that was specially used to start a fire and placed it on the piece of wood. Then he picked the very dry and not very large pieces of wood and carefully put them in. He tried to make them as suspended as possible, forming a hole above the flame.

After closing the stove door, the flames in the stove hole suddenly rose up and burned fiercely with a whooshing sound.

Huang Lei was cooking at the side, instructing Xia ruofei to increase or decrease the amount of fire. Xia ruofei was not careless at all. When the fire needed to be heated, he added wood and closed the stove door tightly. When he needed to reduce the fire, he would open the stove door. If the fire was still too big, he would cover it with a stove ash shovel.

Xia ruofei’s work was very skillful. It was obvious that he had done this before.

Huang Lei laughed as he cooked,””I didn’t expect President Xia to use this kind of stove. It seems that you have a good life!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”The children of the poor grow up early. When I was young, every household used this kind of stove.”

Huang Lei gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up, and Xia ruofei also praised Huang Lei’s cooking skills. The two of them unconsciously started to “praise” each other.

Dinner was ready in no time, and Huang Lei called everyone over to bring the dishes out.

Because the temperature outside had dropped drastically at night, they didn’t have dinner under the gazebo, but in the small dining room inside the mushroom hut.

Although the ingredients available were limited, Huang Lei’s cooking skills made up for this. Everyone ate with relish and praised him.

After the meal, everyone worked together and quickly cleaned up the dishes and other things.

After that, they went to the scenic Trail by the lake for a walk to digest their food.

When the group returned to the mushroom house, the sky was already completely dark, and the busy day was almost over.

Xia ruofei followed He Jiong and the rest to the living room on the first floor of the mushroom hut. Everyone was sitting around the long table and chatting.

He Jiong, Huang Lei, Peng Chang, and Zhang Xing were all artistes and could be said to be multi – talented. However, they were also very considerate of Xia ruofei’s feelings and did not talk for long about the entertainment industry. As they chatted, He Jiong could not help but hum a song.

Huang Lei and the other two did not want to be outdone. They performed the shows they were good at. Zhang Xing also took the initiative to improvise a dance. He had developed his skills in Korea a few years ago. As a trainee, he had to learn everything, and he had spent a lot of time and effort on dance.

Huang Lei and he Jiong both sang a nostalgic song. Only Peng Chang had his signature bright smile on his face as he sat there and watched the show.

After he Jiong finished singing, he smiled and said,”Teacher Xia, you should sing a song too! The sound effects here are pretty good!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”I can’t sing. I can ‘T. I can’ t.”

Huang Lei, Peng Chang, and Zhang Xing were all jeering at the side. Even he Jiong, the good guy, extended a warm invitation to them.

Xia ruofei thought for a while.”I really can’t sing. How about ... I perform a magic trick for everyone?”
