2411 Personally taking action (1)

There were cooperation and conflicts between these big families, but everything had a bottom line and rules.

Directly finding an overseas assassin organization to assassinate a competitor was obviously beyond the scope of the agreed rules.

It was like everyone fighting for food in the same pot. They might use some means to interfere with each other, such as using words to influence each other, or a few people might work together, or even find an opportunity to break the other person’s scooping tools, etc. These were all within the scope of the rules.

However, when one of them suddenly broke the rules and killed the person who was snatching food from him, or smashed the pot, no one would tolerate it.

This was the nature of this matter, which was why eccentric song was so angry.

If all the families did this, or if others did the same, wouldn’t everyone be in danger?

If this was Liu haojun’s personal action, it would be fine. But if it reflected the will of the Liu family, then the matter was serious.

Of course, now that they had solid evidence, whether or not this matter was incited by the main figures of the Liu family, it would not be considered as Liu haojun’s personal action.

As an experienced man, elder song naturally knew what to do to maximize the benefits. In fact, he did not think that this was the Liu family’s behavior. Even if elder Liu did not have long to live, he would not be so crazy. Moreover, he had already seen the hope of survival and would not do anything to provoke the song family. After all, everyone in the family circle in Beijing knew about the relationship between Xia ruofei and the song family. Elder Liu had no reason to cut off his own path of survival.

However, at this point, the Liu family had no choice but to acknowledge it.

Eccentric song pondered for a moment before saying,”Ruofei, do you have the original data for this evidence?”

Elder song trusted Xia ruofei and believed that the evidence was not forged. However, if he wanted to confront the Liu family face to face, he would need the original evidence.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and nodded.””No problem!”

All the data was stored on the internal website of the mord organization and could be accessed directly through a fixed IP, provided that there was an encryption dog. Xia ruofei had all these in his hands, so it was not a problem to get the original information.

“Very good!” Eccentric song nodded. It’s a little late today. I’ll arrange for a reliable technical staff to meet you tomorrow and confirm the evidence. How about this ... You stay here tonight! Don’t run back and forth!”

“Okay, Grandpa song.” Xia ruofei said. Then, he asked,”Grandpa song, how ... Do you plan to deal with this?”

“The Liu family doesn’t follow the rules, so of course we have to talk it out!” Grandmaster song sneered. But don’t get involved in this matter. I’ll personally meet old Liu and bring my technical staff to show him the evidence on the spot. So, you must hand it over clearly tomorrow. ”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei nodded.

He knew that this was elder song’s way of protecting him. After he reported this matter to elder song, he couldn’t get involved at all. He had to draw a clear line between himself and elder song.

Elder song looked at Xia ruofei and said,””The Liu family’s actions will anger the public. If I release the evidence in my hands, they will be very passive and may even be unable to recover. So ... We’re in control now. Old Liu has to bleed a lot this time ...”

Xia ruofei nodded.”You’re here personally. There won’t be any problems.”

Elder song smiled and looked at Xia ruofei.””You don’t seem to be in high spirits!”

Xia ruofei laughed in embarrassment and said,””That’s not it ... It’s just that I think ... Liu haojun has crossed the line this time. If it were any other person, they would be in jail for a long time even if they didn’t die. But as the young master of the Liu family, I’m afraid that he’ll still be able to let it go easily! When I think about this, I feel a little uncomfortable ... And I feel that Liu haojun has completely lost his mind. A madman like that is actually very dangerous!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Elder song laughed and said,”ruofei, you’re feeling indignant for Qiming!” Do you also think that I’m a bad old man? I only think about benefits and balance, but I’ve never considered the feelings of Qiming and his family?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile. He didn’t expect elder song to know how to use internet slang. It seemed that this former high – Level leader was not out of touch with society.

He said,”I really don’t have that!” You’re far – sighted and consider the long – term and the big picture. I believe Secretary song will understand. ”

“You don’t have to pick the best words!” Elder song waved his hand. “Ruofei, you don’t have to worry too much about this. The Liu family probably won’t keep Liu haojun ...”

“Ah?” Xia ruofei could not help but cry out,”you mean ...”

“Based on my understanding of old Liu, he’ll be more decisive in dealing with it,” said elder song with a nod. “Your judgment is correct. Many details have shown that Liu haojun has gone completely crazy. The existence of such a person is not only a great threat to you and me, but also a huge hidden danger to the Liu family. He’s like a time bomb! Moreover, he had used underhanded means to kill Qiming. This matter could not be forgiven no matter what. The Liu family had to make their stance clear that this matter had nothing to do with the Liu family and was entirely Liu haojun’s own behavior. And what is the best way to express this attitude?”
