Moreover, once the news of Wu Lei’s entry into the squad list was reported, more fans paid attention to the game.

PP company also adjusted the server resources at the last minute. The facts proved that this decision was very correct. The kick – off started at midnight in China, but the live broadcast started at around 10 pm. For a full two hours, the guests and hosts were talking about football. There were also various short videos about Wu Lei, including highlights of his in the Chinese Super League, training scenes in Spain, and even some gossip outside the stadium, such as the group photo of the three of them in the restaurant that Xia ruofei posted on Weibo.

As soon as the live broadcast began, the number of people watching the live broadcast continued to increase. By 11 O’ clock, it had far exceeded the number of people watching the La Liga live broadcast at the same time. It was even more than the people watching the Derby. If the server resources had not been adjusted in advance, it would definitely be stuck now.

The judge whistled and the host, Shen fangjian, immediately said,””Hello, PP sports viewers, welcome to the live broadcast of the 23rd round of La Liga, Espanyol’s home game against valekano. Today, we have Jia Tianning, director Jia, and I, Shen fangjian, to bring you the commentary. With the whistle of the referee, the game has officially begun. Next, I will introduce the starting lineup of both teams. Later, we will also combine the game and ask director Jia to analyze the formation and tactics of both teams ...”

While the two players were introducing the starting lineup of both teams, the live broadcast camera swept over the substitutes ‘bench. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Of course, this was normal for the broadcast. The camera was actually aimed at the head coach, Ruby. However, Ruby was not sitting in his seat at the moment. Instead, he was standing on the sidelines, watching the situation of the game. When the camera was focused on Ruby, it happened to capture Wu Lei, who was sitting on the substitute seat behind him.

Shen fangjian immediately stopped introducing the starting lineup and said with some excitement,”We saw Wu Lei appear on the screen. His eyes were fixed on the field the whole time, and his eyes were full of desire for the game!”

Shen fangjian’s partner, Jia Tianning, sighed,””How long has it been since we’ve seen our Chinese players appear in the top league? I’m filled with all sorts of feelings after seeing this scene today!”

“Let’s hope Wu Lei has a chance to play in this match,”Shen fangjian said.

“It would be even better if we could score a goal!” Jia Tianning said.

Shen fangjian joked,”I don’t even dare to hope for it. As long as he can play, I think it’s a big victory. I’m already very satisfied that our Chinese players can appear in the LA Liga. Step by step, I believe Wu Lei will be able to stand firm in La Liga!”

Jia Tianning said seriously,”I think if Wu Lei plays, the hope of scoring is not small. First of all, it’s determined by his position. He’s a striker and the player closest to the opponent’s goal.” Secondly, Wu Lei’s unique characteristics and his excellent running skills determined that he would definitely get a good opportunity. Of course, it depends on the playing time the head coach gives him, the cooperation of his teammates, and Wu Lei’s own mentality ...”

As the host, Shen fangjian needed to control the process of the live broadcast. He couldn’t just say whatever came to his mind like Jia Tianning.

Shen fangjian felt that Jia Tianning was exaggerating, but the camera had already cut back to the scene, so he quickly said,””Let’s continue to watch the game. Coach Jia, what kind of tactics do you think valekano will use in this game?”

The two commentators continued to commentate on the match. At this time, the bullet screen of PP sports ‘live broadcast was about to explode. The netizens were expressing their opinions one after another.

“This is a bit too much! Don’t you know what Wu Lei’s level is?”

“These two commentators are also drunk. Just one scene and they can blow the sky out! Those who don’t know better would think that Wu Lei has already performed a hat – trick!”

“I’m certain that Wu Lei won’t be playing in this match!”

“The brother who said that Wu Lei can’t play is a little too sure. I think the RCD Espanyol will definitely let him go up symbolically for the Chinese market, but it must be during the garbage time when the game is about to end. Maybe he won’t even have time to touch the ball after he goes up and the referee will end the game, hahahaha!”

“Alright! Then I’ll take back what I just said and change it to this: If Wu Lei can get more than 15 minutes in this game, I’ll eat sh * t on a live broadcast! I’ll post this as proof!”

“He’s from the dock team, what level can he be? Didn’t Wu Lei get a three – piece set? Single blade, anti – aircraft cannon, hands over head to express regret!”

“That’s a very accurate summary. It’s simply a bloodbath!”

A bunch of netizens were ridiculing him, but there were also many netizens who couldn’t stand it and stood up to refute him.

“Can’t you guys just hope for the best? In any case, Wu Lei is the first Chinese player to enter the top league in the past decade, okay?”

“The one who criticized Wu Lei for throwing a solo blade, didn’t he think about why he could run away when others couldn ‘t? This means that his consciousness is stronger than others!”

“They are still defaming their own players at this time. Can’t the Chinese fans be more United? No matter which team you were a fan of, now that Wu Lei was overseas, he was representing the Chinese players. Although I don’t like the Shenggang team, I support Wu Lei unconditionally now!”

Everyone on the internet had their own opinions, and it was very lively.

There were also netizens who took Zhang Xizhe, a Chinese player who had transferred to the Bundesliga, as an example. At that time, after Zhang Xizhe transferred to the Bundesliga’s wolfburg, he had zero playing time for half a season, but he had participated in a lot of marketing activities outside the game. He was jokingly called “a car seller” and “a water dispenser keeper.” Many netizens concluded that Wu Lei’s biggest mission in the Spanish team was to “look at the water dispenser.”

Moreover, it also depended on the mood of the head coach. If he did not put Wu Lei on the list, then Wu Lei would not even have the right to look at the water dispenser.

The internet was noisy and the game was still going on. The Spanish team’s situation was a little bad. It had been less than half an hour since the game started and they were already behind 0 – 2. One of the two balls they had lost was a low – Level mistake by their defender and the other was a shot – bang world wave from the other side. The goalkeeper was powerless.

On the sidelines, the manager, Ruby, also frowned and looked at a loss.

At the 33rd minute of the game, the team’s main winger, Piatti, who was playing in the same position as Wu Lei, twisted his foot when he landed in the process of a snatch. He rolled on the grass in pain, and his screams could be heard by the audience through the broadcast.

The team doctor rushed into the field. After a brief examination, he immediately gestured to the technical area for a substitution. Piati was so seriously injured that he could no longer play.

Ruby’s face turned even darker. This was really a house that had been leaking and raining overnight.

He shouted a few words at the assistant manager with a livid face, and the assistant manager quickly called Wu Lei and Ferreira, who was also a new player, to the sidelines for an emergency warm – up.

Piati was carried out of the field on a stretcher, and the game resumed. At this time, the Espanyol club had one less player to play for the time being. The two substitute forwards were warming up. Ruby did not dare to rashly send them on the field before they had enough points in their warm – up. If one of them was injured, they would definitely lose.

Ruby was still hesitating about who to send.

The situation on the field was very passive, and Ruby could not hesitate for too long. He quickly made a decision to let the assistant manager go to the fourth official to request for a substitution, while he called Wu Lei and the translator over to give them face – to – Face instructions.

It was already very obvious that Wu Lei was about to go on stage!

China’s internet was abuzz. Everyone thought that even if Wu Lei had a chance to play, it would only be in the latter half of the second half. They did not expect that there were still more than ten minutes left in the first half. Because of an accidental injury, Wu Lei’s playing time was brought forward so much. This meant that he would have about an hour to play in this game.

“This works too? This operation is really a bit amazing!”

“It must be the wish of the vast number of Chinese fans that played a role!”

“Although it’s a little unkind, I couldn’t help but laugh from the bottom of my heart when I saw Piatti fall to the ground ...”
