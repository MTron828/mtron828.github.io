2885 Flying on a sword (1)

Qingfeng Luo thought to himself, it’s not as easy as you say! The spiritual energy contained in this origin crystal can’t be replenished after it’s been consumed ...”

In fact, according to what Luo Qingfeng had learned from the ancient records passed down by the sect, even in the era where the cultivation environment was better, origin crystals were not common goods. On the contrary, origin crystals had always been precious. In the past, golden core cultivators would not easily use origin crystals to absorb and recover. They would usually save origin crystals for critical moments, such as when they were about to break through or when they were saving their lives. After all, even in the era where the cultivation environment was the best on earth, origin crystals were not common. The efficiency of directly absorbing the free spiritual energy in the air was also far inferior to using Origin crystals. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, Xia ruofei had already given the order as the master. How could Luo Qingfeng dare to disobey? He could only gratefully accept the origin crystal that seemed as heavy as a thousand Jun with both hands, and said in a trembling voice,””Master, then this old servant will have to suffer! Thank you, master, for your generosity!”

“Let’s not talk about this. Just meditate here and recover!” Xia ruofei said.

He only had Luo Qingfeng as his golden core stage soul slave, and he did not wish to see Luo Qingfeng’s Foundation damaged due to over – consumption of vital Qi.

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng said.

He forced himself to calm down, and directly sat down cross – legged on the soft carpet in the living room. He held the origin crystal in his hand and began to transfer his cultivation technique to absorb it.

Luo Qingfeng did not hold back at all during the night’s sword flight. Taking into account the time difference, he had flown for more than ten hours. Halfway through, he had to adjust his breathing. At this time, his dantian was almost dry. The dense spiritual energy in the origin crystal was like sweet spring water, quickly nourishing his dantian. In a short time, his dantian had produced a lot of Yuan Qi.

Luo Qingfeng did not dare to absorb too much. He felt that his condition had stabilized a little, at least it would not affect his cultivation Foundation. He immediately stopped cultivating, stood up, and respectfully handed the origin crystal to Xia ruofei. He said,””Master, this old servant has already adjusted my breathing. Next, I only need to absorb spiritual energy normally to slowly recover. If I continue to use origin crystals, it would be a waste of a heavenly treasure. Master, please take it back.”

Xia ruofei glanced at Luo Qingfeng and said,””Absorb a little more. Although this origin crystal is precious, I won’t go bankrupt because of a piece of origin crystal!”

“There’s really no need for that!” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”master, the concentration of spirit Qi on the Paradise Island has been increasing. I only need to meditate for half a day and I should be able to fully recover!”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and took the crystals. He then nodded and said,””Alright then! Let Zheng Yongshou arrange a room for you to recuperate! When you’ve recovered to your best condition, I still have something to ask you. ”

“Yes! Master!” Luo Qingfeng quickly said,”then this old servant will take his leave!”

Ever since Xia ruofei had given him the crystals to recover his energy, he had changed his address from “subordinate” to “old servant”. This was also because he was truly convinced of Xia ruofei’s abilities from the bottom of his heart, and it was not just the soul seal that was controlling him.

After Luo Qingfeng left, Xia ruofei also left his room. He quietly went to Ling Qingxue’s room. With his current cultivation, as long as he did not want anyone to know, even Luo Qingfeng would not be able to detect his traces easily.

Ling Qingxue, who was in a daze in the room, was shocked when she saw Xia ruofei. She touched her chest and asked,””How did you get in?”

“I came in from the door!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”wife! I’m here to help you with your cultivation! You’ve been in Spain these days, and your cultivation progress has been delayed a lot. I’m free this morning, so I’ll take the time to come and practice together!”

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”Why don’t you go to Wei Wei’s place first? Aren’t you afraid that she’ll be jealous?”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”there’s always a first and a second!” If I go to Wei Wei’s place and she asks me this, what should I say? I’m willing to ...”

“You wish!” Ling Qingxue’s face was red as she lowered her eyes and said,”what are you thinking?”

Xia ruofei was stunned and said,”I mean, I’m willing to cultivate with you guys at the same time. Unfortunately, the cultivation technique doesn’t allow three people to cultivate together!” Is there a problem with my words?”

Ling Qingxue’s pretty face heated up. She glared at Xia ruofei and said,””Don’t even think about it even if you have the support of your cultivation technique!”

Xia ruofei laughed as he took out his hand from behind his back. He was holding the time array flag. As he skillfully set up the time array in Ling Qingxue’s room, he said,””Qingxue, let’s not waste any more time. I might have something to do in the afternoon and have to leave Peach Blossom Island. I’ve already broken through to the Golden core stage, so I should be of even greater help to you during our joint training. ”

Ling Qingxue asked curiously,”you’re leaving in the afternoon?” Are you going back to China?”

“No, I didn ‘t,” Xia ruofei said,”I’m going to take Luo Qingfeng to do something. At the same time, I’ll practice sword Kinesis flight. If everything goes well, I should be back in two or three days at most. ”

Flying on a sword was also a clear sign of the Golden core stage. When a cultivator reached the early stage of the Golden core stage, the yuan Qi in their dantian would be enough to support the use of sword techniques and form a protective shield while flying at high speed. This was something that no cultivator in the Qi refining stage could do. There was a clear “generation difference” between true Qi and Yuan Qi.
