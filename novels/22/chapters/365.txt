Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

At this moment, time seemed to pass very slowly, and everything seemed to be in slow motion.

No one dared to even blink their eyes as they perked up their ears to pay attention to the situation on the stage.

The teacher who was counting the votes announced the final result in a firm and clear voice.”Jade lion!”

Boom ... Boom ...

The audience was instantly filled with exclamations, cheers, and regrets ...

The voting process just now was too exciting, including the teachers and students of other universities who were just spectators. They had unknowingly entered a tense situation. When the final result was announced, everyone’s long – suppressed emotions were completely released at this moment.

There was a moment of silence on the side of the Sanshan University team, before a huge cheer suddenly broke out. The cheer was much louder than when they had won the Gold Award. Everyone was releasing their tension to their heart’s content, and everyone’s face was full of smiles.

With the previous awkwardness, Jiang Yue was more careful this time. She hugged her best friend Lu You and was so excited that her face was red. She was even happier than if she had won the bet.

Even Lu You, who had been very calm all this while, appeared very happy. A rare smile appeared on her face.

Xia Cheng and the others were also cheering happily. Only Peng Hui and you Jun had complicated expressions. They looked at Xia ruofei with jealousy and mixed feelings.

Xia ruofei was also a little nervous just now, especially at the most critical moment of the battle. He was already prepared to lose.

To be honest, it was fine to lose a bet with a student. Xia ruofei could afford to lose. As for his reputation, Xia ruofei did not care that much.

But this bet was different.

The stone in Chen song’s hand might be a little strange to others, but to Xia ruofei, it was very likely that other than Jade, it was the best item to upgrade his space.

Xia ruofei could feel that this stone might be more efficient than Jade.

Therefore, this was something that could not be lost.

At the most critical moment of the battle, Xia ruofei had even considered that if he lost the bet, he would have to use some unconventional means to get his hands on the black stone.

To Xia ruofei, who was once an elite member of the special Combat Commando, this was not difficult at all.

Moreover, Chen Song was a person who deserved a beating. Even if Xia ruofei used some means to take his things, he would not have any psychological burden.

Fortunately, the Jade lion won in the end and Xia ruofei did not have to go through any more trouble.

He heaved a sigh of relief and a smile appeared on his face.

It was dead silent at Agricultural University, which seemed out of place in the noisy environment.

Meng Zhou, Chen Song, and the others all looked dejected, as if they couldn’t accept such a result.

Chen song’s face was frighteningly gloomy. He had lost to Sanshan University in front of so many people, and the gold Prize that was originally tied was now inferior to the others. It was all because of his bet.

He would definitely be the one to take responsibility for this matter. It was fine before, but now that he had lost, Meng Zhou would definitely not take the blame.

This wasn’t a big deal, but it wasn’t a small one either. He had just guaranteed a postgraduate entrance, and the procedures hadn’t been completed yet. If this matter affected his admission to graduate school, it would be a big loss.

As he thought of this, Chen Song could not help but feel endless hatred towards Xia ruofei. Especially when he swept his gaze over and saw Xia ruofei’s victorious smile, he could not help but clench his teeth.

Agricultural University’s vice – Principal Li’s face was also very ugly. He looked at Meng Zhou and Chen Song with murderous eyes.

In front of all the teachers and students of the province’s brother high schools, this was so embarrassing. It was all because of that stupid bet. After they came down, Meng Zhou and Chen Song would definitely not have a good time.

Chen song’s heart trembled. He struggled for a while before he gritted his teeth and said loudly,”President Chen, can we take a look at the votes?”

Chen dongbai’s face flashed with displeasure as he calmly said,”Of course you can, this is your right.”

Although that was what he said, the entire voting process had been transparent. In the end, he even found a third party that had no interest in the voting process. Chen Song actually wanted to check the votes. That meant that he didn’t trust the judging panel at all. Naturally, Chen dongbai wouldn’t give Chen Song any face.

Chen Song looked at Meng Zhou. At this time, Meng Zhou wanted to stay away from Chen Song. He didn’t want to have anything to do with Chen Song. Therefore, he ignored Chen song’s gaze.

The other students of Agricultural University’s gardening club also avoided it like the plague. No one was willing to get involved in this muddy water.

Chen Song gritted his teeth. He had already said what he wanted to say. It was hard to take back spilled milk. He had already offended people whether he checked the votes or not. He might as well go up the stage and start to check the votes.

There were only 11 votes in total. Chen Song quickly divided them into two piles. One was for the Jade lion, and the other was for yang suhe.

Without a doubt, the score was 6 to 5. The Jade lion won by one vote.

Chen song’s face turned pale.

“Student, do you have any more questions about the results?” Chen dongbai asked coldly.

Chen Song shook his head with a sad expression.

Vice – Principal Li said in a cold tone,””Are you embarrassing yourself by standing there? Still not coming down?”

Chen song’s face turned pale. This time, he had really lost too thoroughly. Not only had he lost all his face, but his future might also be affected ...

Just as he was about to leave the stage, a middle – aged teacher suddenly asked,””Professor Tian, may I ask, which side did you vote for?”

There was a sudden uproar in the audience. Many familiar teachers recognized him. This middle – aged teacher was called Ren Shouyi and was from the Sanshan software college. He had nothing to do with this matter at all. No one knew why he would suddenly ask such a sensitive question.

Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows and the corners of his mouth curved up slightly. No one else noticed, but he happened to see that Ren Shouyi had made eye contact with vice – Principal li of Agricultural University before he asked the question.

A hint of joy flashed in Vice President Li’s eyes, and he immediately put on an act and said,”Teacher Ren, the results of the voting are out. Furthermore, this was originally an anonymous vote, so let’s not ask such a question ...”

Ren Shouyi said,”vice – Principal li, professor Tian, this matter actually has nothing to do with me. It’s just that everyone is curious. After all, the difference between the two sides is only one vote ... If it’s not convenient for professor Tian to answer, then forget it ...”

“Professor Tian, this ...” Vice President li deliberately showed a helpless expression.

Chen dongbai’s eyes flashed with a hint of anger. Ren Shouyi and vice – Principal li were obviously echoing each other. How could such a small trick escape his eyes?

However, before Chen dongbai could speak, professor Tian smiled and said very calmly,””I gave my vote to the Jade lion of Sanshan University ...”
