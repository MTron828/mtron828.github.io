3072 Welcoming them overnight (2)

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”brother Chen, let me make this clear!” I’m here to visit a friend, not to collect a debt!”

Chen Xuan burst into laughter upon hearing this.””I don’t care if you’re here to collect a debt or not, but I still have to pay back the spirit stones I owe you. The reason I’m a little late today is to prepare the spirit stones!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xia ruofei quickly said,”brother Chen, what are you doing?” Didn’t I tell you last time? I’m not short of spirit stones right now. You’ve spent a lot of spirit stones to bid for the five sages token, so I don’t have to be in a hurry to return it!”

“Don’t worry, brother Xia!”Chen Xuan smiled. Last time, I had underestimated the determination of the other sects to fight for the five sacred badges, so I had prepared a little less spirit stones! It’s a good thing we had brother Xia’s help, otherwise that five Saints badge would have fallen into the hands of another sect. If it’s the soaring Flower Valley or the surging waves sect, it’s still fine. After all, we’re like – minded. But if the Black Dragon cult gets this five Saints token, it’ll really be a headache ... So, after my father heard about this matter, he kept saying that he wanted to thank brother Xia properly!”

Chen Xuan paused for a moment before continuing,””Let’s get back to the main topic. Although one hundred and ten thousand spiritual stones isn’t a small amount, the first heaven society can still gather it in a short time. So, since brother Xia is here, I’ve brought it here to pay off the debt. ”

Xia ruofei forced a smile and said,”brother Chen, you guys are too serious.” It’s like I’m really here to collect a debt ...”

“Hahaha!” Chen Xuan laughed out loud and said,”that doesn’t exist! What kind of person was brother Xia? Why would he care about a mere 110000 spirit stones? But that’s a separate matter. Since it’s a debt, it’s only right and proper to pay back the money!”

With that, Chen Xuan took out 110000 spirit stones from his storage ring. It was a huge, heavy bag.

“Brother Xia, please count!” Chen Xuan said with a smile.

“Brother Chen, aren’t you slapping my face?” Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Don’t tell me that the world – famous young master Chen would shortchange me by a few spiritual stones? Wouldn’t that be a joke?”

With that, Xia ruofei kept the big bag of spiritual stones into the spirit map space.

Chen Xuan chuckled,”alright!” Then, from the debt relationship, we have cleared it! However, the first heaven society will never forget brother Xia’s help at the auction, and it won’t disappear with the disappearance of our debt. ”

“Brother Chen’s words are too serious. It was just a simple matter that day.” Xia ruofei said.

“By the way, brother Chen,” Xia ruofei continued,”your sect already has two five sacred badges. Have you guys made any progress?”

After Xia ruofei asked, he immediately explained,””Brother Chen, please don’t misunderstand! I’m not trying to pry, I’m just a little curious. Even if you guys really did come up with something, you don’t have to tell me in detail. It’s enough that I know about it. ”

A bitter smile appeared on Chen Xuan’s face as he replied,”Brother Xia, to be honest, after I took the fifth Saint token back, my father and some of the elders in the sect have been studying these two five Saint tokens for the past few days. However, they really have no clue ... It seems that this secret can only be unraveled after the last five Saint token, which is the first token, is born.”

Xia ruofei had gotten a lot of information from master Yuntai about the rising Dragon Order, which was also known as the five – Saint order by modern cultivators, so he was not surprised by this result.

He didn’t tell Chen Xuan that he had accidentally discovered token number 1 in his hands. After a short conversation, he changed the topic.

Naturally, Chen Xuan did not have the slightest doubt about this.

“Brother Xia,” he said with a smile,”other than visiting me and the first heaven society, you must have come here for something else, right?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”brother Chen should be very clear!” This time, I’m here to conveniently ...”

“Wild tea tree branch!” Chen Xuan interrupted Xia ruofei’s words and laughed.”No problem! I’ve told my father about this as soon as I returned to the sect. Putting aside the fact that brother Xia helped us obtain the five sages token, even if we didn’t have this relationship, my father wouldn’t have any reason to reject my friend’s request for a few wild tea leaves. Therefore, the old man agreed without hesitation! When we return to the sect this time, I’ll personally take brother Xia to pick one. Just tell me which one you like, as long as you don’t uproot the wild tea tree, there won’t be a problem!”

Xia ruofei was overjoyed and said,””Brother Chen, that’s interesting! This little brother will remember this favor!”

Chen Xuan laughed and said,”but it’s getting late. Brother Xia, you must be tired from the journey. So, let’s stay here for the night. I’ll bring you back to the first heaven society tomorrow morning. How about it?”

“The guest will do as the host wishes. Naturally, I will do as brother Chen arranges!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Soon, Sun Xiao brought two waiters to deliver the supper that had just been prepared to the room. They also brought a few bottles of vintage wine.

Hence, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan went to the dining room of the suite. They chatted while drinking and eating.

Chen Xuan had always been a very approachable person. Whether it was to the big shots of other sects or ordinary cultivators, he always appeared to be approachable. Moreover, he more or less had the intention of befriending Xia ruofei, so the two of them naturally had a great time chatting. To be honest, it was hard for anyone to have any ill feelings towards someone like Chen Xuan.

However, Xia ruofei was no longer a greenhorn. He would not give his heart to Chen Xuan just because he was friendly. He had always kept his mouth shut about the number one token and did not reveal anything.

He only said thirty percent to everyone, but he couldn’t completely throw away his heart.

This saying was also applicable in the world of cultivation.

If he was really a silly and sweet person who did not know how to keep his mouth shut, he would probably not live long in an environment like the cultivation world.

Naturally, Chen Xuan would not think of the five sages medallion either. He was just casually chatting with Xia ruofei about the cultivation world, including some of the things that he had gone to explore ancient ruins with his sect’s elders.

Now, although Xia ruofei had a ready – made ancient cultivator like master Yuntai by his side, this “closed – door cultivation madman” had not been able to talk to Xia ruofei about the ancient cultivation world until now. Therefore, he was naturally very curious about the ancient cultivator ruins and listened very carefully. Chen Xuan had always been a very approachable person.
