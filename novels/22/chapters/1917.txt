Chapter 1918 Going all out (3)

Liu Dong was instantly stunned. Da Liu did not know anything about Fang Chenchen, but if the other party wanted to let Da Liu know, it would be a piece of cake. There was no point in hiding it from Da Liu.

“What do you want?” Liu Dong asked, gritting his teeth.

Xu Yougang was a little excited. His fingers flew on the keyboard. After typing a sentence, he pressed the Enter key.

Up until now, everything was going according to Xia ruofei’s plan. It could be said that the situation was completely under their control.

Xia ruofei had also explained to him that the reason why he had gone through so much trouble to lure Liu Dong to Liu Da was to make him burn his bridges and leave him with no way back.

If Liu Dong was asked to seek help from Liu Da alone, Liu Dong might be afraid that the scandal would spread back to his hometown and develop a rebellious mentality. He might even come straight to Fang Chenchen and tell her everything, no longer insistent on finding the man who only showed his back in the photo.

If he had sent the photos and videos to Da Liu before Liu Dong arrived, Da Liu would have been calmer and would have investigated the matter first. Once he found out that Liu haojun was Fang Chenchen’s lover, he would not have dared to get involved in this mess.

Only when Liu Da and Liu Dong met, and Liu Dong took the initiative to tell them about it, could the show go on according to the script they designed.

Xu Yougang’s electronic synthesized voice, which was converted by the software, was emotionless.””If you take the initiative to tell Liu Da about Fang Chenchen’s affair and ask him to make the decision for you, I will naturally provide you with more detailed information. I can even tell you the location of the rendezvous of the adulterous couple.”

Liu Dong fell into silence. He was having an intense mental struggle. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

At that moment, the electronically synthesized voice sounded again.”By the way, your wife is having fun with that man! If you’re more efficient, you might be able to catch them in bed ...”

Liu Dong immediately felt blood rush to his head. He panted heavily and said without hesitation,””Good! I’ll do as you say! I hope you won’t break your promise!”

Xu Yougang didn’t say anything else and hung up the phone.

His attention was focused on the monitor. He had to make sure that Liu Dong wasn’t playing any tricks, because the show wouldn’t be able to go on without him.

Dong Liu put his phone away and turned to Da Liu.””Da, I do need your help with something, but ...”

Speaking of this, he looked at several of Da Liu’s subordinates and the drinking girls in the private room and said,””It’s not convenient to talk now!”

Da Liu got the hint and waved his hand.”You guys go outside and play for a while!”

“Yes, brother da!” Everyone replied in unison and quickly left the room.

Da Liu looked at Dong Liu with a smile and said,””Uncle Dong, there’s only the two of us left here now. If there’s anything you want to say, you can say it!”

Liu Dong knew what it meant to tell Da Liu about this, but when he thought of what the electronic voice had said, he couldn’t help but imagine his wife having sex with another man in bed. All the previous and previous thoughts disappeared.

He gritted his teeth and pulled out the photos he had received today. Then he handed the phone to Da Liu and said,””It’s embarrassing to say it out loud ... You should see for yourself!”
