2058 Not welcomed (1)

Monica also felt the subtle change in ah Yong and Ah Hua’s attitude, but she was smart enough not to say anything. When she heard that Xia ruofei was going to see Rossi, her heart skipped a beat. She smiled and nodded.”Alright, he’s staying on the first floor. I’ll Take You There!”

Xia ruofei nodded at ah Yong and Ah Hua, then followed Monica to Luo SI’s room. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

In a large bedroom on the first floor that faced South, Rousey was sitting in a wheelchair in a daze.

He was naturally the first to know that his sister had brought back a young Chinese man. He even knew that Monica had brought the man into his boudoir as soon as she came back and didn’t even come out during dinner time. What the two of them had done inside was self – evident.

There was an inexplicable irritability in Rossi’s heart, and “summer ‘s” face would always appear in front of him from time to time.

Although he had not known that mysterious Chinese young man for long and was not familiar with him, he felt that Xia Tian was the best candidate for Monica’s lover, not this Chinese kid who had appeared out of nowhere.

Even though he had heard from Rotie that the young man had come to Turin in a private jet, he was not afraid of the young man.

So what if he had some money? His sister was now the head of the Grao family. Although the Grao family was not one of the top rich families in Europe, as a family that had been operating truffles for a hundred years, their assets were quite rich.

A private jet might be a luxury in the eyes of ordinary people, but in the eyes of the truly rich, it was just a means of transportation to improve efficiency.

Furthermore, Monica was able to become the head of the Grao family all because of “Xia Tian”.

Although Xia Tian did not express his admiration for Monica, Rossi and lui hai had the same feeling. He just did not say it out loud, but his actions had made it clear.

Rousey knew his sister very well. Monica was very conservative when it came to personal relationships. As far as he knew, Monica had never had a boyfriend before. He once thought that his sister and Mr. Xia Tian were a golden couple.

He didn’t expect Monica to bring a man home directly and to be so eager.

Just as Rosey was frowning and thinking about something, there was a light knock on the door.

“Rousey, it’s me.” Monica’s voice came from outside the door.”Can I come in?”

‘She’s bringing that wild man to see me ...’ Rousey thought to herself.

He didn’t respond to Monica immediately. Instead, he waited for Monica to knock on the door again before he slowly said,””Come in! The door’s not locked ...”

The door was pushed open, and Rousey looked up. Sure enough, the Chinese young man was walking into the room with Monica with a smile.

In fact, in the eyes of many Europeans and Americans, Chinese people all looked similar.

However, Rousey immediately felt that the Chinese man in front of him looked different from Mr. Xia Tian, whom he had met a few days ago.

To be honest, although Xia ruofei was not considered handsome, he was not ugly either. In addition, after he had cultivated the “great Dao formula”, he had unconsciously emitted a refined aura, which made him very approachable.

However, perhaps it was because of his first impression, but no matter how he looked at Xia ruofei, Rossi felt that Xia ruofei was detestable. Especially when he saw Monica’s face brimming with happiness, as her younger brother, he felt inexplicably irritated.

“Rousey, let me introduce you, this is ...” Monica said with a smile.

“Hey! Monica, I’m not interested in your boyfriend!” Rousey said in a frivolous tone.

Monica’s smile froze. She turned to look at Xia ruofei awkwardly.

Xia ruofei was not angry. He walked up to her with a smile and said,””Rousey, let’s get to know each other. I’m Xia ruofei! I’m from China. ”

Xia ruofei spoke in Chinese, which surprised Luo Si. He looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””You know I can speak Chinese?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I know that not only do you know Chinese, but you also know many other languages. You’re not only a language genius, but you’re also quite talented in business. Other than the fact that you can’t move freely, you’re better than most healthy people.”

“Don’t think that I’ll accept you being with my sister just because you praise me a little. ” Monica told you all this, right?”

Xia ruofei laughed and nodded,””Of course, I’m not a prophet. If Monica doesn’t tell me, how can I know?”

In reality, Xia ruofei did not need to ask Monica about this. It was just that Xia ruofei knew Rossi quite well and expected that it would be difficult to get in touch with him. Hence, on the way back from the airport, Xia ruofei deliberately led the topic to Rossi and “asked” Monica about this.

Xia ruofei saw that Luo Si did not speak and continued with a smile,””Rousey, it doesn’t matter if you accept me or not. It’s enough as long as Monica likes me, isn’t it?”

Rousey snorted softly and said,””I don’t know what you’ve done to her. Mr. Xia is so outstanding, but she’s not moved at all. What’s so good about you? Why would she like you?”
