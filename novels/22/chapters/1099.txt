The trees on the hill were lush and there was a lot of greenery. The environment looked very peaceful but Xia ruofei could sense the tight security under the peace. He did not even need to use his spiritual power. With his professional sixth sense, he could sense that there were many hidden sentries.

The car drove straight up the mountain and drove on the smooth asphalt road for a few hundred meters. After turning a corner, they met the first sentry post, which was guarded by soldiers with loaded guns.

Chen Gang slowed down the car and rolled down the window.

Song Rui explained,”there are many retired comrades living here. So, there is a Regiment of soldiers stationed here all year round to guard the place. The entry and exit checks are very strict. If no one answers you, you will definitely not be able to enter.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded without saying a word. In fact, he could tell that although the guards were all elites of the military, with his current cultivation, it would not be difficult for him to avoid the open and hidden sentries.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not be so stupid as to expose her.

After the inspection and registration, the car continued to move forward.

There were at least five sentries along the way, and there were countless hidden sentries.

In the end, the car turned a corner, and a vast courtyard under the shade of green trees appeared in front of everyone. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

There were two armed soldiers standing at the entrance of the courtyard, vigilantly watching the front.

Chen Gang stuck his head out and waved his hand. The two soldiers immediately opened the gate, and the car drove directly into the courtyard.

“We’re here!” Song Rui said with a smile.

Xia ruofei and the other two got out of the car. Song Rui said,””Grandpa is in the backyard! I’ll bring you in!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded, then said to Chen Gang,””Staff officer Chen, thank you!”

Chen Gang was stunned for a moment. He obviously did not expect Xia ruofei to thank him. However, he immediately came back to his senses and said,””You’re welcome! This is my job!”

Xia ruofei nodded at Chen Gang and then followed song Rui inside.

This was a traditional three – Entry old house. There was a spacious parking lot in the front yard where guards, cooks, and other staff lived. The middle yard was where elder song usually worked and received guests. Some of his followers could also stay here. The backyard was where elder song rested. The environment was the quietest. Without permission, even the younger generation of the song family could not enter.

Song Rui brought Xia ruofei through the middle courtyard and stood at the door of the backyard. He said,””I can only bring you up to this point. You can go in and see the old master! We’ll be eating in the central courtyard later!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei patted song Rui’s shoulder and walked in.

As soon as they entered the backyard, Xia ruofei felt as if he had arrived at a hidden paradise. The style here was completely different from the previous one.

The yard was opened up with a long vegetable field, and there were many vegetables growing on it. On the other side, there was a grape rack full of grape vines, and under the grape rack, there was a stone table and stone bench.

Some planting tools were placed against the wall in an orderly manner, making it look like an ordinary farm.

Manager Lu had obviously received the news from the front yard and was already waiting there.

As soon as he saw Xia ruofei, he greeted him with a smile and said,””Xiao Xia, the chief has been waiting for you for a long time!”

Xia ruofei quickly said,”yo!” Then I’m really guilty, how can I let the old birthday girl wait for me!”

Manager Lu laughed and said,”you little Xia!” The Bureau chief has been talking about you a lot recently! The chief has been back in the capital for so long and you don’t want to come and see him ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”I’ve been busy with worldly affairs. Besides, elder song’s status is special. It’s inconvenient for me to come here often.”

“That’s only for others!” Manager Lu smiled and said,”the chief treats you like his own descendant. You can come and see him anytime you want.”

“I got it, manager Lu!” Xia ruofei said, feeling warm inside.

The courtyard behind them wasn’t big. As the two of them spoke, they had already passed through the courtyard and arrived at the central room.

“Chief, Xiao Xia is here!” Manager Lu said at the door.

Elder song was sitting in the middle of the central room, and there were many people sitting on both sides. They all looked in the direction of the voice.

Xia ruofei quickly stepped forward and entered the central room. He said respectfully to elder song,””Chief, today is your birthday. I wish you good fortune like the flowing water of the East Sea and a long life like the everlasting pine on the southern mountain!”

Elder song’s hair and beard were all white, but he was in good spirits. He looked at Xia ruofei with a kind gaze and laughed.”Thank you for your blessing! Little Xia, come over and sit!”

Xia ruofei walked forward and took a good look at the people in the room. Other than elder song’s children, there were also a few leaders who were close to elder song. Among them were Tian Huilan, who had been transferred to the capital, and Lieutenant General Zhao, who Xia ruofei had helped treat diabetes.

It seemed that even though elder song’s birthday was supposed to be a family dinner, the higher – ups who were closer to him were still invited.

Of course, elder song still remembered Xia ruofei and asked song Rui to invite him personally. He was very touched.

Tian Huilan, Zhao Cheng, song Rui’s father, song Zhengping, as well as elder song’s other children, whom he had interacted with a few times during his treatment, all smiled and nodded at Xia ruofei. The others looked at Xia ruofei curiously.
