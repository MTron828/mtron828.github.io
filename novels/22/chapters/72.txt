73  Chapter 71 - crazy purchase_1

    Xia ruofei did not leave the villa for the next few days.

  He wasn't in a hurry to rent the land. He planned to wait for the cabbages in the backyard to ripen and confirm that soaking the cabbages in the petal solution could greatly improve the quality of the vegetables.

  Of course, at the same time, it was also because he had to be busy with the sale of the succulents for the next few days. Now that he was alone, there were too many things to take care of.

  However, Xia ruofei had been rather carefree these few days. After "forcing a kiss" on Xia ruofei that day, Ling Qingxue seemed to be a little embarrassed. She did not even call him these few days. The person who came to pick up the food every morning had been replaced by a purchaser from Ling Ji's food and beverage department.

  Other than preparing the Taoyuan vegetables for Xi Jiang Moon Club and Ling Ji restaurant every day, Xia ruofei would tend to the cabbage in the backyard, enter the spirit map space to harvest the vegetables at a fixed time, take care of the young fish in the fish pond, and the precious Red Arowana.

  On the second day after Ling Qingxue left, the cabbage seedlings had already reached the planting conditions. Xia ruofei had already opened up two vegetable fields in the backyard. He planted the seedlings carefully in the vegetable field and watered them with normal tap water mixed with a small amount of petal solution every day. This was also to simulate the situation of large - scale planting in the future. Although there was a spring at the bottom of the spirit pond, the water in the spirit pond could not be used up endlessly.

  The space was already showing a thriving scene, and the peach Garden vegetables could be harvested every day.

  In addition to the first six kinds of vegetables, the pumpkins, carrots, cabbages, and Chinese yam that were purchased later had also entered the harvest period. After expanding the planting, it was more than enough to supply Xi jiangyue and Ling Ji restaurant.

  However, as the planting area expanded, Xia ruofei felt a little strained.

  After all, the vegetables here grew very fast, and he was only one person. He was reaching his limit. If he expanded the scale, he would not be able to do it.

  Hence, Xia ruofei decided to plant his vegetables, fruits, and fruits in the outside world as much as possible. The spirit map space would be used to grow valuable crops with high economic value, such as precious Chinese medicinal herbs and wood.

  Xia ruofei had no intention of expanding the space fish pond.

  The fish inside were mainly for him and his friends to eat. At most, he would take out a small amount to sell as a premium product.

  If you want to make a lot of money, you still have to raise precious species, whether it's ornamental fish or edible fish. The high - end path is the king.

  The ecosystem in the fish pond had started to function normally. The small fish, shrimp, and plankton were growing very quickly in the spirit pool. The fish pond was now self - sufficient and did not need Xia ruofei to feed it.

  In the past few days, the fry had obviously grown bigger.

  Grass carp grew quite fast. Usually, a 2 - year - old fish could reach a weight of one or two catties, and a 3 - year - old fish was already very big. The time flow in the space was 20 times faster than the outside world. Two or three months in the space was equivalent to three or four years in the outside world.

  The red Arowana was enjoying itself in the pond. Every day, Xia ruofei would drip a few drops of the petal solution into the fish. It looked even more radiant. The red color on its gills was getting thicker. Its scales were tight and dense. Each piece was huge and there were signs of a second color.

  Four days had passed in the outside world. Xia ruofei realized that all the succulents had survived and had grown a lot. These seedlings were all qualified for long - distance transportation.

  Hence, Xia ruofei decided to put them on sale.

  This time, Xia ruofei was familiar with the process and took a photo of the new succulent sapling.

  After taking the photos, Xia ruofei carefully selected 20 pots of succulent seedlings to be used as mother plants to continue strengthening his "succulent Army".

  He arranged the remaining one hundred and sixty pots of succulent seedlings in different categories, counted the number of each kind of succulent seedling, and recorded it. Then, he left the spirit map space with a thought.

  The next step was a series of tedious work, such as selecting the photos, uploading them, pricing, setting the inventory, and so on.

  It was already late at night when he was done. As they had already announced that the succulents would be put on the shelves at 8 am the next day, Xia ruofei did not rush to announce it. Instead, he washed up and went to bed.

  The next morning, Xia ruofei first prepared the vegetables for both stores. After they had picked up the vegetables, he went to the computer in the bedroom upstairs and prepared to put the new batch of succulent seedlings on the shelf.

  Xia ruofei didn't know that at the same time, many people in the country were staring at their computers, waiting for the three - Star "Taoyuan roaty" to release a new product.

  ……

  In Chuncheng city, southern Yunnan Province, a fat middle - aged man was staring at the computer screen. At this time, his phone on the table rang. Fatty's eyes didn't leave the screen. He picked up the phone and pressed the answer button.

  "Hello ... Old Huang ... I'm not going today. I can't leave now ..."

  At this time, fatty, who was habitually refreshing the web page, suddenly saw that the page had changed. He quickly said,"

  "Let's not talk about it. I have important things to do! I'll contact you later!"

  After saying that, he didn't even have time to press the hang up button. He directly threw the phone to the side, and then nimbly moved the mouse to start choosing.

  Adding the shopping cart, the combined payment, and the settlement all took less than two minutes.

  Seeing that his order had appeared in the back - end and was waiting to be sent out, the fat man heaved a long sigh of relief. He picked up the cup and took a big gulp of water.

  ……

  In Fengtian city of Liaodong Province, everyone had just started work. Some were leisurely reading a newspaper while sipping tea, while others quickly opened a novel website and began reading.

  A young man in his 20s did not even take off his bag. He sat in front of his computer and stared nervously at the Taoyuan butcher shop's page, constantly refreshing it.

  When the new goods were displayed, the young man quickly looked through them, and then without hesitation, he chose a few of them and paid for them.

  ……

  Similar scenes were happening in many places across the country.

  Three minutes later, a post appeared on Baidu meat Tieba. The title was "Taoyuan meat stall's new goods are on the shelves. Did you manage to grab them today?"

  In the post, the original poster wrote:

  Recently, the mysterious "Taoyuan roaty stall" had been spamming the bar. The succulent seedlings sold in this new online store were all one - in - a - million high - Quality products, and everyone expressed their envy, jealousy, and hatred for the first batch of customers who bought the succulent seedlings.

  Five days ago, Taoyuan roaty had announced that they would be releasing new goods at 8 am today. Many of the forum members had sent out information posts, and the OP, who still had some spare money on hand, wanted to pick a pot of succulent seedlings to improve his image.

  The OP entered the online shop on time, but ... He hesitated for a moment whether to buy a tortoise - Shell peony or a white - skinned lunar boundary. After comparing it repeatedly for a while, it was sold out!

  This was a top - grade succulent seedling that was worth hundreds or even thousands of Yuan, not some cabbage! There were clearly 20 to 30 pots in stock a minute ago, but they were all sold out in an instant! Can We Still Be Friends happily?

  At the end of the post, the OP used a big crying emoji to express his feelings at the moment. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

  Not long after this post was posted, the number of replies shot up.

  "I didn't get it either! I was delayed by three minutes in parking the car downstairs ... I'm crying!"

  "Lalalalala! A basin of top - grade Wanxiang brocade is already in my hands. I look forward to the day I receive it ..."

  "Previous poster, you're pulling aggro! Those who also slipped and didn't get it express strong indignation!"

  "There are so many rich people in China! It's like it's free ..."

  "This shop is on fire!"

  "I didn't buy it, I didn't buy it, I didn't buy it ... I'll say the sad thing three times!"

  "The shop owner is too despicable! Why did he have to do hunger marketing?"

  "Shopkeeper, come out now. I promise I won't beat you to death ..."

  ……

  There were too many monks and too few gruel. In the end, the majority of people didn't buy it. These people naturally left messages one after another, and those who bought it also began to share screenshots of their orders. They were having fun, and this post quickly became a hot post in the bar.

  Usually, when some businesses came to the meat bar to advertise, their posts would be locked by the owner. Only the post of "Taoyuan meat shop" was not locked. Instead, it was pinned to the top.

  Xia ruofei naturally didn't know that his Taoyuan butcher shop had already caused so much discussion in the Tenshou Tieba, a place where players gathered. He only saw that the number of orders in the back end of Taobao was rapidly increasing.

  This time, there were more than 160 pots of succulents of various species on sale, but they were all sold out in just two minutes. It was obvious that the buyers were waiting in front of the computer in advance and would start fighting when the time came.

  He earned 150000 in two minutes? Xia ruofei was dumbfounded ...
