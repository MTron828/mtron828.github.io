Chapter 1563: Do your best (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Please come in, Mr. Xia!” Shi Lei said respectfully.

Xia ruofei walked into the room, and Yu mingdong sat up from the bed, rubbing his sleepy eyes.

He had just slept for an hour or two, and it was the time when he was in the deepest sleep, so he was still in a daze when he was woken up by Shi Lei.

When Yu mingdong saw Xia ruofei, he rubbed his eyes and said,””Mr. Xia, you’re up so early ...”

Shi Lei could not help but smile bitterly. Xia ruofei also pointed at the clock on the wall awkwardly and said,””President Yu, I’m really sorry to disturb your rest so late at night ...”

Only then did Yu mingdong notice that it was only two in the morning.

He suddenly sobered up. Xia ruofei had come to look for him in the middle of the night. Did something happen?

Yu mingdong quickly asked,”Mr. Xia, what happened?” Lei Zi, take a look at our Jade!”

Shi Lei did not sleep much the entire night. He was always alert. After all, there were jades worth tens of millions in the house. If they were lost, it would be his responsibility.

“Boss, all the Jade is here, no problem ...” Shi Lei answered immediately.

“President Yu, I’m looking for you at this hour because I need your help with something ...” Xia ruofei said quickly.

“What’s the matter, Mr. Xia?”Yu mingdong asked, puzzled.

“It’s like this, I’m in a hurry to use Jade, right?” Xia ruofei said,”I wanted to buy it tomorrow morning, but it seems a little too late now ... Didn’t President Yu cut out a lot of Jade today? So ...”

Yu mingdong immediately understood. Although he didn’t know why Xia ruofei wanted the jadeite overnight, he still said readily,””No problem! Mr. Xia, which one do you want?”

“It’s best if it’s above the ice grade. ” Xia ruofei said,”it doesn’t matter if it’s small.”

Since he was going to use Jade to inscribe the array patterns, Xia ruofei naturally hoped that the Jade’s quality was better. That way, it would have a better carrying capacity and the effect would not be reduced in the long run.

Yu mingdong immediately went over to open the box and said,””Mr. Xia, you can choose whatever you want!”

Xia ruofei walked over and picked up a fist – sized ice – Type jade.””This one ... President Yu, how much is this? I’ll transfer it to you tomorrow!”

“No need, no need. This piece of material isn’t big. Just take it as a gift from me!” Yu mingdong said readily.

“That won’t do, that’s a separate matter!” Xia ruofei said,”why don’t we do it this way? I’ll take it as if you’re accompanying me to buy the Jade. We don’t have to buy it tomorrow.”

“How can that be?” Yu mingdong quickly said. This piece of material was not worth five million! Besides, Mr. Xia, you’ve already deducted three million from the five million Yuan of Jade. How can I take advantage of you? No, no, no!”

Xia ruofei was in a hurry to go back and carve the array runes. He didn’t want to reject Yu mingdong anymore, so he said,””I’ll take the stuff first. Mr. Yu, if you think it’s not enough, just prepare some ordinary Jade for me next time. I won’t buy it tomorrow!”

“Good, good, good!” Yu mingdong said.

Of course, he hoped that Xia ruofei would want ordinary Jade. He did not have many channels for high – end Jade such as ice – Type and glass – Type jade. Otherwise, he would not have participated in the public Jade bid. It was not easy to get them, so he naturally wanted to keep them for his own factory.

Xia ruofei took the Jade, bid Yu mingdong and Shi Lei goodbye, and left the room.

Yu mingdong looked at the time on the wall clock and looked at Shi Lei.””Didn’t he say that he was extremely tired and wanted to go back to his room to sleep? This ...”

Shi Lei couldn’t help but laugh.”Boss, you should sleep a little longer! There’s still a long way to go before dawn!”

“Yes, yes, yes, I’ll go back to sleep!” Yu Ming Dong said,”Lei Zi, you should be more alert when you sleep. This is a large part of our assets!”

“Don’t worry, boss!” Shi Lei said,”nothing can escape my ears!”

When Shi Lei said this, he was also a little suspicious. He was only in a light sleep earlier and did not notice Xia ruofei approaching their room. He only woke up when Xia ruofei knocked on the door.

Could it be that after leaving the Army for a long time, his vigilance had also lowered? Shi Lei shook his head.

......

Xia ruofei returned to his room and checked on Song Wei.

Due to the time – slowing formation, Song Wei only experienced a few seconds in the formation. Naturally, there were no changes.

Without further ado, Xia ruofei immediately summoned the spirit map. He had already given Song Wei the array flags of the Archean realm that had entered the spirit map space. In the Archean realm, time would flow 30 times faster, which would increase the efficiency by a lot.

Xia ruofei took out a carving knife. After pouring his genuine Qi into it, he cut the ice – Type jade as if it was tofu.

Since he wanted Song Wei to wear it, it had to be carved into a jade pendant.

Xia ruofei hesitated for a moment. He did not know what style he should use. In theory, the style would not affect the carving of the array pattern. However, girls loved to look pretty. Xia ruofei could not just carve a pendant for Song Wei to wear.

At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly had an idea. He remembered that Song Wei’s phone case was from Doraemon and the desktop of her phone was also Doraemon’s picture. She must have liked this cartoon character.
