Chapter 405: Instigation_2

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”don’t even think about it!” Do you think the bosses of the song family are all useless? I still want to live a little longer!”

Song Rui’s idea just now was indeed a spur – of – the – moment idea. He thought about it carefully and felt that it was impossible. With the power of the song family, even if song Rui went abroad, it would be easy for them to find out his financial transactions. By then, he would be able to survive overseas for a while, but that would be a huge blow to Xia ruofei.

Thinking of this, song Rui also felt a little guilty and said,””Ruofei, it’s my fault for not considering this ...”

Then, he sighed and said,””It seems like I really have no other way out ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and saw his pitiful look. He couldn’t help but say,””Things shouldn’t be that bad, right? Do you think the song family wants you to get married immediately?”

“No...” Song Rui said,”the girl hasn’t even graduated from college yet! But even if they weren’t getting married for the time being, they still couldn’t stand it! My mom is almost forcing me to go on a date with a gun ... And I’m being watched so closely that it’s impossible for me to go out and play. Isn’t it depressing for me every day?”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””I think this is the main point, right? With the marriage agreement, you can’t play around anymore ...”

Song Rui laughed dryly and said,”that’s part of the reason ... But my main goal is freedom!” What era was this? I’m strongly against those feudalistic arranged marriages!”

Xia ruofei pouted, obviously not believing song Rui’s nonsense.

However, song Rui treated him like a brother. He did not want to hurt song Rui at this time.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”I think the key to this matter is the woman.”

“What do you mean?” Song Rui immediately perked up.

“If the other party agrees to the marriage from the bottom of his heart, or if he is deeply attracted to you after seeing you and can’t extricate himself ...” Xia ruofei said and looked at song Rui.”However, the possibility of this is infinitely close to zero. We can not consider such a situation.”

“Hey, what do you mean?” song Rui immediately shouted. I’m as handsome as those celebrities! Every time we go out to play, we’re always in a daze. ”

Xia ruofei looked at song Rui with a faint smile and asked,””You think those girls are attracted to your looks?”

Song Rui’s eyes widened. He opened his mouth and then said dejectedly,””Fine ... They’re more interested in my identity as the song family’s young master ...”

What a painful realization!

Xia ruofei shrugged and asked,”what’s your “fiancée”‘s attitude this time?”

Song Rui thought for a while and said,”I don’t think she’s willing to do it either.” Anyway, that woman was quite cold, and the way she looked at me ... Seemed to have some disgust ...”

The more song Rui spoke, the more he felt a deep sense of defeat. Although he had no feelings for the “fiancée” that the family had forced on him, it did not mean that he did not have any vanity. He carefully thought back and realized that the girl was really cold to him, and the disgust in her eyes was almost undisguised.

“That means the situation is not the worst,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“What do you mean?” Song Rui asked expectantly.

“It’s a very simple logic! Since both of you are unwilling, then the probability of this marriage is even lower! It’s much better than you struggling alone!” Xia ruofei said.

“But I think the other party will most likely surrender.” Song Rui said helplessly.

Many times, the children of these big families were actually not happy, especially when it came to personal feelings. It was almost impossible for them to make their own decisions, and in the end, it was almost always a political marriage.

“There can’t be someone at home watching you guys when you’re on a date, right?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I don’t think so.” Song Rui said.

“Then the next time you meet, I suggest you make it clear to the other party.” Xia ruofei said,”make it clear. Then, both sides can go back and fight!”

“That’s the only way ... But I don’t think it’ll work ...”Song Rui nodded.

“Song Rui, do you know how to act?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“What do you mean?” song Rui asked, puzzled.

“I’m just pretending to be an obedient baby!” Xia ruofei said unhappily,”you need to show your obedience, assertiveness, and positive side. In short, you have to be the kind of person that master Jia wants you to be.”

“Then what’s the point of me living?” Song Rui said dejectedly.

“Short – sighted!” Xia ruofei said mercilessly,”the reason I asked you to do this is to make your family lower their guard against you!”

“And then I’ll take the opportunity to escape?” Song Rui’s eyes lit up.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but roll his eyes.”Why is your mind filled with running away? Didn’t I just say it? You won’t be able to escape from the palm of the Buddha. ”

“Then what’s the use of me acting like an obedient baby?”

“Nonsense! After your family let down their guard against you, they won’t send people to monitor you every day, right? At that time, you won’t be restricted in every way like you are now, right? If you occasionally go out to fool around, there shouldn’t be anyone to care about you, right?” Xia ruofei said,”you’ve said it yourself. She hasn’t even graduated from college. Even if she wants to get married, it’ll be a few years later. Don’t you want to live a more comfortable life for the next few years?”

“That’s true ...” Song Rui’s mind finally turned.

Xia ruofei continued,”let’s think deeper. Let’s say that you’re very active in your family’s company. Then, you’ll mention that you want to study abroad for an MBA or something at the appropriate time. Is that possible? Maybe your father will be so happy that he’ll cry!”

Song Rui’s eyes lit up and his mind became more active. He continued Xia ruofei’s words,””Yeah! If I really study abroad for two years and get an MBA, I might be able to support myself by then. I can totally stay abroad and not come back!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat. This guy still hadn’t given up on the idea of escaping. He was really persistent!

Xia ruofei said,”I’m just giving you an example. I’m just providing you with an idea. Actually, there are many benefits to being a good boy. You can slowly experience it in the future.”

“Good, good, good. Ruofei, this is a good idea! Thanks!” Song Rui said happily.

“Well said, well said.” Xia ruofei patted song Rui’s shoulder and said,”we are Good Brothers! Let’s go, dinner should be ready. Let’s go down and eat!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he said in his heart,”Elder song, Governor song, Madam song, don’t blame me for teaching your young master the wrong way! My original intention was to persuade him to do good, but he misunderstood it ... I hope that if this guy is exposed, he won’t say that I instigated him!

The two of them went down the mountain and returned to the villa. Ye Lingyun and pang Hao had already prepared dinner, and everyone sat around the dining table to eat.

Xia ruofei even took out a bottle of Drunken Eight Immortals, the kind that had flower petal solution added to it. The wine was so strong that even Madam song couldn’t help but take a small sip. Song Rui was full of praise for the wine. He had never drunk such a strong and fragrant wine in his life.

In contrast, Madam song repeatedly gave a thumbs up to the taste of the peach Garden vegetables and space grass carp, repeatedly saying that they were delicious. What had this pampered official’s wife not eaten before? However, he was still conquered by the delicious taste of the Paradise vegetables without any suspense and ate an extra bowl of rice than usual.

After the meal, Mrs. Song took song Rui and left. Before leaving, Xia ruofei did not forget to go upstairs to get five portions of Jade skin cream for Mrs. Song.

When Madam song saw the jaded skin cream, she treated Xia ruofei even more kindly. She invited Xia ruofei to xiangnan province as a guest with great enthusiasm. Xia ruofei smiled and said that he would definitely go if he had the chance. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After sending off Mrs. Song and song Rui, Xia ruofei was ready to go upstairs to his room.

At this moment, li Zhifu stopped him and said,””Xia, wait a minute. I have something to tell you.”
