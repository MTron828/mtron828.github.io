Storing and retrieving items in the storage ring was very simple. A Qi refining stage cultivator’s mental power was already enough to use. Basically, as long as they thought about it, they could conveniently store and retrieve items.

Xia ruofei had only taught them once, and they had mastered it easily.

Thus, the two of them were like children who had just gotten their favorite toy. They kept trying to store their personal items in and out.

Even song Wei, who had always been calm and steady, revealed a rare child – like smile.

Obviously, this gift made both of them very satisfied and surprised.

In fact, they didn’t have many things with them. It was just a girl’s small bag, which contained a mobile phone, a small mirror, some simple cosmetics, sunblock, and so on. It didn’t take up much storage space at all, but they still had a lot of fun.

Xia ruofei stood at the side and looked at the two of them with a smile. He had a gift for them, but seeing that they were having so much fun, he was not in a hurry.

Anyway, it was still a long flight from Australia to China!

After the two of them had their fun and put all their belongings into their storage rings, Xia ruofei smiled and asked,””Little Sisters, are you satisfied with this gift?”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue both nodded.

If Xia ruofei had not told them that their phones could not receive signal in the storage ring, they would not have kept their phones with them. They would have stored everything in the storage ring.

What was there to be dissatisfied about?

“There’s another present. I hope you’ll like it!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“There’s a gift?” Ling Qingxue’s interest was immediately piqued.”Then hurry up and take it out.” Don’t keep me in suspense!”

This time, Xia ruofei had really given them a big surprise. A cup of wild tea had directly increased their cultivation by more than one level. They also liked the storage ring very much. So when they heard that Xia ruofei had a gift, they were naturally even more excited.

Xia ruofei laughed as he took out the two flying swords that he had picked out earlier from the spirit map space.

Scholar Yuntai had left a total of five flying swords in the nested space, all of which he was quite satisfied with, and could be said to be his proud works.

Xia ruofei had already picked out two swords that were suitable for girls and was prepared to give them to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

Although the two of them probably wouldn’t use flying swords and wouldn’t fight with cultivators, it was good to have two high – Quality flying swords for self – defense. After all, they both had their own things to do and Xia ruofei couldn’t be by their side to protect them all the time.

Very coincidentally, these two flying swords were also a set. The swords were thin and soft, and at a glance, it was obvious that they were meant for female Xiu.

Moreover, the names of the two flying swords were engraved on them. One was called “autumn water” and the other was called “Yiren.” The names were also very pleasing.

Hence, when Xia ruofei was counting his gains, he decided to give the two flying swords to Ling Qingxue and Song Wei as soon as he saw them.

After Xia ruofei took out the two flying swords, they hovered quietly. The slender swords exuded a sharp aura, as if they could cut one’s soul apart. It was a daunting sight.

When Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at the flying sword, they couldn’t help but be a little dazed.

“This ... This is a flying sword?” Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened as she asked,”are these for us?”

They had seen Xia ruofei’s Blue immortal sword before, so they were not too unfamiliar with flying swords.

However, from what they knew, only cultivators at the Golden core stage were qualified to use flying swords. They were still very far from the Golden core stage.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile.”That’s right. Each of you will have a flying sword. I’ll give it to you for self – defense. How about it?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“We can also use flying swords?” Ling Qingxue asked with some uncertainty.

“Why can’t I? A Qi condensation cultivator’s psyche is enough to control a flying sword, but the range isn’t as wide as a golden core cultivator ‘s. In addition, Qi condensation cultivators can’t ride a flying sword!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”and your spiritual power is much stronger than cultivators of the same level. You’re only at refined Qi Level 5, which is enough to use the flying sword!”

Then, Xia ruofei said,”these two flying swords, one is called autumn water and the other is called Yiren. The same old rules. You guys can discuss among yourselves. Each of you can choose one!”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue nodded in unison, then carefully approached the flying sword.

These two flying swords were very suitable for girls to use. Because they were a set, their appearance was similar. They were both light green in color, and he didn’t know what material they were made of.

Xia ruofei estimated that many of the materials used to make flying swords could not be found in the current cultivation world.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue discussed in low voices for a while. In the end, Ling Qingxue chose the autumn water sword, while Song Wei chose the sword of her lover.

“RUO Fei, this flying sword ... How are we going to use it?” Ling Qingxue asked, a little scared.

The flying sword was extremely sharp, and because it was controlled by spiritual power, there was no hilt at all. The whole body was a sword edge, and it also emitted a trace of cold aura, which was indeed a bit daunting.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s actually very simple. It’s similar to a storage ring. First, you have to imprint your own spiritual imprint on the flying sword. Then, you can store the flying sword in your dantian. When you need to use it, it can appear with a thought and you can control it with your spiritual power!”
