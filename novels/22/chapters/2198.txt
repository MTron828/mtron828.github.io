2199 An easy breakthrough_Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment before she said!”Why don’t we cultivate at night?! I still want to sunbathe in the afternoon!”

This was the first time that Ling Qingxue had taken the initiative to ask to postpone the time of cultivation. Usually, if she heard that Xia ruofei wanted to cultivate together, she would definitely be very happy and agree.

Of course, this was mainly because of the picturesque view of the sea. Moreover, the weather was so good today. The sun was shining brightly, and it was rare for her to come out, so she wanted to enjoy it.

As for the night, the sea was dark and nothing could be seen, so cultivating in the cabin was the most suitable.

“I have more important things to do tonight ...” Xia ruofei chuckled.

From the day he bought the yacht, Xia ruofei had been looking forward to a “boat shake”. It was not easy for him to go out to sea with Ling Qingxue. How could he bear to give up such a rare opportunity?

Ling Qingxue was no longer a Virgin and understood Xia ruofei’s words in seconds. Her face heated up and she glared at Xia ruofei.”You ... Your mind is filled with all sorts of weird things ...”

Xia ruofei chuckled and didn’t say anything.

Ling Qingxue muttered to herself for a moment, then asked shyly,””Then ... Where shall we train in the afternoon?”

Her words indirectly agreed to Xia ruofei’s suggestion to train in the afternoon and do that at night ...

Xia ruofei was overjoyed and said,”anywhere is fine!” There’s no one to disturb us on the sea anyway! Since you want to enjoy the sun, let’s just cultivate on the deck of the flying bridge! How is it?”

“Yes, yes!” Ling Qingxue said as she nodded her head.

“I’ll go get the formation flags!” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he went into the cabin. After a while, he took out the time array flag from the space and came to the deck of the flying bridge. Ling Qingxue was already waiting there.

Xia ruofei skillfully set up the array, then took Ling Qingxue’s hand and walked into the array.

This time formation was very wondrous. Although the flow of time had changed, the sunlight from the outside world could shine in without any obstruction. It was equivalent to the time that the two of them could enjoy the sunlight being increased by dozens of times.

Under the warm sunlight, Xia ruofei took out a piece of crystal and sat down cross – legged with Ling Qingxue.

Their palms touched. Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Qingxue, focus on your cultivation. Don’t have any other thoughts. Just let nature take its course when you break through.”

Ling Qingxue had been a little nervous at first, but after hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she immediately calmed down.

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head.

The two of them didn’t say anything else. They looked at each other and started to operate the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra”.

Boundless energy gushed out from the origin crystals and circulated in their meridians and dantians.

The amount of true Qi in Ling Qingxue’s dantian was also increasing rapidly.

To begin with, the efficiency of two people training together was already much higher than her training alone. Adding on the fact that origin crystals were one level higher than spirit crystals, for Ling Qingxue, who was at the second Qi layer, this kind of training speed was simply like riding a rocket.

The true Qi in Ling Qingxue’s dantian quickly became saturated.

The two of them were completely unaware and were still circulating the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” at a steady pace.

His dantian couldn’t contain the newly added true Qi, so it naturally began to compress it.

As her cultivation progressed, the true Qi in Ling Qingxue’s dantian also became more solid.

Only when there was enough quantitative change would there be a qualitative change.

This cultivation continued for a full five hours, and the true Qi in Ling Qingxue’s dantian was finally compressed to its limit.

Ling Qingxue seemed to have heard a loud bang in her body. The true Qi that had been compressed to the extreme suddenly collapsed a little more. Then, it seemed that all the true Qi circulation became much smoother.

At that moment, Ling Qingxue’s dantian seemed to have become much emptier. In fact, the size of the dantian was constant. The amount of true Qi seemed to have decreased, but in reality, the degree of condensation of each wisp of true Qi was several times higher than before.

After five hours of non – stop cultivation, Ling Qingxue’s cultivation finally broke through to refined Qi Level 3!

Xia ruofei had trained together with Ling Qingxue. Naturally, he had sensed that Ling Qingxue had broken through.

Ling Qingxue seemed to be a little excited that she had successfully broken through to refined Qi Level 3. Even her breathing had become a little chaotic.

Xia ruofei said in a deep voice,”Qingxue!” Don’t let your thoughts run wild! Calm down! I’ll continue to consolidate my cultivation!”

Ling Qingxue nodded and quickly calmed down. She continued to work with Xia ruofei to practice the “absolute beginning Scripture”.

Because the cultivation of the “absolute beginning Heart Sutra” required both of their souls to be highly synchronized, so during the cultivation process, it would also greatly promote the spiritual power. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course, Ling Qingxue had just broken through to the early stage of the spiritual palpitations stage, so even though her spiritual power had also improved, she could not break through to the next level.

The two of them practiced together for more than two hours before Ling Qingxue’s cultivation was completely consolidated at refined Qi Level 3.

This breakthrough not only made Ling Qingxue’s true Qi more condensed, but it also widened her meridians.

With the cultivation of refined Qi Level 3 and the cultivation of spiritual power at the early stage of spirit palpitate, Xia ruofei’s cultivation was no longer the same as before. His spiritual power had even broken through a large realm and reached the spirit gathering realm. Xia ruofei knew that he should be able to try the wonderful combination of spirit and body.

However, he did not do so immediately.

After all, Ling Qingxue had just consolidated her cultivation, and the two of them had already been cultivating for seven to eight hours. They were not in their best condition in all aspects.
