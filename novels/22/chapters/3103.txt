3104 Imparting a new cultivation technique (2) ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I’m just asking,”Ling Qingxue pursed her lips into a smile and said,” how could you possibly give us a very bad technique to practice?”

“That’s good ...” Xia ruofei laughed drily and said,”sit down and have some tea. I’ll explain the ‘nichang Heart Sutra’ to you.”

“Yes, yes!” Ling Qingxue and Song Wei nodded in unison.

The three of them sat around the coffee table. Xia ruofei made tea while explaining the situation of the “nichang Heart Sutra” to the two of them.

After hearing this, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but smile and say,””That sounds pretty good! Isn’t it equivalent to having two more specialties after mastering this technique?”

“What do you mean?” Xia ruofei was confused.

“A dance and a zither!” Ling Qingxue said,”didn’t you say that when the moves of the ‘nichang Heart Sutra’ were used together with the heart technique, it could perfectly display the graceful figure of a female cultivator, just like dancing? In addition, this cultivation technique also included the secret technique of using the zither to launch sound wave attacks. Wasn’t this equivalent to having two more specialties? In the future, if Weiwei’s school had a party or something, she could go up and dance ... No! Forget about dancing, how could he show such a good figure in public? Let’s go and perform the zither ...”

Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue was digressing further and couldn’t help but say,””Qingxue ... The main point is the cultivation technique, okay? Why do you have such a strange point of focus?”

Although Song Wei did not say anything, she could not help but laugh.

Ling Qingxue then stuck out her tongue and said,””Aren’t we just trying to liven up the atmosphere? RUO Fei, please continue, please continue ... I promise I won’t interrupt you anymore ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and shook his head. Then, he continued to explain the “nichang Heart Sutra” to the two of them.

He also took out two copies of the cultivation technique he had prepared in advance from the spirit map space and handed them to the two.

Then, Xia ruofei said,”this is the Qi refining stage part of the” nichang Heart Sutra “. You must first memorize it. This is the most basic requirement. Then, you must understand the content of the cultivation method. After you’ve understood the content, you can try to cultivate it. Of course, I’ll continue to explain it to you. In addition ... You’re all at the fifth Qi layer and will soon break through to the sixth Qi layer, so the first part won’t be too difficult for you. You should be able to get started very quickly. ”

“I’m good at memorizing!” Song Wei smiled and said,”I’m still a student!”

“My memory isn’t bad either!” Ling Qingxue grinned and said,”Weiwei, why don’t we have a competition? Let’s see who can remember faster and more firmly. RUO Fei will be the judge!”

“Alright!” “That’s a good suggestion!” Song Wei said.

“What’s the point of just competing?” Xia ruofei ridiculed,”of course, we have to increase the bet to make it more exciting!”

“Move aside! The judge has no right to speak!” Ling Qingxue said with a straight face on purpose. Then, she couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

In fact, the two of them had long since broken away from the category of ordinary people. At the fifth Qi layer, during the process of cultivation, their entire person had unknowingly evolved a lot, and the degree of development of their brain region had far exceeded that of ordinary people.

Therefore, they were able to quickly memorize the contents of the cultivation method, which were extremely obscure to ordinary people.

The time taken was about half an hour.

Then, the two of them supervised each other’s recitation, and even took out a paragraph from a certain page to ask each other questions.

The atmosphere of the competition was quite intense.

Of course, Xia ruofei was happy to see that happen, because that way, the two would remember him better.

Xia ruofei only started explaining the technique after the two of them had memorized the contents.

This time, it wasn’t explaining from a macro perspective, but breaking down every sentence of the cultivation method and explaining it in great detail from the beginning.

The cultivation technique he had obtained from the Jade talisman of inheritance contained the cultivation experience of many predecessors. All of this was injected into Xia ruofei’s mind.

Hence, even if Xia ruofei had never cultivated the “nichang Heart Sutra”, he had a deep understanding of martial arts. At least, he had no problem guiding Song Wei and Ling Qingxue. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue’s foundations were already very solid, and they had already been in contact with cultivation for a few days. Therefore, their performance was much better than when they first started learning the “absolute beginning Scripture”, especially the relatively simple parts at the beginning, which they could basically understand on their own.

Xia ruofei’s mouth was dry from all the talking. He finally explained the Qi refining stage part of the technique to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

He picked up the teacup on the coffee table, took a sip, and then said with a smile,””I’ve basically taught you all what you need to know, but I don’t suggest that you start cultivating the “nichang Heart Sutra” today. I think it’s best to go back and study the contents of the cultivation method. You must understand it thoroughly, and then we’ll start our first cultivation. At that time, I’ll be on the side to protect you!”

When it came to cultivation, Xia ruofei naturally had more say than Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

Hence, the two of them nodded in agreement.

“In addition, you must take good care of the cultivation technique.” Xia ruofei said,”this cultivation technique has been lost in the cultivation world. If the news gets out, I’m afraid many people will covet it. Therefore, I suggest that even if you want to review the old and learn the new, you must pay attention to your safety. Don’t take it out in public, and it’s best to take it out when you’re alone at home. Also, when you don’t need it, just put it in your storage ring! That’s the safest place!” Hence, even if Xia ruofei had never cultivated the “nichang Heart Sutra”, he had a deep understanding of martial arts.
