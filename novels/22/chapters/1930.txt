Chapter 1931 Reward (1)

After the call, Liu haojun fell into silence.

Fan Tianfeng told him that it was already too late when he called. The news video had already been broadcast on the evening news at 9 o’ clock. Of course, this was not the most serious thing. What was more troublesome was that as early as half an hour ago, the official Weibo of Haixi satellite TV had already pushed the news.

Fan Tianfeng said that he had already coordinated with Haixi satellite TV to delete the news video in the rebroadcast. At the same time, he had also asked them to delete their Weibo posts. However, the impact had already been caused. There were hundreds of reposts on Weibo. Deleting the original Weibo post might not eliminate the negative impact, because there must be people who had saved the video and continued to spread it on Weibo and other platforms.

This was a news video released by the TV station, so there was no problem with breaking the law at all. There was no need to worry about what would happen if it reached 500 reposts.

Fan Tianfeng made it very clear that this was all he could do for Liu haojun. After all, he was not in charge of the publicity department, and Weibo was a national platform. The southeast province’s publicity department did not have absolute power to influence Weibo.

In fact, a provincial publicity department could do something like this if they were to coordinate it carefully. However, fan Tianfeng was obviously not willing to spare no effort in doing it.

To put it bluntly, this was not something to show off. He had done so much for Liu haojun within his ability, and he had already done his best.

Fan Tianfeng also tactfully suggested that Liu haojun ask for help from the Liu family in the capital to eliminate the negative impact of this incident.

After all, the news videos were all censored, and it had not caused a viral spread, so the impact was limited. Once it became a hot topic of public opinion, and his identity was exposed, his power would be gone, and his political future would be bleak.

The power of human search was well known in the internet age, not to mention that Fang Chenchen’s husband’s side was also filled with righteous indignation. If they were to reveal any information, Liu haojun would be in a very passive position.

Therefore, fan Tianfeng also advised Liu haojun to get rid of Liu Dong as soon as possible. No matter what price he had to pay, he had to make Liu Dong shut up.

Liu haojun’s face was frighteningly dark. He held Fang Chenchen’s phone tightly as he was having an intense mental struggle.

He really didn’t dare to ask for help from his family at this time.

One could imagine how furious the old master in the capital would be if he knew about this.

When he left the capital, the old man had made it clear that this was his last chance. If he caused any more trouble in the local area, the family would give up on his training. In other words, he would come to an end in the system.

But if he didn’t ask his family for help, what else could he do?

All of his connections were built on the foundation of his family, especially the connections within the system. It was simply a fool’s dream for him to use these connections without his family’s knowledge.

Fang Chenchen quietly sat by the bed and peeled an Apple for Liu haojun. When she saw Liu haojun sitting there in a daze, she passed him the peeled apple and said,””Jun bro, have an Apple first!”

Liu haojun suddenly flew into a rage and pushed the Apple away, causing it to roll far away,

Then, Liu haojun slapped him again and scolded,””Get lost! Stinky B * tch! It’s all because of you! That’s why I’m in such a sorry state!”

Fang Chenchen held her burning cheek and looked at Liu haojun in disbelief.

Ever since they met, Liu haojun had always been sweet – talking her. Putting aside the guilt in her heart and Liu haojun’s ability in that aspect, she sometimes had the illusion that she was being pampered.

But today, Fang Chenchen had seen another side of Liu haojun.

She was the biggest victim of this incident. Not only did Liu haojun not comfort her, but he also put all the blame on her. He was no longer as gentle and considerate as before, and his attitude had become so rough.

This made Fang Chenchen’s heart turn cold, and at the same time, the regret in her heart grew stronger ...

Liu haojun glared at Fang Chenchen and shouted,””What are you looking at me for? Get lost!”

Fang Chenchen was filled with hatred for Liu haojun.

It was her own vanity that had led her to where she was today. Back then, she had also slept with Liu haojun after a bit of hesitation. If Liu haojun had not tried to please her back then, how would things have turned out this way? She knew very well that Liu haojun had his eyes on her since the first time they met. He didn’t even try to hide the desire in his eyes.

Now that something had happened, not only did he insult her, but he also kicked her away, wanting to immediately cut off their relationship. How could Fang Chenchen not hate him?

However, no matter how much she hated him, Fang Chenchen did not dare to show it. She had been with Liu haojun for a few months and knew very well what kind of power he had. He was not someone ordinary people like her and Liu Dong could compete with.

Fang Chenchen looked at Liu haojun with a sad look, got up, and walked to the door of the ward.

“Wait!” Liu haojun said coldly.

Fang Chenchen stopped in her tracks and turned around to look at Liu haojun silently.

“Take your phone away!” Liu haojun said,”also, go back and tell your husband to watch his mouth! As long as this matter doesn’t spread, I can consider letting him go! If he dares to go around and say that you know my strength, I don’t need to say more, right? You, your husband ... Oh right, you guys have a cute daughter, right?”

Fang Chenchen’s body trembled violently, and a chill ran down her spine.

“Big brother Jun, I’ll remind him ...” She quickly said.

“Get lost!” Liu haojun said as he looked at Fang Chenchen in disgust.

Fang Chenchen picked up her phone and walked out of the ward. Her legs felt weak and the fear in her heart could not be any greater. Although she did not know how to face her husband who had once loved her deeply, she had no choice but to go back ...

……

Liu haojun was lying in the hospital waiting for ol ‘Zhou. He had to come up with a plan as soon as possible.

At this time, in the rental house in the old community opposite the West Lake Mansion, Xu Yougang and the others had already packed their things and were ready to leave.

The whole plan was executed perfectly. Some of the expected accidents didn’t happen. In fact, the situation was even better than expected. For example, Liu haojun actually fainted at the critical moment, which also allowed the news on Haixi TV to be broadcast smoothly.

It was already close to ten at night. Wang Chong and the other two were resting in the rented house while Xu Yougang went to a teahouse near Xibin road alone. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Although it was called a teahouse, it mainly provided Mahjong and mahjong tables for customers to entertain themselves, so it was basically open all night.

Of course, compared to the teahouses that could be seen everywhere on the streets of the three mountains, this teahouse was more high – end in its decoration and more elegant environment.

Smoke rose in the private room, and the sandalwood incense in the incense burner burned quietly.

Xia ruofei smiled at Xu Yougang who was sitting opposite him and said,””Old Xu, well done! The execution of my brothers has exceeded my expectations! Although I didn’t go to the scene, I’ve been paying attention to your actions today, and the results were very good!”

“It’s all thanks to your good planning, brother Xia,” Xu Yougang said humbly.”We’re just in charge of the execution.”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”a good plan has to be carried out properly!” After all, the situation is ever – changing, and the four of you have to keep an eye on so many clues. It’s impossible to do it without good planning and super ability, so don’t be modest!”

“Thank you for the compliment, brother Xia.” Xu Yougang said.

Xia ruofei reached out and picked up a backpack by his feet. He threw it to Xu Yougang and said,””This is the reward I promised you!”

In order to prevent any accidents, Xia ruofei was very cautious in choosing cash. For this reason, he had specially made an appointment to withdraw money in advance and had prepared the money in advance.

In fact, Xia ruofei had also withdrawn a lot of cash and stored it in the spirit map space. Although mobile payment was very common now, cash was more suitable in many cases, such as this situation.

“Thank you, brother Xia!” Xu Yougang said gratefully.

“Count it!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Yes!” Xu Yougang didn’t hesitate. He opened his backpack and took out the stacks of money.

After all, this wasn’t his money alone. There were three brothers waiting for the money, so it was better to count clearly in person.

Of course, he couldn’t count them one by one. Otherwise, he might not be able to count them even by the second half of the night.

The money that Xia ruofei gave him was directly withdrawn from the bank. It was ten thousand Yuan per stack. He just had to count how many stacks there were.

To be honest, the feeling of a stack of red bills in front of him was still very shocking, especially for Xu Yougang, who was very short of money. His heart could not help but race.

As he counted, Xu Yougang raised his head in surprise and said,””Brother Xia, the amount doesn’t seem right! You’re giving too much ...”

There were 100 stacks of 100 – Yuan bills here, which was a full one million Yuan.

Xia ruofei had promised to pay each of them 200000 Yuan, and he had already paid half of it before the operation started. Now, he only needed to pay Xu Yougang another 400000 Yuan. There was too much money here!

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’ve completed your mission very well. This is your reward!” Including the money they had paid in advance, each of them would receive 300000 Yuan! The remaining 200000 Yuan is for your vacation funds. Tomorrow, you guys can go to Sanya for a dozen days of vacation. This money should be enough to spend. Anyway, I’ll refund more and make up for less!”

Xu Yougang and the others were taking a big risk to help Xia ruofei, so Xia ruofei would not be stingy to them. On one hand, they had been very tense these days and needed to relax. On the other hand, he more or less wanted to go out and lie low for a while.

Although Xu Yougang and the other three had been very careful and professional during the execution of the plan and had not left any traces, there was always a possibility!

“Brother Xia, this is too much!” Xu Yougang quickly said. We can’t take it. Actually, liangzi and I both think that 200000 is too much, and we didn’t do anything ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”there’s no need to talk about this. You’ve done a great job. You deserve this money.” I’ve already promised you that we’ll go on a vacation, so let’s not delay it any longer. Book a plane ticket tonight and leave early tomorrow!”
