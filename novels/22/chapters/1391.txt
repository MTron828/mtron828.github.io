Chapter 1392: The lazy boss (2)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Rao thought for a while and nodded.”After all, the production of Pomfret is limited. I agree with your opinion. It’s enough to find a strong enough distributor!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I think so too. Whether it’s an e – commerce or a physical hypermarket, we’ll only choose one.” Of course, as you said, in addition to whether the other party’s conditions are favorable or not, our judgment should also be based on the other party’s strength and target customers. As for the convenience supermarket, at least in the sales of pomfrets, I have no interest in cooperating!”

“Understood!” Feng Jing said,”I’ll personally follow up on this project.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m assured that you’ll do it!” Just tell me the result!”

Feng Rao smiled bitterly and nodded in resignation,””I know! I won’t let you down ...”

Xia ruofei laughed out loud.

At this time, the water in the teapot was boiling. Xia ruofei poured some water to heat up the purple clay teapot and washed the teacups. Then, he took out the tea box, scooped some tea leaves with a spoon, and put them into the purple clay teapot. He started to brew the tea skillfully.

“Sister ran, please continue. I’m listening!” He said without raising his head.

“There are still a few things that I need you to decide,” said Feng Rao.

She glanced at the notebook and continued,””The first is the news conference for the heart – nourishing soup. It’s scheduled for the morning of the day after tomorrow. We’ve rented the venue at the Sanshan conference hall. The media invitations have already been sent out. Factory manager Xue would like to invite you to attend as well ...”

“Sure, but I won’t say anything,” Xia ruofei replied without thinking.

The heart – nourishing soup was an important product of his company. Furthermore, the release of this medicine on the market was definitely a good thing for doing good. He naturally had to be there to express his support. Even if he did not say anything, as the big boss, his presence was a great encouragement to the staff of the pharmaceutical factory.

Although Xia ruofei did not ask about the preparations for the press conference, he still continued to pay attention to it.

“Okay, I’ll let manager Xue know in a bit,” Feng Jing nodded.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”the pharmaceutical factory must be very busy these days, right?”

“Isn’t it? The production line of the jaded skin ointment is almost non – stop except for routine maintenance and overhaul. The workers work in three shifts. ” Feng Jing replied,”although the Yangxin soup hasn’t had a product launch yet, it’s already a Chinese medicine that has been approved for the market. That’s why we’ve already received a lot of orders from hospitals that have participated in the clinical trials.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this. This was great. He didn’t even need a pharmaceutical sales representative. He didn’t even need to go to the public relations department or the hospital leaders to produce a drug, and they took the initiative to send an order. He just had to ask if he was convinced!

“I’m afraid that after the conference, the number of orders will continue to grow!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Xue Jinshan should be mentally prepared.”

“I think he’s well prepared.” Feng Jing said,”on one hand, we have a lot of stock in stock, so it should be enough for a while. On the other hand, factory manager Xue has also started to prepare for the future. He has already submitted the report for the additional production line and the recruitment of new workers.”

“Mm! If you really need it, then buy it and hire it!” Xia ruofei said,”let me know if you don’t have enough liquid funds. I still have a lot of money ...”

The purchase of the Heng Li building had almost used up all of paradise corporation’s working capital. Even the money from the first sale of Cordyceps sinensis had been used on it. In addition, the renovation of the new headquarters was still in progress. The more familiar Xia ruofei was with Liang Weimin, the more he couldn’t owe him for the construction and materials. Therefore, he had also instructed pang Hao from the finance department to settle the payment on time.

In addition, the company was getting bigger and bigger, and the daily expenses such as the salaries of the staff were not a small amount.

In this case, unless they rushed to buy the jaded skin cream again, they would be financially stretched for a period of time.

However, the frequency of buying jaded skin cream was too high. On the one hand, the production capacity could not keep up, and on the other hand, the essence of hunger marketing could not be lost.

That was why Xia ruofei was worried that the financial department would not be able to handle it well.

Feng Rao smiled.”There’s no problem with the funds for the time being ... Ruofei, don’t forget that we have a lot of profitable businesses. The vegetables we earn every day are enough to sustain our expenses. Besides, the sales of our online flagship store is getting higher and higher. The profits of the store such as iron – Skin fengdou and Peach Garden Da Hong Pao are very high.”

“That’s good! Just let me know if you’re short of money. ” Xia ruofei said,”I have money here.”

Originally, Xia ruofei did not have much money in his private account, so most of his money was in his overseas account.

However, Ding Feng winery’s dividends would be in his account soon. Xia ruofei would be able to get about 50 million Yuan. More than half of the money for the investment club had been settled. If the company needed it, he could use this money at any time.

“I know you’re rich,” Feng Jing said with a smile.”Why don’t you give me a few million?”

“If sister che is short on money, it’s not a problem!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation.

“I’m just joking!”Feng Rao quickly replied. What do I need so much money for?”

Although Feng Rao was just joking, Xia ruofei agreed without hesitation. She was touched.
