Chapter 1752: Another gift of ink (2)

Xu Zi Xuan and the others also expressed that this name was quite good. As for the issue of ownership, it was enough for the brothers to be clear in their hearts, who cared what the outside world thought?

In the end, except for Xia ruofei, everyone voted in favor of the name “Paradise Club.” Xia ruofei’s objection was invalid, and the issue of the name of the club was officially passed.

Then, Zhao Yongjun began to assign tasks to everyone. In addition to the guests, everyone had to share other tasks. Some went to find a design company to make the of the Paradise gathering, some contacted the Guild management company to take charge of the specific preparations, and some arranged for construction teams to make sure that there was a representative of the construction party at the foundation laying ceremony. They also had to put up some construction machinery, symbolically dig the soil, and so on.

Considering that Xia ruofei was not familiar with many people in the capital, Zhao Yongjun did not give him any specific tasks.

Of course, this did not mean that Xia ruofei was relaxed. If anything happened during the groundbreaking ceremony, Xia ruofei would have to handle it, especially when it came to formations. Even if it was handed over to someone else, there had to be someone who knew how to do it!

The few of them were full of energy. After discussing, they left the courtyard house one after another and began to act separately.

For the next few days, Xia ruofei had a lot of free time.

Every day, he would make himself tea and stroll around. He even took time to go to the big fence to listen to two crosstalk performances.

Xia ruofei also called Song Wei. He wanted to practice with her again when he was free.

Song Wei, who was originally very enthusiastic about cultivation, turned down the offer unexpectedly. Her reason was very weak. She said that there was a heavy task for a research project recently. It was a big project that ran through the entire graduate stage and was related to the graduation oral defense. She also said that she didn’t have much time for the next few days.

Xia ruofei could vaguely guess the reason behind it. He had mixed feelings about Song Wei’s deliberate estrangement. On one hand, he was happy to see such a situation, so that Song Wei would not fall deeper and deeper. On the other hand, she was more or less a little disappointed.

He even felt that his cultivation was dull. He just hoped that the matters in the capital would be settled soon so that he could return to the three mountains.

On the third day, Xia ruofei suddenly received a call from boss song’s Secret Manager Lu.

“Little Xia, are you home today?” Manager Lu asked with a smile as soon as the call connected.

“Hello, manager Lu!” Xia ruofei greeted him politely and said,”I’ve been free these few days! Do you have any instructions?”

Manager Lu jokingly said,”how would I dare to give instructions to a hero like you!” Xiao Xia, the chief has something to give you. If you’re at home, I’ll come over to deliver it. ”

“Manager Lu, I don’t dare to trouble you to come here personally. Let me do it!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

Manager Lu laughed and said,”you’re welcome!” I’m not here to give you anything, but I have something to do at the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference this afternoon, so I brought it for you!”

Xia ruofei didn’t argue and said,””Alright, I’ll be waiting for you at home!”

“Hahaha! “You ...” Manager Lu said.”I’ll be at your place at about threeo’ clock. Don’t go out!”

Xia ruofei patted his chest and said,”don’t worry!” I’ll be staying at home today! I won’t take a single step out of the door before I see you!”

“Woof! You’ve learned how to be glib!” Manager Lu joked,”it seems like you’ve been in Beijing for a long time. You’ve become more eloquent!”

“You’re too kind!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei was wondering what elder song would give him. Manager Lu even had to personally make a trip to deliver it ...

He thought about it for a long time, but he still couldn’t figure it out. He finished his lunch with this question in mind, then told Wu Qiang to wait at the gate in advance, and he returned to the middle courtyard to take a nap.

Xia ruofei woke up at twoo’ clock. He rubbed his eyes and looked at the clock on the wall. He sat up and rushed to the bathroom to wash up. He changed into casual clothes and walked out of the bedroom.

Although manager Lu was only elder song’s Secretary, his administrative rank was at the provincial level, the same as a provincial governor. Moreover, he had always been very good to Xia ruofei, so Xia ruofei naturally didn’t dare to neglect him.

Xia ruofei strolled to the first courtyard. Wu Qiang was already waiting at the door.

Hence, Xia ruofei also walked over. While chatting with Wu Qiang, he looked at the entrance of the alley.

Manager Lu was very punctual. When it was one minute to threeo’ clock, a black sedan with a red flag appeared at the entrance of the alley.

Xia ruofei quickly asked Wu Qiang to open the side door for the car to enter and exit. Then, he walked down the steps to welcome them.

The car stopped at the entrance of the courtyard house. Manager Lu got out of the back seat with a long paper box under his arm. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Manager Lu, welcome, welcome!” Xia ruofei quickened his pace and walked forward.

“Little Xia, this place is not bad!” Manager Lu looked up and down at the door of the courtyard house and said,”looking at the shape, the original owner of this courtyard house must have been a Duke!”

Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs up and said,””Your eyes are really sharp! This was a former Qing Beile mansion! Last time, the owner of this courtyard was in urgent need of money, so I bought it ...”

“You’re really rich and overbearing now!” Manager Lu chuckled and said,”I don’t even dare to think of a courtyard like this!”
