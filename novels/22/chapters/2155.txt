“Junior,” bi youzi said with a serious expression,”I have three things to remind you of. First, the mansion – guarding wooden token would stay here for an hour. If you didn’t drip your blood on it within an hour, it would automatically escape and hide in a powerful restriction in the immortal mansion, waiting for the next fated person. By the way, don’t try to put it into a storage treasure. Before it recognizes you as its master, it can’t be put into a storage treasure. Of course, if you don’t believe me, you can try ...”

After Xia ruofei heard this, he really tried it and realized that this wooden token really couldn’t be stored in the spirit map space. It seemed like it was impossible to take this wooden token away and refine it after he broke through to the Golden core stage and transformed the genuine Qi in his body into vital Qi.

Bi youzi continued,”second, the green immortal mansion can be big or small. After you completely refine the mansion – guarding wooden token, you can even take the immortal mansion into your body and take it away.” Of course, dripping blood on it to recognize it as its master was only the first step. To completely refine the mansion – guarding wooden token, one needed to be at least in the Yuanying stage. But it doesn’t matter, as long as you refine it, you’ll be able to use some of the restrictions. Even if you’re ten thousand miles away, you’ll be able to sense the location of the immortal Island, and you can come to collect it at any time in the future. ”

Bi youzi paused for a moment before saying,””Third, if you don’t do it within an hour, not only will the mansion – guarding wooden token disappear, you will also be directly teleported out of The Enchanted Island. You will probably never find The Enchanted Island again in your life.”

When Xia ruofei heard this, he vaguely understood. This Island might not be in a fixed location. Also, because of the celestial formation, it would not be discovered by satellites or other detection means. It would appear randomly in the vast sea and find the island again after leaving. The probability of this was very low and could be ignored.

Bi youzi smiled and said,”alright, junior, that’s all I have to say!” How should you choose, please consider it yourself! I’ll give you one last warning, don’t take any chances! Even if it was me, it would be very difficult for me to keep my life when the mansion – guarding wooden tablet attacks from the dantian!”

After he finished speaking, bi youzi’s image went back to the ‘paused’ state. Obviously, he had said all that he needed to say. Next time, only when the wooden token recognized its owner by blood or some other conditions were met would other video content be triggered.

Xia ruofei looked at the wooden token in front of him and found it difficult to make a decision.

In half an hour, which was only an hour, he had to make a decision.

If he gave up, then he would basically miss this precious Immortal Island and immortal abode for the rest of his life.

Although he had obtained a flying sword and two hundred precious origin crystals, which was already an unimaginable amount of cultivation resources, he was still somewhat unwilling to give up on such a huge immortal mansion and the many treasures inside.

Furthermore, he had come here to search for the world stone. However, even after opening all three boxes, there was still no trace of the world stone! If he didn’t refine that wooden token, he would be directly teleported out of the immortal Island.

He believed that by then, he would have found the immortal Island by the time he turned back. If he looked at it from the perspective of finding the world stone, it would be equivalent to wasting his efforts.

However, Xia ruofei could not guarantee what would happen if he were to bind it with blood. After all, he did not have any vital Qi in his body. If the mansion – guarding wooden token misjudged him, no one would know even if he died of injustice.

This immortal Island was on the vast ocean. Puyol and the others had lived here for seven to eight years, but no one had discovered it. If he really died on this Island, people in the outside world would definitely think that he had gone missing. After all, he had sailed out to sea alone and then disappeared.

Xia ruofei looked at the wooden token that was giving off a milky white glow, constantly weighing the pros and cons.

As time passed, beads of sweat appeared on his forehead, and his expression was extremely conflicted.

Bi youzi had given him an hour, and Xia ruofei naturally could not wait indefinitely.

He gritted his teeth and stared at the wooden tablet, finally making up his mind.

“Let’s do it!” Xia ruofei shouted loudly to encourage himself.

Cultivating was a heaven – defying act. If he didn’t even have the courage, what was the point of cultivating? He had been cultivating the Orthodox ‘great Dao Arts’, and he had no ulterior motives. What was there to be afraid of?

If such a good opportunity was placed in front of them and they let it slip by because of cowardice, then wouldn’t they live in regret for the rest of their lives? In fact, it might even affect his Dao heart.

Xia ruofei kept giving himself psychological hints. His eyes gradually became more determined. He first summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and held it tightly in his hand. Then, he used his genuine Qi to force out a drop of blood and dripped it on the wooden board.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was also very nervous. He stared at the wooden token without blinking. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The blood immediately seeped into the wooden token after it fell on it. At the same time, he immediately felt that he had established a very close mental connection with the wooden token.

Of course, this connection was somewhat different from the connection between him and the spirit map and painting scroll. It was even different from the connection with the blue immortal sword. He could feel that this wooden token was not under his control for the time being. It was only a trace of thought connection.
