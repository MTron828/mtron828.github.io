2359 Clean – up (2)

After he finished speaking, his mind moved and he directly grabbed Bao Guijun back into the space.

Bao Guijun felt a familiar sense of dizziness and then he found himself back in the mobile house.

Qian guiyou and the others looked at him with wide eyes.

Bao Guijun looked around and couldn’t help but ask in surprise, “Where’s Huang rujue?”

“Baosang!” Qian guiyou said. Just now, you suddenly disappeared from the room and then appeared here without any warning. Almost at the same time, Huang sang disappeared again!”

Park taishu from bangziguo couldn’t help but ask curiously,””Brother Guijun, where did you go just now?”

Bao Guijun thought of Xia ruofei’s last warning and couldn’t help but shiver. He quickly said,”Park taishu, can you just ask about master’s matters?”

Park taishu’s face changed slightly and he hurriedly said,””I misspoke!”

In the mobile house, no matter how curious they were, they didn’t dare to ask what happened when Bao Guijun disappeared.

Of course, they didn’t feel like sleeping anymore. They were all waiting for Huang rujue to appear.

Naturally, Huang rujue had been taken to the outside world by Xia ruofei.

Although he felt that Bao Guijun didn’t have the guts to play tricks, he still brought Huang rujue, who also knew the arulei dialect, to the outside world. He let Huang rujue translate and asked the same question again.

Huang rujue and Bao GUI definitely wouldn’t have thought that there would be a temporary mission tonight, so they couldn’t have gone ahead of time. The answers they got from the two inquiries confirmed that Bao GUI was not playing any tricks.

In the end, the answer Huang rujue got was almost the same as the one Bao Guijun gave him. Some of the expressions were slightly different, but the overall meaning was almost the same.

This meant that neither of them was lying.

Xia ruofei nodded with satisfaction and warned Huang rujue as well. Then, he put him into the medium.

In the mountain and sea realm of the spirit map space, inside the mobile temporary house.

Bao Guijun thought for a while and understood Xia ruofei’s intention. Fortunately, he didn’t play any tricks, so he didn’t feel guilty at all.

After a while, Huang rujue also appeared out of thin air in the mobile house.

Then, Xia ruofei’s voice rang in the air.””Xia Qing, Bao Guijun, and Huang rujue did well. You will each be rewarded with a pack of cigarettes.”

Xia Qing was a spiritual puppet, so he didn’t need to rest. After sending Bao Guijun and the others into the space cage, he returned to the herb garden to work.

After hearing Xia ruofei’s voice, Xia Qing immediately put down her hoe and bowed slightly,””Yes, master!”

After a while, two packs of cigarettes flew in from the window of the mobile house. They came to Bao Guijun and Huang rujue and floated in front of them. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Bao Guijun and Huang rujue grabbed the cigarettes in their hands as if they had found a treasure. They shouted,””Thank you, master! Thank you, manager Xia Qing!”

Qian guiyou and the others looked at Bao Guijun and Huang rujue enviously, especially Park taishu, who also knew some arulei dialect. He felt quite regretful. If he had known that it would be so easy to get the reward, he would have been the first one to step forward! It was too late to say anything now ...

Xia ruofei naturally had no time to care about the thoughts of the people in the medium. He raised his hand and looked at his watch. Then, he directly put pardu and the other black man into the medium.

During the interrogation, Xia ruofei had specifically asked if they had killed anyone and if they had killed the innocent or committed any other crimes.

The answer was naturally yes, especially training camp guard Pasu. After being in Basoko town for so many years, he had already killed several people. Once, because he coveted a student’s money, he even secretly found an opportunity to kill the student.

The other black man was also responsible for the lives of others. He was also a local of arulei, and it was precisely because he had killed people that he had come here to become a mercenary.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not have any psychological burden and directly put the two of them into the medium.

Xia ruofei had specially designated a space cage with a large area to imprison the free labor force that they had captured. Just like that, pardu and the other Black Student became the first two “residents” of the space cage.

After capturing the two black men, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to sneak into the town.

According to the statements he had just obtained, Xia ruofei knew that they would change shifts at midnight, then every four hours. At four in the morning, someone would come and change shifts.

Xia ruofei decided to wait until the next group of sentries was subdued before sneaking in.

This was because at two or three in the morning, one would usually be the most soundly asleep, and their vigilance would be very low. This way, the success rate of the operation would naturally be higher.

Xia ruofei was very patient. He sat down unhurriedly and hid behind the shadow of a big tree. He raised his hand to look at his watch from time to time. At the same time, he would use his mental power to scan the surroundings.

Very soon, it was close to midnight.

In order to avoid missing the target, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power began to investigate continuously.

After a while, two people with long Spears on their backs appeared within the range of Xia ruofei’s spiritual power. They were getting closer and closer. They were obviously here to change shifts.

Xia ruofei’s spirit was lifted. He got up from the ground and dusted off his pants. Then, he lowered his body and stared at the two prey that were getting closer and closer.

His hearing was extraordinary, so when the two were still far away, he could hear the two of them chatting. This time, they were speaking English.

“Why don’t I see Pasu? Our Sentry’s activity area tonight is over here!”

“They’re probably patrolling in front! Let’s go a little closer and see!”

“Don’t tell me that this kid left his post with the students and ran back to sleep?”

……

The two of them didn’t notice anything. They were talking in low voices as they walked towards Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei also held his breath quietly. When the two people walked past him without him noticing, he suddenly jumped out of the grass.

It was still two clean hand – Blades, and the two sentries didn’t even have time to groan before they fell to the ground.

Xia ruofei dragged them to the side of the road, one in each hand. Then, it was the familiar interrogation.

This time, the two of them knew English, so Xia ruofei did not need the help of a translator. He could ask directly.

After a while, Xia ruofei finished his questions. With a thought, he kept the two of them into the space, locking them in the same cage as the two black brothers.

After Xia ruofei had succeeded, he immediately followed the small path to the Northwest and moved quickly. By now, the guards at the various positions outside the town should have finished changing. Xia ruofei was going to start a big clean – up.

In the silent night, Xia ruofei’s figure was like a ghost.

It took him about an hour to subdue all the sentries outside of Basoko town.

Every time he caught one, he would ask for their statement. If he met one who couldn’t speak English, he would ask Bao Guijun and Huang rujue to help translate. If they couldn’t speak English or arulei, he would put them directly into the space. Anyway, these people weren’t good people, and the probability of them being wronged was negligible.

By oneo’ clock in the morning, Xia ruofei had already cleared the security perimeter of Basoko town.

He rested for a while and adjusted his condition. Then, he raised his hand and looked at his watch.

It was around two in the morning, the time when one was most soundly asleep. It was the best time to sneak into the training camp.

After asking more than ten confessions, Xia ruofei now had a more comprehensive understanding of the training camp, including where the person in charge of the training camp nicknamed “Golden Fox” was most likely.

In the dark of the night, Xia ruofei’s figure was as fast as lightning as he flew directly towards the modr organization’s Secret training camp in the southeast of Basoko town.
