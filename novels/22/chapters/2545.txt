Translator: 5496903The broadcast also noticed the situation on the sidelines. The director immediately cut the scene to the first half. After all, it was very rare to make a substitution 30 minutes into the first half, and to change two players at once.

There were only three substitutions in a game. Unless there were special circumstances such as accidental injuries, the manager would generally choose to make a change in the second half. Furthermore, the use of substitutions was also very cautious and would not use up the substitutions early.

Because in that case, once someone was injured in the later games and could not persist in the game, and the team no longer had any substitution spots, they could only face a passive situation of fewer players against more players.

Ruby was also desperate.

In fact, the two substitutions were both adjustments. Wu Lei replaced puado’s position and was the right wing during the attack. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, replaced the right midfielder, Granello, who had yet to recover from his old injury.

It was already a bit difficult for Granello to play in this game. He was clearly affected by his injury during the game and did not dare to make any moves.

Ruby took into account that Xia ruofei and Wu Lei were fellow countrymen, and they might be able to communicate more smoothly on the side. He was also worried that Granello’s injury would worsen if he forced himself to play.

In the pre – Match Plan, Ruby was originally prepared to let Granello play half of the game. He could understand that Granello had been brought off about ten minutes in advance.

Therefore, when a dead ball appeared on the field and the manager signaled for a substitution, Granello glanced at the substitution card on the sidelines and jogged down the field. This way, Xia ruofei could go on the field directly.

Next, when Wu Lei replaced pouado, pouado looked unhappy. He did not care that the team was still two goals behind. He mumbled as he slowly walked toward the center line.

Ruby was so anxious that he kept waving his hands to signal puado to come down from the sidelines. However, puador pretended not to see anything and walked to the center line with his head down. He did not high five Wu Lei and just walked past him as if he was air. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ruby glared at puador but puador didn’t dare to meet Ruby’s eyes. He lowered his head and went straight to the substitute seat and sat down. Then, he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.

As Wu Lei’s Spanish was not good, Xia ruofei had another task after he came on. He had to convey the latest tactical arrangements of head coach Ruby to everyone and clarify everyone’s positions again. After all, they had changed two players. If he did not make it clear, everyone’s positions, including the arrangement of marking during defense, and so on, would be easy to make mistakes.

Xia ruofei used the Spain Language to convey the manager’s instructions to everyone. He did not know that the scene he had just played had been faithfully recorded by the camera.

It was better overseas as not many people knew him. Meanwhile, the Internet in China was in an uproar at that moment.

……

When changing players, the broadcast would usually give a close – up shot. As Granello was the closest to the stage, the broadcast only gave Granello a close – up shot before Xia ruofei entered the stage.

However, the camera still managed to capture a close – up of Xia ruofei. At this time, he was communicating the coach’s instructions to his teammates in Spanish.

In the away team stands, as Xia ruofei and Wu Lei were waiting on the sidelines, Xue Jinshan couldn’t help but Mutter,””Why do I feel like that person looks a little like President Xia?”

The scene was very noisy, and an employee of paradise Corporation didn’t hear what Xue Jinshan was saying, so he asked casually,””Factory manager Xue, what did you say?”

Xue Jinshan took another look at Xia ruofei and said loudly,””I mean, the person who’s about to go on stage looks a little like CEO Xia!”

The away team’s stands were further away from the center line. Even people with good eyesight couldn’t see what the people on the sidelines looked like. At most, they could only see a general idea.

After the employee heard Xue Jinshan’s words, he laughed and said,”Factory manager Xue, how is that possible? Aren’t you overthinking this? Hahaha ...”

The other employees asked what the two were talking about, and the employee next to Xue Jinshan, Feng Lijun, repeated Xue Jinshan’s words to everyone. Everyone could not help but laugh.

At this moment, the broadcast cut to a close – up of Xia ruofei. The big screen in the stadium also showed the close – up.

Xue Jinshan jumped up from his seat and pointed at the big screen,”Guys, look! Look! It’s really President Xia!”

“Ah?” When Feng Lijun and the others saw the scene on the big screen, they were all dumbfounded, as if they were clay sculptures. The scene was particularly abrupt in the stands where the visiting fans were singing and dancing.

“This ... How did President Xia become a player?” Xue Jinshan couldn’t believe his eyes.

However, after asking the staff from glory world Corporation who was in charge of receiving them, they finally confirmed that Xia ruofei had really signed a contract with the Spanish club and became a professional player.

Xue Jinshan and the others were dumbstruck.

At this moment, the Internet in China was in an uproar.

When Xia ruofei’s close – up appeared, PP sports ‘commentator Shen fangjian said,””Let’s see the new player, number 25. This mysterious player has finally revealed his true colors today. It is clear that he is a player from the East. Combined with his very Chinese – styled name, we can confirm that he is Chinese. He is another Chinese player that the Spanish club has brought in after Wu Lei!”
