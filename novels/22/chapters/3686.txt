Chapter 3687: Dedicated teaching (2)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei opened the mystic origin Scripture and read through it.

He found that this was indeed a very simple and elementary cultivation technique. In all fairness, this cultivation technique was much inferior to the many basic cultivation techniques he had obtained from the Jade talisman of inheritance.

This was normal. The inheritance of the cultivation world had been seriously damaged more than three hundred years ago. Now, most of the cultivation methods left by the cultivation sects were not satisfactory. The heavenly sect was considered to have a deep foundation, but some sects couldn’t even take out such ancient books and techniques.

Many things about cultivation were similar. Xia ruofei had received many cultivation techniques and inherited the cultivation experience of his seniors. Hence, he was much more knowledgeable than most cultivators of the same level.

Therefore, he could basically understand such a simple cultivation technique after reading it once.

However, Xia ruofei could not understand why cultivators who had cultivated this technique would be favored by the weapon spirit of the seven Star Pavilion. If the seven Star Pavilion really had a weapon spirit…

Could it be that this Artifact Spirit’s vision was so low?

Or was there something special about this cultivation technique that even he himself had not discovered?

Xia ruofei read the manual from the beginning to the end with doubts.

He didn’t find anything special.

Of course, if there was really something special about this technique, then all of the heavenly sect’s disciples, especially a golden core expert like Chen Xuan who had cultivated this technique personally, would have been able to tell long ago.

After reading it twice, Xia ruofei had already memorized all the contents of the black origin Sutra.

He closed the manuscript of the mysterious origin Scripture and said with a smile,””Brother Chen, I’ve finished reading it! I’ll return this manuscript to you! I’ve already memorized the contents.”

For a golden core cultivator like Xia ruofei, his memory was extraordinary. Chen Xuan was no different. Hence, he was not surprised. He smiled and nodded. Then, he took the handwritten copy and kept it in his storage ring. “Brother ruofei,” Chen Xuan continued,”let me share with you some of my experiences while cultivating this technique!”

“Then I’ll have to trouble brother Chen!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Since Xia ruofei had already learned the techniques of the first heaven society, it was no big deal for Chen Xuan to teach him a little more.

Chen Xuan immediately explained everything he knew, including the notes left behind by the disciples of the first heaven society who had cultivated the mystic essence Scripture. He explained everything to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei nodded.”That’s true. After all, even sect leader Chen has yet to fully control the seven Star Pavilion. It’s not easy to figure out the rules.”

If Chen Nanfeng could make the seven Star Pavilion recognize him as its master, then he would naturally know all of the seven Star Pavilion’s secrets. However, in this situation, the first heaven society could only make a guess based on their limited experience.

“That’s why we’re just guessing,”Chen Xuan replied with a smile. In fact, we’ve calculated the harvest of the Aurous core stage disciples who have entered the seven Star Pavilion over the years and found a more interesting thing. Most of the disciples who have cultivated a certain cultivation technique have better harvest. The proportion of them who can get high – grade flying swords or storage rings or magic treasures of this level accounts for more than 70%. As for the disciples who did not cultivate this technique, only about 20% of them would have good gains. Thus, we boldly speculated that the seven stars Pavilion might have already produced an Artifact Spirit, and the artifact Spirit has a particularly good impression of cultivators who have cultivated this cultivation technique, so it will give special treatment…” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but widen his eyes and smile.”Why does this matter sound so mysterious?”

Chen Xuan laughed bitterly.”It’s indeed a little illogical to say it out loud, but it’s the truth. Including me, I’ve also cultivated that technique. The second time I entered the seven stars Pavilion, 1 obtained the autumn water flying sword. This flying sword is my main magical treasure that I’ve been using until now!” Xia ruofei nodded and asked,””Brother Chen’s harvest should be considered good among all the Golden core cultivators who have entered the seven Star Pavilion, right?”

“Indeed,” Chen Xuan nodded with a smile. So, I’ve experienced it myself, so I have to believe it!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that makes sense!” What you hear is false, but what you see is true. Not to mention, you’ve actually put it into practice!” “Brother ruofei, the reason 1 called you here is to pass this technique to you. This technique is actually a basic technique for Qi condensation disciples. It’s not that difficult. Brother ruofei should be able to complete the initiation in a day!” Chen Xuan said seriously.

Xia ruofei was stunned and quickly said,””Brother Chen, the Dao can not be passed on easily. I’m not a disciple of the first heaven society, so how can I cultivate the first heaven society’s techniques? This is against the rules!” “Brother ruofei, you’re overthinking it!” Chen Xuan chuckled. This cultivation technique was called the “black origin Scripture”. It was only an entry – Level cultivation technique and not some precious secret technique that was not taught to others. In fact, we have a few of these foundation techniques in the sect. After reaching Level 1, the disciples of the first heaven sect can freely choose one. The black origin Scripture isn’t the most effective technique, so many of the disciples of the first heaven sect didn’t choose it in the past. It’s also because of this that we concluded that there’s a rule. Back then, I tried to cultivate it because 1 wanted to study cultivation techniques and learn from others. Of course, this cultivation technique has now been listed as a compulsory cultivation technique for all disciples. After all, in the current cultivation world, the Golden core stage is already considered a master. We also hope that the Golden core cultivators in the sect can have a good harvest in the seven Star Pavilion!”

Xia ruofei said,”even if it’s just a basic cultivation technique, it’s not appropriate for brother Chen to teach it to an outsider like me. Brother Chen, your father is already taking special care of me by giving me the opportunity to enter that special area. This ‘black origin Sutra’… 1 think we should forget it!” “But that’s exactly what my father told me to do!” Chen Xuan laughed. He even specially instructed me to let you finish learning this cultivation technique before entering the seven Star Pavilion. Don’t waste this rare opportunity!” “But…”

Before Xia ruofei could finish, Chen Xuan waved his hand and said,””Brother RUO Fei, please give me a chance to repay you! Compared to the kindness you’ve shown to the heavenly sect, what’s a mere basic cultivation technique? We can’t use the treasures in the seven Star Pavilion. Since brother RUO Fei wants to enter that special area, you must naturally obtain the best treasures! Could it be that brother RUO Fei doesn’t want to learn it just so we can always owe you a big favor?”

Since Chen Xuan had already said this, Xia ruofei could not reject him even if he wanted to.

“If that’s the case, then… Then thank you, brother Chen and sect leader Chen!” He said with a bitter smile.

“This is right!” Chen Xuan said happily,”come, come, come! Let’s drink first! After dinner, I’ll teach you the cultivation technique immediately. My father is preparing to teach the sect for one day tomorrow and let everyone enter the seven Star Pavilion the day after tomorrow. You must at least complete the introduction of the cultivation technique before the day after tomorrow! I think, with brother ruofei’s talent, it definitely won’t be a problem!” “Alright! I’ll toast to brother Chen!” Xia ruofei said as he raised his glass.

The two of them clinked their glasses and downed their drinks in one go. “Come! Let’s eat!” Chen Xuan chuckled.”Have a taste of my chef’s cooking!”

After the meal, Chen Xuan ordered his disciples to dismiss the banquet and everyone else. He then took out a thin booklet from his storage ring.

He smiled as he passed the booklet to Xia ruofei and said,””This is the” mysterious origin Scripture. “Brother RUO Fei, you can first memorize the contents, and then 1 will explain it to you in detail! This is a handwritten copy. Brother RUO Fei can keep it for yourself to study slowly in the future! This time, you only need to cultivate it to the entry level.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei nodded and took the booklet.

Xia ruofei opened the mystic origin Scripture and read through it.

He found that this was indeed a very simple and elementary cultivation technique. In all fairness, this cultivation technique was much inferior to the many basic cultivation techniques he had obtained from the Jade talisman of inheritance.

This was normal. The inheritance of the cultivation world had been seriously damaged more than three hundred years ago.
