Chapter 1497: The strange stone gate (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Are we safe?” Song Wei also heaved a sigh of relief.

Xia ruofei closed his eyes to rest. He nodded and said,”I can only say that we’re safe for now ... Song Wei, you should rest too!”

“En!” Song Wei sat down beside Xia ruofei and said gently,”I’m sorry! If I didn’t run around, I wouldn’t have triggered that mechanism. ”

Xia ruofei laughed.”It has nothing to do with you. In fact, we were trapped in a trap array the moment we entered the corridor. However, the array had been brewing its killing intent. Moreover, I’m not very experienced, so I’ve been treating it as an ordinary trap array ...”

“The formations you’re talking about sound so magical!” Song Wei asked curiously.

“This is the crystallization of the wisdom of our ancestors. It’s not a simple feudal superstition.” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes, I believe you.” Song Wei said,”many things that science can not explain actually exist.”

In the field of archeology, one would more or less come into contact with some supernatural events. There were also many rules and taboos in this field, which could not be generalized by feudal superstitions.

“We can’t find the entrance we came in from.” Song Wei continued,”what do we do now?”

Naturally, Xia ruofei had to continue searching for the world stone. However, Song Wei had come here purely to accompany him, yet she had fallen into such a dangerous situation. This made Xia ruofei feel a little apologetic.

“We’ll definitely be able to find a way out, but before that, I need to find something,”he said.

Song Wei also knew that Xia ruofei must have come for something important. Otherwise, he would not have taken the risk.

Therefore, she understood and nodded,””Mm! I’ll go with you!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Since we’re already here, you have to come with me. Otherwise, I’ll be worried about your safety!”

Xia ruofei stood up and said,””We’ve rested enough. Let’s continue deeper!”

Xia ruofei continued to follow the guidance of the Jade Leaf and groped around the dark underground Palace.

Of course, he was on high alert all the time, and the probing of his spiritual power did not stop. This was to prevent himself from falling into the formation like before.

The underground palace’s corridors were like a maze, and it felt the same no matter where they went.

At first, Song Wei tried to remember the route. However, after a while, she realized that her efforts were in vain. She gave up and followed Xia ruofei.

In any case, the cave they had just entered from was inside the trap and kill array. Unless they really could not find another exit, they would not want to go into the array again.

“What?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows.

Song Wei also noticed the abnormality immediately and could not help but widen her eyes.

At the end of the corridor in front of them, a green stone door appeared. It looked simple and heavy. The corridor ended at the stone door, and there were no other forks.

This was the first time they had seen a building other than the corridor and the statue after entering the underground palace. No matter what was behind the stone door, it was better than nothing.

With the lesson from the trap and kill array, Song Wei did not charge forward immediately. Instead, she turned around and asked,””RUO Fei, is there any danger ahead?”

“I don’t think so,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”let’s go and take a look!”

As they neared the green stone door, Xia ruofei could feel the heat of the leaf increasing.

He was secretly happy in his heart. It seemed like he was getting closer and closer to the world stone.

However, at the same time, Xia ruofei was also very cautious. The unknown poison seemed to have come from the realm stone. If there was a realm stone behind the stone door, it was very likely that the unknown poison existed.

Xia ruofei walked to the front of the green stone door and observed it carefully with the help of the flashlight.

This stone door looked ordinary and there were no decorative patterns carved on it. Moreover, the marks of knives and axes could be vaguely seen. The style was very rough.

This was the end of the corridor. It was like a dead end. Only by opening the stone door could one find a new path. Otherwise, they could only turn back.

Xia ruofei was here for the world stone. Now that he could feel the Jade Leaf’s heat, he would definitely not give up at this time.

“I have to find a way to open the stone door.” Xia ruofei said.

Song Wei observed from the side and asked,””How do I open it? Let’s look around for any traps! Wasn’t that how wuxia novels were written? Maybe it’s an unremarkable protrusion, and the door will open if you press it. ”

“It won’t be that easy!” Xia ruofei laughed.

His eyesight was much better than Song Wei ‘S. He had already looked carefully when he was walking towards the stone door. He had basically ruled out the possibility of any hidden mechanisms.

Song Wei was still unwilling to give up and continued to search for the ‘hidden mechanism’ with her strong flashlight.

Xia ruofei stood quietly in front of the stone door and released his spiritual power to investigate.

At such a close distance, any trace would be exposed under the investigation of his spiritual power.

Xia ruofei quickly noticed that the marks on the stone door were not simple. There was a faint Dao aura.

However, the charm was too vague and Xia ruofei could not find any pattern.

Of course, Xia ruofei had noticed something.

Under the cover of his spiritual power, he found that there were two faint palm prints on the stone wall beside the stone door. These palm prints were very shallow, and with the tempering of time, it was very difficult to see them with the naked eye.

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. He stepped forward and pressed his hands on the handprints.

He was just giving it a try. After all, it was unusual for two palm prints to appear on the stone wall.

However, just as his hands came into contact with the palm print, he felt a huge suction force coming from it, firmly sucking his hands on it.

Immediately after, he felt that the true Qi in his body seemed to be circulating a little uncontrollably, and it was constantly being absorbed into the stone wall through his hands.

Xia ruofei was shocked. This palm print was too strange!

However, it was already impossible to withdraw his hand at this time. He used all his strength, but he still couldn’t do it. He could only watch as the true Qi in his body was sucked out strand by strand.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned ugly. At this rate, the true Qi in his body would be exhausted in less than five minutes. If the suction force continued, he might be sucked dry.

Song Wei did not notice Xia ruofei’s strange behavior. As he was covered in the protective suit and had a gas mask on, she could not see his expression.

She was curious when she saw Xia ruofei pressing his hands on the stone wall.

However, Song Wei soon heard a creaking sound. The stone door seemed to have trembled.

Song Wei shone her flashlight on the door and noticed that there was a small crack at the bottom of the door. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“The stone door moved!” Song Wei exclaimed in surprise.

At this moment, Xia ruofei had unspeakable bitterness. He really couldn’t even open his mouth to speak.

With the infusion of his own genuine Qi, the stone door began to slowly rise as it trembled.

However, it was too slow. Xia ruofei did not know if his essential Qi could last until the stone door was fully opened. He also did not know if the suction would continue after the stone door was opened.

Now, he could only hold on.

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei with admiration. She had been searching for a long time but could not find any mechanism. She did not expect Xia ruofei to open the stone door by pressing on the stone wall so lightly. She did not know that Xia ruofei was under such great pressure.

The stone door slowly rose, and now there was a gap of 20 to 30 centimeters at the bottom of the stone door, and a faint light could be seen through the gap.

Xia ruofei wanted to remind Song Wei to be careful. After all, the inside might be filled with unknown poison. However, he could not speak at all. Once his genuine Qi was exhausted, he could not even resist the invasion of the unknown poison, let alone protect Song Wei.

One minute, two minutes, three minutes ...

The genuine Qi in Xia ruofei’s body was being consumed at an extremely fast speed. The stone door was also slowly and steadily rising.

Soon, Xia ruofei found it difficult to continue. At this time, the stone door was still 30 to 40 centimeters away from the top ...
