Chapter 70: Pouring out his heart (1)

Xia ruofei’s rented villa was about three kilometers away from the beach. It would only take a few minutes to drive there. The two of them did not speak after they got into the car, and the atmosphere was a little awkward. Xia ruofei said,” “Uh ... Let’s listen to some songs!” “Alright!” Ling Qingxue said with a faint smile. Xia ruofei turned on the radio and a song started to play. You love it when I take you to see the sea Don’t worry, relying on is love. Your happiness is the boat, I am the sea I will send you to the future …… The radio was playing Lu Yi’s “take you to see the sea.” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. Wasn’t this too appropriate? The two of them drove to watch the sea. Coincidentally, this song was playing on the radio, and the lyrics were so explicit. Ling Qingxue’s face also turned red. Then, she couldn’t help but burst out laughing. She turned to look at Xia ruofei with a red face. Xia ruofei said awkwardly,” “I ... I’ll change the channel!” “I don’t want to! This song is quite good! “I like it ...” Ling Qingxue said with a smile. “Alright then ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly. Under Lu Yi’s singing, neither of them spoke. Ling Qingxue’s face had a hint of shyness and seemed to have a hint of sweetness. Xia ruofei, on the other hand, sat upright and still, focusing on driving. The atmosphere in the car was really ambiguous. Fortunately, the journey was not far. A few minutes later, the pickup truck stopped by the side of the road. The beach was just in front of them, so they could only walk there. The two of them got out of the car, and Ling Qingxue ran towards the beach like a child, her leather boots kicking up clouds of sand. Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile when he saw this scene and quickly chased after him. Very quickly, the two of them arrived at the beach. Ling Qingxue was extremely excited. If it wasn’t winter, she might have already rushed into the water. The ocean breeze blew against Ling Qingxue’s face, causing her hair to flutter. Under the warm winter sun, her delicate face looked even more beautiful. The two of them walked along the coastline, and the sound of waves rang in their ears. In front of them was the boundless blue sea, which made them feel relaxed and happy. The two of them chatted as they walked. They talked about their past in junior high school. They were in the same grade but were in different classes, so they naturally had a lot of interactions and some common friends. For example, when Xia ruofei mentioned the literary performance in the first three periods, Ling Qingxue was very excited and said that she had a solo dance. She even asked Xia ruofei if he remembered the girl who had danced “Swan Lake”. Although Xia ruofei’s impression of him was vague, he was not stupid enough to tell the truth. Naturally, he nodded repeatedly. Ling Qingxue, on the other hand, was very familiar with some of Xia ruofei’s basketball games in middle school, as if the scenes of that time were still vivid in her mind. They talked as they walked, and the distance between the two seemed to have closed a lot. After walking for about half an hour, Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue was a little tired, so he said,” “Qingxue, there’s a rock over there. Let’s go and sit down! I’m taking a break. ” Ling Qingxue replied,” “Alright!” The rock was a little steep. Xia ruofei took the lead and jumped up easily after a few steps. His strong figure made Ling Qingxue’s eyes a little blurred. Xia ruofei turned around and extended her hand towards Ling Qingxue. She smiled and said,” “What are you thinking? Quickly come up!” Ling Qingxue came back to her senses and smiled sweetly as she reached out to grab Xia ruofei’s big hand. Xia ruofei felt that Ling Qingxue’s hands were very soft and smooth. He could not help but feel a little excited. After calming himself down, he gently pulled and pulled Ling Qingxue up. Then, Xia ruofei held Ling Qingxue’s hand and climbed up with her. The two of them sat down at the highest point of the reef. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue faced the vast sea. Below them was a cliff that was more than ten meters high. The cliff was grotesque and craggy. The waves hit the rocks, making loud sounds and splashing water. Even on the rocks that were more than ten meters high, one could feel the dense water vapor. In such an environment, one’s mood would suddenly become cheerful. The two of them sat there for a long time without speaking. After a long time, Ling Qingxue said softly,” “Ruofei, we talked about so much about the school just now. Now, tell me about your Army! I want to hear ...” “The Army ...” Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with reminiscence. After a long while, he said softly,”then let me tell you the story of a comrade! His name is Lin Hu, and he was born in a small fishing village not far from here. He and I were soldiers of the same year, and we were brought to the Army on the same train ...” Many things about the lone wolf commando team were confidential, but the fight with international drug dealers in China was not so sensitive. Central TV even sent reporters to interview the team and broadcast a documentary, but it was only after the military security Department removed the secret. That was why Xia ruofei was describing the battle that had left a deep impression on him. The warm winter sun was a little dazzling. Xia ruofei looked at the sea in front of him and told the tragic story in a very low voice. In a trance, he felt as if he had returned to the wet jungle where poisonous snakes and insects were everywhere ... The crisp sound of gunfire broke the silence of the jungle. The lone wolf Special Forces and the international drug trafficking gang were engaged in close combat, and bullets flew past them ... “Blood Wolf! Be careful of the sniper!” Xia ruofei had just heard his comrade – in – arms, Hu Zi’s roar when he was pushed away by a strong force. He rolled a few times involuntarily and hid behind a rock. Xia ruofei snapped back to reality and turned around. He saw that Hu Zi, who had pushed him away earlier, was lying on the ground. The large caliber sniper bullet had pierced through his thigh and blood was gushing out like a fountain. “Hu Zi!” Xia ruofei shouted in grief and anger, and was about to rush forward to bandage Hu Zi. “Don’t come over! The enemy’s sniper is watching us!” Hu Zi shouted. At the same time, a pair of big hands held Xia ruofei tightly in place. It was the commander Guo Zhan who was commanding the battle at the side. “Wolf King!” Xia ruofei’s eyes were bloodshot as he shouted,”the Wolf’s artery is injured. It’ll die if it’s not treated in time!” As a Special Forces elite, Xia ruofei naturally knew that this was the most commonly used method of snipers,”surround the point and hit the reinforcements.” They kept the wounded alive and waited for their comrades to rush up and treat them. Then, they would use the sniper rifle to “take down” them one by one. However, the person lying on the ground was his best brother and comrade. Xia ruofei had lost his usual calmness. Without waiting for Guo Zhan to speak, Hu Zi, who had already lost a little too much blood, said weakly,” “Bloody Wolf ... Ruofei ... Don’t come over ... Don’t come over ... You coming over ... Is meaningless ... Except to die ... Listen to me ... Don’t come over!” Xia ruofei clutched the grass on the ground tightly, his eyes bloodshot. Hu Zi was bleeding non – stop, and the sound was getting weaker and weaker. Finally, the enemy sniper lost his patience and another sniper bullet hit Hu Zi’s chest. He groaned and blood flowed from the corner of his mouth. “RUO ... Ruofei ... Help me ... Take care of my mother ... And my ... Sister ...” Hu Zi used the last of his strength and turned to look at Xia ruofei as he spoke with difficulty. A man’s tears would not fall easily, but they had not reached a sad point. At this moment, Xia ruofei’s tears were rolling down his cheeks. He said in a hoarse voice,” “Hu Zi! In the future ... Your mother is my mother!” When Hu Zi heard this, a gratified smile appeared at the corners of his lips, and he slowly closed his eyes. “Hu Zi ...” Xia ruofei wailed. …… The sea breeze blew and Xia ruofei felt a chill on his face. As he spoke, two lines of tears had unknowingly flowed down his face. Ling Qingxue was already leaning on him, her soft hands holding his big hands tightly, as if she wanted to give him strength ...
