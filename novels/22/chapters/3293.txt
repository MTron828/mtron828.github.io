Xia ruofei went around the tree and saw a clear Eight Trigrams pattern. However, it was currently in a dim state.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang also walked over and said with a smile,”Scholar Xia, I’ve already restrained those puppets. They won’t come within a three Zhang radius of this place, so you can talk to me in peace. Otherwise, the puppets would’ve already come.”

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to scan and found that it was indeed the case. There was even a puppet that had already walked very close to him, but it turned around and left as if it had hit a wall. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Thank you, Daoist priest.” Xia ruofei said,”but what’s your intention in saying this to me?”

Old Daoist Zhen Yang laughed and said,”Master Xia is an interesting person. I saw that master Xia didn’t seem to believe my words, so I went through a lot of trouble to find this passage to verify it. I don’t want to see master Xia waste any more time, so I decided to show myself and explain myself. I hope that master Xia will be able to show his true abilities and kill the puppets as soon as possible to enter the second level of the trial Pagoda. I don’t mind telling you that the record for clearing the first level of the Tower of Trials was two hours, and you’ve already wasted a quarter of an hour. If you want to break the record, you’ll have to do your best!”

Xia ruofei’s expression froze and he quickly asked,””May I ask if there are any other people who have entered the pagoda to train today? Are they in danger?”

Taoist Zhen Yang’s words had revealed an important piece of information. There had been more than one person who had passed the puppet trial of the tower of Trials and reached the second level. The fastest person had taken two hours, which was two hours to pass. Hence, Xia ruofei immediately thought of the other members of the expedition team, especially Ling Qingxue.

“Scholar Xia, what you need to do now is to complete your own trial. Everyone has their own path to walk. You can’t influence others” path, and you can’t help everyone ...”Old Daoist Zhen Yang said with a smile.

“Daoist priest, I have a very important friend who entered this secret realm with me, but we were separated. I’m really worried about her safety. If Daoist priest knows about the situation, please let me know!” Xia ruofei said urgently.

Everyone had entered at about the same time, but Xia ruofei did not meet any of the explorers in the secret realm. If everyone had been led into the Tower of Trials by an invisible force, there might be more than one Tower of Trials. It was very likely that this old Taoist Zhen Yang knew about the situation of the others.

Xia ruofei was even doubting his previous judgment. The more he looked at Taoist Zhen Yang, the more he didn’t look like a puppet. He was a real human, and an expert whose cultivation level he couldn’t see through at all.

However, Xia ruofei could still feel that there was something different about old Taoist Zhen Yang from a real human.

However, now was not the time to think about these things. What Xia ruofei wanted to know was Ling Qingxue’s situation.

Old Daoist Zhen Yang looked at Xia ruofei and hesitated for a moment before saying,””Layman Xia, according to the rules, I can’t tell you any information. However, seeing how much you care about your Dao – companion, I’ll tell you a little! That little girl is safe for now. That’s all I can say. Don’t ask anymore ...”

Xia ruofei was overjoyed and quickly said,””Thank you, Taoist priest! Thank you, Daoist priest!”

Old Daoist Zhen Yang waved his hand and said,”Scholar Xia, you’d better think of a way to pass the puppet trial as soon as possible! This poor Daoist will take his leave!”

After he finished speaking, old Taoist Zhen Yang cupped his hands towards Xia ruofei and his figure disappeared from where he was. When he reappeared, he was already at the entrance of true yang temple, as if he had teleported.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue. With his strength, he could barely see that old Daoist Zhen Yang didn’t teleport, but his speed was so fast that he had already moved dozens of meters away when his afterimage had just disappeared.

But even if it wasn’t teleportation, it was already terrifying enough to be this fast.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but think,”what is the cultivation level of this Taoist Zhen Yang?”

However, he didn’t have much time to think about it. After Taoist Zhen Yang left, there was no longer any restriction on the puppets. Soon, one of the puppets found the area where Xia ruofei was.

Xia ruofei scanned with his spiritual power and found that it was the itinerant peddler who had attacked him first in the central area of the mini town. At this time, the peddler was carrying an iron pole and walking towards Xia ruofei.

If it was just now, Xia ruofei would have entered the spirit map space. Now that he had understood the situation, he could no longer hide. It was meaningless to continue hiding. He would only be trapped in the first level and never be able to enter the second level.

Furthermore, from what old Daoist Zhen Yang had just said, it seemed that the faster one entered the second floor, the more benefits one would obtain. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be a record.

The fastest person to enter the second level took two hours.

In other words, within two hours, this person had killed 100 puppets that were at the same or even higher cultivation level as him and found the entrance to the second level.

If Xia ruofei wanted to break this record, he had to end the battle quickly.

He had an advantage, and that was the perceptual mirror, so he didn’t need to spend time looking for the entrance to the second floor. After completing the killing mission, he could go straight to the big tree, which would save him a lot of time.
