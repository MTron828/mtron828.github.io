“Yup! I just got home!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“How do you feel?” Hou Liang chuckled and asked,”the festival Group didn’t let you suffer, right? If there’s anything they haven’t done enough, just tell me directly! I’ll get station head Gao to give them a good scolding!”

“Monkey, I’m not that precious!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s just a show. The entire journey had been delivered by car, and they had been served with good food and drinks! What grievances could she have suffered! It’s not easy for her to record a program, so don’t make things more difficult for her!”

“Hehe! I’m just afraid that they’ll be rude to brother Xia. ” Said Hou Liang with a dry laugh.

After some small talk, Xia ruofei got straight to the point and asked,””Monkey, do you have any plans tonight? Accompany me to have a meal!”

“Brother Xia, you’ve spoken. Even if there’s a big matter, I have to put it aside first!” “Brother Xia,” Hou Liang said without any hesitation.”Brother Xia, where do we meet tonight?” What time? I promise I’ll be there on time!”

“It’s director Gao from xiangnan satellite TV,”Xia ruofei said with a smile,” he wanted to treat me to a meal to express his gratitude. They’ve given me a lot of face this time, so I can’t really reject this kind of social event. But after thinking about it, I’m not familiar with the people and things in the SARFT circle. There wasn’t much to talk about in the past, so after some consideration, I decided to invite you along. Just treat it as having a meal with me!”

“No problem!” Hou Liang said,”this Gao Jun is quite sensible! I won’t hold it against him for asking for so many of your products for free this time ...”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”you’re still thinking about that stupid thing!” I don’t even mind, so why are you following me? I’m telling you, don’t mention this at dinner tonight! After all, he was the son of a high – ranking official, and he was about to become a shareholder of the Paradise Association. How could he be so petty? You’ve embarrassed us for no reason ...”

“I know, brother Xia ...” Hou Liang chuckled.

Xia ruofei’s words made Hou Liang feel a little smug. Before he got on Xia ruofei’s good side, Hou Liang could barely be considered as song Rui’s Lackey. It was because he spared no effort to be on good terms with Xia ruofei that he was now truly accepted by the circle. Most importantly, the Paradise gathering that Xia ruofei and the rest had set up would definitely have a bright future. Putting aside the economic benefits, the various connections that this gathering would bring were extremely valuable resources. It was all thanks to Xia ruofei that he was able to have a share in this business.

Therefore, Hou Liang was completely loyal to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei said,” 6:30 in the evening, in the private ya Qing private room of the Wang family’s residence. Don’t play the big – Name game!” I’ll be there on time. You can’t expect me to wait for you there, right?”

“Brother! I wouldn’t dare to!” Hou Liang quickly said,”don’t worry! I’ll definitely go there in advance!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I’ll see you tonight!”

“See you tonight!”

……

After hanging up the phone, Xia ruofei took out a cigarette and lit it up. He puffed out a cloud of smoke.

He was still smoking the brand – less internally – supplied cigarette that elder song had given him. In fact, after his cultivation, the impurities in Xia ruofei’s body had been expelled, and the smoking addiction he had gotten from the Army had magically disappeared. So, he did not feel anything even though he had not smoked for many days. Only when he was bored or thinking about a problem would he unconsciously take out a cigarette and light it up.

Of course, with Xia ruofei’s current cultivation, the tar and nicotine in the cigarette would not cause any harm to his body. Forget about cigarettes, even if he injected himself with drugs, it would be difficult for him to get addicted.

As long as it was a harmful substance, it would be destroyed by the true energy after entering the body, forming impurities and being expelled.

Xia ruofei stubbed out his cigarette on the ashtray when he was halfway done.

He thought of the car purchase that he had mentioned to song Rui two days ago. He wondered how the guy was doing.

Xia ruofei took out his phone and called song Rui.

“Ruofei, have you finished recording the show?” Song Rui asked as soon as he picked up the phone.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but want to laugh at song Rui’s words. They were exactly the same as the first sentence Hou Liang had said when he picked up the phone.

“I just got home.” Xia ruofei asked,”what are you busy with?”

“I’m busy! It’s all about the club, there’s a thousand things to do!” Song Rui complained out of habit.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the capable do more work!” Besides, you’re a shareholder of the Paradise Association, so it’s your own business, how can you not be concerned about it?”

“You’re a major shareholder!” Song Rui said indignantly,”why have I never seen you care about the club?”

“Although I’m a major shareholder, the club business has the smallest investment out of all my businesses. Besides, I’m so busy every day, so it’s natural that I can’t take care of such a small business. Please understand ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Rui suddenly felt 10000 points of critical damage and couldn’t help but complain,””F * ck you ... This is such a big blow ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Alright, I’m not going to bicker with you! I’m looking for you to ask you about the matter I mentioned last time. How’s it going?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What is it?” Song Rui asked subconsciously.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but say,”did you forget?” The matter of buying a car! What the ... Why do I feel like you’re a little unreliable!”

Only then did song Rui come to a realization and quickly said,””You’re talking about this! How could he forget? I was busy at the club and didn’t think of it. ”

“Why do I not believe it? Forget it, just tell me, how did it go?” Xia ruofei asked.

“No problem!” Song Rui said,”I really couldn’t react in time just now. I was going to call you to tell you about this, but I was worried that it would affect you since you were recording the show!”

He paused for a moment, then continued,”I’ve already spoken to Li Xiao si ‘er, there’s no problem!” It’s just that he doesn’t have any cars on hand right now. ”

“How long do I have to wait?” Xia ruofei asked.

If the waiting time was too long, he might as well go and bid for one directly. After all, hundreds of thousands of Yuan was really nothing to him.

“If someone else wanted it, they would have to wait at least a month! This is already considered fast. After all, this car is in high demand. ” Song Rui said smugly,”but I asked for it myself. Li Xiaosi immediately went to coordinate it when he heard that you wanted it ...”

Xia ruofei was speechless and said,””You brat, you bragged for half a day, but you’d better be accurate! How long do you need?”

Song Rui laughed dryly and said,”three days!” It would not take more than five days! Li Xiao si ‘er already has a batch of cars on the sea, and if everything goes smoothly, they’ll arrive at Jing – Jin port in three days. There are a few Alphard models among them, but they were all pre – ordered by others, so he forcibly detained one for you. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I didn’t expect you to have such a big face!” Would he offend someone because of this? If it really doesn’t work out, I don’t mind waiting for a few more days ...”

Anyone who could order a car from li Xiaosi was definitely not an ordinary family. If li Xiaosi offended someone because he reserved a car for himself, Xia ruofei would definitely feel bad.

“I’m fine!” Song Rui said casually,”that car was ordered by one of his childhood friends. He just had to say so. It doesn’t matter if he gives it to me later.”

Then, song Rui smiled and said,”ruofei, I’m not the only one who’s influential. When li Xiaosi heard that you wanted to order a car, he agreed without thinking. He said that he had heard about you for a long time and wanted to be friends with you!” This is also because of your face!”

“Nonsense! What kind of fame do I have?” Xia ruofei said nonchalantly,”I’m different from you young masters who were born with a silver spoon in your mouth!”

“Look at you, you’re so self – deprecating!” Song Rui said proudly,”although you’re not in this circle, you’re quite well – known in the circle. Which wastrel doesn’t know you, President Xia?”

Xia ruofei laughed,”so I’m A Celebrity now?”

“Don’t count me as one! It has to be!” Song Rui asked,”by the way, are you free tonight? Li Xiao si ‘er has been begging me to introduce you two to each other! If you’re free, why don’t you come out for a meal?”
