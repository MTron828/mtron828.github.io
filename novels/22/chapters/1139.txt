“Xia Sheng, I can’t wait to see that King’s Green square card!” MA Xiong said with a smile as soon as he entered the room.

Initially, Xia ruofei wanted to ask Ma Zhiming about his health condition. However, seeing how impatient MA Xiong was and how there were so many people around, it was not convenient for him to ask about private matters.

“No problem,” he said with a smile.”Please wait a moment!”

With that, Xia ruofei pushed the door open and entered the bedroom. There was a small safe on the wall facing the bedroom door. This was the standard equipment of a five – Star hotel.

Xia ruofei opened the safe and reached in with his back to everyone.

In reality, he had used his body to block everyone’s line of sight and took out the king’s Green square card from a small paper box in the spirit map space.

Even though he had only gone downstairs for a short while, Xia ruofei was still very cautious as he kept the Imperial Green square card in his storage space. After all, it was a treasure worth one to two hundred million.

When Xia ruofei walked out of the bedroom with the paper box, he caught a glimpse of Liang Chongshan’s disapproving look.

Xia ruofei smiled and placed the paper box on the coffee table in the living room. He smiled and said,””Mr. MA, the king’s Green square card is in this box.”

This was the rule that Zhao Yongjun had explained to Xia ruofei at the last minute. Otherwise, Xia ruofei really didn’t know that he couldn’t just hand things over to the other party.

MA Xiong couldn’t wait any longer. He chuckled and said,”Alright, alright ...”

Just as MA Xiong extended his hand, Liang Chongshan beat him to it and said,””Chairman MA, please wait a moment. Let me take a look first!”

If it was an ordinary person, who would dare to be so presumptuous in front of MA Xiong? However, Liang Chongshan was one of the founding members of Hengfeng group. He even had a small number of company shares given to him by MA Xiong. He had a good personal relationship with MA Xiong. He dared to do things that others dared not do.

MA Xiong’s smile froze, but he still nodded and said, “That’s good. Liang is an expert in Jade. You can take a look first!”

Liang Chongshan nodded and looked at Xia ruofei. He said indifferently,””Mr. Xia, I will expose this scam!”

Xia ruofei frowned and said,””Mr. Liang, I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to make such arbitrary conclusions without any evidence!”

Even a clay Buddha was a little angry. No matter how good Liang Zhongshan’s relationship with MA Xiong was, it had nothing to do with Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei was quite polite to Liang Zhongshan at first, but when he saw his attitude, Xia ruofei naturally did not show him any good attitude.

Liang Chongshan laughed coldly and said,””Arbitrary? I’ve been in this line of work for decades, and I still have the most basic judgment. As the saying goes, going too far is as bad as not going too far. Your photos are too perfect ...” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He didn’t even make any changes to the photos. He just took them out from the SD card and sent them to MA Xiong.

However, Liang Chongshan was certain that he had made a lot of changes to the photos, because the king’s Green cards in the photos were too perfect.

He didn’t know what kind of logic this was.

Liang Chongshan was MA Xiong’s subordinate after all, and Xia ruofei did not want to completely fall out with him. Hence, he shrugged and said,””Then feel free to take a look!”

Xia ruofei stepped aside.

Xia ruofei did not argue with Liang Chongshan, but Zhao Yongjun could not stand it anymore.

Zhao Yongjun respected MA Xiong, but that didn’t mean he would be polite to Liang Chongshan. Young master Zhao was also a well – known rich man in the circle. How could he take it when Liang Chongshan, this old man, kept doubting his brother Xia ruofei?

Seeing that Xia ruofei didn’t say anything, Zhao Yongjun sneered,””Since you don’t trust RUO Fei, why did you come all the way from Hong Kong to Beijing?”

Liang Chongshan snorted and said arrogantly,””You think I wanted to come? Our Chairman insisted on coming. I’m just worried that he’ll be deceived!”

Didn’t this clearly mean that MA Xiong had a low IQ and was easily deceived? No one else had such emotional intelligence.

If it was any other company leader, they would definitely have a grudge against Liang Chongshan. However, MA Xiong only shook his head with a bitter smile.

MA Xiong quickly explained,”Xia Sheng, Mr. Zhao, please don’t mind him. Old Liang is like that. He’s a straightforward person. I actually trust RUO Fei completely. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have rushed here from Hong Kong immediately!”

Zhao Yongjun secretly pouted, then said indifferently,””Mr. MA, to be honest, I have a lot of friends in the antique circle in the capital. I’m also familiar with a few big auction houses. I’ve always suggested that we fly away to the auction channels. Not only can we earn more, but we can also avoid being suspected for no reason.”

Then, Zhao Yongjun glanced at Liang Chongshan unhappily.

“Young master Zhao, please understand ...” MA Xiong said with a bitter smile.

Liang Chongshan, however, pouted and said,””As long as the appraisers of the auction houses have the most basic professional judgment, they would not accept such a ridiculous item!”

MA Xiong finally couldn’t take it anymore. He frowned and said,”Old Liang! If you keep talking like this, you’ll go back to Hong Kong immediately! We don’t need you here anymore ...”

Liang Chongshan immediately shut his mouth. Although he had a bad temper, he was very loyal to MA Xiong and the Hengfeng group. He was afraid that MA Xiong would send him back to Hong Kong in a fit of anger.
