Xia ruofei smelled a very special fragrance. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He took one look at Ling Qingxue’s expression and knew that she must have smelled the same thing.

The reason for the change in their expressions was that they were both wearing spacesuits that were well – sealed and were using oxygen supply modules to breathe, completely isolated from the outside world. It could be said that this system could ensure complete isolation from the outside world even in space.

Under such circumstances, how could he possibly smell anything?

On top of that, Xia ruofei had to use the bulky spacesuit because the mist was highly toxic. Even though the yuan Qi protective cover could isolate the mist, he still had to use the spacesuit to prevent any mist from leaking in. There was another possibility. If the Yuanqi protective shield had a problem, the EVA suit, which had a certain degree of corrosion resistance and was well – sealed, could protect the spacesuit for a certain period of time. With this short reaction time, Xia ruofei could make a self – Rescue plan. At the very least, he could use the spirit map.

But if it couldn’t even isolate the smell, then what was the point of wearing such a heavy EVA suit?

Xia ruofei was very confused and did not know what went wrong.

However, he still held his breath at once and made a hand gesture to Ling Qingxue, telling her to hold her breath immediately.

Cultivators could breathe internally. Even if Ling Qingxue’s cultivation was average, she could at least hold on for half an hour.

The safety of this strange fragrance was completely unknown. Of course, Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down.

However, what surprised the two of them was that even though they held their breaths, they could still smell the fragrance.

Xia ruofei’s expression turned serious. He could feel that the fragrance was very alluring. It was not something that he could smell through his nose. It was as if it had seeped into his soul. The seal of the spacesuit and holding his breath could not isolate the fragrance.

Ling Qingxue also noticed this problem. Her expression changed slightly and she cast a questioning look at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””Qingxue, just breathe normally! This has nothing to do with the spacesuits ‘sealability, so there’s no point in us holding our breath.”

Ling Qingxue let out a breath of air, then said worriedly,””Ruofei, why do 1 feel that this fragrance is strange? It suddenly appeared, and it seemed to have a very, very special attraction that made people want to get close to it…”

After Xia ruofei heard Ling Qingxue’s words, he suddenly had an idea.

“Perhaps… This fragrance is really a kind of guidance?” he muttered to himself.

“What?” Ling Qingxue asked in confusion.

“I mean, maybe this fragrance is really to guide us there?” Xia ruofei said,”the cloud and mist area below the cliff is so big that we don’t even know where the golden thread nether snake is. If we search slowly, we won’t be able to find it even if we spend ten times the time. There must be some clues. This special scent might be one of them!”

“But 1 feel that this fragrance is too strange …” Ling Qingxue frowned.

Xia ruofei said,”I’ve checked just now. My body is not affected by this fragrance. 1 also feel that it’s not a kind of smell. It’s directly affecting my soul… In short, there’s no bad reaction so far.” And you? Do you feel uncomfortable?”

“Now that you’ve mentioned it, I don’t seem to have done anything wrong!” Ling Qingxue said,”but it could also be a slow – acting poison. Who knows, the effects might appear over time?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”let’s not think too much!” In my opinion, this is better than nothing. The appearance of a variable might be a turning point? Since we don’t have any problems now, let’s continue. We’ll follow this fragrance and search, maybe there wall be a surprise!”

The reason why Xia ruofei dared to take this risk was that the spirit map space had given him a certain amount of confidence. Even if there was really something wrong with the fragrance, he still had the spirit Heart Flower petals. The spirit Heart Flower petals would be able to take effect on most of the negative states.

Of course, the most important thing was that when he used his spiritual power to look inside his body, he didn’t find any problems. In other words, this fragrance didn’t cause any damage to his body for the time being.

“Alright then!” Ling Qingxue nodded and said,”I support your decision!”

It was strange. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue clearly did not smell the fragrance through their noses, but they could accurately determine the source of the fragrance.

Moreover, the two of them had come to the same conclusion. The source of the fragrance came from the bottom left corner of their current position. As for how far it was, they had no idea.

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue first moved more than 20 meters to the left. At that moment, they could clearly feel that the source of the fragrance was right below them.

Thus, the two of them began to climb up the protruding part of the cliff wall and went down bit by bit.

Outside the protective shield, white mist was rising. However, as soon as it touched the protective shield, it dispersed. The area within a two – meter radius of Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue was a refreshing space. It was as if they were carrying a balloon, and the two of them were slowly moving down while hiding inside the balloon.

The slope of the cliff was not as steep as when they first came down, but it was still 6o to 70 degrees. Fortunately, both of them were cultivators, and there were many protrusions on the cliff, so they could basically climb down steadily..
