Chapter 3408: Meeting on a narrow path (2)

Translator: 549690339

Just as Xia ruofei had said, he could not perform any major surgery on the array. It was just some minor adjustments.

As a result, the main body of the formation patterns did not change much. He only made small adjustments to the formation patterns according to his own understanding.

In the eyes of layman Yuntai, this was like a fairy tale.

Xia ruofei had a deep understanding of the laws of space. It was because of this that he was able to find a few flaws in the array that could reduce its power. Now, he was following his own understanding and re – carving these talismans. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei spent about 40 minutes to make six new array talismans.

Then, he used his mind power to check and confirmed that the goldthread nether snake was not able to catch up for the time being. Based on the situation just now, the goldthread nether snake would need at least five to six seconds to catch up to the spirit map. In the primordial realm time formation in the spirit map, it would have about two to three hours. There was still some distance between the goldthread nether snake and the spirit map, so it was safe for the time being.

Hence, Xia ruofei set up the nine turn space splitting formation in the time formation.

Of course, this nine turn space splitting formation was the formation that he had prepared earlier. He did not use the array talismans that he had just improved.

In other words, Xia ruofei had first set up a standard nine – turn space splitting formation.

Scholar Yuntai had already seen Xia ruofei set up a formation so casually, but he still found it hard to believe when he saw it again.

When he thought about how Xia ruofei wanted to improve on the foundation of this formation, he felt that it was even more like a fantasy.

Xia ruofei sensed the operation of the formation and broke it apart.

Then, he accurately picked out the six array talismans and placed the six array talismans that he had just made inside.

Then, he skillfully set up the nine turn space splitting array again. This time, he modified the array according to his ideas.

Layman Yuntai was also staring at this new formation, and he couldn’t help but release his mental energy to sense it.

Xia ruofei was doing the same thing.

Both of them felt at the same time that after the six array talismans were replaced, the operation of the array not only did not improve, but some nodes appeared to be blocked.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but frown, while scholar Yuntai secretly heaved a sigh of relief and thought,”! knew it wasn’t that easy to improve the formation! Especially in such a short period of time, how could he really improve a mature array to a better level?

In the eyes of master Yuntai, there was a limit to geniuses. If Xia ruofei could really improve the array in such a short time, then he was beyond the scope of genius.

But Xia ruofei did not give up. He muttered to himself and reached out to draw two blank Jade talismans. Then, he thought for a moment and started to draw quickly with his fingers.

Streams of mental energy flowed out smoothly from his fingertips, leaving profound formation patterns on the blank jade talisman.

This time, layman Yuntai couldn’t understand it at all.

This was because the runes that Xia ruofei had drawn were different from the runes on any of the nine turn space splitting array runes.

Xia ruofei was carving a new array pattern!

Scholar Yuntai was a little confused. Could it be that he’s planning to give up on the nine turn space splitting formation and set up a new formation that I’ve never seen before? But there wasn’t enough time! Moreover, the power of the nine turn space splitting formation itself was not bad. There was still a chance of killing the goldthread nether snake. Why would he give up what was near and seek what was far?

Fortunately, Xia ruofei did not take too long to inscribe the two Jade talismans this time. In about ten minutes, he had successfully inscribed two talismans.

Xia ruofei checked the array pattern on the Jade talisman and silently deduced it. Then, he nodded in satisfaction.

Then, Xia ruofei stretched out his hand and gently touched the array. He broke up the array that was not working well because of the improvement.

Then, he immediately pushed his hands and added the two array talismans in. Then, his hands gently drew in the air, and the array materials began to rearrange under the effect of his mental power.

In just a few seconds, a new formation was formed.

Scholar Yuntai was stunned. The nine turn space splitting formation was still in front of him. At least the main structure of the formation had not changed, but at least eight array talismans had been adjusted. In addition, two of Xia ruofei’s newly made array talismans had been added.

“This is …” Scholar Yuntai couldn’t help but Mutter to himself.

Xia ruofei flicked his finger and activated the formation. Then, he immediately released his spiritual power to sense it.

Scholar Yuntai also came back to his senses and quickly used his mental energy to check the array.

After a quick probe, layman Yuntai couldn’t help but cry out,'”‘This formation is so stable!”

With his experience and shrewdness, layman Yuntai should have been able to remain calm and composed, but he had lost his composure several times today.

Especially this time, he was extremely shocked.

Xia ruofei had replaced six runes, changed the positions of eight runes, and added two runes. In the end, he was still able to set up the nine turn space splitting array and the stability of the array had been greatly improved.

At first, master Yuntai thought that Xia ruofei’s random addition of talismans would cause the formation to collapse and it would be impossible to form a stable energy channel.

However, reality had taught scholar Yuntai a good lesson. Xia ruofei’s formation was obviously still the nine – turn space splitting formation. It was much more stable than the original formation, and the obstruction that had appeared earlier had disappeared.

There’s actually such an operation? At this time, scholar Yuntai felt that his long cultivation life had been wasted. He couldn’t even compare to a little kid in the early jiedan stage.

Xia ruofei examined it more carefully. His understanding of this formation was obviously much higher than that of Yuntai scholar. Therefore, he was not only concerned about the stability of the formation, but also the increase in power.

Xia ruofei tried to operate the formation and tested the attacking function of the formation.

This time, his heart was completely at ease.

“It seems like the effect of the modification is not bad. The power has increased by at least 30%!” Xia ruofei said happily,”senior Yuntai, do you think the probability of winning will increase a lot if we use this formation to deal with the goldthread nether snake?”

Only then did scholar Yuntai come back to his senses. He smiled bitterly and said,””Actually, with fellow Daoist Xia’s abilities, even a standard nine – turn space splitting formation would be a huge threat to the goldthread nether snake. Now that it’s been improved and its performance has been increased by thirty percent, this formation is no weaker than some classic space formations! Fellow Daoist Xia is really…”

“I’m only familiar with the rules of space,” Xia ruofei said humbly.”! don’t dare to change other formations like this.”

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to check the situation outside. After confirming that the goldthread nether snake was still some distance away from him, he decided to keep the improved nine revolutions void splitting formation in operation. He wanted to continue observing the improved nine revolutions void splitting formation. It had not been tested and verified yet, so Xia ruofei did not know if the formation would be able to maintain its current stable state.

The formation ran for more than half an hour before Xia ruofei stopped and broke it apart. Then, he let it stay suspended in the air.

“Senior Yuntai, this junior is ready to go out!” Xia ruofei said,”this time, there should be enough time for me to set up the array!”

“Yes!” Replied layman Yuntai. Fellow Daoist Xia, when we meet on a narrow road, the braver one will win. There’s nothing to be afraid of about the goldthread nether snake. You must first overwhelm the other party with your momentum!”

“Understood!” Xia ruofei said,”please help me, senior Yuntai. If I make any mistakes, please remind me.”

“Alright!” Layman Yuntai said straightforwardly.

With a thought, Xia ruofei left the spirit map space in a flash..
