Translator: 549690339

After breakfast, Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao walked Xia ruofei to the door and handed him the gift they had prepared. Then, they tidied his clothes and said kindly,””Ruofei, when you’re with your in – laws, you have to be more sweet with your words. Try to marry Qingxue this year!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, but he still nodded his head and agreed.

When they arrived at Ling Xiaotian’s house, they naturally had a good time drinking and chatting. They even had two consecutive meals until 10 O’ clock in the evening.

The drunk Ling Xiaotian had not forgotten that he wanted Xia ruofei to stay at his house.

Naturally, Xia ruofei was more than happy to do so. Ling Qingxue’s face was as red as a ripe apple. She helped her father back to his room to rest, then rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and led him to the guest room that had been prepared for him.

How could Xia ruofei miss such a God – given opportunity?

The Ling family’s nanny had also gone back for the new year. Only Ling Xiaotian, his daughter, and Xia ruofei were left in the huge villa. Now that Ling Xiaotian had been easily drunk by Xia ruofei and had fallen into a deep sleep, how could Xia ruofei still control his own flame?

At the door of the guest room, Xia ruofei hugged Ling Qingxue, whose face was as red as fire, and kissed her deeply.

Ling Qingxue didn’t even try to resist. She started to respond to Xia ruofei enthusiastically.

Xia ruofei even boldly picked Ling Qingxue up by her waist and walked out of the room, heading straight for her boudoir.

Ling Qingxue was both shy and nervous. She let out a soft sigh and closed her eyes tightly.

Although she knew that Ling Xiaotian was already in a deep sleep, she couldn’t help but feel embarrassed when she thought of her father in the bedroom not far away.

Xia ruofei carried Ling Qingxue to her room and placed her on the bed.

“The door isn’t closed ...” Ling Qingxue weakly said.

“Don’t worry! “Even if there’s Thunder outside, uncle Ling won’t be able to hear it ...” Xia ruofei laughed evilly as he lowered his body.

Ling Qingxue chuckled as she struggled to stand up. She staggered to the door and locked it from the inside.

Before she could turn around, she felt a hot body hug her tightly from behind, and she instantly felt her whole body go soft.

The song of a Phoenix and a Luan rang out in the warm boudoir of a young girl ...

After a long time, the wind and rain stopped. Ling Qingxue curled up lazily in Xia ruofei’s arms, the flush on her face still not completely gone.

“You bad guy, you must have made my dad drunk on purpose, right?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Hehe! Uncle Ling is in such high spirits, how can I ruin his mood?” Xia ruofei would never admit it.

“You’re not allowed to drink like this next time!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”my dad is old. Drinking is bad for his health!”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei said in a relaxed manner,”uncle Ling’s body is fine. I’ll help him recuperate tomorrow. He’ll definitely be full of energy!”

“Really?”

“Don’t forget what your husband does for a living!” Xia ruofei said,”I say, wife, how dare you question your husband’s ability! Looks like I’ll need to be punished ...”

Xia ruofei’s hands started to move restlessly after he finished speaking.

Ling Qingxue shrieked in shock and laughed coyly as she shrank into the blanket. However, Xia ruofei had not been intimate with Ling Qingxue for a long time and was still full of energy! How could he let Ling Qingxue escape?

He chuckled and snuggled under the covers. Soon, a blushing and heart – Racing sound began to echo in the bedroom again ...

The next morning.

Ling Qingxue woke up from her sweet dream and opened her eyes lazily.

Thinking of the crazy night they had last night, her beautiful face couldn’t help but blush.

However, when she noticed the sunlight coming in through the gap in the curtain, her remaining sleepiness disappeared at once. She sat up nervously in bed.

It was already bright outside, and he didn’t know if his father would wake up early. If he was caught red – handed by his father, it would be really awkward ...

After Ling Qingxue sat up, she suddenly realized that there was no one beside her. Xia ruofei had left without her knowing.

Ling Qingxue’s face revealed a trace of amusement. She reached out to touch the blanket that was still warm and muttered to herself,””This guy, I thought he was very bold ...”

Knowing that Xia ruofei had already escaped from the “crime scene”, Ling Qingxue was relieved. She got out of bed and put on her clothes.

Seeing her undergarments scattered all over the room, Ling Qingxue’s pretty face couldn’t help but burn again.

“You don’t even know how to help me pack up ...” Ling Qingxue muttered to herself as she walked over to pick up the clothes.

She imagined Xia ruofei sneakily getting up in the morning, quickly putting on his clothes, and then sneaking out like a thief to observe the situation before quickly sneaking away. She couldn’t help but laugh.

Girls usually took a longer time to clean up when they woke up early. It took Ling Qingxue more than half an hour to finish washing up. She opened the door and walked out.

Coincidentally, Ling Xiaotian seemed to have just woken up as well. He walked out of another bedroom not far away.

“Qingxue, you’re up!” Ling Xiaotian greeted with a yawn.

“Yup! Dad, you just woke up too?” Ling Qingxue looked at Ling Xiaotian’s slightly pale face and asked with concern,”you were so drunk last night. Are you feeling uncomfortable now?”

“It’s fine!”Ling Xiaotian laughed. He was just a little lacking in spirit! Our family’s wine will never get you drunk!”

Ling Xiaotian did not boast about himself. Other than the mellow and rich fragrance, the unique characteristic of the Drunken Eight Immortals wine was that it would not get to one’s head. No matter how drunk one was on the first day, one would not get a headache the next day. At most, one would be a little dispirited.

For example, this time, Ling Xiaotian would usually wake up about an hour ago and train for a while every morning. But today, he overslept.

After getting up, other than feeling a little tired, he didn’t have any other hangover symptoms, such as headaches.

“Oh right, where’s RUO Fei?” Ling Xiaotian asked.

Ling Qingxue’s face heated up slightly, and she said guiltily,””I don’t know! I just woke up ... He can’t be still sleeping, right?”

Ling Qingxue then glanced at the guest room with its tightly shut door.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s voice came from downstairs.””Uncle Ling, Qingxue, you’re up! Come down and have breakfast!”

Ling Qingxue and Ling Xiaotian looked down through the railing and saw Xia ruofei wearing an apron. He was holding two bowls of soup in his hands and the dining table was already filled with a sumptuous breakfast. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ling Xiaotian chuckled and said,”ruofei, how can I let you make breakfast for us?” You’re a guest ...”

“Uncle Ling, you’re treating me as an outsider, aren’t you?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I don’t think of myself as an outsider!”

Ling Xiaotian happily looked at his daughter and said,””Yes, yes, yes, we’re not outsiders to begin with!”

With that, Ling Xiaotian strode down the stairs.

Ling Qingxue’s lips curved into a mesmerizing smile. This guy’s mouth sure is sweet. He even knows how to please his future father – in – Law ...

The two of them went downstairs to the dining room. Xia ruofei pointed at the bowl of black medicinal soup on the table and said,””Uncle Ling, drink this bowl of hangover soup before you eat breakfast! This is something I specially made for you. ”

“Ruofei is so considerate!” Ling Xiaotian chuckled as he said that. He lifted his bowl and began to gulp down the soup.

“Qingxue, this bowl is yours!” Xia ruofei said,”this is a nourishing soup!”

At this point, Xia ruofei moved closer to Ling Qingxue’s ear and whispered,””It’s specially used to quickly replenish physical strength ...”

Ling Qingxue blushed and could not help but secretly glare at Xia ruofei. Then, she quickly looked at Ling Xiaotian.

At this moment, Ling Xiaotian had already finished drinking his hangover soup. He wiped his mouth, then looked at Ling Qingxue and asked,””Qingxue, why aren’t you drinking? RUO Fei worked so hard to get up so early to make soup, don’t let his good intentions down!”

“Oh!” Ling Qingxue responded and picked up the bowl of soup guiltily.

In fact, when she woke up this morning, she felt that her legs were weak. Yingying had been too crazy last night.

The amazing thing was that after drinking the soup that Xia ruofei had specially made, she felt a warm sensation in her stomach. Soon, this warmth seemed to spread to her limbs and bones. She really felt that her strength had recovered a lot. The effect was immediate.

Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei. Xia ruofei was winking at her, as if to say,”Praise me! Hurry up and praise me ...

Seeing Xia ruofei’s funny look, Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but burst out laughing. “Let’s eat, let’s eat!”
