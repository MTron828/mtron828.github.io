2207 Revealing everything (2)

Ling Qingxue nodded in agreement.

Xia ruofei continued.”Actually, the ‘Scripture of the primordium origin’ didn’t mention the method of combining the spirit and the body. The technique only mentioned that two people could greatly increase the efficiency of cultivation. The reason why I discovered that the method of combining the spirit and the body was the best way to cultivate the ‘Scripture of the primordium origin’ was because ...”

When Xia ruofei said this, he hesitated for a moment. On the other hand, Ling Qingxue was very calm. Although her face was a little pale, she still calmly took the initiative to ask,””This method ... Was discovered by you and Song Wei during your cultivation, right?”

Xia ruofei nodded, speechless.

“You guys have also undergone spirit body Fusion cultivation?” Ling Qingxue asked.

Her voice was still very calm, but her eyes were slightly red, and her face was unable to hide the aggrieved expression.

Xia ruofei nodded and sighed.””Qingxue, it was really an accident ... I was in the capital doing some work and Song Wei was also studying in the capital. We both wanted to get rid of the peach blossom miasma as soon as possible, so she would come to the courtyard house to cultivate with me whenever she was free, hoping to improve her cultivation as soon as possible ...”

Then, Xia ruofei told Ling Qingxue everything that had happened during the joint training.

Of course, he didn’t say that Song Wei insisted on taking the risk to try to get rid of the peach blossom miasma. Instead, he said that at that time, they felt that their cultivation had improved a lot. In order to prevent the peach blossom miasma from mutating in the sea of consciousness, they decided to try to get rid of it in the sea of consciousness.

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei looked into Ling Qingxue’s eyes and said,””Qingxue, I really didn’t expect something like this to happen ... To be honest, I don’t know much about the sea of consciousness. The situation was very critical at that time. The peach blossom miasma mutated on its own and started to devour each other, becoming stronger and stronger. If I didn’t make a quick decision, not only would Song Wei’s soul be destroyed, but I would also be severely injured. So I had no other choice but to take the risk and enter the core Island in Song Wei’s sea of consciousness. I didn’t expect ...”

After Ling Qingxue heard these words, she fell silent for a long time.

Xia ruofei also looked at Ling Qingxue quietly.

After a long time, Ling Qingxue asked,”so ... What do you think?” To the two of us ...”

Xia ruofei said,”Qingxue, you’ve also tried the soul – body Fusion cultivation. You should know that the contact at the soul level is really unforgettable.” I have to be honest with you, I...I...Can’t give up on Song Wei. What happened between us was an accident in the process of expelling the poison from her body. Even though we didn’t have any intimate contact in real life, our souls have already ...”

“You don’t need to say anything!” Ling Qingxue interrupted Xia ruofei with red eyes.”I don’t want to hear you say this! RUO Fei, I just want to know ... You and her ... Combined cultivation of spirit bodies, was it before or after you taught me how to cultivate?”

Xia ruofei was silent for a while, but he still said,””Before ...”

“If that’s the case, then why are you still teaching me cultivation?” Ling Qingxue became a little excited.”The feeling of spirit body joint cultivation is so wonderful. It’ll be great if you’re with her!” Why did you pull me in?”

Xia ruofei’s face was filled with guilt. He said,””Qingxue, it was Song Wei who told me to do this. She hoped that you would understand and forgive her. However, if you are not a true cultivator, you will not be able to understand the concept of spirit body Fusion cultivation. You might even think that it is a fantasy.”

Ling Qingxue revealed a self – deprecating smile and asked,””So you want me to experience that feeling for myself? Just to make me understand you?”

“Of course not!” Xia ruofei immediately said sincerely,”Qingxue, of course I want you to cultivate with me! Cultivators have long lifespans. Of course, I don’t want you to leave me after a few decades, while I have to live alone in this world for a few hundred years, or even longer ...”

“Don’t you already have Song Wei?” Ling Qingxue’s face had a trace of resentment.”You guys are the real couple. I’m not even necessary!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei said anxiously,”Qingxue, what are you talking about?” You will forever be irreplaceable in my heart! Two stalks of heart – concentrating grass were enough to improve the talent of two cultivators by a large margin, but I used it on you without hesitation. I had also made up my mind at that time that if you still couldn’t step into the cultivation threshold, I would get a third stalk of heart – concentrating grass for you to consume no matter how big the price was ...”

When Ling Qingxue heard Xia ruofei’s words, the scene of Xia ruofei serving her the medicinal soup appeared in her mind again. At that time, she naturally didn’t know how precious the medicinal soup was. Now that she thought about it, those scenes made her heart warm again.

However, Ling Qingxue’s thoughts turned to Song Wei. She even imagined the scene of the two of them cultivating together. She couldn’t help but feel aggrieved.

Ling Qingxue’s face was filled with conflicting emotions.

Xia ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue, his heart aching. He said,””Qingxue, I’m not asking for your forgiveness and understanding, but I really hope that you won’t blame Song Wei. She didn’t want this to happen either, it’s just fate ...”

Ling Qingxue silently stared at the deck below her feet. After a long while, she raised her head and asked,””Ruofei, I just want to ask you one thing. Both her and I have combined cultivation with your spirit body. Who do you want to choose?”

Xia ruofei was in a difficult position. He asked carefully,””Can I choose both?”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened. She glared at Xia ruofei and asked,””What ... What are you thinking?”

“This wasn’t my idea ...” Xia ruofei quickly said.

“Could it be Song Wei’s idea?” Ling Qingxue asked in a bad mood.

“She really was the one who suggested it.” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”To be honest, I was really shocked at that time. However, she said that if I chose to be with her, she would feel guilty for the rest of her life. If I choose you, she, who has experienced the spirit body combined cultivation, will not be able to accept it. So ...”

“She really said that?” Ling Qingxue asked in disbelief.

“Those were her exact words.” Xia ruofei said with certainty.

Ling Qingxue had just experienced the wondrous experience of spirit and body combined cultivation, so she naturally knew how intense the thrill that came from the depths of the soul was in that state.

When she thought about the experience she had just had, Ling Qingxue actually understood Song Wei a little.

However, she quickly came back to her senses and snorted,””How could she have such a ridiculous idea! What era was it now? How could two people ... Be together with the same man at the same time?”

Xia ruofei knew that this was the best time to act humble. He said with a pitiful face,””Qingxue, what should we do? No matter which one of you, I can’t give up on either of you ... Well ... Your cultivation level has reached the standard for joint cultivation, so I immediately brought you to undergo the spirit body joint cultivation. I hope that after you experience it personally, you can understand my ... And Song Wei’s suggestion ...”

Ling Qingxue was stunned for a moment, then she looked at Xia ruofei deeply and said,””RUO Fei, you chose to tell me this when we were out at sea because you were worried that I would leave in a fit of anger, right? In this ocean, I can’t leave even if I want to, right?”

“Isn’t ... Isn’t this a coincidence?”Xia ruofei laughed dryly.

“I think you’ve arranged this, haven’t you?” Ling Qingxue said with a half – Smile,”also, I remember that you won the bet very miraculously yesterday. The bet was for me to agree to one thing. You must have planned this in advance, right? I really didn’t expect that the honest – looking you would actually be so scheming ...”
