Chapter 664: The support of Tian Huilan (1)

At the three mountains Municipal Party committee’s compound.

When Xia ruofei drove to the entrance, he saw Tian Huilan’s personal secretary, Xiao Mei, already waiting by the police post.

Although Tian Huilan was already a member of the provincial Committee, her main focus was still in Sanshan city. Her main job was to keep tabs on the committee. Therefore, even though she had an office in the provincial Committee, she spent most of her time working in the Sanshan Municipal Party.

Xia ruofei’s Knight XV car was very eye – catching. Xiao Mei saw it at first glance and quickly walked up to him.

Xia ruofei stopped the car in front of the eye – catching yellow stop line. He rolled down the window and stuck his head out.”Director Xiao, I’m sorry to trouble you to pick me up personally!”

“Mr. Xia is an important guest.” Xiao Mei smiled and said,”Secretary Tian personally instructed us to be polite. I didn’t dare to neglect ...”

Xiao Mei waved at the armed police at the gate, and the bar in front of the door slowly rose. Xiao Mei opened the door and sat inside.

It wasn’t Xia ruofei’s first time at the three mountains Municipal Party committee’s compound. He parked his car in the reserved parking space in front of the main office building and entered the office building under Xiao Mei’s lead.

There were many government officials walking in and out of the office. When they saw Xiao Mei, they all greeted her very politely. This was the Secretary of the provincial Party leader! Usually, the government Deputy positions at the bottom of the ranking would be polite to her when they saw her.

Naturally, Xia ruofei attracted many curious and inquiring gazes.

Everyone was naturally curious about this young man who was personally welcomed by Secretary Xiao.

Soon, the two of them arrived at Tian Huilan’s office.

Xiao Mei stood at the door of the secretary’s office and said to Xia ruofei,””Mr. Xia, Secretary Tian said that you can go in directly after you arrive. Also, Secretary, you don’t have any other plans for the next hour, so you have plenty of time. ”

......

Xiao Mei’s eyes were also filled with a strange color. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

How could a high – ranking officer like Tian Huilan not have any schedule for an entire hour?

Just because Xia ruofei wanted to visit, Tian Huilan had pushed back two events and delayed the work report from the Director of Finance for an hour.

This showed how much this young man meant to Secretary Tian.

“Thank you, chief Xiao.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he took out a small, wide – mouthed porcelain bottle from his bag and handed it to Xiao Mei, saying,””By the way, director Xiao, this is a cosmetic product that I’ve concocted myself. You can use it directly as a Facial Mask. It’s just a small token of my appreciation, please don’t mind it!”

Xiao Mei’s beautiful eyes were wide open, and she almost lost her composure and cried out. She quickly covered her mouth with her hand and only asked softly after a long while,””Mr. Xia, this ... This is the Jade skin cream that you gave to the Secretary last time?”

After Tian Huilan had used the jaded skin cream, her entire person had undergone a complete transformation. Not only did she look at least ten years younger, but her temperament was also much better than before.

This caused quite a commotion among the government officials, especially the female officials.

As Tian Huilan’s personal secretary, Xiao Mei naturally knew the inside story. It was because she used the jaded skin cream that Xia ruofei had given her.

It was a woman’s nature to love beauty, and Xiao Mei dreamed of getting a jaded skin cream. However, she also knew that this kind of magical cosmetic, especially a handmade one, could not be bought even with money.

He didn’t expect to get it today without much effort. Xia ruofei actually gave him a portion.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. After getting an affirmative answer from Xia ruofei, Xiao Mei was even more excited. However, after she calmed down, she quickly said,””Mr. Xia, this gift is too expensive, I can’t accept it ...”

As she said this, Xiao Mei’s eyes were still looking at the bottle of jaded skin ointment, reluctant to part.

Xia ruofei thought it was funny. In fact, this thing was precious to others, but to him, it was just a matter of time.

“Director Xiao, you’ve helped me a lot all this time. I didn’t even have the chance to express my gratitude.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is just a small token of my appreciation. Besides, I made this by hand and it’s not worth much. It shouldn’t be considered a bribe, right?”

“No...” Xiao Mei quickly waved her hand.

“Then isn’t it settled? You should just accept it!” Xia ruofei stuffed the porcelain bottle into Xiao Mei’s hands and continued,”besides, our company is researching on how to mass produce the jaded skin ointment. I believe that it won’t be long before you can buy it on the market. It’s not something rare.”

Xiao Mei clutched the porcelain bottle that contained the Jade skin cream tightly and asked in surprise,””Really?”

“Of course it’s true!” Xia ruofei said,”but the effect of the mass – produced version will definitely be slightly worse than this handmade one.”

“Thank you, President Xia!” Xiao Mei said happily.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand, then gently knocked on the door of Tian Huilan’s office.

A gentle voice came from inside,””Please enter!”

Xia ruofei pushed the door open and walked in.

Xiao Mei looked at the porcelain bottle in her hand and couldn’t hide her excitement. She couldn’t help but clench her fist and said in a low voice,””Yay!”

She first put the jaded skin ointment in the drawer, then took it out and put it in her bag after some thought. After a few seconds, she took it out of her bag and carefully put it in her pocket. Then she smiled in embarrassment.
