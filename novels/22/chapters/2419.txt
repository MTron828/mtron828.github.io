2420 Chapter 1335 – without anyone knowing (2)

“Don’t worry about it,” Xia ruofei said calmly.”Just keep driving at the current speed!”

The taxi driver said unwillingly, “I’m going to lose him ...”

“If you lose him, it’s on me!” Xia ruofei said,”this stack of money is all yours!”

“That’s good!” The taxi driver said with a smile.

Anyway, he just wanted to make this money. As for whether he would lose the car or not, he didn’t care at all. Maybe it’s even better if we lose him! After all, there was a certain risk in tracking, especially if the target was an extremely evil person.

The taxi driver maintained his speed and drove steadily along the ring line, while the Buick minivan became smaller and smaller in their field of vision. After turning a corner, it completely disappeared from their sight.

“Little brother, I can’t see that car anymore ...” The taxi driver said with a bitter smile.

“It’s okay, just keep driving and listen to my instructions. ” Xia ruofei said calmly.

Although the curve blocked his vision, the distance between the two cars was not very far. At least, it was not beyond the range of Xia ruofei’s spiritual sense. So, even if the car had disappeared from his vision, Xia ruofei could still accurately sense its position and driving movement.

The taxi driver nodded and said,”Alright! Boss, whatever you say!”

In the White Buick GL8, Liu Feng looked back several times. He found that after his car suddenly accelerated, the taxi did not react and was still driving at a steady speed. Until the last taxi disappeared from his vision, he did not see anything wrong.

“Am I being too suspicious?” Liu Feng muttered to himself.

“Brother Feng, did you find anything?” Liu haojun asked.

Liu Feng shook his head and said,”I haven’t found anything wrong for the time being ... Forget it, let’s not care about this!” Master Xu, you can slow down a little. It’s not safe to drive too fast. ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Alright!” The driver, old Xu, nodded and said with a smile.

The Buick GL8 had also ended its racing mode and was once again driving on the ring line at a relatively safe speed.

In the car, Xia ruofei suddenly said,””Enter the side road at the intersection ahead ... Then exit at the second exit of the wheel ... Then turn left!”

The taxi driver found it strange that this passenger seemed to be coming to Chang ‘an city for the first time! He doesn’t sound like a local, but why does he seem so familiar with the roads?

Xia ruofei was sitting in the front passenger seat. The driver could see that Xia ruofei was not using his phone to check the map.

“Alright!” Although the driver was a little curious, he immediately responded.

After that, Xia ruofei would give the taxi driver an order from time to time, directing the car to turn left and right in the city for a full 40 to 50 minutes.

In the end, Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows. His spiritual power had already sensed that the Buick GL8 had stopped in front of a restaurant. At this time, the straight line distance between the taxi and the business car was only a few hundred meters. Of course, because of the winding roads, the two cars were probably one or two kilometers apart.

“Sir, let’s find a place to Park!” Xia ruofei immediately said.

The taxi driver felt that today’s work was the strangest. The passengers were also eccentric. They directed him to circle around the city. At first, they said that they wanted to track the business car, but they lost it after a while. From then on, the shadow of the business car had never appeared in their vision again.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he couldn’t see the MPV, the taxi driver would have thought that Xia ruofei was instructing him to track the MPV. Although that was the truth, Xia ruofei would not tell the driver so much. Even if he did, the driver would not believe him.

The driver found a parking spot and stopped the car by the side.

Xia ruofei passed the stack of money to the driver and smiled.””It’s been hard on you, master!”

When the driver received the stack of cash, he naturally smiled and thanked her repeatedly.

After Xia ruofei got out of the car, he observed the terrain. He could basically tell that if Liu Feng wanted to complete the mission without anyone knowing, he would not choose this place to attack.

This was because there were many people coming and going here, and there were many surveillance cameras. In addition, he had just come out of the airport when he was picked up by Liu haojun. If something happened to Liu haojun here, he would definitely be suspected.

However, Xia ruofei had enough patience.

It was noon, and the business of the restaurant seemed to be good. There were many customers coming in and out.

Liu haojun had already walked into the restaurant with Liu Feng.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power detected that Liu haojun and Liu Feng had come to a large private room on the third floor of the restaurant. Liu haojun had ordered a table of good dishes to welcome Liu Feng.

Xia ruofei could not help but laugh in his heart,”if Liu haojun knew that Liu Feng’s mission was to get rid of him, I wonder what kind of expression he would have!”

There was a café opposite the restaurant. Xia ruofei walked into the café and ordered a cup of cabbino. Then, he sat by the glass window on the side of the road and enjoyed the view of Chang ‘an city while sipping his coffee.

Of course, he kept his spirit energy in a constant state of diffusion. The target of his surveillance was Liu haojun and Liu Feng in the big room on the third floor of the opposite restaurant.

The two of them ate from around 12:30 pm until past 2 pm, and both of them had some alcohol.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power did not relax. He kept monitoring the situation in the private room.

Therefore, he knew very well that Liu Feng did not reveal anything to Liu haojun, not even a hint.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but sigh.”He’s indeed old master Liu’s trusted confidant. Liu haojun calls him” brother Feng “so affectionately. He even personally went to the airport to pick him up and then to the luxury restaurant to welcome him back. Yet, he’s thinking about how to kill him.”

After Xia ruofei had changed to his third cup of coffee, Liu haojun and Liu Feng finally came out.

Xia ruofei took out two hundred – Yuan bills and placed them under the coffee cup. Then, he stood up and left the coffee shop.

This time, the two of them didn’t go anywhere else. Liu haojun sent Liu Feng to the Wanhao hotel where he stayed, then took his leave and returned to Pingan County in a Buick business car.

Just as Xia ruofei had expected, Liu Feng did not make a move when they were in contact.

Xia ruofei had been keeping an eye on Liu Feng outside the hotel the whole time. He did not bother about Liu haojun because as long as Liu Feng followed old man Liu’s orders, Liu Feng would definitely go to Liu haojun in the end. Hence, he did not need to follow Liu haojun at all.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual power detected that after Liu Feng returned to the hotel room, he immediately lay down and slept. He only ordered a meal with the room phone when night fell.

After the meal, Liu Feng took a very formal bath and changed his clothes, looking very ritualistic.

Of course, when Liu Feng was taking a bath, Xia ruofei retracted his spiritual power. He did not have a special habit of peeking at a man taking a bath.

After Liu Feng changed into clean black clothes, he shaved his beard and finally took out a pair of shiny black leather shoes from the suitcase.

After changing, Liu Feng left the room with a small suitcase.

Xia ruofei spent the entire afternoon in an old residential area not far from the hotel. He found a residential building facing the hotel that did not have strict security. He went straight to the rooftop and sat there, maintaining his spiritual power.

It was not until Liu Feng had tidied up and left the room with his suitcase that Xia ruofei stood up from the rooftop opposite and went downstairs with light steps.

Liu Feng stopped a taxi downstairs and headed to Pingan County, where Liu haojun was, overnight.

Xia ruofei had been using his spiritual power to monitor Liu Feng. Naturally, he “heard” Liu Feng’s destination, a high – end apartment District in Xuanji’s Pingan County. It was Liu haojun’s temporary residence.

Therefore, he immediately hailed a taxi and rushed to Pingan County.
