3273 The scene reappears (2)

After the gourd – shaped ceramic instrument appeared, it quietly floated about a meter above the moon.

Everyone was staring at the ceramic instrument, hoping to hear the intoxicating music that they had heard in the illusionary demonstration.

It was strange. After everyone experienced that wonderful illusion, everything they experienced in the environment was engraved in their minds. It was extremely profound, not missing any small details. However, they couldn’t remember the melody of the music played by the ceramic instrument. They only had a very intuitive feeling that the music was so beautiful that they couldn’t help but be intoxicated.

At first, Xia ruofei thought that he was the only one who could recall the exact melody. However, after asking the other eight members of the exploration team, he realized that they were all the same. They could not recall the exact melody.

However, after waiting for about half a minute, the ceramic instrument did not move at all. It just floated there quietly.

“What’s the situation?” Chen Xuan couldn’t help but Mutter to himself.

“It can’t be that they want us to play it, right? We can’t remember the melody of the song!” Mu Jianfei asked,”by the way, what instrument is this? I’ve never seen it before. ”

The elder of the soaring Flower Valley, Yang Liu, stared at the ceramic instrument and said,””It looks like an ancient musical instrument called the Xun ...”

“Elder yang, do you recognize this instrument?” Xia ruofei asked. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Liu nodded slightly and said,”I do have some understanding of Yi. If I’m not wrong, this should be Tao Feng.”

“Please introduce us!” Chen Xuan said.

Willow said,”the Xun appeared about 7000 years ago. It is one of the oldest wind instruments in China. Most of them are round or oval. Gourd – shaped ones are really rare ... But did everyone notice that there are six holes on this gourd – shaped ceramic instrument? there are two rows of three holes in each row ...”

Xia ruofei and the others looked closely and realized that it was true.

“This is one of the distinctive features of the Leviathan,” Willow continued. Under normal circumstances, if one were to hold it with both hands and play it to the mouth of the pot, the six holes were the sound holes. By closing and opening them, as well as different combinations, they could make different sounds. The principle was similar to playing a flute. The sound produced by the Xun is very beautiful, and at the same time, it has a unique ethereal texture. ”

“I’ve really gained some knowledge!” Xia ruofei smiled and continued to ask,”so, elder Yang can play this ancient instrument?”

Yu Xin ‘er smiled and said,”martial uncle Yang’s musical Foundation is the strongest in our flying flower Valley. I’ve never seen a musical instrument that can stop her!”

Willow smiled bitterly.”It’s no problem to play a simple instrument. The principles of the instruments are similar, but ... Even if I barely know how to play it, we can’t remember the melody of the song. It’s useless!”

“That’s a problem ...” Xia ruofei could not help but frown. At the same time, he tried to recall the illusion he had experienced. However, no matter how hard he tried, he could not remember anything about the song. It was as if he was looking at flowers in the fog. He could not remember any specific melody.

Shen tianfang, Chen Xuan, and the rest were also trying to recall their experience in the illusion. However, just like Xia ruofei, they could not recall anything from their expressions.

At that moment, Ling Qingxue’s eyes lit up and she said,””Elder yang, do you think it’s the song that brought us into the illusion?”

Ling Qingxue’s words seemed to have opened up a door, making everyone feel as if they had suddenly been enlightened.

“That’s quite a possibility!”Chen Xuan exclaimed excitedly. In any case, this is the first time I’ve heard such a magical song in my life. If I were to ask what song this ceramic instrument is most likely to play, I think it might really be that song!”

Xia ruofei calmly analyzed,”let’s analyze it together!” If it’s that song, why didn’t we remember this part of the illusion demonstration? Do you think it’s because we’re already in the illusion constructed by the song, and we can’t hear the melody clearly in the illusion? we can’t even hear a single syllable!”

Shen tianfang opened his eyes and said,””You don’t know the true face of Mount Lu and are only fated to be on this mountain?”

“This is what I meant!” Xia ruofei said,”what do you guys think?”

“Interesting ...” Shen tianfang smiled.”No matter how likely it is, I think we should ask elder yang to give it a try first. What if we’re right?”

Everyone turned to look at the Willow. Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Elder yang, you’re the most proficient in musical instruments here, no one else can! It seems that I can only trouble you! By the way, you probably haven’t forgotten that song, have you?”

“I do remember the tune,” said Willow with a smile. “It shouldn’t be a problem for me to play it with a Xun.” If I was on earth, I would just practice a few more times, but now ... How can I brag?”

Everyone was wearing a bloated spacesuit. In fact, the spacesuit was like a miniature survival cabin. Everyone was completely isolated from the outside world.

The head was a transparent cover that didn’t affect one’s vision at all. The inside of the spacesuit was normal atmospheric pressure, and oxygen was constantly being absorbed from the oxygen module, so the environment inside the spacesuit was basically the same as earth. Of course, everyone was on the moon, and the gravity they felt was only about one – sixth of earth ‘s.

Then, here came the problem.

How could he play this instrument when he was wrapped up so tightly?

Willow thought for a while and said,”how about ... I take off my helmet?” I should be able to hold on for a while in such an environment ...”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly,”you can’t blow this Vulture even if you’re directly exposed to the vacuum!” There isn’t even air here, and sound can’t travel!”

Yang Liu was stunned for a moment and said,”I really didn’t think of this ... Then what should we do?”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”it’s obvious now. It doesn’t matter if we’re right or not. At least we have to make this thing sound ... But it can’t be done in a vacuum, so ... Why don’t we try to put it into the storage space and then take it out directly into the mask? then we just need to control the holes with our spiritual power and we should be able to play it.”

Yang Liu hesitated for a moment and said,”directly put it into the storage magic treasure?” It’s very likely that this was left behind by a powerful cultivator ...”

“We can only try this now ...” Shen tianfang supported Xia ruofei’s opinion.

Following which, Chen Xuan and mu Hua also expressed their approval.

As for the opinions of the Qi condensation cultivators, they weren’t important ...

Hence, Yang Liu decided to take everyone’s advice. She took a deep breath and used her mental power to probe Tao Feng. Then, she had an idea ...

At this time, everyone was on guard, afraid of any unexpected danger, especially Willow, who was more careful.

However, Tao Feng disappeared into thin air without any accidents.

Immediately after, Willow revealed a look of surprise and said,””It’s really in! I’ll try to release it into my mask ...”

Then, everyone saw Tao Feng appear behind the transparent mask of the Willow.

The spacesuits ‘interior was quite spacious, and since Tao Feng wasn’t that big, the space inside the spacesuits could easily accommodate it.

Willow first used her mind power to support Tao Feng, then said, “I’ll try to play that song ...”

After she finished speaking, she held Tao Feng’s breath in her mouth and used six wisps of mental power to seal the six vocal holes. Then, she began to test the sound.
