3612 Treating and saving people (2)

The Galini family was known for their ruthless methods.

Of course, Paradise Farm was not worth mentioning to Tang He's huge industry. He didn't have to personally make a trip to the farm. If Liang Qichao wasn't Xia ruofei's friend and the junior that he admired the most, he probably wouldn't even send a medical team.

Xia ruofei chuckled."Mr. Tang, you don't have to worry about safety. I'm very safe in Australia. I won't leave until I settle the matter at Paradise Farm."

After saying this, Xia ruofei didn't wait for Tang He to persuade him again and immediately continued,""Mr. Tang, I'm calling you this time mainly to discuss brother Liang's treatment."

Tang He could not help but sigh and said," "I'm also very concerned about Qi Chao's situation. The medical team reports to me in written emails every day about the treatment, but it doesn't look very good now! I'm afraid Lil Chao won't be able to keep his legs. I don't even know how to explain this to Weimin and his wife!"

Xia ruofei said, "I've got a general idea of the situation. Brother Liang's injuries are not light, but it's not to the point of amputation." I've already contacted a high-end private clinic in the City of Sydney. I'm going to transfer brother Liang there tomorrow to receive treatment that combines Chinese and Western medicine. Brother Liang has already agreed to this, so I called you to tell you. Also ... The medical team from United States can be withdrawn tomorrow!"

"What?" Tang He was very surprised. "You mean little Chao's legs can still be saved?"

"I can only say that the chances are very high!" Xia ruofei didn't give a definite answer.

"Kevin Qiao is a well-known surgeon in the United States, and he's second to none in the Chinese circle. If he can't do anything, do you think the local private clinic in Sydney can?" Tang He said doubtfully.

"I'm pretty confident about this. " Xia ruofei said, "Mr. Tang, don't worry and call the medical team back. I'll take responsibility if anything happens here!"

"It's not that I don't trust you, brother Xia," said Tang He."I'm just a little uncertain. "Of course, I completely agree with you transferring super to another hospital for treatment, but there's no need to ask the medical team I sent to come back immediately, right? It would be better to leave them in Sydney so that they could be of use in case of an emergency. I promise they won't interfere with the rest of the treatment!"

Xia ruofei knew that Tang He was so insistent because he cared about Liang Qichao.

Hence, Xia ruofei only muttered to himself for a while before he nodded and said, "This works too. But I'll have to trouble you to explain it clearly to doctor Qiao so that he won't have any misunderstandings."

"No problem!" Tang He said readily, "I'll let them book a hotel in Sydney and stay there. They'll be on standby! Also, I'll tell them that from now on, you'll be fully in charge of the entire team, and they'll be at your disposal at any time. How about it?"

"Then, thank you, old Mr. Tang!" Xia ruofei said.

"You're too kind, brother Xia!" Tang He said, "if Lil Chao's legs can be saved, I'll have to thank you!"

After Xia ruofei hung up the phone, he leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes to rest for a while. Soon, the car arrived at Saint Saint Vincent Hospital.

He told the driver to wait for him in the car for a while, then called Kevin Qiao as he walked into the hospital building.

When Xia ruofei walked out of the elevator on the floor of the intensive care unit, Kevin Qiao was already waiting there.

Kevin Qiao's feelings were complicated. He had received Tang He's call when Xia ruofei was still on the road. He knew that Liang Qichao would be transferred to another hospital the next morning, and the follow-up treatment would have nothing to do with them. "Mr. Xia!" Kevin stepped forward and greeted.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at him. He asked," "Dr. Qiao, has old Mr. Tang told you about it?"

Qiao Kaiwen bitterly smiled and nodded, saying,"Yes! Our team's follow-up work arrangements will be at your command, Mr. Xia!"

"It's not an order, it's all for the patient!" Xia ruofei said, "Dr. Qiao, since you already know the follow-up arrangements, please help Liang Qichao complete the transfer procedures before the hospital starts work tomorrow. I've contacted a high-end private clinic tomorrow morning and they will send someone over to deal with the transfer!"

"You went to Australia?" he asked. Tang He was very surprised."Brother Xia, it's very dangerous for you to be in Australia at this time! A gentleman does not stand under a dangerous wall. You'd better leave as soon as possible!" Such a big incident had happened at Paradise Farm, and even Liang Qichao almost lost his life. Tang He had only sent an Elite Surgical team and remotely coordinated the matters of Paradise Farm in the United States. He himself did not come personally, mostly out of consideration for personal safety.
