Seeing that Xia ruofei was no longer insistent on paying the endorsement fee, Jennifer smiled and said,””Xia, I’ll be able to work with you at any time for the next five days. The crew of ‘the angel of doom’ will be coming over to help today. I wish you all the best!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”thanks!” Sister – in – Law, I hope miss Duff can make time to attend our product launch. ”

If they had signed Dong Xinyu according to the original plan, the contract would have clearly stated the rights and obligations of the image spokesperson, including cooperating with the shooting of advertisement films, the right to use portraits, and the number of promotional activities she would participate in each year.

However, Tang Yitian had invited Duff as the spokesperson out of friendship, so they couldn’t force her to attend many promotional events. At least, it wouldn’t be written into the contract.

“What’s the rough time of your product launch?” Jennifer asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”within a month.” The preliminary preparations are almost done, and the approval process is almost complete. We’re now preparing the goods!”

Hearing this, Jennifer immediately said without hesitation,””Then, Duff should still be filming in China. There are many scenes in ‘the angel of doom’ that need to be filmed in China. I’ll ask Duff to take a leave of absence from the crew and attend!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said happily,”that’s no problem!”

Jennifer chuckled and said to Feng Rao,””Feng, did I say it wrong? I don’t think you have time to accompany us to tour the capital today. ”

“Jennifer, I’m really grateful to you this time!” Feng Rao said with gratitude. You’ve done us a great favor ...”

“Timely assistance?” Jennifer blinked her eyes and asked, her “idiom addiction” acting up again.

“Yes, yes, yes! It’s really timely!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

At this time, Tang Yitian also stood up and said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, you must have a lot of details to discuss with Duff! You don’t have to accompany us today!”

Although Tang Haoran really wanted to play with his master, he was very sensible and didn’t say anything. He just looked a little disappointed.

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,””Big brother Tang, I’ve handed over the company’s specific matters to President Feng, so I’m not needed here. However ... I do have something else to deal with today. I’ll finish this as soon as possible and meet up with you in the afternoon!”

“Sure!” Tang Yitian said readily. Then we’ll be leaving first!”

Jennifer said a few words to Duff and then called the person in charge of the crew on the spot, asking them to send a few capable staff to the hotel with the equipment to find Feng Jing. Then, she left the hotel with Tang Haoran and Tang Yitian.

Now that the problem of the spokesperson had been solved, Feng Jing was extremely excited and passionate about her work.

She only had five days, so she made every second count. She brought Daphne back to her room and discussed the details of the advertisement and posters with her.

Duff was a popular star, so he had to discuss the idea, script, and the like with her.

Xia ruofei left this matter to Feng Jing. He left the hotel and took a taxi to Hengfeng jewelry’s flagship store in the capital.

Ma Zhiming had already given his instructions overnight. Xia ruofei also had the contact information of Xiao Xiaohong, the General Manager of the flagship store in the capital. He had called manager Xiao in the taxi.

“Manager Xiao? I’m Xia ruofei. ” Xia ruofei said,”your Boss Ma should have contacted you, right?”

When Xiao Xiaohong heard Xia ruofei introduce himself, she immediately became very enthusiastic.””Hello, Mr. Xia! President Ma has already told us that several pieces of high – Quality Jade have been prepared. You can come and choose at any time!”

“I’m already on my way. Sorry to trouble you, manager Xiao!”Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re welcome, you’re welcome!” Xiao Xiaohong said,”I’ll see you later, Mr. Xia!”

“Alright!”

When he arrived at the entrance of Hengfeng jewelry shop near Jianguo Road, Xia ruofei saw a young woman in a black business suit standing at the door with a phone in her hand.

The branch in Beijing was indeed the biggest flagship store in the country. From the outside, one could tell that the store was huge. It was at least as big as a dozen normal stores in the vicinity combined.

Xia ruofei paid the fare and got out of the car. The young woman in Black business attire looked up and immediately welcomed him warmly.

“Hello, are you Mr. Xia ruofei?” The young woman asked with a trace of respect.

She was also surprised that Xia ruofei had come by taxi. She thought to herself,”I didn’t expect Mr. Xia to be so low – Key. Fortunately, Boss Ma sent me a photo of this Mr. Xia yesterday. Otherwise, I might not have recognized him.”

As soon as Xia ruofei heard the voice, he knew that this charming young woman was manager Xiao, Xiao Xiaohong, whom he had just contacted on the phone.

“You’re manager Xiao, right?”he smiled and nodded. How could I let you wait for me outside! I’ll go in and find you myself. ”

“I should, I should!” Xiao Xiaohong quickly said,”Mr. Xia, please come in!”

Xiao Xiaohong also felt a little relieved. This Mr. Xia looked quite approachable.
