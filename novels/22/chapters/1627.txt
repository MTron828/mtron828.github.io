Chapter 1628: You’re the one I’m scamming (1)

Liu haofan’s eyes were bloodshot, and the veins on his forehead were bulging. He looked a little ferocious.

Zhou Tianyu saw that the situation wasn’t good, so he quickly pulled Liu haofan’s sleeve and said in a low voice,””Young master Liu, calm down ...”

The price had been raised to 380 million, and there was no longer any profit to be made from this land. The most important thing in doing business was to make money with harmony. There was no need to waste money on a momentary dispute.

Zhou Tianyu also didn’t expect the price of the land to be so high. He was still full of confidence before he came. The evaluation team of Tang real estate had come to the same conclusion as Zhao Yongjun and the others, thinking that 320 million would be enough.

Even if he met Xia ruofei and the others, he predicted that there would be a fight. Zhou Tianyu only estimated that 350 million would be enough.

However, before he could even react, the price had already soared to 380 million, which was really unexpected.

Hence, Zhou Tianyu hoped that Liu haofan would give up on the land.

However, how could Liu haofan, who was already so angry that his heart had been attacked, listen to any advice?

He shook off Zhou Tianyu’s hand and said coldly,””Director Zhou, before we came, your director Xu said that the final decision for this auction is on my side!”

Zhou Tianyu said with a bitter face,”yes, but young master Liu ... This price is too high. It’s not wise to continue to follow up ...”

Liu haofan’s face darkened and he said,”Zhou Tianyu, it’s not your turn to teach me!” If your Great Tang doesn’t want to cooperate, you can withdraw now!”

Then, Liu haofan ignored Zhou Tianyu and raised his board, shouting,””We bid 390 million!”

On Xia ruofei’s side, song Rui’s face was filled with joy. It was just as they had predicted. Liu haofan was too rash and didn’t think too much. Although he couldn’t get the land, he had scammed Liu haofan of tens of millions of Yuan. Song Rui was very happy.

But what song Rui didn’t expect was that as soon as Liu haofan finished speaking, Xia ruofei raised his board without hesitation and said calmly,”” 400 million!”

Many people gasped. Even Zhao Yongjun was surprised. He turned to look at Xia ruofei in shock. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This price made Zhao Yongjun’s heart jump. He thought that Xia ruofei would stop bidding, but he didn’t expect Xia ruofei to continue raising the price. If Liu haofan gave up now, it would be equivalent to them losing the bid.

Although they were preparing to develop it into a club, not real estate, the extra tens of millions of land cost would make the follow – up funds difficult to make ends meet. Moreover, it might take a lot of time to earn back the tens of millions of capital.

The other representatives of the real estate companies, who had been reduced to onlookers, were even more dumbfounded.

Since when did little Tang town become so short on land?

At the same time, they were also secretly complaining about how Qingqing’s land auctions were like. The price this time was so high that it might set a benchmark effect. In the future, the price of land in similar areas would also become higher.

Even song Rui felt a little uneasy. He thought to himself,”isn’t this too big of a gamble?” What if Liu er, that fool, suddenly awakened and stopped following?

The facts proved that song Rui and Zhao Yongjun were overthinking.

How could the hot – blooded Liu haofan think so much at this time? Seeing that Xia ruofei was still raising the price, his first reaction was to raise his sign and shout,”” 410 million!”

This was the kind of aura he wanted, to let his opponent feel his determination.

Now, they were all increasing the price by ten million. The minimum increase of one million had long since become useless.

Zhou Tianyu sat at the side with a bitter smile. When he heard Liu haofan’s outrageous bid, he couldn’t help but cover his face.

After Liu haofan made his bid, he immediately glared at Xia ruofei provocatively.

Xia ruofei, Zhao Yongjun, and song Rui looked at each other. He smiled and threw the sign on the table in front of him, then said lightly,””Young master Liu is indeed bold! 410 million for such a piece of land, he was really rich! We’re not playing anymore ...”

Liu haofan was stunned.

Only then did he realize that the price had unknowingly increased by tens of millions, and his final bid was actually 410 million! Moreover, the other party had actually given up on the game so easily.

How could he not understand now? Xia ruofei was obviously raising the price on purpose to make him spend more money ...

Song Rui finally couldn’t help but laugh out loud. He laughed while clapping and said,””Wonderful! It was simply too exciting! I really didn’t expect this piece of land to be so valuable. Liu er, general manager Zhou, congratulations! I hope you can make a fortune on this land and earn a lot of money! Hahaha ...”

Liu haofan’s face was as black as the bottom of a pot. Zhou Tianyu could only smile bitterly and ask what else he could say. One should not be afraid of a God – like opponent, but of a pig – like teammate!

Xia ruofei waved his hand at the auctioneer and said,””I’m not following, you can announce the result now ...”

Only then did the auctioneer come back to his senses. He asked a few more times if anyone wanted to increase the price. This was just a procedure. Only a fool would continue to increase the price! If Liu haofan had been calm enough, he would have retreated when Xia ruofei bid 400 million.

As such, the final result was without any suspense. The auctioneer quickly announced that the winning company was da Tang real estate, and the final price was 410 million HxB.

There was a burst of applause, but the applause sounded a little harsh to Liu haofan, as if he had become a fool.

His hatred for Xia ruofei and song Rui grew stronger.

In contrast, song Rui was beaming with joy. Those who didn’t know better would have thought that he was the one who won the bid and not Liu haofan!

Song Rui felt that his anger had been vented, especially when he saw Liu haofan’s constipated expression after he won the bid. Song Rui felt even more comfortable, as if he had drunk iced sour plum soup in the hot summer.

When they were leaving the stage, Liu haofan walked to Xia ruofei and the others.

Song Rui frowned and stood in front of Xia ruofei. He said in an unfriendly tone,””Liu er, what are you doing ... Stay away from RUO Fei!”

Zhao Yongjun didn’t say anything, but he immediately stood beside Xia ruofei. His body language was very clear.

Liu haofan pouted, looked at song Rui, and said,””Song Rui, do you think I’m as brainless as you? Don’t worry, I just want to get to know this hero!”

“Don’t be so weird!” Song Rui said,”if I were you, I’d support you as far as I can. I’ll just be your spendthrift!”

Liu haofan pouted and said,”look at you!” It was as if he had won against the entire world! It’s just a few million more! I have money! I don’t care!”

“Yes, you, young master Liu, are rich!” Song Rui said with a smile,”you can still hear the sound of tens of millions of Yuan being thrown into the water! Hitting on this ... What else can you do other than make your stupid reputation a little better? Hahaha ...”

“Childish!” Liu haofan sneered and ignored song Rui. He looked at Xia ruofei and said,”friend, you’ve gone a little too far today! Maybe you were used by song Rui, but I’ll remember you. Don’t worry, the capital is not big, and we’ll have to move around ...”

“Haofan, you have to be more magnanimous. Are you a sore loser?” Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but frown when he saw Liu haofan threatening Xia ruofei so arrogantly.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved at Zhao Yongjun. Then, he looked at Liu haofan and said,””I agree with you. The world will change ... That’s right, I believe we’ll meet again soon.”

“Then let’s wait and see!” Liu haofan snorted and glared at Xia ruofei coldly. Then, he left with a flick of his sleeves.

“What the hell ...” Song Rui looked at Liu haofan’s back unhappily and spat.

Zhao Yongjun smiled bitterly at Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, we’ve gone a little too far today. We’ve really offended Liu haofan. There’s no need to ...”

“Brother Zhao, I don’t like what you’re saying!” Song Rui said,”your position is obviously wrong! What’s wrong with Liu er? Didn’t he just rely on his good grandfather? What ability did he have? Could it be that no one else could bid for the land that he had his eyes on? I think ruofei did a great job today!”

Zhao Yongjun looked at song Rui helplessly and said,””Xiao Rui, I didn’t say that we can’t offend Liu er. It’s just that there’s no need to. Actually, it’s enough. Now that things have come to this, you’ve made yourself an enemy!”

“So what?” Song Rui straightened his neck and said,”do we have to be afraid of him?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,””Alright, alright, don’t just stand there. Let’s talk as we walk ...”

Zhao Yongjun looked deeply at Xia ruofei, and the group walked out.

Very quickly, they met up with Hou Liang and Wei Jun and went straight to the parking lot.

On the way, Xu Zixuan and Liu Jian, who were basically just spectators, told Hou Liang and Wei Jun about what had happened at the auction. When the two of them heard that such an interesting story had happened, they couldn’t help but feel a little regretful that they had missed such a good show.

At the same time, they couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei with admiration as he fought with the second young master of the Liu family. There weren’t many people in the capital who dared to do this.

After everyone got their cars, Zhao Yongjun and song Rui sat in Xia ruofei’s Land Rover as usual, while the other four sat in the Mercedes – Benz. The two cars left the hot spring resort one after the other and headed towards the city.

On the way, Zhao Yongjun sighed,””Looks like I’ll have to inspect the other plots of land as soon as possible ... Xiao Rui, are there any other places in the suburbs that have been given up recently?”

“Zixuan and Liu Jian were the ones running around for the details, you’ll have to ask them.” Song Rui said.

Even though they felt good about setting Liu haofan up, the objective reality was that they had no fate with this piece of land. They would have to re – evaluate the location of the clubhouse, which would be a bunch of troublesome things. Thinking about this, they couldn’t help but feel a little down ...

At this moment, Xia ruofei, who was driving, suddenly said,””Brother Zhao, there’s no need to inspect the other lands yet!”
