Hence, Zhou leiyun did not dare to treat Xia ruofei lightly.

However, Xia ruofei agreed to Wu Lei’s request immediately, which made Wu Lei feel flattered. He quickly said,””Thank you! Thank you, brother Xia!”

Then, Wu Lei quickly said,”brother Xia, the next game is next Saturday. We’re playing against bar?a as an away game.” It’s because this game is so important that everyone is looking forward to you taking us to defeat bar?a!”

Xia ruofei calculated silently. There were still six days left before the competition next Saturday.

Although it was an away game, Barcelona, like Spain, was located in Barcelona, so there was no need for an expedition. Even if they had to carry out some adaptive training in advance, as well as practice with everyone to find the feeling of cooperation, two or three days in advance was enough.

It would take about 15 to 16 hours to fly from Paradise Island in the South Pacific Ocean.

In other words, he would be able to leave in three days.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei said,””No problem! I’ll return to the team two or three days in advance to train with everyone and find out how well we work together. Then, next Saturday, we’ll go to Nokama and turn it upside down!”

“Haha!” Wu Lei said excitedly. With brother Xia joining us, we have the confidence to cause trouble for Barcelona! Who says that a small ball club can’t counterattack a powerhouse club?”

“Then I’ll see you in Spain mid – week!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Zhou Zhong Jian!” Wu Lei said happily.

Once Xia ruofei hung up, Ling Qingxue could not help but ask,””Ruofei, you’re going to Spain to participate in the competition again?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded,”yeah!” The team will be facing a strong opponent next weekend, and now it is a critical time to attack the European zone. Every point is very important, so they want me to go back and help the team! I’m not particularly busy these days, so I’ll agree to it!”

Ling Qingxue cheered and said,”I want to go too!” I haven’t seen you play in person yet!”

In fact, Xia ruofei had only played half of the game. Other than the employees of paradise Corporation who went on a trip with Xia ruofei, his friends and family only found out about Xia ruofei’s wonderful performance through the internet after that.

“Ruofei, I want to go too!” Song Wei could not help but say.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”this is such a good place for cultivation. Don’t you want to stay here and cultivate?”

Hearing this, Ling Qingxue’s expression became conflicted.

Indeed, as soon as she came to the Peach Blossom Island, she was deeply attracted to it. The beautiful sea view was secondary, and the rich spirit Qi on the island would really make any cultivator’s heart beat faster.

Song Wei, who was at the side, burst out laughing and said,””Sister Qingxue, you’ve been tricked by this guy! He’s not on the island anymore, and the efficiency of us cultivating alone is so low. What’s the point of staying?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Ling Qingxue finally reacted. She pouted and hit Xia ruofei a few times.”Hey! How can you be so bad! Are you still hiding women in Europe? That’s why you don’t want me to go with Wei Wei?”

Xia ruofei’s expression froze and he quickly said,””That’s not true! Don’t you speak without thinking ...”

He unconsciously thought of Monica, who was far away in Italy, but fortunately, his psychological quality was very good. Other than a slight distraction, he did not give himself away.

Ling Qingxue was just making a casual remark. In fact, she did not have any suspicions in that direction. She and Song Wei could not help but laugh when they saw Xia ruofei’s aggrieved face.

Xia ruofei also heaved a sigh of relief and quickly changed the topic.””Since we’ve decided, let’s go to Spain together! By the way, are your visas okay?”

Xia ruofei was mainly worried about Song Wei because Ling Qingxue, like him, had a business visa to Spain, Italy, and other major European countries, which allowed her to go back and forth multiple times.

Song Wei nodded and said,””No problem! My visa is still valid, so I can enter the country at any time!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei said,”then I’ll accompany you to cultivate these few days! We’ll leave in three days!”

Xia ruofei continued,”by the way, the island’s staff isn’t here yet. We have to rely on ourselves for food, clothing, accommodation, and transportation. The facilities here will be more and more perfect in the future!” The staff will also be assembled very quickly!”

“I’m fine!” Ling Qingxue said happily,”it’s even more peaceful now!”

Xia ruofei then called Liu An, who had settled down in evates Island, and asked him to immediately apply for a flight route to Barcelona, Spain. He also asked him to make a flight plan as soon as possible. The plane had to take off from Paradise Island at 8 am local time in three days.

After calling the cabin crew, Xia ruofei received a call from Zhou leiyun.

Wu Lei reported to Zhou leiyun immediately after the call with Xia ruofei ended. When Zhou leiyun heard that Xia ruofei did not wait for his invitation and immediately agreed to come back to play against Barcelona, he suddenly felt a little passive. No matter what, this phone call should have been made by Zhou leiyun himself, not Wu Lei.

Zhou leiyun quickly called Xia ruofei and apologized profusely.

Xia ruofei was in a good mood today. Zhou leiyun had the cunning of a businessman, but he was not a bad person. Hence, Xia ruofei did not criticize him. Instead, he comforted him.

Naturally, Zhou leiyun was secretly touched. At the same time, he immediately took action. While he took the business jet to Barcelona, he also transferred two people from the domestic company to the club to be in charge of security. He wanted Xia ruofei to return to the club, and everything would naturally be guaranteed according to the highest standards.

……

For the next three days, Xia ruofei put aside all worldly matters and accompanied Ling Qingxue and Song Wei on the Peach Blossom Island, living a life of a fairy couple. He also took a lot of time to take turns with the two to practice the “absolute beginning Scripture”.

The two of them had just broken through. After Xia ruofei broke through to a major realm, their joint cultivation was even more helpful. After three days of cultivation, the actual cultivation time was far more than that. This was because Xia ruofei would use the time array flag every time. Although they were still a little far from Level 5, their cultivation had taken a solid step forward.

Xia ruofei had also benefited a lot from cultivation.

After three days, most of the genuine Qi in his body had been transformed into primordial Qi. At most, there was only ten percent left.

In fact, if Xia ruofei put in a little more effort or spent more time practicing the great Dao Arts, this 10% of genuine Qi would probably have been converted into elemental energy.

However, Xia ruofei did not do so.

This was because after all the true Qi had been transformed into primordial Qi, it would soon form a golden core cyclone in the dantian, and this was also a clear sign of a cultivator entering the early stage of the Golden core realm.

The Jindan breathing current could be said to be the foundation of the Jindan stage. If this Foundation was not solid, it would also determine the lack of energy after the cultivation.

Different cultivation techniques and different foundations could lead to different qualities of the Golden core.

It would be much easier for a high – grade golden core cultivator to break through to the nascent Soul Stage or even higher. As for the Golden core of a lower grade, it was very likely that their cultivation would stop at this level for the rest of their lives.

Xia ruofei felt that he wasn’t fully prepared, so he started to suppress his Qi towards the end of his cultivation. He wasn’t in a hurry to convert all his Qi into origin Qi.

In the process of cultivation, he intentionally suppressed this 10% or so true Qi and began to refine his vital Qi.

This was also a typical method introduced in a cultivation ancient book. Through this method, one could suppress the journey of the Golden core cyclone and, to a certain extent, improve the grade of the future golden core.

At this stage, Xia ruofei already had a vague understanding of his future cultivation path. At least, he was confident about how to cultivate in the Golden core stage. Hence, he was not in a hurry and cultivated step by step according to his understanding.

Three days passed by in the blink of an eye. Soon, it was the day that Xia ruofei and the other two would set off for Spain.

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei had already fallen deeply in love with this beautiful island. Thinking about leaving for a while, they suddenly felt a bit reluctant.

However, they quickly got on the plane with Xia ruofei. In a short while, paradise completed its take – off procedure at the empty airport and flew Northwest of Paradise Island ...
