Chapter 1680: I’ve become a WiFi (3)

“I can’t disclose too many details about the forced surrender incident for the time being. After all, the official investigation has not ended yet. But I can tell you that the Australian airline crew was very professional in the entire emergency process. Without their full help, I couldn’t have completed such a task alone. Of course, our luck was also very good ...”

Just as Xia ruofei said that, two Chinese people walked into the camera. They were stunned when they saw Xia ruofei and then exclaimed in surprise,””Mr. Xia! It’s really you!”

Xia ruofei, who was recording the video, was also stunned. He asked hesitantly,””You guys are?”

One of the female passengers cried out in surprise,””Mr. Xia, we were on the same flight as you!”

The male passenger also said excitedly,””Yup! I even took a photo with you at the airport! Have you forgotten? By the way, I posted our group photo on Weibo. It’s all over the internet now!”

It was so chaotic at the airport and there were many people taking photos with Xia ruofei. Naturally, he couldn’t remember it. However, when the kid mentioned Weibo, Xia ruofei remembered.

So you’re the one who exposed me on the internet!

What a coincidence. This was the first person to post the message on Weibo. He and his girlfriend were originally going to Australia for a trip. After the plane landed, they were shocked because of their girlfriend. Moreover, the two of them were originally out for a vacation. Since they had arrived at the tourist destination, Saipan, they decided to stay.

Qplease airlines was also very generous. After all, the passengers had suffered a great shock this time, so everyone was arranged to stay at Kaiyue hotel.

The couple arrived at the hotel slightly later than Xia ruofei. After they settled down, they were in high spirits and went to the beach to play. They did not expect to meet Xia ruofei again.

Xia ruofei squeezed out a smile and said,””Oh! It’s you guys!”

“Yeah, yeah! We’re really fated!” The girl said,”Mr. Xia, let’s take another photo!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

Hence, the three of them took a photo in front of the camera, which was faithfully recorded by Xia ruofei’s camera.

After the photo was taken, the two of them politely shook hands with Xia ruofei and left.

Xia ruofei cleared his throat in front of the camera and continued,””At eighto’ clock tonight, our paradise Corporation will be holding a joint promotion in the official flagship stores of heavenly cat and Jingdong. We’ll start releasing 20% off divine vouchers at Sixo’ clock sharp ...”

Xia ruofei had originally planned to finish recording the video and send it to the back for editing.

To their surprise, the couple saw the other Chinese passengers after a few steps. They quickly called out,””You guys, come over quickly! Mr. Xia is here!”

These six or seven people were passengers who had chosen to stay in Saipan. They had come to the hotel in the same car as the young couple. When they heard that their Savior was here, they were naturally quite excited and ran over.

Xia ruofei was just two sentences away from finishing the recording. He quickly shouted at the camera,””Please continue to support our paradise Corporation ...”

Before he could finish, he was surrounded by enthusiastic passengers. Some were expressing their gratitude, and some were asking for a picture. The scene in the camera was a little chaotic.

The video ended there.

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded after watching the video in his hotel room. When he sent the video back, he even mentioned what had happened during the recording and asked if he needed to re – record it.

Back then, Guan Ping had said that it was fine and that they could edit it well.

But ... What happened to the editing? Xia ruofei couldn’t help but complain. This was not even cut, okay?

Could it be that the art design team of the Paradise Corporation was slacking off? However, wasn’t this a little too exaggerated? Or did they make a mistake when they sent the video? He uploaded the original material as a finished product?

Just as Xia ruofei was about to call Guanping to ask about the situation, the doorbell rang ...
