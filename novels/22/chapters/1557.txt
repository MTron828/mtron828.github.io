Chapter 1558: Awakening (1)

Yu mingdong said,”President Luo, these two pieces of jade are not bad. My factory just happens to be short of Jade of this grade. How about you transfer them to me?” I’ll take the 8 million. ”

The Jade merchants all started discussing in low voices. Those with discerning eyes could naturally see that Yu mingdong was a little reluctant and wanted to help fatty Luo reduce his losses.

These two pieces of material were estimated to be worth about seven million Yuan at most. Yu mingdong was already very kind to buy them back at this price.

Most people thought that Yu mingdong was a good person. Although fatty Luo had lost a lot of money because he had bought the raw stone from him, this was a mutually – willing business, so it couldn’t be blamed on Yu mingdong. On the contrary, many people were gloating over Yu mingdong’s misfortune. Yu mingdong’s actions made everyone think more highly of him.

Fatty Luo was a little muddleheaded, but after hearing Yu mingdong’s words, he came back to his senses and said with a bitter smile,””Old Yu, you’re just pitying me ...”

“Don’t say that! This is business!” Yu mingdong said,”our factory is very short of ice – Type materials. As for you ... I think it’s good to withdraw some funds. There will be a new batch of raw stones on display tomorrow. Who knows, maybe things will turn out well! Thus, this is a win – win situation. ”

A hint of shame appeared on fatty Luo’s face. He had been blinded by profit, so he had rushed to be the scapegoat. In the end, the situation was like this. At that moment, he must have had complaints about Yu mingdong in his heart.

He didn’t expect Yu mingdong to be the first person to stand up and help him.

“Old Luo, we’re all in this line of work, and victory and defeat are common in the military!” Yu mingdong said,”who here hasn’t lost a raw stone before?”

“Old Yu,” fatty Luo said with a wave of his hand,”I won’t say anything else. I’ll remember this favor of yours!”

Fatty Luo wanted to refuse, but he really did need money right now.

If it was in the past, a million Yuan or less would not have mattered to him. However, he had put all his eggs in one basket and used almost all of his cash flow. If the stone went bankrupt, it might even affect his entire company’s operations.

The two pieces of material could be sold for more than a million Yuan. The key was that he could get eight million Yuan in funds at once. Then, he had hope that Dongshan would rise again in the next public bid.

Yu mingdong smiled and nodded, signaling Shi Lei to call the public bid staff over.

Soon, both parties signed a transfer agreement, and Yu mingdong transferred another eight million Yuan to fatty Luo on the spot. At the same time, he put away the two pieces of jade.

Tonight, all of Yu mingdong and Xia ruofei’s raw stones had finally been cut open. The Jade merchants who were watching the show dispersed reluctantly.

To them, it was a thrilling, intense, and dramatic show.

Xia ruofei and Yu mingdong were undoubtedly the biggest winners. Needless to say, Xia ruofei was a newbie who had just come into contact with cutting stones for the first time. He had actually bought a raw stone that had a huge increase in price by accident and made tens of millions.

On the other hand, Yu mingdong had the lucky Halo. He bought the raw stone for more than 20 million Yuan for more than 50 million Yuan. In the end, he bought the Jade in the raw stone for another 8 million Yuan. It was equivalent to him getting two good pieces of material for free and earning more than 30 million Yuan at the same time. He was a big winner!

They had opened a lot of raw stones today, especially the violet Jade, which was priceless, so Yu mingdong naturally hired a car from the escort company to transport these raw stones back to the hotel.

He had already made a call back home. Tomorrow, his family would send more people to transport the Jade back to his Jade processing plant. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Jades were expensive. Yu mingdong naturally couldn’t trust the people of the escort company completely, so the three of them took the escort car back to the hotel together.

On the way, Yu mingdong said to Xia ruofei gratefully,””Mr. Xia, you’ve really saved me this time! If you didn’t remind me, that piece of material would have fallen into my hands! Now that I think about it, I’m still scared!”

Yu mingdong wasn’t exaggerating. If it wasn’t for fatty Luo’s dramatic acquisition, he would be the one with financial problems now. After all, he had spent more than 50 million to buy Xia ruofei’s Jade.

Now, not only did he not lose anything, but he also had more than 30 million in cash. Starting tomorrow, there would be new raw jade stones on the public auction. With this money, Yu mingdong could make a big gamble.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re too kind, chief Yu!” I’m just following my feelings, I don’t know anything about stone gambling ...”

Yu mingdong quickly said,”it’s based on my feeling!” It was based on good feeling! Stone gambling was all about relying on a little intuition. The rules that everyone had concluded were often not the case when it came to actual combat operations. Those experts had a clear and logical explanation, but not many people had made a fortune from stone gambling! Just like that He Ping today! I’m so angry! He took my two million Yuan consultation fee, and in the end, this is his standard ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”forget it!” After tonight, he won’t be able to continue in this line of work ...”

If he had misjudged Xia ruofei’s raw stone before, he could still explain it as a rare accident. However, He Ping had no way of explaining Yu mingdong’s raw stone that was later taken over by fatty Luo. He had strongly suggested Yu mingdong to bid for it at a high price.

There were so many Jade merchants present tonight. He Ping would probably receive the news of the raw stone being cut into pieces soon. He just didn’t know if he would vomit three liters of blood ...
