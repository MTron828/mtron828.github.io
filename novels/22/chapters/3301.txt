Xia ruofei’s brain was working at full speed. He had to kill at least six puppets in the short amount of time left. These puppets were all moving. Especially after he successfully attacked three puppets, the other puppets ‘speed suddenly increased a lot and they were all rushing towards the location of the attack.

Xia ruofei had to take some risks. He had to take advantage of this time to attack from the side and try to kill a few more puppets. Otherwise, he would not have enough time when the commotion died down.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei knew that the original infant stage puppet would soon realize that the painting was missing. By then, he did not know what would happen.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s strategy became more aggressive. He did not wait patiently for the right moment like before. Instead, he went to meet the three puppets who were coming in a group.

He had a map of the entire town in his perceptual mirror. In addition, Xia ruofei was using his spiritual power to investigate the situation in the area. He had already grasped the winter of each puppet.

Now, Xia ruofei’s brain was like a high – speed computer. He had simulated all the possible routes that the puppets might have taken and finally chose the less risky plan, which was to face the three puppets.

After all, each puppet’s route was uncertain. The alleys in the mini town were interconnected so there were many possibilities. However, according to Xia ruofei’s calculations, there was a 70% chance that he could find an opening to face these three puppets without being affected by the other puppets.

Moreover, according to his estimation, he should have about half a minute. As long as he could get rid of these three puppets in half a minute, he would have time to escape.

A 70% chance was not low. Besides, the other puppets were harder to deal with. Hence, Xia ruofei did not hesitate and went straight for the three puppets.

The three puppets all had the appearance of children. However, the strength of a puppet had nothing to do with its appearance. Although these three child puppets had braids that faced the sky and had an innocent expression on their faces, their strength was not bad at all.

Among the three puppets, one was at the advanced stage of the Golden core realm and the other two were at the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm. If Xia ruofei wanted to eat them all at once, he would need to put in some effort. Moreover, he only had half a minute to unleash his full power.

Xia ruofei quietly approached the three puppets, but they still did not notice the pattern of the puppets ‘low perception ability, which was vividly displayed on the three puppets.

The flying sword flew out without a sound. Xia ruofei’s figure was like a ghost, emerging from the shadows.

Although he was determined to fight to the death this time, he still chose to win by surprise.

The blue immortal sword and the qushuang flying sword both attacked the late Aurous core stage puppet.

Xia ruofei also used the floating steps and attacked the late – Stage golden core puppet.

Xia ruofei’s idea was simple. He wanted to focus all his attacks on the strongest puppet among the three of them. He hoped to defeat it with one strike. As long as this late – Stage golden core puppet was killed, the remaining two intermediate – Stage golden core puppets would not be a problem.

The three child – like puppets were still very vigilant. As soon as the two flying swords appeared, they immediately began to Dodge. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, Xia ruofei’s angle of attack was very tricky. The two flying swords were feints. The real killing move was Xia ruofei’s own palms.

These three puppets were quite organized. When they were attacked, they immediately dodged separately. However, all of Xia ruofei’s attacks were focused on the late golden core puppet. After the other two puppets dodged, he had more room to display his skills.

The late Jindan stage puppet had just sent the blue immortal sword flying with the iron rod in his hand when the qushuang flying sword was already in front of him. He hurriedly fell to the ground and avoided the attack in a very embarrassing way.

At this time, the blue travel immortal sword had stabilized again and continued to stab at the puppet. The puppet had lost its opportunity and could only roll on the ground, barely avoiding the fierce attack.

However, at this moment, Xia ruofei’s real killing blow had already been launched.

From the corner of his eyes, the puppet saw a pair of palms rapidly growing in his field of vision. He revealed an inexplicable look of horror, but it was too late to Dodge.

With a “PU Chi” sound, the puppet’s head was crushed by Xia ruofei’s full – Power Strike. The puppet did not even make a sound before it fell to the ground and died.

The other two puppets of the intermediate golden core stage were both shocked and furious. They shouted and pounced on Xia ruofei from both sides.

Xia ruofei faced the two puppets with the strength of the intermediate stage of the Golden core realm without any fear.

One of the puppets with braids was holding two metal cudgels in his hands. He swung them towards Xia ruofei’s head with a terrifying momentum.

Xia ruofei used the graceful steps and dodged his attack. Then, he turned around and attacked another puppet.

At the same time, the blue immortal sword and the qushuang flying sword stabbed toward the back of the puppet’s head under his control.

The puppet had just witnessed its companion’s head being smashed by Xia ruofei, so it did not dare to relax at all. When it heard the sound of the wind behind its head, it quickly dodged.

But this time, the qushuang flying sword and the blue immortal sword were still feints.
