Chapter 610: Chapter 450 – surpassing (3)

After having a simple dinner at Niu Yusheng’s house, Xia ruofei and the other two drove back.

Ye Lingyun took on the role of the driver while Xia ruofei sat in the passenger’s seat. The wide and comfortable single leather seat in the back seat was naturally left to li Zhifu.

Night slowly fell.

Knight XV was speeding on the highway and got off at the West exit of Sanshan mountain at about 8:30 in the evening.

However, ye Lingyun did not drive towards the city.

During the day, Xia ruofei had contacted manager Lu again to confirm. Manager Lu said that the chief had given instructions for li Zhifu to send him directly to guling courtyard when he reached the three mountains.

After ye Lingyun drove out of the toll station, he took the winding highway to the foot of guling. Then, he went up the mountain road and arrived at guling courtyard at around nineo’ clock.

Manager Lu had already informed them of Xia ruofei’s car plate number. Along the way, the sentries let the Knight XV through. Of course, the news of their arrival in guling was also passed back by the sentries.

When the car stopped in front of the building where elder song lived, Xia ruofei’s sharp eyes saw that elder song was waiting in front of the building under the streetlight. Manager Lu was standing beside him.

Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun quickly jumped off the car and helped li Zhifu down.

At this moment, elder song had already walked over with quick steps. His voice was filled with joy,”Brother Fu! You’ve come ...”

“Song, why did you come down personally?” Li Zhifu said,”your identity is different now. This is not appropriate ...”

“What’s inappropriate about that? In front of brother Fu, I will always be that little company commander song!” Elder song laughed and said,”brother Fu, the wind is strong in the mountains. Let’s go in and talk!”

......

Xia ruofei and ye Lingyun carried li Zhifu’s luggage and walked into the building.

When they arrived at the reception room, everyone took their seats, and the female attendant immediately served tea for everyone.

Elder song smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Little Xia, thank you for your hard work this time!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Chief, it’s not hard.”

Then, Xia ruofei reported,”chief, I’ve done a preliminary examination on old Mr. Li at Mount Wuyi. He’s recovering very well. However, in terms of physical examination, Western Medicine’s data is more objective and clear. Therefore, I suggest that we arrange for a thorough examination for old Mr. Li as soon as possible.”

“Good, good, good! Little Xia, thank you so much!” Elder song said, pleased.

“You’re too polite. ” Xia ruofei said,”Oh right, I went to Yan Xiaodong’s grave this time to take a look. The grave of the martyr has been renovated. It was personally completed by Ling Yun and his men.”

Xia ruofei pointed at ye Lingyun.

“Xiao Ye, it’s been hard on you!” Eccentric song said with a smile.

“You’re welcome, chief!” Ye linyun quickly stood up and said,”it’s nothing!”

Xia ruofei then took out his tablet and showed elder song the photos he had imported from the camera.

Elder song looked at the photos carefully. He was very satisfied with Xia ruofei’s work.

After looking at the photo, Xia ruofei took out two small boxes of the best quality Da Hong Pao Kasaya. The tea he gave li Zhifu was also two taels. He didn’t even warm ye Lingyun’s one tael before li Zhifu got it. Hence, he couldn’t be biased towards elder song. He also prepared two taels of tea.

According to the standard of the mother tree, Da Hong Pao, these two taels of tea leaves would be worth a million!

“Chief, I got some really good tea leaves this time. I brought some for you to try ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
