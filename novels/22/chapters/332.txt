“I’ll pay!” Lu You smiled and said,”I’ll compensate you with a beautiful woman! What do you think of Yueyue?” Xia ruofei immediately felt very embarrassed. He also heard Jiang Yue shyly stopping Lu You from speaking. “Stop fooling around ...” Xia ruofei laughed awkwardly.”People aren’t goods. Do you think they can be exchanged for something of equal value?” “Gutless!” Lu You said in disdain. “Then ... What do you need my help with?” Xia ruofei asked,”you should at least let me know in advance!” “I’m driving! I’ll let Yueyue tell you. ” Lu You said. Xia ruofei heard Jiang Yue’s nervous voice. After a long while, Jiang Yue’s timid voice could be heard,””Brother Xia ...” “Jiang Yue, what is it that you want me to go to school tomorrow?” Xia ruofei tried to speak as gently as possible. Facing this timid and shy girl, Xia ruofei couldn’t bring himself to be ruthless. “We ... Youyou, I, and a few other classmates have some problems with the orchids that we’ve been cultivating together.” Jiang Yue replied,”sister Qingxue said that you’re very good at plant cultivation and that you’ve even managed to grow some beautiful succulent plants in the past. So, she suggested that you help her take a look.” “Orchid?” Xia ruofei was also stunned.”But I’ve never raised orchids before!” “Is that so ...” Jiang Yue appeared a little disappointed.”Forget it then, big brother Xia. How about ... I don’t bother you anymore ...” Xia ruofei thought for a while and asked,”Jiang Yue, is this pot of orchids very important to you?” Did you get someone to help you check it?” “I’ve asked a gardening teacher to come over to take a look, but the problem hasn’t been solved. In fact, it seems to be getting worse.” Jiang Yue said,”but it’s okay. This is not important. Brother Xia, we’ll think of another way!” At this moment, Xia ruofei heard Lu You, who was driving beside Jiang Yue, say,””How can it not be important? This plant was going to participate in the southeast province University flower exhibition! This is the exhibit that our gardening club is focusing on cultivating. If the problem is not solved, how are we going to participate in the exhibition?” “Youyou, we’ll think of another way ...” Jiang Yue said hurriedly,”big brother Xia, it’s really okay ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Jiang Yue, since I’m free tomorrow, I’ll come and help you guys take a look!” But as I said just now, I’ve never raised orchids before, so I’m not sure if I can help. You’d better not have too much hope. ” “Good! Thank you, brother Xia! “I’ll have to trouble you then ...”Jiang Yue quickly said. When she heard that Xia ruofei would be there the next day, her heart was filled with joy. Xia ruofei hung up the phone and threw it on the bed. Then, he let out a long sigh and fell back on the bed, staring at the White ceiling in a daze. It was dinner time when ye Lingyun came to knock on the door. He got up from the bed, went to the bathroom to wash up, and went downstairs for dinner. During the meal, ye Lingyun and Li Zhifu didn’t ask about what happened that day. Instead, they talked about the production of tea leaves. Xia ruofei was curious as well. He realized that ye Lingyun was able to chat with li Zhifu freely now. From time to time, terms that he had never heard before would come out of his mouth. “Ling Yun, it seems like you’ve gained a lot today!” Xia ruofei laughed. How was it? Did you get into the house?” “It’s still early!”Said li Zhifu. Just these theoretical things were enough for Xiao Ye to learn for a long time! And our tea – making skills are all based on practice, just like how you shoot targets in the Army. Sharpshooters are trained by bullets!” “Mr. Li, how should Ling Yun practice?” Xia ruofei asked curiously. We don’t have any Tea Green here!” “There’s no hurry. Let’s first remember everything that needs to be remembered.” Li Zhifu said confidently,”when I can practice, I will have a way.” “Alright! It seems that you, the teacher, have already prepared the teaching case. ” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”old Mr. Li, what do you think? This student of Ling Yun’s not bad, right?” “It’s passable!” Li Zhifu said,”his learning attitude is still very good, and his comprehension is also not bad. However, whether he really succeeds or not, it will still depend on his practice in the future!” “It’ll definitely work!” Xia ruofei replied,”I have confidence in Ling Yun! Even such a difficult subject in the field troops could not stump him! There’s definitely no problem with tea!” Ye Lingyun chuckled when he heard that. He saw that li Zhifu had finished his bowl of rice, so he quickly got up to bring him more. After a day, he had the awareness of being a student. After dinner, Xia ruofei still felt a little depressed, so he brought lightning to the farm for a walk. First, he went to the orchard at the back of the mountain. The lychee trees that he had planted a few days ago had all survived, and they were all growing more energetic. Xia ruofei arrived at the water tower at the top of the mountain. He looked around carefully to make sure that no one was spying on them. Then, he took out a small bottle of diluted flower petal solution and added it to the pool. Then, Xia ruofei brought lightning down the mountain. They strolled from the vegetable greenhouse to the construction site where they were still working overtime. They strolled around the entire farm before sitting on a stone bench by the side of the road. He took out a cigarette and lit it. In the quiet farm, Xia ruofei sat alone on the stone bench. Lightning was lying quietly by his feet. The street lamp not far away cast a long shadow on the lamp post. It was a quiet scene.
