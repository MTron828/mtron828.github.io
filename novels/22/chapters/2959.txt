2960 The auction of the Qi gathering elixir (1)

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be impatient, sect master Zhao. Good food is never afraid of being late!‚ÄùHao Qingsong laughed.

‚ÄúAccording to the request of the fellow Daoist who entrusted the auction, and also considering that some fellow Daoists are a little short of money or want to bid for other treasures, these five bottles of Chi ‚Äì amassing pills will be auctioned off in five batches. Each batch will have one bottle, and each bottle will have twenty pills. This way, more fellow Daoists can participate and help more people.‚Äù

The auction plan that Hao Qingsong had announced had received the support of quite a few cultivators.

It was not that they did not have enough spirit stones, but that before attending the auction, they usually had treasures that they were interested in and had already prepared their spirit stones to buy them. However, the Qi gathering elixir was extremely attractive. As the saying went, plans could not keep up with changes. It would be a pity if they gave up. The plan to auction separately was exactly what they wanted. They would have the opportunity to buy such a high ‚Äì Quality Qi gathering pill, and it would not take up too much money. It was the best of both worlds.

‚ÄúThe starting price for each bottle of Chi ‚Äì amassing pills is 1600 spirit stones, and each increment must be no less than 40 spirit stones!‚Äù Fellow Daoists, you should already know the rules of the auction and how to use the auction item, right? If there‚Äôs no problem, we‚Äôll start the auction for the first bottle of Qi gathering pills!‚Äù

There were 20 Chi ‚Äì amassing pills in each bottle. The starting price was 1600 spirit stones, which was equivalent to 80 spirit stones for each Chi ‚Äì amassing pill. This price was higher than Xia ruofei had expected. Luo Qingfeng had set this starting price when he went to communicate with the falling leaves sect in the morning. Xia ruofei had also agreed to it.

Hao Qingsong waited for a while, and seeing that no one had any objections, he announced,‚ÄùGood! Now, the auction for the first bottle of Qi gathering pills will begin! The auction channel has already opened. Interested fellow Daoists can directly place their bids on the auction device!‚Äù

The staff member backstage was also a Fallen Leaf sect disciple, and had some knowledge of computers. He had already set the price increase to 100 spirit stones in the system‚Äôs backstage. As soon as Hao Qingsong announced the start of the auction, the staff member opened up the auction channel, so that the cultivators in each private room could directly bid on the auction device.

As soon as Hao Qingsong‚Äôs voice fell, the price of 1600 spirit stones on the big screen suddenly jumped to 2000 spirit stones. Moreover, the bidder was from Room 3.

Xia ruofei couldn‚Äôt help but be stunned. Like the other cultivators, he subconsciously looked in the direction of Room 3. Just now, sun Tianfeng didn‚Äôt hide his identity, so everyone already knew that Room 3 belonged to the valley of the medicine Masters.

Xia ruofei did not expect that the valley of the medicine Masters would be interested in his Chi ‚Äì amassing pills. They even increased the price by 400 spirit stones all of a sudden. This price was equivalent to 100 spirit stones for each Chi ‚Äì amassing pill. It was already the base price that Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng had decided on when they were discussing yesterday.

As soon as the price was announced, everyone was caught off guard. Some cultivators who were prepared to raise the price a few times to try moved their hands away from the bidding device.

At this time, sun Tianfeng‚Äôs hearty laughter came from the third private room,‚Äù‚ÄùFellow Daoists, such a high ‚Äì Quality Qi gathering pill is very rare, and this old man is also very excited to see it! Therefore, he wanted to buy a bottle and study it. Everyone, there‚Äôs no need to worry so much. We‚Äôll increase the price when it‚Äôs necessary, it‚Äôs a fair competition!‚Äù

All the cultivators were speechless when they heard this. People bought Qi gathering pills for the younger generation to assist in their cultivation, but Medicine King‚Äôs Valley was really rich! He would just buy a bottle for research ...

However, although sun Tianfeng said that everyone would compete fairly, now that the number three box was already open, and the strength of Medicine King‚Äôs Valley was there, and sun Tianfeng was even more highly respected, alchemists and alchemists were very popular these days, who could be sure that they wouldn‚Äôt come to Medicine King‚Äôs Valley? And even if sun Tianfeng bought this bottle, weren‚Äôt there still four more bottles? Why offend sun Tianfeng and the valley of medicine Masters for a bottle of Qi gathering pills?

Moreover, the price of 2000 spirit stones was not low. A few years ago, the Qi ‚Äì gathering elixir that had appeared in the auction was only sold for 60 spirit stones each. This 2000 spirit stones was equivalent to 1000 spirit stones each. Even if this batch of Qi ‚Äì gathering elixir was of higher quality, everyone felt that this price should be more reasonable.

In that case, why take the risk of offending Medicine King‚Äôs Valley to compete for this bottle? DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

Everyone had this idea. Even the top sects who were on par with Medicine King‚Äôs Valley in strength did not want to make enemies for no reason over such a small matter.

As a result, a very strange situation occurred in the first round of bidding. Hao Qingsong announced the start of the bidding. In total, sun Tianfeng had made a bid once, and after that, no one else made any more bids. The price of 2000 spirit stones was displayed there without moving.

Hao Qingsong also didn‚Äôt expect that sun Tianfeng would play his Cards Against common sense, causing an awkward silence in the first round of bidding.

Fortunately, his ability to adapt was still relatively strong, and he did not show it on his face. Instead, after waiting for a while, he asked three more times if anyone wanted to raise the bid. Seeing that no one wanted to continue bidding, Hao Qingsong could only smile bitterly in his heart and directly announced the end of the first round of bidding. Medicine King‚Äôs Valley had won a bottle of Chi ‚Äì amassing pills for a price of two thousand spirit stones.

‚ÄúFellow Daoists, you‚Äôre really giving me too much face!‚Äù Sun Tianfeng said in a clear voice. This old man is grateful!‚Äù

‚ÄúCongratulations to Medicine King‚Äôs Valley‚Äôs elder sun for winning a good start!‚Äù Hao Qingsong said with a smile.

After saying that, he gestured for the staff to come up and take a bottle of Qi gathering pills. The rules of the auction were very simple. As long as the auction was successful, the staff would send the auction item directly to the private room and the spirit stones would be settled on the spot. The person who entrusted the auction would also receive the Spirit stones immediately.

Of course, the client could also choose to wait for all of his items to be successfully bid for, and then settle the payment in one go.

This was the plan that Xia ruofei had chosen. Anyway, his three items would appear before the storage ring. When all three items were sold out, he would get the spiritual stones back at once. Then, he could use them to compete for the storage ring without any delay.

In room 20, Xia ruofei, Luo Qingfeng, and Li Yifu looked at each other. Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry. He did not expect such a situation to occur in the first bottle of gathering Qi pill.

However, he was in a good mood. He was neither angry nor depressed because of this. After all, 2000 spiritual stones was a reasonable price. If the other party had really made a starting price and then forcefully revealed his identity so that no one would dare to bid, Xia ruofei would definitely not give in. At most, he would take the initiative to raise the price. After all, he could not sell the gathering Qi pill at a lower price than he had expected.

In any case, even if he bought it for 2000 spiritual stones, according to the rules, he would only be paid 100 spiritual stones to the falling leaves sect. Xia ruofei did not care about this.

Xia ruofei was not afraid of the other party‚Äôs revenge.

The star Seizer sect was a first ‚Äì Class sect. Ordinary forces would not dare to provoke them. Furthermore, the worst case scenario was that they would have to escape back to peach source Island. With the Taixu xuanqing formation, Xia ruofei would not have to worry about anything unless the entire cultivation world of Huaxia attacked him together, or even a nascent soul old monster came out.

Although sun Tianfeng had revealed his identity, he had only gone there to help with the medicine testing and had offered a reasonable price. Hence, Xia ruofei had only laughed it off and did not mind it too much.

Very quickly, on the main auction stage, Hao Qingsong took out another bottle of gathering Qi pills and smiled,‚ÄùFellow Daoists, let‚Äôs continue. The auction for the second bottle of Chi ‚Äì amassing pills will begin immediately. The starting price is still 1600 spirit stones, and each increment must not be less than 40 spirit stones!‚Äù

After the auction for the second bottle of Qi gathering pills began, a new price quickly appeared on the big screen: It was 1640 spiritual stones, and it only stayed there for a second or two before it was replaced by 1680 spiritual stones.

On the stage, Hao Qingsong and Xia ruofei in the private room simultaneously heaved a sigh of relief. The auction had finally returned to the normal track.

The price on the big screen kept rising and changing quickly. It was obvious that there were many people participating in the bidding, and everyone was very interested in the Qi gathering pill.

After a short while, the price on the big screen had reached 1880 spirit stones.

In Room 6, Liu Mansha still did not make a bid. Yu xiner could not help but feel a little anxious. However, she did not dare to rush her master. She could only watch the price jump continuously on the screen with a slightly anxious gaze.

When the elder of the flying flower Valley, Yang Liu, saw this, he chuckled and said,‚Äù‚ÄùXiner, don‚Äôt be anxious! The price is still too low, let them fight for a while!‚Äù

Yu Xin ‚Äòer blushed and said in a low voice,‚Äù‚ÄùThis disciple understands.‚Äù

Liu Mansha turned to look at Yu xiner. The corners of her lips curled up as she said,‚Äù‚ÄùXin ‚Äòer, your martial uncle yang is right. You ... Your temperament is not steady enough. This is a great taboo for cultivation! Take a look at those people who bid, which private rooms are they in? The people who are truly competitive haven‚Äôt even made their move yet!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Yu Xin ‚Äòer lowered her head and said.

After all, Yu xiner had only cultivated for a short period of time and had not entered the valley to cultivate since she was young. In reality, Yu xiner had always grown up in the secular world. It was only after she went to university that Liu Mansha discovered her outstanding cultivation talent by chance and took her in as a disciple.

Therefore, Yu Xin ‚Äòer‚Äôs temperament was still a little bit different from those senior sisters who had been cultivating in the flying flower Valley since they were young.

While they were talking, the price on the big screen had already risen to 2000 spirit stones. After this price, the speed of the bidding slowed down.

With sun Tianfeng‚Äôs first bid as a reference, after everyone had reached this price, the bidding was naturally not as enthusiastic.

Besides, some people felt that even if they couldn‚Äôt buy this bottle, there were still three more bottles. Why fight to the death?

In fact, Xia ruofei had caught on to everyone‚Äôs mentality. By auctioning off the bottles one by one, the more nervous they were, the higher the price would be.

Seeing this, Liu Mansha said indifferently, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost time, let‚Äôs go and compete!‚Äù

After Liu Mansha finished speaking, she directly entered the number 2200 into the bidding device and submitted her bid.

The price on the big screen flashed and was updated to 2200 spirit stones. The bidder was from Room 6.

Although they didn‚Äôt know which sect room number 6 belonged to, the number of rooms that were so close to the front were usually those large sects. Therefore, some cultivators who were already hesitating whether to continue bidding gave up when they saw the price suddenly rise by 200 spirit stones.
