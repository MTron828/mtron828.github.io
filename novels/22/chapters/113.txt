The villagers quickly finished registering, and about 30 to 40 people had applied for the job. Xia ruofei took the stack of information and said,””Everyone, please wait outside for a moment. Those whose names are called, please enter. I have a few simple questions to ask.” “Boss Xia, is this the interview that everyone is talking about?” A villager asked. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”almost!” I just want to know how everyone is doing. ” With that, Xia ruofei gestured to ruan Fugui and the two of them walked into the village council. The villagers were waiting nervously at the door. Xia ruofei’s offer was so good that everyone naturally wanted to get hired. Actually, Xia ruofei avoided the crowd mainly because he wanted to hear ruan Fugui’s advice. After being the party secretary for so many years, ruan Fugui knew the villagers very well and would definitely understand the situation the best. He could not say anything in front of the villagers, but he would not offend anyone if he said it in the village committee. Xia ruofei directly asked ruan Fugui to help him choose first. First of all, he would not want people with bad conduct. Xia ruofei would also not consider those who liked to play tricks and did not put in much effort. In addition, those with special skills in certain areas would be given priority. The last time they had rented the land, ruan Fugui already knew that Xia ruofei had a powerful background. Later on, Xia ruofei had even brought them to eat at the West River Moon Club, which had broadened his horizons. Thus, he didn’t dare to hide anything from Xia ruofei. The preliminary screening was completed very quickly. Then, Xia ruofei called the villagers in for an “interview” one by one. It was nothing more than to ask about their personal situation, how old they were, how many people were in their family, and what their specialties were. The interview process was completed quickly. With ruan Fugui’s opinion, Xia ruofei decided on the list of 15 people. He walked out of the village council with the name list and announced the results of the recruitment to the villagers. The villagers who were chosen were naturally overjoyed, while those who were not were somewhat disappointed. Xia ruofei smiled.”Don’t be discouraged. Our farm will continue to expand production in the future. When we need to recruit workers in the future, we will give priority to our Dongkeng village. I hope that everyone will be enthusiastic about applying.” Under the envious gazes of the villagers, the 15 villagers who had been chosen stayed behind, while the others gradually dispersed. Xia ruofei smiled and said,”alright, everyone is now my employee at Taoyuan farm. Tomorrow, everyone will go to the farm to sign the employment contract. Then, you can officially start work!” Hmm...I’ll start to pay you today!” “Boss, let’s go work today! I heard from Secretary ruan that your farm is in the middle of construction, so you’ll definitely need manpower. ” One of the villagers rubbed his hands and laughed.”We don’t feel good if we don’t work and get paid!” Xia ruofei’s new employees all agreed. These villagers were really simple. Their simple concept was to get paid according to work. Since the salary was calculated today, they had to work for the boss today. Otherwise, they wouldn’t take the reward for no work. Xia ruofei laughed,”there’s a construction team for construction!” Everyone, go back and settle your family matters today. You can come back tomorrow to sign the contract!” “This ... Alright, thank you, boss!” The new employees went home happily. Xia ruofei expressed his gratitude to ruan Fugui and drove away from the village committee. After returning to the villa, Xia ruofei gave Ling Qingxue a call and asked her to send him a copy of the employment contract for lingji F & B. Then, he made some changes based on the actual situation of Tao Yuan farm and printed 15 copies. After she was done, Xia ruofei saw that there was nothing else to do so she picked up her phone and gave pang Hao a call. “RUO Fei!” “Little fatty, did you guys have fun last night?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “Very good! President Zheng later got someone to send over a lot of fruit platters and snacks. ” Pang Hao said,”you’re the one who ran away at the last minute. The ladies in the class expressed strong indignation and requested that you treat us next time to make up for it.” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”sure!” No problem!” “Oh right, Lil ‘fatty,” he asked,”there were so many people yesterday, so it wasn’t convenient for me to ask you. What’s your job now?” “What good job can a third – rate University Graduate like me have?” pang Hao smiled bitterly. I’ve been working as a salesman in an insurance company for the past two years!” “How’s the treatment?” Xia ruofei asked. “The base salary is so low that it’s outrageous. I can only barely make a living by relying on business commissions.” Pang Hao said,”that’s why I have to run the business as hard as I can ... Sigh! Anyway, let’s just mix around first!” Xia ruofei teased,”little fatty, you sound like you’re living in deep water and fire!” However, I’m very curious about the fact that you can still maintain such a chubby body despite the pressure of life. This little brother really admires you!” “Your sister!” Pang Hao laughed and scolded,”you’re rubbing it in, aren’t you?” “Haha ...” Xia ruofei laughed happily. Then, he asked,”seriously, what are your plans for the future?” “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have any thoughts. ” Pang Hao said,”I kind of regret playing games all day long when I was in college and neglecting my studies. Although the school is average, many of my hardworking classmates are doing well. ” Pang Hao paused for a moment before continuing.”I majored in finance in University, so I’m studying now. I’m preparing to get an accountant’s certificate. I’m thinking of changing my career in the future if I have the chance.” “What future are you waiting for? Come to my company!” Xia ruofei said directly,”you’re just in time for finance. I’m lacking an accountant! When the company’s structure is ready, you’ll be the financial director!” “Ah? RUO Fei, you’re not joking, right?” Pang Hao asked hesitantly, unable to react in time. “Little fatty, can I joke about this?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”being the Finance Director of paradise Corporation is better than being an insurance agent, right?” Xia ruofei had called pang Hao with the intention of recruiting him. That was why he wanted to know about pang Hao’s current situation. If pang Hao was doing well, Xia ruofei would not have mentioned it. However, since pang Hao was not satisfied with his current situation, Xia ruofei decided to pull him in without any hesitation. When Xia ruofei used people, ability was one thing, but he valued character more. Pang Hao had been his good brother in junior high. After getting to know him the day before, he knew that the little Fatty’s character was still the same as it had been in the past. He had not changed at all. He could be said to be from the bottom of society, but in order to stand up for Xia ruofei, he did not hesitate to go against Liu Hang, the son of a government official. This was also an important reason why Xia ruofei trusted him. Pang Hao naturally knew the name of the Paradise Corporation by now. He said,””Of course I’m happy. But ruofei ... I haven’t even passed the accountant’s exam yet. If I go to your company ...” “You can take your time to learn if you’re not familiar with the business. Besides, aren’t you already preparing for the exam?” Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”it doesn’t matter to me whether I have a certificate or not. The key is that an important position like finance must be filled by a brother that I can trust!” Pang Hao was also very touched when he heard this. He immediately said,””Alright! Ruofei, just because of what you said, I’ll resign in a while! Don’t worry, I’ll make sure everything is in order. If there’s any mistake, you’ll fire me immediately!” “It’s not that serious ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”Okay, I won’t say more. I’ll send you the location on WeChat later. Come over first thing in the morning!” “Alright, see you tomorrow!” …… The next morning, ye Lingyun went straight to the construction site. The security equipment he ordered had arrived that day, and he was going to get busy. After Xia ruofei sent the two vegetable trucks away, he saw pang Hao and the 15 new employees who had been recruited yesterday arriving at the villa almost at the same time. “Good Morning, boss!” “Hello, boss Xia!” The new employees all greeted Xia ruofei and looked around from time to time. They were very surprised by the modern farm. Xia ruofei smiled and greeted them. Then, he walked over to pang Hao and said,””Little fatty, you’re early!” “The opportunity to make a meteoric rise is right in front of us,” pang Hao said with a chuckle.”How could it not come early?” “You brat!” Xia ruofei lightly punched pang Hao’s chest and said,”wait for a moment. I have to deal with some things.” “Alright!” Xia ruofei asked pang Hao to bring a small table to the courtyard from the living room. Then, he took out the contract that he had printed in advance. Some of the new employees were literate. Although they couldn’t fully understand the contract, they could still understand the benefits and treatment. Therefore, everyone quickly signed the contract and pressed their thumbprints. Xia ruofei also signed and stamped the contract with his company’s seal. This employment contract was officially in effect. Initially, Xia ruofei wanted to give the new employees a few more days off. After all, there was still some work to be done on the farm. A few days ‘worth of salary was nothing to him. However, these simple fishermen and farmers didn’t do anything. In their minds, they were paid to do things. Xia ruofei had no choice but to let them help out at the construction site. This way, they could more or less improve their work efficiency. After handing the new employees over to manager li, who was supervising the construction site, Xia ruofei handed all the things from the company’s finance department, including the account details, the finance seal, and bank transfers to pang Hao. At this stage, pang Hao’s job was to properly organize the finances of paradise Corporation, including creating a payroll for new employees and settling the construction funds with the construction party in stages. The settlement of lingji food and drink and Xijiang Moon Club should also be gradually changed to public to public transfers. This was enough to keep pang Hao busy for a while. Xia ruofei decided to give him five thousand Yuan to buy a decent desktop in the city. Then, he would let pang Hao use the other guest room on the first floor as the finance department’s office. Just like that, everyone was busy with their own things, but Xia ruofei had a lot of free time. On the morning of the third day, Xia ruofei was playing with lightning in the villa’s courtyard when ye Lingyun suddenly appeared at the door and said,””Brother Xia, there are two cars over there. They seem to be looking for you.” “Oh?” Xia ruofei stood up and walked out of the mansion. Ye Lingyun followed closely behind him. In the distance, a black Mercedes – Benz and a silver Mercedes – Benz business car drove over one after another. The car drove straight to the entrance of the courtyard. The door of the Mercedes – Benz opened, and a few capable young Men in Black suits quickly got out of the car. Xia ruofei could tell at a glance that these Men in Black suits were very agile and were definitely trained. He couldn’t help but frown. However, when the electric door of the MPV slowly opened with two beeps, Xia ruofei’s brows immediately relaxed. This was because he saw Tian Huixin carrying Huan Huan and getting out of the car first, followed by Ma Zhiming. Lu You also came out of the car. When Huan Huan saw Xia ruofei from afar, she immediately broke free from Tian Huixin’s arms and ran towards Xia ruofei with a happy and innocent smile ...
