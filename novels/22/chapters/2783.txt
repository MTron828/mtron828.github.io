2784 The Army and the Prince (1)

“President Xia, you’ve come all the way here to play for the team. I thank you on behalf of the club!” Zhou leiyun chuckled and said,”let’s toast the first glass to CEO Xia!”

With that, Zhou leiyun raised his glass first.

Jiang Xiaochen was sitting beside Ruby and his wife, acting as their translator at the banquet, so both of them raised their glasses with the others at the first moment.

Xia ruofei raised his glass and said with a smile,””You’re being too polite. I’m also a member of the club. How about this! The first glass of wine is to wish us a good result this weekend! It’s best if you can defeat balsa!”

Everyone laughed out loud when they heard this. Facing a powerful mortal enemy from the same city, everyone naturally shared the same hatred.

As there was a competition in three days, Xia ruofei and Wu Lei were both participating. Hence, they were drinking fruit juice, while Zhou leiyun and the others were only drinking low – alcohol fruit wine. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course, Xia ruofei’s body would not be affected by alcohol. He did not have to be like the professional players who had to strictly control their diet to maintain their physical condition. However, he didn’t want to set a bad example for Wu Lei, so he gladly accepted the arrangement of drinking fruit juice.

Xia ruofei took the initiative to toast everyone, and then they toasted each other. Xia ruofei also went to have a drink with Ruby and his wife. He talked to Ruby about the team’s recent situation and expressed his appreciation for Ruby’s work during this period.

Ruby was very excited about Xia ruofei’s return. He held Xia ruofei’s hand and thanked him.

As soon as Xia ruofei returned to his seat, Wu Lei came over with his wife and child to give Xia ruofei a toast.

“Brother Xia, this is my wife, Zhong Xiaobei!” Wu Lei introduced.

“Brother Xia, thank you for taking care of Wu Lei and helping him!” Zhong Xiaobei quickly said.

Wu Lei’s wife had a sweet appearance, but she was very low – Key. She was very friendly and always had a slight smile on her face.

The two of them actually got married quite early. Wu Lei was already married to Zhong Xiaobei when he was 23 years old. It was only after the club that Wu Lei was in won the Chinese Super League title that it was known to the vast number of fans. It turned out that the two of them were already married and had a son and a daughter.

The most famous photo of Wu Lei and Zhong Xiaobei was taken by fans when Wu Lei was playing football in Shen Cheng. At that time, China’s League had already entered the golden era. The players who played in China’s Super League all had a high income. Online posts exposing players driving luxury cars were everywhere. Wu Lei, as a top player in the country with a top salary of ten million dollars, was squeezing in the subway with his girlfriend. It was indeed a clear stream in the football world at that time.

Xia ruofei smiled,”you’re welcome!” He had only done what he could. I even told Lei Zi about it last time! He had to bring his family and children over as soon as possible. Only with a stable home here could he devote himself to training and competition without any worries! It seems like Lei Zi has taken my words seriously! Hahaha!”

Wu Lei was a little embarrassed and said,””It’s all thanks to brother Xia’s help. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to secure my position on the team so quickly, and Xiaobei and the kids wouldn’t have been able to come out and accompany me so quickly. ”

“Hahaha! Don’t tell me that you’re too ashamed to face your wife and children just because you can’t play in the club?” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”nonsense!”

After that, he stood up and clinked his glass with Wu Lei and Zhong Xiaobei. Then, he took a sip of juice from the three people’s glasses. There was no need to drink it all in one go.

The small welcome dinner did not last long. Considering that Xia ruofei and the other two were tired from the long journey, it ended in about an hour. Everyone said their goodbyes and left, and Xia ruofei and the other two returned to their hotel rooms.

The next morning, Xia ruofei and the other two had breakfast at the hotel and then took the commercial car arranged by the club to the club’s training base.

Xia ruofei decided to join the team’s training from today onwards.

Originally, Zhou leiyun had arranged for people to accompany Song Wei and Ling Qingxue on a tour of Barcelona. However, the two of them insisted on visiting the club and watching Xia ruofei and the rest train. Zhou leiyun only had to accommodate the guests.

The hotel that Xia ruofei and the others were staying at was not far from Dani Halk base. It did not take long for the car to enter the gate of the training base.

Although the Spanish club’s training base was not very large, it was small and had all the essentials. All the facilities were very professional, and there was a very professional training team and analysis team. Whether it was the software or hardware facilities, they were better than some of the top clubs in China.

After alighting from the car, Jiang Xiaochen sent a Chinese female assistant to accompany Ling Qingxue and Song Wei on the tour, while Xia ruofei went straight to the changing room to change into his training uniform.

When he changed his clothes and came to the training ground, he saw that several players had already arrived in advance and were running around the field to warm up.

Among them were the diligent Wu Lei and the core of the team’s middle and backfield, mark Roka, who had competed with Xia ruofei in free kicks last time.

Xia ruofei was surprised to find that the team’s old goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, was also warming up.

Xia ruofei knew that although the goalkeeper was older, he had always been in good competitive form. He could even be said to be the stabilizing force of the Spanish backfield. If he had not repeatedly made God – Level saves, with Spain’s defensive strength, they would not have been in today’s position.
