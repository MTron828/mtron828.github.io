Chapter 618: Doctor Xia makes another move (2)

Xue bi Yun worked hard to bring the child to recover, while working a few jobs to save money, and they managed to survive for several years.

However, Chengcheng’s condition was very serious. His brain had organ – Type lesions, and he would have seizures from time to time, so the effect of rehabilitation training was very weak.

When she found out that Huan Huan had recovered, Xue Biyun’s heart was filled with hope, especially when Tian Huixin had enthusiastically helped her ask for Xia ruofei’s help. She had even gotten his approval. Xue Biyun was even more excited.

However, Xia ruofei had been very busy recently. If Ma Zhiming hadn’t mentioned it again, he wouldn’t have remembered it. So, Xue bi Yun had been waiting in torment all this time.

When Tian Huixin informed her that she could bring Chengcheng back to the three mountains to look for Xia ruofei for treatment, she was really in tears.

Ever since the divorce, Xue bi Yun had never returned to the mainland. She didn’t even have the money for a plane ticket, and she didn’t have the time either. Her family was also in a difficult situation, and she didn’t want her family to worry. Every time she called, she would only tell them the good news and not the bad news.

After a few years, Xue bi Yun’s heart was filled with mixed feelings as she returned to her hometown.

At the same time, he was also worried about the gains and losses. He was afraid that this trip to seek medical treatment would be the same as the countless experiences in the past. He had come full of hope and left in disappointment, but the child’s condition had not improved at all.

When she saw the cute Huanhuan, the conviction in her heart seemed to have strengthened a lot.

Even if he couldn’t be completely cured, it would be fine as long as he could get a little better! Xue bi Yun said to herself in her heart.

Tian Huixin could also see that Xue Biyun was very nervous, so she smiled and said,”Biyun, don’t worry! Xiao Xia’s medical skills are very magical, Chengcheng’s illness will definitely be cured!”

Xue bi Yun’s eyes reddened as she looked at her son, who was squatting on the ground without a word. She nodded and said,”Sister Tian, I’m really grateful to you for this! I really don’t know how to show you guys that you’re helping me ...”

All these years, Tian Huixin had helped Xue Biyun a lot. Even the plane tickets back to the mainland this time were provided by Tian Huixin for free. Xue Biyun’s heart was filled with gratitude.

......

Tian Huixin smiled and said,”Biyun, it’s fate that we met. We’re good sisters. There’s no need to be so formal. Let’s go!” The car is over there ...”

A luxurious Mercedes – Benz business car came to Hengfeng group’s Sanshan office to pick up the young mistress of Qingqing group back to her hometown. They naturally had to do their best to protect her.

The office’s driver took the luggage cart, Xue bi Yun carried Chengcheng, Tian Huixin held Huanhuan’s hand, and everyone got into the car.

“Old Wu, make a call to Hengfeng hotel and book a Business Suite.” Xue bi Yun instructed the chauffeur.

“Alright!” Old Wu quickly said and then started to make a call.

“Sister Tian, there’s no need to book such a good place, just find a hotel!” Xue bi Yun quickly said.

The Hengfeng hotel was a super five – Star hotel. A normal standard room cost a thousand, and a Business Suite cost more than three thousand a day. This was simply too extravagant for Xue bi Yun.

“Biyun, you don’t have to worry about this. I’ll pay for all your expenses at the three mountains!” Tian Huixin said with a smile.

“That’s even more impossible! This hotel is too expensive ...”

Tian Huixin chuckled.”This is our family’s hotel. The office has reserved rooms all year round. It’s not a waste!”

Seeing that Xue Biyun still wanted to decline, Tian Huixin continued,”Xiao Xia is here to treat Chengcheng, how can the environment be too bad? You can’t let Xiao Xia treat Chengcheng in a small hotel on the street!”

Hearing Tian Huixin’s words, Xue bi Yun didn’t decline, but said with red eyes,”Sister Tian, thank you ...”

For the sake of her child, Xue Biyun was willing to do anything. She already owed Tian Huixin a big favor, so she would stay at Hengfeng then! He would just repay her in the future.

After making the reservation, Tian Huixin sent the room number to Xia ruofei.

The Mercedes – Benz business car quickly arrived at the Hengfeng hotel, which was located in the prime location of the city center. Under old Wu’s arrangements, Tian Huixin and the others quickly checked into business Suite 1808.

This suite had a bedroom, a small guest room, and a balcony with a wide view.

Xue bi Yun looked at the luxuriously decorated Business Suite and felt uncomfortable. She didn’t even know where to put her hands.

As Tian Huixin had booked the room, the hotel had even thoughtfully prepared a large fruit platter. There were even some toys and snacks that children liked.

As soon as Chengcheng entered the room, he pounced on those toys. Although the toys in the hotel were all Barbie dolls and plush bears that girls liked, Chengcheng also liked plush toys very much. Once he went over, he would hug a pink plush bear and directly lie on the carpet, playing with it very happily.

“Chengcheng, be careful, don’t dirty the toy ...” Xue bi Yun quickly called out.

Tian Huixin smiled and said,”it’s fine, Biyun. Let Chengcheng play!” It’s good that the child likes it ... You should sit too! Don’t be nervous, when Xiao Xia comes, you can tell him about Chengcheng’s condition, he will definitely have a solution!”

“En!” Xue bi Yun nodded heavily.

In fact, at the beginning, Xue Biyun was the same as Tian Huixin. She didn’t believe that anyone in the world could treat the autism spectrum disorder. Until now, it was a worldwide problem. There were no effective drugs at all, and they could only rely on some rehabilitation training to correct the child’s behavior.

However, Huanhuan’s recovery was a fact that could not be doubted.

Tian Huixin sat on the sofa and chatted with Xue Biyun. Huan Huan ran over to play with Chengcheng, but Chengcheng acted as if no one was around. No matter what Huan Huan said to him, he turned a deaf ear. He only played with the teddy bear in his hands, and sometimes he would even make some meaningless syllables.

Xue bi Yun’s eyes would occasionally sweep over the two clearly different children, and she couldn’t help but sigh in her heart.

After about half an hour, the doorbell rang.

Xue bi Yun immediately stood up. Tian Hui Xin smiled and said,”It should be Xiao Xia. I’ll go get the door!”

Tian Huixin quickly went to open the door. It was Xia ruofei, dressed in casual clothes.

“Little Xia is here! Hurry up and enter the house!” Tian Huixin greeted him warmly.

“Madam Tian, have your friends settled down?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile as he walked in.

“Mm! The mother and son will be living here for the next few days. ” Tian Huixin said. Then, she smiled and said,”Xiao Xia, it’s a little awkward for you to Call Me Madam Tian. Why don’t you call me Auntie like Youyou?”

“As long as you don’t mind me calling you old!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Hey! I’m already old! Why would I dislike it?” Tian Huixin said with a smile.

“Alright, I’ll call you aunt Huixin then!” Xia ruofei said. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Good, good, good, you’re so friendly!”

As they spoke, the two of them entered the house. Xue bi Yun’s hands unconsciously clutched the hem of her clothes, her expression somewhat nervous and apprehensive.

Tian Huixin smiled and said,”ruofei, let me introduce you. This is my best friend, Xue Biyun.””I’ll introduce her to you.” Biyun, this is the doctor Who cured our Huanhuan, Xia ruofei!”

“Hello, doctor Xia! “I’ll have to trouble you ...”Xue bi Yun quickly called out.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Aunt Xue, you’re welcome. I promised aunt Huixin a long time ago that I’d treat your child. However, I’ve been very busy recently, so I’ve delayed it until now. I’m sorry!”

Although Xue Biyun looked a little old, she was only 35 or 36 years old. Xia ruofei could call her big sister. However, Xue Biyun and Tian Huixin were best friends. Xia ruofei could only call her Aunt Xue. Otherwise, it would really mess up the seniority ...

“It’s alright, it’s alright!” Xue bi Yun quickly said,”I’m already very grateful that you can come and treat Chengcheng’s illness in your busy schedule!”

Xia ruofei looked at Chengcheng who was playing with his toys on the ground and smiled.””So your child is called Chengcheng! He’s so handsome! You’ll definitely be a handsome young man when you grow up!”

Xue bi Yun sighed,”as long as he can grow up healthy ... Doctor Xia, let me introduce you to Chengcheng’s condition!” By the way, I’ve brought all the medical records from the past few years. Please wait a moment ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Aunt Xue, don’t worry, I’ll check Chengcheng’s condition first!”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei walked to Chengcheng and squatted down. He carefully sized up this handsome little boy.
