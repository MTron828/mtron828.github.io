Chapter 1189: Feng Jing’s surprise (3)

Translator: 549690339

Feng Jing’s words received a round of applause.

Feng Jing pressed the PowerPoint on the remote control, and two more sets of prices appeared on the screen. They were 1888 Yuan and 3888 Yuan.

Feng Jing continued,”to target different consumer groups, we’ve also launched two other products. They are the 1888 RMB congealed fat series and the 3888 RMB jaded bones ice Skin Series. Different prices mean different levels of purification and different effects. I can guarantee that you get what you pay for. You can choose the grade that suits you according to your financial ability!”

The price did not surprise everyone.

After all, if a product wanted to dominate the market, it had to distinguish between the consumer groups and launch different prices and quality products for different groups. Only by forming a ladder could the benefits be maximized.

This is simply a matter of one willing to fight and the other willing to suffer. Yingluo, we won’t force you to buy the most expensive products. There are products that cost hundreds, thousands, and even more than three thousand Yuan. You can choose whatever grade you want.

Just when everyone thought that the bidding was over, Feng Jing pressed the remote control in her hand again.

The prices of the three sets had all disappeared, and in their place was a beautiful crystal bottle.

Feng Jing smiled.”The three series of products we just announced are all our mass – produced products. Next, I’m going to introduce to you our limited – edition Jade skin cream, the secret code series!”

Feng Jing pointed at the big screen behind her and said,””As everyone can see, our skin code series limited edition Jade skin cream is made up of 33 layers of natural crystals stacked together. There are even three fixed rings made of Platinum on the outside. This is a beautiful piece of art in itself!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Moreover, it’s not just the packaging that’s luxurious!” Feng Rao smiled and said,”the skin code series limited edition jaded skin cream. It’s hand – made by our research team according to the ancient recipe. On top of that, we also added expensive essential oil Ingredients. You can say that we’ve done the best we can do so far. Naturally, the effect is much better than the mass – produced version!”

As this was a limited edition product, Feng Jing didn’t want to beat around the bush and directly said,””Limited by the harsh requirements of the process and production environment, our skin code series of jaded skin cream is sold in a limited number of 300 bottles a year, 100 of which are sold in China and 200 are sold overseas.”

“In terms of price, it’s 880000 Yuan a bottle in China and 150000 euros a bottle overseas!” Feng Rao said with confidence.

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp after hearing this.

This paradise company really dared to set a price! This price was already the price of a top international luxury brand. Were they that confident?

However, most of the audience were just amazed. They couldn’t afford the limited edition anyway, so it didn’t matter how high the price was.

As for the big bosses of the e – commerce market who didn’t lack money, they naturally didn’t change their expressions. Liu Dong even secretly decided that if the effect of the jaded skin cream was really that good, he would buy two limited edition bottles for his wife. The crystal bottles alone were so pleasing to the eye!

The press conference could be said to be a great success.

Today’s announcement segment was coming to an end. Feng Jing secretly heaved a sigh of relief. At least she didn’t screw up on stage. In fact, she had been quite nervous before she went on stage. Her legs were even trembling. However, once she went on stage, she was so focused that she forgot about her nervousness.

Just as Feng Jing was about to announce the release date and invite everyone to the experience area to try out the jaded skin cream, her assistant, Liu Qian’s voice suddenly came from her earpiece,””Director Feng, the chairman has informed us to add a new segment!”
