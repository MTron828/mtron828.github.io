2597 Everything is under control (2)

Liu Chongli took the list from Liu Qunfeng and looked through it carefully. His eyes revealed a trace of difficulty, but he concealed it very well.

“Good! I’ll go back today and assign the tasks!” Liu Chongli said.

“Thank you for your hard work, uncle Chongli!” Liu Qunfeng said politely.

Then, Liu Qunfeng turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, we’ll do our best to find the herbs, but my father’s current condition ...”

“I will use traditional acupuncture to stimulate Mr. Liu’s acupuncture points. I hope it can stabilize his body for the time being and stop it from getting worse!” Xia ruofei said,”but don’t get your hopes up. No matter what, the longer elder Liu is in bed, the more danger he will be in. So ... The speed at which you find the herbs will determine elder Liu’s chances of survival. I hope everyone will do their best!”

“Alright! Alright!” “Then I’ll leave it to you, Mr. Xia!” Liu Qunfeng said.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”due to the lack of medicinal herbs, the medicine I’m using now can only temporarily stabilize the condition. This is a temporary solution. As time goes on, the condition will continue to deteriorate. By then, even I will be powerless to save her.” I’ll also try to contact some of my friends here. Some of the medicinal herbs I bought last time were bought from my friends at a high price. ”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Liu Qunfeng said sincerely,”Mr. Xia, thank you so much for this! Moreover, this matter was completely caused by our own reasons. We’ve caused you a lot of trouble. We’re really sorry! No matter what the result is, we are grateful to you from the bottom of our hearts. We, the Liu family, will never be ungrateful. There may have been some disputes in the past, but that’s all in the past. I hope that you won’t hold any grudges against us, Mr. Xia. In the future ... Just look at our performance!”

This time, Liu Qunfeng was truly grateful to Xia ruofei from the bottom of his heart. The other core members of the Liu family were also touched.

The treatment last time was considered a deal. Although Xia ruofei’s miraculous hand of rejuvenation had saved the Liu family from turmoil, the Liu family had paid the corresponding price. Hence, they were not very grateful to Xia ruofei. Some people, such as Liu Lifang, were even a little unhappy. They felt that Xia ruofei was asking for too much by taking away the entire Pharmaceutical Group.

This time, it had nothing to do with Xia ruofei. He could just say “I can’t do anything” and leave. The Liu family could not say anything. However, Xia ruofei did not care about the past and spared no effort to think of a way for the Liu family. He even revealed some of the precious prescription in order to gather the medicinal materials as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei’s performance elevated the Liu family’s impression of him. Some of them even felt a little ashamed of their prejudice against Xia ruofei.

Of course, this was just a temporary emotion. If elder Liu really didn’t want to be treated, or if his condition stabilized or even recovered, then the Liu family might have a different attitude. After all, emotions prevailed now, but when that time came, rationality would definitely prevail.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’ll go see elder Liu first. You guys can go back to your work!” We must hurry up in finding the medicinal herbs!”

“Alright!” “We’ll definitely mobilize the entire family’s power,” Liu Qunfeng said solemnly.”We’ll find these herbs at all costs!”

Xia ruofei returned to the ward next door where elder Liu was. She did a thorough check and had a more detailed understanding of elder Liu’s health.

After making up his mind, Xia ruofei flipped his hand and took out a small bottle of diluted solution from the spirit Heart Flower petals.

Then, he used his mental power to extract a small ball of liquid and slowly transferred it into old man Liu’s stomach through the nasal feeding tube.

Xia ruofei’s calculations were very accurate. After the spirit Heart Flower petal solution was consumed, it could basically stop the cancer cells from spreading further. At the same time, it would repair old man Liu’s organs that had started to show signs of failure. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Simply put, he was going to use this liquid to keep old man Liu alive.

Then, Xia ruofei waited for a while before he took back the silver needles on elder Liu’s acupuncture points. After carefully disinfecting them, he put them into the needle bag and kept them in the medium.

Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to check on elder Liu’s condition. After confirming that there was no problem, he stood up and walked out of the room.

Liu Qunfeng had already sent the core members of the Liu family away. Everyone’s priority now was to find the herbs on the list.

Liu Qunfeng chose to stay behind so that he could have someone to call the shots when Xia ruofei needed him.

He didn’t dare to go far, so he just paced back and forth in the corridor outside the house. As soon as Xia ruofei left, Liu Qunfeng immediately came up to him and asked carefully,””Mr. Xia, how’s the situation?”

Xia ruofei showed a trace of “fatigue” and said,””It’s stable for now ... There shouldn’t be any major problems in the next two to three days. However, if we want to get through this difficult time, we still need to find the medicinal herbs as soon as possible ...”

“I understand!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”we’ve already mobilized the entire family to search for it. I believe we’ll have news soon.”

Liu Qunfeng was very confident in the Liu family’s abilities.

Of course, Xia ruofei did not think much of it. He just smiled noncommittally.

“Mr. Xia, I’ll get someone to prepare a room for you.” Liu Qunfeng quickly said. You’ve flown all the way here from the three mountains as soon as you received the news. It’s been too hard on you ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”There’s no need to prepare a room. There’s nothing else to do here. I won’t be staying here.”

“Ah?” Liu Qunfeng was stunned, then immediately said,”Mr. Xia, my father’s current situation ... Without you here, we really can’t explain!”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”elder Liu’s condition is indeed not very good. However, I’ve just said that he’s temporarily stable. His condition shouldn’t continue to worsen in the short term.” If you can’t find all the herbs, there’s no point in me staying here. And ...”

Xia ruofei paused for a moment and looked at Liu Qunfeng. Then, he said,””To be honest, I don’t have much hope that you can find the herbs on the list, so I need to contact some of my old friends. If necessary, I have to personally check the herbs. If I stay here, I won’t be able to do anything!”

Liu Qunfeng was very hesitant. With old man Liu’s situation and Xia ruofei not being here, he was not confident. However, Xia ruofei’s words made sense. Besides, the treatment was all up to Xia ruofei now. How could he dare to force Xia ruofei at this time?

So, after a fierce struggle, Liu Qunfeng finally nodded and said,””Mr. Xia, I respect your personal wishes. But ... If anything happens to my father, I hope ... You can come over as soon as possible to help us ...”

“Don’t worry, I won’t leave the capital. ” Xia ruofei said calmly,”if there’s anything, you can call me anytime ... Of course, I don’t think anything will happen. At least within three days, elder Liu’s condition will be more stable, unless ... You don’t trust my medical skills!”

“I don’t dare! I don’t dare!” Liu Qunfeng quickly said,”I have absolute trust in your professional judgment, Mr. Xia ... Then ... I’ll arrange for a car to send you right away ...”

“No need, I’ve already called my driver. He should be here soon.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”chief Liu, you should take good care of elder Liu! In addition, it was still the same sentence, the matter of finding medicinal herbs must be seized! Time waits for no one!”

With that, Xia ruofei strode towards the stairs.

After he went downstairs, he sat in the courtyard for a while and waited for Wu Qiang to pick him up.

Liu Qunfeng didn’t dare to disturb Xia ruofei. He only told the staff to wait at a distance so that they could immediately provide any service if Xia ruofei needed anything.

When Liu Qunfeng was having a meeting with the core members of the family, Xia ruofei had already called Wu Qiang. Hence, he did not wait long after he went downstairs. Wu Qiang had arrived at the house in the Toyota Elfa business car.
