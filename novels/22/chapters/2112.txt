He smiled and said,”Mr. Xia, I texted Xiaoxiao to ask her to come over. However, I didn’t say that you were here. I only told her that there was something at the store and that she needed to come to work earlier. I also wanted to give her a surprise.” However, I didn’t expect her to come so quickly. ”

Bastian knew very well that the reason why Xia ruofei looked at the Western restaurant in a different light was because of Cheng Xiaoxiao, who was a die – hard fan. So, when Xia ruofei came here, he naturally hoped that Cheng Xiaoxiao would be there as well. This way, it would be easier to close the distance between the two sides.

Of course, Bastian didn’t inform Cheng Xiaoxiao immediately after receiving Xia ruofei’s call yesterday. The main reason was that Xia ruofei said that he would bring some foie gras for testing, and that they were samples cultivated by the Paradise Corporation. Bastian was not sure about the quality of the foie gras, and he was also afraid that if the foie gras weren’t good, Xia ruofei would lose face in front of his fans.

It wasn’t until all the data showed that the quality of this batch of foie gras was higher than he had imagined that he secretly sent a text message to Cheng Xiaoxiao.

It could be said that although Bastian was a Westerner, he was also well – versed in China. He was more familiar with the ways of the world than many Chinese people.

“I don’t live far from here,” Cheng Xiaoxiao said.”Mr. Bastian said something happened at the restaurant, so I quickly took a taxi here ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”he’s a role model for his employees!” Mr. Bastian, you have to reimburse Xiaoxiao for the fare!”

“Of course! Of course!” Bastian hurriedly said.

Then he said,”Xiaoxiao, in addition to meeting Mr. Xia, I called you over for something. There’s a dish that we need you to taste with us later.”

Xia ruofei sat at the side and watched with a smile. Bastian didn’t tell Cheng Xiaoxiao that the ingredients were provided by the Paradise Corporation, so he naturally wouldn’t expose it.

“Alright!” Cheng Xiaoxiao nodded.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Xiaoxiao, don’t just stand there. Come and sit with us ...”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, he made way for them to sit inside, leaving an empty seat outside.

“Oh! “Okay ...” Cheng Xiaoxiao nodded and sat down on the seat that still had some of Xia ruofei’s body temperature, her head still a little dizzy.

Although it wasn’t the first time she was in close contact with Xia ruofei, Cheng Xiaoxiao still felt an inexplicable sense of excitement and happiness in front of her idol.

“President Xia, are you here to try the new dish?” Cheng Xiaoxiao asked.

“Yup!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”I’m not immune to good food. If there’s good food, I’ll definitely rush over as fast as I can.”

Cheng Xiaoxiao felt a little strange that a billionaire like Xia ruofei would come here to test the dishes, but she couldn’t tell what was wrong, so she could only keep it in her heart.

“Mr. Xia, you guys have a chat!” Bastian got up and said,”I’ll go to the kitchen to see how Gore is preparing.”

“Alright,” he said. Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

After Bastian left, Xia ruofei chit – chatted with Cheng Xiaoxiao with a smile and even took the initiative to ask about her recent situation. He didn’t put on any airs of an idol.

Cheng Xiaoxiao’s mind was a lot slower in front of her idol. After chatting with Xia ruofei for a while, the little doubt in her heart had long been thrown out of the clouds.

About ten minutes later, Gore, who was wearing a tall chef’s hat, came out with a small dining cart.
