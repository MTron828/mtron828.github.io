Chapter 1629: Full of confidence (1)

Zhao Yongjun was stunned for a moment, then his eyes lit up. He turned to Xia ruofei and asked,””RUO Fei, could it be that there’s still a turning point in this matter?”

Zhao Yongjun was very sensitive. He felt that Xia ruofei didn’t just want to cheat Liu haofan, especially when Xia ruofei bid 380 million. Zhao Yongjun could feel that Xia ruofei really wanted to buy the land at that price.

Of course, the latter bid of 400 million was purely to make a fool out of Liu haofan. Liu haofan didn’t disappoint them. In a moment of rashness, he added another 10 million without thinking.

But Zhao Yongjun couldn’t understand why Xia ruofei was willing to pay a price that was obviously higher than the market price for the land. Even when Liu haofan paid a heavy price to get the land, Xia ruofei was still calm and seemed to have a plan.

Zhao Yongjun really couldn’t think of any other way to turn things around.

Song Rui, who was sitting in the back seat, couldn’t help but lean forward when he heard this. He held the back of the front seat with both hands and said,””What other chance can there be? Don’t tell me that the blockhead Liu er is willing to give up his land to us? Even if he’s willing to give it up, I don’t want it! Just how high was the price? Whoever wants it is a fool!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Let’s not talk about this for now. I want to know what Liu haofan and Tang real estate are planning to do with this land.”

Song Rui said,”I know about this. I’ve already inquired about it. Liu haofan wants to cooperate with Tang real estate to develop a high – end real estate project that mainly focuses on hot springs. I think it’s called the intelligent Community or something. He said that he wants to introduce some smart homes and the like. Anyway, it’s just a gimmick!” The main focus of this project is to play side – by – side and stack. Naturally, the customers are the middle – Class who want to improve their quality of life. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and asked,””Now that the cost of acquiring the land has increased by nearly 100 million, do you think it’s possible for them to build this land and wait for the property prices to rise before developing it?”

“That’s possible!” Song Rui said,”Liu er definitely won’t be easily taken advantage of ...”

Zhao Yongjun shook his head and said,”it’s impossible to do it so blatantly!” “The current policy is rather tight and does not allow developers to hoard land to cover up the stock. However, there are still loopholes in the policy. I think Liu haofan will think of a way to delay the development plan ...”

“For example?” Xia ruofei asked,”what’s his usual method?”

“The simplest way is to build some simple buildings on this land,” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile. “At least it’s considered work! Of course, the government also has requirements for the completion time, so it won’t be so easy to do. There are still some other operations ...”

Xia ruofei nodded.”So, you’re saying that even if Liu haofan and Tang real estate want to hoard land, they have to start work first?”

“Definitely!” Zhao Yongjun nodded. I guess they will organize workers to enter the site as soon as possible to smooth out the site, and it’s hard to say how they will delay it later. Anyway, with Liu haofan’s network and the fact that Tang real estate is also an experienced agent in this field, they will definitely be able to do it well!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”That’s good. Song Rui, give Wei Jun a call. Let’s go to the scene to take a look.”

“The land is already someone else ‘s,” song Rui muttered.”What’s there to see?”

However, song Rui was only talking. He would still listen to Xia ruofei’s words, so he took out his phone and called Wei Jun as he complained. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The hot spring resort wasn’t far from the land, so it didn’t take long for the two cars to arrive next to it.

Xia ruofei opened the car door and jumped out. He first stood at a distance and observed for a while, then walked in. After looking at a few points, Xia ruofei got into the car and drove to another place. He then got out of the car and continued to observe.

Xia ruofei did not say a word throughout the entire process.

Song Rui finally couldn’t help but ask,””RUO Fei, What are you looking at? This is just a wasteland, what is there to see here?”

Xia ruofei calculated in his heart and then smiled.””Alright, look carefully! Let’s go back!”

“You ... Can you not keep me in suspense?” song Rui said.

Song Rui knew that Xia ruofei must have come with a purpose, but he couldn’t figure out what was so special about this land. The more Xia ruofei didn’t say, the more anxious he became. His heart was like a cat’s paw.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you won’t understand even if I tell you. But ... I already know what to do. Just wait and see!” Maybe Liu haofan will ask us to take over the land soon ...”

Song Rui’s face was full of disbelief. He pouted and said,””How is that possible? Liu er would still admit defeat? Besides, even if he begs us, we can’t accept him! I’m not a fool!”

Xia ruofei laughed.”By that time, the transfer price can’t be 410 million. Maybe we can haggle a little. We might be able to get it at 300 million!”

“What?” Song Rui’s eyes widened as if he had just heard a fantasy story. RUO Fei, are you still sleeping? Or is he having a fever ...”

Song Rui said as he reached for Xia ruofei’s forehead.

Xia ruofei slapped song Rui’s hand away and said,”Believe it or not, but don’t inspect other lands for the time being. I think this land is quite good ...”

Zhao Yongjun was more mature. Although he had some doubts in his heart, he did not say it out loud like song Rui.

Zhao Yongjun’s impression of Xia ruofei was that he wasn’t the type to brag. Even though this matter sounded unbelievable, there must be a reason behind it, and it was a reason that he didn’t understand.

So, Zhao Yongjun pondered for a moment and asked,””RUO Fei, are you confident?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I’m confident, but I can’t be 100% sure. The main thing is that I don’t know Liu haofan very well. I don’t know how he does things.”

“Liu haofan’s actions are indeed arrogant, but he’s not a brainless person,” said Zhao Yongjun. In fact, he doesn’t have that much financial resources, which is why he joined hands with Tang real estate to do this project. If there is really an accident that may lead to the complete failure of the project, I think he will still choose to cut the meat to cut the loss. ”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but look at Zhao Yongjun and said,””It seems that brother Zhao has noticed something?”

Zhao Yongjun smiled bitterly,”you kept me guessing, how could I have seen anything?” However, since you’ve said so, I believe you must have a way to make Liu haofan have no choice but to give up the land, and your method is related to the land itself. ”

Xia ruofei nodded.”The general direction is correct. There are some things here that you guys have not come into contact with and don’t understand. I won’t explain in detail. Let’s go back first!” I still have to make some preparations in the next two days!”

Zhao Yong Jun laughed and said,”alright!” We’ll be under your command for the next two days!”

Song Rui also said excitedly,”if we can make Liu er obediently give us this land at a low price, it’s not a big deal even if we have to work a little harder!” Haha ... Just thinking about it makes me feel good ...”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””Don’t get carried away, kid! “Also, don’t provoke Liu haofan, or he’ll lose his temper. He’ll rather lose 400 million just to keep this land. We’ll be dumbfounded then ...”

“I know, I know ...” Song Rui said casually.

The group got back into the car and drove straight to the capital.

After returning to the courtyard in liuhai Lane, Xia ruofei gathered everyone in the second courtyard and sat around the stone table under the grape trellis.

“Brother Zhao, I need your help to prepare some things in the next two days!” Xia ruofei said.

Zhao Yongjun replied readily,”just tell me what you need!” As long as it’s not something particularly rare, we can definitely prepare it for you if we all move out together!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It shouldn’t be rare. It’s just that it might be a little complicated.”

“You say it!” Zhao Yongjun took out a pen and paper from his bag.”I’ll write it down in case I make a mistake ...”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”first, we need to prepare nine pieces of locust tree. Each piece is about 15 centimeters in diameter and no less than 50 centimeters in length. We need to take the center part. Also, the locust tree must be 36 years old. No more or less ...”

As Xia ruofei explained, Zhao Yongjun nodded his head and quickly recorded it down.

Although this condition was a bit harsh, locust trees were not that kind of rare species. It could be said that they were very common. As long as he put in some effort, it was not difficult to find all of them.

“Ruofei, why must it be a 36 – year one?” song Rui asked curiously.

Xia ruofei thought, how would I know why? That was what the array DAO Records said.

He glanced at song Rui and said with a smile,””You’re just a kid! Why are there so many whys?”

“Tsk!” Song Rui was so angry that he gave Xia ruofei the middle finger and then walked to the side to smoke.

“I’ve noted all of this down,” Zhao Yongjun said, chuckling.”What else do I need to prepare?”

Xia ruofei said,”the other thing is to prepare nine round mirrors. They are also about 15 centimeters in diameter and 81 copper coins. It’s best if they are five Emperor coins. Small five Emperor coins will do. This should not be difficult.”

The five Emperor coins were divided into Big Five Emperor coins and small five Emperor coins. Big Five Emperor coins referred to Qin banliang, han Wuzhu, Tang Dynasty’s Kaiyuan Tongbao, Song Dynasty Tongbao, and Ming Dynasty’s Yongle Tongbao. Small five Emperor coins were made by the five most prosperous emperors of the Qing Dynasty, zhuanji Shunzhi, Kang Xi, Yongzheng, Qianlong, and Jiaqing zhuanji during their reign.

Zhao Yongjun was an expert in antiques, so he naturally knew about the five Emperor coins. He nodded and said,””No problem! This could be done within a day! RUO Fei, do you need to prepare anything?”
