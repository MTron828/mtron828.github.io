Chapter 3602: A coincidental encounter (1)

Translator: 549690339

The speed of the flying sword was extremely fast. When it changed direction, climbed up, or descended, the influence of inertia, whether it was overweight or weightless, was much more exciting than a roller coaster.

Tang Haoran was only a teenager, but when Xia ruofei deliberately performed many difficult stunts, he was very excited and kept cheering.

Obviously, he thought that Xia ruofei was showing off his flying skills for him.

Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly. He did not expect his little disciple to be so naturally bold. Perhaps Tang Haoran really loved flying and especially yearned to ride a flying sword. That was why he did not feel any fear at all.

Since he could not scare Tang Haoran, Xia ruofei was too lazy to waste his time. He controlled the flying sword to rise and soon left Sydney, flying quickly in the direction of the Hunter Valley.

On the flying sword, Tang Haoran still had some hidden meaning as he said,’’”Master, do a few more stunts! I’m not satisfied yet!”

Xia ruofei said unhappily,”flying a sword also consumes elemental energy, okay?” It was enough to experience it! Since you’re so interested, then work hard on your cultivation. In the future, you can fly on your own sword and fly however you want!”

“Oh! “I understand …” Tang Haoran said.

He had indeed made up his mind to cultivate properly. Hmm … I’ll shorten the time for my extracurricular activities and push back my sleep time by an hour. It’s decided! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Hunter Valley was not far from Sydney, so it did not take long for Xia ruofei and Tang Haoran to arrive in the sky above the Hunter Valley.

Looking down from the sky, the whole vineyard of this famous wine – producing area was quite spectacular.

Surrounded by the vineyard, there was a large green plot of land. That was where Paradise Farm was.

Australia was considered a large but sparsely populated place. Hence, Xia ruofei easily found a secluded place. He landed his flying sword and walked towards Paradise Farm with Tang Haoran.

The two of them soon arrived at a small town near Paradise Farm. From the place where they had landed the flying sword to Paradise Farm, the nearest road had to pass through this small town, and it would take about half an hour to walk.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry. Besides, he had not been back to the Hunter’s Valley for a long time. When he was at Paradise Farm, he would occasionally go to the town’s Bar for a drink, so this time, he did not deliberately look for a closer landing spot. He landed directly outside the town and took the opportunity to visit the old place.

Tang Haoran had grown up in Australia. He did not find this small town new. However, since he was already out, he would just follow Xia ruofei’s arrangements. If Xia ruofei wanted to walk around, he naturally had no objections.

Xia ruofei walked along the only Main Street in the town with great interest. Sometimes, he would stop by some small shops, but he did not stay for long.

He usually looked at the goods that he was interested in. He would forget about most of them after seeing them. He would only buy the ones he really liked.

He just enjoyed the pleasure of shopping as an ordinary person.

Just as Xia ruofei and Tang Haoran were about to pass through the town, an uncertain voice came from behind Xia ruofei.””Mr. Xia?”

This person spoke English. However, both Xia ruofei and Tang Haoran were very good at listening and speaking English. Hence, they stopped at the same time and turned around to look.

Xia ruofei saw a man in a denim shirt and jeans with a big cowboy hat.
