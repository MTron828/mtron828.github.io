3122 Irresistible force (3)

Song Qiming was even more shocked when he saw this.

Although the material of the longevity mountain stone was soft, it was absolutely impossible to easily pinch a finger mark on it. No matter what, it was still a stone, not plasticine!

“This ... This ...” Song Qiming stuttered.

He had thought that the powerful strength contained in his body was just his illusion, but he didn’t expect it to be real.

Could the power of the human body reach such a terrifying level?

In fact, this level of strength was nothing to Xia ruofei.

Moreover, whether it was Song Wei or Ling Qingxue, any one of them could leave a deeper fingerprint on the paperweight. Even a child like Tang Haoran could do better than song Qiming. After all, Tang Haoran’s cultivation level was already at the fourth Qi layer, which was one level higher than song Qiming ‘s.

However, song Qiming, who had never been in contact with cultivation and did not know about the existence of cultivators, was shocked by his own power.

Xia ruofei said,”uncle song, don’t get too excited. Calm down!” Calm down!”

“RUO Fei, quickly tell me what’s going on. Why do I suddenly have such a powerful strength?” Song Qiming quickly asked,”how did the Qi – nurturing technique you taught me have such a terrifying effect?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”uncle song, please calm down. Also, you don’t have to worry at all. There’s nothing wrong with your body now. You’re much healthier than anyone your age!” As for this power, I will slowly explain it to you. ”

“Alright, tell me ...” Song Qiming took a deep breath and gradually calmed down.

After all, he was a senior leader. From the small mountain village to his official career, he had experienced too many things along the way, so his mental strength was much stronger than ordinary people.

Xia ruofei did not answer song Qiming’s question directly. Instead, he smiled and asked,””Uncle song, do you believe that there’s a group of special people in this world who have explored their potential to the extreme step by step? they have power that ordinary people can’t even imagine.”

Song Qiming smiled bitterly.”In the past, I would have thought that it was a fantasy. But now that I’ve experienced it myself, how can I not believe it?” RUO Fei, you’re one of the special people you mentioned, right?”

Song Qiming was not a fool. Naturally, he quickly realized that Xia ruofei was the one who had taught him the “Qi – nurturing technique”. When he had fallen into a state of complete oblivion, Xia ruofei had guided him twice with the heat flow and taught him more advanced techniques at the last minute, which allowed his strength to improve by leaps and bounds. Since Xia ruofei could teach him the “Qi – nurturing technique” so easily, Xia ruofei himself must be strong.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He did not say anything and picked up the paperweight like song Qiming.

Under song Qiming’s shocked gaze, the longevity mountain stone paperweight kept changing its shape in Xia ruofei’s hands, as if it had really become soft plasticine. After a while, the square longevity mountain stone paperweight had become a standard longevity mountain stone ball.

Xia ruofei placed the longevity mountain stone ball on the desk and smiled.””Uncle song, we call ourselves cultivators, or practitioners. Perhaps you’ve already guessed it, but what I taught you before wasn’t the ‘Qi nurturing technique’ that old men and old ladies use to train their bodies, but an authentic cultivation technique called the ‘modest Heart Sutra’. You’ve already experienced the effects of this cultivation technique, so I won’t go into detail. ”

When Xia ruofei was about to feed song Qiming the wild tea, he was already prepared to tell song Qiming everything. After all, song Qiming had already started on the path of cultivation. If he kept it from him and met other cultivators or had an accident during the cultivation process without him knowing, it would be even more dangerous.

“Cultivator ... Cultivation technique ...” Song Qiming could not help but Mutter to himself.

Xia ruofei’s few words had completely subverted song Qiming’s world view that he had formed over the past few decades.

Xia ruofei looked at song Qiming and continued to explain,””In fact, most people’s physiques don’t meet the requirements to become cultivators, so even if they have cultivation techniques, most people will never be able to step on the path of cultivation in their entire lives. Uncle song, the reason why you were able to cultivate so smoothly started from the time you were injured ...”

Hence, Xia ruofei told him everything that had happened after song Qiming’s brain was severely injured, including how he had tried his best to pull song Qiming back from the brink of death. During the process, he had used the precious heart – concentrating grass, which had caused song Qiming’s body to change and become very suitable for cultivation. He told him everything in detail.

After song Qiming heard the complicated and bizarre reason, he could not help but be stunned and speechless for a long time. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei continued his cultivation class.””Uncle song, the division of the realms of cultivators is quite complicated. The stage you’re at is called the Qi refining stage. Before, you’ve always been at the first Qi layer, but after you drank the spirit tea I brought and entered a state of enlightenment, your cultivation has broken through one after another. Now, you’ve reached the third Qi layer, and even the bottleneck of the fourth Qi layer has loosened. The Qi refining stage is divided into nine levels. If a cultivator breaks through to the ninth level, they will break through to a major realm. The realm after the Qi refining stage is called the Golden core stage ...”

Song Qiming was dumbfounded. There was too much information for him to process.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not continue. Instead, he smiled and said,””Uncle song, at that time, I found that your body had become very suitable for cultivation, so I chose the [modest Sutra] that was most suitable for you to teach you. As you can see, you have successfully embarked on the path of cultivation. You don’t have to feel any pressure, because the benefits of becoming a cultivator are obvious to you. The most direct benefit is to extend your life ...”
