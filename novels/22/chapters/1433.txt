If this method was used in Ling Ji F & B, there would basically be no situation of a large area of free orders.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”I think you’re becoming a workaholic. How can you even think of work?”

Ling Qingxue stuck out her tongue in embarrassment and said,””I didn’t pay attention just now!”

Xia ruofei suddenly laughed evilly.”Qingxue, if I think of a way to make the hourglass move faster, what do you think their expressions will be when they find out that the hourglass has already been emptied by the time the dishes are served?”

Ling Qingxue said in disbelief,”how can the hourglass move faster?” It leaks out all the sand, so the time should be constant!”

Hourglass was a timekeeping tool in ancient times. Even if the small hourglass used in this shop was not very accurate, it was impossible for it to have a huge deviation.

Xia ruofei chuckled and didn’t explain further. He just placed his hand on the top of the hourglass.

He released a little bit of his mental energy, and the sand was leaking down much faster. It could even be seen with the naked eye.

The hourglass was supposed to rely on gravity to leak down and it was completely sealed from the outside. Basically, it was impossible to exert any external force. However, when Xia ruofei used his spiritual power to press down, it was equivalent to adding another layer of force to the hourglass. Naturally, the speed of the leakage increased.

Ling Qingxue first revealed a look of disbelief, then she quickly chuckled and pushed Xia ruofei’s hand away. She said,””Alright, alright! They would be discovered soon! You’re such a rich boss, yet you’re still so shameless?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”I saw that you didn’t believe me. So, I wanted to prove it to you. Right?”

With that, he turned the hourglass upside down and let the sand flow back for a while before turning it over again. Then he said with a smile,””This can’t be considered cheating!”

“That’s more like it!”Ling Qingxue said with a smile.

After the brief interlude, the two of them chatted as they waited. Time seemed to pass by very quickly. After a short while, Xia ruofei saw a waiter carrying a wooden tray walking towards them from a distant passage.

On the tray was a long stone pot. The lid was covered tightly, and not a trace of heat could be seen.

“Our food is here!” Xia ruofei smiled as he told Ling Qingxue to sit opposite him. The waiter came from behind her, so she could not see him from her seat.

Ling Qingxue immediately turned around and pouted,””Aiya! Just a little bit more and it would all be gone! If you didn’t mess around just now and put it back for a while, maybe we could have gotten it for free ...”

“You’re thinking too much!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”their timing is very accurate. I promise that even if we don’t move the hourglass, there will be a little sand left ...”

The waiter walked over step by step. Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue also tidied up the cutlery in front of them and were ready to eat.

At this moment, an unexpected situation occurred. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At another table across the aisle from Xia ruofei’s table, the customers had just finished eating and left. A middle – aged female shop assistant in an apron was clearing the table.

When the waiter came over with the stone pot, the salesgirl was bending over to wipe the table. When the waiter walked behind her, she just stood up.

The aisle was a little narrow, and the middle – aged salesgirl didn’t know there was someone behind her, so she got up a little too abruptly and bumped into the waiter holding the tray.

Caught off guard, the waitress instantly lost her balance as her hand became soft. The hot stone pot instantly slid off and was thrown towards the middle – aged female clerk ...
