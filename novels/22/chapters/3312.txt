3313 A Swift victory (2)

As if they had a life of their own, these black lights found their targets as soon as they appeared. Their speed suddenly increased a bit, and they directly attacked the star beasts who were temporarily blind.

Puchi, Puchi sounds rang out continuously, and in an instant, the twenty – one star beasts were all struck by the black light.

Immediately, the array was lit up with flames. These Majestic Star beasts were in a very sorry state.

They had also come to the end of their lives. After a while, the last star Beast also stopped wailing. It retreated a few times and then completely stopped breathing.

Xia ruofei didn’t need to check if the astral beast was Dead or Alive because he could see through the vision of the perceptual mirror that his mission progress had been updated to 37/100.

It was 16/100 just now, but now it was 37/100, which meant that he had killed another 21 star beasts.

In other words, none of the 21 star beasts were spared. They had all been killed by the trap & kill array.

Xia ruofei only gave himself half a minute to enjoy the joy.

Then, he quickly removed the formation and put away all the formation materials. After throwing them into the spirit map space, Xia ruofei continued to venture deeper into the forest in search of a new target.

Xia ruofei realized that this method was quite useful. The efficiency of hunting star beasts had increased a lot.

In the following time, Xia ruofei pushed himself to the limit. Soon, he followed the same pattern and killed two batches of 43 intermediate star beasts.

His mission progress had reached 80/100.

If he wanted to break the record, he only had about 30 minutes left. He had to kill 20 intermediate star beasts within half an hour, or all his previous efforts would be in vain.

In fact, Xia ruofei was still very confident at the moment. The next few batches of intermediate star beasts he encountered were all more than twenty.

Therefore, as long as he could successfully find another intermediate Star Beast, defeat it, set up an array, and wait for it to call for reinforcements, there was a high probability that he could deal with it in one wave.

Xia ruofei continued to search in the forest. He estimated that he had walked more than 200 kilometers since he reached the second level of the Tower of Trials. Obviously, this forest was huge, so huge that it was beyond his imagination.

Xia ruofei’s mind was running wild as he searched forward. The person he was most worried about was naturally Ling Qingxue.

After all, Ling Qingxue’s combat experience was close to zero, and danger lurked everywhere in the trial Pagoda.

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard a creak from his right ...

He immediately stopped in his tracks and looked in the direction of the sound.

At this moment, Xia ruofei no longer had any wild thoughts. He was highly focused because he had been maintaining his mental strength to Scout the surroundings. However, he did not find anything unusual within the range of his mental strength. The sound was at most a hundred meters away from him. The range of his mental strength was much larger than this. What was it? How did he escape the detection of spiritual power?

There were too many questions in Xia ruofei’s mind, but he knew that now was not the time to get to the bottom of it. The most important thing was to find the source of the sound and confirm whether it was safe.

Xia ruofei’s expression was grave. He stared at the place where the sound came from and explored to the right.

At this moment, Xia ruofei heard another creak.

Xia ruofei suddenly felt an extreme sense of danger. His hair stood on end.

Xia ruofei was very confident in his sixth sense. He stopped in his tracks and retreated quickly.

However, just as Xia ruofei was about to retreat, a roar suddenly came from the direction of the sound.

Xia ruofei felt as if his heart had been stepped on just by hearing this sound. He didn’t dare to look back. As he ran, he summoned the qushuang flying sword and wanted to escape.

He wasn’t sure what was in the forest, but his sixth sense told him that it was an extremely dangerous guy.

As expected, the moment Xia ruofei stepped on the qushuang flying sword, he heard a creaking sound, accompanied by the sound of a branch being cut.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to look back. Instead, he pushed the speed of the qushuang flying sword to the extreme and agilely shuttled through the forest.

His spiritual power was still in a scouting state, but he found nothing.

If he only used his spiritual power to check, he would find that there was nothing behind him. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Such a strange situation made Xia ruofei even more nervous. As he flew forward, he saw an opening and quickly turned around to take a look.

With one look, he was instantly shocked.

About ten meters behind him, a huge astral beast was fiercely chasing him.

This astral beast was stronger than all the astral beasts he had encountered before. Its body was three times the length of an ordinary middle – grade astral beast, and the scales on its body exuded a Dark Blue Metallic luster. When it opened its big mouth, two rows of fangs were extremely sharp, and the toenails on its claws were as sharp as daggers, exuding a cold aura.

A high – Level astral beast!

Xia ruofei suddenly had this thought.

There was no doubt that this Star Beast that could escape his spiritual power detection and was obviously much stronger than a medium level Star Beast was most likely a high level Star Beast.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He thought to himself that his luck was too bad. He had been searching aimlessly in such a large forest and had encountered a high – Level Star Beast.

He felt that this was most likely the lair of a high – Level astral beast. He had stupidly walked in step by step. If he hadn’t been careful enough after hearing the creaking sound, he might have already died under the claws of a high – Level astral beast.

However, his current situation was also very dangerous. The speed of the flying sword had reached its maximum, but the distance between him and the high – Level Star Beast was still slowly closing.

Star beasts were already very fast, and the high – Level Star Beast behind Xia ruofei was even faster than the intermediate Star Beast.

Therefore, even if Xia ruofei used all his strength to drive the flying sword, he could not escape from this high – Level Star beast’s pursuit.

Most importantly, time was still ticking away. If he wanted to break the record, he did not have much time left.

As Xia ruofei fled through the forest, he racked his brain and tried to think of a countermeasure.

If not for the qushuang flying sword, even if Xia ruofei used all his strength, he would have been caught up by the high – Level Star Beast.

Even so, the distance between the two was slowly shrinking. In other words, if he didn’t come up with a practical and effective way, it would only be a matter of time before he was caught by the high – Level Star Beast.

As he had been exposed to the high – Level astral beasts, Xia ruofei could not take out the spirit map scroll.

Astral beasts were highly intelligent. If Xia ruofei had disappeared into thin air and there was an obviously man – made scroll on the ground, the high – Level astral beast would definitely be interested in it.

Time waits for no man. Xia ruofei had been running for three minutes and thinking of a plan.

Finally, after weighing the pros and cons, he decided to take the initiative to change, and even take a little risk.

Hence, as Xia ruofei was running away, he waved his hand slightly and the center of the trap & kill array was sent into the grass.

...

Xia ruofei controlled his flying sword and flew past. The high – Level Star Beast followed closely behind. The confinement killing array’s core that was hidden in the grass did not attract his attention.

Xia ruofei controlled the flying sword and flew forward with all his might. Then, he changed his direction unknowingly and returned to the place where he had released the array core after going around in circles.

Next, Xia ruofei led the high – Level Star Beast in circles in the forest. Every time they passed by the grass in the center of the trap and kill array, he would throw out some materials for the array.

Even though the distance between Xia ruofei and the astral beast was closing, he didn’t panic. Instead, he tried his best to set up the formation.

After more than ten minutes, Xia ruofei finally placed the last piece of material in place ...
