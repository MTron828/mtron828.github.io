Chapter 7: Young Girl’s Feelings

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Xia Ruofei was still in a daze. Liu Minghao, who was beside, had a dark look in his eyes as he asked.

“Qingxue, do you know this young man?”

Ling Qingxue ignored Liu Minghao and came to Xia Ruofei excitedly.

“Xia Ruofei, don’t you remember me? I’m Ling Qingxue! Your middle school classmate!”

Middle school classmate?

Not only did Liang Qichao, Liu Minghao, Lu Wen, and Lu Ping find it unbelievable, even Xia Ruofei was completely dumbfounded. After a while, he said.

“I think… I have some impression…”

“You remember?” Ling Qingxue said happily. “That’s great! I thought you really forgot about me!”

As she spoke, Ling Qingxue’s entire body was almost touching Xia Ruofei’s body. Her towering breasts were so close to Xia Ruofei’s chest that Xia Ruofei took half a step back unnaturally.

Liang Qichao and the rest could not help but change their view of the world once again. The cold Ling Qingxue actually had such a side to her… and just now, Xia Ruofei obviously did not remember her. He said it casually, but Ling Qingxue actually believed it.

When did this little princess of Ling Ji, who had always been known for her intelligence and calmness, become a complete love-struck fool?

Liang Qichao and the rest, including Xia Ruofei, did not know that Ling Qingxue was actually a student from the class next to Xia Ruofei’s in junior high school. Xia Ruofei was considered an influential figure in junior high. He played football especially well and was considered handsome and bright. There were many girls who liked him.

Ling Qingxue was one of them.

Most importantly, Ling Qingxue was harassed by a group of hooligans near the school gate when she was in the second year of junior high school. It was Xia Ruofei who rushed forward and beat the hooligans away.

From that moment on, Xia Ruofei’s figure was deeply engraved in Ling Qingxue’s heart.

Of course, that incident was insignificant to Xia Ruofei. He had forgotten about it not long after.

When they were in high school, Ling Xiaotian, whose business was getting bigger, arranged for Ling Qingxue to enter a high school while Xia Ruofei entered an ordinary high school. From then on, the two of them never crossed paths again.

However, Ling Qingxue could not forget Xia Ruofei.

The first awakening of love was the most unforgettable. Ling Qingxue even secretly went to Xia Ruofei’s school to watch him play soccer. But Xia Ruofei was completely unaware of all this.

Later, Ling Qingxue heard that Xia Ruofei became a soldier after graduating from high school. After that, Ling Qingxue lost all news of Xia Ruofei.

In these past few years, she had quite a few suitors, especially as her father’s business grew bigger and bigger, and there were more and more outstanding young men and handsome men by her side. However, not a single one of them caught her eye. It was even to the extent that she was even more annoyed by such pursuits, and her attitude became colder and colder.

Ling Qingxue did not expect to be reunited with Xia Ruofei under such circumstances. In her excitement, she seemed to have become that innocent and naive middle school girl again. When she saw the Prince Charming in her dreams, her joy was overflowing.

“Xia Ruofei, I heard that you joined the army after graduating from high school. What happened after that?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Uh… I just retired not long ago…” Xia Ruofei said.

Xia Ruofei had no impression of this passionate beauty. The current situation was really awkward.

Ling Qingxue didn’t notice at all and continued to ask with interest.

“Oh! Life in the army must be exciting, right?”

“It’s alright.” Xia Ruofei smiled awkwardly. “It’s just exercise, training, and learning…”

“Then where do you work now that you’re retired from the army?” Ling Qingxue raised her head and asked with a pair of beautiful eyes.

“I just came back not long ago. I don’t have a job yet,” Xia Ruofei answered honestly.

Liu Minghao could not help but say.

“It’s not easy to find a job for soldiers nowadays! My dad’s company hired someone who used to be the head of the army a few days ago. He chose to be a freelancer and is now the head of our company’s office. Oh right, Little Xia, what is your ranking in the army?”

Xia Ruofei smiled faintly and said.

“Sergeant.”

“So he’s not an officer… Then it’s even harder to find a job…” Liu Minghao said.

He even glanced at Ling Qingxue, and his words were filled with a sense of superiority.

Ling Qingxue did not even look at Liu Minghao. All her attention was on Xia Ruofei.

Ling Qingxue said.

“Xia Ruofei, why don’t you come to our Ling Ji’s Restaurant chain? We have a new branch in the bell tower area, and we are lacking a manager!”

“Qingxue, the position of manager is so important, and Little Xia doesn’t have any experience in the food industry. I’m afraid it’s not appropriate…” Lu Wen said with a smile.

“None of your business!” Ling Qingxue mercilessly retorted.

Lu Wen looked at Xia Ruofei resentfully, pouted, and said sarcastically.

“Little Xia, you have to know your place. Don’t try to take advantage of others…”

Ling Qingxue said with a cold expression.

“Lu Wen, don’t blame me for falling out with you if you keep nagging! Who do you think you are?! Who are you to interfere with our Ling Ji Restaurant’s matters?”

“Qingxue, I’m doing this for your own good…” Lu Wen explained.

Xia Ruofei hurriedly said.

“My classmate Ling… Qingxue, I appreciate your kindness. Actually… I don’t have any plans to come out to work yet.”

“Ah… I see!” Ling Qingxue was very disappointed. “Then if you want to find a job, you must consider our place! The door to Ling Ji’s Restaurant will always be open for you.”

Xia Ruofei smiled bitterly.

“Definitely, definitely…”

At this moment, Liang Qichao finally had a chance to interject. He quickly said.

“Blood… Uh, Mr Xia, can you show us your Ice Lantern Jade Dew?”

Compared to Liu Minghao and Lu Wen, Liang Qichao was much more polite to Xia Ruofei.

Xia Ruofei smiled and said.

“Of course!”

Liu Minghao laughed and said.

“Liang Qichao, do you really believe that Little Xia can cultivate a supreme-grade ice lantern? Haven’t you heard? He just retired from the army. Could it be that Little Xia majored in succulent plants cultivation? Haha…”

Lu Wen took the opportunity to quip.

“I think young master Liang is going crazy trying to please others!”

Xia Ruofei frowned. Ever since he entered the room, Liu Minghao and Lu Wen had been targeting him.

He had never met them before! Were they mad dogs?

At this moment, Ling Qingxue frowned and said.

“Liu Minghao, Lu Wen, be more polite! Why can’t Xia Ruofei nurture a supreme-grade ice lantern? Just because you can’t doesn’t mean others can’t!”

Xia Ruofei was her idol when she was young and the Prince Charming in her heart. Furthermore, this time, when she reunited with Xia Ruofei, she realized that Xia Ruofei, who had been through military training, seemed to have a more manly aura. It simply fascinated her.

How could she allow Liu Minghao and Lu Wen continue to mock Xia Ruofei?

Liu Minghao and Lu Wen both shrugged and shut their mouths.

However, their expressions were still filled with mockery.

Xia Ruofei looked at Ling Qingxue thoughtfully. He could roughly guess what was going on. He smiled bitterly and decided not to stoop to the level of those two mad dogs.

He opened the plastic bag and took out the pot of Ice Lantern Jade Dew.

Seeing this, Liu Minghao could not help but mock.

“This is the first time I’ve seen someone put a supreme-grade ice lantern in a plastic bag, haha… and this flower pot, it’s too shabby…”

He was only focused on mocking, but he didn’t realize that Liang Qichao, Ling Qingxue, and Lu Ping were completely attracted by the pot of Ice Lantern Jade Dew. They didn’t even hear what he said.

Liang Qichao’s gaze was a little too focused, and he revealed an extremely fanatical expression. He immediately threw himself in front of the coffee table, squatted down, and stared fixedly at the Ice Lantern Jade Dew.

“It’s too beautiful… It’s simply the work of the creator…” Liang Qichao muttered.” This shape… these leaves… is too perfect…”

Liang Qichao didn’t hide his fondness for this Ice Lantern Jade Dew at all. Although Ling Qingxue didn’t say anything, her beautiful eyes also flickered with a loving light.

She stared intensely at the pot of Jade Dew. The crystal clear dew reflected an enchanting light under the sunlight. Ling Qingxue’s beautiful face became even more alluring.

Liu Minghao finally reacted. He stared at the Ice Lantern Jade Dew and muttered.

“This… this… how is this possible…”
