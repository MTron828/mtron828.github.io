Xia ruofei had been paying attention to Tang Haoran’s condition. When his cultivation level had stabilized, he immediately used his spiritual force to speak to him.”Haoran, the effect of this wild tea is still there. Don’t waste it. Master will now teach you the fourth level of the cultivation method. You just have to follow the route I told you to circulate your spiritual energy. Don’t worry!”

With that, Xia ruofei passed on the fourth level of the “blazing sun Scripture” to Tang Haoran through spiritual force telepathy.

This kind of temporary teaching was naturally not like usual, where the cultivation method was broken down and explained the principles. He directly guided Tang Haoran on how to control the flow of spirit Qi. At the same time, he also put his hand on Tang Haoran’s wrist, and his mental power was constantly paying attention to the situation of the circulation of Tang Haoran’s meridians.

Under this kind of alternative teaching, Tang Haoran carefully controlled his spiritual energy according to the circulation route of the fourth level of the “fierce yang Scripture” and began to practice this fourth level cultivation method for the first time.

Very quickly, under Xia ruofei’s guidance, he completed one circulation.

Then, it was the second cycle.

Tang Haoran was getting more and more familiar with the process. Spiritual Qi was constantly gathering and being absorbed into his body. It was then transformed into true Qi in his dantian.

Tang Haoran’s cultivation base was also improving rapidly.

In the end, when this rapid growth ended, Tang Haoran’s cultivation was fixed at the middle to the later part of refined Qi Level 4. His Foundation was very solid, and it could be said that he could break through to refined Qi Level 5 in a few days.

Tang Haoran opened his eyes. His eyes were filled with surprise and joy.

He didn’t expect that his master would come all the way to pick him up and give him such a big surprise.

“Master! “My cultivation has improved so much ...” Tang Haoran could not help but say excitedly.

Xia ruofei said calmly,”Haoran, this kind of opportunity is hard to come by. You have to correct your attitude. Cultivation can’t be achieved overnight. You have to be down – to – Earth and walk step by step. Only then can you find the ultimate Dao!”

Xia ruofei was worried that Tang Haoran was too young and would lose his mind under such circumstances. He would become impetuous, so he tried to educate him in time.

“I’ll remember it, master!”Tang Haoran’s expression turned serious.

“You’ve broken through to refined Qi Level 4, and you’ve made great progress in all aspects. Your strength is much greater than before, so you must remember that cultivation is not for the sake of fighting. You must never rely on your identity as a cultivator to bully ordinary people!” Xia ruofei said sternly,”if I find out, I’ll definitely punish you severely! Do you remember that?”

“I’ll remember it!”Tang Haoran quickly said. Master, Haoran has always remembered your teachings. He has never bullied his classmates just because he is strong!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei finally smiled and patted Tang Haoran’s head.””That’s right! In the future, remember my words and never bully others, understand?”

“Yes! Master!” Tang Haoran replied crisply.

Xia ruofei continued,”I’ll explain to you the fourth level of the” sun Scripture “later. You only know how it is, but you don’t know why it is so. You must really understand the meaning of the technique. Only then will you be able to cultivate it with half the effort!” Alright, you can go to the side and rest for a while!”

Xia ruofei did not explain to Tang Haoran immediately because he realized that Li Yifu was about to wake up.
