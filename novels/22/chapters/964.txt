The moment he picked up the phone, a gentle smile appeared on Xia ruofei’s face. He said,””Qingxue!”

“Has the plane landed?” Ling Qingxue asked with a smile.

“Yup! I just got out of the airport. ” Xia ruofei gestured for Lei Hu and Lin Qiao to continue walking as he laughed and said,”I was just about to call you after I got in the car!”

Lin Qiao could tell that it was Ling Qingxue who called, and the disappointment in her eyes grew even more intense. However, she concealed it well and followed Lei Hu through the road in front of the airport Hall, walking to the parking lot opposite.

Xia ruofei was on the phone as he followed the two of them.

“You must be tired from this trip, right?” Ling Qingxue asked considerately.

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s alright. It’s alright. Who wouldn’t be tired after traveling?”

Xia ruofei continued to ask,”dear, you called me as soon as the plane landed. Are you checking up on me?”

“I’m too lazy to check your post!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”I’m here for serious business! The first Ling’s private kitchen in Sanshan city will officially open for business tomorrow. My dad invited you over to attend the opening ceremony and have a meal together. ”

Ling Ji F & B group had always been trying to transform. As the company’s scale grew bigger and bigger, if its position remained as a civilian consumer, it would not be able to walk out of the circle of small profits but quick sales. It would be more and more difficult to expand in the later stages.

Last year, Ling Ji restaurant opened a star – rated hotel. It was also an attempt to transform. With Xia ruofei’s help, the hotel successfully got the title of a designated reception unit from the municipal government. Soon, it entered a positive business and the development momentum was good.

Ling’s private kitchen was also a decision made by Ling Xiaotian at the beginning of the year. It was another transformation.

The reason why Ling Xiaotian came out to do the F & B business in the past was because his ancestors had always been chefs. Ling Xiaotian could be considered to have a long history of learning from his family, so he could cook the authentic three mountain cuisines.

Of course, as his status grew higher and higher, Ling Xiaotian could no longer cook personally. However, many of his disciples had taken up the position of head chef in various major stores. The Executive Head Chef of the company was also taken up by his disciples.

Therefore, Ling Xiaotian was prepared to draw out his capable forces to set up a relatively high – end private restaurant. Its positioning was similar to that of a club, emphasizing the best environment, and at the same time, the selling point was the authentic Sanshan private restaurant.

Previously, Ling Qingxue had been so busy, mainly preparing Ling Ji’s private kitchen. Xia ruofei was naturally very clear about this.

“So it’s father-in-law’s orders!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but ... Let’s forget about the opening ceremony! You know that I don’t like to show my face in public, so I’ll definitely be there on time for dinner!”

“I knew you wouldn’t want to attend the opening ceremony! My dad still doesn’t believe it!” Ling Qingxue pursed her lips and smiled. Then, she said gently,”alright, it’s fine if you don’t want to attend, but you have to be there before 6:30 tonight! I’ll send you the address on WeChat later!”

“Yes, sir!” Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”wife, it’s been a long time. Do you want to come out and meet me tonight?” Why don’t you come to the farm?”

Ling Qingxue blushed and said in a low voice,””Aren’t we meeting tomorrow?”

“Is that the same?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I mean, let’s meet alone. You know ...”

“I’m busy with the opening tomorrow!” Ling Qingxue said guiltily,”ruofei, why don’t I take a look at Shi -”

“It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”if love lasts for a long time, how can it be in the morning and evening? You go do your thing first! But you have to rest well!”

Ling Qingxue’s heart was filled with sweetness as she replied, Then I’ll hang up first!”

“See you tomorrow, my wife!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“See you tomorrow!” Ling Qingxue said. She hesitated for a moment, then spat on the phone again, and then quickly hung up the phone with a red face.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he laughed.

Ling Qingxue had been with him for a long time. At first, she was the one who took the initiative to pursue him. However, ever since the two of them had confirmed their relationship, Ling Qingxue had become more and more shy.

While Xia ruofei was making the call, he was already a few meters behind Lei Hu and his partner. He put away his phone and quickly caught up.

After finding the car in the parking lot, Lei Hu placed their luggage in the trunk. Then, the three of them got into the car and Lei Hu drove towards Taoyuan farm.

The farm was not far from Changping International Airport, and the car arrived at the farm’s entrance in about 20 minutes.

The old soldier on duty at the entrance saw the Mercedes – Benz from the farm and raised the bar. Lei Hu drove straight into the farm and stopped outside Xia ruofei’s Villa.

“Leave the luggage to me!” Xia ruofei patted Lei Hu’s shoulder and said,”you’ve worked hard today. Go back and rest early!”

“Yes!” Lei Hu said.

“Oh right, tell that brat ye Lingyun to report to my office tomorrow!” Xia ruofei reminded.

“Alright!” Lei Hu nodded at Xia ruofei, then got into the driver’s seat of the Mercedes – Benz and drove away from Xia ruofei’s Villa.

Xia ruofei beckoned to Lin Qiao and the two of them walked into the villa’s courtyard.
