Chapter 1596: Dude, an azmu!_1

Translator: 549690339

If Xia ruofei wanted to buy a yacht, he would first consider using it in the spirit map space. Although the sea there was not as vast as the outside world and he was alone, he could still enjoy the pleasure of sailing on a yacht.

As for using it in the outside world, there were still too many problems. First of all, it needed a yacht berth, which was difficult to find even within the three mountains.

It was said that San Shan was building a yacht dock near the exhibition center, but it would not be completed until the end of the year or even next year.

The mainland was not like Hong Kong, where the rich basically had private yacht docks. Yachts were still new in the mainland, and the relevant supporting security was not as complete as in Hong Kong.

If it was used in the space, it would not be so troublesome. No one would care if it was parked or not, and there was no need to worry about safety. Xia ruofei could specially build a small space to place the yacht, which was definitely more stable than anchoring.

Of course, in the long run, Xia ruofei would still need a yacht dock. After all, there would be some maintenance work to do.

After setting his initial goal, Xia ruofei had his own choices.

First of all, the size of the yacht could not be too big.

It was obvious that the size the yacht, the more troublesome it would be to deliver it. Besides, the target was so big that Xia ruofei could not store it in the medium without anyone knowing. After all, there were satellites in the sky!

Even if he had the chance, it would be difficult for Xia ruofei to store a luxury yacht that was dozens of meters long into his medium with his current spiritual power.

Therefore, he eliminated the larger models first.

In the end, Xia ruofei chose the “azimutatlantis 34” model.

This model of yacht was only about 10 meters in length, and its various performance parameters looked very good.

Most importantly, Xia ruofei knew that a yacht of this size would definitely not be driven over to hand it over to Yingluo. How could such a small yacht cross the ocean?

Therefore, he didn’t need to think to know that it was possible that it was carried by sea or by a cargo ship.

By then, Xia ruofei could ask for the yacht to be sent to his warehouse. The yacht was only about the length of a large truck, and the warehouse could accommodate it.

By then, Xia ruofei would be able to keep it in the medium without anyone knowing.

There was nothing more suitable than this.

After Xia ruofei made up his mind, he flipped to the cover of the album. There was a business card here. It was the business card of the salesperson just now.

He took a look and saw that the salesperson’s name was Liao Bo.

It was a very cool business card. Other than the azmu LOGO, there were only a few lines of handwritten names, contact information, and other information. On the back was a sketch of a yacht. It looked very simple and elegant.

Xia ruofei dialed the number on the list and the call went through quickly. It seemed like the business volume of this high – end Yacht Sales was not that big. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Hello!” Liao Bo said with great enthusiasm.

“Hello, I’m the guest you just received.” Xia ruofei asked,”are you still at the yacht exhibition area? I’d like to know more about buying a yacht. ”

Liao Bo was both surprised and happy. He quickly said,””It’s here! It was there! Sir, where are you? I’ll be right there!”

Xia ruofei looked around and said,””The Pombo motorboat exhibition is right next to me ...”

“I know that place! Please wait a moment, Sir, I’ll be there immediately!” Liao Bo said excitedly.

After a while, Liao Bo strode over. He recognized Xia ruofei from afar, mainly because when Xia ruofei mentioned the motorboat exhibition area, he immediately thought of the strange guest.

“Hello, Sir!” Liao Bo extended his hand enthusiastically.

Xia ruofei shook his hand and smiled.””Hello, manager Liao!”

“I don’t dare! You can call me little Liao, Sir!” Liao Bo said, then asked,”may I know your name, Sir?”

“My surname is Xia!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Xiao Liao, I mainly want to know more about the Atlantis 34 model.”

Xia ruofei said as he pointed at the picture in the brochure.

Liao Bo was obviously very familiar with the yachts he was in charge of sales. He said without thinking,””Mr. Xia, this is a small yacht under azmu. It has excellent performance and is suitable for offshore use!”

Liao Bo introduced,”we call this yacht a sports elf that has integrated high – tech dance music.” Elegant restaurant design, a completely open soft roof, an independent water platform, an ergonomic steering room ...”

“It has a gorgeous exterior and a comfortable interior. Space, lighting, and storage space were the main considerations of the design. The dining area could also be converted into a bed, and the multi – functional kitchen could allow you to enjoy cooking to your heart’s content. When you’re done with the sun and rain, you can relax and rest on the bottom deck without any worries; The master bedroom was isolated from the other spaces and had complete privacy! “And it also comes with a comfortable shower room that can be entered individually ...” Liao Bo continued to speak with fervor and assurance.

“It looks like a Sparrow has all its organs despite its small size!” Xia ruofei smiled.

“Every yacht under azmu is dedicated to the ultimate experience of our customers, and this size sports yacht is no exception!” With a hint of pride in his expression, Liao Bo said,”Mr. Xia, if you order now, we will also provide a special discount for this yacht exhibition!”
