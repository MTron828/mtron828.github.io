Chapter 1252: Getting on with serious business (1)

Translator: 549690339

As the two of them spoke, they came to the specially added cold cabinet.

Xia ruofei entered the password and opened the cold cabinet. Then, he took out the White truffle that he had prepared earlier.

Monica stared at it intently until the entire white truffle appeared in front of her. Throughout the entire process, her eyes widened, and she looked more and more excited.

She had thought that it was already very good that Xia ruofei had reserved a truffle for her. She did not have much hope for the weight and quality of the truffle. If there was a truffle comparable to the final item of the auction, why did he not auction it?

However, when Monica saw the truffle, she realized that Xia ruofei had left the best truffle for her.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Monica, this white truffle weighs 2.53 kg. Its quality is definitely not inferior to the truffles at the auction!” Are you satisfied with this?”

“Xia, I didn’t misjudge you!” Monica said excitedly,”with this truffle, my trip to Hong Kong will be a great success!”

“As long as you’re satisfied ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Monica looked at the truffle for a long time, and the more she looked at it, the happier she was. Although they had already seen several truffles of similar quality at the auction, they had only been seen from below the stage. Now that they could see it up close, it felt completely different.

The shock brought by a top – grade truffle was naturally completely different.

Monica was born into a family of truffles. She grew up smelling the fragrance of truffles. The pure taste of this white truffle fascinated her.

Xia ruofei felt that he was being ignored by the beauty. He deliberately said with a sad face,””Monica, you’re making me jealous ...”

Monica couldn’t help but laugh. She turned around and hugged Xia ruofei.”Jealous of a piece of truffle? I didn’t expect my man to be so narrow – minded ...”

Xia ruofei suddenly felt his anger rising. He pulled Monica into his arms and pressed her almost perfect face against his. He said fiercely,””You dare to say I’m narrow – minded? It seems that the punishment just now was not enough ...”

After saying that, his hands began to move around.

Feng Jing had already been here once and probably wouldn’t be coming back. It was already past 10 am and Xia ruofei didn’t have many friends in Hong Kong. No one would visit him in the middle of the night, so he was more daring.

Monica laughed as she dodged and said,””My dear, wait! We’ll talk after we’re done with the proper business ...”

“What I have to do now is official business ...” Xia ruofei said with an evil smile and then lowered his head.

However, Monica stretched out her hand to block Xia ruofei’s mouth and insisted,””Xia, I’ll spend more time with you after I’m done with the truffle, okay?”

Xia ruofei could tell that Monica was not flirting but was really rejecting him. He could not continue in this situation, so he let go of her hand helplessly.

Monica pursed her lips and smiled. She glanced at Xia ruofei flirtatiously and said,”Xia, keep this truffle first!”

For such a top – grade truffle, every minute it was exposed to the air would increase the risk of it going bad. Thus, Monica was also in a hurry to keep the truffle in the cold storage after looking at it.

Xia ruofei nodded and kept the truffle in the cold cabinet.

Monica asked with a smile,””Do you have a computer?”

“Of course, please wait a moment!” Xia ruofei said.

After he finished speaking, he went straight back to the bedroom. In a place where Monica’s line of sight was blocked, he took out a computer bag from the space. Inside it was his Apple laptop and a full set of mouse power sources.

Monica took the computer bag and went straight to the study. She connected the computer to the power supply.

Xia ruofei was standing beside Monica. After entering the login page, Xia ruofei went over and entered the system with his fingerprint.

Monica opened the email software with practiced ease. After logging in, she downloaded a document and started editing it on Xia ruofei’s computer.

Xia ruofei did not look at the computer screen. His eyes were all on Monica.

Monica stared at the screen attentively, clicking with the mouse from time to time and then quickly typing on the keyboard. Her expression was quite serious.

As soon as she entered her working state, she immediately had the aura of a strong woman.

However, Monica was only wrapped in a bath towel at the moment, barely covering the alluring parts of her body. Her hair was also let down.

The two temperaments of languidness and seductiveness mixed together with a serious and focused one, more or less, looked out of place.

The corners of Xia ruofei’s mouth slowly curled up.

Monica hit the Enter key and said with a smile,””Done!”

Then, she found the extension port in Xia ruofei’s laptop bag and connected the printer in the study room to the computer. She quickly finished the installation.

Soon, a document was printed.

Xia ruofei then turned his attention to the computer screen.

The printer was still spitting out the printed paper. Xia ruofei had already seen the contents of the document on the computer screen.

Now that Xia ruofei’s English was very good, he could easily tell that it was a truffle transfer agreement. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The document was probably a template Monica had left in her email. She had only downloaded it and modified a portion of the content.

By then, the document had been printed. Monica smiled and handed it to Xia ruofei.”Xia, take a look! Sign if there’s no problem!”
