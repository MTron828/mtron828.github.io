2055 “Pretty boy”(1)

Xia ruofei departed from Beijing at around 10 am. After a ten – hour flight, he arrived at around 10 pm Beijing time. However, due to the time difference, it was still around 3 pm in Turin.

When he arrived at the Grao family’s Manor, it was not even four in the afternoon.

When Xia ruofei and Monica came out of the bedroom, the sky outside was starting to turn dark. The sun usually set around nineo’ clock in the evening in Turin. It was clear how crazy the two of them had been that afternoon.

Monica’s legs were still weak when she left the house. Even though Europeans had stronger physiques, she was still unable to withstand Xia ruofei’s storm of attacks.

However, the physical fatigue could not hide the joy in her mind. This could be seen from Monica’s beautiful face that was still flushed.

Monica did not hide her relationship with Xia ruofei at all. When they left the house, she held Xia ruofei’s arm tightly as if they were conjoined twins. She did not want to be separated for even a moment.

The people from the Grasso family couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei strangely. To them, this Asian man was most likely a pretty boy who lived off a woman.

Xia ruofei naturally did not care about how others looked at him. He was still smiling and calm.

“Is dinner ready?” Monica raised her voice.

“Patriarch, dinner is ready. Please head to the dining hall!” A few days ago, Monica had appointed Rodie as the family’s butler.

Rodie was the brother of Monica’s cousin, Jessica. She had been working in the Grao family’s business. Monica had entrusted Jessica with an important task. After Jessica took charge of the family’s internal affairs, Rodie had also been transferred to the family as a Butler.

“Um ... By the way, let’s invite our two Chinese friends over for a meal!” Monica ordered.

“Yes, chief!” Rotie said respectfully.

Ah Yong and Ah Hua had been treated with great courtesy during their stay in the glaso family. Monica had invited them to dinner because she considered that they were Xia ruofei’s Chinese compatriots.

When they arrived at the restaurant, Monica led Xia ruofei to the long table.

Soon, ah Yong and Ah Hua came to the dining room together. The faint hostility on their faces had long disappeared, replaced by unconcealable fear.

The two came to the table and bowed slightly to Xia ruofei and Monica. Hua said,””Mr. Xia, miss Grao, thank you for your kind invitation. We won’t disturb you two from your meal.”

The two of them had come over to say hello. After Ah Hua said that, the two of them prepared to leave the restaurant.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”let’s sit down and eat!” You don’t have to be so formal. ”

“This ...” Hua hesitated.

“Yes!” Ah Yong quickly replied. Then ... I’ll do as you say!”

Ah Hua also reacted and quickly said,”Thank you, Mr. Xia!”

After that, the two of them walked to the end of the long table and sat down, their postures very low.

Xia ruofei looked strangely at the two of them whose attitudes had changed. However, he did not say anything. He just smiled and asked Monica,””Oh right, where’s your brother? Why didn’t he come for dinner?”

Before Monica could say anything, Rotie, the Butler, said,””Sir, Rousey has his dinner at around 19 every day. He’s already finished.”

Monica’s face was slightly hot. She couldn’t wait to meet her lover today and didn’t even care about her brother’s meal.

“If that’s the case, let’s eat!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Monica nodded and gestured to Rotie. Rotie immediately made a gesture, and the servants immediately served the dishes that had been prepared.

The dinner was obviously prepared carefully. It was not the Western food they often ate, but traditional Chinese food. However, they also used a separate eating system, and all the food was a small portion for each person.

Xia ruofei took a look and saw that there were home – cooked dishes like Yuxiang shredded pork and mapo tofu. It was obvious that Monica had specially invited a Chinese food chef over after knowing that he was coming to Turin.

“You’re so considerate!” Xia ruofei smiled at Monica, then picked up the chopsticks that were specially prepared for them. He said to ah Yong and Ah Hua,”don’t stand on ceremony. Let’s eat!”

The two of them stood up at the same time and bowed,””Thank you, Mr. Xia!”

They did not dare to look at Xia ruofei. Instead, they lowered their heads and focused on eating the delicious food in front of them. The atmosphere was a little strange.

……

A few hours ago.

When ah Yong and Ah Hua saw Monica bring Xia ruofei into her boudoir, their expressions became even more serious.

They walked to the side and discussed in a low voice. They decided to call lui hai to report it.

Having returned to Milan, lui hai became serious after receiving Hua’s call. He asked about the details of Xia ruofei’s appearance and said,””Don’t act rashly. I can’t contact Mr. Xia right now, but I’ll report this to uncle Yi immediately. I’ll have to ask him for instructions on how to deal with this.”

After hanging up the phone, lui hai immediately called Li Yifu who was far away in the US.

Although “Xia Tian” didn’t express any special feelings for Monica, lui hai and the others had long regarded Monica as “Xia Tian’s” woman.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
