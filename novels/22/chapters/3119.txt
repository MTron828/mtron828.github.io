“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go to the study!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Then, he stood up first, walked to the coffee table in the living room, picked up his bag, and walked to the study room with song Qiming.

At the same time, Xia ruofei shot a look at Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, signaling them to follow.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue thought that Xia ruofei would be making tea with song Qiming alone in the study room. They did not know what Xia ruofei was up to but they still followed him quickly.

Naturally, song Qiming did not feel that there was anything wrong with it. After all, Ling Qingxue was his guest and his daughter, Song Wei, had not seen each other for a long time. The father and daughter drinking tea and chatting together in the study was naturally a very pleasant thing to do.

The four of them quickly arrived at the study, where there were also ready – made tea sets.

Xia ruofei took out a small packet of wild tea from his bag. The one he took out was still the wild tea produced in the spirit map space, not the small packet that Chen Xuan had given him today.

Although the first heaven society’s wild tea might be more effective, the first heaven society’s attitude was still unclear. One had to be cautious. Xia ruofei could not guarantee that Chen Xuan’s attitude was as he said. If Chen Xuan had done something to the wild tea, wouldn’t he be harming song Qiming?

Moreover, the effects of the wild tea produced in the spirit map space were similar to the wild tea of the first heaven society. It was more than enough for song Qiming to consume, so the slight differences were not a problem.

When Xia ruofei opened the tea bag, song Qiming could not help but sniffle. He asked curiously,””The tea leaves haven’t even been brewed, but they already have such a fragrance. I’ve never heard of such a thing before!”

Xia ruofei poured the tea leaves into the teapot and laughed.”This tea is indeed rare. Uncle song, you have to try it later!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“I will! I will!” Song Qiming said with a smile.

Boiling water, heating the pot, making tea ... Xia ruofei was already very familiar with the process of making tea. His movements were smooth and natural.

Very quickly, the small study room was filled with the fragrance of tea.

Even song Qiming, who had drunk all kinds of good tea, could not help but look excited when he smelled the tea.

As for Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, they were well aware of the effects of the wild tea on song Qiming, so the anticipation in their eyes intensified.

Under everyone’s gaze, Xia ruofei poured the clear tea into the tea cup and greeted with a smile,””Come and try it! Weiwei, Qingxue, you two have a drink too!”

“I’ll take it then ...” Song Qiming picked up a cup of tea with a smile. He first blew on it gently and then took a deep breath. He looked intoxicated by the fragrance of the tea.

“By the way, uncle song, it’s best to finish the first cup of tea in one gulp. That way, the taste will be better!” Xia ruofei reminded him with a smile.

“Wuwuwu! Good!” Song Qiming nodded and said.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue both stared at song Qiming quietly.

Song Qiming blew on the tea and said,””Wei Wei, you guys should have some tea too! Why are you all looking at me?”

“Oh, oh!” Song Wei said quickly. She also picked up a cup of tea, but she pretended to blow on the tea and did not drink it immediately.

Song Qiming finally brought the tea cup to his mouth and drank it all in one go.

Then, song Qiming’s expression froze. Xia ruofei quickly said,””Uncle song, use the Qi – nurturing technique immediately!”

Although Xia ruofei knew that cultivators who consumed wild tea for the first time would enter a state of cultivation involuntarily, most of the people who consumed wild tea in the past had a certain Foundation in cultivation. Song Qiming was only at refined Qi Level 1. He was also worried that something might go wrong and waste this precious wild tea.

Actually, Xia ruofei did not need to remind him. The genuine Qi in song Qiming’s body had already started to circulate on its own.

He heard Xia ruofei’s voice and started to circulate his genuine Qi according to the “modest Sutra”. Xia ruofei had already set up a spirit gathering formation beside song Qiming to check on song Qiming’s spiritual crystal. It was kept in the safe and would only be taken out when he was cultivating. It was definitely too late now.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei was well – prepared and the spirit gathering array was a ready – made array talisman. It was extremely easy for Xia ruofei to set up the array and was completed in the blink of an eye.

After Xia ruofei set up the spirit gathering array, he released his spiritual power to monitor song Qiming’s condition.

At the same time, he turned to Song Wei and said,””Wei Wei, bring this wild tea out for aunt Fang to try!”

“Can my mother drink it too?” Song Wei was stunned.

“No problem!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it just has the effect of prolonging life! It’s good for your body if you drink it all year round!”

“Alright! Alright!” Song Wei quickly said,”I’ll go outside first then. My father ...”

“Don’t worry! I’m here!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Qingxue, come with Weiwei! You guys go and make tea and chat with Auntie Fang. I think uncle song still needs some time!”

“Alright!” Ling Qingxue said.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue took the tea tray and left the study room. Xia ruofei sat cross – legged beside song Qiming, observing him closely.

It was probably the first time in the world of cultivation that someone at refined Qi Level 1 had consumed wild tea. Xia ruofei did not dare to let his guard down and was ready to deal with any unexpected situation.
