Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”go ahead!” What’s the condition?”

Feng Jing had come to paradise Corporation when it was still in its early stages. It could be said that Feng Jing’s contributions to paradise corporation’s current development were no less than Xia ruofei’s. Moreover, the two of them had a very good personal relationship. Hence, when Feng Jing proposed a condition, Xia ruofei had to at least listen to it. If it was not too difficult, he would not reject it.

Feng Jing said,”it’s simple. I hope you can keep your position as the chairman, even if it’s just an honorary title. Paradise Corporation only has one Chairman, and that’s you. Unless you sell all your shares one day.”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,””Sister che, what’s the point of this? To be honest, 1 made this decision because I don’t have the energy to manage the affairs of paradise Corporation in the future. Actually… I’m really busy. 1 believe that you’ve tried to contact me in the past two to three months, right? Is it because you can’t contact me on my phone or WeChat?”

Xia ruofei had been in space and on the mystic Luna realm all this time. It was impossible to contact him on mobile or WeChat.

“I know…” Feng Jing said.”I simply hope that you can keep this position. That way, you’ll at least have a connection with paradise Corporation, and not just a cold stock.”

Xia ruofei had wanted to give up his position as the chairman and appoint Feng Jing as the chairman. This way, his identity would be equivalent to that of a simple investor. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

If this was in other companies with more complicated equity structures, it might be very difficult to do. However, in paradise Corporation, Xia ruofei held the majority of the shares. Such a decision could be made with just a word from him and it could be easily achieved.

However, after hearing Feng Jing’s words, Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and nodded.””Alright…”

Feng Rao finally smiled and said,””Then it’s a deal, you can’t go back on your word!”

“Don’t worry! Since I’ve agreed, I naturally can’t go back on my word.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sister che, 1 haven’t been back to the company for a long time. Don’t you have a lot of work to report? Let’s just say it together! I’ll also make one last decision in the company, and you can decide on these things yourself in the future.”

“Actually, it’s not really an emergency, except for the pharmaceutical factory …” Feng Jing said.

“What’s wrong with the pharmaceutical factory?” Xia ruofei asked.

“After the branch factory started production, the production capacity of the pharmaceutical factory increased a lot. However, the supply of raw materials is a little lacking.” Feng Jing said,”although we’ve been mobilizing the surrounding villagers to plant Chinese herbs, they have a growth cycle, after all. That’s why the pharmaceutical factories don’t dare to produce them at full capacity, especially those for autism. There’s a huge demand for them on the market now, and many hospitals are waiting in line for our medicine. Manager Xue is also very anxious and comes to look for me every few days. I couldn’t contact you either, right?” We can only let them find their own ways to expand the raw material channels and solve the problem on their own. However, this also requires time…”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” It would be best if we could solve the problem on our own!”

“We’re used to relying on you,” Feng Rao said with a bitter smile.’That’s why the pharmaceutical factory didn’t pay much attention to it even though they know that raw materials are very important. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have started to worry about it so urgently. In the future, we must change our mentality. We must change our mindset from the management level!”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s not that serious … Tell the pharmaceutical factory that I’ve solved the problem of the raw materials for them this time. In the future, I’ll supply the pharmaceutical factory with a batch of Chinese medicinal herbs every month through elder Zheng. At least with the current production capacity, it should be enough for their needs. But as you said, they still need to have a sense of urgency and must pay great attention to the construction and maintenance of raw material channels. Otherwise, when they want to expand production in the future, they’ll be caught off guard again. It’s impossible for me to continuously increase the supply of raw materials without limit.” “Understood!” Feng Rao said,”it’s already very good that we can solve the urgent situation this time. Moreover, you can provide me with the raw materials once a month. At least, the pharmaceutical factory won’t have any worries in the near future.”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile. She spread her hands and said,”Chairman, you see … We’re still used to relying on you, aren’t we? As long as you’re back, no matter how troublesome the problem is, it will be solved immediately…”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”! believe in your abilities and the potential of paradise Corporation. The future is promising. Even if I don’t get involved in the company’s Affairs anymore, I’m still a major shareholder of the company! I have a share of every cent you guys earn, and my share takes up the majority!” “It’s good that you still remember this!”Feng Rao said. Chairman, don’t really ignore the Paradise Corporation. In the future, when you’re at San Shan, you must come to the company when you’re free. You’re not only our Chairman, you’re also our spiritual leader!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and smiled.””Spiritual leader is a little too much of an exaggeration, but regarding the company’s matters, I would’ve done so even if you didn’t mention it. I also have deep feelings for paradise Corporation, but I really can’t attend to many things at once.. I can only trouble everyone!”
