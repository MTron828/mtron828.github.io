3018 The biggest harvest (2)

Xia ruofei knew that “basically no” meant that there were more. However, since Xia Qing had said that he really didn’t know anything about this ore, and it wasn’t because of the rules that he couldn’t say anything, then he really didn’t know.

Otherwise, even if she couldn’t say it, Xia Qing would have done so. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia Qing would definitely not lie to him.

Actually, Xia ruofei was already mentally prepared for this outcome.

Before falling into the space inside the ore, Xia ruofei wanted to study it by himself and did not ask Xia Qing directly. After escaping from the ore space, Xia ruofei had a faint feeling that this ore should be very rare, and Xia Qing probably didn’t know about it.

After asking, the result was as expected.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not too disappointed.

“I know, then you can go!” He said.

“Yes!” Xia Qing said.

Just as Xia Qing was about to leave, Xia ruofei called out again,””Wait!”

“What other instructions does master have?” Xia Qing turned around and asked.

“This stone ... Is related to the rules of space.” Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”do you think ... Bai Qingqing would know more?”

“The realm Fox is very sensitive to the rules of space, and its talent in space is also very strong. It’s inherited from its bloodline, and the realm Fox has inherited memories, so it might be able to recognize this stone.” Xia Qing said cautiously,”however, if there is no information about this stone in the inherited memory, then it most likely doesn’t know what it is.”

“I see ...” Xia ruofei nodded.”You can go back to your work!” Don’t tell Bai Qingqing anything about this stone. If I need it, I’ll find it myself. ”

“Understood!” Xia Qing bowed slightly and said,”master, this subordinate will take his leave!”

Xia ruofei nodded.

After Xia Qing left, Xia ruofei muttered to himself for a while and then used his spatial energy to cover up the mysterious ore.

Then, with a thought, he directly passed through the mountain sea realm, and appeared on the platform in front of the cave.

Xia ruofei took out the storage ring with a spatial nested structure from the stone chamber in the cave.

As soon as the storage ring left the cave, Xia ruofei saw a white light flash in front of him, and Bai Qingqing, the world Fox, appeared on the platform in front of the cave.

In the past, Xia ruofei could not capture Bai Qingqing’s movements at all. However, after experiencing the inner space of the ore for a thousand years, Xia ruofei’s understanding of the laws of space had deepened by many times. This time, the spatial fluctuations when Bai Qingqing appeared could no longer escape Xia ruofei’s eyes. The entire movement trajectory was captured by Xia ruofei without missing anything.

Naturally, Bai Qingqing could not sense the change in Xia ruofei. She spoke in the human language,””You’re finally done. Are you here to crack this nested space?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it seems like you take this matter very seriously!” The moment this storage ring appeared, you immediately ran out!”

“No matter how small a mosquito is, it’s still meat!” Bai Qingqing pouted her lips in a very human – like manner and said,”in this small space of yours, other than being able to comprehend the spatial laws to my heart’s content, there’s really nothing good about it ... It’s been a long time since I’ve eaten a world stone ... I’m just hoping that the nested space in this storage ring can bring me a little surprise!”

Xia ruofei looked at Bai Qingqing’s pitiful expression and couldn’t help but laugh.””Please! I haven’t seen a world stone in a long time, alright? I still want to find more world stones for my spirit map space to absorb! How long has it been since my dimension has been upgraded?”

“Then you have to go out and search more often!” Bai Qingqing could not help but complain,”you’ve been staying in one place every day. Do you think the world stone will come to you on its own?” My ability to sense world stones can be said to be unparalleled in this world. With such good conditions and yet you don’t make use of them, who else can you blame?”

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly and said,”I know!” He knew! It’s just that I haven’t had the time recently! Besides, the world was so big. If they searched everywhere without any clues, the chances of finding the world stone would probably not be high! I feel like it’s like a blind cat trying to catch a dead mouse!”

Bai Qingqing looked a little embarrassed. She waved her front paw and said,””It’s better to find someone than not! I’ve been hungry for so long ...”

In fact, Bai Qingqing knew that Xia ruofei was right. No matter how strong its ability to sense the world stone was, it had a limited range. If it did not have any target and just searched aimlessly, the chances of finding the world stone would be very low.

After all, world stones were not something that could be found anywhere. Even in the ancient cultivation world, they were extremely precious resources.

Since it had failed, Bai Qingqing did not want to continue on this topic. It said directly,””Let’s not talk about the world stone for now! We’d better hurry up and break this nested space! To hide such a small space inside so carefully, it must be used to store very precious things. There might even be world stones!”

Xia ruofei laughed and asked,””Then, do you want to talk about the world stone or not?”

Bai Qingqing waved her claws in anger and said,””I want to talk about the nested space! Since you took the time to come in today, let’s seize the time to crack this nested space! Don’t forget the share you promised me, you can’t go back on your word! I’ll now teach you how to find and break the nested space. The method is not ...”
