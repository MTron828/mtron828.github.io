Chapter 1260: Fanatical horse racing (1)

Translator: 549690339

“More than 20 million Hong Kong dollars!” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but click his tongue.

MA Xiong laughed,”for a racing horse, this price isn’t an exaggeration at all!” Xia Sheng, do you know how much the most expensive purebred horse is worth? More than 60 million in US dollars!”

“This is a real ‘BMW’!” Xia ruofei laughed.”It’s much more expensive than a BMW ...”

Guo Hongjiang couldn’t help but laugh.”Horse racing is indeed expensive. A good horse is worth a lot of money. Besides, the maintenance and training of the horse are also very expensive in a year. If we don’t talk about other things, just the transportation fee alone will cost hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong dollars!”

“This is really a sport for the rich ...” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but exclaim.

“That’s not entirely true,” Guo Hongjiang said with a smile.”There are ways to play with money, and there are ways to play without money!”

Then, he pointed to the grandstand downstairs and said,””Horse racing in Hong Kong can be said to have a very low entry requirement. The entrance ticket to the horse racing track only costs 10 Hong Kong dollars, and you can just use the eight – Star Piton. The betting threshold is also very low, only 10 Hong Kong dollars. There are also many ways to play, you can bet on winning alone, position, winning streak, and so on ...”

“Director Guo,” MA Xiong said with a smile.”If you have time later, you can take Xia Sheng to see your beloved horse!”

“No problem!” The star of Hong Kong should be going through all sorts of inspections right now, and he’s not allowed to come into contact with the outside world before the competition. ” Guo Hongjiang smiled and said,”but before the competition begins, I can bring Mr. Xia down to take a closer look!”

Xia ruofei nodded and scanned the room. He chuckled and said,””Actually, I don’t need to look at it to know that the photos here are all from the ‘star of Hong Kong’, right?”

This private room was exclusive to Guo Hongjiang. Even if he didn’t come, this room was not open to the public, so the decoration and layout of the private room were arranged according to Guo Hongjiang’s preferences.

There were many photos of the same horse hanging on the wall of the room. Since the star of Hong Kong was so popular with Guo Hongjiang, it was not difficult to guess.

Guo Hongjiang smiled and nodded.””Yup! These photos were just changed this year. My previous horse has already retired, and there are a few other horses that have not yet met the competition’s standards. ”

Then, he sighed and said,””It’s not easy to find a good horse these days!”

“Isn’t this star of Hong Kong enough for you?”MA Xiong teased. I don’t know how many people are envious of you!”

“Hahaha! That’s because I have good taste!” Guo Hongjiang said proudly,”I had my eyes on this horse not long after it was born. I bought it and trained it for a long time!”

“Oh?” Xia ruofei was a little surprised.”So, you’re saying that director Guo spent more than 20 million Hong Kong dollars on a pony?”

“That’s normal!”MA Xiong said with a smile. Director Guo has a professional team, and they’re all very experienced and have good eyes!” The star of Hong Kong had a pure bloodline, and his father was a champion horse, so it was normal for stallions to be sold at a high price! Now that the star of Hong Kong has won so many awards, his net worth must be more than 20 million Hong Kong dollars. It must have more than doubled!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

MA Xiong looked at Guo Hongjiang after he finished speaking.

Guo Hongjiang smiled proudly and said,””That’s not a big deal. I can’t sell the star of Hong Kong anyway. It’s my treasure!”

“That’s right! Hong Kong’s Chairman Guo loves horses like his life, everyone knows that!” MA Xiong teased.

“Hahaha! People always have to have some hobbies!” Guo Hongjiang said with a smile. Then, he looked at Xia ruofei and asked,”Xia Sheng, are you interested in buying a few bets to play? My performance as the star of Hong Kong is quite stable, and I don’t have any strong opponents tonight, so it shouldn’t be a problem to win. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” Then let’s play, but it’ll be fine after a while. The most important thing is entertainment!”

At Guo Hongjiang’s level, it was impossible for him to really take a big gamble.

In fact, Guo Hongjiang’s horse racing had gone beyond the pursuit of the average citizen. It was a bit like the foreign horse racing culture that MA Xiong had mentioned. Guo Hongjiang treated horse racing as an entertainment and social occasion. He would chat with his friends about horses and enjoy the races.

As for how much profit and prize money horse racing could bring him, he really didn’t care. He was the king of real estate in Hong Kong, and the profit he made every minute was more than the profit of a horse race. Not to mention, if he casually talked about a business deal in the private room, the profit would be enough to buy ten “stars of Hong Kong.”

“Alright! You can place your bets directly in the private room! I’ll teach you!” Guo Hongjiang said happily.

Hong Kong’s horse racing had developed into a very mature industry. Now, people could place bets without being present.

The internet was so advanced that they could even accept overseas bets.

Of course, there was also a spacious indoor trading hall in the racecourse, where there was always a surging tide of people and busy staff.

Since Guo Hongjiang was in the private room of the chairman of the horse racing Association, he could naturally place his bets at will.

Guo Hongjiang brought Xia ruofei to a device that looked like a karaoke machine and started to operate it on the touch screen.
