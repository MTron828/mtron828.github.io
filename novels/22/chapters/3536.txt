song zhilan couldn’t help but sink a little and said,””xiao rui! the foundation of a relationship had to be cultivated, you don’t even know what the girl looks like, what her personality and temper are like, and you say you don’t have a foundation? you can try it out first, you’ll only know if it’s suitable after you try it out!”

elder song looked at song rui, but he didn’t say anything.

in fact, he wasn’t as angry as song zhilan. he was very clear that this grandson of his was always a yes – man in front of him. today, he dared to bravely express his opinion, although it was against the wishes of the elders, he still looked at song rui in a different light.

after song rui said those words, it was as if a big stone in his heart had been removed, he suddenly felt a lot more relaxed.

moreover, he was also going all out. after hearing song zhilan’s words, he directly stiffened his neck and said,””aunt, there’s no need for that! it’s meaningless, i can’t possibly like this li hongyan, because…because…because i already have someone i like, we are very in love!”

song rui finally overcame his fear of his grandfather and told him the truth.

his last sentence was almost shouted out. after that, he seemed to have lost all his strength, he leaned back in his chair and panted a few times, then he grabbed the glass on the table and drank it all in one gulp. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

song rui put down the empty glass and sat on his seat with his chin raised, looking as if he could do whatever he wanted.

the expression on song zhilan’s face turned a little ugly, she didn’t think that her nephew would be so bold and dare to speak to her in such a tone, what was even more infuriating was that he had actually secretly dated someone outside.

song zhilan could tell that this time, song rui was seriously in love and not the kind of person who was just putting on a show.

elder song had been silent, he looked at song rui with interest, who seemed to have become a stranger, after a while, he smiled and asked,””xiao rui, you’re talking about… the young lady who works at the capital museum, right? if i remember correctly, her name is zhuo yiyi, right?”

song rui was stunned, he stared at elder song with wide eyes and muttered,””grandpa, you … you investigated me?”

Eccentric song laughed and waved his hand,”! don’t think it’s an investigation! But 1 have my own information channels, and your grandfather isn’t old and muddle – headed. He’s not completely oblivious to what’s happening outside. Don’t treat me like I’m deaf or blind, okay?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but find it funny. Elder song naturally didn’t know that Xia ruofei had such complicated thoughts. He was rather interested in the marriage partner that song Zhilan had found for song Rui. He couldn’t help but ask,”Zhilan, you’ve contacted the Li clan? Does the other party have the same intention?”

Song Zhilan slightly nodded and said,”dad!” Mr. Li Yifu is now living in seclusion and has very little contact with the outside world, so I couldn’t speak to him directly…”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,’my adopted husband is now on Peach Blossom Island. How long has it been since he returned to the United States? It would be a wonder if you could contact him!”

Song Zhilan continued,”however, li chenghui is still very interested in our proposal. If both parties have no objections, he can arrange for Li Hongyan to work in the branch company of the nine states group in Beijing. Our group still has a lot of business dealings with the nine states group. This way, Xiao Rui can also have more contact with Li Hongyan. After all, it’s a new era. Even if it’s a marriage alliance, it’s definitely necessary to let the young people get along first…”

“You’re right …”Eccentric song nodded.

Then, eccentric song pondered for a moment and said,””The Li family is still very influential in the United States, and in recent years, they have been increasing their investment in China. These patriotic Chinese have a lot of influence in China. If you marry them, it’s not a bad choice …”

The more song Rui listened, the more anxious he became. The situation was not good this time!

In the past, elder song did not approve or oppose song Rui’s marriage. He had seen song Rui’s various means of escape, but he did not say much.

But today, it seemed that even elder song agreed.

If elder song decided, song Rui would not even have the courage to resist.

He was so anxious that he could not help but look at Xia ruofei for help.

When song Rui looked at Xia ruofei, he saw a strange smile on Xia ruofei’s face. He seemed to be listening with great interest.

What did this brother mean? Don’t tell me he’s backing out? Then wouldn’t 1 be in deep trouble? Song Rui couldn’t help but curse silently.

Song Rui kept winking at Xia ruofei, but Xia ruofei ignored him. Song Rui coughed a few more times to attract Xia ruofei’s attention.

Unexpectedly, elder song noticed it before Xia ruofei did.

Eccentric song frowned and said,”Xiao Rui, why are you making eyes at me? What was he doing now? You’re not a child anymore, why are you still so immature?”

Song Rui quickly sat up straight and looked down, not daring to make any more unnecessary movements. However, he was scolding Xia ruofei in his heart for being too unreliable …

Xia ruofei then remembered the purpose of his trip. He smiled and said,””Xiao Rui, you should give your own opinion! This is your marriage!”

He knew that song Rui was terrified, especially in front of elder song. He did not dare to say anything but he did it on purpose. After all, this was song Rui’s own business. He still hoped that song Rui could express his opinion bravely. “Yeah!” Elder song nodded. Xiao Rui, what are you thinking? Tell me! I think this girl from the Li family is quite good. She’s a good match for you in all aspects…”

“It’s more than a match!” Song Zhilan smiled and said,”I’ve seen Li Hongyan’s resume. This girl is simply too outstanding. I even feel that our Xiao Rui is not worthy of her! Of course, the men of our song family are more than enough to match anyone. Moreover, Xiao Rui is getting more and more successful…”

Song Rui couldn’t help but feel depressed. Song Zhilan’s words, so he was just relying on his good family background! If he didn’t have the song family’s Halo, he wouldn’t be worthy of Miss Li! Am I that bad?

“Xiao Rui, tell me your opinion!” Xia ruofei said again.

This time, Xia ruofei even used a bit of his spiritual power.

Of course, song Rui was his friend. He wouldn’t use hypnosis on his friend. This trace of spiritual energy was mainly to affect song Rui’s emotions so that he could muster the courage to speak his mind.

Song Rui was not aware of Xia ruofei’s small actions, but he felt that he had become more courageous. He braced himself and said,””Grandpa, aunt, no matter who they are, 1 don’t want to marry them. They have no emotional Foundation at all. Everything is based on benefits. This is not what I want!”

Song Zhilan couldn’t help but sink a little and said,””Xiao Rui! The foundation of a relationship had to be cultivated. You don’t even know what the girl looks like, what her personality and temper are like, and you say you don’t have a Foundation? You can try it out first. You’ll only know if it’s suitable after you try it out!”

Elder song looked at song Rui, but he didn’t say anything.

In fact, he wasn’t as angry as song Zhilan. He was very clear that this grandson of his was always a yes – man in front of him. Today, he had the courage to express his opinion. Although it was against the wishes of the elders, he still looked at song Rui in a different light.

Moreover, he was also going all out. After hearing song Zhilan’s words, he directly stiffened his neck and said,””Aunt, there’s no need for that! It’s meaningless. I can’t like this Li Hongyan, because…Because…Because I already have a baby..
