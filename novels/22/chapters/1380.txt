That was why Lin Qiao cherished every moment she had with Xia ruofei.

He had just taken a quick shower and then ran over.

Xia ruofei stepped aside and said,””You didn’t take a nap at noon. There are still about an hour before dinner time. You should take a nap ...”

“I’m not sleepy!” Lin Qiao walked into Xia ruofei’s room.

Her hair brushed past Xia ruofei’s nose with the fragrance of shampoo. Even though Xia ruofei only treated Lin Qiao as his sister, he could not help but feel his heart flutter.

Lin Qiao came to Xia ruofei’s bed and sat down. She said coyly,”Brother ruofei, can you help me dry my hair? My hair is too long, I can’t dry it myself ...”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,””Good, good, good! I’ll serve you!”

“Hehe! You’re the best!” Lin Qiao said happily.

Xia ruofei walked to the bathroom and found the hairdryer from the cabinet under the sink. He then returned to the bed and plugged the hairdryer into the socket behind the bedside cabinet.

Xia ruofei said,”Qiao’ er, come closer!” This line isn’t long enough!”

“I know!” Lin Qiao moved closer to the head of the bed and smiled at Xia ruofei.”Thank you, brother ruofei!”

Xia ruofei took off his slippers and got on the bed. He sat cross – legged behind Lin Qiao and turned on the hairdryer to dry Lin Qiao’s hair.

In order to heat evenly, he slowly moved the hair dryer while grabbing his hair with his hands.

Lin Qiao felt a warm breeze blowing at her and Xia ruofei’s hand carefully grabbing her hair. Her heart seemed to be filled with warmth.

Her eyes became a little dazed. All of this was like an illusion. It was the scene that she often constructed in her mind when her imagination ran wild, and it really happened. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Lin Qiao felt a little shy and nervous at the same time. She was worried that Xia ruofei would notice something wrong, so she sat still and did not dare to move. Even her neck was a little stiff.

After a while, Xia ruofei gently stroked Lin Qiao’s hair and said,””It’s almost dried! Qiao’ er, wait a moment, I’ll go get you that comb!”

“En!” Lin Qiao said softly.

She didn’t turn around, but when she heard Xia ruofei’s footsteps to the bathroom and then back to the bed, her heart was filled with sweetness.

Even if it was just an illusion, I’m satisfied ... Lin Qiao thought.

Lin Qiao took the comb from Xia ruofei and gently combed her hair. Xia ruofei went over to make a cup of tea and sat on the chair opposite Lin Qiao, drinking it slowly.

The two of them did not speak, but the atmosphere was warm.

At Sixo’ clock in the evening, everyone returned to the hotel and went to the restaurant for dinner.

Zhao Yongjun and the others were very satisfied with the arrangements for their trips to Egret Island and Gulangyu. This quiet and comfortable Island was perfect for people like them who had a lot of social activities and an irregular life to come here and recuperate. Even sitting by the sea in a daze felt quite comfortable.

Zhao Yongjun laughed.”Ruofei, no wonder there are so many sanatorium on Gulangyu. There are military ones and local ones. This Island is really great!”

Hou Liang also had a look of yearning on his face as he said,”If I can buy a small island overseas, even if it’s smaller than Gulangyu, and make it my private territory, that’ll be great! By the way, once you buy an overseas Island, you’ll have permanent property rights! I can modify it however I want ...”

Song Rui joked,”among us, only RUO Fei has a chance of achieving such an achievement!” We can only count on the Xia tycoon to work hard to earn money! When the time comes, you can buy a small island, and we can also bask in the glory and occasionally go on vacation!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei chimed in.”I’ll develop a Resort Hotel. You can get a 20% discount if you want to stay here!”

Song Rui said exaggeratedly,”we’re on such good terms, yet you’re still taking money?” It should be free food and accommodation, and all kinds of free food, drinks, and entertainment!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”it’s not good to talk about relationships.” The island is so expensive, how can I recover my cost if I don’t charge!”

“So you’re just relying on your bro to spend and let you recover your costs!” Song Rui said.

Lin Qiao found it very interesting that Xia ruofei and the others were quarreling over a so – called private island that had not been seen yet. She couldn’t help but purse her lips and laugh.

......

While Xia ruofei and the rest were having a good time at the seaside villa Hotel on Gulangyu, the capital was not peaceful.

Of course, the upper – Class politics were as calm as ever. The “not calm” here was mainly in the circle of young rich people.

The noble clubhouse was a pretty good red wine – themed clubhouse in the capital, and a small banquet was being held there.

A young man in a full Armani casual suit was holding a glass of red wine. He had a charming smile on his face and would raise his glass to greet his friends from afar.

His name was Wang Jie, and he was quite famous in the circle of Playboys. Of course, his level was much lower than Zhao Yong Jun and the others, and his circle of contact was only limited to some second and third generation.

Wang Jie was smiling and chatting with a girl in an evening dress. From the corner of his eye, he saw a tall young man who had just entered the door. He immediately politely apologized to the girl and then went up to him with a glass of wine.

“Brother Rui, why are you so late?” Wang Jie smiled and greeted.

“There’s another match that just ended!” Brother Rui clinked his glass with Wang Jie and smiled.”Are there any pretty girls tonight?”

The person who was called “brother Rui” by Wang Jie was called Li Rui. Like Wang Jie, he was also one of the more senior nouveau riche in their circle. The difference was that the profitability of Li Rui’s own company was not bad. His economic strength was considered to be among the top group of people.

In a situation where the status and background were similar, the economic foundation often determined the status, so Li Rui was still relatively prestigious in their circle, and many people respectfully called him “brother Rui.”

Of course, if it was an ordinary low – Level official or businessman, they would inevitably call him “young master Li”.

Wang Jie and Li Rui walked together to the seats in the corner of the hall. On the way, they nodded and greeted their friends from time to time.

After he sat down, Li Rui asked,””Jie, what’s the matter?”

Wang Jie looked around and asked in a low voice,””Brother Rui, have you heard about what happened to Tian Xiaojun?”

A strange light flashed in Li Rui’s eyes, and then he regained his calm.

“I heard about it from someone else, what’s the matter?” he said indifferently.

Wang Jie laughed and said,”I witnessed the whole thing. I don’t know what’s wrong with this Tian Lao er. He didn’t even care about his face. He even called a group of friends to gather and told them all about his embarrassing story. He even said it as a reminder to everyone. It’s really funny ...”

Li Rui glanced at Wang Jie and said,””Jie, there must be a reason for this abnormality. Have you considered the deeper reason?”

Wang Jie said indifferently,””Do you still need to ask? Tian Xiaojun must have been scared out of his wits! However, this kid was originally timid. After all, he was not a native of the capital! She’s from a small place and can’t be put on stage!”

Li Rui picked up his glass and took a sip of red wine. He didn’t comment on Wang Jie’s evaluation of Tian Xiaojun.

Wang Jie looked around and continued,””Brother Rui, I really didn’t notice this paradise company if we didn’t talk about Tian Xiaojun. I did a special check this afternoon, and this company is really good at making money! The jaded skin cream was selling like hotcakes! It’s like opening a money – printing factory!”

Li Rui glanced at Wang Jie and said,””Jie, if you want to say something, just be direct. Is there any point in beating around the bush with me?”

Wang Jie laughed drily.”Brother Rui, I was thinking ... Just because Tian Xiaojun, that coward, returned in defeat, it doesn’t mean that our teeth are bad. This is a company with an annual output value of at least two billion. The most rare thing is that it’s a small company in the countryside. We ...”

“Stop!” Before Wang Jie could finish, he was ruthlessly interrupted by Li Rui.

He looked at Wang Jie coldly and said,””Jie, if you want to die, don’t drag me down with you!”
