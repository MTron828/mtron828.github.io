44  Attending the banquet (1)

    Xia ruofei got up and went to the villa's garage. He put all the new vegetables he had prepared in the morning into the spirit map space and watered the succulents in the space pool.

  After leaving the spirit map space, Xia ruofei saw that it was still early, so he drove back to San Shan city and went straight to the seed company.

  He bought some new vegetable seeds, which were still the same as before. At the same time, he also bought some pumpkin, radish, and Chinese yam seeds.

  Although Xia ruofei's cooperation with Ling's restaurant had been temporarily thwarted because of he Dong's interference, the plan to expand the planting still had to be implemented. Xia ruofei even planned to explore ways to plant vegetables in the outside world without greatly reducing the quality.

  Therefore, he bought more seeds this time to avoid running to the seed company again and again. After all, the spirit map space had an amazing preservation function.

  Then, Xia ruofei found a chain supermarket and bought some pork, beef, ribs, and other ingredients. He was ready to bring them back to the holiday villa to eat super vegetables. Although it was good, Xia ruofei could not stand not having meat every day.

  Especially after absorbing the flower petals, his body's absorption ability seemed to have improved a lot. His appetite was much larger than before. Xia ruofei knew that it was best to eat beef and mutton every day as it would help with muscle growth.

  After buying the things, Xia ruofei drove back.

  When the car was about to reach the holiday villa, he received a call from Wu Liqian.

  Wu Liqian had told him that professor Tian had been discharged from the hospital, and Tian Huilan wanted to treat him to dinner tonight.

  Since they had already agreed to it, Xia ruofei did not reject and agreed immediately.

  However, when Wu Liqian offered to send a car to pick him up, he politely declined. He said that it was not so troublesome and that he could go directly by himself.

  Xia ruofei was Tian Huilan's distinguished guest. Since he insisted on not having a car pick him up, Wu Liqian could only let him be. After a few polite words, she told him that she would send him the location of the meal later.

  After the call, Xia ruofei placed his phone on the dashboard and continued to drive. Not long after, his phone beeped with a text message notification, but Xia ruofei did not look at it and continued to drive seriously.

  Back at the holiday villa, Xia ruofei put all the beef, mutton, and seeds into the spirit map space. With this magical space, the refrigerator in the house was basically just a decoration. At most, it could be used as a cover when there were guests.

  After keeping his things, Xia ruofei turned on his phone. The text message was from Wu Liqian.

  The dinner location was at a rather famous private club in San Shan city called "West River moon."

  Xia ruofei took a look at the message and suddenly had a flash of inspiration. He had a brilliant idea ...

  ……

  At around 5 pm, Xia ruofei left the villa in his pickup.

  There was a small vegetable basket in the front passenger seat of his car. There was a large amount of spinach, a few tomatoes, and a few eggplants in it.

  These were the new vegetables that Xia ruofei had picked out from the spirit map space in the afternoon. He brought these vegetables to the banquet and naturally had a complete plan in his heart.

  The "West River moon" club was located in the 5A scenic area in the city center, San Fang Qi Street. It was an ancient building complex, and several ancient alleys ran through it.

  Cars were not allowed in the entire area. Hence, Xia ruofei found a parking lot outside the area and parked the pickup. Then, he carried his basket and walked into the area.

  The club was located in the yellow Lane in the center of the scenic Area. It was transformed from an old house that occupied a large area. The overall style was antique and full of oriental charm.

  The appointed time was 6 O' clock. When Xia ruofei arrived at the West River Moon Club at around 5:50, he found Wu Liqian already waiting at the door.

  "Sis Wu!" Xia ruofei walked up quickly with a smile on his face.

  "Little Xia is here!" Wu Liqian smiled and said,"please come in! Mayor Tian and professor Tian have already arrived!"

  "How can I let the mayor wait for me? "I'm so sorry ..."Xia ruofei said.

  "It's nothing. You're the guest today!" Wu Liqian said with a smile as she led the way.

  "West River moon" club maintained the style of an ancient building. Everything had the original antique flavor. The lattice windows, cloisters, and exquisitely carved cornices made people feel as if they had gone through time.

  Soon, the two of them arrived at the door of an elegant private room. Just as Wu Liqian was about to knock on the door, Xia ruofei stopped her and said,"

  "Sis Wu, I brought some new vegetables that my friend cultivated. Can I trouble you to ask the kitchen to use these ingredients to cook a few dishes? I would like professor Tian and Mayor Tian to try it together. "

  Wu Liqian was stunned for a moment, but she immediately smiled and said,"

  "Of course, no problem!"

  Then, she said to the waiter at the door,"

  "Please invite your President Zheng over!"

  "Alright!"

  The waiter quickly said a few words through the walkie - talkie, and a few minutes later, a fat man in a suit rushed over with a humble smile on his face. He greeted them from afar,"

  "Director Wu, do you have any orders?"

  Wu Liqian told President Zheng about Xia ruofei's request, and President Zheng agreed to ask the customers to bring the ingredients for processing. It was a common thing, but usually, the other customers would bring rare and precious ingredients, while Xia ruofei only took some vegetables.

  Xia ruofei passed the basket to President Zheng and smiled."

  "Then I'll have to trouble you, President Zheng!"

  President Zheng quickly said that he didn't deserve it. Then, he greeted them and personally brought the vegetable basket to the kitchen.

  Wu Liqian walked to the door of the private room and knocked on it gently. Then, she pushed the door open and gestured for Xia ruofei to enter.

  Xia ruofei smiled and nodded at Wu Liqian. Then, he walked in and Wu Liqian followed him into the private room.

  The private room was not too big and the decorations looked very ordinary. However, there was a hint of low - Key luxury in the ordinary. Even Xia ruofei, who did not know much about these things, could tell that the unassuming furniture and decorations in the private room were expensive.

  Tian Huilan was accompanying her father as they made tea. When they saw Xia ruofei enter, professor Tian immediately stood up personally. Naturally, Tian Huilan also stood up.

  "Young man, I've finally found you!" Professor Tian laughed and said,"if I didn't have a daughter who is a Mayor, I might never have found you again!"

  Xia ruofei hurried to the two of them and said,"

  "Professor Tian, I really didn't do much that day. You don't have to be so polite ..."

  Tian Huilan smiled and said,

  "Little Xia, my father taught me since I was young that a drop of kindness should be repaid with a spring, let alone a life - saving grace."

  "Yup! Now, when many people see an old man fall to the ground, they avoid him like the plague!" Professor Tian sighed,"under such circumstances, little Xia stepped forward bravely and even displayed her miraculous hands of rejuvenation. I owe her a great debt of gratitude!"

  "I don't dare!" Xia ruofei quickly said,"professor Tian, you're being too serious!"

  "Hahaha!" Professor Tian laughed heartily and said,"little Xia, there aren't many young people like you these days! You have to accompany me for a drink or two today!"

  Then, professor Tian furrowed his brows and turned to Tian Huilan."

  "By the way, why hasn't Youyou arrived yet?"

  Tian Huilan quickly said, Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

  "She just texted me that she was delayed by something at school. She's already on her way and should be here soon ..."

  Professor Tian showed an unhappy expression and said,"

  "I already told her to get there before six, but it's already five past six! Why doesn't this child have any sense of time?"

  At this moment, a young girl's voice came from the door,"

  "Grandpa, you're talking bad about me again!"
