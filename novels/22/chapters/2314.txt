Feng Jing stopped the car beside Xia ruofei and stuck her head out.””Ruofei, get in the car!”

Xia ruofei chuckled as he opened the door to the passenger’s seat and sat in. He fastened his seatbelt and said,”Sister che, it’s all thanks to you. Otherwise, I would have to walk to the entrance of the community to hail a taxi!”

The villa district was huge. Xia ruofei’s and Feng Jing’s Villa was near the river, so it was quite far from the entrance of the district.

Feng Rao glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””Why does the chairman look so pitiful? Why don’t you just call the company and ask them to send a car over?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”I don’t like to make a big fuss. Besides, it’s only a few steps away!”

Feng Jing knew Xia ruofei’s personality, so she didn’t say much. Instead, she asked,””To the company?”

Xia ruofei laughed drily and said,””Um ... I’m not going to the company today. Sister che, if you’re not busy, can you take me to the military general Hospital? If you’re in a hurry, just drop me off at the entrance and I’ll take a taxi!”

Initially, Feng Jing was a little unhappy when she heard that Xia ruofei wasn’t going to the company. However, when she heard that Xia ruofei was going to the hospital, she immediately asked with concern,””To the hospital? What’s wrong? Are you feeling uncomfortable?”

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”no!” No! You’ve misunderstood ... An elder is in the hospital, I have to go and see him ... In fact, I rushed back from Beijing for this matter, and the matter in Beijing was not over yet!”

Song Qiming’s identity was sensitive, so Xia ruofei did not explain it clearly. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Feng Jing, but the fewer people who knew about this matter, the better. Furthermore, it had nothing to do with Feng Jing, so there was no need to clarify things. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“You’re the boss, you don’t have to explain anything to me!”Feng Jing chuckled. By the way, is your elder alright? Do you need any help? The company will have no problem providing manpower and work!”

“No need, no need. I can handle it myself!” Xia ruofei said,”you’ve done me a great favor by sorting out the mess in the company.”

“Don’t worry about that!”Feng Rao giggled. Even if you didn’t say so, everyone would have done their own job, because we’re all used to it ...”

Xia ruofei touched his nose in embarrassment and asked,””By the way, how’s the company doing recently?”

“Everything’s normal!”Feng Rao shrugged. All the businesses are doing well, and I’m a lot more relaxed as the president. By the way, although you rarely appear as the chairman a few times a year, you’ve always spent a lot of money!”

Xia ruofei knew that Feng Jing was talking about the acquisition of miles Pharmaceutical Group. He smiled and said,””Of course! It’s my own company, how can I not be concerned? That’s why we can’t just look at the surface of things!”

“Stop! Stop! Other people might not understand you, but I do. ” Feng Jing said,”but the acquisition of miles Corporation was really well done! Not only did the company’s net assets double directly, but the most important thing was that it made up for the limitations of their own development, greatly promoting the company’s most competitive business development. Everyone was full of energy like a shot in the arm! Especially the pharmaceutical factory, their morale is unprecedented!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s good!” By the way, did the takeover of miles go smoothly?”

After Xia ruofei handed this task to Dong Yun, he did not ask about it personally. When he was in the capital, he would occasionally call to find out. These two days, he had been busy with song Qiming’s matter and naturally did not have time to care about other things.

“It’s going rather smoothly overall. The foreign aid you’ve invited is very strong, and President Dong is personally overseeing the situation, so it’s not a big problem,”said Feng Jing. “The asset audit will be done very soon, and President Dong will come up with a plan to take over. A portion of miles ‘management will be a team sent by the original shareholders, and they’ll all leave. The rest will still need to be inspected and screened. In short, it’s a very cumbersome work.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”this task is indeed complicated, but it must be done well. I don’t have any time limit for the full takeover of miles Corporation. The only requirement is safety. In terms of personnel, especially the senior management, we can’t let any sand get in!”

Feng Rao knew how important the pharmaceutical factory’s business was, and she knew how serious the consequences would be if someone with ulterior motives were to sneak in. So, she immediately said seriously,””I understand! RUO Fei, don’t worry! I’ve already emphasized this matter to President Dong, and she’s taking it very seriously. In addition, I’m going to put aside the work at hand for a while and find time to fly over and personally follow up for a few days!”

“Sister che, I’ll leave it to you then!” Xia ruofei nodded.

“You’re still so polite with me!” Feng Rao glanced at Xia ruofei and said coyly.

The woman in her early 30s exuded a mature charm. Xia ruofei looked at Feng Rao’s coquettish demeanor and couldn’t help but be stunned. He quickly looked away and said,””It’s all good news. Is the company facing any difficulties? Sister che, don’t just tell me the good news and not the bad news!”

“Speaking of difficulties ... Of course there are.” The biggest difficulty was the lack of talent! “The company has been expanding at a high speed, and every team is basically in a state of shortage of people. Now, you’ve made a big satellite and acquired such a large Pharmaceutical Group all of a sudden. Moreover, many of the original management can’t be retained, so we have a huge shortage of personnel here, especially management talents.”

Xia ruofei said,”I don’t have any good ideas for now. You’ll have to overcome it on your own!” If you don’t have enough people, then contact a headhunting company. The company doesn’t lack the salary, so we can’t let everyone work too much. ”

“That’s true,” Feng Jing said.”It’s just that the current situation is that our recruitment speed can’t keep up with the company’s expansion speed. The Human Resources Department is also working overtime all year round because there are too many people applying for employment ...”

Feng Rao smiled bitterly and said,””As soon as I received the news that we’ve acquired miles, apart from arranging for CEO Dong to take over, I immediately got human resources to start recruiting. However, it’s easy to recruit ordinary employees, but it’s not so easy to recruit middle – Management. But don’t worry, it’s only temporary. I’ve already told the pharmaceutical factory that after taking over miles Corporation, they have to be mentally prepared for hard work. After this difficult period, it’ll be much better in the future. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”everyone has worked hard. We can’t let our employees ‘hard work go to waste. We should give them a bigger year – end bonus this year. This is a year of rapid development for the company. We must let our employees enjoy the benefits of the company’s rapid development.”

“Mm! I’ll think about the year – end bonus plan and send it to your email. ” Feng ke said.

Xia ruofei continued,”regarding the problem of talent shortage, I think we should also look for talents from within other than recruiting from the outside. The old employees are all working hard to grow with the company. We should increase the intensity of talent training.”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but let his thoughts wander as he continued,””In addition, our company is no longer a nobody. We can contact some well – known universities. As long as it’s a major that is suitable for our business, we can jointly train it! As long as a student signs an employment intention with us, our company will give a certain bursary allowance during the school period. Also, I think we can imitate other companies and set up a management training system internally. We can choose some employees with potential and give priority to training them. We can consciously let them experience more positions to speed up the growth of talents. ”

Management Trainees were Management Trainees. In foreign companies, it was a special project with the main goal of “training the company’s future leaders”. Many young executives in internet companies had grown up from Management Trainees.

“I was just about to report to you, ruofei!” Feng Rao nodded. Many of your ideas are in line with mine! Our company has developed to the scale it is today, it’s time to build a talent reserve!”
