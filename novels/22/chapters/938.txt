Chapter 939: Directly peed in his pants from fright (1)

Translator: 549690339

Lin Qiao was beaming with joy when she saw Xia ruofei’s impressive performance. She was like a fan who had met her idol.

However, the next moment, when she saw Yamada Jiro suddenly pull out a pistol and point the black muzzle at Xia ruofei, she turned pale and could not help but scream.

“Brother ruofei!” Lin Qiao’s voice trembled in panic.

Yamada Jiro looked toward the source of the voice and saw Lin Qiao in the crowd, who looked worried and scared.

Lin Qiao was dressed like a flower Fairy today, full of the delicate and moving aura of a young girl. At this time, her face was full of fear and she had a temperament that made people pity her.

Yamada Jiro’s eyes glowed with lust. He thought he had the situation under control and laughed,””Chinese, so what if you’re angry? So what if you’re good at fighting? Can you still be faster than a bullet? I’d like to know if you can already smell the scent of death. In Mr. Tang Hu’s territory, the death of a small shrimp like you won’t even cause a wave. Do you feel very scared? Hahaha!”

“Are you done?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

“No, no, no! Don’t worry, I won’t kill you so quickly!” Yamada Jiro said proudly. He then looked at Lin Qiao and said,”your female companion seems to be worried about you! I think I’ll be able to enjoy the bodies of two Chinese beauties tonight. I’m looking forward to it! I’ll let you watch how I ravage them and let you watch a free erotic show before sending you on your way, hahaha ...”

Yamada Jiro laughed insolently and looked at Lin Qiao with a playful look.

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with murderous intent. His voice was emotionless as he said coldly,””As I said just now, I hate being pointed at with a gun, but ... I hate people coveting my woman even more. Unfortunately, you’ve committed both crimes, so ...”

As Xia ruofei said this, he suddenly stomped on the ground like a spring, and then his figure flashed strangely. Almost in the blink of an eye, he appeared beside Yamada Jiro. His right hand was like an iron clamp, gripping Yamada Jiro’s wrist that was holding the gun.

Yamada Jiro’s face still had that wild smile on it. Xia ruofei’s movements were so fast that he had no time to react. He only saw a blur before Xia ruofei disappeared. Then, he felt his wrist being grabbed by Xia ruofei.

Yamada Jiro’s smile instantly froze. Was he still human? The distance of five to six meters was covered in the blink of an eye, and he couldn’t even pull the trigger subconsciously.

Before Yamada Jiro’s fear overwhelmed him, he heard a crack. He was stunned for a moment, then felt a piercing pain in his wrist. He couldn’t help but scream. His hand loosened weakly, and the pistol fell to the ground.

Xia ruofei’s toes lightly touched the pistol that was about to fall to the ground. It immediately spun and flew up. He reached out to catch it easily and glanced at it casually.

“You didn’t even unlock the safety. I’ve overestimated you ...” Xia ruofei pouted.

“Wow ...”

“My God!”

All kinds of exclamations sounded one after another. The scene of Xia ruofei’s explosive speed was like a special effect from a movie. However, they knew that it was reality and not a movie. Xia ruofei’s ghostly figure was deeply engraved in their minds.

Xia ruofei pulled the bolt and loaded the bullet. He then pointed the black muzzle at Yamada Jiro’s forehead and said gloomily,””Now, with a slight movement of my finger, you’ll be able to see your dear Tenshou God. Japanese, are you looking forward to it?”

Yamada Jiro felt his hair stand on end. He even forgot the pain of his wrist fracture and quickly begged for mercy,””Don ‘t! I don’t want to die ... Have mercy ... Please have mercy ...”

Xia ruofei sneered and kicked Yamada Jiro’s leg without hesitation. Yamada Jiro knelt on the ground involuntarily.

“Can you apologize to my fellow countrymen now?” Xia ruofei asked indifferently.

“Sure, sure ...” Yamada Jiro said hurriedly, then turned to tan Lili.””Madam, I’m sorry. I harassed you just now. I apologize ...”

“What else?” Xia ruofei asked coldly.

Yamada Jiro was stunned for a moment. Then, he remembered that he seemed to have some bad thoughts about this demon – like Chinese’s girlfriend. He even said that he wanted to have both of them together. He suddenly wanted to slap himself.

Yamada Jiro quickly turned to Lin Qiao and put her down. He said with a sad face,””Madam, I was possessed. Please forgive me ...” He said.

Then, he turned to Xia ruofei and pleaded,””Sir, I’ve already realized my mistake. Please spare my life!”

Xia ruofei snorted coldly. He pushed the gun in his hand forward and made a “pa” sound.

Yamada Jiro shrieked in fear. Then he felt his lower abdomen relax, and a warm liquid flowed out uncontrollably. Suddenly, everyone in the hall could smell the strong smell of urine. They could not help but frown and cast a disdainful look at Yamada Jiro.

Yamada Jiro, who had been so arrogant just a moment ago, had become a coward in the blink of an eye. Many farm owners and winery owners were secretly pleased. After all, Yamada Jiro was too arrogant just now.

Of course, many people were worried about Xia ruofei. Tonight’s incident would not end well. If Xia ruofei really killed Yamada Jiro in front of everyone, he would definitely not be able to escape from prison. If he spared Yamada Jiro’s life, with the relationship between Yamada Jiro and Tang Hu, he would definitely deal with him in a thunderous way. He would not have a good ending either.

Liang Qichao and Lin Qiao were undoubtedly the most worried.

When Lin Qiao heard Xia ruofei say that she was his woman, she couldn’t help but feel a hint of sweetness even though she knew that Xia ruofei was saying this to an outsider.

However, Lin Qiao quickly returned to reality and realized that Xia ruofei’s situation was not good. Her eyes were filled with worry.

However, Xia ruofei seemed to be completely unaware of the predicament he was about to face. He still looked indifferently at Yamada Jiro, who was kneeling in front of him, without any emotion in his eyes.

Yamada Jiro shivered. The strong killing intent in Xia ruofei’s eyes made him realize that the person in front of him was not trying to scare him. If he made a move, Xia ruofei would pull the trigger without hesitation.

……

Just as Yamada Jiro insolently ordered his bodyguards to capture tan Lili, Tang Yitian and his wife, Jennifer, were sitting on the sofa and chatting in a separate villa room of Spicer Vineyard Hotel. Their son, Tang Haoran, was playing happily on the side.

Tang Yitian’s family arrived at the Hunter Valley in the evening.

Little Haoran had been asking to see ruofei’s brother for the past few days, and Tang Yitian and Jennifer wanted Xia ruofei to treat little Haoran to completely eliminate the hidden danger, so they came to the Hunter Valley together.

However, Tang Yitian had been delayed for half a day in the morning due to company matters. It was almost evening when they arrived at the Hunter Valley. It was obviously impolite to visit Xia ruofei at this time.

In addition, the quarterly reception of the New South Wales branch of the Maya Group in Hunter Valley was also held today. Although Tang Yitian usually wouldn’t attend this level of cocktail party in the past, since today was a coincidence and his nephew Tang Hu warmly invited him, he decided to attend.

Tang Yitian sat on the sofa, still thinking about the scene when he visited elder Xu two days ago.

Elder Xu was the senior that Tang Yitian had told Xia ruofei about on the plane.

Tang Yitian’s father came to Australia to make a living when he was very young. Later, he joined the overseas Hong sect’s Australian branch, the Kongtong righteous Association, and became the leader of the Association when he was 60 years old.

And elder Xu was also one of the founding members of the Association, an elder that Tang Yitian respected very much.

When elder Xu heard from Tang Yitian that he had met a young man on the plane back to Australia, and that the young man had told him about little Haoran’s blocked meridians, a strange light flashed in his eyes, and he quickly asked for more details.

Tang Yitian didn’t dare to be slow, so he told elder Xu everything that had happened on the plane.

When elder Xu heard that Xia ruofei could actually resolve the innate pure Yang Qi in little Haoran’s body, and that he only needed to undergo one more treatment to completely remove the hidden danger, he was so shocked that he stood up from his chair.

Then, he immediately did another divination, and his eyes shone as he said,””He has indeed defied the heavens and changed his fate! Yi Tian, it seems that the last chance of survival that I calculated, fell on this Mr. Xia!”

“Uncle Xu, I think so too.” Tang Yitian said respectfully.

Elder Xu looked at Tang Yitian with a strange expression and said,””Yi Tian! I can’t believe you’re so lucky that you’ve even met such a strange person like Mr. Xia. I’ll give you a reminder! No matter what, don’t treat this Mr. Xia as an ordinary young man. Maintain absolute respect for him. It will only be good for you. ”

Tang Yitian was also moved. He didn’t need elder Xu’s reminder. He would also maintain a good relationship with Xia ruofei, because Xia ruofei was his son’s Savior.

However, respect and friendship were two completely different concepts.

Elder Xu looked at Tang Yitian and asked indifferently,””Do you think I’m exaggerating?”

“I don’t dare ...” Tang Yitian laughed.

“You don’t dare to or you don ‘t?” Elder Xu stared at Tang Yitian and asked. He didn’t wait for Tang Yitian’s reply and continued,”let me tell you something. You’ll understand why I suggested this to you ...” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Uncle Xu, please advise me!” Tang Yitian said respectfully.
