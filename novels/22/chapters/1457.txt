Translator: 549690339

“Yup!” Guan Ping asked,”what’s the matter?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I just feel that it’s a little familiar. I think I’ve heard it before. I can’t remember where ...”

Pang Hao chuckled and said,”where else have I heard of this?” Hiroshi must have told you about it!”

“It wasn’t Hiroshi who said it.” Xia ruofei said,”I’m thinking ...”

Seeing this, pang Hao smiled and said,”take your time to think about it!” Hiroshi, let’s have a drink! Don’t worry too much, you can just resign and leave! Even if I can’t stay here, there will be a place for me to stay!”

With that, pang Hao even winked at Xia ruofei.

Naturally, Guan Ping knew what pang Hao meant. However, he only smiled faintly and clinked his cup with pang Hao ‘s, saying,””Let’s drink!”

At this moment, Xia ruofei suddenly stood up and said,””Little fatty, ping Zi, you guys take your time to drink. I’ll go out and make a call ...”

“Hurry up and come back!” Pang Hao said,”don’t even think about hiding from the alcohol!”

“Don’t worry!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the two of you together are no match for me. Do I need to hide from the alcohol?”

“You can continue bragging!” Pang Hao said,”we’re all classmates who know each other well. How can I not know your alcohol tolerance?”

“Ruofei might have trained his alcohol tolerance in the Army!” Guan Ping chuckled from the side.

“That can’t be that powerful!” Pang Hao said stubbornly.

Xia ruofei chuckled as he walked out of the food stall with his phone. He stood by the side of the road and called Liang Qichao, who was far away in Australia.

The phone rang four or five times before Liang Qichao picked it up. His voice was full of helplessness.”My boss Xia ... Did you know that there’s a time difference between Australia and China? Do you have any important instructions for calling so late?”

Xia ruofei was stunned and quickly apologized.””I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I forgot ...”

Xia ruofei looked at his watch and said,””Brother Liang, it seems that Australia is only three hours faster than China! In other words, it’s not even 10 O’ clock at your place right now. You’re sleeping so early? I know! I must have disturbed you, right? Tell me the truth, is there someone else on your bed? Isn’t it Daphne?”

Liang Qichao said guiltily,”can’t you be a little healthier?” Do you think that this place is like China where people party every night? It’s frighteningly quiet in Hunter Valley when it’s dark. What else can I do if I don’t sleep?”

Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”that’s hard to say!” The Australian Ladies are so passionate, you can do a lot of things at night!”

Liang Qichao was a little angry.””Boss Xia, you’re not calling so late just to check on your post, are you? If there’s nothing else, I’m hanging up!”

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t, I have something to ask you!” Xia ruofei quickly said,”I’m not joking. I really have something to ask you!”

“What’s the matter? speak!”

“I remember that uncle Liang has invested in a real estate agency, right?” Xia ruofei asked,”what’s the company called again?”

“Xianfeng real estate!” Liang Qichao said. He didn’t invest much, only about 15% of the shares. It could be considered an industrial layout! Why are you suddenly asking this? You’re such a Big Boss, do you still need to buy a second – hand house?”

Although Liang Weimin’s jianda group was not considered a giant real estate development company in the country, he was deeply involved in the local market. In Sanshan city, or rather, in the southeast province, the industrial layout was still very well done.

From real estate development to the surrounding real estate, renovation, and even the real estate intermediary field, they had a large amount of investment. It could be said that they complemented each other.

For example, the real estate of jianda group would definitely be owned by their own company. If there were real estate agencies around the real estate, the best storefront would definitely be reserved for the pioneer real estate that jianda group had shares in.

In addition, the property company was also owned by the owner. If some owners had the intention to sell their houses, they would often know the news before their competitors.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s nothing. I just feel that the name of this company is a little familiar. It seems like uncle Liang mentioned it to me before.” Then ... I won’t disturb you any longer. If you’re not scared by the phone’s ringing, then continue!”

After that, Xia ruofei laughed and hung up the phone. He could faintly hear Liang Qichao scolding on the other end of the phone,””You F * cking ...”

After getting the answer, Xia ruofei walked back to the food stall.

He sat down and drank a cup of wine with Guan Ping. Then, he said seriously,”Pingzi, I have two ways to solve this problem of yours. It’s up to you.”

Pang Hao clapped his hands and laughed,”I knew RUO Fei wouldn’t just sit back and do nothing!” “Pingzi, you should have told RUO Fei about your matters earlier! But you’re too proud to resist ...”

Guan Ping looked at Xia ruofei and pang Hao gratefully and smiled,””RUO Fei, tell me about it first!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”the first option is to resign and leave.” I, Xia ruofei, didn’t have many friends in middle school. You and fatty are my best friends. Now that my company is developing well and you have experience in sales, how about you come to my company to help me after you resign? In terms of position, it might not be too high in the beginning, like a manager under the marketing department or e – commerce Department! You can bring your own team. ”

Now that paradise Corporation was getting bigger and bigger, the management was also moving towards the standard aspect, especially after the implementation of the personnel ranking system. Even if Guan Ping was Xia ruofei’s good friend, he couldn’t start off too high when he first joined; otherwise, it would be a little unfair to the employees who were promoted step by step.

Moreover, Guanping would easily attract criticism, and it would be difficult to carry out his work.

Xia ruofei did not want his company to grow to such a scale and become a family business.

He believed that as long as Guan Ping had the ability, he would be able to rise above the rest.

Guan Ping was not surprised by Xia ruofei’s first suggestion. He smiled and said,””Ruofei, I’d like to hear your second plan.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”the second option is to stay at pioneer real estate!”

Hearing this, pang Hao couldn’t help but say,”ruofei, you can’t do that!” Didn’t you hear what Hiroko said? That woman is pressing us and using all sorts of methods to run Hirata. We can’t stay in this company anymore!”

Guan Ping laughed and said,”little fatty, let RUO Fei finish!” I think he must have his reasons for proposing this. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”Fatty, look at pingzi. He’s more composed than you. Don’t think that you’re the company’s leader now. If he comes to our company in the future, he might be better than you!”

“Alright, alright, alright ... Don’t keep me in suspense, just say it in one breath!” Pang Hao said gloomily.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”pingzi, if you want to stay at pioneer real estate, it’s not a problem. I can get a friend to help you talk to him. I promise that all these messy things will not disturb you in the future. You can focus on your career.”

Xia ruofei then looked into Guanping’s eyes and said,””There are two solutions. It’s up to you to choose!”

“Ruofei, thank you for being so thoughtful,” Guan Ping said gratefully.

“We’ve been brothers for a lifetime, so there’s no need to say such polite words. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Guan Ping nodded his head heavily,”Alright, then I won’t regard you as an outsider. However ... I might need to think about it carefully, and I can’t give you an answer now!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””I understand. After all, this is a matter of great importance. It’s better to think carefully and not make a hasty decision! Call me when you’re done thinking!”

“Alright!” Guan Ping said,”come, ruofei, let me toast you!”

“Let’s have the three of you together!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”didn’t Lil ‘fatty say he was going to get me drunk? Come at me!”

“Who’s afraid of who?” Pang Hao said,”don’t be fooled by the fact that you’re my boss now. I definitely won’t go easy on you!”

“Hahaha! Then let’s finish a bottle first!” Xia ruofei laughed and said.
