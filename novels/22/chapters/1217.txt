Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei was a little distracted after hearing MA Xiong’s words.

“Xia Sheng, is there ... Any difficulty?” MA Xiong asked tentatively.

Xia ruofei came back to her senses and hurriedly said,””Oh! No, no! Mr. MA, I should be able to get truffles, but I’m not sure how much I can get ...”

“It’s good that you can get it!” MA Xiong was overjoyed.”Xiasheng, how about we continue working together this year?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”of course, there’s no problem in cooperating!” However, I can’t be sure how many truffles I can get. How do you plan to cooperate, Mr. MA?”

Xia ruofei did not mention the quality of the truffles because he had absolute confidence in their quality. The only thing he was unsure of was whether the truffles in the mountain and sea realm had matured or how much they could be produced.

MA Xiong seemed to have more confidence in Xia ruofei. He laughed and said,”I have absolute trust in Xia Sheng’s ability. As long as you’re sure you can get truffles, there’s room for cooperation!”

MA Xiong pondered for a while before he continued,”Xia Sheng, I hope that we can organize our own truffle auction this year. If we have enough, we can use all of the truffles from paradise Corporation. We want fame, you guys can profit, and we’ll each take what we need!”

This wasn’t the first time they had worked together like this. It was the same for the one – headed abalone auction last time. Hengfeng group needed these top – Class ingredients to increase their influence, and Tao Yuan company also needed Hengfeng group’s powerful channels.

In addition to the considerable profits, the Paradise Corporation would also gain a huge reputation, which could be said to be a win – win situation.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate and nodded.””If the Commission rate for the auction is according to the market price, then I agree in principle!”

Xia ruofei said that not because he was worried that Hengfeng group would demand an exorbitant price. On the contrary, he was afraid that MA Xiong would give him a huge discount and not even charge him for the auction.

If Xia ruofei didn’t mention it, it was very likely because of his relationship with the MA family.

However, Xia ruofei felt that business was business. He didn’t want to have too many human relationships involved. If they had a good relationship, they could work together often, but the money would be the same. This way, he would not have any psychological pressure when working together in the future.

“Alright!” MA Xiong forced a smile. Xia Sheng, we’ll do as you say!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Mr. MA, I’ll contact you in the next few days to confirm the amount of truffles we can provide. Then, we’ll discuss the auction in detail. What do you think?”

“Alright, alright!” MA Xiong quickly said,”xiasheng, I’ll be waiting for your good news ...”

After hanging up, Xia ruofei stood up and looked down from the balcony.

In the yard, lightning, Blackie, fluffy one, fluffy two, and the rest were lazily basking in the sun. They were getting lazier and lazier. Other than going to the farm’s border a few times a day, the Veterans of the security Department could not order them around.

However, this was good as well. Xia ruofei would be able to do things more easily.

He stood on the balcony and whistled. The dogs, who were lazily lying in the sun, looked up at him at the same time. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xia ruofei smiled and waved at them, calling,””All of you, come up! All of you, come up!”

These dogs had already gained sentience and could understand Xia ruofei’s orders. As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, they immediately stood up and rushed into the villa.

Xia ruofei left the balcony and walked over to open the door.

Soon, he saw Blackie and lightning rush into the room, followed by fluffy one, fluffy two and the rest.

As soon as they entered the house, they all shook their heads and wagged their tails at Xia ruofei. Their expressions were quite intimate.

Xia ruofei touched their heads one by one and went to lock the door from the inside. He also locked the door and the window on the balcony and pulled the curtains.

With a thought, Xia ruofei summoned the spirit painting scroll from his palm.

Then, his mind power wrapped around lightning, Blackie, and the others. With a slight thought, he brought them into the mountain and sea realm of the spirit map space.

Lightning had only stayed in the spirit map space for a very short time, so she couldn’t help but be a little dazed when the environment changed so quickly.

Xiaohei, fluffy one, fluffy two, and the others had lived in the mountain and sea realm for a long time, so they were extremely familiar with this place. When they entered the spatial realm, they breathed in the air that was filled with spiritual Qi. They appeared to be very excited, and ran back and forth in the spatial realm.

Currently, the mountain sea realm had developed a large medicinal garden, as well as a living area for Hornets and an area for Cordyceps sinensis, which was surrounded by a net. Xia ruofei was worried that these mischievous dogs would run around and cause damage to these areas, so he hurriedly stopped them.

Xia ruofei called all the dogs to his side and brought them to the front of the oak Forest at the foot of the hill.

He pondered for a moment and contacted Xia Qing with his mind.

At this moment, Xia Qing was busy in the Archean realm. After receiving Xia ruofei’s orders, she quickly appeared in the mountain and sea realm and came before Xia ruofei.

He was holding two truffles in his hands, one big and one small. One was black truffle, and the other was white truffle.

These were all harvested at the beginning of the year. Xia ruofei had kept a small portion of it in his storage space. He had wanted to keep it for himself, but he was not used to the strange taste of truffles. He could not figure out how such a strange – tasting thing could be sold at such a sky – High price, so he had not touched it.
