2767 Reunion after a short separation (1) Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xia ruofei then explained some details to Ma Jia, including clothing, food, accommodation, and transportation. He was still very concerned about these veterans who came to seek refuge with him.

While the Veterans were in the three mountains, Lei Hu was in charge of coordinating all the security. As the temporary person in charge of the guards, ma su naturally had to intervene in this work.

After the two of them finished discussing work, Xia ruofei asked,””By the way, old company commander, when will sister – in – Law come over to meet you?”

“She has already submitted her resignation, but there are still some procedures to be done,” said Ma Jia. “You also know that this is how the system works. Even if she resigns, she can’t just leave as she wishes.” It might take another three or four days! She’ll go through the formalities and hand over the work ... In addition, she’ll have to make some arrangements at home. She should be able to meet up with us within a week. ”

Speaking of this, ma su asked,”ruofei, is it because the Peach Blossom Island is in a hurry to get people?” I can urge her. ”

Ma SU’s wife was a meteorological major, and Peach Blossom island’s airport happened to need meteorological personnel, so Xia ruofei had asked her to resign and come to work. This way, not only would they meet more people than before, but it would also solve the problem of the two places being separated.

Otherwise, if Ma Jia went all the way to peach source Island to work while her lover stayed in China, she would definitely have emotional problems after a long time.

Xia ruofei said,”I’ve already asked the staff who were originally on Peach Blossom Island to return to their countries. The airport is now closed. However, it’s a private airport and only our own planes can take off and land. It’s fine if it’s a few days later.” There isn’t even a tower supervisor on Peach Blossom Island now, but I can still take off and land my own plane. ”

“The weather is different!” Ma Jia said,”if there is bad weather that is not suitable for landing, and there is no weather forecast here, wouldn’t it be dangerous for the plane to fly over as usual? I’ll ask my wife to speed up and come over in two days!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and laughed.””I’m fine! It’s fine! I’ve asked our pilot and he said that meteorological data is indeed important, but there’s an airport near Peach Blossom Island where we can obtain meteorological data. It’s just that they can’t accurately predict the situation above our airport. It’s not a big problem, and it can be overcome in the short term. And to be honest, the number of flights taking off and landing at Taoyuan Airport is quite low, so don’t rush sister – in – Law over such a small matter. Let her deal with everything before coming over!”

Xia ruofei then added,””Of course, if you can’t wait to see your wife, so you’re using this reason to urge her to hurry up, then it’s a different story!”

“Nonsense!” Ma Jia laughed and scolded him,”am I that kind of person?”

“That’s hard to say ...” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

The two of them made tea and chatted in Xia ruofei’s Villa. When it was almost lunchtime, Ma Jia got up and left. He returned to the staff dormitory where the Veterans were staying and prepared to have lunch with them. Everything here was in accordance with the military management model. Before lunch, everyone had to line up and walk to the canteen. They also had to strictly implement the rule of singing before lunch.

After Xia ruofei entrusted the management of these veterans to Ma Jia, he did not stay at Taoyuan farm. He asked Lei Hu to send him back to the jiangbin villa in the city.

In the days that she had been away from the three mountains, Ling Qingxue had also arranged for some part – time cleaners to come over and clean the house, so it was very clean. There wasn’t a layer of dust because it had not been lived in for a long time.

After Xia ruofei returned home, he first checked the refrigerator in the kitchen, then took out some ingredients from the spirit map space and put them in the refrigerator. Then, he drove to the nearby Walmart to buy some ingredients that were not stored in the spirit map space.

After that, Xia ruofei started to get busy in the kitchen.

After a while, there was a knock on the villa’s door. Xia ruofei did not see anyone, but he heard Ling Qingxue’s cheerful voice.”It smells so good! Ruofei, what delicious food did you make?”

Before Xia ruofei came back, he had called Ling Qingxue and asked her to make time to go home in the afternoon so that the two could have lunch together.

This time, Xia ruofei had left for quite a long time. When Ling Qingxue heard that he had returned, she naturally agreed happily. If Xia ruofei had not said that he had something to do in the morning and would only be home in the afternoon, Ling Qingxue would probably have run back from the company in the morning.

Ling Qingxue finally managed to get off work, so she couldn’t wait to drive back to the jiangbin villa community.

As soon as she entered the kitchen, she could smell the alluring fragrance coming from the kitchen.

Xia ruofei poked his head out of the kitchen and laughed. “We’ll have braised lamb and steamed kun fish for lunch. Isn’t that a good standard?”

Ling Qingxue was bending down to change her shoes. She straightened up and gave Xia ruofei a thumbs up.”I must give it a like!”

Ling Qingxue wanted to help out in the kitchen, but Xia ruofei realized that she was getting more and more busy. She was clearly here to cause trouble! Hence, he chased her to the living room to watch TV without giving her a chance to explain.

Without Ling Qingxue by his side, Xia ruofei’s cooking efficiency had indeed improved.

Very quickly, he had prepared three dishes and a soup. Other than the two “hard dishes”, there was also a stir – fried vegetable. The ingredients were naturally the vegetables grown in the spirit map space. He also made a scallop and pork rib soup.
