Chapter 192: A magical deal (1)

Not long after manager Zhong left, he came in with his phone. “Mr. Xia, Chairman MA of our group would like to speak to you.” Manager Zhong said respectfully. “Oh, okay ...” Xia ruofei took the phone in confusion.”Mr. MA, Hello!” “Xia Sheng, you’re a little unkind!” MA Xiong said as soon as he arrived. Xia ruofei was even more confused. He asked,””What’s wrong? Mr. MA, could it be that there’s a problem with this batch of truffles?” “There is a problem, a big problem!” MA Xiong said,”xiasheng, every piece of truffle in your batch is bigger than the average truffle on the market. Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he laughed.”Old Mr. MA, you’re here for this? Hey! So what if it’s a little bigger! Weren’t they all truffles? Besides, it’s not that much bigger ...” “How can that be the same?” MA Xiong pretended to be angry.”Xiasheng, I quoted the normal market price the day before yesterday. If I had known that this batch of truffles was so big, would I have quoted such a low price? I, MA Xiong, have always been honest when I do business. You’re making me look like an unjust person!” “It can’t be that serious ...” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”Mr. MA, I didn’t see the goods the day before yesterday. I only estimated it ... Besides, the price you offered is already very high. I don’t think there’s any problem at all!” “No, no, no! Little Zhong just reported to me about the situation, and I think it’s necessary to change the price. ” MA Xiong said,”xiasheng, I think we’ll trade for the White truffle at 7000 dollars and the black truffle at 1200 dollars per unit!” Xia ruofei was shocked by MA Xiong’s bid. This year was a year of high yield for truffles. The market price of truffles was lower than previous years, but MA Xiong’s new bid was almost twice the market price. “No, no!” He quickly said. Mr. MA, your offer is too high. I’m taking advantage of your company. No, no, no, absolutely not ...” “Xia Sheng, this is definitely a real price. Your truffles are not only of first – Class quality, but their weight and size are also far above average.” MA Xiong said,”let’s trade at this price!” The voice on the phone wasn’t soft, so manager Zhong, ye Lingyun, and Lin Qiao could hear it clearly. They had long been stunned. The buyer kept asking for a higher price, but the seller firmly disagreed. What were these two people doing? Seeing Xia ruofei and MA Xiong arguing over the phone, everyone did not know whether to laugh or cry. This was truly a magical deal ... In the end, the two of them both took a step back and agreed on a price of 6500 dollars per kilogram of white truffle and 1100 dollars per kilogram of black truffle. Xia ruofei hung up the phone and passed it to manager Zhong. He complained,””Manager Zhong, why do you have to report everything? You’re a big manager, you should have some opinions! As long as there’s no problem with the quality of the truffle, you can just trade directly according to old Mr. Ma’s instructions!” Manager Zhong smiled bitterly.”Mr. Xia, you’re very understanding. The truffle I saw was different from Chairman Ma’s description. Of course, I have to report it. Otherwise, if the old man blames me, I can’t bear the responsibility as a small Regional Manager ...” “Forget it, forget it ...” Xia ruofei said helplessly.”Let’s just trade according to the new price!” “Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Xia!” Manager Zhong said quickly. Then, he gestured to the staff who came with him to bring over a very accurate electronic scale and began to weigh the truffles. There was also a staff member on the side who was responsible for recording the weight. Soon, all the truffles in the three large boxes were weighed. “Mr. Xia, there’s a total of 18.3 kilograms of white truffle and 11.9 kilograms of black truffle here. This is the detailed data we recorded. Please take a look.” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”no need to look!” I can trust you ...” “Alright,” he said. Manager Zhong quickly calculated and said,”Mr. Xia, the total is 132040 US dollars. Would you like us dollars or Chinese dollars?” “Just pay me in Chinese dollars at today’s exchange rate!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Alright!” Manager Zhong said. He took out his mobile phone and checked the exchange rate between Chinese yuan and US dollars today. Then, he quickly converted it with the calculator on his mobile phone and said,””Mr. Xia, that’s 880574.76 Chinese dollars in total,” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”round it down. Give me 880000!” “This ...” “Those peddlers even cut off the odd numbers when doing business! Besides, old Mr MA raised the price by so much in one go. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it’s decided then! Your Chairman MA will not blame you. ” “Then ... Alright! Thank you, Mr. Xia. ” Manager Zhong said. Manager Zhong was well prepared. He had brought a wireless point – of – Sale machine with him, so he immediately transferred 880000 Huaxia dollars from the company account to Xia ruofei’s bank card. The staff carefully moved the sorting boxes to the small refrigerator car’s container outside. Manager Zhong took out a list of goods with detailed information about truffles and asked Xia ruofei to sign it. After Xia ruofei signed the document for manager han, manager han expressed his gratitude and left politely. Xia ruofei watched the refrigerator car leave. Lin Qiao and ye Lingyun also followed them out. Lin Qiao, who witnessed the transaction, was speechless.”Brother ruofei, you sold that little thing for 880000? Is that truffle worth that much?” “To be more precise, high – Quality truffles are very valuable.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”truffles are very rare and almost impossible to cultivate. It’s normal for them to be more expensive.” “Mm! Brother ruofei is a big tycoon now!” Lin Qiao smiled and said,”it’s a business worth millions!” “I’m not a nouveau riche! The truffles were also bought by my friend, so I’m just making a profit from the price difference. ” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Xia ruofei could only say that. Otherwise, he would not be able to explain the origin of the truffles. “He’s richer than me, anyway!” Lin Qiao said with a smile. “Of course!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”now you know your brother ruofei’s financial strength, right? In the future, if you’re short of money, just tell me. You must spend the money you need to spend. Don’t let yourself suffer, understand?” “Mm! Thank you, brother ruofei!” Lin Qiao replied sweetly. Just then, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. “Hello,” he said. “Hello, are you Mr. Xia ruofei?” “I am, Who are you?” Xia ruofei asked. “Hello, Mr. Xia. We’re from the wild fun fishing equipment store. Your custom – made fish tank has been completed. Is it convenient for us to deliver it to you today?” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”yo! It was a day earlier! That would be great! Send it over immediately, I’ll be home the whole day!” [PS] announcing the VIP Reader group number: 295848872, genuine readers are welcome to join the group (after joining the group, you need to verify the screenshot of the full subscription).Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
