“Understood!” Lui hai answered seriously,”don’t worry, Mr. Xia. We will keep our mouth shut about the jade pendant!” If anyone dares to leak it, I’ll be the first to clean up the house!”

Xia ruofei dispersed his aura and smiled,””Of course I believe in everyone. I’m just giving you a reminder.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Not until then did lui hai and the others feel relaxed. They found that their backs were wet with cold sweat unconsciously. They were also shocked,”how could a person’s pressure be so strong?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”okay, I’m done!” This is my first time in Turin! Who’s going to accompany me for a walk?”

“Mr. Xia, I have nothing to do in Turin. Let me go with you!” Lui hai said hurriedly.

“Alright! Then I’ll follow your arrangements. ” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll be going back to the Grao family’s place tonight. If there’s nothing, you don’t have to look for me. If there’s anything urgent, you can ask Ah Hua to pass the message.”

“Understood!” Lui hai said and then turned around,”zhengfeng, arrange the car!”

“Alright!”

In the afternoon, lui hai took Xia ruofei to tour around Turin. It was not a long tour, so they could only take a quick look.

Lyu zhengfeng wanted to arrange some people to protect Lyu hai, but Lyu hai refused. He felt that it was very safe to stay with Xia ruofei. Even if the glory society wanted to assassinate him, they would not succeed.

In fact, Xia ruofei had been using his spiritual power to be on alert. Not only did he have to pay attention to his safety, but he also had to be careful not to be spied on. After all, he had come out with his original identity. If he was targeted by the glory society, there might be some trouble.

However, Xia ruofei did not find anything unusual in the afternoon. He did not know if the glory society was really willing to suffer in silence or if they had other plans.

Xia ruofei thought about it and realized that there was another possibility. With the destruction of the Gelman family, the glory Association’s power in Duning city had been reduced by half. It would not be easy to harm the Hong sect here.

Therefore, it might be more dangerous for lui hai to go back to Milan than in Turin.

Xia ruofei also told lui hai his guess and reminded him to be careful.

After getting the jade pendant, lui hai became more confident, but he said he would pay more attention to it.

Lui hai treated Xia ruofei to a good Western restaurant in Turin and then sent a car to send Xia ruofei back to the manor of the Grasso family.

Xia ruofei didn’t want Monica to know his relationship with the Hong sect, so lui hai didn’t send him back.

After returning to the Grao family’s small Manor, Xia ruofei went straight to Luo SI’s room.

Monica was talking to Rousey in the room. When they saw Xia ruofei, they both greeted him happily.

Monica said,”Xia!” Rousey feels much better today. The effect of your treatment plan is very obvious!”

Xia ruofei laughed and sat down on the stool beside Rousey’s bed. “That’s good, Rousey. The ointment’s medicinal properties have been mostly absorbed. You just have to wash it off before you go to bed.”

“Yes, Mr. Xia!” Rousey said excitedly, and then he asked,”Mr. Xia, when can I get off the bed and walk?”

Xia ruofei said gently,”Rossi, in China, there’s a saying that goes,’when you’re old, you have to take things one step at a time.’ Your leg has been injured for so many years. We can’t rush in the treatment. We need to take it step by step.”

“I understand, I’m not rushing you!” Rousey quickly said,”it’s just that it’s been too long since I’ve gotten off the ground and walked. I’m looking forward to it. Can you give me an approximate time?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Rousey, the first stage of the treatment will take about three to four days. Of course, this is only the first step. After this stage of treatment, it is expected that your leg deformity will be corrected and the nerves in your leg will recover. After that, you will need to go through long – term rehabilitation training to gradually recover your atrophied muscles. At the same time, you will also need some time to overcome your psychological barrier before you can really walk.”

“I see ...” Rousey said.

Xia ruofei could tell that Rossi was a little disappointed, so he smiled and said,””Rousey, I can tell you clearly that the real key is these three or four days. If the treatment can achieve the expected effect, it means that all the difficulties have been overcome. Then, you will be fully recovered, and the rest is only a matter of time. I’m very confident that in the future, not only will you be able to walk, but you’ll also be able to run as if you’re flying. You’ll be a completely healthy person!”

When Rousey heard this, his heart was filled with burning faith again. In fact, he had complete faith in Xia ruofei’s medical skills, but his leg injury was too serious. He was not confident to what extent he could recover. Now that he heard Xia ruofei personally tell him that one day, he would be able to fully recover and become a normal person, he could not suppress the joy in his heart.

Xia ruofei smiled and stood up.””Alright, all you have to do is to fully cooperate with my treatment. You don’t have to think about anything else. If there’s nothing else, you should rest early! I should go back to my room and sleep. “
