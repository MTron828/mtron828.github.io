Chapter 112: The head of security is in place (1)

“Instructor Xia, I’m sorry to have disappointed you ...” Ye Lingyun said in a low voice. “That’s nothing. Didn’t I leave the Army myself? What right do I have to criticize you?” Xia ruofei laughed at himself and said,”and I believe you must have your own difficulties.” Xia ruofei knew very well that ye Lingyun was born to be a Special Forces soldier. From a local youth to a qualified Special Forces soldier, it only took him six months. In less than two years, he had grown into the backbone of the Special Forces. His natural sensitivity to the Special Forces and his love for the Army were unquestionable. As ye Lingyun drove, he revealed a reminiscing expression and told Xia ruofei about his retirement. It turned out that ye Lingyun was planning to stay in the team this year. The Special Forces needed a backbone like him. Even if there was only one sergeant transfer quota this year, they would definitely give him one. However, just as ye Lingyun was training hard for the officer promotion examination, his father was found to have late – Stage dystocia. Ye Lingyun was the only son in the family, and his mother passed away from lung cancer when he was born. For many years, his father did not remarry and raised him alone. Since ancient times, loyalty and filial piety could not be both at once. Ye Lingyun’s family savings were quickly used up. Although his comrades from the Special Forces also organized donations and even the leaders of the Army Group personally sent him some money, cancer treatment was like a bottomless pit. The money was not enough at all. The most important thing was that there was no one to take care of his seriously ill father. After an intense mental struggle, ye Lingyun, as the only son in his family, finally decided to apply for retirement. He wanted to bid farewell to his beloved Green Army uniform and the Green Army camp that was a straight line plus a square. He knew about his family’s special circumstances and the Army’s Special Affairs. It was not time for him to leave the Army yet, but he was allowed to leave in advance. Ye Lingyun did his best to take care of his seriously ill father when he got home. Even if his father wanted to give up on treatment after knowing his condition, ye Lingyun would not allow it. He had spent all his retirement allowance and sold everything in his family. He also had a huge debt. In the end, ye Lingyun couldn’t save his father. Not long ago, his father had left. After burying his father, ye Lingyun took a train to the South and arrived at Sanshan city. He hoped to earn money as soon as possible to pay off the hundred thousand Yuan He borrowed from his relatives and friends. However, he had been in the Army for more than four years, and all he had learned was killing. He didn’t have a college degree, so he was rejected time and time again. Fortunately, he was quite lucky. When he went to Deng Ming’s company to apply for a security guard job, he was recruited as a private bodyguard by Deng Ming due to his good skills. His monthly salary was 20000 Yuan. He had only worked for a week, but because of today’s incident, he was directly kicked out of the house by Deng Ming. After ye linyun finished, he continued,””Instructor Xia, your comrades already know that you’re sick. At that time, everyone was discussing how to find time to visit you at the military general Hospital! I didn’t expect you to leave the Army so soon ... Oh right, your illness ... How’s the situation?” Xia ruofei smiled.”I’ve tried Chinese medicine after I came back. It’s quite effective. There shouldn’t be any major problems.” “Oh, really? That’s great!” Ye Lingyun, who always had a cold face, couldn’t help but show a happy expression. “Ling Yun, what are your plans for the future?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “I haven’t thought about it yet, I’ll just take it one step at a time!” Ye Lingyun said,”I owe 140 to 150 thousand Yuan for my father’s treatment. I’ll definitely find a job and work hard to earn money first. I’ll think about other things after I pay off the money.” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”hmm...Work for me!” We brothers – in – arms know each other very well, it’s better than being bodyguards for a private boss!” “Instructor Xia, you ...” Ye Lingyun was a little surprised. After all, Xia ruofei had just retired from the military for a few months and was so seriously ill. It was probably a problem for him to support himself! Xia ruofei smiled.”I started my own business after I retired from the military. I have my own farm now. If you don’t mind, you can come and work with me.” “Of course I’m willing to!” Ye Lingyun said, then hesitated before continuing,”but instructor Xia, I don’t know anything other than what I learned in the Army! With your skills, you don’t need me to be your bodyguard ...” “I don’t need it, but the company does!” Xia ruofei laughed. You’ll be fully responsible for the company’s security in the future! I’ll give you a monthly salary of 20000 Yuan! Is there a problem?” Ye Lingyun subconsciously puffed out his chest and said,””No problem, instructor!” “But ... 20000 a month is too high ...” He hesitated. “What’s so high about 20000 Yuan a month for our Special Forces elites?” Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”the company is still in its infancy. I’ll give you a raise when it’s developed well. The head of security at paradise Corporation should at least have an annual salary of a million!” “No need, instructor Xia. Twenty thousand a month is already a lot ...” Ye Lingyun chuckled. As the two of them spoke, ye Lingyun had already driven to the holiday villa in Changping County according to the navigation. Looking at the construction site that was in full swing, ye Lingyun asked,””Instructor, is this your farm?” “En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it should be finished before the Spring Festival. You can work for me in peace from now on! We brothers will conquer the world together!” “Yes! Instructor!” Ye Lingyun’s tone was also a little excited. Xia ruofei smiled.”Ling Yun, we’ve already left the Army. We’re no longer soldiers. You don’t have to call me instructor Xia anymore. Just ... Call me brother Xia!” “Oh ... Okay.” “Brother ... Brother Xia!” Ye linyun said. He was clearly not used to this new form of address. Xia ruofei used the remote control to open the villa’s courtyard gate. Ye Lingyun drove the car into the villa’s courtyard and parked it. The two of them got out of the car. In the corner of the yard, lightning heard the sound and immediately came out of its kennel. It threw itself in front of Xia ruofei affectionately and looked at ye Lingyun with vigilance. Xia ruofei pointed at ye Lingyun.”Lightning, he’s my brother. We’re on the same side. You’re not allowed to be so fierce, you know?” Lightning was already very understanding. It immediately wagged its tail at ye Lingyun, obviously trying to please him. Xia ruofei smiled and patted Lightning’s head, telling it to go back to its nest. Then, he brought ye Lingyun to a guest room on the first floor. He opened the cabinet and took out a brand new quilt and mattress.”Ling Yun, you can stay at my house for the time being!” “Sure, brother Xia.” Ye Lingyun scratched his head and said with a smile,”this is my first time living in a big villa ...” “Work hard, and you’ll be able to buy your own big villa soon!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”alright, you can go and wash up first!” “Thank you, brother Xia!” Xia ruofei went upstairs to his bedroom. After carefully locking the door, he summoned the spirit painting scroll from his palm and took out a small travel bag. The bag was filled with stacks of cash from the vegetable transactions with Xi Jiang Yue and Ling Ji restaurant. Xia ruofei, who had the spirit map space, did not deposit the money in the bank but kept it in the spirit map space. It was much safer than a bank. Xia ruofei counted 150000 and put it in a big plastic bag. Then, he went to the bathroom to take a shower before he took the money and went downstairs.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
