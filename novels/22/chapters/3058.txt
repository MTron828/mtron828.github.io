“Put ... Put the flying sword into your body?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but take a deep breath.”It ... It won’t cut us?”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”After you’ve branded it with your spiritual imprint, you’ll be the master of the flying sword. The flying sword can’t hurt its master. Don’t worry!”

Even so, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were still a little afraid. Xia ruofei decided to teach them how to brand their spiritual power on the flying sword first.

When the spiritual mark successfully hit the flying sword, the two of them immediately felt a sense of connection with their respective flying swords.

At this moment, Xia ruofei taught them how to keep the flying swords in their bodies.

Although they were a little scared, they still followed Xia ruofei’s instructions carefully out of absolute trust. As expected, the flying sword was taken in. At the same time, the two of them immediately felt that the flying sword was already nourishing their dantian.

Both Song Wei and Ling Qingxue felt that this was a fresh experience and tried to summon their flying swords.

After trying a few times, the two of them no longer felt that kind of fear.

Next, Xia ruofei taught them how to use their spiritual energy to control the flying sword.

He didn’t teach them any profound sword techniques. After all, learning sword techniques wasn’t something that could be done in a day. Learning how to use spiritual power to control flying swords first would at least give them a certain level of self – Protection.

In reality, this was more than enough. The chances of Song Wei and Ling Qingxue fighting against cultivators were very low.

Very quickly, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had grasped the basics of controlling the flying sword. They began to carefully test it out.

The space in the cabin was relatively small, and the flying boat was so precious. If it was damaged by the flying sword that could cut through iron like mud, it would be enough to make Xia ruofei’s heart ache. So, he simply brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to the deck and let them practice.

In the beginning, the two of them were not used to the feeling of using their spiritual power to control the flying sword, so they seemed a little clumsy when controlling it.

However, after practicing for a while, they gradually became familiar with it.

The trajectory of the flying sword also became more natural.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I think it’s fine!” With these skills, you will definitely have no problem protecting yourself!”

In fact, in the modern cultivation world, there were probably only a few Qi refining cultivators who could own a flying sword.

Even Qi condensation cultivators who were slightly stronger than Song Wei and Ling Qingxue wouldn’t be able to do much against the two of them.

If they were to encounter an Aurous core stage cultivator, it would not matter whether the other party had a flying sword or not. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue would definitely not be able to defeat them.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not let that happen.

“So this is what it feels like to control a flying sword!” Ling Qingxue put away the flying sword reluctantly and said with a smile,”I suddenly thought of the plot in the Shu mountain swordsman! Wei Wei, don’t you think we look like swordswomen?”

Song Wei also kept her flying sword into her dantian. Then, she pursed her lips and smiled, “You’re more like it ...”

Ling Qingxue felt a little embarrassed. She held Song Wei’s hand and said,””Weiwei, you also felt very cool when you were riding the flying sword! If she were to change into an ancient costume, she would look like a female swordsman!”

“That’s the end of the commercial toasting!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”regarding the flying sword, I still have to give you a few words of advice.”

“Speak! This little girl is all ears!” Ling Qingxue said playfully.

Xia ruofei said,”first of all, only cultivators can see this flying sword. Ordinary people can’t see it. So, when you use it in the secular world, you need to be careful. However, you don’t have to avoid ordinary people.”

“I understand, I understand. What else?” Ling Qingxue asked.

“Also, don’t kill innocent people. Try to avoid using flying swords against ordinary people unless the other party is really guilty of terrible crimes and deserves to die.” Xia ruofei said,”it’s a taboo in the world of cultivation to use the methods of cultivators against ordinary people.”

Xia ruofei quickly added,”of course, I believe that you won’t do it either. I’m just giving you a reminder. After all, flying swords are also weapons. They’re really sharp too. You must be careful when you use them!”

“En!” Ling Qingxue nodded her head seriously and said,”don’t worry! We mainly use flying swords for self – defense!”

“It can be used when needed, even if it’s just to cut melons or vegetables. However, you must be careful when using it.” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue laughed so hard that they were trembling. Ling Qingxue said,”Who would use such a precious flying sword to cut vegetables? Aren’t you being too funny?”

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”maybe master Yuntai has done this before. After all, this flying sword is not very precious to master Yuntai. He can make it himself!”

Ling Qingxue continued to ask,”we’ve also accepted the flying sword. RUO Fei, do you have any other gifts?” It’s better to take it out in one go!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,”isn’t one flying sword and one storage ring enough for each of us?” I’m almost empty of money! Where would you find any present?”

“That might not be the case.” Ling Qingxue giggled and said,”usually, people who cry about being poor might not be really poor! You must have gained a lot from the auction this time!”

On the other hand, Song Wei was watching the show with a smile. Ling Qingxue had a more lively personality. Sometimes, she would bicker with Xia ruofei, and Song Wei found it interesting to watch.

Xia ruofei thought about it seriously and said,””Now that you mention it, I do remember ... I still have something to give you!”

“Ah? There’s really a gift?” Ling Qingxue couldn’t help but be stunned.

“Ruofei, Qingxue was just joking with you!” Song Wei said. You’ve already given us a huge surprise, so you should keep more of these cultivation resources for yourself. After all, your cultivation level is much higher than ours, so you’ll definitely consume more. ”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”It’s really not a gift this time. It’s just a consumable item for your cultivation!”

With that, Xia ruofei flipped his hand and took out two crystals from the spirit map space. He handed them to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue.

He smiled and said,”here!” One for each person. This was an origin crystal. It contained much more spiritual energy than spirit crystals. Ordinary golden core cultivators would not be willing to use it! In the future, you will use origin crystals for cultivation. This way, the efficiency will be higher!”

Song Wei was shocked and said,”since this is for golden core cultivators, you should keep it for yourself!” The spirit crystals you gave us were already quite useful, but this ... Is origin crystal? It would be a waste to give it to us!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand.”If it was in the past, I might have felt that it was a waste. After all, we were poor at that time.” This time, he had indeed made a fortune! I have quite a few origin crystals in my hands now! Such a good thing, of course, I have to give it to you first! Take them all! I’m already not lacking origin crystals!”

“This ...” Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other, then said,”then we’ll help ourselves!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what’s there to be polite about?” What’s mine is yours!”

“You’re the one who said that!” Ling Qingxue said.

“I did!”

“If so, you have to send me wherever I want to go by airboat!” Ling Qingxue said,”after you take the airboat, you don’t even look at the plane anymore, okay? It’s slow, and sometimes it’s very bumpy. There’s also a safety issue ... I hate it!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”no problem!” Even if I’m thousands of miles away, as long as you call me, I’ll immediately fly over to pick you up!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“This performance is not bad!” Ling Qingxue said, satisfied.

Xia ruofei laughed and spread his hands.”I really don’t have any gifts this time. I’ve already brought out everything that should be brought out.”

...

Ling Qingxue and Song Wei were laughing at the side. At the same time, they felt a little embarrassed. It seemed like they had come out to loot Xia ruofei and then returned home.

On the return journey, Xia ruofei flew to the three mountains first according to the distance.

They had spent a lot of time studying the flying sword and the storage ring. Therefore, after the three of them chatted for a while in the cabin, the swift Boat had already crossed the Strait and was approaching the city of San Shan.
