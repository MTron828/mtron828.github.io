Chapter 1227: Harvesting aweto (2)

Translator: 549690339

Under Xia ruofei’s precise control, the buckles were fastened one after another. This piece of mesh was tightly connected to the original mesh, forming a small isolation area, isolating the bats and moths inside.

“Let’s go!” Xia ruofei said to Xia Qing,”go in and take a look!”

One of the Nets was fixed with Magic Tape. Xia ruofei lifted the net and carefully stepped into the Cordyceps sinensis cultivation nursery with Xia Qing. There were too many mature grass here, and they could easily step on them if they were not careful.

Xia ruofei squatted down, and Xia Qing immediately handed him a small wooden shovel.

Xia ruofei carefully dug into the soft soil with the shovel.

Wormgrass was not like truffles. They basically grew underground, so Xia ruofei quickly dug one out.

Xia Qing immediately handed over a very soft brush. Xia ruofei used the brush to carefully clean the soil on the surface of the Cordyceps. Then, a fat Cordyceps with a head of grass appeared in front of the two.

This was not Xia ruofei’s first time harvesting wormgrass. When Yingying had just collected the mycelium, soil, and vegetation, he had asked Xia Qing to experiment with planting them at the Archean realm. Hence, he had a rough idea of what they were.

Comparing the two, Xia ruofei was very satisfied with this wormgrass that he had randomly picked. It seemed to be thicker than the wormgrass he had picked at the Archean realm.

“You’re an expert, take a look!” Xia ruofei smiled as he handed the heavy winter caterpillar fungus to Xia Qing.

Xia Qing took it and looked at it briefly, then said,””Master, judging from its weight, color, and some distinctive features, as well as the unique thick butter fragrance, this wormgrass is of extremely high quality! It’s not inferior to the worm grass we planted at the Archean realm. In fact, it might even be better! If all the wormgrass in this garden could reach such a high quality, we would have a big harvest this time!”

Xia ruofei revealed a satisfied smile and dusted off the dirt on his hands.””Then what are we waiting for? Let’s start work! Xia Qing, make a trip to the Archean realm and find a set of tools for digging the wormgrass. Also, find a few plastic boxes and bring them over. We’ll dig together!”

“Yes, master!”

After Xia Qing left, Xia ruofei started to focus on digging the wormgrass.

Very soon, Xia Qing returned to the wormgrass cultivation nursery from the Archean realm. The master and servant split up and began to get busy in the garden.

This was perhaps the simplest grass digging job in the world.

There was no oxygen – deficient environment like the snow region plateau, no plateau snow wolves that could appear at any time, no dangerous steep slopes, and no need to search inch by inch with wide eyes. All they had to do was to keep digging.

Of course, they still had to be careful not to damage the skin of the aweto, but for Xia ruofei and Xia Qing, this was a simple thing. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

For a whole eight to nine hours, this master and servant pair did not stop at all, bending over to work.

Fortunately, Xia Qing was only a spiritual puppet, and Xia ruofei’s physique was stronger than a bull. If it were an ordinary person, his waist would have been broken.

Xia ruofei looked up. The two of them had only completed a very small area. As far as the eye could see, it was still a large area of purple – Red.

Although two mu of land wasn’t big, and the two of them were very skilled in digging the wormgrass, they couldn’t stand the high density of the wormgrass! There were probably hundreds of wormgrass in every square meter, so it was normal for the two to progress slowly.

He stood up gloomily, stretched his sore waist, and said to Xia Qing,””It seems like I won’t be able to finish it today. I still have things to do outside, so I can’t stay in the origin space all the time.”

He pondered for a moment and continued,””How about this! Xia Qing, let’s stop here for today. Let’s go to the Archean realm and clean up the wormgrass. We’ll also take stock of today’s harvest! You can slowly dig out the rest of the wormgrass!”

“Yes, master!”

Xia ruofei and Xia Qing left the aweto cultivation nursery. He carefully stuck the magic Tape on the mesh and then used the invisible force of space to unbuckle the ‘quarantine area’ mesh, hanging it on one side.

The bats and moths regained their freedom and immediately flew away. Bats and moths could be seen flying everywhere in the area of two mu. After a while, some of the bats and moths slowly fell down, stopping on the gauze or on the purple – Red grass.

Although he had not harvested all the Cordyceps yet, it was not good to keep the bats and moths in such a small space, so Xia ruofei decided to let them out first.

When Xia Qing went to dig wormgrass again, he would come in and isolate them again.

Xia ruofei brought Xia Qing and the Cordyceps he obtained this time back to the Archean realm.

Working in the Archean realm could save him some time. Also, he wouldn’t disturb these bats and moths if he stayed further away.

These bats and moths were now Xia ruofei’s precious treasure! The next step was to continue to expand the area of the worm garden!

The master and servant arrived at the spatial spirit pond.

Xia ruofei first picked up the ladle beside the pond and scooped up some clear spatial spirit pond water. He gulped down a few mouthfuls and instantly felt refreshed. The fatigue in his body seemed to have been removed.

“Let’s start work!” Xia ruofei said.

He and Xia Qing started to clean the wormgrass one by one with soft brushes.

There was a large amount of Cordyceps, and the work was not easy. The cleaning work had to be very meticulous and careful, so it took even longer than digging the Cordyceps.

After a full ten hours, the master and servant pair finally cleaned up all the aweto they had harvested today.

Fortunately, the flow of time at the Archean realm was 30 times faster than the outside world. Xia ruofei didn’t mind spending more time here.

After cleaning up the Cordyceps, Xia ruofei lay down on the recliner by the pond and said,””I’ll rest for a while. Xia Qing, check how much we’ve gained this time!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing was absolutely obedient to Xia ruofei’s orders. Besides, he was never tired. As long as he absorbed a small amount of spiritual Qi, he could always maintain a full health state.

Xia ruofei was resting on the deck chair with his eyes closed. In this space that was rich in spiritual Qi, there seemed to be a sweet scent in the air, which made one feel relaxed and happy. He actually fell asleep without realizing it.

Xia ruofei didn’t know how long had passed before he woke up. He saw Xia Qing standing beside him with her hands down. He rubbed his sleepy eyes and asked,””Xia Qing, you’ve already finished counting?”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing bowed slightly and said,”I’ve already finished counting. I saw that you were resting, master, so I didn’t disturb you.”

“Hey, you could have just woken me up ...” Xia ruofei said,”tell me!” How’s our harvest this time?”

“Yes!” Xia Qing said immediately,”master, we have a total of 2168 wormgrass this time!”

Xia ruofei sat up from the chair and asked with his eyes wide open,””How much?”

Xia Qing was startled. She hesitated for a moment and said,””Master, it’s 2168. I counted them one by one, so it shouldn’t be wrong ...”

Xia ruofei only knew that he had harvested very quickly today and should have gained a lot, but when he heard the exact number Xia Qing had reported, he was still shocked.

Xia ruofei’s first reaction was to return to the mountain sea realm in a flash. He stood in front of the net of the Chinese caterpillar fungus garden and gauged the area that had just been harvested.

The result made his old face blush. He and Xia Qing had been busy for so long, but they had only harvested five or six square meters. In the purple – Red color, it couldn’t be seen if one didn’t pay attention.

Xia ruofei quickly calculated in his heart. The wormgrass was distributed very evenly. If he could harvest 2160 wormgrass in such a small area, how many wormgrass could he harvest in two acres?

He wouldn’t have known if he didn’t count, but he was shocked when he did.

In this mere two mu of land, he could actually harvest about 500000 Cordyceps!
