Chapter 3827  A delightful change (1)

    Xia ruofei waited for a few more minutes before the fluctuations of the laws in the spirit map space finally stopped.

  Just as Xia ruofei was about to enter the spirit map space to take a look, he heard Bai Qingqing's voice in his mind,""Brother RUO Fei! You ... You only left me these few pieces! You're too petty ..." DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

  Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed. He transmitted his voice,""That ... I didn't expect that the upgrade of this space would require so many world stones. However, I really didn't waste a single one. When my small space started to upgrade, I immediately stopped throwing in world stones, but ... The actual situation is like this. There are still eight more, so I'll leave them all for you!"

  Even though Xia ruofei had obtained these realm stones himself, and it was reasonable for him not to give a single one to Bai Qingqing, Xia ruofei still felt a little guilty. After all, Bai Qingqing had helped him find the realm stones previously. It could be said that she had helped him before. This time, he had obtained an entire box of realm stones, so it was reasonable for him to leave some for Bai Qingqing.

  Eight was indeed a little too little.

  "Alright ..." Bai Qingqing said disappointedly,"it's better than nothing. After all, you found this world stone yourself. It's more important to upgrade your small space ..."

  Xia ruofei consoled her."Qingqing, when I'm free, let's go out again. The world is so big, right? there's bound to be a chance to find more world stones. I'll give you more then!"

  "Mm! Brother ruofei, you have to keep your word!" Bai Qingqing said,"can you quickly hand me these eight world stones? I'm about to starve to death ..."

  "No problem! No problem!" Xia ruofei quickly said.

  Then, he closed the jade box and entered the spirit map space with the jade box.

  As the realm Fox Bai Qingqing had always been in the mountain and sea realm, Xia ruofei had also teleported to the mountain and sea realm. Furthermore, he had arrived in a small space above the sea.

  The realm Fox, Bai Qingqing, had not moved for the past two years. She had been staying here to comprehend the special rules of the spirit map space.

  What was special was that this small space was created by the realm Fox, Bai Qingqing. This meant that it had a deep understanding of the spatial rules of the spirit map space. Of course, this was under the silent consent of Xia ruofei. Otherwise, Bai Qingqing would not have been able to make any changes to the space.

  Xia ruofei threw the jade box to Bai Qingqing.

  Bai Qingqing had been lying lazily on her stomach and looked weak. However, when she saw Xia ruofei throw the jade box at her, she immediately perked up. She pounced over and hugged the jade box. Then, she used her head to push open the lid of the jade box and slipped into it.

  Bai Qingqing's body was very small, about the size of a civet cat, so it didn't feel crowded at all when she got into the jade box.

  It impatiently grabbed the world stone and stuffed it into its mouth, looking extremely hungry.

  Xia ruofei waited for a few more minutes before the fluctuations of the laws in the spirit map space finally stopped.

  Just as Xia ruofei was about to enter the spirit map space to take a look, he heard Bai Qingqing's voice in his mind,""Brother RUO Fei! You ... You only left me these few pieces! You're too petty ..."

  Xia ruofei threw the jade box to Bai Qingqing.
