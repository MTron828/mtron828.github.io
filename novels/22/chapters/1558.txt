“That’s true!” Yu mingdong said,”I made a small fortune with Mr. Xia today. I’m in a good mood! I won’t look for him! Otherwise, he would have to return a portion of the money! You actually quit halfway!”

Then, Yu mingdong said,”Mr. Xia, thank you so much for today!” Let’s go have some supper later! I didn’t have time to entertain you in the afternoon, so I’ll give you a toast later!”

Xia ruofei was still worried about Song Wei. How could he be in the mood to have supper? He quickly waved his hand and said,”it’s too late. I’m so sleepy right now. I think I can fall asleep as soon as I touch the pillow. Let’s forget about having supper!” Besides, this piece of Jade is worth a lot of money! It’s impossible to just leave it in the hotel!”

Yu mingdong thought for a moment and said,”alright!” Then I’ll treat you to a meal after I’m done processing these jades tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Yu mingdong asked again,”by the way, Mr. Xia, there’s still the last batch of raw stones for this public Jade bid. The exhibition will start tomorrow, and the bidding will start the day after tomorrow. Do you want to buy a few more for fun?” I think you’re very lucky!”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”let’s see how it goes!” I can’t decide for now ...”

It would depend on Song Wei’s condition. If Song Wei could wake up, Xia ruofei might participate. Otherwise, he would not be in the mood.

“Alright, have a good rest today!” Yu mingdong said,”by the way, Mr. Xia, I’ve made an appointment with a Jade distributor I’m more familiar with tomorrow morning. I’ll accompany you to pick some Jade!”

This was Xia ruofei’s main purpose for this trip. Besides, he had used Jade as a mortgage for the violet Jade he had traded with Yu mingdong. So, even though the problem of upgrading the space had been solved, Xia ruofei still nodded in agreement. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yu mingdong smiled and said,”Mr. Xia must be someone who does great things!” If an ordinary person earned tens of millions from stone gambling, it would be a wonder if they could sleep at night!”

Xia ruofei laughed,”I’m a big – hearted person!”

The hotel was not far from jadeite Street. After chatting for a while, the escort vehicle arrived.

As usual, it was still the escort who brought the Imperial Jade upstairs.

Yu mingdong’s room was on the same floor as Xia ruofei ‘s. For safety reasons, a Big Boss like him had actually booked a standard room. He and Shi Lei were staying in the same room.

Everyone said Goodnight to each other in the corridor, and then Xia ruofei returned to his room impatiently.

As soon as he entered the room, Xia ruofei locked the door as usual and began to check the situation in the room. At the same time, he had already communicated with Xia Qing using his divine sense.

“Xia Qing, how are the preparations?”

“Everything is ready, master!” Xia Qing said calmly.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. At this moment, he could not help but worry about the gains and losses. If the heart – concentrating grass still could not wake Song Wei up, he did not dare to think further ...

Xia ruofei checked the bedroom as fast as he could. Then, he locked the doors and windows, pulled the curtains, summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm, and entered the medium.

Mountain and sea realm.

Outside the cave where the stone room was located, Xia Qing was waiting with a bowl. Xia ruofei’s figure flashed and appeared beside Xia Qing.

He took a look at the bowl of medicine in Xia Qing’s hand and saw that it was half – filled with a black medicinal soup.

“Master, I’ve already made a medicinal soup with the heart concentrating grass and a few other supplementary herbs.” Xia Qing handed the bowl to Xia ruofei.”This is an Internal Medicine. You can just feed it to miss song ...”

Only Xia ruofei could enter the stone room, so Xia Qing handed the bowl to Xia ruofei outside the cave.

“This medicine ... How confident are you in saving Song Wei?” Xia ruofei asked.

“I don’t know ...” Xia Qing said.

“You don’t know?” Xia ruofei’s eyes widened.”You spent so much effort to upgrade the space and now you have the heart – concentrating grass. You ...”

“Master, the damage to the soul is very troublesome,” Xia Qing said with a bitter smile.”I’m afraid even the previous master of the spirit map world wasn’t confident that he could save miss song. ” However ... If even a high – grade spirit herb like the heart – concentrating grass that specializes in nourishing the soul is not effective, then I’m afraid ...”

Xia ruofei felt a burst of frustration. He waved his hand to stop Xia Qing from continuing.

However, Xia Qing’s meaning was very clear. If the heart concentrating grass couldn’t wake Song Wei up, then even he couldn’t think of a better way.

Xia ruofei sighed and entered the cave with the bowl of medicine.

In the stone room, Xia ruofei stared at Song Wei, who was lying quietly on the stone bed with her head on a Jade futon. He prayed to the gods in his heart and hoped that they would bless Song Wei to wake up as soon as possible.

Xia ruofei walked over and gently helped Song Wei up. He let her lean on Him and lay down.

Then, he gently pinched Song Wei’s mouth to make her open her mouth. Then, he slowly fed her the half bowl of medicine.

Song Wei was in a deep coma and could not swallow instinctively. Hence, Xia ruofei wrapped the liquid with his essential Qi and sent it into Song Wei’s stomach.

After feeding Song Wei all the medicine, Xia ruofei laid her down slowly and looked at her nervously.

One minute, two minutes, three minutes ...

Five minutes passed, and there was still no reaction from Song Wei.

Xia ruofei’s heart started to sink.

At this moment, Xia ruofei, who had been observing Song Wei’s situation with his spiritual power, suddenly noticed that Song Wei’s eyelashes seemed to tremble slightly.

Xia ruofei was overjoyed, but he managed to remain calm. His first reaction was to use his mind and an invisible spatial force wrapped around him and Song Wei. They disappeared from the stone room at the same time and came to the outside world. If Song Wei woke up and found herself in a cave, Xia ruofei would not be able to explain.

He placed Song Wei flat on the bed in the bedroom and at the same time, he waved his hand to retrieve the painting.

Then, Xia ruofei went over to draw the curtains and opened the door and windows to let in some fresh air.

After that, Xia ruofei turned around and saw Song Wei’s fingers trembling slightly. Then, she slowly opened her eyes ...

Xia ruofei almost burst into tears.

He rushed to the bed and looked at Song Wei. He said excitedly,””Song Wei, you ... You’re finally awake ...”

Song Wei’s eyes were filled with confusion as she asked weakly,””Ruofe...I...Where am I?”

“We’ve already left the underground palace!” Xia ruofei said excitedly,”you’re very safe now! It’s alright ... It’s alright ...”

Song Wei nodded her head slowly. Xia ruofei stared into her eyes. He was excited but also a little complicated. This was because he had accidentally read the contents of Song Wei’s diary at the airport.

Initially, he was very calm in front of Song Wei. However, ever since he found out about Song Wei’s Secret, he could not help but feel uncomfortable.

When Song Wei was unconscious, Xia ruofei was not in the mood to think about this. Now that Song Wei was awake, Xia ruofei suddenly felt troubled.

However, when Xia ruofei looked into Song Wei’s eyes, he suddenly felt that something was wrong. He was very familiar with Song Wei but at this moment, he suddenly felt that her gaze was strange.

This was not Song Wei!

Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. Without hesitation, he released a powerful divine thought and charged towards Song Wei.

As expected, the spirit body’s unbridled laughter rang out in his mind.

Xia ruofei’s heart trembled. He didn’t expect this spirit to be so persistent. Wasn’t she clearly expelled by the senior in the coffin? How could it still be in Song Wei’s body? could it be that she was able to separate her soul?

Xia ruofei had no time to think. His spiritual will had already entered Song Wei’s mind.

To Xia ruofei’s surprise, the spirit body seemed to be much weaker than the one in the underground palace. Under the impact of Xia ruofei’s spiritual will, it almost collapsed in one blow and dissipated into pieces ...
