2470 The olive branch (1)

The gentle and refined MA huasu also smiled and asked,””President Xia, you won’t blame us for being uninvited guests, right?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what are you saying, brother MA?” I can’t wait to welcome you all! How could he blame her? What did it mean to bring light to his humble dwelling? This was exactly what they were talking about! I feel that the banquet hall has become much brighter after everyone arrived!”

“President Xia, you’re too good with your words!” Ma Hua said with a smile.

Ma Yun said,”President Xia, don’t just talk and not practice!” Hurry up and give us a dozen of your paradise Association’s membership cards!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. Ma Yun had taken the initiative to ask for a membership card, so Xia ruofei naturally wouldn’t reject these internet bosses of Yingluo to become members of the Paradise Club. This in itself was the best advertisement.

“Of course, no problem! I can’t ask for more!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He beckoned the restaurant manager, who was shuttling through the banquet hall, over and whispered a few words into his ear.

The restaurant manager quickly nodded and quickly walked towards Zhao Yongjun.

After Zhao Yongjun heard the news, he looked over at Xia ruofei in surprise. When he saw that Ma Yun, MA Huayi, Liu Dong and the rest were indeed chatting happily with Xia ruofei, he couldn’t help but be overjoyed. However, he didn’t go over directly. Instead, he excused himself from his friends and brought the restaurant manager to the side.

Zhao Yongjun took out a stack of membership cards from his bag, counted them, and handed them to the restaurant manager. He gave a few more instructions, then walked to another friend with a glass of wine.

The restaurant manager returned to Xia ruofei’s side.

Xia ruofei took the stack of membership cards. Without looking at the number on it, he directly sent one to Liu Dong, who was the closest to him, and gave one to each person.

Although there were only 30 diamond cards, Zhao Yongjun had a backup. The stack of cards he gave Xia ruofei were all diamond cards.

“Bosses, please come to our club more often in the future!” Xia ruofei said as he sent the message.

These diamond cards were numbered. Xia ruofei did not distribute them in order but in a complete mess. This was to prevent the business leaders from comparing with each other and turning good things into bad things.

One had to know that people like Ma Yun, Liu Dong, and MA Huatai, even if they appeared to be harmonious on the surface, they were definitely competing with each other in the dark. If they didn’t even have the heart to compete, they wouldn’t have been able to make their companies so big. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ma Yun took the card and smiled,””Are you still counting on this little bit of profit?”

Xia ruofei said,”I’m not like you big bosses. Other than a small company, I only have this club!” How can I not be?”

Ma Yun pointed at Xia ruofei and smiled,””President Xia, let’s not beat around the bush. Your company is not a small one! You can lie to others, but don’t you think we know that?”

Liu Dong, Cheng Yu, and the others all agreed.

The sales of peach blossom company’s jaded skin cream were very popular on the top few e – commerce platforms. For these CEOs, the sales data was no secret at all. The profit margin of the cosmetics industry had always been very large, and the jaded skin cream was almost always in a state of supply falling short of demand. Just this alone, the speed of making money could be imagined.

Not to mention, although the other products of paradise Corporation were less money – making than jaded skin cream, all of them were the best in their field. It could be said that the image of paradise corporation’s quality products had been deeply rooted in people’s hearts.

The potential of such a company could be said to be infinite.

In the business world, strength had always been the deciding factor. Although the internet bigwigs could join the Paradise corporation’s opening ceremony due to the fact that everyone was participating in the internet Summit in Beijing, it was more because almost everyone was quite optimistic about the development prospects of paradise Corporation.

Xia ruofei begged for mercy and said,”Boss Ma, don’t flatter me too much. Your gold – panning group is still bigger than my paradise company. Even if I pull out a hair from your leg.” My company’s current market value is at most one or two billion. ”

The market value of the gold – panning group had already exceeded 100 billion. In terms of size, paradise company was really small in front of the gold – panning group.

“Market value doesn’t mean anything, your company isn’t even listed ...” Ma Yun said in all seriousness.

Xia ruofei acknowledged this point. The value of paradise Corporation was definitely not what it seemed on the surface. The invisible brand value and the value of Xia ruofei’s exclusive intellectual property were difficult to measure.

Besides, Xia ruofei’s actual wealth was far more than that of paradise Corporation. The funds in his overseas account alone were equivalent to several paradise Corporation ‘s.

And this was pure cash flow.

Even if Ma Yun was extremely rich, it would still be difficult to get him to take out one or two billion dollars immediately.

At this time, MA Huatang, who hadn’t said anything, suddenly said,””President Xia, you’ve worked with all of us here, you can’t favor one over the other! Our Penguin Group is also very interested in working with your company!”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then he smiled and asked,””Brother MA, is there any room for us to cooperate? I don’t think they’re in the same industry?”

Strictly speaking, peach blossom company was considered a real economy company and didn’t have much interaction with internet companies. Their cooperation with e – commerce platforms was also because the other party controlled the channels. Strictly speaking, this wasn’t considered a close cooperation. In essence, it was no different from a small shop owner opening a shop on the platform of the gold mining Group or kyokuboku shopping mall.

On the other hand, Penguin Group had tried to get involved in the e – commerce field and compete with Gold Rush Group. As for jingbei mall, when Penguin Group was playing e – commerce, jingbei mall didn’t have much to do with this industry.

However, the Penguin Group’s attempts in the e – commerce field had basically failed. Although Penguin Group invested in the e – commerce platform, it was only an investment.

“How can there be no room for cooperation?” MA huasu smiled faintly. Now that we’ve entered the era of the Internet of Things, the internet connects everything, and the Internet industry can cooperate with any industry. ”

There was nothing wrong with that. The Internet of Things had been around for years, and it had developed very quickly in the past two years. The most typical examples were smart homes and self – driving cars. Even so, Xia ruofei still couldn’t think of any possible cooperation between paradise Corporation and Penguin Group.

“President Xia,” MA Huachen said with a smile,”our group has too much cash flow recently. We have no place to spend it. Are you interested in financing?”

When Ma Yun heard this, he pouted and said,””After all this, he still wants to raise funds!”

MA Huayi acted as if he didn’t hear her. He looked at Xia ruofei and said,”” 500 million Chinese dollars. I only want 10% of the shares, and I can give you all the voting rights. Also...Out of this 500 million, 100 million can be used to cash out to the shareholders. ”

The moment MA Huayuan said this, Ma Yun, who had wanted to mock him, was stunned.

Even Xia ruofei could not help but feel slightly tempted.

It had to be said that MA Huasheng’s conditions were simply too good.

The estimated value of paradise Corporation was more than a billion, and at most, it was less than two billion. However, MA huasu had directly given a valuation of five billion. Moreover, 500 million Yuan for 10% of the shares was a pure investment. They didn’t even need to vote. In addition, 100 million could be cashed out to the shareholders.

In general, the money obtained from corporate financing had to be invested in the business operation. Only when both parties agreed in advance could a certain proportion be cashed out.

Of course, with Xia ruofei’s current stock ratio, the so – called shareholder cash – out was basically him alone.

Xia ruofei had not invested a lot of money into the development of paradise Corporation. After transferring 10% of the shares, he could cash out 100 million Yuan. He still had more than 80% of the company’s shares and had absolute control over the company.

If it were any other entrepreneur, their brain would have been blown away by this sudden happiness, and they would have most likely agreed to MA huasu’s financing plan.

However, the Paradise Corporation was not in need of money, and Xia ruofei was even more so. He would not dilute his shares for a few hundred million Yuan.

Hence, Xia ruofei was only a little moved at that moment. He quickly put on an apologetic smile and said, ” “I’m sorry, brother MA. The company doesn’t have any plans for financing yet. If I need financing in the future, I will consider Penguin Group first.”

MA Huatang couldn’t help but show a hint of disappointment, but little ma had always maintained his demeanor. He quickly smiled and nodded. “Alright! Don’t you forget! Also ... Whenever you need funds, you can contact me directly. My financing plan will always be effective.”

“No problem! Thank you for your appreciation, brother MA!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Financing was sometimes like a gamble. Most premium financing was nothing more than a good outlook for the future of the startup. To put it bluntly, the premium part was just a bet on the future prospects.

It was obvious that MA huasu was very optimistic about the future of paradise Corporation.

Ma Yun immediately said,” President Xia, our gold mining Group is also very interested!” If you need financing, don’t forget me! And don’t we have a cooperative relationship? Don’t let your own fertile water flow into others “fields!”

Liu Dong, Cheng Cheng, and the others also expressed their interest in investing in paradise Corporation.

Xia ruofei happily agreed to an empty check like Wanwan. Xia ruofei could write whatever he wanted. He was just doing her a favor. He had no intention of listing paradise Corporation, so it was even more impossible for him to raise funds.

Xia ruofei had a good time talking to these tech entrepreneurs. They were all outstanding in the tech industry and had rich experience in managing businesses. Many of their opinions inspired Xia ruofei.

During the conversation, Xia ruofei noticed that Liu Dong, who was usually forthright, did not seem to be in a good mood today. In fact, there was a hint of worry between his brows.

Xia ruofei felt a little strange. Coincidentally, Liu Dong was sitting beside him. Xia ruofei leaned over and asked in a low voice, ” “Chief Liu, I don’t think you’re in a good mood! Did you encounter any difficulties? “
