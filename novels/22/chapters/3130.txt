Chapter 3131  A bold test (2)

  "Brother Chen, have you gotten used to working in our company these days?" Xia ruofei asked.

  "It's pretty good. " Chen Xuan smiled and said,"I'm just like everyone else. I clock in to work every day, eat in the company cafeteria, and occasionally go back at night to cook my own meal. It's a very fresh experience for me to be able to feel the joy, anger, sorrow, and joy of ordinary people at close range. It's indeed very beneficial for the cultivation of my mind. "

  In fact, it was more important for Chen Xuan to accumulate his cultivation at this stage. Therefore, compared to entering the secular world to train, it was better for him to cultivate in the heavenly abode. Once he met with a bottleneck, he would enter the secular world to cultivate and find an opportunity to break through.

  However, Chen Xuan's personality was more peaceful. Coupled with the orders from his father, Chen Nanfeng, he quickly adjusted his mentality. Since he was already here, he would take things as they came. He started his training journey calmly. He had really experienced the ups and downs of the ordinary people in the secular world.

  Xia ruofei poured the tea into a tea cup and passed it to Chen Xuan. Then, he smiled and asked,""The people in the research department didn't purposely make things difficult for you, right? Tell me directly if you've suffered any grievances, I'll deal with them!"

  Actually, Xia ruofei was also worried that the people in the development Department would be jealous of Chen Xuan and deliberately make things difficult for him. If they angered this man, the company would be in chaos and a life could be lost in a matter of minutes! As the saying goes,'the emperor's blood flows when he's angry', Chen Xuan's ability was much stronger than those emperors of the secular world!

  If something really happened, Xia ruofei would rather stand up for Chen Xuan himself and deal with a few employees. As long as Chen Xuan was not angry, it would be fine.

  "Brother Xia, please don't do that! And don't just go and ask me to give you a special treatment! Otherwise, it'll be meaningless!" Chen Xuan waved his hands.

  Chen Xuan seemed to be able to guess Xia ruofei's concern, so he said seriously,""Brother Xia, don't worry, everyone in the research department is treating me well. Even if the situation you're talking about happens, I'm just an Aurous core stage cultivator, how can I stoop to the level of ordinary people? Besides, suffering grievances is also a way to temper one's heart!"

  Xia ruofei nodded and said,"okay!" "But I still hope that brother Chen can finish the training as soon as possible ... Our paradise corporation's temple is too small. If a great God like you kneels there, I'll be on tenterhooks all day long ..." Chen Xuan revealed an awkward expression and said,""It shouldn't be too long! Director Feng has placed great importance on this Paradise Mall project. Recently, he has been strengthening the development force, and our progress has been greatly accelerated. I estimate that in less than a month, we should be able to develop the internal version. As for the subsequent tests and adjustments, I don't need to participate. By then, brother Xia doesn't need to chase me away, I will take the initiative to leave. "

  "Let's hope so ..." Xia ruofei said as he made up his mind. He would ask Feng Jing to hire more   "Dinner's ready!"Song Wei said with a smile. You guys can come over and chat while eating!"

  Xia ruofei nodded and said,"I'm coming!"

  Then, he put down his teacup, stood up, and said,""Brother Chen, let's go have dinner! You're used to eating the delicacies of the cultivation world, so today you should try the home - cooked food of the secular world. I hope you don't mind. "

small amount of spiritual Qi. With Xia ruofei's background as a 'nascent soul realm disciple', it was 22:57

normal for him to take out wine that contained a little spiritual Qi. It was just right for his identity!

  "I've been eating home - cooked food from the secular world recently!"Chen Xuan replied with a smile. For example, I think the food in our company's cafeteria is pretty good! Besides, even in the sect, the ingredients we eat are actually similar to the ingredients in the secular world. The legendary spiritual rice and other such ingredients have already become rare due to the deterioration of the cultivation environment. "

  Xia ruofei touched his nose and smiled.""That's true! In fact, it's not easy for cultivators nowadays ..."

  The two of them walked to the dining table. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue quickly brought out the dishes that had been prepared in the kitchen. There were indeed some common home - cooked dishes such as boiled fish, braised beef, cabbage in vinegar sauce, bitter gourd soup ... However, Xia ruofei and Song Wei's cooking skills were not bad, so these home - cooked dishes looked good. They also exuded a fragrant smell that greatly increased one's appetite.

  Xia ruofei took out two bottles of white wine from the spirit map space and said with a smile,""Brother Chen, let's try this Western wine today! I think you don't usually drink much. "

  This Semillon wine was brewed in Australia's West Winery. However, Xia ruofei had stored it in the spirit map space for quite a long time, so the taste should be very good.

  Of course, there was definitely some spiritual energy in the wine. With Chen Xuan's standards, he was naturally able to tell.

  However, wine was different from other ingredients. Many cultivators would store good wine in their cultivation cellars that were rich in spiritual Qi. Therefore, it was normal for wine to contain a small amount of spiritual Qi. With Xia ruofei's background as a 'nascent soul realm disciple', it was normal for him to take out wine that contained a little spiritual Qi. It was just right for his identity!

  "Our company in the secular world does have some Western wine, but we really don't drink much. It seems like I'm in luck today!" Chen Xuan said with a smile. Chen Xuan revealed an awkward expression as he replied,""It shouldn't be too long! Director Feng has placed great importance on this Paradise Mall project. Recently, he has been strengthening the development force, and our progress has been greatly accelerated. I estimate that in less than a month, we should be able to develop the internal version. As for the subsequent tests and adjustments, I don't need to participate. By then, brother Xia doesn't need to chase me away, I will take the initiative to leave. "

  "Let's hope so ..." Xia ruofei said as he made up his mind. He would ask Feng Jing to hire more programmers tomorrow. It would be best if he could poach two big names in the industry. The development of Paradise Mall could continue to speed up! As long as he could get Chen Xuan to leave as soon as possible, spending a little more money and hiring a few more people was nothing.

  After the two of them had some tea, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue carried the dinner they had prepared out of the kitchen.

  "Dinner's ready!"Song Wei said with a smile. You guys can come over and chat while eating!"

  Xia ruofei nodded and said,"I’m coming!"

  Then, he put down his teacup, stood up, and said," "Brother Chen, let's go have dinner! You're used to eating the delicacies of the cultivation world, so today you should try the home - cooked food of the secular world. I hope you don't mind. "
