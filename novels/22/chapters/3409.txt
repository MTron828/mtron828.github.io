Chapter 3410: The might of the formation (2) FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Translator: 549690339

Grand cloud scholar was considered an expert. He could tell at a glance that the scales of victory were greatly leaning towards Xia ruofei.

Normal trapping arrays, even Xia ruofei’s tried and tested trap & lull array, would find it difficult to trap a golden thread nether snake that was close to the early stage of the original level. It could also be easily destroyed by violence. Only spatial arrays could be broken by the layers of space. Although the snake tried to break the array with force, it could not damage the materials used to set the array. Therefore, it could not cause any damage to the array itself.

The nine revolutions space – splitting formation’s most prominent feature was that it created an endless amount of small spaces. In addition, the golden thread nether snake’s innate talent in space was far lower than the average. It could be said that the golden thread nether snake and the realm Fox were two extremes in terms of innate talent in space. The golden thread nether snake only knew how to use brute force to destroy small spaces, and the speed at which it destroyed them was even slower than the speed at which the formation created new small spaces. In this way, once it was trapped by the formation… It would be almost impossible to break out of the formation again.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have to thank senior for your reminder!” If it wasn’t for Grand cloud’s guidance, 1 wouldn’t have known that the goldthread nether snake’s perception of space would be so weak.”

Generally speaking, those who were able to reach the peak of the advanced Aurous core stage and were close to the beginner nascent Soul Stage would not be too bad in the aspect of space. For normal cultivators at the peak of the advanced Aurous core stage, such as Chen Xuan’s father, Chen Nanfeng, even if he did not specialize in the laws of space, he would naturally come into contact with various laws at this level, including the laws of space.

In other words, if Chen Nanfeng had been trapped in the nine turn space – splitting formation, he would have performed much better than the goldthread nether snake.

Xia ruofei didn’t know much about the goldthread nether snake. If it wasn’t for the guidance of scholar Yuntai, he wouldn’t have thought of using a spatial attribute array to deal with the snake.

Scholar Yuntai smiled bitterly and said,”I just happened to know the weakness of this golden thread nether snake. It’s mainly because fellow Daoist Xia’s attainments in the Dao of arrays and understanding of the rules of space have reached an extremely high level. Otherwise, even if you knew the weakness of the snake, ordinary people wouldn’t be able to find a way to deal with it in such a short time!” So, there’s no need to thank me ii

…

“That’s true, but I still have to thank him!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He didn’t chat much with scholar Yuntai, because the goldthread nether snake was still trapped in the formation. He still needed to stay focused and control the formation.

The nine turn space splitting formation was naturally not as simple as a space cage. Otherwise, it would not have been impossible for ordinary golden core cultivators to set it up.

Its attacks were also extremely Swift and fierce.

Even if it was Xia ruofei himself, if he was trapped in such a formation, he would be in a very sorry state. If he was not careful, he might lose his life on the spot.

Seeing that the formation had stabilized and that the goldthread nether snake was trapped, Xia ruofei was relieved. Thus, he made a hand seal and skillfully sent it into the core of the array.

The nine turn space splitting formation immediately underwent a change. Streams of energy circulated within the formation patterns, and the momentum was extremely shocking.

The goldthread nether snake was on the verge of going crazy. It couldn’t even remember how many small spaces it had broken, but every time it broke open a space, it was faced with the same scene. It was as if the small spaces were endless.

Moreover, it was completely relying on its tyrannical body to break through the space, so it was naturally impossible for it to not consume any energy.

In addition, after the space was shattered, it would also cause damage to it.

Although this kind of injury was basically nothing to it, it would eventually become unbearable after a long time. The scales on its back were already damaged in two places, and it was bleeding a lot.

These were all superficial wounds and had no effect on it for the time being. However, it had been trapped in this formation for a long time, which made it impatient. This was the first time it had suffered such a big loss.

Suddenly, a crack appeared in the space in front of the snake.

The goldthread nether snake was charging forward with all its might. In fact, it had been barging around like this all this time without any strategy. It crashed into the dark spatial crack.

The goldthread nether snake let out a shrill hiss.

A wound so deep that its bones could be seen appeared on its huge snake head, and blood spurted out.

The snake’s fleshly body was far stronger than that of ordinary golden core cultivators, and even nascent soul cultivators couldn’t compare to it. Otherwise, it would have already been beheaded.

If an ordinary person were to encounter such a spatial Rift, then the part of the body that came into contact with the spatial Rift would immediately disappear without a sound. This was because that part of the body had already entered another space, and naturally separated from the body.

It was only because the snake’s body was extremely strong that it was able to withstand the terrifying tearing of the spatial crack.

Even so, the goldthread nether snake was severely injured by the spatial tear.

The goldthread nether snake’s huge body curled up in pain, and then it started to writhe madly.

Fortunately, its physical condition was indeed unique. With such a deep wound, an ordinary person would definitely lose their combat ability in an instant. However, it only took a few seconds for the wound to stop bleeding and even begin to heal faintly.

The goldthread nether snake’s rage points soared, but it could not be used. Xia ruofei did not even want to fight it head – on. It was still facing the endless spatial cage.

Moreover, the terrifying spatial rifts were increasing in number. The goldthread nether snake’s initial anger had turned into a trace of fear.

It didn’t even dare to charge around recklessly like it did when it was trapped in the formation.

Because it didn’t know where the spatial Rift that it feared would suddenly appear.

The location of the spatial Rift was completely random, and it was silent.

In addition, the goldthread nether snake’s talent in space was too poor. It couldn’t sense any spatial fluctuations, so it was even more difficult to predict.

It had to be on guard at all times to avoid the spatial rifts that appeared randomly.

The golden thread nether snake’s huge body was usually its greatest advantage, but now it had become a burden. The area it had to cover had also increased by a lot.

As the spatial rifts increased in number and frequency, the goldthread nether snake didn’t even dare to rashly break through the spatial cage. It didn’t have the energy to do anything other than defend itself.

The goldthread nether snake had just twisted its huge body to avoid a spatial crack.

These spatial rifts appeared without any warning or sound, so the goldthread nether snake had to maintain a high level of concentration. Its huge body was almost twisted into a fried dough twist. Fortunately, spatial rifts were very unstable and could not be maintained for too long. They would then disappear on their own.

Otherwise, no matter how strong the body of the golden thread nether snake was or how agile its reaction was, it wouldn’t be able to last long.

Even so, there were still six or seven deep and terrifying wounds on its body. It was impossible for it to completely avoid all the spatial cracks, and no matter how strong its recovery ability was, it could not withstand the constant injuries.

Outside the formation, Xia ruofei was paying close attention to the goldthread nether snake’s condition.

The scale of victory was leaning towards Xia ruofei’s side.

What he had to do was to maintain the stability of the formation and add another straw to the camel’s back.

Xia ruofei looked at the battered and exhausted goldthread nether snake inside the formation. He muttered to himself, then formed a hand seal and skillfully sent it into the core of the formation.

Within the nine turn space – splitting formation, the goldthread nether snake had not even had time to catch its breath when it heard a Sonic Boom.

It didn’t even have time to react before it felt a sharp pain on its body. A part of its hard scales was directly blown off.

Immediately after, there was another sound of air breaking. This time, it came from the front. The goldthread nether snake finally saw it clearly. Its eyes were filled with horror. It was an extremely sharp spatial wind blade. It was obvious that it had been injured by the same spatial wind blade.

This was really a case of a house leaking when it rained overnight!
