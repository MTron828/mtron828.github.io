2833 Public opinion storm Part

At Seveno’ clock in the morning, the Chinese netizens gradually realized that this was the rush hour for many people to go to work. When everyone was taking the bus or subway, many people were used to scrolling through Weibo and looking at the headlines. It could be said that this fragmented period was actually the time when social media users were more active.

Soon, a few sports verified accounts reposted on Weibo. These verified accounts had at least a few million fans, and some even had tens of millions of fans. Naturally, their spreading ability was very terrifying. In addition, the netizens also reposted it one after another, and this news quickly spread on the internet.

Some of Xia ruofei’s fans saw the news and uploaded the videos and screenshots to the forum.

Especially Xia ruofei’s Tieba, which was the headquarters of Facebook!

When the forum members saw this message, they immediately exploded.

How could this be?

Pablo’s arrogant attitude these past two days had already made his friends very unhappy. Although everyone’s United will had easily taken down Pablo’s Facebook and flooded the comments section, it didn’t actually affect Pablo much.

Shameless people were invincible. Pablo didn’t care about the criticism and mockery from the Chinese netizens at all. In fact, he was even smug about it. He even posted a few posts as a show of force, just short of the words “I like to see you guys unhappy with me but helpless against me.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Chinese netizens were suffering because they didn’t have any solid evidence in their hands, but now that this news came out, wasn’t it like a pillow when they were sleepy?

As a result, many of the forum members who had just started work or just woken up began calling for everyone to challenge Facebook again. This time, everyone was full of confidence and had to beat down Pablo’s arrogance.

Some of the forum members had just arrived at the office and were just habitually opening the Tieba forum on their mobile phones to take a look. As a result, they saw a group of forum members rubbing their fists and getting ready to go to war. They were still unclear about the situation and quickly posted questions. The enthusiastic forum members asked them to take a look at the post that was already at the top of the forum.

For a time, the popularity of Tieba continued to rise, and everyone called their friends to report.

The administrator of Xia ruofei’s Tieba made a post, calling for everyone to take action at 9 a.m. If they had the conditions to do so. They would go to Pablo’s Facebook. The forum members below responded one after another and expressed that they could participate. There were at least a few thousand forum members.

At around 8:40 am, everyone was ready and went to Pablo’s Facebook page. They found the video of Pablo’s interview with the so – called balsa annual pass member. The video was the most ironic and had been proven to be completely fake news.

At 9 am, the forum members immediately copied, pasted, and posted their comments according to the script they had prepared beforehand.

Everyone’s comments had the small logo of the Chinese flag and the words “watching Pablo get slapped in the face”. The content of the comments had been translated in Spanish and Chinese.

“People who make up fake news don’t deserve to be reporters! Hurry up and get lost!”

“I’ll just ask you one thing. Does your face hurt?”

“What about Mr. Mayers? Let’s take a walk!”

……

Originally, there were many comments left by bar?a fans below the video, expressing their satisfaction. The Spanish fans, including the Chinese netizens, did not leave any comments under the video when they saw Pablo take out such “solid evidence.” Otherwise, it would inevitably attract the ridicule of the bar?a fans, which would be even worse.

However, after the unified action of the netizens on China’s Tieba, those comments from before were not spared either. All of them were ridiculed by the replies, and in a short while, they were all pushed to the bottom and could not be seen at all.

When the netizens of China’s Tieba left their comments in groups, it was almost threeo’ clock in the morning in Spain. Pablo, the main character of this storm of public opinion, was not sleepy at all. He was sitting on the sofa in the chief editor’s office of “sports daily” as if he had lost his parents, his face as pale as paper.

In fact, Pablo had been on cloud nine just a few hours ago.

He hooked up with a beautiful woman at the bar. Of course, this had nothing to do with his personal charm. In fact, this woman was a prostitute. He treated her to a few drinks and went with the flow into his arms.

Just as Pablo was itching to take this new woman out to a hotel, she suddenly mentioned that she urgently needed 500 euros. If Pablo could provide her with the money, she wouldn’t mind spending the night with Pablo.

Pablo had just received a bonus a few days ago. It was because of his outstanding performance in the fountain incident that the news agency had awarded him with almost 1000 euros. At this time, he, who had long been burning with desire, was generous for once. Without hesitation, he took out his wallet, counted 500 euros, and handed it to the beautiful woman.

Then, the two of them left the bar in each other’s arms. They found an express hotel and couldn’t wait to get into the room.

Just as he was fantasizing about conquering thousands of beautiful women, his mobile phone rang urgently.

Pablo didn’t want to pay attention to the call, but as soon as it stopped, it rang again. It was clear that the other party was persistent in calling him.

Pablo had already lost all interest. He cursed as he got off the bed. He grabbed his phone and was about to give the other party a good scolding when he realized that the caller ID was actually the big boss of the editorial department.

A small – time first – line reporter like him usually had no chance of coming into contact with the managing editor. The chief editor could already order him around. Now that the managing editor was calling him personally so late at night, he could not help but shiver.

He quickly made a shushing gesture to the lazy woman on the bed and immediately answered the phone.

“Chief editor, I’m sorry, I just ...” Pablo said in a flattering manner.

“Pablo!” The managing editor didn’t wait for Pablo to finish before he roared,”you idiot! Get your ass to the news agency right now! Immediately!”

After saying that, the managing editor hung up the phone without waiting for Pablo to reply.

Pablo was dumbfounded. He didn’t even realize that the other party had already hung up. He still maintained his posture of answering the phone, his eyes intertwined with shock, confusion, and uneasiness.

“What’s wrong, my dear?” The Golden – haired woman twisted her body and asked in a sweet voice.

The woman who had made Pablo so entranced no longer held any attraction in his eyes.

Pablo calmed down and quickly put on his clothes as he said,””I have something urgent to attend to, I have to leave immediately!”

The Golden – haired woman leaned over from behind and wrapped her smooth arm around Pablo’s body.”But we’ve just started ...”

Pablo impatiently shook off her arm and said,””I must leave immediately! I’ve already paid for the room here, so you can leave after dawn. If you’re really lonely and can’t stand it, you can find another man!”

With that, Pablo picked up his phone and left the room without looking back.

The blonde woman’s eyes flashed with embarrassment and anger as she looked in the direction Pablo had disappeared. She muttered to herself,”Bastard! If it wasn’t for the 500 euros, no one would be willing to sleep with a soft egg like you!”

After that, she lay down lazily and reached for her phone to look for her address book. She was surprised that she actually called a man she often hung out with and asked him to come over.
