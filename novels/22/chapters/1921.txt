Chapter 1922 Remote command (2)

Soon, the security guard in the security room opened the window and made an OK gesture. The security guard who came to check immediately took a step back and said,””You can go in now, thank you for your cooperation!”

The bar slowly rose, and the Jinbei van drove smoothly into the West Lake Mansion community.

“Uncle Dong, which building is it on that floor?” asked Liu Da.

“He hasn’t given me any new information yet ...” Liu Dong’s voice was trembling.

Liu Da complained,”one look and I can tell that he’s not in a good mood!” It’s just a small matter, like squeezing toothpaste ...”

As soon as Da Liu’s voice fell, justice is not absent seemed to have heard it. A new message was immediately sent over, with only two words: Three buildings!

Liu Dong silently turned his phone screen to Liu Da.

“Fuck!” Da Liu cursed, then said to the driver,”drive to Block 3!”

“Alright, brother da!” The driver said.

The Jinbei van stopped next to the third building. Liu Dong, Liu Da, and the other lackeys all got out of the car.

Da Liu and the others kept a low profile. The guys they brought were all hidden in their coats. Only two of them were carrying paint barrels, which looked a little strange.

The group of them arrived at the entrance of the unit.

“Motherf * cker! We don’t know the password!” Da Liu said.

If it was in Building 1, it would be easy. He would call da Qiang and ask Da Qiang to help him press the open button.

However, it was in Block 3. Even if he asked da Qiang, the owner, it was impossible for him to know the password to the unit of the other building!

“Da, he sent another message. It’s a string of numbers. Could it be the unit’s password?” Liu Dong suddenly called out.

“Won’t you know if you try?” Da Liu said. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Then, he gave one of his underlings a look. The underlings took the phone from Liu Dong’s hand, walked to the front of the unit, and entered the string of numbers.

With a click, the unit door opened.

“He’s really good!” Da Liu said,”let’s go in!”

The group walked into Building No. 3.

“He didn’t say the specific house number!” “Where are we going to find them?” Liu Dong asked.

Da Liu lazily said,”just wait!” I’m sure this guy who can’t see the light must be watching our every move from some corner! We’re already here, he’ll definitely let us see that adulterous couple ...”

Sure enough, not long after,’justice is not absent’ sent another WeChat message: He turned right and walked up the stairs to the 8th floor.

“8th floor!” Liu Dong’s voice trembled as he spoke.

“Let’s go!” Da Liu waved his hand and was about to walk to the elevator.

“Da, he told us to take the stairs ...” Liu Dong quickly said.

“There’s an elevator, but you didn’t take it. Are you stupid?” Da Liu pursed his lips and said,”uncle Dong, ignore him. Let’s just take the elevator!”

After that, he was the first to step into the elevator. Liu Dong and his lackeys naturally followed him in.

“8th floor, right?” Da Liu said as he pressed the button for the 8th floor.

There was no response.

Da Liu couldn’t believe it. He pressed the button for the 8th floor a few more times, but the button didn’t light up, and the elevator stayed on the first floor.

At this time, one of the underlings pointed at the bottom of the floor button and said carefully,””Brother da, does this ... Require a card to use?”

After being reminded, Da Liu also saw the black credit card area. He slapped the back of the underling’s head and said,””Why didn’t you say so earlier?”

The underling was full of grievances, but he didn’t dare to show it. He just lowered his head and looked at his feet.

So, after a round of trouble, Da Liu, who didn’t believe in evil, had to follow the instructions of justice is not absent and lead everyone up the stairs.

Continuously climbing the stairs was actually very physically exhausting.

When they reached the eighth floor, their breathing became a little heavy.

Da Liu took the mineral water from his underling and took two sips. He asked,””I still haven’t given you a room number?”

“No, I didn ‘t!” Liu Dong said.

“I think there are only two households on this floor. Why don’t we go and check it out first?” Da Liu said.

Liu Dong could not help but feel tempted when he heard that, especially when he thought of the possibility that Fang Chenchen and the man were in one of the two houses. He could not wait any longer.

Justice is not absent had led them to the eighth floor, and they naturally thought that Fang Chenchen and her “adulterer” were staying on the eighth floor.

Just then,’justice is not absent’ sent another message. Don’t act on your own, or you’ll never be able to find Fang Chenchen’s real stop!

Liu Dong’s restless mind was immediately frightened back, and he quickly said,””Little da, wait!”

“Is there any new information?” Da Liu asked casually,”which one is it?”

“He didn’t say anything. He only warned us not to act on our own, or he won’t tell us anything else ...” Liu Dong said.

Da Liu subconsciously felt a little repulsed. He said,””What are you bragging about! There are only two houses on the eighth floor, we can keep an eye on Fang Chenchen until ...”

The more Da Liu spoke, the less confident he was. He was thinking about what happened in the elevator just now.

So far, the mysterious justice is not absent had not made any mistakes. It was as if he had been following them all the time and knew everything that happened here like the back of his hand.
