Chapter 1103: Meeting miss Lu by chance (1)

Translator: 549690339

Song Rui’s table was the closest to the door. The people who sat with him were all young people. Some of them looked similar to song Rui and were probably his uncles and sisters. There were also a few who were probably the nephews of the leaders that Xia ruofei had just met.

These young people naturally did not surprise Xia ruofei. He was stunned because he saw Lu You, who was sitting beside song Rui.

Xia ruofei didn’t expect to meet Lu You here. However, after thinking about it, he understood that ran ran and Tian Huilan were hoping to become in – laws with song Zhengping. Although they no longer forced Lu You to date song Rui, Tian Huilan would definitely call Lu You over for an occasion like elder song’s birthday. This would at least allow Lu You and song Rui to get to know each other better!

Song Rui, who was sitting beside Lu You, felt very uncomfortable. When he saw Xia ruofei enter, his eyes rolled around. He stood up and waved.”RUO Fei, come and sit here!”

He then nudged the young man beside him and said,””Song Wei, move to the side ...”

There happened to be an empty seat next to this young man called Song Wei. He thought that song Rui wanted to sit with Xia ruofei and hurriedly stood up to move an empty seat to the side. Song Rui was the eldest son of the eldest son and had a lot of prestige among the younger generation.

To Song Wei’s surprise, after he gave up his seat, song Rui also moved over and sat on the seat that he had just been sitting on.

This way, there was an empty seat between song Rui and Lu You.

Song Rui smiled and pointed at the seat.””Ruofei, what are you doing? Come and sit down!”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui speechlessly. He knew exactly what song Rui was thinking. However, he did not hesitate or decline. He strode over and sat down.

The young people at the table were all stunned.

Everyone in their circle knew that song Zhengping hoped to be in – laws with Tian Huilan. In their opinion, as long as the elders had this intention, then song Rui and Lu You would definitely get married in the end. Whether the two of them were willing or not, like or not, the result would not change.

It was the same for them. Marriage served the family and politics. It had nothing to do with feelings. They could have eight to ten mistresses outside. They could also indulge in debauchery. Their wives might even have a gigolo outside. However, they had to maintain their relationship on the surface.

Therefore, it was normal for song Rui and Lu You to sit together.

Now, song Rui had given his seat to this ‘RUO Fei’ who looked a little unfamiliar, and this young man actually did not decline modestly and really sat down. He was stuck between song Rui and Lu You. No matter how one looked at it, the combination of these three people felt strange.

After Xia ruofei sat down, he turned to Lu You and smiled.””Long time no see! How have you been?”

Lu You took a sip of red wine and said calmly,””I’m just an ordinary student. All I do every day is do experiments and write papers! It’s not as exciting as a Big boss’s life!”

The young people at this table couldn’t help but widen their eyes, their faces full of disbelief.

After Xia ruofei sat down, he did not speak to song Rui. Instead, he went to chat with Lu You. To everyone, this was an act of openly stealing someone’s girlfriend! Song Rui didn’t seem to mind. He sat there with a smile and seemed very happy.

In fact, these young people did not know that Xia ruofei and song Rui were so close. There was no need for small talk. On the other hand, it had indeed been a long time since they had contacted Lu You. Before Tian Huilan had gone to the capital, she had even asked him to help take care of Lu You. However, the lazy Xia ruofei had almost never contacted Lu You, so he felt a little uneasy. Moreover, he and Lu You were considered good friends. It was normal for them to exchange a few words after not seeing each other for such a long time.

If Xia ruofei’s Public Act of ‘stealing’ someone’s girlfriend had made these young people’s jaws drop, then Lu youfei’s reaction was even more shocking.

Everyone in the industry knew that Lu You’s personality was very cold and she had never been polite to the opposite sex. However, even though Lu You’s tone was cold when she spoke to Xia ruofei just now, she had said so much. Moreover, it seemed that the two of them were very familiar with each other. This was really beyond everyone’s expectations.

Xia ruofei did not care about the strange looks from the young people. He smiled and said to Lu You,”I have a small business, how can I be considered a Big Boss! Don’t make fun of me ...”

Lu You’s beautiful eyes revealed a faint smile. She glanced at Xia ruofei and said,””You’re much richer than me anyway ...”

Lu You’s cold outer shell seemed to have melted in front of Xia ruofei. In fact, after being saved by Xia ruofei at the bar, Lu You’s feelings for Xia ruofei were very different from before. After being saved by Xia ruofei, Lu You vomited all over and got drunk. Xia ruofei even helped her change her undergarments. Every time she thought of this man seeing her body, Lu You would always have a strange feeling.

Today, Lu You did not know that Xia ruofei would be attending the birthday banquet as well. Hence, when she saw Xia ruofei walk into the southern room, she could not help but look surprised. However, everyone’s attention was on Xia ruofei, so no one noticed.
