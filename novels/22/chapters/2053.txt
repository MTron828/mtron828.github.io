Xia ruofei and Monica sat in the car that had originally belonged to Calas. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

One of the men placed Xia ruofei’s luggage into the trunk and got into another black Mercedes – Benz. The other man sat in the passenger seat of the Bentley.

The two cars started slowly, and the Mercedes – Benz led the way. They drove out of the airport one after the other and headed to the manor in the suburbs.

Along the way, Monica was in high spirits as she introduced the buildings and historical sites along the way to Xia ruofei. Although Xia ruofei had just been to Turin not long ago, he still listened with great interest.

The last time he was here, all he wanted was to solve Monica’s problem. He didn’t have the time to tour doling city.

Moreover, even if he knew the scenery like the back of his hand, having a hot beauty snuggling up to him and explaining it to him was in itself a pleasant sight.

After they passed through the city, Monica shut her mouth and quietly leaned on Xia ruofei.

After they got into the car, Monica held Xia ruofei’s arm tightly and did not let go for a moment.

After surviving the disaster, she seemed to have a new understanding of the meaning of life. She did not care if Xia ruofei had a woman in Huaxia or if they could have a happy ending in the future. The only thing in her heart was to grasp the happiness in front of her.

Xia ruofei also felt Monica’s attachment to him. He gently held Monica’s delicate hand. Their heads were close together, feeling the long – awaited warmth.

The cars drove into the Grao family’s small Manor one after another and slowly stopped in front of the largest house in the manor.

The driver and the burly man in the front passenger seat quickly got out of the car and opened the doors on both sides.

Xia ruofei and Monica got off the car.

Monica smiled and said,”Xia, this is my home!” I’ve grown up in this Manor since I was a child. It’s been more than 20 years, but it’s still exactly the same as before. There’s almost no change!”

This was the second time Xia ruofei had come to the manor. The last time was a few days ago when he brought his brothers from the Turin branch to support Monica and witnessed Monica taking charge of the family.

Of course, he still cooperated and pretended to be here for the first time, looking around with a trace of curiosity.

Monica laughed and said,”let’s go!” I’ll show you around!”

Then, Monica held Xia ruofei’s arm and walked in.

The exterior of the house looked a little old, and one could tell at a glance that it was an old building.

In fact, there were many such ancient buildings in Europe that had been well preserved. Therefore, many Chinese people who traveled to Europe would feel that many places were not as prosperous as China’s capital and Shen Cheng, which were international metropolises. However, they could feel the strong cultural atmosphere.

As Monica walked past with Xia ruofei, people kept bowing to her and greeting her.

It could be seen that Monica had established her own prestige in just a few days. Xia ruofei was very happy to see this.

He was filled with a sense of achievement. Although Monica and Rossi, as well as his brothers in the Hong sect, did not know that he was the “Xia Tian” who had led the Hong sect on a killing spree a few days ago, it did not affect the sense of achievement in his heart.

The first floor was a tall Hall with beautiful interior decoration and a strong European style.

Two big men with Asian faces were sitting on the sofa. When they saw Monica walking in with a young man, they narrowed their eyes at the same time and stood up.

They walked in front of the two men. One of them sized Xia ruofei up and asked in Chinese,””A Chinese?”

Xia ruofei naturally recognized the two of them. One of them was called ah Yong, and the other was called Ah Hua. A few days ago, he had incited the Hong sect’s Turin branch to temporarily keep the two of them in the Grasso family. Of course, his purpose was to support Monica.

Now that Xia ruofei had come to Turin with his real identity, he had to pretend that he did not know the two.

He revealed an expression of pleasant surprise and said,””Yup! You’re Chinese too?”

The big man nodded slightly and said indifferently,””I haven’t asked for your name, Sir!”

In the eyes of ah Yong, Ah Hua, and even the brothers from the Hong sect’s Turin branch, Monica and Mr. Xia were very close. Of course, Mr. Xia was referring to Xia Yingluo, who had shown her strength a few days ago. When they saw Monica being so close to another young man, they naturally felt a little hostile.

It was for Monica’s sake that “Mr. Xia” went on a killing spree. He even used the power of the Hong sect’s branch in Turin and paid a certain price.

From their point of view,”Mr. Xia” had spared no effort, so he must be interested in Monica. After that night,”Mr. Xia” had become a very important figure in the eyes of the Hong sect members. Although this young man was from China, he was also Mr. Xia’s love rival!

Xia ruofei smiled kindly and said,””I’m Xia ruofei! He’s Monica’s boyfriend!”

Ah Yong’s expression changed slightly when he heard that. What he was afraid of really happened! Mr. Xia shouldn’t have left in such a hurry. He had already done his best to help Monica. It was not easy for things to settle down and the dark clouds in the sky to disperse. It was the best time to launch a Love Attack! She didn’t expect Mr. Xia to leave so suddenly. Look, her real boyfriend had appeared! It seemed like Mr. Xia’s chances were slim ...

“Xia, these two are the people that the Hong sect sent to help me. This is ah Yong, and this is Ah Hua. They’re both elites of the Hong sect!” Monica said.

“Nice to meet you!” Xia ruofei had a warm smile on his face as he nodded.

Although ah Yong and Ah Hua had a faint hostility towards Xia ruofei, they also knew that this was not something they could interfere with. Furthermore, Lu zhengfeng had specifically emphasized that the two of them were here to support the Grasso family. How could they overstep their boundaries in matters of love like this?

So, the two of them looked at each other, nodded at Xia ruofei in tacit understanding, and then ignored him.

“Xia, the two brothers from the Hong sect don’t like to talk, please don’t mind them!” Monica explained softly.

“They’ve helped you so much,” Xia ruofei chuckled.”Why would I mind?”

Monica let out a sigh of relief. She nodded and said,””Let’s go! I’ll take you on a tour!”

Monica really brought Xia ruofei around the place. She had grown up here and there were many beautiful memories of her childhood. To her, this house naturally meant a lot, so she brought Xia ruofei around the place.

Finally, Monica brought Xia ruofei to a bedroom upstairs. She pushed the door open and smiled.”This is my room, come in and take a look!”

Xia ruofei nodded and followed Monica into the room.

Monica closed the door with her feet. At the same time, she hugged Xia ruofei and took the initiative to kiss him emotionally.

Xia ruofei had already held it in for many days. How could he resist such temptation?

However, there was still a trace of rationality left in his heart, and he said vaguely,””Monica, your brother is still waiting for me to treat him!”

“He’s been in a wheelchair for so many years, he doesn’t mind sitting a little longer!” Monica said vaguely,”Xia, I’m the one who needs you more now ...”

Monica’s words completely ignited the fire that Xia ruofei had been accumulating for many days. He seemed to have transformed into a beast driven by his instincts. He carried Monica by the waist and strode into the room. He threw Monica on the soft bed and pressed her down impatiently ...
