Zhao Zhenghao smiled and said,”don’t worry about that, Mr. Xia. Before I came here, I have communicated with Lippi through Mr. Xu of Hengda group. I have reached a certain consensus with the coaching team. There should be no problem!”

It was rumored that the Hengda group was responsible for the sky – High annual salary of Lippi’s team. It seemed to be true. It was estimated that if the Football Association communicated directly with Lippi’s team, it would be difficult to get the other party’s consent, so they had to involve Hengda group’s Xu Jiaying, the big gold Sponsor.

Zhao Zhenghao continued,”moreover, everyone has the same goal, which is to do their best to ensure that the national football team can qualify for the World Cup qualifiers. In order to achieve this goal, it’s certainly not a problem to make some changes.” Lippi also specifically learned about your situation and studied the video of your last appearance on behalf of Spain. He acknowledges your ability. It’s just that there’s too little information, so he thinks it’s not enough to represent us. ”

“Is that so?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Zhao Zhenghao nodded and said,”when I go back this time, I will also bring back the highlights of your game against bar?a edited by the Spanish coaching staff. In addition, the Spanish manager Ruby seems to have a lot of videos of your training. I will also bring these back. I believe Lippi’s evaluation of you will go up a lot!” He’ll definitely give you the green light!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei heaved a sigh of relief and said,”if that’s the case, there won’t be any problems.”

Since Xia ruofei was willing to fight for the country, he did not want to be disturbed by external factors. If the coaching staff did not coordinate well, it would easily cause various disturbances and affect the preparation of the national football team. Then, things would turn for the worse.

Xia ruofei was very satisfied with the Chinese Football Association’s all – out coordination.

Zhao Zhenghao said happily,”it seems like this trip was not in vain!” To be able to recruit a great player like Mr. Xia for the national football team, he might be recorded in the history of Chinese football!”

“That’s a little too much ...” Xia ruofei laughed.

In fact, the reality was that the national football team had become a second – rate team in Asia. Some of the former Southeast Asian teams had improved rapidly. The opponents that they could easily beat in the past had become a bit difficult to deal with. It was not impossible for them to draw or even lose, not to mention the traditional strong Asian teams such as Wei nation, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the Australian team that had joined the Asian Football Association. It was basically difficult for the Chinese national football team to win against these teams.

Therefore, the outside world evaluated that although the draw for the top 40 was good and the situation of the qualifying round was good, it was only limited to the top 40. After entering the second stage of the qualifiers, it was estimated that they would most likely be running with the team.

If the national football team could go against the trend and advance under such circumstances, it would obviously leave a heavy mark in the history of Chinese football. The fact that Zhao Zhenghao had come all the way to Spain to talk to Xia ruofei and successfully persuaded him to join the national football team would also be a good thing.

“Mr. Xia, do you have any requirements for the Jersey number?” Zhao Zhenghao asked with a smile. I think you’re more flexible in your position in the game and seem to be more suitable behind the striker. You’re also very suitable to be the midfield metronome. How about ... I leave the number 10 jersey for you?”

“Hasn’t Zheng Zhi always been the one wearing the number 10 jersey?” Xia ruofei frowned slightly and said,”it’s not good to take away someone’s favorite. Besides, I’m not particular about the Jersey number. I think my number 25 Jersey for Espanyol is very good. If no one else is wearing the number 25 of the national football team, just leave it to me!”

“This ...” Zhao Zhenghao hesitated.

Number 25 was not a popular number. If Xia ruofei wanted this number, Zhao Zhenghao would be more than willing. Although he said it easily, it was not easy to give Zheng Zhi’s number 10 jersey to Xia ruofei. Zheng Zhi’s position in the Chinese football world was also very important. He had been the captain of the national football team for so many years. Although he was already 38 years old, he was still an indispensable figure in the defensive midfielder position of the National Football.

At the end of Zheng Zhi’s career, in the last World Cup qualifier, he was stripped of his number 10 jersey and given to a player who had never been on the national team before. Even if he could get through Zheng Zhi’s work, he would not be able to stand the criticism from the fans!

However, Zhao Zhenghao did not know if Xia ruofei really meant what he said. If Xia ruofei was just being polite, he would actually want a number 9 or 10, which symbolized the main force and core. However, Zhao Zhenghao went with the flow and gave him the number 25. The good impression that he had left would be ruined.

To be honest, Zhao Zhenghao didn’t even care about whether the national football team could pass the qualifiers or Xia ruofei’s feelings. Any leader who called him could decide his future. He naturally had to make friends with someone like Xia ruofei. This matter was even more important than the National Football competition.

This was the real reason why Zhao Zhenghao hesitated.

“Vice President Zhao, you don’t think I’m lying, do you?” Xia ruofei smiled.

“No, no, no!” Zhao Zhenghao quickly said,”why would I?”

“The matter of the Jersey number is settled!” Xia ruofei said,”Vice – President Zhao, you’ll understand once you get to know more about the Spanish team. I really don’t care much about the number.”
