Chapter 1698: The power of the best oak (1)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei quickly replied,”no!” He had already reserved all of his oak for this year and they were all going to be exported. These two were the only ones left! The Rest Haven’t reached the standard for cutting down trees!”

Although there were many oak trees in the interspace, Xia ruofei still needed to save some to cultivate truffles. Moreover, the two wineries had a huge demand for oak barrels. Even if all the oak trees in the interspace were cut down, it would definitely not be enough. Hence, Xia ruofei naturally wanted to stop Old West from changing the oak barrels.

Old West was very disappointed. He asked,””Is there really not a single one left?”

“Not a single one left!” Xia ruofei said firmly.

“Why don’t you go and ask again?” Old West said expectantly,”Xia, the quality of our grapes is very high. I’ve always hoped to use new oak barrels because new barrels have a much greater impact on the taste of wine than old barrels. If we can use this quality oak to make oak barrels, the quality of our Semillon grapes will definitely go up another level!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Uncle Wester, there’s really no more. I’ve already asked my friend.”

“I see ...” Old West couldn’t hide his disappointment.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”uncle Wester, what do you think?” No matter how many barrels these two logs can be made into, I only want two of them and leave the rest for the winery. We can use the Old and New wooden barrels at the same time, and then we can compare them and have an intuitive result!”

Xia ruofei paused before continuing,”also, I’ll ask my friend to reserve a batch of oak for us next year to guarantee the needs of the two wineries!” You can calculate the number needed, and I’ll ask my friend to reserve it in advance. How about it?”

“That’s the only way,”Old West said. Xia, you should contact your friend now! Next year, our winery will reserve at least 800 barrels of wood!”

” 800 ...” Xia ruofei asked in surprise.”Do we really need that many?”

“It can be used!” Old West said,”the Golden Oak winery is the largest winery in the Hunter Valley area. The size of the West Winery is not small either. 800 wooden barrels are just enough for the two wineries!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”no problem!” I’ll make a reservation with my friend immediately!”

Then, Xia ruofei asked again,”uncle Wester, how long does it take to make a wooden bucket?” Will we be able to catch up with this batch of wine?”

“It’s just a few,” Old West said.”I’ll ask old Carl to stop his work for a while. A week should be enough! The main thing is that the new wooden barrels need to be baked. This process is crucial to the quality of the wooden barrels, and it takes a lot of time. One week should be the fastest!”

“The grapes at the Golden Oak winery ripen a few days later,” Old West said.”We should be able to make it in a week. But ... Xia! I still don’t understand why you want unfermented grape juice. The fermentation process has very strict requirements on the environment and temperature. After you take them away, it’s very likely that the two barrels of grape juice will become sour and smelly wastewater ...”

Xia ruofei laughed,”uncle Wester, you don’t have to worry about this!” Anyway, I only want two buckets ... Alright, you should go back and rest! He still had to wake up early tomorrow to pick grapes! I’m going back to the farm too!”

“Alright then!” Old West said,”I’ll ask old Carl to come over tomorrow morning. He’s the best bucket – jingling craftsman in the Hunter Valley area!”

“Thanks! Uncle Wester!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

……

The next day, not long after Xia ruofei and Feng Rao arrived at the West Winery, a cool old man in a checkered shirt, riding boots, and a cowboy hat drove a pickup truck to the winery.

After he jumped out of the car, he shouted,”West!” West! Where is the superior oak you were talking about?”

Old West, who was busy, immediately put down his work and got up to welcome him. He laughed and said,””Karl! You came early enough! Come, come, come, let me introduce you to the new boss of West Winery, Xia ruofei from China!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Carl nodded at Xia ruofei perfunctorily and said,””West, take me to see the oak trees! If the quality is not good, I will not take it! I have a lot of orders on hand right now!”

He didn’t care who the owner of West Winery was. All he could think about was the top – Quality oak that Old West had praised on the phone last night. For a top – tier bucket – binding craftsman, top – Quality wood was far more attractive to him than a rich Chinese man.

Old West was a little embarrassed, but Xia ruofei didn’t mind. He smiled and said,””Uncle Wester, you should take Uncle Carl to see the wood first!”

Old West looked at Carl with dissatisfaction and said,””Follow me!”

He took Carl to an open space on the side of the winery building. The two logs of wood from last night had been unloaded here.

Xia ruofei and Feng Rao looked at each other and followed him.

As soon as Carl saw the two logs, he quickened his pace and squatted down to take a closer look. He was much more serious than Old West in his inspection. Not only did he carefully check the texture of the oak, but he also pinched a few different parts with his nails. He even dug out a small piece and put it in front of his nose to sniff.
