Chapter 1448: Happy and harmonious New Year (2)

Translator: 549690339

Ling’s private kitchen was not closed during the spring Festival, and business was even better. Many locals with good financial capabilities had booked New Year’s Eve dinner here. Due to the limited reception capacity, the New Year’s Eve dinner had been fully booked a month or two ago. Even the private rooms from the first to the sixth were basically fully booked.

Ling Xiaotian had informed his eldest disciple in advance and asked him to make a large jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ and send it to the jiangbin villa today.

The jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was very tightly sealed, and there was a layer of oil on the soup. With the addition of the thermal container, the heat would not dissipate. It did not even need to be heated again when it was eaten at night.

The three of them took the elevator to the 18th floor.

The door of Room 1801 was already half open. Lin Qiao heard the footsteps and conversation of Xia ruofei and the other two and immediately ran over to open the door. She smiled and said,””Brother ruofei! I’m here to help you carry your things ...”

After saying that, Lin Qiaoqiao pulled on her slippers and ran out.

Xia ruofei didn’t dare to hand the box over to the clumsy Lin Qiao. If the Chinese perch was scared to death, what would they eat tonight? If the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall were to break, it would be a waste of the delicacy!

He nimbly dodged Lin Qiao’s hand and said with a smile,””You little girl, why didn’t you greet the guests?”

Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue and looked at Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue in embarrassment. She said,”Uncle Ling, sister – in – Law, Happy New Year!”

Ling Qingxue was embarrassed to be called “sister – in – Law” by Lin Qiao in front of Ling Xiaotian. She blushed and said,””Happy New Year, Qiao’ er!”

On the other hand, Ling Xiaotian was very happy. He put the things in his hand at the door with a smile and skillfully took out a red packet from his inner pocket and handed it to Lin Qiao.

“You must be ruofei’s sister, Lin Qiao!” Ling Xiaotian said. What a pretty little girl!”

“Uncle Ling, I can’t accept this!” Lin Qiao quickly waved her hand.

“It’s the new year. Why can’t I accept red packets from the elders?” Ling Xiaotian passed the red packet to Lin Qiao again and said,”quickly accept it! Quickly accept it!”

Lin Qiao saw the bulging red packet and knew that there must be a lot of money in it. She looked at Xia ruofei hesitantly.

Xia ruofei could tell that if the red packet contained brand new Chinese yuan, it would be at least 10000 Yuan.

However, this amount of money was nothing to him and Ling Xiaotian. The New Year’s celebration was the only thing they wanted.

Hence, Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Qiao’ er, since it’s from uncle Ling, you should accept it!”

Lin Qiao took the heavy red packet and said with a smile,””Thank you, uncle Ling!”

“That’s the way!” Ling Xiaotian said with a happy smile.

“Let’s enter the house!” Xia ruofei said.

Lin Qiao actively helped Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue carry their things, and the group of people walked into the house.

Hu ‘Zi’s mother had also heard the commotion outside, but she was busy in the kitchen, so she did not come out to welcome him.

When Xia ruofei and the others entered the house, Hu Zi’s mother was carrying a bowl of soup out. She placed the soup on the dining table and wiped her hands on her apron. She smiled and greeted,””Everyone’s here! Come and eat!”

The moment Ling Xiaotian entered, he used his trademark loud voice to greet him with a smile,””Happy New Year, sister – in – Law!”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother also smiled and said,””Happy New Year! Should I ask my in – laws?”

After she finished speaking, Hu zimu looked at Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue with a smile, making the two of them feel a little uncomfortable.

Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment before he laughed and said,””Hey! I was wrong! It’s time to call them in – laws!”

Ling Qingxue’s face was red with embarrassment. She could only hide her embarrassment by tidying up the things she had brought.

Lin Qiao laughed and joked,””Sister – in – Law, we’re family, there’s no need to be embarrassed ...”

“You’re such a talkative girl, why aren’t you getting the bowls and chopsticks?” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“I know!” Lin Qiao stuck out her tongue and ran to the kitchen.

No one noticed that there was a faint sense of loss in the depths of her eyes, but she concealed it very well.

“By the way, in – Law, Qingxue brought you a coat when she went to Hong Kong for business.” Ling Xiaotian said,”Qingxue, quickly take it out and let your in – Law try it on.”

“I have enough clothes to wear. You don’t have to buy me anything.” Hu Zi’s mother said.

“It’s a child’s filial piety!” Ling Xiaotian said with a smile.

Ling Qingxue suppressed her shyness and took out the cashmere coat from the bag of clothes in the pile.

It was a light gray coat. The cutting and materials were very exquisite, and it was obviously expensive.

Even though Hu Zi’s mother rejected it, she was still very happy that Xia ruofei’s future wife had bought it for her. She took the clothes with a smile, thanked Ling Qingxue, and went back to her room to change.

After a while, Hu ‘Zi’s mother came out wearing a cashmere coat.

It had to be said that Ling Qingxue’s taste was quite good. When Hu Zi’s mother put on the coat, she seemed to have become a few years younger.

At the same time, the color of the coat was not bright, and it was very suitable for people of Hu Zi’s mother’s age.

What was especially rare was that Ling Qingxue had only asked Xia ruofei about Hu Zi’s mother’s general figure and the clothes she had bought fit her very well, as if they were tailor – made.

“It’s good!” Xia ruofei nodded and praised.

Lin Qiao put down her bowl and chopsticks and ran over to join in the fun. She shouted exaggeratedly,”Sister – in – Law is so good at buying things! Mom looks like a completely different person in this dress. If we walk on the street together, people will think that we’re sisters!”

Hu ‘Zi’s mother knocked Lin Qiao’s head and said,””Nonsense, I’m already seventy or eighty years old, how could I be as exaggerated as you said?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Godma is still very young!” You’re the one who’s exaggerating, what seventy or eighty!”

“Yup! Most importantly, he looks very good!” Ling Xiaotian agreed.

“He looks like he’s in his forties or fifties at most!” Ling Qingxue added.

Hu Zi’s mother had been in a good mood for the past two years. In addition, Xia ruofei would help her recuperate from time to time, so she was in good spirits and even looked younger than people of her age.

“I’ll go change out of my clothes!” Hu ‘Zi’s mother was a little embarrassed by everyone’s words.

“No need to change! Just wear this!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you should wear new clothes for the new year!”

Everyone echoed Xia ruofei’s words. Lin Qiao even actively found a pair of scissors and helped Hu Zi’s mother cut off the logo on the clothes.

Hu Zi’s mother had no choice but to call everyone over for lunch.

The main focus of the new year was the New Year’s Eve dinner. However, considering that it was Ling Xiaotian and Ling Qingxue’s first time visiting the house as guests, Hu Zi’s mother had prepared a sumptuous lunch. There was fish and meat, and the entire table was filled.

Everyone had a happy lunch and was about to start preparing for the New Year’s Eve dinner. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ling Qingxue, as her future daughter – in – Law, naturally had to take the initiative to help out in the kitchen.

Even Ling Xiaotian had rolled up his sleeves and was eager to try his hand in the kitchen. He was a head chef, so he had to show off his skills for the New Year’s Eve dinner.

In addition, Lin Qiao also came to join in the fun. As a result, the originally spacious kitchen became a little crowded.

Hu Zi’s mother could only start to chase people out. In the end, the ladies stayed in the kitchen while Ling Xiaotian and Xia ruofei were pushed out.

Of course, Hu ‘Zi’s mother had also agreed to leave a dish for Ling Xiaotian to show off his cooking skills.

As for now, he would let the father and son make tea and play chess in the living room. If they really wanted to walk around, they might as well tour the house.

Listening to the laughter coming from the kitchen from time to time, Xia ruofei and Ling Xiaotian could only make tea and chat in boredom.

After sitting for a while, Xia ruofei saw that the couplets had not been pasted on the TV cabinet. He took out the thick rice soup that Hu Zi’s mother had prepared in advance and went to the door to paste the couplets with Ling Xiaotian.

In the countryside, rice soup was used to paste the Spring Festival couplets. The rice soup was very sticky and would not fall off even after a year.

After using a brush to brush the rice soup on the corresponding position on the wall, Xia ruofei divided the couplets into top and bottom. Then, he took the Spring Festival couplets and started to paste them on the wall.

And Ling Xiaotian would be commanding from behind to ensure that they would not get stuck off course.

After the two of them worked together, they quickly put up the couplets.

Xia ruofei also stuck the word “fortune” on the door. This kind of metal anti – Theft door could not be made with rice soup, so he could only settle for the second – best option and use transparent glue.

Then, Xia ruofei showed Ling Xiaotian around the house. The two of them smoked on the balcony for a while when they heard Lin Qiao calling out from inside the house,””Brother ruofei! Uncle Ling, come and make a swallow with us!”
