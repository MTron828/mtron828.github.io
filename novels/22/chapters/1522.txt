Chapter 1523: Hard to resist_2

Translator: 549690339

Xia Qing also felt very strange. Where did her master hear about this kind of messy contract? Moreover, spirit beasts that could recognize a master were the most important companions of cultivators. How could the master bear to ...

Xia ruofei was a little disappointed. He laughed dryly.”It seems like the rumors were wrong ...”

He thought to himself, it’s all those cultivation novels ‘fault ...

Then, Xia ruofei glanced at the realm Fox with a strange look and asked with his spiritual will,””Since there’s no chance of master recognition, I’m afraid there’s the danger of leaking the secret if we let it go. Should we ...”

Xia ruofei and Xia Qing had been communicating with their divine thoughts and did not speak. However, during this period, they had looked at the White realm Fox several times with malicious eyes. This made the White realm Fox reveal a trace of vigilance and intentionally or unintentionally increased the distance between Xia ruofei and it.

Xia Qing, who was in the spirit map space, quickly said,””I can not! No! Master, the realm Fox is a rare beast, and it is extremely sensitive to the realm stone. It will definitely be of great help to master!”

Xia ruofei was a little depressed.”This won’t do. That won’t do. What should we do?”

Xia ruofei did not expect this little guy to become a hot potato.

Xia Qing muttered to herself for a moment before she said,””Master, actually ... It’s not convenient for you to keep this world Fox by your side. You can put it in the spirit map world ...”

Before Xia Qing could finish her sentence, Xia ruofei shouted,””No!”

In a moment of desperation, he did not use his divine telekinesis to transmit his voice. Instead, he said it out loud. This also gave the White realmfox a shock and it subconsciously took a few steps to the side.

Xia ruofei calmed himself down and continued to use his spiritual sense to say,””Didn’t you say that this little guy’s spatial talent is extremely strong? Put it in the space, what if he causes damage inside?”

Xia Qing smiled and said,”master, you’re underestimating the spirit map world.” Although the realm Fox is the darling of space, the space of the spirit map world is ... Personally constructed by that person. Not to mention that this realm Fox is still young, even if it had evolved into an adult, it would not be able to destroy the stability of space!”

Xia Qing paused for a moment before she continued.”Furthermore, master’s current level of spiritual power cultivation is enough to control the spirit map world to a high degree. As long as the realm Fox is in the spirit map world, master can control it with a single thought. What is there to worry about?”

“Really?” Xia ruofei asked. Then, he noticed a key piece of information in Xia Qing’s words and immediately asked,”who is the ‘person’ that constructed the spirit map world that you mentioned?”

“Master, this ... You’ll naturally find out in the future. I’m sorry I can’t reveal it now ...” Xia Qing said after a moment of hesitation.

“It’s that damn rule again?” Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.

“Please forgive me, Master ...” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”it’s not your fault!” Xia Qing, you can continue ...”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said,”the realm Fox should be unable to resist the temptation of the spirit map world. The spatial structure of the spirit map world is brand new, and there is also a time array. It will definitely be willing to enter. In addition, even in the spirit map world, it doesn’t stop the realm Fox from finding the world stone. If a world stone appears within its ability, it will still sense it in the spirit map world. ”

Xia ruofei pondered for a while and said,””So you’re saying that there are only benefits and no harm?”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I understand ...”

After he finished speaking, Xia ruofei turned to look at the realm Fox, his eyes becoming much gentler.

The white fox was even more alert now. It meowed at Xia ruofei as it retreated and waved its forelimbs threateningly.

However, looking at its posture, it was clear that this little fellow was also acting tough on the outside but was actually a coward on the inside. It was simply prepared to quickly escape into the forest once something went wrong.

Although the true energy emitted by this young man was very attractive to it, and there was also that mysterious spatial aura, how could all of this be more important than its life?

Xia ruofei smiled gently at the realm Fox and said in a seductive tone,””Little guy, are you curious about the spatial fluctuations on my body?”

The White realmfox was stunned and looked at Xia ruofei in confusion.

Xia ruofei smiled and summoned the spirit painting from his palm. He had already checked the surroundings before and there was not a single shadow around. He did not have to worry about anyone spying on him.

When the scroll appeared in Xia ruofei’s hand, the realm Fox’s eyes suddenly narrowed. Its pouty little mouth opened involuntarily, staring at the scroll and unable to look away.

As a natural – born pet of space, the realm Fox sensed the strange fluctuation hidden in this seemingly ordinary scroll almost immediately. It was different from any fluctuation it had previously grasped, but it was certain that it was a kind of spatial fluctuation.

Xia ruofei saw the look on the Jie Li’s face and acted like a weird uncle who was trying to deceive a kindergartener. He struck while the iron was hot,””Do you want to take a look inside? The space here is very different from the outside world! And I can even allow you to live there, who asked us to be fated ...”

Hearing this, the realm Fox immediately nodded its head like a little chick pecking at rice. As Xia Qing had said, the temptation of the new spatial fluctuation was something it could not resist. It did not even consider its own safety.

Of course, it could also be that the realm Fox was very confident in its attainments in space.

Xia ruofei’s “evil plan” had succeeded. He did not care what the realm Fox was thinking! With a gentle smile on his face, he said,””Then I’ll let you in. Remember, don’t resist ...” He said.

The realm Fox nodded repeatedly.

Hence, with a thought from Xia ruofei, the realm Fox completely relaxed its resistance. Xia ruofei easily moved it into the spirit map space.

The spirit map space was at the primal realm.

As soon as the realm Fox appeared, it immediately revealed a look of great joy.

The spirit Qi here was extremely dense, to the point that it had already formed a mist in the sky. Even if it didn’t rely on absorbing spirit Qi and instead relied on eating world stones to grow, living in such an environment was still more comfortable than living in the outside world where the spirit Qi was barren.

In addition, the spatial fluctuations here were extremely profound. They were different from all the spatial laws it had come into contact with, but they were extremely stable.

At the same time, the realm Fox also keenly sensed that the flow of time here was different from the outside world.

This was undoubtedly the best place for the realm Fox who was obsessed with the rules of space.

So as soon as it entered, it closed its eyes impatiently and quietly comprehended the rules of this space.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s voice rang in the air.””Oh, I almost forgot about the flow of time. Little guy, this place is not suitable for you. I’ll find you another place!”

As soon as Xia ruofei finished speaking, the realm Fox felt an irresistible pulling force. It was involuntarily pulled into an invisible space vortex. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If the realm Fox had resisted in the outside world, Xia ruofei would not have been able to keep it in the space. But now that it was in the spirit map’s space, Xia ruofei was the only master of this space. Naturally, it would be easy.

In the next moment, the realm Fox found itself transported to another independent space.

The boundary Fox protested and waved its forelimbs at the sky. However, it did not receive any response, so it could only give up gloomily.

Of course, the most important thing was that the laws of space here were basically the same as the space just now. The only difference was that there was no time formation.

To the realm Fox, just the comprehension of the spatial laws alone was already unfathomable. It did not matter whether it had a time formation or not.

As for Xia ruofei, he was mainly concerned about how fast time passed at the Archean realm. He did not know how long a realm Fox’s lifespan was. If he died after staying for a few days, it would not be worth it.

Even if the realm Fox had a long life, Xia ruofei did not want it to use the time formation to improve rapidly before he could truly establish a close working relationship with it.

Although Xia Qing had said that with the realm Fox’s strength, even if it evolved into an adult, it wouldn’t be able to cause any waves in the space, it was better to avoid unnecessary trouble. When it came to the core benefits of the spirit map space, Xia ruofei had to do his best to ensure that nothing went wrong.

The realm Fox protested symbolically for a moment before it started to comprehend the rules that had been set up in the spirit map space.
