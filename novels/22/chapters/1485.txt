Chapter 1486: Successful unlock (2)

Translator: 549690339

However, the lines did not seem to be very harmonious. There seemed to be some details that were not perfect. Sometimes, Xia ruofei would only draw one or two strokes before dispersing them. Then, he would try again with a heart as deep as an ancient well.

By the second hour, Xia ruofei’s pattern was getting more and more complicated. Although it was still not systematic, the intertwining and complicated golden patterns showed that he was making rapid progress.

On the third hour, Xia ruofei had drawn a complete rune for the first time. However, he was not satisfied. He wiped it away after one look and continued to draw the next one.

On the fourth hour, Xia ruofei’s drawing speed became faster and faster, and he succeeded more and more. Of course, the runes he drew were not nearly perfect. At least, Xia ruofei was not satisfied with them.

By the fifth hour, the runes that Xia ruofei had drawn seemed to have a spirit to them. As his proficiency increased, the process of drawing became easier. With a slight tremble of his fingertips, a few mysterious lines would appear in front of him.

With the experience of unlocking the human jade talisman, Xia ruofei was able to learn the unlocking runes of the earth jade talisman very quickly.

Very quickly, the fifth hour had passed. Xia ruofei had a feeling. He kept the earth jade talisman and stood up.

“Master!” Xia Qing looked over.

Xia ruofei smiled bitterly.”It seems like it’ll be difficult to unlock it in a short period of time. I’ll have to go out now.”

In fact, Xia ruofei could have easily drawn this complicated rune, but he still felt that it was not as perfect as when he unlocked the human – shaped jade talisman.

He knew that this was because he had not practiced enough, and his proficiency still needed to be improved.

When the human – shaped jade talisman was unlocked, a huge amount of information had almost stuffed Xia ruofei’s brain to the point of bursting. This was under the condition that he had made ample preparations. If he had lowered the quality of the unlocking talisman and his spiritual power control had not met the inheritance’s requirements, he would have ended up in a very miserable state.

Therefore, even though Xia ruofei was very anxious, he did not dare to take any chances. He had to make the unlocking rune that he had carved infinitely close to perfection before he could accept the inheritance information in the earth jade talisman.

“Master’s speed is already beyond imagination,” said Xia Qing with a smile.”I believe that you’ll be able to successfully obtain the inheritance of the earth character jade talisman very soon.”

Xia ruofei nodded.”Looks like I’ll have to find another time to come in. This earth jade talisman has to be unlocked!”

He had already made up his mind. He would tell Song Wei that he was tired from the journey and would not go out to check out the place. He would rest in the hotel and wait until tomorrow.

An entire night should be enough for Xia ruofei to stay in the Archean realm for more than ten days.

Xia ruofei returned to the outside world and quickly kept the painting in his palm.

Then, he took off his clothes and went to the bathroom to take a shower as fast as he could. After changing into a clean set of clothes, he opened the door and walked out.

Song Wei was watching TV on the sofa. When she saw Xia ruofei, she smiled and said,”Ruofei, I’ve drawn all the parts I can remember. Take a look!”

“You’ve worked hard, you’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

He walked over and picked up the draft on the coffee table. At this time, Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei and asked,””Why do you look so pale? Do you feel uncomfortable?”

In fact, Xia ruofei had consumed too much energy when he broke the barrier. He had started to draw the unlocking runes before he had fully recovered. It had consumed a lot of spiritual energy, so he looked a little dispirited.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I’m fine. Maybe I didn’t rest well.” Plus, I’ve been driving for an hour or two, so I’m a little tired. ”

“Then hurry back to your room and rest!” Song Wei said,”have a good sleep in the afternoon. Let’s not go out at night. We’ll discuss how to enter the tomb together. We’ll talk about other things tomorrow!”

Xia ruofei had been waiting for Song Wei to say this!

He thought for a while and said,”that’s fine. Since we’re already here, a day or two won’t matter!”

“Mm! You should go and sleep!” Song Wei said,”your face is frighteningly pale now ...”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll take this sketch in and have a look ...”

Before Xia ruofei could finish his sentence, Song Wei snatched the sketch away and folded it carefully before putting it into her pocket.

She reproached,”I told you to rest and adjust your condition first!” Your task in the afternoon is to have a good sleep and recover your energy!”

“Alright! You don’t have to watch TV anymore, let’s go back to our room and sleep for a while!” Xia ruofei said.

After that, Xia ruofei returned to his bedroom.

After quickly locking the door, Xia ruofei summoned the spirit painting again and returned to the medium.

Now that he had more time, he didn’t immediately continue to practice the complicated rune. Instead, he sat down on the recliner by the spirit pool, waved his hand, and took a bottle of spirit Heart Flower petal solution, and gulped it down. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Xia Qing and said,””I’ll sleep for an hour. If I don’t wake up, wake me up. In addition, pay attention to the situation outside at all times. Wake me up immediately if there’s any sign of trouble!”

“Yes, master!” Xia Qing said.

Xia ruofei closed his eyes. His entire body was bathed in the fog – like spiritual Qi. He felt as if he was floating in the air. In addition, his mental energy was almost exhausted and he was indeed very tired. Hence, he quickly fell into a deep sleep.

An hour later, Xia Qing woke Xia ruofei up on time.

Xia ruofei stretched lazily and took a deep breath while facing the clear spiritual pond. He felt relaxed and happy.

After an hour of rest, he had been fully revived and was in a very good state.

Xia ruofei took a small basin of spiritual pond water and washed his face. Then, he took advantage of the fact that he was in a good state and immediately started to study the unlocking of the runes.

As time went by, Xia ruofei’s speed of drawing the runes became faster and faster. His success rate also increased and the quality of the runes also increased rapidly.

After an unknown period of time, Xia ruofei’s fingertips trembled in the air. Mysterious runes gushed out and formed an extremely complicated pattern in the air. The pattern was shimmering with a faint golden light.

After Xia ruofei took a glance, his face revealed a trace of joy.

“This one is almost done ...” He muttered to himself.

Xia ruofei casually wiped the rune away and immediately drew it again.

The third time, the fourth time...Xia ruofei drew it again and again, and erased it.

He found that his current rune drawing state was basically stable. The runes produced each time were basically above the standard, and he was quite satisfied with it.

Xia ruofei was not in a hurry to unlock the earth jade talisman.

He knew that once the Jade talisman was removed, the inheritance would begin immediately, so he had to adjust his state, especially his mental power, to its strongest state, so that he could resist the impact of the transmission process.

Therefore, he drank another bottle of the spirit Heart Flower petal solution. Today, he wasn’t stingy at all. He had used several bottles of the precious spirit Heart Flower petal solution.

Xia ruofei rested by the spiritual pond for a while. After adjusting himself to his best condition, he finally took out the earth jade talisman.

Xia Qing, who was at the side, also revealed a trace of nervousness.

Xia ruofei calmly drew a complete unlocking rune. It was still close to perfect quality.

With a slight thought, the unlocking rune immediately floated toward the earth jade talisman and embedded itself into the lines on the Jade talisman.

These patterns immediately emitted a faint golden light. The light was like flowing water, flowing along the patterns on the Jade talisman. Soon, the entire talisman was lit up.

There was a dazzling light. The next moment, Xia ruofei felt a familiar impact. A huge amount of information rushed into his mind like a tide ...
