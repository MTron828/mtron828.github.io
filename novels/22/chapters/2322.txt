2323 Handling the captives (2)

Qian guiyou and the other four were inside the cage. They had been trapped there for two hours, but they were still in a daze.

Just a moment ago, they were still in the rented house in the old community. They only felt dazed for a moment, and then the scenery in front of them changed completely. They found themselves in a place with green grass and extremely fresh air.

This kind of experience, which was like the stars shifting, was absolutely subversive for them.

What made their hearts tremble even more was that they were actually suspended in the air in a small space cage that only bound them in a very small area, but it did not hinder their vision.

Qian guiyou and the others found that they didn’t fall down, but were suspended in the air.

After fumbling around, they realized that although there was no shelter in the surroundings, their range of activity was only a few meters. Any further and it was as if they had hit an invisible wall, and they could not get out no matter how hard they tried.

The few of them looked at each other as if they had seen ghosts.

In this one hour, they had discussed for a long time and tried many ways, but they were unable to escape.

Qian guiyou and the others knew that this must have been the work of the demon – like young man. In their eyes, Xia ruofei’s actions were undoubtedly demonic. He could freeze people with a few needles, make them lose their freedom with just a look, and answer whatever they were asked. All of this was too unbelievable.

In the end, they couldn’t help but have a terrible thought.”Is the young man trying to trap us in this strange place and starve us to death?”

Qian guiyou and the others shuddered at the thought.

At this moment, they suddenly felt their bodies sink.

Although there was nothing under their feet, they felt like they were standing on solid ground. However, that feeling had disappeared. They began to free – Fall, falling straight down from a height of more than ten meters.

Qian guiyou and the others screamed instinctively.

The green grass quickly grew larger in their field of vision. Although there was grass below, falling from a height of more than ten meters, even if they were lucky enough to survive, they would probably break their bones.

Just as their faces were about to touch the grass, they suddenly felt a gentle force holding them up, and then they slowly landed on the ground.

Qian guiyou and the others gasped for breath as if they had just survived a disaster.

At this moment, a voice rang out,””Everyone, welcome to the spirit map space! How did it feel to ride the free drop machine just now?”

Qian guiyou raised his head and saw Xia ruofei’s face. He cried out in surprise, “It’s you! You’re Xia ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’ve done your homework. That’s right. I’m Xia ruofei. At the same time, I’m also ...”

As he spoke, he changed his appearance.

Qian guiyou and the other four witnessed another strange scene. Under their watchful eyes, the muscles and bones on Xia ruofei’s face began to change. In a short while, he seemed to have turned into another person.

Qian guiyou and the others would never forget that he was the young man who had captured them in the room an hour ago, even if he turned into ashes.

“You ... You ...” Qian guiyou stammered in shock.

After witnessing Xia ruofei’s magical ability, he immediately realized something and couldn’t help but shout,””You were the one who killed Qian GUI douyou, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled and changed his appearance again. Soon, he looked like the person that Qian GUI douyou’s glasses had captured.

“As expected ...” Qian guiyou said with a slight tremble.

He knew that he had no hope of avenging his brother in this life.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I have to correct you. Your brother bit the poison capsule and died. I didn’t want to kill him.” For example, you all. Although you all deserve to die, aren’t you all still alive and well? If he hadn’t foolishly chosen to commit suicide, he would be in the same situation as you. ”

No. 4 was a Chinese, his name was Bao Guijun. He couldn’t help but ask,””Mr. Xia, what is this place? How did we end up here in the blink of an eye? you ... How did you do it?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you don’t need to know this.” You only need to remember one thing, and that is ... The five of you are now my captives!”

Bao Guijun couldn’t help but show a bitter smile. He could already predict his fate.

Xia ruofei looked down at the five of them and said,””I don’t like to force people to do things they don’t want to do. So, although you’re prisoners, I’ve decided to give you a chance to choose.”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused and glanced at the five people’s faces. Then, he said,””I’ll give you two choices. First, you can choose to die for your organization like qangui douyou, and I will not stop you. If you don’t want to commit suicide, I have another option, and that is to work for me. You can exchange your contribution for survival supplies to ensure that you can continue to live. ”

“Mr. Xia, if we work for you, you probably won’t be able to rest assured ...” Bao Guijun asked carefully.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”since I’m willing to let you live, I’m not worried about you betraying me.” How about this! I can give you a chance to escape. As long as you can get out of my territory, I can let you go. ”

Qian guiyou raised his head and asked,””Is this true?”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”Your lives are in my hands. Why Would I Lie to You?” he asked. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Then, Xia ruofei looked at Bao Guijun and asked,””How is it? Do you want to try your luck?”

Bao Guijun exchanged a look with his partner and said,”Since Mr. Xia is so generous, we’ll thank you first. May I ask ... How do I play this game?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”There are no rules and no time limit. From now on, you can run. If you can run, you will be free!”

“It’s a deal!” Bao Guijun gritted his teeth and said.

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””It’s a deal!”

Bao Guijun and the others discussed in a low voice. Xia ruofei didn’t go over to join in the fun. He walked to the side and sat on the ground with a playful smile on his face.

Bao Guijun and the others came to a conclusion very quickly.

They had been trapped in a spatial cage that was more than ten meters high and had used the high ground to observe the surrounding situation, so they quickly agreed to run in the direction of the sea.

They felt that even if Xia ruofei had set up an iron bucket formation around this area, the sea was so vast that it would not be easy for Xia ruofei to catch them as long as they escaped into the sea.

They even saw a small yacht floating on the sea near land.

If they could get their hands on the yacht, the chances of them successfully escaping would be higher.

Thus, they exchanged a look and quickly rushed in the direction of the sea.

Bao Guijun didn’t forget to look at Jian Jia. He felt that Xia ruofei was like a cat toying with a mouse. He was afraid that Xia ruofei was playing with them. Once they started to run, hundreds of people would rush out and surround them.

Bao Guijun saw that Xia ruofei didn’t even bat an eye and didn’t look like there was anyone lying in ambush. He made up his mind and followed Qian guiyou and the others to the seaside.

The journey was unusually smooth. There were no obstacles at all. Xia ruofei even stayed in the same place and did not move. They rushed to the seaside just like that.

From afar, the small yacht was still bobbing up and down on the sea.

“Everyone, let’s work harder!” Qian guiyou shouted. We’ll be free once we get out!”
