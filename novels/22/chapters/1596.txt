Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei flipped through the list. It was very detailed. There were many parts that could be chosen freely, including the overall color scheme of the yacht, the interior materials, and many other electronic devices. There was a lot of stuff.

Liao Bo took out a list and confirmed it with Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei chose the more technological silver as the main color tone and the best interior design. At the same time, he added facilities like a Jacuzzi that the standard version did not have. Naturally, he also had the best electronic equipment.

It was the first time Liao Bo had met such a straightforward customer. In a short while, the entire configuration form was filled in.

Liao Bo took the list to the service desk and began to calculate the price according to the configuration table.

After double – checking, Liao Bo walked over to Xia ruofei and said,””Mr. Xia, because you’ve added a lot of optional functions, the final price is 3.86 million Yuan. According to the preferential policy of our yacht exhibition this time, I specifically applied for the biggest discount within the manager’s authority, and the final price can be 3.7 million Yuan! In addition, we’ll give you a two – year membership fee – Free for the Yacht Club, as well as a seven – day stay ticket for the Four Seasons Hotel!”

Liao Bo then looked at Xia ruofei with a fervent gaze.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure. 50% down payment, right?” Where can i swipe my card?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Liao Bo quickly said,”Mr. Xia, this is the order contract. The configuration list that we have just confirmed is also attached. Please take a look and sign it if there are no problems!” Let’s go to the service desk to pay after you sign. ”

Xia ruofei nodded. He took the order contract and quickly flipped through it. With his current brain’s computing speed and memory, even if he only took a cursory glance, it would be impossible for Liao Bo to escape his eyes if he really wanted to tamper with the configuration or the contract.

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said as he picked up the pen on the table and signed his name.

Liao Bo brought him to the front desk to pay 1.85 million Yuan with his card and made a receipt. At the same time, he also applied for a gold – stamped Yacht Club membership card for Xia ruofei.

Then, Liao Bo asked for Xia ruofei’s identity card and made a few copies. At the same time, he took out a letter of authorization for Xia ruofei to sign. This was to entrust their company to handle the import of this yacht.

After everything was done, Liao Bo shook hands with Xia ruofei enthusiastically and said,””Mr. Xia, thank you for choosing our azmu brand! If you have any problems with the delivery of the yacht, you can contact me by phone!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

At that moment, his phone vibrated. He put the purchase contract under his arm and waved goodbye to Liao Bo. He picked up the phone as he walked out of the exhibition hall.

“Hello, is this Mr. Xia?” A young voice asked.

“I’m Xia ruofei, Who are you?”

“Hello, Mr. Xia. We are the staff of pang Bo company!” The young voice said enthusiastically,”we’ve installed the motorboat you just ordered. May I know where you are now?” Can we set off now?”

“Oh, no problem!” Xia ruofei said,”I’m in Hall 9 now. Where are you guys?”

“Our car is at the West exit of the exhibition center.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”how about this?” I’m going to the parking lot to get my car now. You guys wait for a while, and we’ll meet at the West exit!”
