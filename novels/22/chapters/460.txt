Chapter 461: You get what you pay for (2)

The finance department was a very important and sensitive Department in the company. It was normal for the boss to appoint someone he trusted as the director, so Feng Jing wasn’t unhappy about it.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yes, I agree with all your other suggestions. However, if we don’t assign a Deputy General Manager, then we’ll hire an assistant general manager!” You can’t do some of the administrative work by yourself, can you?”

Feng Rao’s heart warmed slightly as she smiled.”Okay, thank you, Chairman.”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”CEO Feng, you’re in charge of the recruitment. I only have one suggestion. We don’t pursue prestigious schools or academic qualifications. Our company is willing to give a stage to young people with ability and let them grow with the company!”

“I agree!” Feng Jing agreed.”The Chairman’s idea is the same as mine!”

Xia ruofei smiled.”Also...Even though we’re going to move to the city and the office building, for now, the company will definitely be located on the farm. Due to the geographical location, some of the lower – Level positions may not be attractive. You have to take this into consideration.”

“I understand. That’s why my opinion is the same. We shouldn’t pursue talents with high academic qualifications from famous schools!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

Xia ruofei said,”what the company can do now is to provide apartments. Those who work in our company don’t have to travel back and forth. They can also save on rent. This should be attractive to young people.”

There were thirty to forty apartment buildings in the company, most of which were single apartments with one bedroom and one living room.

According to Feng Jing’s recruitment plan, even if all the new employees stayed on the farm, they would still be able to settle down.

“That’s great!” Feng Jing was also a little excited. She said,”Chairman, as for the specific salary and benefits ...”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”you’ll be fully in charge of this.” How about this, regarding the recruitment, you can just take out a proposal and let me have a look at it. ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Alright!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and added,”by the way, boss Feng. We need to set up an independent Department for our company’s security. I don’t plan to outsource the security work to a security company.”

“How about transferring it to the future Chief Executive Officer?” Feng Rao asked.

Xia ruofei shook his head.”This work is relatively independent. It’s directly managed by the General Manager and the chairman.” In addition, I’ll personally be in charge of the security Department and the recruitment of employees. ”

Xia ruofei had already reserved the position of head of the security Department for ye Lingyun. In the future, the company’s security guards would all be comrades – in – arms who had retired from the Army. Xia ruofei would definitely have to be independent in this job.

Otherwise, would he add an Executive Director above ye Lingyun’s head?

Feng Rao didn’t think much about it and nodded.”Alright,” he said.

Nowadays, many companies didn’t have full – time security departments. They all outsourced this work. The company’s security guards were actually sent by the security company, and some even took turns.

Feng Jing did not object to Xia ruofei’s decision to raise a team of security guards. This job was not the core of the company’s operations. If Xia ruofei wanted to be independent and work outside of the administrative work, it would not have much of an impact.

After they were done with the recruitment, Feng Jing flipped to another page and said,””Chairman, I think the second thing that’s also urgent is brand promotion.”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly, signaling for Feng Rao to continue.

Feng Jing said,”I looked through some of the company’s transaction records today and also searched for paradise vegetables on the internet. I found out that paradise vegetables ‘brand influence has not reached the level it should be. It’s still quite famous within Sanshan city through word of mouth. However, once it’s out of Sanshan city, its influence has plummeted.” Although Hengfeng group’s five – Star hotels had already launched paradise vegetables, this was not a public environment after all, and the influence was very limited. I think our product can be said to be a phenomenon. If we operate properly, it shouldn’t be as well – known as it is now. ”

Xia ruofei was a little embarrassed as he said,””This is my responsibility. To be honest, I’m not familiar with brand operations, and I don’t have any specialized plans. I’m just going to let nature take its course ... Director Feng, if you have any good ideas, please tell me!”

Feng Rao smiled at Xia ruofei and said,””Chairman, your advantage lies in your skills. You can leave the brand marketing to the professionals.”

Feng Jing cleared her throat and said,””Brand promotion will be the first important task after the company’s team is formed. There were many kinds of promotion plans, but the core was to hype up the game. “We can use some local media programs like ‘food gang’ to promote it. Of course, the San Shan local area is not the focus right now, but such work still needs to be done.”In addition, there are many well – known food official accounts and food Weibo’s influence that radiate to the whole country. There are also some food forums and food websites, which are the key areas of our work. Also, we need to expand the production as soon as possible. With the quality of Taoyuan vegetables, once we can distribute them all over the country, we won’t need to use too many marketing tactics and our brand’s popularity will soon go up. ”
