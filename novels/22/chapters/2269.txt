2270 Reaching a consensus (2)

“You just said that our Liu family and the song family both have great influence.” Old master Liu said,”right now, our two families are not convinced by each other. It’s relatively safe to fight with each other. Have you ever thought that if the Liu family and the song family really formed an alliance, the influence of this Alliance would be too terrifying? He might even be above the country! Do you think that such an Alliance can survive?”

At this point, old master Liu revealed a meaningful smile and looked at Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei’s heart trembled when he heard this. Old master Liu’s words were on point. The reasons mentioned before were probably not the main reason. This was the only point that was truly critical.

Xia ruofei nodded silently. He had indeed agreed with elder Liu’s words. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

However, he did not know what to say. Before he came here, he had already thought about what he wanted. One of the most important things was to facilitate the Alliance between the Liu and song families. Now it seemed that this was really difficult to achieve. Or rather, he had thought of things too simply.

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei could not help but smile bitterly.

“Xiao Xia, I definitely can’t do what you’ve just said,” said Grandpa Liu. “If there’s no way to turn this around, then I can only lie here and wait for my death ...”

Old man Liu was dead set on his words. He would rather die than let his family be in extreme danger.

Forming an alliance with the song family was a huge gamble for the Liu family. Obviously, old master Liu was not willing to bet on his family because he already knew that there was a high chance that he would lose the bet if what Xia ruofei had said was true.

“If that’s the case, then just pretend I didn’t say anything!” Xia ruofei nodded.

Old man Liu nodded with a smile and said,””Little Xia, we definitely can’t form an alliance. The most I can promise you is that from now on, as long as the song family doesn’t provoke us, the Liu family won’t deliberately fight against the song family. In addition, house Liu will remain neutral in any conflict between house song and the other forces!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”sure!” Then it’s a deal!”

It was impossible to write a contract for this kind of thing, because it had no legal effect at all. Even if there was a contract, it would not have any binding effect. Hence, Xia ruofei could only choose to believe that old man Liu would not go back on his word.

Of course, more importantly, Xia ruofei had the means to counter – attack at any time, so he was not afraid of the Liu family going back on their words.

Old man Liu smiled and said,””Tell me your other conditions!”

Xia ruofei shrugged.”No, that’s all!” He said.

“No more?” “Is it really that simple?” elder Liu asked in surprise.

Xia ruofei spread his hands and said,”in fact, I didn’t take a single cent when I treated Grandpa song.” This is equivalent to paying more than a billion in consultation fees at once. Isn’t that high enough?”

If Xia ruofei didn’t want to avoid trouble, he might not even consider coming to see elder Liu and reject him directly. In his mind, elder Liu and elder song’s status were completely different, which was why he accepted a complete Pharmaceutical Group as the consultation fee.

Old man Liu laughed and said,””What’s a few billion? If it wasn’t for you, even if I were to throw out 10 billion or 100 billion, I wouldn’t be able to save my life! Old song was really lucky! You didn’t die from that kind of injury back then, and now I’m old enough to meet such a strange person like you ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”You’re overpraising me. I’m not an extraordinary person.”

Then, Xia ruofei stood up and said,””Alright then! Elder Liu, I’m very happy to have met you today, so I’ll take my leave first. I’ll come to treat you in a few days as promised. ”

Seeing that Xia ruofei was about to leave, old master Liu could not help but say,””Xia, can you ... Give me some medicine first? This illness was really painful! I feel like I’m being bitten by ants, and there’s not a single part of my internal organs that doesn’t hurt ...”

When he recalled that feeling, old man Liu couldn’t help but shiver. It was so painful that even a veteran like him who had survived through blood and fire on the battlefield couldn’t help but cry out in pain. He could only rely on painkillers to ensure that he had a certain amount of sleep.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”a few days shouldn’t be a problem!” “Besides, I’ll be in Beijing for the next few days. If your condition really worsens, you can just call me directly. I’ll be there as soon as possible ...”

Old master Liu knew that Xia ruofei would not make a move before he saw the real money. After all, the cooperation between the Liu family and Xia ruofei was more like a business deal. Since it was a business deal, there was no need to send the goods out before the money was paid.

Even so, he still couldn’t help but ask,””Then ... Then, can you do a few more of those muscle relaxing massage you just did? I feel much better after the massage ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”sure!” Just take it as a gift!”

With that, Xia ruofei smiled and walked in front of elder Liu. He reached out and accurately found a few acupuncture points. As he pressed them gently, he sent a small wisp of true Qi into them ...

A few minutes later, Xia ruofei pushed open the door of the ward and walked out. He nodded slightly at Fang Zhongming who was at the door.

Liu Qunfeng, who was sitting on a bench next to him, immediately stood up and walked over.

Xia ruofei smiled at Liu Qunfeng and said,””Chief Liu, I’ll take my leave now!”

Liu Qunfeng was stunned. He couldn’t tell what Xia ruofei and his father had talked about in the ward or if they had reached a consensus.

In this moment of shock, Xia ruofei had already turned to Fang Zhongming and walked towards the elevator.

“Xia ...” Liu Qunfeng subconsciously called out.

“The peaks!” “Come in for a moment!” Elder Liu’s voice came from the ward.

“Alright!” Liu Qunfeng quickly replied.

He looked at Xia ruofei’s back again, then walked into the ward with a stomach full of questions.

“Dad, did he agree to it?” Liu Qunfeng asked as soon as he entered the room.

Old man Liu didn’t give a direct answer. Instead, he said indifferently,””Go to that room first and see if the equipment they installed in the morning recorded anything.”

Even though Liu Qunfeng was full of doubts, he didn’t dare to ask his father. He could only nod helplessly and leave the ward.

After a while, Liu Qunfeng returned to the ward with a strange look on his face.

Old man Liu saw his son’s expression and had a guess. He asked indifferently,””Did you not record anything?”

Liu Qunfeng furrowed his brows and said,””It’s not that there’s nothing, it’s just that ... There’s no sound, and ... The images captured by the two cameras are very blurry, as if the light was distorted. I can’t even see the shape of your mouth in the images at all. That Xia brat’s back is facing the camera, so I can only see a blurry back ...”

In fact, this was the effect of the array. Xia ruofei did not deliberately take more precautions, but the recording device arranged by the Liu family was blind and deaf.

Actually, elder Liu had already expected this, so he only nodded slightly.

Liu Qunfeng mumbled to himself,”this is too strange ... I tested it a few times this morning, and it’s all fine!” And ... I’ve checked. Before that kid Xia came in, the sound and image were normal, but after he sat down here, the image became blurry. From the beginning to the end, there were some environmental sounds recorded, but there was no sound of the two of you talking. ”

Xia ruofei did not do anything to the recording device. He only set up a soundproof barrier around the small area where he and old man Liu were. Hence, the recording device could still record sounds like birds chirping outside the window, but it could not record their conversation.

Liu Qunfeng couldn’t understand it at all, unless Xia ruofei and elder Liu had sat there staring at each other for nearly half an hour without saying a word.

But this was too ridiculous! Even Liu Qunfeng found it unbelievable.

“Qunfeng, don’t worry about these small things ...” Old man Liu said indifferently.”Go and call all the core family members in the capital over. I have something to say!”
