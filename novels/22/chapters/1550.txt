Chapter 1551: Big profit, big profit (1)

Translator: 549690339

Everyone’s breathing became heavy. They all stared at the huge top – grade Violet Jade in the basin, their hearts burning.

These Jade merchants had been very active for a long time. As long as they had the slightest bit of strength, they hoped to buy this top – grade Jade.

The violet Jade was half the size of a washbasin, and the patterns of the flowers were very exquisite. If a master with good craftsmanship could carve it into a decoration, it could definitely be the treasure of a shop. The rest of the materials could be made into rings, pendants, and so on.

Everyone looked at Xia ruofei with a burning gaze.

“Little brother ...” Fatty Luo said, his face thick.

Without waiting for him to finish, Yu mingdong said first,””Mr. Xia, can you part with this piece of Jade? I’m willing to buy it at a high price!”

Fatty Luo wasn’t willing when he heard this. He said unhappily,””Old Yu, there’s always a first come, first served basis! I was the one who said it first!”

Yu mingdong pursed his lips and said,”President Luo, aren’t you certain that this is a piece of junk?” Now that you’ve cut out a top – grade Jade, why are you buying it?”

“Hehe! That was then and this was now!” Fatty Luo was a businessman, and his skin was thick enough.”This little brother looks like a person with great luck. You can’t say that he can only sell this Jade to you just because you know him, right?”

Fatty Luo’s words were acknowledged by quite a few people.

“That’s right, President Yu. Everyone wants good things!”

“Why don’t we all bid!”

Yu mingdong also knew that this kind of top – grade Jade was hard to come by. These people would not give up easily. It was impossible to buy it from Xia ruofei easily.

“Then let’s start the bidding!” He snorted coldly.

He Ping, who was at the side, had long been ignored by everyone. His face had become completely pale. Today was not as simple as losing face. This matter had happened in full view of everyone, so it was impossible to keep it a secret.

Their line of work had always been based on word of mouth. After this news spread, it could be said to be a devastating blow to He Ping’s reputation. After today’s misjudgment, who would still ask him to be a stone gambling consultant in the future?

He Ping was a little regretful at this time, feeling that he was really looking for trouble for nothing. Why was he competing with a young man? Now, he had shot himself in the foot.

These jade stone merchants did not have the time to care about He Ping’s feelings. They already could not wait to start bidding.

Fatty Luo was the first to be unable to hold back, saying,”Little brother, I’ll pay 35 million for this piece of Jade!”

As soon as fatty Luo finished speaking, someone snorted.”Old Luo, you’re bullying this little brother for not knowing the market! You’re only offering 35 million Yuan for such a large glass – Type jade, and it’s even the rare violet flower? Little brother, I’ll take the 40 million!”

” 42 million!”

” 45 million!”

Xia ruofei was dumbfounded as he didn’t expect the Jade to be so valuable.

He had spent 8.6 million Yuan to buy it. The valuable half of the Jade had already earned back 5 million Yuan. If this Violet Jade was sold at the current price, it would be worth more than 40 million Yuan.

It was equivalent to five times the profit!

“One blade to heaven, one blade to hell.” Xia ruofei had a more direct understanding of the excitement of stone gambling.

In the blink of an eye, the price had already reached 48 million.

Yu mingdong, who was at the side, didn’t make a bid. He was very clear about the actual value of this Jade.

In fact, not only him, but all the people present were experts in the Jade industry for many years. Everyone knew the value of this piece of Jade.

Between 50 million and 55 million, this was everyone’s common judgment. If it exceeded 55 million, the profit margin would be relatively small.

Of course, there was the possibility that some buyers would buy at a premium to expand their high – end product line, but these were the minority.

As a result, the number of people bidding gradually decreased after reaching this price, and the increase in the price was no longer as large.

When the price reached 50 million, Yu mingdong finally made up his mind.

He looked at Xia ruofei and said,”Mr. Xia, I bid 50 million for this piece of Jade ...”

When Yu mingdong said this, fatty Luo immediately interrupted him and said sarcastically,””President Yu, old Li has already offered 50 million. Why did you offer the same price? There should be a first come, first served basis for this, right?”

Fatty Luo was here to take revenge. Just now, Yu mingdong had also used the “first come, first served” theory to attack him.

Yu mingdong glanced at fatty Luo and said indifferently,””Am I done? Why was boss Luo so excited? People who don’t know better would think that the 50 million bid wasn’t from boss li, but you!”

“You ...” Fatty Luo huffed.”You clearly said you’d offer 50 million!”

Yu mingdong couldn’t be bothered with fatty Luo. He looked at Xia ruofei and continued,””Mr. Xia, don’t you need some ordinary Jade? I’m willing to pay 50 million for this piece of Jade, plus the Jade material that’s worth 8 million. I hope you can part with it ...” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Fatty Luo’s mouth suddenly opened wide, and his chubby face revealed a shocked expression. He stared at Yu mingdong as if he didn’t know him, and he couldn’t say anything for a long time.

The other Jade merchants who were watching the bidding also gasped in shock.
