Chapter 185: The mystery of the water tower (3)

In order to ensure that truffles could be produced normally during the truffle season at the end of the year, Xia ruofei decided to use truffles to artificially infect the oak tree roots before filling the soil back. Xia ruofei was familiar with the process since he had already done it once. He took out a piece of white truffle and a piece of black truffle, which were relatively light, from the packing box and cut them into thin slices with a military dagger. Xia ruofei made a few cuts on the roots of each oak tree and carefully stuck the truffle mushrooms on them. Finally, he filled the space with soil. The supporting wood would be put aside for the time being, and they could be removed after the oak trees had taken root. Xia ruofei opened up the spiritual pond water from the stream and watered each tree. Then, he watered the roots of each tree with some diluted flower petal solution. Another one to two hours had passed. Xia ruofei estimated that it was almost dawn outside. Fortunately, he had the petal solution and the spatial spirit pool water to replenish his energy. It was not a problem to stay up all night. Xia ruofei was also covered in mud. He packed his things and prepared to leave the medium. At this time, Blackie and the other puppies were looking at Xia ruofei with eager eyes. They would turn their heads to look at the tidying box that contained the diluted petal solution from time to time. Xia ruofei was amused and asked,””You want to drink?” Blacky immediately barked twice, and the seven little dogs all wagged their tails. They naturally didn’t know what the petal solution was. The reason why they desired it so much was entirely out of instinct. “Alright! I’ll improve your lives today!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. This whole box of solution only had one petal in it. He had only used half of it to water the oak Forest, so Xia ruofei did not feel much heartache. He found a shallow basin for feeding the puppies, carried a tidying box, and poured some flower petal solution into the basin. Then, he smiled and said,””Come and drink!” The little dogs immediately pounced over impatiently. At that moment, Blackie let out a low Wuwu sound. The furry animals immediately fell silent and stopped in their tracks. Blackie wagged its tail in satisfaction. It slowly walked to the shallow basin and enjoyed the petal solution alone. Fluffy one, fluffy two, and the other six puppies were very envious, but they did not dare to take a step further. They could only watch from the side. Blackie only stopped after drinking half of the petal solution. Then, it ran to Xia ruofei’s feet and licked his shoes gently. It even wagged its tail, looking very intimate. It was only after Blackie barked twice that fluffy one and fluffy two dared to take action. They all rushed to the shallow basin in fear and fought for the remaining petal solution in the shallow basin. Xia ruofei saw this and laughed.””Little black, your prestige is very high!” Little black whimpered proudly. Xia ruofei gently patted Blackie’s head and said,””You guys stay in the space, I have to go out...Don’t bully them too much!” Woof woof! Blackie barked twice. It barked twice to show that it understood Xia ruofei’s order. With a thought, Xia ruofei left the new space in a flash and returned to the outside world. The light of dawn shone through the curtains into the room. The sky outside was indeed starting to brighten. Xia ruofei went to the bathroom to change out of her dirty clothes. She took a hot shower, changed into a clean set of clothes, and strolled downstairs. Ye Lingyun was already practicing military boxing in the yard, while Hu Zi’s mother was busy preparing breakfast in the kitchen. Seeing Xia ruofei come down, Hu Zi’s mother greeted him with a smile,””RUO can fly? Why didn’t you sleep a little longer?” “I’ve slept enough!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Auntie, I heard that you went back to the village to attend the wedding banquet yesterday? Did everything go smoothly?” “It’s pretty good. I haven’t been back in a long time. It feels pretty good to chat with my old neighbors!” Hu Zi’s mother said. “That’s good. It’s not bad to go back and take a look. ” “Ruofei, wait a moment. Breakfast will be ready soon.” Hu Zi’s mother said. “It’s fine, I’ll go to the farm first!” Xia ruofei said,”thank you for your hard work, Auntie!” “Hey, what’s so hard about cooking?” Hu Zi’s mother said with a smile. Xia ruofei walked out of the mansion, greeted ye Lingyun, and walked towards the shed. The morning air on the farm was very fresh, and the chirping of birds could be heard from afar from time to time, giving people a relaxed and happy feeling. Xia ruofei went to the large shed and saw that no one was around. He summoned the spirit painting scroll from his palm and took out the farming tools he had taken yesterday and put them back in place. Then, Xia ruofei patrolled around the greenhouse. After Cao tieshu and the others had worked overtime for a day yesterday, the greenhouse was now filled with vegetables. Although they were just some seedlings, they were still lush green and full of vitality. In less than a month, the first batch of vegetables would be harvested. By then, it would be enough to supply the two cooperative catering companies, and the cooperation with Hengfeng group would also be fully launched. After Xia ruofei walked around, he thought for a while and strolled towards the back of the mountain. He followed the newly built cement road up to the water tower at the top of the mountain. The water here was specially used for irrigation. When they were designing the farm, Xia ruofei had specifically suggested to separate the domestic water and the irrigation water. Such requirements were normal. Irrigation water was generally drawn directly from the river, which could save costs. If all water was used, the monthly water bill would be a big expense. Therefore, manager li was not surprised by Xia ruofei’s request. He designed the current irrigation system, the Huanhuan water tower, according to his request. It was set up on the top of the mountain. Through the relay of several water pumps, the water from Shangqing stream, which meandered through the foot of the mountain, was pumped into the water tower for the irrigation of the entire farm. In fact, Xia ruofei’s request was more for his own convenience. He only needed to add some petal solution into the water tower regularly to ensure the high quality of all the crops on the farm. Moreover, the water tower was located at the top of the mountain and was in a remote location. As long as Xia ruofei paid more attention, the secret of the spirit map scroll would not be exposed. The vegetables from yesterday had already been planted, so this was Xia ruofei’s first time here. He was going to add the petal solution into the water tower. He carefully observed his surroundings. After making sure that there was no danger, he summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm and then took out the large tidying box that contained the diluted petal solution. Previously, he had watered half of the oak tree and fed a little to Blackie and the rest. Now, there was about a third of it left. Xia ruofei opened the lid above the water tower and poured all the petal solution in. In this way, he would not have to worry about the crops in the farm for at least one or two months. Besides, there was only about one – third of the petals here. Xia ruofei could still afford to consume such a small amount. After putting the box into the medium and keeping the painting, Xia ruofei dusted his hands and prepared to go home for breakfast. When they were halfway up the mountain, Xia ruofei’s phone rang.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
