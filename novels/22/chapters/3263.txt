Chen Nanfeng and the other two didn’t leave for a long time. They watched as the black Phoenix flying ship disappeared from their sight and then quickly flew out of the range of their spiritual power. The three of them still maintained their posture of looking up at the sky.

After a long time, Chen Nanfeng sighed and said,””Fellow Daoists, I don’t know if their departure will be a blessing or a curse!”

This time, not only did Chen Nanfeng send out the sect’s elder, Shen tianfang, who held an important position in the sect, but even his own son, Chen Xuan, was also on the expedition. Mu Sheng’s vast waves sect had also sent an elder. Mu Sheng’s son, mu Jianfei, was also in the expedition team. As for Liu Mansha’s soaring Flower Valley, they had also sent elder Yang Liu and Liu Mansha’s personal disciple, Yu xiner. Hence, the three of them were in a similar mood.

“Brother Chen, even if you know that this trip is dangerous, if you choose again, I’m sure you’ll still agree to let nephew Chen go!” Mu Sheng sighed.

“Yeah!” Chen Nanfeng smiled bitterly. Since you’ve embarked on the path of cultivation, you must be prepared to face all dangers and challenges. Flowers in a greenhouse can’t stand the true wind and rain!”

Liu Mansha pursed her lips and smiled,”fellow Daoists, why are you even more sentimental than a woman like me?” Other cultivators couldn’t even dream of such an opportunity! To be honest, I’m a little envious of them. If I could pass the screening of that piece, I wouldn’t hesitate to join!”

“That’s true ...” Chen Nanfeng said,”if a cultivator doesn’t even have the courage to take risks, then his cultivation achievements will be limited!”

“Hahaha! Brother Chen, Valley master Liu, they’ve already left, so let’s not stay here and worry!” Mu Sheng smiled and said,”isn’t there a saying? Children and grandchildren have their own fortunes! Even if we regret it now, we won’t be able to catch up to them! That’s why! Don’t think about anything else, just go back and wait patiently! I’ve heard that you’ve hidden a lot of good wine and your famous wild tea. This time, don’t keep searching, take it out and share it with everyone!”

“No problem!” Chen Nanfeng laughed. Let’s go! I’ve asked the disciples to prepare a banquet, let’s have a good drink!”

The three of them left the small square of the resort together and walked in the direction of the main building.

In the near future, this holiday villa would no longer be open for guests, and Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha would also be staying here.

Their sect’s matters had already been arranged. The only thing they had to do now was to wait patiently. Before they left, Chen Nanfeng had made it clear to Xia ruofei and the others that they would still land here when they returned.

If everything went well, Xia ruofei and the others would be back in about two months.

Two months was nothing for golden core stage cultivators. Even a small closed – door cultivation would take longer than this. Therefore, Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others were too lazy to go back and forth. They simply stayed here and waited patiently.

……

On the black Phoenix flying ship, Xia ruofei and the rest had been standing on the front deck the entire time, looking down at the scenery that was rapidly becoming smaller.

Soon, the tens of thousands of lights on the ground were like stars, and for a moment, it felt like the world had been turned upside down.

The black Phoenix flying ship continued to rise at a constant speed. When they reached an altitude of about three thousand meters, Xia ruofei got everyone to put on their Eva suits.

However, he did not stop the flying boat this time. Instead, he let the flying boat continue to ascend at a constant speed.

Before they knew it, the spaceship had already reached an altitude of about 400 kilometers.

At this moment, everyone was already in a state of zero gravity. However, they still remained on the deck. In any case, the black Phoenix flying ship had activated a barrier and a protective barrier, so it was impossible for everyone to float outside due to the lack of gravity.

On the contrary, as they continued to rise, the magnificent scenery outside became even more attractive, so no one was willing to return to the cabin.

Everyone was now at an altitude of four hundred kilometers. Standing on the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship, they could already see the huge outline of the blue Earth. The hazy Halo at the boundary between dawn and dusk, as well as the city lights scattered all over the place, gave a rare and magnificent view that gave people a very shocking feeling.

Standing on the deck of the black Phoenix flying ship, one’s line of sight was completely unobstructed, and the view was excellent. It could be said that out of the billions of people on earth, only a few people could appreciate such a scenery. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Only one in a million or even one in ten thousand astronauts would be able to see such a scenery. Other than a small number of astronauts who had experience walking in space, the rest of the astronauts would be in spaceships, experiment modules, and even space stations. They would only be able to see parts of the earth through the narrow porthole. How could they have such a panoramic view?

The black Phoenix flying ship was not always rising in a straight line. Its trajectory was somewhat similar to a rocket ‘s, but it was more precipitous than a normal rocket’ s. However, at an altitude of four hundred kilometers, the black Phoenix flying ship was basically in a state of orbiting Earth.

According to the original plan, they would have to switch to the Dragon Ship at this height. Hence, under Xia ruofei’s control, the black Phoenix flying ship stopped ascending.

Xia ruofei laughed in the communication channel.”Everyone, take a good look at this scenery! Once we enter the ship, we won’t have such a wide view!”
