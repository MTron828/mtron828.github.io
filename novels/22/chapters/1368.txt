Chapter 1369: Tour the three mountains and tour Heron Island (1)

Translator: 549690339

“Brother Xia,” Hou Liang said with a bitter expression.”Even if it’s the cost price ... We can’t afford it!”

This time, he and Wei Jun had to tighten their belts to take out 5 million Chinese dollars to invest in the club. They had to rely on Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun to borrow money to raise 10 million Chinese dollars to invest.

A Red Arowana of this quality would cost six to seven million. Even if it was the cost price, Hou Liang and the others wouldn’t be able to afford it.

Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”look at you!” When our club starts to make money, you’ll all become rich. What’s a few million to you?”

The eyes of Hou Liang and the others immediately lit up. Why didn’t I think of the club? How could the profit margin of a club that his buddies worked together to run be low? Although he did not have a lot of shares, it would not be a problem for him to buy a pair of Red Arowana. Furthermore, Xia ruofei had already said that he would pay him the cost price.

When he thought of this, Hou Liang beamed with joy and continued to giggle foolishly.

Zhao Yongjun also smiled,”don’t worry, Liang!” RUO Fei’s ability to make money is obvious to all. The project he’s optimistic about will definitely make a lot of money!”

“That’s right! I’m not convinced about other things, but I can’t be unconvinced about his ability to make money!” Song Rui, who often went against Xia ruofei, also teased him.”Even if the few of us were to join forces, we still can’t compare to him!”

“Don’t you guys think of praising me to death!” Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said,”at most, the blood Dragon will give you the cost price. It’s impossible to give it away for free!”

Everyone burst into laughter.

In fact, Xia ruofei still had 50 to 60 blood red Dragons in his storage space. Their quality was similar to the ones he had sold last time. However, the market price of these high – end ornamental fish had always been high. Even if he gave them away for free, Zhao Yongjun and the others would definitely not take them. After all, they were too expensive.

Moreover, the rarer something was, the more expensive it would be. If Xia ruofei really gave it to them for free, people like Hou Liang, who did not know much about the preciousness of Red Arowana, might not think it was rare and would not feel that he owed them a big favor. It was better to sell it to them at a much lower price than the market price and at “cost price”. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia ruofei continued,”stop surrounding the fish tank!” You’re going to scare my Red Arowana! Come over and have some tea! Let me tell you ... These tea leaves of mine are not inferior to the legendary mother tree, Da Hong Pao!”

“Is it the same tea as the one you gave my grandfather?” song Rui asked immediately.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it’s the same batch of tea!” I don’t have a lot of it, so I usually keep it for myself. I don’t take it out to serve guests easily, but you’re finally here!”

Zhao Yongjun and the others also sat around the coffee table with interest.

Xu Zixuan asked,”brother Xia, I seem to see that your paradise corporation’s Skycat flagship store also has tea leaves for sale. The prices aren’t cheap either!”

Xia ruofei glanced at Xu Zi Xuan and laughed,”I didn’t think Zixuan would still pay attention to our online flagship store!”

Xu Zi Xuan scratched his head in embarrassment and said: “Hehe, I even bought some iron – skinned fengdou last time! It’s for my grandfather! You don’t say, the quality is really high!”

“Yo! Zixuan is still my client!” Xia ruofei teased,”our tin Kaede is the same as the most expensive one in Tongren Hall. In fact, Tongren Hall’s tin Kaede is provided by our company. We will produce more in case of emergency and sell the rest in our online store.”

Wei Jun nodded and said,”I’ve also heard from my dad. Although paradise corporation’s Ironhide maples are the most expensive, they’re still in short supply. All the stores in the country want to get some quota!” The Qiantang branch is really awesome now!”

In the beginning, paradise Corporation had signed a sales agreement with the Qiantang branch of Tongren Tang. Although after acquiring the tin fengdou, the chain company’s headquarters would transfer it to the major stores, the Qiantang branch still had a certain right to speak and would definitely get the most quota.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”Speaking of which, I have to thank Wei Jun and liangzi!” We’ve reached an agreement with Tongren Hall on the supply and sales of Cordyceps, and soon everyone will be able to buy the top quality Cordyceps from Tongren Hall!”

“Brother Xia, you’re too kind!” Wei Jun quickly replied. I didn’t do much, and your things are so good that I can’t even get them! It’s all because of the people below!”

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”no matter what, it’s all thanks to you for helping to coordinate this.” By the way, if you need to give your elders the Ironhide fengdou and aweto, you can just look for me. Although I’m not particularly rich, I can still afford to give you some of my own products!”

“You’re also a businessman,” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.”We can’t break the rules ...”

Then, Zhao Yongjun looked at Xia ruofei, who was skillfully making tea, and asked with a smile,””Oh right ruofei, just now Zixuan said that the tea he’s selling online, is it the same as your tea?”

Xia ruofei raised his head and smiled.””The ones sold online are mass – produced, and the quality isn’t low, but they’re still a little different from my private collection. Most of the tea leaves come from the next generation of tea trees, and the tea – making process is slightly worse, but if you’re not an expert, you shouldn’t be able to tell!”

Most of the Da Hong Pao tea leaves that were sold in bulk on the internet were cut from the third generation of the parent tree Da Hong Pao. Although ye Lingyun’s skills were passed down by old man Li Zhifu, his control of fire was still not as good as Xia Qing ‘s. Therefore, if one were to be picky, they would definitely not be as good as the batch of tea leaves that Xia ruofei had collected.
