Scholar Yuntai paused for a moment and continued,””At that time, everyone treated venerable yang Shan’s point of view as an after – meal topic ...”

“Why?” Xia ruofei felt that it was very strange.”Venerable yang Shan has such high attainments in mathematics, and his cultivation is also extremely high. By right, everyone should pay more attention to his opinions!”

“If everyone follows venerable yang Shan’s suggestion, then we might as well not try to break the rising Dragon Order,” said layman Yuntai with a smile.”Even venerable yang Shan thinks there’s no hope!” In fact, who could resist that kind of temptation? In our time, there were many legends about the rising Dragon, some of which even the most powerful people in the leaving aperture stage would be moved by. ”

“In addition ...” Layman Yuntai said,”among those who study the rising Dragon Token all year round, there are a few whose cultivation is on par with venerable yang Shan ‘s. They’ve invested a lot of time and energy into it, so they naturally won’t give up easily just because of a few words from senior yang Shan. Moreover, it was a battle between two schools, and venerable yang Shan insisted that the correct way was to solve it from an arithmetic perspective.”Some of the seniors have been trying the solution you mentioned before, where each floating point corresponds to a character. They keep trying various character combinations, and some persist for hundreds of years ...”

Xia ruofei was speechless after hearing this. The Super calculator needed less than four hours to complete the calculation. It would take a Jindan, Yuanying, and yuanshen expert hundreds of years of hard work and they could not complete it.

From this point of view, it was really hard to say which was better between modern technology civilization and cultivation civilization!

The so – called “nothing is absolute” referred to this situation.

Every inch had its own strengths and weaknesses.

Xia ruofei decided to modify and perfect the algorithm immediately. He would try to run the program again with the remaining time.

This time, he was even more confident than before.

At this moment, Mu Sheng came over with Xia ruofei’s laptop. He smiled bitterly and said,””Little brother Xia, this ... Computer, I’ll return it to you.”

“Senior mu, aren’t you going to read it?” Xia ruofei asked, feeling a little strange.

Mu Sheng definitely wouldn’t be able to finish reading the remaining 750 documents in such a short time. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Mu Sheng said,”I’m dizzy from watching it, so I’m not going to watch anymore!” I’m not looking! We’ve all checked this together, so I’m afraid I won’t find anything new ...”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”Then, senior mu, please take a rest. I’ll change the algorithm as soon as possible. I’ll try to make use of the remaining time to do another calculation.”

“Good! Then I’ll have to trouble little brother Xia!” Mu Sheng said,”I hope we can get a good result this time, haha!”

In fact, Mu Sheng and the others were already used to failure. If they didn’t gain anything this time, they wouldn’t feel too disappointed. At most, they would be a little disappointed. Then, they would continue to work hard on the solution.

Mu Sheng did not want to disturb Xia ruofei while he was coding. After returning the computer, he sat down on the sofa on the other side and chatted with Liu Mansha in a low voice.

Xia ruofei looked at the laptop that was still fully charged and his heart moved.

He first put the computer into the stone room in the cave in the mountain sea realm of the spirit map space.

His behavior did not attract the attention of the rest in the lounge. Everyone must have thought that Xia ruofei had put the laptop in his storage treasure. This was a very normal behavior. If it were them, they would have done the same.

Then, Xia ruofei used his spiritual will to communicate with scholar Yuntai.””Yuntai senior, I’ve brought back my computer, and it has high – resolution scans of floating point pictures, as well as the most likely 1000 text combinations from the previous text scheme. If you are interested, you can take a look!”

“I’m interested!”Answered layman Yuntai. Of course I’m interested! He was idle anyway! But ... The computer you mentioned ... How do I use it?”

Now, layman Yuntai was only left with his spirit body. Although he could use his spirit body to control the things in the outside world, he was now inside the mysterious ore space, which made it even more difficult to control. Moreover, such control would inevitably cause damage to his spirit body.

It would be extremely difficult to replenish the spiritual energy after it was depleted.

Therefore, unless he had no other choice, Yuntai would not stupidly consume his spirit body to control the objects in the outside world.

Of course, Xia ruofei could also use his spiritual power to control the computer remotely.

However, his top priority now was to modify and perfect the algorithm program, so he naturally couldn’t be distracted by helping scholar Yuntai open and close the pictures or turn the pages of the documents.

Hence, Xia ruofei simply called Xia Qing to the stone room in the cave.

The stone chamber in the cave was an absolutely forbidden area for anyone other than the owner of the spirit map space.

Of course, with Xia ruofei’s permission, Xia Qing could enter the cave.

Simple computer operations were not high – tech, and Xia Qing learned very quickly. After a few minutes, she learned to use the touchpad to control the mouse, open and close documents, pictures, and other basic operations.

Xia ruofei communicated with Xia Qing through divine sense and taught her the basics at the fastest speed.

After that, Xia ruofei left Xia Qing in the stone room of the cave, temporarily acting as the “Secretary” of Yuntai scholar.

Xia ruofei said to master Yuntai,”master Yuntai, please take your time. Take your time. If you find anything new, please let me know at any time!”

“I know! You can go!” Scholar Yuntai casually said,”little puppet! First, help me open the HD scan that little brat Xia mentioned, let me see how clear it is!”

Xia ruofei smiled and retracted his spiritual power. He no longer actively tried to sense what was happening in the stone room. Of course, if Xia Qing or master Yuntai contacted him, he would receive it immediately.

Xia ruofei’s fingers flew across his laptop, deleting the codes and adding new ones.

The algorithm that he had constructed in his mind was gradually realized through the code.

This algorithm was a test of one’s logical thinking ability, especially when modifying the original algorithm. The difficulty was actually greater.

However, Xia ruofei had already sorted out his thoughts. He did not need to think much. In addition, his hand speed was extremely fast. The code on the computer kept rolling up. Ordinary people could not even see the contents on the screen.

Even so, Xia ruofei spent almost an hour to modify the algorithm program.

He called Chen Xuan over, and the two of them spent about half an hour checking the entire algorithm program.

Xia ruofei was the clearest about the logic of the entire program. Hence, as he flipped through the pages, he explained the purpose of the code to Chen Xuan in a low voice so that Chen Xuan could understand it faster and save as much time as possible.

During the examination, they made minor adjustments to two or three areas that were flawed.

In fact, a more reliable method would be to run the program in a simulation environment for a while to verify the stability of the program before running it on a supercomputer.

However, time was running out. Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan rushed to check the algorithm program. There were less than four hours left.

If he wasted any more time, he was afraid that the remaining time would not be enough to complete the calculation process.

Hence, Xia ruofei quickly encrypted the program and sealed it. Then, he copied it to a portable hard disk that had been cleared and quickly went to the control room.

“Engineer he, I’ve made some adjustments to the algorithm program. Please help us run it again!” Xia ruofei knocked on the door of the control room and handed the hard drive to the technician on duty.

The technician was a little surprised, but the leader had told him last night to cooperate with Xia ruofei. Besides, the other party’s time was not up yet, and the equipment was still idle. Why should he be the bad guy and reject Xia ruofei’s reasonable request?

“No problem!” The technician readily took the hard drive and said,”please wait a moment. I’ll run the program and then send the hard drive out to you!”

“Alright! Thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei said.
