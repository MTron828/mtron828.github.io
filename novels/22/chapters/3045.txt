Translator: 5496903Soon, Xia ruofei found a signal on his phone.

So, he found Ling Qingxue’s phone number and dialed it.

“RUO Fei? Why did you suddenly think of calling me?” Ling Qingxue was pleasantly surprised to receive a call from Xia ruofei.”Are you still on Peach Blossom Island?”

“Where are you, my wife?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I’m on my way to the company!” Ling Qingxue replied,”he’s driving!”

“Then, I’ll make it short!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”is there a problem with taking two days off?”

“Is there something fun again?” Ling Qingxue’s interest was piqued.

“It’s a good thing anyway!” Xia ruofei chuckled and said,”tell uncle Ling that he’ll be back in two days at the latest.”

“Alright! Good!” Ling Qingxue said without hesitation,”then should I ... Go to the airport directly?” Is paradise already back?”

Ling Qingxue felt that since he had something to do, he was most likely going to Peach Blossom Island. She naturally thought that Xia ruofei had sent a public jet to pick her up.

“There’s no need to go through so much trouble. You can find a place to turn around, then go back to the neighborhood and wait on my rooftop!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Your home? The rooftop?” Ling Qingxue said in surprise. Then, she immediately reacted and asked in surprise,”you’re taking me on a flying sword?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’ll know soon!” Don’t ask so many questions, just focus on driving!”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue said excitedly.

She felt that she had already guessed Xia ruofei’s plan. Since Yingying was waiting on the rooftop, she would definitely fly away on her sword! She had been looking forward to experiencing sword Kinesis flight for a long time. Just thinking about it made her feel excited.

As such, Ling Qingxue immediately turned around at the next intersection and drove back. At the same time, she gave her father Ling Xiaotian a call.

When Ling Xiaotian heard that Xia ruofei wanted to take Ling Qingxue out for two days, he agreed without hesitation. He even told Ling Qingxue not to rush back and to have fun outside.

It was the peak hour of the morning on the three mountains. Although Ling Qingxue had not driven far, she was stuck in traffic for a while when she turned around and drove back. By the time she parked her car in the courtyard of Xia ruofei’s Riverside Villa, nearly 20 minutes had passed.

Ling Qingxue hurriedly locked the gates of the mansion and the car, then quickly walked into the mansion.

Xia ruofei’s Villa had Ling Qingxue’s fingerprint and Iris scan, so she could move freely at any time.

Ling Qingxue took the elevator to the third floor, then climbed another flight of stairs to the large balcony on the top floor.

Such a long period of time was enough for Xia ruofei to take the black Swift Boat to make a round trip across the Strait. Hence, Xia ruofei was naturally already waiting on the rooftop.

After his black flying boat had turned on the shielding function, ordinary people could not see it at all. Thus, it descended from the sky openly and suspended above the balcony on the top floor of his villa.

After Xia ruofei kept the flying boat, he gave Song Wei a call. They agreed to meet on the rooftop of Capital university’s library in an hour.

Song Wei did not understand Xia ruofei’s strange request. Of course, she quickly guessed that Xia ruofei wanted to bring her on a flying sword, so she happily agreed.

Song Wei did not have any classes in the morning, so she was reading in the library. Therefore, she didn’t even need to do anything. She just had to wait until it was almost time to go to the rooftop.

The moment Ling Qingxue reached the balcony, she saw Xia ruofei leaning against the railing, grinning at her.

Ling Qingxue laughed and said,””Why are you being so mysterious when you’re back at the gong family? Speak! Where are you taking me?”

“Let me think ...” Xia ruofei counted on his fingers.”The capital, Australia, Paradise Island ... There are so many places we have to go!”

Ling Qingxue’s eyes widened.””So many places? Still that far? Going to the capital? Don’t tell me that you’re going to take me and Wei Wei and fly across the ocean to Australia or even to Paradise Island on your sword?”

Xia ruofei snapped his fingers and said,”The route you mentioned is basically correct!”

Ling Qingxue looked at Xia ruofei, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. “Aren’t you afraid that you’ll die of exhaustion?”

“Are you trying to say that there are only cows that die from exhaustion, not ones that are broken from plowing ...” Xia ruofei laughed evilly.

Ling Qingxue blushed and lowered her eyes.”A dog’s mouth can’t spit out ivory!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry!” I’m a tough bull, I won’t die of exhaustion! Besides ... I don’t recall saying that I’m going to fly over on my own sword!”

“Then you asked me to meet you on the rooftop ...” Ling Qingxue said.

Her words were stuck in her throat before she could finish them. Her eyes were fixed on the black airboat beside Xia ruofei that was rapidly growing in size. In the blink of an eye, it had grown to more than 20 meters long and was now quietly suspended about two meters above the rooftop. Song Wei did not have any classes in the morning, so she was reading in the library. Therefore, she didn’t even need to do anything. She just had to wait until it was almost time to go to the rooftop.
