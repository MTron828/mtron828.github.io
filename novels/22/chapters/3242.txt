3243 A doctor’s parental heart (2)

Then, Xia ruofei took out the silver needles from the needle bag. He tore open a bag of gauze and spread it on the small table beside the crib. Then, he carefully disinfected the silver needles with an alcohol cotton ball.

After disinfecting one, he placed the silver needle on the gauze.

Then, Xia ruofei used medical alcohol to carefully disinfect his hand.

After finishing the preparation, Xia ruofei bent down and carefully sanitized the part that needed to be injected with the alcohol swab.

Xia ruofei had thought of all the acupuncture points in advance, so he disinfected the wound very quickly. After a while, he put down the last alcohol – soaked cotton swab and picked up a silver needle.

Both Elon Musk and grams could not help but clench their fists, especially Elon Musk. He could not see the acupuncture process just now, but now he saw Xia ruofei holding the shining silver needles in front of the crib. His son, little X, was lying on the bed, and the small body formed a sharp contrast with the long silver needles. His heart could not help but hang.

Xia ruofei did not hesitate at all. His hands were steady and accurate as he quickly inserted the silver needle into an acupuncture point on little X’s back. His movements were so fast that even Elon Musk and the rest did not see it clearly. The silver needle was already shaking on little X’s back.

Elon Musk and grams subconsciously looked at little X’s Face. They realized that the child was just as Xia ruofei had said. He was still in a deep sleep and did not wake up from the pain of a needle in his back.

Seeing this scene, the two’s hanging hearts finally relaxed a little.

Xia ruofei had already entered a state of complete focus when he was examining the nine cloud contact needles. He needed to be extremely focused, especially when it came to little X. Little X was too small and his body was very delicate. He could not afford to make even the slightest mistake, or else he would be in danger.

Even if there was danger, Xia ruofei had the petals of the spirit Heart Flower to deal with it in time. Furthermore, elonmask and gramus would not be able to see through it. However, Xia ruofei had always been like this. It was fine if he did not do it, but once he did, he would do it to the best of his ability. He was always pursuing perfection.

Therefore, he was completely focused at the moment. His eyes were fixed on the patient, and his hands did not stop moving.

Even though he didn’t turn his head to look, he could accurately pick out size most suitable silver needle every time.

Elon Musk was dazzled. In a short while, the nine silver needles had all been inserted into the corresponding acupuncture points.

Other than Xia ruofei, no one else in the room, including Li Yifu, knew anything about the nine cloud contact needles. They were just here to watch the show.

But Xia ruofei was very clear in his heart that the moyun nine required a high level of control for the person who applied the needles. Finding the correct acupuncture points was only the most basic requirement. The size of each needle, the depth of penetration, the order in which the needle was inserted, all had to be paid attention to carefully. There could not be a single mistake in any link.

After the needle was inserted, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but give himself a thumbs up. So far, it was almost perfect. Xia ruofei even felt that he had performed beyond his usual level.

The following process was no easier than inserting the needles. Strictly speaking, the following series of techniques were the essence of the nine cloud contact needles.

However, for most people, it was difficult to even complete the previous step of acupuncture successfully. After all, the requirements were too high. Moreover, the patient was so special that the fault tolerance rate for acupuncture on such a young child was much lower than that of an adult.

Xia ruofei took a deep breath. As he twisted the silver needle, he transferred a small amount of Yuan Qi into the needle.

His movements were getting faster and faster, and laymen could not see the rhythm at all. However, every action of acupuncture had a deep meaning. Any mistake in the step might have a great side effect on the treatment effect, or even cause danger.

If the famous doctor Ge Jun was here, he would definitely be mesmerized.

Without a professional audience, Xia ruofei could only feel good about himself.

Using Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncture to treat the patient, especially such a difficult acupuncture technique, was a very high sense of accomplishment.

The acupuncture process lasted for about 20 to 30 minutes. Even Xia ruofei, whose cultivation, especially spiritual power, was improving rapidly, could not help but sweat on his forehead.

Finally, Xia ruofei gently flicked the end of the last silver needle and transferred the last bit of vital Qi into little X’s body through the silver needle. Then, he retracted his hand.

He wasn’t exactly exhausted, but it was hard to avoid sweating when he was in a state of high concentration. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

From the perspective of elonmask and grams, Xia ruofei’s treatment was undoubtedly very difficult. Although they did not know how good it was, they were very grateful and touched when they saw the sweat on Xia ruofei’s forehead and the tired look he deliberately showed.

Xia ruofei let out a long sigh of relief and said,””These nine silver needles need to be kept for half an hour. During this time, we have to prevent the child from turning over, so someone must be on guard at all times. I’ll come back to collect the silver needles after half an hour.”

“I’ll stay here to look after the child!”Grams quickly said. Don’t worry! I won’t even blink my eyes. I definitely won’t let him turn over. ”

The child’s back was pierced with nine shining silver needles. If he subconsciously turned over and pressed down on these silver needles, it would really hurt just thinking about it!

“Alright!” Elonmask said. My dear, thank you for your hard work! Dr. Xia, Mr. Li, let’s go to the next room and rest for a while! I’ll have to trouble you, doctor Xia, in half an hour!”

“Alright! “I’m indeed a little tired ...” Xia ruofei nodded in agreement after seeing that there was nothing to do for the time being.

Xia ruofei then explained,””This set of acupuncture techniques is extremely energy – consuming, and I really can’t hold on much longer.”

“Thank you, doctor Xia!” Elon Musk said, touched. This way, please! You should take the time to rest ...”

Elon Musk personally accompanied Xia ruofei and Li Yifu to the room next door.

As for the nurse and the nanny, Elon Musk did not let them in since Xia ruofei did not say anything, considering that the silver needles were still in the child’s body. He let them continue to wait in the corridor.

In any case, he was just looking after the child and not letting him turn over randomly. Grams alone was enough to do this job.

Everyone sat down on the soft leather sofa, and elonmask said sincerely,””Doctor Xia, thank you!”

Xia ruofei sat on the sofa and waved his hand.””Mr. Masker, I’ve said it before. A doctor should have the heart of a parent. Since you trust me and let me treat little X’s illness, I will definitely do my best. This is also the duty of a doctor!”

“No matter what, grams and I have to thank you for your hard work, doctor Xia!” Elon Musk said,”by the way, Mr. Li, about the big business deal you talked about last time, I want to know what you need first. Is it just an EVA suit? How many sets do you need?”

The cost of an EVA suit was as high as 20 to 30 million dollars. Even for a super – rich man like Elon Musk, such an expense was quite large.

Li Yifu’s wealth was roughly the same as that of Elon Musk, but most of the industries under Li Yifu’s name were industrial, which was still very different from the high – tech companies in Elon Musk.

The most obvious difference was that Li Yifu’s cash flow would be much more abundant than that of Elon Musk.

If Elon Musk’s SpaceX were to place an order, more than ten sets might have a great impact on the company’s capital operation. And for Li Yifu, it was not too difficult to gather hundreds of millions of dollars in cash in a short time.

Of course, even if Elon Musk was involved in the field of space commercial operations, he would not order ten sets of EVA spacesuits at once, because no space mission would use so many.

Xia ruofei and Li Yifu looked at each other, and a hint of Joy Rose in their hearts. Since elonmask was willing to talk about the details, it meant that the matter was basically a deal.

Of course, the subsequent operations would be very complicated. If the treatment for little X was not effective, elonmask might change his mind. After all, businessmen were very realistic.

However, Xia ruofei would not let this happen. He was confident in his treatment.
