Chapter 627: Temporary healer (3)

In other words, he had slept for three to four hours while leaning against the bed ...

Taking care of a child was indeed a skill. The inexperienced temporary nanny Xia ruofei had only told a bedtime story and he had actually hypnotized himself.

Xia ruofei got off the bed quietly and took out his pajamas from the cabinet. Then, he went to the bathroom quietly. He was ready to take a shower and change into his pajamas before going back to bed to sleep.

Xia ruofei had been in that posture for a long time. He felt that something was wrong with his neck and his waist was sore.

Xia ruofei wanted to end the battle quickly, so he did not fill the bathtub with water. Instead, he stood in the bathtub and took the shower head. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He quickly washed his hair, then wet his body. He squeezed some shower gel on his body, and just as he rubbed some bubbles on his body, he heard a knock on the bathroom door.

Then, a child – like voice that was still sleepy was heard.””Brother RUO Fei, are you inside?”

Xia ruofei was shocked and quickly said,””Yup! Huanhuan, why are you up?”

Little ancestor! What are you trying to do in the middle of the night?

Huanhuan said from outside the door,”big brother ruofei, are you done?” I want to pee ...”

Xia ruofei’s hand that was rubbing the bath suddenly froze. He looked at the bubbles on his body and cried without tears. Two seconds later, he came back to his senses and quickly called out,””Huanhuan, bear with it. I’m taking a shower. I’ll be done soon!”

After that, Xia ruofei did not care if he was clean or not. He quickly turned on the shower and flushed himself.

Huan Huan was still outside,”big brother, can you hurry up?” I ... I’m going to pee my pants ...”

......

Xia ruofei could vaguely hear Huan Huan’s footsteps outside.

It really took his life!

Xia ruofei took a few random showers and didn’t care if the foam was clean or not. He immediately pulled the bath towel over and quickly wiped it a few times. Then, he quickly put on his clothes and rushed to open the bathroom door.

The moment the door opened, Huan Huan rushed in.

Xia ruofei asked,”you know how to use a toilet?” Do you need my help?”

“I will ...” Huanhuan said as she took off her pajama pants.

Xia ruofei rubbed his forehead and walked out with a face full of despair.

The sound of running water came from behind him. Huanhuan walked out in her little slippers with a sleepy face.

“Huanhuan, go back to bed. Don’t catch a cold ...” Xia ruofei said.

Then, he turned around and prepared to go back to the bathroom.

“Brother ruofei, aren’t you going to sleep?” Huan Huan asked weakly.

“You sleep first, big brother will be right over!” Xia ruofei squeezed out a smile and said.

Huan Huan looked at Xia ruofei pitifully and said,””But I’m scared to sleep alone ...”

Xia ruofei wanted to cry but had no tears.”My hair is still dripping!” The foam on his body probably hadn’t been washed clean. How could he sleep like this?

Xia ruofei had no choice but to walk to the bed with a bitter smile. He was still leaning against the head of the bed and was ready to dry his hair after Huanhuan fell asleep.

Silence.

After a long while, when Xia ruofei thought that Huanhuan was about to fall asleep, the little girl suddenly turned around and looked at Xia ruofei innocently.””Brother ruofei, I suddenly can’t sleep. How about ... You continue to tell me the story of shukbeta? Did they defeat the pipipi’s multi – colored cat?”

Oh heavens!

The earth ...
