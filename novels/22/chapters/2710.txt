2711 Falling into a trap (1)

As a Qi refining Level 7 cultivator, Zheng Yongshou’s hearing was very strong. Moreover, Wang Boshan did not deliberately avoid Zheng Yongshou, so he naturally heard the contents of the phone call. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It seems ... Something we don’t want to see has indeed happened. Tell us your judgment!” Zheng Yongshou said with a gloomy face.

Wang Boshan nodded and said,”martial uncle Zheng, I think the rainbow light benilatti mentioned should be the birth of a spiritual object!” Otherwise, Xia ruofei would not have changed his mind without any warning! Moreover, the last detail that benilatti mentioned was also worth paying attention to. He said that he felt that the air on the island had become a lot fresher, and he felt very comfortable. This is clearly the most intuitive feeling that ordinary people have when they are in a place with rich spirit energy!”

Zheng Yongshou nodded and said,”these are all obvious clues. The key question now is ... How did Xia ruofei get his hands on the spiritual object that came into being so easily? he could even confirm its value and tear up the agreement with us without any hesitation?” Could he be a cultivator?”

Wang Boshan pondered for a while and said,””The possibility of this person being a cultivator is almost zero! After all, we’ve both come into contact with him face to face. If he’s a cultivator, it’s impossible for us not to notice him at all. With his age, even if he was a cultivator, how high could his cultivation be? How could I have hidden it from your eyes?”

Zheng Yongshou slowly nodded and said,””Maybe I’m overthinking it ... The possibility of this person being a cultivator is very low.”

“Yup! Junior uncle Zheng! If he was a cultivator, he wouldn’t have needed to meet us, let alone give up the Peach Blossom Island. ” Wang Boshan said,”all the signs show that he was just lucky! We still don’t know what kind of natural formation it is, but perhaps the spiritual objects that come into being don’t need any profound cultivation to be easily obtained!”

Zheng Yongshou said thoughtfully,”there is such a possibility!” Also ... Even that benilatti could feel the changes brought about by the spiritual energy. This means that he can’t stop the spiritual energy from leaking out from that Fey. This also confirms that this kid is an ordinary person!”

“Yes, I am!” Wang Boshan said,”besides, benilatti only absorbed a little bit of the spiritual energy from the fey and he could feel it so clearly. This Xia ruofei has been in close contact with the fey for so long. He must have gained a lot! Also, didn’t he send people to seal off the place where the spiritual objects appeared? I think this kid is treating the fey as a rare ore. He thinks that it’s a mineral vein and wants to continue excavating more Feys! That’s the only reason that can explain his 180 – degree change in attitude. He stopped the deal and didn’t even want to talk about money. He’s obviously determined!”

Zheng Yongshou coldly snorted and said,”that’s most likely the case!” Hmph! This spiritual object just had to appear at this time of all times. It’s really ruining our great plan!”

“Yup! “It’s not that easy to change Xia ruofei’s mind now ...” Wang Boshan said with a worried look.

Zheng Yongshou sneered and said,””Boshan, are you still holding onto the fantasy of using your so – called commercial means to acquire the Peach Blossom Island? I advise you to wake up! The current situation was very clear! We can’t use the common methods anymore, it’s time to let that ant experience the methods of cultivators!”

Wang Boshan was silent for a moment, and his eyes revealed a trace of ruthlessness,””Martial uncle Zheng, since this kid is determined to ruin our plan! Then we don’t have to follow so many rules! In any case, that place is far away from the cultivation world and is just an isolated island. If we deal with it quickly, no one will find it!”

“It should have been like this long ago!” Zheng Yongshou stood up,”let’s go! Let’s set off now!”

“Junior Master Zheng, that Xia ruofei and the employees on the island are not a cause for concern.” Wang Boshan hesitated for a moment before saying,”according to the situation we have, there are still international mercenaries stationed on Peach Blossom Island. These people are equipped with advanced modern weapons, and the defensive equipment on Peach Blossom Island is also very advanced. If we attack by force, I’m afraid ...”

“A bunch of useless chickens and dogs!” Zheng Yongshou said disdainfully,”besides, we’re going with just the two of us, why do we have to attack? As for the mercenary group you mentioned, we can sneak in late at night and kill them all!”

“Martial uncle Zheng, you mean ... Just the two of us will go and seize the island?” Wang Boshan was stunned for a moment and asked,”don’t we need to report to the sect leader and send more people?”

Zheng Yongshou sneered,”Boshan, you’ve really stayed in the secular world for too long, you’re becoming more and more timid!” You’re afraid of just a few dozen ordinary people and a group of so – called mercenaries?”

“Martial uncle Zheng ... It’s not that I’m afraid, but shouldn’t we ask the sect leader about this?” Wang Boshan said with a bitter smile.

Zheng Yongshou waved his hand and said,”how can we cultivators be so overcautious?” The sect leader has already given us full authority to deal with it. He only looks at the results! Besides, this matter is top secret. After you report back, the sect leader is unlikely to send reinforcements! Unless the old man came personally! Did he have to trouble the sect leader to deal with a few ordinary people? Wouldn’t that make us look too incompetent?”
