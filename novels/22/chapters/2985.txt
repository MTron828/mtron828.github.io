2986 The pair of phoenixes (2)

A tray was placed on the table in front of Hao Qingsong, and the two storage rings were quietly lying on the tray.

“I’m sure many fellow Daoists are waiting for this pair of storage rings!”Hao Qingsong chuckled. To tell the truth, if it wasn’t for the fact that I’m short on money and that our fallen leaves sect is the host, I would have wanted to participate in the competition. ”

Immediately after, Hao Qingsong’s expression changed as he said, “Let’s get back to the main topic. I don’t know the name of this pair of storage rings, but because both rings have the image of a Phoenix spreading its wings and ready to fly, we named them the pair of rings, the flying Phoenix ring. The flying Phoenix pair ring was obtained from an ancient cultivator’s ruins by the fellow Daoist who had entrusted the auction of this pair of storage rings to him. According to the information provided by this fellow Daoist, that ancient cultivation ruin should be a separate courtyard of scholar Yuntai’s immortal’s cave. Combined with the records in a personal letter in this ruin, this pair of storage rings should have been specially made by scholar Yuntai for his twin Dao companions. These two storage rings have the same style, but the pattern is a different Phoenix. Their storage space is both ten meters in diameter ...”

Hao Qingsong explained the situation of these two storage rings in a very familiar manner. Some of the basic information could be found in the auction manual, but some of the information had just been disclosed, such as the detailed origin of these two rings and the specific size of the storage space.

The 30 feet square was a cube of 10 meters by 10 meters by 10 meters, which meant that the storage space had reached 1000 cubic meters. It was already quite good, and it was a small treasure among the storage rings.

In addition, although this Grand cloud stage scholar was an ancient cultivator, he was still quite famous in the modern cultivation world.

In particular, the higher – ups of some sects more or less knew about this layman Yuntai.

The reason was very simple. This scholar Yuntai owned many courtyards and immortal’s caves. Including today’s exploration, there were six immortal’s caves that had been discovered and explored by cultivators.

And it seemed that master Yuntai especially liked to record some trifles. In these courtyards and cave abodes, it wasn’t a rare thing to find personal notes recording trifles of life.

Therefore, everyone naturally knew more about this scholar Yuntai.

According to some past information, it could be roughly pieced together that the portrait of the master of the cloud platform was at least in the Yuanying stage or even higher. He had a handsome appearance (not excluding the fact that the master of the cloud platform boasted in his own diary), had many dual cultivation partners, was involved in a wide range of things, and was especially good at forging artifacts.

Therefore, the magical treasures and items personally sold by master Yuntai were often very popular in the modern cultivation world, and their prices would be much higher than the market price.

A pair of twin female cultivators became the cultivation partner of master Yuntai at the same time. This should be the pride of master Yuntai, which was reflected in several journals. Everyone even knew that one of the Twin female cultivators was called Nishang fairy and the other was purple cloud fairy. According to master Yuntai’s own records, they were both devastatingly beautiful women.

Of course, all the information came from the records of master Yuntai himself, and its authenticity could no longer be verified.

In any case, this pair of storage rings had been personally refined by master Yuntai, and had once been used by Nishang fairy and Ziyun fairy, who were more famous in the modern cultivation world among the ancient cultivators. This meant that this pair of storage rings was of very high quality. At the same time, there was also a historical story, so naturally, their value had doubled.

Luo Qingfeng was relatively familiar with the world of cultivation, so after listening to the introduction, he also told Xia ruofei about the stories of the Grand cloud scholar.

Xia ruofei was also excited after hearing this. He was even more interested in the storage ring.

As for the possibility of the price increasing due to these factors, he didn’t really care.

This was the confidence that the hundreds of thousands of spirit stones had given him.

Of course, even if he didn’t have enough spiritual stones, Xia ruofei had his Plan B, which he had prepared before the auction.

All in all, Xia ruofei was determined to get the two storage rings.

This pair of storage rings was clearly one of the more valuable items in this auction, so Hao Qingsong had spent more time introducing them, hoping to get a higher price.

Just as Hao Qingsong was prattling on and on about this pair of storage rings, a light knock came from the door of room 20. At the same time, Shao Qingyang’s careful voice could be heard,”Fellow Daoist Xia, sect leader Luo, is it convenient for me to come in?”

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng looked at each other and then said loudly,””Please come in, sect leader Shao!”

As soon as Xia ruofei’s voice fell, Shao Qingyang pushed the door open and walked in with a smile on his face. His eyes swept over the hand – written copy of the first volume of the “the truth of linglang” on the coffee table. His eyes immediately lit up, and his steps became lighter.

Xia ruofei pointed at the manuscript and said,””Sect leader Shao, in the next hour, you are free to read this manual, but you can only read it in this private room. I also hope that sect leader Shao will keep your promise and not leak the manual to others.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

For an Aurous core stage cultivator, an hour was more than enough time to memorize this thin booklet.

As a result, although the fallen leaves sect seemed to have been exempted from the Commission of the previous deal, in reality, they had obtained an extremely precious spiritual power cultivation method. Although this cultivation method was only suitable for Qi layer cultivators, it was still a big profit.

“No problem!” Shao Qingyang quickly replied. No problem! Don’t worry, fellow Daoist Xia, we all know the rules!”
