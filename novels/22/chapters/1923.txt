Chapter 1924 A good show (1)

At this moment,’justice is not absent’ sent another WeChat message. There is a switch on the side of the device. After turning it on, there will be a short charging process. After two or three seconds, the green light will light up. Stick it on the password input panel of the fingerprint lock, and the fingerprint lock system will reset. Then, you can open the door with any fingerprint.

In fact, this was the teslan coil that was all over the internet. It was invincible in front of various brands of fingerprint locks, and most fingerprint lock brands were not spared. Of course, the Teslar coil that Xu You had just prepared was also specially made. The effect was much better than the coils that were secretly sold in Taobao stores.

Da Liu picked up the teslan coil in the shape of a card doubtfully. He flipped it over and found a small switch on the side.

He tried to turn the switch to the other side, and after a soft beep, the green indicator light lit up after two seconds.

Da Liu tried to move the teslan coil in the direction of the fingerprint lock, but he pulled back his hand halfway.

Liu Dong’s heart was beating so fast that he felt like it was going to jump out of his chest. He was feeling conflicted. On one hand, he hoped that he had made a mistake and that Fang Chenchen was not inside. On the other hand, he had a strong urge to catch her in the act. After all, he had accepted the cruel reality that Fang Chenchen had cheated on him.

Da Liu’s movements also dodged Liu Dong ‘S. Liu Dong’s tense heart skipped a beat, and he looked at Da Liu in confusion.

Da Liu turned to his underlings and said,””Get the weapons ready and the mobile phone to record the video. We’ll start recording now!”

“Yes, brother da!” The underlings replied in a low voice.

Although Da Liu hadn’t told them the purpose of this trip, everyone had already guessed most of it by this time, so they didn’t dare to speak loudly for fear of alarming the people in the house.

Seeing that everyone was ready, Da Liu patted the nervous Dong Liu, then slowly put the Tess wire on the fingerprint lock.

One second, two seconds, three seconds ...

At first, there was no movement, but after a few seconds, there was a slight sizzling sound, and then the fingerprint lock’s panel flashed on its own. The system had been interfered with by the strong magnetic field generated by the coil and had begun an automatic reset. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After a while, the fingerprint lock panel showed that the reset had been completed.

Da Liu put away the Tesi collar, then turned his head and pointed at one of the underlings, pouting at the fingerprint lock.

The underling immediately understood and stepped forward to press his fingerprint.

Liu Dong and Liu Da watched nervously, worried that their joy would be in vain. They had never thought that such a high – end fingerprint lock would be broken so easily.

Ding dong!

A crisp sound was heard, and the micro – Engine in the lock buzzed, connecting the handle and the lock. The underling pulled the handle, and the anti – Theft door opened.

Da Liu didn’t hesitate. He went up and pulled the door open. Then, he waved his hand, and a group of people swarmed in ...

When Liu Dong and the others rushed into the house, Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen were in the living room doing some primitive exercise.

The high – Class apartment was like an independent kingdom, and it was also Liu haojun’s soft spot for fun. He never cared about the space. It could be said that there were traces of him and Fang Chenchen having sex in every corner of the apartment.

After dinner, Fang Chenchen went to the bathroom to take a shower, while Liu haojun stayed in the living room to watch TV.

By the time Fang Chenchen came out, Liu haojun, who had already taken a small pill, was already waiting anxiously. He went up impatiently and tore the bathrobe Fang Chenchen had just put on. Then, he started to put on a sexy battle in the living room.

Xu Yougang was a little worried that Liu haojun’s combat power was too weak and that he would stop before Liu Dong and Liu Da “arrived at the battlefield.” Therefore, the pace of this segment was very tight. He asked them to wait on the 17th floor first, then rush to the 19th floor in one go.

From the 17th floor to the 19th floor, he was delayed for one or two minutes by opening the door. The whole process didn’t take long, and Liu haojun had taken medicine in advance, so he didn’t miss the ball.

When Liu Dong and the others rushed in, Fang Chenchen was standing in front of the sofa with both hands on the coffee table, and Liu haojun was standing behind her ...

The apartment was very large, and the living room and the entrance door were quite far apart. In addition, the two of them were in the middle of a passionate night, so the faint sound of the fingerprint lock unlocking did not alarm them.

It was not until a group of people rushed into the house that Fang Chenchen, who was facing the direction of the entrance, suddenly woke up. The first thing she saw was Liu Dong’s ashen face.

Fang Chenchen was stunned. Then, she let out an earth – shattering scream, and her face turned pale.

Liu haojun was so scared that he almost went limp on the spot. He never dreamed that someone would break into his house. This was the West Lake Mansion with strict security! Moreover, in the eyes of a third generation like him, the remote Southeast province was just a rural area. Who would have the guts to do so?

Liu haojun and Fang Chenchen separated pathetically. Fang Chenchen’s legs were already weak from Liu haojun’s impact earlier, and now that she had been given a shock, she fell to the ground. Fortunately, the carpet was soft, so she was not injured.
