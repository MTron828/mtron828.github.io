2452 Refined Qi level 9 (1)

Translator: 5496903Hearing this, Song Wei revealed a trace of joy and said happily, “That’s great! Ruofei, we should continue to cultivate! Why did you suddenly stop?”

Xia ruofei scratched his head and said,”I feel that the” absolute beginning Scripture “is not enough to break through the bottleneck of my cultivation. Once I break through, my state may not be stable. I’m worried that the process of breaking through will affect you. So ...”

Song Wei was a little down and said,””It’s all because my cultivation level is too low. Not only can I not help you, but I might even cause more trouble ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”silly!” Do you know how difficult it is to go from refined Qi level 8 to refined Qi level 9? My cultivation has long reached the peak of refined Qi level 8, but it’s just a paper window that I can’t break through no matter how much I cultivate. I didn’t expect that after only cultivating with you for a few hours today, that bottleneck actually began to loosen! You call this not being able to help me! You’ve been a great help to me!”

Song Wei’s worry turned into joy. She opened her eyes wide and said,”Really?”

Her lips curled up into a beautiful arc, and her heart was filled with joy.

Xia ruofei touched Song Wei’s hair affectionately and said,””Of course it is! Wei Wei, you’re definitely going to bring fortune to your husband! Otherwise, why would I immediately see the hope of breaking through the moment I started cultivating with you?”

Song Wei blushed and said, “You’re full of nonsense ...”

Xia ruofei laughed and then said seriously,””Wei Wei, I’m going to use the time formation to cultivate in seclusion and try to break through to refined Qi level 9 in one go!” He said.

The smart Song Wei immediately said,””Cultivate in peace. I’ll stand guard outside and ... Protect you!” Zhang xuan said.

Xia ruofei hugged Song Wei gently and said,””Thank you for your hard work! I estimate that the breakthrough process should not take too long. We can continue to cultivate later! If I break through to refined Qi level 9, our cultivation efficiency will definitely be much higher. You’re also close to refined Qi Level 4, so try to achieve a breakthrough in this cultivation!”

Song Wei nodded her head and said,”Mm! Then hurry up and cultivate! I’ll be going out first ...”

Xia ruofei and Song Wei walked out of the time formation.

Although the two of them had been cultivating in the array for a few hours, only two to three minutes had passed in the outside world.

Song Wei picked up a book from the shelf beside her and smiled at Xia ruofei. “I’ll read a book at the door for a while. You can cultivate in peace! No one will come and disturb you!”

“En!”

Xia ruofei walked Song Wei to the door, then returned to the house and locked the door.

He took back the time formation flag and walked into the bedroom. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The process of breaking through would consume a lot of spiritual Qi. Xia ruofei would not waste his crystals at this time, so he had planned to cultivate in the spirit map space from the beginning.

Furthermore, with the effects of the time array flag and the Archean realm stacked, time could flow 2000 times faster. This way, even if the process of breaking through took longer, Song Wei wouldn’t have to wait too long.

Xia ruofei locked the bedroom door and summoned the spirit map scroll from his palm. He casually stuffed it under his blanket and entered the spirit map space, where he was at the primal level.

He went directly to the open space in front of the Linglong tower.

Liu chengfeng was sitting cross – legged and cultivating. The batch of living supplies he had with him had already consumed some of them. A day had passed in the outside world, but Liu chengfeng had been cultivating here for a month.

Because of the soul seal, Liu chengfeng immediately sensed Xia ruofei’s presence the moment he entered the space. He immediately stopped his cultivation and opened his eyes.

Seeing Xia ruofei standing not far from him, Liu chengfeng quickly stood up and bowed to Xia ruofei. He called out respectfully,””Good day, master!”

Xia ruofei waved his hand.”I’m also here to cultivate. Don’t worry about me. Continue cultivating!”

“Yes! Master!” Liu chengfeng replied.

There was an empty space around the Linglong tower. Xia ruofei walked to the other side and threw out the time array flags. The array was set up in an instant.

Then, he walked into the formation space and sat down cross – legged to calm his mind. He began to circulate the first level of the “great Dao chant” cultivation technique. The entire Qi refining stage was actually cultivating the first level of the great Dao chant cultivation technique.

The majestic genuine Qi surged in Xia ruofei’s meridians and quickly circulated according to the circulation route of the first level of the great Dao formula. Traces of spiritual Qi were absorbed into Xia ruofei’s body at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. After passing through his dantian, they were transformed into genuine Qi.

In fact, Xia ruofei’s dantian was almost full. However, after each circulation, the genuine Qi in his dantian would become more solid.

Xia ruofei circulated the “great Dao technique” over and over again, without any distracting thoughts.

Once he entered the state of cultivation, Xia ruofei would not think about anything else. Even if he was about to have a breakthrough in his cultivation, his heart was still very calm. The only thought in his mind was to control his genuine Qi and continuously circulate it in his meridians according to the “great Dao technique”.

The genuine Qi in his dantian became more and more solid. Xia ruofei even felt a swelling sensation. This was a feeling that would only occur when the genuine Qi had been condensed to the extreme.

There was a limit to the compression of true energy, and this was related to one’s cultivation realm.

In other words, within the realm of refined Qi level 8, his dantian’s capacity limit was more or less this. If he wanted to continue to improve, he had to break through to refined Qi level 9.
