Translator: 5496903If it wasn’t for the cooperation of Wang Jian, the corporate legal person and the head of the company, during the handover process, Wang Jian would not have been able to escape the fate of being fired.

Wang Jian also felt very aggrieved. It was Liu Lifang who gave the order. As a high – ranking employee who could only be regarded as an outer member of the Liu family, how could he dare to disobey the order? Later, when a problem occurred, he could only take the blame. He didn’t even have a place to explain.

The Liu family became well – behaved after Xia ruofei’s words, but Wang Jian had to face Xia ruofei directly. He was indeed in a difficult situation.

“Mr. Wang, you’re too serious,” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

With that, Xia ruofei nodded at Dong Yun and walked in. As he walked, he nodded at the staff who had welcomed him.

Most of the people who came to welcome Xia ruofei were employees of paradise Corporation, and a few were sent by the song family to support him. Only Wang Jian and the former director of the General Manager Office, Lu Weifeng, came to welcome Xia ruofei.

In fact, Wang Jian’s current status was very awkward. The entire Pharmaceutical Group had been given to paradise Corporation, and all the transfer of debts and debts had been settled. Therefore, paradise Corporation was the owner of this place now, and they were outsiders.

However, Wang Jian had no choice. As the spokesperson of the Liu family in the pharmaceutical Group, he couldn’t just run away without a word! It didn’t make sense in terms of etiquette.

Hence, even though he could imagine that Xia ruofei would not give him a good look, he still had to brace himself and come over to welcome him.

Xia ruofei’s cold attitude was within Wang Jian’s expectations. He was even a little glad that Xia ruofei did not give him a harsh scolding as soon as he got out of the car. If that were the case, he could only accept it and did not even dare to express his dissatisfaction.

Xia ruofei walked straight in, and Xue Jinshan quickly led the way.

Dong Yun ordered the chauffeur to put Xia ruofei’s luggage into the suite that had been prepared and quickly followed behind.

“Chairman, what’s the next arrangement?” Dong Yun asked,”do you want to go back to your room and rest?”

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,”let’s find a meeting room!” I’d better meet the staff who will be taking over the team first!”

“Yes, Chairman!” Dong Yun said.

After she finished speaking, she gave her assistant a look. The assistant nodded in understanding and quickly ran to the second floor of the guest house.

In fact, Dong Yun was already prepared. Everything was ready in the meeting room. She just asked her assistant to quickly check in advance to see if there were any mistakes.

Xia ruofei’s group quickly arrived on the second floor. Behind Xia ruofei were the staff who were taking over the team, as well as Wang Jian and Lu Weifeng, who looked embarrassed.

Arriving at the spotless conference room, Xia ruofei walked straight to the middle of the long conference table and sat down. Then, he smiled and gestured for everyone to lower their hands.””Find your own seats and sit down!”

The employees filed in, including a few people from the song family, Wang Jian, and Lu Weifeng. However, Wang Jian and Lu Weifeng both chose seats at the back. After sitting down, they drooped their heads, trying to keep a low profile.

In contrast, although the employees of paradise company more or less had a trace of fatigue on their faces, at the same time, everyone’s face was brimming with the pride and joy of success.

After everyone sat down, Dong Yun, who was sitting on the right side of Xia ruofei, leaned over and asked softly,””Chairman, shall we start?”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,””Let’s begin! I won’t say much. Everyone, please report what you are responsible for and focus on the main points!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun said. Then, she sat up straight, cleared her throat, and said,”everyone, stop talking! Let’s have a meeting! Today, the chairman flew from Beijing to Qiantang to check on everyone’s in – Progress results. He will give instructions later, so let’s all report on the work that we’re responsible for. ”

Dong Yun was in charge of the handover team, but she was also divided into several teams. One of them was a Financial Review team made up of mainly financial staff, who were responsible for reviewing the pharmaceutical group’s accounts and other matters involving money transactions. There was also a professional technical group. Their job was to inspect the pharmaceutical group’s existing machinery and equipment, test technical indicators, and register.

In addition, there were some administrative teams, logistics teams, and so on. In short, everyone had a clear division of labor and each had their own role.

Every small team also had a corresponding person – in – charge, and today, it was mainly these people – in – charge who came to report.

Everyone had been fighting for so many days, especially since the people in charge had led a team to fight, so they were very familiar with the situation. In addition, they had made some preparations last night, so everyone’s report was very smooth.

Besides, everyone understood Xia ruofei’s style, so there were no empty words when he reported. He used all kinds of data as support and could be said to be full of solid information.

After all the leaders of the small team, including Xue Jinshan, had finished their reports, Dong Yun gave a brief report on the overall work. It was mainly a summary and supplement to the previous leaders ‘reports.

Xia ruofei listened attentively. He was much friendlier to his employees. He always had a smile on his face, giving people a feeling that he was easy to approach.

Dong Yun had already given a simple report on the way here, so she did not read it from the script. The content of the report was also more concise.

“That’s the general situation, Chairman,”said Dong Yun. As of today, we can already announce that the acquisition of the pharmaceutical Group has been completed, and the pharmaceutical Group is now under our complete control. ”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”very good!” I’ll seriously consider the questions you’ve raised, including the employment of the original workers and management, and give you a clear answer in the shortest time possible!”

“Alright!” Dong Yun said.

Then, Dong Yun looked around and said,”Next, let’s welcome the Chairman’s instructions with a warm round of applause!”

Thunderous applause suddenly rang out in the conference room. Although there were not many people, everyone was clapping with all their might, so it sounded quite loud.

With a smile on his face, Xia ruofei gestured for the crowd to lower their hands. The applause in the meeting room gradually died down.

Xia ruofei said,”everyone, including the brothers from the song family who have come to help us, thank you for your hard work!”

“After listening to everyone’s report, I feel that you have done a good job during your time at Qiantang. Everyone has a strong sense of responsibility and a sense of ownership. You have completed this complicated and difficult task very well!” Xia ruofei said,”if there’s a weakness ... It’s that everyone works too hard and doesn’t pay attention to their bodies. Especially Xue Jinshan, as a middle – ranking leader, he didn’t lead everyone well and instead took the lead to exhaust his body! I’m here to criticize you!”

The meeting room burst into laughter. Xue Jinshan quickly said,”Chairman, I’ll humbly accept the criticism and will firmly correct it in the future!”

Even though Xia ruofei said that he was criticizing Xue Jinshan, he was not really dissatisfied. He smiled and said,”The work is done, and it was done very well and perfectly! Our paradise Corporation has always been fair in reward and punishment. This time, we will give recognition and rewards to everyone’s hard work! I’ve already instructed the finance department to give everyone a special bonus. I won’t say the exact amount, but you’ll know when you see the salary slip in the middle of the month!”

“That’s great! Long live the chairman!”

“Thank you, Mr. Chairman! Hahaha ...” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The employees knew Xia ruofei’s personality and knew that he was always generous. So even if he kept them in suspense, they knew that the bonus would not be small!

Xia ruofei pressed his hands down and said,””Don’t get so excited, I’m not done yet! Just a little bonus and you’re already so happy, look at you guys!”

After Xia ruofei finished speaking, the crowd burst into laughter.

“Chairman, are there other rewards?” a bold employee asked.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said,”not only will there be rewards, but the rewards will also let everyone feel the value of their efforts! This time, the company will arrange for all the employees to travel to Spain. All the expenses will be covered by the company! However, considering that there is still some follow – up work at the pharmaceutical Group, we may have to split into two or three groups!”
