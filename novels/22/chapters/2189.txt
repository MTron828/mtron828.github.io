2190 A small internet celebrity (2)

She personally brought Xia ruofei around the house, telling him what the design for this place was and what the purpose of that place was. When it came to happy things, she was like a child.

Xia ruofei had a smile on his face as he followed Feng Jing around.

After they were done, the two of them left Feng Jing’s townhouse. Xia ruofei stood at the door and said,””Sister che, come to my house for a visit!”

“It’s so late, I don’t think it’s convenient,”Feng Rao said after some hesitation. I think I’ll go back to the company ...”

Feng Jing didn’t plan on going back to the farm that day. Her office was a large suite with a comfortable bedroom and all the necessary living facilities. It was more convenient to work at the company.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”what’s so inconvenient about that?” Why don’t you just stay at my place today?”

“Ah?” Feng Rao couldn’t help but call out, her heart beating wildly.

Xia ruofei chuckled,”sister ran, don’t get the wrong idea!” I have a lot of rooms at my place, so why don’t you just stay the night at my place? I’m going to the company tomorrow anyway, so let’s just go in the same car ...”

Then, Xia ruofei looked at Feng Jing and asked with a smile,””Sister ran, are you afraid?”

Feng Jing was actually very moved by Xia ruofei’s suggestion. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, she pretended to be unconvinced and snorted,””Who’s afraid! I’ll go ...” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After saying this, Feng Rao felt a little regretful.

She knew that Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue loved each other very much, and Ling Qingxue also lived in this community, which was not far from Xia ruofei’s house. If Ling Qingxue saw them, there might be a misunderstanding.

Xia ruofei did not wait for Feng Rao to return and said with a smile,””Then let’s go! I happen to have some good tea at my place. Let’s make a pot of tea and chat. You can also tell me about the company’s recent situation!”

Feng Jing comforted herself in her heart,’I’m just reporting to ruofei about work at the company, I didn’t mean to stay at his place ...’

Xia ruofei brought Feng Jing back to his villa. He turned on the light in the living room and smiled.”Sister che, there are new slippers in the shoe cabinet. You can wear whatever you want!”

After that, he put on his shoes and went into the house. He found a box of tea leaves in the small refrigerator next to the root – carved coffee table in the living room and began to boil water to make tea.

Feng Rao walked over after changing her shoes. She sat down opposite Xia ruofei and smiled.”Ruofei, this is what you call a villa! My place is like a tube – shaped apartment when compared to yours ...”

“Sister che,” Xia ruofei said with a smile,”as long as you continue to work in our company, I promise you that you’ll be able to afford a villa like this in less than three years!”

“I believe this!” Feng Rao said with a smile.

The two of them chatted for a while, and soon the water in the pot was boiling. Xia ruofei used a wooden spoon to scoop some tea leaves into the purple clay pot and then quickly began to make tea.

“Have a taste of this Da Hong Pao!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is much better than the tea that our company sells in bulk!”

“So the chairman has all the good stuff hidden away!” Feng Rao teased.

“You can take it with you when you leave tomorrow!” Xia ruofei said forthrightly,”you can ask me for more after you’re done with this box! You’re my most capable subordinate, if I can’t even supply a little tea, how can I?”

“Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t. A gentleman doesn’t take away what others like!” Feng Rao chuckled. Besides, I don’t have the habit of drinking tea ... If you really want to give it to me! You might as well give me a few boxes of jaded skin cream!”

Feng Jing was not referring to the company’s mass sales of the jaded skin cream. She wanted the handmade jaded skin cream made by Xia ruofei.

Feng Jing had experienced the effects of the jaded skin cream. Although the effects of the jaded skin cream produced by the company were quite amazing, nothing was better than comparison. The jaded skin cream sold in the market and the jaded skin cream made by Xia ruofei were on completely different levels.

“No problem! I’ll personally make some for you when I have the time!” Xia ruofei agreed without a second thought.

“The chairman is so generous!” Feng Rao complimented Xia ruofei happily.

The two of them chatted about the company while drinking tea.

In the ten days that Xia ruofei had been out at sea, the company had been progressing steadily under Feng Jing’s leadership.

The pharmaceutical factory and farm expansion project in Changping County were also progressing quite quickly. The sales of the Jade skin cream and heart – nourishing soup were as hot as ever.

“By the way, sister ran, how’s the goose I asked the farm to try?” Xia ruofei asked.

Feng Rao had specifically asked about the situation with the Strasburg geese on the farm because she knew that Xia ruofei had personally assigned this task and he must have been very concerned about it.

Hence, Feng Rao immediately smiled and said,””Ruofei, how are the six Strasburg geese? It’s taken care of very well every day, and it’s growing very healthily!”

Feng Jing couldn’t help but add,””You don’t know, do you? These geese are now internet celebrities!”

“Ah? A little internet celebrity?” Xia ruofei was also confused. He couldn’t help but ask,”what’s the situation?”

“Wait! “I’ll look for it ...” Feng Jing took out her phone and started looking for it. “Take a look for yourself later!”

“I found it!” Feng Rao said after a while.

Then, she handed the phone to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei took it and saw that it was the popular TikTok Short Video app. It opened a user interface and showed that this user had more than 10000 fans.

“Only 10000 fans ... It’s not that popular!” Xia ruofei muttered.

“Only? You have to know that this account has only been online for a dozen days!” Feng Jing said,”it’s already quite impressive to have over 10000 fans in just ten days!”

“So you’re saying it’s quite powerful?” Xia ruofei glanced at the username as he spoke. He muttered to himself,”this name ...’Little Wen, little six’? Why does it feel a little dirty?”

Feng Rao’s face turned red. She glared at Xia ruofei and said,””What nonsense is this? This is the account of the new caretaker on the farm who is in charge of taking care of these six geese. Isn’t his nickname Xiao liuzi?”

As Feng Rao said this, she thought to herself,”This little six, of all the names he could have given himself, why did he have to give himself such a name ... When this account becomes popular in the future, this ID will be a major flaw!

Xia ruofei was also a little embarrassed. He chuckled and scratched his head. “Let’s see what videos he posted. ”

His finger gently swiped across the screen, and he saw that Xiao liuzi had actually sent dozens of videos in the past ten days, with an average of several videos a day.

These videos were all about the Strasburg geese. Xia ruofei clicked on one and was attracted by the charmingly na?ve geese. The environment of the goose pen was also very beautiful. The green Goose House, the clear pond, the green grass ... It was completely different from the impression that people had of the place that was filled with goose manure and mud.

In addition, it was obvious that the Strasburg geese had been taken care of quite well. Each of them was clean without a trace of stain, and their fur was smooth and shiny. It was hard not to like them when they swayed as they walked.

Feng Rao looked at it and said with a smile,”This is the video that was released at the beginning. Because we don’t have enough fans, it’s relatively short. You can take a look at the videos that were released in the past few days ...”

Hence, Xia ruofei clicked on a few more videos and realized that Xiao liuzi had his own ideas. The angle of the video was very particular, and the content was rich and diverse. Some of the videos showed him bathing and brushing the feathers of the little geese, some captured the various silly behaviors of the little geese, and some captured them eating.

Xia ruofei realized that each goose had their own designated food bowl. They would eat in their own food bowl in an orderly manner and never fight for the food beside them. The six Strasburg geese were lined up in a neat row. They lowered their heads and ate with relish, which was inexplicably funny.

“This little six is not bad! That’s a good idea!” Xia ruofei said,”sister ran, tell the farm to make him a regular employee in advance!”

“I think it’s fine!” Feng Rao smiled and said,”this young man is a talent!”

Xia ruofei chatted with Feng Jing while watching Xiao liuzi’s video. Feng Jing came over to watch it as well. When they saw the funny scene, they were both overjoyed.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door of the villa, followed by the sound of footsteps ...
