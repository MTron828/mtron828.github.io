2768 Reunion after a short separation (2)

These dishes were more than enough for two people to eat.

It had been a long time since Ling Qingxue had a taste of Xia ruofei’s cooking. She enjoyed the meal and praised Xia ruofei’s cooking skills as she ate.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”eat slowly!” It’s just the two of us today, no one’s snatching your food!”

Ling Qingxue took a sip of the rib soup, then raised her head and said,””Tell me! Now that you’ve been away for so many days, don’t tell me you’ve found me and Wei Wei a good sister again?”

Xia ruofei looked embarrassed and said,””Look at you ... I’m not that kind of person, okay?”

Xia ruofei didn’t want Ling Qingxue to continue this topic, so he immediately said,””Speaking of which, the harvest this time was really not small! Qingxue, are you busy at the company? Can I take a few days off? I want to take you to a place!”

Ling Qingxue thought for a moment and said,”of course I’m busy every day, but my dad’s here!” He’s just lazy, so he wants to retire earlier. If I really need to take leave, he can take care of it himself!”

“Alright! Then I’ll take ten days off first!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll take you to a good place!”

“What is this place? He’s worthy of your praise!” Ling Qingxue asked curiously.

“This is a secret for now!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”but I can tell you a little. This place is called a cultivator’s heaven!”

The place that Xia ruofei wanted to bring Ling Qingxue to was naturally Paradise Island.

With the continuous operation of the Taixu xuanqing formation, the cultivation environment and the concentration of spiritual energy on the Paradise Island would be much better than the outside world. The entire Island itself was a priceless cultivation resource. Ling Qingxue also needed to absorb a large amount of spiritual energy for her cultivation. Although she could absorb the spiritual energy from spirit crystals or even origin crystals, it would be even better if she could cultivate on the peach source Island.

If there was still spiritual energy on earth, then the spiritual energy inside the Paradise Island was almost inexhaustible.

“In that case, it has something to do with cultivation?” Ling Qingxue’s eyes brightened, and her interest was piqued.

However, she changed her mind and asked,””Then, will Wei Wei go?”

“You want her to go with you?” Xia ruofei was slightly stunned.

Ling Qingxue rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei and said coyly,””Aren’t you just asking the obvious? If we’re going, I’ll definitely be going with her! Otherwise, how am I going to explain it to her if she finds out?”

Xia ruofei thought for a moment and said,”of course, I can bring her along!” It was originally prepared for you. But I don’t know if she’ll be able to leave, or if she’ll have to go to classes or take exams. ”

Song Wei was still a graduate student. Xia ruofei was not sure if taking a long leave would affect her studies.

“She’s a graduate student, big brother!”Ling Qingxue said. Now, even undergraduate students could take a few days off, and graduate students had more freedom! If you don’t believe me, I’ll give her a call right now and we’ll get this done today!”

Without waiting for Xia ruofei to reply, Ling Qingxue took out her phone and dialed Song Wei’s number.

Xia ruofei saw that Ling Qingxue had directly found the number in her call history and dialed it.

‘It seems like the two of them have been in contact ...’ Xia ruofei thought to himself.

Ling Qingxue’s call had already connected.

Ling Qingxue had a sweet smile on her face as she said,””Weiwei, it’s Qingxue ... I want to ask you something! RUO Fei wants to take us to a place, and he asked me to ask you if it’s convenient for you to take a leave of absence these days ... It’ll probably take ten days to half a month ... No problem? That’s great! Go and take a leave of absence now! This matter is settled!”

Ling Qingxue ended the call in a few words. She put away her phone and smiled smugly.””How is it? Done!”

Xia ruofei shrugged and said,”no problem!” I’ll take you two with me!”

At this point, Xia ruofei pondered for a while and said,””How about this, tomorrow ... The day after tomorrow! I have something to do in Beijing, so we’ll go there directly after I’m done!”

“I have no problem with that!” Ling Qingxue said,”I’ll ask my dad in the afternoon to take ten days to half a month’s leave to relax ...”

“Then it’s settled!” Xia ruofei said.

His return to the three mountains this time was mainly for the matter of the Veterans. In addition, he also wanted to take a look at the Paradise company. After settling his matters, he could go to Beijing.

After they were done discussing the leave, Xia ruofei smiled at Ling Qingxue and said,””Wife, how’s your cultivation going? Although I can’t practice the absolute beginning Heart Sutra together, I can’t slack off in my daily cultivation! If you don’t advance, you’ll fall back!”

Ling Qingxue said,”I’ve been persevering every day!” However, it’s true that that set of cultivation technique is only suitable for joint training. The efficiency of one person’s training is really too low. ”

“We can practice together today!” Xia ruofei said. He sized Ling Qingxue up and smiled evilly.”But before that, I have to check if your cultivation has improved!”

After he finished speaking, Ling Qingxue screamed in shock as Xia ruofei lifted her up by the waist and walked towards the stairs, heading straight for the master bedroom on the second floor ...

It was two hours later when the two of them really started cultivating.

When the two of them cultivated the absolute beginning Heart Sutra, they also had to be in close contact, and it was a direct contact on the soul level. The feeling was many times stronger than having sex in reality. After all, when they cultivated, they had no other thoughts, and in fact, they didn’t have many thoughts in that aspect.

Very quickly, Xia ruofei had set up the array flags. Ling Qingxue had also put on her clothes. The two of them walked into the range of the array flags and began to cultivate the absolute beginning Heart Sutra after some slight adjustments.

The two of them had been cultivating in the array for almost a whole day. Of course, because of the difference in the flow of time, only about ten minutes had passed in the outside world.

After Xia ruofei’s breakthrough in cultivation, Ling Qingxue had practiced the absolute beginning heart scroll with him. The benefits she had gained were even greater. After a whole day of cultivation, her cultivation had improved by a large margin.

Xia ruofei did gain something. On the contrary, Xia ruofei realized that cultivating the absolute beginning Heart Sutra could also promote the transformation of genuine Qi into Yuan Qi, and the transformation efficiency was not low.

After a day of cultivation, about 10% of his genuine Qi had been converted into Yuan Qi. Now, Xia ruofei’s dantian had about 40% Yuan Qi. The remaining 60% was still genuine Qi. He needed to continue working hard.

Of course, the longer the cultivation time, the better it was. Otherwise, he would simply cultivate for a few days and nights without rest, and he could successfully complete the process of true Qi transformation. In fact, excessive training would not only reduce the efficiency, but it could also bring some danger.

Therefore, the two of them stopped after a day.

It was already three or fouro’ clock in the afternoon. There was no point for Ling Qingxue to go to the office anymore, so she gave Ling Xiaotian a call and told him that Xia ruofei was back and that she would not be going to the office in the afternoon. She also told Ling Xiaotian that she would be taking a period of leave. Of course, the reason was made up. She said that she was going on a trip abroad.

When Ling Xiaotian heard that his daughter was going on a trip with Xia ruofei, he agreed happily without a second thought. He even urged Ling Qingxue to spend more time outside so that she would not have to worry about the company.

Xia ruofei had wanted to go to his company in the afternoon, but it was obvious that he could not make it in time, so he decided to go tomorrow.

The two of them strolled along the min River until the sun was setting. Then, they returned to the villa hand in hand. Xia ruofei was still the one who cooked. They made a sumptuous dinner and opened a bottle of half – Lon.

After the meal, Ling Qingxue was still a little shy and felt embarrassed to stay the night. Besides, she had to go back to pack her luggage, so she went home after chatting with Xia ruofei for a while.

Xia ruofei had already cultivated in the afternoon, so he did not cultivate at night. After a shower, he went to bed early. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The next morning, Xia ruofei drove the Knight XV SUV towards the headquarters of the Paradise Corporation.
