Chapter 1662: Ten seconds of shock (1)

Captain Brook was stunned. He stared at Xia ruofei and asked,””You ... How did you know? Don’t tell me ...”

Xia ruofei said,”I don’t know any Wilkinson. It’s just that my hearing is better. Besides, my seat is closer to yours. That’s why I heard everything!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Only then did Captain Brook feel a little more at ease. What he was most worried about was that Wilkins had other accomplices on board.

Of course, he felt that the possibility of this was not high. After all, Wilkinson was about to commit suicide in a plane. How could there be so many people who would not care about their lives? Moreover, from the way Wilkinson operated, he did not need the cooperation of an accomplice at all. At least for now, it was a dead end, and there was nothing he could do.

Therefore, Captain Brook accepted Xia ruofei’s explanation.

“Sir, since you’ve heard it, please keep it a secret to avoid causing panic among the passengers!” Captain Brook said seriously,”also, please return to your seat immediately! Don’t interfere with us breaking the door!”

Xia ruofei shook his head and said,”no!” I think you guys really need help. If this continues, I’m afraid you won’t be able to open the cockpit door even if the plane crashes into the sea!”

“Do you have an idea?” asked Brook with a frown.

Xia ruofei smiled and walked up to the air Policeman.”Please let me use the axe!”

Out of professional sensitivity, the air traffic police subconsciously retracted his hand and made a defensive posture. He did not hand the axe to Xia ruofei.

Captain Brook was also hesitating because he didn’t think that this thin Easterner could open the solid cockpit door.

However, Xia ruofei did not give them any time to think. He stepped forward after saying that.

The air traffic police only felt a flash in front of his eyes, and then his hand felt lighter. He was shocked to find that the axe in his hand was already in Xia ruofei’s hand.

“Please step back!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Captain Brook motioned for everyone to make way. This was a last resort. Normally, it was impossible to let the explosion – proof axe fall into the hands of passengers.

Xia ruofei raised the axe with both hands and hacked at the cockpit door. However, he was not as strong as the air Marshal, be it in terms of physical strength or momentum.

Brook muttered in his heart,”I must be crazy to actually have a glimmer of hope in this Chinese man ...

However, the next moment made him dumbfounded.

Xia ruofei’s axe seemed to have not used much strength, but the cockpit door, which was made of solid alloy, had an obvious dent. At the bottom of the dent, there was even a small crack ...

“God ...” Captain Brook and the air Marshal muttered to themselves at the same time.

The flight crew’s hearts were filled with hope.

If they could break the cockpit door, there was a high chance of saving the plane! After all, there was only Wilkinson in the cockpit.

Xia ruofei was a little depressed. He thought that the cockpit door would open when he swung the axe because he had used all his strength in the seemingly casual swing. He had even infused his genuine Qi into the axe. Even a thick steel plate would be split open by him.

However, it seemed that he had underestimated the sturdiness of the cockpit door.

However, Xia ruofei did not hesitate. He raised his axe again.

Buzzzzzz!

This time, the dent on the hatch became more obvious, and the crack also expanded, revealing the internal metal structure of the hatch.

“That’s the hatch lock!” The sharp – eyed Captain Brook said,”Sir, please cut the lock!”

Xia ruofei turned around and made an ‘OK’ gesture. He took a deep breath and raised his axe again.

Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!

Xia ruofei slashed three times in a row, each time landing on the same spot.

The thick alloy lock also cracked, but it still stubbornly locked the cockpit door.

Xia ruofei went up to check and turned back.””Everyone, step back!”

Then, Xia ruofei also took five or six steps back, almost to the curtain of the first – Class cabin. As for Captain Brook and the others, they had already retreated to the kitchen in the front cabin. They stuck their heads out and looked at Xia ruofei nervously.

Xia ruofei threw the axe aside and rushed towards the cockpit. He picked up his speed in just a few steps. When he reached the cockpit door, he turned his body and concentrated all his Qi on the back of his right shoulder. Then, he used the momentum and slammed into the cockpit door like a traditional martial arts technique.

With a muffled bang, the unforgettable scene for Captain Brook and the rest of the crew was that Xia ruofei had slammed open the door of the Pi Xiu’s cockpit!

They had seen it clearly just now. Although the alloy lock had cracks, it was far from being broken. Besides, the cockpit door was facing outwards. Xia ruofei had actually slammed the door inwards at an angle, which meant that the other side of the strong hinge had been damaged by the crash!

Brook was the first to come back to his senses. He took the lead and rushed forward.

Xia ruofei saw that the hatch had not fallen and was slightly stunned. At this moment, Captain Brook had already rushed over and pulled the hatch in the opposite direction. As expected, the hatch opened easily.
