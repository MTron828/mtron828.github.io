3228 A dangerous disease (1)

Li Yifu finally understood Xia ruofei’s real intention.

He felt even more ashamed because the first thing that came to his mind was that Xia ruofei wanted to use the child of Elon Musk to threaten the other party. From the looks of it, it seemed that he had a dark heart!

Chen Xuan and the rest did not participate in the discussion. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Chen Xuan could not help but say,””Brother Xia, wouldn’t this be too troublesome? After all, we don’t know what’s going on with the child!”

Yu Xin ‘er also agreed. She said,””I think sect leader Chen is right. And if even a super – rich man like masker can’t cure his child, I’m afraid we’ll also ...”

Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue looked at each other and smiled.

Then, Xia ruofei said,”brother Chen, miss Xin ‘er, I have some confidence in my medical skills!” No matter what the problem is with this new son of Elon Musk, I should be able to cure him. If even a super – rich man like him was helpless, wasn’t that great? It meant that this health problem was very serious, and money couldn’t solve it! If we can help him solve this problem, then this favor will be even more important!”

Ling Qingxue also chimed in,”that makes sense!” Being rich wasn’t omnipotent! Gang leader Qiao was so rich, he would still die if he had to die. The more serious the condition of masker’s child, the better!”

At this point, Ling Qingxue also felt that her words were a little inappropriate, so she quickly explained,””I ... What I mean is, the child’s condition is already like this. If even masker’s money can’t save his child’s life, then if Fei were to save him, this favor would be even more precious, right?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xia ruofei chuckled,”that’s what I meant.” Brother Chen, miss Xin ‘er, if we use the methods of cultivators, we can indeed force masker to produce spacesuits for us. However, using such a method to deal with ordinary people would not reveal his face, right? Besides, something like this has happened to his family, and we’re still forcing him. It’s a little too unreasonable. ”

Cultivators were also human beings, and they could not avoid having seven emotions and six desires. This was especially so for female cultivators like Yu xiner. She had grown up in the secular world and received the traditional education of the secular world. She had only entered the flying flower Valley to cultivate after she had grown up, so she resonated with Xia ruofei’s words.

She nodded in agreement and said,””If his child is really dangerous, it’s not appropriate for us to deal with him now ...”

Chen Xuan laughed bitterly.”I’m not insistent on using force to deal with this man. It’s just that I didn’t know how good brother Xia’s medical skills were. Since you’re so confident, it’s better to use a gentler method. I have no objections.”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I think soft tactics are always better than high – handed tactics. If Musk is willing to cooperate with us, we can be more at ease. After all, we’re the ones using the spacesuits. If something were to happen to the production process, we’ll be the ones at a disadvantage. ”

“I agree!” Chen Xuan nodded. Then let’s follow brother Xia’s method and try it out!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”adopted husband, hurry up and get someone to find out what’s the situation with masker’s son.”

In fact, no matter what kind of illness masker’s son had, Xia ruofei was confident that he could use his Traditional Chinese Medicine methods and the petals of the spirit Heart Flower to treat him. However, before you go to his door to help him, you have to find a way to understand what illness he had, right? If you don’t know anything and say that you can cure your child’s illness, you’ll be treated as a quack and beaten out!

“Yes!” Li Yifu nodded. Martial granduncle, I’ll go to a few more detective agencies and try to get the exact information as soon as possible!”

“En!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”it seems like we haven’t even warmed up to our seats yet. We’ll have to move to Los Angeles again!”

“Grand uncle – Master, I’ll go arrange the plane ...” Li Yifu said hurriedly.

“No need,” Xia ruofei waved his hand.”We’ll take the airboat there directly!”

“Yes! “Grand uncle – Master, I’ll make some arrangements first ...” Li Yifu said.

“I’m not in a hurry ...”Xia ruofei nodded.

Xia ruofei looked at the time and said,””It takes time to gather information. It’s already evening, so why don’t we stay here for the night and set off tomorrow morning? Everyone, take a good rest in your rooms! Just take it as recuperating! Of course, it’s fine if you want to go out. After all, we don’t come to the US territory often ...”

“Then we’ll head back to our room first!” Chen Xuan said with a smile as he stood up. Old man, I’ll have to trouble you with the matters here!”

Chen Xuan was speaking to Li Yifu. After all, Li Yifu was an old man. It wasn’t appropriate for Chen Xuan to address an old man with white hair and a white beard by his name. However, Li Yifu’s cultivation level and seniority were both very low. Chen Xuan could not possibly address him as ‘senior’. Hence, he could only use a more neutral term, elder Xuanji.

Li Yifu quickly said,”young sect leader Chen, you’re too kind. It’s my duty to serve Grand – martial uncle. I don’t dare to say that it’s hard!” Please go back to your rooms to rest. I have already arranged a banquet, so please be sure to come!”
