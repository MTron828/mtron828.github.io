Translator: 549690339

Tian Xiaojun quickly nodded his head like a chicken pecking at rice and said,”Yes, yes, yes, young master Zhao. I’m Tian Xiaojun.”

Zhao Yong Jun and the others didn’t say anything. Although Tian Xiao Jun’s legs were numb, he didn’t dare to stand up.

Zhao Yong Jun looked at the embarrassed Tian Xiao Jun and said,”I heard that you’re quite bold! You even dare to take the company shares of my brother, Zhao Yongjun ...”

Tian Xiaojun’s body trembled as he quickly replied,”Young master Zhao, we were blinded by greed and failed to recognize your greatness ... I ... I really didn’t know that Xia ... Young master Xia was your brother!”

“If RUO Fei isn’t our brother, then you can openly snatch his company’s shares?” Zhao Yongjun’s eyes narrowed.”It seems like we’ve done this before!”

“No, no, no... I wouldn’t dare ...” Tian Xiaojun said anxiously,”this is the first time ...”

If it was someone else, Tian Xiaojun might have tried to defend himself, saying that he had misestimated the value of paradise Corporation. However, in front of the famous Zhao Yongjun, he didn’t even dare to mention such a weak excuse and admitted it.

The only thing he could do was to pray that Zhao Yongjun and the others didn’t make things too difficult for him. It was basically impossible for him to escape unscathed.

“Tell me! How are we going to solve this?” Zhao Yong Jun was calm and unruffled. He looked down at Tian Xiao Jun and asked,”you guys came all the way from the capital to try and steal my brother’s property, and even threatened him. You can’t just let this matter go, right?”

“Young master Zhao, we’re in the wrong ... We ... We’d like to apologize to young master Xia ...” Tian Xiaojun said with a long face.

“Apologize?” Zhao Yongjun pouted and said,”if an apology is useful, why do we need the police?” he said from an idol drama that was once popular on the streets.

Tian Xiaojun was stunned for a moment, then he asked weakly,”Then ... How does young master Zhao want to solve this? As long as I, Tian Xiaojun, can do it, I will not even frown!”

He could still be considered a Bachelor. Since he had already admitted defeat, then he would just draw a line! If he really couldn’t do it, then he could only do it with this hundred Jin of bones.

“Don’t talk to me about these useless things!” Zhao Yongjun scolded him,”why are you acting like you’re all high and mighty with me! When I was fighting with the people from the Naval military compound, you were still peeing in some corner!”

Liu Zhe, who was watching from the side, couldn’t help but show a trace of embarrassment. According to the time, when Zhao Yong Jun lived in the courtyard, Tian Xiaojun was most likely living in the “corner” of the San Shan mountain with his father!

Xia ruofei did not know much about Tian Xiaojun’s background. He, song Rui, Hou Liang, and the others were all watching the show with relaxed smiles on their faces.

Zhao Yong Jun was the most powerful person in their group, and he was the most suitable person to deal with Tian Xiao Jun and the others.

Tian Xiaojun was so scared by Zhao Yongjun that he was trembling all over. Zhong Zixin, who was at the side, was even worse. She pouted and started crying. The heavy makeup on her face was washed away by her tears, and her face was immediately disfigured.

Zhao Yongjun frowned and said,”what are you howling for?” People who don’t know better would think that I did something to you! I don’t have such bad taste!”

Zhong Zixin quickly stopped crying and lowered her head in shock and fear. This trip to the three mountains was like a nightmare to her.

“Alright, stand up and talk!” Xia ruofei couldn’t stand it anymore and stepped out.

Tian Xiao Jun was stunned for a moment, and subconsciously looked at Zhao Yong Jun.

“Don’t you have ears?!”Zhao Yongjun said unhappily. Didn’t you hear my brother ask you to get up? Or do you like to squat all the time?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“No, no...” Tian Xiaojun quickly replied.

Then, they immediately stood up. However, their legs were already numb after squatting for so long. They couldn’t help but stagger when they suddenly stood up.

Tian Xiaojun hurriedly held onto the courtyard wall, looking extremely disheveled.

Zhao Yongjun pouted,”ruofei, you’re too soft – hearted!” If we don’t teach them a lesson, they won’t learn from it!”

Song Rui fully supported Zhao Yongjun this time. He also said,””Yup! Ruofei, I’m doing a good deed! If they were not properly disciplined, sooner or later, they would be scammed! I think their fathers should send us a letter of thanks!”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui and said,””Do you want me to make you a silk banner?”

Song Rui smiled and said,”that’s not bad!” I’ll hang it in my office!”

“Go to hell!” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded.

Then, he walked up to Tian Xiaojun’s group of three, who were cowering, and said indifferently,”Deputy Director Tian ...”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Tian Xiaojun lowered his head and said humbly,”young master Xia, you can just call me by my name!”

Previously, in the private room in the courtyard, Xia ruofei had addressed Tian Xiaojun as “Deputy Director Tian”. Tian Xiaojun was still unhappy and thought that Xia ruofei was deliberately disrespecting him. According to the unspoken rules of the officialdom, one should at least address him as “Deputy Director Tian”. The word “Deputy” would only appear in official documents.

However, the same person, the same form of address, now made Tian Xiaojun feel like he was sitting on pins and needles, and he felt that he could not bear it.

“Tian Xiaojun, do you understand what brother Zhao just said?” Xia ruofei smiled.
