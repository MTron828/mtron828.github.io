3149 Exchange meeting (2)

Otherwise, the Paradise Club would have long been targeted by cultivators.

Therefore, Xia ruofei was not worried that Mu Sheng and the others would covet it after seeing it.

Moreover, with his current strength, it was fine to bring Mu Sheng and the others there openly. He was confident that he would have a certain deterrent force.

Of course, it was all because the benefits were too small. If the benefits were big enough, Xia ruofei would not have taken such a risk.

For example, the Peach Blossom Island and the spirit map space. At this stage, Xia ruofei would never dare to expose himself to other cultivators.

……

For the next two days, Xia ruofei, Chen Xuan, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue spent all their time in the National Library.

The four of them became a unique sight in the library.

The two beautiful ladies sat quietly beside Xia ruofei and read for the whole day.

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan flipped through the book at an extremely fast speed, and it was hard not to attract attention.

In the past two days, some people who had been reading and studying in the library were quite curious about this four – person team.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Fortunately, they had only been gone for two days. Otherwise, some busybodies might have secretly taken photos and posted them on the internet.

On the morning of the third day, Xia ruofei and the others took a car to the Paradise Club in the suburbs town of Xiaotang.

There were so many people, but they were still divided into three cars. Zhao Yongjun had arranged for two Mercedes – Benz MPVs in advance to pick them up in the courtyard in liuhai Lane early in the morning.

Of course, because of Mu Sheng and the others ‘special status, Xia ruofei also gave Zhao Yongjun a call to remind him.

Although it was unlikely that the guests he brought would be neglected, Xia ruofei was taking precautions.

Even though cultivators generally wouldn’t attack ordinary people, they couldn’t stand some people who sought death themselves. Therefore, it was necessary to give them a warning in advance.

Xia ruofei and the others left the house at Sixo’ clock. They managed to get out of the congested road before the morning rush hour. Before eighto’ clock, they had arrived at the Paradise clubhouse.

Today’s Academic Exchange was held in a detached villa in the clubhouse.

Zhao Yongjun and song Rui had been waiting in front of the villa in advance.

As soon as Xia ruofei’s car stopped, the two of them quickly came up to him.

Xia ruofei was still the driver today. When he got out of the car, Zhao Yongjun was already in front of him.

“RUO Fei!” Zhao Yongjun shouted happily,”you’ve been in Beijing for a few days. You finally have time to meet us!”

Song Rui also smiled and said,”President Xia is getting busier and busier!” It’s not easy for us idle people to meet him!”

Xia ruofei glanced at song Rui. He had not seen him for a few months and song Rui looked more mature. However, he still had that annoying mouth.

“Don’t try that, you brat!” Xia ruofei said rudely,”if you want to die, just say it. I’ll fulfill your wish when we drink tonight!”

“You think you’re good at drinking, huh?” Song Rui cried out,”I don’t believe that no one can control you ...”

Halfway through, song Rui thought of Xia ruofei’s abnormal drinking capacity and couldn’t help but say with a sad face,””It seems like no one can stop you ...”

Xia ruofei and Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

At this moment, Chen Xuan and the rest alighted from their cars and walked to Xia ruofei’s side.

“Brother Xia, this is the nine revolutions universe formation, right?” “This is interesting!” Chen Xuan exclaimed. Chapter 1720: the first Prince!

“Easy! What’s not easy?” Zhao Yongjun said readily,”I’m familiar with the leaders of these three universities, and this is an Academic Exchange, not something illegal. Who knows how many academic exchanges those experts and professors attend every year! What’s the problem with him participating in our event?”

Zhao Yongjun couldn’t help but laugh,””Hahaha! Ruofei, I suddenly thought that our Paradise Club is the most suitable host for this exchange! Look! The environment there is beautiful, the facilities are complete, the venue is ready, and we don’t have to leave the Beijing area. The time of the experts and professors is easy to coordinate. They can totally take out a day to have an exchange, and then have fun in our club, or even soak in the hot spring! I’m sure you’ll be satisfied. What do you think of my idea?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh.””Big brother Zhao, you’ve already planned this, right? Since you’ve already thought of it for me, what other opinion can I have? We’ll do as you say!”

“Alright!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and then asked,”then which day do you want to set? I’ve already spoken to the school. Any day will do. The experts and professors will definitely make time for us!”

Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,”then let’s arrange it the day after tomorrow!” How about the morning of the day after tomorrow?”

He considered spending another two days in the library. Whether he could reach the level of “knowing what he knows” or not, he had to at least make his knowledge reserve more sufficient. Otherwise, it would be too embarrassing if he showed his weakness in front of the expert professor and asked some childish questions.

“No problem!” Zhao Yongjun said readily,”then I’ll pass on the message! We’ll have a small Academic Exchange in the morning the day after tomorrow. I’ll contact the other three universities to make sure that the best experts in their fields can be there!”

“Alright! Thanks!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Don’t be so polite with me!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and said,”drink a few more glasses with me the night after tomorrow. It’s better than anything else!”

“It’s a must!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we won’t leave until we’re drunk!”

“Do you think I don’t know your alcohol tolerance? You can still get drunk? The so – called “you won’t go back until you’re drunk ...” Is that you won’t go back until I’m drunk!” Zhao Yongjun exposed Xia ruofei’s words without hesitation.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s all the same!” It was all the same! When brothers drink, it’s mainly for joy! I don’t have any intention of getting anyone drunk!”

“You said it!” Zhao Yongjun said,”if I get drunk, I’ll hold you responsible!”

Zhao Yongjun didn’t even dare to mention the standard of drinking. Even if he had to give Xia ruofei a glass and a bottle, he wasn’t confident that he could make Xia ruofei drink to the ground. So, he just used himself as the standard, which was a bit unreasonable.

Xia ruofei didn’t mind and said with a smile,””No problem!”

After hanging up, Xia ruofei told Chen Xuan and the rest about Zhao Yongjun contacting the experts and professors. Then, he said,””I’ve scheduled the academic Exchange for the morning of the day after tomorrow. We’ll go to the library again tomorrow and the day after tomorrow to learn as much knowledge as possible.”

“Alright!” Chen Xuan nodded with a smile.”I’ll follow your arrangements!”

Xia ruofei looked at Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha and smiled.””Two seniors, the exchange will be held at the peach blossom clubhouse in the suburbs the day after tomorrow. It’s a small business that I started with my friends, and the environment is not bad! I wonder if the two seniors would be interested in going over to have some fun?”

Xia ruofei didn’t wait for their reply and immediately said,””I’ve made some small decorations in the club. Therefore, the environment there is very unique in the secular world. If you two seniors want to go there together, you might as well give me some guidance!”

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha had originally wanted to stay in siheyuan to cultivate, but after Xia ruofei said that, they were suddenly interested.

“Since little brother Xia has said so, then Valley master Liu and I have to go and take a look!” Mu Sheng said with a smile.

“Fellow Daoist Xia has already piqued our curiosity, so how can we refuse?” Liu Mansha also said with a smile.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then let’s go together!” Miss Xin ‘er and brother Jianfei, let’s go together. Putting aside the environment there, you can also experience some of the pleasures of the secular world! There’s a different taste to it!”

...

Yu Xin ‘Er and Mu Jianfei naturally followed their elders and nodded in agreement with a smile.

Xia ruofei had set up the nine rotation universe formation in the Paradise Club, which made the spiritual Qi in the Paradise Club much more abundant than the outside world. One could even cultivate all the time. Especially in the small villa where the eye of the formation was located, the concentration of spiritual Qi was much denser.
