Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei’s incident was just a small interlude. After elder song and the other leaders arrived and took their seats, the birthday banquet began.

The staff served steaming hot and delicious dishes one after another, and everyone at the table began to toast. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, there were many leaders present today. In addition, there was a mysterious Xia ruofei. Hence, the atmosphere at the younger generation’s table was somewhat dull. Everyone was a little cautious.

On the other hand, general Zhao’s son, Zhao Yongjun, had a forthright personality. He did not look down on Xia ruofei because of his humble background. After that, he did not fear Xia ruofei like the others because of elder song.

Zhao Yongjun saw that everyone was a little reserved, so he laughed and raised his glass to Xia ruofei.””Brother Xia, let’s have a go!”

Song Rui said lazily,””Big brother Zhao, you should really toast to RUO Fei on behalf of uncle Zhao!”

“Xiao Rui, why do you say that?” Zhao Yongjun asked curiously. Could it be that brother Xia has dealt with my dad before?”

The young people at the same table also perked up their ears. They were very curious about Xia ruofei’s situation. Even Lu You couldn’t help but turn to look at Xia ruofei.

Song Rui smiled evilly and said,””Brother Zhao, I won’t lie to you anyway. You should just toast to RUO Fei. As for why, you can ask uncle Zhao when you get back.”

Everyone was disappointed. Zhao Yongjun smiled and said,””You little brat, still keeping me in suspense ... But even if you don’t say it, I still have to give brother Xia a toast!”

Xia ruofei picked up his glass and stood up.””Brother Zhao, don’t listen to song Rui’s nonsense. Come, come, let’s drink this glass of wine together. It doesn’t matter who toasts who, let’s just consider it a mutual toast!”

“Yes, yes, yes! Mutual respect! Respect each other!” Zhao Yongjun laughed out loud.

The two of them were separated by song Rui and Song Wei. After they clinked their glasses, they raised their heads and drank the white wine in their glasses.

Zhao Yongjun wiped his mouth and said,”those who used to be soldiers drink so quickly!” Brother Xia, I’ll be your friend! Don’t forget to contact me when you come to Beijing in the future!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”as long as brother Zhao has wine, I will definitely come to the capital to harass you every time!”

“Hahaha! Enough of the Maotai!” Zhao Yongjun laughed.

After Zhao Yongjun started, the young people at the table started to relax. Liu Jian, who had been a little rude to Xia ruofei, walked over with a glass of wine and said,””Brother Xia, I apologize for my offense just now. Here’s a toast to you. I’ll drink it, and you can do whatever you want!”

Xia ruofei’s personality had always been more easy – going. Liu Jian and the others had just been giving him the cold shoulder. They did not bully him. Now that they had taken the initiative to lower their stance, he naturally would not put on airs.

Xia ruofei also picked up his glass and stood up. After clinking glasses with Liu Jian, he said,”Young master Liu, you’re too kind. We’re all young people. It’ll be boring if we talk and do things like old men!”

“Brother Xia, please don’t call me young master Liu!” Liu Jian quickly said. I don’t deserve it! You can call me Xiaojian, that’s what brother Rui and the others call me ...”

“Alright, Jian, let’s have a go!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. Then, he raised his head and finished a small glass of white wine.

Young people cared about their reputation the most. Although Liu Jian had lowered his attitude and asked Xia ruofei to do as he pleased, he still felt honored that Xia ruofei had finished his drink. After all, Xia ruofei was someone that even elder song valued. He was the only one of his generation!

“Brother Xia, I should be the one to drink first!” Liu Jian quickly said.

After saying that, he hurriedly drank the glass of wine, then immediately poured another glass and said, “I’ll add another cup!”

Then, as if he was afraid that Xia ruofei would stop him, he drank it in one gulp without a second word.

Xia ruofei smiled and patted Liu Jian’s shoulder. “Don’t drink the wine too quickly, have some food to calm it down!”

Maotai, which was at more than 50% alcohol, was quite strong. Liu Jian downed two glasses in a row and felt the smell of alcohol. He smiled gratefully at Xia ruofei and returned to his seat to eat a few mouthfuls of food.

Seeing that Xia ruofei was so approachable, the other young people at the table also became lively and came to propose a toast one by one.

Xia ruofei’s alcohol tolerance was already shocking, and after his cultivation, it became even more amazing. He could probably drink a few catties of this white wine without a problem, and it did not matter if it was a two – pound cup. Therefore, no matter who came to propose a toast, he would finish it in one gulp and feel very refreshed.

In the eyes of these rich men, alcohol tolerance represented character. Xia ruofei’s forthright drinking style had won their favor.

Song Rui was supposed to be the star of this table, but Xia ruofei had stolen all the limelight. However, he did not care at all. Instead, he watched happily as Xia ruofei dealt with the rich kids one after another.

After Xia ruofei finally dealt with this group of people, he was about to take a break when Lu You, who was beside him, joined in the fun and raised her cup at Xia ruofei.””I’ll also give you a toast. ”

Xia ruofei put down the chopsticks he had just picked up and picked up the cup without a second word.””A toast from a beauty, I must drink this cup!”

Song Rui jeered,”ruofei, change to a bigger one!” This small cup is too insincere!”

The good – for – nothings didn’t understand the situation between the three of them, so they didn’t join in the fun. However, they all turned their attention to this side with great interest.
