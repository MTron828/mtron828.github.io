Translator: 549690339

Which dish was the most famous in Sanshan city, or even in the entire Southeast province?

He believed that most people would definitely blurt out that it was ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’. This famous dish with a long history was famous for its complicated cooking process and rich and unique taste.

In the last century, the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ had received the king of sihanuk, the President of the United States, the Queen of United Kingdom, and other heads of state. It could be said to be well – known at home and abroad.

The present that Xia ruofei thought of was this legendary dish, Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

The authentic ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ required 18 main ingredients and 12 supplementary ingredients to be fused together.

It included chicken, duck, pig bones, hoof tips, hoof tendons, fish belly, shark’s fin, sea cucumber, abalone, dried scallops, pigeon eggs, flower mushrooms, and other raw materials and supplementary materials. After frying, stir – frying, stir – frying, and frying, they were put into the jar layer by layer.

As the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was made by stewing dozens of raw materials in one jar, they had the same meat taste while maintaining their own characteristics.

The scholar had a poem: “when the altar is opened, the fragrance of meat wafted in the air. When the Buddha heard it, he abandoned Zen and jumped over the wall.” In layman’s terms, even a Buddha who smelled the fragrance of this dish could not help but renounce asceticism and jump over the wall to eat it. This was the origin of the name ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’.

If it was just a famous dish of the three mountains, Xia ruofei would not have chosen it as a gift for the opening of Ling Ji’s private kitchen.

Moreover, as a famous chef in Sanshan city, Ling Xiaotian would definitely know about the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ recipe. Although Xia ruofei did not know the exact situation, it was simply unimaginable for a private restaurant that mainly served Sanshan cuisine to not have ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’.

However, Xia ruofei still chose this special gift.

The reason was simple.

Other than the great Dao technique, there was another piece of information that Xia ruofei had gotten from the human – shaped jade talisman.

It was a recipe book.

As for the recipe for the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, it was placed at the top of its list of treasures.

Although Xia ruofei did not know how the traditional ‘three mountains Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was made, he could vaguely sense that the secret recipe was not simple.

In fact, how could anything that could be sealed in the human jade talisman with the great Dao Arts, many wondrous cultivation techniques, and medical Scriptures be simple?

Hence, when Xia ruofei thought of the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ secret recipe, he decided to give it to her as a congratulatory gift without any hesitation.

After making his decision, Xia ruofei turned on his computer and searched for the traditional ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ recipe online.

There was a lot of information on the internet, and the methods were mostly the same. Xia ruofei quickly browsed through a few and matched them with the recipe in his mind. He immediately found the difference.

The secret recipe had a few more medicinal ingredients than the traditional method found on the internet.

According to the description of the secret recipe, these herbs could remove the fishy smell of some seafood. At the same time, they also had the effects of replenishing qi and blood, clearing the lungs and soothing the intestines, preventing cold deficiency, and so on.

The most amazing thing was that even though this small change made the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup strictly speaking become a medicinal dish, after it was boiled, there would be no medicinal taste at all. On the other hand, the layered taste of the dish would become more distinct.

Of course, other than this change, there were also some subtle differences in the processing method of some ingredients, the order of placing, and other details. The secret recipe was also slightly different from the traditional ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’.

Xia ruofei did not know what kind of changes these subtle differences would bring.

He looked through a few more documents and finally confirmed that the method of adding a few Chinese medicines into the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ recipe was created by his own secret recipe.

He went through the recipe of the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup in his mind again.

The information was already imprinted in his mind, so in a short time, Xia ruofei had basically mastered the cooking method of this famous dish.

At this moment, Xia ruofei was also eager to try.

After all, whether a dish was good or not, one had to eat it to know. Even if they exaggerated it and the taste was average, no one would buy it.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not only going to give him a recipe tonight. He was going to make a ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ himself and bring it to the Ling Ji private kitchen.

The process of making the ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ was very cumbersome, and the processing of the ingredients was Quite time – consuming. For example, the sea cucumber had to be cooked in advance, which would take more than ten hours. The preparation of the dried abalone might even take two to three days.

Even if all the ingredients had been prepared in advance, it would still need to be slowly stewed for at least ten hours when it was finally cooked. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Under normal circumstances, Xia ruofei would not have enough time.

However, he had the spirit map space in his hands, so time was not a problem at all.

Xia ruofei tidied up his desk and quickly read through the documents that Feng Jing’s assistant, Liu Qian, had sent over. He signed those that needed to be signed.

Then, he gathered the documents, grabbed his handbag, and left the office.

Xia ruofei first went to the office next door and handed the documents to Liu Qian. Then, he bade Feng Jing goodbye and left the comprehensive office building.

To Xia ruofei, the most troublesome thing was still the purchase of ingredients.

This was because the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup had a high requirement for the quality of the ingredients. Furthermore, there was a wide variety of ingredients.

Hence, after some consideration, Xia ruofei decided to go home and ask Hu Zi’s mother to take him to buy some ingredients.

Hu Zi’s mother used to live in a fishing village by the sea in Changping County, so she was very familiar with the area and the seafood. With her leading the way, they would definitely be able to buy the ingredients faster.
