Under Nan Nan’s urging, everyone quickly finished their lunch.

Yesterday, Xia ruofei had already called Lin Yue ‘e, so she had already packed everything she needed to bring.

They mainly bought some clothes and daily necessities, as well as Nan Nan’s books and toys. As for the other things, Xia ruofei had told Lin Yue ‘e yesterday that they would be available at the three mountains, so there was no need to bring them along.

Lin Yue ‘e had told squad leader Luo’s sister yesterday that she was going to San Shan to work, and that she would be bringing uncle Luo and Nan Nan along. Hence, squad leader Luo’s sister had come to their house to send them off after lunch.

After Lin Yue ‘E’s family spoke for a while, everyone was prepared to set off.

There were a total of six big bags. Xia ruofei and Lei Hu each had three bags and carried them easily.

Everyone walked towards the entrance of the village. On the way, the villagers greeted Xia ruofei when they saw him. When they saw the big and small bags, they couldn’t help but ask Lin Yue ‘e where they were going.

When they found out that she was going to San Shan to work and take uncle Luo to get treated, the villagers were envious. Compared to the southeast province along the coast, Ganjiang province was relatively backward. Many of the farmers in Ganjiang province went to the southeast to work.

The villagers knew that if Lin Yue ‘e went to Xia ruofei’s company, she was definitely not an ordinary employee. Now, the entire village knew that Xia ruofei was a soldier that squad leader Luo used to lead. Last time, Xia ruofei had broken the legs of the fake reporter because of squad leader Luo. Such a loyal person would definitely make proper arrangements for Lin Yue’ e.

As they watched Xia ruofei, Lin Yue ‘e, and the rest walk away, the villagers started discussing in low voices.

“Yue ‘e is really lucky! Zhicheng’s comrades take such good care of him ...”

“It’s Mr. Xia who’s loyal!”

“Mr. Luo’s illness was very serious, and I heard that he was dying. Mr. Xia brought expensive medicine last time, and it immediately alleviated his illness. This time, Mr. Xia must have arranged for Mr. Luo to go to San Shan for treatment.”

“Tsk tsk! He’s really a good person ...”

Xia ruofei and the rest naturally did not hear the villagers ‘discussion. They quickly arrived at the village entrance.

When Lin Yue ‘e, Nannan, and the rest saw the Mercedes – Benz spint nanny van parked under the big tree, they couldn’t help but reveal a surprised expression.

“What a beautiful car!” Nan Nan cheered,”uncle Xia, is this your car?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Nan Nan, uncle rented this.” If you like it, uncle can buy one in a while!”

When Lin Yue ‘e saw Xia ruofei bringing a nanny van over, how could she not understand his intentions?

“Ruofei,” she said,”that’s very thoughtful of you ... The rental for this car must be very expensive, right?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””It’s not that much. I’m mainly considering that uncle Luo’s health is not very good. If it’s a long trip, this car will be more comfortable. Also, the back seat of this car can be completely laid down and directly become a bed. If uncle Luo is tired on the road, he can also lie down ...”

“Xia, thank you ...” Uncle Luo said, touched.

Squad leader Luo’s sister also thanked him repeatedly.

Xia ruofei placed the luggage on the ground and opened the back door. The space in the nanny van was very spacious, and Lin Yue ‘E’s six bags of luggage could be easily placed inside.

“Let’s get ready to go!” Xia ruofei carried Nan Nan and said with a smile.

Lei Hu immediately opened the side door and the threshold at the bottom of the car automatically popped out. Xia ruofei carried Nan Nan into the car and arranged a seat in the middle row near the door. He fastened the seat belt.

There were two rows of seats in the Mercedes – Benz spint’s seating area. The middle row had two separate electric massage chairs for extreme comfort.

Hence, Xia ruofei arranged for uncle Luo and Nan Nan to sit, while Lin Yue ‘e naturally had to sit in the back row.

Lin Yue ‘e also helped uncle Luo into the car.

The three of them were stunned by the spint’s luxurious interior. The whole car was wrapped in United Kingdom calfskin, with Myanmar teak floors, Boshi sound system, electric coffee machine, electric curtains, Starlight Roof, and the whole car’s surrounding atmosphere lights. It was all the most luxurious and comfortable configuration.

Lin Yue ‘e and the others had never seen a car like this before, let alone sat in one!

Nannan immediately cheered.

After Xia ruofei had arranged for uncle Luo and Lin Yue ‘e to sit, he considered that it was their first time sitting in this type of nanny van and they were very unfamiliar with the facilities in the car. Xia ruofei let Lei Hu drive the car in the front while he stayed in the seating area at the back.

The electric door slowly closed, and squad leader Luo’s sister waved goodbye to them from outside the car with red eyes.

The Mercedes – Benz spant started up slowly and drove out of the Luoshan village.

Nannan was very curious about everything. There was an adjustment control screen next to her seat, and the young woman could not help but press it here and there. Lin Yue ‘e was afraid that she would damage such an expensive car and quickly stopped her.

“It’s alright, sister – in – Law!”Xia ruofei smiled.

He had been sitting together with Lin Yue ‘e in the back row. At this moment, he stood up and walked to the front row to teach Nan Nan how to operate the control screen.

This model of seat had electric massage, automatic adjustment, and other functions. It could even turn 180 degrees and face the back seats, turning the car into a small meeting room. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Under Xia ruofei’s guidance, Nan Nan had a great time playing and laughed happily from time to time.

After playing with Nan Nan for a while, Xia ruofei saw that she was tired and said,””Nan Nan, be good and finish cooking. Uncle will play an animated film for you. How about that?”
