Translator: 549690339

Ji Yanwu had long been used to such preferential treatment. Even though it was the same transportation fee, as a reporter from a major media company, they always received more than other reporters. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Little Zhao suddenly felt a sense of pride, and he walked with his back straight.

He looked left and right, then said in confusion,””Teacher Ji, why do I feel like this place is so deserted!”

Ji Yanwu was also puzzled.”There’s indeed something wrong. Logically speaking, such a large venue should be very lively!”

After entering the stadium through the media channel, Ji Yanwu was even more shocked. In the huge Stadium, other than the staff who were doing the final debugging, there were almost no seats at a glance. There were only a few audience members sitting in each area.

“F * ck ... What’s going on ...” Ji Yanwu could not help but mumble to himself.

After they arrived at the media seats, some familiar reporters came over to greet them.

“Teacher Ji has come personally!”

“Yo! Isn’t that Mr. Guo from Huaxin club? You’re also coming here personally?” Ji Yanwu laughed and said,”little Zhao, quickly say hello. Teacher Guo is a Big Shot in our line of work!”

“Hello, teacher Guo, please give me your guidance!” Little Zhao quickly greeted him respectfully.

Reporter Guo nodded with a smile and said,””Teacher Ji, I’ve been to God knows how many events in my life, but this is the first time I’ve encountered such a scene ... What are the organizers up to?”

“Who knows?” Ji Yanwu replied with a bitter smile.

As he chatted with reporter Guo, he looked around.

In fact, when he saw reporter Guo, he was already a little surprised. Then, he saw many familiar peers in the press box. They were all senior reporters from the central media, which made him even more shocked.

Although he did not verify it, Ji Yanwu knew that these experienced reporters must have been sent by their superiors, just like him.

Otherwise, an event like this would not have attracted so many experienced reporters.

It seemed that the organizer of this event was quite capable! Ji Yanwu said in his heart.

He also secretly made up his mind that even if the entire Stadium was empty today, he would write a colorful report when he returned. He must not cause himself any trouble.

......

When Ji Yanwu and Xiao Zhao entered the venue earlier, Feng Jing had brushed past them and heard their conversation. Knowing that these two were reporters from the Red Star society, the worried Feng Jing felt a little relieved.

She walked to the media reception and asked,””How many reporters have arrived?”

The staff member immediately handed the check – in book to Feng Jing and said,””Director Feng, most of the media that we’ve invited have sent people over. There are also a few Beijing local media that we didn’t send an invitation to have an interview with us!”

“Really?” Feng Rao was stunned.

She took a look at the signed documents. Just as the staff member had said, there were many media reporters present. In fact, the reporters from the Red Star society, Hua Xin society, national television, and other Super Media outlets were all present.

Looking at the densely packed check – in books, Feng Jing felt a little more at ease.

However, at the thought of the empty Hall, she couldn’t help but frown. It was useless even if all the media reporters were here! If no one came to participate, wouldn’t it be even more embarrassing?

Feng Jing walked over to the audience’s registration counter and asked,””How many people are in the audience?”

The staff member looked worried and said,””Director Feng, there were only four to five hundred people ... A few of them came here to take a look and then went back ...”

Four to five hundred people in the stadium with more than fifteen thousand seats was no different from an empty space.

Feng Jing couldn’t help but shake her head and asked,””Have you guys seen the chairman?”

The staff member shook his head and said,”I’ve been paying attention!” I didn’t see the chairman come!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but curse in her heart. The fire was about to burn their eyebrows, and this guy was still playing the disappearing game. What the hell was he doing?

Just as she was about to call Xia ruofei, she heard the staff say loudly,””Boss Feng, the chairman is here!”
