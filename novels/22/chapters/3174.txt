Deputy Director Wei was really worried that his daughter would come to the office. He was especially worried that her daughter would come with other fans in new Wu city. That would be a bad influence.

So, he asked director Zhong from the supercomputer Center general office to accompany Xia ruofei and the other two on the tour. Then, he put the jaded skin ointment in a paper bag and left the unit in a hurry.

Deputy Director Wei’s home wasn’t too far from the Supercomputing Center, so he usually rode an electric bike to and from work. After getting his electric bike from the unit’s car shed, he rode it back home anxiously.

As soon as Deputy Director Wei rode out of the park, he saw a few young people standing under the shade of a tree across the road. There were both boys and girls, but most of them were girls.

His daughter, Wei Xue, was wearing a long white dress. She stood in the crowd and often stood on her tiptoes to look into the park.

Deputy Director Wei was instantly enraged and glared at Wei Xue.

When the lights on the zebra crossing turned green, Deputy Director Wei immediately rode his electric bike across the road.

Before the car stopped, Deputy Director Wei shouted,”Wei Xue!”

Wei Xue didn’t notice her father’s arrival. When she heard the call, she couldn’t help but tremble. When most people were called by their full names, it meant that their parents were extremely angry.

Wei Xue slowly turned around and forced a smile at Deputy Director Wei. She called out,”Dad! You ... Aren’t you at work? Why did you come out?”

“If I didn’t ask for leave soon, you’re going to make a scene!” Deputy Director Wei said with a dark face.

The young boys and girls around Wei Xue seemed to have discovered a new world and surrounded her.

“Uncle, are you the one who took the photo with President Xia just now?”

“Uncle, is President Xia still inside?”

“So you’re Wei Xue’s father! Wei Xue, you hid the photo of your father and President Xia from us. You’ve really hidden it well!”

Xia ruofei’s fans were all talking at once, and the noise made Deputy Director Wei’s head swell.

He couldn’t help but feel that new Wu city was really too small. It had only been an hour since Xia ruofei posted that Weibo post, and so many local fans had already rushed to the park.

Of course, the fans were just trying their luck because Xia ruofei’s Weibo post might not have just happened. Many celebrities would not easily reveal their whereabouts in order to avoid being surrounded by fans.

However, Xia ruofei had never been so secretive. Besides, he was not really an entertainment star.

Besides, Xia ruofei’s fans were more rational and cultured.

In addition to the new Wu Supercomputing Center, there were several high – tech companies in the park.

The Supercomputing Center was naturally a high – Level security unit.

However, the fans didn’t even enter the gate of the park, which was relatively less guarded. They just looked around and waited on the other side of the road, let alone go to the entrance of the Supercomputing Center.

Although Deputy Director Wei was a little angry, he would not vent his anger on a group of children because of his daughter, Wei Xue.

So, he could only say,”children, go home!” Don’t crowd around here!”

“Uncle! We won’t disturb you, President Xia. We’ll just watch from a distance ...”

“Yup! Uncle, we’re not crazy fans! President Xia’s fans were all rational fans! We would never do such stupid things!”

Xia ruofei’s fans said.

Deputy Chief Wei was also helpless about this. He could not control other people’s children!

However, even if she couldn’t discipline other people’s children, she still had to discipline her own children.

Therefore, Deputy Director Wei still looked at his daughter Wei Xue and said sternly,”Wei Xue! Come home with me!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I’m not going back, I haven’t seen President Xia yet ...”Wei Xue pouted.

“What are you looking at, President Xia! Come home with me immediately!” Deputy Director Wei said with a dark expression.

“Dad ...” Wei Xue looked at her father with pleading eyes.

Deputy Director Wei’s heart softened, and he said in a gentler tone,””Little Xue, come back with daddy! Also, the children should go back too! Don’t wait here like a fool. I can tell you clearly that even if you wait for the whole night, you won’t be able to see President Xia. Don’t waste time here! All of you can go back!”

Deputy Director Wei knew that Xia ruofei would stay in the Supercomputing Center for the whole day and start using the supercomputer at 10 pm until the next morning. During this time, he would not leave the park.

Therefore, these fans were destined to wait in vain, unless they could wait here all night.

Wei Xue looked at her father and asked pitifully,””Dad! Really?”

“Xiaoxue, dad really didn’t lie to you,” said Vice Director Wei with a nod.

After he finished speaking, Deputy Director Wei winked at Wei Xue.

The tacit understanding between father and daughter was still very good. Wei Xue immediately realized that her father might have some things that were not convenient to say to her in front of everyone.

Thus, she pondered for a moment before unwillingly saying in a low voice,””Alright then! I ... I’ll go home with you ...”

Wei Xue knew that her father had been busy with work recently and would definitely not be at home to look after her all the time. At most, she would just come over after he left!

Wei Xue stepped onto Deputy Director Wei’s electric motorcycle under the urging of several other fans.

As for the other children, Deputy Director Wei naturally could not control them. He had already advised them, but they did not listen to him.

Deputy Director Wei rode on an electric scooter and drove his daughter to a house nearby.

On the way, Wei Xue impatiently asked,””Dad! What did you want to tell me just now? Why do you have to avoid the other fans?”

“We’ll talk about it when we get home!”Said Deputy Director Wei in a muffled voice.

Wei Xue stuck out her tongue. She was quite dissatisfied with Deputy Director Wei’s behavior of keeping her in suspense. However, she had no choice but to be patient until Deputy Director Wei led her into the house.

Wei Xue could not help but ask,”dad!” Can you tell me now? What’s the matter?”

“Didn’t I tell you not to come to my office when I called?”asked Vice Director Wei. Why are you so disobedient?”

Wei Xue blinked and said,”dad!” I didn’t go to your office! I was just chatting with a few friends by the road! Besides, the entrance of the park is still far from your unit!”

Wei Xue mumbled the last sentence because she knew that it was a little forced.

Deputy Director Wei’s eyes widened, and then he shook his head helplessly.”Xiao Xue, I just wanted to tell you that President Xia is indeed in our Supercomputing Center, but he will be in the center the entire night. He might not even come out tomorrow, so I didn’t lie to you. You waiting there is completely in vain.”

...

Wei Xue smiled and said,”it’s okay!” This is the first time we’re so close to our idol. As long as we’re at the door, we feel closer to President Xia! As for whether we can see him in person ... Of course, it’d be best if we can see him. If we can’t see him, he won’t cry. We’ve already said that President Xia’s fans are all rational fans!”

Deputy Director Wei found it hard to understand, but it was better for his daughter to maintain a certain level of rationality while chasing after stars than to become a crazy fan.

“Dad! What else do you want to tell me?” Wei Xue said,”I saw you giving me a look. Don’t tell me that was just a stalling tactic!”

Deputy Director Wei scratched his head and said,””How could I? I took a photo with President Xia, don’t you want to see it?”

“What’s so strange about that?” Wei Xue said,”it was posted on CEO Xia’s Weibo. Everyone saw it! Is there anything special about your photo?”

Deputy Director Wei was suddenly at a loss for words. He thought about it and realized that there was indeed nothing special about the group photo. Even the angle of the shot was basically the same ...

He had wanted to use the photo as evidence to prevent his daughter from suspecting that his gift was fake.

Now that Xia ruofei had posted on Weibo, he didn’t need to prove himself with the photos.

Therefore, Deputy Director Wei simply took out the paper bag and stuffed it into Wei Xue’s hands. He said,””Since you don’t care about the photos, then take a look at this!”

“What is this?” Wei Xue asked.

“You’ll know when you open it!” Deputy Director Wei said with a smile.

...

Wei Xue looked at her father and opened the paper bag.

“Jaded skin cream? It’s actually the jadeskin series!” Wei Xue couldn’t help but cry out.

As a qualified fan of Xia ruofei, Wei Xue knew all the products of paradise Corporation like the back of her hand, especially the jaded skin cream, which was a girl’s favorite. Thus, she could accurately recognize that it was the jaded bone ice Skin Series with a retail price of 3888 Yuan just by glancing at the outer packaging.

Wei Xue looked at her father in surprise and said with a smile,”Dad! I didn’t expect you to be so willing to spend money! But it’s not New Year’s Day today, and it’s not anyone’s birthday in our family! Why did you suddenly prepare a gift? And it’s such a precious gift!”

Although the jadeskin series had a retail price of 3888 Yuan, it was very difficult to get a hold of it every time, and the scalper price had already exceeded 10000 Yuan. Wei Xue did not think that her father would be able to get the jaded skin cream that was sold officially. If he were to buy it from a scalper, the price of more than 10000 Yuan was obviously a relatively extravagant consumption for a family like Deputy Director Wei ‘s.

“Why don’t you open it first?” Deputy Director Wei said with a smile.

Only then did Wei Xue realize that the outer layer of the jaded skin cream had been torn off. She could not help but Mutter in her heart,”Could it be a second – hand item that someone else had used?

However, she still opened the box. The first thing that caught her eye was not the beautiful bottle of jaded skin ointment, but the thin card.

When she saw the words on the card, Wei Xue was slightly stunned. Then, she stuffed the box into Deputy Director Wei’s hands and picked up the card to look at it carefully.

Wei Xue did not even blink, afraid that she would miss a single detail.

There was a nervous and excited look on her face, and her eyelashes were trembling slightly.

After a long while, Wei Xue finally accepted this pleasant surprise that had descended from the sky. She could not help but shout,”Waa! It’s really a gift from President Xia! Did I receive a gift from President Xia? Dad! I’m not dreaming, right?”
