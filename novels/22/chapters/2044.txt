2045 Evolution of the rules (2)

Of course, this trace of law disorder lasted for a very short time, almost an instant, and then the many laws in the spirit map space began to operate again.

Xia ruofei could feel that the rules of space and time in the spirit map world seemed to be clearer than before.

Now, the upgrade of the space was not only an expansion of the area and an increase in the concentration of spiritual Qi. Xia ruofei vaguely felt that the space was becoming more and more real.

It was a strange feeling.

The spirit map space had always been there. By right, it would not give Xia ruofei the feeling that it was illusionary. However, he could clearly sense the difference between this man – made space and the outside world, especially when he first obtained the space. Compared to the current space, there was a very obvious change. The spirit map space was getting closer and closer to the outside world.

For example, when he first obtained the spatial zone, although the spiritual Qi was rich, there was a sense of deathly stillness. Now, the changes to his senses were very obvious. When Xia ruofei’s mind stayed in the spatial zone, he could even feel the gentle breeze and the rippling of water. If the sky in the spatial zone also had sunrise and sunset, it would be no different from the outside world.

This was an evolution of the rules.

Perhaps every time the space leveled up, the rules of the spirit map world would evolve to different degrees. However, at that time, Xia ruofei’s spiritual power cultivation was not strong enough, and his connection with the space was not as close as it was now, so the feeling was not as obvious.

This was the first time Xia ruofei felt the internal rules of the space gradually being perfected.

He closed his eyes slightly and silently felt it for a while. He felt that his understanding of the rules of space and the truth of the great Dao had improved a little.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes and looked at the box.

There were still four world stones in the box, so it was definitely not enough to upgrade the space to another level.

However, Xia ruofei did not intend to keep them. The upgrade of the space was a process of changing from quantity to quality. Even if it could not change the quality of the space, it was at least a kind of accumulation of quantity. This way, if he could get more world stones next time, he would need fewer world stones to upgrade. Overall, it was the same.

Hence, Xia ruofei only muttered to himself for a moment before reaching out to pick up another realm stone and bringing it close to the spirit map.

Although the space had just been upgraded, the spirit map scroll still did not reject the world stone. It absorbed the world stone in an instant.

At this moment, the White realm Fox, which was still confined in the air, could not help but squeak.

Xia ruofei used his mind to sense it with interest. This little guy seemed to be stopping him from continuing to let the space absorb the world stones.

However, when it looked at the world stone, it realized that the essence contained within the world stone had already been completely absorbed.

Xia ruofei chuckled and said to the white fox telepathically,””Leave a few for you? Give me a reason!”

“Squeak!” The White realmfox gestured with its hands and legs.

Xia ruofei could easily guess the white fox’s intention. It wanted to help Xia ruofei find the realm stone on the condition that it would eat two of them to satisfy its hunger. After all, it had been starving for a long time since they left the tomb.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”I thought you didn’t know how to be hungry!” Since that’s the case, you should hurry up and try to sense the world stone! If I can find it, I’ll keep my promise and give you your share. You’ll have food then, right?”

The White realmfox squeaked and gestured a few more times, meaning that it was so hungry that its chest was sticking to its back. It had no strength to sense the location of the world stone, unless it ate two of them to recover its vitality.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh,”I like your shamelessness!” Little guy, if you want to eat for free, you’d better give up this idea as soon as possible! Here, you must be paid according to your work. If you don’t put in effort, you can’t get anything in return!”

Xia ruofei’s mind swept over the dejected white fox and continued,””If you’re not willing to cooperate, I naturally won’t force you. Moreover, I won’t drive you away. You can stay here to comprehend the spatial laws as long as you want! As for the matter of finding the world stone, since you can’t help, then forget it! I’m not in a hurry anyway ...” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After saying that, Xia ruofei released the seal on the white fox.

The little guy landed on the ground, got up, and waved its claws in the direction of the sky as if to show off.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh. He had made a last – minute decision to not let the spirit map scroll absorb the remaining three world stones.

With a thought, the three world stones and the box disappeared from the bedroom. The next moment, they appeared in the spirit map space.

Xia ruofei did not give the spirit map space an order to devour and the space would not absorb the realm stones on its own. Hence, the realm stones could still be stored in the space, provided that Xia ruofei’s connection with the spirit map space was precise enough and he had precise control over the space.

After the box containing the three realm stones entered the space, Xia ruofei did not wait for the White realm Fox to react. With a thought, he made use of the space rules to create a small space and wrapped the box up.

When the White sector Fox reached the box, it was immediately blocked by an invisible space membrane.

To the white fox’s despair, in just a few seconds, Xia ruofei had stacked more than twenty small spaces on top of the box. The small spaces were connected to each other, protecting the box and the realm stone inside.

With the white fox’s current strength, even if it did not sleep or rest, it would still take a long time to crack all these small spaces.

Furthermore, Xia ruofei knew everything that was happening in the space like the back of his hand. Once he noticed that the white fox was destroying those small spaces, he only needed to think about it slightly and he would be able to build a solid space barrier again.

The speed at which the realm Fox broke through the spatial barrier was definitely not as fast as the speed at which Xia ruofei set up the small space.

Therefore, unless Xia ruofei was willing, the White realm Fox would never be able to touch the realm stones.

Xia ruofei smiled at the white fox and said,””Little guy, don’t even think about causing any destruction in my space! Otherwise, it wouldn’t be as simple as being confined ...”

The White realmfox also knew that a strong Dragon could not suppress a snake in its own territory. In the spirit map space, Xia ruofei could mobilize all resources. Even if someone with a higher cultivation than him was dragged into the space, it would be difficult to threaten him. Moreover, the White realmfox’s cultivation was not high. It only had a deeper understanding of the rules of space. It could not defeat Xia ruofei in the outside world, let alone in the space.

How could he not bow his head when he was under the roof?

Therefore, the white fox could only look at the gray box in a daze. It decided to hide far away and continue to comprehend the rules of space.

At this moment, Xia ruofei added,”as for the matter of cooperating to find the world stone, you can weigh the pros and cons yourself.” Every word I say is a nail in the coffin! As long as I find the world stone with your help, I will definitely give it to you. You don’t need to doubt this! In addition, if you’re really famished, I can lend you one or two world stones to satisfy your hunger. It’s not impossible ...”

Hearing this, the White realmfox’s spirit was lifted, and it squeaked a few times.

“Let me finish first, I have a condition!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”first of all, I still need your help to find the location of the world stone. I have a sensing array here as well, but it’s not as wide as your sensing range! So ... If I follow your instructions, my induction array will also discover the existence of the realm stone. That will prove that you did not deceive me and that you did not slack off. By then, I don’t mind giving you two realm stones in advance! How was it? Isn’t this a good suggestion?”
