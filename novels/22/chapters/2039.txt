2040 A face full of confusion (2)

“Monica, are you listening?” Xia ruofei’s voice was heard from the phone.

“I’m here ...” Monica quickly said.

“I’m sorry!” Xia ruofei said,”due to some special reasons, I didn’t check my emails in time. I just saw your email ... How’s the situation on your side?”

Monica could feel Xia ruofei’s concern. She said,””The most difficult stage has passed. Xia, don’t worry, I’m safe now!”

Xia ruofei pretended to heave a sigh of relief and said,””That’s good! That’s good! I was scared to death when I saw your email ...”

Although Monica had guessed countless times that Xia ruofei would not appear in front of her and had blamed Xia ruofei countless times, Monica still felt warm in her heart at this moment. She smiled and said,””I’m fine now! By the way, Xia, Did you know? The reason why I was able to turn the tide this time was all thanks to a fellow Countryman of yours!”

“My fellow countrymen?” Xia ruofei asked, pretending to be curious as he tried to suppress his laughter.

“Yup! And he’s also surnamed Xia like you!” Monica said excitedly,”do you know? When I first saw him, I almost thought he was you!”

“Do I look like him?” Xia ruofei asked.

“Actually, it doesn’t look like it!” Monica said,”but that feeling was very strange. I almost mistook him for someone else a few times. Sometimes, that familiar feeling made it seem like that Mr. Xia was you!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but secretly wipe his sweat. A woman’s sixth sense was too scary!

He was sure that his appearance, temperament, and even height had all changed. Even people who were very familiar with him would not easily connect the two identities together.

Monica was naturally the same, but she always had a familiar feeling. This feeling was unclear. Perhaps it could only be explained by a woman’s intuition.

Xia ruofei listened to Monica’s vivid description of what had happened in the past few days. Although Xia ruofei had experienced it personally and was very clear about everything, he still listened with great interest.

Monica’s excitement could even affect Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei didn’t say anything. At this time, being a loyal listener was obviously the best choice.

Finally, Monica finished. She asked,””Xia, what I’ve been through these past few days, isn’t it amazing?”

“It’s indeed magical!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”but I’m more afraid. I didn’t expect you to be in such a dangerous situation ... That Mr. Xia has helped you so much. You really have to thank him! If there’s a chance next time, introduce me to him! Maybe we can become good friends ...”

When Xia ruofei said this, he more or less had a wicked sense of humor.

As expected, Monica immediately said,””Xia! That Mr. Xia said the same thing! It’s almost exactly the same as what you said! You guys are so well – coordinated! You really don’t have any brothers who got separated from you when you were young?”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.”How is that possible?”

Then, Xia ruofei immediately changed the topic and said,””Monica, I’m really sorry about this. I wasn’t able to appear by your side when you needed me the most ...”

At the same time, Xia ruofei said in his heart,””Actually, I’ve already gone. It’s just that for the sake of everyone’s safety, I can only use another identity ...

“I’m fine now!” Monica consoled him. Then, she hesitated and said,”Xia, if you have time, can you make a trip to Turin? I really, really miss you!”

Xia ruofei replied without hesitation,”of course, no problem!” I was just about to talk to you about this!”

“You were already prepared to come to Italy?” Monica’s mood instantly became better.

“Mm! “I saw in your email that your brother, Rossi, has a sequela of polio, so he can only spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair ...” Xia ruofei said.”I hope to help him treat his illness!”

Monica said,”Xia, Rousey’s after – effects are quite serious. I’ve taken him to see many doctors over the years. There are no effective drugs to treat the after – effects of polio at the moment. He can only take rehabilitation training, but the effect is generally not very good ...”

“I know! Those are all Western medicine theories!” Xia ruofei said,”actually, I’m a pretty good Chinese medicine practitioner. From a Chinese medicine perspective, Rousey’s condition is caused by the heat and wind that has seeped into his meridians. Although it has left behind some serious side effects, if you stimulate the acupuncture points, with the help of medicine and massage, it should be able to improve greatly!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Then, Xia ruofei added,”Western medicine and Chinese medicine are two completely different theoretical systems. You may not know much about Chinese medicine, but in fact ...”

“No! I believe you!” Monica interrupted Xia ruofei and said,”Xia, come to Italy as soon as possible! I need you to ...”

Monica’s last sentence ignited the fire in Xia ruofei’s heart. These few days in Turin, he had been very close to Monica. Unfortunately, he had another identity and could not get close to her. Xia ruofei had suppressed the fire in his heart for a long time.

After hearing Monica’s words, Xia ruofei wished he could fly to Italy immediately.
