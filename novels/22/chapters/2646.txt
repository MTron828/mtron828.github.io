Evian couldn’t help but look at Xia ruofei deeply. Then, he reached out his dark and fat hand and shook Xia ruofei’s hand. He said in broken English,””Mr. Xia, welcome to the ponautu!”

Xia ruofei nodded slightly and said in a neutral tone,””Sorry for the trouble, Minister Evian!”

“It’s not much trouble. After all, we had an agreement before. ” Evian smiled and said,”then ... Please come in!”

Evian made an inviting gesture and let Liu Kuan and his men in.

Liu Kuan gave benilati a look, and he immediately went up to Evian and chatted with him in their dialect.

Liu Kuan was two steps behind Xia ruofei, walking side by side.

Liu Kuan said to Xia ruofei,”Mr. Xia, the reason I said that was to dispel some unrealistic ideas from the officials of the agate.” This is also what the old master specifically instructed me to do before I left. I forgot to tell you. ”

Xia ruofei smiled.”I understand. Elder Liu, you’re very thoughtful.”

Liu Kuan’s words were meant to mislead Evian into thinking that green cloud Island was not out of the Liu family’s control. It was just a reward given to Xia ruofei, a junior of the Liu family.

In this way, the officials of ponathu would still be wary of the Liu family’s arrangements for so many years, constantly using the hard strength of blue cloud Island as well as some political and economic means to make ponathu not dare to have the idea of taking back blue cloud Island.

In fact, many of the high – Level officials of the agate had gained a lot of benefits from this big deal with the Liu family. Later, because of the cooperation between the two sides, they had been able to gain a steady stream of benefits. This was also an important reason why the Liu family could firmly control the blue cloud Island in their hands.

Most of the executives of ponautu only cared about their own interests, which was evident from the exaggerated size of Evian compared to the ordinary people. They did not care at all that a piece of their country’s territory had been essentially ceded.

However, if the Carnelian Empire knew that the Liu family had completely transferred the ownership of clear sky Island to Xia ruofei, and Xia ruofei was only a slightly wealthy Huaxia who did not have the terrifying power of the Liu family, then it was inevitable that they would slowly begin to covet clear sky Island.

This was something old man Liu did not want to see. Since he had transferred the island to Xia ruofei as medical expenses, he naturally hoped that the entire handover process would be smooth so that Xia ruofei would not have to worry about the agate map snatching the island back.

That was why old man Liu and Liu Kuan had the same answer.

Of course, Liu Kuan did not forget to inform Xia ruofei. In fact, old master Liu had specifically told him not to tell Xia ruofei in advance because he did not want to give Xia ruofei a chance to refuse.

Xia ruofei was not a pedantic person, so he did not dislike such a strategy.

Liu Kuan was also secretly relieved. He quickly caught up with Evian and chatted with him in English.

The group soon arrived at Evian’s large office on the ninth floor.

In fact, Xia ruofei had already noticed it the moment he entered the building. This office building shared by two departments had a luxurious interior design that was no less than some five – Star hotels in the country. It was even more eye – catching in the slums of evates Island. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Evian’s office was also extremely luxurious, but to Xia ruofei, it had the air of a rich upstart.

Evian’s office was very large. In fact, the entire nine floors were divided into two. Evian and the Minister of Police each took half of the floor. Other than the secretary’s office and the conference room, Evian’s office was the other part of the floor.

The procedure for changing ownership was not complicated, and Evian followed it up personally, so the efficiency was naturally higher.

Soon, all the procedures were completed. Evian announced on behalf of the Carnelian officials that the permanent ownership of Qingyun Island was now under Xia ruofei’s name. At the same time, he also congratulated Xia ruofei.

Evian also expressed on behalf of the ponathu officials that ponathu respected and acknowledged Xia ruofei’s ownership of Qingyun Island.

Next, he just had to complete the registration procedure and Xia ruofei’s main mission would be accomplished.

Just then, Xia ruofei suddenly asked,””Minister Evian, I’d like to ask if I can change the name of the island?”

Evian pondered for a moment and said,””Of course! You have the right to do so!”

Xia ruofei had already thought it through. He said directly,””I wish to change the name of the blue cloud Island to the Peach Blossom Island. I wonder if the procedures will be more troublesome?”

“No trouble at all! It’s no trouble at all!” “We just need to fill in an application form for the change of name,” Evian said with a smile.”I’ll get someone to bring it over!”

Soon, Evian’s Secretary printed out the template of the application form and handed it to Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei followed the Secretary’s instructions and quickly filled in the form. The Chinese name was “Peach Blossom Island”. As for the English name, Xia ruofei still used the word “Fairyland” to form “Fairyland – like islands”, which looked quite poetic.

After all the formalities were completed, in fact, the current clear sky Island should be called Peach Blossom Island in the future. Legally, Peach Garden Island now belonged to Xia ruofei.
