“Dad!” Liu Qunfeng couldn’t help but say. How could this happen? When a leader like song Qiming goes out, everyone at all levels will pay great attention to safety. He actually got into a car accident ... Could there be some hidden story behind this?”

In terms of rank, Liu Qunfeng and song Qiming were of the same rank. In terms of importance, song Qiming was the third in command of the southeast province and was in charge of the provincial capital, Sanshan. Liu Qunfeng was the Deputy Minister of an important Ministry, so they should be about the same. In comparison, song Qiming was a few years younger than Liu Qunfeng. The two of them were considered the backbone of their respective forces.

“There’s too little information at the moment, so we can’t make a judgment for the time being,”said old man Liu calmly. However ... If anything happened to song Qiming, the song family would be furious! Who knew what kind of storm would come next! Sigh ... It’s been an eventful period recently!”

Liu Qunfeng was deeply touched, and he couldn’t help but sigh.

“Qunfeng, tell everyone to restrain their children,” said old man Liu. “The wind has been a little off recently, and I keep feeling that something is going to happen.” Now that song Qiming is in trouble, no one knows what’s going to happen next ... Also, we have to learn from this and ask everyone to pay more attention to safety!”

“Okay, dad!” Liu Qunfeng said.

“I’m a little tired, you can go back first!” Old man Liu said,”my situation here is very stable. Even if Xiao Xia is not in Beijing, there is nothing to worry about ... You don’t have to come here every day. Doing your job well is better than anything else!”

“Dad, I know.” Liu Qunfeng said,”I’ll go back first ...”

Old man Liu nodded slightly and waved his hand without saying anything.

……

Not long after Xia ruofei hung up the call with Liu Qunfeng, the car arrived at the north gate of Capital University. From afar, he could see Song Wei standing by the road. Her eyes were red and swollen.

“Wuqiang, drive over there!” Xia ruofei said quickly.

Toyoda Elfa stopped beside Song Wei.

Xia ruofei had only bought the Elfa when he came to the capital, so Song Wei did not know that it was Xia ruofei’s car. She only saw Xia ruofei sitting in the car when the electric door opened.

Song Wei’s eyes turned red and she said weakly,””RUO Fei ...”

“We’ll talk in the car!” Said Xia ruofei. He moved to the seat next to him and left the seat next to the door empty for Song Wei.

Song Wei nodded and got into the car. She sat beside Xia ruofei.

The electric car door closed slowly. Xia ruofei said,””Wu Qiang, go directly to the airport and the private aircraft building! Try to drive faster on the road!”

“Understood!” “Yes,” Wu Qiang replied calmly. He then stepped on the accelerator and drove Alphard in the direction of the Capital International Airport.

At the same time, Wu Qiang also pressed a button next to the instrument panel. A thick piece of glass slowly rose, separating the back row from the driving area.

He knew what Xia ruofei and Song Wei were going to say next. It was best if he didn’t listen.

Xia ruofei looked at Wu Qiang’s back with satisfaction. Then, he gently pressed on the glass partition and the transparent glass instantly turned into mist.

It blocked sight and sound, completely separating the front and back.

Then, Xia ruofei turned to Song Wei.

Song Wei had been holding back in school. Now that she saw Xia ruofei, she could no longer hold back the grief in her heart. She leaned on Xia ruofei’s shoulder and cried like a Pear Blossom bathed in rain.

Xia ruofei held Song Wei’s hand tightly and said,””Weiwei, don’t worry ... Uncle song is a lucky man, he’ll be fine! And you know my medical skills. Even if uncle song is slightly injured, I’m confident that I can cure him!”

Song Wei nodded her head and said,”Mm! My dad will definitely be fine!”

When Song Wei received her mother’s call, she was out of her wits. She felt as if the sky had fallen down on her. Only when she saw Xia ruofei did she feel as if she had a pillar of support and her heart was at ease.

“You should sleep for a while ... I’ll wake you up when we reach the airport.” Xia ruofei said,”don’t worry, I’ve already arranged for a private jet. We can take off as soon as we reach the airport. There won’t be any delay!”

“Mm! “RUO Fei, thank you ...” Song Wei said gently.

Xia ruofei stroked her cheek affectionately and said,””Silly girl, do you need to be so polite with me?”

In reality, Xia ruofei and Song Wei were really passionate and polite. It was the first time they were so close to each other. However, Xia ruofei did not have any other thoughts. Song Wei was at her most helpless. She subconsciously treated Xia ruofei as her support.

Xia ruofei helped Song Wei lower the back of her seat so that she could lie down comfortably. After a while, Song Wei fell asleep. However, even in her sleep, she was frowning and holding Xia ruofei’s hand.

Xia ruofei looked at Song Wei with heartache. He was frustrated.

There was too little information available, and they did not know how song Qiming was doing. If song Qiming was really injured and died before they could get back, then no matter how capable he was, he would not be able to save a dead person.

If that was the case, it would be a huge blow to Song Wei.

One thing was for sure, song Qiming’s condition was not looking good. Otherwise, Song Wei’s mother would not have asked her to go back so quickly. She was basically asking Song Wei to see song Qiming for the last time.

Therefore, it was hard to say if song Qiming could last until they returned to the three mountains ...

Xia ruofei had no other choice but to pray in his heart.

He was already on his way back as fast as he could.

Let’s do our best and leave it to fate! Xia ruofei sighed in his heart.

After a while, Xia ruofei felt the phone in his pocket vibrate. His phone was in his right pocket and his right hand was being held tightly by Song Wei. He quickly took out his phone from his pocket with his left hand in an awkward position.

He glanced at the caller ID and immediately picked up.

“Manager Lu ...” Xia ruofei was afraid of waking Song Wei, so he lowered his voice.

“Ruofei, where are you now?” Manager Lu asked anxiously.

“I’m on my way to the airport. Manager Lu, what’s the matter?” Xia ruofei asked.

“The airport?” Elder song’s voice came from the phone. It was obvious that manager Lu had put the call on speaker.”Ruofei, you already know?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment and asked,”Grandpa song, are you talking about Secretary song?” Song Wei told me about it. I’m on my way to the airport with her right now, and we’re getting ready to go back!”

“Are you coming with us?” asked elder song.

“Of course!” Xia ruofei said.

“That’s good! “I’ll be more at ease if you go back ...” Elder song heaved a sigh of relief and said,”ruofei, you must do your best to save Qiming’s life!”

“I understand, Grandpa song.” Xia ruofei said.

Elder song did not know about his relationship with Song Wei, so Xia ruofei did not explain much.

Then, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but ask,””Grandpa song, I don’t have much information on hand. I want to know how Secretary song is doing.”

“He’s not in good condition. He has a severe brain injury. He was dying when he was sent to the hospital. Ruofei, you ...”Elder song said in a low voice.

“As long as Secretary song can hold on until we get back, even if he’s on his last breath, I have a 50% chance of saving his life!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation.

“Alright!” Elder song said,”I’ll personally inform the southeast province. We’ll pay any price to maintain Qiming’s vital signs and wait for you to return!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said.

“Right, the situation is urgent. Do you need me to ask the Air Force to send an aircraft ...” Elder song continued.

“Grandpa song, I’ve already arranged for a private jet to be on standby at the airport!” Xia ruofei said.

“That’s good! That’s good!” Elder song said,”I’ll get Xiao Lu to inform the Air Force to make sure that the plane can take off as soon as you arrive at the airport!”

“Okay, thank you, Grandpa song!” Xia ruofei said.

“I should be the one thanking you!” Elder song said emotionally,”ruofei, Qiming has suffered a lot since he was young. He shouldn’t have such an ending. Please do your best to save his life!”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
