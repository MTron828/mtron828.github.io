Chapter 1341: The wild hothead (1)

Translator: 549690339

It was not Zhao Yongjun who had called, but Liu Zhe.

Liu Zhe could be considered a second – generation child and was quite popular in Sanshan city. His father was the leader of the provincial state – owned assets Control Commission. Last time, when the Paradise Corporation bought half of the property rights of the Heng Li building, they encountered trouble from a small section Chief in charge of the matter from the state – owned assets Control Commission. It was Liu Zhe who came forward to help settle it.

In addition, Xia ruofei liked Liu Zhe’s personality, so he kept in touch with him. They would even get together for drinks occasionally. They had a good personal relationship.

On the other end of the phone, Liu Zhe seemed to be hesitating. He asked,””Brother Xia, are you free today? I have something to discuss with you ...”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment, then said,””Today...I’m afraid I don’t have much time. A few friends came to the three mountains, and I need to receive them ...”

Then, Xia ruofei smiled and asked,”Liu Zhe, what’s up?” Isn’t it convenient to talk over the phone?”

“Oh ... Then, brother Xia, please wait a moment!” Liu Zhe said.

......

There was a Qing He teahouse not far from Ling Ji private kitchen, and Liu Zhe was in a private room at the teahouse.

Other than him, there were three other young men around his age.

One of them was slightly older, but he was only in his early thirties. The other man and woman were around twenty – five or twenty – six years old. The man was wearing a black motorcycle jacket, his hair was dyed yellow, and he had silver earrings. The woman also had yellow hair, and her makeup was very thick, especially her big red lips, which gave people the feeling of a bloody mouth. She clearly looked delicate and pretty, but with this makeup, it was obvious that she looked out of place.

After Liu Zhe heard Xia ruofei’s words, he covered the microphone and said to the only man in his early thirties who was dressed normally among the three of them,””Chief Tian, brother Xia said he has a business meeting today, so I’m afraid he won’t have time ...”

Liu Zhe was a little annoyed, but he had no choice but to pretend to be a snake with these three people.

All three of them came from Beijing.

The man in his early thirties, who was called “director Tian” by Liu Zhe, was called Tian Xiaojun. He was a Deputy Director of the Huaxia SASAC.

Although the capital’s officials had a natural authority when they came to their local areas, Tian Xiaojun was only a Deputy Division Leader. There was still a large gap between him and Liu Zhe’s father.

Besides, a Deputy Director in his early thirties might be a very prominent political star in the local area, but in the Ministry, it was actually not that big of a deal. There were many people faster than this, especially in the regiment system, where there were too many Department – Level cadres in their thirties to count.

However, Tian Xiaojun was different. Not only was he a Deputy department level cadre of the state – owned assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the southeast province, but his father was also a Secretary of the Ministry of Housing and Construction, and he was promoted from the southeast province. He was once the superior of Liu Zhe’s father. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Therefore, when Tian Xiaojun came to the three mountains and found Liu Zhe, he had no choice but to help.

As for the remaining man and woman, they were not from the system.

The man was from the same family as Xia ruofei. His name was Xia Ling, and he was only twenty – four years old. The girl with heavy makeup was called Zhong Zixin.

The two of them were in a similar situation as Tian Xiaojun. Their fathers were both Department – Level cadres.

Although they didn’t explain it to Liu Zhe in detail, Liu Zhe had already guessed that the three of them should be heading to paradise Corporation.

That was why Tian Xiaojun came to find out about Tao Yuan company’s situation, especially Xia ruofei ‘s. When Liu Zhe accidentally let it slip and they found out that he had a good relationship with Xia ruofei, Tian Xiaojun immediately asked Liu Zhe to ask Xia ruofei out.

Liu Zhe was quite well – informed in San Shan. Xia ruofei’s paradise Corporation had emerged as a new force. The emergence of the jaded skin cream had made paradise corporation’s name known throughout the country. In the eyes of many, this was undoubtedly a piece of fat meat.

In the San Shan area, there were not many people who dared to set their eyes on the peach blossom company because those who had the ability knew that Xia ruofei was under Song Wei’s protection. As for those who were not qualified to know about this matter, they basically could not cause much trouble.

However, the local tyrant did not dare to act rashly, while the Dragon crossing the river rushed in fearlessly.

When Tian Xiaojun heard that Xia ruofei had rejected the meeting, he could not help but frown and said,”Ask him where he is! Let’s go and join in the fun! It’s only interesting to drink with many people ...”

“This ...” Liu Zhe was in a difficult position.

“What’s wrong?”Tian Xiaojun frowned and asked. Is there a problem?”

“I’ll ask ...” Liu Zhe said helplessly.

He did not want to offend Tian Xiaojun. At the same time, Xia ruofei was still waiting on the other end of the phone, so he could not delay too long.

After Liu Zhe took his hand off the microphone, he pretended to be relaxed and smiled. He asked,””Brother Xia, where are you going to socialize tonight? I’m here to give a toast too!”

Xia ruofei was a little surprised. His rejection was obvious. Liu Zhe did not seem like such an insensible person!

He thought for a moment and felt that Liu Zhe might have something that he could not tell him. After a moment of hesitation, he said,””I’m inviting some important guests to Ling Ji private kitchen tonight. If you’re not in a hurry, can we talk about it in two days?”

It would be rude to reject him directly, so Xia ruofei told Liu Zhe where he was treating him to tonight. At the same time, he told him that the guests were more important. This was actually a polite rejection.
