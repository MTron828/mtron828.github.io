3094 You’re awesome (2)

Chen Xuan didn’t want to continue his studies at all. He was here to gain experience, not to attend university. If he couldn’t come into contact with the actual work, then what was the point of coming to the company every day to work and idle?

If he wanted to have nothing to do, he might as well stay in the first heaven society! After all, the cultivation environment there was better.

Tao Ran laughed and said,”Chen Xuan, young people shouldn’t aim too high. Even an experienced programmer wouldn’t be able to understand the few documents I sent you without a week’s time. You don’t have any actual work experience. How could you have learned all of them in just three to four days?”

“Team leader, my memory has always been good. I really did remember everything.” “You can test me if you don’t believe me!” Chen Xuan replied.

Tao Ran couldn’t help but smile bitterly. ‘Test you? I’m a project leader now, why would I play such a childish game?

“There’s no need for that ...” Tao Ran waved his hand.

At this moment, Chen Xuan spoke up.”Oh right, team leader. I’ve been looking through our project document for the past two days regarding the back – end construction of the mall. Based on my own understanding, I’ve come up with a preliminary framework. Please give me some guidance when you’re free.”

“Okay, okay, okay ...” Tao Ran replied absent – mindedly. Then, his eyes widened and he turned around to glare at Chen Xuan.”What did you say?”

Chen Xuan also found Tao Ran’s reaction a little strange, but he still replied honestly,””I’ve ... Built a preliminary framework for the Commerce city’s back end ...”

“How is this possible?” Tao Ran cried out involuntarily,”in just three days, you still have to learn the project document. Even if you don’t eat, drink, or sleep, how much work can you do? You’re telling me you’ve built the background framework? Don’t tell me you have a problem with your understanding of the word “backstage”?”

Tao Ran’s project team was mainly in charge of building the background of the mall.

Paradise Mall only sold paradise company’s own products and would not be open to third – party sellers, so the background was not as complicated as those e – commerce businesses. After all, there was no need to develop the seller’s background.

However, this involved money transactions, so the security requirements were very high.

In addition, Feng Jing had specifically emphasized during the mobilization meeting after the establishment of the development Department that Paradise Mall had to do the best. Whether it was the front page or the back – end architecture, they had to be excellent.

Although it was a small background, it involved all aspects of content, including the interaction of the data between the front and the back, various interfaces, and the realization of various functions.

Tao Ran and his team had been working overtime these past few days to strengthen the back – end structure.

But now, Chen Xuan was telling Tao Ran that he had spent three days to come up with a framework for it. To Tao Ran, this was no different from a fantasy story.

If he could really do it, was he still human?

Chen Xuan wasn’t angered by Tao Ran’s suspicions. His expression remained neutral as he passed the USB drive to Tao Ran.””Team leader, I’m inexperienced. I’m sure I’ve made a lot of mistakes. If you have time, you can give me some pointers so that I can improve!”

Tao Ran looked at the small USB and felt that this was ridiculous.

However, he still took the USB drive and inserted it into his laptop. Even if he wanted to criticize her, he had to do it with reason! Hence, Tao Ran wanted to see what Chen Xuan’s so – called back – end framework was.

There was only one folder in the USB drive, and it didn’t take long for Tao Ran to find the back – end system framework that Chen Xuan had created.

He opened it and browsed through it briefly. A look of surprise suddenly appeared on his face. Putting everything else aside, at least the logic was very clear, and it did fit the requirements of the background in the project document.

Tao Ran could tell that Chen Xuan had put in a lot of effort in his understanding of the project, regardless of whether he was just a pretty face.

He then gave it a try. Naturally, Chen Xuan had only built a framework. The specific functions had yet to be realized. Otherwise, no matter how heaven – defying Chen Xuan was, he wouldn’t have been able to complete it in just three days.

However, even though it was only a framework, Tao Ran could still see many things.

He had a feeling that Chen Xuan’s back – end framework was even more logical than the ones that the old programmers in his project team had come up with.

Tao Ran couldn’t help but reveal a look of surprise.

Then, he opened the source code skillfully, and his eyes lit up again.

The structure of Chen Xuan’s code was neat and tidy, and the logic was clear. Furthermore, it was rather standardized. Just looking at it gave one a comfortable feeling. To a programmer, looking at such code was undoubtedly a form of enjoyment.

Tao Ran was enjoying it.

After reading a few dozen lines, he suddenly came to a realization. He turned to Chen Xuan and said,””This ... This is written in Java?”

Chen Xuan smiled as he nodded his head,”Yes, I am. I think it’s more appropriate to use Java to build the website’s background. ”

“I’m not talking about that!” Tao Ran said,”you ... Didn’t you say that you never learned Java?”

“Yup!” “However, after you mentioned it the last time, I’ve been learning it for the past few days ...” Chen Xuan said.

Tao Ran almost spat out a mouthful of blood. Big brother, You must be joking! He could learn to this extent in three days? I don’t believe you! You might as well tell me that sows can climb trees! It was still more reliable than mastering Java in three days.

“Xiao Chen ...” Tao Ran said weakly,”this joke is a little too much! So what if you’ve learned it, what does it matter? The more the leader understands your situation, the more reasonable the work arrangements will be, right?”

“I’ve really been ...” Chen Xuan was only halfway through his sentence when he shrugged helplessly.”Alright! I did come into contact with some knowledge related to Java in the past, but it was not systematic and comprehensive enough. These few days, I picked it up and tried it again. ”

Hearing that, Tao Ran revealed a look of realization and said,””This makes sense! Your original foundation must have been pretty good! Otherwise, it would be impossible to achieve this in such a short time!”

Seeing how Tao Ran looked as if he had found out the truth, Chen Xuan could only smile wryly in his heart. However, he wasn’t in the mood to dwell on this issue. Whatever Tao Ran said was the truth! As long as I can get to work as soon as possible, it’s fine.

Tao Ran continued,”Xiao Chen, this thing is pretty good. I’ll take a good look at it first. You can go back to your desk and study!” I’ll look for you if I have any problems. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Alright then!” Chen Xuan said.

He knew that this matter couldn’t be rushed. At least, the semi – finished product he produced had gained Tao Ran’s attention. He should be able to get some work arrangements next!

After Chen Xuan left, Tao Ran immediately turned his attention back to the computer screen. He couldn’t bear to part with the code that Chen Xuan had written. It was like a bookworm reading his favorite web novel. He couldn’t wait to read the latest chapter without sleeping.

With the mouse in his hand, Tao Ran stared at the computer screen with a dull expression.

When he went through the code Chen Xuan had written from start to finish, the shock he felt was indescribable.

If not for the fact that they had come up with the requirements for this platform after much discussion and that it was impossible for it to be the same as the other platforms, Tao Ran would have suspected that Chen Xuan had downloaded it from the internet.

As for spending money to hire someone to do it online, Tao Ran didn’t suspect a thing.

The reason was simple. Why would a person who could come up with such an impressive back – end architecture need to take on private jobs online? He would have gone to a large internet company to get a high salary and shares!

After reading the code and studying the architecture, Tao Ran sat at his desk in a daze for a while. Then, he suddenly stood up and shouted to a young man at his desk opposite him,””Qian bin, call the meeting room immediately. In half an hour, we’ll have a meeting with the project team!”
