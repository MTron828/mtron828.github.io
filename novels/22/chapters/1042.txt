He was naturally concerned about the news regarding the auction.

After so many days of hyping up, the abalone auction had become well – known in Hong Kong. Many media outlets had been reporting on it for many days.

The Hengfeng auction house’s press officer said that the auction had received more than 80 media applications for interviews, more than 50 of which came from both mainland and overseas.

On the forum, there were mixed reactions to the auction. Many people still couldn’t believe that someone could take out so many top – Quality abalones at once, and almost all of them were one – headed abalones.

Most of these skeptical people thought that this was a malicious hype. As for the publicity video and pictures, the photo editing software was so advanced these days. Sister ran could become fan Bingbing, so what was the big deal with editing the picture and video of the abalone?

On the other hand, the supporters felt that the Hengfeng auction house wouldn’t destroy its own reputation. After all, it was a well – known auction house! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

There were also a few netizens from the southeast province who expressed their trust in the Paradise brand. After all, the Paradise brand had become a synonym for high – end in the southeast province, especially in the capital of the southeast province, Sanshan city.

But after all, the influence of the Paradise company was not large enough, so the “positive and negative” parties did not mention much about the Paradise company. Some of them also criticized the Paradise company for maliciously hyping up the news.

Xia ruofei laughed as he browsed through the various comments on the internet. He was in a good mood.

After a while, a beautiful flight attendant walked to Xia ruofei’s side. She squatted down and kept her height at Xia ruofei ‘s. Then, she whispered,””Mr. Xia, the plane is about to take off. Please fasten your seat belt.”

Xia ruofei put down the iPad and smiled.””Alright!”

While Xia ruofei was putting on his seatbelt, the flight attendant walked back to his seat elegantly and put on his seatbelt.

Not long after, the plane trembled slightly and began to push backward.

In the process of pushing back, the engine of the plane began to turn. When it reached the runway, the cart was removed, and the luxurious Gulfstream G650 bus began to glide steadily.

The plane taxied all the way to the entrance of the runway and stopped steadily behind the yellow line, waiting for the take – off command.

Xia ruofei also looked out of the porthole. In the distance, a huge Airbus A380 was slowly descending. After a while, this Airbus A380 flew past their Gulfstream and landed smoothly on the runway.

The Gulfstream plane was obviously waiting for the plane to land.

After the A380 landed, Xia ruofei’s Gulfstream was immediately allowed to enter the runway.

The plane taxied slowly again, made a big turn at the end of the runway, and firmly aimed at the center line of the runway.

At this time, the Airbus giant plane had left the runway through the right taxiway. The Gulfstream business jet, which had been ready for a long time, immediately stepped on the gas to take off after receiving the take – off command.

Xia ruofei felt the plane shake slightly before it started to accelerate on the runway. He also felt an obvious push on his back.

This standard runway was too long for the Gulfstream G650. It did not need such a long distance to take off or land.

After gliding at high speed for a few hundred meters, the plane reached the speed of lifting the wheels. The nose of the plane lifted up gently, and the entire streamlined luxury business jet rose lightly into the sky.

The Gulfstream commercial plane flew at a higher altitude than ordinary passenger planes, so there were very few bumps during the flight. Moreover, it was extremely comfortable, which was a completely different feeling from riding a passenger plane.

The Gulfstream G650’s maximum cruising speed reached Mach 0.925, which was close to the speed of sound and far exceeded that of ordinary passenger airliners. Therefore, the entire flight from San Shan to Hong Kong only took a little more than an hour.

Two – thirds of this time was used for climbing and approaching.

When the luxurious private plane landed smoothly at the Hong Kong airport, Xia ruofei could not help but feel a little emotional.

“I must buy a plane like this when I have the chance! This is the real high – end enjoyment!” Xia ruofei thought to himself.

Every time they took a private jet, Xia ruofei could not help but feel a little envious.

And now, he was not far from owning a private jet, especially when the peach Garden vegetables in Australia began to produce in large quantities. The profits every month would be tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of us dollars, so buying a private jet was not a big deal.

Of course, a high – end business jet like the Gulfstream G650 could not be owned immediately with money. Every Gulfstream series business jet was custom – made according to the customer’s requirements. After the order was placed, the production line could only be lined up.

Yes, they were queuing.

There were many rich people in the world. If someone else’s order happened to be in front of you, you might have to wait even longer.

If they were unlucky, they might have to wait for two to three years.

The Hong Kong airport was very busy. The Gulfstream G650 was arranged to Park at a remote parking lot. However, Hengfeng group’s MA Zhiming, Hengfeng auction house’s manager Dong Jiajun, Feng ke, and others had already arrived at the parking lot.

The moment Xia ruofei got off the plane, he saw the people who had come to pick him up.

A burly man in a black suit took the thermal lunch box from the flight attendant and immediately put it in the car, storing it in the refrigerator.

“Xia Sheng, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen you. You’re still as elegant as ever!” Ma Zhiming greeted with a smile in Mandarin with a strong Cantonese accent.

“Hahaha! Mr. MA, how are aunt Huixin and Huanhuan?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile.

“Thanks to you, Huixin and Huanhuan are both very good!” Ma Zhiming smiled and said,”when Huanhuan heard that xiasheng was coming, she even made a fuss about coming to the airport to pick her up! However, she just happens to have calligraphy class today, so I can only let Huixin stay at home to coax her!”

Huanhuan was diagnosed with severe autism. At that time, Xia ruofei did not have the prescription for the heart – nourishing soup. He had used the petal solution of the spirit Heart Flower to cure Huanhuan. Later, Xia ruofei happened to save MA Xiong from the brink of death when he had a serious cerebral hemorrhage. Hence, the entire Ma family was grateful to Xia ruofei from the bottom of their hearts.

After Xia ruofei and Ma Zhiming exchanged some pleasantries, he turned to Feng Jing and said with a smile,”President Feng, it’s been hard on you these past few days!”

He could see the fatigue on Feng Jing’s face. He could imagine how intense her work must have been in Hong Kong.

“It’s nothing, Chairman!”Feng Rao smiled. Just thinking about the auction this time makes me feel full of energy!”

“Hahaha! It’s because you’re in Hong Kong that I’m not worried. I only came here when the auction was about to start!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”President Feng, I’ll give you a big red packet after the auction is over!”

“Alright! “I’m not going to stand on ceremony with you ...” Feng Jing said with a smile.”The housing prices in San Shan are getting more and more expensive. I want to buy a big house as soon as possible!”

“Then all the more reason for you to work hard!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”the better the company’s performance, the more bonus you will get at the end of the year! If we can make it into the top 500 in one night, buying 10 villas will be a piece of cake!”

The group of them walked to the car, talking and laughing.

Ma Zhiming had brought an extended version of a Bentley. The dried abalones had already been placed in the Bentley’s ice bar.

Xia ruofei, Ma Zhiming, and Feng Jing sat in the Bentley while the bodyguards and staff sat in two other cars. The group of people left the airport very quickly.

MA Xiong had arranged for Xia ruofei to stay at the Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel in Hong Kong where the auction would be held the next day.

This was also a high – end brand under the Hengfeng Hotel Group. The truffle auction that Xia ruofei attended in Shen Cheng city was also held at Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel.

After the car left the Hong Kong airport, it passed by the North Island Highway and the green sunflower highway before finally arriving at the Hengfeng Jiahua Hotel, which was located by the seaside and overlooked the Victoria port.

When the car slowly drove into the hotel lobby, Xia ruofei saw the founder and chairman of Hengfeng group, MA Xiong, standing at the entrance of the hotel, waiting for him. He could not sit still.
