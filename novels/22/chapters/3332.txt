Translator: 5496903The endless fog suddenly shrouded the middle – Level Mirage beast.

It turned pale with fright and subconsciously retreated. However, under the effects of the array, all directions were already in chaos, and the more it retreated, the deeper it sank.

This was how a trap array worked. Once one was trapped in it, it was impossible to get out.

At this time, Xia ruofei was still in the illusion created by the intermediate – Level Shen beast. However, the illusion could not change directions. It only affected people’s minds and caused them to think that their environment had changed. The higher the level of the illusion, the more realistic the environment would be. The most powerful illusion was that even if the trapped person knew that everything was fake, they still couldn’t resist it and couldn’t help but sink into it.

For example, the mid – level Shen beast that Xia ruofei had killed earlier had released its strongest illusion before its death. Xia ruofei knew that this was an illusion created by the Mirage beast. However, if he stayed for a little longer, he would still die in the illusion of the heat. This was the terrifying part of the illusion.

This level of illusion had a limited effect on Xia ruofei. Although he could not see through the whims, he could still maintain his consciousness.

Xia ruofei decided to close his eyes. He was already aware of his surroundings, so it was easier for him to control the formation if he closed his eyes.

As soon as the mid – grade Shen beast fell into the trap array, Xia ruofei could sense that the array had been activated. There must be various energy fluctuations. As the controller of the array, Xia ruofei could at least know that the mid – grade Shen beast had fallen into the trap array even if he could not accurately determine its location.

Hence, Xia ruofei closed his eyes and continued to activate the array with his hand seals, directly activating the maximum attack power of the array.

Xia ruofei had just dealt with a low – Level Mirage beast and was very experienced. He did not hesitate and attacked without caring about the cost.

He also wanted to see how big the gap was between an elementary and intermediate Mirage beast. If the black light of the trap & kill array could deal with the intermediate Mirage beast, then he would have an effective method and naturally have more confidence in completing the next task.

Streaks of black light shot out from the core of the spell formation and blotted out the sky and covered the earth, almost enveloping the entire spell formation.

There were only a few positions that avoided the attack of the black light. Xia ruofei’s position was one of the key positions.

In theory, the middle – Level Mirage beasts trapped in the array also had a chance to step into the array eye, but the probability was very, very small.

Of course, even if the mid – level Mirage beast saved the Galaxy in its previous life and stepped into the eye of the array with unbelievable luck, it did not know about it at all. Moreover, the attack of the black light looked fierce and fierce, and it passed through the eye of the array. If it did not know in advance that it was the blind spot of the attack of the black light, no matter how strong its mental strength was, it would not be able to help but avoid the attack. Once it left the eye of the array, it was impossible to go back.

Therefore, Xia ruofei was not worried that the limited array cores would become a sanctuary for the intermediate – Level Mirage beasts.

On the contrary, he was worried about whether the attack power of the trap and kill array was enough to kill the middle – Level Mirage beast. After all, although the physical defense of a mid – grade Mirage beast was weak, its speed was still very fast, even not weaker than that of a Star Beast.

As for the middle – Level Mirage beast, the trap and kill array was filled with white fog, so when the black light appeared in his sight, it was actually very close.

This trap & kill array’s Black Light Attack was also carefully designed. When it was just released, its speed was not particularly fast. The main thing was that it was basically silent. Only after flying for a period of time, when it was basically within the vision of the trapped person, would it suddenly accelerate, making it impossible to guard against.

Seeing this, the middle – Level Mirage beast was naturally shocked. With its snow – White fur, it suddenly exerted its speed to the extreme, twisted its small body, and avoided eight black lights in the air.

However, the ninth ray of light followed. At this time, it was already exhausted. Its body was in the air and had no place to borrow strength. It could only twist its waist with all its strength to Dodge.

Even though it managed to Dodge it, the black light still grazed past its snow – White fur.

Suddenly, a cloud of green smoke rose and the White fur on the middle – Level Mirage beast began to burn ...

The middle – Level Mirage beast was so angry that its eyes almost popped out. Taking advantage of the opening when the black light attacked, it fell to the ground and kept rolling, trying to put out the fire.

Unfortunately, the flames produced by the black light were not ordinary flames. Once this flame burned, it was like maggots in one’s bones. No matter if it pounced, rolled, or even hid in the water, it would still burn more and more.

It could be said that as long as it came into contact with a spark, it would be very difficult to extinguish it. The only way was to hold on until its energy was exhausted.

The flame on the Mirage beast’s body was getting stronger and stronger. It let out a shrill scream. While it was rolling, the next wave of black light attacks came. This time, the Mirage beast was no longer as agile as before. Several black lights drilled into the Mirage beast directly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Compared with star beasts, the body of a middle – Level Mirage beast was indeed very fragile. It was only a little stronger than the body of a beginner – Level Mirage beast, but there was a limit to its strength. Therefore, the black light penetrated the body of the intermediate – Level Mirage beast without any resistance, leaving a shocking wound.
