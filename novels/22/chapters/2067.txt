2068 Returning the favor (2)

Lui hai didn’t dare to ask more, and said hurriedly,””I brought it, do you want to use it?”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Lui hai pulled out a gun from his waist without any hesitation. He grabbed the gun barrel and handed the handle to Xia ruofei.

Then, he took out a silencer from the holster and said with a smile,””Mr. Xia, if you want to test the gun, I suggest you wear this. The police in doling city have been on high alert recently, and the sound of gunfire might cause some trouble.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei took the silencer with a smile and slowly put it on the muzzle.

Xia ruofei unloaded the clip, looked at it, and immediately loaded it again. Then, he skillfully pulled the trigger and loaded the first bullet into the chamber.

Lui hai and the others all fixed their eyes on Xia ruofei, not knowing what he was up to.

At this moment, Xia ruofei, who was standing beside lui hai, suddenly raised his gun and aimed at his head.

This sudden change shocked Lu zhengfeng and the rest. Their subconscious reaction was to take out their guns and point them at Xia ruofei.

“Put down your guns!” Lui hai was calm. He glared at LV zhengfeng and the others, saying,”who gave you the courage to point a gun at Mr. Xia!”

“But ...” Lu zhengfeng mumbled a few times but still put down his gun resentfully. However, the way he looked at Xia ruofei was no longer respectful. Instead, there was a trace of killing intent.

After all, even though Xia ruofei had a powerful background, he was not the leader of the Hong sect. Moreover, he was pointing a gun at his boss ‘head. How could the hot – blooded Lu zhengfeng have a good impression of Xia ruofei?

Xia ruofei was still looking at lui hai with a smile, waiting to see his reaction.

Facing the black muzzles, lui hai didn’t show any fear, but said calmly,””Mr. Xia, did I offend you in any way? If I’ve done anything wrong or offended you, please tell me. Even if I die, I can’t be a muddled ghost!”

“You didn’t offend me,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.”You didn’t do anything wrong. It’s just that I suddenly want to try this gun ...”

After saying this, Xia ruofei pulled the trigger without any hesitation before lui hai could react.

Seeing Xia ruofei’s movement, lui Hai’s pupils contracted. He felt all the hair on his body stood up and was disheartened.

At such a close distance, and it was aimed at the head, lui hai had no chance to Dodge. He didn’t even have time to blink his eyes.

Lu zhengfeng and the others did not expect Xia ruofei to shoot directly. They had already lowered their guns and could not react in time.

All this happened in a flash. Under the sudden tension, it was as if time slowed down. Lui hai even saw the weak flame coming out of the muzzle and the bullet flying toward the forehead ...

However, when lui hai was lamenting that he was a fool, a light flashed, and the bullet slowed down as if it had fallen into a swamp.

The bullet was like a high – speed drill, constantly spinning forward. After it fell into the Halo, although its speed slowed down for a moment, it still persevered in drilling.

However, the resistance of the Halo was too great. By the time the bullet came out, it had completely lost its speed.

In the end, the bullet lost all its kinetic energy before it touched lui Hai’s forehead and fell to the floor. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lu zhengfeng’s face was filled with anger and madness. When he saw this magical scene, his expression froze.

The other core members of the Hong sect’s branch in Turin were the same. They looked like they had seen a ghost.

Of course, lui hai felt it the most directly.

He could even see the bullet getting bigger and bigger in his field of vision because the speed of the bullet had been reduced too much, as if it was in slow motion.

From despair to disbelief, lui Hai’s mood was like a roller coaster during the bullet’s movement. He was stunned and didn’t even notice that the bullet landed on his feet and then jumped up.

The meeting room was silent. Everyone felt like they were in a dream.

Xia ruofei, who was the only one awake, chuckled and threw his gun on the conference table.””This gun’s performance is not bad!”

Lui hai then came back to his senses, stammering,””Mr ... Mr. Xia, what ... What is going on? Why would the bullet ...”

“Take a look at that jade pendant!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

Lui hai woke up from his dream and put his hand into his pocket. But the jade pendant was not the same as before. It had been broken into five or six pieces and lost its luster.

Lui hai was dumbfounded. After a long while, he asked excitedly,””Mr. Xia, this ... This jade pendant can resist gunshots?”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you’ve seen it. If a large – caliber sniper rifle were to shoot from a few hundred meters away, the effect would be similar to the previous one.” However, this thing can only withstand one attack. Look, it shattered after one attack ...”

Xia ruofei could create this kind of basic protective array in minutes. Of course, its effect was not as good as the protective amulets he gave to little Huanhuan and the others. It was basically a one – time use and was limited to conventional hot weapons. If he were unlucky enough to meet a cultivator, this level of protective array would not be able to withstand a single blow.

Last night, Xia ruofei had decided to meet lui hai and the others today. They had helped him a lot this time. Now that he realized that they might be in danger, he decided to make friends with them.

If lui hai and the others were in danger of being assassinated by the glory society because they wanted to help him, Xia ruofei would give them one more life and end this karma.

Therefore, after Monica fell asleep from exhaustion, Xia ruofei went to the washroom and spent a few minutes. He cut some jade pieces from the space and made them into these jade pendants. He was going to give them to lui hai and the others.

Lu zhengfeng and the others also revealed looks of disbelief. They took out the jade pendant from their bodies in unison.

They had never even heard of such a treasure, let alone seen it.

However, Li Yifu had always been a legend in the Hong sect. His father, Li Jiu Zhou, was even more legendary. There were many legends and proofs that Li Jiu Zhou was the disciple of an immortal in the Hong sect.

Therefore, Lu zhengfeng and the others were not unable to accept such a phenomenon that could not be explained by science. After all, they had Li Jiu Zhou’s legends as the foundation, and they had seen it with their own eyes today!

Lui Hai’s mood was even more complicated. On one hand, he felt that he had survived a disaster, but on the other hand, he wanted to cry but had no tears.

You can just tell us directly, we will definitely believe you. Why do you have to be serious! Now, such a good life – saving weapon had completed its historical mission after proving its awesomeness. It had been completely reduced to a useless rock ...

Seeing the Jade pendants in the hands of Lyu zhengfeng and the others, Lyu hai couldn’t help but wail in his heart,”Why? Why am I always the one getting hurt?

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but laugh and scold,”ah hai, look at you!” Wasn’t there another one on the table? That’s yours!”

Lui hai seemed to come back to life. He rushed over and grabbed the jade pendant, holding it like a treasure, and giggled,””Thank you! Thank you! Mr. Xia!”

“Remember to bring it with you, don’t lose it! Also, this thing can only protect you once, so whatever happened in the past, you have to do it again in the future. Make sure to take good care of your safety. ” Xia ruofei said indifferently.
