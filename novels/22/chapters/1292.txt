“I’m not betting with you!”Feng Rao laughed. Who knows what you’re up to?”

Liu Qian, who was standing at the side, could not help but smile.

Xia ruofei had never put on any airs in the company. In addition, he was close in age to everyone else. Hence, Liu Qian and the other ordinary employees admired Xia ruofei more than they feared him. They would not keep quiet just because he was the boss of the company.

Of course, this was also the corporate culture that Xia ruofei advocated.

Xia ruofei scratched his head and said,”what crooked ideas could I have?” Boss Feng, you really don’t want to hear what I want to bet on?”

“Then tell me!” “But don’t set me up!” Feng Jing said.

“I guarantee that it’s fair and just. Besides, you might have a good chance of winning!” Xia ruofei laughed and said,”we’re betting that Jun real estate will lower the price by at least 20 million and will contact us within two days. If I don’t meet either of the above conditions, I’ll lose!”

Feng Rao’s beautiful eyes were filled with wonder as she said,””Chairman, do you have any information that I don’t know? You’re really that sure?”

Xia ruofei laughed.”That’s none of your business. I’m just asking you. Do you dare to take the bet?”

“Fine, let’s bet!” Feng Rao said coyly. But don’t make such a big bet! I’m just a bitter girl ...”

Xia ruofei laughed,”sure, sure, sure!” If I lose, I’ll treat you to a big meal. How about Ling Ji’s private kitchen? Even Liu Qian is included!”

“Stingy!” Feng Rao immediately said. Who doesn’t know that Ling Ji private kitchen is run by your wife’s family? Do you think you can spend money to eat there? If you want to treat us, please treat us to seafood!”

The seafood restaurant was a chain self – Service seafood restaurant. It was located in a very high – end position, and the per capita consumption was at least 588 Yuan. Some high – end seafood that was not included in the self – Service category had to be ordered separately. It was normal to eat a few thousand Yuan for a meal.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you really don’t know your stuff!” How much does seafood manufacturing cost? Do you know the Ling Ji private kitchen’s Secret recipe,’Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’? You have to wait at least a month to make a reservation. Just a small jar of ‘Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’ is enough for you to eat a few times of seafood ...”

“President Feng, President Xia is right!” Liu Qian quickly said,”recently, Ling Ji’s private kitchen’s Secret recipe,’Buddha Jumps Over the Wall’, has been very popular on the Food Forum. It’s definitely the most popular online food in recent times! I’ve wanted to go there for a long time, but I’m short of money and it’s too difficult to make a reservation ...”

At this point, Liu Qian laughed in embarrassment.

Feng Rao glanced at Liu Qian and scolded her with a smile,”Little glutton! You’re betraying us!”

Then, she looked at Xia ruofei and said,””Alright! Then Ling Ji private kitchen! What if we lose?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t worry, I won’t let your wallet bleed!” If I win, I won’t make things difficult for you. You can just call me ‘brother ruofei’!”

Feng Rao blushed and rolled her eyes at Xia ruofei.””You’re just a little brat, whose brother do you want to be?”

Liu Qian cheered,”this is a good deal!” I agree!”

Liu Qian and Xia ruofei were of the same age, so it didn’t matter to her. On the other hand, Feng Jing was a few years older than Xia ruofei. In addition, she already had a slight affection for Xia ruofei, so she was naturally even more embarrassed. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Xia ruofei laughed,”I didn’t ask you to keep calling me that!” It’s just a call, it’s a sure – win deal! Don’t you want to consider it?”

Actually, Xia ruofei was just having a bad taste. After all, they always addressed each other formally at work. He just wanted to tease Feng Jing. He was looking forward to the scene where this career woman, who was extremely devoted to her work, would call him “brother”.

Feng Jing saw Xia ruofei’s evil smile and gritted her teeth.””Let’s bet then!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”Liu Qian, be a witness! Otherwise, you won’t get a share of the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall soup!”

Liu Qian quickly nodded her head like a chicken pecking at rice. Seeing that her assistant had been bribed so quickly, Feng Jing was so angry that she gritted her teeth.

At this moment, the car had already driven over. She took the lead and walked towards the Mercedes – Benz.

Xia ruofei also laughed and quickly followed.

Although the first round of negotiations had failed in a short time, Xia ruofei was very relaxed.

......

Two days later.

Xia ruofei was sitting in his office, leisurely browsing the news.

Feng Rao knocked on the door and walked in with a helpless expression on her face.

Xia ruofei raised his head and asked,”boss Feng, what’s going on?” Why do you look like you have nothing to live for?”

“You won ...” Feng Rao said listlessly.

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment before he reacted. His eyes revealed a trace of excitement as he quickly asked,””Did bojun real estate contact you?”

Feng Rao nodded helplessly and said,”Although I really want to tell you the news tomorrow, my professional ethics don’t allow me to do so ... I’m willing to accept my loss!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,””Then quickly call Liu Qian over! It’s time for you to honor your bet!”

“As the boss of the company, shouldn’t you be more concerned about bojun’s price?” Feng Jing asked, her eyes wide.

Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Since you said I won, then the price is within my prediction range. It doesn’t matter if it’s a little higher or lower!”
