“Oh? I’d like to hear more details!” Chen Xuan said hurriedly.

In fact, Xia ruofei was the one in charge of cracking the token. Even seniors like Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha were used to letting Xia ruofei make the decisions.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I believe everyone has seen that the score is extremely simple. There are basically only two tones, seven notes, and a number ‘ 0’ that seems to be a beat symbol. Logically, such a simple score is not enough to form a song.”

At this point, Xia ruofei paused and continued,””And in reality? Everyone has seen it with their own eyes. Not only did it form a song, but even with such a simple score, the tone of the simple humming is extremely beautiful ... So, I think we can start from the simplest direction! First find the correct score, then consider whether the instrument and other factors will affect the song. ”

“That makes sense ...” Chen Xuan nodded his head after a moment of silence.”How do we do it?” he asked.

“With the help of music arrangement software!” Xia ruofei said without hesitation,”input our score into the music arrangement software according to our judgment and different situations. Then, we’ll produce several versions of the music. We’ll just listen to the effect directly!”

“Good idea!” Chen Xuan said.

Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha looked at each other and smiled wryly at the same time. They didn’t know anything about music arrangement software. These days, they felt like they were fools and didn’t know anything.

Xia ruofei took out his laptop from the spirit map space. He first paid for a professional music arrangement software, installed it on the computer, and learned a little.

This kind of professional software usually didn’t have a particularly good user experience, and it was a bit difficult to operate.

However, Xia ruofei found a few video tutorials on the official website of the software, watched them, and actually operated the software for a while. Soon, he had a basic understanding of how to use the software.

Xia ruofei tried to compose a short piece of music and smiled at Chen Xuan.””Brother Chen, you were talking about the problem with the instruments. This software can simulate the sounds of all kinds of instruments! From the chimes to the zither and lute ... There’s everything you can think of!”

“That’s great!” Chen Xuan chuckled.”Let’s decide on the song first, then use an instrument to simulate it. We should be able to find the most accurate version very quickly!”

“Then I’ll get to work first!” Xia ruofei said with a smile as he stretched his neck.

The rest of the work was actually quite boring.

All he had to do was to input the score into the music arrangement software according to the numerical combination in the document.

Xia ruofei first listed out a few plans on the paper, mainly involving the different situations represented by negative numbers and some minor adjustments. In short, they were all guesses. They had to form music pieces through software and listen to them all to find the most suitable or correct one.

Of course, this did not need to be simulated by a supercomputer, because only about 20 combinations were listed in the end.

Besides, Xia ruofei didn’t have to type more than 20 times. Each time, he would have to type almost 4000 combinations of numbers. It was quite tiring to type once. If he had to type more than 20 times, it would be a little unbearable.

There wasn’t much of a problem with physical strength, but it was too boring.

In reality, Xia ruofei had only managed to key in every single tune into the music arrangement software the first time.

Then, he made another copy of the plan.

The next 20 or so plans were all modified based on this.

This was because most of these 20 or so combinations were actually the same. The parts that needed to be changed were different, but the proportion was not very high.

Of course, the overall workload was still very heavy.

Xia ruofei did not finish the work for the entire afternoon.

Everyone went to the backyard to have dinner, and then Xia ruofei continued to work through the night.

It was not until the second half of the night that Xia ruofei entered all 20 combinations into the music arrangement software.

He spent some more time checking through everything.

When it was confirmed, the horizon also revealed the dawn of dawn.

Xia ruofei had stayed up all night again.

Now, everyone’s trust in Xia ruofei was even higher. Last night, they did not stay in Xia ruofei’s room for the entire time. They left at 90 PM, leaving Xia ruofei, Song Wei, and Ling Qingxue behind.

Of course, Xia ruofei could not be sure if Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha, or even if Chen Xuan was completely at ease with him. He could not rule out the possibility that they had used their spiritual power to monitor him after they returned to their room at night.

Hence, during Xia ruofei’s entire working day, he was basically typing in the simplified version of the music score. He did not even listen to a small part of it to prevent Li Xia from not being able to explain it clearly.

Anyway, Xia ruofei had no intention of monopolizing the food. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

If he wanted to test the effect, it would be better to wait until everyone was present.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue did not go to bed until the second half of the night. In the morning, when Xia ruofei finished inputting all the combinations and stood up to stretch, the two of them woke up.

Both Song Wei and Ling Qingxue felt sorry for Xia ruofei, but he was happy and did not look tired at all.

On the contrary, after completing a task that did not require much skill but was extremely cumbersome, Xia ruofei felt a sense of relief.
