“Master,” Luo Qingfeng said quickly,”I will remember this. I will manage it strictly when I return. I will not let you down!”

Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng talked as they walked. Soon, they found Zheng Yongshou, who was waiting at the same place.

Zheng Yongshou saw Luo Qingfeng following behind Xia ruofei respectfully and knew that Xia ruofei must have succeeded.

He quickly walked up to her.

Xia ruofei had already set up a formation nearby, so there was no danger for Zheng Yongshou to walk around. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Master!” Zheng Yongshou first greeted Xia ruofei respectfully, then looked at Luo Qingfeng awkwardly and called out unnaturally,”master ...”

Luo Qingfeng nodded and said,””Yongshou, let bygones be bygones. We’re all working for our master now, so we just have to do our part.”

Xia ruofei also smiled and said,””Whatever happened between you two will remain the same in the future. I don’t want this matter to affect your relationship. Qingfeng is right, we served our own Masters before, but now we’re all in the same pot, so don’t hold any grudges. ”

“Yes, master!” The two of them quickly said in unison.

Xia ruofei brought the two of them to the project department building. Wang Boshan was still waiting for news in the building.

Of course, he did not know that Xia ruofei had already sentenced him to death. Even if he knew, under the effect of the soul seal, he would still be willing to die.

On the way, Xia ruofei took out the satellite phone from the spirit map space and called Li Yifu, who was waiting in the open sea. He informed Li Yifu that the alarm had been lifted and that he should Return to Paradise Island immediately.

Li Yifu couldn’t help but be overjoyed when he heard this, and he repeatedly cheered.

Xia ruofei brought Luo Qingfeng and Zheng Yongshou back to the project department building. There was no one else on the island except for them. Xia ruofei found a random reception room and called Luo Qingfeng and the other two over. He explained the next step to them.

Just like what he had told Luo Qingfeng, he would arrange for Wang Boshan to return to the star Seizer sect, and Luo Qingfeng would choose someone to take over his position.

Wang Boshan would never disobey Xia ruofei’s orders. Besides, it was definitely better to return to the sect than to stay in the secular world. Therefore, Wang Boshan agreed with a smile and patted his chest to promise that he would teach the senior brother who would take over his position as soon as possible to smoothly hand over stars Corporation.

As for Luo Qingfeng, he naturally returned to the star Seizer sect to take charge. Zheng Yongshou’s array Dao was quite good, so Xia ruofei chose to let him stay on Peach Blossom Island to help.

The two of them naturally accepted the order with pleasure, especially Zheng Yongshou, who felt that he had been valued by his master, and was so excited that his face turned red.

“Martial granduncle! I’m back!” Li Yifu’s voice came from outside the door.

“Come in!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Li Yifu pushed the door open and entered. He immediately looked at Luo Qingfeng. When he saw Luo Qingfeng standing respectfully in front of Xia ruofei, he knew that this operation must have been a great success.

When he thought about how even a golden core cultivator had become his grand uncle-master’s servant, which was equivalent to indirectly controlling a cultivation sect, Li Yifu couldn’t suppress the excitement in his heart. Even though he was already in his eighties or nineties, his excitement was still evident in his words.
