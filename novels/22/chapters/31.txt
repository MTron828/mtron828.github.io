Chapter 32: Mayor Tian’s Kindness

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Really?” Xia Ruofei was also very surprised. This was really a coincidence!

Xia Ruofei then asked with concern, “Mayor Tian, how is Professor Tian now?”

Tian Huilan said.

“There’s nothing serious anymore. The doctor said that it’s all thanks to the timely treatment. Otherwise, he might not have made it to the hospital. So, Little Xia, our entire family has to thank you!”

Xia Ruofei said humbly.

“It’s nothing. I just happened to be there. Anyone in that situation would have helped.”

Seeing that Xia Ruofei was still neither servile nor overbearing, and that he did not take credit for being her father’s savior, Tian Huilan’s impression of him improved.

Tian Huilan said.

“Little Xia, you can’t say that. I heard that my father was in a very dangerous condition when his illness acted up. It was you who gave him medicine to stabilize his condition. At that time, you didn’t even leave your name. My father kept reminding me to find you and thank you!”

Xia Ruofei smiled faintly and said. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Mayor Tian, it’s really nothing. I just happened to have some Chinese medicine that I concocted myself. It has a certain effect on myocardial infarction. At that time, the situation was urgent, so I took the initiative to give Professor Tian some. Fortunately, the effect was good.”

“You know how to concoct Chinese medicine yourself?” Tian Huilan asked in surprise.

“I used to work with an old Chinese doctor before I joined the army,” Xia Ruofei said.

“How impressive!” Tian Huilan praised. Then, she said, “Little Xia, after my father is discharged in a few days, our entire family wants to treat you to a meal to express our gratitude.”

Xia Ruofei hurriedly waved his hand.

“No, no, it’s fine. It’s really nothing. You don’t have to be so kind.”

Tian Huilan smiled and said.

“It’s just a helping hand for you, but it’s a life-saving favor for us! Besides, my father gave me an order. If I can’t invite you, I won’t be able to explain myself when I go back…”

At this point, Xia Ruofei could only say helplessly.

“All right, then…”

Tian Huilan said with satisfaction.

“I’ll get my secretary, Little Wu, to pick you up then!”

Then, Tian Huilan looked thoughtfully at Xia Ruofei, who was dressed simply, and said.

“Little Xia, you’ve just retired from the military, so you probably don’t have a job yet, right? Also, are you facing any difficulties in life? If you need help, feel free to ask. As long as it doesn’t violate the rules of the organization, I’ll do it for you!”

Tian Huilan wanted to return the favor.

When Xia Ruofei saved Professor Tian, he had never thought of a repayment, so he subconsciously wanted to reject Tian Huilan’s kindness. However, at this moment, a thought flashed through his mind, and he swallowed his words.

He thought for a moment, then said.

“Mayor Tian, if it’s possible, I really have something to trouble you with…”

“Go ahead.” Tian Huilan smiled.

It was good that Xia Ruofei had something to ask of her. The mayor did not want to owe him a huge favor.

Xia Ruofei said.

“Mayor Tian, I’d like you to help me contact a good high school in Three Mountains City. I want to arrange for a friend to transfer here.”

Tian Huilan thought that Xia Ruofei would ask for a job or something, but she was surprised that he made such a request.

Tian Huilan asked curiously.

“May I know who this friend of yours is?”

Xia Ruofei smiled and said.

“Of course. Actually, you’ve seen her just now. She’s Lin Qiao. She’s the sister of my comrade-in-arms, Lin Hu. She’ll be taking the college entrance examination next semester. Some time ago, she even dropped out of school to take care of her sick mother…”

“I think it would be good for her to continue studying at a reputable high school in the city. Moreover, Auntie will be recuperating in Three Mountains City during this period of time. It will also be convenient for Lin Qiao and her daughter to live together when she goes to school in the city.”

Xia Ruofei paused, then said.

“Mayor Tian, I personally have no difficulties that I can’t overcome. I hope you can help me with this matter. Of course, if it makes things difficult for you, then forget it…”

Xia Ruofei’s meaning was very clear. If Tian Huilan helped solve the problem of Lin Qiao’s school transfer, then this favor would be repaid.

Tian Huilan had been in the bureaucracy for so many years, how could she not tell?

But because of this, she admired Xia Ruofei even more.

If it were someone else, they would definitely want to build a relationship with the mayor or at least gain some benefits for themselves. In fact, with Tian Huilan’s current status, it was easy for her to help Xia Ruofei get a job as a civil servant. After all, Xia Ruofei was a retired soldier and a city resident. According to the organization’s policy, he could be assigned to a job position.

However, Xia Ruofei’s attitude had always been neither servile nor overbearing. The only thing he asked for was actually for the sister of his comrade.

Tian Huilan looked at Xia Ruofei approvingly and said.

“Alright, I’ll help!”

After saying that, she immediately instructed her secretary, Wu Liqian, who was sitting in the front passenger seat.

“Little Wu, as soon as you go to work tomorrow, settle this matter and get Bureau Chief Liu from the Education Bureau to personally handle it! First, find out which high school is the best for the third year of high school. Then, directly settle the transfer procedures!”

“Yes, Mayor Tian,” Wu Liqian said immediately.

Xia Ruofei was overjoyed and hurriedly said.

“Thank you so much, Mayor Tian!”

Tian Huilan waved her hand and said with a faint smile.

“This is just a small matter. It’s really nothing compared to your life-saving grace… By the way, Little Xia, which aspect of the job are you more interested in? I can arrange for you to work in the corresponding department. The local authorities will still be very welcome to you outstanding soldiers.”

Tian Huilan also admired Xia Ruofei’s character, so she planned to help him.

Unexpectedly, Xia Ruofei only smiled faintly and said.

“I appreciate Mayor Tian’s kindness, but I might be planning to start my own business and don’t want to work in a government organization anymore.”

“I see…” Tian Huilan was slightly disappointed, but she quickly smiled and said, “That’s not bad. Young people are driven. It’s good to start your own business.”

As they spoke, the car had already driven into Three Mountains City.

After learning that Xia Ruofei was preparing to find a hotel to settle Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao, Tian Huilan immediately instructed the driver to go straight to the city government’s guest house. She also asked her secretary, Wu Liqian, to call and arrange a suite.

Tian Huilan and Niu Tao’s car arrived at the city government guest house one after another. Tian Huilan specially arranged for Wu Liqian to stay behind before getting into the car and leaving. Secretary Lin of the Provincial Party Committee was still waiting to hear her report on the process of handling that day’s matter!

Niu Tao originally wanted to have a good chat with Xia Ruofei about the troops, but that day was obviously not the right time, so after taking down Xia Ruofei’s phone number, he also got into the car and left the city government guest house.

With the mayor making the arrangements personally, the government guesthouse naturally had the room ready.

Wu Liqian asked the guest house to prepare a fruit platter and dinner before politely leaving.

Before leaving, Wu Liqian expressed that she had already informed the staff. They could stay there for as many days as they wanted. Xia Ruofei also smiled and expressed his gratitude.

Of course, he would not let the two of them stay in the government guest house forever. After Lin Qiao’s school was finalized the next day, he planned to rent a house near the school for the mother and daughter to settle down. That would be the case for the next six months. Everything could be discussed after Lin Qiao’s college entrance examination.

Dinner was sent directly to the room. Xia Ruofei ate with Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao. During the meal, Xia Ruofei talked about the school transfer to the city. When Lin Qiao heard that she could go to school and take care of her mother, she agreed without much hesitation.

After chatting with the mother and daughter for a while, Xia Ruofei bade farewell and left the city government guest house.

He walked back through the night to his rental apartment in the shanty town.

Hu Zi’s mother’s illness would soon be cured, and Xia Ruofei felt a huge weight lifted off his shoulders. Now, all his thoughts were on the succulents. When he returned home, he carefully locked the door, then took out the spiritual map that he had hidden close to his body and entered the space with the DSLR camera.

Xia Ruofei was prepared to take photos of the succulent seedlings overnight, then display them up on his online store to sell and officially start his money-making plan.
