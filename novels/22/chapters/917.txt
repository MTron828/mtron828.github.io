Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.”I’m almost fully recovered after a nap. I think I should strike while the iron is hot and do another treatment. The plane will land in about two hours.”

“Isn’t this too hard on you?”Tang Yitian asked, touched.

Xia ruofei smiled and waved his hand,”it’s fine!” The sooner the blocked meridians in little Haoran’s body are resolved, the sooner his physique will return to normal. If it wasn’t for the fact that he might not be able to withstand it due to his young age, I would have simply finished all three treatments today. ”

Xia ruofei paused and continued,””My friend will be picking him up in Sydney. It’s not good to leave him at your house. I’ll treat little Haoran again on the plane. Then, I’ll go to your house again before I return to China. I should be able to completely solve the hidden danger.”

“Alright, alright.” Tang Yitian nodded.”We’ll follow Mr. Xia’s arrangements. But you must come to my house a little earlier so that I can have the opportunity to be a good host.”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

At this time, little Haoran had already come to Xia ruofei’s side. Xia ruofei squatted down and looked at him, saying,””Haoran, sit cross – legged, I’m about to fight the flaming monster in your body. I might feel a little hot in a while, so you must hold it in and not move, understand?”

“I’ll remember that, brother!” Little Haoran said sensibly.

The seat had not been retracted after it was flattened last night, so the treatment was carried out on Xia ruofei’s seat.

Little Haoran sat cross – legged according to the posture Xia ruofei had taught him. Xia ruofei quickly sat behind little Haoran and pressed his hands on little Haoran’s Xinyu acupoint.

Tang Yitian and Jennifer also hurried to Xia ruofei’s side to prevent others from disturbing him.

Xia ruofei’s spiritual energy seeped out of his body and entered little Haoran’s heart acupuncture point. He started to guide and absorb the enormous amount of innate pure Yang Qi in his body.

As they had already done it last night, Xia ruofei was very familiar with it.

Moreover, after a quarter of the innate pure Yang Qi was absorbed, the concentration had decreased a little. It was also much easier for Xia ruofei to use his spiritual power to wrap and carry them.

In other words, he was much more efficient than yesterday.

Of course, using the invisible mental power to guide the innate pure Yang Qi was still very exhausting.

Time passed by.

Soon, Xia ruofei’s clothes were drenched in sweat again, and steam began to rise from the top of his head.

Xia ruofei could feel that his spiritual energy was being consumed rapidly, but he gritted his teeth and persevered.

He hoped that he could use this opportunity to absorb as much pure Yang Qi as possible.

The lesser the pure Yang Qi in little Haoran’s body, the smoother his qi and blood circulation would be, and his physique would naturally be stronger.

After Xia ruofei had absorbed the innate pure Yang Qi, it would follow the spiritual energy and run a few small cycles through the specific meridians before returning to his dantian.

Xia ruofei could feel the warmth in his lower abdomen becoming more and more obvious. He could also feel the enormous energy contained in the innate pure Yang Qi.

In Xia Qing’s words, this was a great opportunity for him.

This innate pure Yang Qi would have an unexpected effect on Xia ruofei’s future cultivation.

Little Haoran’s performance was also very good.

Xia ruofei knew that when the innate pure Yang Qi circulated through the meridians, the entire Meridian would feel a burning sensation. Xia ruofei’s body was very strong and could easily withstand it. However, little Haoran was only a seven or eight – year – old child and had a weak body for a long time. This process was actually quite painful.

However, the sensible little Haoran had been gritting his teeth and persevering. Except for his body trembling slightly, he did not make a sound and his body did not move at all.

Jennifer, who was on the side, saw her son’s pained expression and her heart ached and she was worried.

Lin Qiao was more concerned about Xia ruofei. Since yesterday, this was the third time Xia ruofei had been so exhausted.

In Lin Qiao’s memory, she had never seen Xia ruofei so exhausted. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia ruofei persevered and used what little mental energy he had left to wrap and guide little Haoran’s innate pure Yang Qi into his body for the last time.

After a few rounds of circulation and absorbing all the energy into his dantian, Xia ruofei slowly opened his eyes.

Xia ruofei checked little Haoran’s body condition before he removed his hand.

The effect of this treatment was obviously better than the last time. The remaining innate pure Yang Qi in little Haoran’s body was basically only about one – third of the original amount.

Most of the meridians in his body were in a clear state, and the circulation of qi and blood in his body was also much smoother than after the first treatment yesterday.

It could be said that little Haoran’s physique was almost the same as an ordinary child ‘s, at most slightly weaker.

Of course, this innate pure Yang Qi was still too much for the weak little Haoran. Xia ruofei still needed to treat him once to completely remove the hidden danger.

Xia ruofei retracted his palm and smiled.””Haoran, your performance was great and very brave! You can get up now!”

Little Haoran immediately got up and jumped off Xia ruofei’s seat.

His movements were very agile, and one look at his condition and one could tell that he was much better than before.

“Thank you, brother! I feel so comfortable now! I’ve never felt so comfortable before!” Little Haoran said happily as he held Xia ruofei’s hand.
