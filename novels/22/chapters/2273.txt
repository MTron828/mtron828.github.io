2274 Unified thinking (2)

“Are you guys done?” old man Liu asked indifferently.

Liu qunyan finally felt that something was wrong, and quickly said carefully,””I’m done. Dad, what’s your opinion?”

After Liu qunyan finished speaking, he mustered his courage and looked up at elder Liu. His eyes met the sharp gaze of the old man, and he was so scared that he quickly lowered his eyes to avoid the sharp gaze.

“What opinion do I have? What do you think I can say?” Old master Liu laughed coldly.”Do you think Xia ruofei is a fool? Did he think the song family was just for show? Was it still a secret who the shares of the affiliated companies belonged to? Using this as a reason to retain a portion of the shares, and even thinking of taking over paradise Corporation, what are you thinking? Ridiculous! You’re simply stupid!”

Liu qun Yan, Liu Lifang, and the others were so scared by old man Liu’s scolding that they didn’t even dare to breathe, let alone talk back. They even lowered their heads to their chests.

Actually, there was one more thing that old man Liu did not say out loud. That was, Qianqian’s father’s life was in Xia ruofei’s hands. If you plot against him, isn’t that the same as trying to kill me?

At the thought of this, old man Liu couldn’t help but feel inexplicably angry. This bunch of unfilial descendants ...

Liu Qunfeng, who was the closest to old man Liu, quickly got up and patted him on the back.””Dad! Don’t get too excited! Don’t get too excited! Qun Yan and the others are just saying ...”

“This kind of thinking is very dangerous!” Old master Liu said,”don’t even think about it! Chongli, you’re in charge of the transfer of shares. Don’t do anything sneaky. You must hand over the entire Pharmaceutical Group to Xia ruofei. Also, don’t try to plant any spies in the group, and don’t even think of stealing the formula of the heart – nourishing Jade skin cream! Do you understand?”

“Alright, big brother! Don’t worry! I’ll definitely get it done!” Liu Chongli quickly replied.

As for Liu qun Yan, Liu Lifang, and the others, who had been beaming with joy just a moment ago, they did not even dare to breathe loudly now. All of them lowered their heads, looking like frozen eggplants.

Old man Liu calmed down a little and said seriously,””Transferring the pharmaceutical Group is only the first step. There are more important things to do next. Qunfeng, take note.”

Liu Qunfeng quickly stood up and said,””Dad, give me your orders!”

“From today on, all the arrangements against the song family will be temporarily put on hold,” said old man Liu. “At all levels, it’s appropriate to give way. Don’t take the initiative to stir up conflicts. In short, as long as the song family doesn’t take the initiative to touch our cake, we will live in peace with them. Even if the song family really does something, we’ll endure it as much as we can ...”

Liu Qunfeng gasped in shock and muttered,””Dad! Is this what Xia ruofei asked for?”

Old man Liu didn’t give a direct answer. He only said,””This is my decision after careful consideration!”

“But ... This way, a lot of our plans will be in vain!” “And ...” Liu Qunfeng said.”Will the Gaos and the other families have any opinions on what we’re doing?”

“We’re only in a truce with the song family, not an Alliance,”old man Liu frowned and said,” who are they to judge us?” You can’t tell what’s more important, can you?”

Liu Qunfeng’s heart skipped a beat, and he quickly said,”I know, dad! I’ll immediately carry out your orders and ensure that it’s completed to the letter!”

Only then did old man Liu nod slightly. He looked tired and waved his hand.”Alright, I’ve gathered everyone here today to let everyone know and to remind you all to keep a low profile from now on. I don’t want to see haojun’s incident happening again!”

Liu Qunfeng felt bitter. Liu haojun was his son! His bright future had been ruined just like that. Now, he was being used as a negative example by the old man. Furthermore, Xia ruofei, the person who had caused Liu haojun’s downfall, had earned a lot of money. This was really too heartbreaking ...

However, Liu Qunfeng only dared to criticize him in his heart. He, Liu Chongli, and his brothers and sisters all nodded in agreement.

At a time like this, they naturally had to be the first to express their opinions. If there was any hesitation, it would be a matter of attitude.

“I’m a little tired,”said old man Liu,” everyone can leave now!”

Liu Qunfeng and the others left the room with complicated expressions on their faces. Each of them had their own thoughts, but they were all alarmed.

The Liu family was in an uproar because of the old man’s announcement. After Xia ruofei left Room 301, he returned to the song family’s old house in the red flag car.

“Ruofei, the Bureau chief just woke up from his lunch break.” Manager Lu smiled and said,”he said that you can meet him directly once you come back. There’s no need to inform him.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“You’re familiar with the house, so I won’t be leading the way. ” Manager Lu smiled and said,”I still have to go to the kitchen and ask the cook to cook a few more dishes. Your face is glowing. It’s obvious that something good has happened! It seems like the chief will have to break his precept and drink more tonight ...”

“Hahaha! I didn’t expect you to be so good at reading people’s faces, manager Lu!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Your grin is almost reaching your ears, isn’t it obvious enough?” Manager Lu said,”alright, don’t argue with me. Hurry up and go see the chief! Don’t let him wait too long ...”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said,”manager Lu, see you later!”

Manager Lu waved at Xia ruofei and walked to the kitchen. Xia ruofei walked to the study room with ease.

He gently knocked on the door and heard elder song’s voice from inside,””Please enter!”

Xia ruofei pushed the door open and walked in with a smile. He called out,””Grandpa song!”

Elder song put down the newspaper in his hand and smiled.””RUO Fei is back? It seems like the result of the conversation was very ideal!”

Xia ruofei was stunned. He touched his nose and said,””Is it that obvious? Manager Lu also said the same thing just now ...”

Eccentric song couldn’t help but laugh heartily,”Tell me! What did you talk to that old man about?”

Xia ruofei sat down across from elder song and said,””I’ve already thought about it. Since you still care about our friendship, I can’t just leave him in the lurch. I’ll definitely treat him.”

“Ha!” Elder song laughed. My face is quite big. ”

“That’s for sure!” Xia ruofei said,”however, the Liu family is quite hostile to me, so I can’t cure the old man in one go. The best way is to keep him alive and not let him get rid of the disease completely. Only then will I be able to do it with ease.”

Elder song nodded in agreement.”Indeed, I think you already have a plan, right?”

“I’m still confident in my treatment. ” Xia ruofei smiled confidently and said,”but I don’t have any relationship with the Liu family. I can’t just do it for free! Therefore, the only problem is ... How much money do I need from them?”

“Looks like old Liu’s going all out today!” Elder song laughed.

“I want their Pharmaceutical Group,” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

“Hmm ... That’s appropriate. Although the Liu family will feel some heartache, it won’t be a serious blow.” Elder song pondered for a moment and said,”I’m guessing that old Liu agreed without hesitation.”

Xia ruofei gave him a thumbs up and said,””You’re indeed a divine strategist!”

Xia ruofei continued.”Other than this condition, I wanted to mediate and make the Liu family give up their hostile position against the song family. The two families would join forces and fight against the song family.”

Eccentric song replied without hesitation,”That old man will never agree. There are too many factors involved. Even if he is very afraid of death now, he will never agree to this condition, because in this way, even he himself will not be able to control the situation. Then there is no meaning for him to live!”
