Chapter 48  Full cooperation (1)

    After Xia ruofei heard this, he smiled and said,"

  "I'll have to trouble President Zheng then. "

  "It's nothing! You're welcome, Mr. Xia, we're business partners!" President Zheng laughed heartily and then asked,"I wonder if Mr. Xia has a brand name that you're interested in?"

  Xia ruofei thought for a while and said,"

  "Let's call it paradise organic vegetables!"

  Xia ruofei's online roaty shop was also called "Taoyuan roaty". He might as well name his new vegetables with this name so that it would be easier to form a brand matrix in the future.

  President Zheng chuckled and said,"

  "That's a good name! Mr. Xia's new vegetable is as good as if it's from a paradise, and the name sounds like 'leisurely seeing the southern mountain', so I can't help but be fascinated!"

  Xia ruofei didn't expect this chubby businessman, President Zheng, to be so cultured. He couldn't help smiling and nodding in agreement.

  President Zheng then asked,"

  "Mr. Xia, do you have any specific ideas on the trademark style?"

  "I haven't considered that." Xia ruofei said,"why don't I trouble President Zheng to find a designer to design one for me? It's fine as long as it can reflect the feeling of a paradise!"

  "No problem!" President Zheng agreed readily.

  He thought for a while and asked,"

  "By the way, Mr. Xia, do you have your own registered company? If you do, this paradise trademark can be directly put under your company's name. "

  "I don't have that ..." Xia ruofei smiled bitterly."I just retired from the Army and I'm still in the early stages of my business."

  President Zheng looked surprised, and his tone became more enthusiastic. He said,"

  "So Mr. Xia is a retired soldier! No wonder I always felt that you had the air of a soldier ... I, old Zheng, admire soldiers the most. It's a pity that my body wasn't strong enough when I was young, so I couldn't fulfill my dream of being a soldier!"

  Xia ruofei smiled and said,"

  "I was just an ordinary soldier in the Army. I was a retired corporal."

  "That's still amazing!" President Zheng said,"Mr. Xia, I think it is necessary to register a company. How about this? Leave this to me. What do you want to name your new company? Why don't we call it paradise Corporation? I think this name is pretty good!"

  Xia ruofei said,"

  "President Zheng, the name of the company is fine, but ... I heard that a new company needs to be registered with capital. I ... I don't have much money now!"

  President Zheng laughed and said,"

  "Mr. Xia, that's all in the past. After the new company law is implemented, you can register a company with just one Yuan, and the registered capital is now under a pledge system. For example, if you want to register a company of one million Yuan, you can directly write that the registered capital is one million Yuan, and the time of investment is 30 years later. This way, after the business license is issued, your registered capital will be one million Yuan, and you can invest 30 years later!"

  Xia ruofei was very surprised and said,"

  "This actually works?"

  "That's right ... Why else would there be so many shell companies?" President Zheng laughed and said,"even if the old company law implemented a handover system, there are still many people who take advantage of loopholes and set up companies without money!"

  Then, President Zheng changed the topic and said,"

  "But since Mr. Xia wants to set up a company, you don't have to put the time of investment in a few decades. In that case, future partners will really misunderstand that you're a shell company ... I'll help you pay for the registration capital and transfer it out later. All you need to do is provide your identification documents and other relevant information! By the way, how about 5 million Yuan in registered capital?"

  President Zheng saw that Xia ruofei and Tian Huilan's family had such a good personal relationship, so he wasn't worried about the security of the funds. Moreover, if everything was left to him to operate, the security of the funds would definitely be guaranteed. So, it was better to sell Xia ruofei and their cooperation would be more pleasant in the future.

  President Zheng was very optimistic about the future of Xia ruofei's paradise brand organic vegetables.

  "This ... Won't it be too much trouble for you?" Xia ruofei asked hesitantly.

  "It's no trouble, no trouble!" President Zheng smiled and said,"I'm familiar with the process. If you have acquaintances in some functional departments, it's very easy to handle!"

  "Thank you, President Zheng!" Xia ruofei didn't argue and nodded.

  If Xia ruofei had to do these things by himself, it would be very troublesome. If President Zheng was willing to help, Xia ruofei would be able to save a lot of trouble.

  "You're welcome, haha! If you don't have a company, we can't sign the cooperation agreement!" President Zheng said candidly,"I'm just helping myself!"

  The two of them then finalized some details of the cooperation and had a very good chat. In the end, President Zheng proposed to treat Xia ruofei to supper. He even said that he would not leave after supper and that he would find the best girl in the club to keep him company.

  Xia ruofei was so scared that he waved his hands and refused.

  When Xia ruofei was about to leave, President Zheng thought that he had drunk a lot of wine during dinner, so he arranged for a car to send him back. He also found a driver to drive Xia ruofei's pickup.

  As both parties had agreed to start supplying the vegetables the next day, the club was responsible for picking up the goods at their doorstep. Today, they would take it as showing the driver the way to the holiday villa that Xia ruofei had rented. It was not easy to find, so Xia ruofei did not reject President Zheng's kind intentions. After expressing his gratitude, he got into the car and left, bringing the driver to the nearby parking lot to pick up his pickup truck.

  ……

  The next morning, not long after Xia ruofei took out the vegetables from the spirit map space for the "West River moon" club, the car sent by the club arrived at the holiday villa. A manager sent by President Zheng came with the car.

  President Zheng had arranged for him to help Xia ruofei with the company's registration and Trademark Registering.

  The manager made a list of all the information he needed from Xia ruofei, such as his identification card and bank account. Xia ruofei prepared everything on the spot.

  In addition, the manager took out a letter of authorization for Xia ruofei to sign. With this letter of authorization, they could do all the trivial matters of registration on their behalf.

  After dealing with these things quickly, the manager directed the driver and a worker to move the new vegetables out of the villa's garage.

  There was a small scale on the small truck, and they skillfully weighed the vegetables and loaded them on the truck.

  Xia ruofei had taken out the vegetables according to their weight in the spirit map space. There were four types of vegetables in total, and each of them weighed about 20 catties.

  During the discussion last night, Xia ruofei had given the West River Moon Club a price of 80 yuan per 500 grams for each vegetable. This price was almost double the price he had given Ling Qingxue. There was a difference between family and friends!

  Moreover, the club was a high - end business, so they didn't care about the price of the vegetables at all. When they sold them to customers, their profit would definitely be several times higher.

  As the agreement had not been officially signed yet, President Zheng asked the manager to bring cash over directly. The four types of vegetables weighed more than 80 catties in total, and they were sold for about 6500 Yuan.

  This was the first time that Xia ruofei had reaped any benefits since he started planting vegetables on a whim.

  6500 Yuan didn't seem like a lot, but it was only a day's income! That would be close to 200000 Yuan a month. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

  And this was just the beginning. In the future, when the supply increased, there would be more money.

  Most importantly, other than the almost negligible amount of money spent on the seeds, Xia ruofei did not have to pay any other costs. It could be said that he would make a huge profit without any capital.

  Xia ruofei put the money into his pocket and watched the small truck carrying the food leave.

  It was time to expand the vegetable planting area! Moreover, he had to start looking for a way to grow high - Quality vegetables in the outside world as soon as possible. Otherwise, due to the limited space, it would always be a small project.

  Xia ruofei returned to the villa and went to the bedroom on the second floor. He locked the door and closed the curtains. Then, he took out the spirit map space and entered it.
