Chapter 123: The precious white truffle (1)

Please subscribe! Xia ruofei was playing with Huanhuan in the garden when the Maybach 62s that MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming were in slowly drove into the mansion on shallow water Bay Road. Huan Huan sat on the swing while Xia ruofei pushed the swing from behind. As the swing went higher and higher, Huanhuan kept chuckling. Tian Huixin stood at the side and watched this scene, a knowing smile appearing on her face. Xia ruofei saw the Maybach stop in front of the building. He held onto the swing and said to Huan Huan,””Huanhuan, your grandfather is back. Let’s go!” “Oh ...” Huanhuan pouted. She was having a good time, but she was suddenly stopped, so she was a little unhappy. Xia ruofei laughed and walked to the front. He picked up Huanhuan and walked towards the front of the building. At this moment, MA Xiong and Ma Zhiming had already gotten off the car and were walking over. “Mr. Xia, I’ll never forget the kindness of saving my life!” MA Xiong extended his hand to Xia ruofei from afar. Xia ruofei held Huanhuan with one hand and shook MA Xiong’s hand with the other. He smiled and said,””It’s good that old Mr. MA is fine. ” Then, Xia ruofei reached out and gently pinched Huanhuan’s little face. He said,””Huanhuan, quickly call Grandpa.” MA Xiong was also looking at Huan Huan nervously. Huanhuan was no longer the autistic girl she was before. Her eyes were bright, and she looked at MA Xiong before she called out in her baby voice,”Hello, Grandpa!” MA Xiong felt comforted and said,”Good, good, good! My good granddaughter ...” This business giant was no different from an ordinary old man at this time. His eyes were even a little red. Seeing that his precious granddaughter had recovered, he was also excited. “Daddy, you have to control your emotions. You can’t be too excited ...” Ma Zhiming quickly said. “What’s there to be afraid of with Mr. Xia here?”MA Xiong said nonchalantly. The couple, Ma Zhiming and Tian Huixin, couldn’t help but laugh when they heard this. Wasn’t that so? With a miracle doctor like Xia ruofei here, they would not be afraid even if something happened. MA Xiong continued,”besides, you’ve seen the results of today’s examination. Not only has my brain fully recovered, but my blood pressure has also been controlled. I’m very healthy now!” The main cause of the cerebral hemorrhage was MA Xiong’s high blood pressure. Xia ruofei’s medicine the day before had not only cured his brain damage and blood clots, but also greatly relieved his high blood pressure. “Yup! Xia Sheng’s medical skills are really amazing!” Ma Zhiming sighed and said,”xiasheng, we owe you a big favor for treating Huanhuan’s illness. Now, you’ve saved my daddy’s life. I don’t even know how to thank you ...” Xia ruofei smiled.”You don’t have to be so polite. Besides, didn’t you pay for the treatment?” “Xia Sheng, that’s just a small token of our appreciation. It’s not worth mentioning compared to your great kindness!” Ma Zhiming quickly said. Xia ruofei smiled and did not continue the conversation. The reason why he treated Huanhuan was entirely out of his love for this cute little girl. He agreed to come to Hong Kong this time because the MA family could help him in his career in the future. However, the more important reason seemed to be that MA Xiong was Huanhuan’s grandfather and Lu You had asked him for help. MA Xiong’s check – up at the hospital took a long time, so it was time for dinner after everyone sat in the garden and chatted. This was the first meal that MA Xiong would have after returning home from his illness. Furthermore, Xia ruofei was there, so it was very Grand. MA Xiong’s wife had passed away, so only MA Xiong, Ma Zhiming, his wife, Huan Huan, and Xia ruofei were eating. In the exquisitely decorated and spacious dining room, there was a long dining table with exquisite pure silver tableware placed neatly on it. After everyone was seated, the Butler instructed the servants to start serving the dishes. The first dish served was ordinary – looking Italy. The servants pushed the small cart briskly and placed a bowl of spaghetti in front of everyone. Then, a white man in a white chef’s uniform and a tall hat walked up with a plate. The plate was filled with a layer of rice, and on top of the rice were two goose egg – sized things that looked like potatoes. As soon as the plate was served, Xia ruofei immediately smelled a strong but indescribable fragrance. It seemed to have the fragrance of soil and tree roots. “Mr. Xia,” MA Xiong said with a smile,”I just bought these two pieces of white truffles two days ago. I fell sick before I could eat them. I’d like to invite you to enjoy them with me today.” MA Xiong gestured to the White chef and the chef immediately brought the plate to Xia ruofei’s side. He put the plate down gently and picked up a piece of truffle from the plate. Then, he took out something that looked like a bottle opener and a plane. The chef skillfully peeled off pieces of white truffle that were as thin as paper and covered Xia ruofei’s Italy. Upon close contact, the unique fragrance became even more intense. The cut white truffle had marble – like lines on the surface, looking very beautiful. Soon, the chef added many pieces of white truffle to everyone’s plate. However, because the truffle was very thin, they didn’t even finish one piece. MA Xiong picked up the plate and took a deep breath of the rich fragrance. He looked intoxicated. MA Xiong was also a glutton, so he was very particular about food. He smiled and said,”Xia Sheng, this white truffle is known as the white gold on the dining table. In Europe and America, it’s considered one of the three most precious treasures along with caviar and foie gras! These two pieces are the best white truffle from the Alba region in Italy. I spent 1.8 million Hong Kong dollars to buy them three days ago, and then they were directly air – flown here. It has been less than four days since they were harvested, so now is the best time to eat them. Try them!” Xia ruofei was shocked when he heard that. The two pieces of ‘potatoes’ cost 1.8 million Hong Kong dollars. That was too extravagant. Xia ruofei took a bite. He did not know how to describe the taste in words. The texture was naturally very fresh and the fragrance was very unique. When paired with the clear and fragrant Italy white wine, altavilladela Corte, it had an indescribable unique flavor. “Old master Ma, is this white truffle really that valuable?” Xia ruofei said,”can you give me a detailed introduction?” MA Xiong laughed and said,”the price of white truffle is at least 3000 US dollars per pound. This kind of high – Quality white truffle from the Alba region is even more priceless. The auction price can even reach tens of thousands of US dollars per pound. The heavier the weight of a single white truffle, the higher the price. The reason for such a high price is very simple. It has a unique taste, is rare in production, and can not be cultivated by man!” After listening to MA Xiong’s endless introduction, Xia ruofei finally understood that truffles were a type of fungi growing in the soil under oak or beech trees. Due to the high requirements for humidity, climate, tree species, and soil, it was basically impossible to cultivate. Only truffle hunters and specially trained hounds could find them, so the price had always been high. Truffles had always been a favorite on the Western dining table. Countless people were attracted to its charming fragrance, and there was a huge demand for it every year. White truffle was the most precious of all truffles. Even in a good year, the world’s production of white truffle was only about 3 tons, so the price could be imagined. In fact, truffles and wormgrass were surprisingly similar. They were both the results of fungi conversion, the representatives of expensive and luxurious natural nourishments, and both had excellent functions. Therefore, there was a saying that the East ate wormgrass, while the West ate truffles. Hearing MA Xiong’s words, Xia ruofei’s heart skipped a beat. This kind of top – grade ingredient was really promising! Others might not be able to cultivate it, but he could!nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
