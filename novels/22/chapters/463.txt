Chapter 464: Spiritual Vulture (2)

“Chairman.” Feng Jing went straight to Xia ruofei’s desk.

“Sit down!” Xia ruofei smiled and handed the report to Feng Jing.”I’ve read this recruitment proposal. It’s very detailed and reasonable. We’ll do as you say and recruit as many people as possible!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Alright,” he said. Feng Jing took the proposal and said calmly.

For this proposal, she had almost stayed up all night. Now, she still had two dark circles under her eyes. Even makeup couldn’t completely cover them! Therefore, she was very confident in this proposal. Xia ruofei’s direct agreement did not surprise her.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”start the recruitment as soon as possible. In the next two days, I’ll be going to Dong Keng village to discuss the land rental. You’ll come with me. In the future, you’ll be in charge of contacting the local governments.”

“Yes, Chairman.” Feng Rao replied.

“There are only a few people available right now. If you need anyone for your recruitment, feel free to use them. Whether it’s Lei Hu and the other three or pang Hao, they’ll all be under your command.” Xia ruofei said,”if you need any money, you can get an advance from pang Hao.”

In Feng Jing’s recruitment plan, she planned to participate in a few job fairs. She had also posted on some recruitment websites that no matter if it was online or offline, they would all have to pay. She had already listed out the rough budget. She just had to take Xia ruofei’s signed plan and go to the finance department to pay in advance.

“Understood.” Feng Jing said,”don’t worry, Chairman! I’ll definitely complete the recruitment as soon as possible with the best quality. ”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.

Feng Jing stood up.”Chairman, if there’s nothing else, I’ll head over first. I’m planning to post the information on a few mainstream recruitment websites this morning.”

“Oh, wait a moment,” Xia ruofei said.

Xia ruofei pulled open his drawer and took out the Jade skin cream. He passed it to Feng Jing and said,””CEO Feng, this is for you. It’s a self – made cosmetic made from pure Chinese medicine. You can use it as a face mask. ”

Feng Rao was slightly stunned. She quickly glanced at Xia ruofei and took the jaded skin ointment. She said softly,””Thank you, Chairman. I’ll go first.”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded.””Go! I’ll have to trouble you these few days!”

After Feng Jing left, Xia ruofei stood up as well. He stuffed his phone and cigarettes into his bag and left the office humming a song. He returned to the villa.

After Feng Jing took office, Xia ruofei’s pressure was greatly reduced. He was finally in a state of being a boss who did nothing.

There were still two to three hours before lunch, and Xia ruofei did not have to cook by himself. He could just eat at the staff cafeteria when it was time, so he prepared to go to the spirit map space to make the soup of the pregnant spirit. He counted the days and found that he could take the soup today. Xia ruofei was looking forward to further condensing his mental power after this and if he could unlock another page of the booklet.

Xia ruofei was filled with curiosity and anticipation towards the spiritual puppet described in the booklet.

With this anticipation, Xia ruofei hurried back to the villa.

Now that pang Hao had moved to the complex to work, the small villa was Xia ruofei’s exclusive territory. Once he locked the door, no one would disturb him unless something big happened at the farm.

Xia ruofei returned to his room and habitually locked all the doors and windows. He pulled the curtains shut and then took out the spirit map scroll from his palm. With a thought, he entered the medium.

In the original space, Xia ruofei skillfully picked out the herbs needed to make the spirit nourishment soup from the medicine rack and started to brew.

Now, Xia ruofei was already very familiar with the process. After several times of refining, he had memorized every process by heart. Soon, a bowl of steaming soup was ready.

Xia ruofei held the bowl of medicinal soup. With a thought, he appeared in the cave in the new space. As his spiritual power grew stronger, Xia ruofei’s control of the spirit map space became purer and more skilled. Now, he could appear anywhere in the space with a thought.

The deviation would not exceed ten centimeters.

For example, this time, Xia ruofei had appeared on the stone bed in the stone room.

He directly sat cross – legged on the Jade futon, then raised his head and gulped down the entire bowl of spirit nurturing soup.

Xia ruofei discovered that the Jade futon not only had a great effect on recovering mental strength, but it also increased the efficiency of absorbing the soup.

A familiar warm current started to build up in his lower abdomen. Xia ruofei immediately held his breath and concentrated on absorbing the medicinal properties of the pregnancy soup.

It was as if he was soaking in a hot spring. He did not feel the pain of being pricked by needles and cut by knives like when he was drinking the body tempering soup. Unknowingly, the medicinal properties of the entire bowl of soup had been completely absorbed by Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei closed his eyes and felt it. He realized that his spiritual power had become purer. Naturally, his connection with the space had become closer.

Xia ruofei opened his eyes. With a thought, the booklet on the stone platform flew towards him and landed in his hand.

In the spirit map space, Xia ruofei was becoming more and more like a creator.
