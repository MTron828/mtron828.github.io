Chapter 1456: Guan Ping’s troubles (2)

Translator: 549690339

“Hello, Mr. Guan!” Ye linyun said as he bowed slightly.

“Brother, don’t be so polite!” Guan Ping quickly said. We’re all RUO Fei’s brothers, you can call me by my name, or you can call me ping Zi!”

“Alright, alright. Everyone, please sit down!” Xia ruofei said,”fatty, stop standing there. You won’t look tall even if you stand up!”

“Don’t expose me!”Pang Hao said gloomily.

Everyone sat around the small square table. The stools were ordinary plastic stools, and the tables were the cheapest kind of small folding table, which was even glistening with oil.

However, Xia ruofei did not seem to mind and sat down.

When Guan Ping saw this, he felt a sense of relief. It seemed like this brother of his didn’t have those bad habits just because he was rich. At least in front of him, he was still the good brother who ate skewers and played games with him.

“Ruofei, my financial ability is limited. I can only treat you to food at the food stalls. Please don’t mind!” Guan Ping said with a smile.

“If you say such things again, be careful or I’ll hit you!” Xia ruofei grabbed a handful of boiled peanuts and said while peeling them,”have you forgotten that the three of us used to drink a bottle of beer?”

Their middle school was nearby. When they were studying, they used to come to ancient tower Street for barbecue. Sometimes, after evening self – study, they would even meet up to eat barbecue.

In fact, when they were students, they almost didn’t drink, but when they were young, they always felt that drinking was a cool thing, so even though they were a little tight on money, they would sometimes order a bottle of beer and share it with the three of them.

Pang Hao and Guan Ping reminisced when Xia ruofei mentioned the past. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Hahaha! You probably haven’t been here for a long time, have you?” Guan Ping said with a smile,”my house is not far from here. Sometimes, I come here for a meal after work. Let me tell you, the barbecue here is still the same as before!”

“Oh, really? Then I’ll have to eat a few more skewers later!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”Oh right, have you ordered the food?”

“I’ve already ordered!” Guan Ping said,”don’t worry, I ordered a lot of your favorite mutton and gluten!”

“It’s still pingzi who understands me!” Xia ruofei chuckled.

The three of them chatted for a while, and the boss had already served the skewers. Soon, the small square table was filled with skewers.

Then, they asked for another case of beer.

Although it was winter, one had to drink beer to have the feeling of eating skewers.

Other than ye Lingyun, who had to drive, Xia ruofei and the other two filled their glasses with wine.

After the three of them finished a big glass of beer, Xia ruofei wiped his mouth and laughed.””Satisfying!”

Then, he reached out and picked up a skewer of beef gluten, and began to gobble it down.

To be honest, the ingredients used for the beef tendon were ordinary, and the heat was not very good. It could not be compared with the exquisite food in the big hotels. However, even Xia ruofei, who was used to eating Taoyuan vegetables and had a mouth full of them, still felt that it was very delicious.

It was the same taste he had when he was in middle school!

The four of them chatted as they ate, and the topic unknowingly turned to Guan Ping’s work.

After Xia ruofei had a drink with Guan Ping, he asked,””Pingzi, I heard little fatty say that he hasn’t been very happy recently?”

The smile on Guan Ping’s face turned bitter as he said,”Little fatty is still the same as before, you can’t keep your mouth shut at all!”

“You brat, you’re full of nonsense!” Xia ruofei said angrily,”so I’m not your brother? And you’re treating me differently from little fatty? Did water get into your brain?”

Pang Hao chuckled at the side and ignored the two’s bickering. He only lowered his head and ate.

Ye Lingyun naturally wouldn’t interrupt. He was also very serious about the skewers in his hands.

Guan Ping smiled bitterly,”ruofei, that’s not what I meant.” Aren’t you usually very busy? This small matter of mine ...”

“I’m the boss of the company. How busy can I be?” Xia ruofei said,”Lil ‘Fatty’s working hours are longer than mine every day. Pingzi, these are not reasons! You’re treating me as an outsider!”

“Fine! I was wrong!” Guan Ping said,”punish yourself with a cup!”

Finishing, Guan Ping poured the wine and downed it. He then wiped his mouth and said,”Ruofei, it’s actually nothing much. It’s just that I wasn’t very happy during that period of time. I poured out some bitter water when I drank with little fatty ...”

“What’s going on?” Xia ruofei asked Guan Ping.

“Yup! What’s wrong?” Pang Hao also asked,”the last time I asked you, you wouldn’t tell me even if you died ...”

Guan Ping wanted to say something but stopped. Ye linyun immediately stood up and said,””Brother Xia, brother Guan, I’m going to the washroom!”

“Ling Yun, it’s fine, it’s fine!” Guan Ping quickly said,”I’m not trying to avoid you ... Don’t misunderstand!”

“Brother Guan, I really need to go to the bathroom ...” Ye Lingyun said with a smile.

Xia ruofei could also tell that Guanping seemed to be hiding something, so he said to ye Lingyun,””Ling Yun, you go! By the way, there’s no washroom in this stall, so you have to go to the McDonald’s across the street!”

Guan Ping couldn’t help but laugh,”not bad!” I haven’t been here for a few years, but I’m quite familiar with the terrain!”

“This Old Street hasn’t changed much in so many years. It’s like we’ve returned to a few years ago when we entered gutta Street!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Ye Lingyun nodded in response and walked out of the food stall.

“Speak!” Xia ruofei stopped smiling and looked at Guan Ping.”What happened?”

Guan Ping sighed.”This is a little melodramatic. I’m telling you, don’t laugh!”

“I say, why have you become so wishy – washy?” Pang Hao could not help but say,”I’m worried to death!”

“I’ll talk, I’ll talk!” Guan Ping quickly said,”actually, there was a new manager at our store last autumn. She’s a woman, and she ... She took a fancy to me ...”

Pang Hao and Xia ruofei were stunned for a moment before bursting into laughter.

This was a food stall, and everyone was talking loudly, drinking, and chatting, so the two’s exaggerated behavior did not attract any attention.

Guan Ping replied with a depressed look,”I knew it!” You two ...”

Xia ruofei tried hard not to laugh and said,”I’m sorry, pingzi. I really couldn’t help it just now ...”

Pang Hao chimed in from the side,”I didn’t expect you to be so lucky even though you’re not as strong as I am and not as handsome as RUO Fei!” But wasn’t this a good thing? Why are you depressed!”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”it might not be a good thing!” Little fatty, have you forgotten about Zhao Xueqing?”

When Xia ruofei first bought the villa, Zhao Xueqing was the local agent entrusted by the overseas villa landlord. At that time, Guan Ping was in charge of the miscellaneous matters of the transfer of ownership, so he had more contact with Zhao Xueqing. Guan Ping had a good impression of her.

“Ruofei, what’s all this about!” Guan Ping said with a bitter smile.

“You’ve cut off contact with Zhao Xueqing?” Xia ruofei asked,”no way? I think you were very determined!”

“I’m still in contact with Xueqing!” Guan Ping said.

“You even called Xueqing! It seems like you’re making good progress!” Pang Hao said with a smile.

“How long has it been? If there’s no progress at all, I might as well find a piece of tofu to smash myself to death!” Xia ruofei said with a smile.

Guan Ping looked at his two friends helplessly and said,””This isn’t the point at all, okay? Do you two want to hear it or not? I think you’re just gloating over my misfortune!”

Xia ruofei and pang Hao quickly held back their laughter and said at the same time,””I want to hear it! I want to hear it!”

Xia ruofei asked,”what’s the main point?” Even if you’re not interested in her, it’s not a bad thing to have someone like her! Do you have to be so Haggard because of this?”

Guan Ping forced a smile and said,”the main point is!” This female supervisor is a married woman!”

“D * MN ...” Xia ruofei and pang Hao cried out in unison.
