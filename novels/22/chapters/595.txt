Chapter 596: The brilliant purple red Dragon (2)

As expected, Guo Qinglin quickly said,””Nine million!”

This time, even Ling Xiaotian felt that something was wrong. He looked suspiciously at li Zongheng, who was smiling bitterly, and Guo Qinglin, who was calm and composed. He said,”Old Guo, boss li, what are you guys doing? Do you have too much money to burn?”

At this moment, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Uncle Ling, elder Guo and CEO li are smart people. They have their own reasons for bidding ...”

Xia ruofei turned to look at li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin.

“It seems like elder Guo and little Xia have already seen through it. I thought I had a sharp eye ...” Li Zongheng said with a bitter smile.

“Boss li, it’s worth it to spend more money on good things ...” Guo Qinglin said with a smile.

Ling Xiaotian also came back to his senses. He took two steps to the plastic box and looked down at it carefully.

He looked at it for a while and took out a small flashlight. However, the flashlight emitted a red light, which was clearly used to observe the red Arowana’s hair color.

If not for the fact that he was afraid of disturbing the two precious blood – Red Dragons, Ling Xiaotian would have fished them out to take a closer look.

After a short while, Ling Xiaotian finally let out a cry of surprise,””A brilliant purple red Dragon? And it’s a myriad of colors? Old Guo, old Li, you guys have great foresight!”

Guo Qinglin laughed and said,”what’s the use of having good eyes?” Xiao Xia knows it in his heart. It’s impossible for us to pick up a hole!”

Li Zongheng smiled bitterly and said,”I think the real amazing one is little Xia! He could clearly tell that old Guo and I had our eyes on this pair of Arowana, but he didn’t even make a sound and even auctioned off the other two pairs first ...”

Xie Xun’s eyes were wide open.”Old Ling, are you sure you’re not mistaken? Is it really a brilliant purple red Dragon that has reached the level of a myriad of colors?”

......

“Nonsense!” Ling Xiaotian said,”when have my eyes ever been wrong?”

“Tsk ... Why didn’t you see it just now? You still dare to say you didn’t misjudge?” Xie Xun ruthlessly sneered, his tongue still as poisonous as ever.

Ling Xiaotian’s old face turned red as he twisted logic,””You guys didn’t let me participate in the bidding just now, so how could I have the time to check it out?”

Xia ruofei was confused and couldn’t help but ask,””Uncle Ling, what’s the purple red Dragon? And what’s with the myriad of colors?”

“You don’t know?” Ling Xiaotian, Xie Xun, li Zongheng, and Guo Qinglin all asked in unison with their eyes wide open.

“Should I have known?” Xia ruofei shrugged.

“Then just now, you ...” Li Zongheng asked.

Xia ruofei smiled.”I just saw that you and old Guo’s expressions weren’t right. You’ve also glanced at this pair of Red Arowana several times. My intuition told me that this pair of Red Arowana is not simple. That’s all ...”

Li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin looked at each other and smiled bitterly at the same time. They were old – timers, but they had actually exposed their flaws in front of a young man.

Li Zongheng and Guo Qinglin did not realize that the other party had set their eyes on the pair of Red Arowana, but Xia ruofei had seen it all. It was really embarrassing.

Ling Xiaotian was stunned for a moment before he looked at li Zongheng and burst out laughing.

“Old Ling, little Xia is asking you a question!” Li Zongheng said, a little depressed. What are you giggling about ...”

Only then did Ling Xiaotian’s smile slowly disappear. After a long while, he regained his composure and said to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, your Red Arowana should have undergone a small mutation. It’s not obvious because they’re not fully mature yet, but it can still be clearly seen under the red light.”

After he finished speaking, Ling Xiaotian turned on his red light flashlight and shone it on the blood – Red Dragon. He pointed at the spot and said,””Look ... There’s a layer of purple on top of the red, and this purple almost covers all the scales. The red and purple colors reflect each other. This is what we call a bright purple red Dragon, and it’s the highest grade of it, the myriad purple and thousand red. This kind of red Dragon is very beautiful in an ornamental fish tank with red lights when it’s an adult. ”

Guo Qinglin chuckled and added,””Xiao Xia, there are also cheap purple red Dragons. You can buy them in the market for hundreds of thousands of Yuan each. This one of yours is very rare. It’s very red and purple, and the fish itself is almost perfect in all aspects, whether it’s the head, the back, the hair color, or other aspects. Such a purple red Dragon is too rare. I’ve played Red Arowana for decades, but to be honest, this is the first time I’ve seen one.”

Since there was no chance to pick up the scraps, Guo Qinglin simply explained to Xia ruofei in detail.

Xia ruofei nodded his head repeatedly after hearing this. He felt that he had gained a lot of knowledge.

To be honest, the purple color of the blood – Red Dragon was not obvious. Xia ruofei did not notice any difference when he was choosing the fish in the medium. He did not expect there to be so many details.

Furthermore, Guo Qinglin and Li Zongheng were able to see the difference with their eyes, which made Xia ruofei admire them even more. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ling Xiaotian laughed and said,”alright!” There’s no need to hide it anymore. Old Guo, chief Li, you can continue bidding!”

Xie Xun joined in the fun and said,””This is a brilliant purple red Dragon! We should be able to bid too! If I had known that there were brilliant purple and red Dragons, I definitely wouldn’t have bought this pair!”
