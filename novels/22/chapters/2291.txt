Xia ruofei and Song Wei stepped onto the accommodation ladder hurriedly. The air Service mechanic quickly kept the accommodation ladder and closed the cabin door.

Liu An and Zheng Daming entered the cockpit and re – checked the items before take – off as fast as they could. Then, they applied for release to the control personnel through the communication channel.

“Beijing, Z999TY, parking space E9. Heading to the three mountains. Please apply for permission!” Zheng Da Ming, who was in charge of communication, said.

Z999TY was actually the plane’s registration number. This registration number was quite interesting. Li Yifu had chosen the biggest letter Z and the biggest three – digit number 999. It implied that his Grandmaster held the highest position in his heart. As for TY, it was the first letter of peach blossom company’s pinyin. Li Yifu had already decided to give this plane to Xia ruofei when they were registering.

The administrator’s voice came through the channel at once.”Z999TY, able to fly to San Shan along the planned route. Take – off runway 36R, zishikou 32d departure, answering plane 6430 ...”

Zheng Da Ming quickly recorded the information given by the administrator, and Liu An, who was synchronized with the listening frequency, began to set up the answering machine and other procedures.

After Zheng Da Ming repeated and confirmed that there were no mistakes, he immediately applied for a rejection. The management also approved the application at the first moment.

This made many of the flights on the frequency who had been waiting for a long time quite dissatisfied. All of them were silently criticizing this fellow for cutting the queue.

Taxiing was the next step after the launch. Taitai also approved the taxiing application immediately. Along the way, it also asked the planes at various nodes of the runway to stop and wait. This Gulfstream G650 business jet came to the runway entrance without any obstructions under the watchful eyes of the public. In order to let it cross the runway, taitai even temporarily held down an aircraft on the runway waiting to take off. It was only approved to take off after the Gulfstream business jet had crossed the runway.

Soon, the Gulfstream plane was allowed to take off after a short stop at the runway.

The pre – Flight preparations had already been completed. Liu An, who was in charge of the take – off control, immediately pushed the accelerator to the take – off thrust, while Zheng Daming was responsible for monitoring the instrument data.

“V1 ... Lift the wheel!”

Liu An gently pulled the control stick, and the plane lightly jumped off the runway and rushed into the gray sky of Beijing.

“Leaving Beijing, Z999TY, track 36R off ground, crossing 500 to 1500. Answering machine 6430, at your command!” Zheng Da Ming began to contact the exit control.

“Z999TY, I’ve got it on the radar.” The exit control officer said,”Zishi pass 32D, exit. Continue with 1500.”

“Continue to the 1500, Z999TY,” Zheng Da Ming repeated.

Everything was normal after the plane took off. After passing the established departure procedure, the plane gradually climbed to the cruise altitude.

At this time, a voice came from the channel,””Z999TY, fly straight to LADIX!”

Liu An and Zheng Daming were both stunned for a moment. They turned their heads at the same time and looked at each other, both revealing an incredulous expression.

If the flight was carried out according to the instructions in the frequency, the flight could be shortened by a lot. This was because the flight route was connected by route points according to the flight plan, so the flight process did not follow a straight line to the end as many people imagined.

Although the sky was boundless, there were so many flying vehicles flying in the sky every day. Naturally, they had to follow certain rules. There were strict requirements for the flight route and altitude. Otherwise, the sky would be in chaos.

It could be said that a route point was equivalent to a node that connected together to form an invisible “highway.” However, this “road” was a little different from the roads on the ground. This was a three – dimensional space. In addition to the speed and direction, there were also differences in height. It was equivalent to a three – dimensional traffic network.

There were more restricted airspace near Beijing, and the plane often had to make big turns in the sky. Now, the frequency indicated that they had cut off the turns and taken a straight route, removing several middle flight points.

However, Liu An clearly remembered that if he were to fly straight, he would definitely have to pass through the No – Fly zone designated by the Air Force. Moreover, this was not the temporary no – Fly zone designated by today’s small – scale exercise, but a no – Fly zone that had been set up all year round and belonged to the Air Force training airspace.

Zheng Da Ming suspected that he had heard wrong, and asked,”Are you flying to LADIX?”

“Correct!” The voice in the channel said indifferently.

“But that would mean entering a no – Fly zone!” Zheng Da Ming couldn’t help but remind him. He thought that the administrator had made a mistake in commanding.

Unexpectedly, the voice in the channel said,””I’ve received instructions from the Air Force to direct you to LADIX. You will see two j -10s two nautical miles ahead. Just follow them!”

Liu An and Zheng Daming couldn’t help but open their mouths wide, but they were still very professional. They immediately changed the settings on the flight computer. After clicking “confirm,” the originally curved route suddenly became a clear straight line.

The plane also slowly changed its route under the control of the autopilot and flew according to the new planned route.

The two of them looked outside attentively. Sure enough, two j -10s appeared in their field of vision.

The two fighter jets had obviously discovered the Gulfstream G650. They separated to the left and right. One of them flew side by side with the Gulfstream plane, while the other shook its wings and led the way in front of the Gulfstream plane.

Liu An immediately changed to manual pilot mode and followed behind the j -10.

The two experienced pilots sat in the cockpit, feeling extremely excited and shocked.

This was the first time they had encountered such a thing in their many years of work.

Was this considered a fighter escort? This treatment was almost comparable to that of a national leader.

In fact, the two j -10s were just carrying out normal flight training in this airspace. They had received instructions that a Gulfstream public jet needed to cross the No – Fly zone due to an emergency. They were asked to come over to guide the flight so as not to affect the training of other planes in the airspace. It was just a coincidence.

Soon, with two j -10s accompanying them, the Gulfstream G650 commercial plane approached the edge of the No – Fly zone. At this time, the pilot on the fighter plane waved at the Gulfstream and then quickly turned to leave.

Liu An and Zheng Daming seemed to have experienced a magical dream.

Although the following flight was not as exaggerated as the “fighter escort,” it still made Liu An and Zheng Daming Marvel. The regional adjustments along the way often directed them to fly directly to a certain flight route point. It felt like they were basically flying in a straight line from Beijing to the Sanshan.

The flight was supposed to take about two hours, but with this direct flight, it only took slightly more than an hour before the plane was already close to the three mountains.

Moreover, there was no delay in the process of landing. He immediately joined the sequence without any circling or flying.

At about threeo’ clock in the afternoon, the Gulfstream plane had landed smoothly on the runway of the Changping International Airport in San Shan.

After landing, a guide car directly led the plane to a very close parking spot.

Xia ruofei looked out of the window and saw an Air Force mengshi SUV waiting on the tarmac. He knew that this must have been arranged by elder song. They were racing against time!

When Song Wei stood up, she was so nervous that she stumbled. Xia ruofei quickly grabbed her arm and said,””Don’t worry ... Today’s flight was very smooth. We saved at least an hour. Uncle song will be fine. ”

Song Wei nodded her head and said,”RUO Fei, let’s go!”

The flight crew knew that Xia ruofei was in a hurry, so the plane was stable. While they were still going through the after – landing inspection, the flight service mechanic had already come to open the hatch and lowered the ramp.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei stepped off the plane. An Air Force Lieutenant Colonel walked over quickly and saluted.”Are you Mr. Xia ruofei and Ms. Song Wei?”

“We are!” Xia ruofei said.

“I’ve received orders to bring you two to the military general Hospital!” The Air Force Lieutenant Colonel said.

“You’ve worked hard!” Xia ruofei nodded and said,”time is of the essence. Let’s talk in the car!”

“Alright, please!” The Air Force Lieutenant Colonel said in a straightforward manner.

Xia ruofei and Song Wei got into the SUV. The Air Force Lieutenant Colonel said to the driver,””Drive! With the fastest speed!”

“Understood!” The squad leader driving the car said calmly.

The off – Road vehicle’s engine made a loud roar and directly rushed to the exit.

They must have exceeded the speed limit on the tarmac, but no one would care about that now.

The situation was urgent, and everything was to fight for every minute and second.

It was no exaggeration to say that this was a race with the god of death!

The military had completed the procedures in advance. Xia ruofei and Song Wei did not have to go through the gate and left in the mengshi off – Road vehicle. The car drove out of the restricted area of the airport and headed in the direction of San Shan city.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
