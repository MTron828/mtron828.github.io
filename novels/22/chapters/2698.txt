Just as Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou were bewildered, Xia ruofei’s eyes flashed with a trace of disdain. He said indifferently,””Back then, I had three choices. I won’t talk about the other one, but one of the two choices was the ownership of Paradise Island, and the other was three billion US dollars. I chose the former. ”

Speaking of this, Xia ruofei revealed a playful smile and looked at Wang Boshan,””Mr. Wang, if I wanted 3 billion dollars, would I need to go through so much trouble to get Peach Blossom Island and then transfer it to someone else? I’ve also spent a lot of time, manpower, and resources on this. It’s not like there’s a hole in my brain ...”

Although Xia ruofei’s tone was sarcastic and his words were not pleasant to hear, Wang Boshan secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

It turned out that he was complaining about the lack of money! Wang Boshan said in his heart.

As long as Xia ruofei was willing to talk about money, it would be great news. To the star Seizer sect, the stars Corporation was just an external organization in the secular world. The purpose of making money was also to exchange for cultivation resources.

At present, what cultivation resource could be more precious than the Paradise Island?

As long as they could take down Peach Blossom Island, the star Seizer sect would not hesitate to give Xia ruofei the entire stars Corporation, let alone the money. They would even think that they had taken advantage of Xia ruofei and would probably laugh at him even when they were sleeping at night.

Of course, Wang Boshan could not do something like that. There must be something wrong with anything out of the ordinary. If he had proposed to use stars Corporation to exchange for the peach Garden Island, even if Xia ruofei was not smart, he would definitely think that the peach Garden Island had a special value that he had not discovered. On the contrary, it might be a rare commodity and he would not want to sell it rashly.

Therefore, the price that Wang Boshan proposed at the beginning was basically in line with the market rules. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He and Zheng Yongshou weren’t afraid of Xia ruofei’s exorbitant demand. They were more worried that Xia ruofei wouldn’t even talk about money and would be determined to keep Paradise Island in his hands.

After all, Xia ruofei was a successful person with financial freedom. No matter how much money he had, it was just a number. And Xia ruofei was so young. Perhaps he liked the feeling of being the island owner? Moreover, with such a large private island, how much face would he have in front of his friends?

As for the money, so what if it was three or four billion more? How much money could a person spend in their lifetime?

Fortunately, Xia ruofei didn’t make it a definite statement. Instead, he revealed that he had given up on the three billion USD and chose the peach source Island.

From Wang Boshan’s point of view, there was room for discussion!

Wang Boshan quickly said,”director Xia, I really don’t know the situation you’re talking about.” If that’s the case, it’s indeed not appropriate for us to offer 3 billion USD ... However, our stars Corporation is preparing to start a big tourism project in the South Pacific island, and Paradise Island happens to be an indispensable part of our plan. As long as we can get the development and ownership rights of Paradise Island, the price can still be negotiated!”

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”CEO Wang, I’m not short of money. I can say that I have more than ten lifetimes worth of money. Besides, my company is making money for me every second.” To tell you the truth, I quite like the Paradise Island. The air, the sun, the sand, the sea ... These things can’t be bought with money. ”

“3.5 billion US dollars!” Wang Boshan said directly,”director Xia, everything has a price. The peach source Island is no exception. For the sake of the company’s grand strategy, I’m willing to offer a premium on the basis of the valuation. ”

When Wang Boshan said this, he gave Zheng Yongshou a look, signaling him to calm down, then he continued,””Of course, we are very clear about President Xia’s net worth. We also know that President Xia has so much money that he can’t finish spending it. However, 3.5 billion USD isn’t a small amount. I don’t think anyone would complain about having too much money, right? With 3.5 billion USD, President Xia can definitely buy an Island with a much better environment than Paradise Island. There are many such islands in the South Pacific Ocean that can be bought as long as you have the money. ”

Xia ruofei knew that the time was right. If he continued, it would be too much.

Thus, he revealed a slightly moved expression, as if he had been struggling in his heart. Finally, he revealed a helpless expression and asked,””Mr. Wang, can you guys afford that much cash?”

“Don’t worry about that, President Xia!” Wang Boshan smiled and said,”I’m sure you know the strength of stars Corporation, President Xia. Although 3.5 billion US dollars is a lot, we can still raise it in a short time. And ... If the money isn’t in place, President Xia won’t transfer the ownership of Peach Blossom Island to us, right?”

Xia ruofei said,”since you have so much money, just like what you said, CEO Wang, you can totally buy an Island much better than Paradise Island!” Why did he have to spend so much money to buy Paradise Island? This doesn’t make sense!”

Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou’s hearts trembled. They knew that Xia ruofei was not an easy person to deal with. Qianqian was able to have such a career at this age. She was not easy to fool. If they were not careful, they would give themselves away.

Fortunately, before Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou came out, they had already discussed what to say.

Therefore, Wang Boshan did not panic at all. He said with a smile,””President Xia, as I said just now, it’s mainly for the sake of our company’s overall strategy. The peach Garden Island and the nearby islands are all part of our company’s development plan. The geographical location and scenery of Peach Garden Island are irreplaceable. Without this link, the entire Tourism Development Plan will be missing a key element, which means that the whole project will be useless. It’s for this reason that we’re willing to buy it from you at such a high price. I’m sure you’re well aware of the market value of Peach Blossom Island, President Xia. The price we’re offering is definitely the highest. Even if you want to sell it in the future, you won’t be able to sell it for a higher price than this. “
