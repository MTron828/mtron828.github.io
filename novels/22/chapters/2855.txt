2856 A dream start (2)

Xia ruofei’s position was about 36 to 37 meters away from the goal. To the opposing defenders, this was a relatively safe distance, so Herona’s Center – backs did not rush up. They just stood in their defensive positions and made sure that they did not lose their positions.

The center – back did not press on, nor did he immediately make a move to interfere. Xia ruofei naturally noticed the gap in the shot. He even had time to glance at Herona’s goalkeeper and found that the goalkeeper’s position was relatively closer to the front. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei would not be polite.

He did not wait for the ball to fall to the ground at all. Using the inertia from turning around and rushing over, his left foot was firmly planted in the grass, and his right foot quickly and widely swung. His thigh drove his calf, and he firmly kicked the middle of the football.

There was a loud bang, and the nearby players even trembled involuntarily.

The football was like a cannonball fired from a heavy cannon, whistling straight to the dead end of the top left corner of the goal.

The speed of the ball was too fast. It was a 37 – meter shot, but in the blink of an eye, it had reached the goal.

The Herona Center – back, who was defending a little further ahead of the penalty area line, even felt a strong wind brush past his face. His face hurt from Xia ruofei’s shot just now. The football just happened to brush past his ear.

And when the Herona goalkeeper realized that Xia ruofei was shooting directly, he almost reflexively pounced to the left.

This was also because the shooting distance was still relatively far. Otherwise, at this speed, the ball would have already entered the goal by the time the goalkeeper reacted.

But the Herona goalkeeper was still too far for him to reach. He felt that his fingertips were about to touch the football, but at that moment, the speed of the football seemed to increase a little. It brushed past his fingertips and continued to rise, and then went into the corner between the left pillar and the crossbar.

The accuracy of the shot was so high that it was outrageous. The ball just happened to drill into the dead corner of the upper left corner, but it did not touch the pillar or the crossbar at all. It was only after it hit the net with a bang that the net was knocked back violently.

By the time everyone came back to their senses, the football was already spinning around in the goal line.

It had only been 15 seconds since the referee blew the whistle to start the game and the goal was scored.

These 15 seconds included when iglasias passed the ball to Wu Lei, who paused for a second or so, and then used a big kick to dribble the ball to the front; The ball flew in the air for a few seconds. Xia ruofei caught the ball at a position of about 37 to 38 meters. He stopped the ball with his chest and immediately picked the ball to pass. Then, before the ball landed, he shot it with his foot.

Throughout the entire process, Herona’s players did not touch the ball. The Spanish players did not touch the ball either, except for iglessias and Wu Lei, who kicked off.

In just 15 seconds, Spain had taken a one – goal lead. It was a dream start!

Many of the Spanish fans were still looking for a seat when they saw the fans beside them stand up. The entire Stadium went into an uproar. The fans who were looking for a seat looked at the field with a dumbfounded expression and found that the Herona goalkeeper was gloomily fishing for the ball from the net. The Spanish players had not even reached their first sprint, but they had already turned around and rushed towards Xia ruoxin.

Xia ruofei did not know that his first shot was so accurate from such a long distance. He could not help but smile brightly and spread his arms. Iglasias, who was running at the front, rushed over excitedly and hugged Xia ruofei.

“Boss! You’re simply too awesome!” “Xia ruofei!” Iglasias kept shouting beside Xia ruofei.

Even though the huge body of aegleysias was charging at him at such a high speed, Xia ruofei was still as steady as a mountain. He stood on the spot without moving an inch. On the other hand, it was as if the giant had crashed into an unmoving mountain. However, he was so excited that he did not feel any pain.

More and more Spanish players rushed over. Wu Lei, Granello, mark Roca ... Everyone hugged each other tightly and surrounded Xia ruofei in the middle.

And the players of Herona were all dumbfounded. Everyone stood in their positions the moment the goal was scored, with a confused look on their faces.

The Spanish players celebrated for a while, but the time on the scoreboard only skipped a minute.

Everyone had just gone on stage and had not even entered their competitive state. Their bodies were not even warm at all, and they had already been hit by such a heavy blow. One could imagine how depressed they were.

Before the game, Herona had fully estimated the difficulty of the game, especially Xia ruofei’s targeted arrangement. After all, from his limited performance in the game, Xia ruofei was undoubtedly the most comprehensive and most threatening player in Spain.

The head coach of Herona had arranged for someone to specifically keep an eye on Xia ruofei and coordinate with the area Defense. The purpose was to keep an eye on Xia ruofei and not give him any chance to lift his leg.

However, he did not expect that the match had just started and the Spain players were rushing up all the way, causing the local players to be a little flustered. The defensive midfielder responsible for marking Xia ruofei could not resist at all.

In fact, even if Xia ruofei had passed the defensive midfielder, that position was not too dangerous. After all, the distance was too far, and Herona’s entire defensive line had blocked the position.

But who would have thought that Xia ruofei would kick him from so far away? And with just a kick, it actually went in directly. This was a completely unreasonable crushing!

Other than China’s PP sports broadcasting the match live, many other sports channels around the world were also broadcasting it. On one hand, Espanyol had been in the limelight this week. Not only did they kill bar?a, but they were also the absolute focus outside of the field. On the other hand, Xia ruofei had also expressed his interest in participating in this match, which made it even more interesting. On the other hand, the game’s opening time was set at oneo’ clock in the afternoon to take care of the Chinese audience. It basically did not clash with the other La Liga teams ‘game time, so there were naturally more platforms to broadcast the game.

When Xia ruofei stopped the ball with his chest, most of the commentators just praised Xia ruofei’s technique. After all, for such a long distance high ball, the chest needed to be very accurate to dissipate the force, otherwise the ball would easily bounce far away.

However, Xia ruofei’s dribble and dribble was amazing. Some commentators whistled and everyone gave him all kinds of praises. They thought that this dribble and dribble fully demonstrated Xia ruofei’s spirituality in football.

However, before the football commentators could finish their praises, Xia ruofei did not wait for the ball to land and immediately shot.

The speed of the ball was so fast that it even left an afterimage on the broadcast screen. If someone blinked when watching the ball, they might find that the ball had already entered the goal in the next moment.

Football commentators all over the world fell silent almost at the same time, followed by a burst of passionate commentary in various languages.

“Goal...Goal...Goal ...” The ESPN commentator repeated the word “goal” at the top of his voice. His mind seemed to be completely blank.

“Gulllllll ...” The commentator of the Spain Channel 4 said in a measured voice. The ending tone was like an air defense alarm, fully demonstrating the volume of his lungs.

After a series of “goals” in various languages, the commentators came back to their senses and began to rack their brains to think of all kinds of “our” words. They were not stingy with giving them to Xia ruofei.

“Although there is still a certain gap between this goal and La Liga’s fastest goal record, it is more exciting than that!”

“Xia said before the game that he wanted to respond to those who were prejudiced against the Chinese players with actual actions. He did it in only 15 seconds!”

“Xia is indeed Mr. Bo of the world! He has once again dedicated a wonderful world wave!”
