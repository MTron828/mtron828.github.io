Chapter 325: I’ll give you a tip_1

“RUO Fei ...” Just as Xia ruofei had expected, Liang Qichao’s voice sounded listless. He must have had some reservations about going to America. At this moment, the elevator arrived. As Xia ruofei entered the elevator, he laughed and said,””Brother Liang, I heard that you’ve been chosen by elder Tang. Congratulations!” “Brother, if you didn’t mention this, we could still be friends ...” Liang Qichao said gloomily. Xia ruofei laughed. The elevator arrived at the underground parking lot. Xia ruofei walked out of the elevator and walked towards his car. He asked,””Brother Liang, I’m very curious as to how uncle Liang managed to convince you.” “How can I convince you? How can I convince him?” Liang Qichao shouted angrily,”he forced me! It’s the oppression of feudal patriarchy!” Then, Liang Qichao “cried” and complained about his father, Liang Weimin, for a few minutes. Xia ruofei was overjoyed and listened with a smile. However, he could tell the whole story from Liang Qichao’s words. It turned out that in order to get Liang Qichao to agree to go to United States, Liang Weimin had not only used all the best methods to deal with rich second generation heirs, such as freezing credit cards, stopping the distribution of pocket money, forbidding him from going out, and so on, but he had also used an even more ruthless method. Liang Weimin told Liang Qichao that if he didn’t want to go to United States, he had to arrange his marriage immediately. It turned out that Liang Qichao had a “fiancée” in name, but she was actually the daughter of an old friend of Liang Weimin ‘s. At the same time, this old friend was also a business partner of Liang Weimin’ s. This marriage had been decided when the two of them had a drink together. Naturally, Liang Qichao was strongly against it. Moreover, the girl had been studying abroad, so Liang Weimin did not force Liang Qichao to do anything. However, two months ago, this girl had returned to the country and they had met. What Liang Qichao did not expect was that this female master’s student who had returned from abroad had fallen for him for some reason. She had actually taken the initiative to attack him, but Liang Qichao did not have any feelings for her at all. Moreover, the two families had been friends for generations, and the elders of both sides had made a verbal agreement, which made Liang Qichao’s head hurt even more. Now, Liang Weimin was taking the opportunity to bring up the past. He said that if Liang Qichao stayed in the country, they could get married. Liang Qichao thought about it. His father was in control of his finances, and he had nowhere to run to. On top of that, that girl was still chasing after him. Liang Qichao’s head hurt when he thought about it. It was a bad thing for both of them, so he might as well hide in the United States. And so, Liang Weimin happily got his way. “Ruofei, I’m going to the United States tomorrow,” Liang Qichao said.”I don’t know when we’ll see each other again. Why don’t we have a drink at noon?” “Sure!” Xia ruofei replied readily,”where are you now? Why don’t I decide the place!” “Don ‘t, don’ t, don ‘t. It’s boring to eat outside!” Liang Qichao said,”just come to my succulent stall! I’m handing over my work here! I’ll ask the chef in the canteen to make some dishes for us, and we can have a drink in my office ... By the way, after my dad came back, he praised the white wine you brewed. Can you bring two bottles over at noon?” “No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”wait for me. I’ll be right there ...” Xia ruofei got into the car and took out a few bottles of aged wine Eight Immortals from his storage space. He then started the car and left the Shangri – La hotel, heading straight for the immortal meat stall in the Anhua District. After parking the car in front of the office building of the immortal meat stall, Xia ruofei walked to Liang Qichao’s office with wine in his hand. Liang Qichao was lying on his desk in a daze. When he saw Xia ruofei come in, he raised his eyes and said listlessly,””They’re coming! Have a seat ...” Xia ruofei smiled and placed the wine on the coffee table. He sat down and said,””Brother Liang, people are all happy when they go abroad. Why do you feel like you’re going through hell?” Liang Qichao rolled his eyes and said,”what’s so good about going abroad?” He was unfamiliar with the people and the place, and he had to work at his grandfather’s company. How could he be as free as he was in the country? He drank the wine and soaked in the girls ‘bath ... Sigh! The good days are gone forever!” Liang Qichao said as he stood up and walked to the sofa. He passed a cigarette to Xia ruofei and lit one up for himself. He took a deep puff and sat down beside Xia ruofei.”Ruofei, the food and wine will be here soon. Have a few drinks with me at noon! We won’t have many chances to drink in the future!” “We’ll have plenty of time to drink when you return home in glory!” Xia ruofei said with a smile. “Sigh ... It’s easier said than done!” Liang Qichao shook his head with a bitter smile. At this moment, the chef from the canteen walked into the office with a tray and placed the dishes on the coffee table one by one. After running back and forth three times, the coffee table was almost full. Xia ruofei did a rough count and found that there were at least ten dishes. “Brother Liang, it’s just the two of us drinking. Why did you bring so many dishes?” Xia ruofei asked with a smile. “I heard that it’s hard to eat Chinese food overseas.” Liang Qichao said seriously,”I want to eat more before I go abroad ...” Xia ruofei laughed,”who did you hear that from?” There are Chinatown everywhere in the United States, and there’s no difference between living in the Chinese community and living in China. I heard that some people can’t even speak a word of English and still live there for the rest of their lives!” Xia ruofei realized that Liang Qichao was still very resistant to going to United States, so he said some comforting words while drinking. However, it did not seem to be of much use. Liang Qichao did not seem to be interested. Even the Eight Immortals wine was tasteless to him. Xia ruofei thought for a while and clinked his glass with Liang Qichao ‘S. He finished the wine in his glass and said,””Brother Liang, I heard from elder Tang that you’ll be going to United States with Liang Xiaojun! Then you can’t do it in your current state! You’ve already lost to him before you even go. If you can’t beat him in any way in the United States, Won’t You Be embarrassing uncle Liang?” “Liang Xiaojun was originally a business administration major, and he even went to the United States to study. He even interned at my maternal grandfather’s company. How can I compete with him when he has such a high starting point ...” Liang Qichao said, annoyed. “Even so, you can’t just throw the pot to the ground!” Xia ruofei said,”Liang Xiaojun is highly educated, but he’s not human! And how long had he been in society? He may be better than you in theory, but in terms of actual combat, you’ve already started your own business for so many years, you might not lose to him, right?” Liang Qichao shook his head and said,”ruofei, in the year that Liang Xiaojun has returned to the country, he has completed a few big projects for his father’s company. He is actually quite capable.” Xia ruofei muttered to himself for a while. Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he chuckled.”Brother Liang, I have a suggestion ...” “Go ahead,” “I heard from elder Tang that after you arrive in the United States, you will go to their company’s basic level positions to train.” Xia ruofei said,”then ... Why don’t you apply to the old man and go to Paradise Farm in Australia?”
