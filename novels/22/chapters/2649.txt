2650 Chapter 1450 – missed (2)

Wang Boshan saw that Gu Yong was getting impatient and quickly said,””Brother, we’re looking for Mr. Xia to discuss a business deal. Can I trouble you to give me Mr. Xia’s contact information?”

“No way!” Gu Yong shook his head. You can’t just give your boss’s phone number to anyone! Besides ... I don’t have the boss’s contact information!”

Gu Yong was not speaking nonsense. In the siheyuan, only Wu Qiang had Xia ruofei’s contact information. The others did not need it as they were all under Wu Qiang’s management. They were still one level away from Xia ruofei!

Wang Boshan had been rebuffed several times in a row and could not help but be secretly annoyed. He thought to himself that it was so difficult to deal with even a gatekeeper, it seemed that this time would not be too smooth! He couldn’t flare up. After all, he needed Xia ruofei’s help. If he were to ruin their relationship, it would be hard to talk to him.

He thought for a while and said with a smile,””Brother, we really have something urgent to discuss with Mr. Xia. Could you please help me contact him?”

“Didn’t I already tell you? I really don’t have the boss’s contact information!” Gu Yong frowned slightly and said,”if you’re looking for him to discuss business, why don’t you go to the three mountains? The boss’s company is in San Shan! Shouldn’t they go to the office to discuss business? Even if the boss isn’t there, there must be someone in charge!”

Wang Boshan didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The business he was talking about wasn’t about trading with the Tao Yuan company. What was the use of the Tao Yuan company buying an island? Moreover, Qingyun Island was clearly Xia ruofei’s personal property and had nothing to do with the Paradise Corporation.

Wang Boshan had also checked that Xia ruofei owned almost 100% of the shares of paradise Corporation. This company was actually Xia ruofei’s private property. The professional manager of the company could not make the final decision, so they had to look for Xia ruofei in the end.

He thought for a while and said,”brother, what do you think?” I’ll leave my phone number with you. Please find someone to report to Mr. Xia. If it’s convenient, please ask him to call me back. ”

After that, Wang Boshan took out a gold – stamped business card from his pocket and said,””This is my business card. My job and contact information are on it. I’ll have to trouble you for a while, okay?”

As Wang Boshan spoke, he took out a stack of cash from his pocket, all of which were green US dollars.

He put the cash and business card together and stuffed them into Gu Yong’s hands.

Gu Yong quickly pushed the money away and said,””What are you doing? I don’t want your money!”

“This is the fee for your hard work, just accept it!” Wang Boshan passed the money forward and said.

Gu Yong quickly took a step back and waved his hand.””I’ll keep the business card, but you should keep the money! I’ll report this to the person in charge here, but I can’t guarantee that he won’t help to contact the boss, let alone guarantee that the boss won’t call you back!”

When Wang Boshan heard that, he quickly nodded and said,””Alright! Alright! Thank you, brother! When you contact Mr. Xia, just tell him that I have a business deal that involves billions of dollars to discuss with him! Please ask him to spare some of his precious time and give me a call. ”

The moment Gu Yong heard that it was a few billion dollars, the first thought that came to his mind was that two scammers had come.

However, he saw that the two of them were well – dressed. The clothes they were wearing were not cheap at first glance. Moreover, both of them had a strong aura. Ordinary scammers could not pretend to be them.

In addition, Wang Boshan’s attitude was very good from the beginning to the end. As the saying goes, don’t hit a smiling person, so Gu Yong couldn’t reject him.

He took the name card and said,””I’ll help you pass the message, but I can’t control what the boss decides. But no matter what the result is, I will call and let you know. ”

“Thank you so much!” Wang Boshan expressed his thanks.

Gu Yong nodded and walked into the courtyard with his name card.

Zheng Yongshou, who hadn’t said a word throughout the whole process, looked at the door that was closed again and said,””Boshan, why are you wasting your breath on a mortal? Can’t we just capture him and interrogate him?”

“Martial uncle Zheng, we still have to talk to Xia ruofei about buying the island! It’s best not to have a conflict ...”Wang Boshan smiled apologetically,” it’s just a matter of waiting for a few more days. I believe that as long as we pay a high enough price, he will definitely be tempted! Even if this guard didn’t help us, I’ll come and wait here every day. This is his home, he can’t possibly stay here forever!”

“It’s so troublesome to do things in the secular world!” Zheng Yongshou said in dissatisfaction.

“Martial uncle, let’s find a hotel to settle down in first.” Wang Boshan quickly said,”you can rest in the hotel then. I will come and wait for you every day!”

Zheng Yongshou didn’t have a good way to talk about social experience. He had lived in the star Seizer sect for decades and rarely came to the secular world. Wang Boshan’s social experience was definitely a few streets ahead of his.

Zheng Yongshou finally nodded and said,””Let’s do this! You’d better hurry up to avoid any more trouble!”

If it wasn’t for the sake of sharing this great contribution, Zheng Yongshou definitely wouldn’t be willing to stay in the capital and breathe in the dirty air.

Wang Boshan heaved a sigh of relief and said to himself,”‘I’ve finally appeased martial uncle Zheng. It’s been so hard on me ...’

The two of them continued to walk through liuhai Lane, then took a taxi to a nearby hotel.

……

Fortunately, Zheng Yongshou and Wang Boshan did not listen to Gu Yong’s suggestion to chase after him to the three mountains. Otherwise, they would be doomed to meet another empty target. Xia ruofei’s destination was not the three mountains at all, but the capital of the Jiangsu Province, Jin Ling city.

With the speed of the Gulfstream G650, it would only take about an hour to fly from Beijing to Jinling.

Hence, Xia ruofei did not rest in the back cabin after boarding the plane. Instead, he sat on the leather sofa in the middle of the cabin and sipped on a glass of red wine while thinking about the next arrangements.

At this moment, Xia ruofei’s phone rang. It was not the ringtone of an incoming call, but the unique sound of WeChat voice chat.

There was no cell phone signal in the plane, but there was WiFi. The internet on the plane was through satellite communication. As long as the WiFi device was turned on, the cabin could be connected to the network.

Xia ruofei swiped on his phone and saw that it was a voice call from Wu Qiang. He must have used WeChat voice chat because his phone could not be connected.

This type of Wi – Fi wasn’t very fast, but it could handle normal voice communication.

Xia ruofei picked up the call and put the phone to his ear.””Wu Qiang, is there an urgent matter?”

Wu Qiang’s voice came from the phone,”Brother Xia, I do have something to do, but there’s no rush. Why don’t we wait until your plane lands?”

“You’re still trying to keep me in suspense?” Xia ruofei laughed and scolded,”if you have something to say, say it quickly! The internet signal isn’t particularly good at high altitude. It might be cut off in a while. ”

“Yes!” Wu Qiang said,”brother Xia, after I came back from the airport after sending you off, Gu Yong, who was in charge of the front yard, came to report to me. He said that not long after you left, two people came to look for you. They also said ... They have a big business deal worth billions of US dollars to discuss with you and would like you to return his call. Brother Xia, when I heard that there was a business deal worth billions of dollars, I was afraid that I would delay your business, so I quickly reported it to you. ”

“A few billion dollars?” Xia ruofei raised his eyebrows.”It’s really a big business competition!”

Xia ruofei quickly analyzed the situation. If the other party wasn’t exaggerating, then this number was really too big. Even if peach blossom company were to sell all of its assets, it wouldn’t be worth that much. The only thing that was worth a little bit was the Peach Blossom Island that they had just taken down. Could it be ...

Thinking of this, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but frown. After a moment of silence, he asked,””Wu Qiang, did they say what they do for a living?”

Wu Qiang said,”no, they didn ‘t. But they left a business card. I took a look at this person’s title. He is the CEO of Stars Group. His name is Wang Boshan ...” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Stars Corporation?” Xia ruofei felt that the name was familiar, but he could not recall it. After a moment of silence, he said,”take a picture of this person’s business card and send it to me!”
