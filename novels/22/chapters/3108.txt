3109 Finally meeting (1)

At this point, yang Xincheng looked around and his gaze landed on Chen Xuan, who was busy coding. He shouted,””Little Chen! Chen Xuan! Come over here for a moment ...”

When yang Xincheng arranged for everyone to maintain order in the office, Chen Xuan naturally knew that the chairman was coming to inspect. However, it didn’t make a difference to him. Whether the chairman came or not, it didn’t matter to him. He didn’t have any plans to amaze the world with a single feat in front of the chairman.

However, yang Xincheng was his superior. He naturally couldn’t refuse yang Xincheng’s request.

Chen Xuan looked at the code that he was writing at a crucial point in his work with some reluctance. In the end, he stopped what he was doing and stood up to walk toward yang Xincheng.

When Xia ruofei heard yang Xincheng call out Chen Xuan’s name, he could not help but be stunned.

Then, he caught sight of Chen Xuan, who had just stood up. His eyes narrowed slightly as he scanned Chen Xuan’s body. However, his expression returned to normal very quickly.

However, Xia ruofei’s heart was already in a state of shock.

Chen Xuan’s appearance in his company and his position as a bottom – Level employee was something that he had not expected.

At that moment, countless thoughts appeared in Xia ruofei’s mind.

Why was Chen Xuan here? Did the first heaven society investigate my situation? What was Chen Xuan’s purpose in coming to paradise Corporation?

Even with Xia ruofei’s mental fortitude, he was still a little distracted in such a situation.

Fortunately, he was able to control his emotions. At least, yang Xincheng, Feng Jing, and the others couldn’t tell.

Xia ruofei forced himself to calm down as Chen Xuan was already in front of them.

In reality, Chen Xuan did not know Xia ruofei’s true appearance. Due to his cultivation technique, Chen Xuan could not tell that Xia ruofei was in the Golden core stage. To be more precise, Chen Xuan could not tell that Xia ruofei was a cultivator.

Hence, even though Chen Xuan thought that Xia ruofei looked familiar, he did not take it to heart.

No matter how high Xia ruofei’s prestige was in the Paradise Corporation and how popular he was on the internet, he was just an ordinary person in Chen Xuan’s eyes. Naturally, he would not spend too much effort on Xia ruofei. Hence, Chen Xuan only felt a sense of familiarity with Xia ruofei. He concluded that he might have seen some photos and videos of Xia ruofei when he was studying the information of the Paradise Corporation. That was why he felt this sense of familiarity.

“President yang, you were looking for me?” Chen Xuan asked in a tone that was neither haughty nor humble.

“Xiao Chen, this is the company’s chairman, Mr. Xia ruofei,” said yang Xincheng quickly.

“Hello, Chairman!” Chen Xuan then greeted Xia ruofei before turning to Feng Jing and Dong Yun.”Hello, CEO Feng! Hello, President Dong!”

Xia ruofei’s eyes lit up. He had been observing Chen Xuan’s expression. At least, Chen Xuan had not recognized him yet. With Xia ruofei’s judgment, he could tell that Chen Xuan was not pretending.

Chen Xuan was now quite famous in paradise Corporation, especially after he solved a bug that had been troubling everyone for a while. Even Feng Jing couldn’t stop praising him.

As such, Feng Jing and Dong Yun both smiled and nodded in response.

As Xia ruofei’s mind raced, he smiled and did not speak.

Yang Xincheng pointed at Chen Xuan and said,””Chairman, Xiao Chen only joined our company recently, but his technical level is very high. He’s an expert in coding! During this period of time, Xiao Chen’s work had been outstanding and he had successfully solved several difficult problems. It can be said that it’s because Xiao Chen came to work in our company that the peach blossom mall project can be so smoothly pushed forward!”

Yang Xincheng’s evaluation was extremely high. However, the programmers who heard his words didn’t feel uncomfortable at all. They praised Chen Xuan’s skills for being impressive, and they were all convinced.

The evaluation criteria for programmers were very clear. If their code was better than most people ‘s, then they were awesome!

Feng Jing also smiled and said,”Chairman, Xiao Chen was personally recruited by President yang. It’s all thanks to him during this period of time. Otherwise, the peach blossom mall project might not have been completed on time. Not to mention now, the progress of all the sub – projects has already exceeded the schedule!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””Good code is hard currency! Xiao Chen, thank you for choosing to join our paradise Corporation! I’ll remember you. Work hard and you’ll have a bright future!”

“Thank you for your encouragement, Chairman,” Chen Xuan replied.”I will continue to work hard!”

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,”don’t worry. The company will never forget any employee who has contributed to the company!” In terms of treatment, I will definitely not treat everyone badly! CEO Feng, since Chen Xuan has been performing so well recently, you guys have to show him the reward! It’s also a form of motivation for the other employees!”

Feng Jing smiled.”Don’t worry, Chairman. His salary and performance will be linked to his performance. On top of that, the development Department will also receive some special project bonuses. So, Xiao Chen’s income this month will definitely not be low!”

“That’s good!” Xia ruofei nodded and looked at Chen Xuan. He smiled and said,”Xiao Chen, you can go back to your work!”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
