2243 Bringing in ingredients (1)

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”it’s fine!” It’s fine! It’s not heavy ...”

“President Xia, you should leave it to me!” Peng Chang ran over and took the box of vegetables from Xia ruofei and Zhang Xing.

Actually, Xia ruofei could lift it with one finger. However, for the sake of the show, he had to carry it with Zhang Xing.

Peng Chang carried the box of vegetables and ran to the kitchen. He Jiong saw this and shouted from behind,”Pengpeng! Where to? He still had to wash and choose the vegetables later! The pond is in the courtyard!”

“Oh, oh, oh!” Peng Chang grinned in embarrassment, revealing his signature neat white teeth. He moved the box of vegetables to the side of the pool and put it down.

He Jiong smiled and said,”President Xia, you’ve worked hard!” You’ve worked hard! I’ll go wash the vegetables! You should sit down and rest for a while! I’ll make some tea! The peach blossom Brand Da Hong Pao, the taste is righteous!”

After he finished speaking, He Jiong even winked at the camera.

“Sure!” Xia ruofei laughed.

Xia ruofei took two steps towards the pergola and turned back. He asked,””By the way, teacher he, I have something to ask you ...”

“President Xia, you don’t have to be so polite. Just tell me what you need!” He Jiong said with a smile.

“That’s right ... The Jie Ji group is too stingy. They only pay 100 yuan a day for food. We can’t add in a little more, can we?” Xia ruofei asked.

He Jiong held back his laughter and glanced at the director under the roof, then said,”The director will definitely not agree! You’re not thinking of sponsoring us for some food, are you?”

The director didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The program’s flow and rules had been carefully planned. Limiting the food expenses was naturally to make it more interesting. Otherwise, which host and guests participating in the program wouldn’t be able to afford their food expenses?

But didn’t the audience like to see those big stars struggling to buy some food?

At this moment, the voice of the Deputy station head, Gao Jun, came through the director’s headphones,””If director Xia feels that the food expenses are too little, you can ask them to increase it. Just treat it as a special case for this episode!”

Gao Jun didn’t appear at the scene. He was mainly worried that he would affect the host and guests ‘performance by watching the recording. However, even though he did not go to the mushroom house, he had been in a small building next to it the whole time and had been watching the recording from the surveillance camera.

Of course, Gao Jun wouldn’t be so concerned about a show. To put it bluntly, even if the show was a mess and the ratings dropped below freezing point, he would still be able to remain as the Deputy Director. The reason why he had rushed over was naturally because of Xia ruofei. Although he had repeatedly warned the festival team staff, he was still worried that they would not do a good job and might cause Xia ruofei to be neglected.

Therefore, when Gao Jun saw Xia ruofei questioning the food expenses on the monitor, he immediately gave the director an order without thinking.

The director was speechless, but no matter how bad – tempered he was, he didn’t dare to disobey Gao Jun, so he could only pick up the walkie – talkie with a bitter smile.

However, before the director could say anything, Xia ruofei waved his hand and said,””Teacher he, you must be joking. Since the rules of the show are like this, we naturally can’t break the rules at will!”

Then, Xia ruofei asked hesitantly,””But ... What I want to ask is, as a guest of the show, is it against the rules for me to bring some ingredients for everyone to try?”

“Like this?” He Jiong’s eyes turned and he said loudly,”that shouldn’t be counted, right? What do you think, director?”

The set director quickly stood up and waved his hand at He Jiong as he teased him! The high platform could even agree to a direct increase in food expenses, so what was the big deal about the guests bringing some ingredients?

Besides, in the previous two seasons of the show, there were guests who brought some food for everyone when they came. It was just a meeting gift, so it wasn’t against the rules.

“Director Xia, the director agreed to it!” He Jiong said happily.

“Then I’m relieved ...” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I thought this Festival Group was like some restaurants that prohibited the bringing of alcohol and other things ...” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He Jiong almost burst out laughing. Then, he asked curiously,”President Xia, what ingredients did you bring for us?”

“I’ll keep you in suspense for now. Let’s see if you can recognize it later!”Xia ruofei laughed.

With that, Xia ruofei nodded gently at Qin Yanan, who was in the crowd. Qin Yanan immediately understood and walked out towards the small building next door.

After a while, Qin Yanan came back with a small thermal container and handed it to Xia ruofei.

Throughout the whole process, the shooting didn’t stop just because Qin Yanan entered the scene. Anyway, it could still be edited in the post – production, and it didn’t matter if it wasn’t edited. Maybe they could even add subtitles such as “President Xia’s beautiful assistant”!

In the past episodes, there was no lack of shots of the staff next to them. The appropriate use of these shots could instead increase the effect of the show.

He Jiong’s curiosity was piqued as well. He shouted,”Huang Laoshi! Huang Laoshi! Come out for a moment! There’s something good ...”

Huang Lei, who was preparing lunch in the kitchen, put down his knife, turned off the fire, and quickly walked out.

He wiped his hands on his apron and asked,””Teacher he, what’s the good stuff?”
