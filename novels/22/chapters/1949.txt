1950 Small trick (1)

Xia ruofei stood up and made way for Zeng jianzhang. Then, the two of them walked side by side to a signing table that had been prepared.

The two of them sat down behind the table, and the assistant handed over the contract of intent.

After the two signed the contract, they exchanged it and signed it again. It was a symbolic signing ceremony.

In fact, this was just a prop. The real contract of intent had already been signed in the lounge under the witness of the lawyer. It was the same as a lottery winner taking a picture of a prop check.

After all, this contract of intent involved many detailed terms in many aspects, and both parties were very cautious. In this situation, it was impossible to check each one by one, so it must be signed in advance.

Although if the local government wanted to renege on their promise, it was basically a situation where there was no way to Sue, no matter what, the contract still had to be treated with caution.

Moreover, this was a combination of interests in itself. As long as Taoyuan pharmaceutical factory could continue to shine, continue to generate profits and taxes for Changping County, and increase GDP, the possibility of Changping County breaking their promise was very low.

Besides, Xia ruofei was not worried that Changping would go back on their word or wait for the pharmaceutical factory project to start construction. If they really made him angry, he could play his Cards against the rules. Song Qiming, the head of the three mountains, treated him like his own nephew. As long as he was in the right, he could not sit by and watch him get bullied by Changping.

After the contract was signed, Xia ruofei and Zeng jianzhang stood up and shook hands with each other. At the same time, they showed the contract of intent to the camera. Of course, it was only the cover of the folder.

The reporters were also very supportive of Xia ruofei and pressed the shutter. Under the camera light, Xia ruofei, who was wearing a tailored suit, looked very radiant. Even Wu Liqian, who was sitting on the side of the podium, couldn’t help but feel a little lost.

She shook her head lightly and waited for Xia ruofei and Zeng jianzhang to return to their seats before she said,””Next up is the media Q & A segment. I’ll appoint the media friends to ask questions. Please introduce yourself before you ask questions. Thank you for your cooperation!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As soon as Wu Liqian finished speaking, the reporters below the stage immediately raised their arms in unison.

“The lady in orange in the middle of the front row!” Wu Liqian pointed at a female reporter and said.

The female reporter took the microphone from the staff and said,””Thank you, emcee! I’d like to ask Secretary Zeng, during this period of time, there have been rumors on the internet about Deputy Secretary Liu haojun of Changping County’s lifestyle. Can Changping County provide positive and specific information?”

Zeng jianzhang’s face sank slightly. Today was their day to hold their heads up high, but the first reporter came up to them and touched on a sore spot. Wasn’t this too disrespectful?

Xia ruofei maintained his smile. It was none of his business anyway, so he was just a quiet onlooker. That was good.

Wu Liqian also frowned slightly and asked,””My reporter friend, I just reminded you to tell me which media you’re from before you ask questions. You haven’t introduced yourself yet.”

Today’s press conference was arranged in a hurry. As for the media, Changping County wasn’t as well prepared as before. At least, they didn’t give the media some preset questions. But generally speaking, the seating arrangement of reporters was also very particular. This female reporter’s seat was in the middle of the first row, which meant that the media she represented should not be small.

The female reporter showed a reserved smile and slightly raised her chin.””I’m sorry, I forgot! I’m a reporter from Beijing News Group and Yanjing E family network! Secretary Zeng, can you answer my question now?”

Wu Liqian couldn’t help but frown. The questions of new media reporters were often sharper than those of traditional media reporters. Moreover, Yanjing E family website was a website under the Beijing newspaper group. This website was not only a local website in Beijing. In fact, in the past few years, the Yanjing E family website had developed rapidly and was already a comprehensive portal website. Its reporter stations were spread all over the major cities in the country.

This was also the reason why this female reporter could get such a good position. The staff of Changping County must have arranged her position according to the importance of the media.

“I’m sorry,” Wu Liqian said.”Today is the press conference regarding the signing of letter of intent between Changping County and Tao Yuan company. It has nothing to do with the topic. We are ...”

“It’s alright, County Head Wu. I’ll answer this question!”Zeng jianzhang waved his hand.

Wu Liqian looked at Zeng jianzhang, nodded slightly, and closed her mouth.

Zeng jianzhang knew that if he avoided the question, the reporter would make a big fuss about it, and Changping County would be in a more passive position.

These days, Changping County had not responded to this question directly. In fact, they were very passive in public opinion. Since this reporter had brought it up today, they could take this opportunity to clarify.

Of course, there was another reason why Zeng jianzhang had made such a decision.

Zeng jianzhang pondered for a moment, thought about his words, and then said,””Regarding the question raised by this reporter friend, we don’t know the specific situation and can’t confirm the authenticity of the online rumors. “What I can tell everyone here is that comrade Liu haojun has officially submitted his resignation application to the organization. After we reported it, the higher – ups have approved his application. Just yesterday, comrade Liu haojun has completed all the resignation procedures. In terms of organizational and administrative relations, he is no longer a member of our Changping County.”
