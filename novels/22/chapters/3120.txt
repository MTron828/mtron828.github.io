After song Qiming started to cultivate, Xia ruofei could feel his aura growing. In just two to three minutes, song Qiming had reached refined Qi Level 2!

Xia ruofei was overjoyed. At the same time, he quickly put his hand on song Qiming’s back and used his spiritual power to send a message.”Uncle song, I’m going to change the route of the true Qi now. Follow my instructions and guide the true Qi forward!”

Xia ruofei had used spiritual power to communicate with song Qiming because he was worried that song Qiming would be in a state of deep cultivation and could not hear the outside world.

Although song Qiming did not know what cultivation was, he had been at refined Qi Level 1 for a long time, so he was very sensitive to true Qi.

Vital Qi and true Qi came from the same source, but they were of a higher level. The two were of the same lineage.

Therefore, when Xia ruofei’s tiny bit of vital Qi entered song Qiming’s meridians, he immediately sensed it. Then, he immediately followed Xia ruofei’s instructions and mobilized the essential Qi in his body. Under the guidance of Xia ruofei’s vital Qi, he began to circulate his essential Qi according to the meridian circulation route of the corresponding technique of weapon refining Level 2.

Song Qiming’s Qi refining Level 2 cultivation was quickly consolidated. At the same time, his momentum did not decrease at all. He was charging straight towards the realm of Qi refining Level 3.

Under Xia ruofei’s guidance, song Qiming controlled his genuine Qi and circulated it for a few rounds. He quickly familiarized himself with the new Meridian route. Xia ruofei had also been using his spiritual power to communicate with song Qiming, explaining the key points of the second level of the technique.

Song Qiming’s cultivation level was still increasing rapidly, even though he was at refined Qi Level 2. The aura on his body was also getting stronger.

Xia ruofei saw that song Qiming was already familiar with the second stage of Qi cultivation of the “modest Sutra”. He was relieved and retracted his hand. However, he was still monitoring song Qiming’s condition with his mental power.

After about ten minutes, song Qiming started to break through the bottleneck of refined Qi Level 3.

Xia ruofei was also speechless. However, he did not dare to be negligent and paid close attention to song Qiming’s condition. When song Qiming successfully broke through to refined Qi Level 3, he immediately followed the same pattern and injected a wisp of vital Qi into song Qiming’s meridians again. He guided song Qiming to change to the corresponding cultivation technique of refined Qi Level 3 and quickly consolidated his cultivation.

Only Xia ruofei was able to do this because the “modest Sutra” was also derived from the Jade talisman of inheritance. Although he had never cultivated it before, he had a thorough understanding of this technique and had also inherited the cultivation experience of many predecessors.

That was why Xia ruofei was able to guide song Qiming in his cultivation under such circumstances. At the same time, he used his spiritual power to communicate with song Qiming and explained the key points of the technique.

Song Qiming’s rapid progress finally stopped at refined Qi Level 4.

In fact, song Qiming had tried to break through to refined Qi Level 4 several times during the process of cultivation, and the bottleneck had loosened. Xia ruofei even thought that song Qiming might break through to refined Qi Level 4 today.

But at the last moment, the effect of the wild tea had been used up.

Song Qiming’s state of enlightenment was not as strong as before. After all, breaking through was a process that would exhaust one’s energy. If he could not break through with the help of the wild tea, it would be impossible for him to break through.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel that it was a pity.

If song Qiming managed to break through the Qi cultivation Level 4 bottleneck, he would be able to slowly consolidate his cultivation under normal circumstances even if the effect of the wild tea leaves disappeared. However, after failing to break through the Qi cultivation Level 4 bottleneck, song Qiming would have to wait for enough accumulation and the next opportunity to break through.

In comparison, the latter would naturally take more time.

However, Xia ruofei quickly adjusted his state of mind. To any cultivator who had never consumed wild tea before, this was undoubtedly a great opportunity.

When it came to breaking through, one had to have the mentality of ‘if you get it, it’s your fate’. Otherwise, the more rushed you were, the harder it would be to break through.

Song Qiming slowly opened his eyes and looked incredulous.

Even though he did not know much about cultivation and had always thought that Xia ruofei had taught him the so – called “Qi – nurturing technique”, the changes in his body in the short 20 minutes were real. Even if he was in a state of cultivation where he had forgotten himself, he could still feel the changes.

The most direct observation was the crazy increase in power.

Song Qiming even felt that he could kill a cow with one punch.

Moreover, when he had practiced the ‘Qi – nourishing method’ in the past, the warm flow in his lower abdomen was actually true Qi. It was just that he didn’t know that the warm flow had now become several times stronger. When this warm flow ran through his meridians, he couldn’t help but feel his heart palpitate.

“RUO Fei, what ... What’s going on?” Song Qiming was dumbfounded.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Uncle song, how do you feel now? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?”

“I feel great, but ... What happened just now? Why do I have such great power?” Song Qiming asked in shock.

As he spoke, he grabbed a paperweight made of longevity mountain stone from the desk. He gripped it slightly, and immediately left several deep fingerprints on the paperweight.
