Chapter 502: Farm expansion (3)

“Hu Zi, I’ll have to trouble you to send my girlfriend back to the city,” Xia ruofei said with a faint smile.

Lei Hu had already noticed the beauty beside Xia ruofei and quickly said,””So it’s sister – in – Law! Hello, Sister – in – Law!”

“Hello,” he said. Ling Qingxue’s face was slightly red as she greeted Lei Hu.

Then, she whispered to Xia ruofei,””Ruofei, there’s no need to send me off. I’ll go back on my own,”

Xia ruofei chuckled.”The two cars here aren’t suitable for you to drive. That SUV is too big. Also, a beautiful woman like you can’t drive a pickup truck back to the company, can you?”

At this point, Xia ruofei could not help but laugh. The image of Ling Qingxue driving the pickup truck was simply too beautiful ...

“The company has been using this Mercedes – Benz a lot recently, so I’ll let Lei Hu send you there,” he continued.

Ling Qingxue stopped insisting and said to Lei Hu,””I’ll have to trouble you then ...”

“Hey! What’s the trouble?” Lei Hu chuckled and said,”it’s my honor to be your driver! Brother Xia, don’t worry! I’ll definitely send sister – in – Law there safely!”

Xia ruofei nodded and patted Lei Hu’s shoulder,””You’ve worked hard, Hu. ”

After sending Ling Qingxue to the car, Xia ruofei saw that it was almost time, so he drove the pickup truck to the small square in front of the mixed – use complex.

Feng Rao had already gone downstairs. When she saw Xia ruofei driving over in a pickup truck, she was stunned.

Xia ruofei smiled.”CEO Feng, I’ve asked Hu Zi to drive my girlfriend home. I’ll have to trouble you for a while.”

Feng Rao also came back to her senses. She smiled sweetly and said,””It’s rare for the chairman to be his personal driver. It doesn’t matter what car he’s driving!”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, Feng Jing couldn’t help but think,”It turned out that the chairman already had a girlfriend. It seemed that Qianqian had no chance ...

Then, she thought of Xia ruofei’s discontented tone when he picked up the phone. She could not help but guess,”Did I interrupt the chairman when he was doing it with his girlfriend? Otherwise, why would she be so resentful?

Feng Jing’s face turned red at the thought of this. She quickly discarded these messy thoughts from her mind and opened the door to the front passenger seat. It was definitely not appropriate for her to sit in the back seat. If she did, Xia ruofei would really become her chauffeur. She still had a sense of propriety.

Xia ruofei laughed and started the car. He left Taoyuan farm and drove straight to Dongkeng village.

The farm was in Dongkeng village, only a few kilometers away from the village council building. The car soon arrived at the village council building.

Ruan Fugui was already waiting in front of the building. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This time, the Deputy town mayor, Wu Gang, did not come, but ruan Fugui was even more enthusiastic than the last time. Before the car had even stopped, he had already come up to open the door for Xia ruofei.

“Boss Xia! Welcome, welcome!” Ruan Fugui said enthusiastically.

Xia ruofei smiled and shook ruan Fugui’s hand. He introduced,””Director ruan, let me introduce you. This is the General Manager of our paradise Corporation, Ms. Feng Jing.”

“President Feng, nice to meet you!” Ruan Fugui quickly greeted him.

In the face of such a delicate and beautiful young woman, ruan Fugui couldn’t help but reach out and rub his hands on his clothes a few times, hesitating if he should shake her hand.

Feng Rao, on the other hand, graciously reached out her hand and gently shook ruan Fugui’s hand. She smiled and said,””Director ruan, our company’s headquarters is in Dongkeng village. We’ll be in contact often in the future. Please take care of us, director ruan!”

“No, no, no!” Ruan Fugui quickly said,”you’re too kind, President Feng. We’re just looking out for each other and benefiting from each other!”

After the small talk, Xia ruofei said,””Director ruan, we’re here to talk about land leasing. Our paradise Corporation is currently expanding, and the existing land has already restricted the company’s development, so we want to continue expanding the farm to the north and south. We’ll need more support from our village for this!”

Ruan Fugui laughed and said,”boss Xia, you’re being too serious. You’re willing to rent those barren lands. This is a good thing for our village!” That ... Let’s not stand outside, let’s sit inside and talk! I’ve already asked my wife to prepare lunch. Let’s go to my house to eat later!”

“Hahaha! Then we won’t be polite!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I happen to have a few bottles of good wine in my car. Let’s have a few drinks in the afternoon!”

“Alright!” Ruan Fugui said happily,”boss Xia, CEO Feng, please come in!”
