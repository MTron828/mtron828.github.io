3105 Returning to the company (1)

Ling Qingxue asked curiously,””We’re going to visit uncle song?”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei tenderly and explained,””Didn’t ruofei grow wild tea? He wanted to give it to my father as soon as possible, but my father doesn’t know much about cultivation, so RUO Fei had to find a good reason to visit him. ”

Ling Qingxue suddenly understood and said,””Yes, yes, yes! This was what he should do! If it wasn’t for the inconvenience last time, she would have invited uncle song to drink wild tea together! Now that we’ve grown it ourselves, of course we can’t forget about uncle song!”

Ling Qingxue continued,”if that’s the case, then we’ll follow ruofei’s plan. You’ll come with me and drive my car home.” Ruofei and I will visit you again tonight!”

Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue and asked with a smile,””You really don’t have to ...”

Ling Qingxue blushed and interrupted Song Wei,””Aiya! It’s not the first day I’ve known him. We’re not that close! It’s decided!”

Xia ruofei also smiled and said,”let’s do this!” I’ll go to the company in the afternoon. Speaking of which, I haven’t been to the company in a long time. It’s a little unreasonable if I don’t go and take a look. ”

“That’s true!” Ling Qingxue said without hesitation,”if it wasn’t for Sister Feng Jing’s hard work, your company would have been destroyed!” I’ve never seen a boss as lazy as you!”

Ling Xiaotian had been in the food and beverage business for many years, starting from a small restaurant and growing into a large food and beverage group. Ling Qingxue had been influenced since she was a child. Her impression of her father was that he had always been busy and rarely had time to rest.

In Ling Qingxue’s eyes, a business life should be like her father ‘s.

Xia ruofei, on the other hand, was definitely a ‘non – mainstream’ type.

“You should go back to the company and take a look,” Song Wei said with a smile. Then it’s decided! Let’s go out together and do our own things. We’ll meet at my house tonight!”

Xia ruofei and the other two were chatting while eating lunch. It was almost two in the afternoon when they were done cleaning up the dishes.

Most companies had relatively short lunch breaks, so it was already time to go to the company.

So, the three of them went out together.

Xia ruofei was still driving the Knight XV SUV alone. At the entrance of the villa district, he waved goodbye to Song Wei and Ling Qingxue, who were also in the orange beetle, and drove to Taoyuan building.

Xia ruofei arrived at the peach blossom mansion and parked his car in the underground parking lot.

Originally, his elevator card had the right to directly enter the chairman’s office floor, but he didn’t want to see the company’s situation, so he took the stairs to the lobby on the first floor.

Just as Xia ruofei was about to walk in, the lady at the front desk called out to him.””Sir, may I know who you are looking for?”

Xia ruofei was stunned for a moment. He looked at the unfamiliar front desk of the company and couldn’t help but smile bitterly in his heart. He hadn’t been to the company for a long time. There were probably many new people in the company recently, but even the front desk didn’t recognize him.

Fortunately, Xia ruofei had the spirit map space, so his stuff was usually stored in the space and could be taken out at any time. He put his hand into his pocket and took out his work pass from the spirit map space. He handed it to the front desk and said with a smile, “I’m an employee of the company. This is my work card. ”

The receptionist was suspicious. As a receptionist, recognizing people was the most important task. This person had never been to the company, so how could he be a company employee?

She looked at the work card doubtfully and saw that the number on it was 001, and the position column wrote “Chairman.”

The receptionist was shocked. She rubbed her eyes and took a closer look at Xia ruofei.

Wasn’t this the big boss of the company? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Xia ruofei was quite popular on the internet. Although the new receptionist had never seen Xia ruofei before, she had seen many videos and photos of Xia ruofei on the internet. Especially after she joined paradise Corporation, she naturally knew the legendary boss of the company like thunder.

However, there were still some differences between her and the real person when she looked at photos and videos.

Furthermore, after Xia ruofei had broken through to the Golden core stage, although his appearance did not change much, his temperament was very different. More importantly, the receptionist would never have thought that the big boss of the company would be so low – Key. He walked into the company with his head lowered. Logically speaking, the big boss had finally come, so he should be surrounded by people!

Hence, she had no consciousness and could not recognize Xia ruofei.

After confirming that the person in front of her was really the company’s chairman, the lady at the front desk couldn’t help but shake her hand and almost lost her grip on the work card.

Then, she said in a trembling voice,””I’m sorry! Chairman, I ... I was careless and didn’t recognize you ...”

The young lady at the front desk was very afraid. She thought to herself,”with such a big mistake this time, I might lose my job!”

The benefits of paradise Corporation were quite good. Even for a basic position like the front desk of the company, the benefits were much higher than that of the front desk of other companies.

Xia ruofei smiled and took his work card.””What’s there to apologize for? You’re just carrying out your duties! And you’ve done a good job! You should be praised!”
