2318 Like a shadow (1)

The three Hornets flapped their wings and quickly caught up with the van.

There was only one driver in the van. He was a middle – aged man with a gloomy face. He was number 6, who the man in gray had just mentioned. He was in charge of receiving the man in gray at the inspection ground floor.

But just now, he heard his companion’s urgent call through his headphones,””No. 1 has been broken. No. 6, retreat quickly! Retreat quickly!”

No. 6 didn’t have time to think. He immediately started the car and drove away from the examination building, heading out of the hospital.

His expression was very ugly, and he kept thinking about how No. 1 had met with such an accident in such a short time that he didn’t even have time to escape.

No. 6 didn’t notice that three Hornets were chasing after him.

One of the Hornets landed on the roof of the van. It dropped a black object the size of a button battery, then flapped its wings and left the van, stopping on a tree by the side of the road.

When the black “button – up battery” came into contact with the roof of the car, it was immediately attached to it.

The other two hornet’s went in through the window’s gap and hid quietly in the back seat’s gap.

On the rooftop of the outpatient building.

Xia ruofei looked at the van that was almost at the hospital entrance, and his eyes turned cold. He muttered to himself,””This time, we’ll go straight to your base!”

After he finished speaking, he walked toward the door leading to the stairs on the rooftop.

The two battery – like things were tracking devices. They could track a distance of 30 kilometers in a straight line, and the high – Energy battery was enough to support the tracking device to continuously send out radio frequency signals for more than two hours.

This was the Hornet that Xia ruofei had raised in the medium to solve Lin Qiao’s problem. He felt that the Hornet was a good surprise weapon, so he got it from the black market through some special channels. It was quite good.

After living in the medium for such a long time, the hornet’s intelligence had improved a lot compared to when Lin Qiao had just finished her college entrance examination.

In order to prevent the target from changing cars halfway, Xia ruofei released three Hornets at once. One of them dropped a tracker while the other two hid in the car. Once the person in the car changed cars or changed to walking, the two Hornets would immediately follow. They also had a tracker.

Hence, Xia ruofei was not in a hurry.

After he walked into the stairs, he saw that there were no surveillance cameras, so he immediately changed his appearance and took out another set of clothes from the space. He quickly changed as he went downstairs.

After changing his clothes, Xia ruofei walked out of the stairwell and took the elevator to the first floor.

Then, he quickly walked to the parking lot of the hospital building, picked up his Knight XV SUV, and drove in the direction of the hospital entrance.

As Xia ruofei drove, he took out a large – Screen mobile phone from the medium. It was to be used together with the tracker.

After lighting up the screen, Xia ruofei opened the tracking device’s dedicated app. A map appeared on the screen. At the same time, there were three red dots on it. They were still moving.

The three red dots represented three trackers.

Now that the three red dots were together, it meant that the target was still in the car and had not abandoned it.

Xia ruofei placed his phone on the magnetic stand and drove after him.

As the Knight XV SUV was very eye – catching, there was only one in the entire Sanshan city. At the same time, he didn’t know if there were any other people watching the car near the hospital. Hence, Xia ruofei didn’t go in the direction of the van directly. Instead, he deliberately took another road.

Since the tracker’s signal range was about 30 kilometers, Xia ruofei was not worried about losing her.

As he drove in circles on the road, he kept an eye on the red dot on his phone screen, always keeping a distance of about five kilometers.

From today’s events, Xia ruofei felt that this group of people were very professional. At least, the man in gray, who he had met before, must have had blood on his hands. It was obvious that this was a very dangerous group of enemies.

The thought of a group of dangerous enemies hiding in the dark every day, ready to harm song Qiming’s family at any time, made Xia ruofei feel as if there was a thorn in his heart. He had to eliminate this hidden danger as soon as possible and find out the power behind this group of people. Otherwise, it was hard to guarantee that such a thing would not happen again in the future.

……

In a grey van, a middle – aged man with a gloomy face drove skillfully through the streets and alleys of Sanshan. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He was also constantly paying attention to his back.

This group of people were all tracking experts. If someone was following them, no matter how secretive the means were, it was basically difficult to escape their eyes.

The middle – aged man circled around twice, and his heart settled slightly. He could almost confirm that he was not being followed.

It seems like the person who dealt with No. 1 hasn’t caught up ... The middle – aged man thought to himself.

“Number 4! What’s the situation with No. 1?” The middle – aged man asked through the intercom.

Number 4’s serious voice came through his earpiece,””According to the image sent back by number one’s glasses, he immediately prepared to escape from the rooftop when he realized the danger. However, when he reached the rooftop, the enemy was already there. Number one tried to escape, but the enemy was obviously much faster than number one and blocked his way again. Then ... No. 1 should have directly activated the poison sac ...”

No. 4 was in charge of communication. He was in another car and could see the images sent back by everyone’s glasses in real time.

The glasses worn by the man in gray were actually quite advanced in technology. In addition to being able to take real – time photos like the Google Glasses and use the eye – tracking function for simple operations, they also had positioning and other functions. They could even project maps onto the glasses for navigation.

The middle – aged man’s expression changed drastically. He asked,””Number 4, Are you sure?”

“According to the analysis of the images sent back, the possibility is very high!” No. 4 said in a low voice,”the last image captured by the glasses was of the young man who blocked No. 1’s way. He obviously noticed that No. 1’s glasses were different from the rest. He said to the camera that he would catch us soon ... Then, No. 1’s glasses and his locator lost signal at the same time. I don’t know how he did it ...”

No. 4 did not know that the man in gray’s body and the pair of glasses had been sent into the spirit map space by Xia ruofei, which was completely isolated from the outside world.

The middle – aged man smacked the steering wheel hard and then clutched it tightly. His knuckles turned white and his face became very ferocious.

At this moment, number 4’s voice came from the earpiece again,””No. 6, once you’ve confirmed that there’s no tail, immediately gather at No. C’s hiding place. No. 1 has failed. We must come up with a new plan immediately. If necessary, we must immediately ask for instructions from the higher – ups!”

No. 1 was actually the person in charge of their team. He had always been in control of the overall situation. Now, it was equivalent to this team being in a state of no leader.

“Understood!” The middle – aged man, No. 6, panted heavily and said,”No. 4, save the footage that was recorded on No. 1 today!”

His voice was filled with killing intent because number 6 had another identity, and that was number 1’s older brother. He and number 1 were biological brothers.

The two of them had worked together on many missions and had gone through life and death together. They did not expect that a seemingly simple mission in China’s three mountains would lead to the death of number one. The middle – aged man, number six, could not accept this reality no matter what.

No. 4 said calmly,”No. 6, let’s come back first!” In our line of work, this day will come sooner or later. You can’t solve any problems by being hot – headed, so everything will be in accordance with the instructions from above!”

No. 4 was resourceful and was the wisest person in the team. Now that the team leader was dead, he had become the temporary core of the team.

“Got it. I’ll be there in ten minutes,” said the middle – aged man No. 6.

With that, he turned the steering wheel and drove West.

……

Xia ruofei followed the tracking device and kept a distance of ten kilometers from the gray van. He was very careful and did not approach it.

He also noticed that the gray van seemed to be going in circles, so he simply found a parking space by the side of the road and parked the car.

After a while, Xia ruofei, who had been staring at the screen, suddenly sat up straight. He was startled to see that the three red dots on the screen had stopped moving.

“Are you done going around in circles?” Xia ruofei mumbled to himself as he started the car.

At this time, he saw that one of the red dots stopped moving, and the other two red dots began to move slowly again, but the speed of movement was obviously much slower than before.

It was obvious that the other two hornet’s followed his instructions and were following him. The target should be walking, which was why they were so slow.

Xia ruofei stepped on the gas and drove the Knight XV in the direction of the red dot.

He parked the car about two kilometers away from where the gray van was parked, then got out and walked straight to it.

His pace did not seem fast, but his speed was not slow at all. It was comparable to the speed of an ordinary person’s jog.

As they walked, Xia ruofei picked up his phone from time to time.

At this time, the other two red dots had completely stopped moving. The target they were following had probably reached his hiding place.

Xia ruofei spent about ten minutes before he saw the grey van parked quietly by the side of the road.

The location of the red signal point was about 500 meters away.

When Xia ruofei passed by the grey van, he did not even look away. He just walked straight past it.

In fact, he had already scanned the van several times with his mental power and confirmed that there was no one in it.

According to the display on the phone screen, the red signal point was located in an ordinary residential area across the road.

Xia ruofei held his phone and walked into the district as if nothing had happened. He did not even look at the building where his target was hiding. Instead, he walked straight into a building with white tiles on the outer wall ...
