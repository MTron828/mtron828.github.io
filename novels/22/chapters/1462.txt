Chapter 1463: Chapter 860 – giving them a taste of their own medicine 3

Translator: 549690339

Liang Weimin was taken aback, but he quickly replied,”This is a real estate agency that our group has invested in. Our group accounts for about 15% of the shares. As for the right to speak ... It should be okay. Our group has two executive directors stationed there. Also, I have a good personal relationship with the General Manager of pioneer!”

At this point, Liang Weimin couldn’t help but ask curiously,”Ruofei, you didn’t call me just to ask about this, did you? Do you want to buy a second – hand house? This was not right! If you want to buy a house, you should look for me! We have two new buildings that are very good!”

Xia ruofei did not know whether to laugh or cry. Liang Weimin and Liang Qichao were indeed father and son! Their thought processes were so similar.

“Uncle Liang, I’m not thinking of buying a house ...” Xia ruofei explained and continued,”it’s just that two employees of pioneer real estate have terrible characters. If it’s convenient for you, can you help me give them a heads up and say hello?”

Liang Weimin’s heart skipped a beat when he heard that. He didn’t even ask Xia ruofei what had happened and just said,””RUO Fei, tell me their names and positions! I’ll give you a satisfactory explanation in ten minutes!”

Liang Weimin knew Xia ruofei very well. He knew that Xia ruofei was never an arrogant person. Today, Xia ruofei had called him overnight and said that the two employees had bad characters. This meant that the two blind employees of pioneer real estate must have made Xia ruofei angry. He was very angry.

Xia ruofei was the benefactor of Liang Weimin’s family. Not only did he help Liang Qichao a lot, but he was also very close to Tang He. He was a very important friend of Liang Weimin.

No matter what rank these two employees were, even if they were the top management of pioneer, Liang Weimin would stand on Xia ruofei’s side without hesitation. Even if the situation escalated to the point where jianda group withdrew its funds from pioneer, he would not even frown.

Xia ruofei turned to look at Guan Ping, covered the microphone and asked,””What are their positions?”

Bai Jingjing and store manager Liu’s faces turned pale, and they became more and more nervous.

“One of them is the manager of the jiangbin restaurant, and the other is the manager of the water shop!” Guan Ping answered without hesitation.

Xia ruofei nodded and said to Liang Weimin,”Uncle Liang, one of them is the manager of the jiangbin branch. The other one is the manager of the water shop, Bai Jing Jing. ”

“I’ll remember it. Ruofei, I’ll call you back later!”Liang Weimin said sternly.

When Liang Weimin heard the positions that Xia ruofei had announced – that they were just a store manager and a small manager – he didn’t have any hesitation at all.

Although the scale of pioneer real estate was not particularly large, it had at least a hundred stores in the province, which meant that there were at least one to two hundred store managers and reserve store managers. As for a supervisor like Bai Jingjing, the number was several times more.

To the whole company, people of this level were insignificant. Since they had made Xia ruofei angry, what else was there to say?

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”then I’ll have to trouble uncle Liang!” I hope we can teach them a lesson that will leave them with a deep impression ...”

At this point, Xia ruofei looked at Bai Jingjing and store manager Liu. He didn’t know why, but his calm gaze seemed to have a kind of attractive power that made the two of them not dare to look at him directly. Their hearts were in a mess, and a trace of regret began to grow.

Xia ruofei glanced at them and added,””By the way, they once threatened my brother that even if he left pioneer real estate, he would not be able to survive in the real estate agency industry in Sanshan. So ...”

Liang Weimin replied without thinking,”I understand!” It was not a big deal to ban the entire industry. RUO Fei, give me a few minutes, I will give you a satisfactory explanation!”

“Uncle Liang, thanks!” Xia ruofei said,”I’ll treat you to a drink later!”

“Hahaha! It’s a small matter!” Liang Weimin laughed heartily and said,”but I won’t be polite when I drink! Who asked you to have so much good wine in your house!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“There’s enough good wine, we won’t go back until we’re drunk!” Xia ruofei agreed with a smile.
