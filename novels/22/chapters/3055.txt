Actually, Xia ruofei had been paying attention to Li Yifu’s situation.

Li Yifu suddenly opened his eyes and spat out a mouthful of foul air.

His face revealed an inexplicable look of surprise and said,””Martial granduncle, disciple’s cultivation has broken through a level! I’ve already reached refined Qi Level 6!”

Then, Li Yifu noticed that Song Wei, Ling Qingxue, and even Tang Haoran were all looking at him with a smile.

Li Yifu also reacted at once. It must have been because of that cup of tea that he had involuntarily entered the state of cultivation. Xia ruofei had already prepared them mentally in advance. It was just that he had suddenly achieved a breakthrough in his cultivation and was so surprised that he had not regained his senses for a while.

“You guys ... Also broke through?” Li Yifu asked with uncertainty.

Song Wei and the rest nodded in unison.

Xia ruofei sighed to himself. Li Yifu was still at a disadvantage due to his age. Among the four of them, he had gained the least from drinking the wild tea. He had only broken through one level. For example, Tang Haoran had broken through two levels in a row. Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were also close to breaking through to refined Qi Level 6.

Of course, this was also related to the fact that their cultivation base was lower than Li Yifu ‘s. However, the main reason was that Li Yifu was a little old, and his potential was not as good as a young man’ s.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not expose him. He just smiled and said,””Foster husband, it’s a good thing that you’ve broken through. Remember to cultivate diligently during this period of time and consolidate your cultivation as soon as possible!”

“Yes! This disciple understands!” Li Yifu quickly said respectfully.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”okay, now that everyone is done with their cultivation, come and have some tea!” Although this tea was only effective when drunk for the first time, this wild tea was indeed a rare good tea, and one could make many potions of it! We can’t waste it!”

Li Yifu quickly went to boil the water again and urged them to cultivate for about an hour or two. The water that they had just boiled had already turned cold.

Everyone sat around the coffee table, drinking tea and chatting. Everyone’s cultivation had a breakthrough, so everyone was naturally in a good mood.

Xia ruofei did not continue explaining the fourth level of the “fierce yang Scripture” to Tang Haoran. He just smiled and chatted with everyone.

After drinking some tea, Xia ruofei said,””Alright, I should send Haoran home! Her foster husband continued to stay here. Wei Wei and Qingxue ... Are you going to wait for me on the peach source Island or are you coming with me?”

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue looked at each other, and as if their minds were connected, they said in unison,””Let’s go together!”

“We came out in a hurry this time,” Song Wei said with a smile,”after you send Haoran off, you can send us back!” Come again next time!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said after some thought.

Li Yifu immediately stood up and said,””Martial granduncle, then this disciple will take his leave first!”

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” You can stay here and cultivate!”

From the beginning to the end, Xia ruofei did not mention anything about the Peach Blossom Island. Even when he was making wild tea for everyone, he did it on the flying boat. In fact, he did not want Tang Haoran to come into contact with information about the Peach Blossom Island too early.

After all, Tang Haoran was still a child. If he accidentally let it slip, it might spread to the ears of people with ulterior motives, which would bring a lot of trouble to Peach Blossom Island.

All the people on the airboat were Li Yifu’s elders. He bowed and bade farewell to them respectfully before he left the airboat.

Xia ruofei started the airboat again and flew towards Sydney, Australia.

Along the way, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue continued to look at the scenery on the deck. In reality, it was already night time and there was not much scenery to see. They were trying to create a quiet environment for Xia ruofei and Tang Haoran.

This was because Xia ruofei had used the time on the road to explain the fourth level of the “fierce yang Scripture” to Tang Haoran.

Tang Haoran’s cultivation talent was indeed very good. He was also very interested in the cultivation method that was very obscure to most people. More than an hour passed by in a flash.

After Xia ruofei finished, Tang Haoran still wanted to continue. However, the airboat had already arrived above Sydney and was not far from the Tang family’s Manor. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“The fourth layer cultivation method is so profound, master!” Tang Haoran said. If there’s anything I don’t understand, can I call you to ask?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”of course, no problem!” If you have any questions, you must ask me in time. Don’t blindly think about it. Cultivation is not a small matter. If you make a mistake, it may bring very serious consequences. ”

“I know. Don’t worry, master!” Tang Haoran quickly said. I definitely won’t mess around!”

Xia ruofei continued,”today, we’re talking about some things related to the world of cultivation, including master’s flying boat. You have to keep it a secret, okay?” It was best not to tell his parents. After all, they were just ordinary people. It was not good for them to know too much about the cultivation world. Of course, I don’t think they would ask so much. ”

Xia ruofei knew Tang Yitian and Jennifer well. The couple trusted Xia ruofei very much and would never ask what they shouldn’t ask.

“Mm! I’ll remember that!” Tang Haoran’s small face had an extremely serious expression.”Master, don’t worry. I promise I won’t tell anyone!”

Xia ruofei patted Tang Haoran’s head and said,””Mm! Alright, we’re almost at your house. Let’s prepare to land!”
