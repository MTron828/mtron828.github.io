Chapter 1578: Getting rich in silence (3)

Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei looked at the happy song Wei and smiled bitterly.””Didn’t I ask you to fill in 100000?”

Song Wei was a little embarrassed and said,”I went over to take a look. The starting price of that raw stone is already 90000 Yuan. I’m just worried that 100000 Yuan isn’t enough. That’s why I added 20000 more!”

Xia ruofei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. If he was right, there should only be one bid form for this raw stone in the bidding box. In theory, she could win the bid even if she wrote 90000 Yuan.

Xia ruofei was already kind enough to ask Song Wei to round it up to 100000 Yuan.

She didn’t expect this silly girl to add another 20000 on her own accord. Wasn’t this a waste of money?

However, seeing how happy song Wei was, Xia ruofei did not have the heart to scold her. He just smiled and said,””It’s good that it hit! I wish you a great rise in your raw gemstone!”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Song Wei smiled and asked,”by the way, when are we going to get the raw stones? Can I untie it on the spot?”

“There’s no hurry. Let’s wait for the results to be out! I still want to pay attention to the raw stones that I’ve invested in!” Xia ruofei said,”President Yu and the rest are waiting too. If you want to cut the stone later, you can all ...”

“Alright then!” Song Wei said.

The information on the big screen refreshed quickly. By three in the afternoon, all the bidding results for the raw gemstones were out.

Unsurprisingly, Xia ruofei won all five of them. Of course, he had told Yu mingdong and Song Wei that he had bet more than ten dollars. Otherwise, this 100% winning rate would be too scary.

As expected by Xia ruofei, the highest bidder was the raw stone with a starting price of more than 40 million. In the end, it reached a terrifying price of more than 70 million, almost double the price.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but secretly shake his head. He felt lucky that he didn’t join in the fun. Otherwise, even if he could make a little profit from the auction, he wouldn’t be able to earn much.

How could this be compared to investing in a raw stone worth more than six million Yuan and increasing the price by seven to eight times or even more than ten times in the blink of an eye?

At the end of the bidding, Xia ruofei met someone familiar. It was the unlucky hero Luo who took over the bidding yesterday.

When fatty Luo saw Xia ruofei, he was no longer as sarcastic as he was yesterday. He was still very polite and warm.

After the two of them exchanged the results, Xia ruofei realized that fatty Luo’s luck was not bad. He had put all his eggs in one basket and finally won the raw stone No. 823 for a little more than 10 million.

This raw stone was one of the dozens that Xia ruofei had paid attention to at first. He had sensed it with the spirit painting scroll and fatty Luo had bought it at this price. If nothing went wrong, he should be able to make a lot of money.

Even if he couldn’t make up for yesterday’s losses completely, he could at least make up for a part of it. With this raw stone, his jade factory should not be short of high – end Jade materials in the short term.

Just as Xia ruofei was chatting with fatty Luo, Yu mingdong walked over.

“Mr. Xia, how’s your battle record?” Yu mingdong asked with a smile.

Xia ruofei smiled.”Director Yu, you look so happy. It seems like you’ve gained a lot today!”

“Hahaha! Luck! Luck!” Yu mingdong said happily,”I won a few pieces. I don’t know if I can earn it ...”

“I also won five pieces. I spent a total of more than 20 million Yuan!” Xia ruofei said casually.

“Mr. Xia is really generous!” Yu mingdong sighed.

Although he knew that Xia ruofei did not know much about stone gambling, he did not dare to look down on Xia ruofei anymore. Luck was something that could not be explained clearly. Xia ruofei’s brilliant record yesterday had already explained everything.

Yu mingdong asked with some eagerness,””How about it, Mr. Xia, are we still cutting stones together today?”

Xia ruofei pondered for a moment and said,”I won’t be taking out my raw stones for the time being. I’ll watch you cut the stones today!” By the way, Song Wei also bought a small raw stone to play with. Let’s take your car to cut it later!”

Chapter 1579: Four times the original price (1)

“No problem!” Yu mingdong said straightforwardly,”let’s go. We’ll claim the winning BID’s raw stone first!”

The group walked towards the counter. Xia ruofei and Song Wei walked side by side and smiled.””Did you bring your card? Do you need me to help you?”

“I can still afford 120000 Yuan,” Song Wei grinned and said,”I don’t need you to pay for it!” If we make a fortune from this, it’ll be hard to explain!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re still saying that you don’t have money? you took out 120000 Yuan without even blinking an eye. You’re a little rich woman too!”

“I’ve been saving this money for many years,”Song Wei said coyly. If I really lose everything, you’ll have to compensate me!”

“Pei Pei Pei! They hadn’t even cut the stone yet! “You’re just saying unlucky things ...”Xia ruofei said.

“I’m just preparing for a rainy day! Rich people are all stingier than the next. Who knows if you will go back on your word?” Song Wei chuckled and said.

Very quickly, the group of people arrived at the service desk. Yu mingdong went to handle the delivery procedures, while Xia ruofei and Song Wei went to the adjacent seats and showed the staff the second couplet of the bidding slip.

Song Wei’s raw stone was very small. Not long after she swiped her card, a staff member brought the raw stone to the service desk.

After confirming that there were no mistakes, the transaction was completed.

Then, the two of them went to meet up with Yu mingdong. Yu mingdong was busy swiping his card and paying. He was a little surprised to see Xia ruofei. “You’re done so quickly?”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s just a small piece of raw material. We’ll hand over the money and the goods at the same time!”

“Mr. Xia, where are your raw stones?” Yu mingdong asked in surprise.

“Oh, I’m not in a hurry.” Xia ruofei said,”let’s watch you guys cut the stone first!”

Xia ruofei did not plan to cut the raw stones on the spot. These five raw stones were definitely going to increase in value. If they were cut out on the spot, it would be too shocking. It would also inevitably cause people to suspect that no matter how lucky Qianqian was, it could not be so good.

In essence, stone gambling was a probability event, and the huge increase was definitely a small probability event.

When the probability of a small probability event happening became 100%, it was definitely abnormal.

Xia ruofei didn’t want to attract the attention of people with ulterior motives, let alone become the focus of everyone’s attention.

Yu mingdong said with some regret,”I still wanted to cut your raw stone first, and then try my luck!”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”President Yu, you’re being superstitious!” I can’t accept this!”

After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, even the female staff who was handling the raw stone delivery procedures for Yu mingdong could not help but smile.

How many of the people who came to the public Jade bid were not superstitious? Looking at the Almanac before leaving the house, wearing one or two accessories that could increase one’s luck ... These were all very common. Some people even had strange habits that outsiders would think of, but they were also thinking about it from the perspective of Feng Shui metaphysics.

“Mr. Xia,” Yu mingdong said with a smile,”that’s a bit of a big hat!”

“Hahaha! Don’t worry, President Yu, I believe your luck won’t be too bad!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“Then I’ll really be counting on your blessings.” Yu mingdong said with great joy, as if it had really gone up.

While they were chatting, Yu mingdong’s raw stones had been delivered.

Two of the raw stones were relatively large, and they were directly transported over with a forklift.

When the staff learned that Yu mingdong was preparing to cut the stone on the spot, they immediately arranged a forklift to send the raw stone directly to the next door.

Xia ruofei and the rest followed the forklift out of the public Jade bid.

Song Wei held the raw stone that cost 120000 Yuan in her hands and followed Xia ruofei excitedly.

Shi Lei had already found an empty spot to cut the stones. Xia ruofei went over and was overjoyed. It was the same stone – cutting master from the day before.

Yu mingdong couldn’t help but say happily,””Hahaha! Master, we are really fated!”

The stonecutter had been cutting stones for many people in the past few days, but he still had a deep impression of Xia ruofei and the others. It was not just because the raw stones had increased in value after they were cut, but more importantly, the process of cutting stones that day was full of ups and downs and was full of drama.

Therefore, the stonecutter also grinned,””Bosses, I wish you all the best in advance!”

The day before yesterday, he had received a red packet of 20000 Yuan, which was much more than what he usually earned by working.

“Haha, I’m counting on your blessings, counting on your blessings ...” Yu mingdong said.

Then, he politely said to Song Wei,””Miss song, why don’t ... You go first with this one?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Song Wei was a little nervous. She looked at Xia ruofei and gave him a questioning look.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”don’t look at me!” It’s up to you. It’s all the same no matter when you open it. ”

In any case, this raw stone would definitely rise in price. It was actually not bad to open it first. It was equivalent to a good start, and it could also be considered as a good start for Yu mingdong.

It didn’t matter if he opened it later. Xia ruofei also took a look at Yu mingdong’s raw stones. He still had an impression of at least four or five of them, which meant that the Jade inside should be good.

Therefore, even if the other pieces might be cut down, in general, Yu mingdong could at least maintain a zero – profit and no – loss situation.

For a Jade boss, it was already a good result to be able to buy good Jade at a cost price. After all, it was rare to see a situation where he made tens of millions of Yuan like the day before yesterday.
