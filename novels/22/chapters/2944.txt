2945 Arriving at the double celebration -

When Xia ruofei heard the receptionist Hong Chunlei mention the fallen leaves sect, he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

Speaking of which, the first person he came into contact with in Huaxia’s cultivation world was Liu chengfeng of the fallen leaves sect. He was later controlled by him with a soul seal and became his first soul slave.

The mountain Gate of the fallen leaves sect was near Shuangqing city. Xia ruofei had heard from Luo Qingfeng that the auction in Huaxia’s cultivation world was hosted by all the major sects in turns. This year, it was the fallen leaves sect’s turn.

Xia ruofei thought to himself,”I wonder if I’ll be able to see Liu chengfeng this time.”

Luo Qingfeng nodded with a reserved expression and said,””So it’s martial nephew Hong, thank you for your hard work!”

When Hong Chunlei appeared, Xia ruofei and Luo Qingfeng looked at him at the same time. They both found that Hong Chunlei’s cultivation was only at refined Qi Level 4.

Of course, this was not surprising.

Generally, the disciples who were exposed to the public to deal with these External Affairs of the sect would not have a high cultivation and talent. Hong Chunlei, who was nearly 40 years old, had only reached the fourth level of the Qi refining realm, so he must be in the same situation.

Of course, although Hong Chunlei’s status in the fallen leaves sect was not very high, he was the person in charge of the reception of the fallen leaves sect’s auction.

After all, Qingfeng Luo was the sect leader of the star Seizer sect and an Aurous core stage cultivator. He was considered an important guest.

In today’s cultivation world in China, the top cultivators were basically at the Golden core stage. Even the nascent soul old monsters were legendary existences. There were all kinds of rumors that some sects had hidden Yuanying elders, but no one had ever seen them in the past few decades.

But then again, Luo Qingfeng’s status only made the falling leaves sect pay more attention to him. If he was really an important guest, the higher – ups of the falling leaves sect would have come to welcome him personally.

After all, Luo Qingfeng’s cultivation level was only at the early – Stage golden core realm. The star Seizer sect’s strength was only in the middle of the sects in Huaxia.

Some of the sect leaders of the large sects had already reached the late – Stage of the Golden core realm.

Some sects even had many golden core cultivators.

Such sects were the top sects in the cultivation world of Huaxia.

It was only because of Luo Qingfeng that the star Seizer sect had barely reached the standard of a first – Class sect. To be called a first – Class sect, one needed at least one Aurous core stage cultivator.

Facing a golden core cultivator like Luo Qingfeng, Hong Chunlei was under a lot of pressure. Although Luo Qingfeng was kind, he still felt breathless.

After hearing Luo Qingfeng’s words, Hong Chunlei quickly said,””Martial uncle Luo is too serious! This was a disciple’s duty! Martial uncle Luo, the car is ready. Please follow me!”

After that, Hong Chunlei quickly led the way, leading Xia ruofei and the other two to the parking lot of Jiangbei Airport.

The car used by the fallen leaves sect to receive their guests was a Toyota Elfa commercial car. It was the most comfortable car among its class. Xia ruofei also had one, which he usually used in the capital.

The electric car door of Alphard opened slowly.

Li Yifu was the first to get into the car and took the initiative to sit in the third row.

This made Hong Chunlei slightly surprised. When he saw Luo Qingfeng and the other two, he instinctively felt that the White – haired Li Yifu should at least be a senior brother of Luo Qingfeng’s generation, and the young – looking Xia ruofei was obviously a junior disciple who had come out with his seniors to broaden their horizons.

Li Yifu’s action was really out of Hong Chunlei’s expectation. It seemed that Li Yifu’s position was the lowest among the three!

In fact, Hong Chunlei did not notice that after Li Yifu got in the car, Luo Qingfeng wanted to politely ask Xia ruofei to get in first and sit behind the driver, but he was stopped by Xia ruofei’s look.

Hong Chunlei’s eyes would pop out of their sockets if he saw this.

Although there were no clear rules, according to the conventional rules, when taking this kind of three – row business car, the most important guest would definitely sit in the middle row behind the driver. In theory, this seat was the safest.

On the way here, Xia ruofei had already spoken to Luo Qingfeng and Li Yifu,”In front of outsiders, the three of them should be considered as senior and junior brothers. Li Yifu was the oldest, so he was definitely the senior brother. However, his cultivation talent was relatively poor, so his status in the sect was not that high. As the sect leader, Luo Qingfeng naturally had the highest status, so he was the leader of the three of them. Xia ruofei was considered a young genius and Luo Qingfeng’s junior Brother.

Luo Qingfeng followed Xia ruofei’s instructions uneasily and sat behind the driver before Xia ruofei got into the car.

Hong Chunlei naturally sat in the co-pilot’s seat, and then ordered the driver to drive.

The terrain of the mountain City was indeed uneven. The car went up Hills and over ridges, sometimes circling downhill, and sometimes driving on an elevated road that was ten to twenty meters high. After about half an hour, they finally arrived at the junjue hotel located in Yuzhong Peninsula.

Xia ruofei originally thought that this kind of auction in the cultivation world would be held in some spiritual mountain or blessed land. At the very least, it would be held in a resort villa with beautiful scenery in the suburbs. He did not expect that the fallen leaves sect would choose a five – Star hotel in the downtown area.

Hong Chunlei seemed to have seen through Xia ruofei’s doubts. He explained respectfully,””Seniors, the junjue hotel is a property of our Fallen Leaf sect. This time, we’ve already closed the auction a month in advance and reserved rooms for the public, so the entire hotel will be used to serve the auction. The food and living conditions of the seniors will definitely be taken care of!”

At first, Hong Chunlei thought that Xia ruofei was also a disciple of a follower. However, he saw that Xia ruofei’s status was even higher than that of the White – haired old man in the back row. How could he dare to neglect him? Therefore, he simply referred to the three of them as “seniors.”

The least important thing in the world of cultivation was age. Those with high cultivation and seniority were seniors. He was in his forties, so he could not call Xia ruofei, who was in his twenties,”senior”. Even if he was a ten – year – old child, if the other party was of higher seniority, he would still call him “master”!

Xia ruofei was not used to it at first. However, he had been “trained” by Li Yifu to become a white – haired old man who respectfully called him senior granduncle all day long. After a long time, he naturally became used to the disposition of seniority.

Xia ruofei nodded with a smile and said,””Your sect is really generous! I think this hotel has at least a thousand rooms! We’ll suffer quite a loss if we close the business for a few days!”

Although the junjue hotel wasn’t a large – scale hotel chain in the world, as a business of the fallen leaves sect in the secular world, its standards were quite high. First of all, it was definitely a five – Star standard. In addition, the hotel had more than fifty floors, and a rough estimate was that there were at least a thousand rooms. In addition to some auxiliary buildings, it could be said that this hotel had everything. Whether it was a five – Star hotel standard such as a swimming pool and a gym, or a high – end restaurant, KTV, sauna, and other places, as long as the customers wanted it, it basically had everything.

“You must be joking, senior,” Hong Chunlei quickly said.”Compared to serving you well, what’s the loss of some secular money?”

Cultivators didn’t care much about money. After all, some precious cultivation resources couldn’t be bought with money. Cultivators were generally not interested in the enjoyment that could be bought with money. They valued the improvement of their own cultivation more. Not to mention, there were some cultivators who walked the path of ascetic cultivation. They would spend their entire lives in rags and suffer for joy. They did not need any enjoyment at all.

While they were talking, the Toyota Elfa business car had arrived at the hotel’s revolving door and slowly stopped.

A spirited white – haired old man was already waiting at the entrance of the hotel.

Before the car stopped, Hong Chunlei quickly opened the door of the front passenger seat and jumped out of the car. Then he respectfully bowed to the White – haired old man and stood aside.

The electric car door of the Toyota Elfa opened slowly, and the three of them got out of the car.

When Luo Qingfeng got out of the car, the White – haired old man took a few steps forward and said with a hearty smile,””Daoist Luo, you’ve had a hard journey!”

Although Luo Qingfeng was not used to Xia ruofei falling behind him by half a body, he managed to overcome this unnaturalness. He smiled and said,””So it’s fellow Daoist Qing Song. How have you been?”

Luo Qingfeng was afraid that Xia ruofei would be left out. After greeting the White – haired elder, he immediately turned to Xia ruofei and said,””Junior martial brother, let me introduce you. This is the elder of the fallen leaf sect, fellow Daoist Hao Qingsong!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xia ruofei almost laughed out loud when he heard this. The person in front of him had the air of a Sage and gave off the feeling of a Daoist master. He didn’t expect his name to be so funny and amusing. Hao Qingsong was so relaxed ... Could it be that with such a name, it would be easier for him to cultivate?

Of course, Xia ruofei would not be so heartless as to reveal a funny expression. At most, he was secretly happy in his heart.

Xia ruofei smiled and took a step forward.””So it’s elder Hao, nice to meet you!”

Hao Qingsong’s gaze fell on Xia ruofei, and he couldn’t help but raise his brows. He was just like Hong Chunlei, thinking that Xia ruofei was a junior that Luo Qingfeng had brought out to broaden his horizons. It was only when he heard Luo Qingfeng call Xia ruofei “Junior Brother” that he noticed the young man in front of him. Almost subconsciously, he used his spiritual power to investigate, and the result shocked him.

In fact, in the world of cultivation, it was very impolite to use one’s spiritual power to investigate others.

However, if it was an elder checking on a Junior’s cultivation, it was nothing.

...

Hao Qingsong was one of the two golden core cultivators of the falling leaves sect. The other was naturally the sect master.

With his status, even if Xia ruofei was Luo Qingfeng’s junior Brother, it was not impolite for Hao Qingsong to check on the other party’s cultivation.

However, when Hao Qing subconsciously checked, he realized that he could not see Xia ruofei’s cultivation level!
