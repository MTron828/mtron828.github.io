3163 The horse doesn’t stop_Song Wei’s face turned even redder. She lowered her eyes and said,”What kind of nonsense are you thinking about? How could we be so ridiculous ...”

“Of course you won ‘t, but I can’t be sure about this guy.” Song Wei looked at Xia ruofei, who was still “sleeping” and said with a smile. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“No,” Song Wei replied shyly. Don’t let your thoughts run wild. He was so tired last night that he fell asleep as soon as he lay down ...”

“Oh, oh ...” Ling Qingxue was a little disappointed.”I thought something exciting was going to happen!”

“Let’s not talk here,”Song Wei quickly said,” we don’t want to wake him up!” Get up first! Be gentler ...”

“I know!” Ling Qingxue pouted and said,”you’re so good to this guy ...”

Even though Ling Qingxue said that, when she really got out of bed, she was still very light.

The two of them got off the bed carefully. They did not make any noise or cause any vibration. This made Xia ruofei, who had been pretending to be asleep, feel moved.

Of course, he couldn’t “wake up” right now. Since he was pretending to be asleep, he had to do it properly. Otherwise, if Song Wei and Ling Qingxue saw through him, it would be hard to say what the two of them would do in their embarrassment and anger!

Hence, Xia ruofei decided to wait for the two of them to wash up. When they were almost done, he stretched lazily and pretended to have just woken up. He rubbed his drowsy eyes and leaned against the door frame of the bathroom. He asked in a sleepy tone,””You guys are up so early?”

When Song Wei heard the voice, she turned around and asked,””Ruofei, did we wake you up because we were too loud when we washed our faces?”

Xia ruofei yawned and said,””It’s getting late, I should get up!”

Ling Qingxue wiped her face with a towel and said casually,””Since you’re awake, let’s get ready for breakfast! They should be here by now!”

Xia ruofei knew that Mu Sheng and the others didn’t like to join in the fun, especially when the restaurant at the club was filled with ordinary people from the secular world. So, he had asked Zhao Yongjun to arrange for someone to send breakfast over early in the morning.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”yes!” I’ll go out after I wash my face. You guys should get ready!”

In fact, they didn’t have much to prepare. Both of them had storage rings, so they had brought a complete set of face wash, skin care products, and some of their favorite clothes with them. After washing up, they just packed their things and changed into a new set of clothes.

“Okay, give us a few more minutes. It’ll be ready soon!” Song Wei said.

Very quickly, Song Wei and Ling Qingxue had finished packing their things and left the bathroom. It was Xia ruofei’s turn to wash.

Then, the three of them left the room together and went to the villa’s restaurant on the first floor for breakfast.

Everyone tacitly kept quiet about the three of them sharing the same bed last night. However, Xia ruofei could feel that the atmosphere between the three of them had gradually changed.

This was good news for Xia ruofei.

He couldn’t wait for such things to happen a few more times. Even if he couldn’t really sleep with them in the future, at least he wouldn’t always feel like he was walking on thin ice when he was with his two confidants!

During breakfast, Xia ruofei asked for the opinions of Mu Sheng and the others. He asked if they would like to stay at the Paradise clubhouse or go to the siheyuan.

According to the plan, they might have to stay in Beijing for a few more days.

After all, the library here had all kinds of materials and journals, and the resources were more abundant. Moreover, Wang Chi and other expert professors were all in Beijing, so the algorithm writing work was completed in Beijing. If there were any problems, it would be more convenient to look for information or consult experts.

Originally, Xia ruofei thought that Mu Sheng and the others would choose to stay in the peach Garden Club.

After all, this place was closer to the environment of a cultivation sect. Basically, if one stayed in the villa above the array eye, they could cultivate 24 hours a day. However, the concentration of spirit Qi was still a distance away from those top sects.

On the other hand, the courtyard house was quiet, but the cultivation environment was not as good.

He didn’t expect that Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha would choose to return to the siheyuan at the same time.

According to them, the environment of the courtyard house was more to their liking, and they were not used to living in such a modern villa.

As for cultivation, since he was only staying for a short time, he could just use spiritual crystals to cultivate for two to four hours a day.

Xia ruofei naturally respected Mu Sheng and the others ‘opinions. Besides, if they lived in a courtyard house, it was closer and more convenient to go to the National Library or Capital University.

Hence, Xia ruofei contacted Zhao Yongjun and asked him to arrange for two commercial cars, as well as his Elfa. The three cars left Taoyuan clubhouse and returned to the liuhai Lane courtyard in the city.

Xia ruofei prepared to go to the library. His main purpose was to search for more information on the ancient language. He had brought a portable hard disk. As long as there was an electronic version of the information, he was prepared to copy it to improve the database.

Large libraries also provided copies of electronic documents, but they had to pay a certain fee.

Xia ruofei naturally did not care about the cost. Besides, it was only natural for him to pay for knowledge.

Chen Xuan wanted to continue working on the code for the Paradise Mall project, so Xia ruofei asked him to stay in the courtyard house. He then brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue to the National Library.

For the past few days, he had brought Song Wei and Ling Qingxue with him wherever he went, mainly for safety reasons.

After all, it was impossible for him to trust Mu Sheng, Liu Mansha, and the others without any reservations. Now that everyone knew that Song Wei and Ling Qingxue were his Dao partners, these two girls, in a sense, were his weak spot.

If he really had ulterior motives, even Chen Xuan could easily subdue Song Wei and Ling Qingxue by himself, let alone intermediate golden core cultivators like Mu Sheng and Liu Mansha.

Even though it was a rare occurrence, Xia ruofei would never allow any accidents to happen. When it came to the safety of the people around him, he could never be too careful.

Song Wei and Ling Qingxue did not feel bored at all. Xia ruofei usually did not spend much time with them, but during this period, they were almost always together. Even if they had to spend the whole day in the library with Xia ruofei, they were still happy to do so.

Xia ruofei stayed in the National Library for an entire day. He made a copy of a large number of ancient texts, focusing on the documents from the pre – Qin period. After all, he already knew that the rising Dragon Order had already appeared in the ancient cultivation world. Thus, the texts from that era were naturally more valuable for reference.

After returning to the courtyard house from the library, Xia ruofei started to work through the night.

The structure of the algorithm was already very clear. All that was left was to fill in the code.

Therefore, his focus was on the comparison database, which was also very important. It could provide a reference standard for the computer, so that the computer could arrange the most likely correct combination of answers according to rationality.

Today, Xia ruofei had really stayed up all night. He was almost non – stop working in front of the computer.

He didn’t stop even after dawn. After a simple breakfast, he immediately went back to work.

If he was not a cultivator but an ordinary person, he would have died easily after a few days of such intense work. Chen Xuan was also a little upset. He temporarily put aside his work at paradise Corporation and came to help Xia ruofei.
