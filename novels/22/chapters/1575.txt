Chapter 1576: Getting rich in silence (1)

“Song Wei, this list is for you.” Xia ruofei smiled as he handed over a blank bidding form and said,”go and place your bid for raw stone No. 572. It’s the smaller one in the corner over there. As for the price ... I think it should be 100000 Yuan. ”

“So little?” Song Wei said in surprise.

“You’ll know when you see that raw stone. ” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”you have to trust my intuition. Just bet on that piece and do as I say.”

In fact, Xia ruofei had already used his spiritual power to sense it. No one was interested in the raw stone. If he did not let Song Wei bid, it would have become one of the few raw stones that were not bid.

Song Wei took the bidding slip and walked in the direction that Xia ruofei pointed at.

Xia ruofei could only give her so much advice. After he passed the bidding slip to Song Wei, he did not care anymore. He seized the time to bid for the five raw stones. One or two of them were quite popular and it was not long before the deadline for the bidding.

Xia ruofei quickly filled in the bidding form and placed the stones into the bidding boxes corresponding to the five raw stones.

Then, he paid close attention to the five raw gemstones and stood near the two raw gemstones that were relatively popular.

If there were still people bidding in the last few minutes and the bid price was higher than Xia ruofei ‘s, he would have to raise the bid again. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In fact, as long as Xia ruofei had his eyes on a raw stone, others would not stand a chance.

After all, to others, this was a hidden bid. To Xia ruofei, everything was transparent. The bidding price of others was no secret to him. He was basically in an undefeatable position.

As time passed by, everyone was nervously watching the situation in the arena, especially since they had placed their bid on the raw gemstone. Once someone got close, they couldn’t help but feel nervous.

Finally, it was 12 o’ clock sharp. Music started playing in the venue, and the organizer officially announced the end of the bidding.

Xia ruofei finally heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the staff start to seal the bidding box.

In the last few minutes, there were people who went to bid for the raw stones that he had his eyes on. Fortunately, the prices they bid were lower than the prices he wrote, so they won the bid this time.

Song Wei quickly returned to Xia ruofei’s side. She asked nervously,”Ruofei, when will the results be out?”

“Normally, they’ll be announced in an hour or two. Let’s go out for lunch first.” Xia ruofei chuckled and then teased,”you only threw in an unremarkable raw stone. What’s there to be nervous about?”

Song Wei glared at Xia ruofei and said,”How can I be compared to you, a big tycoon?”

Then, she asked,””Such a small stone, and the starting price is 90000 ... RUO Fei, do you think I’ll make a loss if I really win?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”what are you afraid of?” Aren’t the losses on me?”

“You’re right!” Song Wei could not help but laugh.”Let’s go find a place to eat!”

“Mm, call President Yu and the others!” Xia ruofei said.

......

Near jadeite Street, Xia ruofei and the others found a restaurant that looked good and asked for a private room.

“Mr. Xia, let’s not drink for lunch. Let’s have some simple food!” Yu mingdong took the menu and said to Xia ruofei,”after all, I have work to do in the afternoon!”

“I agree!” Xia ruofei said,”just a simple meal will do. I also want to go back to the public Jade bid as soon as possible!”

Yu mingdong quickly ordered a few dishes and politely passed the menu to Xia ruofei and Song Wei. However, the two of them didn’t really care about what to eat and didn’t add any more dishes. They just asked the waiter to urge the kitchen to quickly serve the dishes.

“Mr. Xia, did you make a move today?” Yu mingdong asked.

“I randomly threw in a dozen pieces based on my gut feeling. However, I might not be able to win.” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”where’s President Yu? Do you have any good raw gemstones?”

Now that the bidding had ended, everyone could naturally talk about this topic.

Yu mingdong smiled and said,”I also invested about ten Yuan!” Cast a wide net! I wonder how many I’ll get ...”

“Be careful, you won’t be able to pay if you win all of them!” Xia ruofei joked.

Yu mingdong laughed.”If there’s really such a good thing, I’ll get the money even if I have to sell everything I have to borrow from usury!”

“President Yu, isn’t there a nouveau riche here?” Song Wei pursed her lips and smiled. If you don’t have enough money, you can borrow from him!”

“No problem! As long as you pay me the interest, it’s fine!” Xia ruofei said jokingly.

“Hahaha! If I really borrow from Mr. Xia, I’ll definitely give you enough interest!” Yu mingdong also laughed and said.

After a simple lunch, the group returned to the public auction on jadeite Street.

The site was closed for work, and the people who participated in the public bid gathered outside and chatted.

When it was almost oneo’ clock, the door to the public Jade bid opened. Everyone walked in. Xia ruofei and Song Wei were among the crowd.

Just like the last time, the public Jade bid was divided into two parts, separated by a barrier.

At the back was a place for raw stones and bidding data, while at the front was a long service Desk.
