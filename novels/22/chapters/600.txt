Chapter 601: Inviting the tea King out of the mountain (2)

“Hello, uncle bull!” Xia ruofei greeted him with a smile.

Niu Yusheng was surprised and overjoyed. He stood up to welcome her and said,””Mr. Xia, why have you come personally this time?”

Xia ruofei had a gentle smile on his face as he said,”Old Mr. Li has been taking the medicine for some time, so I came to see his physical condition. Uncle bull, is old Mr. Li at home?”

“He brought little ye to the tea garden early in the morning. Mr. Xia, quickly come in and take a seat ...” Niu Yusheng said.

After he finished speaking, Niu Yusheng turned around and shouted,””Guizhi, come down. Mr. Xia is here ...”

The sound of footsteps could be heard. Li Guizhi quickly came down from upstairs. She was naturally surprised and happy to see Xia ruofei. She quickly brought a chair for Xia ruofei and exchanged pleasantries again.

Xia ruofei took the hot tea that Li Guizhi made for him and asked with a smile,””How’s old Mr. Li’s health recently?”

“Mr. Xia, the Chinese medicine you prescribed is very effective!” Li Guizhi said gratefully. My dad’s health is getting better day by day. I feel that he’s even stronger than before he fell sick!”

Niu Yusheng also chuckled and said,”isn’t that so!” It had been a few years since the old man had gone to the tea garden, and the roads there were not easy to walk on. Recently, he took Xiao Ye there every three to five days. Guizhi and I were worried, so we went with him two times. The old man was so fast!”

Li Guizhi nodded and said,”Mr. Xia, it’s all thanks to you this time!” When we found out that it was that disease, our whole family felt like the sky was falling down ...”

Xia ruofei smiled.”It’s all thanks to old Mr. Li’s good health and his strong desire to live. Otherwise, no matter how good the medicine is, it won’t work.”

“I brought another dose of Chinese medicine today. I’ll check old Mr. Li’s pulse after he’s taken it and see how he’s recovering,” Xia ruofei continued.

The couple, Niu Yusheng and Li Guizhi, had long been convinced by Xia ruofei’s medical skills. Naturally, they would listen to Xia ruofei’s words when it came to treatment.

......

Xia ruofei thought for a while.”Oh, it’s almost noon. They should be back soon, right?” he asked.

“Our old master is always gone for the whole day. They brought lunch with them,” Niu Yusheng said with a bitter smile.

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but feel that he had miscalculated. If he had known this would happen, he would have told ye Lingyun in advance.

Li Guizhi said,”old man, hurry up and call Xiao Ye!” If dad knows that Mr. Xia is here, he’ll definitely come back immediately. ”

“Yes, yes, yes ...” Niu Yusheng took out his phone as he spoke.

Xia ruofei wanted to call ye Lingyun too, but he saw that Niu Yusheng had already started to dial, so he gave up.

The signal in the tea garden wasn’t very good. Niu Yusheng called a few times and finally got through. He told ye Lingyun that Xia ruofei had come to Wuyi Mountain and ye Lingyun immediately said that he would inform old Mr. Li and then go down the mountain to go home.

“Mr. Xia, little ye said that she will be leaving the mountain in a while!” Niu Yusheng said with a smile.

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said and then asked,”uncle Niu, is the tea garden far from here?” Do you want me to drive over to welcome them?”

Niu Yusheng thought for a while and said,”that’s fine. In the past, the old master and little ye always took the minibus back after going down the mountain. It’s quite troublesome.” Then let’s go! I’ll lead the way for you!”

Xia ruofei pointed at the television and asked,””You haven’t finished your work, have you? Why don’t you ask aunt Guizhi to accompany me?”

Niu Yusheng chuckled as he kept his tools and said,””Guizhi is cooking at home! Since you’re here today, you have to make a few more dishes. My job doesn’t matter. It’s an old neighbor’s TV. It doesn’t matter if it’s done one day earlier or later! Mr. Xia, let’s go!”

Since Niu Yusheng had already said so, Xia ruofei did not insist. The two of them got into the car and under Niu Yusheng’s guidance, Xia ruofei drove towards the outside of the town.

On the way, Niu Yusheng gave ye Lingyun a call to let him know, in case they got on the minibus without knowing, so that they would miss each other.

After leaving the town and driving south for about ten kilometers, Niu Yusheng pointed to a small road ahead and said,””Mr. Xia, let’s just turn around and wait at the intersection. They all go down the mountain from here.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei responded. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xia ruofei turned his car around and parked it by the road. He saw li Zhifu and ye Lingyun, one old and one young, walking over from the foot of the mountain.

Hence, Xia ruofei got out of the car and went up to him. Li Zhifu and ye Lingyun obviously saw Xia ruofei and quickened their pace.

“Brother Xia!” Ye Lingyun shouted excitedly from afar.

Xia ruofei took a few quick steps and arrived in front of the two. He saw ye Lingyun wearing a training uniform that had faded from washing. There was even some mud on the bottom of his pants. He was looking at Xia ruofei with a smile.

Li Zhifu’s hair and beard were all white, but he was obviously more energetic than last time. His face was ruddy, and he was not as thin as last time.

Xia ruofei first lightly punched ye Lingyun’s shoulder, then said to li Zhifu,”Old Mr. Li!”

Li Zhifu was also very happy to see Xia ruofei.””Little Xia, why did you come here personally?”

“I’m here to see you!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”old Mr. Li, I’ll take your pulse and check your body when we get home later ...”
