Li Yifu couldn’t help but click his tongue and said,””Grand uncle – Master, the power of the Taixu xuanqing formation is too terrifying ...”

Li Yifu had heard everything about the Taixu xuanqing formation from Xia ruofei. Although he had tried the formation the day before yesterday, it was a short time and he had not experienced the trapping and attacking functions of the formation himself, so he did not have a direct experience.

But today, Li Yifu had personally witnessed a Qi refining Level 7 array Dao master being pushed to the brink of a mental breakdown by the illusory formation of the Taixu xuanqing formation without any resistance. Li Yifu’s heart was shocked. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”this is only the tip of the iceberg of the Taixu xuanqing formation. It’s also because the opponent is too weak. There are still a few formations that I haven’t had the chance to use!” However ... This is only effective against Qi condensation cultivators. If Jindan or even Yuanying cultivators were to come here, it would be difficult for this level of illusory formation to affect them. ”

Li Yifu’s mind was in a state of chaos. He felt that with the formation in his hands, he could rule the world. Even if the star Seizer sect sent out all their forces, they would not be able to deal with such a heaven – defying formation. After hearing Xia ruofei’s words, he suddenly realized something and said hurriedly,””Senior granduncle, this disciple understands!”

Xia ruofei once again looked into the array. Wang Boshan had already fainted, and Zheng Yongshou’s breathing was chaotic and he seemed to have gone crazy. The true Qi in his body was almost exhausted. The key was that his emotions were in turmoil and he had completely fallen into fear.

“It’s almost time!” Xia ruofei said,”adopted husband, stay here and don’t move in case you get hurt by the formation. I’ll go and deal with these two guys!”

“Yes! Martial granduncle, you be careful too. ” Li Yifu quickly said.

He knew that his cultivation level was low, especially in the field of arrays. He would only be a burden if he followed.

Xia ruofei nodded and stepped into the formation.

The illusory formation that scared Zheng Yongshou and Wang Boshan out of their wits had no effect on Xia ruofei at all. The entire formation was controlled by his thoughts. The formation automatically separated on his path.

Xia ruofei didn’t care about Zheng Yongshou who was in a state of madness. Instead, he went directly to Wang Boshan and penetrated his body with spiritual power, entering his sea of consciousness without any obstacles.

Then, a soul seal was sent into Wang Boshan’s sea of consciousness by Xia ruofei.

The next moment, Xia ruofei felt a spiritual connection with Wang Boshan. He knew that the soul seal had been successfully planted.

So he withdrew his mental power, and without caring about the still unconscious Wang Boshan, he came to Zheng Yongshou.

It was slightly different from before. This time, Xia ruofei directly released a huge amount of spiritual power and suppressed Zheng Yongshou with a majestic force.

Zheng Yongshou himself was in a state of confusion, and his spiritual power cultivation was a whole realm lower than Xia ruofei ‘s. How could he have the power to resist in such a situation?

He didn’t have any reaction before he fell unconscious under the pressure of the powerful spiritual power.

Xia ruofei didn’t stop at all. He used the last soul seal that he had condensed a few days ago.

The soul seal disappeared in a flash and entered Zheng Yongshou’s forehead.

A trace of mental connection was established. Xia ruofei took in Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou as soul slaves without any effort.

With a wave of his hand, he stopped the Taixu xuanqing formation. At the same time, he stimulated the two’s sea of consciousness with his spiritual power, and they woke up at once.

After a short period of confusion, Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou saw Xia ruofei standing with his hands behind his back. They couldn’t help but feel a shiver in their souls. This kind of absolute obedience came from the depths of their souls and was not under their control at all.

Even though they hated Xia ruofei to the core, after the soul seal was planted, they had undoubtedly become Xia ruofei’s most loyal servants.

“Master!” Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou knelt in front of Xia ruofei and greeted him respectfully.

“Get up!” Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Yes! Thank you, master!” The two of them said in unison. Then, they stood up and stood beside Xia ruofei with their hands by their sides.

“You guys wait here for a while!” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes! Master!”

Xia ruofei walked towards Li Yifu who was not far away.

Li Yifu was already dumbfounded. He only saw Xia ruofei walk over and didn’t see Xia ruofei do anything special. He vaguely saw Xia ruofei release a ray of light. This light entered Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou’s foreheads, but it was so fast that he couldn’t see it clearly. Then, he saw Wang Boshan and Zheng Yongshou respectfully kneeling in front of Xia ruofei and calling him master.

What was this?

Xia ruofei did not intend to hide it from Li Yifu. He walked in front of Li Yifu and smiled.”Foster husband, this is the most important part of my plan. I’ll first subdue the two of them completely, then we’ll arrange the next step of the plan.”

“Senior granduncle, you ... How did you do it?” Li Yifu asked.

Xia ruofei said indifferently,”it’s just an application of spiritual power. There’s a secret technique called the soul seal that can make a person’s soul completely submit to it. Previously, we used this method on benilati. That’s why I’m so assured of him. After being planted with the soul seal, he will never betray us.”
