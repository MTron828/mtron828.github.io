3157 The method of elimination (2)

On one hand, it was out of respect for Wang Chi’s academic status. On the other hand, it was also because the content of his speech was indeed strong.

Wang Chi walked down the stage with a smile on his face and returned to his seat.

“Academician Wang, you’re indeed a leading figure in your field,” Xia ruofei said.”Your speech was very interesting!”

Wang Chi said humbly,”after I received the notice of this meeting, I spent a few days preparing. It was inevitable that I made some mistakes. I hope everyone can give me some advice!”

“I don’t dare to give you any advice!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I think academician Wang’s speech is very mature. It can be published in an SCI Journal!”

Guo Qian and Li Yufu both agreed with Wang Chi’s statement.

The PhD student, Feng Xiaoyi, felt honored.

As a member of Beijing University’s computer science research Institute, Feng Xiaoyi felt a little embarrassed after Shen Heping’s incident. He was even more disdainful of Shen Pingping.

Fortunately, his teacher, Wang Chi, immediately regained his face.

Wang Chi smiled and waved his hand,”you’re all too kind!” I don’t deserve that!”

Even though he said that, Wang Chi was still a little proud of himself. Of course, he was pleased with himself because of the acknowledgment from his peers like Guo Qian and Li Yufu. As for Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan, he didn’t think that these two young people would know much about professional stuff. He thought that their praise was more of flattery.

Even if they were “complimenting each other,” they had to be of similar academic standards to feel a sense of accomplishment!

Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan looked at each other and said,””Thank you to the three expert professors for your wonderful speech. I think it’s almost time, so why don’t we go to the cafeteria for lunch first, take a break at noon, and then we can have some exchanges in the afternoon?”

This morning’s schedule was supposed to finish the entire meeting in half a day.

However, each expert’s speech time was a little too long, and with Shen Heping’s interlude, a lot of time had been wasted. Secondly, after listening to everyone’s speech, Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan had both improved greatly. At the same time, they had accumulated a lot of questions. Hence, he considered holding the exchange in the afternoon to give them more time.

However, he had forgotten that the Qin Zhuan experts and professors were also human. They had come to this small exchange meeting not only to give face to the person who had entrusted them with the task, but also to see the legendary and extremely luxurious paradise clubhouse.

According to their original plan, they would finish their meetings in half a day, so they could have a good experience at the Paradise Club in the afternoon and evening.

Therefore, the three experts, including Wang Chi, objected to Xia ruofei’s suggestion without hesitation.

Guo Qian was the first to say,”director Xia, it’s only 11:30 now. I think it’s still early!” Why don’t we strike while the iron is hot and immediately enter the exchange session!”

“I also agree with elder Guo’s opinion.” Li Yufu said,”I’ve just heard everyone’s speech, and I have the deepest impression of them. It might be better to communicate now!”

Wang Chi also smiled and nodded,”President Xia, there’s no hurry to eat. We can talk to each other first!” He talked through the problem. I think we can even get the restaurant to pack some takeaway and we can eat in the conference room! That’s not bad!”

“Academician Wang’s suggestion is not bad!” Guo Qian immediately expressed his agreement.

“Work is the most important! I also agree!” Li Yufu said.

Xia ruofei and the others looked at each other, but Xia ruofei quickly guessed what the experts and professors were thinking. He smiled and nodded.””Then let’s continue to the next segment!”

Then, he turned to song Rui and said,””Xiao Rui, inform the restaurant to prepare the dishes first. Only start cooking after receiving the notice!”

Of course, he wouldn’t let the experts and professors eat lunch. Besides, they were the ones who made the decisions at the Paradise clubhouse, so they could eat whenever they wanted.

“Alright!” Song Rui stood up and said,”then you guys talk first. I’ll go to the restaurant to take a look.”

After song Rui left, Xia ruofei focused on communication.

Exchanging glances with Chen Xuan, he raised his own question,””Academician Wang, I’m very interested in your speech on using the supercomputer’s method of elimination to solve practical problems. There are a few things that I don’t understand, and I hope you can teach me!”

After that, Xia ruofei raised some of the questions he had after hearing about Wang Chi’s case.

Xia ruofei’s questions were all targeted. After all, his ultimate goal was to use a supercomputer to crack the secret of the floating point pattern on the token.

According to their speculations, each group of these floating point patterns likely represented a Chinese character.

There were about 3000 Chinese characters, and there were about 1000 to 2000 commonly used ones. Therefore, each set of floating point patterns had about 2000 to 3000 possibilities.

When all the floating point patterns were combined, the possibility would be an astronomical figure.

It was impossible to crack it by human strength.

This was also the reason why Xia ruofei and Chen Xuan thought of using supercomputers to crack the code.

And this kind of cracking actually used the method of exhaustion.

Supercomputers could do things that the human brain couldn ‘t.

The supercomputer could list all the possibilities and compare them one by one.

Of course, the premise was that he had enough time and enough long – distance computing ability.

Hence, Xia ruofei was especially interested in the example of the law of elimination mentioned by Wang Chi and listened to it the most seriously. Xia ruofei and the others looked at each other, but Xia ruofei quickly guessed what the experts and professors were thinking. He smiled and nodded.””Then let’s continue to the next segment!”
