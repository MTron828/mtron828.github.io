Translator: 549690339

Xia ruofei’s eyes were filled with adoration. He smiled and said,””You little girl, you’re already a university student, but you’re still so energetic! Slow down, don’t fall ...”

“We have brother RUO Fei here!” Lin Qiao wrapped her arms around Xia ruofei’s waist and looked up at him with a smile. Her eyes were full of reliance on Xia ruofei.

Hu Zi’s mother laughed.”You little girl. How old are you already? why are you still so clingy to your brother ruofei?”

Lin Qiao smiled mischievously and said,”mom!” Quickly go and cook! You’ve been talking about making delicious food for brother ruofei since yesterday ...”

“Alright, alright, alright!” Hu Zi’s mother said,”ruofei, take a rest in the living room. Dinner will be ready soon!”

“Alright, godmother, thank you for your hard work!” Xia ruofei quickly said.

“This child, you’re still being so polite to godmother!” Hu ‘er’s mother rebuked.

“Oh, godmother! I’ve brought you some vegetables, you can put them in the refrigerator!” Xia ruofei said as he passed the bag of Taoyuan vegetables to Hu Zi’s mother.

“You bring something every time you come! Aren’t you wasting money by selling these vegetables at such an expensive price?” Hu’s mother nagged as she took the bag to the kitchen.

Even though she was blaming Xia ruofei, her eyes were filled with relief.

In the living room, Xia ruofei glanced at Lin Qiao and said,””Stop looking! The things in this bag are for you!”

“Long live brother ruofei!” Lin Qiao cheered and grabbed the big bag.”Wow! Yellow pea cake! Poria Cocos Park! And date paste cake ...”

Seeing Lin Qiao’s happy face, Xia ruofei couldn’t help but shake his head.”What a greedy little cat ... Hey! Don’t eat it now! I won’t be able to eat later ...”

Lin Qiao’s mouth was stuffed with pastries as she mumbled, “It’s okay, I’m just trying it ...”

Xia ruofei shook his head with a bitter smile.””This girl ...”

“Qiao’ er, how does University feel?” Xia ruofei asked as he leaned on the sofa.

“Not bad! Most of the first years are basic courses, but you’ve also come into contact with some professional stuff. There are many big names among the teachers!” Lin Qiao said.

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”systematic learning is very important. Don’t think too much over the next few years. Just focus on your profession. Don’t save on money. Your brother is not short of money now!”

“I know!” Lin Qiao said,”you gave me so much money in one go. I won’t be able to finish spending it in four years!”

When Lin Qiao started school, Xia ruofei secretly gave her a bank card with 300000 Yuan in it.

Lin Qiao had always been very sensible. Xia ruofei was not worried that she would spend money recklessly. Anyway, he treated Lin Qiao as his own sister. Girls should be raised well and could not be wronged.

“I’m afraid that you won’t be able to bear to spend the money, so I’ve made you a bank card!”Xia ruofei smiled.

“Brother ruofei is the best!” Lin Qiao said with a sweet smile.

Very quickly, Hu Zi’s mother had finished cooking. The three of them sat in the bright and spacious dining room and had a happy lunch.

Everyone was in a good mood today, so they drank a little wine. Lin Qiao also drank two glasses of Semillon wine. Her little face was red, which made her look even more lovely.

After the meal, Xia ruofei smiled and said,””Godmother, Qiao’ er, I bought each of you a piece of Jade when I went to the capital this time ...”

“RUO Fei, you’re wasting money again!” Hu Zi’s mother reproached,”Godma is already so old, why is she still wearing Jade?”

“Jade is meant to be used. What does this have to do with age?” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”I spent a lot of time and effort to get this Jade. You must wear it on your body and never take it off!”

Xia ruofei said as he took out two protective jade leaves from his bag.

When he opened his palm, Hu Zi’s mother and Lin Qiao couldn’t help but widen their eyes.

“So beautiful! It’s like a real leaf!” Lin Qiao was indeed a student of advertising design. She was keenly aware of the extraordinariness of these jade leaves.”I feel that they seem to have a spirit of their own. They look very comfortable and harmonious!”

“Ruofei, this Jade must be very expensive, right?” Hu Zi’s mother said, her heart aching.

Xia ruofei smiled and said,””I didn’t spend much! “Godmother, you have to remember my words. This Jade has to be worn on your body to change your aura. If you hide it at home, it’ll be a waste of my good intentions. Also, you can’t let others touch it easily, or else your aura will be chaotic, and my money will really be wasted ...”

Xia ruofei was also worried that Hu Zi’s mother would think that the Jade was too precious and would not bear to bring it along. If she kept it as a treasure, it would really be a waste.

Moreover, wearing Jade had these requirements, so he was right.

Hu Zi’s mother also knew Xia ruofei’s temper. The Jade Leaf had already been bought, and she had no choice but to accept it. Back then, Xia ruofei had tried his best to make her accept the entire house!

She had no choice but to smile bitterly and said,”I know!” Godmother will definitely wear it every day and will never take it off!”

“Me too!” Lin Qiao immediately raised her hand. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xia ruofei was relieved. He stood up and said,””Come, come, come, I’ll help you put it on now! Godmother first!”

With that, Xia ruofei placed one of the Jade leaves on the coffee table and picked up the other Jade Leaf. He walked behind Hu Zi’s mother.
