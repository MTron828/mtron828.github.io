2656 I’ll take as much as I have (2)

“You bought an Island ...” Guo Zhan couldn’t help but be speechless for a while. Then he said,”you’re really rich!”

“Wolf King, be more forthright!” Xia ruofei said,”are you going to help me or not?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Guo Zhan touched the stubble on his chin and his eyes flashed. He then said with a smile, “It’s rare for you to ask me, so how can I not help you? Just tell me how many people you need!”

“I’ll take as many as I can!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”our lone Wolf’s soldiers are the best of the best. I can’t have too many of such talents!”

Xia ruofei himself was from this unit. He knew the soldiers in this unit too well. It was no exaggeration to say that if these people were to participate in the International Scout competition, they would definitely be able to beat up the contestants from other countries. Also, if the small mercenary organizations were to encounter the lone wolf assault team, they would definitely be beaten to a pulp.

Such elites, naturally, they would take as many as they could, only a fool would refuse!

“Rich and overbearing ... You’re exuding the aura of a local tyrant from head to toe!” Guo Zhan couldn’t help but point at Xia ruofei and said,”sure! I’ll remember this. I’ll try my best to contact them for you later. I’ll also help you with this! However, I’ll definitely be busy for the next few days. I’ll probably only be free after the defense is in place. ”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”it’s not that urgent, but you have to remember it. Don’t forget about it!”

“I’m not that old to the point of forgetfulness!” Guo Zhan said as he glanced at Xia ruofei.

Then, Guo Zhan suddenly asked,”sanguine Wolf, you want all those retired sergeants, then ... Do you want the officers?”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but be stunned. He subconsciously asked,””Officer? Why would the officer be here?”

The officers of the lone wolf assault team were more stable than the soldiers. Even if they left the Army, they would be transferred to another job. The country would arrange a job for them. At the very least, they would be employed by a career or enterprise. Many of them could work as civil servants. The military reform period for officers who had reached 20 years was reduced to 18 years. They could still choose to find their own jobs, which meant that they did not need the country to arrange a job for them. Instead, they could find a job on their own, and the country would give them a monthly pension.

It could be said that the treatment was very generous.

Because the combat attributes of the lone wolf commando team were very strong, even officers would generally transfer to other troops if their physical conditions were not suitable for the job after they reached a certain age. It was very rare to meet the requirements to choose a job during the working period of the Commando team.

In other words, most of the retired officers of the lone wolf commando unit were the kind of people who were assigned to work by the country. Why would they work for Xia ruofei?

Even if there were, they should be in the minority! Why did Guo Zhan specifically ask this question? Xia ruofei was also a little confused.

Guo Zhan smiled bitterly and said,”after the military reform, we were assigned to the Marine Corps, and the number of authorized personnel has been reduced a lot. We may become an assault Battalion under a certain Army Brigade ...”

“Ah?” Xia ruofei couldn’t help but cry out,”downgrade to Battalion? Then ... Then you ...”

Originally, the lone wolf assault team was a regimental establishment. Guo Zhan, the military chief, was a Colonel. If he was transferred to the Naval Brigade and downgraded to an assault Battalion, it meant that the number of authorized personnel would be reduced. In addition, Guo Zhan was a Colonel. How could he be a battalion commander?

Guo Zhan heard this and said with a worried expression,”The organization made me the Chief of Staff of the land Brigade and the commander of this assault Battalion.”

Only then did Xia ruofei relax a little. The Chief of Staff of the Kongtong Brigade was also a Regiment commander. Although he was no longer the military chief, being transferred to this leading position that played an important role in the military work of the entire Brigade was considered an important position for Guo Zhan.

Guo Zhan continued,”my position as battalion commander is temporary. The main thing is that after lone wolf is transferred over, there needs to be someone who can hold the team back ... Because of the established positions, some comrades will have to leave their leadership positions, and many comrades will be separated or even arranged to change jobs.”

Xia ruofei immediately understood that the military reform this time was to first determine the establishment and then arrange the personnel according to the establishment. The lone wolf assault team had become an assault Battalion, and there were fewer positions from top to bottom. There would definitely be some officers and soldiers who could not be incorporated.

For the time being, these people could still continue to work in the case of overstaffed. However, because they could not be enlisted this time, the only options waiting for them were to be transferred to other troops or transfer to another profession on the spot. The newly implemented civilian staff system was mainly targeted at colleges, hospitals, and some troops with concentrated skills. There were very few civilian positions in a pure combat force like the Marine Corps.

Xia ruofei thought for a while and couldn’t help but say,””Wolf King, even if some of lone Wolf’s officers can’t join us this time, they can still choose to be separated! Even if they were transferred to another job, it would still be a formal establishment, and there would be no problem for them to be stable for the rest of their lives. Why would they choose to work for me? It’s impossible!”

“Our officers have always been working in the field of combat. Many of them have transferred to other places and don’t have a suitable position at all. For example, a sniper can shoot accurately from a thousand meters away and clear targets when he was still a lone wolf. He’s become the enemy’s nightmare, but what can he do when he transferred to other places? Go to the public security or special police force and continue to be a sniper? After all, such positions are limited. Many people can only go to the local government offices and do some writing work that they are not good at. ”

Speaking of this, Guo Zhan couldn’t help but sigh and say,””The young comrades nowadays are bold, quick – witted, and relatively new in terms of ideas. Although some of them do not meet the requirements to choose their own career, they still choose jobs that do not need to be arranged. They are willing to leave the Army with the Veterans ‘treatment and then go out to start a business or work. As far as I know, there are already a few executives who have the same idea. ”

Guo Zhan looked at Xia ruofei and continued,””I’m just thinking, if these comrades choose to be discharged, would your place be a good place to go?”

Xia ruofei replied,”of course I welcome you with open arms!” I’m just worried that everyone will be wronged! After all, I’m a private enterprise, and I don’t have any official organization. Of course, if my brothers come to work with me, no matter if they are officers or soldiers, I will definitely not mistreat them in terms of treatment. Take officers as an example, if you work with me, your income will at least double or even several times that of when you are transferred to another profession!”

“I’m relieved to hear that!” Guo Zhan said happily,”let me tell you ... Soldiers like us are really not used to working from nine to five in the morning. I guess if those guys hear that you have an Island overseas and can operate guns and cannons there all day long, they will definitely choose to be discharged and go to your place without even thinking about it!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”the equipment is definitely awesome! I’ll try my best to get any equipment that they want! If I can’t buy it through the normal channels, I’ll go to the arms black market! As long as you have money, there’s no equipment that you can’t get. ”

“You Rascal ... You’re making me want to go!” Guo Zhan couldn’t help but laugh and say,”alright, don’t go back today! I’ll find a few comrades you’re familiar with tonight and we’ll get together!”

“Ah?” Xia ruofei said subconsciously.

He had originally wanted to return as soon as possible after he had finished his business here. The matter of the star picking sect had been on his mind all this time, and he was always a little absent – minded before he solved this problem.

“What’s with the “ah”? You still want to run?” Guo Zhan laughed and scolded,”it’s settled then! This is an order!”

Without waiting for Xia ruofei’s reply, Guo Zhan picked up the phone on his desk and called a civil servant, asking him to arrange a guest room for Xia ruofei.
