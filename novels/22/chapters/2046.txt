2047 Personally cooking (2)

After Xia ruofei greeted them, Wu Qiang finally persuaded Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan to go into the dining room together. They sat down cautiously.

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”that’s right!” In the future, unless there are too many guests and we can’t sit down, this is how we usually eat. You’re working for me, not the servants of the old society, so why are you all being divided into different classes?”

“I know, boss!” Wu Xiujuan said.

Her heart felt warm. It felt great to be respected.

She used to be a nanny in the county, eating and living at her employer’s house. The feeling of living under someone else’s roof was very obvious. Every time she ordered a few dishes in her own kitchen, her employer never asked her to serve them.

Xia ruofei saw that Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan were a little restrained, so he laughed and chatted with them while eating. Slowly, they relaxed. They sat around and ate, and it was quite a happy and harmonious feeling.

As Xia ruofei had instructed them to make the food light, there were no greasy dishes for lunch. Wu Xiujuan’s cooking was very good, and Xia ruofei ate with relish. He could not help but give Wu Xiujuan a thumbs – up.

Wu Xiujuan was happy that her cooking skills had been recognized. She quickly advised Xia ruofei to eat more.

Xia ruofei had just finished his lunch and was about to go for a walk in the front yard when he received a call from Zhao Yongjun.

“Big brother Zhao! Have you eaten?” Xia ruofei chuckled as he answered the call.

“I really didn’t eat it!” Zhao Yongjun said,”you want to treat me to a meal?”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”you’re thinking too much!” I just wanted to tell you that I’ve already finished my meal. If you want to come over for a free meal, it’s too late now ...”

“Damn ... You’re too stingy!” Zhao Yongjun laughed and scolded,”to think that I’ve been busy all this time for you!”

“Oh, really? Have you settled the visa issue?” Xia ruofei quickly asked.

“You have a passport ready, right?” Zhao Yongjun asked.

“Yes, yes!” Xia ruofei said.

It was his first time in Hong Kong, so he had applied for a passport along with the pass.

“That’s good. You can go to the Embassy to get a visa in the afternoon. Go and find that person.” Zhao Yongjun said,”is the phone still there?”

“I’ve saved it!” Xia ruofei smiled and said,”brother Zhao is awesome!”

“Don’t praise me so hypocritically! You didn’t even treat us to a meal, and you’re so full of yourself!” Zhao Yongjun said with a smile.

“Please! You must!” Xia ruofei said,”let’s do it tonight! Don’t wait until tomorrow, call the few brothers over to my courtyard house, let’s get drunk!”

“I think you want to buy this meal as soon as possible so that you can go to Italy directly!” Zhao Yongjun said.

Xia ruofei wasn’t embarrassed that Zhao Yongjun had seen through his thoughts. He just laughed.

“I don’t know what’s so attractive about Italy that you can’t even wait for a day ...” Zhao Yongjun said.”Okay, okay, you go and get your visa in the afternoon. I’ll take care of them. We’ll go by ourselves in the evening!”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said happily.

After hanging up the phone, he turned around and walked back to the backyard.

Wu Xiujuan and Xia Xiaolan were cleaning up the mess, while Wu Qiang was washing his car in the yard. When they saw Xia ruofei, they quickly stopped what they were doing and greeted him.

Xia ruofei said,”Wuqiang, sister – in – Law, the meal tomorrow night has been changed to tonight. Go and prepare the ingredients in the afternoon. Can you make it in time?”

“No problem!” Wu Xiujuan said,”half a day should be enough!”

“Alright! Wu Qiang, you drive her there. ” Xia ruofei said,”just do as I say and pick the good ones! By the way, go to Walmart and see if there’s any of our paradise brand’s Yangtze River beluga. If there is, buy a few back!”

“Alright!” Wu Qiang replied in a straightforward manner.

Xia ruofei had previously left a card for Wu Qiang. Whether it was for gas, grocery shopping, or other expenses, he had used this card.

This was similar to the company’s public service card. Wu Qiang only needed to arrange the invoices and card swipe forms regularly and mail them back to the company’s finance department to cancel out the accounts.

After that, Xia ruofei walked to the middle courtyard and called Captain Liu An.

He first asked Liu An about the crew’s situation and learned that they were all ready. He asked Liu An and the crew to fly to Beijing today and get ready to fly directly to Turin, Italy the next day.

After everything was arranged, Xia ruofei saw that it was almost time, so he went to the alley and took a taxi to the Italy Embassy.

He already had the experience of applying for a visa using Xia Tian’s identity, so he was very familiar with the process.

Zhao Yongjun’s acquaintance was also very helpful. He brought Xia ruofei through the procedures quickly and successfully applied for the visa.

Of course, he didn’t know that this young man in front of him was the “Xia Tian” that Zhao Yongjun had introduced a few days ago.

After getting the visa, Xia ruofei took a cab and returned to siheyuan.

The round trip took more than two hours, and most of the time was spent on the road.

After he returned home, he did not go straight to the backyard, but went to the basement.

There was a wine cellar here. Although the area had been reduced by half after the renovation, it was still quite large.

Xia ruofei was the only one who had access to the wine cellar’s door. Hence, even Wu Qiang did not know that there were only a few bottles of wine inside. All of Xia ruofei’s wine was stored in the spirit map space.

There were many surveillance cameras in the courtyard house. Xia ruofei’s act of taking wine from the wine cellar was naturally a cover – up.

Although the possibility of Wu Qiang analyzing the surveillance video was extremely low, Xia ruofei had already formed a habit of being cautious, especially when it came to the core secret of the spirit map space. He never dared to relax.

After staying in the wine cellar for a while, Xia ruofei took out ten bottles of the best Drunken Eight Immortals white wine from the medium. Then, after some thought, he took out two bottles of Semillon white wine.

Xia ruofei packed the wine in a paper box and left the wine cellar with it.

After locking the wine cellar’s door, Xia ruofei carried the box to the backyard.

Wu Qiang and Xia Xiaolan were busy preparing the ingredients under Wu Xiujuan’s command. When Wu Qiang saw Xia ruofei, he quickly put down the knife in his hand and took the paper box.

“Just leave the wine in the restaurant!” Xia ruofei said.

“Yes!” Wu Qiang replied.

Xia ruofei strolled to the kitchen and laughed.”Sister – in – Law, you’ve worked hard!”

Wu Xiujuan wiped the sweat off her forehead with her sleeve and said with a smile,””What’s the trouble? Compared to the farm work we do in the village, this is nothing!”

Xia Xiaolan also nodded in agreement.

“Sister – in – Law, let me take care of those Chinese perch. I promised my friend that I’d cook for you,” said Xia ruofei.

Xia ruofei had already caught a glimpse of the three Chinese perch in the tank.

“Alright!” Wu Xiujuan replied,”this kind of fish is more common in the South. I really don’t know what to cook to make it delicious!” It’ll be a waste if such an expensive fish is ruined ...”

This afternoon, Wu Xiujuan and Wu Qiang were shocked by the price of the Yangtze River pomfrets. These three small fish actually cost thousands of Yuan. In total, they were only a catty, and they were frozen ...

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”then let me do it!” Although my cooking skills are average, I do have some experience in making pomfrets ...” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The first time Xia ruofei had tasted the Chinese perch, it had been personally cooked by Ling Ji restaurant’s chef, Su Yu. After tasting it, Xia ruofei was full of praise for the delicious taste, so he had specially asked Su Yu how to cook the Chinese perch.

Although he couldn’t make it to Su Yu’s level, the ingredients were so good. If he made it according to Su Yu’s method, the taste would definitely be quite good.

Now, the production of pomfrets had also increased a little. They could produce about 3500 catties a month. The selling price was basically maintained at more than 4000 Yuan per catty, and the supply was often in short supply.

Wu Qiang and Wu Xiujuan were very lucky to be able to buy pomfrets today.

As Xia ruofei spoke, he found an apron and put it on. He rolled up his sleeves and said, “It’s time to show my strength!”

“Boss, can you teach me?” Wu Xiujuan said with a smile.”I can make it for you if you want to eat this kind of Chinese perch in the future!”

“No problem!” Xia ruofei said,”sister – in – Law, remember this. The first thing to do when cooking pomfrets is not to scrape off the fish scales. They are more delicious than the fish ...”
