Seeing Xia ruofei’s confused face, Feng Rao could not help but say in a bad mood,””The headquarters is moving! How could you forget such a big thing?”

Xia ruofei patted his forehead and smiled awkwardly.””You’re talking about this! How could I forget! Isn’t that a bit of a short – circuit in his brain?”

Then, Xia ruofei asked again,”is the progress so fast?” We can move already?”

“Jianda is placing a lot of importance on this project,” Feng Jing said. “If it weren’t for the Spring Festival holiday, the construction period would have been even shorter!” Even during the spring Festival, the construction of the building hasn’t been completely stopped. It’s just that the manpower has been reduced by about half ...”

Feng Rao took the teacup from Xia ruofei and blew on it gently. She took a sip and continued,””After the holiday, jianda sent more people over, and the progress is very fast. Now, the internal decoration work is basically completed, and we’re in the final stage of cleaning up.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xia ruofei nodded and said,”I’ll give uncle Liang a call to express my gratitude.”

Then, he asked again,”sister ran, isn’t it a little inappropriate to move in after the renovation has just been completed?” Would it affect the health of the employees? In fact, we’re not in a hurry. If it doesn’t work, we can just let it dry and ventilate the room. ”

Feng Jing laughed and said,”jianda used the best environmentally friendly materials for our renovation. The office furniture we purchased is also very environmentally friendly. In theory, the release of formaldehyde shouldn’t exceed the standard. However, after the construction is completed, we will hire a professional company to conduct a Comprehensive Environmental test. If the standard doesn’t meet the standard, we won’t move in. We can’t treat our employees ‘health as a joke.”

“This is the right thing to do!” Xia ruofei said seriously,”no matter how urgent it is, the employee’s health is the most important.”

Then, Xia ruofei continued,”sister ran, even if it passes the test, it’s best that we air it for a few days. I heard that formaldehyde is a long – term process.” Also, set up more devil’s ivy in the office and buy some tea stems to absorb the taste. ”

“I know!” Feng Rao grinned. Don’t worry!”

The two of them continued to chat about the daily work at the company. Feng Jing only left Xia ruofei’s office at around 11 am.

Seeing that it was almost time to get off work, Xia ruofei decided not to sneak out today. He stayed in the office for a while to have some tea while thinking about the company’s future development.

Now, it could be said that all kinds of business were thriving. Basically, every product line was bursting with popularity, and all of them were in a state of supply shortage.

This was something that would never happen in other companies.

It could be said that Xia ruofei’s biggest worry now was not the sales volume, but how to increase production in all aspects.

This not only included the most basic business of the Tao Yuan company, which was the Tao Yuan vegetables and fruits, but also included wild Chinese perch, Dendrobium candids, Cordyceps, tea leaves, and so on.

Of course, it was even more so for the pharmaceutical factory. Now, the trucks to pick up the soup were lining up outside the factory all night. In order to get one or two boxes of heart – nourishing soup, the people in charge of purchasing from major hospitals were basically stationed in San Shan. They spent all day in the factory office, pestering and pestering.

What Xia ruofei felt the most annoyed about were undoubtedly the profiteering products, such as the iron – Skin Dendrobium and Cordyceps sinensis.

Now that the area of the spatial zone had expanded by several times, the mountain and sea realm could be said to be vast and boundless. Logically speaking, it was completely possible to expand production.

However, this involved the most realistic problem, which was the serious lack of manpower.

The most obvious problem was the aweto. Xia ruofei personally worked with Xia Qing on the harvest of this batch of aweto, day and night.

But the aweto had to be carefully dug out from the ground one by one, and the soil had to be cleaned in the later stage, which was time – consuming and laborious. Even if Xia Qing could work without sleep or rest, the amount of work she could complete was limited.

The current size of the aweto plantation had basically reached its limit.

It was like there was a mountain of gold in front of him, but he could not dig it out. Xia ruofei felt as uncomfortable as a cat scratching at his heart.

From the looks of it, unless Xia ruofei lost his mind and captured a large number of people into the spirit map space, then imprisoned them forever in the spirit map space to work for him, it was basically impossible to expand the production of a time – consuming and laborious product like the Cordyceps.

Of course, Xia ruofei would not do that.

He let out a long sigh and muttered to himself,””If only I could have a dozen Xia Qing ...”

He let his thoughts run wild for a while and then shook his head. He no longer thought about these temporarily unsolvable problems. Instead, he used this little time to think about what formation patterns to carve on the black jade carvings.

After the last intensive study, Xia ruofei’s array Dao level had improved. In addition, whenever he was free these days, he would take the Dao bone of illusionary beast to feel the array Dao. It could be said that his realm improvement was relatively fast.

Now, Xia ruofei had mastered 20 to 30 types of array patterns. As for what array patterns to use and how to match them, Xia ruofei had to think carefully.

These black jade carvings were mainly in the shape of a Bell or a statue of the Lord of Guan. Their function was naturally to ward off evil spirits and disasters. Hence, Xia ruofei had also focused on the formation patterns in this area.
