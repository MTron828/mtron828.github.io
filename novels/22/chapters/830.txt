“Yes, yes, director. You can just call me little Huang!” Huang Zhenyu said with joy on his face.

However, Lu Yang’s next words made Huang Zhenyu fall from heaven to hell, as if a basin of cold water had been poured over his head.

“Huang Zhenyu, you bastard!” Lu Yang cursed. Who gave you the right to randomly interview people? Didn’t you not get your reporter’s pass? What right do you have to represent the provincial station for an interview? Ah? Distorting black and white, spreading lies, maliciously creating hype, and slandering martyrs, you really ate a bear’s heart and a leopard’s gall! The entertainment channel’s face has been completely lost by you! If you want to die, don’t drag everyone down with you!”

Huang Zhenyu’s face turned pale and he stuttered,””Director Lu, this ... There must be a misunderstanding here ... Please let me explain ...”

“The discipline Inspection team has already investigated everything. The evidence is conclusive. What else do you have to explain?” Lu Yang said angrily,”you should save that nonsense for the group’s Discipline Inspection team!”

“Ah?” Huang Zhenyu suddenly felt a chill in his heart.

The SARFT was roughly in between a state – owned enterprise and a public institution. The so – called Discipline Inspection team was the organization that the provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection had assigned to the SARFT. The team leader of the discipline Inspection team would enter the SARFT’s leadership team, so the discipline Inspection team was equivalent to the local Commission for Discipline Inspection.

Of course, no one would like to be invited to tea by the discipline Inspection team, especially Huang Zhenyu, who had a guilty conscience.

Lu Yang’s next words made Huang Zhenyu’s heart sink to the bottom.

“I forgot to tell you,” he said.”Chen Ziqiang has already truthfully explained the situation of the bribery crime to the comrades of the discipline Inspection team. You’d better not have any wishful thinking!”

With that, Lu Yang hung up the phone directly, and Huang Zhenyu fell to the ground.

Chen Ziqiang was the Deputy Director of the entertainment channel’s reporters Department. Huang Zhenyu had been selected to be transferred to the provincial station through paying tribute to this Deputy Director Chen.

Huang Zhenyu still had a glimmer of hope just now. He felt that if he asked Deputy Director Chen for help, there might be a glimmer of hope. After all, Deputy Director Chen was in the same boat as him. He would also be afraid that he would bite him out if he was forced into a corner!

However, Huang Zhenyu did not expect that the situation had already become so bad that even Chen Ziqiang could not protect himself.

He suddenly realized something and turned to look at Xia ruofei in disbelief.

Could it be that all of this was really caused by that phone call? In less than half an hour after the phone call, even director Lu was alarmed ... No, even the group’s Discipline Inspection team was alarmed. Deputy Director Chen was even interviewed by the discipline Inspection team and had even confessed to being bribed!

All of this had happened in just half an hour.

If it was really Xia ruofei’s doing, how much power did he have to make the people in the organization, who had always been stable, so efficient?

Huang Zhenyu suddenly felt as if he had done something extremely stupid, putting himself in a situation beyond redemption.

In reality, Huang Zhenyu did not know that this matter had not only alarmed the provincial SARFT’s disciplinary team.

Half an hour ago, Luo Jiawei, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the head of the Provincial Party Committee’s publicity department, had personally called the chairman of the provincial SARFT. Over the phone, Minister Luo had severely criticized the provincial SARFT for not being strict in the control of news and the lax management of its staff. This had scared the chairman of the SARFT so much that he was trembling with fear. He did not know what he had done wrong to make Minister Luo call him in such an angry manner.

After the chairman carefully reflected and admitted his mistake, Luo Jiawei then told him about Huang Zhenyu’s matter that song Rui had retold. Then, he strictly ordered that the case should be investigated and investigated to the end. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The chairman of the SARFT, who had been inexplicably reprimanded, was naturally extremely depressed. He was so angry that he beat and scolded the entertainment channel’s director, Lu Yang. Then, the group’s Discipline Inspection team quickly took action and launched an investigation into the incident.

Seriousness was the only thing that could be feared.

Moreover, Huang Zhenyu had only been employed for two months. It would not take long for them to find out how he had been selected to be transferred to the provincial station and what he had done in the past two months.

The Deputy Director of the entertainment channel’s reporter Department, Chen Ziqiang, naturally fell from his position.

After an investigation, the discipline Inspection team found that Huang Zhenyu had not only stirred up a hornet’s nest this time, but he had also not only been transferred to the station through improper means. He had only been on duty for a short two months, but he had actually violated several rules in several reports and had even accepted red packets from interviewees several times.

Such a bold and insatiable villain had actually sneaked into the provincial station and the entertainment channel. Lu Yang was also inexplicably angry. After scolding several leaders of the press department, he still felt angry. He found Huang Zhenyu’s phone number and personally called to scold him.

Just as Huang Zhenyu was feeling as if he had lost his parents, Xia ruofei’s phone rang.

He glanced at it and saw that it was an unfamiliar number from Ganjiang.

Xia ruofei looked at Huang Zhenyu with a faint smile and answered the phone.

“Hello, are you Mr. Xia?” The person on the other end of the phone was very young. His attitude was very polite, and he was also a little careful.

“I’m Xia ruofei, and you are?”Xia ruofei said indifferently.

“Hello, Mr. Xia!” The young voice said,”I’m lu Wen, the Secretary of Minister Luo from the Provincial Party Committee’s publicity department. When I called you, I was instructed by Minister Luo to report to you the investigation of the fake reporter Huang Zhenyu.”
