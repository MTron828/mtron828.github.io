2065 Meeting (1)

Seeing this, Monica couldn’t help but ask worriedly,””Rousey, what’s wrong? Does it hurt?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Monica had never come into contact with Chinese medicine before. The strong smell of medicinal herbs emitted by the ointment was quite pungent to her. Now that she saw Rousey’s reaction, she subconsciously thought that the ointment was very strong and made Rousey feel very painful.

Rousey raised his hand and waved it, saying,””No, no! Monica doesn’t hurt at all. On the contrary, it’s simply ... It’s simply too comfortable. Compared to the massage just now, it’s like hell and heaven!”

After the ointment came into contact with Rousey’s skin, he immediately felt a cooling sensation. Especially after he had just experienced the painful massage process, this cool feeling made him feel like he was drinking sweet dew. He was so comfortable that he almost moaned.

Xia ruofei applied the ointment on Rousey’s calf seriously and said without turning his head,””Monica, I just said that the next treatment process would not be painful. It seems that you don’t believe me! This is really sad ...”

Monica said, a little embarrassed,””Xia ... That’s not what I meant. I was just too concerned about Rousey ...”

“But my heart has been hurt, you have to compensate me!” Xia ruofei said deliberately,”why don’t we ...”

“Yes! I’ll listen to you!” Monica did not wait for Xia ruofei to finish and said hurriedly.

Her younger brother was right beside her. If this guy said something explicit, she would really have no place to hide her face.

“You said it yourself!” Xia ruofei laughed.

“En!” Monica glared at Xia ruofei and said.

Rousey tactfully maintained his silence and even closed his eyes to recuperate. Of course, that slight cool feeling also made him relax. Closing his eyes to rest for a while at this time was simply too comfortable!

After Xia ruofei finished applying the ointment for Rousey, he stood up and said,”Monica, this ointment is very precious. Don’t waste it ...”

After saying that, he pretended to apply the remaining ointment on Monica’s body.

Monica’s beautiful face turned pale. She laughed while stepping back and said,”I don’t want to ...”

Xia ruofei sighed and shook his head.””You really don’t know your stuff!”

With that, he turned around and applied the ointment on Rousey’s body. Rousey didn’t put on her clothes, and applied it directly on his chest and abdomen. It was very convenient.

“Hey! Xia, don’t you dare bully my brother!” Monica shouted.

Without waiting for Xia ruofei to speak, Rousey quickly said,””It’s fine, it’s fine! It’s very comfortable to apply on your body!”

“Did you hear that?” Xia ruofei said proudly,”Luo Si is the one who knows the best!”

Monica flattened her nose and said,””As long as you can cure his leg, forget ointment, even if you take ... Some kind of excrement and apply it on him, he won’t have any objections ...”

“Hey, Monica, you’re too disgusting!” Rousey cried out in dissatisfaction, and then laughed.”But you’re not wrong ...”

Xia ruofei had already used both of his hands to apply as much of the ointment as possible on Rousey’s body. He was not joking with Monica. The petals of the spirit Heart Flower were evenly mixed in the ointment. Such precious petals should not be wasted.

Xia ruofei took off his gloves and threw them into the trash can. Then, he said,””Alright! Rousey, just leave the ointment here. Wash it off before you go to bed at night. You might have to eat your lunch in bed. ”

“No problem, I’ll do as you say!” Rousey said readily.

Xia ruofei nodded and said to Monica,”Cover the rest of the ointment with a preservation film and store it in the refrigerator.”

The ointment he had made this time was enough to be used three to four times.

“Alright, leave it to me!” Monica said,”Xia, you’ve worked hard in the morning. Go back and rest for a while. I’ll call you for lunch!”

Xia ruofei smiled and nodded. He bade Luo Si farewell and left the room.

Xia ruofei’s plan was to treat Rossi once a day. He would split the components of a spirit Heart Flower petal into three to four days and let Rossi absorb them all. Supplemented by acupuncture, massage, and the medicinal effect of the ointment itself.

The first stage of the treatment had basically come to an end.

In reality, Xia ruofei’s current stock of spirit Heart Flower petals was relatively rich. If he used a few petals and let Luo Si consume them all at once, there was a high chance that Luo Si would recover immediately.

However, in this case, it was far from being able to be explained by having excellent medical skills. It had even exceeded the scope of human understanding.

To be safe, Xia ruofei would rather take the trouble.

Luo SI’s condition was relatively serious. According to Xia ruofei’s deduction, after using an entire spirit Heart Flower petal, in addition to his special acupuncture and massage techniques, Luo SI’s leg deformity should be able to be corrected. The nerves in his leg should also be able to recover.

But after all, Rossi’s leg muscles had atrophied. If he wanted to completely return to normal walking, he would need follow – up rehabilitation therapy, which could be completed by normal medical means.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s mission would be considered complete if he could solve the problem that the medical experts were helpless against.

In the afternoon, Monica had lunch with Xia ruofei, while Rousey had lunch in his room while lying on the bed.
