Chapter 1744: Leniency to those who confess (2)

Ling Qingxue’s heart skipped a beat. She hesitated and said,””It depends ... I still have a few more important tasks on hand ...”

Ling Qingxue immediately added,””But I should be done with it soon. I’ll tell my dad to let me rest for a few days!”

Xia ruofei and Ling Qingxue had talked about traveling together a few times. However, Ling Xiaotian had the intention to gradually hand over his work to Ling Qingxue, so he had placed quite a heavy burden on her. Ling Qingxue had not been able to find time.

Although Ling Qingxue didn’t say it out loud, she still felt a sense of crisis about the blunder that had happened on Weibo.

Besides, who wouldn’t want to stick together when they were in love? Ling Qingxue was just carrying too many things on her back.

Xia ruofei said happily,”sure!” Then I’ll wait for you to finish your work! My time is easy to arrange, I can go out at any time!”

Ling Qingxue chuckled and said,”I know you’re a Big Boss who doesn’t care about anything!” Sigh ... We’re both in charge of the same company, but why am I the only one who has to work so hard! No, I’m too jealous of you! Please coax me, or I’ll feel too unbalanced ...”

Xia ruofei rolled his eyes and said with an evil smile,””I’ll make it up to you when I come back ...”

Ling Qingxue’s pretty face instantly heated up. She lowered her eyes and said,””Your brain is full of unhealthy thoughts! I’m not going to talk to you anymore ...”

Xia ruofei said innocently,”I said that when I return to San Shan, I’ll take some time to accompany you. Even if you’re not free, I’ll just go to the office and watch you handle your work. What are you thinking?”

Xia ruofei then deliberately came to a realization and said in a long voice,””Oh, Yingluo, you ... You can’t be ...”

“You’re not allowed to say anything!” Ling Qingxue was embarrassed and said,”you bad guy, you did it on purpose! I can’t talk to you anymore, my dad is calling me for dinner ...”

After that, Ling Qingxue hung up the phone in a hurry.

The smile on Xia ruofei’s face did not fade. He opened the Weibo APP on his phone and used the username “student Ling” that Ling Qingxue had just given him to do a search. When he heard Ling Qingxue mention the Weibo account name, he almost laughed out loud.

After a quick search, Xia ruofei successfully found Ling Qingxue’s account. He was speechless when he saw that Ling Qingxue’s account was also a verified account. The verified information was “general manager of Ling Ji food and beverage group.”

Xia ruofei muttered to himself,’you’re still hiding this? Even if you didn’t tell me, I could’ve found it myself, right?”

As he spoke, he pressed the follow button. Then, after a moment of silence, he created a new Weibo post ...

Three mountains.

Ling Qingxue was holding her phone as she sat on the balcony of her house. Actually, she had already eaten. Her expression was not as relaxed as when she was talking to Xia ruofei on the phone.

She revealed a look of confusion and thought to herself,”Do I spend too little time with him ...

Although Ling Qingxue believed that Xia ruofei did not lie to her, this incident still gave her an alarm. Thinking about it, the two of them had not seen each other much in the past few months. On one hand, Xia ruofei often went out of town, and on the other hand, she was really busy.

They were usually in a hurry to meet each other, and most of the time, they communicated via WeChat or phone.

Although she could feel that Xia ruofei did not give her the cold shoulder, love still needed to be maintained. Phone calls and WeChat messages were far from enough.

Ling Qingxue was thinking if she should talk to her father about hiring a professional manager to manage the company. Just like peach blossom company, Xia ruofei basically let his subordinates do everything, and he himself was relatively free.

Ling Xiaotian and the others from the older generation still had different views. Although Ling’s restaurant was already considered a big corporation, in a sense, it was still a family business.

Such family businesses would often encounter a bottleneck after they had developed to a certain scale.

Just as Ling Qingxue was lost in her thoughts, her phone suddenly vibrated.

Ling Qingxue came back to her senses and unlocked her phone. There was a new “tag” on Weibo.

Ling Qingxue opened it and took a look. At first, she was stunned, then her eyes slowly widened. Her face gradually blushed, and the joy in her heart spread.

What she saw was a new Weibo post that Xia ruofei had just posted.

“This is the ‘King’s woman’, okay? I beg the netizens to show mercy, because there aren’t many keyboards left at home ...”

Below the Weibo post, there was a picture of an emoji that was begging for mercy.

Ling Qingxue looked at the Weibo post and laughed after a while. Her beautiful face had already turned red ...

After a short period of silence, Xia ruofei’s Weibo post was flooded with a large number of netizens. Even Ling Qingxue’s Weibo fans began to increase rapidly.

It was just the netizens ‘speculation before this. They didn’t expect Xia ruofei to be so cooperative and expose the “King’s woman”. This was solid evidence that he had personally admitted!

“Wow! It was actually the little princess of Ling Ji restaurant! This is a strong Alliance!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“My goddess! I hate you, President Xia ...”

“President Xia, you’re being naughty! How could she be called the ‘King’s woman’? You’re clearly the ‘Queen’s man’, alright? President Ling is the real overbearing President!”

“Ling Ji F & B’s employees are very happy to see this! Actually, this is no secret in our company! However, it’s a different story if the son – in – Law admits it ...”

“Previous poster, have you forgotten that your account is verified? I’ve decided to help on Weibo during work hours. No need to thank me, my surname is Lei!”

The netizens left their comments happily. Even some media accounts quickly reposted Xia ruofei’s Weibo post. One must know that Xia ruofei was now a very popular person! The information about him was the traffic guarantee.

Xia ruofei’s Weibo post caused the phrase “The King’s Woman” to rise in popularity and quickly became one of the top ten most searched words.

Among the top ten most searched topics, three of them were related to Xia ruofei. This was a Grand occasion that even many a – list celebrities might not have.

Hence, Xia ruofei’s popularity on the internet was evident.

......

Beijing, liuhai Lane courtyard house.

After posting on Weibo, Xia ruofei put his phone aside and started to make tea. He did not care about the commotion on the internet.

In fact, Xia ruofei did not hesitate much before he posted this.

His relationship with Ling Qingxue wasn’t a secret in his circle of friends, and with his current popularity, the media would probably dig up their relationship very soon after he returned to San Shan.

Rather than being exposed passively, it was better to take the initiative and be more straightforward.

He was supposed to give Ling Qingxue this title, so Xia ruofei did not hesitate about it.

What he didn’t know was that after this Weibo post was posted, Feng Jing, who had been following Xia ruofei’s Weibo situation, sighed quietly and looked a little lonely.

Xia ruofei heard footsteps behind him but he did not turn around. He could tell that it was Song Wei.

“Did I cause you trouble?” Song Wei walked to Xia ruofei and asked.

Xia ruofei laughed and replied,”no!” No! I took the initiative to explain to Qingxue, and then ...”

Xia ruofei picked up his phone and showed Song Wei the Weibo post he had just posted. “I’ve already clarified the matter. Qingxue won’t think too much about it. You can use your account as usual. I don’t think anyone will disturb you anymore.”

Song Wei’s face turned pale. She forced a smile and said,”Oh! It’s good that you’re okay ... That ... Ruofei, I came to tell you that I’m going back to school!”

“If you don’t have classes tomorrow, you can just stay here! There are many rooms here anyway. ” Xia ruofei said.

“I think I’d better go back!” Song Wei said. Otherwise, my dormitory mates will be worried ...”

“Then I’ll get Wu Qiang to send you off!” Xia ruofei said,”by the way, I’ll be back at the three mountains in about a week. You can come back in three or four days! Let’s cultivate together again. ”

“Mm! I’ll try my best to find time!” Song Wei wasn’t in high spirits. She said,”I’ll take my leave then ...”

Xia ruofei watched as Song Wei’s figure disappeared behind the moon gate. He muttered to himself,”I’m sorry! I’m not the right person for you ...
