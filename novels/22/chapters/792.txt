Chapter 793: Good things come one after another (3)

After Feng Rao finished recording, she said,””Chairman, there’s one more thing. It’s about the approval of our pharmaceutical factory’s new drug.”

Xia ruofei smiled and said,”yesterday, I heard from Lei Hu that you’ve been talking about this for the past two days. However, Lei Hu doesn’t know much about this business and can’t explain it clearly.” Tell me! What’s wrong with the approval of the new medicine?”

“It’s good news, Chairman!”Feng Jing said with a smile. The results of the heart – nourishing soup’s clinical trial at the designated Peking Union Medical College Hospital are very good. The conditions of the children with autism who participated in the trial have improved to varying degrees. After a discussion with Peking Union Medical College Hospital’s committee of experts, they believe that the first phase of the clinical trial has been a great success and agreed to end it early!”

“There’s such a good thing?”Xia ruofei was surprised. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“We were also surprised,” Feng Rao said with a smile. I heard that it was proposed by professor Feng ruixia from Peking Union Medical College Hospital’s pediatrics department. The hospital’s committee of experts carefully reviewed the medical records and various data of the heart – nourishing soup after the clinical trial at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and agreed with professor Feng ruixia’s opinion. ”

Xia ruofei laughed and said,”President Feng, you’re a good family!”

Feng Rao couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xia ruofei and said,”Professor Feng is an expert in Child Neurology and has also done in – depth research on the treatment of autism. She has achieved great results and is the person in charge of the clinical trial at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Professor Feng also saw the obvious effects of the heart – nourishing soup and felt that such a good medicine that could change the fate of children should not be dragged down by the cumbersome process, so he took the initiative to suggest it. We did not do any public relations work!”

Xia ruofei couldn’t help but give him a thumbs up.”A doctor really has the heart of a parent! This professor Feng was a person worthy of respect! Director Feng, please find out what project professor Feng is currently researching, and then sponsor this project in the name of the Paradise Corporation!”

“Understood!” Feng Jing said,”Chairman, the second phase of the clinical trial will begin very soon. The scope of the second phase is much wider, and it will involve 20 hospitals. The number of patients participating in the trial will also be more than ten times that of the first phase. In addition, the State Drug Administration will also send someone down to review the trial. In order to prepare for the second phase of the experiment, the pharmaceutical factory has to increase production. At the same time, they have to deal with the National and provincial Drug Administration. He’s almost living in the pharmaceutical factory now!”

“Give him a bonus!” Xia ruofei said,”also, recruit some professionals to help Xue Jinshan with his work.”

“Alright!” Feng Jing continued,”in addition, we’ve already mobilized the villagers in the nearby villages to plant the herbs we need. The company has signed a buyback agreement with them and sent people to give them technical guidance. The villagers have already started to plant Chinese herbs.”

“Alright!” Xia ruofei said happily,”when the Chinese herbs mature, we won’t be restricted by others in terms of raw materials.”

“Yup! However, considering the need for the second phase of clinical trials, and we estimate that the State Drug Administration will also take special measures for the second phase of clinical trials, the progress of the new drug approval process will be greatly accelerated. In order to be able to smoothly put into production in the near future, we think that we should purchase and store raw materials now. ” Feng Rao said,”otherwise, we’ll be in a mess.”

......

Xia ruofei suddenly thought of Xia Qing’s plantation in the spirit map space. He thought for a while and said,””President Feng, how about this? Let Xue Jinshan and the others calculate the initial production capacity and the number of raw materials needed after our new drug is approved for production. I can get in touch with a batch of high – Quality Chinese medicinal herbs. As for the missing portion, let Xue Jinshan and the others purchase it in advance!”

“Alright, I’ll immediately inform Xue Jinshan!” Feng ke said.

“By the way, Chairman, there’s one more thing.” Feng Jing said,”although our Yangxin soup is still in clinical trials, it’s already quite well – known in the industry. Two days ago, chief he kun of the provincial Drug Administration told me that the major leaders of the National Health and planning Commission are paying attention to our Yangxin soup. I heard that they even have the intention of listing it as a guided drug for the treatment of autism!”

Xia ruofei said happily,”that’s great!” This way, at least in the country, there would be more children with autism who would be recommended to use the heart – nourishing soup at first notice! This is really good news!”
