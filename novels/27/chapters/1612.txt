Chapter 1614: The Location of the Ancient God Mansion

Xiao Yan looked at Xiao Zhan, who was playing with Xiao Xiao within the courtyard. He smiled slightly as he heard the old and young laughter. Perhaps it was because there was a blood relation between them but after this period of familiarization, Xiao Xiao had clearly become a little familiar with this grandfather, who was a stranger. Her joyous manner completely did not treat him as an outsider.

“Teacher, is there any news of the Hun clan?” Xiao Yan turned his head around after glancing at the courtyard. He looked at Yao Lao under the stone pavilion and asked.

Yao Lao held the teacup and took a gently sip. Immediately, he frowned and nodded.

“Father has been monitoring the Hun clan realm during this period of time. However, there was no signs of a large group of people entering and leaving. There has been hardly anyone who had left the Hun clan alone. We have also completely cut off these Hun clan members who had appeared alone. However, we did not obtain any useful news.” Xun Er by the side softly said.

Xiao Yan also knitted his brow tightly. Logically speaking, the Hun clan should not be acting in such a calm fashion. They had been seeking the Tou She Ancient God Jade for thousands of years. Now that we have found it after much difficulty, how could we not hurry and open the Tuo She Ancient God Jade?

“Just what are these people doing...”

Xiao Yan softly sighed. At this moment, being anxious would not of be any help. All they could do was to wait for the Hun clan to take action. From the strength that the Hun clan had displayed back then, even if they were to launch a big campaign and attack the Hun realm, it would likely be a futile attempt. Moreover, if they were ambushed, the alliance army would definitely suffer a great loss.

Regardless of what the situation was, the Hun realm had been managed by the Hun clan for countless number of years. The latter would have the advantage of fighting in home territory. This was something that Xiao Yan and the rest were unwilling to see.

“We can only wait now...” Yao Lao placed his teacup down and sighed.

Xiao Yan smiled bitterly and nodded. They once again discussed about some matter before Xiao Yan finally lifted his head. He looked at the two figures, who had walked into the courtyard and involuntarily smiled as he stood up and welcome them.

“Big brother, second brother...”

One of the two figures who had entered had a somewhat stiffened footsteps while the other had strong footsteps. These two were Xiao Ding and Xiao Li, who had hurried over from the north-western region a short time ago.

The injuries of Xiao Ding’s leg had been treated by Xiao Yan during this period of time. The reason that his legs were unable to move back then was because of the poison from the Hun clan. With Xiao Yan’s current ability, it would not be difficult to change a leg for Xiao Ding, much less expelling poison.

The reason for Xiao Ding’s stiff footsteps was due to him not feeling being used to walking with his legs.

Xiao Ding duo grinned after seeing Xiao Yan walking over with a smile. They stepped forward and smashed their fist onto Xiao Yan’s chest. A deep bond between brothers was revealed within their eyes.

“Little fellow, back then I was still asking about why you are totally unconcerned about the Yan Alliance. It seems that this is because you possess an even more terrifying alliance on the Central Plains.” Xiao Ding laughingly said.

Xiao Yan was helpless. He did not really like to manage all these. He was forced by the circumstances when he established the Yan Alliance back then. It was his intention to create a faction that would be able to protect the Xiao clan from harm after he left. The Sky Mansion Alliance on the Central Plains, however, was established completely because he wanted to deal with the Hun clan. Otherwise, he would really not have the mood to organise some alliance.

“Is the situation at the Yan Alliance well? There isn’t anything wrong, is there?” Xiao Yan smilingly asked.

“Aye. That place is indeed considered a backcountry when compared to the Central Plains. Even the Hun clan did not extend its claws too far into it. The current Yan Alliance can be considered the overlord of the north-western part of the continent. Of course, there are also some other fellows who are watching it with ill intent.” Xiao Li continued to smile. Both of his eyes were shut. There was a glow glint flowing within them just like back then. In the current Yan Alliance, even some subordinates were afraid of this face of his and did not dare to lie in front of him.

“However, if those people were to learn that the chief of the Yan Alliance also have such an establishment in the Central Plains, it is likely that they will come submitting to us the next day.” Xiao Ding shook his head and laughed.

Xiao Yan also smiled. However, he was not really interested in this. Forget about the north-western region of the continent. With his current strength, there were hardly any factions or experts that he was interested in even in the Central Plains. He did not have the time to bother about these small fights.

“Oh, that’s right...” Xiao Li suddenly recalled something as he suddenly turned towards Xiao Yan and said, “A couple of days earlier, I have received word from the Xiao Gate. It seems that some unknown experts had appeared at the Black-Corner Region. Those fellows were very similar to those from the Hall of Soul, whom we had fought before.”

Xiao Yan was startled upon hearing this. He thought for a moment before recalling with a bitter laughter. It seemed that it was the Xiao Gate, which both he and Xiao Li had established at the Black-Corner Region back then. Now that he thought about it, it seemed that he had left behind a foundation in many places.

A person who did not specialise in management had ended up establishing so many factions. This was a little comical now that he thought about it.

“It could be some of the lingering forces of the Hun clan. The Hun clan also has some branch halls outside of the Central Plains. However, they are unimportant compared to those in the Central Plains.” Xiao Yan shook his head and spoke indifferently. He had received many news of the remnant forces of the Hall of Soul being discovered everyday. Hence, he did not really thought much about it.

“Aye.”

Xiao Li nodded after hearing Xiao Yan’s words. He said, “In that case, I shall send information to the Xiao Gate and the Jia Nan Academy to finish them off.”

“Jia Nan Academy...”

Xiao Yan smiled. He was about to nod his head when a light suddenly flashed across his mind. His body stiffened for a moment. In the next instant, he suddenly lifted his head. Both of his dark black eyes had light wildly flashing within them.

“The underground magma world!”

Xiao Yan suddenly cried out explosively, causing everyone within the courtyard to be startled. They hurriedly surrounded him.

“What is it?” Cai Lin knitted her brow and asked.

Xiao Yan’s expression was a little excited. He grabbed Cai Lin’s wirst and joyously said, “Do you still remember the underground magma world below the Jia Nan Academy’s Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower?

Cai Lin’s cold face immediately turned flush red after hearing his words. She stared at Xiao Yan in embarrassment and unceremoniously withdrew her hand from the latter’s grip. How could she not remember that place? It was at that place that Xiao Yan, who had gone crazy, had forced himself on her.

“Ugh? Cough...”

Xiao Yan recovered after Cai Lin pulled her hand from his with great force. He looked at Cai Lin, who was so embarrassed that she had the impulse to bite at him. He was startled for a moment before he seemed to have recalled something. After which, he quickly laughed in embarrassment towards the sky.

Xiao Yan calmed down after laughing dryly. A glow flashed across his eyes. The location of the Tou She Ancient God Mansion had always been a mystery. That Tou She Ancient God Jade did not show any mysterious signs all the time that it had been in his hand. If one wished to really insist that there was, it would be the strange reaction of the ancient jade when he was at that place.

That place was the underground magma world of the Jia Nan Academy!

At that place, the Tou She Ancient God had shown a strange reaction for the first and only time!

However, Xiao Yan had been chased by the strange creatures at that place until he was running around in panic. Naturally, he did not dare to investigate anything as he directly fled. Now that he thought about it, that magma world did indeed appear a little strange...

Perhaps it was possible to find out some information related to the Tou She Ancient God Mansion at that place.

“Teacher, find ten elite Dou Sheng from the alliance army to follow me. Xun Er, Cai Lin, the both of you should also leave with me.” Xiao Yan did not hesitate even a little after he thought of this. He immediately spoke in a decisive manner.

“Ugh? Where?”

Everyone were startled after hearing Xiao Yan’s sudden order.

“The Jia Nan Academy. If I guess correctly, that place will likely have clues to the Tou She Ancient God Mansion.” Xiao Yan spoke in a deep voice.

Yao Lao and the rest had a change in expression upon hearing this.

“Coincidentally, we have built a wormhole that connects to the north-western region back then. I will lead some people over. Teacher, report this matter to uncle Gu, clan head Lei Ying and Yan Jin.

“Aye.” Yao Lao nodded. If it was really as Xiao Yan had said, this would really be a big matter.

“However, I am also not very certain about this. Hence, tell uncle Gu not to ease up on the monitoring. Once he discover a large group of Hun clan experts, all of you should also hurry to the Black-Corner Region!” Xiao Yan quickly said.

“Relax.”

After seeing Xiao Yan complete issuing his instructions, Xiao Yan briefly said goodbye to Xiao Zhan before leading Cai Lin and Xun Er to hurriedly leave.

Yao Lao swiftly turned his head in a grave fashion and walked towards the Meeting Room after seeing the backs of the trio leave.

Hun realm.

Hun Tiandi sat on the leader’s seat within a large hall that had a black flame burning within it. He looked down towards all the bowing human figures below and asked indifferently, “Is there any news.”

“Replying to clan head, after our investigation during this period of time, we have found five areas that are similar to the places described on the map. After some careful observation, we have discovered that there is one place which has the greatest similarity!” A black haired old man respectfully replied.

“Oh?”

Hun Tiandi’s indifferent eyes finally brightened after hearing this. He smilingly looked at the person below and said, “Continue.”

“That location is called the Black-Corner Region. Although there are currently many factions present in that place, the general terrain is completely the same as that on the map.” The old man replied.

“Black-Corner Region...”

Hun Tiandi slowly stood up. His eyes swept over the hall as he said, “Which group is the closest to that place?”

“Clan head, Elder Hun You seems to be in that region. He is the person-in-charge of the Hall of Soul outside of the Central Plains.” A person replied.

“Give him an order to lead all the members of the Hall of Soul outside to hurry to the Black-Corner Region. Completely eliminate that place. He should understand what to do.” Hun Tiandi replied in a faint voice.

“Understood!”

The black clothed old man below immediately replied in a respectful manner and slowly withdrew.

Hun Tiandi lifted his head after seeing the old man disappear. The smile on the corner of his mouth widened. After which, it turned into a loud laughter that resounded within the hall.

“I have finally found you, Ancient God Mansion!”
