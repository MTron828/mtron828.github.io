Chapter 144: Killing a Nine Star Dou Zhe

The overly arrogant Gan Mu had, in an instant, turned into someone who was randomly stepped on by someone else’s foot. This hundred and eighty degree change caused not only Ka Gang and the others to stare in shock but also resulted in the subordinates behind Gan Mu to reveal stunned expressions.

On the spacious road, numerous passersby blankly stared at the Gan Mu who was under Xiao Yan’s foot and could not recover their thoughts. In a moment the noisy road had become deadly silent.

A long while later, Ka Gang and his group finally recovered. They eyed Gan Mu who was pressed tightly under Xiao Yan’s foot and exchanged glances with each other. Was this the same two star Dou Zhe from before? From the explosive speed and strength that he displayed, this young man’s frightening strength would not be weaker than that of Gan Mu’s nine star Dou Zhe.

“Uh, it looks like we were all mistaken.” Shaking his head, Ka Gang bitterly smiled as he sighed. Looks like that young man was hiding his strength.

Hiding behind Ka Gang’s body, Ling Er was also shocked by this sudden change. Her eyes stared at the young man who easily held Gan Mu, whom even her father could not defeat, under his foot. She did not expect that the young man who she repeatedly mocked for an entire day would have such great strength.

Recalling her attitude toward him, a self-mocking smile surfaced on Ling Er’s pretty face for the first time. No wonder he pretended to be deaf to her words regardless of how she ridiculed him. Perhaps in his heart, she was like a clown performing her own show.

Sighing in her heart, the young girl watched Gan Mu whose chest was being stepped on by the young man. Under the morning sunlight, the young man’s figure appeared very tall and the warm smile on his face suggested that he was not hitting someone but rather having a cordial conversation with his good friend.

Ling Er stared at the young man before abruptly tilting her head and eying the white-clothed Mu Lan beside her. She suddenly found that the worshipful feeling she had for him in her heart had diminished greatly.

“*Cough*, *cough*...” An intense cough accompanied by some blood was spat out from Gan Mu’s mouth. Only then did his mind finally wake from his confused state. With wide eyes, he glared at the young man above him and hissed, “Little Bastard, do you damn well know who I am?”

“The Second Company Leader of the Wolf Head Mercenary Company?” Nodding his head, Xiao Yan answered with a smile, “Sorry but I have come because I know about your identity.”

Gan Mu’s eyes slightly shrunk as he stared intently at this smiling delicate and handsome face. A moment later, a thought struck him. The young man’s face from a few months ago was gradually merging with the that of the person in front of him. Instantly, his aghast voice cried out involuntarily, “You are Xiao Yan? Weren’t you chased into the inner regions of the Magic Beast Mountain Range? Why are you still alive?”

When Gan Mu’s words left his mouth, the surrounding people’s voices exploded into an uproar. Back then, the Wolf Head Mercenary Company used all of their strength to chase the young man called Xiao Yan into the inner regions of the Magic Beast Mountain Range in an attempt to kill him. Unexpectedly, the young man managed to walk out alive from the inner regions of the mountain range, which was also known as a death zone.

“Xiao Yan? He’s actually the Xiao Yan who has caused an upheaval in the Wolf Head Mercenary Company?” On one side, Ka Gang’s face was filled with shock. For him and his group to be able to walk alongside this well known rumored person in the Magic Beast Mountain Range was something entirely unanticipated.

“Kill him!” Having been publicly humiliated, Gan Mu’s face grew increasingly menacing. Upon his explosive order, his subordinates hurriedly took out their weapons while wearing fierce expressions and charged at Xiao Yan in an attempt to kill him. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At the same time, a pale green Dou Qi quickly rose from Gan Mu’s body. His fists slowly transformed into the color of withering wood and with a low cry, smashed toward Xiao Yan’s calf.

“Exploding Steps!” Following Xiao Yan’s call in his heart, a faint yellow energy swiftly formed on Xiao Yan’s feet and he quickly stomped on Gan Mu’s chest. Xiao Yan’s body then shot toward the few mercenaries who were riding their horses over.

“Grug!” The explosive force from the Exploding Steps released a loud blast on Gan Mu’s chest. The surging force directly caused him to spit out another mouthful of fresh blood. Gan Mu shakingly stood up afterwards and pulled a steel rod off of his back. Grinding his teeth in anger, he charged at Xiao Yan.

Xiao Yan, who had shot out like the wind, bypassed the defenses of the few guards in an instant. Grabbing the hilt of the Heavy Xuan Ruler with his right hand, Xiao Yan suddenly drew it, releasing it from the confines of the black cloth. The huge ruler’s body smashed horizontally outwards, instantly causing the few mercenaries to be simultaneously knocked to the ground and cough up blood.

In approximately the time taken for two to three exchanges, Xiao Yan easily defeated the few mercenaries with the strengths of five star Dou Zhes. He then slowly turned around and watched Gan Mu charging at him with a metal rod in his hands and a pale green color Dou Qi covering his body.

Carrying the Heavy Xuan Ruler with his right hand, Xiao Yan paused for a moment before his feet once again violently stomped on the ground. With an explosive sound, Xiao Yan’s body shot forward and was in front of Gan Mu in the blink of an eye. He slightly tightened his grip on the Heavy Xuan Ruler and, with an extremely ferocious force, ruthlessly hacked at Gan Mu.

The sharp force of the wind breaking caused Gan Mu’s white face to turn even uglier. Unable to avoid the attack, he hurriedly held his metal rod tightly and allowed the Dou Qi in his body to surge forth before meeting the blow.

“Bang!” The sound of two metal objects colliding sounded on the road, attracting everyone’s attention.

Almost instantly after the metal rod and the heavy ruler collided, the enormous energy on them caused Gan Mu’s body to sink down to the point where the back of his feet sunk were in the ground.

“Break!” Seeing Gan Mu biting his lips and enduring, Xiao Yan let out a cold laughter. He released another bit of Dou Qi from his body and poured it into the pitch-black Heavy Xuan Ruler.

“Crack..” With the increased strength of the Heavy Black Ruler, a couple of crack lines slowly appeared on the metal rod in Gan Mu’s hand. A moment later, the crack lines swiftly expanded and the metal rod finally broke with a clear sound.

Seeing that his weapon was forcefully broken by his opponent, a horrified expression surfaced on Gan Mu’s face. His body formed a strange curve and his legs hurriedly stepped back.

“Clang!” After breaking the metal rod, the Heavy Xuan Ruler continued to hack downwards and cleaved a deep scar in the ground.

Xiao Yan raised his eyes as he saw Gan Mu avoiding the attack. His feet once again violently stepped on the ground. With an explosive sound, his body appeared behind the retreating Gan Mu’s back like a flash of lightning. He smiled, pulled his right leg back and heavily threw a kick that carried a violent force onto Gan Mu’s back.

“Grug.”

Having once again received another heavy blow, Gan Mu’s originally white face turned much paler. Another mouthful of blood was violently spat out. Like a gourd, his body rolled on the ground for over ten meters and was in an extremely terrible state.

On the main road, everyone who was watching Gan Mu getting beaten by Xiao Yan secretly took in a breath of cold air. Gan Mu being beaten earlier could be explained with him being caught off guard. However, this chain of direct confrontation had let everyone know that the strength of this young man who appeared fairly young was above that of Gan Mu.

“He can actually defeat a nine star Dou Zhe at such a young age? In the future, just how strong will he be? What a frightening talent. The Wolf Head Mercenary Company is really unlucky to mess with such a person.” Upon seeing the decisive matter of Xiao Yan’s fight, everyone could not help but sigh with envy in their hearts.

After rolling on the ground like a gourd for over ten rotations, Gan Mu finally climbed back onto his feet. He eyed the mocking gazes around him and his eyes involuntarily turned red. Lifting his head, he stared at the young man carrying the heavy ruler with a hateful and menacing face that caused others to shudder.

“Little Bastard. If you end up in my hands, I will make you suffer a fate worst than death!” Gan Mu’s hoarse voice coldly said.

“I don’t think you will have the chance to leave this place alive.” Xiao Yan smiled. His eyes were also filled with the same dark and icy killing intent. If he was able to kill a nine star Dou Zhe, it would be a significant blow toward the Wolf Head Mercenary Company. Regardless of what happens, he would definitely not allow this guy to return alive.

Gan Mu coldly sneered but his heart was a little uneasy. The strength that Xiao Yan had displayed earlier had smashed his arrogance into pieces. He glanced at his surroundings and when the corner of his eye landed on Ling Er who was only a short distance from him, a sinister smile surfaced on the corner of his mouth. From awhile back, it appeared that Xiao Yan was together with Ka Gang’s group and it was likely that they knew each other. If he wanted to escape from Xiao Yan, he needed to think of some less-than-honest methods.

When his thought reached this point, Gan Mu moved his body and suddenly rushed toward Ka Gang’s group.

The moment Gan Mu’s body moved, Ka Gang’s group immediately realized that something was amiss. However, Gan Mu’s speed was something none of them could compare with. Just as they had readied their defense, Gan Mu’s body abruptly turned and rushed towards the inexperienced Ling Er.

“Ling Er, be careful!” Ka Gang hurriedly called when he noticed Gan Mu abruptly changing direction.

Only after hearing his call did Ling Er turn her dull gaze away from Xiao Yan. When she saw Gan Mu menacingly pouncing toward her, her small face was filled with panic. Her body, however, appeared to have solidified and was unable to move.

“Little Ling Er, ha ha. Let’s go. Come and play with uncle.” Seeing the panicked expression on the young girl’s face, the licentiousness in Gan Mu’s heart surged as he laughed lewdly.

Ling Er fell backwards onto the ground in fear when she saw that Gan Mu was in her immediate vicinity. Her pale face continued to shiver; she knew well of the fate that awaited the girls that Gan Mu had caught.

Witnessing the young girl’s fear, Gan Mu became even more excited. As he prepared to grab her, however, a young man carrying a heavy ruler appeared like a ghost in front of the young girl.

Lifting his eyes, Xiao Yan shook his head slightly and said softly, “The Wolf Head Mercenary Company is indeed filled with trash.” With that statement, Xiao Yan tightened his grip on the Heavy Xuan Ruler and filled it with a ferocious energy. It turned into a black shadow and quickly swung horizontally outward.

“Bang!” Under Gan Mu’s horrified eyes, the ruler mercilessly smashed into his chest. Instantly, his eyes protruded slightly and his chest caved inwards. A few mouthfuls of blood and crushed internal organs were vomited from his mouth while his body was thrown backwards and came to a gradual stop after breaking two to three trees.

A chillness appeared in all the witnesses’ hearts as they watched Gan Mu slowly turning lifeless as he laid under a tree.

After glancing at the corpse indifferently, Xiao Yan rotated his hand and placed the ruler back behind him. He bade Ka Gang goodbye without turning around to look at the frightened young girl on the ground and slowly started walking toward Qingshan Town.

Eyeing the back of the young man carrying the black colored heavy ruler who was disappearing in the horizon, Ling Er, who sat frozen on the ground, said in a soft quivering voice, “I..I’m sorry.”
