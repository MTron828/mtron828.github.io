Chapter 1500: Demonic Flame Realm

“Xiao Yan ge-ge, you should ask anyone in this group of yours who does not possess the strength of a Ban Sheng to leave. Numbers are not important in trying to subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.” Xun Er turned her head and spoke to Xiao Yan after seeing many human figures rush into that shattered space like a swarm of locusts.

“Aye.”

Xiao Yan nodded. Although these elite individuals from the alliance could be considered top tier experts, many of them were covered in perspiration just outside of this realm. Some of them even had to unleash their Dou Qi to resist the high temperature. If they were to recklessly charge into that space, less than ten of them would make it out alive.

“All of you should head back to the alliance first and guard it well!” Yao Lao turned around and cried out in a deep voice.

“Understood!” Upon hearing this, many experts from the alliance immediately sighed in relief, appearing as though they had been relieved of a great burden. They hurriedly replied before withdrawing in a quick and orderly formation. Although it was somewhat regretful that they wouldn’t enter the realm and catch a glimpse of the demonic flame, it was better to be regretful than to lose one’s life. With their strength, they were clearly aware of their chances of survival if they were to barge into the extremely dangerous space.

“Ha ha, brother Xiao Yan, we will enter first!”

Huo Xuan faced Xiao Yan and cupped his hands together from a short distance away. After which, he moved with Elder Huo Yao, who was leading the group. Their group took the lead to hurry into that cream-white light cluster. Finally, they disappeared.

“We should also get moving...” Xiao Yan clenched his hand and smiled in a somewhat anxious manner after seeing those experts from the ancient clans rush into the light circle.

“Xiao Yan ge-ge, it is rumored that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame uses a person’s emotion as a source to form the demonic flame within one’s body. The moment the demonic flame appears in one’s body, even one’s soul will be incinerated into nothing. Hence, regardless of what you see after entering the space, you must try your best to remain calm without feeling any joy or sadness. You must try to control all emotions. Otherwise, these emotions will attract the demonic flame!” Xun Er nodded and reminded everyone in a solemn voice.

“Oh?” The expressions of Xiao Yan and Yao Lao changed upon hearing this rumor. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was far too mysterious. Even they, as alchemists, did not really know many details about it. It was unexpected that this Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was able to use human emotions as a seed. Such a mysterious method was indeed worthy of its demonic flame reputation.

“Understood. Everyone should be careful. Let’s get moving!”

Xiao Yan slowly exhaled and ceased uttering any other unnecessary words. He waved his sleeve and his body took the lead to charge forward. He turned into a ray of light that rushed into the light circle with lightning-like speed. Xun Er and the rest followed close behind him.

Xiao Yan’s skin suddenly became dry as he charged into the cluster of light. Passing through the light circle was an instantaneous task. After his eyes were momentarily dazzled by the light, he discovered that the surrounding space had changed

“What a terrifying temperature...”

The first impression that the transformed space gave Xiao Yan was that it was like a furnace. His eyes swiftly swept around him, only to discover that he was currently in a mysterious space with a cream-white flames all around. Even someone like him, who had swallowed five types of Heavenly Flames, felt unusually hot in this place covered by cream-white flames. This heat was emitted by the cream-white flames.

A thought passed through Xiao Yan’s heart as the Heavenly Flame within his body slowly surged out of him before wrapping around his entire body. Only then did the heat that caused one’s blood to boil significantly weaken.

“Is this the realm where the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is sealed? Where is Xun Er and the rest?”

Xiao Yan frowned as he looked at his empty surroundings. He should have entered this realm with Xun Er and the rest. Why was it that he was the only one in this place?

Xiao Yan tightly knit his brow. His body was suspended in the air and did not dare to make even the slightest contact with the cream-white flames. These flames might not be the actual body of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, but one should still not underestimate them. Moreover, this entire space was filled with mystery. This calmness hid a murderous intent, so it was always best to be a little careful.

“I should leave this place first...” Xiao Yan’s eyes swept around him. His toes pressed on empty space. Only then did his body shoot forward. This area made him somewhat uneasy, but first, he needed to find the others.

Xiao Yan’s body swiftly rushed through the sea of fire. The high temperature that saturated the space caused his skin to emit waves of piercing pain despite having the protection of his Heavenly Flame. Even the air in this realm was steaming. An indescribable desolation covered the entire land.

“Chi!”

Xiao Yan flew forward for nearly ten minutes, but his expression gradually became ugly as he continued to fly. There was still no end to the sea of fire even after this ten minute journey, and he had not come across any other human figures. It was as though this sea of fire was endless.

“Just how large is this realm? Could it be that we have been sent to a different area when we entered this space? However, I did not seem to feel any sign of being sent anywhere when I enter...” Xiao Yan tightly knit his brows. His face was filled with his thoughts and an expression of loss.

“There is a voice in front!”

A soft voice was suddenly emitted from a short distance in front of Xiao Yan while he was thinking things over. He immediately felt a slight joy in his heart. His body moved as he hurried forward, but he had just traveled for some distance when he suddenly stopped. At this moment, there were three black figures standing in the air a short distance in front of him. Their eyes revealed sinister expressions that were filled with a ridicule while they looked at him.

“Chief of the Hall of Souls.”

The three black figures were the Hall of Souls trio from outside. It was unexpected that they would actually appear in this place. Moreover, from the looks of their appearances, it seemed that they had been waiting for Xiao Yan!

“Why are all of you here?” Xiao Yan demanded in a deep voice as he stared at the three of them. The Dou Qi within his body quietly began to circulate as he asked.

“Nothing. We are here to let you have a look at something...” The chief of the Hall of Souls slightly smiled. Waves of black fog suddenly surged out of his palm. The black fog churnrd before turning into a somewhat illusory figure. Xiao Yan felt as though he was struck by lightning as he looked at the figure. He muttered, “Father?”

Xiao Zhan!

The person who had been pulled out by the chief of the Hall of Souls was surprisingly Xiao Zhan. However, Xiao Zhan was only a spiritual body!

“Yan-er?”

Xiao Zhan’s body trembled after hearing Xiao Yan’s voice. He lifted his head, and his eyes looked at the skinny young man with disbelief.

“Xiao Yan, there is only one fate for opposing our Hall of Souls. The destruction of your clan!”

An indifferent smile was lifted on the face of the chief of the Hall of Souls. His hand slowly landed on Xiao Zhan’s head as he said in a faint voice, “Since we are about to capture you, there is no use for him to continue living...”

“Stop!”

Xiao Yan’s eyes suddenly turned blood-red after hearing the chief of the Hall of Souls voice.

The chief of the Hall of Souls coldly laughed when he heard Xiao Yan’s roar. He clenched his hand and Xiao Zhan’s soul was forcefully shattered. It turned into light particles that scattered apart before they vanished because of the terrifyingly high temperature.

Xiao Yan was dull as he watched the light spots disappear. His body trembled. A terrifying murderous intent wildly swept out from deep within his heart!

A strange smile was lifted on the face of the chief of the Hall of Souls after having sensed that wild murderous intent in Xiao Yan’s heart.

“Puff!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Both of Xiao Yan’s eyes turned blood-red. His breathing became as heavy as a bull while he stared intently at the chief of the Hall of Souls. He took a step forward. However, his body stilled immediately as his foot landed. Waves of cream white flames suddenly erupted from a countless number of pores around his body. The terrifying flame started to wildly raged within his body.

“Demonic flame?”

The sudden intense pain emitted from within Xiao Yan’s body caused him to regain his sense of reasoning. His heart was immediately startled as he hurriedly lifted his head, only to realize that the Hall of Souls trio had vanished.

“This is bad. I have been tricked. Everything here is an illusion to stir one’s emotion!”

This scene caused Xiao Yan to feel startled. He suddenly recovered and finally understood the strangeness of the whole situation!

“The Demonic Flame might be powerful, but no one is in control of it. It isn’t so easy to incinerate me!”

Xiao Yan clenched his teeth. His hand seal was rapidly changed as his new Heavenly Flame, which hsd been formed from the merger of the five types of Heavenly Flames, began to circulate. It wildly spread to every part of his body. The cream-white flames endured for a moment before beginning to be forced back in defeat an inch at a time because of the fierce retaliation from the Heavenly Flame within Xiao Yan’s body. Finally, the flames were forced out of Xiao Yan’s countless pores.

Xiao Yan only sighed in relief after the cream-white flames were forced out of his body. He was covered in perspiration. It was fortunate that his resistance to fire was quite high and that his physical body was strong. Otherwise, this trick would have caused the meridians in his body to turn to dust.

“It is indeed worthy of being the demonic flame. The illusion it creates is not inferior to that of the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree...”

Xiao Yan rubbed his cold sweat away. A thought passed through his heart as the Heavenly Flame within his body quickly covered his eyes. After the flame surged up, the world in front of him immediately began to change. The cream-white sea of fire vanished. A cream-white fog that was around a hundred feet in size replaced it. At this moment, there were dozens of people swiftly flying in the same spot within this fog. The bodies of some of these people had already been surrounded by a cream-white flames. Finally, they turned into ashes amid a miserable screech.

Xiao Yan’s eyes swiftly swept over this cream-white fog. After which, he understood that those illusions should be caused by this mysterious fog.

“Teacher?”

After having swept his eyes around, Xiao Yan paused them on an elderly figure a short distance in front of him. This figure was Yao Lao, but Yao Lao’s face was filled with pain. Vague cream-white fire seedlings had even surfaced on his body. Clearly, this was the prelude to being incinerated by the demonic flame!
