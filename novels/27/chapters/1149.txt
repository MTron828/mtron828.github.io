Chapter 1150: Old Mu Gu

This sudden unexpected change also surprised Xiao Yan. His eyes swiftly looked to the night sky above his head. However, it was completely empty. There was not a single person there. However, the vast, mighty aura spreading down caused him to feel some fear...

“It’s someone from the Pill Tower...”

Xiao Yan sighed in relief within his heart. The Extermination Fire Lotus he was merging quickly paused before he carefully scattered it. His toes pressed on the ground, and he swiftly pulled back. A clear long roar was also emitted.

Swoosh swoosh!

The clear roar had just sounded when two figures rushed over to the courtyard as fast as lightning. They had appeared beside Xiao Yan in an instant. At the same time, their eyes were furiously looking at the mysterious, black-robed person in the air.

“Are you alright?” The Little Fairy Doctor glanced at the messy courtyard. Her grayish-purple eyes stared at the black-robed person in an icy manner while her mouth asked a question full of concern.

Xiao Yan shook his head and he replied with a deep voice, “I’m alright. Be careful. This fellow is not an ordinary person...”

Tian Huo zun-zhe’s face was a little ugly as he stared at the mysterious, black-robed person. He said with a cold smile, “You are an elite Dou Zun no matter how one puts it. Why are you sneaking about?”

At this moment, the hearts of the Little Fairy Doctor and Tian Huo zun-zhe were undoubtedly furious. From the looks of the courtyard, it was obvious that it had just experienced a big battle. Moreover, the two of them did not sense a thing. The poor protection they provided would really cause one to feel ashamed.

The mysterious, black-robed man remained suspended in the air. His sinister gaze flickered as he glanced at Xiao Yan. It was unexpected that the old fellows from the Pill Tower had managed to discover him despite him being so careful. His trace had already been locked onto by them. If he continued to stay any longer, it was likely that the experts from the Pill Tower would make it here soon...

“Xuan Kong Zi, this matter has nothing to do with your Pill Tower. Why must you bother in other people’s business?” The black-robed person cried out to the sky in a dark voice.

“Ke ke, this is Holy Pill City. If your Hall of Souls can randomly act atrociously in this place, how will my Pill Tower account to the public?” The voice filled with a vicissitude slowly resonated from the sky. This time around, Xiao Yan could sense that this voice was emitted from empty space. Clearly, the person who had spoken had yet to arrive here. Instead, he was using a mysterious method to deliver his aura and deter this mysterious, black-robed person.

“Old bastard...” The black-robed person clenched his teeth and softly cursed. After which, his dark, sinister eyes turned to Xiao Yan. He coldly said, “Consider yourself lucky. The Heavenly Flames and the Qi Method shall remain with you a little longer. Remember, I will take them back sooner or later!”

The space behind him instantly distorted after he spoke. His figure became partially visible because of the distorted space.

“You wish to leave?”

The Little Fairy Doctor’s eyes turned chilly when she saw this. A gray Dou Qi lingered on her hand before suddenly transforming into a grayish pillar that quickly shot through the air, rushing toward the black-robed person.

“Hee hee, with the two of them protecting you, I am indeed unable to do anything to you. However, you will also not be able to stop me if I wish to leave!” The black-robed man let out a cold laugh when he saw the Little Fairy Doctor attempt to stop him. He flicked his finger and a wisp of a deep-blue flame shot out of his finger. After which, it violently collided with her grayish Dou Qi. Both of them destroyed each other.

“Xiao Yan, I will come and look for you again. I will definitely take your Heavenly Flames and your Qi Method the next time we meet...”

A pair of dense eyes stared at Xiao Yan from under the black robe after that person easily blocked the Little Fairy Doctor’s Woeful Poison Dou Qi. Immediately, the figure moved his body and entered the distorted space. The space rippled and his body disappeared.

“I will await you...”

Xiao Yan’s dark-black eyes were scary. He could sense that this person was quite strong. However, if they were to engage in an all out fight, Xiao Yan had the confidence that the other party would not be left in good shape.

“Dammit!”

The Little Fairy Doctor involuntarily clenched her silver teeth and softly cursed after watching the black-robed person safely leave.

“Forget it...” Xiao Yan waved his hand. After which, he turned his eyes to the sky, cupped his hands together, and respectfully said, “Thank you elder for lending a hand!”

The light of the stars in the sky suddenly agglomerated after Xiao Yan’s voice sounded. The light transformed into a blurry, elderly light figure. The old voice filled with vicissitude was slowly emitted, “The old me cannot step away. The old me can only split my attention and act as a deterrence. This person is extremely mysterious. You should be more careful. If you have the time, you can come to the Pill Tower. You will be very safe there...”

“Thank you elder...”

Xiao Yan once again cupped his hands together. This elderly light figure should be an expert from the Pill Tower. He might even be one of the legendary three great heads...

“I will naturally need to take good care of the disciple of an old friend. Be careful of the Profound Xuan Sect. They were the ones who revealed information about you to that person earlier...”

The elderly light figure faintly smiled. After which, the star light fluctuated and slowly scattered...

Xiao Yan contemplated the situation as he studied the spot where the figure made of star light had disappeared. It seemed that his teacher’s relationship with these people from the Pill Tower was quite good...

“Who is the one who attacked you earlier?” The Little Fairy Doctor turned her head, looked at Xiao Yan, and asked a question with knit eyebrows.

“Someone from the Hall of Souls...” A cold glint flashed across his eyes as he softly replied.

“This person’s Spiritual Strength has reached the pinnacle. The Spiritual Lock that he used from such a close proximity deceived the Little Fairy Doctor and me...” Tian Huo zun-zhe spoke with a solemn face.

Xiao Yan nodded. He did not manage to see the appearance of the black-robed person since the very beginning. Moreover, the voice he had heard did not appear too old, yet based on what he had said, this person was an expert from the same generation as Yao Lao. According to common sense, he should also be one of those old men who would not die...

“His strength should be a little stronger than mine. However, if we were to go all out, he might not be able to defeat me...” The Little Fairy Doctor parted the black hair in front of her forehead as she said, “However, this Profound Xuan Sect is really a source of trouble...”

Xiao Yan’s expression was a little cold. He had forgotten about the conflict he had with that group of people a couple of days back. Most of the people from the Profound Xuan Sect were people who would take revenge for any offense. It was impossible for them to simply leave things be. However, it was unexpected that they did not act personally. Instead, they had leaked information about him. Using others to kill him. This tactic was really ruthless...

“Tomorrow, try to think of a way to learn the location of the people from the Profound Xuan Sect. Being tracked by others with ill intent is not good. This trouble needs to be resolved... regardless of what kind of background they have. Since they have already climbed above my head, it is only natural that we cannot sit back and do nothing.” Xiao Yan slowly said.

The Little Fairy Doctor nodded. The people from the Profound Xuan Sect had come swinging at them. They could only blame themselves for being merciless.

“The one who has me the most worried is that black-robed person from earlier. We are unclear about his background...” Xiao Yan’s eyes slightly flickered. A moment later, his eyes coagulated, “The Sea Heart Flame is also in the hands of this person... perhaps Han Feng knows a little information related to him.”

Xiao Yan suddenly clenched his hand when this thought flashed across his heart. A jade bottle appeared in his hand. His finger rubbed over the mouth of the bottle before emitting a suction force. An illusionary spiritual body rose up in an extremely weak manner. From the appearance of the spiritual figure, it was Han Feng.

“Who in the Hall of Souls did you gift your Sea Heart Flame to?” Xiao Yan glanced at this extremely weak Han Feng and asked with an icy voice. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Han Feng was initially startled upon hearing Xiao Yan’s question. Immediately, his eyes flickered. However, before he could say anything, an invisible flame rose on the tip of Xiao Yan’s finger. It pierced toward the illusionary body lightning quick.

“Don’t, don’t... I will speak. I will speak...” Han Feng hurriedly cried out in shock upon seeing Xiao Yan’s vicious, unhesitating tactic.

“The one who took my Sea Heart Flame is an honorable elder in the Hall of Souls. People call him Old Mu Gu. His position in the Hall of Souls is quite high because he is a genuine tier 8 alchemist on top of being a Dou Zun, and he is much valued by the hall chief of the Hall of Souls...”

“Old Mu Gu...” Xiao Yan uttered this name softly in his mouth. The coldness in his eyes became denser. It was indeed those bastards from the Hall of Souls.

“Old Mu Gu has an extremely deep, old grudge with Yao Chen. It is rumored that the both of them had the same teacher. However, due to some reason, Old Mu Gu was expelled. Therefore, he views Yao Chen with great enmity. He will find any opportunity to make trouble with Yao Chen. Back then... back then, I was played by him when I attacked Yao Chen. He wanted me to quietly steal the Flame Mantra...” Han Feng carefully revealed.

“What?”

Xiao Yan’s expression involuntarily changed when he heard his words. This Old Mu Gu once had the same teacher as Yao Chen?

“Why is it that I have never heard teacher mention this?” Xiao Yan asked in a deep voice.

“I have also never heard him mention it. This matter is something that Old Mu Gu occasionally mentioned to me...” Han Feng hurriedly replied, afraid that Xiao Yan would attack him.

Xiao Yan slowly nodded. If Han Feng’s words were true, that mysterious, black-robed person from earlier should be Old Mu Gu. After all, there were very few people who knew about the Flame Mantra. Even some of those close to Xiao Yan were unaware of it...

“This person will never give up in order to get what he wants. He will definitely try his best to strike again. However, he would not dare to openly attack me with the strength currently beside me. There shouldn’t be an issue if we are careful in the future...”

“The Pill Gathering is about to begin. Right now, the plan is to get into the top ten of the Pill Gathering and obtain the Three Thousand Burning Flame. At that time, I will no longer need to fear this old fellow even if I have to fight him alone the next time we meet...”

Xiao Yan’s eyes twinkled. A moment later, he finally made up his mind. With a wave of his hand, he returned Han Feng’s soul into the jade bottle and threw it into his Storage Ring. After which, he turned around and walked into his room.

“Find information on those people from the Profound Xuan Sect tomorrow. Once is too many when it comes to such a thing...”

The Little Fairy Doctor slowly nodded when she heard Xiao Yan’s words filled with killing intent. She was aware that Xiao Yan had been truly angered this time around...
