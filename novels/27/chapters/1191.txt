Chapter 1192: Two Opposing Women

After discussing some matters regarding the opening of the star region with everyone gathered, Xiao Yan’s group left the large hall.

Xiao Yan did not remain for long after having left the large hall. He turned around and walked toward a path. However, his feet had just stepped forward when a graceful figure appeared in front of him accompanied by a fragrance. Xiao Yan was startled before he immediately laughed, “Why? Does Miss Cao Ying have some matters?”

“Nothing. I am incidentally using the same path. Let’s leave together.” Cao Ying sweetly smiled. Her exquisite face revealed an alluring enchantment. This woman was just like a fox demon that could bring calamity to a country and its people. Her smiles and frowns were enough to cause a man to go crazy over her.

Xiao Yan was stunned when he heard her invitation. Since when did this witch treat him so well? In the past, she earnestly wished for him to come into conflict with others while she stood by the side and watched the show.

While Xiao Yan was pondering what was happening in his heart, the expression of Song Qing slightly worsened. Cao Ying’s change had caused him to feel uneasy. He hurriedly came forward and laughed, “Ying-er, brother Xiao Yan always has many things to deal with. Coincidentally, the star region will be opened in two days. At that time, that old bastard Old Mu Gu might launch a sneak attack again. If we train now, we might be able to guard against him when the time comes.”

“Yes, brother Song words are quite...” Xiao Yan hurriedly nodded upon hearing them. He kind of feared this witch Cao Ying. He did not wish to be toyed with by her Since Song Qing had stepped forward, he would hurriedly push her to him.

However, before Xiao Yan’s words had finished, the enchanting smile on Cao Ying’s face was withdrawn. She faintly declared, “There is no need. I do not wish to be left behind as a sacrifice again.”

Song Qing was somber when he heard Cao Ying’s words. His expression had become unusually embarrassed.

“Let’s go...”

Cao Ying’s pretty eyes turned to Xiao Yan. She violently looked at him. From her looks, it seemed that this witch would go crazy if Xiao Yan were to utter any more excuses.

Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He threw a pitiful gaze to Song Qing. Although Song Qing’s actions of leaving his companion behind at a critical moment were indeed shameless, the treatment that he had currently received was also quite pitiful.

Xiao Yan quietly sighed in his heart. He could only turn around and walk to the stairs that led to the bottom of the Pill Tower. Only then did Cao Ying smile. After which, she closely followed behind him. Her crisp and soft laughter caused one to feel one’s bones softening.

Song Qing’s expression was volatile as he watched the backs of these two people disappear into the distance. He violently clenched his teeth a moment later. His face was dark, solemn as he swung his sleeves and left.

....

Xiao Yan and Cao Ying walked all the way down. She continued to softly inquire about unimportant matter. Her alluring manners of occasionally covering her mouth and laughing softly would cause some young alchemists to involuntarily halt their footsteps. Their eyes contained some envy when they looked at Xiao Yan.

These envious gazes cause Xiao Yan to feel as though he was sitting on needles. This witch was unpredictable. No one knew just what she was thinking. Even Xiao Yan himself wasn’t sure why she had suddenly become so gentle to him. Could it be because he had saved her life back in the Pill Realm?

This short journey appeared just like a long march to Xiao Yan. He only let out a long sigh of relief when he was about to arrive at his residence after much difficulty.

Xiao Yan stood in the corridor outside of the room. He was planning to open his mouth and say his goodbye when the door to the room suddenly opened with a creaking sound. Immediately, a white figure slowly stepped out. Surprise expression flashed across her ethereal eyes when she saw that Xiao Yan was together with Cao Ying.

“Little Fairy Doctor.”

Xiao Yan’s heart felt a slight joy when he saw who had appeared. He hurriedly called out to her before swiftly walking forward.

Cao Ying’s eyes also paused on the Little Fairy Doctor after she had appeared. Her picture-like eyebrows were gently lifted.

Although the Little Fairy Doctor’s appearance was not as enchanting as Cao Ying’s, it contained a gentleness that warmed one’s heart, especially now that her Woeful Poison Body was completely under control. The faint chillness that had existed between her brows in the past had quietly faded away. The current Little Fairy Doctor was just like the girl Xiao Yan had seen in Qingshan Town, possessing a graceful elegance like a fairy.

If Cao Ying was described as a bewitching and alluring witch, the Little Fairy Doctor was just like a fairy that had fallen into the mortal realm...

The two women possessed two completely different demeanors. However, they were both enticing.

The Little Fairy Doctor’s pretty eyes gently blinked when she saw Xiao Yan swiftly walking over. After seeing the expression in his eyes, the intelligent her understood everything within her heart. The corner of her mouth involuntarily revealed a warm smile.

“Hello... Cao Ying. May I know how to address you?” An alluring smile hung on Cao Ying’s face as she extended her long, narrow hand while introducing herself.

“Little Fairy Doctor...” The Little Fairy Doctor gently held Cao Ying’s hand. Her gentle tone was neither hurried nor impatient.

“I have followed Xiao Yan back. You don’t mind, do you?” Cao Ying smiled and withdrew her hand. Her pretty eyes glanced at Xiao Yan, but she spoke as though nothing had happened.

“A mere idle chat between friends. What is there to mind?” The Little Fairy Doctor softly laughed. The corner of her eyes involuntarily revealed a faint smile when she heard Cao Ying treating her as someone with a relationship with Xiao Yan.

Xiao Yan by the side involuntarily rolled his eyes when he heard their responses. These two women might appear polite on the surface, but their words did not appear to be that calm.

“There are still people waiting for him in the room. We shall not continue chatting here. If Miss Cao has time in the future, you can come more often to play.” The Little Fairy Doctor replied with a faint smile. However, her tone contained the intention of sending this guest off.

Cao Ying’s expression did not change upon hearing her words. She sweetly smiled and said, “Definitely.”

The Little Fairy Doctor slightly smiled upon hearing her reply. She extended her hand and wrapped it around Xiao Yan’s arm. After which, she pulled his somewhat stiff body along as they entered the room.

The smile on Cao Ying’s face was slowly withdrawn as she stared at the tightly shut door. A soft snort was emitted from her nostrils a moment later. She gently clenched her hand and a bewitching arc once again appeared on her face.

“Xiao Yan, you will not be able to escape the hands of mine!”

.....

Before Xiao Yan could say anything, the Little Fairy Doctor swiftly withdrew her hand after entering the room. Xiao Yan could vaguely see a pair of bright-red ear lobes. He involuntarily laughed.

“You actually dare to laugh? All you do is attract woman...”

The Little Fairy Doctor involuntarily chastised him because of embarrassed anger when she heard Xiao Yan laugh.

“You want to manage the woman I attract?” Xiao Yan smiled as he playfully teased.

The Little Fairy Doctor’s pretty face became slightly red upon hearing his teasing. She hurriedly found an excuse and replied, “Xun Er asked me to watch over you before she left...”

Xiao Yan ignored the excuse she had thrown out of her mouth. The smile on his face became more playful.

“Hee hee, Xiao Yan, you dare to take liberties with Little Fairy Doctor jie-jie (elder sister). I will definitely report this to Cai Lin jie-jie. When we left back then, she instructed me to kill you if I saw you being hooked by other woman.” A lovely laughter suddenly chimed across the room while Xiao Yan was secretly smiling. This caused Xiao Yan to leap from shock. He hurriedly turned around and saw the purple-clothed Zi Yan sitting at the window. Her legs were swinging back and forth.

“Kill me?”

Xiao Yan widened his mouth and felt somewhat speechless. This kind of thing was something Cai Lin specialized in.

“You girl, now you have also become so elusive...” Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He sat in a chair and immediately asked, “That’s right, where is Xiong Zhan? Is he not with you?”

“He has been settled outside of the Pill Tower. This is not a place he can enter...” Zi Yan swung her pale-purple ponytail. Her small hand was extended and appeared in front of Xiao Yan. After which, she snatched the teacup from Xiao Yan’s hand and gulped it down. Only then did she say in an elderly manner, “I have come here to lend you a hand.”

Xiao Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor involuntarily laughed when they heard her words. This girl was really cute.

“What is this attitude of yours...” Zi Yan was a little dissatisfied upon hearing their laughter. She softly snorted, “Without my help, I guarantee that you will have no chance of getting the Three Thousand Burning Flame.”

“Rattle!”

The teacup Xiao Yan had just delivered to the corner of his mouth suddenly paused. His eyes swiftly turned to Zi Yan. His expression was a lot more serious as he asked, “What do you mean?”

“Hmph, do you really it will be so easy to subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame? Even the three great heads of the Pill Tower did not have the ability to. Do you intend to forcefully subdue it?” Zi Yan curled her small mouth and said. “I know that the Pill Tower wants all of you to go and try your luck. Unfortunately, however, the Three Thousand Burning Flame already possesses its own intelligence. It is not as easy to subdue as the Fallen Heart Flame in the Inner Academy.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What do you have in mind?” Xiao Yan had become a lot more grave. He was naturally aware that the Three Thousand Burning Flame was far from what the Fallen Heart Flame could compare with. However, things should be indeed the case when he thought about it. How lousy could the thing that caused even Xuan Kong Zi’s trio to treat seriously be?

A proudness surged over Zi Yan’s small face when she saw that Xiao Yan had put down his pride to inquire. She patted her small chest and said, “I can tell you this. However, you must promise to refine a medicinal ingredient that you have obtained from Xiong Zhan everyday.”

Xiao Yan rolled his eyes upon hearing this. This greedy little fellow...

“Alright, alright. We will do as you say...”

“Hee hee.”

Zi Yan laughed. Only then did she stand up with satisfaction. She gently clenched her small hand and a purple-colored glow appeared. Immediately it wiggled and transformed into a half-a-foot-long purple dragon in front of Xiao Yan’s and the Little Fairy Doctor’s eyes.

This purple dragon’s eyes were tightly shut. Her body lingered. Although it was only illusionary, it vaguely possessed an unusually terrifying dragon might that pervaded the room.

“I heard Little Fairy Doctor jie-jie mention that you entered the star region once. The Three Thousand Burning Flame that you have seen should look like this, right?”

Xiao Yan slowly nodded. This purple dragon was a complete miniature of the Three Thousand Burning Flame, but why would Zi Yan know what it looks like? Could it be...

Xiao Yan’s expression quickly changed when he thought of a certain possibility.
