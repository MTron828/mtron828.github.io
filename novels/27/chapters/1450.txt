Chapter 1452: Deputy Hall Chief of the Hall of Soul

“This hall chief?”

Xiao Yan’s eyes abruptly shrank after hearing the indifferent voice being transmitted from distorted space. The Hall of Souls was clearly intervening by sending this person. Moreover, this person called himself hall chief. Could it be that he was that extremely mysterious hall chief of the Hall of Souls?

Black fog continuously seeped out of the distorted space. It slowly formed into a human figure completely covered in black fog in front of everyone.

“Hall chief of the Hall of Souls?”

The eyes of the First Elder from the Small Pill Tower shot to the human figure in black fog. His slightly hunched body leaned forward. The space around him began to slowly fluctuate at this moment.

“Perhap addressing me as deputy hall chief is better.” That black fog fluctuated slightly while a faint laugh was emitted.

“Looks like you, the deputy hall chief is not bold enough. Since you dare to barge into my Falling Star Pavilion, you should use your actual body. An illusory figure, could it be that you are timid?” A cold smile lifted onto the corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth. With his eyesight, he naturally sensed that the human figure in the black fog in front of him was merely a shadow and not the actual body.

“Xiao Yan, you are the first person in many years to call this chief timid...” A strange laugh was emitted from the human figure in the black fog. “However, your current achievements have surprised this chief. If I had known this would happen, I would have exterminated the Xiao clan back then.”

“Those from your Hall of Souls have said these words many times...” Xiao Yan’s eyes were icy-cold as he slowly said. “However, if you are only here to utter nonsense using your status as the deputy hall chief of the hall of souls, then there is no need for this illusory figure to continue existing,”

Xiao Yan began to slowly lift his hand as he spoke. He aimed it at that illusory figure. The space around the figure began to fluctuate.

“The reason this chief is here is naturally because of the Tou She Ancient God Jade in your hands...” The person in the black fog faintly smiled. Black fog surged in front of him before it turned into a black mirror. The mirror rippled and an image appeared. The image was of a huge and dark prison. One of the cells had black color chains wrapped around it like a spider web. A haggard-looking figure sat in the middle of the chains. The many chains were like poisonous snakes restricted his limbs.

Xiao Yan’s face appeared ferocious as he looked at this figure. His body suddenly stood up. A terrifying aura erupted from his body, spreading in all directions. The tables and chairs beside him were turned into dust almost instantly. A monstrous murderous desire caused the entire hall to turn cool.

“Father!”

Xiao Yan tightly clenched his hand. His nails pierced his palm while his body trembled. That haggard figure was someone he was extremely familiar with. It was his father, Xiao Zhan.

Even though he had not seen his father for many years, Xiao Yan immediately sensed a familiar feeling that came from their connected bloodline.

“Hand the Tou She Ancient God Jade over to me. Otherwise, with just a thought, this very day next year will be the anniversary of your father’s death!” The person in the black fog seemed to be totally unconcerned about Xiao Yan’s monstrous murderous intent as he coldly cried out.

“Creak!”

Xiao Yan’s expression was so dark that it was terrifying. His fist emitted a cracking sound. At this moment, he was like a wild beast. He was losing his rational mind. Both of his eyes were bright-red. An insane murderous desire swelled in his mind. It roared, demanding that he tear this person in front of him into tens of thousands of pieces!

“Xiao Yan, calm down!”

A somewhat icy-cool smooth hand gently grabbed his arm while the desire to kill surged in his mind. A worried soft cry was transmitted into his ear.

Xiao Yan’s heart shook slightly after hearing this cry. Only then did he regain his rational thoughts. He deeply inhaled a couple of breaths and suppressed the murderous desire in his heart. His ferocious face slowly regained its usual calm.

“Hand over the Tou She Ancient God Jade!”

The fog around that black fog figure fluctuated after seeing Xiao Yan gradually calm down. He let out a cold cry in the process.

“I’m afraid that if I really hand the Tou She Ancient God Jade to you, my father will only end up dying even quicker!” Xiao Yan’s eyes were terrifyingly dark as they stared at the figure in the black fog. He said, “This trick is useless against me. Bring my father to me if you wish to obtain the Tou She Ancient God Jade. Otherwise, I will only end up ignoring all of your threats. The ancient jade in my hand can sense if my father’s alive. Should it lose contact, I will hand it to the Gu clan. At that time, you will never obtain it!”

“You are going to ignore the death of your father because of the ancient jade?” That human figure in the black fog coldly laughed upon hearing these words.

Xiao Yan faintly smiled. His face once again recovered its usual calm. He didn’t know why the Hall of Souls was so anxious to obtain the Tou She Ancient God Jade. Regardless of the actual reason, the ancient jade was the talisman that protected his father’s life. The Hall of Souls would not dare to truly take his father’s life as long as the ancient jade was around. Hence, he could not hand over the ancient jade before he could guarantee Xiao Zhan’s safety!

There was a high chance that the Hall of Souls would truly take his father’s life the moment he handed it over.

“Hee hee, what a ruthless person. It is indeed as First Tianzun mentioned. Such methods will not work against you...” As Xiao Yan regained his composure, the human figure in the black fog understood that this scheme did not have much of an effect.

Xiao Yan was expressionless. He said, “If you do not dare to reveal your actual body, you can get lost now.”

“Xiao Yan, you should cease acting arrogantly in front of this chief. Do you really think that you can fight my Hall of Souls by just establishing this so-called ‘Sky Mansion Alliance’? Tsk tsk, just wait. Once all of you become aware of the strength of my Hall of Souls, you will naturally give up all hope...” That human figure in the black fog strangely laughed, “As for the Pill Tower, our Hall of Souls would normally give you some face, but you have given this up, so do not blame my Hall of Souls for being vicious. Coincidentally, we have been eyeing the alchemists in your Pill Tower for a long time.

“I will also advise the Flower Sect and the Burning Flame Valley to not randomly get involved in this mess. Otherwise, it will be too late to rethink things when your faction is destroyed!”

“Whether you can swallow my Pill Tower will depend on how hard your teeth are!” The First Elder coldly laughed.

Fairy Qing and ancestor Hou Yun narrowed their eyes, but they merely looked from the side with cold eyes and did not utter a word.

Xiao Yan’s eyes were dark and cold as he stared at the human figure in the black fog. He was too lazy to argue with the latter. He slowly clenched his hand, “Inform everyone after you return that I will kill every single bastard from the Hall of Souls and the Hun clan in the future!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The space around that person in the black fog immediately collapsed with a “bang” the moment Xiao Yan clenched his hand. A frightening strength cracked space itself. At the same time, that person in black fog instantly turned into nothing...

“Tsk tsk, what an arrogant brat. Who do you think you are? Even someone as strong as Xiao Xuan was defeated by the hands of my Hun clan. You, a mere one star Dou Sheng, really do not know your limits. Ha ha, this chief will wait for that day to come. As long as you dare to come, I will personally kill you!”

A strange laughter echoed within the large hall after the human figure in the black fog disappeared. The laughter continued for a long time.

“Looks like our alliance was discovered by the Hall of Souls a long time ago. Otherwise, this person would not have shown himself in an attempt to deter everyone present and hinder the alliance.” Yao Lao slowly spoke as he watched the hall gradually become quiet.

“This alliance has definitely caused the Hall of Souls to feel a little fear. Otherwise, they would not do such a thing given their characters.” Xiao Yan spoke in a faint voice. “Has anyone heard of that deputy hall chief from the Hall of Souls earlier?”

“I’ve never heard of him. There are many experts within the Hun clan. This deputy hall chief is probably an expert from within the Hun clan...” Ancestor Hou Yun frowned and coldly laughed, “However, the strength of this person is at the very most a three star Dou Sheng. Otherwise, it would not be a shadow arriving today. Instead, it would have been an actual person. He only hide himself because he is not confident he can defeat all of us.”

Xiao Yan slightly nodded. The deputy hall chief from earlier was clearly afraid of their lineup.

“Everyone, the matter of the alliance has already been settled. Does anyone have any final inquiries?” Xiao Yan’s eyes swept over everyone as he continued. “The Hall of Souls is this alliance’s powerful enemy. Once this alliance is publicly announced, the Hall of Souls will definitely not stay calm. At that time, we will have to join hands and fight our enemy.”

The First Elder of the Pill Tower, ancestor Hou Yun, Fairy Qing, and the rest looked at each other. Finally, they slowly shook their heads. None of them were ordinary. It was impossible for them to be frightened to the point of changing their minds because the deputy chief of the Hall of Souls threatened them.

“Since this is the case, we will announce this matter in a couple of days. At that time, I hope everyone will act to build a wormhole between each faction in order to reinforce any party as fast as possible!” Xiao Yan uttered in a deep voice.

“Aye.”

Everyone nodded upon hearing his words. The alliance was formed. It was likely that the Hall of Souls would make a formal response to this alliance. Their futures would not be peaceful.

“Let’s not delay any longer. We will now head back and build wormholes.”

Xiao Yan smiled and nodded as he watched ancestor Hou Yun and the rest stand up to leave. He stood up with Yao Lao’s group and sent them off. His eyes looked at their swiftly disappearing figures. After which, he exchanged glances with those present. All of them felt a storm approaching.

The Central Plains, which had been relatively calm for many years, was likely going to be lively again...
