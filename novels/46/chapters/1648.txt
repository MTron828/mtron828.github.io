1649 The Second Round. I

Meanwhile, Hephaestus' reaction was the total opposite. His face was marked with a mocking look as he gazed through the eyes of his scout at Felix's two speeding clones.

"You think two clones will be enough to hold me down? It seems like the beating I have given him wasn't enough to set him straight."

Hephaestus stood up from his throne with his hammer leaning against his shoulder...His expression was that of utter coldness as he got himself prepared for the upcoming battle.

'Hmmm?'

Just as he planned on leaving the throne chamber, the scouts showed him a familiar sight. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Suddenly, the clones started to shimmer with a mysterious green glow...Then, in an instant, the clones vanished!

The green light dissipated as quickly as it had appeared, leaving behind a void where Felix's clones had stood just moments before.

While Apollo and the rest of the unigins were left surprised and curious about Felix's clones' location, Hephaestus' turned grimmer after noticing two invading auras at the very front of his realm's entrance, a place dominated by fire, molten landscapes, and smoldering skies.

Then, Felix switched his main focus to the pride form clone and requested Asna's core to channel the celestial energy they had absorbed and turn it into celestial flames!

Slowly, the air around the clones shimmered, and a faint white glow emerged, coalescing into flickering white flames.

The flames grew in size and intensity until they enveloped the clones completely.

Whoosh!! Whoosh!!...

The clones' forms became brighter and more radiant, their figures now silhouette of blazing white fire.

"I am Supreme."

"Rampage."

Without an ounce of hesitation, Felix and his clone activated those two symbols above their heads.

One doubled Felix's current strength, which was already significantly enhanced through perfection manifastion symbol while the other increased his power by 1% each second!

With these three symbols combined, and celestial flames feeding them, Felix's two clones' strength had already surpassed sixty million BF and was still on the rise!!

Abruptly, Hephaestus made a dramatic entrance befitting his fearsome reputation.

RUMMMMBLE!!!

With a monumental force that shook the realm, Hephaestus emerged from the lava, rising like a colossus from the depths of his volcanic kingdom!

Towering over the landscape, he was a gargantuan figure, his body forged from the same fiery elements that made up his domain.

The air around him distorted with the intense heat emanating from his form, and his eyes burned like twin furnaces, full of power and wrath.

In his massive hand, he wielded his gigantic divine hammer. With a movement that sent waves of lava splashing in all directions, Hephaestus lifted the hammer and pointed it directly at Felix and his clone.

The gesture was both a challenge and a declaration of war!

Then, in a tone that resonated like the clash of metal on an anvil, Hephaestus addressed them with a cold, menacing tone.

"You and your pale imitation think you can challenge the master of the forge in his realm? You barely survived against me in the open."

"Bold words coming from a camper." Felix sneered, "The only reason you have beaten me was due to your extensive preparation and I still managed to escape. You should feel ashamed of your failure instead of boasting about it."

"I am not taking sides, but he is right, you know?"

Before Hephaestus could respond, Apollo's soft-spoken voice fell in his ears.

Hephaestus' expression turned colder as he glanced to the side and observed the emergence of Apollo outside of his territory...He was chilling on his darkness cloud while carrying the lyre on his lap.

"Apollo, if you aren't going to join the battle, I suggest you f*ck off this instant." Hephaestus wasn't in the mood to entertain Apollo's shenanigans.

"Don't mind me, I am just here as a bystander, you can carry on your squabble." Apollo waved his hands in denial while making sure to remain away from the battlefield.

"..." Felix remained silent as he looked into Apollo's innocent and slightly excited eyes, making him feel like he was here genuinely to watch them duke it out again.

Soon, Felix lowered his gaze and cracked his knuckles, resulting in mini explosions resounding thunderously.

Then, without an ounce of hesitation, he charged into Hephaestus with his clone, knowing that his celestial flames wouldn't last that long!

"Let's see how your flames fare against the true might of my domain," Hephaestus boomed, his tone echoing like thunder across the molten landscape.

With a sweeping gesture, he invoked his Territorial Pressure!

The atmosphere around Felix's clones twisted violently...The air itself seemed to ignite, heat surging to an unimaginable degree, as if the very essence of a star had been unleashed!

Felix and his clone, undeterred, stood their ground!

"Your flames may rule this realm, Hephaestus, but they cannot consume what creates them."

Felix retorted coldly, the celestial flames around them intensifying, transforming into a protective inferno that defied the god's scorching assault!

"Wheew, the exiled's celestial flames are really on a different level than divinities."

Apollo commentated with a faint smile as he began preparing his lyre, ready to add a second part to his previous score.

"How long can you hold on?" Hephaestus sneered.

He knew that Asna's celestial flames consumed close to 100% of celestial energy, which was considered an overkill to stop his territorial pressure.

In other words, as long as he maintained it on Felix and his clones, the consumption rate would explode and the few minutes that Felix had might turn into a few seconds!!

Felix had expected as much.

Instead of responding in words, he displayed him how he planned to survive.

He gave him a slight smirk as he linked up two wisps within the clones's consciousness space to Asna's core.

This produced another link with her, which was used primarily to absorb the celestial energy within Hephaestus' domain and feed it to the core to transform it!!

In this manner, as long as Felix remained in a rich area of celestial energy, he would be unstoppable!

'Little sh*t, I have to keep him in this area at all cost.' Hephaestus swore under his breath as he sensed the rapid loss of celestial energy around them.

This made him understand that he could not let Felix roam free in his territory as he would exhaust the whole place of celestial energy!

"Star Forge!"

With a grand, sweeping motion, he began to reshape a massive part of his realm...The ground trembled and heaved as he exerted his divine will, causing lava and magma to surge upwards, swirling and coalescing into a gigantic, seething sphere!

This sphere, a microcosm of his volcanic kingdom, radiated intense heat, with rivers of lava pouring across its surface.

The sphere began to close in around them, its walls a cascade of molten rock and fiery plasma, menacing to engulf them in its unrelenting embrace!

Simultaneously, Hephaestus unleashed another aspect of his immense power.

"Arise!"

With a commanding shout, he conjured thousands of fiery clones, each a wisp of his consciousness, and sent them hurtling towards Felix's clones.

These ethereal doppelgangers moved with incredible speed, firing relentless barrages of lava beams and plasmablasts.

While they weren't as strong as the real deal, they were able to manipulate the laws in their domain.

The air crackled and sizzled with the intensity of their assault, as the clones focused their attacks on the Supreme Symbol floating above Felix's clones.

Each beam and projectile they launched was infused with the destructive essence of Hephaestus' domain, a relentless onslaught designed to shatter the symbol and cause Felix to suffer the penalty.

Amidst the swirling vortex of fire and heat, Felix and his clone concentrated their power, summoning a massive battleaxe formed from the purest form of void energy!

The axe materialized in a vortex of swirling purplish darkness, its presence seeming to absorb the light around it.

WHOOOOSH!!! WHOOOSH!!!!

With a forceful swing, they launched the weapons through the superheated air.

The battleaxe tore through the fabric of reality itself, a dark streak against the blinding heat, aimed straight at Hephaestus, his clones, and the enclosing sphere!

Hephaestus, his expression turning from confidence to dread, watched as the void axe cut through his domain's intense heat, space, time, clones, reality, and whatever stopped in its path!!

Even his territorial pressure was able to merely weaken the strike but not completely block it.

it was expected as those axes possessed much stronger capabilities than even void domain, allowing them to disintegrate anything in their path!

Slice! Slice!!
