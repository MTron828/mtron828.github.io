1333 Standing For Himself.

'Not cool, not cool at all.

Felix didn't feel pleased when he woke up and realized what happened to him.F·ªãùíèdd ùíèew updùíÇtùíÜs on n(o)v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

He did nothing to hide his displeasure from Foremother Siamese, but her expression remained unfazed.

"When you decide on the element you want to work on, name it out loud."

Foremother Siamese turned around after saying this and before Felix could react, he found himself back in the Northern Forest.

"...I don't know why, but I want to curse badly." Felix couldn't help but feel helpless like a piece of meat in front of Foremother Siamese and he didn't like the feeling one bit.

It was like he had absolutely no control over his own body and she could do whatever she wanted with him...This nasty feeling could be understood only by the people who experienced it.

"Don't bother yourself with that, all that matters is I got you the deal with additional benefits." Asna shared with a charming smile.

"You did?!" Felix got excited.

He heard Foremother Siamese talking about picking an element or such, but he wasn't convinced yet.

"How did you do it?" Lady Sphinx asked with an intrigued tone.

"As I said, I offered her something that she can't obtain." Asna answered without going through the details.

When everyone heard her response, they knew that she wanted to keep the deal's details to herself.

They respected her wishes even though they really wanted to know to appease their curiosity.

"Asna, can you promise me at least that you haven't made a deal that endangers you or takes advantage of you?"

Felix's excited expression switched to a solemn one immediately.

In his eyes, if Asna put herself in a bad situation for his sake, he would rather not have her help him in the first place.

"It's nothing like that." Asna smiled, "I promise you, it doesn't affect me negatively in any shape or form."

Felix remained silent for a while as he did nothing but stare into Asna's sincere breathtaking eyes.

In the end, he exhaled deeply and showed her a wide smile...Then, he hugged her and said, "Thanks for making it happen."

"I don't need your thanks for such matters." Asna hugged him closer and whispered in his ear, "As I said before, we are in this together and you can always count on me for such matters."

"It's just that it's been a while since you helped me with something, I started to think that you have become usel..."

"You ungrateful prick!" Asna broke off the hug and elbowed him in the stomach under his loud chuckles.

While these two were joking with each other through violence, the rest of the tenants were discussing Asna's deal telepathically.

They might be respectful enough to not force an answer on Asna, but it didn't mean that they couldn't come up with their own assumptions.

After all, this was a deal with a galaxy's consciousness and even if they grouped together,

they doubted it would be possible to move her with anything.

'Do you think Asna used her identity?'

'I am sure she did.'

'But, what kind of favor can she provide?"

'Well, her title is called the Origin of Laws...You can imagine what kind of powers and authority she wields in her strongest form.

The primogenitors merely used common sense to recognize that Asna's prowess and authority could be considered at the top of the food chain through her title.

In reality? None of them really understood her role in the universe and her true prowess since she was imprisoned at a young age.

In addition, there wasn't any other Unigin with the same title being born before, which implied that her role was unique and new.

Most of them assumed that it was to preside and guard over all the laws of the universe as that's what the title said, which was honestly inconceivable.

After all, there were Unigin Guardians of other laws and if Asna was born with such authority, then she would make them all obsolete and unnecessary.

The universe would never do something so counterproductive.

'There is no way for us to know for sure unless we ask her or read her memories. We can do neither, so let's just drop it for now! Lady Sphinx said while flipping a page of her book.

She wasn't a fan of empty speculations as they serve nothing but cloud one's judgment from the actual truth.

Since it was impossible to read Asna's memories without her permission and the consciousness link was closed shut, there was truly no way to know.

Unless, they decided to hack into her bracelet and extract the recordings of the deal, which was even more impossible.

So, everyone ended up dropping this subject... At least, for now.

...

"I can't believe you actually got me free access to the galaxy whenever I desire and even help with all of my elements!" Felix's eyes gleamed with a new level of excitement after hearing of the full benefits.

This solved so much, especially the free access!

He was always frustrated that he would be forced to leave early to handle Lucifer and waste such an amazing opportunity, but not anymore!

Now, he could pop inside whenever he wanted to train any sort of ability and then pop outside again and continue his life!

"I am not so useless now, huh?" Asna acted annoyed.

"Come on, you know I was messing with you, how can my beautiful Asna ever be useless?" Felix appeased her with a shameless expression as he massaged her shoulders.

"Humph!"

"How about this? After I finish off that f*cker Lucifer and bring this war to its conclusion, I will take you to as many dates as you would like." Felix offered with a faint smile.

"You promise?"

"You know my word is sacred to me."

"It better be, it's been forever since we have gone out together." Asna finally dropped the upset act and showed a chirpy attitude.

"I know..."

Felix became the frustrated one as he realized that he had been not focusing on his relationship with Asna even a little.

But he couldn't be blamed for this as his life was getting more stressful and stacked with life-and- death situations, which would make it impossible for anyone to feel romantic.

After all, how could he take Asna on a date when there was an ongoing war with millions of innocent people getting killed or demonized each day?

How could he be completely committed to Asna when a big portion of his mind and heart were filled with hatred and thoughts of revenge toward the three darkins?

But he realized that he could always create excuses for not developing his relationship with Asna and those excuses would never run out.

It was up to him to make time regardless of his situation.

"I didn't want you to feel this way..." Asna smiled as she held Felix's face between her hands and looked directly into his eyes, "I might enjoy some romance between us, but I love it more when I watch you dedicated to your goals. I would rather have you not comprise on this no matter what."

"You better listen to your girl." Lord Shiva interjected in their conversation without a care in the world, "You are already distracted enough with this bullsh*t war, don't make me change our arrangements."

"Lord Shiva, I respect you as an elder and I am thankful for your gifts. But..." Felix took a deep breath as he gave him a cold stare, "Don't you f*cking ever get in a conversation between me and Asna."

"Or what?"

Lord Shiva lifted his sunglasses and showed Felix the coldest glare he had ever seen before in his life... Yet, Felix was not frightened in the slightest by it.

He faced him and stared directly into his eyes, then he threatened, "You will have no place in my consciousness space."

"You will kick me out after using my bloodline and taking my manipulation?" Lord Shiva laughed in amusement, "Isn't your word sacred to you?"

"Do not worry, if I decided to kick you out, I won't use a single utility from you even if it means messing up my future plans." Felix promised with a stoic expression.

He did not seem to be joking at all, which made the atmodimension quite intense.

His masters had no intentions of stopping him or scolding him for talking like this to a primogenitor.

Lady Sphinx merely kept reading her book while Thor and J√É¬∂rmungandr were playing chess.

But, all of them shared a faint pleased smile.

They were truly proud that Felix was capable of defending his territory when crossed even if it was done by a tenant who bestowed upon him many gifts.

Otherwise, he would be no different than a beggar who would accept all kinds of disrespect just because someone did him a solid.

Felix had lowered his head through most of Lord Shiva's bullsh*t for the sake of his future, but he would never let it go if he disrespected his woman in the process.

"I guess you aren't a p*ssy, after all." Lord Shiva snickered in amusement as he pulled down his sunglasses and returned to his daily lazy sunbathing.

Honestly, Felix was quite fortunate that he did this with Lord Shiva since he could take any kind of crap from anyone as long as they could back it up.

Most primogenitors wouldn't care whether they're in the wrong or the right as any signs of disrespect from a mortal warranted a beatdown!

"Cough, so, are you still planning to enhance your destruction element affinity or push the rest to the limit?" Candace asked even though she knew that answer for the sake of changing the subject.

"The former." Felix answered while switching his focus to his main consciousness.

Then, without an ounce of hesitation, he called out loud, "I would like to work on the destruction

element."

As silent as a moonless night, Felix was transported by Foremother Siamese to an environment filled with nothing.

Literal nothingness as he was forced to hold his breath after realizing that not an atom of oxygen existed!

'Where am I?'
