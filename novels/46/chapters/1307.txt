1308 Elder Strauvis With The Alley-Oop.

Even when SGAlliance's fleets retreated, Prince Beelzebub still had no happiness on his face...He was relieved that his capital hadn't fallen but understood that the danger wasn't gone yet.

"It took us too much investment and we still barely reduced 1% of those bastards' forces." Prince Beelzebub frowned,

"The next time they come, they will be ready to take my home from me for real."

Prince Beelzebub had lost almost all of his spaceships, a significant quantity of space demons, and even a Leviathan...To make matters worse, he ended up defeated when he invaded the Mothership.

For now, he regrouped with his brothers to discuss their next move.

"Are they refusing to sign the soul contract?" Prince Beelzebub inquired when he noticed his brothers pulling with them chained raging demons.

Those demons had the same features as shadowborns, elves, pandions, centaurs, and more races belonging to the alliance.

"With a bit of starvation, they will come around and beg us to sign the contract." Prince Belphegor sneered.

He didn't bother to question any of them now about the SGAlliance since newly demonized strong fighters had a bit of will to them...This will would falter only when they realize that without purities, their lives were over.

"Now what?" Prince Beelzebub suggested without an ounce of shame, "I think it's best if you brought all of your troops here. With our armies united, the..."

"No, thank you." Prince Satan sneered, "I am not planning to leave my territory defenseless just to protect your precious capital...This is the last time I am coming here."

"You..."

"As much as I hate to admit it, this war has really just one result." Prince Mammon sighed, "Our territories falling in their hands slowly until we will be left with just our capital or even less. I would rather remain in my territory and try my best to prolong this from happening."

Although it seemed like the SGAlliance had lost this battle, in reality, they merely took a calculated retreat to rethink their strategy with all the new information in their possession.

The advantage was still on their side heavily and the demon princes were smart to see that.

"The only thing we can do is try to target their leaders and demonize them." Prince Abaddon nodded.

"I am suggesting we bring Lucifer into this. It's not the time for either worship or fight for the throne." Prince Asmodeus said with a solemn tone.

Before this battle, the six princes had great confidence that they would win the war with a landslide and accuse Lucifer of being an irresponsible Demon King.

But now? They understood that they needed every piece of strength at their disposal and Lucifer was known to be the strongest of them all...Either individually or through his demon army.

In fact, his demon army could be said to double their demon army while united even including the Leviathans!

If it wasn't for this, his territory wouldn't be the biggest and he wouldn't be considered The Demon King even when he was gone for hundreds of thousands of years.

"We have helped you protect your capital, it's time for you to pay and handle Lucifer for us."

"Wait what?"

"We are counting on you."

"Hold on!! I didn't sign for this!"

Alas, no matter how much Prince Beelzebub screamed, his brothers had already taken off with their new demons.

A couple of days later...

The SGAlliance had retracted their troops from the capital's territory but made sure to station many scouting fleets near it.

As for its solar system? All of the nearby planets had been conquered already and now the SGAlliance were ironing their foundation by eliminating the runaway demons and establishing military bases.

They were doing this across his entire demon realm as they kept getting reports of demons running amok due to their lack of military bases in those conquered planets.

Prince Beelzebub was receiving Intel about the SGAlliance's movement, but he could do nothing but grit his teeth and watch.

To make matters worse, his attempts to reach out to Lucifer failed continuously, making him understand that if he wanted Lucifer to join them he had to visit him personally.

He found it hard to do this when he had no clue if the SGAlliance would launch another attack at his capital when he was gone.

Meanwhile, The SGAlliance had absolutely no intentions of getting close to him for the meantime as they were focusing on making all conquered planets truly theirs.

They kept getting reports of demons running amok due to their lack of military bases and the SGAlliance felt that it was better to secure their foundation before expanding even more...Especially after their latest setback.

So, for the next two months or so, the war on the seven demon realms was halted but not a single demon felt relieved by this as they could feel that the SGAlliance was taking its preparation as seriously as possible.

eaglesnov…ê1,—Åo–ú On the other hand, Felix had already entered the Elementals Galaxy and had just reached Elder Strauvis' planet atmosphere.

The moment he got close, the clouds on the planet turned into a massive featureless face.

"Welcome back, child.' Elder Strauvis greeted kindly.

√öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

"Thank you elder for having me again.' Felix replied politely, 'I have brought with me some delicacies, I hope the elder enjoys them.'

'You didn't have to...But, I'll gladly accept them." Elder Strauvis smiled in appreciation.

'You are most welcome.'

To show his gratitude, Elder Strauvis offered, 'Would you like me to teleport you straight to your friends?"

"That will be helpful."

As he said this, Felix exited swiftly from his spaceship and beamed it in his spatial card.

Then, he closed his eyes and when he opened them again, he found himself standing near a breathtaking lake.

The sun's gentle rays caressed the tranquil surface of the lake, casting a shimmering tapestry of golden hues upon its pristine waters.

Nestled amidst a lush emerald forest, the lake emanated an aura of enchantment, beckoning all who approached to succumb to its captivating allure.

Bathed in the ethereal glow, two enchanting figures emerged from the water's embrace.

Olivia and Selphie, their forms reminiscent of celestial goddesses, possessed an otherworldly beauty that defied mortal comprehension.

Their luminous skin, kissed by a million sunbeams, glowed with a radiant vitality, while their cascading tresses, woven with wildflowers, seemed to breathe with the rhythm of nature itself.

As droplets of water glistened upon their silken skin, their features reflected a delicate harmony of grace and allure.

Selphie, with her soul-capturing eyes sparkling like twin pools of eternity, possessed an aura of regal elegance.

Long, flowing locks of golden hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of sunlight, weaving a symphony of golden threads that framed her enchanting countenance.

Beside her stood Olivia, a vision of ethereal charm...Her sapphire eyes held a mischievous twinkle, reflecting the playful spirit that resided within her.

Felix wasn't mesmerized by their beauty but by Olivia's complete transformation!

As she moved, her floral tresses swayed in harmony with her every step, releasing a symphony of fragrances that perfumed the air like a sweet melody. Petals softly brushed against her cheeks, leaving a trail of ephemeral kisses in their wake, as if nature itself caressed her with tender admiration.

She seemed one with nature and her floral hair was a living testament to the harmonious dance between humanity and nature.

'Don't tell me..."

'Oh, I forgot to tell you, your little friend has succeeded in breaking through the Origin Realm.' Lady Sphinx informed with a casual tone without bothering to lift her head from her book.

Felix had already reached this realization on his own as Olivia's entire demeanor became that of a goddess of nature, resembling Lady Yggdrasil even more than her own daughter Selphie!

"Who's there?"

It seemed her senses have risen to a new peak as she had located Felix's intrusion in less than a second.

When she turned around and saw Felix's eyes ogling her and Selphie with his new demonic form, her eyes widened in disbelief for a brief moment before she exclaimed, "Felix!!"

Poof!

Olivia shattered into a cloud of mesmerizing colorful flower petals before reappearing right in front of Felix.

"I missed you!"

She hugged him tightly, seemingly uncaring about her smooth fair skin coming in direct contact with him.

"Felix..."

Selphie broke out of her daze the moment she saw this. Her eyes turned slightly red like she was on the verge of breaking into tears...Without uttering a single word or putting even a towel, Selphie joined the hug as well.

Felix was left a bit speechless and somewhat uncomfortable as he could feel everything touching him and had no absolutely no clue what to do.

He didn't dare to even place his hands on their backs as he could feel a burning stare directed straight into his soul, seemingly daring him to touch their perfect skins.

He could lift his head and stare at the sky with an aggravated expression.

'Hehehe. You are welcome." Elder Strauvis chuckled.
