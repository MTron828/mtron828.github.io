Ôªø1416 The Traveler Vs Ravager! II

Ravager's eyes sparkled with resolve as he raised both his hands, focusing his spiritual energy on his opponent.

His fingers danced, pulling invisible strings as he engaged his telekinesis. The air between them crackled, becoming dense as if squeezed by an unseen force, and around Felix, invisible hands reached out, attempting to constrict his movements, compress his form, and assert Ravager's dominance!

"It's done."

Boss Alves smirked, believing that there was no way a newbie was going to defend against Ravager's telekinesis prowess.

Just like Mr. Atticus, he had also put a decent amount of money into Ravager's victory after his sponsored fighter dropped out in the semi-finals at the hands of Felix.

Just as his peers were about to break into wide smiles, Felix's own telekinetic energy flared, a vibrant, pulsing aura enveloping him!

The two opposing forces clashed in a silent war, straining against each other in a tense, vibrating deadlock!

The ground beneath them rippled with the energy and the audience gasped in awe, watching the display of sheer power!

Despite the intensity of Ravager's assault, Felix's telekinetic barrier held strong, an unyielding shield against the relentless pressure.

'Impossible...'

The Ravager's eyes widened in shock as he could feel that Felix's defenses might not be the best, but they helped him avoid complete domination like what happened against Avalanche.

This was what made him even more surprised as he knew that his telekinesis control was better than Avalanche!

"How could he have increased his spiritual prowess so soon?!"

Boss Alves and his peers' expressions turned ugly immediately as it made them understand that someone must have helped Felix with buying spiritual treasures.

They knew that it would be impossible for Felix to get this strong through the black market as he had to pay close to half a million worth of spiritual treasures!

'Kikiki, good job, good job, I have placed a huge bet on you, don't be disappointing me now.'

The culprit Miss Sanae was seen amidst the audience laughing to herself and scaring the viewers next to her with her creepy laugh.

"Shall we continue?"

Felix said coldly as he extended his arm and made it seem like he was holding a sniper rifle in the direction of Ravager.

His arm hummed with vibrational energy, and a glow of red, orange, and yellow hinted at the fire element mingling within!

He took aim, his eyes fixed on Ravager, and as he pulled the imaginary trigger, destructive bullets erupted from the tip of his finger.

Whoosh! Whoosh!..

These projectiles were more than mere bullets; each contained a volatile mix of fire and vibration, promising an explosive end upon contact!

Ravager moved with speed that was a blur, narrowly dodging the first few shots, his agility on full display.

BOOM!! BOOOM!! BOOM!!

However, the resulting explosions that erupted in the wake of the bullets were far-reaching and brutal.

The concussive force buffeted against his telekinetic barrier, each impact threatening to shatter his defenses!

Realizing the scale of the threat, Ravager made his move. His hands swiftly formed a complex gesture, and in response, water surged from his form, twisting and spiraling into a formidable water tornado.

The swirling vortex of water moved to meet the explosive bullets head-on, absorbing the brunt of the explosions and dissipating the vibrational energy within!

The water tornado acted as a formidable barrier, but the continuous onslaught from Felix's sniper arm pushed it to its limits!

'A bit more, just a little more...'

Unbeknownst to Ravager, Felix was dissipating most of the vibration inside his body through the underground as tremors, building up for something much more destructive while he was occupied with his bullets!

The moment Felix began to sense that his vibrations were covering the entire half of the arena before him, his eyes flared with resolve as he stopped his endless assault and slammed his hands onto the ground!

RUMMMMBLE!!!

A shockwave of vibrational energy rushed outwards...The force was so strong, so violent that the very arena around them split cleanly into two halves yet again, causing a rumble of terror and excitement to ripple through the spectators!

"He broke it again!"

"Will he bury him as well?!"I think you should take a look at

While the viewers assumed that Felix would use the same strategy against Avalanche, he took off into the air.

With a swift upward sweep of his hands, he manipulated his newly empowered telekinesis, lifting the enormous chunk of the split arena into the air!!

The sight was breathtaking, displaying the sheer power and dominance he held over his abilities, but no one knew that there was a great sense of pressure and pain behind Felix's stoic expression.

Lifting half of the arena wasn't easy in the slightest.

'What is he up to?'

Ravager narrowed his eyes in focus at the sight of Felix pulling the silver hammer from his back.

Before he could react, Felix brought it crashing down onto the levitated half of the arena!!

RUMMBLE!!!

The collision was cataclysmic, causing the giant mass to shatter instantly into a storm of rubble, boulders, and debris, turning Ravager's side of the sky into a treacherous minefield!

Felix chose a hammer as his tool because of its compatibility with his vibration element. While everyone was left stunned at the destructive scene, the hammer did nothing but trigger the vibration across the elevated half of the arena!

"Here I come."

Without wasting a second, Felix propelled himself forward, closing the distance between himself and Ravager in the blink of an eye while the sky rained rocks around them.

Felix engaged Ravager, swinging his massive hammer with a combination of brute strength and delicate precision, each move calculated and lethal.

With his eyes locked onto his opponent, Felix's mind was a whirl of tactical calculations.

His gaze swept over the myriad of boulders and debris scattered around him, their chaotic disorder turned into weapons with his elemental control.

Felix spread his arms wide, calling upon his oscillation abilities. A hum of power radiated from him, vibrating the air around him and causing the surrounding rubble to tremble in resonance.

Then, with a sweeping motion of his arms, Felix launched the vibrating debris into Ravager!

Every stone, every shard of debris began to pulsate with a powerful rhythm, imbued with Felix's vibrational energy. They shot forward like missiles, cutting through the air with deadly precision toward Ravager.

As they neared their target, Felix increased the frequency of their vibrations, causing them to emit an ear-piercing whine before striking with the strength of a mini explosion upon contact!

"ENOUGH!"

In the middle of the relentless assault from Felix, Ravager's countenance hardened. His usually cool demeanor flared with fierce determination as he decided to put an conclude to the barrage.

Ravager planted his feet solidly on the ground, drawing upon his dual elements of wind and fire.

The arena filled with an escalating roar as the wind began to swirl around him, picking up heat as the fiery essence was infused into it.

His hands glowed with a bright, sizzling aura, the combination of the two elements creating a volatile power ready to be unleashed!

And then, with a forceful wave of his hands, he discharged the built-up energy. A wave of searing hot wind expanded outwards from him, carrying with it the intensity of a wild inferno.

The wave collided with the onslaught of debris, and the resulting explosion was a spectacle of pure elemental might.

BOOOOOOOOOM!!!

Each stone, each piece of debris caught in the explosion was instantly reduced to sand, scattering into the wind.

'Sh*t!'

The sheer strength of the explosion threw Felix off balance, propelling him backward through the air like a ragdoll.

He crashed into the ground several times before using two fire jets from his palms to decrease his momentum!

The moment he stopped, the audience gasped collectively at the sight of him being merely one meter away from getting kicked out of the arena's premises!

After the dust settled, silence covered the colosseum as neither Felix nor Ravager made another move.

They merely stood at the edges of the arena with stoic and cold expressions, staring at each other and calculating the best way to defeat their opponent.

'How do I eliminate this monster?'

'How do I eliminate this freak of nature?'

For once, they shared the same thought.
