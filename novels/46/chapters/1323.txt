1324 One of The Greatest Cheats in The Universe! I

'I got defeated again...Ultimate abilities are really something else. Lucifer thought to himself as he revisited his epic fight with Fenrir. It didn't seem like he was worried in the slightest about being captured and held inside a spatial ring.

It was understandable as he could free himself anytime he wanted by simply giving up on this body and getting born again anywhere with evil energy. He didn't even require DNA presence like the rest of the demons.

'Mother told me that primogenitors won't be easy to handle, but I never thought they would be this overpowered...If I want to defeat them, I need to create my own ultimate ability.' Lucifer sighed, 'If only it was this simple.'

Lucifer had learned from his mother that each primogenitor had taken eons of their time focused on creating their ultimate abilities.

He might have never known about their power before, but now that he experienced two ultimate abilities and didn't survive them, he figured out that it was going to be extremely tough for him to create his own ultimate ability.

'Wait a moment... Hehe, I don't need to waste my time on such a thing when my other half seems to possess multiple ultimate abilities. Lucifer suddenly smiled, 'When I merge with him and become one, I will obtain everything that he owes. With his arsenal of ultimate abilities, my gifts, and the ascension powerup, I will be unstoppable.

While one would get disheartened by two defeats in a row, Lucifer wasn't bothered that much as he learned from all of his experiences. Such an attitude was born from his immortality as his confidence would never crack even with hundreds of defeats.

'Now, do I escape from this or see through it?' Lucifer's focus returned to his current unfavorable situation...Besides his thoughts, he couldn't move a single thing.

So, the only way for him to escape was by abandoning this body. 'He said he will be taking me to a friend...It might be my other half."

In the end, Lucifer decided to stay put in captivity in hopes of meeting with Felix.

A couple of days later... Inside one of Lady Sphinx's temporarily movable laboratories.

"Is he still there?" Lady Sphinx asked.

"Yes." Fenrir nodded as he expelled Lucifer from the spatial ring.

He was still in an ice coffin while suffering under absolute zero, making it impossible for him to do anything but watch.

'He isn't here?' When Lucifer looked around him and noticed no presence of Felix, he couldn't help but get displeased.

'Looks like he hoped for Felix to be here!' Lady Sphinx reasoned from reading the emotions in his eyes.√öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

'We don't know if he didn't free himself because he couldn't or he was using this chance to get close to Felix. Whatever it is, you have to be fast.' J√É¬∂rmungandr warned.

'I know.' Without an ounce of hesitation, Lady Sphinx created a tiny sand needle and decreased its size until it entered the quantum universe.

Then, she gave a slight head nod at Fenrir. Fenrir removed the ice coffin, exposing Lucifer's frozen body in the open... It seemed like the chill radiating from his body was capable of freezing anything near it in time.

However, the sand needle wasn't affected by either the coldness or the time-freezing effect as the laws of physics were different in the quantum universe!

Through using her quantum vision and fine control, Lady Sphinx guided the sand needle within Lucifer's body before enlarging its size until it positioned itself inside the nucleus of one of Lucifer's hundred trillion cells.

Lady Sphinx used the passive, *Senses sharing*, allowing her to transfer her senses to the sand needle and then record all of Lucifer's DNA content.

This was the same passive that Felix unlocked when he was using her bloodline...Though, the utilization was completely different. 'Reading DNA code...Done.'

It took her barely a split second before she recorded everything and pulled back to the real world.

'Did they do something to me?' Lucifer knitted his eyebrows as his guts kept tingling that something wasn't right.

But, he neither saw nor felt anything...The entire process took less than a second and it happened in a totally different world. 'Staying here is a waste of time.'

Knowing that Fenrir would not release him from his captivity, Lucifer found no reason to remain around those two. Under the surprised looks of Fenrir and Lady Sphinx, Lucifer's eyes turned dim all of a sudden.

"Did he give up on this body?" Fenrir asked.

"Must be, I feel no presence of either a consciousness or a soul." Lady Sphinx said, "Let me confirm it first." Lady Sphinx did the same thing with the needle and found out that Lucifer's DNA had collapsed somehow even when it was frozen in it!

This made her understand that if they canceled Fenrir's ultimate ability, Lucifer's body would either disappear or turn into evil energy.

"Cancel it."

Fenrir did as he was told and as she expected, Lucifer's body became a mist of evil energy that rushed in their direction like a ravish dog.

Lady Sphinx waved her hand and contained the evil energy inside a green sand sphere for a few

moments until the evil energy was absorbed completely by it.

"Interesting...The more I study him the more I realize that Lucifer's true identity isn't anywhere close to other demons." Lady Sphinx said.

"You mean he isn't really a demon?" Felix raised an eyebrow in surprise as he watched the situation unfold from a consciousness-link mirror.

"On the opposite." Lady Sphinx dropped a bombshell, "I believe that he is the true demon and the rest are nothing but a byproduct."

This left everyone confused as they couldn't imagine those demons being anything more than demons.

"I have a theory that needs testing." Lady Sphinx smiled as her fingers danced on a holographic screen, typing hundreds of code lines that seemed like gibberish in everyone's eyes.

While Felix wasn't too knowledgeable about the subject, he knew that she was actually writing Lucifer's genome by hand!

Just a human genome contained more than three billion letters and to this day and age, no one

managed to completely decipher every single letter and its function.

One could only wonder how complex Lucifer's genome would be. 'With this, master can attempt to create a clone of Lucifer and run her experiments on his body to find out the truth.' Felix thought to himself.

'He kept repeating that you are his other half over and over again, do you think it's possible that you guys might share some similarities in your DNA?' Asna wondered.

'He does look like me, so it's not far-fetched.'

"When you manage to create his clone, give me a piece so I can restart my hunt." Fenrir informed before taking off to the sky.

He wasn't tasked to just kill Lucifer once and leave it be, but make his life a living hell until the day Felix finished his training and dealt with him properly.

If only Lucifer was able to bleed, neither Fenrir nor Lady Sphinx would have gone through this much trouble to just get some of his DNA.

But, during his battle, Lucifer either didn't get wounded or when he was injured, he expelled evil energy instead of blood. With Fenrir equipped with a powerful scent of Lucifer, he would be able to track him down through his insane sense of smell as long as they were in the same galaxy.

As a primogenitor from the wolf species, not a single primogenitor could compare to him in this department.

***

While Lady Sphinx and Fenrir were dealing with Lucifer and the SGAlliance taking care of the spreading demonic plague, Felix could be sitting in a mediation position while having more than

hundreds of runic pages in front of him written in a hazy transparent glow.

Those were the runic sequence needed to learn and master to activate the infamous lesser time spell, Timeflow Delay! He was staring at those runic letters through none other than his wisdom eyes.

As he stared at them, Selphie's last words before she left the galaxy resounded in his mind.

"Remember, the key to mastering time spells isn't memorization. You might have gone away with it with the space element and other less complex elements, but time spells runes are much more complex, and memorization and repetition will merely help you learn the spell but not master it."

"As much as I hate to admit it, it all depends on your comprehension of runes and if your comprehension is extraordinary, you will be able to create a great connection with the runes and they will respond to you."

"If it's lacking, no amount of hard work will help and my teachings won't be too useful since each one has their own unique comprehension of runes and it can't be copied."

"Runes might seem like nothing but mere letters created out of elemental particles, but I firmly believe that they are alive and you should treat them as such."

This was Selphie's last lesson with Felix after finding out that he had finally decided to give time spells a chance. As she mentioned, her teachings wouldn't really help Felix that much if his comprehension was lacking.

Right now, Felix had proven to have an amazing runic familiarity with time runes, a cheat method to forcefully master spells through repetition and hard work, but his comprehension was always deemed trash compared to even other elves.

This was the reason Felix was delaying learning about time spells as he didn't want to waste his time on something unmasterable. But now?

"This is really one of the greatest cheats I have ever seen..." Felix commented with a wide grin as he used his wisdom eye to simplify the runic sentences, allowing him to comprehend their content on a much easier level.

It was like turning abstract Algebra into solving linear equations in terms of difficulty for a mere high school student.

The student still had to be the one solving the problem, but he would be doing it on a simpler difficulty at his own level!
