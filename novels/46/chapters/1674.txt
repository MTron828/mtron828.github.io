Chapter 1675 The Celestial Ceremony. I

1675 The Celestial Ceremony. I

A Decade Later...

As the celestial ceremony commenced, the capital city of the Eternal Kingdom was alight with vibrancy and fervor unseen in what felt like forever.

The air was thick with anticipation, the streets a tapestry of colors and sounds as citizens from every corner of the kingdom converged in celebration.

Boom!! Booom!! Booom!!

Fireworks exploded in the sky, painting the heavens with cascades of luminescent splendor, their reflections dancing in the eyes of the gathered throngs.

The streets, lined with banners and lights, were alive with activity.

Musicians played melodies that resonated with the very fabric of the universe, while dancers moved with grace, their forms blurring the lines between physical and ethereal.

Artisans and vendors filled the air with the scents of exotic foods and the allure of arcane artifacts, each stall and performance a testament to the diversity and richness of the kingdom's many realms.

At the heart of the city, the celestial palace towered over the festivities, a monument to the power and glory of the cosmos.

Here, atop its highest spires, the unigins sat upon thrones of starlight and shadow, their majestic forms a beacon to all who gathered below.

There were only the lesser celestial realm unigins...The upper celestial unigins and the three rulers had yet to make an appearance.

"How are you feeling about this?" Artemis asked her peers with a gentle tone.

"Don't overthink it, Arty." Aeolus said as he enjoyed the festivities below in the streets, "This is just like any other ceremony. We trade out celestial energy for divinities, have fun fighting each other for some bets, and get separated again until the next ceremony arrives."

"He is correct." Demeter remarked calmly, "The Paragon won't be making an appearance today unless he seeks his death."

"I don't know..." Artemis murmured, "I have been watching his journey closely in the mortal world and he always takes unnecessary risks. The weird part? He always makes them work somehow..So."

As one of Felix's avid fans with Apollo in the unigins circles, she was more in tune with his personality than the others could realize.

This made her have a tingling feeling that he was going to do something in the ceremony even when the odds were stacked against him.

The others didn't think the same at all.

"You are reading too much into this." Athena shook her head, "He is no longer a child. This is the real stuff and he knows that if he dares make his move, he better be prepared to not walk out of here alive. It's too much of a risk for anyone and only pure idiots would go for it."

"Just enjoy the ceremony Artemis." Zeus advised with a solemn tone, "Don't let his existence play games in your mind. We are unigins, we are above such emotions."

"Alright..." Armitis nodded in understanding and switched her focus to the worshipping rituals down there.

They were conducted with solemn reverence, a collective homage to the three rulers and the unigins who sustained their existence.

Performers enacting the stories of the kingdom's foundation, and the battles of unigins captivated the audience, their narratives a blend of myth and truth that enthralled and enlightened.

As celebrations reached their zenith, the atmosphere was electric, charged with anticipation for the arrival of the upper celestial unigins.

First to make her entrance was Eris, the goddess of order and disorder.

She glided into the venue with a grace that belied the chaos she commanded...Taking her seat, a hush fell over the crowd, a mixture of awe and apprehension palpable in the air.

The unigins greeted her with a casual tone since Eris was known for being not so formal.

"Will the other two make it?" Zeus inquired.

"Urunus has told me he will participate out of boredom, but I don't know about Ares." Eris replied calmly, "You know him, he must be sleeping somewhere outside of the kingdom."

"It's truly been a while since we saw him." Artemis chuckled in amusement, "I have never seen a unigin commanding two of the most powerful laws in the universe, yet spend most of his time in a slumber willingly."

"The three rulers should count their blessings our strongest is a lazy waste," Poseidon sneered.

"Bold words, I can't wait to see you repeat yourself in their face when they arrive."

Suddenly, a rough cosmic voice resounded into the depth of the unigins' souls out of nowhere.

Recognizing the owner of the voice, everyone'sattention was drawn to the skies as Uranus, the Unigin of the Cosmos, made his grand entrance.

He descended from the heavens themselves, a swirling vortex of stars and nebulae trailing in his wake!

Uranus's presence was commanding, his form enveloped in a cloak of deep space that twinkled with constellations.

His eyes were like twin suns, burning with the power to create and destroy...Representing laws such as Vibration, Radiation, Gravity, Dark energy, and Magnetokinesis!

He embodied whatever was left of the fundamental forces that bind the universe, which didn't already have a unigin representing them.

This made him one of the most powerful beings in the cosmos and a rightful owner of the title...The Sovereign of The Cosmos.

As he took his place among the unigins, a sense of grandeur and boundless potential filled the space.

"Uranus...You haven't changed, your head is still stuck deep within the three rulers' asses." Poseidon mocked instead of getting threatened, "Your name fits you like no one else."

"How funny."

Uranus' expression remained indifferent, unbothered by Poseidon's mockery...He placed one leg above the other and gazed at everyone near him with a sense of displeasure.

"How could you allow a recently ascended mortal to have such control over you, even to the point of killing Hephaestus and getting away with it?" He chided with an icy stare, "Yet, you dare greed over an upper celestial position...How ridiculous."

Zeus and the others had their expressions turn for the worse, but alas, they had no retort against his claims.

While they had nothing to do with Hephaestus' death, the fact that it happened in their presence and nothing was done about it until now was indeed a bit embarrassing for them.

"That's enough, Uranus." Eris intervened before the situation could turn for the worse, "We are here to celebrate another cycle and have some decent entertainment...Don't ruin it for me."

"Just for you, Eris." Uranus repeated with a suppressed tone, "I will let it go just for you."

Poseidon and the rest could only give him cold stares in silence, knowing that Uranus was the only unigin who could be genuinely said to have sold out to the three rulers.

While the rest of the unigins were in a beneficial partnership with the three rulers and could turn against them at the first notice of inconvenience, Uranus was an avid supporter of the three rulers' end goal.

He sought his freedom just as hard as the three rulers and would do anything to achieve it. So, to hear that his peers had failed such a simple mission of recovering Asna's core and even ended up losing one of their own didn't sit well with him.

If it wasn't for the three rulers' desire to also have the unigins slain by Felix and have their cores absorbed, they would have sent him next immediately.

Speaking about the three rulers, the moment had arrived that everyone had been waiting for as the fabric of reality itself seemed to fold high above the celestial palace, causing everyone to look upward with bated breaths.

In an instant, a dimensional pocket unfolded like the petals of a cosmic flower, revealing the pathway to the universe's very heart.

From this ethereal gateway, a tide of pure celestial energy surged forth, a luminous wave that cascaded over the assembled masses.

It was as if the essence of life and the cosmos had been distilled into a single, overwhelming rush, invigorating every being it touched.

Faces lifted in awe, and hearts swelled with an indescribable sense of renewal and vitality.

Then, amidst the collective breath of thousands, three radiant points of light emerged from the dimensional portal, falling gracefully toward the heavenly palace.

The crowd erupted into a cacophony of cheers and shouts, a resounding chorus that filled the air with fervor.

"All hail the three rulers!"..."All hail the three rulers!"..."All hail the three rulers!"

The reverence and adoration were palpable, a shared sentiment that unified every voice in exaltation.

While the unigins had their citizens, the majority were still considered nonaffiliated and under the direct rulership of the three rulers.

Most of them resided in the capital city and the cities around it, which meant this moment, was extremely significant for them.

As the three luminous beings took their places at the zenith of the heavenly palace, their brilliance intensified, casting the entire city in a divine glow.

These were not merely points of light but the embodiments of cosmic sovereignty, beings of unparalleled power and wisdom, whose very presence was a blessing upon the realms they oversaw.

Perched at the highest vantage point, they surveyed their domain, guardians of order and architects of fate, their gaze encompassing the entirety of the celebrations below.

"They are as dignified and fearsome as the first time I saw them," Athena remarked with a solemn tone.

The rest of the unigins felt the same...Even Poseidon with his loud mouth kept his words to himself, not daring to repeat what he said before.

He saw the three rulers from one ceremony to another and every time, he was reminded of the difference in power and social status between them.

If unigins were considered as gods for mortals, then, the three rulers, were the gods of the gods in terms of presentation and aura.

Just as the unigins were about to go up and greet the three rulers personally, a radiant beam of light was released from the gateway.

Within this beam, a figure emerged, enveloped in a cloak of light so pure it seemed to draw the very essence of the cosmos around her.

Her appearance was both serene and powerful, a paradox made manifest, as she stepped into the realm of the physical, crossing the threshold from her dimensional exile.

"This..."

"Am I seeing right?"

"It can't be?"

The unigins were left stunned as they traded glances with each other, seemingly seeking clarification from the other.

None of them expected Asna to be released from her imprisonment to join the ceremony as they knew that this would allow her to link up with her core!

Unbeknownst to them, even Felix and the tenants spectating the event through his far-reaching senses were left frozen the instant Asna entered their view.

That's because this would change most of their prepared plan!

Yet, Felix didn't seem to care about that at the moment.

"Asna..."

Felix muttered with a voice filled with longing, reaching his outstretched hand into the nothingness, seemingly trying to hold her cheek.

Alas, nothing was on the other side...
