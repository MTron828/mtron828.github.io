'A foreigner has been detected. Do I have permission to take him down?' Queen Ai asked monotonously as she pointed multiple plasma defensive weapons at Lucifer.

'No need.'

Felix ordered for the weapons to be pulled back...Then, he sized up Lucifer from the bottom of his head with an intrigued expression.

"The resemblance is even more uncanny face to face."

Felix commentated as he began walking around Lucifer and even bringing his face close to him, appearing like he had not an ounce of fear for his safety.

It was understandable as he was a mere sand clone and if Lucifer wanted, he could have killed him with a mere sneeze.

'Ask him of his reason for coming here.' Asna said with an interested tone, 'He also mentioned something about his destined other half.'

Just as Felix wanted to voice his question, Lucifer walked past him and sat on the captain's chair in the cockpit.

He looked at the front window that was reflecting the nearest chaotic battlefield between demons and the alliance's fleets.

"I have to say that I am fairly disappointed that you have come here with a mere clone." Lucifer sighed, "I have dreamed of this day for a very, very long time, and as much as I am not a romantic type, I would have loved for our first meeting to be perfect."

"..."

"..."

"..."

Felix's tenants were left glancing at the sky speechlessly.

"Destined other half, waiting for a long time, romantic meeting..." Felix's eyelids twitched, "Brother, I don't swing that way."

"Swing where?" Lucifer knitted his eyebrows in confusion.

"...Just forget it." Felix sat next to him and asked with a solemn tone, "Now, are you planning to tell me what are you doing here?"

In Felix's eyes, all of the things that Lucifer had mentioned were nothing but useless blabber and he had no intentions of believing them.

"I came to persuade you to meet me with your main consciousness. You see, the fate of the universe kinda depends on it." Lucifer confessed casually.

"Enough of being cryptic and come clean." Felix got irritated as he felt that Lucifer was messing with him.

The fate of the universe depended on their meeting? It sounded like a joke to anyone.

'He is being honest.' Lady Sphinx shared with a curious tone.

She was already intrigued with Lucifer and Felix looking alike and now that the situation had developed this way and Lucifer was using such big words, she could smell secrets revolving around their 'coincidental resemblance'.

'Honest, but how can that be?' Felix frowned.

Although he was still skeptical, Felix decided to play along this time.

"Mind clarifying?"

"Unfortunately, that's a conversation that can be had only if we met face to face." Lucifer shook his head.

'He invaded my spaceship and started spewing nonsense and now that I asked him to clarify, he refuses?' Felix's upper lip twitched. 'Is he hit in the head?'

"I know what you are thinking and I promise you that the truth will blow your mind." Lucifer smiled, "So, what do you say?"

"Say what?"

"Will you meet me?"

"No."

"Why not?"

"I am busy."

"How can you be busy when I just told you that the universe's fate depends on us?"

"I am not interested in your fantasy...Universe's fate? Tsk, bold words from a mere demon. Your confidence and pride sure know no bounds, I give you that." Felix sneered.

Although his master ensured him that Lucifer wasn't lying, that didn't mean Lucifer couldn't be convinced in his own fantasy and believe it as the truth.

Something as the universe's fate was way above a demon's payday.

"I guess you don't believe me, huh?" Lucifer shrugged his shoulders, "Since you have no intentions of meeting me peacefully, you give me no other option."

"What do you mean?"

"You will understand soon...Look there." Lucifer pointed his finger at the nearest chaotic space battlefield and suddenly uttered, "Wicked Emanation."

The space battlefield lay engulfed in chaos as the forces clashed, ships blazing and soldiers fighting fiercely. Above the carnage, dark red storm clouds swirled ominously, crackling with malevolent energy.

Suddenly, a deafening roar echoed through the void, sending chills down the spines of both the living and the machines of war.

From the depths of the cosmic abyss, a massive crimson-red mist materialized, billowing forth with an ethereal force!

Its tendrils snaked through the vacuum, eclipsing the stars with its malevolence. As it descended upon the battlefield a foreboding sense of doom washed over all who witnessed its arrival.

"Is that...Impossible."

Felix's eyes widened in shock at the sight of the mist advancing like a relentless sandstorm, its scarlet hue flickering with an otherworldly glow.

As it swept across the battlefield, the once pristine metallic structures corroded and crumbled, consumed by its wicked influence...What's worse? Soldiers in the path of the mist writhed in agony as their flesh blackened, and their eyes glowed with an unholy red.

The demons of the mist materialized grotesque and twisted creatures from the darkest realms of existence. Their eyes burned with a malevolent fire, and their twisted forms exuded an aura of pure evil.

With unearthly screeches, they descended upon both sides of the conflict, turning friend and foe alike into mindless instruments of destruction...

The once-organized battle formations dissolved into chaos as soldiers succumbed to the demonic influence.

Their weapons turned against their former comrades, tearing through ranks with terrifying efficiency. The crimson mist seemed to empower the demons, their strength growing with each life claimed by their unholy assault.

Amidst the chaos, the remaining soldiers fought desperately to resist the encroaching malevolence. But the mist was unyielding, seeping into every crevice, corrupting even the strongest wills. Fear and despair spread like wildfire, threatening to consume the battlefield entirely.

Those few who managed to escape the immediate grasp of the mist clung to their diminishing hope, rallying together against the demonic onslaught.

Even though Felix wasn't there, his soul could hear the sound of desperate cries and defiant roars echoing through the now blood-red haze.

In less than a minute, the once chaotic battlefield with thousands of spaceships was no more...

Ring Ring Ring...

Felix's bracelet rang like crazy, disrupting the silence in the cockpit...Felix didn't need to pick up the call to know what it would be about.

With murderous cold eyes and fists tightened until his fingers were about to penetrate his palms, Felix 'calmly' silenced his bracelet and turned to look at Lucifer.

"What did you just do." He asked with a suppressed tone.

"Give you some motivation to take my words seriously." Lucifer replied indifferently, "You see, the only reason I haven't already ended this war and demonized your precious people is because of you. I wanted us to handle this as privately as possible, but you are twisting my arms with your stubbornness."

"Is that your response?" Felix said with bloodshot eyes.

While the situation in the cockpit was peaceful and calm, Felix knew that more than ten thousand soldiers hadn't just met their fate, but even worse, they were demonized for eternity, taking away even the dignity of having at least an honorable soldier's death.

To make matters worse, he saw them getting picked up by other lesser demons on their space monsters and taking them to another battlefield to fight their own people!

This truly had pissed off Felix more than anything, especially when the culprit was sitting next to him and continuing to spew such confusing crap.Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

'Nimo, lock him inside the void realm but don't kill him!'¬†

So, he ordered Nimo through his other wisp of consciousness inside Nimo's mind, having absolutely no intentions of continuing the discussion with this madman.

Eee Eee!

Obedient as ever, Nimo launched solid void chains from multiple small void rifts appearing around Lucifer.

The chains went through the captain's chair and connected themselves with Lucifer's limbs, causing him to get captured.

Then, he was dragged inside a hard void prison cell that was inside the void realm through a rift before closing it down.

All of this happened in less than a split second, making it impossible for even Felix to see through the whole capturing process.

Eee Eee!¬†

Nimo popped off on Felix's lap with a wide cute grin, clearly asking for praise over his work.

Felix patted him on the head while having a cold expression.

'This might not be enough to kill him, but it will keep him away from the war for a w..'

"What kind of creature is that? Why does it have a slightly familiar feeling with mother?"

Alas, Lucifer interrupted him yet again from the back with an intrigued expression.

When Felix turned around and saw that he hadn't lost anything, he didn't know what to think anymore.

"How?"¬†
