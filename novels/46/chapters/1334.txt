1335 The Favor From A While Back.

"I am still as lost as ever." Felix smiled wryly.

Felix never announced his decision on his last bloodline due to the choices expanding immensely compared to the last time.

During his sixth replacement, he decided between the destruction element and the vibration element, but now that he knew about the free limited manipulation after becoming an origin bloodliner, this made him realize that he could pick even alive primogenitors!

In other words, he could even use any of the darkins' bloodlines and even the alive elemental lords' bloodlines!ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

There was only one issue with the latter. He still needed to obtain permission and it was doubtful that death, life, time, illusion, and creation primogenitors would allow him to get their elemental domain.

"The most ideal bloodline to choose must be related to the mental, such as darkness, charm, sound, illusion, and even vibration." Asna disclosed, "You already have offense, defense, mobility, and flexibility covered. The only thing lacking is a bloodline capable of helping you toughen your mental defenses and attacks to a deity level."

"I know." Felix nodded.

While the list seemed to have blown out to tens of bloodlines, Felix had to eliminate any element that conflicted with one of his elements.

For example, he couldn't use Roc's bloodline since he had no need for wind manipulation at his current strength.

Light manipulation was also out of the discussion since the elemental manipulation was lost and possibly the only method to get it back was by finding another egg.

Even awakening Amaterasu through filtering his descendants' bloodlines was useless since he didn't have the manipulation to give out anymore.

"Charm is out of the question as Kumiho will never give me permission and it's best to not add another primogenitor enemy by going for it forcefully. Plus, I can't see myself using charm abilities." Felix knocked down his options, "Darkness is a valid option. Wendigo is known to be in the top five strongest mentalists in the universe. Also, I don't need to worry about his permission."

"But, the darkness element is quite limited in the mental capacity." Thor clarified, "Wendigo is the one who made the darkness element be feared in terms of mental warfare, which means you won't be able to reach the same height as him without his teachings."

"Well, I don't think there is much of an option here." Felix sighed, "I don't have time to find ways to get my hands on vibration primogenitor's bloodline when you told me that she died billions of years ago without leaving any descendant behind. The illusion element is also out of the picture since the illusion primogenitor is still alive and won't give me permission to use it."

When Felix was given the option to choose between destruction and vibration, at that moment, he had all the time in the world to invest in finding out about the vibration primogenitor's bloodline. Whether he failed or succeeded, it didn't matter much.

But now? He couldn't afford such luxury when Lucifer was running a rampage in his territory.

"I guess darkness it is?" Asna cursed under her breath, "I still don't like the thought of you sharing that bastard's bloodline."

"Neither do I, but I have to be strong in all departments before I meet with the darkins." Felix said with a cold tone, "I can't give them a single chance to win."

Felix knew that becoming a deity didn't entail that he would be able to kill the darkins...It simply meant being finally given the chance to stand before them without being played like a toy.

Lucifer's score against Fenrir was enough proof.

If Felix's mental fortitude was lacking, Wendigo alone would make him regret the day he decided to fight them.

Just as Felix was to conclude his decision, Lady Sphinx placed her closed book on the table and shared calmly, "There are no guarantees, but I can try to get you permission from Lord Loki."

"Huh? You can?" Felix raised an eyebrow in surprise.

"Sphinx, you will be wasting your time, you know that irritating trickster will never agree without a worthy trade." Thor shook his head.

"He is right." J√É¬∂rmungandr supported, "This is giving up on his ultimate ability in addition to a limited manipulation, he will most definitely rip you off if he had an offer in mind."

"Don't worry, he owes me one from a while ago."

Lady Sphinx showed a faint smile as she recalled her last meeting with Lord Loki.

****

Flashback to the time of the darkins' assassination attempt failed at Felix...

"How did he get his hands on a drop of my blood?" Felix knitted his eyebrows, "It's impossible for him to get the data from our fight in the primogenitor's event as everyone's DNA is encrypted by Queen Ai. I doubt anyone possessed my blood besides Lady Sphinx."

"I know how they did it." Lady Sphinx spoke with an irritated tone as Lord Loki's playful expression surfaced in her mind.

"Who?"

"Don't worry about it, I will handle it."

The instant Lady Sphinx said this, she switched her focus to one of her many clones inside the

UVR...Then, she contacted Lord Loki and set up an immediate meeting with him.

Lord Loki agreed to the meeting and gave her an invitation link.

When she clicked on it, she was taken to a living room that exuded an air of streamlined minimalism and was dominated by holographic displays.

"Loki, we need to talk," Lady Sphinx said, her voice cutting through the soft ambient sounds of the futuristic living room.

Unlike other elemental lords, she didn't address him formally with his title.

Lord Loki, lounging in the morphing smart chair, glanced at her, his usually mischievous demeanor dimmed. "What's the matter, Sphinx?"

He didn't bother playing tricks with her as he did with the darkins as he knew that it was useless against her vision.

In this entire universe, there were few capable of making Lord Loki become docile and respectful... Lady Sphinx was at the top.

Her truth vision made his illusion abilities obsolete entirely, which meant he could do nothing against her even if he utilized his illusion domain!

"You know why I am here. You crossed the line, Loki." Lady Sphinx stated with a cold tone, "You handed a blood drop or something similar to the darkins to be used to track my student's location."

He blinked, feigning surprise, but Sphinx wasn't fooled. "Oh, that? I assumed you knew. All's fair in love and war, right?"

Her eyes narrowed a soft growl echoing in her throat. "This isn't a game, Loki. You had no business in our conflict and you still shoved your nose in it. The only reason you were allowed to do as you please with this project of yours is due to your neutrality."

"What do you think our peers' response will be when I tell them that you have broken it?"

"You are still as overbearing as ever, Sphinxy." Lord Loki chuckled, "Make your price."

Lord Loki wasn't scared of Lady Sphinx, but at the same time, he really didn't want to make this bigger problem by bringing in the rest of the primogenitors.

All of them knew that he was running the UVR from the shadows. The only reason they remained silent about it was because he never got involved in their business and stayed in the shadows.

But, leaking private information to an enemy to tip the scale of a conflict?

Not a single primogenitor would trust him and they might even come to the conclusion that the UVR's existence wasn't in their favor anymore.

Lord Loki had no intention of creating such a massive headache for himself after going through so much to prepare for the main event.

"First, you will never get involved again in my student's life. As for the price? I will let you know when I need something from you." Lady Sphinx narrowed her eyes. "Loki, when I come to you, I expect full cooperation."

"No need to get serious." Lord Loki promised with a playful smile, "You know that my word is dear to me."

"We will see about that."

With that statement, Lady Sphinx left the meeting and switched her focus back to the clone in Felix's consciousness space, joining the discussion as if nothing happened...

****

The Present...Back in the same living room.

"It's time for you to pay." Lady Sphinx stated with a calm tone.

"So soon?" Lord Loki raised an eyebrow in surprise, "Don't tell me you guys have given up on killing that demon and came for my help? If so, I will be really disappointed at such an anticlimactic ending."

For Lord Loki to speak like this, only meant that he was confident in his ability to end Lucifer's reign even with his peculiar immortality!

"No one is giving up on anything." Lady Sphinx informed, "I want your permission for my student to use your bloodline in his cultivation."

"Oho? Doesn't that mean he will obtain my illusion domain? In addition to a limited illusion manipulation?" Lord Loki chuckled, "Isn't that a bit too steep for a favor?"

Lady Sphinx wasn't surprised that Lord Loki knew this much as his means of gathering information was unlike any other.

If he wanted, he could easily use the consciousness link between Felix and Queen Ai to invade his dreams or memories to get what he desired without anyone knowing about it.

The only method to avoid all of this was to not use AP Bracelet or the UVR, which was impossible with all the utilities they provide.

Without them, Felix wouldn't have accomplished even 40% of his current achievements...It was just not an option at all.

"I told you that when I come to you, I expect full cooperation." Lady Sphinx said with a flat tone, "You said your word is dear to you, now prove it and make it happen."

"You have come to me with such a request even when you know what I did to my descendants?" Lord Loki showed a hidden sinister smile. "You sure fear nothing."
