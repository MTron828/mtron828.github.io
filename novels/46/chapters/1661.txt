Chapter 1662 Awakening The Sleeping Beauty.

1662 Awakening The Sleeping Beauty.

Meanwhile, in distant areas of the universe, Felix's friends, including Selphie, Olivia, Noah, and Carbuncle, paused in their activities as the thunderclap reached them...Their expressions shifted to one of awe and realization.

'He must be kicking ass up there.' Noah commentated with a little smirk before he continued on his eternal search, still nowhere close to reaching his little sister's spirit.

'Felix...I hope you are okay...'

Selphie and Olivia shared a bit of concern as they knew that the thunderclap could represent an achievement or an announcement...If Felix had fallen, they were certain the universe would announce it.

It sure announced something and that was the death of Hephaestus.

The rest of the people continued with their daily lives after a few minutes of wonderment, already used to such thunderclaps by now, it became part of their lives.

...

Back in the cave under the active volcano, Felix could be seen addressing his people.

"Due to certain circumstances, we are obliged to pack up again and leave this area." Felix announced with a solemn tone, "This time, we will need to be constantly on the move. Thus, we will ride on the world eaters and start journeying across the outer space of the wasteland nonstop."

Felix thought he could stay here for a day or two before they changed locations, but after he succeeded in the ascension, he knew that was no longer an option.

He was certain that the unigins would find their base in less than a couple of hours if they put their entire mind into it.

At least, if they were on the move, it would be much easier to react and escape than being stuck under a volcano.

Candace and the others had nothing to complain about and started packing up again.

After they finished, everyone moved up to the top of a symbiote and Felix commanded it to head up, away from the surface of the eternal kingdom.

This would minimize all chances for unigins to locate them as most of their reach was limited in the eternal kingdom.

After all, Artemis, Demeter, Aeolus, Zeus, and even Athena didn't have their related laws in outer space to send scouts and such.

After half a day of nonstop searching for Felix and his people across the entire surface area of the eternal kingdom's wasteland, all the unigins lifted their heads and gazed into the sky with an irked expressions.

"He is planning to slow down the game and stay on the low," Zeus expressed coldly, not too pleased with this result.

"I would have done the same in his position." Athena sighed, "He has taken advantage of us underestimating him to take down Hephaestus and steal his powers. Now, he knows we are in this for real and wouldn't come down unless he was confident in his preparation to take down at least two of us at once."

She was correct!

Felix's next plan was to lay low in outer space and get stronger by mastering his old and new laws before daring to target another unigin.

His fight with Hephaestus and talk with Eris made him understand that he needed to evolve his game at all costs if he wanted to keep going forward.

Otherwise, even if he had multiple laws, he would still fail to defeat another unigin who had control over a single law...Mastery and battle experience mattered way too much in those fights.

Especially, when the same strategy to farm up celestial energy in the celestial city wasn't going to work again.

"Don't give up on the search." Athena said with stern tone.

Although she understood it was a long shot they would be able to locate Felix ever again, it was better to keep trying than not.

Meanwhile, in the serene expanse of an ethereal realm, where time seemed to stand still, Asna lay in a state of deep slumber, her form enveloped in a gentle, luminescent glow.

She was the epitome of divine grace, her appearance exceeding the mere concept of beauty.

Asna's hair flowed around her like a cascade of liquid flames, shimmering with each subtle movement, reflecting the soft light that bathed her resting place.

Her skin glowed with an inner radiance, hinting at the immense power that lay dormant within her.

The universal thunderclap, its reverberations were powerful enough, they managed to awaken Asna from her slumber.

The moment the sound touched her, the serene glow that surrounded her intensified, as if responding to the call of the cosmos.

Asna's eyelids fluttered open, revealing eyes that held the depth of the universe within them. They sparkled with a myriad of colors, each shift of her gaze akin to witnessing the birth and death of stars.

As she rose from her resting state, the ethereal realm around her seemed to brighten, the very air charged with the anticipation of her awakening.

"He is here..."

Awareness flooded into Asna's consciousness, her thoughts immediately turning to Felix. A complex array of emotions played across her divine features—surprise, concern, but above all, an undying affection for the lover who dared to traverse the path of the celestials for her sake.

The reason of her emergence from slumber was twofold: the thunderous announcement of Felix's second ascension and the presence of her core now within the Eternal Kingdom.

She was forced into slumber in the first place because the eternal kingdom wasn't linked with the rest of the universe. But now? She could feel her core a little.

Asna stood, her form radiant and majestic, a goddess in every sense of the word.

"Felix," she whispered, her voice carrying a melody that could soothe the fiercest storms. "Where are you?"

She tried her best to access out to Felix, but to no avail. She came to realize that the celestial pocket dimension was also sealed from the eternal kingdom. This made her able to feel her core's presence, but not control it, send a message through it or anything of the sort.

While she couldn't communicate with him, Felix was able to feel her presence through her core the instant she opened her eyes.

It was like her core came slightly alive.

This sudden awareness struck Felix with the force of a comet, leaving him shocked, excited, and overwhelmed with a torrent of emotions.

His heart surged with a mixture of joy and longing, the sensation of Asna's presence igniting hope and desire he had kept carefully guarded.

Without hesitation, Felix reached out, calling into the vast expanse of the universe,

"Asna!" His voice, laden with emotion, sought to bridge the cosmic distances between them, to touch her, to confirm that the connection was real.

But his call met only the silence of the celestial realm, his words dissipating into the void without reaching Asna...

In that moment of poignant longing, Lilith remarked with a nonchalant tone, "Stop squandering your breath. She can't hear you, not as long as she persist in the celestial pocket dimension."

"It must be sealed too..." Felix sighed, the initial shock of Asna's faint presence giving way to a mix of frustration and resignation.

The reality of Lilith's words settled over him like a cold shroud. Despite the incredible journey he had undertaken, the barriers between him and Asna remained formidable.

"At least, you can feel her presence now." Thor comforted, "You know that she is awake and well."

Felix nodded with a faint bitter smile and ahand placed on his heart, feeling like Asna was with him again, watching over him like always.

For now, that was enough to keep him at peace...
