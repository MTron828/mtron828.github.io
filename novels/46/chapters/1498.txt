1499 Lord Hades vs Godfather Hephaestus. II

Without an ounce of hesitation, godfather Hephaestus hurled this luminous arsenal toward Lord Hades, their trajectory a blazing path of impending destruction!

The stars hurtled through the spirit realm, trailing incandescent tails of cosmic energy as they closed in on their target!

"IGNITE!"

Before they could cross half the distance, godfather Hephaestus snapped his finger, causing the array of stars to erupt one after the other into brilliant supernovas, each explosion a cataclysmic burst of energy and light!

The spirit realm itself quivered with the force of these celestial detonations, and the shockwaves reverberated through the cosmos!

"You either block and contain the force to minimize it or leave it to hit the heavenly plane!" Godfather Hephaestus laughed coldly.

Lord Hades, facing the impending onslaught, knew that it would be easier to turn into his spectral form and avoid the explosion entirely.

However, godfather Hephaestus was right. If he did this, the heavenly realm would be erased from the ground up and all the souls on it would be turned into wisps and thrown all over the spirit realm!

He had no plans of letting it happen under his watch.

With a focused and calculated motion, he summoned his mastery over the spirits and conjured a spiritual barrier of profound strength.

The barrier manifested as a shimmering, ethereal shield, resonating with the essence of the spirit realm and it manifested millions of kilometers around their battlefield!

As the supernovas collided with the barrier, they unleashed their formidable force, attempting to break it apart!

But, the barrier absorbed the explosive shockwaves and cosmic energies, quelling most of their fury and preventing them from wreaking havoc in the spirit realm.

Still, a bit of the shockwave managed to pass through the spiritual barrier and continue on its path.

Lord Hades narrowed his eyes dangerously as he glanced behind him and saw the fast-traveling shockwave in the direction of the heavenly plane.

Just as he wanted to use his spiritual control to switch the heavenly plane's location entirely to a faraway area, godfather Hephaestus appeared in front of him and thrust his massive fists forward, each encased in molten star cores!

"Didn't I tell you, eyes here!"

As they rocketed toward Lord Hades, the very essence of the stars fueled his attacks, making them a devastating force to be reckoned with.

Lord Hades ditched his plans to save the heavenly plane and switched to his ethereal form, seemingly weaving through the fabric of reality.

His ethereal nature allowed him to effortlessly slip between the fiery punches as if he were a wisp of smoke evading the tongues of a raging inferno!

Godfather Hephaestus's molten fists collided with the fabric of the spirit realm itself, sending celestial sparks and cosmic shockwaves rippling through the cosmos.

Lord Hades weaved, dipped, and twisted with supernatural grace, his form shifting and reforming in response to each attack.

Their battle was a mesmerizing dance of raw power and ethereal agility.

Godfather Hephaestus's punches, though mighty, found themselves striking empty space as Lord Hades effortlessly navigated between the blazing star cores.

In turn, Lord Hades launched ethereal counterattacks, weaving through the fiery maelstrom to deliver precise and calculated strikes.

Unfortunately, the divine shield blocked them all.

The spirit realm trembled under the intensity of their close-quarters combat, a cosmic spectacle that defied the laws of both the mortal and celestial realms.

It even seemed like such a combat would end with no winner as both unigins possessed way too many protective measures, making it impossible to fall under the hands of anyone.

Seconds went by and then minutes...Before long, both Lord Hades and godfather Hephaestus separated from each other and glanced in a single direction.

Their celestial pupils reflected the uncanny scene of the supernovas' shockwave finally reaching the heavenly plane!

'The plane will stand, but 80% of the spirits will be under its mercy.'

Lord Hades calculated the shockwave's destructiveness the instant it touched the edge of the heavenly plane, causing black lines to emerge on his forehead.

He also understood that his people would be harvested left and right by the angelic armies. If a much higher percentage of death was reached, the universe would switch the punishment to a forced slumber!

This was exactly what godfather Hephaestus wanted all along as he knew that it was impossible for him to slay Lord Hades!

All he was doing was hold him up and leave the rest to Duke Humphrey and his armies.

'I can't return to the heavenly plane and protect it. Hephaestus can create many new portals to the eternal kingdom now that the seal has been weakened. He will order his armies to hunt down the wandering spirits, which will lead to the same result.'

Lord Hades thought of a way to solve this on his own, but no matter which scheme he came up with, he realized that godfather Hephaestus had a way to stop it.

For example, he couldn't even switch godfather Hephaestus' location with another spirit due to the divine shield canceling his spiritual abilities.

"Haha! That's a nice expression you got there. It sure suits you." Godfather Hephaestus laughed in mockery as he launched another attack.

He knew that Lord Hades realized he was out of options and nothing he do would change the end result, which was being forced into a deep long slumber.

Even though godfather Hephaestus was literally screwing with the universal's order by fighting against Lord Hades, the universe would not punish him unless he actively erased a soul's existence.

That's why godfather Hephaestus was using celestial angelic armies instead of his own true followers in the eternal kingdom to avoid punishment.

Everything was already planned and calculated to the last second.

Still, Lord Hades' frown was turned into a faint cold smile as he blocked godfather Hephaestus' attacks.

"What are you smiling for?" Godfather Hephaestus knitted his eyebrows in displeasure.

"I am not the sole foe of the eternal kingdom around here."

Lord Hades' eyes reflected the sight of Asna, Felix, Elder Kraken, other spiritual elders, and the law enforcers, standing in the way of Duke Humphrey, Commander Nottingham, and his angelic armies.

While he couldn't do anything about the armies, the same could be said about Asna and the others!

"Don't tell me you are relying on Asnaleigha?" Hahahah!" Godfather Hephaestus roared in laughter like he heard the best joke in his life.

Before Lord Hades could respond, Godfather Hephaestus cut his chuckle short and proclaimed with a sinister grin, "I doubt she can even defend herself from what's about to come next."

"Don't tell me..." Lord Hades' expression turned cold.

"Hehehe, why do you think they have invested so much in my plan?" Godfather Hephaestus chuckled, "Let's see if you are lucky enough to be awake and spectate the show."

Before Lord Hades could react, godfather Hephaestus created more than a thousand stars this time and brought them all close to each other, making them resemble a sphere of fish roe.

Then, he uttered coldly, "Collapse."

Responding to his call, the stars collapsed upon themselves, compressing their luminous cores into an infinitesimal point in space...

The result was nothing short of cataclysmic—a black hole, a voracious singularity of unfathomable gravity, materialized in the midst of the spirit realm!!

The event horizon of the black hole radiated with an eerie and ominous darkness as if it hungered for everything in its vicinity!

While Saurous, the gravity primogenitor, could manifest a black hole out of his elemental energy, what godfather Hephaestus did was follow the lawful way to manifest one.

Blackholes were formed when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and undergo gravitational collapse, and godfather Hephaestus merely accelerated this process!

The gravitational pull exerted by this newfound cosmic entity was beyond comprehension.

It threatened to consume all in its path, warping the very fabric of space and time.

If this wasn't the spirit realm and almost all matter nearby was spectral, they would have drawn into its maw, spiraling inexorably toward the point of no return.

Even though it was supermassive, Lord Hades and godfather Hephaestus were still so much bigger than it, allowing them to resist its gravitational pull quite easily.

Still, Lord Hades wasn't too joyful about this as he understood that godfather Hephaestus created this black hole not to onslaught him, but to attack the heavenly plane!

Since gravity traveled at the same speed as light, he knew that it would take almost no time before everyone on the heavenly plane with a physical form to feel the change.

...

Unbeknownst to any of this, the heavenly plane's residents were still suffering from the shockwave's destruction.

Its speed and strength were reduced with the distance it traveled, but still, even the cities at the northmost part of the plane ended up falling apart.

Fortunately, the news reached them much quicker than the shockwave, which helped many cities to keep their citizens alive by simply turning to their spiritual forms until the storm went away.

Too bad for those in the capital, the shockwave came way too fast and most of them were already hiding under the rubble, causing them to get hit by it before they could turn their spectral forms.

Honestly, it wouldn't have mattered much as even those fast enough to make such a decision ended up getting hunted by the angels mid-storm through their divine abilities.

Right now, the capital city has turned into absolute ruins without a single skyscraper above ground...Most of the alive spirits and wisps were hiding deep under the rubble, not daring to get out even if they had a clear path.

The only ones bold enough to face the thousands upon thousands of angels' army were what was left of the government.

Right now, they were in a standoff against them high above in the capital's sky. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

'Asna, I think it's time to fill me in on the eternal kingdom and those so-called divinities.' Felix uttered coldly as his eyes were affixed on Duke Humphrey, 'I have no plans to lose to him ever again.'

The second chapter will be released later at night.
