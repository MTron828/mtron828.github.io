1323 A Song of Fire and Ice.

A couple of months later in the outside universe...

Fenrir, Noah, Olivia, Bodidi, and even Selphie decided to leave the Elementals Galaxy after learning more about the demons' invasion.

All of them wanted to offer their assistance in such a difficult time as it was getting harder and harder to contain the demonization in the SGAlliance.

It was like a plague without a cure and most nations could only seek destructive methods to minimize the demonization of their citizens.

Right now, it was believed that there were more than twenty billion lesser demons across the entire universe!

As for the animalistic demons? They were incalculable!

This wasn't done just by Lucifer alone as the remaining princes had sent their subordinates to the other side as well while they remained behind to defend their capitals.

Unbeknownst to them, the SGAlliance couldn't care less anymore about their territories at such harrowing times.

They had ordered most of their armies to return and help with containing the demonization before it goes out of control.

Fortunately, Felix and his void nation were proven to be an excellent shield against the demons due to the void realm being accessible.

This allowed them to use the billions of void creatures' army at their disposal...Since void creatures couldn't be demonized, they were the best counter to demons.

In addition, they also used The World Eaters and The Dreamers to devour any planet that had gone beyond saving.

Felix might not have participated in the war with his main consciousness, but he was sure of commanding the void army to give the demons a hellish time and save as many citizens as possible.

"Demon King, we still found no news about Maxwell's whereabouts. He is in hiding, which is somewhat unexpected due to his status." High Chieftain Lokaka reported with a solemn tone.

He was standing underneath a daunting five meters tall throne, radiating a palpable aura of malevolent authority that could shake the core of the most stalwart individuals.

The seat itself was covered with a dark crimson velvet cushion, giving a deceptive impression of comfort. The velvet, however, had a sinister sheen, and its plush texture felt oddly warm to the touch, almost like living flesh.

Demon King Lucifer was sitting on it with legs folded and hands placed on his kneecaps, seemingly in a meditation session.

This throne was situated in a ruined royal hall that used to belong to a centaur empire...But now? The entire planet was covered in a crimson hue and demons roamed everywhere, seeking whatever remained of purities to feast on.

Lucifer and his subordinates had taken it as a temporary base in the past month.

"I suggest we prioritize demonizing his human race as he will never stand back and watch them suffer." Clan head Ygos suggested with a wicked gaze, "He started an entire war against three races to protect them."

"Seconded." Clan head Azesdirth supported with a cold tone.

Because they had turned to demons, their hatred toward Felix multiplied a hundred folds and they desired his death more than anything.

Lokaka was humiliated during his fight against Felix and while he seemed to have let it go and turned a new page, his demonization had brought those evil thoughts back to the front.

There was no need to mention the clan heads' reasoning as they were still livid by Felix stealing the Elder Dragon's royal gemstone.

"Do it." Lucifer ordered without bothering to open his eyes.

"We won't let you down." High Chieftain Lokaka bowed for a moment before taking his leave with the others through a spatial portal.

'Did I come too hard on him and end up spooking him into hiding forever?' Lucifer knitted his eyebrows, 'It can't be, my other half isn't this cowardly.'

'He will show up sooner or lat...Hmm?'

Lucifer's danger sense tingled, forcing him to open his eyes and stare through the nonexistent ceiling.

From the quietude of the red heavens above, a shimmering, celestial ice dagger plunged earthward!

It was an ice meteor, an icy crystal boulder glimmering with an unearthly, iridescent light, as though a fragment of the aurora borealis had been cast down from the sky!

BOOOOOOOOM!!

In one cataclysmic instant, the ice meteor crashed into the royal hall, the impact resonating with a deafening thunderclap that reverberated throughout the fallen empire.

The already ruined hall exploded into shards and fragments, an eruption of marble and splintered wood, swallowed by an expanding cloud of chilling frost and stinging ice shards!

"Who's there?"

In one piece, Lucifer emerged from underneath the rubble as he was covered in potent evil energy. When it touched the ice meteor, it turned red in color and kept releasing a creepy fog.

"It wasn't easy to track you down."

Fenrir dropped down from the sky in his werewolf form while completely covered in chilling air...He seemed even more menacing than usual.

"Based on your element, werewolf form, and intense aura, you must be the ice primogenitor, Fenrir." Lucifer remarked with an intrigued tone.

"Now that you know, save us the trouble and surrender yourself." Fenrir said expressionlessly, "A friend of mine has prepared some fun time for you."

"I have no idea what you are talking about, but my people have told me that you belong to the same Asgardian faction as my other half. Was he the one sending you?" Lucifer asked.

"I take that as a no."

Straightforward as always, Fenrir didn't bother spending another second talking with Lucifer.

With an icy aura radiating around him, Fenrir stood tall, his figure composed of crystalline blue and white, an entity etched from pure frost...His eyes glowed with a cold, predatory light as they fell upon Lucifer.

When Lucifer saw that look, he understood that their conversation had finished and started emanating ominous energy, causing the air around him to shimmer with heat and palpable malice.

'Does Lucifer even have a shot?' Asna asked with a look of anticipation at the sight of those two primal forces poised for combat.

She was watching it with Felix and the rest of the tenants through Fenrir's consciousness link.

'He has zero chance of defeating Fenrir even if he was given a hundred million years more of training.' Thor smirked, 'When it came to combat, Fenrir had the most experience of us all as he lived his entire life in conflict.'

BOOOOOOOOOM!!!

The moment he finished speaking, Fenrir and Lucifer's confrontation began with the ferocity of a storm!!

Lucifer took the lead, his form streaking across the battlefield like a flaming meteor.

In response, Fenrir growled, his voice echoing through the ruins as he raised his paw, summoning a blizzard of chilling snow!

But Lucifer was prepared. He channeled his demonic energy, corrupting the icy onslaught into a storm of swirling, hellfire... Then, he turned around and sent it toward Fenrir.

The sky burned, and the icy constructs around them seethed with an unholy light, morphing into ghoulish figures of demonic fire, their hissing, and crackling filling the ominous silence.

"Not bad." However, Fenrir was not deterred.

He wielded his ice manipulation, pushing it to the limits. The world around them continued to freeze, a field of pure frost advancing toward Lucifer.

But as it crept closer, Lucifer summoned a vortex of his corrupting energy, directly clashing against Fenrir's onslaught.

A blinding explosion of steam and smoke erupted as the extreme cold met the fiery demonic energy, tearing through the battlefield!

The fight was a cataclysmic dance between fire and ice, time seeming to stop and surge at their will. The demonic empire around them shivered and burned in their wake, succumbing to their immense powers.

Truly, a saga was written in fire and ice amidst the ruins of a once grand royal hall!

"He is really holding up with his peculiar fighting style." Asna commented.

"The ability to turn elements into his own side it's too powerful." Felix nodded with a stern expression.

He could see that Fenrir's most powerful ice abilities kept returning to him in a different color each time.

It was immensely annoying and even though he wasn't the one fighting Lucifer, he could already see that he would make him go through hell.

"He is good for a demon, I give him that. But..." Thor shook his head, "It's not enough to defeat Fenrir."

In the heat of the battle, Fenrir took a step back, his cold, predatory eyes narrowing at Lucifer, who stood proudly amidst the fiery remnants of his demonic power.

"It's been fun while it lasted. It's time to end this."

The air between them crackled with tension as Fenrir raised his head, a chilling howl cutting through the chaos, resonating with an icy threat. "Hmmm?"

Suddenly, the world itself seemed to take a breath, an eerie silence falling over the battlefield as every flame flickered uncertainly.

The crimson sky appeared to dim, as though the sun itself was cowering before the impending power of Fenrir's ultimate ability.

Fenrir drew upon the deepest parts of his essence, the air around him turning so cold it seemed to shimmer.

A whirl of ice and snow, harsher and colder than any earthly winter, swirled around him, the snowflakes hanging still in the air as if time itself had halted... Then, with a final, resounding howl, he unleashed it - The Absolute Zero.

A wave of incomprehensible coldness, a frost unlike any other, erupted from Fenrir. It surged towards Lucifer, engulfing everything in its path! The icy wave froze the fiery battlefield, the demonic flames hissing and sputtering as they were extinguished and entombed in ice.

The once molten, flowing rivers of lava turned into static sculptures of obsidian, encapsulated in a sheen of frost. Even the evil energy in the air seemed to crystallize, the corrupted elements halted in their tracks, succumbing to the freezing cold!

Lucifer barely had a moment to react before the Absolute Zero seized him.

His demonic energy flickered, trying to fight against the tide of frost, but it was too late. His movements slowed, his fiery eyes widened in surprise, then... everything stopped.

Lucifer, the embodiment of fire and malice, was frozen in time, his form encased in a perfect tomb of crystal-clear ice, a statue of stunned defiance under Fenrir's icy dominion.

Even if he wanted to escape, there was nowhere as the world held its breath after Fenrir's ultimate ability froze everything into a timeless state!

The once crimson sky was now a frozen panorama of ice, the demonized empire an icy wasteland.

Every flame, every movement, every flicker of life was caught in an eternal tableau of frost.

Time and life on the planet stood still, held captive under the Absolute Zero, marking Fenrir's icy triumph over Lucifer.

"Dear goodness..." Felix, Asna, and Candace were seen staring with stunned expressions at Fenrir who was the only one moving in this timeless frozen world...

When he reached the frozen Lucifer, he placed him inside an icy blue tomb and threw him in his divine spatial ring.

Then, he took off outside of the planet and sped away, leaving behind him an entire planet halted in its orbit...
