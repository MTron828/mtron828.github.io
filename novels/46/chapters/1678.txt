Chapter 1679 For You...I Will Set The World on Fire.

1679 For You...I Will Set The World on Fire.

"Two at once?!" Candace was the first to suck a deep cold breath, "Is it your greed talking again?"

"Yes, but don't worry." Felix remarked calmly, "I am in full control this time."

Felix wasn't saying this to get the tenants off his back...He genuinely could feel his desire acting up the moment he realized that those two had brought their cores with them.

Since he had a sentimental connection to lightning and water, his desire was stronger than ever. Still, he was the one in control.

"How will you pull it off exactly?" Thor asked with a solemn tone.

"I will figure it out while on the move." Felix replied while standing up from his throne, "I don't have time to waste...It's the perfect time to kickstart the plan."

With a focused intent, Felix summoned six clones of himself, each a perfect replica imbued with his vast power and cunningness.

Felix and his clones all gazed into Asna's absentminded expression as she watched the ongoing battle. Then, they collectively murmured in their minds, 'I am coming...'

Without an ounce of hesitation, Felix summoned the equal trade symbol and wished to hide their existence from everyone temporarily, utilizing the same wish from before.

The instant the wish took place, Felix and his six clones were dispatched to the central zone of the kingdom, a vast expanse far removed from the bustling energy and divine presence of the capital city!

This area, while significant, was momentarily overlooked by the unigins, who were engrossed in the ceremonial proceedings and the display of might between Zeus and Poseidon.

However, the same didn't apply to the three rulers.

'The boy has made his move.'

'What an interesting child, he sure fears no one and nothing.'

'Leave him, let's see what he has stored for us.'

The three rulers traded glances amongst each other in silence and continued spectating the battle, not bothering to alarm anyone about Felix and his clones' disappearance.

In their eyes, Felix could be only after the unigins' cores and they didn't care how he achieved it, as long as he didn't touch them, Asna, or too much of their precious celestial energy.

Oh, how would they regret this decision...

Arriving simultaneously at predetermined points within the central zone, Felix and the clones began their task.

They stood still, their presence almost inconspicuous against the backdrop of the kingdom's sprawling landscapes.

Then, in a synchronized moment of concentration, they began to absorb the celestial energies that permeated the realm.

Before the temporary barrier could expire, the clones executed their next move with precision.

Utilizing the advanced teleportation granted by the wishes, they vanished from the central zone, reappearing instantaneously in front of the unigins' territories gates.

Those territories were Zeus, Poseidon, Athena, Aeolus, Demeter, and lastly, Artemis. The only territory untargeted was Apollo's.

Each clone, now a conduit of celestial energy, charged into the depth of those territories, taking advantage of the barrier to avoid the owners' detection.

Only Felix was left behind in the central zone. With a focused fearless gaze directed at the capital city, Felix uttered, "Teleport me."

Amid their epic battle within the dimensional pocket, Zeus and Poseidon' celestial battle caused the very fabric of reality to bend and warp under the intensity of their duel!

Without warning, the real Felix materialized within the dimensional pocket, his presence like a bolt from the blue!

His arrival was not heralded by storms or fanfare but by the sheer audacity of his action, teleporting directly into the heart of a conflict that had captured the attention of the cosmos!!! T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

The unigins, momentarily caught off guard, reacted with a mix of shock and disbelief.

"Huh?"

"The hell?"

"You got to be kidding me..."

These questions echoed silently among the divine assembly as they stared at Felix, trying to comprehend the implications of his bold move.

'Why...Why...He isn't stupid to do this...Think...Think...There must be something!'

Athena's keen gaze sharpened, her strategic mind already calculating the potential shifts in power dynamics Felix's arrival could signify.

She understood that for Felix to make a move, it implied that he was either a retard or someone with a horrifying plan.

"Hahahahaha!! As expected of my superstar! I knew you would never leave me to rot in boredom here!"

Apollo, ever the lover of drama and spectacle, couldn't help but let out a loud laugh, appreciating the sheer unpredictability Felix brought to the celestial ceremony.

Amid the confusion and the sudden pause in the hostilities, all eyes suddenly turned to Asna.

"Felix..."

The moment her gaze fell upon Felix, a cascade of emotions swept over her, breaking through the haze that had enshrouded her spirit.

Love, in its most pure and undiluted form, surged within her heart, a torrent of longing and affection that had been dammed by separation and silence.

Her amber eyes, luminous and wide with a blend of surprise and unbridled joy, locked onto Felix, seeing nothing and no one else in the vast expanse of the cosmos.

Time seemed to stand still for Asna as if the universe had paused in deference to the depth of their connection.

The sight of Felix, so unexpected and yet fervently desired, rekindled a flame within her that she feared had dimmed.

It was a reaction that transcended the divine, a soul-deep recognition that the other half of her essence, her partner across lifetimes and dimensions, stood before her once more.

At that moment, every strand of her being vibrated with an overwhelming desire to bridge the distance between them, to end the separation that had been an aching void in her existence.

'Oh no...no...no...'

Alas, this idea was killed off the instant her eyes captured the sight of the three rulers locking their emotionless blinding pupils on her man.

Fear, a bone-chilling sensation of fear coursed down her spine as she envisioned her beloved getting captured and tortured by the three rulers for all the crap he put them through.

Just as she reached out with her hand to the tiara, about to do something very stupid to bring the three rulers' wrath on her and leave Felix alone, a loving gentle voice resounded in her mind.

'My sadistic queen...I missed you like crazy.'

The instant Asna heard Felix's gentle voice, tears threatened to flood down her cheeks as she had been longing to hear him for eternity.

'Sob...Felix...Is that you...I missed you too...Sob...'

Her faint sobbing was like a dagger wedged at the depth of his heart, causing him immense pain and anger every time he heard it.

But, Felix didn't act on those emotions and kept them under control.

'Just hang tight, I will get you out of here even if it kills me. All I need you to do is maintain an eye on my signal and fall asleep.'

Felix's tone became cold the moment he felt the storm of Zeus and Poseidon's battle cease.

Before Asna could respond, Felix cut off the connection, which was established through a wish as well, since the seal around her head acted in the same manner as being in the pocket dimension.

Meanwhile, Zeus and Poseidon turned to regard the newcomer, their expressions a mix of coldness and curiosity.

"Paragon, I am starting to wonder if you have a screw loose," Posiedon remarked indifferently as he tightened his grasp on his trident, "To come here with Asna's core, you must really be taking a piss at us."

"For your own sake, I do hope that slaying Hephaestus hasn't inflated your ego to pull such a dumb move." Zeus added coldly while spinning his spear around his shoulders, "Otherwise, this dimension will be your grave."

In utter silence,Felix stood there with his back facing those two gods...He neither responded nor turned back.

He raised his hand high above and concentrated inwardly.

In no time, a vortex of celestial energy formed above his head, which transformed into a massive fireball of celestial black flames.

The dark light emanating from the fireball cast eerie shadows across the faces of Zeus and Poseidon.

With a flick of his wrist, Felix dispatched the fireball, its trajectory taking it beyond the confines of the dimensional pocket and toward the celestial capital city!

It streaked across the sky, a comet of foreboding doom, before crashing into one of the city's grand buildings.

The impact was immediate and slightly devastating, the black flames clinging to the structure with a voracious hunger, an embodiment of destruction made manifest.

As the gods and gathered citizens watched with puzzled looks as the building was consumed, Felix's voice, cold and resolute, cut through the chaos.

"For you...I will burn the world."

Even when his eyes weren't on her, Asna experienced her heart flutter at his declaration, knowing that he was directing it at her.

"Feli..."

Before she or anyone could react, with a snap of his fingers, the black flames, as if invigorated by his command, surged with newfound ferocity!!!

WHOOOSH!!

They spread like a plague, uncontainable and ravenous, each touch turning structures and beings alike into fuel for their insatiable appetite!

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAEGh!!!"..."ITTT HURRTTS!!!"....."MOOMMMYYY!!!"

The flames engulfed indiscriminately; not caring if it was a building, an adult, a child, or an animal...It engulfed anything and anyone bold enough to remain before its path.

Felix was no longer on the right path to mind who he harmed or killed...He was against the universe and this made him understand that mercy was no longer a luxury if he still cared enough to save his loved one.

As for feeling bad? He no longer had such emotions the instant he became the personification of evil energy.

Thus, those panicky and agonized cries signified nothing to him...

"How is this possible..."

"What the hell are those flames?!"

"They are capable of consuming celestial energy directly?! Not even white flames can do this!"

"The world itself bends to those flames; such power defies even our understanding!"

As the black flames devoured everything in their path, the unigins collectively gasped, their eyes wide with disbelief.

Alas, the worst had yet to come for them...
