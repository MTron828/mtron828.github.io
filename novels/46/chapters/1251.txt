Queen Alfreda was the first to make her move as she pointed a wooden thin wand at herself and created a defensive repelling gravity field to protect her from any projectiles fired at her.

Then, she pointed her wand into the sky and said calmly, "Omnipotent Light Spell, Star of Salvation."

A massive white runic hex manifested tens of kilometers above her head before a gigantic blinding spherical star emerged from it slowly.

In a few seconds at best, a new sun was introduced into the arena, forcing most of the viewers to squint their eyes as they looked at it!

"Star of Salvation! If it wasn't for Queen Ai dialing down the light intensity for us, everyone would have been blinded by now!" Sir Victoire commentated as he watched the spinning star.

While most viewers assumed that Queen Alfreda created this star to use it as a way to crowd control Felix, making it difficult for him to fight her under its burning and blinding intensity, in reality? She was starting her preparation!

"Omnipotent Water Spell, Cleansing Shower."¬†

With another small wave of her wand, rain clouds began manifesting under a giant blue runic hex in the sky before heavy raindrops showered many kilometers of radius around her!

With the Star of Salvation still illuminating as brightly, a breathtaking curved rainbow manifested in the sky for the enjoyment of the viewers.

But no one spent even a second of attention on it as Queen Alfreda waved her wand yet again, creating a vast green hex to appear on the ground this time.

"Omnipotent Nature Spell, Living Botany Kingdom." She murmured the moment the green hex finished completion.

Under the stunned and somewhat mesmerized eyes of the viewers, a chaotic world of lush greenery and untamed wilderness had risen from the ground and turned the boring arena into a fairyland!

Towering trees loomed overhead, their branches and leaves forming a dense canopy that blocked out much of the sunlight, but not the Star of Salvation's light.

The air was thick with humidity, and the scent of damp earth and decaying plant matter hung heavily in the air.

The ground was covered in a thick layer of underbrush, dotted with ferns and vines that clung to the trunks and branches of the trees.

With the neverending rain, the entire atmosphere made the jungle seem peaceful and welcoming.

Felix wasn't fooled by the jungle's serenity at all...Unlike most viewers, Felix had done his research on Queen Alfreda's previous battles, making him understand fully well what this entire setup implied.

'Water, light, nature, and accelerated growth spell.' Felix smiled, 'She went all out from the start.'

Thud!! Thud!! Thud!!...

Abruptly, thundering noise began escaping from the massive jungle as trees kept shaking and the ground tremoring.

Before the viewers could react, an army of humongous humanoids walking trees emerged from the depth of the jungle into the open!

The creatures stood at least fifty meters tall, their bark-like skin rough and knotted like old leather. Their limbs were thick and gnarled, their fingers ending in sharp, woody points. Their eyes were large and green, set deep in their wooden face.

Their faces had all sorts of unique expressions like they were trying their best to copy living emotions but failing at it horribly.

This army of trees wasn't alone as it was accompanied by a much larger army of flora living plants and even fungus!

Their bodies were made up of bark, leaves, flowers, and mushrooms. Some of them were bright in color while some seemed dim.

These plant people were a marvel to behold, with delicate flowers sprouting from their heads and bright, colorful fruits hanging from their arms.ReùíÇùíÇd the latest stories ùíên novùíÜlbin(.)com

Queen Alfreda arose from the jungle and into the air...With this living army of all unique families of plants under her, she resembled the goddess of nature.

She broke the silence with a single order, "Charge."¬†

Thud! Thud! Thud!...

Thousands of humanoid and beastified plants rushed in direction of Felix at the top of their speed with emotionless eyes.

They might seem alive, but clearly, they were more like plant golems than actual living plants with souls.

"Queen Alfreda has used three of her elements to create this magnificent omnipotent spell technique! As long as the Salvation Star is up and the rain keeps pouring, the jungle will keep giving birth to living plants for eternity!"

Sir Victoire commentated passionately as he watched the jungle that was continuously growing and expanding its territory on the arena!

Queen Alfreda might not have a monstrous talent like Selphie or a runic familiarity with a complex element like Time, but she was still a force to be feared!

She had an extremely high runic familiarity with water, light, nature, and gravity.

With her living for more than a hundred thousand years, she had already mastered everything there was to master about her runic spells!

She even began creating new runic techniques that require a perfect combination of two abilities or more from different elements.

This living kingdom was her signature masterpiece as it utilized artificial photosynthesis created from light and water to accelerate their growth!

"This looks cool and all, but King Maxwell can avoid her army by using his teleportation spell." King Treznor commented as he watched the game with some of his friends in the inner circle.

"Well, she already knows that she can't compete against him, so she is trying to at least demonstrate that she isn't a weakling...It's smart." Fishermen Queen Everley said.

The others nodded in agreement, knowing that this battle's results were already predetermined.please visit

"Hmm? What is he doing?"

The Fairies Matriarch tilted her head in confusion after noticing a massive golden hex manifest underneath Felix.

This caught everyone's attention as they assumed that he would be using spatial spells instead of sand ones.

Abruptly, massive quantities of sand began filling up tens of kilometers around Felix.

In less than a few seconds, a vast overbearing desert with golden dunes and windy sandstorms was manifested out of nowhere akin to magic!

"Omnipotent Sand Spell, Golden Pharaoh's Empire." Felix uttered under his breath as he gently lifted two fingers.

Before the viewers could react to the desert creations, solid sand pyramids rose from the desert like towering giants, their peaks reaching toward the cloudless sky!

Each pyramid was a marvel of geometry, with smooth sides and sharp angles that seemed to defy the shifting sands below.

The sun beat down mercilessly, casting harsh shadows across the dunes and making the pyramids shimmer with an otherworldly glow.

The three pyramids weren't there for decoration purposes as humongous sand guardians began to emerge from their surfaces.

The guardians had animalistic heads, and humanoid bodies, and were carrying different typed of weapons.

The moment they were born, thousands of sand soldiers were created around the pyramids, seemingly awakening to give those guardians their respected authority!

"Is Landlord aiming to launch a war against Queen Alfreda's plant armies?!" Sir Victoire exclaimed with a startled tone.

His reaction was shared by the rest of the stupefied viewers...They weren't as shocked about the Sand Empire as Felix's decision to not take the fast road.

In their eyes, he could easily ignore Queen Alfreda's armies and force her to fight him hand-to-hand. Sure, she had gravity in her favor, but it shouldn't cause Felix too much of an issue.

They were right in this sense...But, unbeknownst to them, Felix wanted to give Queen Alfreda a rightful stage for her dethronement!

'I finally see why Selphie is obsessed with him.' Queen Alfreda figured out Felix's motives immediately and couldn't help but feel appreciative of the gesture.

Now that her heart was filled with unconditional hatred toward Felix, she wasn't able to turn a blind eye to those good gestures anymore.

"Charge."

With a similar command from Felix, the pyramid's guardians, and their soldiers rushed in perfect formations in direction of the plant armies!

The scene on the battlefield was truly a sight to behold. An army of sand soldiers rushed from one side, their weapons gleaming in the sandstorm and their bodies glittering in the sunlight.

Meanwhile, the army of plant troops was rushing from the opposite side, with their bodies made of vines, leaves, and flowers and their weapons being sharpened branches and vine thorns.

The earth trembled beneath the weight of their footfall as the two sides engaged in a violent conflict!

BOOM!! BOOM!! CLUNK!!...

The sand soldiers assaulted their plant counterparts with fluid grace, their bodies changing and swirling like a sandstorm.

The plant troops, though, were no less dangerous; their thorned weapons easily pierced through the sand, and their bodies twisted and turned to deflect strikes!

Since both parties were soulless, there were no cries of pain as the sounds of wood and hardened sand weapons clashing filled the air.

The sand guardians locked in with the titan humanoid trees amidst the battlefield, causing the most casualties with their humongous overbearing bodies.

Still, the sand soldiers weren't affected by this as their broken bodies reconstruct to peak form after turning into piles of sand, unlike the plants' troops!

This made them fight with a ferocious determination, combining and moving their bodies to form new formations.

The plant troops, on the other hand, exploited their inherent skills to trap and ensnare their adversaries, turning the sand beneath their feet against them!

Since there were plants capable of healing, the fallen plant troops were left under their care.

This created a neverending conflict between two sides that knew no rest, no death, and no defeat!

The viewers were left with a sense of awe and beauty despite the turmoil and devastation.

It had gotten to the point, no one was cheering for either Felix or Queen Alfreda, but those lifeless but courageous soldiers!

Queen Alfreda knew that Felix wasn't going to wait patiently until the war was decided by those soldiers.

She decided to take it upon herself to make him understand that she was ready to step down as the Tenth Supreme.

So, she used her final and strongest spell in her arsenal.

"Omnipotent Nature Spell, Thousand Armed Wooden Celestial!" Queen Alfreda uttered as she pointed her wand at the massive jungle beneath her.
