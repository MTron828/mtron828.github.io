Chapter 1696 The Last Dance. IV

Ôªø1696 The Last Dance. IV

'Now!'

Amid the chaos of celestial energy and apocalyptic destruction threatening to engulf the Eternal Kingdom, the real Felix seized a moment of vulnerability and made his move at last!

With the rulers momentarily distracted by Asna's drastic action of breaking her sealing tiara and the ensuing spread of eternal black flames, he conjured a portal of swirling darkness right in front of the balcony, connecting the dreamrealm with the kingdom!

From this void, a sinuous tentacle emerged, aiming to trap Asna and whisk her away to safety, exploiting the rulers' preoccupation!!

Everything he had done and prepared was for this tiny, tiny moment of vulnerability, where he was certain that the rulers' senses would be too outstretched with all the chaos he brought across their land!

Whoosh!!!

As the tentacle coiled around Asna's waist, preparing to retract with its precious cargo into the protective embrace of the dreamrealm, time seemed to freeze.

The first ruler, amidst the pandemonium of collapsing defenses and the imminent threat of a kingdom-erasing explosion, turned his focus to Felix's daring rescue attempt.

With a voice that cut through the turmoil, chilling in its authority and devoid of emotion, he spoke a single word that halted all actions and silenced the chaos momentarily.

"Enough."

The weight of that command was palpable, resonating with the power to alter the course of events. It was a decree from one of the universe's most formidable beings, a command that froze time across the entire central domain!

The rushing apocalyptic explosion, the falling buildings, and even Eris were left affixed on her chair while flipping a page of her divine book.

The only things still moving were the void tentacle, the celestial black flames, the three rulers, and the collapsing divine protective barrier.

In less than a nanosecond, the first ruler's hand moved with a swiftness that defied comprehension, a golden blade materializing from the ether and slicing through the void tentacle and the portal with unerring precision!

The severed tentacle dissipated into the void from whence it came, its attempt to secure Asna thwarted by the ruler's decisive action!

As the connection was severed, Asna's form began a slow, graceless descent back to the ground.

Her vision, clouded and fading, caught a fleeting glimpse of Felix, standing on the other side of the collapsing portal, his expression one of shock and disbelief.

"Felix...Run..."

In these final moments, as darkness encroached upon her senses and her consciousness slipped away, she fell motionlessly to the ground, a silent witness to the thwarting of her beloved desperate rescue attempt...

The scene settled into a tense stillness, with Asna lying vulnerable and unconscious, her fate now squarely in the hands of those who hold dominion over this realm.

As the first ruler gazed into Felix's eyes through the portal with an untold amount of discontentment, he merely said, "Amun-Ra."

The instant the word left his mouth, time returned to normal.

The stillness that had gripped the surroundings shattered, allowing reality to surge forward at its customary pace.

The supernovas and the two unigins' spiritual explosion continued on their path of destruction, bringing absolute ruination to the wastelands of the eternal kingdom!

Unfortunately, the new protective barrier held strong and defended the key territories of the kingdom, not letting a single particle go through it!

But no one was focusing on this...Eris and the rest of the unigins had their eyes affixed on the remnants of the destroyed portal and the motionless Asna.

"Did, did he just attempt to rescue Asna right in front of the three rulers' eyes..."

Aeolus remarked with his mouth slightly agape, feeling like he had just witnessed the dumbest and most brazen move in the history of the universe.

"The eternal black flames, kidnapping Zeus and Poseidon, and now this..." Athena shook her head, "Everything to stretch the three rulers' focus thin and rescue Asna while they were distracted...It's a great effort, but, sigh."

She wanted to continue but all she could do was let out a long exhale in disappointment. She knew that even if Felix brought the entire eternal kingdom to a halt and tripled his efforts, the three rulers would never allow him to rescue Asna from under their noses.

It was an impossibility due to a simple reason.

"Desperation sure makes us do dumb things." Demeter said with a faint sneer, "The three rulers can boost their powers to infinity through celestial energy."

She didn't need to see what happened exactly to understand that the first ruler must have enhanced his reaction speed to another level, allowing him to make a swift counter-move even when his focus was 99% stretched thin!

"He should have listened to me..." Eris smiled bitterly.Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Her reaction wasn't because of the failure of the rescue mission...It was about the destiny awaiting Felix after pushing his luck far more than he could handle.

"Will he survive?" She murmured as her eyes were locked on the third ruler's empty chair.

The third ruler was nowhere to be seen in the capital city and Eris knew about his exact location!

...

Meanwhile, in the dreamrealm, where ethereal skies shimmered with colors that had no name, and the ground morphed from solid to mist, a sudden interloper stepped inside.

The instant Felix's eyes landed on the intruder, his pupils shrunk while his guard was heightened to the limit...Even the tenants felt chills course down their spine.

"Is...Is...Tha...t...A...Rul..er."

Candace's finger kept shaking while pointing it at the intruder, feeling like her heart was about to burst from terror and intimidation.

Her reaction was understandable as the blinding divine light that once shrouded the third ruler's figure began to dissipate as if melting away under the realm's unique laws.

Here, in a place where divinities held no sway, his true form emerged, no longer hidden by the divine brilliance that marked his presence in other realms.

"Amun-Ra, The Third Ruler and The King of the Gods," Lilith uttered his name with a cold gaze as unpleasant memories of her dealings with him flooded her mind.

Amun-Ra stood tall, with an imposing presence that filled any space he occupied.

His skin shimmered with a golden luminescence, reminiscent of a star's radiant glow, reflecting his aspect as Ra.

This ethereal light seemed to pulse with the life-giving energy of a star, casting a warm, benevolent aura around him.

Amun-Ra's eyes were like stripped twin white stars, piercing and wise, glowing with an inner fire that illuminated truths hidden in the shadows.

They held the depths of the universe, mirroring the endless skies and the mysteries they contained.

His attire was regal, woven from the very fabric of the cosmos. A cloak of midnight blue, embroidered with silver constellations, draped over his shoulders, representing the night sky that even the sun must traverse.

Beneath this celestial mantle, he wore a robe of radiant gold that flowed like liquid light, signifying his dominion over the day.

Upon his head sat a double crown, symbolizing his sovereignty over all realms‚Äîboth visible and hidden.

The crown merged the iconic elements of Ra and Amun, featuring a solar disk encircled by a cobra (representing Ra) and two tall plumes (signifying Amun), all set upon a band of cosmic darkness dotted with stars!

In his hands, Amun-Ra held the Ankh and the Was scepter, ancient symbols of life and power, and his two heavenly weapons.

The Ankh glowed with a soft, life-affirming light, while the rod was crafted from a material that seemed to absorb and refract the light of the universe itself.

His entire presence screamed of an untouchable entity who should be hidden from the eyes of mortals as none of them could handle his grandiose godly figure.

"Child, is this what you want?" Amun-Ra expressed with an emotionless tone, but the tint of anger could not be hidden from his eyes.

Even the most oblivious person could immediately sense that the third ruler was furious, and his arrival was not for pleasantries.

'Oh f*ck...'

As Felix gazed at the third ruler, his heart sank, a cold dread washing over him.

For a moment, time seemed to slow, the air thickened with tension and the weight of impending doom.

Felix's instincts screamed at him, a primal warning that the end was near, a confrontation he might not survive.

His hands clenched, his breath hitched, and in the depth of his soul, he prepared for a battle he knew could very well be his last...
