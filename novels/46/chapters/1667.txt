1668 Exploring The True Potential of Seven The Sins Laws. IV

Felix discerned that the only way for him to create a new symbol was to think out of the box and utilize assets that Lilith had no access to. NnÃªw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Otherwise, even if he spent the next million years developing one symbol after another, he would never be able to invent something new.

Lilith had billions of years to develop symbols while he had only a decade...It wasn't happening.

"Since Hephaestus's core was merged with the wrathful hydra dragon head, then I believe there must be a path to merge those laws in a symbol." Lady Sphinx supported Felix's theory.

"They are quite compatible with each other." Elder Kraken nodded.

Felix also recognized the compatibility between those laws and decided to start simple and explore them.

"Fire essence."

Felix's focus was absolute as he called forth the essence of fire, feeling the scorching blue flames swirl around him, a dance of potential destruction waiting for direction.

Then, he invoked a Wrath Symbol dubbed Dragon's Fury, causing a manifestation of a massive crimson dragon to emerge above him.

This dragon was utilized as an offensive attack instead of boosting Felix's strength. Felix wanted to use it multiple times in his previous battles, but, there were always better options.

"Are you planning to merge the dragon with fire essence?" Thor inquired.

"Yes."

Felix extended his hands, palms up, as the ethereal blue fire danced between his fingers, casting a surreal glow over his determined features.

"Fuse..."

With a whispered incantation, Felix released the essence towards the dragon.

The air around them tensed, charged with anticipation, as the blue flames met the dragon's crimson form.

For a moment, time seemed to stand still, the world holding its breath as the fusion commenced.

The transformation was instantaneous and awe-inspiring!

The dragon's scales took on a new luster, a vibrant display of reds and blues mingling to invent a spectacle of living flame.

Roaarr!!

With a mighty roar, the creature unleashed a torrent of fire from its maw, a blaze that illuminated the darkness of space.

Yet, as the flames died down, a look of dissatisfaction crossed Felix's face.

The dragon, for all its newfound power and the spectacle of its fire, did not meet his expectations.

It was a creature of flame, yes, capable of spewing fire that could melt stone and scorch the earth, but to Felix, it lacked... more.

It was merely a beast of fire, not the embodiment of the elemental fury and profound depth he had envisioned.

"I wanted more than just fire," Felix murmured to himself, his voice barely audible over the crackling of residual flames. "I seek a dragon capable of feeding off both wrath and fire in tandem, allowing it to transcend its original form. This... this is just a dragon with fire."

"Then, you have to create a new symbol from scratch with those two laws as its foundation." Lady Sphinx suggested.

"It's the only way I see forward." Felix nodded in agreement.

While the dragon and his fire were merged, it was on a surface level, like 1+1=2...What Felix desired and aimed to achieve was more than that.

'How do I achieve it though? Should I use the same conceptualization process?' Felix tapped his finger on his chin thoughtfully.

At the moment, he could only rely on the same method he used to create his new symbol.

He dove into the depths of his mind and began pondering on the essence of wrath and fire, feeling their fiery pulse within the core of his being.

'Wrath is more than just anger; it is a forceful call to action, a powerful response to injustice and injury that demands release...Meanwhile, fire has a dual nature of creation and destruction. It is the reflection of life itself, capable of nurturing warmth and devastating conflagration...It is uncontrollable, wild, and a symbol of passion and change.'

'The merging of wrath sin and fire law into a single concept is predicated on their shared attributes of power, transformation, and unrestrained energy.' Felix continued brainstorming, 'Both concepts deal with the idea of an uncontrollable force that, once unleashed, follows its nature toward a climactic release. Wrath, with its focus on emotional energy and desire for action, aligns perfectly with fire's capacity for physical transformation and its role as a catalyst for change.'

The more Felix familiarized himself with the commonalities between the two laws, the easier it became for him to visualize a concept that would encompass them both.

As he kept diving into his thoughts, Felix managed to come up with a logical concept amidst the sea of theories...It wasn't related to dragons or such, but at the moment, he only wanted to invent a new symbol, regardless of its effect.

'What if there was a symbol that's capable of receiving amplification of emotional energy, where my anger would feed the flames, granting them strength beyond measure?'

'Thus, the angrier I get, the more potent the flames become, embodying the idea that wrath, when directed, can serve as a powerful motivator and weapon.' Felix reasoned.

He soon shared his thoughts with the tenants and all of them seemed to agree with his take.

"Anger used to amplify fire-based attacks...Interesting." Ancestral Dragon Imyr remarked, "It's more or less close to our innate ability of which we turn our anger into strength. But, this will be exclusively focused on heat-based laws."

"It's even better, I can make the symbol simultaneously transform the heat resulting from my anger to feed into it." Felix added, "This will provide me with a incessant supply of rage."

"You mean like an infinite cycle of anger/heat reproduction?" Thor raised an eyebrow in surprise, "If this works, then you will be provided with incessant fuel to empower your heat-based attacks."

"Let's see if the universe approves of the concept."

With a determined breath, Felix reached out to the wrath and fire energies that danced at the edge of his consciousness.

Then, he visualized a wrath-based empty symbol...It had only borders and the dragon in the middle. The inscriptions weren't there yet.

Next, he started feeding both energies into the symbol while simultaneously using the concept in his mind to guide the universe into the symbol creation.

It was like he was telling the universe what he wanted from the symbol, its powers, its drawbacks, its duration, etc.

The universe was the cook, using the provided ingredients to see if it was possible for a decent dish to emerge or not.

With held breath, Felix waited for the universe's judgment...After a split second that seemed like an eternity, the universe responded at last.

With a beam of light that only Felix could see, inscriptions began to manifest near the borders of the symbol and spread out until they touched the central crimson dragon.

"It worked." Felix shared with a pleased smile as he brought the sigil to life before everyone.

"Wow, it's quite different."

The tenants had looks of surprise as they gazed at the new symbol.

The crimson dragon was now wearing a scruff of flames while half of the inscriptions were written with liquid fire.

It also glowed with intense heat, which created heat waves around it, causing the dragon to seem alive from a distance.

It was like the universe had recognized the uniqueness of the symbol and gave it the appropriate appearance!

"Weird...The universe hasn't clapped like always." Candace murmured as she glanced above her head.

When she brought up this matter, everyone realized that a thunderclap was the usual whenever Felix did something for the first time with massive implications. Merging two separated rules into one symbol warranted a reaction in their eyes.

Unless...

Everyone swiftly turned to gaze at Lilith with stunned expressions.

"You, have you already created a symbol by merging void rules with sin laws?" Felix asked what was in everyone's minds.

"Maybe? I don't recall." Lilith replied lazily while stretching her beautiful legs before them, "A leg massage might help me recollect."
