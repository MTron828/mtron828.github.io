Chapter 1650 The Second Round! II

1650 The Second Round! II

Hephaestus was forced to block the void blades as the battleaxes sliced through layers of heated air and molten rock.

"Damn it!"

With a furious roar, he turned on what was left of the radiant codex divinity in his weapon and swung his hammer withall his might, meeting the void blades head-on!

BOOOOOMMM!!!

The impact resonated like the birth of a new sun, a cataclysmic explosion of fire and void that shook the very foundations of his realm!

Unlike the lockdown utilized before that interfered with newly created laws, Hephaestus concentrated the divinity on his weapon alone, making it possible for the divinity to erase the blades during contact.

'Hephaestus can't afford to prolong this fight either...He has nothing to gain and everything to lose from this.' Apollo thought to himself as he strummed the strings without a care in the world, filling the battlefield with his transcending music.

'Apollo! I know you are spectating the battle! Share the view with us.'

Suddenly, Apollo received a unified telepathic message from his peers. While they couldn't use their spiritual pressure to spy on the battlefield, they knew that Apollo wouldn't miss this for the world.

Since he was already near Hephaestus' territory, they were certain he would spectate the fight live.

'I thought you would never ask.' Apollo chuckled as he shared the battle by utilizing light photons to recreate a 1-1 mirror with the battlefield.

Since photons traveled at the speed of light and the unigins' territories were all linked to the center, the images delivered had almost no delay.

In simpler terms, it was like he created live TV broadcasting for his peers with light photons instead of radio waves.

The moment the unigins tuned in to the battle, they were surprised to see a heated back-and-forth showdown between Felix and Hephaestus.

Felix, wielding a potent mix of void and evil energies, unleashed a barrage of formidable abilities.

Void energy swirled around him, mingling with sinister, malevolent forces, creating a spectacle of terrifying beauty!

With every move, Felix conjured devastating attacks - black void orbs that absorbed light and heat, tendrils of dark energy that lashed out like whips, and waves of malevolent force that distorted the very air they passed through!

Each ability was aimed with precision, a relentless assault that tested Hephaestus' defenses to their limits.

With his massive hammer, Hephaestus parried and countered Felix's onslaught, his hammer leaving trails of fire and molten rock with every swing!

The clashes between his hammer and Felix's dark energies sent shockwaves rippling through the domain, a symphony of destruction that echoed in the churning magma below!

As Felix said, now that he was prepared both mentally and physically for the battle, the result would not be the same...Especially, when Hephaestus had no divinity lockdown, no stars prepared, and most importantly, Felix had the protection and enhancement of celestial flames...X2!

"On paper, the human and his clone has the upper hand. The only reason he isn't already bringing Hephaestus to his knees is because of his lacking battle experience." Athena commentated in the shared telepathic space.

"Indeed, it's almost impossible for the boy to hit Hephaestus unless he lost his divinities or enhanced his strength to the point he leaves an unbridgeable gap that experience can't cover." Zeus agreed with a solemn tone.

"It's about to happen alright if Hephaestus doesn't get rid of the Supreme Symbol." Aeolus remarked lazily as he watched Hephaestus' clones try their absolute best to destroy the symbol, but to no avail.

"It won't be easy...The human has the symbol protected with his life." Demeter said with an indifferent look while observing how Felix had the symbol covered in a void barrier, an evil energy barrier, a bit of celestial flames, and an intense spiritual pressure barrier.

Yet, this wasn't all.

He summoned his seven hydra tails for himself and the clone and bestowed upon them the duty of the symbol's bodyguards.

If they were against Hephaestus himself, they wouldn't fare much, but against his clones operated by wisps and bodies made out of his domain?

They tore through Hephaestus' clones with ease!

The best part? Since the tails had minds of their own, they weren't restricted by the wrathful separation symbol, which meant...

Each hydra tail could unleash its unique and sinister law-based abilities!

Roaar!!!!

The first hydra tail, representing Wrath, glowed with a deep crimson hue as it invoked the Anger Inducement Symbol.

The symbol radiated a malevolent energy, seeped into the consciousness of the clones, and incited them into a frenzy of uncontrolled rage!

Since Hephaestus was already easily irritable and angered, his wisps had absolutely no chance to resist having their desires manipulated!

Their attacks became reckless and disorganized, turning them against each other in their blind fury, weakening their coordinated assault.

The draconic bear head, representing sloth, released a wave of lethargic energy through the Sloth Inducement Symbol.

The nearest clones caught in its languid embrace, found their movements slowing to a crawl, their once-fiery vigor diminished to listless motions.

This sudden sluggishness made them simple targets for the relentless strikes of the hydras!

The rest of the tails used their own unique ways and powers to defend their sides from the Hephaestus' clone army.

They even utilized symbols under Felix's orders to assist him in his main battle, but since Hephaestus was protected by the radiant divinity, not many worked directly with him.

Still, Felix kept abusing them to waste what remained of his radiant divinity, putting Hephaestus in a bad spot.

"That's what you get for risking it all and failing." Poseidon mocked.

He was the only one genuinely delighted by Hephaestus' f*ck up.

"My lord, why isn't he utilizing Resplendent divinity? I don't think he is in a position to try and save it." Admiral Nereus questioned with a deep frown.

Resplendent divinity was the forth divinity and was considered only a bit less potent than radiant divinity's effect.

While radiant divinity utilized the cancelling effects of celestial energy, resplendent divinity utilized the enhancing effect.

It had the potential to significantly enhance abilities or equipment to the point where the resulting outcome may be mistaken for another ability!

"Have you forgotten about me?" Poseidon smirked coldly, "He knows that if he wasted it to deal with mere clones, I will be his next opponent. A unigin without Radiant and Resplendent divinities at hand is nothing but a free target."

"I see..."

This was the reason Hephaestus hadn't used Resplendent divinity during his attempt to capture Felix, believing that it was already an overkill to use that much radiant divinity.

Alas, when he lost control over the fight, it was already too late to use it then.

"Still, if he wants to get rid of the clones, he has to use some of it." Poseidon showed an icy smile, "I will help him with a little shove."

Without an ounce of hesitation, Posedion merged his consciousness with his domain andcommanded the vast expanse of the ocean to surge forward!

RUMMBLE!! RUMMBLE!! NnÃªw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

The sky itself seemed to bow under the weight of the colossal tsunami that Poseidon conjured.

An immense wall of water, stretching as far as the eye could see, rose up with a thunderous roar...It towered over the landscape, casting a vast shadow across Hephaestus' domain, a tidal force of unstoppable might.

"THE LORD IS BEHIND US!"...."FOR THE LORD!"..."ALL HAIL THE GOD OF THE SEAS!"

Poseidon's armies, an array of sea creatures, water elementals, and warriors adept in aquatic combat, rode atop the tsunami as they bellowed with frenzied looks.

They were a formidable sight, their battle cries merging with the roar of the water as they prepared to clash with Hephaestus' forces.

The tsunami they rode upon was not just a weapon of destruction; it was a moving battlefield, bringing Poseidon's wrath directly to the heart of the fire god's realm!

'MOTHERF*CKER! GIVE ME A BREAK!'

Hephaestus, sensing the impending threat, left behind several of his fiery wisps to contend with the oceanic onslaught.

While he knew that these were mere fragments of his power, and against the might of Poseidon in the flesh, they stood little chance, he still commanded them to conjure their own volcanic lava tsunami, attempting to evaporate or disrupt its advance.

Since wisps had as much of a control over the domain as the main consciousness, the lava tsunami conjured wasn't to be thrilled with!

This transformed the battlefields into an apocalyptic canvas with Poseidon's massive oceanic tsunami surging forward with primal fury towards that fiery river of incandescent destruction that reflected the flames god's wrath!

Riding the crest of this inferno were Hephaestus' legions ready to meet their watery foes in battle, uncaring if the impact could kill them.

As the oceanic and lava tsunamis collided, the world seemed to hold its breath.

PSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!

Then, with a cataclysmic explosion of steam and energy, the two forces clashed...The meeting of water and flames unleashed a maelstrom of steam and smoke, the air crackling with the raw power of opposing elements!

The battlefield became a circling chaos of water and fire.

The oceanic tsunami, with its sheer mass and momentum, attempted to engulf and quench the fiery wave, while Hephaestus' lava tsunami fought to evaporate and consume its aquatic adversary!

The resulting turmoil was a dance of destruction, where water turned to steam only to be cooled back into droplets, and molten rock solidified upon contact with the cool embrace of the sea!

Amidst this merged environment, the two armies collided with a ferocity befitting their masters' enmity.

The sounds of battle were a symphony of hisses, roars, and the clash of arms...The air was thick with the scent of brine and sulfur, a testament to the violent union of sea and fire!

Just as it seemed like the impact ended in draw, Posedion tapped his trident on the throne's floor once and he emerged as a water titan behind his troops.

"You opportunist vermin..."

The instant Hephaestus saw this, his expression turned ugly. He realized that he could either go all out and end his current fight or watch as Posedion actively devouring his territory at unstoppable rate.

It could be said that he was caught between a rock and a hard place!
