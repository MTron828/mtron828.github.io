1822 Splitting Their Duties.

"That was a warning shot," Aeolus uttered calmly, "I won't miss the next time."

"No need to make this difficult." Athena shared, "We have no interest in your war. We will leave once we conclude our mission. So, it's preferable if you cooperated."

"I have heard that unigins are the epitome of arrogance, but I didn't expect it to be to this degree." Quantix Prime replied coldly, "You came into my realm, into my territory, into my war, and demanded me to hand over my subordinate and clear a way to my empire's headquarters."

"Yet, you still desire our cooperation? The nerve of you people." Quantix Prime sneered as he brought out his weapon.

It was a gracefully curved horn, polished to a deep golden hue and adorned with ancient writings, silver bands, and sparkling gemstones, radiating mystical energy and otherworldly elegance.

'The Horn of Harmonics.' Commander Bia narrowed her eyes in focus, 'The emperor isn't messing about.'

"It seems you have your decision to go against us." Aeolus remarked calmly, "So be it."

'Artemis, retrieve Ares' core, we will handle it here.' Athena said.

'Alright.'

Artemis didn't bother to look behind her as she took off towards the volcanic region. But, Quantix Prime had no interest in letting her go that easily.

'Quantaar's Roar.'

He brought the horn to his mouth and with a deep inhale, he blew into the horn while aiming it at Artemis.

Almost immediately, an explosive vibrational wave burst forth, a sonic force so powerful it shattered everything in its path!

Yet, the wave kept doubling in strength throughout its journey, turning from a sonic boom into a devastating force of destruction!

Whoosh!! Whoosh!!

Trees, rocks, and debris caught in its wake were obliterated, transforming to dust as the wave barreled towards Artemis.

'Dangerous.'

Sensing the looming danger, Artemis didn't dare to underestimate the attack. She swiftly turned to face the shockwave and conjured a thick wooden shield empowered by resplendent divinity!

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!

As the vibrational wave hit the glowing wooden shield, the impact resulted in the birth of another shockwave, spreading out until it reached both parties, forcing them to take precautions!

But still, they didn't have it as hard as Artemis.

'Damn it, it's force isn't being reduced in the slightest!' Artemis' expression turned for the worse, 'How can it continue doubling in strength after contact? It goes against common sen...'

Craack!!

Before she could finish her sentence, the shockwave ended up shattering the wooden shield into a thousand splinters, each piece glowing briefly as it flew through the air!

As expected, the shockwave continued uninterrupted, landing on Artemis' last line of defense...The radiant divinity barrier!

The barrier vibrated under the unyielding assault of the Quantaar Roar, holding just long enough to absorb the residual energy of the wave.

The shockwave died out eventually, devoured to oblivion by the barrier. Artemis emerged unscathed from the attack, but still, her expression was of utter seriousness.

'Do not underestimate him. We might have been bestowed with enough divinities to splurge as we desire, but, it won't do us any good if we waste it all before finding the paragon.' Artemis cautioned her peers one last time before continuing on her journey, having no interest in paying back Quantix Prime.

Quantix Prime watched her leave, his expression unreadable.

'They seem to be using a powerful force called divinities.' Commander Bia warned, 'I don't have much information about them, but all unigins seem to be fighting over owning it in my hometown.'

'Figures.' Quantix Prime replied calmly, 'Not anyone can block my Quantaar Roar without a single scratch.'

He soon turned to the shocked commander Krell, who didn't expect in the slightest for his emperor's infamous attack to fail, and ordered him, 'Chase after her, but don't engage.'

'Ye..Yes!'

Commander Krell took off after Artemis, keeping a fair distance between them.

The moment Quantix Prime refocused on Aeolus and Athena, he found out that one of them was already gearing up for a fight to death.

Aeolus was seen standing strong while surrounded by a radiant luminosity that began to emanate from his skin, casting a brilliant glow that illuminated the vicinity.

His aura became a tempest, fierce winds whipping around him with such intensity that his hair and the fabric of his clothes billowed wildly, fluttering like flags in a gale!

With a steady hand, Aeolus reached for his Zephyr Blade. As his fingers wrapped around the hilt, the blade responded to his heightened state, its own energy resonating with his.

The blade began to vibrate at an unfathomable speed, its movements becoming a blur to the naked eye.

Soon, it was vibrating so rapidly that it seemed to phase out of visible existence, rendering it invisible to all but its master!

To onlookers, it appeared as though Aeolus was brandishing nothing but the air itself, a fitting image for the god of wind and skies!

"Athena, leave him to me." Aeolus uttered, his voice as cool as a mist over a lake at dawn.

"Oki."

Athena took a step back and gazed at Commander Bia with a faint smile. That smile sent shivers down Commander Bia's spine, making her comprehend that she wasn't going to show her mercy.

The issue with all of this? Commander Bia still had no clue if they were allies to Felix or his enemies!

If she asked, they were bound to lie. Also, even if they didn't lie, she had no intentions of handing Felix to anyone in his current state whetherthey were allies or enemies.

Before she could overthink the situation, in an instant, Aeolus seemed directly in front of Quantix Prime!

The invisible Zephyr Blade was already in motion, cleaving through the air with a silent overwhelming power.

Aeolus had swung the blade in a wide arc, unleashing a massive divine tempest, roaring to life as it threatened to devour both Quantix Prime and Commander Bia!

Still, Quantix Prime reacted instantly, his armorvibrated briefly as he activated his vibrational barrier.

A shield that resonated at a frequency designed to counteract the incoming assault.

The barrier was unleashed just as the divine tempest crashed against it, the collision between divine wind and vibrational shield creating a spectacular explosion of energy!

'Oh no...'

Commander Bia, who was slightly off to the side, had less time to react.

Although she began to summon her own defenses, the sheer speed of Aeolus's attack caught her off-guard.

The edge of the tempest clipped her, causing the unleashed winds to hurl her backward with tremendous force.

Whoosh!!

She was sent flying across the battlefield, tumbling through the air before crashing into the ground, rolling several times due to the momentum before coming to a stop. ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

She raised her head, appearing dazed and momentarily incapacitated.

"Bastard."

Quantix Prime was displeased to see his subordinate suffering right in front of him.

Alas, Aeolus forced him to focus on his life as he continued his assault with a much more powerful attack!

'Athena, she is all yours.' Aeolus remarked as he forced Quantix Prime into a defensive posture, making it nearly impossible for him to focus on anything else but himself.

Since Aeolus' attacks were all based on empowered divine wind, Quantix Prime could feel that if he got hit by one of them, it wouldn't end well.

'Thanks.'

Athena snapped her finger and a metallic horse was born from her armor, leaving her wearing a thin battle-made outfit.

She leapt on the horse and with a single pat on the back, the metallic horse was covered in divine light, empowering him by x100!

Whoosh!

This made a single dash take them thousands of meters, arriving before Commander Bia in an instant.

"You're coming with me," Athena remarked calmly as she gazed at the dazed commander Bia.
