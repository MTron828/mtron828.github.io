1292 He is Dead For Real!

"Isn't that the Exonian you fought against in your maze's game?' Asna remarked with a surprised tone.

'He sure is.' Felix was just as taken back.

He didn't think for a second that he would be meeting The Executioner on this mission!

But, at the same time, he didn't find it too hard to believe as he understood that only the elites of the alliance were allowed to join this conquest mission!

Felix had a strong feeling that many other familiar faces he fought must have decided to join this mission as well.

After all, there was more than 30% of the universe unclaimed by the alliance...This was a massive opportunity for strong and lucky ones to get a piece of this new pie.

The risk was just as big as in the games but the rewards were incomparable, which would definitely cause many players to change their path.

'For him to cut the heads of hundreds of demons in less than a few seconds...He really became much deadlier and quicker than before.' Felix uttered with a faint smile.

Meanwhile, the demon captain Tchort was left with a confused expression after hearing gibberish coming out of The Executioner's mouth.

However, before he could bother to think too much about the meaning, hundreds of sleek aircraft removed their invisibility system and appeared right in front and above the Caravan.

This caused all the remaining demons to stare at them with mouths wide open in utter disbelief and shock.

"When did the Luminaris get their hands on such fine clean metal birds?!"

"Losing focus while in front of me? Foolish mistake."

By the time the last word entered the demon captain Tchort's ears, The Executioner was already putting his katana in his sheath in a seemingly slow fashion.

Click...

The instant the katana fully disappeared into the sheath, demon Captain Tchort's body had hundreds of lines appearing on it.

Psssssssssssss!!!!

A split second later, he was cut into multiple pieces akin to a fruit while his blood literally exploded out of his body.

He didn't even utter a single word before his sliced-apart corpse fell from the wagon and into the ground.

"Finish off the rest and rescue the captives before those demons get revived." The Executioner ordered calmly while disappearing into the wind.

"Yes, captain!"

In less than a few minutes, all the wagons on the caravan have been destroyed and left on the road with ruined corpses of lesser and animalistic demons...

Meanwhile, all of the coffins had been taken away.

Argh...

Abruptly, Demon Captain Tchort's groaned in pain after his body completed reconstruction from his head as the base.

When he looked around him and saw the mayhem left behind, his mind just couldn't process it properly.

"What did just happen..." Demon Captain Tchort mumbled as he recalled The Executioner's frightening prowess and the fleet of metal birds surrounding him.

It was understandable that he was in a state of shock as he managed to realize that he was neither ambushed by Luminaris or Demons.

He was so certain as he had never seen a Luminaris capable of taking down a captain-rank demon this quickly without using an ounce of light element.

"Captain! The captives are gone!! They are gone!!" Beleth screamed with an aghast expression the moment he was revived.

He didn't even bother to think for a second about the ambush as the only thing on his mind was eating purities.

Now that they had lost the captives, he knew that his weekly share of purities was going to be merely standard to ensure his rationality from going away.

"We got a much more serious sh*t to handle." Demon Captain Tchort scolded before using the demon contract between him and King Akshan to communicate.

'My king! My people have been ambushed by an unfamiliar strong race! I think our planet has been invad...'

'Motherf*cker! Get your ass back to the capital quickly! We are being invaded by them as we speak!' King Akshan cursed him off before cutting off the connection.

BOOOOOOOOM!!

Just as he was about to react, Demon Captain Tchort picked up the noise of a thundering explosion coming from the city's direction.

When he turned his head to face the city's direction, his demonic red eyes widened to the limit at the sight of a long thin white beam from the sky connecting with a massive blinding dome.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

One by one the demons remained staring at the white dome with similar horrified expressions the moment they were revived.

None of them knew what was that beam of light, but their instincts screamed at them to get the f*ck away from it if they value their lives.

"Captain...Can..Can we not return to the city so soon." Beleth gulped a mouthful in fear.

"We received an order to return. You know the rules."

As much as Demon Captain Tchort wanted desperately to listen to his instincts, King Akshan's order made it impossible.

Just as he was about to take his first step, his body suddenly shivered, making him halt in his place right away.

He knew immediately what caused this shiver and yet he couldn't believe it no matter what.

"Impossible...Impossible! How can he drop dead for real?!" He yelled out loud akin to a madman in front of his squad.

"Captain, what happened?" Beleth asked with a distressed tone.

He wasn't really worried about his captain but more about himself since his life depended on his captain's condition.

"King Akshan...King Akshan is dead." Demon Captain Tchort shared with a faint mumble like he wasn't physically capable of saying it.

"Huh? After that demonic explosion, it's doubtful for anyone to survive it." Beleth was confused, "Though, he will get revived after evil energy regathers itself."

"You don't get it..." Demon Captain Tchort looked at him with a never seen before level of terror in his eyes, "Our soul contract was severed. He is dead for real!"

The moment the last statement entered everyone's ears, a deathly silence fell in the area as everyone was left staring at their captain with a look of utter disbelief.

"..."

"..."

"..."

They wanted to call him a liar and bullsh*ter but they knew that their captain wouldn't be joking around in such a critical situation.

But at the same time. it was just too hard for them to believe that their demon king of more than hundred thousand years had dropped dead this easily.

Unbeknownst to them. the enemies they were facing were nothing like Luminaris or any other race they met.

This was just the beginning of The Conquest...
