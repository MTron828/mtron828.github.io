1639 A Warm Welcome! VI (The end)

During the cosmic chaos, where the formidable energies of Felix and Hephaestus clashed and Apollo's divine music reached its climactic heights, Felix's clones on the ground made their move at last.

Felix left them here for a reason as he had no use for extra bodies to take space up there when all they could do was evade and block like him.

Plus, it gave him the only path he had to escape from this entrapment!

Working in unison, the clones devised a plan to utilize their collective strength to propel the greed sin's form out of the lockdown area!

The greed clone was the key to their escape, holding the potential to teleport them to safety once outside the lockdown's influence!

Thus, with precise coordination, the clones gathered around the greed form. Each one braced themselves, channeling their strength into a singular, focused effort.

Then, with a burst of collective power, they launched the greed clone into the air, shooting into the far distance at an astonishing velocity, a blur of speed that rendered him almost invisible to the naked eye!!

Apollo was the first to see this happen before his own eyes...Yet, he seemed so engrossed in finishing his score, that he didn't bother to bat the clones' actions an eye!

"Bastard!!"

Hephaestus' expression turned for the worse after spotting thegreed clone soaring through the air, moving with such incredible speed that he appeared as a mere streak!

He figured out immediately what was Felix planning to do!

"Over my dead body!"

Hephaestus bellowed as he pushed the plasma beam to the limit until the corruption beam got devoured at a much faster rate, causing Felix's skin and the seven tails' scales to get burnt off until red flesh surfaced!!

The kind of power and heat required to burn off a unigin's body was simply unimaginable but at the same time, a concentrated force of a thousand stars would do just that!

"Just hold it a bit longer, Felix!"

"Don't give up!"

"Sh*t, is he really about to die off on his first day in the eternal kingdom?"

The tenants could do nothing but encourage Felix to hold strong and power through the attack, knowing that the moment his clone left the lockdown, he would be considered as won.

Alas, it was easier said than done...

"Argh!!!!"

The plasma, like a wrathful sun, scorched everything in its path, its searing embrace an unyielding force against which even the mightiest would falter.

Felix endured the full brunt of its fury as his skin, flesh, and bones started to melt away under the relentless assault, the pain so intense it was beyond comprehension!

His seven hydra tails also writhed in shared agony, their formidable forms disintegrating in the face of the overwhelming force!

Yet, amidst this excruciating torture, Felix's spirit blazed with an indomitable fire and rage!

With a roar that echoed through the cosmos, he rallied against the pain, his voice a thunderous declaration of defiance!

"I refuse to fall here!" he bellowed, his words laced with excruciating pain yet unyielding resolve. "After all that sh*t I've endured, I will not yield at the door! NEVER!"

Felix could never accept the notion of breaking his promise to Asna and his loved ones after hitting the first hurdle in his journey.

He could also never forgive himself for even thinking about it. The fact that his body was giving in to the unbearable plasma heat made him angrier than ever!

As Felix's anger surged to its zenith amidst the searing pain and desperate struggle, the Rampage Symbol fed off this intense emotion, reaching its peak form at last!

Immediately, a red dragon appeared and coiled around Felix's body, feeding off his anger and turning it into strength until it was tripled!

This was traded off with Felix's rationality, leaving him in the fiery haze of unchecked fury!

But in this case? He had no use for his rationality as all he needed was to survive for a few more moments and with his strength tripled, his defenses and endurance also benefited immensely!

"How mesmerizing...Ahhh, I can feel his sincere emotions down here. I must live up to his emotions as a true musician!"

Apollo bit the tip of his tongue as he channeled all of his emotions and strummed the strings with such ferocity and passion that the music swelled with each of Felix's roars of pain, and the notes resonated with the depth of his agony and the strength of his will!

The lyre's strings vibrated with a mournful yet heroic tune, encapsulating the tragic beauty of Felix's struggle.

"APOLLO! WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU DOING! GET HIS CLONE!"

When Hephaestus realized that Felix was still enduring and that he was losing time on his side, he couldn't help but bellow Apollo furiously to take action!

He understood that if Felix ever dared to escape from here, it would be much harder to capture him again!

Plus, he had invested almost everything he had of radiant divinity to establish such a massive cage and it would be gone to waste.

Alas, Apollo completely disregarded him, totally engrossed in his music to give a flying f*ck about Asna's core or anything else.

In the end, the beam's energy had begun to dissipate, leaving Felix in a state barely recognizable as a human or a hydra.

His once powerful form was now akin to charcoal, his entire body scorched black by the unfathomable heat while the seven-tailed hydra was turned into dried-up black twigs...

Despite his grievous condition, a spark of life and consciousness still burned within Felix. His eyes, the only part of him that retained any color, were fixed intently on Hephaestus. ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

They blazed with a fit of undeniable anger and loathing, piercing through the smoky aftermath like two beacons of wrath.

The depth of emotion in those eyes conveyed a statement clearer than words ever could ‚Äì this was not the end.

Before Hephaestus could react to that intense, unforgiving stare, a sudden enclosure of green light surrounded Felix and his people, including the clones.

In a moment that seemed paused in time, Felix mouthed a single sentence to Hephaestus, his voice misplaced in the void but his lips clear in their message:

"I will be coming for you first..."

With those final words, the green light surged in brightness, and then, as quickly as it had appeared, it vanished, taking Felix, his people, and the clones with it, far, far away...

Somewhere else, the greed clone could be seen standing some distance away from the radiant divine sphere with the equal trade symbol above his head.

The wish he had requested was to take Felix and the void citizens to the different edge of the eternal kingdom while using the behemoth void creatures and their armies as the price.

More than 90% of all non-intelligent unique void creatures were sacrificed in addition to 100% of the brought-in voidlings, leaving behind only the void citizens.

The price was so heavy because of Felix's main form being at such a supermassive size.

Still, Felix would never complain about it as the fact he got out of this alive should be considered a victory...
