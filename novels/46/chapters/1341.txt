Chapter 1342 The Divine Ascension.

"Destruction manipulation, huh."

Lucifer didn\'t seem too worried even when he saw his evil energy getting erased from existence.

This piqued Felix\'s intrigue a little, knowing that he was either putting a front or he truly wasn\'t bothered with destruction abilities.

\'Let\'s see if he is putting a front or not!\'

Felix struck first, his body radiating a crimson hue that pulsed with destructive energy. The air around him warped, and the very ground beneath his feet cracked and split under the sheer power of his presence!

With a swift movement, he channeled his energy into a concentrated crimson beam of destruction aimed straight at Lucifer!

Lucifer met the assault with a wicked smile, his form rippling as he summoned his own power.

But his focus wasn\'t on Felix\'s physical attack; instead, his eyes glinted ominously as he reached out with his insidious energy, seeking the seed of darkness he knew resided within Felix!

The destructive beam hit Lucifer, its power so tremendous it tore through the field and carved a deep scar into the earth!

But Lucifer was unphased. His own form flickered for a moment before returning to its menacing solidity as the beam had gone through him!

\'Hmmm?!\'

Meanwhile, Felix could feel a pull, a gnawing emptiness at his core while his mind started to be filled with nothing but evil thoughts.

He gasped as he finally realized that was

Lucifer\'s source of confidence!

Lucifer was trying to tap into Felix\'s residing evil energy and control him with it!

"You see, in this universe, there is no form that\'s completely pure and holy. Lucifer smiled calmly,

"Even when I lost countless times against Fenrir, I never used this against him because I feared that it will scare you for good."

"You...

Felix\'s knees buckled slightly, but he resisted the crippling effect, gritting his teeth as he tried to sever Lucifer\'s connection.

Drawing from the tumultuous whirlwind of Felix\'s hatred, Lucifer\'s features contorted, mirroring the unspoken malevolence brewing within the latter. His aura seemed to pulsate in rhythm with the chaos that Felix held in his heart, growing more potent with every cruel thought and negative emotion that surfaced within him.

With a wicked grin, Lucifer reached out, his hand an extension of the shadow that plagued Felix\'s soul.

The temperature seemed to drop to an icy chill as his spectral fingers brushed against Felix\'s soul, stirring pent-up resentments, grievances, and evil intentions.

The hatred that had lain dormant began to resonate, a loathsome symphony that echoed throughout Felix\'s psyche.

This evil energy, born of the darkest corners of Felix\'s mind, manifested as a tangible force. An unsettling wind picked up, swirling around them, the malicious energy taking form and weaving into an intricate matrix of paralyzing chains!

These chains of pure maleficence enveloped Felix, their cold touch a stark reminder of the horrors buried deep within him.

The shadowy chains, forged from the darkest aspects of his soul, bound Felix in place, freezing him with a terror he\'d never known before!

His limbs grew rigid, his heartbeat staggered, and his mind clouded. Every breath he took was a struggle, every blink was a monumental effort.

He was paralyzed, trapped in his personal nightmare.

Lucifer simply stood before him, the puppeteer manipulating the marionette, a cruel smirk playing on his lips as Felix\'s own hatred and negativity danced obediently on his strings, leaving him imprisoned in a paralyzing dread of his own creation!

Lucifer appeared right in front of Felix whose murderous eyes seemed to be bleeding with dark blood.

"Now, do you understand? Deity or not, having destruction abilities or not, nothing can help you against me when you can\'t even control your own evil side." Lucifer smiled as he caressed Felix\'s frozen chin, "That\'s why I was born to take over your body as you don\'t deserve it.

Felix wanted to respond, but it seemed like he couldn\'t muster even a rational thought in his mind...It was like he had gotten demonized but at the same time, he didn\'t.

"Just relax and enjoy my divine ascension."

In a dramatic display of otherworldly power, Lucifer\'s form began to dissolve, fragmenting into a cloud of sinister energy.

The sinister light that had once defined his ethereal form now broke free, transforming into a mass of swirling dark energy that seemed to distort the very fabric of reality around it.

Each particle of this malevolent energy was a fragment of his consciousness, brimming with an insatiable hunger for domination.

With a chilling wind heralding its approach, the swirling cloud began to seep into Felix, merging with him on a fundamental level!

It was an invasion not of the body, but of the soul, a perversion of the sanctity of consciousness.

Felix could feel the intruder within him, the dark energy infusing his being, his already clouded thoughts were more pressed by the malicious intent of this foreign entity.

A war ignited within Felix, a struggle for control between his own consciousness and the invading consciousness of Lucifer.

Both of them manifested within the consciousness space and faced each other with no one around them, standing on top of the peaceful consciousness ocean.

"Don\'t bother fighting, you can\'t defeat me when you are losing to yourself." Lucifer advised with good intentions as he eyed the darkened Felix.

He seemed barely capable of standing as his knees kept shaking while his facial features were twisted like he was amidst an internal struggle.

If Lucifer hadn\'t turned Felix\'s own hatred and negative thoughts against him, this fight would have been a clash of two titans within the confines of a single soul, a battle as intense as it was intimate.

Alas!

Felix tried his very best, his thoughts wrestling with the darkness, his will trying to keep his soul from being swallowed by the abyss.

But Lucifer\'s consciousness was an unrelenting storm...Each moment of resistance from Felix was met with a flood of darkness, drowning his will with every encounter.

Gradually, the malevolent energy consumed Felix, the vestiges of his consciousness dwindling before the onslaught of evil.

"Noooooooooo!!"

With the final vestiges of Felix\'s resistance extinguished Lucifer claimed victory.

He had not merely dominated Felix\'s soul but had taken complete control, a chilling testament to his indomitable power!

As Lucifer assimilated the remnants of Felix\'s consciousness, a new entity was born.

The man that had been Felix was no more; his physical form was now a mere vessel for the devil himself!

RUMBLE RUMBLE!!

At this moment of devilish ascension, the universe seemed to respond to the cosmic shift.

The calm stillness of the night was shattered as the heavens let out a series of thunderclaps, each one more resounding than the last. It was as if the cosmos was acknowledging this perverse event with a display of primal power!

Thunder echoed through the vast expanse of space, a symphony of nature that was paradoxically somber and celebratory.

Lightning danced across the firmament, illuminating the night sky in an awe- inspiring spectacle.

It was a tribute to the ascension of the unholy, a sign that a new power had taken hold in the universe.

The celestial tribute ended as abruptly as it had begun, leaving behind an eerie silence that spoke volumes of the change that had occurred.

"You can celebrate my ascension all you want, but from this moment on, the universe is mine!"

Lucifer laughed out loud with his head tilted towards the heavens seemingly challenging the cosmos and the entity managing it.

"Lord?"

Lokaka inquired with a confused tone as he eyed the new \'Lucifer\' appearance.

His hair, already a vivid crimson, lengthened dramatically, cascading down to his waist like a waterfall of blood.

Each strand pulsed with dark energy, the intense red was reminiscent of the dying embers of a destructive fire, promising danger and destruction.

His skin underwent a stark change, turning as dark as the abyss, an obsidian black that seemed to swallow the surrounding light.

The darkness of his skin was so profound that it appeared to distort the space around him, blurring the lines between the physical and the spiritual!

Emerging from his forehead, two enormous horns spiraled upwards. Each one was a meter in length, towering above him like ancient monoliths, jagged and menacing.

Their formidable appearance served as a reminder of his demonic origins, and the power he now wielded.

And then there were his wings...They sprouted from his back; a pair of shadowy extensions that seemed more substantial than spectral. Each feather was as dark as his skin, their edges sharp and menacing.ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

A divine glow, a perverse parody of heavenly radiance, surrounded him. This was no angelic halo, but a tangible aura of nefarious energy.

The darkness that had once been confined to Lucifer\'s form now radiated outwards, a clear proclamation of his unholy ascension.

The new Lucifer, having fully taken over Felix, stood tall and daunting...His mere presence seemed to command submission, a symbol of the darkness that had triumphed over the light.

"I am no longer Lucifer." Lucifer turned to his subjects and announced with an overbearing tone, "From this moment onward, you shall address me as the firstborn Demon God."

"Demon God!"

"Demon God!"

Lokaka and his partners knelt immediately with a deep sense of reverence burning in their chests.

They could feel the divine emitting from him, and they wanted nothing but to bath in it and share this glorious moment with him.

"Now, excuse me, but I have a universe to conquer" Lucifer flapped his wings once and disappeared out of existence, leaving everything behind...œÅŒ±–ødŒ± `n·¥èŒΩ…ê| —Åom
