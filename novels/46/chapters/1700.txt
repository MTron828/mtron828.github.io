Chapter 1701 The Last Dance. IX

ÔªøÔªø1701 The Last Dance. IX

Uncaring about the consequences of his actions or decisions,Felix found himself at the brink of his physical endurance.

His muscles screamed, fibers tearing under the immense force he was exerting, and yet, he dug deeper into the well of his resolve!

Every sinew of his body was on fire, a testament to the monumental struggle against Amun-Ra, a being whose might was nigh unfathomable!

'I can't! I can't fall back now! I must, I must push through and overpower him!'

"I MUST!"

With a primal roar, Felix channeled everything he had to transform the heat in his body into anger, which in turn became fuel for his continuous enhancement!

190 million BF...200 million BF...220 million BF!!!

Amun-Ra, for all his divine might, found his arms faltering against Felix's sudden resurgence!

Felix, muscles bulging and skin shimmering with the effort of surpassing his limits, stood firm against Amun-Ra.

The air between them crackled, charged with the power of their confrontation.

Felix's voice was raw, yet filled with an unwavering resolve as he locked eyes with the divine being before him.

"You've reached your limit, haven't you?" Felix taunted, his breath heavy. "Without your precious celestial energy, you're just another victim!"

Amun-Ra's expression, usually unflappable, flickered with the slightest hint of anger.

"Your tenacity is commendable," He replied, his tone even but strained as he braced against Felix's onslaught. "But do not mistake temporary advantage for victory."

Felix's laughter echoed, a sound filled with defiance and challenge.

"We're not playing by your rules today, Amun-Ra. This is my realm and in my realm, your strength can't go beyond this!!"

With a final, monumental effort, Felix gathered every ounce of his strength and roared, "NOW FAAAALL!"Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The word resonated like thunder, a command that brooked no refusal!

In that instant, the sky cracked open wider, and the once mighty ruler was sent plummeting with an unstoppable momentum that even he, a mighty ruler, could not just stop with a thought!

The shock on Amun-Ra's face was a picture of disbelief, etched into the fabric of the dreamrealm as he fell through the shattered sky!

Meanwhile, Felix was also sent flying backward from the recoil, but this was exactly what he desired.

The moment his body was about to smash into the flipped ground, it went through an emerging void portal, taking advantage of Amun-Ra's inability to break from the momentum.

The plan was good but the execution was to perfection!

Felix was told by Lilith that the three rulers' base strength was at 200 million BF and the only way for them to go beyond it was through using celestial energy as fuel, allowing them to grow infinitely but not permanently.

Right now, Amun-Ra could be said to have been smashed by a force equivalent to a ruler, which he could not shrug as easily as before!

Still, Amun-Ra wouldn't be considered a third ruler if this was enough to void his plans. As he watched Felix's body go through the portal, he tightened his grasp on the Akh, seemingly about to use an ability as a last resort.

However, his eyes, sharp as the dawn, caught a glimpse of something beyond the battlefield. The instant he realized what it was, he relaxed his grasp on the Akh and conjured a void portal directly behind him, its edges swirling with the potent mysteries of the void.

Without looking back, the void accepted him, its tendrils of darkness wrapping around his form as if welcoming a master into its depths.

His cold gaze on Felix was the last thing to vanish into the void...

The moment the void portals snapped shut, the dreamrealm began to shudder with finality, its very essence quaking under the strain of imminent dissolution.

Rumble!! Rumble!!

The structures, landscapes, and fantastical skies that had once thrived in this realm of boundless imagination started to crumble, disintegrating into nothingness as if being erased by an unseen hand.

Then, as the last vestiges of the dreamrealm gave way, there was a sudden and breathtaking explosion of dreamy, colorful particles.

It was as if the realm, in its last act of defiance, scattered its essence across the void of space, painting the darkness with a fleeting tapestry of vibrant hues and shimmering lights.

But as quickly as it appeared, the brilliant display faded, the particles dissipating into the vast emptiness of space.

Darkness reclaimed its dominion, and silence enveloped the area once more, a stark reminder of the dreamrealm's end...

...

Meanwhile, in a random area of the void realm within the matter universe, Felix's stare locked onto Amun-Ra, his breathing ragged and uneven.

Blood, a stark contrast against his pallid skin, seeped from his pores as if his very essence was rebelling against the strain he had placed upon it.

His eyes, once sharp and focused, now clouded with a haze of pain and exhaustion, bore the weight of a double backlash.

He was grappling with the soul-deep reverberations caused by the destruction of the dreamrealm.

Simultaneously, his physical form was reeling from the aftermath of pushing beyond the conceivable limits of strength, his body on the brink of collapse.

Every fiber of his being cried out in protest, caught in the aftermath of a battle that had demanded more than what seemed possible, leaving him teetering on the edge of consciousness.

Now, all weakened and frail, he should have a look of resignation on his face after realizing that Amun-Ra had followed him to the void realm.

But, all he had was a choppy victorious smirk, knowing that the three rulers' existence were completely banned from stepping foot outside of the eternal kingdom!

As expected, without warning, golden chains materialized from the void, ensnaring them both in a spectacle of divine intervention!

"Argh..."

Felix discovered himself bound by a dozen luminous chains, each link searing into his flesh with an excruciating intensity.

The chains constricted around him, a physical manifestation of the universe's reprimand for his audacious attempt to transcend its laws.

But, he did not complain...The moment he decided to abuse his laws, he knew that the universe would not leave him in peace.

Across from him, Amun-Ra was in a far graver predicament.

Thousands of chains wrapped around him, an overwhelming testament to his stature and the severity of his transgression.

The chains rendered him utterly immobile, a god reduced to a prisoner of the very universe he served.

"Ha...Ha...Ha, how does...it...feel...to...be...powerless..." Felix laughed with great difficulty, each crackle resulted in a wave of intense pain hitting his soul.

Yet, it was all worth it.

"As long as we are imprisoned in this cage; we are always powerless," Amun-Ra stated calmly, his sound strained under the weight of his bindings.

Felix, amidst his torment, managed a grim chuckle. "The universe may consider us mere pawns on its stage, but I am not one to be controlled. Rest assured, I will put an end to your misery before freeing myself from its grasp."

"And, that's a promise."

The moment he finished, the golden chains ensnared Amun-Ra further and they began to pulse with celestial light, heralding the opening of a white portal that shimmered with divine essence!

Felix wasn't surprised as thisportal was a one-way gate back to the eternal kingdom!

Amun-Ra, ever composed steady in his restrained state, turned his stare towards Felix.

With an air of solemnity, he imparted his final words in this realm.

"Your destiny has already been determined, but you are not aware of it yet." He said, his sound resonating with the gravity of unseen truths.

Then, with a tone as cold as the void that separated them, Amun-Ra commanded, "Bring him with one dying breath."

The chains tightened with unyielding force, pulling Amun-Ra towards the portal...His figure, bathed in the celestial light, began to fade, swallowed by the gateway that would return him to the land of gods.

As the portal closed behind him, leaving Felix alone in the void, the words of Amun-Ra lingered, a foreboding echo of the judgment that awaited.

His heart skipped a beat as he realized that he power not yet have reached clear waters.

'Wha...'

Just as he was about to extend his senses further away steady though the sealing chains on him made it near impossible to tap into his strengths without an agonizing feedback, a sudden dreadful sinister sound resounded behind him.

"The things I will do to you..."

With a hint of despair in his eyes, Felix slowly turned his head to find Uranus, The Monarch of The Cosmos, staring at him with a wide sinister smile akin to a predator...
