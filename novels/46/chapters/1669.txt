1670 Exploring The True Potential of Seven The Sins Laws. VI

The moment Felix heard her comment, he canceled the symbol. His emotions and body temperature returned to normal again.

"You mean to tell me that bad-quality symbols can be created? Symbols that affect the user negatively more than positively?" Felix frowned.

"Just because you have a reasonable concept and the universe has approved it, it doesn't mean that the symbol will be great," Lilith remarked lazily, "You have to focus on the details the most since the universe follows the symbol's creation based on what you provided it down to the letter."

"I see..."

Felix assumed that the universe would iron out the rest of the concept during the symbol's creation, but he couldn't be more wrong.

"The universe is like a programming software that requires as much data as possible to create the desired symbol without too many drawbacks." Lady Sphinx said.

"Indeed." Felix nodded, "The Infernal Wrath symbol doesn't care about how it achieves the infinite reproduction of heat/anger and this caused me great discomfort. I should have been more precise in how I wanted it to occur, when it should stop, its intensity, and the list goes on."

"Is it possible to modify it or you must create a new one from scratch?" Thor wondered.

Everyone turned to Lilith.

"You can't modify it." Lilith replied casually, "To create a new one, you must erase the old one first."

When Felix heard this, he closed his eyes and willed for the Infernal Wrath symbol to be removed from his arsenal. The symbol soon disintegrated into particles and disappeared from his mind.

Then, he started a new creation process and this time he made sure to add as many details as possible to ensure a much greater quality.

In a few moments, a new similar but more dignified symbol manifested before Felix. Everyone could recognize the difference instantly as the new symbol had more inscriptions written on it until they seemed clamped up.

Then, he tested it out again and this time Felix felt like he could control the intensity of the transfer between heat and anger.

This was such a massive quality-of-life change, that he no longer felt uncomfortable and could focus more on utilizing the newly created fuel in his heat-based attacks.

"This is much better than before." Felix said with a satisfied tone, "I should test Gluttony's Maw too and see what's lacking in it."

Felix went and tested the symbol...He soon realized that it had its faults too that could be solved. He erased it and created a new improved one.

This kind of modification was possible only for small details, not major drawbacks, such as the penalties in Clash of Pride, I am Supreme, etc.

Unfortunately, those penalties were one of Felix's current hurdles in his growth as he knew that no matter how great a symbol was, it would be near impossible to use a dozen of them at the same time without suffering from their side effects.

This was one of the many reasons he could not utilize many other symbols during his battles.

Thus, he understood that his current priority wasn't even to create new symbols, but to find a way to either get rid of the penalties or at least reduce their intensity.

Fortunately, there was a method.

"I have succeded in creating a new symbol that you couldn't have invented," Felix said calmly as he showed a small manifestation of the Infernal Wrath symbol before Lilith. "So? What's next?"

"So hasty." Lilith yawned in annoyance as she lay near the pool akin to a dead fish, "Can't we leave it for tomorrow or something?"

Felix remained staring at her with an unfazed expression, making her comprehend that he wanted to know now.

"Fiiiiine, get down here." She permitted as she rolled her eyes in vexation.

Felix sent his consciousness to Asna's core and went straight to sit in front of Lilith, who was already awaiting him with an annoyed look.

"Don't bother me again after this," Lilith warned.

"Fine by me," Felix replied with a tint of eagerness in his voice.

"Above symbols is something I call, Sin-Symbolic Techniques. Combining symbols into a singular, more potent form is the essence of creating Sin-Symbolic Techniques," She began, her eyes gleaming with the wisdom of eons. "It's not merely about stacking effects; it's an art. You must weave them together, ensuring harmony among the symbols to amplify their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses."

'Sin-Symbolic Techniques...This is it! This is the good stuff!'

Felix listened intently, his mind racing with possibilities.

The idea of merging symbols to create techniques of unparalleled power was tantalizing, promising a new horizon in his mastery over the sins and laws he had come to command.

He understood that if it was possible to combine seven symbols from seven different sins and even add other laws into the mix, a monstrosity of ability would be brought to life!

This was the true power of the seven sins and only now could Felix see a way for Lilith to rival Eris and other upper celestial unigins!

"To illustrate," Lilith continued, conjuring a spiritual projection between them to aid the explanation. "Consider the Veil of Pride Technique. It's a masterful blend of the Indomitable Will Symbol and Hunger Symbol. On their own, each symbol has its strengths and vulnerabilities." Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

The projection morphed, showing two symbols spiraling toward each other, their lines and curves dancing in a predestined embrace.

"When merged," She said, watching Felix's reaction, "They create a technique that not only protects the user with a cloak of self-esteem but also feeds on the user's achievements. This cloak becomes stronger with every accomplishment, turning the user's very successes into a bastion against attacks."

Felix watched, fascinated as the symbols combined into a single, intricate symbol that radiated a harmonious energy.

Now, the colors of orange and gold had blended...A unique beast was formed by merging the body of a boar with the head, mane, and tail of a lion!

At first glance, anyone can discern that this was the upgrade as it was bigger and had a dissimilar atmosphere compared to regular symbols.

"But how do you control the drawbacks? Those two merged symbols might not have strong drawbacks like some other symbols, but still." Felix asked with a focused look.

He knew that the Indomitable Will symbol had the drawback of not being able to be utilized for a long period if it was summoned and the user's prideful belief in his invincibility was lacking.

As for Hunger Symbol? The energy absorption offered a temporary increase in power that needed to be constantly fueled with energy to maintain it.

So, it was impossible to get stronger through it unless he was constantly on the move.

While those drawbacks were harmless compared to other severe penalties, they were still annoying to deal with.

"That's where the beauty of Sin-Symbolic Techniques lies," Lilith explained with a faint smile,"By combining these symbols, you create a balance. The insatiable hunger of gluttony is tempered by the achievements that fuel pride's protection. Meanwhile, the potential arrogance of pride is grounded by the tangible necessity to achieve more, to feed the gluttonous aspect. The technique turns potential vices into a source of strength, with each aspect keeping the other in check."

"In essence," Lilith concluded, "you're not merely stacking powers. You're weaving them together into a coherent, self-sustaining cycle. The key is balance, understanding how the sins interact, complement, and regulate each other."

"It makes sense now."

Felix and the rest of the tenants were left with raised eyebrows in astonishment and astonishment at the masterful method Lilith came up with to get rid of the drawbacks.

It might seem simple, but it was anything but that.

They understood that to find out such an intricate balance between those symbols required an intense level of understanding and insight about the aspects of sins and desires.

That's why Lilith said that understanding said desires was the key to becoming the paragon of sins, not by ascension, but by achievements!

"If you commenced on this, your path to greatness will be hindered only by your intelligence and level of understanding." Lilith excused him with a wave, "Now, beat it."
