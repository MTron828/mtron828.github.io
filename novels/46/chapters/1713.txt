Chapter 1714 Damaged Humanoid Peacock.

ÔªøÔªø1714 Damaged Humanoid Peacock.

Soon, Felix used his envy laws to mimic the appearence of the picked race with some personal modification.

Cling! Cling!

The celestial chains immediately tightened around Felix and introduced him to a world of pain after he tried to use his laws again!

Felix gritted his teeth, fought the pain, and continued designing his appearence.

"Do you need any help?" Apollo offered with a sympathetic look.

He had once experienced those chains and knew full well that Felix wasn't faking his agony.

"No..." Felix uttered with great difficulty.

'It must be eating him inside to feel this weak and hopeless.' Thor sighed.

'He has gotten accustomed to being at the top. To have such a fall, would ruin any warrior's mentality.' Fenrir approved.

The tenants were correct in their assumption...Felix despised the sensation of weakness to the core as it made him feel like he was under the whims of everyone.

Thus, after settling down in the quantum realm, his first objective was to find a way around the celestial chains, if it existed.

Otherwise, he was going to spend the most depressing twelve million years of his life.

As he fought the excruciating pain, Felix's transformation started step by step under the watchful eyes of the tenants.

As he concentrated, his hair underwent a mesmerizing change, growing longer and separating into flowing waves of green and blue, occasionally illuminating the surrounding quantum fabric with gentle pulses of light.

His physique became leaner and somewhat shorter, embodying the elegant stature of the Luminoans, while the tattoos across his chest morphed into intricate designs inscribed in the Luminoan language, signifying unity with their culture.

Brown fox-like ears sprouted atop his head, complementing his already elf-like ears, and enhancing his auditory perception to Luminoan standards.

His eyes transformed into bright green orbs, devoid of traditional pupils, replaced by luminescent lines that danced with every glance.

Even his handsome facial structure wasn't left in peace as his features now possessed a sharper, more youthful jawline with a smaller nose and lips.

Yet, the most mesmerizing part about the Luminoans was their clothes.

Felix proceeded to complete his disguise by donning the traditional attire of the Luminoans.

He slipped into boots crafted from a material that absorbed and reflected the quantum realm's vibrant energies, followed by green jeans that hugged his leaner frame perfectly, each movement causing them to shimmer subtly.

The centerpiece of his ensemble was a long dark green jacket, adorned with intricate lines that pulsed gently, harmonizing with the quantum realm's ever-shifting light.

These lines, a signature of Luminoan craftsmanship, seemed alive, resonating with the energy around them.

As Felix adjusted the jacket, the transformation reached its zenith, rendering him utterly unrecognizable!

Even those who knew him best would walk by without a second glance, his appearance now a perfect blend of Luminoan elegance and the quantum realm's mystique.

"Fabulous! Absolutely Fabulous!"

Unbothered by Felix's pained groans and sweaty forehead like he had just gotten through hell, Apollo started applauding with a wide delightful grin.

"Shut up." Felix said with an irritated tone as he got accustomed to his new form.

'You do kinda look weird.' Candace giggled.

'Is this quantum realm's beauty standard? You look like a deformed elf with a hair obsession.' Lord Loki roasted after a burst of laughter.

'Come on now, don't say that.' Thor chuckled, 'He already will be having a difficult time living like this. No need to pour salt in his wounds.'

The rest of the tenants each chipped in with their roasts and unique remarks, leaving no ground unturned.

All he could do was listen to them with his mouth twitching, unable to muster a single retort.

'Don't listen to them darling, you will always look handsome to me.' Lilith said with a loving tone, 'Even if you resemble a damaged humanoid peacock.'

'Humanoid peacock, haha! He does kinda look like one.'

'As expected, leave it for the witch for perfect insults.'

The tenants usually came in Felix's defense whenever Lilith insulted him, but not this time. Felix's new pissed-off expression was too cute, it made them unable to hold back their laughter.

To be honest, they couldn't be blamed for such a reaction...While Felix might be considered stunning and handsome in the quantum realm, his previous authoritative and bloodthirsty appearence was nowhere to be found.

"F*cking pricks...I will remember this."

Felix cursed under his breath while glaring at the culprit, who put him through this. Apollo still had the same wide grin while giving he a double thumbs-up.

"Trust me, we will be swimming in women when we arrive at the empire."

"..."

Felix decided to remain silent, realizing that engaging with Apollo was worse than dealing with Lilith.

"I know what will make you feel better."

Uncaring about the silent treatment, Apollo brought out the Lyre and started singing a new song.

His voice, clear and full of mirth, sang out a whimsical tune that danced through the colorful expanse around them.

"Through the quantum realm, we boldly roam, With Felix disguised, far from home. His hair so long, with hues of night and sea, And sound receptors of a fox, as cute as can be."

"Can't you shut up for once in your life?!"

"Haha, in Luminoan garb, he strides with grace, A stranger's guise, on his familiar face. We dodge and weave, through chaos and light, our journey a tale, of delight and plight."

Apollo's laughter mingled with the melody, his song painting a vivid picture of their escapades, turning even the most mundane moments into tales of joy and camaraderie.

Even when irritated, he couldn't help but crack a hopeless smile at last.

Despite the absurdity of his new appearance, he appreciated the light-hearted take on their otherwise perilous journey.

Plus, after everything that transpired in the eternal kingdom, he needed to have his heart and mind pacified if not by a little...Especially, when he had no clue what was going on with Asna.

"With he by my side, in disguise so fair, We're an unmatched duo, beyooond compare!!"

***

While Apollo was singing his heart out, his alter ego was watching from a realm so steeped in obscurity that it rendered the concept of sight meaningless...Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Seated upon a throne crafted from the essence of darkness itself, his presence was an enigma, a nexus of unfathomable intentions and unseen power.

The void around him was not merely the absence of light but a palpable entity, a canvas of impenetrable darkness that seemed to absorb any flicker of illumination, any whisper of warmth...

His eyes, however, told a different story.

The scene within his gaze was a stark juxtaposition to his somber surroundings.

Apollo's upbeat tune and Felix's relaxed demeanor in the emptiness seemed almost blasphemous.

For a brief moment, the alter ego's attention lingered on the reflected adventure, a flicker of something indiscernible, perhaps amusement or curiosity, dancing in the depths of his stare.

Yet, as if realizing the indulgence, the imagery dissolved, the connection abruptly severed, leaving behind nothing but the infinite expanse of darkness once more.

Then, with deliberate slowness, the enigma rose from the throne...His voice, when it came, was a thing of depth and resonance, echoing off the non-walls of his domain, imbuing the void with a sense of impending purpose.

"Laugh and dance, for those black flames are the final key to my puzzle, the final key to my conquest, the final key to my dream..."

His declaration hung in the vacuum, a vow made in the absence of light, witnessed by the denizens of shadow as he was not alone.

As the scene pulled back further, the scope of his domain revealed in all its eldritch grandeur.

Beyond the throne, an endless sea of dark entities stirred, a legion bound by will and purpose, each pair of glowing red eyes!

This was no mere gathering of creatures; it was an army amassed at the edge of creation, awaiting the command of their enigmatic leader.

If he or Lady Sphinx were to spot those dark creatures, their orbs would have been left wide open in shock and disbelief.

For those creatures were identical to none other than the Dark Reaction!!!
