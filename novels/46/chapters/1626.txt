Chapter 1627 Breakthrough To The Origin Realm/The Ascention. I

1627 Breakthrough To The Origin Realm/The Ascention. I

"Thank you for being gentle with her..."

Lady Yggdrasil said with an appreciative tone as she gazed at Felix, who was sitting across from her at the central table within his consciousness space.

Felix had already reached out to Lady Yggdrasil and Cyclope, letting them know that they were more than welcome to be part of his journey to the eternal kingdom.

Both of them agreed at once as this wasn't an opportunity to be missed.

While Lady Yggdrasil was coming along for sightseeing and research purposes, Cyclope's goal was to find a way to improve his forging craft it was possible.

When Felix showed him what happened to his masterpiece The Cosmosbreaker, he instantly felt like his pride as the greatest forger in the universe shattered.

He realized that he was not worthy of such a title if his greatest achievement was broken as easily as any other trash.

"I never had any intentions to hurt her." Felix sighed, "If only I had this possibility way before her emotions' developed to this stage, the situation might have been much easier to remedy."

"There is no point in dwelling over this anymore." Thor said calmly, "You have done the right thing and it's time to focus on the bigger picture."

Felix knew that he was right...He couldn't have his concentration wasted on anything else besides the eternal kingdom from this moment on.

Now that he had dealt with his friends and even helped his race improve their lives, it was time to focus on himself.

The first thing he did was return to the heart of the void realm, wanting to check on Nimo.

He noticed that he still needed more time than anticipated to hatch...So, he added a few more days, which translated to tens of thousands of years in his illusion domain.

Next, he took off to the void nation's territory and situated himself in his throne chamber.

He waved his hand once and six perfect clones manifested in front of him after a red symbol appeared above his head.

Those weren't just normal clones, they possessed a powerful consciousness similar to Felix as they were born out of a portion of his soul...So, each one was just as powerful and capable as Felix.

The only limitation they possessed was the fact they couldn't utilize any laws besides the one under them...However, they could be affected by all symbols regardless of their laws.

Because of this, Felix had to recall them since he couldn't utilize all laws simultaneously with them being separated.

After they merged with him again, Felix felt his soul being enriched and reaching its peak strength again.

"Should I continue increasing my strength or is it just not worth it anymore?" Felix said as he tapped his finger on the armrest.

In the past year, he wasn't just helping his friends and his race...He also abused the laws for his benefit.

The first thing he did was use his perfect cloning symbol on the rare minerals in his possession to create an unfathomable number of resources for his dragon cultivation system.

Then, he sent his gluttony form clone to the elemental galaxy and devoured those elemental minerals by the tens of thousands!

Because he possessed the gluttony sin laws, the devouring process and digestion system were at their peak forms without needing any kind of external help!

So, he never slept even a moment as the clone kept devouring thousands worth of minerals each second tirelessly.

Due to the time difference, one year here was a century there.

Yet, it was more than enough for Felix to reach the fiftieth dragon mark, which translated to a pure strength increase of one million BF in total!!

This was more marks reached than the ancestral dragon himself!

Yet, the ancestral dragon had reached the primogenitors' level in terms of strength, which was understandable, when considering that dragons were born with an innate foundational strength without even using their cultivation system.

For the ancestral dragon, he probably was able to reach 500k+ BF through pure maturity without a single mark.

"After hitting the fortieth mark, the progress has slowed down immensely as I require a hundred billion of rare minerals to push past one mark." Felix spoke to himself, "Now that I am at the fiftieth, I need more than a hundred trillion worth of elemental minerals to complete one mark...It's no longer sustainable when crossing each mark doubles down the resources needed."

Even though Felix had all the time in the world, he wasn't interested in spending eons of effort and pain for the sake of a single 20k BF boost.

It wasn't worth it anymore, especially when he was about to surpass twenty million BF at once, the instant he ascended to a unigin.

"Looks like I have reached the universe's fullest potential and it can no longer sustain my growth." Felix chuckled, never expecting in his life to say something as outrageous as this.

But, he was right...There was close to nothing the universe could give him at the moment to improve himself.

In other words.

"It's time to ascend."

The moment he said this, Candace and the rest of the councilmen entered the throne chamber and positioned themselves at the corners...They had solemn expressions mixed in with a bit of anticipation.

Felix had requested their attendance in case of some kind of an emergency...Whether they could help him or not was debatable, but it was better to have them near than not.

Felix stood up from his throne and walked to the center of the chamber while undressing himself in a slow and dignified manner.

Immediately after reaching the center, he was left in his boxers, which were made out of void energy.

Then, he sat in meditation, his form a picture of serene determination.

The room, vast and opulently adorned, seemed to hold its breath, the very air charged with the anticipation of the momentous and historical event about to unfold.

"All I have to do is launch the breakthrough process to the origin realm and the universe will take it from there," Felix murmured as he had his eyes closed shut, doing one last round of mental preparation.

In reality, he was prepared thousands of years ago and if he wanted, he could have been an origin bloodliner any second.

So, the moment his hearts were settled and his mind was a peace, his will, an unyielding force, ignited the process!

Internally, a fierce battle commenced, a war between the overwhelming 99% of Lord Loki's bloodline and the defiant 1% of his human lineage!

Felix's human side, though vastly outnumbered, was fueled by a relentless desire to prevail, to consume and assimilate the powerful bloodline that had been a part of him for so long!

The stakes were clear and absolute: success meant a breakthrough into the Origin realm, and failure meant death.

Yet, even so without Lord Loki's assistance, Felix was demolishing his bloodline, making his 1% human bloodline seem like the predator!

"Jeez...He has been waiting for this instant for too long to unleash this kind of overwhelming destruction on my poor bloodline." Lord Loki's eyelids twitched.

"Haha, what did you expect? All humans dream is to become an origin bloodliner and Felix was no different."

Thor chuckled as he watched Felix's human bloodline increase from 1% to 30% almost instantly.

There was no such entity as walls like the last time as Felix had reached his peak state in every realms, spiritual, physical, mental, and whatnot.

Nothing was stopping this breakthrough, not even so the universe!

As the struggle intensified, Felix's body began to undergo some profound mutations.

His skin rippled, his veins glowed with an inner light, and the air around him vibrated with the force of the conflicting bloodlines.

The chamber itself seemed to respond, the walls pulsing with energy as if witnessing the birth of a new era!

It was like the universe was seeking to find the best evolution path for Felix, a being, who reached the peak in its territory without even so reaching his peak potential first.

When it dug deeper, the universe recognized the presence of the Paragon of Sins' core at last, a power that resonated with the very fabric of creation.

This discovery seemed to have changed everything.

In a cosmic intervention, the universe wove the core into the process naturally, realizing that the only rightful path before him was to become a unigin and more specifically, the new Paragon!

As the three rulers expected, the fact that there was a void in Lilith's place was more than enough for the universe to consider Felix as the best candidate for the new position.

Hence,Felix's normal origin breakthrough was transformed into an ascension, a never-before-seen before awe-inspiring phenomenon!!

WHOOOOOSH!!!!!

The throne chamber was packed with a blinding light and raging winds as The Paragon of Sins' core was forced into assimilation with Felix by the universe itself.

Nothing could go against the universe's authority, not even so Lilith could stop this process from finishing anymore!

Because it was the universe's own will, the union was surprisingly painless...The agony of such processes was usually because of going against nature or the universe's will, like the bloodline integration system.

If it was a natural process, humans wouldn't feel a single entity since they wouldn't know even so when it happened.

As the core integrated with Felix, his body became the canvas for a series of profound transformations.

The once prominent horn that had marked his heritage fell away, signifying the shedding of his old self.

His dark red hair, a symbol of his vitality and demonization, turned a luminous white and began to proliferate, cascading down his back in a silken river that stretched tens of meters behind him...

It was as if his very essence was being rewritten, each strand of hair a testament to his newfound purity and strength.

"Surprising path of evolution...I thought he would get more demonic and beastial." J?rmungandr commentated.

The rest of the tenants shared the same sentiment, knowing that the paragon of sins' core would dominate the mutations' path since the rest of the bloodlines couldn't resist its authority.

Yet, it turned out they have spoken a bit too soon...Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
