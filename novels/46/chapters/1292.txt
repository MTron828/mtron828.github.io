1293 A Cowardly Queen?

"Target has been eliminated." Commander Nethrael announced calmly as he watched a mushroom cloud rising up to the sky.

It was so massive, it covered the entire demon city and outside of its walls, making it impossible to see the extent of the damage.

'I doubt any demon will be able to resurrect after this.' Asna remarked.

'Likewise.' Felix nodded with a solemn tone.

He was certain that even the Netherling King should have dropped dead for real since the nuke dropped on them had utterly wiped out hundreds of kilometers of surface area!

This was more than enough to erase whatever evil energy was in the vicinity.

Since demons' resurrections occur only when they had a link to nearby evil energy, cutting off their connection in such a forceful manner made it impossible for them to resurrect.

Unless there was another method of resurrection they had no clue about.

"Are the captives good?" Queen Allura asked.

"All of them must have been put into long slumbers as we are still unable to wake them up after breaking the coffins."

Commander Nethrael reported his findings.

Before the city was blown out, his elite task force consisting of strong fighters and battle space worms managed to hit all of the dungeons under the city and rescue the captives in less than ten seconds.

With the space worm's spatial portals, it was a light work mission...The other fleets also got into action and rescued the other captives around the demon territory.

"Since they are considered as nothing but stored food, they must have been put in comas to limit their energy consumption and in turn limit the required nutrition." Queen Allura ordered, "Start them on new diets and wait for them to wake up naturally to void any system shocks."

"Understood." Commander Nethrael nodded and forwarded the order to his subordinates.

"I honestly didn't think the demons will be this easy to handle." Emperor Lokhil grinned, "It's really easy to lose track of how strong the alliance's weaponry systems."

"Let's not get too cocky." Queen Alfrada said calmly, "The Netherlings are a mere bunch of rogue demons situated at the edge of their universe. They might not match us in technological advancements but this didn't mean that other demons are the same."

"She is right." Minister Aquiris supported with a stoic tone, "If demons lack in technology, they must have something just as better to help them conquer the other side and have seven demon realms in it."

The alliance's technology was obviously on a different level due to the metal race involvement...But, this didn't mean that other races would be nothing without them.

"Should we begin with eliminating the remaining demons around the planet?" Commander Nethrael requested permission.

"It will be difficult without nuke-level power or individuals capable of interdimensional abilities." Felix responded.

Felix didn't want to turn the planet into a wasteland more than it was by using mass destruction weapons for each small patch of demons...That was just madly inefficient.

"So, what do you suggest?"

"Leave them be for now." Felix said calmly, "We have already eliminated more than 80% of demons on this planet and even their king. As long as we gather all Luminaris in their capital city and protect them, those demons will be forced to group up and launch an invasion on the capital to feed on their purities. Then, we can nuke them before that happens."

With just a bit of information about demons and Felix was already finding their weaknesses left and right.

The fact that demons' greatest nightmare was associated with something controllable made it easier to predict and manipulate them.

"That's indeed much better than a useless goose chase."

No one disapproved of the plan as it made the most sense.

On the opposite side of the planet, the Luminaris capital city was as bustling and bright as ever...But this time, it was for a different reason entirely.

"Did a volcano erupt on the demons' territory?"

"God I hope so."

All of the Luminaris around the city was discussing the echo of the thundering explosion that traveled across the entire globe.

Everyone noticed that the source was in the demons' territory, which brightened the day of some and made others a bit worried.

"Are we going to be attacked by the demons?" A beautiful short-haired little girl murmured with a scared expression.

She was holding hands with a middle-aged man who had a long black mustache and somewhat dim-lighted wings, unlike the little girl.

"That's impossible unless they want to get themselves killed as well." The middle-aged man comforted his daughter with a confident tone.

"Why?"

"Because we are much stronger than them." The middle-aged man spoke with an exaggerated cocky tone but deep inside, he was smiling bitterly.

His child was still too young to understand the f*cked reality of their situation.

But, the moment she grew up, she would start seeing the truth, the hideous and traumatizing truth.

The truth of this capital and why was it still standing without a single demon coming near it...

"Daddy, what's that?"

Suddenly, his daughter pointed her finger at the sky with a curious expression.

When her father lifted his head, his eyes couldn't help but pop out of his sockets in utter shock at the unbelievable sight before him.

"Oh god..."

"Is the sky falling!"

"Mommy!!"

One by one, the pedestrians shared the middle-aged man's reaction as their feet were frozen in utter horror at the sight of the Gamma Mothership entering the atmosphere right above the city.

It was so freakishly massive, it was thousands of kilometers in the sky, casting a massive shadow on the city and completely hiding the sun forever!

Although the sun was nowhere to be seen, the Mothership was packed with blinking lights that made it resemble a canvas Although the sun was nowhere to be seen, the Mothership was packed with blinking lights that made it resemble a canvas for a river of stars.

Meanwhile, in the biggest palace in the city, the Luminaris' royal family's members had their mouths agape and hearts clutched tightly in fear and agitation.

All of the royal family members in the throne chamber turned to look at their Queen for answers, but her stunned expression made them realize that she had nothing to do with this situation.

"My Quee..."

Just as the guard got control over his chaotic emotions and wanted to take his Queen to the safe room, an illuminating spatial portal opened up in the center of the throne chamber.

This caught everyone by surprise and made them activate their strongest light abilities to protect themselves and most importantly their Queen.

However, the instant Mika walked out of the spatial portal and released her spiritual pressure, everyone dropped to the ground but the Queen.

She wasn't tough, it was simply Mika taking it easy on her.

Mika stepped to the side and lowered her head in respect to her king who walked outside of the portal right after her.

The moment the Queen saw Felix's appearance, her eyes widened in disbelief while her heart sunk to the bottom of her stomach in horror.

Even her legs seemed to start shaking, making it impossible for her to remain standing on her feet.

When Felix saw her reaction, he was turned completely speechless.

He looked at Mika and asked, "Is there something in my face?"

"No?" Mika tilted her head in confusion at the Queen's reaction.

'Hahahaha! It must be your demonic appearance. You look more like a demon than demons themselves.' Asna laughed out loud in amusement.

'Is it really that?' Felix had a displeased look, 'I knew my appearance won't be too liked around here, but I didn't think a Queen will react this poorly. No wonder their race is f*cked.'

When the Luminaris Queen saw Felix's expression turning for the worst, she fell on her knees immediately and begged with a tearful tone, "Please forgive me! Please don't eradicate my people! Please! Please!"

"..."

"..."

"..."

This time even the inner circle leaders and ten rulers were left utterly speechless at this Queen's cowardness.

She literally knelt before she could even ask for Felix's name, which made them wonder if they went too much with the fear factor.

They got their mothership close to the city and sent their grand supreme to the meeting for the sake of making the royal family cave in as smoothly as possible.

But now? They had no clue what to think.

'Is it just me or does it seem like she recognizes you?' Thor wondered lazily.

'I think so too.' Jormungandr nodded.

'How can that be right??' Felix was bewildered by their assumption.

He had never shown himself around here and he doubt that the Luminaris were capable of seeing the future.

Before he could question their assumption any further, the Queen finally lifted her head and requested with a stutter, ""Oh great Dem..on King Lucifer, I am will..ng to make my race a farming zone under your allegiance. Just please don't eradicate us!!"

"Demon King Lucifer??

"Huh??"

"Come again??"

This time everyone was left stunned√¢¬Ä¬¶
