Chapter 1661 The Second Ascension. II

1661 The Second Ascension. II

In his eyes, the entire universe operated on balance and order to the point, even the unigins were under duty chains to keep them in check.

Yet, here he was, watching as Felix, a human, proceeded to his second ascension and the second bestowal of unigin's divine gifts!

"The universe does care about balance more than anything," Lilith responded with a causal tone while licking a pink lollipop seductively, "While it has no consciousness to reason that Felix shouldn't possess two cores just because he has the candidacy attributes, it will weaken the gifts provided during the ascension to maintain its balance."

"You mean like the bestowed strength and such?" Thor asked with great difficulty, like he couldn't stomach the thought of talking to Lilith.

"Yep." Lilith nodded, "He obtained twenty-five million BF before and I am certain this time, he will probably obtain half of it or even less...The same will happen to other gifts."

The tenants seemed to understand and agree with her take as they had their own dealings with the universe's way of doing things.

Just like anything it created, the balance was at its helm...Dragons were powerful, but low in numbers and cursed with uncontrollable pride.

Humans were born with a massive talent, but no cultivation system, no superhuman strength, or mental fortitude powerful enough to move objects.

All they had was their intelligence, strong adaptability, and cockroach-like reproduction system sprinkled with strong desires to own everything.

Elves had reproduction problems and were too trusting...Slimes were near unkillable with their rejuvenation powers, but their strength was utterly useless.

The same theory could be applied to any and every race born in this universe.

In the same manner, it was impossible to allow a person to obtain two or multiple unigin cores without changing anything about the enhancements provided.

Otherwise, by the fifth ascension, Felix would be at one hundred million BF without using a single drop of celestial energy to empower himself. ùëÖread latest chùíÇpters at n/ùíêv(e)lbiùíè(.)co/m

"It's still more than worth it. His new laws won't be touched and they are the real reward."

Lord Loki remarked as he watched Felix grunt while enduring the transformation, his body resonating with the raw power of the ascension.

ROOOOOAAAR!!!

The wrathful hydra tail began its metamorphosis at last, each scale cracking and turning into ashen magma...Lava dripped down its surface, glowing with an intense heat that mirrored the volcanic environment of the base!

"The hydra tail... it's evolving!" Candace observed aloud, a tone of awe in her voice.

The tail's horns ignited with blue flames, casting a brilliant light that danced around the room.

The flames formed a scorching aura around the tail, a fiery spectacle that symbolized the fusion of Felix's essence with Hephaestus' core.

As the ascension reached its climax, Felix felt a deep connection with the universe, a silent acknowledgment of his transformation.

The room was filled with the light of the transformation, casting long shadows against the rocky walls. The lava rivers and magma pools seemed to respond to Felix's ascension, their glow intensifying as if in recognition of the monumental event taking place.

Finally, the transformation was complete.

Felix opened his eyes, now imbued with a newfound power and presence...The wrathful hydra tail and the dragon's heart had become integral parts of his being, transformed into embodiments of celestial might.

Felix stood up, feeling the weight and potential of his new form even when his appearance hadn't changed...It was like the hydra tail was the only one going through the ascension.

RUUUUMMBLE!!!

Just as he wanted to comment on the transformation, a sudden universal thunderclap echoed through the cosmos, a sonic manifestation of the monumental event!

Its reverberations were felt across the entirety of the universe, touching every realm and being within it!

"It's official now..." Lady Sphinx remarked with a serious tone, "Hephaestus is dead and will no longer return."

This was the same thought that went through everyone involved. Before, even after Felix got rid of Hephaestus' soul, he still had the chance to return in the far future if Felix ever lost control over his core.

That's why Hephaestus said he would return and he should remember him, confident that no matter what Felix did, he would always return.

But now? Felix was considered officially by the universe as the new Guardian of Fire and Magma.

In other words, if the core was lost and Felix's soul was gone, he would be the one returning in the far future!

"Well, this won't sit well with the other unigins," Felix remarked with a faint cold smirk, understanding that they were smart enough to figure out the truth on their own.

Such a universal realm across Thunderclap resounded only for such scenarios connected to unigins and at this moment, there weren't many options to choose from.

As he expected, the instant the thunderclap landed in the unigins' ears, every one of them frowned their eyebrows and gazed into the distance with a tint of puzzlement in their eyes.

After a few moments of brainstorming on the source of the thunderclap, their hearts skipped a beat after realizing that only one option could explain the timing.

"Impossible...That's just impossible?!"

"Second ascension?! Was this his reason for targeting Hephaestus' core?! It can't be."

"The universe will never allow such a blatant break of its order...Never!"

No one dared to believe their assumption even if it was the only feasible outcome...Without hesitation, they reached out to the three rulers and requested their confirmation, knowing that Felix should be on their radar.

The three rulers neither seemed impressed nor surprised by the whole matter...They merely reported back with an indifferent tone, "He has ascended again."

It was like they already knew Felix was going for it and would succeed in pulling it off.

"..."

"..."

"..."

After Athena, Zeus, and the rest received their confirmation, they sat on their thrones in utter silence.

Even with a confirmation, it was still too difficult for them to accept it.

A unigin with control over eight types of laws was already too strong in their eyes and now he was geared up with the laws of fire, magma, plasma, and anything connected to heat?

How could they acknowledge it?

"If he still can continue with multiple ascensions somehow, then, he will be coming for us...Not for our celestial energy but for our cores." Aeolus gulped a mouthful in dread, having a slight feeling of being a pray creeping up on him.

This was the first time he ever sensed like his life was in danger since no one could kill unigins even if their souls were erased. But this? This was different.

He made the universe consider him as the second replacement without giving it the chance to even consider reviving the dead unigin!

In another sense, it would lead them to a true death and none of them had ever considered about it before or were ready mentally to acknowledge such a damning fate!

'Change of plans.' Athena reached out to all unigins at once and uttered with a cold tone, 'This is a matter of life and death now. We are in the presence of not an invader but a unigin slayer...Use everything to find him and take him out before he grows stronger than our reach. Poseidon, Apollo, this is also connected to your life and I refuse to have you stay it out.'

'I ain't planning on doing that.' Poseidon replied coldly.

After finding out that Hephaestus was dead for real and his laws stolen, Poseidon realized that Felix might prioritize returning his territory from him.

He had no intention of waiting until he showed up before his front step.

'I will search for him too.' Apollo interjected with a serious tone.

While he really wanted to find Felix, he didn't mention that it was for the other reason...His peers were satisfied with his involvement, knowing that the search would be much easier with him.

'One day, we have to locate him in less than a day.' Athena finished the discussion with a cold statement, 'He needs to be caught before he can get used to Hephaestus' laws.'
