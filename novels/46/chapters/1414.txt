Ôªø1415 The Traveler Vs Ravager! I

Meanwhile, in the living world...

In the heart of a secret, underground lab, hidden from prying eyes and filled with state-of-the-art equipment, Lady Sphinx moved with an air of somber determination.

The room was bathed in sterile, white light, highlighting the endless rows of gleaming machinery and complex circuitry.

In the center of the lab was a large medical pod, almost ethereal with its soft, blue light illuminating the room.

Inside, floating in a sea of preserving liquid, was Felix's lifeless body. His once vibrant, brown eyes were closed, his strong, scarred physique at rest.

The pod was surrounded by screens that showed a vast amount of data. This included the fluctuations of his weak heartbeat and the careful maintenance of his cells.

Every second of data was crucial, a silent testament to the man who once roamed free and conquered the universe.

'Kraken, how is it going in there?' She asked.

'He has just reached the finals in the tournament and Asna is still residing in a private palace under Lord Hade's protection.' Elder Kraken informed after receiving the news from his main consciousness.

'It's been more than a decade here and he has yet to complete two months there.' Lady Sphinx frowned, not too pleased with the current time difference.

The time difference between the spirit realm and the living world was random and ever-changing. At the moment, it was against Felix.

After all, it would be meaningless to return if the entire universe had entered a new era and everyone in the UVR era had become dust beside the immortals.

'All we can do is hope for the shift to happen soon.' Thor sighed.

'I never thought I would miss a kid before, but spending an entire decade without him and Asna is quite boring.' Carbuncle confessed, pushing smoke rings in the direction of Lord Shiva to irritate him.

Lord Shiva expressed his opinion on the matter, stating, "What would be the purpose of bringing him? He will perish just as quickly."

'This again? Didn't we tell you to save your pessimistic view to yourself?" Thor got annoyed.

Who could blame him? Ever since Lord Shiva was revived, he seemed to have completely given up the idea that Felix could dethrone those beings.DiisCoover ùíñpdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)coùíé

In his eyes, the moment someone gets targeted by them, their visa in the universe had expired.

"I am just saying, right this instant, they can be watching us, waiting for the looks on our faces when they kill him the moment we finally bring him back." Lord Shiva opened a magazine and read it lazily, "I ain't going to give them the satisfaction of seeing that."

"How useless, I don't know why Sphinx even bothered to bring you back." Thor clicked his tongue in criticism.

Lord Shiva ignored him and continued reading his magazine.

"Let's bring him back first and see what happens," J√∂rmungandr glanced at Lady Sphinx and inquired, "By the way, have you reached out to Lord Quetzalcoatl yet?"

"No, he is still missing and Lord Osiris' death strings can't work on him." Lady Sphinx shook her head.

"Plan B depends on him heavily, I wish he shows up sooner than later."

"Him showing up isn't the problem, it's whether he will accept your preposterous request." Lord Loki jumped in, his tone was as playful as ever.

"We still haven't used the ticket he gave us, we can only try our best to convince him." Lady Sphinx said.

"Let's hope for the best..."

Back to the heavenly plane...The Next Morning.

In the heart of the colossal coliseum, an immense crowd sat in electrifying anticipation. Their roars of excitement shook the very foundation of the arena as they awaited the spectacle that was about to unfold.

The climax of the tournament had arrived. The final duel between Felix and Ravager!

"And now," the host's voice simmered down to a crackle, tantalizing the audience with anticipation, "A fighter who emerged from the shadows, a dark horse who trampled expectations and forged a path in this tournament that none of us saw coming."

He let the silence stretch, the excitement in the crowd palpable, "His determination has moved mountains, his courage faced the fiercest of foes. The brilliance of his strategy, the unyielding resilience of his spirit, earned him a place in this final!"

Again, Mr. Sogrus paused, his gaze locked on Felix, "Carrying the powers of sound and fire, a man who stood against the storm, a fighter whose very existence is defiance. I present to you, the one who beat the odds...THE TRAVELER!!"I think you should take a look at

WOOAAH!! CLAP CLAP CLAP!!...

And then, as if a giant had struck the earth, the crowd erupted, a thunderous cheer that filled the coliseum!

There was excitement, awe, curiosity, and perhaps even a hint of fear in their eyes. But Felix, like a tranquil sea amidst a raging storm, walked in a calm and composed manner in the direction of the arena.

He was carrying behind him a standard silver hammer, a unique weapon of choice in the eyes of the viewers.

Next, Mr. Sogrus introduced The Ravager, giving him the same love and hype as Felix.

"Allow me to introduce to you a man whose very name sends shivers down the spines of the bravest fighters. A man whose power is as relentless as the storm and as unpredictable as wildfire. A man who has climbed to the top, overcoming every challenge, every obstacle, like they were mere pebbles in his path!"

"With a heart crafted from the flames of adversity, and a will as resolute as the mountains, I present to you, the embodiment of sheer dominance... Ravager!"

The crowd erupted into deafening applause, their voices united in a single monstrous roar that echoed through the vast expanses of the coliseum.

As the sound waves crashed over him, Ravager remained unfazed, his icy eyes meeting Felix's across the arena, a silent declaration of the impending epic clash.

"It's best if you surrendered and saved both of our times." Ravager spoke calmly, "You have already earned a decent reward and a qualification slot to the heavenly plane by being second."

"I could say the same to you," Felix replied nonchalantly.

"If that's how you feel, don't blame me for what happens next."

With that being said, The Ravager kept his mouth shut and entered his battle stance.

The air in the coliseum was saturated with anticipation as both combatants squared off.

Felix's figure radiated an ember-like glow, his vibration abilities subtly rippling the air around him while Ravager seemed to embody the elements he commanded, a tempestuous whirlwind of water, wind, and fire swirling about his form.

"All set?" Mr. Sogrus glanced at them both for a moment before yelling, "FIGHT!"

Whoosh!!

Ravager was the first to make a action as he raised his hands, beginning the elemental dance.

"Aqua Torrent!" He uttered, sending a colossal wave of water cascading towards Felix, its sheer mass promising to crush him.

But Felix was ready.

"Vibration Dissipation." he chanted to himself, channeling his energy, he sent a series of tremors into the ground, creating barriers of vibrating air that parted the water around him, turning Ravager's tidal wave into innocuous streams that pooled at the edges of the arena!

Taking advantage of Ravager's momentary pause, Felix retaliated.

"Inferno Burst."

His hands, glowing bright red, shot fireballs that hurtled toward Ravager with intense heat.

Ravager swiftly countered a powerful gust encircled him, diverting the fireballs away.

The audience gasped as the diverted flames formed a fiery ring around the perimeter of the battlefield.

Ravager wasn't going to give Felix a instant to rest.

Whipping his hands in a fluid motion, he merged his mastery over wind and fire to summon a twister of flames that he directed toward Felix!

Felix braced himself. His entire being hummed as he emitted a barrier of anti-elemental vibrations, neutralizing the blazing tornado and causing it to spiral upwards and dissipate in a shower of embers!

Seeing an opening, Felix initiated his next move, he thrust his palm forward, sending a focused vibration beam toward Ravager.

Ravager, not to be outdone, deftly responded with a thick water barrier that not only absorbed Felix's attack but refracted it in multiple directions, making it harmless!

With that, both parties seemed to have come to a understanding that simple long-range attacks weren't going to work on their opponent.

"Time to end this."

So, Ravager decided to tap into Felix's weakness right away, not in the mood to fool around!
