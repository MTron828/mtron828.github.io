Chapter 1575 A Swift Opportunistic Ambush!

Ôªø1575 A Swift Opportunistic Ambush!

He understood that not many primogenitors would bet on him even when he had proved his worth again and again.

After all, his opponent was the creation primogenitor and if even he didn't know how to win against him without his spiritual pressure, how could the others believe in him?

"Here, take this, it's not much, but I hope it helps you with whatever you are dealing with." Cyclope suddenly removed a ring from his finger and placed it on Felix's palm.

When Felix looked inside the ring and saw a ten-kilometer mountain of elemental minerals, shining and glittering like a brilliant star, he was left with no words.

"Elder, you don't have to..."

"It's just some elemental minerals and I have already retired, so I won't be using them anyway." Cyclope interrupted him with a deep grin, "Don't reject it, pay me by using my masterpiece in your fight."

"This...I can't make promises." Felix sighed wryly, knowing that his strategy had no use for his cosmosbreaker.

"That's enough for me." Cyclope chuckled while floating away.

"Thank you..." He murmured.

Felix knew that such an amount of elemental minerals would save him years if not decades of painstakingly hard work.

Just as he was about to put it in his spatial card, Lady Yggdrasil came forward and patted Felix on the head with a gentle smile. Then, she placed another green ring on his palm.

"I wish you the best of luck, little one...Use this so you won't die again, my daughter can't handle the trauma twice."

"..."

Felix glanced at the ring and his senses got connected to it immediately, allowing him to look inside of it.

The moment he saw the massive hundred-kilometer garden of ripe natural treasures in it, his eyes were remained frozen in shock.

"Elder...I can'..."

"I don't know why are you still trying your best to become stronger, but whatever it is, I really desire you don't lose yourself in the journey."

Lady Yggdrasil advised with a breezy calming voice before leaving his side without the ring, not giving him a chance to return it.

As he watched their retreating backs, Felix felt a deep sense of gratitude for everything they had done for him.

They may not be his masters or tenants with bloodline relations, but Felix achieved a decision to invite them officially inside his consciousness space after the battle.

It might not seem like much, but if Felix ever made it to the eternal kingdom, his consciousness space would be the most desirable area in the entire universe!

He would be the first outsider to step foot in the land of the gods and everyone would want to see the other side.

'Let's not think about anything else now.' Felix refocused on his upcoming battle. 'Lord Marduk has given me the perfect opportunity to strike by not being here. I can't miss it.'

Felix planned on ambushing Lord Marduk the instant he made his presence on the battleground, not giving him even a chance to prepare or talk!

It might seem cowardly and opportunistic, but he didn't give a crap.

As Felix heightened his senses to the limit, believing that Lord Marduk would appear in the next minutes or hours at least, he was left gravely mistaken.

Days went by and then weeks. Yet, Lord Marduk was nowhere to be seen.

As the final hours of the deadline ticked away, a sense of uncertainty began to stir among the onlookers.

Whispers and murmurs rippled through the ranks of the Primogenitors, speculating on Marduk's absence.

Felix, however, remained undeterred, his gaze unwavering, his stance resolute.

Then, as the last day dawned, heralded by the eerie light of the dangerously close stars, the fabric of space itself began to warp and shiver, signaling the imminent arrival of Lord Marduk.

And then, Lord Marduk emerged from a crackling spatial rift, his presence commanding and majestic.F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

His appearance was not rushed or hurried; instead, he carried the aura of timeless authority, a being for whom deadlines were but mere constructs.

He surveyed the gathered assembly of primogenitors with a measured gaze, acknowledging their presence with a nod that spoke of his ancient stature.

Just as he stepped fully outside of the spatial rift, the vast emptiness of space became the stage for a sudden and electrifying assault!!!

As planned, Felix, calculating and swift, seized the opportunity to gain the upper hand in this monumental confrontation!

With tactical brilliance, he transformed himself into a bolt of lightning, a living embodiment of speed and power!

Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!

This transformation was more than a mere spectacle; it was a strategic maneuver much better than teleportation since it remained no spatial disturbance as a giveaway!

Felix, now a streak of electrifying energy, cut across the cosmic expanse with a speed that defied perception!

The gathered primogenitors, themselves beings of immense power, could barely track his movement as he hurtled towards Marduk!

In an instant, Felix materialized beside Marduk, still in his form of pure lightning.

The proximity was so sudden, so unexpected, that it caught even the creation primogenitor off guard!

Before Lord Marduk could fully orient himself to his surroundings or react to Felix's presence, Felix unleashed his spiritual pressure!

Whoosh!!!

The spiritual pressure emanated from Felix in waves, distorting the space around them, a palpable force that even the primogenitors could feel weighing upon them!!

The instant they sensed its overbearness compared to theirs, they were remained utterly stunned.

'Impossible...'

'It can't be...

'No wonder...'

It's a declaration of intent, a statement of Felix's resolve and unyielding confidence!

Lord Marduk, momentarily taken aback by the swiftness and audacity of the assault, regained his composure.

Alas, it was already too late and his body and soul were already under the grip of Felix's spiritual chains.

Felix switched back to his human form and placed his divine cosmosbreaker axe's blade on Lord Marduk's furry neck.

"Checkmate," Felix uttered calmly.

"..." Lord Marduk remained silent, unable to speak even if he wanted...Felix had gone all out on his spiritual pressure to make sure he wouldn't turn this around.

Meanwhile, the primogenitors gathered to witness the epic confrontation between Felix and Lord Marduk, were frozen in a state of shock.

With Felix's swift and strategic assault, the expected clash of cosmic titans was over almost before it began.

The scene of Felix, still emanating his spiritual pressure, holding his axe to Marduk's neck, remained the assembled deities in stunned silence.

Their reactions slowly turned into murmurs of disbelief and awe.

Siren, her voice usually melodious, now carried a note of incredulity. "I knew that boy's confidence won't stem from nothing, but this..." she said, trailing off, her gaze fixed on the scene before her.

"Lord Marduk, the master of creation was subdued in less than a millisecond...Is this really happening?" Erebus muttered.

'Marduk, have you lost your touch after burying your head in those inscriptions?'

Lord Quetzalcoatl shook his head with a wry smile...He already knew about Felix's spiritual pressure, but he still assumed that Lord Marduk would be able to handle it.

"No wonder he was able to take down the rest of the darkins and even enslave them. No one can beat this..." Kumiho remarked with a tint of fear in her eyes, knowing profound down that it was almost impossible to handle such a combo.

Most of the primogenitors had placed themselves in Lord Marduk's positions and realized that their fates would be sealed as well!

"Do you surrender?" Felix asked indifferently.

If it was up to him, he would have demonized Lord Marduk, but there was no way the primogenitors would sit tight and watch this happen...Especially the elemental lords.

Alas, Lord Marduk wasn't going to make his life easier.

'Primogenitors don't surrender.' Lord Marduk replied casually, 'You either leave me be or kill me.'
