Chapter 1645 Each With Their Own Scheme!

1645 Each With Their Own Scheme!

That's what Hephaestus and many other unigins were left to believe with those two's heated and conflicting relationship.

But in reality? Poseidon's motives go deeper than this...

At the moment, a strategic meeting was taking place in the heart of Poseidon's underwater palace, a grand structure of coral and pearl shimmering beneath the ocean's surface. F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Poseidon sat upon his throne of seashells and tridents, his presence commanding and regal.

Beside him stood his right-hand subordinate, Admiral Nereus, a seasoned warrior known for his tactical acumen and unwavering loyalty.

Nereus's appearance was striking, with long, flowing hair that seemed to float in the water, and eyes as deep and blue as the ocean itself.

His position under Poseidon was much higher than even Duke Humphrey in the eyes of Hephaestus!

So, one could imagine him possessing his radiant divinity blessing directly from the three rulers compared to others needing it from Poseidon.

With a thoughtful expression, Admiral Nereus questioned, "My lord, why do I sense there is more to this war than a mere territorial dispute?"

Poseidon's eyes narrowed, a hint of a cunning plan flickering in his gaze. "Astute as always, Nereus. This war is but a stage, a lure for a greater player in this game..."

Admiral Nereus arched an eyebrow. "Is it the ascendant mortal? Do you intend to draw him into our conflict?"

With a slight smile, Poseidon replied, "Exactly...By prolonging this battle and showcasing our strength, it gives the boy a spectacle to ponder upon. He's calculating, always watching and waiting for the right moment to strike. I am certain if we gave him some time to settle down and lick his wounds, he would realize that our war is the perfect chance for him to act up and try to steal some of our celestial energy...That's my real target."

Admiral Nereus considered this, his tactical mind analyzing the implications. "A clever ploy, my lord...But we must tread carefully. Lord Hephaestus and the rest of the unigins will most definitely see through our plans if we prolong this war more than necessary. This will give them a chance to participate in the trap, complicating the situation more than we would like."

Poseidon leaned forward, his eyes reflecting the depths of his domain.

"That is a risk I am willing to take." He said coldly, "I am no longer interested in playing war with that prick...It's time to evolve and join the upper ranks. Capturing Asna's core is the easiest path at the moment."

Suddenly, he showed a shrewd smirk, "But still, don't worry, I am not going to wait until the kid gets lured in slowly, I will give him one last shove if he doesn't make his move in the upcoming weeks."

Nereus bowed slightly, acknowledging the wisdom of his lord. "As you command, my lord. I shall ensure our forces are prepared for any eventuality, whether from Hephaestus or the mortal."

As the meeting concluded, Poseidon gazed out into the vast ocean from his palace, his thoughts as deep and unfathomable as the seas he ruled.

This war was more than a clash of elements; it was a chess move in a larger game of divine politics, and Poseidon was determined to emerge as the master of these turbulent waters.

If it wasn't for Poseidon's character and his constant desire to seek out the spotlight, everyone would have assumed his true motive right from the beginning.

It was a simple definition of pattern recognition and no matter how intelligent someone was, it would be difficult for them to ignore the pattern and jump straight into questioning.

But as Admiral Nereus said, this would not last for long and it wouldn't be long before everyone realized that his motives go beyond making a fool of his rival.

But for now, even Felix wasn't suspecting anything from the war...Though, as a careful person from a young age, he always considered anything he walked into as a trap.

In this case? Whether it was a trap or not, in his eyes, it wouldn't affect his plan negatively in the slightest!

***

A week later...

The construction of the void nation's base was progressing at an impressive pace. The void citizens worked tirelessly, their every action coordinated and purposeful.

The base began to take shape, rising from the barren ground like a beacon of hope and resilience.

Everyone had a role to play, and they performed their duties with a sense of urgency and commitment.

From the setting up of defensive perimeters to the establishment of living quarters and command centers, every task was carried out with efficiency and precision.

Having a base was a must since it gave everyone something to call 'home' in this heartless and unwelcoming kingdom...Even if it was a temporary base, it was better than being homeless.

While his citizens were working their asses off, Felix wasn't lazing around either.

He was focusing his entire efforts on cloning wrathful creators and accelerating the creation of void creatures through any means necessary.

As expected, the universe was soon to interfere and halt his infinite cloning glitch the moment he cloned more than six hundred wrathful creators.

The instant the number of wrathful creators reached seven hundred, their original number, the universe began sending warnings by tightening the golden shackles on him, putting him in the worst possible pain ever!

Felix was forced to swallow the pain and continue abusing his laws as he knew that his plan depended on them.

If it wasn't for the universe's punishments, he would have evolved his entire nation.

Unfortunately, he was able to help out only his councilmen with some new symbols before the universe gave him a warning to go no further...After all, he was bestowing laws not elements.

"It's been a week since the start of the war and Poseidon's troops have steadily been gaining more territory for their lord." Felix commentated as he spectated the war's condition with his tenants.

"Neither unigins have made an appearance." Thor remarked with a deep frown, "Is this how wars between unigins are? Send their subordinates to fight while they keep each other in check with divinities? How is this any different than what elementals do in Foremother Siamese's galaxy?"

"Well, either this, or they could go all out on each other and waste their divinities just to end up in the same spot," J?rmungandr replied.

"If the other unigins are greedy, they might jump over their borders and seek to invade them, taking advantage of their weakness." Lady Sphinx added.

"I know, I know, but still, it doesn't change the fact that it's quite boring like this." Thor shook his head, "If this is their only source of diversion in this forsaken land, then, no wonder they created us to make the universe livelier."

The rest of the primogenitors chuckled, knowing that he was taking a jab at the unigins' boring and void lifestyle.

"If entertainment is what they seek, then I am going to shove it down their throats until they beg me to stop." Felix smiled coldly.

"Ohh, is it time to make the first step?" Lord Loki asked with a hint of glitter in his eyes.

He received his answer soon enough.

Felix switched his focus to the sloth-form clone and activated the Out of Body Slumber Symbol for four clones at once!

The moment it manifested above his head, slowly, their physical forms began to relax, entering a state of deep, peaceful slumber, while their spirit started to disengage from the confines of their corporeal body.

There was a moment of transcendence, a feeling of liberation, as Felix's spirit fully separated and emerged from his physical form.

'I quite missed this feeling.' Felix smiled nostalgically as he scanned his spiritual body...The clones also did the same.

Since he was already used to the feeling of being a spirit, it took him less than a instant to orient himself in this new form.

However, as he lifted his head and gazed around him, he was met with a spectacle that rendered him speechless, a vista beyond his wildest imagination.

The wasteland of the Eternal Kingdom, which had seemed desolate and lifeless in its physical form, was teeming with an unfathomable number of spirits in the spiritual realm!!

These spirits floated aimlessly, like a sea of misplaced souls, each one adrift in its silent world!

The spirits varied in form and appearance, some ethereal and faint, others more defined and radiant.

They moved with no particular purpose, their paths meandering and aimless, creating a mesmerizing spectacle.

Felix stood, or rather, floated amidst this sea of spirits, his spectral form a mere whisper among countless others.

The spectacle was hauntingly beautiful yet profoundly disconcerting. Each spirit seemed to carry its tale, a whisper of a life once lived, now reduced to a wandering wisp in this ghostly wasteland.

"This is the result of Lord Hades locking the spirit realm from the eternal kingdom." Lilith remarked casually, "Anyone who dies has his soul pushed to wander the wasteland."
