Chapter 1652 The Second Round! IV

1652 The Second Round! IV

Meanwhile,Poseidon, observing the battlefield from a vantage point within his vast oceanic domain, watched with a mix of awe and concern as Hephaestus unleashed his devastating supernova attack on Felix's clone.

He understood that Hephaestus, in his current state of fury and unbridled power, was a force of nature, acting beyond the bounds of reason and strategy.

"Hephaestus has truly lost himself to rage," Poseidon mused inwardly, the waters around him reflecting his troubled thoughts. "If he finishes with the last clone, he will undoubtedly turn his wrath towards me. He's no longer thinking strategically; he's acting on sheer destructive impulse."

"Still, I ain't retreating."

With a cold smirk, he summoned the full might of his oceanic domain, urging the colossal tsunami to push forward with even greater force!

The massive wave, already a terrifying spectacle, grew in intensity and speed, driven by Poseidon's will to engulf and subdue Hephaestus's fiery territory.

Hephaestus's wisps attempted to stem the tide, using whatever was within their power to stop the tidal wave...But Poseidon's resolve was unyielding, and his command over the sea was absolute.

A mere cold look from him was enough to blow those wisps into fragments, leaving the fiery domain unprotected against his ambitious conquest!

Apollo, Zeus, Athena, and the rest of the unigins watched as Posedion's ocean began to consume the land of fire and brimstone, transforming it under the weight of its watery embrace!

Nothing and no one was able to stand before him and his oceanic might.

All Hephaestus could do was watch as his domain was being devoured, feeling like his soul was being feasted upon bit by bit.

Knowing that he could not stop Poseidon unless he dealt with Felix first, Hephaestus didn't have a single notion of fooling around with him.

He didn't even taunt or curse as usual!

With a series of swift, fluid motions, Hephaestus smashed five-star cores, one after the other, against the anvil of his hammer!

Each impact caused a brilliant eruption of light and energy, transforming the cores into focused beams of plasma. These beams, a hundred times more potent than his previous attacks, shot forth with the speed and intensity of a supernova's wrath!

The beams streaked across the battlefield toward Felix...Their brightness was blinding, their heat unimaginable, capable of turning anything in their path into ash!

Felix, realizing the immense danger these plasma beams posed, quickly assessed his options.

He understood that even a single beam could consume all the celestial energy protecting him, leaving him vulnerable to Hephaestus's wrath.

The stakes were higher than ever; a direct hit from any of these beams would spell certain doom.

Phew! Phew! Phew!!...

With agility born of necessity, Felix maneuvered swiftly, dodging the relentless onslaught of plasma.

He moved like a shadow, each leap and dive calculated to evade the searing paths of destruction!

The beams scorched the ground where he had been moments before, leaving trails of melted rock and vaporized metal in their wake!

As he evaded the beams, he sought an opening, a moment of vulnerability in Hephaestus's assault, to turn the tide, or at least to counter-attack...Alas, that was nothing but a mere fantasy.

Hephaestus might have lost himself to anger, but his battle sense had just gotten much better, akin to a warrior entering the zone in a moment of barbaric rage.

Thus, Felix found himself incapable of touching him regardless of what ability used...The few times where something did land, his radiant divinity shield blocked it.

'I can't keep up! He is bound to hit me sooner or later!' Felix's expression kept turning for the worse the more intense Hephaestus got in his attacks.

The worst part? Hephaestus was getting nearer and nearer to destroying his Supreme Symbol as there was no way Felix could defend both himself and the symbol against this onslaughter.

'I have to either commit to the finale now or give up.' Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Felix wanted before to move on with the final stage of his plan only after exhausting Hephaestus' divinities...But at this pace, he understood that he might end up losing his clone before it happened.

As for getting out of the massive magma sphere? Hephaestus was way faster than him at the moment and would never let that happen unless Felix used his greed laws to teleport him.

Even then, Hephaestus would appear instantly in front of him since they were battling above his domain.

'I have to commit, I won't have a better opportunity like this.'

As Felix was avoiding death by inches, he understood that opportunities were too rare. Where could he find a unigin with almost no divinities on him again?

Just this small taste, made him understand that unigins with the three divinities utilized at once were complete monsters.

He couldn't imagine battling one of them with a much more quantity than Hephaestus while he barely had enough to sustain his celestial flames shield.

No matter what he did, the balance would always favor the unigins.

'...'

'...'

The tenants remained silent, as they understood the risk Felix was about to partake and they didn't want to cloud his judgment with their opinions at such a critical moment.

Thus, they kept their mouths shut and watched as Felix commenced the last part of his master plan.

...

Back at the void nation's base, Felix's main consciousness, which had been monitoring the battle from afar, suddenly sprang into action.

His eyes snapped open, revealing a depth of resolve and cunning.

With focused intent, Felix invoked the greed laws, his first wish was to cloak the clone next to him from the prying eyes of the three rulers and the unigins.

Just as the price was about to get paid and the wish could commence, Felix made a second wish to teleport him to a specific location!

The two wishes overlapped and the moment the clone disappeared from the celestial eyes, he was already gone from Felix's side.

The unigins watching both the battle and Felix's base from their lofty vantage points, noticed the clone's sudden disappearance.

'Hmm? Where did his clone go?'

'Did he send him to help in the battle?'

'Instead of giving up on his clone, he sends another? Is he dumb? Doesn't he realize that his soul was receiving a beating like this?'

However, as they scanned the battle between Hephaestus and Felix, there was no sign of the clone...The confusion started to set in, their celestial brows furrowing in perplexity.

Just as they were grappling with the mysterious vanishing act, Felix made his second wish...A risky wish that no one would anticipate Felix to dare do not in a million years.

'Get me to the battlefield.'

A moment after Felix uttered his wish, he materialized right into the fray with a confident stride!!

His sudden appearance, especially with Asna's core within him, sent shockwaves of stupefaction and disbelief among the celestial onlookers!

"What?!"

"Did he lose his mind?!!"

"Huh?"

Even Athena was left with widened eyes, her brain working on extra juice to analyze this brazen act of bringing the coveted Asna's core directly into the heart of the battle.

However, in an instant, she broke out of her daze and swiftly left her throne, aiming to join the battlefield without an ounce of hesitation!

The same decision was made by every unigin as they all had one single thought in their minds!

'A chance!!'

What Felix had just done was the equivalent of bringing a fat piece of meat into the dens of the wolves...None of them spent a single moment caring about the protection of their territory when Asna's core was literally a few seconds away!

"You...Have you lost your mind?"

Meanwhile, Hephaestus was left staring at the real Felix standing in front of him with a startled gaze.

The brazenness and confusion were too much it quenched some of his anger and made him halt his assault, leaving some room for his brain to process this godsent opportunity placed before him!

"We are about to find out..." Felix uttered with an emotionless predatory tone as black flames started to ignite on his body.
