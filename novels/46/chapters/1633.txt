Chapter 1634 A Warm Welcome! I

1634 A Warm Welcome! I

Felix didn't get baited into doing it.

He understood that he could only push the gate open from this side. That's because the gate was considered as a one-way dimensional door on the universe's side.

In other words, opening it from the side of the eternal kingdom was like pushing a door open from its back, brute forcing its bolts.

This was the reason a significant amount of celestial energy was required to assist with opening the gate from their side.

While it was much simpler to open it from Felix's side, he was told that it wouldn't be easy for him to hold it open for a few seconds.

This signified that Felix had to commit the moment he pushed it open.

So, he ignored the weird call from the other side and started working on creating a void portal, connecting the gate to his void nation.

It had to be of an unprecedented scale, one capable of transporting even the colossal star-sized entities as World Eaters and Dreamers, along with the vast armies and citizens of the Void Nation.

With deep concentration, Felix extended his hands outward, his fingers tracing intricate patterns in the void.

The air around him began to shimmer, vibrating with the immense power he was channeling. He drew upon the essence of the void, manipulating its fabric with a precision and control that only someone of his caliber could achieve!

Slowly, a massive portal began to take shape. It started as a small rupture in space but rapidly expanded, its edges swirling with the dark energy of the void.

The portal grew larger and larger, soon dwarfing even the largest of planets, its size monumental enough to accommodate the star-sized beings.

As the portal stabilized, Felix gave a unified order to the three non-

intelligent unique void creatures.

The World Eaters, Dreamers, and the Wrathful Creators approached the portal with a slow, deliberate grace. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Despite their astronomical size, they still dwarfed in front of the Eternal Kingdom's gate as it was big enough, that thousands of them would still be able to go through it without struggle.

One by one, they entered the portal, their massive forms easily accommodated by its vast expanse.

This process took at least a day even with Felix's assistance since there were hundreds of each of those behemoths.

Only after they took an orderly formation in front of the gate did theVoid Nation armies and citizens begin their approach.

They were led by the councilmen, their presence commanding and assured...The armies were an impressive sight, composed of various void creatures, each ready for the journey ahead.

"Everyone here?" Felix asked as he played with Nimo's cheeks.

"Yes, no one was left behind and our entire operations were placed under the federation's responsibility," Candace murmured with an awed look as she gazed at the heavenly gate, feeling like she was unworthy to even look at it.

Most of the void citizens had the same expressions the moment they faced the eternal kingdom's gate.

"Good."

Felix waved his hand down and the portal closed off instantly...Then, his gaze roamed across his people.

He knew that this was more than just a mass migration; it was the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the Void Nation, a bold venture into the unknown.

"I will be opening the gate." Felix announced calmly, "I will be focusing on helping the behemoths pass through. So, the moment it opens, I want you all to rush inside as fast as possible. Anyone left behind will be left behind for good."

"Am I understood?"

"Yes!!"

Everyone replied simultaneously with serious expressions as they prepared to make a move.

Realizing the sheer scale of the task at hand, he began to channel his immense power, focusing on altering his very form to match the challenge.

First, he used the wrathful creation symbol, separating his body into seven perfect clones. Then, he sent two clones to assist the large void creatures and went with the rest towards the gigantic golden gate.

Before the eyes of the Void Nation, Felix and his clones began to grow, expanding exponentially until they stood as colossal entities, their size now half that of the Eternal Kingdom itself!

Yet, this was nothing as with Felix being a true unigin, he could increase and reduce his size as he wished to the point he could even reach the size of an entire galaxy!

It was the standard innate ability for all unigins and Felix was fortunate to get it since it didn't go against his evolution unlike swapping races like unigins could do.

"Dada!! Big Dada!!"

Meanwhile, Nimo was clapping his hands excitedly as he cheered on Felix while sitting on Candace's lap...It only took him a couple of days and he was already starting to learn how to speak under Candace's guidance.

Even when his figure was towering against the backdrop of stars and galaxies, a god-like presence in the vastness of space, Felix looked below and made a sly smile at Nimo, making him giggle in amusement.

Then, he refocused on the gate and narrowed his eyes coldly...With his immense hands, Felix reached for the golden gates.

They loomed before him, their size and grandeur undiminished even against his newfound stature.

His fingers wrapped around the intricate designs of the gate, feeling the celestial energy pulsating within.

'Push!'

The moment Felix got the perfect hold, he started pushing the gate with everything in his power until veins bulged out of his skin!

Roooarr!! Roooarr!!!!...

Behind him, his seven hydra tails, each a formidable force in its own right, came to life with renewed vigor.

BOOOOM!!! BOOOM!!...

They moved in unison with Felix's efforts, their heads pushing against the gate, their roars echoing through the void!

The Void Nation watched with a mixture of awe and apprehension. To them, Felix was more than their leader; he was their god, a being capable of challenging the very boundaries of the divine!

'OPEN!!'

With a deep grunt, Felix exerted his strength against the gates, the colossal doors, unaccustomed to such force, began to creak and groan under the pressure!!

Slowly, inch by painstaking inch, they started to give way...The hydra tails pushed and roared alongside Felix, their efforts synchronized with his.

As the gates parted, a brilliant light began to spill forth from the gap, a radiant glow that hinted at the wonders and mysteries that lay beyond.

"ALL TOGETHER!"

Felix, with one final, herculean effort, shoved the gates wide open with the assistance of his clones, each sharing the same level of strength as him!

KAAA-THUUUUDD!!!

This caused the gates to swing outwards with a resounding boom that reverberated through space.

"MOVE!"

Holding the gates open with their massive hands, Felix signaled for his Void Nation and armies to proceed!

"Go! Go! Go! Go!!"

Arthur and the councilmen shouted as they flew rapidly towards the blinding light, leading the fleets and legions of the Void Nation!

Meanwhile, Felix's two clones responsible for the behemoths used their spiritual pressure to lift them and hurl them towards the gate, above Felix and his clone's heads!

'Sh*t, I feel like I am being pushed against by an entire realm!' Felix gritted his teeth as his hold on the gates kept getting weaker and weaker.

He felt like the gate's weight kept doubling down each split second and if he didn't go through it in the next moments, it would snap back and close on him!

'We are all in!"

Fortunately, his citizens were reliable and all of them made it to the other side, leaving behind only some of the void creatures armies.

Felix didn't give a crap about the void-ling and the moment he received the confirmation, he let go with his clones and they jumped inside swiftly.

KAA-THUMB!!

The gates of the Eternal Kingdom snapped shut with a thunderous explosion and stood firm once again...

Those noises hadn't gone unnoticed by the residents of the eternal kingdom.

Zeus, Hephaestus, Demeter, Poseidon, Athena, Apollo, and Aeolus.

The seven lesser celestial unigins partaking in the bounty hunt all dropped whatever they were doing and turned their heads toward the eternal kingdom's gate.

All of them showed different reactions as some smiled in interest, some gazed with utter coldness, and some had calm looks like this entire situation meant nothing but business to them.

"He has arrived...I should go and give him a warm welcome." Apollo chortled while carrying behind his back a divine lyre.

It was a masterpiece of ethereal beauty, crafted from radiant unknown materials and adorned with intricate silver-colored filigree. Its strings shimmer like strands of the sun's own light.

As he played a single low-pitched note, his entire being shifted into a beam of light and he disappeared out of sight.

"He sure came quicker than I thought...Whatever, this is fine too."

Meanwhile, Zeus, in all his majestic grandeur, stood tall and commanding, his presence exuding the raw power befitting the True God of Thunder.

Clutched in his mighty hand was his weapon, a masterfully crafted thunderbolt, pulsating with an intense, crackling energy that seemed to resonate with the very essence of the storms.

With a swift, deliberate motion, Zeus hurled the thunderbolt into the sky, where it streaked across the heavens at the speed of light, a brilliant trail of electrifying energy in its wake!

In the same instant, Zeus himself transformed into a surge of lightning bolts, a spectacular display of divine power, as he merged with the weapon, becoming one with the thunderbolt, racing through the skies in a blinding flash of light and energy!

As for the rest? Some proceeded with the wind like Aeolus, some merged with the earth like Demeter, and some traveled through the roots and vines underneath the kingdom's infinite surface like Artemis.

Each used their fastest travel methods to cross this infinite floating piece of land. Yet, none of them would be faster than the godfather of fire and magma, Hephaestus.

As he was the only one daring enough to leave his territory unprotected and camp out the gate even when he had no clue about Felix's arrival time!!

At the moment, high above the vast panorama of the Eternal Kingdom, far from the golden gate through which Felix and his people made their momentous entrance, he was watching the scene from his magnificent magma throne.

Perched in the sky, Hephaestus's gaze was fixed on Felix, his sharp eyes missing no detail.

From this vantage point, he could see the colossal form of Felix as he parted the gate, and the disciplined ranks of the Void Nation as they passed through it.

"It's time to reclaim what was lost."

Knowing that his peers must be fast approaching, Hephaestus stood up from his throne and extended his palm forward.

Then, a powerful and undisturbed star core emerged as a medium sphere, before he began to compress it repeatedly until its intense, condensed energy began to warp and influence the gravity around it!

Just when it was about to reach the point of collapsing on itself and creating a tiny black hole, Hephaestus launched it in the direction of Felix and his people while uttering coldly:

"Welcome to the real world."
