ÔªøÔªø1702 The Last Dance. X

With an air of superiority and a cold smile, Uranus began to circle the weakened Felix like a hyena assessing its prey.Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))

"Ah, paragon, look at you now," Uranus remarked, his voice laced with mockery. "From challenging a ruler to lying here, drained and defeated...How the mighty have fallen."

Felix, struggling to even lift his head, could only glare at Uranus with a mix of defiance and resignation.

"Uranus...You're...still..in..my...domain," He managed to rasp out, each word a monumental effort.

Uranus laughed, a sound as chilling as the void itself. "Boy, I wasn't born yesterday. I have experienced the universe's punishments more than you can fathom. With the number of chains on you, your strength must be weakened by at least 99%."

"Your domain?" Uranus sneered as he neared his face to Felix, calling his bluff instantly, "Here, I challenge you to hit me or pressure me."

Felix attempted to muster any remaining energy for a retort or possibly a desperate counterattack, but the realization of his powerlessness was paralyzing.

Seeing that Felix wasn't able to even blink without flinching in agony, Uranus pulled back his head with a look of utter ridicule.

"You played with forces beyond your comprehension, paragon. This is merely the universe restoring balance."

"This isn't... the end," Felix whispered, more to himself than to Uranus, clinging to the last shreds of his resolve.

Alas, he knew deep down that what Uranus had uttered was the truth. With the number of chains on him, he couldn't even muster 1%, putting him in a crippling limitation.

This dire reduction rendered him unable to summon the territorial pressure of the void realm or utilize any of his law-based abilities effectively.

If he dared to go against the limitation and brute-force the shackles, he would be put in a world of pain.

When unigins were placed in this situation, they would be left with no other option but to enter a prolonged slumber to minimize the agony of their actions and also accelerate the punishment duration...

In Felix's case, both options weren't optimal.

"Of course, it isn't," Uranus' smile turned into irritation, "If it were up to me, I would have ended you right now and right here. Alas, the three rulers had to see value in you."

"But, don't be mistaken, little one...The third ruler said to bring you with one dying breath and I am planning to fulfill his request."

Uranus tightened his fist until intense vibrational frequencies started to shatter the structure of the void particles near it, causing them to crumble on themselves!

In the realm of cosmic laws, the power of vibration stood unparalleled, as the very fabric of the universe was woven from particles birthed by vibrational strings.

This fundamental truth placed vibration at the heart of physical existence, making it the architect of reality itself.

Thus, as the sovereign of vibration, he held dominion over the reality that unfolded before their eyes, commanding the very essence that constructed the universe!

"Ready for your judgment?"

Without waiting for him to respond, Uranus thrust his fist forward, it connected with Felix's stomach with a force that echoed on a level beyond the physical, delving into the realms of the subatomic!

Felix's eyes widened in shock and pain as he felt an indescribable sensation tearing through him!

It was as if the very essence of his being, the strings that held his atoms together, were being violently shaken, threatening to unravel his existence!

Blood burst from his lips in a violent spray as he was sent flying, a ragdoll tossed aside by an unseen cosmic force!

Felix had spent quite a bit of time exploring vibration as an element during his stay in the heavenly plane.

He even learned how to punch through spacetime, causing cracks in reality to appear...Now, before the real deal, he could be uttered to have yet to discover even 1% of the laws of vibration.

"Don't go limp on me now, I am just getting warmed up."

Uranus licked the blood of his fist, unbothered that his white beard was completely tainted.

Then, in a display of power that seemed to bend the very laws of nature, Uranus's fist moved forward, not with the brutality of a physical strike, but with an eerie grace, vibrating at a frequency that seemed to resonate with the fabric of spacetime itself.

As his fist approached Felix's chest, it didn't tear flesh, nor did it spill blood. Instead, it phased through his body as if it were passing through a mist, leaving no mark, no wound.

On the other side, Uranus's hand closed around Felix's heart, a grip that was both impossible and terrifyingly real!

Felix's eyes widened in shock and fear, not from pain, for there was none, but from the recognition of how utterly defenseless he was against such an attack!

From the consciousness space, Lady Sphinx, her eyes sharp with both awe and a hint of fear, watched the scene unfold.

'He must be manipulating the frequency of spacetime," She murmured, her voice barely more than a whisper, yet carrying the weight of her vast knowledge, "To pass through physical matter without altering it... Uranus wields the vibrational strings of the universe as if they were mere tools at his disposal."

"This kind of power, this kind of control, this kind of strength..." Thor reeled in dread, "He is fooling around with Felix, showing him that he can finish him in an instant if he desires."

"This isn't even his strongest form." J√∂rmungandr muttered with a hint of despair, "He can also control radiation, anti-matter, and gravity."

"Even if Felix was at his peak form, he would struggle to defeat him without abusing his powers."

Elder Kraken contributed with a deep helpless smile as he watched Uranus torture Felix in the most unique and painful possible way.

"aaaaa....gh...."

He was tightening his clutch on Felix's heart periodically, causing him to scream in a husky voice.

Uranus seemed to delight in Felix's screams, bobbing his head as if playing a musical instrument.

"Ah...such a pleasant melody, I can listen to it all day." Uranus uttered with a wide euphoric smile, making him resemble a deranged psycho.

Lilith and Lord Hades, watching Uranus' sadistic antics, were unsurprised. His multiple law embodiments made his personality unstable.

The only thing keeping him intact was the hope of escaping this universe and breaking free from its shackles.

Therefore, anyone who obstructed his path to this goal became his mortal enemy and was treated accordingly.

Felix's body went limp as the pain was too much for him to handle in his drained state.

He could barely keep his eyelids up, feeling like the last bits of energy were being sapped out of him...Even his voice could no longer be heard.

'I am lo...sing...it...I..Think...It's...ov..er..'

In such an inevitable condition, Felix recognized he was left with a singular, drastic option. An option that had almost a 100% of guaranteed his death, but at least, he wouldn't be caught and enslaved.

That was exploding one of the newly captured cores!

If it was up to him, he would have sacrificed one of the cores for a wish to escape from Uranus' clutches, even when the price was far too expensive for the wish.

Alas, he could not summon the equal-trade symbol any longer...

Aware that the resulting force would likely end his own life while inflicting severe injury on Uranus, he prepared himself for the ultimate sacrifice.

'Felix...Do..n..Sigh.'

Thor and the rest of the tenants wanted to stop him from going for such a drastic decision, but in the end, all they could was swallow their words with their emotions.

Candace was the only one still delusional to believe that Felix could be saved.

'Can't Lord Hades save him?! Please! Do something! Madam Lilith! Please help him!'

With tears flooding down her cheeks, she kept begging the only two unigins who seemed to have the powers to change the outcome.

Sadly, both of them ignored her pleas.

It wasn't out of nonchalance, but truly of helplessness.

Lilith had no powers outside of Asna's core and Lord Hades was still serving his universal punishment, leaving him powerless to deal with Uranus in his current state.

He knew that if he dared to open the spirit realm and pull Felix inside, Uranus would follow inside and get rid of them both.

He barely defeated Hephaestus in his state and Uranus was a different kind of monster.

'He is a true unigin now, he should die like this and be reborn later on if fate has it.' Lady Sphinx tried to justify Felix's action, but even she had difficulty accepting it.

'Thanks...for...everything...'

With one last remark of gratitude, Felix gathered his waning energy, focusing it toward the core with a grim resolve, the void seemed to pulse in anticipation of the impending cataclysm.

Just as Felix was about to release the destructive power of Zues' Core, a sudden whisper echoed in the void realm.

"Let there be light..."

The void realm, a place untouched by light for eons, was suddenly bathed in an overwhelming flash of pure, radiant light!

This light, unfathomably blinding and holy, cut through the darkness with an authority that commanded the very fabric of the realm to yield!

The darkness, a constant in the void, found itself recoiling, retreating before the light's advance, unveiling the realm's true appearance for the first time in memory!

Both Felix and Uranus were left completely blinded, forced to close their eyes reflexively.

'Oh no!'

The moment Uranus did this, he felt his heart sink to the bottom of his stomach and tried to open his eyes swiftly like his life depended on it.

Alas, he was a tad bit late...

"Let there be darkness..."
