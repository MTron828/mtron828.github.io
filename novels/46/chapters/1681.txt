Chapter 1682 Zeus/Poseidon vs The Paragon! I

1682 Zeus/Poseidon vs The Paragon! I

The moment he was done, Felix summoned a new sin-symbolic technique called the Prideful Aura of Supremacy!

A majestic golden sigil materialized above his head, bearing the proud image of a roaring lion that no mortal would dare face.

There was no other animal merged with the lion as this technique was created out of merging multiple symbols of the pride sin alone!

"Prideful Aura of Supremacy Technique." Zeus warned with narrowed eyes, "Be careful, this technique utilizes I am supreme, perfection manifestation, and clash of prides symbols. It boosts his strength by 5% each second as long as he believes his pride to be above us, which removes both the drawbacks."

"You don't have to tell me," Poseidon remarked coldly as he gazed at the radiant halo of golden light that enveloped Felix, magnifying his presence and might.

It was a clear declaration of superiority, a challenge that neither god could ignore since it targeted their pride.

Alas, the moment Felix ascended the second time, his inner pride had already evolved to the point it could challenge the lesser celestial unigins and even surpass them.

Felix never dared to bring out clash of prides against them before because he always had a subconscious feeling that he wasn't at the same level as unigins even after his first ascension.

But with the defeat of Hephaestus, that feeling was snuffed out.

"I ain't done yet."

With a fierce look, Felix invoked the Infernal Pact of Avarice and Wrath, his body becoming the conduit for a devastating fusion of desire and fury!

His hair transformed into blazing crimson flames, and his body took on a demonic red hue, radiating intense heat that seemed to warp the very air around him, turning him into a living inferno!

The Infernal Sigil above Felix absorbed the heat, turning it into crimson mist and fueling his anger to continue empowering him in a slow and controlled manner.

"What's this?" Zeus asked with a deep frown.

"I don't know." Poseidon remarked, "It must be a new technique."

Their assumption was correct as this technique was created out of merging Infernal Wrath, Rampage, and Avarice Amplifier symbols!

It was the first technique to have heat-related laws merged with sin symbols.

'What do y...'

Before they could analyze the technique, Felix appeared before Poseidon with an air of undeniable dominance.

With a movement that bridged the gap between thought and action, Felix brought the hammer down upon Poseidon with a force that resonated through the realm, a staggering ninety million Battle Force (BF) concentrated into a singular, devastating blow!!!

The impact was monumental, a instant frozen in time, where Poseidon's eyeballs almost popped off their sockets in a mix of shock and terror.

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

As time snapped back into its rightful pace, the aftermath was cataclysmic!

Poseidon's form, unable to withstand the immense force, disintegrated into countless water particles that shimmered momentarily in the air before dissipating everywhere!

His trident, a symbol of his power and authority, was sent careening into the distance, clattering against the dream-formed landscape!

'This...'

Witnessing the fate of his partner, Zeus felt a primal fear grip his divine heart.

In an instant, understanding the threat Felix posed, he transformed into a bolt of lightning, a pure expression of his desire to escape, and streaked across the realm, putting as much distance as possible between himself and Felix!

The moment his form was manifested, Zeus clutched his divine lightning spear tightly and looked at the far distance with a tint of fear in his eyes.

'That power...It's almost double mine. I can't, I can't contest against him without my divinities!'

Zeus wouldn't mind if Felix was ten or even twenty million BF force above him...In his eyes, that was a bit manageable even if he would be on the losing side.

But, thirty million, forty million? There was no way he would be able to resist a single attack from Felix and Poseidon's ending was the proof!

'I have to buy time until the three rulers deal with the black flames and come for him.' Zeus made a swift and smart decision to not overestimate his might and wait for reinforcement.

He understood that without divinities, the paragon would always come on top against the lesser celestial unigins due to the boosting effects of the symbols.

That's why Lilith was considered an upper celestial and feared across the realm.

Meanwhile, Felix couldn't be bothered with Zeus' escape...He merely glanced in his direction and turned his focus back on Poseidon.

While the strike had harmed Poseidon, it wasn't enough to kill him...His form rematerialized from water particles attached to the flying trident, which provided him with enough distance to recoup his thoughts and strategy.

'Sh*t, he turned into a freaking monster in no time...Damn you, Lilith!!' Poseidon cursed with bloodshot eyes.

As the one experiencing the hammer strike directly, he knew, no, he was certain, that Felix would beat them to smithereens in each confrontation.

Thus, instead of putting his pride to the test, he also decided to wait for reinforcement. ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

Alas, Felix was too strapped for time to let them have their way...

Before Poseidon could work out some guarding measures, he suddenly felt a massive weight placed on his shoulders.

This wasn't just any force; it was as if the entire realm's weight bore down upon the sea god, an oppressive, crushing force that mimicked the inescapable grasp of the deep ocean's abyss!

'Territorial pressure!'

Poseidon found himself suddenly and irrevocably trapped, his back arching painfully under the invisible burden, his godly visage marred by a grimace of distress.

Stripped of his divinities, Poseidon's resistance was reduced to sheer willpower against the pressure.

It was a formidable force, indeed, but starkly insufficient against the magnitude of Felix's imposed Dreamrealm pressure!

Then, amid his struggle, Felix appeared before him with a predatory gaze, a figure of vengeance wreathed in the sinister glow of crimson flames.

"Wait...Let's talk things through..."

Poseidon knew that he was in a massive disadvantageous position and tried to waste some time with his mouth.

Alas, before he could finish his sentence, a flaming fist landed directly on his lips, busting them open instantly!

Bam! Bam! Bam!!...

Then, a barrage of blows rained down on the beleaguered sea god...Each strike carried the fury of an inferno, a physical manifestation of Felix's wrath that seared not just the flesh but the very essence of Poseidon!

With no divinities to shield him and his own will crumbling under the relentless onslaught, Poseidon could do nothing but rely on his abilities for protection!

'MIRROR LAKE!'

Poseidon, with a defiant glare that belied his earlier disadvantage, summoned the ancient force of the seas.

His hands moved through the air with practiced grace, tracing patterns that invoked to the very essence of water.

In an instant, the ground beneath their feet shimmered and transformed into a vast, serene surface, mirroring the sky above with uncanny precision.

This was the Mirror Lake, an ability known to trap even the mightiest in a dimension of reflections!

As Felix advanced, intent on continuing his assault, he found his image reflected at him, not just once but infinitely, each reflection perfectly mimicking his movements!

The lake, a trap as much as it was a weapon, sought to ensnare Felix in a maze of his visage, turning his aggression against him.

However, the mirror wasn't used for its intended purpose, as it was capable of creating infinite reflections of Poseidon!

Poof!

Poseidon imploded into water particles and those reflections emerged as an army in his place against Felix!

"You asked for this!!"

With a unified shout; Poseidon's infinite reflections slammed their palms against the lake's surface!

The very air between them hummed with tension as Poseidon invoked control over the most elemental aspect of life‚Äîwater!

"CELLULAR IMPLOSION!"

With a deafening command, He targeted the water molecules within Felix's body!

The command was simple yet terrifying in its implications: to implode, to collapse inward with unimaginable force at the most fundamental level of existence!
