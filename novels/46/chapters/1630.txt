Chapter 1631 A Loophole?

1631 A Loophole?

"That's not all, I feel that each draconic tail is connected to one of my seven hearts,"

Felix remarked after sensing his seven hearts were all beating after summoning the draconic tails...Even the dormant ones were awakened.

"This is quite intriguing." Lady Sphinx rubbed her chin thoughtfully, "The fact that the dragonic tails were able to integrate themselves with your elemental manipulations and hearts means that you aren't like any normal unigin."

"In what sense?"

Felix and the others were curious...Felix's entire ascension to the unigin realm wasn't normal, so nothing was new about him not sharing the same traits as unigins.

"Let me test my theory first." Lady Sphinx requested, "Try to change your form into something else, a beast, an animal, or whatnot without using illusion abilities or such."

Without questions asked, Felix closed his eyes and tried to change his form into a raccoon as it was the first thing that popped into his mind.

However, no matter how hard he tried, his body refused to morph.

"I can't." Felix raised an eyebrow in surprise.

He understood that if he was a real unigin like the others, it wouldn't have been an issue for him to change his form into anything he desired.

That's because unigins weren't born with an exact physical form in the first place and they could take the shape of almost anything.

"Is this a good or a bad thing?" Thor frowned.

"Being different is good." Lady Sphinx smiled, "We know that other unigins can't utilize laws besides the ones born with. In Felix's case, he wasn't born with the laws but assimilated with the paragon's core as a human."

"This forced the universe to improvise instead of following its strict rules of a unigin's birth, which meant some of the unigins' rules don't apply to him."

"Where are you going with this?" Lord Loki asked.

"I am coming to it." Lady Sphinx continued with a serious tone, "Due to Felix's unique body structure, his evolution ended with seven separated entities connected each with their own heart, and possessed full control over a sin law and an element."

"If we removed those elements and freed the hearts, we might have a chance to gain more than just unigins' powers if we followed our suggested plan from before."

By now, everyone understood what she was implying and it sent shivers down everyone's spines in excitement and shock.

"If what you are saying is right, then by having seven draconic tails, seven hearts, Asna's core, and an evolutionary body created to accept assimilating with unigins' cores, the universe wouldn't stop me from assimilating with other unigins' cores as long as I connect each one to a draconic tail and their heart?!!"

"Yes." T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

Felix's breath got a bit heavier at her confirmation of such an insane statement.

This was even more extraordinary and mindblowing than their previous idea of devouring unigins' cores with Asna's core and obtaining their powers!

What they were discussing was whether Felix had the possibility of assimilating with an additional seven unigins' cores and in turn, possess not just their powers, but their strength, and absolute control over their laws!!!

It would be the same as Felix turning into Unigin Overlord!!

"Slow your horses." Lady Sphinx disclosed calmly, "Let's not get too excited over a mere theoretical perspective. All I am saying is that there is a chance that the universe might have left a loophole for you to abuse due to your unique nature. It doesn't mean that it has happened and for all we know, it might be impossible for you just like any other unigin."

Knowing that the universe rarely made mistakes or left 'loopholes', Felix couldn't help but agree with her take...He shouldn't count his count his eggs before they hatch.

Still, the idea of it being a possibility was already enough to cause all unigins in the eternal kingdom to dread their future!

"This at least makes it a bit easier to accept losing my elemental manipulation and abilities." Felix smiled.

Every time this subject got brought up, he always felt like his heart was being ripped from its place.

Who could blame him? He would be giving up on everything he had grinned his ass for, which wasn't easy to accept for anyone.

"Nothing was a waste." Thor shook his head, "If it wasn't for your difficult work and nonstop grinding, you wouldn't have gotten the chance of reaching this stage in your life."

"He is right, you are now a Unigin." J?rmungandr said, "Raise your head high as you are the sole controller of eight laws and no one can take them away from you...Not even the rulers."

"You have been borrowing their powers for a while now and it's time to start using your own." Lady Yggdrasil smiled wryly, "You at least have managed to escape and obtain your own source of strength."

When she said this, most of the primogenitors' mood was brought down.

The fact that primogenitors were born for the sake of entertainment of the eternal kingdom unigins was already upsetting enough.

Yet, to know that their entire being could be controlled akin to puppets the moment they stepped inside the eternal kingdom was a much harder hit to their self-esteem.

What's worse? Even if they bestowed their elemental manipulation, it wouldn't matter much since their gifts were all connected to the three rulers.

One could say that Felix was the sole mortal with the possibility to escape the three rulers' chains and still own enough strength to keep his head up high!

"Yet, I am the bad person for making them run errands..." Lilith broke the silence with a wronged murmur, causing everyone's expressions to turn for the worst.

Knowing that if they reacted, they would fall into her trap, everyone took control of their emotions and continued ignoring her existence.

Meanwhile, Felix stopped considering this situation negatively when he realized just how blessed he was compared to the primogenitors and the rest of the mortals.

So, he stopped running from the inevitable at last.

"From today onward, the three rulers will have nothing on me."

Without an ounce of hesitation, Felix switched his focus to his wisp inside the consciousness space.

The air was filled with a sense of solemnity, as Felix understood the significance of this moment - it was not just an act of returning powers, but a heartfelt acknowledgment of the roles each had played in his journey.

Felix stood in front of J?rmungandr and bowed his head, a sign of deep respect and gratitude.

"Thank you for lending me your strength. I would have never made it this far without your poison manipulation," he remarked sincerely, his words echoing softly in the ethereal space.

Felix wasn't being cynical in the slightest.

While poison manipulation became more and more irrelevant with the introduction of much more powerful abilities in his arsenal, he would never forget the first years of his journey.

Poison was his go-to element with its unique and all-rounded inducements. It seldom failed him when he needed it the most.

"I honestly have no use for it, but, I will safely keep it until you decide what you want to do with it," J?rmungandr remarked with a faint smile, allowing Felix to bestow the poison elemental manipulation back.

Felix gave him a slight head nod in understanding and placed a finger on J?rmungandr's forehead.

As he willed the inscriptions to return to their original owner, Felix couldn't help but show a nostalgic smile.

"We sure came a full circle." J?rmungandr chuckled as he also remembered the day he bestowed Felix his elemental manipulation.

Besides the new army of tenants, the magnificent town, and the absence of Asna, there wasn't much of a difference.

The inscriptions transformed into live snakes and coursed from Felix's finger into J?rmungandr's body.

In a few moments, the ritual was done and Felix had gotten rid of poison manipulation successfully, leaving him with a faint prickle of pain in his heart.

Still, this didn't affect his conviction.

One by one, he repeated this ritual with each of his masters and tenants...With each return, his bow was filled with genuine appreciation, and his thanks were heartfelt.

The masters and tenants, in turn, received their powers with nods of understanding and pride.

They saw in Felix not just a student or a comrade, but a being who had grown beyond their teachings, yet still held the wisdom to honor the origins of his power.

As the last of the elemental manipulations was returned, a sense of completion filled the space.

"Now, to the difficult part..." Felix knitted his eyebrows, "The removal of abilities, immunites, and anything with a slight relation to the three rulers."
