1329 Who To Save First?

While the others were stunned by the sight of their people returning to their original forms, he was the only one who had seen the ugly scene of when Olivia failed to make it happen.

He wasn't lying when he said that he couldn't remember how many times Olivia had tried and failed as it was in the thousands if not more!

In all of those failed attempts, the demons end up getting killed permanently because Olivia hadn't reached the perfect equilibrium between sucking off evil energy and replacing it with pure energy inside the soul!

This was the secret to reversing the demonization process and Olivia tried her very best to find this precise balance for more than sixty years, and now that she had finally pulled it off, neither Noah nor she could believe it!

"FATHER!! FATHER!!"

"That's my daug..ther...Sob, my daughter!"

"Captain!"

The moment the soldiers woke up from their daze, their raging emotions at the sight of their serene loved ones made them ignore the orders and rush toward the wide-open cocoons.

Neither Olivia nor Noah stopped them as the threat of the demons in the area was put to rest.

The soldiers, their eyes no longer radiating an infernal crimson but instead shimmering with tears of relief and gratitude, looked upon their families, their comrades, and their lovers.

Men and women who were lost to monstrous transformation had been returned to their human forms, their souls reclaimed from the very precipice of oblivion.

Emotions swelled and voices choked as reunions unfolded, every warm embrace and tear-streaked face a testament to the miraculous feat achieved.

Each reunion was punctuated by a cacophony of relief-laden laughter, gasps of disbelief, and heartfelt sobs.

The air was heavy with the profound weight of redemption and homecoming.

At that moment, under the benevolent shadow of the World Tree, not a single eye was dry, not a

a single heart was untouched by the magic of seeing their loved ones restored.

The goddess that made this happen wasn't forgotten as everyone lifted their heads and bowed deeply with an intense sense of appreciation and gratitude that Olivia felt even from kilometers away.

While others would get a kick out of being worshipped as a savior and a hero, Olivia didn't even think about this for a moment.

'I can truly save lives now.

This was the only thing that she cared about and now that she finally managed to find the perfect balance after thousands of failures, she could finally stop killing demons and helping them return to their original lives.

Noah appeared next to Olivia and apologized, "I am sorry for doubting you."

"Don't be, I was doubting myself just as much." Olivia sighed in relief and showed a smile as brilliant as sunshine, "What matters is that it worked."

"This changes everything and we have to let Felix on it." Noah switched to his serious tone.

"Let's report this while we reverse the demonization of everyone on this planet." Olivia said.

"I had the same thought."

While Noah and Olivia had gotten rid of Prince Beelzebub and most of his army on this battlefield, it didn't mean that the entire planet was cleaned from demons.

So, without wasting a moment of their time, Olivia canceled out her world tree and departed with Noah, leaving Malak to handle the muddled undemonized army as it seemed like all of them were having difficulty with their long-term memory.

"This is huge! The fact that we can reverse the demonization process means that we won't need to give up on our people." Felix expressed with a delighted tone as he watched a live stream of Olivia and Noah using the same method with another group of demons.

"It's good, but it's not a perfect solution." Asna shook her head, "It consumes too much energy and Olivia can't be everywhere."

As she said, Olivia was already huffing and puffing after the second attempt. It was understandable as she didn't have a conversion technique like Felix, which meant she had to take breaks to refill her energy through elemental stones.

"It's not efficient, I agree with that." Felix said, "But, it's all that we have at the moment."

"I think it's best to give Olivia a powerful team made out of the best of the best and assist her with gathering as many demons as possible before starting the process." Candace suggested.

"That will indeed make sure that we reverse the demonization of as many demons as possible while leaving Olivia to maintain her energy for the process solely." Felix nodded in support.

He knew that using the ultimate ability was the biggest consumption of energy instead of reversing the demonization.

This meant that it was possible for Olivia to handle billions of demons stacked up in one simultaneously as long as she had protection and those demons weren't causing trouble.

"If we told the universe about this, I believe most of the lesser demons would come voluntarily to reverse the demonization process as they still maintained their rationality."

While demons acted upon their evil thoughts after their demonization, they still were rational enough to understand that their demonization came with more negatives than positives.

The threat of losing their rationality if not fed with enough purities would push them to seek out reversing the demonization process if it was truly proven to work.

"True, but we can't risk having the news getting public so soon." Felix narrowed his eyes coldly, "The demon princes and even Lucifer might make his move personally on her... It's too risky."

"I can be her bodyguard." Fenrir proposed expressionlessly.

"Huh, you will do that?" Felix and the others were surprised.

As a primogenitor, they felt that it was beneath him to act as a bodyguard to a mortal, no matter how important she was.

"Protecting her is a mere bonus." Fenrir disclosed calmly, "If she made enough noise through her reverse demonization, Lucifer might make a move on her and I will be waiting for him."

"So, you are planning to wait for him to come on his own." Felix smiled, "It's really a good method."

With Fenrir being around Olivia, whether Lucifer made his move on Olivia or not, it wouldn't matter as they would be the ones winning this struggle.

Without further ado, Felix shared the news with Olivia and Noah.

Next, he commenced an emergency inner circle meeting to report the news as he knew that the SGAlliance needed a win badly.

After spending ten minutes updating them on the situation, most of the leaders' faces seemed to have brightened up.

"The situation in my galaxy is too dire, I request to have it prioritized." Emperor Lokhil stated with a solemn tone.

"The situation is dire in all places." Queen Allura retorted, "But if there is a race that needs

prioritization, it's definitely the humans."F·ªãùíèdd ùíèew updùíÇtùíÜs on n(o)v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

As much as Emperor Lokhil wanted to fight this, he knew that the evidence wasn't on his side. The humans were really taking the worst beating as the demons prioritized everyone else.

Everyone knew the reason as Lucifer had long since brought the matter to the public about Felix's meeting.

He told everyone that he would pause the demonic invasion if Felix decided to meet with him personally for a negotiation.

Everyone thought that Felix would have accepted it in a heartbeat due to his grand supreme title, but to everyone's surprise, he never bothered to reply to him.

This resulted in Felix's reputation taking even a bigger hit...
