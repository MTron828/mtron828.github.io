1687 Twenty Millions Years Ago. II

A decade later...

Little Asna grew from the mysterious child birthed by the universe's heart into a spirited and rowdy ten-year-old.

With crimson hair that danced like flames in the cosmic wind and golden eyes shimmering with mischief, she became a whirlwind of energy and laughter, a stark contrast to the solemnity of the celestial beings that inhabited this realm.

"Asna, who is gonna be our next target?" Apollo asked with a mischievous grin.

Little Asna was sitting above his shoulders with a wide playful smirk. She tapped her little finger on her chin and murmured thoughtfully, "It's always fun to mess with Uncle Hepheastutus and watch him lose his mind and chase us down. But, I think we have pranked him enough."

"True, true, so who's our next victim?"

"It's been a while since we paid Uncle Poseidon a visit." Little Asna giggled, "It's only fair we show him some love too."

"As expected of my trusty partner." Apollo gave her a high five while chuckling, "You read my mind."

In the blink of an eye, LittleAsna and Apollo arrived at the gates of Poseidon's territory and remained hidden with Apollo's spiritual pressure.

'You do it or I do it?' Apollo asked telepathically.

'I can try, but I don't think I will be as good as you.' LittleAsna replied, her voice as childish as it could be, yet she was discussing ruining a unigin's day like it was a normal habit.

'Go for it, I will assist you.'

With a shared nod, LittleAsna extended her hands, her fingertips glowing with a potent mix of elemental energy, while Apollo struck a chord so powerful it resonated through the very fabric of the cosmos. Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

In an instant, light vanished from Poseidon's territory!

The luminous underwater cities, the shimmering coral forests, and the radiant paths that meandered through his domain were plunged into unexpected darkness.

Creatures of the deep, accustomed to the perpetual glow of celestial underwater, paused in confusion, their bioluminescent hues flickering uncertainly in the sudden night.

'Hmmm? A blackout? The hell?'

Poseidon, who had been admiring a newly formed coral constellation, found himself enveloped in darkness.

His trident glowed dimly as he summoned his powers to restore the light, only to realize the source of this playful sabotage.

With a thunderous roar that stirred the waves, he bellowed, "Asna! Apollo!"

Poseidon surged through his waters with the force of a thousand currents, his form a brilliant streak of light as he sought out the culprits.

"Runn!!"

"Hehehehe! He is mad, mad!"

LittleAsna and Apollo, laughing heartily, darted and weaved through the cosmic seas, their laughter echoing like bells across the void.

They were a blur of motion, a comet chased by a tempest, as they maneuvered through Poseidon's realm with gleeful agility.

Despite his annoyance, Poseidon couldn't help but be caught up in the thrill of the chase, his scowl gradually giving way to a grudging amusement.

"You cannot outrun the lord of the oceans!" he thundered, yet his voice bore a hint of laughter, a testament to the infectious joy that LittleAsna brought into their lives.

With Asna's birth, the entire atmosphere in the kingdom had changed as the unigins stopped attempting to conquer each other's territories and this allowed them to move freely across the kingdom without a worry.

It was like they were her parents, and it made them feel weird to have her see them fighting each other over celestial energy.

Thus, in the past decade, everyone treated Asna as a little princess even when she kept pranking them and annoying them constantly.

Even the easily and stern unigins like Hephaestus and Demeter never took offense to Asna's actions and indulged her daily.

It was an understandable reaction since the unigins were all born at the beginning of time and grew together. None of them had seen an actual child-size unigin on the same status as them, which made them consider her as their actual child.

Her presence could be stated to have breathed a sense of peace and love in their hearts that only children could do.

"Annoying brats."

After a short chase, Poseidon could only return to his territory with a vexed expression...He knew that catching LittleAsna was near impossible with Apollo as her wingman.

"We had him for good!" Little Asna laughed while clapping her hands cutely.

"It was all you, little one." Apollo praised, "You are getting better and better at manipulating the laws."

"Well, of course!" Asna boasted, "I have the best teachers!"

"Who's number one?" Apollo coughed while pointing his finger at himself.

Just as Asna was about to tease him, the first ruler's stern voice resounded in her mind.

'Asnaleigha,' He called, his tone imbued with the weight of eons, 'Come.'

Asna became visibly upset at being summoned, acting like a child who got summoned by her parents to come home while playing outside with her friends.

"What's wrong?" Apollo asked.

"I have to go." Asna pouted, "The elders have called me."

"I see, let me take you there then." Apollo patted her on the head with a soft smile, "We will continue our games later on."

"Ahhh, they will just make me try to open the universe's heart again." Asna complained, "How am I supposed to do that?"

"Just try your best." Apollo stated with a wry smile, "It will make your elders happy."

"Fiiineee, I guess."

"Good girl."

Apollo knew deep down that Asna's ending wouldn't be great if no positive results were provided with her assistance.

Knowing the three rulers' insane obsession with freedom and celestial energy made him understand that they would not stop until they tried everything with Asna.

'Let's hope it won't be that deep.' He sighed inwardly.

...

In almost no time, Apollo dropped off LittleAsna in front of the dimensional pocket's gate and took off.

The gate opened up for Asna and she went inside swiftly, wanting to get this over with fast so she could return to her games.

After arriving at the platforms, she noticed that Eris and Uranus were also there...Her eyes lit up in happiness as she rushed to Eris.

"Auntyy!!"

She summoned cutely while jumping into her embrace, making Eris show a faint gentle smile.

"Are you still misbehaving and causing trouble for your uncles and aunts?" Eris asked.

"Of course!" Asna nodded excitedly.

"Good job." Eris chuckled with admiration, as she had always been a lover of chaos.

"Stop wasting our time and listen to your elders," Uranus stated with a stern tone.

Asna mocked him with her tongue out and swiftly flew towards the three rulers, knowing that Uranus had no issue with disciplining her, unlike the rest who indulged her rotten.

Uranus' eyelids twitched in irritation, but he didn't comment on the matter.

"You know what do." The first ruler stated composedly as he gazed at LittleAsna.

"Alright..." LittleAsna murmured while walking to the universe's heart, "It's going to be the same..."

The three rulers ignored her negative comment and watched with a hint of hope in their eyes as she extended with her hands at themesmerizing orb of light that throbbed with the lifeblood of creation itself.

She reached out, not with just her hands, but with her mind too, her thoughts tender and inquiring, like whispers in the vast silence of space. 'Please open up, please, please, so I can continue playing interrupted...'

She projected, her intent clear and devoid of any desire to dominate. She didn't care about the other side, what was on it, the unigins and the rulers' freedom, or such complicated matters.

All she wanted was the universe's heart to respond to her wishes, so she wouldn't be bothered with this again.

Alas, the universe's heart didn't fulfill her wishes...Instead, it started releasing massive pulses of celestial energy through Asna's palms, seemingly desiring to feed her.

When the rulers saw this, they glanced at each other for a moment and then shook their heads in disappointment...

'Failure again...'
