ÔªøÔªø1729 You May Return Home.

"Hmmm, who is he?"

Apollo's casual walk across the battlefield had attracted Commander Bia and her subordinates.

It wasn't just his calm that drew their eyes, but also the way he was avoiding the chaos with minimum effort, making him seem like he was an orchestra conductor and the battlefield was his auditorium.

The moment Apollo arrived at the heart of the battlefield, he raised a single finger toward the sky, and a white, luminous sphere began to take shape above him.

The moon-like sphere glowed softly, but its presence was too dominating, it drew everyone's attention to it.

"What is this?" Plix frowned.

"Is this a new ability from a Gleamkin?" Chronos asked with a serious expression.

"Does anyone know him?"

"He is a nobody...Tsk."

The rest of the mercenaries momentarily halted their barrage of attacks as they gazed into the luminous giant sphere.

Apollo's reputation as a mercenary was slim to none since he spent most of his time profound in brothels and parties. This made the mercenaries have no faith in him.

Suddenly, Apollo snapped his fingers, and the sphere began to dim.

The light retreated until only a slender crescent of light remained, which hung in the sky like a celestial sign.

"Darkness...He is a duel attunement Gleamkin!"

This sight alone left everyone stunned. Even Commander Bia and Dankin raised an eyebrow in surprise.G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

Their reaction was understandable when Apollo's chosen race was known for having males controlling light and females controlling darkness!

However, once in a million, a prodigy was born with a duel attunement that allowed him to control both elements!

This news excited the mercenaries as it made them understand that Apollo was not a weakling and might help them tip the scale in their favor!

"He might have a chance to touch Dankin!"

"Follow his lead..."

Alas, before they could plan to jump on his bandwagon and get carried, Apollo snapped his finger...In a brilliant flash of light, the crescent marked everyone who gazed at it with an otherworldly glow on their foreheads.

Then, there was no then...Silence fell upon the noisy battlefield at last as no one spoke or moved.

They were transformed into standing zombies, completely subdued by the mysterious power of the crescent light.

Even Commander Bia and her squad found themselves caught in this unexpected trance, their wills sapped, leaving them at the mercy of the silent figure who had turned the tide of battle without wielding a single weapon.

"You, you, you..., Maybe you too. Stay behind, the rest..." Apollo clapped his hands twice with a nonchalant attitude, "You may return home."

The moment the command was given, the chosen mercenaries remained in their positions while the unfortunate ones turned around and headed collectively towards the training ground's main gate, resembling walking undead.

In a short moment, ten mercenaries were left behind, including Felix.

"I guess this should do it?"

Apollo waved his hand casually and the giant crescent moon disappeared into particles. Then, he walked back to Felix.

After the crescent disappeared, the glowing mark on everyone's forehead was erased.

Then, as if a switch had been flipped, the crescent ability that had held everyone in a trance was abruptly canceled.

The once mind-controlled mercenaries, Felix, Commander Bia, and Dankin suddenly snapped back to reality, their expressions a mix of confusion, relief, and lingering fear...

"What in the world just happened?" Felix rubbed his forehead, the crescent mark fading but the memory of the trance still vivid.

He always knew that behind the mask of perviness and cowardness, Apollo was a fearsome unigin due to his two extraordinary laws.

But still, to have an ability powerful enough to hypnotize even him, the paragon of sins? It was uncanny!

Commander Bia, quick to regain her composure, scanned her surroundings, her squad slowly coming to their senses.

"Explain yourself." Her voice was firm, but the slight tremor bared her concern.

She had never expected to fall for a mercenary ability and this made her heart skip a beat.

"I am sorry about that, you had to suffer by proxy." Apollo shrugged his shoulders, "If it makes you feel better, I have saved you the time and chosen the best ten mercenaries for your mission."

When the remaining mercenaries heard this, they didn't know if they should feel scared or excited to have them picked in this manner.

"Who is this monster..." Plix murmured with a tingle of dread in his voice as he gazed at the nonchalant Apollo.

While he was glad that his entire squad was chosen to stay behind, the idea of being mind-controlled without him realizing it didn't sit well with him.

No one felt like this more than Dankin, who also became a victim of the hypnotize without the ability to break past it.

He was absolutely livid at such a humiliation.

Who could blame him? He went from an invincible monster who couldn't be touched by hundreds of mercenaries, to a controlled puppet under Apollo's will.

What's worse, it happened before his Commander and squadmates. His pride as the second in command royal guard would never let it slide.

"How dare you mess with our Commander's trials!"

Dankin uttered with a suppressed cold voice while his entire body kept releasing powerful vibrational waves.

Rumble Rumble!!

The ground trembled and cracked while the atmosphere seemed to bend against its will with each step he took toward Apollo.

"Ayo, relax little buddy, I just wanted to save you guys some time since your Commander is such a fan of straightforwardness." Apollo hid behind Felix while defending his approach, "Ask her, those ten mercenaries are the ones on her radar."

Just as Dankin was about to respond, Commander Bia ordered with a stern tone, "Dankin, that's enough."

"..."

Dankin's steps halted immediately, seemingly unable to go against his Commander's orders regardless of his emotions. With an icy glare, he walked back to his post.

"You, what's your name?" Commander Bia inquired.

Apollo walked into the limelight and subtly flirted, "In a world of shadows, Madam Bia, you're the kind of light I've been searching for. I'm Bollo, at your service and, hopefully, at your side."

'Ahh, we are so f*cking cooked.'

Felix felt his life flash before his eyes every time this idiot used his bogus name.

Now, that he uttered it while demonstrating his ability to control both light and darkness, even a moron would connect the dots if they were looking for him. Yet, the f*cker was still in the mood to flirt with the Commander.

Fortunately, it seemed as if Commander Bia had no clue about his identity.

"I have never heard of you...What territory were you most active in?" Commander Bia asked with narrowed eyes, unirked by his shameless flirting attempt.

"I am a nomad mercenary, I do not operate in any specific territory. I just follow wherever life takes me." Apollo winked, "It has brought me here. Dare I say, fate?"

'Can you f*cking stop flirting with her? Don't you identify her to be the primogenitor of vibration? She might recognize us if you keep spewing bullsh*t!' Felix swore in anger.

He thought that Apollo would have known a bit about primogenitor Bia's situation but from his interaction, he was certain that he had no clue about her real identity!

As he expected, Apollo was left surprised.
