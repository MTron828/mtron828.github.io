1380 Why?

Beneath the soft glow of the multicolored nebulae, sat Felix and Asna. Their table was adorned with exotic fruits and dishes that could not be found in any market. A tranquil aura filled the air, the silence between them brimming with anticipation and mutual understanding.

Felix lifted his glass, swirling the sparkling celestial nectar within.

"You know," he began, his voice breaking the silence, "I never imagined we would have made it so far when we first met."

Asna chuckled. "Likewise."

"I guess this is a pretty good point to relax a bit and take a break?"

"Well, Lucifer is dead, Manananggal is dead, and the other darkins have gone to hiding." Asna nodded, "Even the SGAllinace's matters are being taken care of by your clones. You have reached the top of the universe and conquered what can not be conquered.

There is no way forward now besides heading after those beings, so, you're right, this is the perfect moment to take a well-deserved break."

Asna spoke from the heart and Felix could feel her sincerity.

He raised the glass towards Asna, his eyes sparkling with sincerity. "To us, and to the stories we have yet to write."

Asna, in response, gave him a gentle smile, raising her own glass, "To us indeed," she said, "and to the mysteries, we're yet to unravel."

Their glasses clinked softly, the sound echoing around them, carried by the cosmic winds.

Felix took a sip, savoring the exotic taste, then put down his glass. He turned towards Asna, his gaze steady.

"Asna," he began, hesitating for a moment before he continued, "Do you ever think about...our future?"

Asna took a deep breath and looked at him, her expression softening.

"I do, Felix," she admitted. "I think about it a lot. But, nothing is certain. So, for now, let's just enjoy this moment, you and I."

Felix nodded, appreciating the honesty in her response. He knew that Asna was in no control over her life as the moment she break free from his soul, she would carry over celestial duties, which meant being put with iron shackles like the ones on Paragon of Sins.

When that happened, what kind of relationship she would possess with Felix? Only time could tell.

Felix reached out, taking her hand into his. "Asna, in whatever future awaits us, I want you to remember one thing. That my feelings for you are the only certainty in this uncertain existence of mine."

Asna looked at their entwined hands, then back at Felix. She smiled, her eyes glistening under the starlight. "I'll remember that...I promise."

And so, beneath the celestial canvas of the illusionary universe, they dined, their hearts beating in unison, their minds filled with thoughts of each other, their souls intertwining in the silence of the night.

Alas...This heavenly meeting was destined to end in this very place, at this very second...

Suddenly, a hum reverberated in the atmosphere, barely noticeable at first, but rapidly growing into a deafening roar.

The stars in the sky seemed to lose their luster as the air around them pulsated with ominous energy.

A spear of pure light descended from the heavens, tearing through the dimensions, divine retribution aimed at none other than Felix.

Felix's mind was inside the UVR, so his body merely convoluted instinctively to the upcoming damage for a millisecond.

Before Felix could react to his instincts, the smite hit him...

There was no scream, no time for evasions or resistance, the divine light pierced through his body in an instant...

An audible gasp echoed through as the light dissipated, revealing Felix. His body was frozen in place, a look of shock etched on his face before it slumped, lifeless to the ground.

Smoke arose from his body as it seemed to have not been affected in the slightest by the golden spear, but Felix's soul was no longer in his body...

The smile that had once adorned his face now seemed tragically out of place.

The tenants were silent, every eye wide and filled with disbelief. The lively and bustling consciousness space collapsed on their heads akin to an inflated balloon getting popped.√öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

Yet, not a single primogenitor or tenant managed to utter a single word...All of their bodies began to disintegrate in front of their own eyes, returning to the ocean that seemed to be falling into an abyss.

'Looks like he has finally gotten their attention...What a shame.' Lord Shiva sighed carelessly, still chilling on his beach chair while his wisp was breaking into pieces.

Meanwhile, Thor, Lady Sphinx, Jormungandr, Fenrir, Carbuncle, Elder Kraken, Lord Khaos, and even Lord Loki seemed to be incapable of comprehending what had just happened...

just a moment ago, some of them were spying on Felix's date to entertain themselves while the rest were either playing cards,chess, or smoking pong together.

All it took was a millisecond before this entire world collapsed on itself, not giving them a single moment to attempt to fix it.

In less than a second, Thor, Fenrir, and Jormungandr could only trade one last glance with each other before they got erased.

Carbuncle took one last puff as his body returned to the ether.

Lord Khaos, Elder Kraken, and Lady Sphinx looked around them with penetrative analyzing eyes.

Lastly, Lord Loki was just curious about the whole thing.

Then, there was darkness in the consciousness space as the lights were finally turned off and nothing but a vacant void remained behind.

A scene occurs during only one situation...The passing of the soul's owner.

Felix lay lifeless on the ground. His end had come not in battle, not in a duel of power, but by a smite from the heavens, a death so instant that it left him and everyone else stunned, their minds unable to comprehend the loss.

The sound of a body hitting the ground reverberated, breaking the silence.

But it was the silence that followed, the silence of loss, of grief, of disbelief, that was the loudest of all.

The heavens had claimed their own, and in doing so, had left a void in the hearts of those who had known Felix, a void that could never be filled...

At the time of the spear, smiting Felix from the heavens, time froze as he was thrust into the void of the unimaginable.

The world around him blurred as his body went numb, a profound chill spreading from the point of contact, enveloping him completely.

His widened stunned eyes stared at his beloved who was experiencing the same fate as him. Asna was just as dazed as him, watching her lover's body and her own disintegrating into light particles...

In the real world, Felix's body crumpled, hitting the ground with a thud that echoed ominously in the silence that followed.

The residual light from the spear of the heavens faded, revealing Felix's lifeless form sprawled across the ground.

The vibrant power source that always enveloped him was extinguished...

In the silence, his face held a tragic calm, eyes wide in an eternal question.

The word echoed in the minds of the tenants, a poignant reminder of the abrupt end.

Felix's existence, once so vibrant and full of life, was now eerily silent and still.

A hero had fallen, and all that remained was the echo of his last thought, a question to the heavens that had smitten him, a word that now lingered as a ghostly reminder of the abrupt end - 'Why?'
