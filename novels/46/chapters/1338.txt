"This is all I wanted." Felix smiled in satisfaction as he stared at his illuminating fist.

In a few moments, the absorbed force faded away and his fist returned to normal, but he didn't beam another machine to finalize the calculation.ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

The destroyed machine was the best one available to handle such intense force and if he wanted to be precise, he had to use the ones in the UVR.

"You just need to hit two dragon marks and one devourer's mark to cross the one million limit." Candace congratulated with a delighted expression, "You will be the second mortal to become a deity!"

If it wasn't for Lucifer, Felix would have been considered the true first mortal to break past the universal limitation and join the other side.

This would have definitely warranted another reaction from the universe.

"I don't care about such a thing; I just want to become a deity already and show those f*ckers that I am not a pushover." Felix expressed with an icy tone as he envisioned the darkins and Lucifer.

Without further ado, Felix continued testing other enhancements and he wasn't disappointed with the end results.

When he was done, Felix decided to prioritize hitting the required dragon/devourer marks for the ascension over continuing his integration.

This implied eating as much as possible before going into a long slumber to hasten the digestion of the elemental minerals and natural treasures.

"Two dragon marks and one devourer's mark will take me at least five years even with my powerful digestion." Felix shook his head, "It's still better than decades if I went for it slowly."

Felix could have eaten all the collected elemental minerals and natural treasures slowly while he trained, but that would have screwed him up big time.

After all, the marks enhancements were flat, and he would be wasting them if he took them before the bloodline replacement.

While it seemed like he needed only

40K BF to cross the million line, in reality, it amounted to hundreds of thousands of BF in terms of difficulty.

Elder Dragon using potions and whatnot to obtain 10K BF temporarily was enough proof of said difficulty.

"Are you planning to leave the moment you ascend to a deity?"

Asna asked.

"Yes."Felix nodded with a firm tone,

"Not a single second wasted."

Six Years Later...While Felix was still in a deep slumber.

"He is getting closer; I reckon he needs only two hundred BF equivalent of strength before he crosses over the limit." Candace shared with an excited tone.

"I think he is going to sleep through the ascens-"...

RUMMBLE!!!!

Before Asna could finish her statement, a sudden deafening thunderclap resounded in her mind, jolting her awake!

"Did you hear that?" Asna swiftly asked with a shocked look.

"Yes."

"Likewise."

All of the tenants had their eyebrows raised in surprise.

"But how is that possible?" Thor soon frowned, "The universe celebrates only once, and Lucifer was the first mortal to become a deity."

This was the reason Felix never heard another thunderclap even when he kept adding new elemental manipulations in his arsenal or when he succeeded in his seventh replacement.

It might seem like he was the first to pull off a seventh replacement, but in reality, it was considered still a sixth replacement due to him getting rid of Thor's bloodline to empty space.

"Maybe, we have been misunderstanding the situation all along?" J√É¬∂rmungandr said, "We assumed that Lucifer was a mortal and became a deity, what if that wasn't the truth?"

"You mean, he was born as a deity all along?"

Everyone was a bit stunned by his assumption as it was even more impossible than becoming a deity from a mortal.

After all, to be born as a deity was no different than being considered a true primogenitor!

"It can't be the universe will never give birth to a new primogenitor unless the scale wasn't balanced. We all knew that those beings created us for their entertainment and the universe had nothing to do with that." Thor shook his head in denial.

If a primogenitor had lost his elemental manipulation forever, the universe clearly demonstrated that it would take it upon itself to restore the balance by giving birth to new primogenitors as eggs.

But, to give birth to a whole different primogenitor? The universe would never do that.

"Well, think about it. Fenrir narrowed his eyes coldly, "That demon was too unique from the start and Lady Sphinx had found out that his DNA is completely different than other demons. He might actually be the primogenitor of Evil, the ruler of evil energy?"

"Evil energy is different though, it didn't exist in the first place, and without the Paragon of Sins' existence, there would have been no such thing."

In other words, evil energy was the same as pure energy, they exist only if they were extracted from a source.

For example, everyone possessed evil energy and pure energy within them, but they did absolutely nothing to them as they were considered mere abstract ideas.

But, the Paragon of Sins had changed the whole situation by making this abstract idea into an existing energy that could alter reality!

With evil energy being released everywhere and spreading akin to a wildfire, this caused pure energy to manifest on its own as an opposite force!

This was clearly the doing of the universe as everything had to have an equal force to keep the balance.

intact.

"Well, it has been existing for tens of millions of years if not more. I can't see why the universe wouldn't create a new primogenitor egg to give this kind of new energy a ruler."

Fenrir said.

"That's not possible." Asna interjected with a serious tone, "The universe will never create a primogenitor for something that already has a unigin ruler above it.

That's why, you don't see the seven sins' primogenitor or spirits primogenitor."

"Those beings could do it, but not the universe. I doubt those beings have anything to do with Lucifer. In simpler terms, the universe recognizes the unigins as the original rulers of said energies, forces, laws, elements, or such. The primogenitors' existence wasn't needed in the first place, which was the reason the beings were the ones giving birth to them and not the universe.It was absolutely redundant to have a Death/Life Unigin and create a life primogenitor and death primogenitor. As for the eggs situation? As mentioned, the universe was left with no choice but to give birth to a new primogenitor to keep the lost elemental manipulation existing."

"If those beings and the universe had nothing to do with this, this leaves us with one answer."

Everyone looked at each other before uttering with a solemn tone,

"The Paragon of Sins."

"We have always been under the assumption that she was still asleep, but what if, she woke up a long, long time ago and merely remained on the low?"

"The clues do suggest her involvement with Lucifer. Fenrir stated, "He was always in front of the void rift, the closest thing to her slumber area. Plus, he seems to be targeting Felix specifically for some reason."

He can't be after Nimo as his first impression of him seemed like he genuinely didn't know about his existence."

"True, if the Paragon of Sins was awake and after Nimo, she had plenty of chances to take care of him when he entered the void rift in her territory."

"But if she was awake and ignored Nimo's existence, it sounds too farfetched."Carbuncle joined the conversation,

"Who would ignore taking care of their executioner and replacement at his weakest?"

"All of this seems too complicated and the only way to find out the truth is by getting it from Lucifer." J√É¬∂rmungandr said as he eyed Felix who seemed to be covered in an ethereal glow, "We will be getting the answer quite soon."

Felix, who had no clue that he had already ascended to a deity, remained in his dreamland.

While it was a dreamland, it was filled with nothing but absolute massacre with demons' heads rolling all over the place.

Even during his sleep, Felix wanted nothing more than to end this demonic plague and save his people.
