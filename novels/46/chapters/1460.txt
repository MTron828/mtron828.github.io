Chapter 1461 Trailing To The Source.

?1461 Trailing To The Source.

'What are you trying to do?' Ravager inquired.

'There is more than meets the eye in this case, and it will be a shame if we let it go like this.' Felix answered.

'I also think the same.'

'Good, I am planning to use Arion as a bait, and we can kick off a new case if we managed to find the person behind his situation if there is any.'

'I don't have a problem with that.'

Ravager was more than pleased with this as it enabled him to continue on his little secret revenge plot as well.

...

The sprawling streets of the capital were bustling as always and amidst this labyrinth, Arion Delmar stood, seemingly aimless and bereft of purpose.

The passing spirits hardly paid him any attention, most of them engrossed in their own affairs.

At a nondescript junction, Felix and Ravager positioned themselves, blending seamlessly with the surroundings, waiting to see the course Arion would take.

Alas, days passed, and Arion's movements were aimless, sometimes meandering, sometimes sitting for hours on end, as if waiting for something to ignite a spark within him.

Since Felix and Ravager had day shift with their squad, Felix had to leave following Arion to Sekiro.

Unfortunately, days went by and no one had appeared to pick up Arion.

'Maybe he has caused this upon himself.' Ravager sighed in frustration at the lack of results.

'It can't be, you have read about his past. He valued his safety and comfort more than anything.' Felix shook his head.

After going through his past information, they collected some data, but nothing too deep since the device couldn't show private Intel to just anyone in the government.

Because they were working on this off the record, they couldn't even interrogate the people around him.

'Well, no one is taking the bait, and we can't commit to this case without any decent leads.' Ravager warned, 'Those two b*tches keep solving cases, and we can't accept anything until we conclude this.'

While Ravager wanted to get revenge on his sister, he knew that it would be ten times easier by becoming a captain...He didn't want to lose his chance chasing after a false lead.

Unlike Felix, he didn't have any knowledge about the fallen, so it was normal to be skeptical after days with no results.

'You can return and pick up another case, I will stay on this for another week.' Felix shared calmly.

Ravager thought about it for a moment and then shook his head. 'No, we are in this as partners, and it's best to tackle each case together.'

'As you wi...' Suddenly, Felix's expression turned serious. 'We have movement.'

The moment Ravager heard this, he turned around and saw a mysterious figure approaching Arion.

He was cloaked in deep green and bearing the emblem of a crescent moon, the stranger seemed to exchange a few words with Arion, causing both of their pupils to expand.

'He is talking.'

'I can see that.'

'But how, he didn't seem to be faking his condition.'

'...'

Seeing that Felix remained silent, Ravager stopped his series of questions and focused on Arion who began following the stranger.

In reality, Ravager's heart was beating rapidly in agitation as this situation reminded him of his little sister greatly.

His sister became like a robot who will do anything he asked from her and if he didn't order her, she would keep gazing somewhere in silence.

'He must be his master.'

This made him recognize the identity of the stranger.

'Let's give a chase.'

With stealth befitting their roles, Felix and Ravager tailed the duo as they navigated the serpentine alleyways, moving away from the central streets, past the merchant's quarter, and finally into the more desolate outskirts of the city.

Here, structures were sparser, and the grandeur of the central realm gave way to simpler, earth-toned homes.

The stranger led Arion to a humble abode, its walls rough-

hewn and roof thatched, reminiscent of ancient dwellings from long-forgotten eras. Once Arion and the stranger disappeared inside, Felix and Ravager kept a decent distance from the house.

They knew that as law enforcers, if they were caught snooping on them, getting kicked out of the government wouldn't be the only punishment received.

'Do your thing.' Ravager said.

Closing his eyes momentarily, Felix channeled the element of vibration, aligning his senses to the faintest of sounds.

From within the walls of the house, the vibrations began to form a discernible pattern, weaving the story of what was transpiring inside.

At first, the hum was soft, almost like a gentle whisper ‚Äì the creaking of floorboards, the rustling of cloth. But then, a new sound emerged, one that made Felix focus on it.

It was the voice of the stranger, low and menacing, dripping with venom. "You worthless creature! I gave you an easy order to buy me a pack of cigarettes, and you ended up lost in the other side of the city for over a week!"

Arion's feeble responses, either too soft or stifled by pain, were drowned by the stranger's wrath. With every accusation, there was a chilling sound ‚Äì the sharp slap of flesh against flesh, the thud of a body colliding with a wall.

Unreactive to the heartbreaking noise, Felix continued to eavesdropping.

"How can you be so dumb?! I was told that your worthless kind are the best and cheapest available servants in the market, but you almost got me in deep trouble with the law enforcers!"

The beating continued nonstop.

"Screw this, I am returning you and getting my refund!"

With one last thud, the assault was stopped so as the stranger's tirade. Felix disengaged his ears from the house and opened his eye again.

'What happened?' Ravager asked.

'He got beaten... badly.'

Ravager's expression hardened, eyes reflecting fury and determination as this situation made him imagine what his sister had gone through under Mr. Atticus.

Still, he took control over his emotions and asked, 'What's our next move.'

'We will follow the master, he uttered something about getting a refund.' Felix shared, 'He will take us to the real culprit, and we can take action from there.'

'Refund, is he treating him like a product.' Ravager got furious again.

'Seems like it.'

'This feels wrong on so many levels.'

'Let's go.'

Felix ended their discussion after spotting Arion and his master taking off into the dark alleys again. Checkk new ùíèovel chùíÇpters at novùíÜlbin(.)com

...

The musty alleyways of the black market were alive with the whispers of illicit deals, and the shimmering specters of otherworldly beings.

Among the stalls and shadowed recesses stood an infamous small shop, an business both mysterious and hated known for selling servants of all kinds.

Arion was dragged forward by his so-called 'master' inside the shop. His steps were staggered, weakened by the assault he had endured.

The bruises on his face and arms were painful reminders of his lost memories and the cruelty he had experienced.

Pushing Arion ahead, the master barked at the shop owner, "This one's defective! I demand a refund!"

The shop owner, an aging spirit with a sly glint in his eyes, leaned forward, examining Arion critically.

"You've mishandled him," he remarked, pointing to the evident bruises.

"Our servants are rare commodities. Their minds are fragile, They need guidance, not violence."

The master scoffed, "I didn't pay for a broken toy. Refund my Lumus now!"

The shop owner sighed, a long-suffering expression on his face. "Returns aren't accepted here, especially not for damaged goods. However, if you're struggling to use him, I can advise."

The master's eyes narrowed suspiciously, "Go on."

Leaning in, the shop owner whispered, "Fallen servants are unique. Their power comes from their lost memories, a void that can be harnessed. Teach him, train him, but do so with care and patience. The void in their souls can be filled, directed. If used right, he can be more potent than any ordinary servant."

The master hesitated, mulling over the shop owner's words. "And if I can't use him?"

The shop owner smirked, "Then, my dear customer, perhaps it's not the servant that's flawed, but the master."

"We will see who's flawed!"

Growling in frustration, the master yanked Arion by the arm, exiting the shop... Then, he took his leave, having no idea that he had guided two sets of predatory eyes on the shop.
