Chapter 1721 Revisting An Old Power!

ÔªøÔªø1721 Revisting An Old Power!

A couple of weeks later...

Felix and Apollo had settled nicely in the brothel, one could say, Apollo had settled a bit too much.

While Felix spent most of his time in his room training and learning, Apollo had gone through the entire brothel, leaving no creature untouched.

He neither cared about gender, shape, type, race, intellect. His literal mentality was, 'If there is a hole, there is a way.'

The only things he didn't screw were the building itself, Zephyr, and Felix.

Felix even started to feel that Apollo was the real embodiment of lust instead of him.

Although his behavior disgusted Felix to no end, he left him to do his own thing as long as he didn't bring his sickening lust to his room.

As for the identity paperwork, they were nearly completed...Zephyr had told them that they would take a couple more days.

Right now, Felix was in his room at the brothel, trying something out.

He made a dagger out of his blood and tried to add some spark to it using the electricity from his body.

It buzzed a little, but that was it...It wasn't strong at all, and Felix was pretty bummed about it.

He successfully ascended after merging the hydra-head of the pride sin with Zeus' core a week ago...The process was as painful as he expected, but he gritted his teeth through it.

He had chosen the sin of pride since it was more compatible with the regalness and dignity of lightning, but at the same time, its insane explosiveness.

Just like a prideful emperor, he was always dignified and above the rest, but the moment his pride was touched, he retaliated with the strength of the gods.

"This isn't going to work," he said to himself, feeling a bit down.

While he could manipulate the quantum electricity, which mimicked the general electricity in behavior, he had to create quantum energy first or at least find a way to control it.

After all, quantum electricity wasn't roaming everywhere.G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

It was just like the situation with elemental energy/neutral energy.

Quantum energy was the neutral energy in the quantum realm and the only way to convert it into elemental energy was by possessing the conversion elemental technique, being a unigin, or the universe handed it personally as an innate ability.

In this case, Felix could sense the existence of the invisible quantum energy all around him, but he had no clue how to communicate with it.

He had already asked Zephyr about this, hoping for some useful information. Alas, what he told him shattered his hopes.

"Vibronix is the first race to find out the exact frequency combination required to communicate with quantum energy and start controlling it." Thor recalled what Zephyr told them, "It will be near impossible to land on the exact frequency randomly."

"You won't be getting it from them either as it is one of their national secrets," J√∂rmungandr added.

"I know." Felix sighed.

He was told that not even the vibronix civilians were given the secret since it would allow them to reshape reality too and it would make it harder for the vibronix royal family to maintain order.

Thus, he could forget about getting it from them.

"There must be another way."

Felix walked around the room with his chin resting on his hand, trying his best to brainstorm a new method.

He understood that in the quantum realm, the vibrational strings could not turn into any type of matter like in the real universe.

That's because the first level of the quantum realm was considered as a singular dimension between the vibrational strings and the matter universe.

That's why it was called a realm on its own instead of a mere extension of the matter universe.

Thus, even Uranus wouldn't be able to control those vibrational strings to create matter straightaway since they were smaller than particles.

If he had no clue about the quantum energy's frequency, he would be the same as the rest of the vibronix civilizations, able to manipulate mere vibrational waves, but not alter reality.

But, that was farfetched...As the unigin of vibration, there was no way he wouldn't know the exact frequency.

Unlike the vibronix race, he was the actual embodiment of the vibrations.

Thus, Felix understood that he was the same as a sitting duck, waiting to get slaughtered, unless he found a way to tap into the quantum energy.

He lay on the bed and sprawled out, resembling a starfish. Then, he stared at the ceiling with a furrowed brow.

He was deep in thought, trying to wrap his head around the whole quantum energy conundrum.

"Nope, that won't work," he mumbled to himself, dismissing yet another idea that fell flat upon closer inspection.

"And that's just ridiculous," he added, tossing another suggestion into the pile of discarded thoughts.

He sighed, feeling the weight of frustration.

It was like trying to catch smoke with his bare hands, every time he thought he was close to a solution, it slipped through his fingers, leaving him grasping at air.

Bored and stuck, Felix started playing with his blood...He kept switching its state, from liquid, crystallized, to mist.

The moment he gazed at the misty blood roaming around his hand, it suddenly reminded him of one of his unique forgotten powers that he rarely bothered to use after ascending!

"You got something?" Candace asked with a curious look.

"Hang on a second," His eyes widened as the gears in his mind started turning faster. "What if... just what if, I could use my evil energy to corrupt the quantum energy and make it mine?!"

The idea was outlandish, maybe even a bit mad, but Felix couldn't shake off the excitement that bubbled up within him!

It was a long shot, but at this point, he was willing to try anything.

"Witch, have you tested this before?" Felix asked.

"I never had to." Lilith replied lazily near the pool, "When I came here, I had my sin laws."

"True."

Felix understood that controlling quantum energy would be the easiest thing ever if he had access to his sin laws...If it wasn't for the punishment, he wouldn't be struggling this much.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Felix sat up, pushing the jumbled mess of blankets aside.

"Okay, malevolent energy, please don't let me down..."

He murmured with a hopeful tone as he extended his hands in front.

Closing his eyes, Felix focused on the sinister, swirling mass of malevolent energy within him. Then, he let it out, causing crimson mist to escape from his pores and engulf the entire room.

Then, he pictured it reaching out, tendrils of corruption probing the fabric of reality, seeking out the elusive quantum energy.

"Come on, come on," he urged silently, feeling the strain of forcing two fundamentally different energies to interact.

At first, there was resistance, like trying to mix oil and water. But slowly, ever so slowly, he felt a change!

The quantum energy, usually so indifferent and untouchable, began to warp, to twist under the influence of his evil energy!

Since everything in the quantum realm was made out of quantum energy, his room was corrupted too!

Nothing escaped the corrupting nature of his malevolent energy from the furniture to the walls!

"It's working..." Candace covered her mouth in awe.

A small grin spread across Felix's face as he sensed the first signs of success.

The quantum energy was yielding, becoming something new, something uniquely his...It was the breakthrough he needed, a game-changer in his quest to master the quantum realm!

"Hahaha, this is it, this changes everything," Felix laughed in delight as he opened his eyes to the sight of the entire room being corrupted.

"Not bad, this is a start at least." Lady Sphinx smiled approvingly, "Now, you just need to learn how to shape the quantum energy into your desired target."

"We got rid of the hardest part."

With a crimson glint in his eyes, he snapped his finger, and the crimson energy returned to his body.

Unfortunately, the damage was already done and the room was nearly inhabitable as everything was on the verge of collapsing.

The corruption might give Felix control, but first, it turned everything back into its base form.

If Felix hadn't abrogated it, the entire brothel might have fallen into a massive mist of tainted quantum energy, leaving Zephyr without a business!

"Is there a way to blame this on Apollo?" Felix murmured as he glanced around the mess he made.
