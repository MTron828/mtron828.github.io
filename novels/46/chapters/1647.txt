1648 All Eyes on Him.

While Felix wanted them to feel threatened, the reactions of Apollo, Demeter, Artemis, Zeus, and the rest to his daring theft of celestial energy ranged from mockery to curiosity.

Some were directed at him and the majority were at the other two.

Apollo, ever the artist and lover of drama, chortled at the spectacle.

Leaning back on his darkness cloud, he quipped, "He sure knows how to put on a show. Stealing from Poseidon and Hephaestus together? I expected nothing less!"

Demeter shook her head. "Pitiful party tricks...He will soon run out of them and the amount of celestial energy stolen will be barely enough to last him a couple of minutes in a fight against us."

Artemis, usually more reserved and contemplative, expressed a mixture of amusement and admiration to one of her subordinates.

"He's like a cunning fox, isn't he? Always finding new ways to survive and thrive. I wonder what he plans to do with that stolen celestial energy?"

Artemis was also one of the unigins like Apollo who kept a close eye on Felix's mortal journey from an early age, making her understand just what kind of person he was.

In her eyes, there was no way he would be settling down with stealing bits of celestial energy forever.

Would he use the energy to invade Hephaestus, Poseidon, or even one of them? She wondered.

Meanwhile, Zeus observed the events with a deep, thoughtful frown, stroking his beard. "I smell a scheme...A well-crafted scheme...Lilith's successor will never settle down for such tricks."

Athena, the goddess of wisdom and strategy, watched intently, her eyes reflecting a keen analytical mind at work. "If I was in his place with his sets of abilities, I would steal just enough celestial energy to give me a shield against radiant divinity plus territorial pressure...Then, launch a serious invasion attempt at Hephaestus, who is currently the weakest link in our circle...Even if he doesn't defeat him, he will be able to prolong his stay in his domain enough to restore what he has lost and even gain ten times the amount or more."

As each unigin watched Felix's exploits, the gods' reactions highlighted their personalities and interest in this battle.

Apollo's love for entertainment, Demeter's connection to the earth and its beings, Artemis's appreciation for cunning and survival, Zeus's authority and interest in power dynamics, and Athena's strategic and analytical thinking all came into play.

Yet, none of them scheme on making a move, wanting to spectate from a distance to get a better reading...

...

Meanwhile in the void base, suddenly, Felix switched to his main consciousness after picking up on an invasive aura within his spiritual pressure zone.

The moment he extended his senses, he spotted almost invisible birds gliding effortlessly through the skies, their forms merging with the air currents.

'We were found.' Felix remarked calmly, 'Took them long enough.'

As these wind birds reached the vicinity of the void nation's base, they circled above, their presence as light as a feather, yet their observation keen and thorough.

They surveyed the layout, the defenses, and the activities within the base, gathering valuable information with every graceful swoop and glide.

'Aren't you going to stop them?' Candace asked telepathically.

'No, I want them to watch.' Felix smiled coldly without bothering to even glance at the birds.

Upon gathering the necessary intelligence, the wind birds dissipated like mist, carrying the information back to Aeolus.

In his domain, a realm where the winds whispered secrets and the air was alive with knowledge, Aeolus received the reports from his feathered spies.

With a contemplative expression, he contemplated the findings. 'Interesting, he neither took down my scouts nor changed his location. Is he inviting us?'

Without delay, Aeolus relayed the location of Felix's base to the other unigins.

Following this revelation, various unigins sent their scouts.

Since the location was now known, all the unigins with networks reaching the wasteland were able to arrive at the location almost instantly.

Athena created feathered spies from minerals in the soil, Artemis utilized the nearest plants to the location, Demeter used the soil itself, and Apollo was on a different level as he utilized the light itself to create holographic scouts.

Even Hephaestus, Poseidon, and Zeus sent their scouts. Zeus created an entire thunderstorm away from Felix's spiritual pressure-

dominated area while the other two took advantage of the underground volcanic and water networks!

All in all, no one decided to sit this one out and had to put their eyes on Felix.

"It's quite lively now."

Felix showed a faint mocking sneer after his senses picked up on dozens of eyeballs affixed on his void base.

He knew that they knew that he knew that they knew.

So, it made them even more intrigued about his reasoning for not changing his location or getting rid of their scouts.

Unbothered by their attention, Felix carried on with the second part of his plan. He went to the main plaza of the base and gathered all void citizens in a vast open area in front of an elevated platform.

As he stood on the platform, his presence commanded the attention of all.

"You guys know what to do."

He uttered calmly as he invoked the Perfection Manifestation Symbol, a powerful emblem of the pride sin laws.

As he activated the symbol, it materialized above him, radiating a brilliant golden light.

The symbol pulsed with an almost magnetic allure, captivating the eyes and hearts of those who witnessed it.

As the void citizens beheld the spectacle, they felt an overwhelming surge of pride and reverence towards Felix.

Their spontaneous reactions turned into vocal praises and expressions of worship. They hailed Felix's strength, wisdom, and leadership, their words sincere and heartfelt.

"Our Paragon! Our eternal guardian! In you we trust, under your wing, we soar."

"Oh great Paragon, your power rivals that of the sun, your mind as vast as the cosmos. In your hands lies the fate of worlds, and in your eyes, the fire of a thousand stars."

"All hail the Paragon, the Bringer of Light and Shadow, whose wisdom guides us through darkness and whose strength upholds the heavens!"

This outpouring of admiration and devotion created a feedback loop of energy.

Felix's Perfection Manifestation Symbol thrived on this sincere praise, converting it into raw strength that flowed back into him and his clones!

This was the effect of the symbol...It fed on the sincere worship and praise of those lower than Felix in rank and the more sincere they were, the stronger the temporary enhancement!

As the praises continued, his strength began to increase at an astonishing rate, a tangible manifestation of the bond between him and his people!

Felix's form started to glow with a resplendent golden light, reflecting the intensity of the admiration he was receiving.

His skin shimmered like molten gold, a visual testament to the power he was accumulating.

Once Felix and his clones were fully imbued with this newfound strength, glowing with the collective pride of his people, he knew it was time to act.

With a nod of acknowledgment to his citizens, he signaled his two clones, Wrath and Pride,to proceed with the next phase of their plan.

The clones set off towards Hephaestus's territory...Their mission was clear, and with the energy of their people fueling them, they were more than ready to confront whatever challenges lay ahead in the fiery domain of the god of the forge! F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As they departed, the void nation's base erupted into cheers and chants, the citizens watching with a mix of awe and anticipation.

They had played their part in empowering their leader, and now they eagerly awaited the outcome of this bold move against Hephaestus.

'As I have predicted, he is planning to battle Hephaestus with his clones, taking advantage of his weakness and his possession of celestial energy.' Athena remarked with a slightly pleased tone, respecting Felix's intelligence to use clones.

This would help him keep Asna's core safe and engage in battle to steal more celestial energy.

'But, why is he allowing us to see his movements?' Athena soon frowned, 'Hephaestus must have witnessed this scene too.'

She knew that Hephaestus would most definitely be prepared to battle against Felix's two clones and make sure he came out of this without too many losses.

'What is he really planning?' Athena placed a finger on her chin, deep in her own thoughts.
