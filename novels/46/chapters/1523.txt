﻿1524 A Peaceful Departure.

'Welcome back? You are the one returning from death.' Thor chuckled, 'Get down here and give this elderly man a hug.'

'Right away.'

Felix closed his eyes and immediately manifested in his consciousness space right on the surface, unlike the first time when he was thrown from the sky.

When he opened his eyes, he was left speechless at the sight before him.

It was as if a neighborhood had sprung into existence within the confines of his own mind. The space was bustling with activity as his masters and tenants were busy building their individual massive mansions or tiny cozy houses.

One after another, these spectral abodes took shape, each reflecting the personality and preferences of its occupant.

There was a cozy cottage with a tranquil garden, a grand mansion adorned with regal furnishings, and a quaint cabin nestled beneath the shade of towering trees. Each house was distinct, a reflection of the souls that now resided within them.

In the center of this metaphysical neighborhood, a communal area had been established. Here, a chess table stood ready for intellectual duels, a poker table beckoned for games of chance, a pool table invited friendly competition, a royal board awaited strategists to engage in complex battles of wits, and a mini bar with alcohol and all sorts of substances for the two abusers...Thor and Carbuncle.

At the very heart of it, a circular empty table was situated with many chairs, each having a name and a logo engraved on its back.

As Felix observed this bustling community of minds, he couldn't help but feel a profound sense of nostalgia and happiness like he was truly back at home.

"Master!"

Without an ounce of hesitation, Felix appeared next to Thor and gave him his requested hug.

"Haha! Even death can't keep you down, I sure have taught you well."

"Now, now, what do you mean by teaching him that?" Jörmungandr interjected as he reached out and patted Felix's shoulder. "He had yet to settle and you are already trying to steal credits."

"It's not stealing credits if it's a fact." Thor scoffed.

"Sure, sure, whatever you say to boost your little ego."

'Ah, how I have missed this...'

As his masters' bickering kept getting heated over who was the best master, Felix enjoyed it akin to a classical symphony.

It was like a transfer student returning home after a whole year, just to find out absolute chaos in the family between parents and siblings.

The feeling of home intensifies instead of feeling annoyed like always.

"Enough, you are about to bleed his ears." Carbuncle intervened and pulled Felix from amidst them.

"Elder, how are y..."

Before Felix could his question, Carbuncle placed a joint on his mouth and said, "Smoke one with me."

"Alright." Felix obliged.

As they shared the joint together, passing it from one to another, Carbuncle didn't say much but everything he had in his heart seemed to be conveyed through the joint.

The others didn't ruin their moment as they knew that Carbuncle had been waiting patiently for Felix's arrival.

Felix merely smiled faintly and kept taking puff after another until the joint finished.

Carbuncle flicked the joint away and said to Felix with the most sincere smile. "Meeting you has been one of the greatest moments in my life and I am forever and eternally grateful for what you have done for me...Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart."

Before Felix could even reply, he was stunned to witness Carbuncle's body slowly turning into a fine, eathreal ash, just like the dissipating smoke of their last puff.

His form seemed to merge with the very air around him, becoming one with the currents of consciousness that flowed through Felix's mind.

It was a peaceful and graceful departure, a choice made by himself as he found the serenity and closure he had long sought...

In the end, Felix relaxed his expressions and watched with a sense of acceptance and gratitude, knowing that Carbuncle had finally found his peace and could let go at last.

"He has lingered for long enough just to express his gratitude towards you." Lady Sphinx remarked peacefully, "Now, whether his wisp merges with his main consciousness in the spirit realm or not, it can be said that he fulfilled everything he wanted in life."

"I know..."

Felix understood that Carbuncle could never remain with them while he knew that his wife was with his main consciousness.

That's because even though both of them were the same person, they were not linked together at all.

This meant, his main consciousness was feeling all the love and living his dream at last while he was still in the agony of loneliness.

If only it was possible to share their memories and experiences, it wouldn't have mattered much to him to stay here.

Alas...

"Don't be feeling sad for him now." Jörmungandr shook his head, "He is more blessed than all of us."

"It's true." Thor agreed with a tint of envy, "He has achieved the true zenith of peace."

While Lord Shiva, Thor, Jörmungandr, and many other primogenitors were still struggling with their identity and refusing to accept their humiliating purpose in life, Carbuncle couldn't care less about any of it.

He just wanted to live with his wife in peace, nothing more, nothing less.

"I sure will miss him." Felix sighed.

Carbuncle was the first primogenitor to leave Felix's consciousness space after his debt was paid.

Felix had a feeling that others would also leave after they reached their goals in life, which didn't make him feel excellent in the slightest.Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

He had already lost Asna and her missing presence in his mind was vivid in the first minutes. He really didn't want to lose the others too...At least not his masters.

"Rascal, you should remove those thoughts from your mind as none of us are leaving before we see you bring down the eternal kingdom under your feet." Thor disclosed with a faint smirk.

The others nodded in agreement with mixed expressions. It was clear that the moment they found out that they were born by the three rulers for the sake of entertainment, their hatred towards them had reached its peak.

Now, even if Felix killed Suarous and Wendigo or helped Lady Sphinx collect all the monoliths, none of them had any plans of ditching him.

There was no need to mention the three lords.

"You are in it for a show then as I have no plans of leaving the eternal kingdom in peace," Felix said coldly.

...

Half an hour later...

Felix was seen sitting on a bed in one of Lady Sphinx's many rooms inside her supermassive pyramid-like research facility.

He had one AP bracelet on his wrist and the others belonging to the dead tenants were turned into small accessories.

He had just exited from his consciousness space after a lengthy conversation about his future with his masters.

Everyone knew that Lucifer was their new target followed by Nimo's alter ego, but Felix decided to log in to the UVR and check on the SGAlliance, his friends, his race, Nimo, and many other matters.

'A century has gone by, that's ten great resets.' Felix smiled wryly, 'With how rapid the development of the alliance, I am sure many things were changed.'

'First, let's reconnect with the Queen.'

Without further ado, Felix brought the bracelet in front of his eyes and called for Queen Ai.

The moment he did so, the bracelet's screen turned on and Felix found himself inside a tiny empty white room.

"Welcome Sir Felix...Welcome back, Sir Felix..."

Queen Ai corrected herself mid-sentence after Felix's consciousness matched with his previous consciousness before his death.

"It sure nice to hear your monotonous voice again, my Queen." Felix chuckled, but Queen Ai paid him no heads.

"Sir Felix, do you want to redecorate your private room to its previous condition?" Queen Ai asked.

"Not now." Felix inquired, "Tell me first about all my voided contracts after my departure and give me a summary of all the major changes occurring in the alliance in the past century."

"As you wish."

This a make-up chapter for yesterday. My apologies for not announcing it beforehand, I am working through a medical situation at the moment and my time can't be anymore full.

I might even take next Monday off for a doctor's appointment for some scanning. It's not set in stone, but we will see how it goes. Have a blessed day everyone.
