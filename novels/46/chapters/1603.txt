Chapter 1604 All Out. III

1604 All Out. III

"I DARE YOU TO SMILE AFTER THIS!"

In a fit of uncontrollable fury, Nimo's alter ego decided to resort to his most drastic and destructive measure yet!

He brought his seven forms all around Felix, forming a circle around him. Then, he bellowed, "ENERGY IMPLOSION!"

An orange symbol with intricate inscriptions manifested above all of the seven forms, representing the gluttony sin.

When the tenants saw this symbol, all of them turned to the paragon Lilith and asked simultaneously with furious looks, "You never told us about this one either!"

During the battle, they had seen a couple of newer symbols, but because of Felix's immunities, their effects never manifested properly.

They didn't say anything at that time to the paragon Lilith, but they couldn't hold back any longer after seeing another foreign symbol emerge.

Who could blame them for their reaction? The paragon Lilith had assured everyone that Nimo's alter ego wouldn't possess any symbol she hadn't shown them.

"Ah, I kinda forgot about this one...Opse, I guess?" The paragon Lilith chuckled with an unbothered expression.

She couldn't care less about their frustration or anger and the tenants knew that it was their fault for believing that she wanted Felix to win this if just by a little.

Suddenly, their focus was forced back on the battle after seeing the air around Nimo's forms shudder and turn chaotic, making their appearance destabilized while their energies turned erratic and volatile!

If it wasn't for Nimo's alter ego wishing for temporary invincibility, he would have never gone so far as to deal with a mortal.

Alas, drastic situations call for drastic measures.

As the Energy Implosion Symbol activated fully, an ominous tremor ran through the very fabric of the dimension!

It was subtle at first, a mere whisper of movement, but it rapidly grew into a violent shudder that disrupted everything within this once-

stable reality!

The vast ocean, previously a serene expanse of water, began to churn and roil as if caught in an unseen storm. Waves rose to towering heights, crashing against each other with a force that seemed to defy the natural order!

The sky above twisted and distorted, the colors bleeding and swirling as if the very air was rebelling against its usual form!

"Oh no!"

Foremother Siamese, sensing the catastrophic potential of the unfolding chaos, sprung into action with a petrified expression.

She called upon her vast elemental powers, attempting to impose order on the escalating disorder...Her forms worked in unison, each channeling their specific energies to stabilize the dimension.

They pushed against the growing tide of chaos, trying to mend the fabric of space and time that the implosion symbol was tearing apart!

'I can't stop it...His symbol overrides my control...'

But as she battled to save the dimension, Foremother Siamese realized the futility of her efforts.

The particles that made up the very essence of the dimension were becoming erratic and destructive.

They vibrated with an intensity that grew more frenzied by the moment, a clear sign that the entire dimensional structure was on the brink of annihilation!

It was then that she sensed the impending doom and all she could do was use everything in her power to create a barrier around Felix.

Alas...

The six forms of Nimo's alter ego, already destabilized by the symbol's activation, became the epicenter of the disaster.

BOOOOOOOOOOM!! BOOOOOOOOOOM!! BOOOOOOOOM!!....

One by one, they exploded in a series of blinding flashes, each detonation more violent than the last...These explosions were not merely the end of the sin forms but the catalyst for the true implosion.

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

The dimension convulsed as the implosion took full effect...The ocean evaporated in an instant, and the water particles disintegrated into nothingness...The ground cracked and crumbled, the very earth disintegrating under the force of the implosion.

The sky shattered like glass, the fragments of reality swirling into the vortex of destruction at the heart of the implosion...

This catastrophic event didn't stop at a single dimension...The shockwave rippled outwards, reaching the millions of layered unnatural dimensions above it.

Each layer had vibrated, then shook, and finally collapsed, unable to withstand the domino effect of the implosion!

The boundaries between dimensions blurred and then disintegrated, each explosion feeding the next in a chain reaction of annihilation!

In the end, there was nothing left but the void...

A vast, empty expanse where once there had been layers upon layers of reality.

Foremother Siamese, having witnessed the obliteration of everything around her, and the disappearance of Felix and Nimo's alter ego,felt a profound sense of loss and despair.

She knew that somewhere in the void, Felix and Nimo's alter ego remained as none of them could be destroyed by this implosion...

Even if Felix by some miracle survived the implosion and remained conscious, he was now situated in Nimo's alter ego home ground without any backup.

'We are done for...We lost...' She could only close her eyes and let out a deep sigh.

...

In the meantime, Felix and Nimo's alter ego found themselves adrift in the vast, pitch darkness of the void.

Felix's body was a beacon in the oppressive darkness of the void, glowing like a celestial body with an intensity that dwarfed even the sun!

The force of the explosions from the dimensional collapse, rather than destroying him, had been absorbed into his body, causing him to shine a thousand times brighter!

Nimo's alter ego, in contrast, was a dark silhouette against the backdrop of Felix's brilliance.

'I can't believe this...How can you still be alive after that? What the hell is pushing you to keep clinging to life this f*cking hard?!'

Nimo's alter ego completely ignored the blinding brilliance and caught Felix by the neck, shaking his head with intense fervor and a tint of fear.

How could he not be a bit scared when he could see that his core was merely 10% away from being devoured while his enemy, a mortal, refused to die or even pass out?

'I BLEW MILLIONS OF DIMENSIONS AND YOU WERE IN THE HEART OF IT! WHY WON'T YOU DIE ALREADY!'

His emotional roars weren't befitting for a unigin at all, but at this moment, he had the ability to be excused, as no one could remain composed after all of this...

'...' Felix remained silent...It wasn't like he ignored him, but he simply couldn't hear him.

He was already adrift inside his inner dark and empty subconscious...

Asna, Nimo, and his loved ones, who were keeping him going the entire time were nowhere to be seen.

The light in his eyes commenced to fade away, a contrast to his brilliant glow.

His consciousness was at last dying out just like a candle at its last drop of wax, and nothing had the ability to bring it back anymore, not even the power of love... ùíÇll new stùíêries at n0ve/lbi/ùíè(.)cùíêm

He was still a human and humans had their limitations no matter how much he made it seem like he was limitless...

'Haha...Hahaha...You had me worried for a second there.'

After sensing Felix losing consciousness at last, Nimo's alter ego laughed out loud as he enabled go of him.

'I really thought I was about to use my territorial pressure to finish you off, that would be the most humiliating experience in my life.'

Still, no response.

Crack! Crack! Crack!...

Meanwhile, the tenants bore witness to a scene that filled them with dread and sorrow.

They watched, their eyes wide with a mix of fear and desperation, as Felix's soul barrier, the last line of defense protecting his very essence, commenced to crack and fracture...

"Felix..."

"No!! No!! Please! No!! Sob...Please!!"

Candace cried out loud while flying to the soul barrier, trying her best to keep it from breaking apart, but alas, at this point, not even Lord Hades had the ability to help Felix.

His soul was beyond redemption after everything he put it through...He had the ability to revive him after his death, but a break must happen first.

"And the saga concludes..." Lord Shiva sighed as he sealed his manga book on the last page.
