Chapter 1501 The First Ruler.

1501 The First Ruler.

"To be sent off as the only spy and kickstart an entire invasion, it's obvious he is a big shot up there." Felix nodded with a serious expression.

Since the spirit realm was sealed for the eternal kingdom's spirits, it meant that Duke Humphrey was sent off to the living world and allowed himself to die or turn into a spirit somehow.

Felix didn't know how exactly Duke Humphrey pulled off the infiltration without losing his memories, but to reach this far, he was a true mastermind.

"Who is this strongest being exactly?" Felix narrowed his eyes. "Is he one of the beings who imprisoned you?"

Asna felt a profound weight in her heart...The thought of that being brought her bad memories and if it was up to her, she would never speak about him.

"You don't need to tell me if you..."

"No, you have to learn those things." Asna shook her head and steeled her heart. "You have been interacting way too often with them and if fate has it that you enter the eternal kingdom, it's best to know what you will be dealing with."

"You see, the universe is believed to be created out of five pillars. The three celestial languages, the laws, and the elements." Asna shared, "Just like elements could gain consciousness with enough energy and time, what do you think will happen when laws and..."

Her words, tinged with determination, were about to unveil the secrets of the cosmos when, suddenly, the very sky above the city rumbled with an awe-inspiring presence.

A deep, resonating voice, like the very voice of the universe itself, echoed from the heavens.

Its authority was unquestionable, sending shivers down the spines of all who heard it even when they were frozen in time!

"Child," the voice intoned, its power palpable, "You have fooled enough. It is time for you to return home."

"You..."

Asna's eyes widened in dread and alarm, for she recognized the voice as that of the being she hated‚Äîthe strongest, the most ancient, and the most revered in the universe!

It was a voice that transcended the boundaries of mortal comprehension, a voice that commanded respect and obedience from all who heard it!

'Godfather, You really managed to involve the First Ruler in our plan...What the,' Duke Humphrey thought with a look of utter reverence.

The only reason he hadn't freed himself from the time freeze through his divinity was because of his confidence in his godfather.

Since he uttered he took care of Asna, he trusted him and waited for the reinforcement to arrive and handle her without needing to waste what was left of his precious divinity.

Yet, not in his wildest dreams did he expect the reinforcement to be the First Ruler...The most revered and powerful being across all realms!

Meanwhile, Felix couldn't understand the language spoken, but Asna's fearful reaction made him understand immediately who he was dealing with.

Felix fought against the fear crawling on his spine and stood in front of Asna, his gaze cold and resolved as he stared into the portal.

"Lower your gaze."

With an authoritative order, Felix found himself hurtling through the air at supersonic speed!

Without warning or apparent physical force, he crashed into the ground below, his impact creating a deep crater amidst the rubble!

'Huh?'

Felix lay within the crater, momentarily dazed, having absolutely no idea what happened to him. If it wasn't for the numbing pain coursing through his flesh, he would have thought that it was a dream.

"Felix!"

Worried and angered, Asna tried to rush toward Felix but found herself suffering from a powerful spiritual pressure that made her incapable of moving a single inch!!

This was Asna, who possessed one of the highest spiritual pressures in the universe, yet, she could do nothing against it!

"Don't make this harder than it is...Either come up voluntarily or your little lover will come up with you." The voice thundered across the entire heavenly realm even though he was addressing Asna alone.

"Don't you dare!" Asna felt shivers course down her soul after hearing the last statement. She knew that if he brought Felix up, it would be the end of him.

He could be turned into a toy and get passed between unigins or worse, has his soul trapped in a divine item.

Whatever it was, his life would be hell and she wouldn't be able to save him even if she wanted.

Suddenly, Felix burst through the rubble with blood covering his entire body as he bellowed furiously, "Asna! Don't you dare think about it!"

Alas, before he could even cross half the distance, he got smacked yet again into the rubble against his control. G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

"I won't show mercy a third time."

The voice addressed Asna again like the only reason he wasn't finishing off Felix in one move was because of her.

"Fine, I will come! Just don't touch him again, please, don't touch him again..." Asna begged, her voice quivering in despair.

She knew that being was more than capable of erasing Felix's existence with a mere thought now that the eternal kingdom was connected to the spirit realm.

He might not show himself, but his presence was covering the entire heavenly plane and if he wanted, he could turn it into a wasteland in a split second...

"Can I at least talk to him one last time?"

"..."

Nothing was said, but the spiritual pressure on her was released, making her understand that she was given permission.

Without any thought of foul play, Asna rushed to Felix's side and pushed him down, forcing him to stay on the ground.

"You can't..."

"Shut up!" Asna yelled with tears glistening in her eyes. She embraced him tightly, her voice trembling but filled with love and resolve. "Felix, from the moment our paths crossed, you became the light in my universe, the one who showed me the true depth of love and courage."

She held him even closer as if fearing that the universe might tear him away before she had uttered everything she needed to. "You've faced the darkest forces the cosmos could muster, and you've done it all with strength and determination that astounds me every time. You've shown me what it means to fight for what you believe in, to never give up, no matter the odds."

"If so..."

"Let me finish!" She shushed him with a finger and continued with her voice quivering, and her grip on Felix tightened. "Our love has been a force greater than anything, and it will remain unbroken, even across the boundaries of realms. Remember, no matter where you are, my heart will always be yours."

With tears streaming down her face, Asna leaned in and pressed her lips to Felix's in a passionate and lingering kiss, pouring all her love and longing into that final connection.

When their lips parted, she whispered, "You are my eternal flame, Felix, and nothing in this universe can extinguish my love for you."

Before Felix could speak a single word, Asna froze him in time as well with a smile filled with sorrow and helplessness.

Felix's heart broke to pieces the moment he saw that smile as it made him feel like a useless wrench, a useless weakling, whose all talk, no actions.

His woman was being forced against her will to return to the side of her mortal enemies and as her man, instead of protecting her, she was the one doing the protection.

As he watched her fly into the eternal kingdom's portal with bloodshot frozen eyes, Asna whispered a wishing in his mind, 'As you journey through the realms, remember that you carry my heart within you, a beacon of hope and resilience.'

The moment she finished, a radiant light pillar emerged and connected their souls together. Felix felt his soul getting strengthened twofold, threefolds, and even reached tenfolds!

Yet, he didn't show an ounce of reaction to it...His eyes never left Asna and only after she disappeared through the eternal portal did he finally manage to speak his first sentence with a single tear affixed on the right side of his eye.

'I am sorry for being weak...I am so sorry...I am so sorry...'
