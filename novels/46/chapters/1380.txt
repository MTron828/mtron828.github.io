1381 The Wail of The Universe.

While Felix's last thought was a question, a question targeting his unjust and unfair death, Asna's last thought was a curse.

‚ÄòF*ck you!!!‚Äò

She knew who did this and the notion of them daring enough to lay their hands on her lover set her heart ablaze...Alas, her rage didn't last for long as the moment Felix died, she followed him instantly.

The moment their merged soul came out of his body, the universe wailed...It did not speak in words but in actions.

RUMBLE RUMBLE!!!

The stars shivered, their dazzling lights flickering as if in response to a cold, bitter wind. Planets rumbled, their cores shaken to the point where lands cracked and oceans boiled.

In every corner of the cosmos, space quaked. A chorus of celestial bodies echoed their dissent against this unnatural act, their harmonious dance disrupted by the unspeakable loss of Asna.

Cosmic dust swirled like angry storms, painting the sky with hues of despair.

Galaxies seemed to vibrate in fury, their spiral arms contorting as though writhing in pain.

The ethereal lights, once a testament to the universe's beauty, now appeared as mourning candles...Their shimmer had turned into a hue of melancholy, a silent tribute to the lost life.

Supernovas, those grand cosmic fireworks, exploded prematurely. Their spectacularly devastating demise sent shockwaves across the universe, their deafening roar echoing the heartrending sentiment shared by all.

What was once a spectacular natural phenomenon was now an anguished cry, a lullaby of sorrow...

A universal apocalypse seemed imminent, and the universe itself mourned the death of Asna.

This was not a regular death; it was a blow to the cosmic equilibrium, a transgression against the very fabric of existence.

And so, the universe roared in fury and wept in sorrow, the cosmic heartache echoing through infinity, a chilling reminder of the price of taking a life that mattered to the cosmos.

Fear rippled across all entities, mortal or not, as they faced the wrath of a grieving universe. The stars shook, the galaxies wailed, and the planets rumbled.

A universal cry against the loss of one of its closest and dearest beings to it...

While all of this seemed to have taken a lot of time, it barely lasted one second after Felix's body lay flat inside his VRPod.

Thud!!

Lady Sphinx and Fenrir charged through Felix's room in his spaceship and swiftly got him outside of the VRPod, ignoring the ongoing universal mayhem...They placed him on the floor, uncaring about how hot his body was or the smoke that was

continuously coming out of him.

"Fenrir."

"I will try."

Fenrir reached out with his hand and released the chilling cold of absolute zero, wanting to freeze Felix and his soul in time before"

it escaped from his body.

He knew that if he pulled this off, there would still be hope to revive Felix easily with either Lord Zurvan, Lord Quetzalcoatl, or Lord Osiris' help and they wouldn't struggle too much.

Alas, just as he was about to release it, Lady Sphinx muttered with a heavy heart, "We were too late..."

When Fenrir heard her, he turned around and saw that Lady Sphinx's eyes had four triangles in them and were shimmering with grey light.

"Too damn late..."

Every fiber of her being screamed in denial, a raw pain coursing through her as she watched the soul, his essence, gently floating upwards, leaving behind the lifeless vessel that had once housed it...

Her usually bright, observant eyes were dull, brimming with anguish that was ineffable.

"..."

Fenrir didn't say anything, knowing that Lady Sphinx might not like showing her emotions in public, but she treated Felix more as a son than as a student...

To see one's son die so suddenly was a shocking event on its own, but to see his own soul flying away from you was a different pain entirely.

Abruptly, Lady Sphinx was forced to close her eyes against her will.

I'I got kicked out..." She said, her eyes somewhat bleeding, suffering from the consequences of spying into the spirit realm.

Eee Eee...

Albeit late, Nimo rushed next to Felix from a void rift and started to nudge him with his head while whimpering inaudibly.

Meanwhile, Candace was seen standing near the void rift with her hand covering her mouth and eyes filled with tears, wanting to get close to Felix, but knowing that she couldn't be out of any help.

But the same didn't apply to Nimo as the moment he realized that Felix wasn‚Äòt waking up, his eyes suddenly turned green and the symbol of greed appeared above his head.

It was of a fox with six red eyes and green fur and it was looking menacingly at everyone in the room.ReùíÇùíÇd the latest stories ùíên novùíÜlbin(.)com

Eee Eee!

Nimo looked at the fox and squealed at it while nudging his head with Felix‚Äòs shoulder, making it understand that he wanted him to be revived.

The green fox seemed alive as it scanned Felix‚Äòs body and its flying spirit...When it looked at it too deeply, it turned back and voiced the price for his revival.

Everyone knew it as all of them had greed symbols appear above their heads, and even an additional one on top of Nimo's head!

Yet, the fox still shook its head and disappeared on its own, causing Nimo to start squealing at it angrily.

"I knew it..." Lady Sphinx sighed in disappointment.

While Fenrir and Candace had some faith that Nimo would be able to revive Felix, she already recognized that wasn‚Äòt going to happen.

If it was just Felix alone, she wouldn't have doubted Nimo's capabilities, but Felix's soul was merged with Asna.

Even if the entire universe was sacrificed as a price for the sin of greed, it would never grant Nimo the wish to revive a unigin of Asna‚Äòs standings...

That's why those symbols lit up above their heads as it made it clear that even if all of them were placed for a trade right now, it wasn't close to being enough to pay the price.

Nimo could not override those rules as they're the laws of greed and he was a mere controller of them, not their creator...

"So, that's it?" Candace sobbed, "They're gone?"

Besides Nimo‚Äòs painful squeals, no one anwsered her question...While Fenrir had nothing to respond with, Lady Sphinx was deep in her thoughts.

Even in death, she took control over her emotions and turned on her rational cold thinking to find a solution to either undo this or at least help Felix and Asna in the spirit realm.

'Lord Quetzalcoatl hasn't been reachable for more than a decade now and he should be in the spirit realm or some weird corner in the universe.‚Äò

'Lord Zurvan won‚Äòt help us as this is clearly related to those beings and he wants nothing to do with them...The same applied to Lord Osiris.‚Äò

'So, chances of reviving Felix and Asna are close to none and it's a waste of time to think in this area...Most importantly.‚Äò

Lady Sphinx gave up on Felix's instant revival for another reason too.

'As a unigin, Asna's soul brilliance is beyond anything else in this universe, and even with Felix's achievements and such, he couldn‚Äòt amount to 1% of her brilliance. This ensures that the Charons will get them picked up before anyone else and take them to the heavenly plane.‚Äò

'The moment someone steps there, he will be under the jurisdiction of the spirits guardian‚Äòs government and it will be near impossible to pull their souls from there.‚Äò

Spirits realm was one thing and the heavenly plane was another. It was like the spirit realm was the desert and the heavenly plane was its sole guarded oasis.

Anyone who entered the oasis could not leave anymore unless permission was granted by the supreme leader.

'With Asna's unique soul, the Charon will most definitely take them straight to the spirits guardian. I don't know what he will do next, but Kraken said he does not kill anyone, so both of them will be fine. No, Asna will be fine, but Felix will get thrown inside the heavenly plane's system and with his memories being erased completely, he will be reborn there as a new one.‚Äò

'We can not have that happening.‚Äò Lady Sphinx reached the crux of her plan, ‚ÄòMy first agenda is to create another wisp of Kraken and establish a connection with him and the spirit realm.‚Äò

She knew that Elder Kraken would work as hard as possible to help out Felix and Asna in the realm of the spirits, but she wanted to know how things develop there and provide help from her end.

'Second, I‚Äòll revive all the dead tenants' wisps, which shouldn't be difficult.‚Äò

Since only Thor, Jurmi, Carbuncle, Kraken, and Lord Shiva were lost for good, it would be easy for her to create their wisps with human test subjects, helping them reach 99% in their cultivation.

'Only Elder Kraken will be difficult as I need more soul threads to make one wisp, I can not do it without Asna's help to extract those threads.‚Äò Lady Sphinx thought of Lord Loki, 'With his soul and mental expertise, he can help with this.'

Speaking of the devil, Lord Loki's holographic image appeared unannounced from Lady Sphinx's bracelet.

"What an interesting way to go out." He commentated with an intrigued tone. "Though, if they wanted him dead, why bother to send his soul to the spirit realm instead of erasing it?"

"That‚Äòs one of the questions burning in my mind...But, it's not the time to focus on the whys." Lady Sphinx uttered calmly, "Help me revive Kraken‚Äòs wisp."
