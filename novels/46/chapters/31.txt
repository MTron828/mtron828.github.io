Chapter 32:The Bloodline Market

Felix queued obediently just like the others. No matter how angry he was about their management. He still needs to play their game if he wants to obtain the loan.

20 minutes later...

His turn had arrived, this time he did not greet anyone and just straightaway put his wrist in the scanning device.

The employee was pleased about this as well, as he preferred customers like those who do not waste his time with meaningless questions and conversations.

"I see that you applied for your first loan."

He read the scanned details in his screen and continued, "Based on the SGA rules. Every member of a newly joined planet can apply for a 100.000 SC loan with 3% interest increase monthly." He informed, "The next loans will need an explanation and the purpose of use. As for the interest, it will be 6% monthly."

"Is everything understood Mr. Felix?"

"Yes."

"Good, 100.000 SC has been added to your bank account. You can use it to buy anything within the UVR. I wish you have a nice day."

"Next in line please." The employee excused him.

Felix nodded his head and left the floor.

After a while, he exited the bank and called for a hover cab using his bracelet, heading to the gambling den to place his bet.

…

10 minutes later....

He was sitting on a couch, drinking coffee while watching tens of holograms, each displaying live a different game from a different rank and tier.

'The game I remember still has not started. I guess it will be on tomorrow Saturday since it is a battle royal type.'

He figured so, as those games extremely popular within the spectators, due to their brutal and simple condition to win them. One only needs to emerge as the last survivor within hundreds or thousands of players to clutch the championship. As for others, only death awaits them. Such a brutal game mode is what delights the commoners' boring lives.

'Well no biggy, I will place my bet on the winner now and come watch tomorrow.'

He tapped on his bracelet, and a large hologram appeared in front of him, that no one else can see.

He entered the Gambling den Official website and clicked on the games happening tomorrow. Immediately, he was transferred to another tab that had a long list of games.

'Queen, please find me a 500 player battle royal from this list.' Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Without wasting any effort the Queen quickly highlighted three games based on his requirement. He pressed on the one at the bottom and details of the game displayed in another side hologram.

//Game Format: Free For All

Game Name: 500 Battle Royal

Players Number: 500

Integration Allowed: From origin purity to peak stage 2 of replacement.

Ranks Allowed: Silver and Gold

Player list: (Please click on it for extended details.)//

He clicked on it and typed Solid Wall in the search bar. He had no plans to waste time scrolling 500 names for him.

Immediately after doing so, Solid Wall profile was displayed in front of him, with a large button underneath it that said >Bet on this player<.

Without further ado, he placed all of his Coins on him emerging victorious. His winning chances were 1 in 10, which were not bad considering there were participants who had 1 in 30 winning chances.

After Felix finished placing his bet, he went forward and put his wrist in the scanning device.

"Your bet has been successfully placed. No one knows the details of your bet except the Queen AI."

"Good luck sir." said a middle-aged man who was behind the counter.

Felix thanked him politely and left the gambling den, planning to head towards the Bloodline Market to browse the shop.

…

15 minutes later…

Felix paid the cab fees and walked inside a bustling market, which was filled with noises of sellers using their loudest voices to advertise their bloodline products, and buyers haggling down the outrageous prices.

As he stepped in, he heard a familiar voice, he could never forget.

"Gather around me everyone, for I about to show you the greatest deal of your life."

A fat man with a belly bear called loudly while holding a small cage in one hand that housed a red sparrow, exposing two long fangs from its beak. Meanwhile, on the other hand, holding a glass bottle filled with blood.

After seeing that he gathered a good amount of people, he began his presentation.

"This is an epic rank tier 1 bloodline beast, the fanged sparrow." He lifted the cage high above and continued passionately, "It is currently on the verge of extinction, as there are only 100 of its species in the universe." He put the cage down and showed the bottle of blood. "I was lucky enough to obtain its bloodline from a beast hunter who needed coins urgently." He paused to catch his breath, and carried on, "I am willing to sell it for only 500,000 SC, a cheap price for such endangered species."

"Don't you think?" He asked them confidently, showing not a hint of deceptiveness.

Too bad, his confidence was shattered instantly after being exposed publicly.

"Who are you trying to scam you moron? Isn't that just an uncommon rank red sparrow that had a small mutation from eating something he shouldn't?"

An old man who had his own stall nearby pointed his finger at the fat seller and carried on exposing his furiously. " His price does not even reach 200 SC, yet turned it into a half million, and you dare call it cheap?! Have some limit and shame when you try to scam idiots. You are ruining the business for all of us."

The shoppers' eyes instantly turned frigid as they eyed the fat sellers, and began throwing rocks and empty bottles at him, forcing him to close his prematurely.

If abilities were allowed to be used within public places, the fat seller would have already been torn to pieces.

"No need to bother yourselves with that human scum. Come to my shop and see what you like." The old man did not waste this opportunity and quickly began promoting his bottles after stealing the crowd.

"My bloodlines are all legit." He lifted one bottle from the many ones in his stall and said confidently, "This epic rank tier 2 The Cobalt Nightmare Bison. You can search for it right now online, and find all about its information, element, abilities, and market price." He smiled genuinely, "I am only selling it for 4 million SC."

After seeing them recoil after hearing his price, he offered them a 5% discount on the house, claiming that it was an apology for almost getting scammed next to him.

"Please don't lose your trust in us bloodline dealers. That's all this poor old man asks for." He sighed dejectedly over the miserable faith of the bloodline industry.

"If only other dealers were as honest and trustworthy as you. We wouldn't need to have our guard up every time we enter this market, which is filled with 90% scammers." A kind-looking woman said disappointingly.

"Indeed, and he is right guys. I have just searched for the information about the Nightmare Bison, and everything checks outright." A young junior showed a hologram to everyone, displaying every public information about the bloodline. He added strangely, "But, the real actual price of this beast is a whopping 6 million SC, while this kind man only sells it for 4 million."

Indeed it was quite suspicious that someone wanted to sell an Epic rank Tier 2 beast while lowering its price by 35%. Not to mention the extra 5% the shop owner offered.

The old man lifted his head and stared at the beautiful blue sky in the UVR, and said softly with tears streaming down his cheeks.

"If my poor daughter was not raped and beaten to almost a half-dead state by a vicious young master from a clan. I would not have sold this treasure with a such large discount." He covered his face with his hands and sobbed miserably.

"I desperately need coins as fast as possible to treat her injuries."

The crowd around him expression softened a bit, after seeing such an old man weeping silently.

"Old man I will support your cause, and buy this bloodline from your hands. I hope your daughter gets well."

The kind woman made her move and offered to buy the bloodline. However, she was quickly stopped by another buyer.

"Hold on now miss. Let this gentleman helps a brother in need. I despise those despicable young masters who lay their hands on other people's daughters. And to show support I will increase the price to 4 million and a half."

"I bid 5 million for it. I want to gift it to my grandson who is about to enter the first stage of replacement. I hope no one fights it out with me." A red-haired elder threatened them jokingly with his can.

Too bad a handsome young lad didn't care about his request, as he politely raised the price.

"6 million here, I need it for myself. This bloodline is perfect for my first replacement."

The seller immediately intervened, after the price reached 6 million, the same price as in the market.

"My dear costumes, I can't allow you to keep biding like this for it. I will sell it to this young lad, and when my daughter gets well I will order more, and sell them with a 20% discount to you. Come give me your contact number." He offered apologetically.

The bidders glanced at each other and shrugged their shoulders.

"No issue, I was merely trying to extend a hand."

"Me as well."

"Even though I needed it, I can tell my grandson to wait for no problem."

The seller bowed and thanked them continuously for their understanding. He then approached the handsome young man and gave him the bottle.

The young man took hold of it and smiled in satisfaction over this transition.

"Please give me your bank account details so I can wire you the coins." He requested.

The old man lightly touched his bracelet with the young man, sending him his bank serial code.

"Here it is."

Just as the young junior was about to hit accept. A loud voice interrupted him.

"WAIT, HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! DON'T SELL IT, UNCLE!!"

Felix entered the fray with a different face and a hidden glint in his eyes.
