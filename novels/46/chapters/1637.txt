Chapter 1638 A Warm Welcome! V

1638 A Warm Welcome! V

Meanwhile, in the vastness of space, Felix and Hephaestus engaged in a battle of cosmic proportions!

They were like gods clashing among the stars, their every move resonating through the universe.

Felix was forced into taking action in his current massive size after Hephaestus showed him that he possessed the Celestial Cage.

He knew that the moment he reduced his size back to normal, Hephaestus would stick to him akin to glue until both of his cores would get ripped out of his body and enter the Celestial Cage!

'The three rulers really aren't messing around.' Lilith chuckled, 'They must have provided all participants in the hunt with a Celestial Cage.'

Since Celestial Cage needed the purest forms of celestial energy with a massive quantity to lure in the cores, the three rulers had to help out Hephaestus and the others.

Naturally, the cages needed to be returned to them at the end of the hunt as they couldn't afford to lose that much celestial energy.

The eternal kingdom was already facing an immense shortage of celestial energy to the point, that it could barely cover 40% of the eternal kingdom's territory!

The rest was considered a wasteland and the unigins weren't focusing on expanding their territories outward because of this.

For this exact reason, Felix was now suffering under Hephaestus without the possibility of utilizing either celestial white flames or black flames!

The eternal kingdom's gate was closer to the edges of the eternal kingdom than its heart, which made it near impossible for celestial energy to reach this space.

The worst part?

'Asna's core is aching for celestial energy and it messing with my head! It wants the celestial energy in the cage!' Felix uttered with a distressed look, as he kept evading the relentless assault of Hephaestus.

Each star under his command became a weapon, firing beams of concentrated stellar energy!

The sky around them erupted in a dazzling display of light and power, as star after star unleashed its fury!

Amidst the chaos of battle, Felix's mind raced for a solution and Asna's core throwing a tantrum wasn't making it any easier.

It was like a baby starved for milk and Hephaestus had put a bottle right in front of it. Of course, it would act up...Especially, when Felix didn't have as much of a control of it as Asna!

"What an irritating symbol."

Hephaestus cursed as he watched Felix able to absorb the energies from his attacks.

Since he was using actual stars, the amount of energy they released, whether active or during their explosion, was massive enough to empower Felix significantly.

Right now, Felix was growing stronger with each successful dodge or block, regardless if he was harmed or not!

Hephaestus knew that the fight could not last like this and had to go all out to finish Felix off once and for all!

As he was preparing for his ultimate attack, a new presence made itself known on the ground near the void barrier.

Apollo materialized out of pure light, a radiant figure emerging gracefully amid the chaos...He was sitting on a cloud of darkness while holding his divine lyre in his hands.

As Apollo took in the scene before him, his eyes sparkled with a mixture of interest and excitement.

"I am glad I have taken a couple of shortcuts through the spatial gateways."

He clapped with a thrilled expression as he watched the spectacle of Felix and Hephaestus, two behemoths locked in a battle of cosmic proportions!

"Ah, what a performance! It's a sin that such battle isn't accompanied by a score!"

Apollo exclaimed, his voice melodic and resonant, carrying through the vast expanse of space.

He placed the lyre on his lap and strummed the strings gently, the sound harmonizing with the energy of the battlefield, adding an ethereal melody to the backdrop of their struggle.

While Felix and Hephaestus were the size of stars and surrounded by supernovas, their ears still picked up on Apollo's melodious music.

Both paused their actions for a moment and glanced downward, zooming until their eyes locked on the stunning Apollo playing the lyre with his eyes closed, appearing like a prince charming of any girl's fantasy.

'Sh*t, if this quirky f*cker has arrived, it means Zeus is getting closer!'

Hephaestus' expression turned slightly for the worst.

He wasn't that concerned about Apollo, knowing that he was never interested in collecting celestial energy or becoming an upper celestial.

He mostly sought out entertainment and joy in things, regardless if the situation was going to benefit him or cause him problems.

However, Zeus was a different story.

He was just like Hephaestus, a being of immense ambition whose only goal at the instant was to become an upper celestial.

In other words?

'It's time to finish this!'

Hephaestus accelerated his preparation for his ultimate attack while Felix was getting more stressed by the second.

'I have to escape now!'

Just like Hephaestus, he was strapped for time, and Apollo's appearance made him understand that it wouldn't be long before a party of unigins would gather up here.

So, he used whatever brain juice left in him to come up with a plan, no matter how wacky or ridiculous it was!

When he thought in this manner, a sudden idea landed in his mind!

However, before he could decide whether to commit to it or not, Hephaestus began to merge thousands of stars in his palm, manipulating their energies to converge into a singular, volatile point in space!!

The stars, drawn inexorably together, began to shimmer and pulsate with unstable energy, teetering on the brink of collapse!

When Felix saw this, he felt a chill course down his spine, knowing that his hunger symbol would not be able to absorb enough energy before his body turned into ashes, leaving only his cores behind!

The first thought that came to his mind was to reduce his size, but then, he realized that wouldn't be enough to save him or his people.

What's worse? Apollo was down there near his people...While he was merely playing music matching this epic confrontation, Felix understood that he wouldn't allow him to escape if he got close to him!

"Brat!" Hephaestus bellowed, his voice echoing across the cosmos, "Witness the might of a thousand suns!"

His eyes glowed with a fierce intensity as he observed the formation of the disturbance star core, a precursor to a black hole!

However, before the blackhole could manifest, Hephaestus swung his divine hammer at the star heart with everything he had!

The impact was cataclysmic, transforming the core into a plasma beam of unimaginable power, the concentrated fury of a thousand suns released at once!!

The plasma beam tore through space, a brilliant, unstoppable force that threatened to obliterate everything in its path!!

Felix, recognizing the imminent danger, acted with lightning speed.

He summoned the seven hydra tails...The tails, majestic and fearsome, encircled Felix, ready to defend him with their lives!

"Let's counter fire with corruption!"

Left with no choice, Felix had to fall back on his evil energy as it was the only thing in his arsenal that couldn't be canceled by the radiant divinity!

The seven heads reared back, their mouths agape, gathering a swirling mass of dark, corruptive energy!

"Corruption Breath!"

Then, the seven streams of corruption energy merged into a single, concentrated beam, a concentrated torrent of corruption!!

As the plasma beam, a torrent of a thousand suns' fury, collided with Felix's concentrated beam of corruptive energy, the melody reached a fever pitch!

"That's it! Dance for me! Show me your true passion and struggle!"

Apollo's fingers moved across the lyre with fervent passion, each note resonating with the power of the cosmic collision.

The strings vibrated under the force of his touch, emitting a sound so profound and complex that it seemed to capture the very essence of the battle.

Apollo's erratic smile got wider and wider as beads of sweat formed on his forehead while he poured his divine energy into the performance!

It was a instant of transcendent beauty and perfection as the melody reached its zenith at the exact moment of the beams' impact, creating a musical explosion that mirrored the cosmic one!!! Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

RUMMMMMMMBLE!!!

The divine barrier protecting the eternal kingdom from external threats was rocked after the shockwave of the beams' collision reached it, causing a powerful earthquake to arise underneath the cosmic battleground!

"AHHHHHH!!" "AArgh!!!" "I can't stand!!"

The Void Nation citizens were left lying on the ground with their hands protecting their heads unable to use any of their powers for protection due to the lockdown.

Meanwhile, Apollo couldn't care less about the raging wind blowing his luminous hair as he continued playing the lyre with such intensity and passion, that he turned Felix and Hephaestus's duel into a cosmic opera!

Meanwhile, The impact site of the beams became a maelstrom of clashing energies, the plasma's searing heat against the corruption's dark coldness!

Alas, there was no way Felix's corruption beam would be able to rival a concentrated beam from a thousand suns.

"Argh!!"

Thus, Felix poured more of his energy into the corruption beam, his face set in a determined grimace, uncaring about his slowly melting skin...All he was trying to do was buy time, buy time for his escape plan!
