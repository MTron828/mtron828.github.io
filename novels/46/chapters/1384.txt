1385 Spirits Guardian Hades.

‚ÄòI don't care if it‚Äòs the same Felix, I don't want one from a different timeline.' Selphie rejected the proposal without an ounce of hesitation.

In her eyes, bringing Felix from another dimension would be considered cheating her own emotions as she had them for this one, not another variation.

Plus, she would be taking Felix from her own variation as well and god knows what she would do to bring him back.

'Then, find out a way to create a reversing time spell capable of bringing back even spirits.l Lady Yggdrasil said with a stern tone, ‚ÄòI don‚Äòt care what you do, but you aren‚Äòt allowed to harm yourself.‚Äò

With that being said, Lady Yggdrasil took off. Honestly, Selphie couldn't harm herself even if she wanted as Lady Yggdrasil's wisp of consciousness was watching from within her.

‚ÄòReversing time to bring back spirits? Even the time primogenitors can‚Äòt do it, how can I achieve that.‚Äò

Selphie hugged her knees and sulked in silence, having no idea what to do next with her life...But one thing was certain, she wasn't going to give up on finding ways to bring Felix back.

...

In The Spirit Realm...

The goat‚Äîlike Charon had guided his boat back to the Heavenly Plane.

‚ÄòIt looks much comfier than the living world...‚Äò Asna thought to herself as she expanded her senses outside of the boat.

Although she had seen the heavenly plane through Kraken's memories, it wasn‚Äòt the same experience as seeing it with her own eyes.

Her description fitted the heavenly plane‚Äòs atmosphere quite well as appeared serene and had an otherworldly tableau of extraordinary beauty and grandeur.

Stretching out in all directions, the landscape below was bathed in a gentle, ethereal glow that seemed to emanate from the very fabric of the realm itself.

The tranquility here was not just visual but permeated the air, settling over the plane like a comforting blanket of peace and calm.

The sky, a pristine canvas of cerulean and gold was studded with a constellation of spirits in various forms, illuminating the vast expanse with their radiant aura.

The celestial beasts, majestic and ethereal, gracefully move among the clouds, their every movement emanating waves of mystical energies.

Even the objects that floated within this aerial ballet were extraordinary, strange, and beautiful all at once. Shimmering orbs of light, the whispered remains of ancient celestial bodies, mystical platforms carrying age‚Äîold temples, and floating islands with verdant flora, all peacefully coexist in this transcendent landscape.

Intermingling with this spectacle were streams of iridescent energies, the spiritual rivers that flowed seamlessly through the air, carrying with them the souls of the departed, who danced in them like spectral fish in a heavenly stream.

The spectral boat continued on its journey toward the center of the heavenly plane. It seemed like everyone respected and feared the Charons as no one dared to block the boat's path.

Even though the heavenly plane was immensely large and covered possibly more than thousands of times Earth‚Äòs surface area, the boat reached the center in a few minutes at best.

‚ÄòI can feel his existence...‚Äò

Asna‚Äòs soul immediately shuddered the instant she entered the range of the Ethereal Palace. This palace was pulsating with a spiritual radiance that commanded attention.

It stood as a testament to the realm‚Äòs serene might and the profound wisdom of the spirits that governed here.

The palace, a celestial dwelling of pure white marble, glowed with an ethereal luminescence. Towers, domes, and turrets reached into the ever‚Äîchanging sky, echoing the stars' twinkling dance.

The palace‚Äòs size was immeasurable, not bound by ordinary dimensions, and instead expanded and contracted according to the will of its celestial inhabitants.

The moment the Charon got close to the palace's gate, he stopped the boat and went to pick up Asna/Felix's soul...Then, he got off and floated inside the magnificent shimmering unguarded gate.

As he walked across the vast halls, the air was filled with a gentle hum, a celestial symphony, like a soothing hymn reverberating from the palace‚Äòs very foundations...Yet, Charon‚Äòs heart was beating out of his chest in agitation and a bit of excitement.

'I can't believe I am entering the ethereal palace and about to see the elders and master.‚Äò

This Charon was a devoted worker to the spiritual government for eons and he had never got this close to the ethereal palace...Even when his social status could be considered a hundred times higher than golden spirits!

This should speak volumes of how difficult it was to get in touch with the spirits guardian and if it was not for Asna‚Äòs identity, Felix would have been nothing but another commoner spirit.I think you should take a look at

"Get in."

Immediately after the Charon arrived at the heart of the palace, the door to the Eathreal Elders Assembly was pushed wide open for him.

With his spider‚Äòs legs shaking nervously, the Charon walked in with his head bowed to the limit.

Before he could open his mouth, he found himself without the container and had his back already facing the assembly.

"Leave."

lust like a heavenly decree, the Charon continued his path outside of the assembly and returned to his boat.

This entire experience took merely a few seconds and he didn't even see either his master or the elders...However, his heart was still beating out loud in stimulation like someone who had won the lottery.

‚ÄòHehehe, Aakkill will surely die again of envy when I tell him about this.‚Äò He grinned widely as he took off into the sky, returning to his eternal duty.

Meanwhile, inside the Ethereal Assembly, a bit of ruckus was risen.

"Brother Hades, it's been a while." Asna greeted with a faint chuckle as she emerged from the container as a humanoid spirit.

She was speaking with the eternal kingdom language, a language only unigins could decipher and understand.

"Little witch, I see you are still causing trouble everywhere you go."

The Spirits Guardian Hades replied, his voice as deep as the ocean yet seemingly as pleasing as a hummingbird, a unique voice indeed.R√™Ad latùôöSt chapters at n√¥(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He was perched regally upon his throne of spectral silver, commanding the attention with an air of quiet, indomitable authority.

His figure, tall and spectral, emanated a unique blend of composure and foreboding, akin to a attractive yet deadly nocturnal predator.

A mantle of ethereal, smoky mist clung to him, giving him a mysterious, otherworldly aura.

His hair, a riotous cascade of ink‚Äîblack strands, flowed freely over his shoulders, glimmering with a celestial sheen that hinted at the unimaginable power he possessed.

His eyes, a pair of clear, shining orbs, were the color of a calm, moonlit lake, flickering with wisdom and understanding that only eternity could impart.

They held a profound depth, as though they had watched over life, death, and everything in between, giving him an air of both world ‚Äîweary experience and youthful curiosity.

As he sat on his throne, Hades exuded an air of peacefulness, a stark contrast to his ominous name...Yet, those who knew him understood that this was a calm born of the resolution, a silent pledge to guard the spirit realm against any disturbance, and therein lay his true might.

"How am I the one causing trouble?" Asna said coldly, "I got kicked out of the eternal kingdom and even sealed by those bastards.

When I have gotten freed and found my soulmate, they came to mess with me again and this time, they even killed my partner."

"You know full well what your existence means to them." Hades said. "They will keep trying their very best to keep you from taking over your duties."

"I never cared about such a thing and if I had a choice, I would have stripped myself from all of my powers." Asna sighed, "At this moment, I really just desire to live a peaceful life with Felix, but they can not even let me have that."

"We‚Äòre unigins, we aren‚Äòt born to have peaceful lives."

"You sure do look peaceful in your mighty throne away from the woes of the living world," Asna stated with an annoyed tone.

Hades merely showed a faint smile for a split second before his serene expression returned...This was his entire reaction to her comment as he did not bother to explain himself or his position.

"I guess you wanted to meet me to revive you and your little mortal?"

Hades switched the subject and this time he used the language of the dead, allowing everyone to understand them.

"Ye..."

"No." Hades rejected her with an indifferent tone, "The answer is no and will always be no."
