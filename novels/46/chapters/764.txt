Chapter 765 - Spinning The Wheel.

Three months later...

Felix had left the Loftus Dust Kingdom after being warned by the Matriarch. Now, he was traveling through the matter universe towards Thor's galaxy.

In the past months, he focused only on learning his conversion technique. Since he was practicing in the real world, his improvement was noteworthy.

Now, he was capable of converting neutral energy into high-tiered poison energy!

The best part, he was capable of filling up his entire elemental tank in less than twenty seconds.

There was still plenty of room to improve, but Felix decided that it was time to make a comeback to the SGPlatform.

He was getting rusty over the years without fights on equal terms...Felix was more worried of losing his sharpness than not being over prepared.

Felix sat down in his usual spot in the living room. He brought out the hologram with the green button.

Just as he tried to press it, Asna came rushing from upstairs, "Wait, you prick! Let me press it this time!"

'F*ck...She woke up.' Felix's eyelids twitched as he watched her approaching him in her furry pajamas with a disgruntled expression.

"Bastard, you woke up at dawn to do it without me." Asna punched him in his waist as she sat next to him.

"I don't trust your luck." Felix said with an annoyed expression, "You must be carrying a mountain of bad karma. I will be a fool to let you click it."

Asna had been killing anyone who entered her prison left and right, trying to find the most compatible soul to hers.

Felix might not be superstitious but when it came to the wheel of games?

He turned into a religious person, who believes in karma, gods, and anything that might affect his pick result.

"How can you say that to me." Asna's eyes reddened a bit, "That was self-defense."

With her cute furry pajamas and breathtaking beauty, the image of her of tearing up would make anyone try to please her.

Alas, this was Felix...

"Stop the water play." Felix pushed her face away in annoyance, "You overused it."

"Tsk, why do you need to be such an ass." Asna pouted while crossing her arms next to him.

Seeing that she was getting upset, Felix decided to compromise a little, "Fine, you do the format, I spin the games wheel."

"Heheh! Gimme gimme." Asna rubbed her hands in eagerness.

Felix pushed the hologram to her and watched her finger approaching the green button with held breaths.

Click!

The colorful wheel emerged and started spinning rapidly as always.

Felix allowed Asna to decide when to stop it. So, they kept staring at it spinning and spinning until Asna finally yelled, "Stop it!"

Ting Ting Ting!...Ting!

-Congratulation on Picking Battle Format!-

"Heh, how dare you insult my luck." Asna snickered arrogantly after landing on one of the most desirable formats to Felix.

"Tsk, beginners luck." Felix refused to acknowledge her.

"Whatever, let's see what you do." Asna pushed the hologram back to Felix.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Without further ado, Felix pressed on the second button and watched the wheel spin again.

Ting Ting Ting!

"Stop!"

The wheel slowed down its speed for a few seconds until it was brought to a halt, leaving its needle placed on a golden-colored board.

-Congratulation on Picking The Game, The Last Executioner!-

Felix and Asna looked to their right and were met with the game's details.

// Game Platform: Universal Individual Supremacy Games.

Game Format: Battle (Battle Royal Edition)

Game Name: The Last Executioner.

Participants Number: 97 (Still increasing)

Rules of the game:

1) All the players will be teleported above a giant circular island.

3) The island is made into five regions. Desert region, volcanic region, forest region, snowy region, and a lake region in the center.

4) Players will be dropped only on four cardinal regions.

5) The game is split into three phases. The map will start getting erased from the edges every fifteen minutes in the first phase. Ten minutes in the second phase and five minutes in the third phase.

6) Each phase is further split into three parts, meaning that the game's longevity is one hour and a half.

7) Players must eliminate the others to survive each part of a phase.

8) Players will get executed by Queen Ai after each part of all three phases if they didn't have the corresponded kills count to that part.

Good luck to all participants.//

"Well, nothing is more straightforward than this." Felix closed the details of the game, already familiar with this concept.

The Last Executioner was a popular game that was always accompanied by a terrific number of viewers.

After all, a battle royal was already a brutal design for a game that enforced the survival of only one player.

But, The Last Executioner? The design motivated the players into seeking kills no matter what.

There was no such a thing as camping at the edges of the map while the others kill each other.

Everyone was forced to hunt from the get go since Queen Ai would execute the passive ones.

The 5th and 8th rule had made it crystal clear how would that get carried out.

"So, you need to always have an addition kill every time the map shrunk." Asna pondered, "This concept will ensure that at least half of the players get eliminated in the first fifteen minutes."

"Indeed." Felix nodded with a solemn expression.

Fifty diamond ranked players getting eliminated in fifty minutes might seem abnormal...Especially, when the platinum games had at most thirty player participating.

Logically, the numbers of players should have actually shrunken...But it wasn't the case in diamond ranked games.

That's because the top twenty battle oriented races in the universe had most of their players in diamond rank!

For example, dragons were almost extinct in platinum and below ranked games.

That's because the moment they join the platform, they get placed in platnuim ranked games.

Three wins or such, and they would already be placed in diamond rank.

Such a treatment wasn't given to all races, but the top twenty races were still capable of reaching diamond rank effortlessly.

Gold and Platnuim were home for most orcs, giants, werewolves, vampires, and many marine-based races…etc.

Now, Felix was finally going to join the peak games in the universe, where only the strongest of the strongest were allowed to participate!

Throughout the history of the human race, only four origin bloodliners made it to diamond rank...Luck played a massive role in their climb and when they reached the diamond rank, none of them dared to play a single game.

They were satisfied by simply reaching the diamond gates and watching the games from the outside.

Yet, those four bloodliners were glorified in the galaxy and were called The Great Four.

It was sad, shameful, and quite pathetic for a whole race to take pride in four bloodliners, who merely reached the gate.

But it is what it is, they did their absolute best with the strength given to them.

Even Felix never disrespected them...How could he do so when he wasn't able to climb past gold in his previous life?

He knew what they did could be considered as a miracle, and he would have never done the same even if given the same resources as them.

Now?

Felix could be truly considered as the first human to play a diamond ranked game...If he brought it home, humans could finally be given a proper celebration.

Though, Felix knew that wasn't going to be easy.

'Let's see my competitors.'

Felix waved the game's hologram to the side and clicked on the participants' list.

>The Sleeper_8779(Heavenly Turtle Race): Diamond, High-Tier, Wins 6/ Losses 0. (For more details click on the name)

>BloodCoral_9987(Vampire Race): Diamond, Mid-Tier, Wins 15 / Losses 4. (For more details click on the name)

>Exodial_275(Red Dragon Race): Platnuim Rank, Peak-Tier, Wins 3 / Losses 0. (For...)

>Wild Night_3429(Night Elf Race): Diamond Rank, High-Tier, Wins 17 / Losses 3 (For...)

..

>Unpaid Landlord_6996(Human Race): Platnuim Rank, High-Tier, Wins 9 / Losses 0. (For...)

>Bee Colony Official N145(Hive Race): Diamond Rank, Mid-Tier, Wins 18 / Losses 4. (For...)//

The moment Felix noticed three golden glowing names, he felt his chest tighten up in excitement and agitation.

However, when he saw Astra Race, his excitement was quenched a little.

That's because the Astra Race were one of the few gravity Elementalists in the universe!

By now, It was a known fact that the Gravity Primogenitor Saurous was part of the Darkin Faction!

"Manananggal's champion and Saurous's champion." Thor knitted his eyebrows, "You better be prepared to get teamed up against."
