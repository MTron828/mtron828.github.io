Chapter 1632 Free of The Three Rulers' Control.

1632 Free of The Three Rulers' Control.

The elemental manipulations could be bestowed back without much trouble since they were etched on the soul first then the body.

But for the rest? He had to do some mind/physical gymnastics to remove them while at the same time minimizing the damage.

So, he relied on his greed laws.

"Show me the most effective method to remove all abilities, immunities, the runic heart, and every trace of the rulers' influence from my body and system."

The air around him thickened as the draconic fox's eyes glowed with a green color before the symbol manifested in its eyes.

Then, images and knowledge began to flood Felix's mind, a stream of insights and methods meticulously tailored to his unique situation.

The greed law, drawing upon the vast reservoir of knowledge it possessed, presented Felix with a comprehensive and intricate plan.

It detailed a step-by-step process, each stage designed to carefully and systematically extract the remnants of the rulers' gifts, ensuring almost no harm would come to his being.

The method was complex, involving a series of genetic modifications performed with precision and focus.

As the vision faded and the room returned to normal, Felix took a deep breath, steadying himself.

"If I followed this path, I would lose close to a four million BF or more. It's almost the exact amount of power I had before I ascended." Felix smiled bitterly, "I am about to remove strength corresponding to my previous peak, yet it feels like I am losing pennies and nickels." Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Even if Felix miscalculated and lost five million BF, he would still be left with twenty-four million BF.

A level of strength and power that wouldn't be affected in the slightest with such a small power loss.

For unigins, unless there was a twenty million BF difference and above, their battles would always be somewhat equal.

"It's expected, gods can't be compared to us or mortals," Thor uttered.

Even when primogenitors called themselves deities, they knew deep down that applied to only mortals below them.

The true deities weren't even part of the same universe as them, overlooking and controlling everything without showing themselves.

Knowing that such a comparison would just affect the mood, Felix dropped the subject and delved into a trance-like state.

As a unigin, he might not have the powers to morph his body completely without consequences, but he possessed the capability to change his DNA through a mere will.

He visualized the unwinding of these connections, each ability appearing to him as a strand of light interwoven with his being.

Methodically, he detached each strand, the process requiring intense focus...As each ability was released, he felt a corresponding shift in his body ‚Äì a lightening of his being.

Next, he addressed the elemental immunities.

With each immunity he focused on, Felix felt a part of him that had once been invulnerable become mortal again, a sensation both liberating and daunting.

The air around him seemed to ripple with each release as if the very atmosphere of the chamber was responding to the change.

The most challenging part was the extraction of the runic heart. Usually, surgery was required for such a thing.

But, Felix simplyplaced his hands over his chest, feeling for the pulsing energy of the runic heart.

Slowly, he began to draw it out, a process met with resistance as the heart had become an integral part of him with runic veins connected to every part of his existence.

He could have used the greed sins for this step, but Felix wanted to practice his new control over his body.

Sweat beaded on his forehead as he carefully navigated the heart and the veins through the layers of his being.

Fortunately, the runic heart wasn't as integrated as the Kraken's heart or the dragon's heart. It simply provided Felix with runic manipulation instead of an internal shift.

Slowly, but surely, Felix's hand pulled the runic seed from his chest, unbothered by the untangled thousands of green vines and the blood pouring down his chest.

As the runic heart left his body, a wave of exhaustion washed over him, but also a profound sense of release.

The moment he was done, his chest wound closed up and the runic's heart's original place had a new dormant Kraken's heart replace it and fix all the damage done internally.

As Felix continued with the procedure, his seven draconic tails fell victim to the sudden changes to his DNA coding.

They didn't disappear, but their appearance began to change a bit.

The scales, a camouflage mutation from Lord Loki's influence, gradually receded, revealing their true form beneath ‚Äì smoother, less armored, but still formidable.

The tails themselves seemed to lose some of their ethereal quality and crystalized appearance, becoming more tangible, more a part of the physical world.

Even Felix humane's form suffered as he had lost his wisdom eyes and truth eyes, causing his pupils to change from triangles to circular again.

It was expected as Felix had freed his body of all of his immunites and abilities, which were connected to many of his mutations.

Even if they weren't, getting rid of the small percentage of his tenants' bloodlines would cause his body to remove them too.

Fortunately, Kraken's seven-heart mutation wasn't affected since Felix went all out and integrated with more than 20% of his bloodline, causing it to have a bigger and integral presence.

As the final step concluded, Felix opened his eyes.

He felt different ‚Äì not diminished but distilled. He had returned to a version of himself unmarked by external influences, a canvas reset to its original state.

"I feel renewed instead of weakened," Felix uttered with a faint comfortable smile.

"You should, you haven't gone through a tangible transformation but a reclamation of your identity." Lady Sphinx uttered calmly.

"If it wasn't for the universal chains, you would have felt completely free," Thor mentioned.

"No wonder Asna saught her freedom so bad. There is nothing more rewarding to know that nothing and no one hold authority over you." Felix smiled coldly, "But no need to rush, I have gotten rid of the three rulers' authority over me...The universe will be next."

***

For the next couple of days, Felix continued to familiarize himself with his transformed state post-ascension...He made a couple of intriguing findings about the sin laws he wielded.

Firstly, he had opened the full range of sin symbols now that he was its true guardian.

Secondly, each sin law, when actively used, granted him the gift to alter his appearance in a way that reflected the essence of that particular sin.

This newfound gift piqued his curiosity, leading him to experiment with the various sin laws, watching as his form subtly shifted with each change.

He noticed that when he invoked the Wrath sin law, his hair took on a fiery hue, echoing of smoldering embers, while his eyes glowed with an intense, passionate light.

Intrigued, Felix explored further and found that with the Lust sin law, his features became more alluring, with an almost hypnotic charm.

Each sin law brought with it a distinct aesthetic change, echoing the nature of the sin it represented.

However, Felix felt a certain comfort and identity with his original red hair, a trait that had become a part of who he was.

Deciding to embrace this aspect of himself, he concentrated on the Wrath sin law, not just invoking it momentarily, but weaving it into his being.

He cut his long, white hair, reducing it to a length he was more accustomed to, and willed it to turn into the familiar shade of red.

His eyes, too, he altered to match, shifting them to a deep, vibrant red that mirrored the intensity of his hair.

This change in appearance extended beyond just Felix himself.

The seven draconic tails, ever responsive to his will and state, transformed as well.

Each tail, previously bearing its unique color and aura, now shimmered with shades of red, aligning with Felix's chosen appearance.

The tails seemed to take on a more unified and harmonious look, their red hues a striking contrast against their surroundings.

Only then was Felix genuinely comfortable with his appearance.

Just as Felix was planning to continue his preparations, he felt a sudden connection with his soul get established with another being from afar.

He immediately realized what the situation was about.

"Nimo, he has hatched at la...Wait, why does his spiritual form seem different than a raccoon...Don't tell me..."

Felix gulped a mouthful after sensing the new shape of Nimo's soul.
