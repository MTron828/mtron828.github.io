Chapter 1635 A Warm Welcome! II

1635 A Warm Welcome! II

A few moments before Hephaestus made his move, Felix and his people could be seen stepping into a realm that transcended their wildest imaginations.

The interior of the Eternal Kingdom unfolded before them, a vast expanse of endless surface that stretched beyond the horizon, its beauty leaving them awestruck.

The ground beneath their feet was like none they had ever seen, shimmering with a lustrous sheen, reflecting the golden light that bathed the entire landscape.

Above them, the sky was a magnificent canvas of deep gold, with clouds of a soft yellow hue drifting leisurely across it.

The entire atmosphere was imbued with a sense of timelessness and purity, an eternal day in a realm untouched by the ordinary passage of time.

The air they breathed was unlike anything they had experienced before; it was so pure and refreshing that it seemed to cleanse their very beings.

As they took deep breaths, they could feel their pores opening up, as if their bodies were willingly embracing the rejuvenating qualities of this divine air.

Everywhere they looked, the Eternal Kingdom radiated a sense of sublime majesty and peace.

"Are we on a planet? I thought the eternal kingdom would be a massive patch of space." Arthur inquired as he looked around him in wonder, "How can unigins even be contained with a mere planet?"

"It's not a planet," Felix replied while shrinking back to his normal size, "It's called the eternal kingdom for a reason. It's an infinite surface area, stretching for eternity since it keeps growing daily. As for the day and night cycle? It's unified and under the light and darkness ungi..."

Before Felix could finish his sentence, his acute senses detected an impending threat, approaching them from a distance at an alarming speed.

When he focused on his senses' direction, his eyes picked up a glowing disturbed, and shaky golden sphere.

Felix felt his hair rise across his entire body after sensing the potent and terrifying force held within the sphere!

"Get Down!!"

Felix's reaction was immediate and decisive, he raised his hand to signal his people to brace for impact while he conjured a massive, thick barrier of void energy around his people!!

The barrier materialized as a dark, opaque dome, enveloping them in a protective embrace.

Its surface rippled with the strength of the void, absorbing and nullifying the ambient light, standing as a bulwark against the incoming celestial missile!

Yet, Felix knew that it wasn't enough to even block 50% of the star core!

So, Felix propelled himself forward, propelling with a speed and grace that belied his size.

He positioned himself between the incoming star core and his people and uttered coldly, "Untouchable Will Symbol." T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

With a surge of energy, a roaring lion symbol materialized above his head, its majestic form radiating a sense of indomitable strength!

The symbol fed Felix with a prideful belief, a conviction that he was impervious to harm, infusing him with an aura of invincibility!

Felix's body began to glow with a resplendent golden light, embodying the essence of the pride sin.

His muscles tensed, and with a calculated grace, he drew his fist back, channeling the accumulated energy into his arm.

Then, with a movement that combined precision and power, he thrust his fist forward, striking the star core directly at its heart!!

The impact was monumental.

The star core struck with such force, veered off its destructive path, careening away into the sky.

As it flew, its form began to warp and deform under the strain of Felix's pride-infused punch!

The core's energy destabilized, growing brighter and more erratic with each passing moment until it reached a critical point.

Then, in a spectacular display of cosmic power, the star's core went supernova!

The explosion was a cataclysmic event, a burst of energy that radiated outwards with devastating intensity.

The brilliant glow of the supernova illuminated a great distance of the Eternal Kingdom, its shockwaves powerful enough to uproot billions of kilometers of the divine terrain, tearing through the fabric of the realm with an unstoppable force!!!

"Argh!!!"

"What the hell!"

"Is the universe collapsing?!"

Candace and the rest of the void citizens were rocked inside the void dome as they felt like their beings were about to get ripped apart from mere vibration!!

If it wasn't for Felix strengthening the void barrier to the point, that void particles were disintegrating the supernova particles mid-

explosion, they wouldn't even be around to complain!

Meanwhile,The roaring lion symbol above Felix's head seemed to fuel him with an endless supply of power, making him resemble an untouchable god amidst the fierceness of the supernova!

However, Felix knew that his invulnerability wouldn't last for long since the symbol was based on his genuine prideful belief that no one and nothing could hurt him.

Felix couldn't fake it even if he wanted as he knew that many things could still harm him...So, the symbol got weaker and weaker until Felix started to feel the burn of the supernova, eating his flesh.

Instead of waiting for his body to turn into a toast, Felix utilized gluttony laws, Hunger symbol.

The instant the symbol manifested above him, the terrific overbearing energy released from the explosion began to feed into Felix's being, empowering him and enhancing his defenses at an unfathomable rate!

Then, he stared into the distance, through the blinding white flash of the supernova, and noticed Hephaestus.

He was standing in the atmosphere with crossed arms, unaffected in the slightest by the explosion. He was gazing at him with a tint of animosity and irritation.

'Such annoying powers, we got rid of them with that b*tch and this brat brought them back again.' He cursed with a cold tone as he waved his hand to the side.

Immediately after, the supernova explosion came to an abrupt halt and began to fade away even when it still hadn't even reached its peak!

As the guardian of fire/magma/plasma and anything related to a main source of heat, he was the only one able to go against the laws of physics and reality when it comes to those related laws!

After the supernova faded away, it exposed a never-before-seen level of destruction that made the void citizens feel chills course down their spine.

The divine and peaceful eternal kingdom around them was no more, replaced by an infinite expanse of vacuumed space!

The only thing left untouched was the golden gate behind them...Everything else was utterly deleted.

Yet, before they could even break out of their initial shock, something unexpected and astonishing happened!

The landscape once uprooted and torn asunder by the cataclysmic forces, started to reform as if by magic, manifesting anew from the very ether!

Solid and lush landscapes emerged from thin air, seamlessly knitting themselves back together, erasing the scars of destruction.

Above, the sky, which had been darkened and torn by the supernova's wrath, healed itself, returning to its former state of golden serenity.

The clouds, once dispersed by the shockwaves, reappeared, drifting lazily across the rejuvenated sky.

The atmosphere, previously agitated and stripped away, settled back into place, filling the realm with its pure and refreshing essence.

Even the light, extinguished momentarily by the explosion, flickered back to life, bathing the Eternal Kingdom in its warm, radiant glow!

It was as if time had been reversed, every element working in harmonious synchrony to restore the realm to its original splendor.

In mere moments, the environment returned to its pristine condition, showing no trace of the explosive event that had transpired...

"What the..."

"How..."

"What the hell is this place..."

The Void Nation citizens felt like they were living in a dream as they watched everything happen before their own eyes through the void barrier.

As for Felix and the rest of the tenants? They were already informed about this, but still, seeing it happen was nowhere as shocking as hearing about it.

But, Felix had no time to focus on the eternal kingdom's miracles...His cold eyes remained affixed on Hephaestus, who was approaching him with a composed expression.

"Bold of you to be waiting for me here. Aren't you afraid that Poseidon will take advantage of your absence and conquer more of your Fire Domain?" Felix asked while brainstorming the best way to handle this situation.

Even if his people weren't with him, Felix wouldn't consider committing to a fight.

It would be a foolish thing to do when he knew that his entry must have alerted all unigins in the kingdom!
