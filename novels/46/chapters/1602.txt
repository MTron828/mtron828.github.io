Chapter 1603 All Out! II

1603 All Out! II

Nimo's alter ego spoke with a disgusted tone as he kept raining down empowered punches at Felix, beating him senselessly.

In his eyes, it would take just a bit more time to finish off Felix without his symbols' effects since he was getting stronger and stronger with each second passing!

"Die! Die! Die already, you cockroach!"

Nimo's alter ego cursed as he hurled him into the air with a powerful uppercut, only for the envy form to catch him mid-fall and slam him back against a massive water beast with a thunderous blow!

However, Felix didn't suffer the whole amount of damage as his passive absorbed most of the force while another significant portion got eaten by Foremother Siamese's metallic shield!

'I am with you, Felix, don't you dare give up!'

Foremother Siamese yelled in Felix's mind as she worked tirelessly to protect him with all types of barriers and shields.

After witnessing Nimo's alter ego's overwhelming strength and dreadful personality, she knew that her fate wouldn't end well if he managed to walk away from them.

Alas, her support wasn't really that optimal as her abilities ended up not reaching their ultimate form due to the Origin/Hunger Symbols, absorbing neutral energy constantly and breaking apart her abilities.

While Foremother Siamese was the goddess of this galaxy, she was still a rank lower than Nimo, which meant, that his symbol effects would always override her abilities!

Because of this, Nimo's alter ego didn't bother investing any time in her and continued putting everything he had on Felix. F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Whoosh!! Whoosh!! Booom!! Booom!!!...

As the beating continued, Felix's body became a canvas of bruises and wounds...Blood seeped from multiple injuries, staining the ocean beneath him.

With each successive hit, his body glowed brighter and brighter, a visible sign of the force being absorbed into the cracks of his skin.

Alas, Felix didn't have an ounce of energy to lift a finger as he felt like his entire body was put into a meat grinder, don't even mention retaliating back.

His body was indestructible alright, but this indestructibility didn't mean that he couldn't get injured or harmed...It just meant that his body would always remain intact regardless of the force it went through.

In other words, Felix could die purely from pain even if his body was still intact since his soul and mind didn't enjoy the same immunity!

Meanwhile, the tenants, witnessing this brutal scene, were overcome with a mix of anger, frustration, and hopelessness.

They watched as their child was battered and beaten, feeling each hit as if it were their own.

Their fists clenched, their jaws tightened, and their eyes burned with a mix of rage and sorrow.

'Forgive me, son, forgive me for being weak...' J?rmungandr said with a rough voice.

'It tears at my soul to see him like this...' Thor pulled his fists until blood seeped out of his palms.

'...'

Lady Sphinx merely closed her eyes and remained silent, listening to her student's muffled anguished groans, and the soft cracks of his soul barrier, implying his incoming damnation.

The majority of the tenants were unable to do anything else but listen and watch. Everyone expected the battle to be difficult, to be tough, to be extremely challenging for Felix, but none of them were ready for the scene before them...

Most of them wanted nothing more than to rush into the fray, to stand by Felix and fight off the onslaught...But the reality of their situation held them back.

They knew that intervening could potentially make things worse or even lead to their downfall since Nimo's alter ego could easily capture them with his spiritual pressure and use them as hostages.

'Felix, there is only 20% left...You can do it, you can...do...Sob,..it.' Candace wept as she encouraged him...Alas, If only she believed in her own words as her expression was that of utter despair.

She knew, no, they knew, that 20% meant that Felix still had to endure at least ten more seconds of this horrific slaughter.

Ten seconds in this battle was like ten hours...

Meanwhile, Felix didn't hear anything they said as his mind was completely shut off and his consciousness flickered in and out with the ebb and flow of pain, barely holding it in...

Each punch, each kick, sent waves of agony through him, threatening to pull him under into darkness...But amidst this torture, images of Asna and Nimo appeared before his eyes.

'As...na...I'm...co..ming...I...pro...mised...I...pro...mised...her...'

These images served as anchors, pulling him back from the brink of unconsciousness. Asna's face, a reminder of love and the life they've shared instilled him with resolve.

Nimo's face jumped in once in a while in his mind with his cute squealing and always excited attitude.

They were the beacons in his storm of pain, the reasons he refused to succumb...How could he after both of them willingly gave themselves for his sake?

They had already shown him their indomitable loyalty and untouched love...It was his time to demonstrate his own.

...

Meanwhile, deep within the tranquil expanse of an ancient forest, far removed from the chaos and tumult of the battlefield, sat a small, cozy house.

It was a place of solitude and peace, nestled among towering trees and whispering leaves. Here resided Lord Zurvan whose very presence seemed to resonate with the timeless nature of the woods around him.

Inside, Lord Zurvan sat in a comfortable chair, his gaze turned towards the sky visible through a nearby window...His eyes, deep and knowing, glittered with the accumulated wisdom of eons and the ability to see far beyond the ordinary.

As he stared into the sky, a wry grin played on his lips. He was a solitary figure, yet there was a sense of connection about him as if he was attuned to events and emotions far from his tranquil abode.

In a soft, reflective voice, he spoke, his words carrying the weight of understanding and a touch of melancholy.

"The things you do for love, the things we do to not be lonely," he mused, his voice barely louder than a whisper. "I wish that the path you have chosen was a bit easier, Felix, but alas..."

Lord Zurvan's words trailed off as he continued to gaze skyward. His expression was one of empathy and a deep, almost parental concern.

He understood the trials and tribulations that come with the paths chosen for love and companionship, the sacrifices made, and the loneliness that beings like himself often endured.

At this moment, Lord Zurvan seemed to be both a distant observer and a deeply connected participant in the events unfolding far away...

...

Meanwhile, with muddled disorientated blood filled eyes, Felix was also staring at the sky high above after getting smashed from the back.

At that moment, Asna and Nimo's faces appeared on the clouds.

'I..wo...n't..le..t.y.ou...d...own.'

The instant he saw them, a tiny grin manifested on his shattered and bruised face.

It wasn't a grin of joy or victory, but one of resilience, a silent testament to his unyielding spirit and determination to survive this at all cost.

"He smiled...You smiled?"

Nimo's alter ego caught sight of this unexpected smile, and it struck a deep and infuriating chord within him. His eyes blazed with an unhinged rage, the sight of Felix's grin acting as a catalyst for his already simmering anger.

To him, it was not just a smile; it was a symbol of his failure to break Felix, a mockery of his efforts, and an unbearable affront to his ego as a GOD!

And thus, he finally snapped...
