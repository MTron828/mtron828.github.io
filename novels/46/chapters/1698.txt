Chapter 1699 The Last Dance. VII

1699 The Last Dance. VII

Meanwhile, Uranus materialized in the vast expanse of outer space, coalescing from dark, nearly invisible particles into a formidable presence.

'Hmm?'

His senses, finely attuned to the cosmic ballet, picked up distant, faint shockwaves, unmistakable signatures of destruction.

With a deep, intrinsic understanding, he acknowledged these forces at play.

'It must be the third ruler unleashing havoc upon the dream realm.'

A cold, determined expression etched itself upon his face as he set off towards the source of the turmoil, his movements swift and decisive!

'I hope he leaves something for me.'

Even though Uranus knew that Felix's fate was sealed the instant one of the three rulers made their move personally, he still wanted to give him a piece of his mind after all the mess he put the kingdom through.

After disappearing into the cold empty void, two pitch-black eyes suddenly appeared from the nothingness behind him, their gaze piercing through the fabric of space itself before vanishing as quickly as they had appeared...

Space soon returned to its peaceful state, unlike the chaos arising in the dream realm.

...

'Dreamrealm, I invoke The Godhood Ritual!'

With each word spoken, the realm's very fabric began to dissolve, dreams of countless beings converging toward Felix in a maelstrom of ethereal energy.

In the void realm, the citizens were gripped by an unseen torment, their faces twisted in agony.

This collective suffering stemmed from an inexplicable source, yet its effects were palpable across the realm...Each individual, regardless of their strength or stature, found themselves caught in a maelstrom of pain, a byproduct of the ritual unfolding far beyond their reach or comprehension.

Simultaneously, The Dreamers underwent a startling transformation. Once vast and vibrant, these beings began to shrink, their sizes diminishing rapidly!

This contraction was not a natural phenomenon but a consequence of their dreams being siphoned away.

The dreams, a vital aspect of their existence, were being harvested to fuel a godhood ritual, leaving the dreamers lessened, a mere shadow of their former selves.

This scene of sacrifice and loss underscored the profound and far-

reaching impact of the ritual and why Felix didn't consider going for it until his back was against the wall.

He comprehended that the ritual would be hard and painful for his citizens, but he didn't hesitate to invoke it as his life and death were connected to theirs.

If he died, they would follow him next!

Whoosh!!! Whoosh!...

Their collective hopes, fears, and fantasies swirled around him, a torrent of power that sought to reshape reality itself!

Felix's body, battered and bruised from the ordeal with Amun-Ra, began to mend under the overwhelming force of the ritual.

Wounds sealed, blood receded, and his form elevated to an apex condition, untouched by mortal frailty!

His crimson hair, a mark of his trials and tribulations, cascaded down his back, growing in length and radiance until it shimmered with an inner light, each strand a testament to his indomitable spirit.

From his gaze, twin beams of piercing light erupted, illuminating the dark sky left by the dream realm's dissolution!

Roaar!! Rooar!! Roarr!...

At his command, the seven hydra tails emerged not as separate entities but as a singular, majestic armor.

Scales, vibrant and colorful, each embedded with a dragonic eye, wrapped around Felix's form.

This living armor provided him not just with unparalleled protection but with a sensory network that extended beyond the physical, granting him the awareness that bordered on omniscience within his domain!

As the ritual reached its zenith, the dream realm itself seemed to acknowledge Felix's transcendence.

The remnants of the realm, now a canvas for his will, responded to his slightest desire, breathing with him, living with him, and dying with him!

Thud!

Felix rose to his feet, his hand firmly planted on his knee as he lowered his head, undaunted by Amun-Ra's unimpressed expression.

"The Godhood Ritual, one of Lilith's most profound and forbidden techniques." Amun-Ra remarked calmly, "Boy, do you understand the consequences of your actions?"

"When enslavement is the only option I have left, it doesn't sound so bad to risk my life for one last try at beating you senseless," Felix replied with a cold sinister look as he slowly lifted his head to match Amun-Ra's gaze.

"How dillusio..."

Before Amun-Ra could finish his sentence, Felix launched a swift punch toward Amun-Ra's face, a blow so powerful that it threatened to unravel the fabric of reality itself!

However, Amun-Ra, with his divine reflexes, caught Felix's fist effortlessly in his palm.

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

The force of the impact didn't harm him, but the space behind him was obliterated, leaving a void where existence itself seemed to have been erased.

"If that's all you have," Amun-Ra remarked, his voice echoing with disdain, unfazed by the attempt on his divine visage.

"I am just starting."

Refusing to be belittled, Felix opened his clenched fist, unleashing a concentrated beam of void energy straight at Amun-Ra's face!

'Remove Immunites!'

In the same breath, he revoked the immunity to elemental forces from all beings within his realm, including himself, making them vulnerable to the raw essence of their powers!

The beam struck true, causing Amun-Ra to flinch slightly, a sensation of discomfort marking his divine features for the first time.

The touch of pain, however fleeting, did not sit well with the deity.

With a slight grimace marring his otherwise perfect features, Amun-

Ra's skin showed signs of disintegration where the void beam had made contact, a testament to the potency of Felix's attack!

"It seems like you won't go down without a fight...Fine, I will entertain you."

In retaliation, Amun-Ra, now slightly angered by the affront, lowered his Was scepter with a swift motion and struck Felix with it, sending him flying across the dream realm with such force that the very air trembled in his wake!

As Felix was propelled away by Amun-Ra's divine strike, his armor, shimmering with the essence of the seven hydra tails, miraculously began to mend itself!

ROOOOARR!! ROOOAR!!!

In a breathtaking spectacle of resilience, two dragonic maws emerged from the chest of his armor, their emergence accompanied by deep, resounding roars that seemed to vibrate through the very core of the dream realm!

These maws unleashed two streams of energy, one of concentrated plasma and the other of void, which intertwined in a deadly dance to form a deep purple beam of unprecedented power!!

Amun-Ra, witnessing this new threat, aimed his Was scepter at the incoming beam, intending to counter it with a blast of his own combined elemental forces.

'Cancel elemental energies!'

But Felix, in a strategic maneuver, nullified all elemental energies within his realm besides the ones in his command, rendering the scepter impotent!

The scepter, now unable to summon its usual divine barrage, released nothing but the faintest wisp of energy, a stark contrast to its wielder's expectations.

With a sigh of irritation, Amun-Ra executed a swift sidestep, narrowly avoiding the beam without much trouble.

Even when this was the first time Felix had made the third ruler dodge his attack, he didn't spend a single nanosecond feeling good about himself.

"BEND!"

With Felix's newfound godhood granting him dominion over reality itself, he seized a moment of audacity to control the physics of his own realm!

With a mere thought, he bent the trajectory of the concentrated beam, a feat deemed impossible beyond the borders of this realm.

The beam, infused with plasma and void energies, twisted and snapped back like a rubber band, aiming directly at Amun-Ra!!

The deity, with a grace that belied his immense power, evaded the redirected assault, his hands clasped casually behind his back, an image of unperturbed calm in the face of chaos.

Amun-Ra's evasion, however, was but the prelude to Felix's masterstroke.

"INIFNITEY MIRROR!"

Tapping into the depths of his sin-symbolic techniques, Felix invoked a potent ability that mirrored and multiplied the active capabilities within his vicinity! T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

From the hundreds of black sigils that appeared in the air, a barrage of beams, identical to the original in form and fury, rained down upon Amun-Ra!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!..

This onslaught forced the deity into continuous motion, a dance of divine agility as he navigated the relentless tide of attacks.

Each beam sought Amun-Ra with unyielding persistence, turning the dream realm into a battlefield of light and shadows.

For the first time, Amun-Ra found himself on the defensive side of the battle. Yet, Felix still did not stop his onslaughter as he charged personally into the fray with Hephaestus's divine hammer in both hands.

'It's not enough...It's not enough, he can still get to me if I decide to escape through a void portal!'

While Felix seemed like he was on the winning side, he comprehended that Amun-Ra was simply waiting for the Godhood transformation to end before making his move in peace.

That's because the Godhood ritual was fueled by the dreams of the residents and the moment their minds would crack, and there would be no more dreams to harvest, the dream realm would self-explode automatically!

This would cause Felix to receive a potent backlash since the dreamrealm was connected to his soul and its explosion was the same as a direct strike on it!

The moment that happened, he would be left in the open of the eternal kingdom to fend for himself against the third ruler.

This time he would have his divinities, connection to celestial energy, and elemental control...In other words, Felix would be done for and no one would be able to save him.

Thus, he had to create the greatest chance to escape, a chance that not even Amun-Ra would be able to predict or stop!
