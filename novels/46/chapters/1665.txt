Chapter 1666 Exploring The True Potential of Seven The Sins Laws. II

1666 Exploring The True Potential of Seven The Sins Laws. II

A couple of days later...Inside a castle made out of the world eater's symbiotic skin, Felix could be seen sitting on the floor of his throne chamber.

He had his eyes closed, delving deep into the concept of greed, contemplating its multifaceted nature.

He recognized greed as a force that drove beings to amass power, wealth, and resources beyond their needs, often at the expense of others. Yet, he also considered greed's potential to inspire ambition, motivation, and the pursuit of excellence.

"The duality of greed," Felix murmured, "it's a source of destruction, yet also a catalyst for growth and achievement."

This dichotomy, the destructive and constructive faces of greed, became the foundation of his meditations in the past days.

Hours passed as Felix remained in deep contemplation, his mind weaving through the intricate tapestry of desire that greed represented.

Slowly, an idea began to crystallize, an insight into how greed could be harnessed in a new, controlled manner.

"I'll call it the Avarice Amplifier Symbol," Felix decided, his voice echoing softly in the throne chamber.

The symbol he envisioned would embody the dual nature of greed, enhancing the user's abilities by amplifying their desire for power!

However, this amplification would come with a caveat; it would require the user to consciously balance their ambition with the risk of being consumed by their greed.

In a sense, it was a perfect symbol, with the right limitations to allow the universe to permit its existence.

After all, without the universe's approval, new symbols couldn't be added. ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

"The symbol won't only boost my strength, speed, or capabilities in proportion to my greed but also test my ability to manage the intensified desires it invoked," Felix remarked.

In other words, the greater the user's ambition, the more significant the enhancement, but succumbing to greed's destructive aspect could lead to a loss of control, making the symbol a double-edged sword.

With the concept fully formed in his mind, Felix began the intricate process of manifesting the symbol...He was already taught the process by Lilith.

He extended his hands, focusing his energy and intent on the space before him.

Slowly, a glowing greed fox sigil began to take shape, its lines and curves swirling into existence, embodying the essence of greed's potential and peril.

As the Avarice Amplifier Symbol solidified, Felix felt a surge of satisfaction.

He had not only created a new sin symbol but also encapsulated a fundamental truth of existence within it, the balance between ambition and restraint, the fine line between achieving greatness and falling into ruin!

"You did it?" Thor raised an eyebrow in surprise, "Wasn't it a bit too easy?"

"It was never hard in the first place." Lady Sphinx replied calmly, "All he needs is a logical concept that utilizes his laws' and the universe's approval. With those two conditions, a new symbol would come to life."

"Ignore him, he is just used to how difficult it was for us to create every single damn ability." J?rmungandr chuckled with a bitter look.

The difference was indeed a bit too much, but it was understandable...Unigins operated in a different field than primogenitors when it came to manipulation.

How could the owners of laws be taught anything or struggle to learn or master something? As long as the conditions were fulfilled for the creation of their abilities, they would come to life.

Nothing more, nothing less...

"Good symbol, unfortunately, I have already invented a replica, which I call, Insatiable Infusion Symbol," Lilith called out lazily.

"Tsk." Felix clicked his tongue in annoyance.

He already anticipated that Lilith would have created the same symbol since it wasn't really that complex or unique.

Still, he dreaded the thought of her creating every possible and known symbol in existence, making it an impossible mission to invent something new.

Ka-thumb!!

Suddenly, with a wide smile, Nimo kicked open the door to the throne chamber.

"Daddy! I want play!"

"Little god, you can't disturb the lord's work!"

The Ruiner came chasing after Nimo with an exhausted expression like he would rather deal with an army of ten thousand royal dragons than handle Nimo.

"It's alright, Ruiner," Felix said with a faint smile as he caught Nimo in his embrace.

"My apologies, my lord, I have tried my best to teach him combat, but he refuses to stay still in one place." The Ruiner sighed, "You already know we can't force him or resist his commands."

"Why were you making trouble?" Felix gave Nimo a scolding look.

Felix had assigned The Ruiner to teach Nimo early after he realized that he was growing a bit too fast and was losing control over his strength.

Just yesterday, he beat up two void citizens to a pulp after they were assigned as play dates.

Yet, because Nimo was considered born out of his soul, he also possessed god-like domination over the void citizens, which he abused to get out of his classes.

"I want play with you..." Nimo said with a sorrowful soft voice.

"Is that so?" Felix's tone softened a bit.

If he wasn't in the process of recovering his soul to its peak, he would have created a clone and used it to spend some quality time with Nimo while he was working on other matters.

But, he couldn't do this for quite a while and Felix didn't want to shut himself from Nimo, knowing that no one could handle him but him.

'I can do both.'

"Alright, let's play." Felix ordered, "Ruiner, you may leave."

The Ruiner bowed his head and took off swiftly like he was scared Felix would change his mind.

"Nimo, ready yourself," Felix instructed as he threw Nimo away from him, his voice firm yet encouraging.

Nimo did a backflip and landed on the ground, resembling a miniature version of Felix with his curious eyes and determined stance.

"Ready, Daddy!"

He nodded vigorously, his tiny fists raised in readiness.

Whoosh!! Whoosh!!

As they began to move, Felix's movements were deliberate, each strike and maneuver designed to test Nimo's reflexes and adaptability.

Nimo, for his part, was eager, trying to mimic Felix's techniques with varying degrees of success, his youthful exuberance making up for his lack of finesse.

Still, between the exchanges, Felix's mind wandered to the new symbol he had created.

Thud!! Boom!! Thud!!

Right now, each block and counter he executed was mirrored by thoughts on how the symbol's power could be both an incredible asset and a formidable challenge to its wielder.

Felix decided to use it as a learning lesson for Nimo as he wanted to shape his personality the opposite of Lilith's.

"Nimo, greed can drive us to surpass our limits," Felix mused aloud, "but unchecked, it can also lead us to our downfall."

Nimo, panting slightly from the effort, paused to consider Felix's words.

"Like fighting?" He asked, tilting his head in confusion. "You know when push and when hold back?"

Felix smiled, impressed by Nimo's quick grasp of the concept.

"Exactly," He replied, launching a gentle offensive that Nimo managed to dodge with surprising agility. "In combat and inside wielding the sins, balance is key. You must always be aware of your desires, channeling them to empower you without letting them take control."

As the spar continued, Felix subtly incorporated a varying intensity of his attacks to simulate Nimo's growth.

He found out before that Nimo was capable of utilizing both the seven sins laws plus void laws as long as he was taught how.

In this spar, Felix tried his best to teach him the new symbol he had created, by either incorporating the concept or utilizing it in front of him.

Nimo, absorbing every lesson, started to understand not merely the physical aspects of combat but too the deeper implications of wielding power responsibly.

After multiple attempts, even when he was extremely young plus barely capable of proper speech, Nimo managed to learn the Avarice Amplifier Symbol and use it inside combat!
