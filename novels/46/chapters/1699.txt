ÔªøÔªø1700 The Last Dance. VIII

"AAAAGGH!!"

Felix, now imbued with the might of a god, launched himself at Amun-Ra, his hammer swinging with deadly intent.

Each strike intended not just to hit, but to obliterate, fueled by a desperation and fury unseen before!

BOOOM! BOOOM! BOOM!..

Amun-Ra countered the attacks with his scepter held in one hand, not feeling an ounce of threat even when Felix could be said to be in his ultimate form!

He had used all enhancing sin-symbolic techniques and even popped off the godhood ritual. He couldn't get any stronger than this unless he pushed past his universal limitation!

"Is this the extent of your wrath, child?"

Amun-Ra's voice was calm, almost disappointed, as he parried the hammer's descents, sending shockwaves rippling through the realm with each clash!

The ground beneath them cracked, and the sky twisted, but Amun-Ra remained untouchable, his movements fluid and precise.

"I will not be denied!"

Felix roared with bloodshot eyes, his attacks intensified, each blow stronger than the last, aiming to shatter the calm composure of the god before him.

But Amun-Ra danced around the fury, his scepter a blur of golden light, deflecting and redirecting with effortless grace.

The beams, bending and twisting in pursuit, sought to ensnare Amun-Ra, but he evaded them with a swan's elegance.

"You think to bind me with tricks?" He taunted, moving through the beams as if partaking in a deadly dance. "Your power is immense, child, but it lacks...finesse."

Felix, undeterred, summoned more beams, their numbers multiplying, a relentless assault of twisted energy.

"Then let's see how you dance under the weight of a thousand strikes!"

He shouted, the beams converging from all directions until they turned into a singular roaring dragon heading toward Amun-Ra with a wide open maw!

As the dragon opened its mouth, a sphere of conflicting energies grew larger and larger until it was launched with ferocious power!

"Foolish attempt."

Unfazed, Amun-Ra made a single swing with his scepter, and after a flash of light, both the ferocious sphere and the dragon were sliced in half!!

"SPLIT!"

Felix acted swiftly and without hesitation, breaking the dragon apart into a thousand beams and sending them rushing towards Amun-Ra. He kept searching for an opening to land a direct strike on his opponent while maintaining the same fervor!

He had already crafted a plan that might get him out of this death sentence, but he had to land a strike first.

Alas...

Amun-Ra's scepter whirled in his hand, each motion repelling the incoming attacks with great ease.

"A thousand strikes, yet none can touch me. What does that tell you, child?" His tone was almost instructive, a teacher chiding a wayward student.UppTodatùíÜd frùíêm n√¥/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

'I am running out of time, I have to commit! I have to!'

Felix kept raining down on Amun-Ra with a barrage of strikes, unbothered by his enemy's taunts...His mind was completely occupied with finding out the best way to create an opening and strike Amun-Ra.

He understood that if he wanted to escape, he had to do something outlandish that even Amun-Ra wouldn't predict!

Thus, with a strategy brewing within the depths of his cunning mind, he prepared his next move, a strike designed to catch even a god off guard!

High above Amun-Ra, Felix poised himself, his hammer raised menacingly. Amun-Ra, ever vigilant, prepared to evade the impending strike with his customary grace.

"FAALL!!"

Just as Felix's hammer dropped with a force that threatened to shatter the very fabric of the dream realm, Amun-Ra shifted his position with effortless ease, a mere blur to the mortal eye!

However, as the hammer neared its impact on the ground, Felix's voice thundered through the realm, "Switch!"

Rumble!!!

In an instant, the laws of the realm obeyed Felix's command, the sky and ground swapping places in a disorienting flip that turned the dreamrealm upside down!!!

"Hmm?!"

This sudden inversion of reality caught Amun-Ra by surprise, a rare moment of vulnerability in the face of Felix's ingenuity as his body was also turned upside down!

The only difference was that Felix had anticipated this while he didn't.

With the realm now upside down and Felix having free space to move his hammer, he swung the hammer with renewed vigor directly at Amun-Ra's chest from an angle that wouldn't have been possible without turning the realm upside down!

The move was so unexpected, so swift, that even Amun-Ra, the embodiment of divine foresight, found himself unprepared for the sudden reversal of the battlefield!

With no time to evade, Amun-Ra brought his arms up in a cross to shield himself from the blow.

RUUUUMBLE!!!

Upon impact, instead of getting hurled into the distance as Felix and the tenants had anticipated, Amun-Ra remained affixed in his position, resisting the powerful momentum like a wall against the shove of a mere mortal!

"Give up, the gap between us is simply unbridgable," Amun-Ra remarked with a stone-cold face as he stood locked in this titanic struggle!

Feeling the resistance, Felix's determination only hardened.

He recognized the gap in their strengths, a gap that no amount of physical prowess could bridge. But Felix was not one to accept the limitations of the universe without challenge!

With murderous bloodshot eyes, Felix called upon the laws of the greed sin, not as a plea to the dream realm, but to the very essence of his sin-driven power!

"EVERY GAP CAN BE CROSSED WITH SUFFICENT RESOLVE! REMOVE THE UNIVERSAL LIMITATION!"

Felix roared, his voice echoing through the realms, a testament to his refusal to be bound by the cosmic laws that governed all beings!

As the words left his lips,a transformation began instantly, the universe responded to his call even when Felix didn't use anything for a sacrifice.

Felix's body became the focal point of an unprecedented surge of power.

His sin-symbolic techniques, the Infernal Pact of Avarice and Wrath, alongside the Prideful Aura of Supremacy, activated with full intensity!

These techniques, fueled by Felix's unyielding pride and seething anger, began to amplify his strength exponentially, untethered by the universal constraints that had previously held him back!

120 million BF...140 million BF...150 million BF!!

The air around Felix crackled with raw, unbridled energy as if the very essence of sin and greed coalesced to shatter the chains that bound his potential!

His muscles bulged with newfound power, and his eyes blazed with a ferocious light, a herald of the unleashed fury about to be directed at the god before him.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHG!!! FAAAAALLLLL!!"

With this newfound strength, Felix pushed against Amun-Ra with renewed vigor, uncaring that his body was teething on falling apart as such strength was way beyond what it could handle!

The universe didn't put such limitations on unigins for the fun of it...All beings in its territory had a finality point and crossing it was the same as going against the universe's creation and balance.

Unfortunately, Amun-Ra was a grade higher than those creations...

"Boy, you are starting to get on my nerves."

Amun-Ra's expression turned icy as he was compelled to escalate his strength to counter Felix's surging power!

The once regal robe adorning his form was cast aside by the sheer force of their confrontation, revealing his chiseled physique that glowed with an inner light, more radiant than the sun itself.

His skin, kissed by an eternal tan, stretched tight over muscles that seemed to be carved from the very essence of divinity, with veins that pulsed not with blood but with pure, dazzling light.

As Amun-Ra exerted himself beyond the limits, his muscular frame expanded, each fiber radiating with intensified luminescence, pushing him towards a staggering two hundred million BF!!

"ARGHHHH!"

Felix, driven by an unstoppable will and the power of his sin-symbolic techniques, tried his best to match this godly display of might, their combined strength reaching a pinnacle that tore at the fabric of reality itself!

Around their unmoving bodies, the realm trembled under the weight of their clash.

Rumble Rumble!!

Space itself began to unravel, giving birth to anomalies that defied understanding.

Swirls of black electricity crackled in the air, a manifestation of the chaos wrought by their power.

The very laws of physics seemed to bend and warp, generating a spectacle of destruction and beauty as reality struggled to contain the magnitude of their battle!

This was no longer a fight; it was an event that reshaped the very perception of power in the minds of anyone spectating this battle!

"What the hell am I watching..."

Fenrir, Thor, J√∂rmungandr, Elder Kraken, Lady Sphinx, Lord Loki, Ancestral Dragon Imyr, Candace, and even Lord Shiva were left with widened eyes reflecting this epic confrontation of two beings beyond their understanding and reach.

Yet, the only ones who were appreciating it fully were Lilith and Lord Hades, who was watching from his spirit realm through Felix's eyes.

'Whether he wins or loses, he will have a painful price to pay for this...' Lord Hades murmured to himself, knowing that such a wish would have grave consequences.
