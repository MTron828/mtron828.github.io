Chapter 1582 Altering Lord Marduk's Perception of Him.

Ôªø1582 Altering Lord Marduk's Perception of Him.

"You guys didn't know that and considered the false inscriptions to be the real thing, making you consider these monoliths to merely have a sentimental value, nothing more, nothing less." Felix disclosed.

Lady Sphinx and the others nodded in agreement.

"At that period, we were already fighting with each other in many situations, so the last thing we had in mind was to collect those monoliths through aggression," Fenrir mentioned.

The Primogenitors Era wasn't peaceful in the slightest with the entire universe being placed in a constant war between the Primogenitors and their empires.

So, even though those beings' incentive to create mayhem didn't work properly, the result was the same.

In the end, Felix came along and helped Lady Sphinx collect most of the monoliths through his battles.

"Whether this is their objective or not, it's not the focal point here." Lord Marduk uttered with a tint of eagerness, "I can at least translate five sentences immediately with this perfected data."

"Five more elemental techniques?!"

Felix and the others were left somewhat astounded...They were still processing the other two techniques and now they would be getting five more?

"These inscriptions are not mere writings...They are a lexicon guide, a key to understanding the entirety of the universal codex. Each inscription here is interconnected, forming a comprehensive guide to deciphering and utilizing the universal codex."

To demonstrate, Lord Marduk selected a specific sentence from the myriad of his inscriptions and read it aloud in the language of the universal codex.

Suddenly, the air around Lord Marduk began to shimmer, and a faint glow enveloped his hands.Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

He opened his eyes, now glowing with a newfound energy. With a swift motion, he released this energy, and a spectacular display of the new elemental technique unfolded.

From his hands emerged streams of prismatic light, weaving through the air, bending and refracting in a mesmerizing dance!

Then, the light turned into a sphere on his palm and began growing smaller, yet brighter.

"Is this neutral energy?"

Felix and the others watched in awe, witnessing the birth of a new technique unseen for eons!

They understood that primogenitor couldn't manipulate neutral energy in other ways besides converting it into their elements.

Yet now, they were watching with their own eyes how Lord Marduk was condensing it into a potent sphere capable of great damage without it being turned into any element!

"From its translation and effect, this must be an external neutral energy condensation technique." Lord Marduk shared the inscription's translation, "From the void's embrace, gather and form, condense the unseen into reality's norm."

"This is another banger." Lord Loki remarked, "In combination with elemental expansion and external conversion, we can condense neutral energy before converting it, allowing us to create powerful versions of abilities almost instantly."

Felix and the others thought the same.

"How about this one?"

Lord Marduk didn't give them the chance to discuss this technique for more than a minute before he already translated another technique!

With a graceful motion, Lord Marduk began to weave his hands, causing the neutral energy sphere to turn into a brilliant fireball.

Then, he uttered another sentence with the same peculiar-sounding voice, causing the flames to lose their fiery brilliance.

A moment later, it returned to its original state, a formless mass of neutral energy!

"Conversion Reversal!" Felix exclaimed.

"This is truly fascinating..."

"I feel ashamed that I have claimed myself to have mastered my element," Thor remarked with a wry smile, feeling like he was a student all over again being introduced to new stuff about his element.

Granted, all of the shown techniques were related to neutral energy more than their elements, but still.

"Is there any elemental technique related specifically to an element?" Fenrir inquired while gazing at the monolith.

"Of course."

Lord Marduk went ahead and showed them another technique capable of boosting their elemental abilities' effectiveness. Then, another one able to clone the used ability instantaneously as long as enough neutral energy was in the premise!

It was like Lord Marduk was given a fishing rod in a river filled with fish after he was using his bare hands to catch them!

He just kept pulling one technique after another from the inscriptions, some were unique and extraordinary, and some were basic and had a niche utilization.

Whatever technique he showed, Felix could feel his blood boiling in excitement, already imagining the massive power-up he would receive!

In the end, Lord Marduk stopped after facing some lexical difficulties at last that required intense studying to understand.

"I can't imagine what the universe would become if all primogenitors possessed those elemental techniques." Fenrir mentioned with a solemn tone.

"Well, it's not like they have to know." Felix uttered calmly, "If it wasn't for their stubbornness to hold into their monoliths, Lord Marduk would have figured out all the techniques and shared it with them as payback. But now?"

Felix had absolutely no interest in sharing news about this to the primogenitors. In his eyes, Lord Marduk and Lady Sphinx were the only ones truly deserving of learning the techniques.

Lord Osiris a little bit since he was also an avid collector and handed Lady Sphinx a significant quantity after he lost his bet in the primogenitors' games event...Plus, Lady Sphinx had promised that she would invite him when she collected all the monoliths.

As for the rest? Unless those two wanted to be generous and share some of the techniques, no one had the right to get close to them.

"I have a better idea." Fenrir shared expressionlessly, "You can use those techniques to buy their loyalty and help when you enter the eternal kingdom."

"Do you mean to bring them with me as subordinates?" Felix raised an eyebrow in surprise.

"Why not?" Fenrir nodded, "You have heard about the eternal kingdom from the traitor. Being a unigin is nothing extraordinary there as it is their land. If you want to compete against them, you will need decent subordinates."

"Interesting..." Felix stroked his chin thoughtfully at his suggestion.

He realized that Fenrir was mostly right...Entering the eternal kingdom was the easiest part. Surviving in it and making a name for himself was going to be the real challenge.

It wasn't going to be easy doing it alone.

"Elemental techniques won't be enough, they have to learn the truth and understand that their mortal enemies are those beings." Felix mentioned while glancing at Lord Marduk.

"Before looking at me like that, how about you hold your part of the deal and help me understand the situation better?" Lord Marduk uttered with a serious tone, "Celestial flames, your confidence in entering the eternal kingdom, and your enhanced spiritual pressure, I want to know about everything."

Felix looked at Lady Sphinx and his companions. They gave him a slight head nod in approval, making him understand that Lord Marduk was trustworthy.

Before, he planned on giving him just some snippets of the truth, but now, he grasped that the only way to win over Lord Marduk completely was to bring him into the team wholeheartedly.

The only way to do so was with the full truth.

So, he condensed a memory film with all the key turning points in his life, like merging with Asna's soul, obtaining her core, allying together with Lord Hades, targeting Nimo's alter ego, and the list goes on...

Then, he removed the memory film as a spiritual sphere and sent it straight to Lord Marduk's mind with a mere touch of a finger.

As Lord Marduk delved into Felix's memory core, his form was momentarily still, his usually impassive demeanor giving way to a cascade of emotions.

The journey within Felix's core unveils a tapestry of experiences, trials, and transformations so profound that they transcended Lord Marduk's vast understanding of the cosmos.

With each memory, Lord Marduk's astonishment grew. He witnessed Felix's encounters with beings of unimaginable power, his battles that bent the fabric of reality, and the pivotal moments that shaped him into the entity he was now.

The revelation of Felix's relationship with Asna, the acquisition of the unigin core, and the monumental act of planning to absorb Nimo's alter ego revealed before Marduk like an epic saga.

As the journey through the memories concluded, Lord Marduk slowly opened his eyes, now seeing Felix in an entirely new light.

The depth of Felix's experiences, the weight of his decisions, and the sheer magnitude of his evolution filled Lord Marduk with a profound sense of shock, awe, and undeniable respect.

Finally, Lord Marduk spoke, his voice resonated with sincerity, "Felix, your path has been one of unimaginable challenges and triumphs. To see the universe through your eyes was to witness a journey of courage, sacrifice, and relentless pursuit of power. In you, I see not just a formidable entity, but a paragon of what it means to transcend one's limits and reshape destiny."

"I understand now why most of my peers are watching your back...I fully understand."
