Chapter 1574 The Gathering of The Deities.

Ôªø1574 The Gathering of The Deities.

Meanwhile in Felix's consciousness space...

"I guess it turned out better than we expected," Felix remarked calmly while sitting at the central table with the tenants.

"It will be better only if you win." Lady Sphinx warned, "Lord Marduk isn't an easy opponent in the slightest...He is extremely intelligent and possesses a strategic mind like no other."

Felix nodded with a solemn expression.

To be the only primogenitor capable of deciphering the universal codex inscriptions, it was a no-brainer that Lord Marduk's intelligence was on a different level than even Lady Sphinx and Lady Yggdrasil.

To make matters worse, he wasn't a pacifist who purely focused on research...He was smart and powerful enough to make all primogenitors respect his will.

"Lord Shiva, have you ever fought against him besides that one time?" Felix asked, wanting to obtain more information to help his preparation.

"Beings at our level don't fight for fun, we fight once and that's it." Lord Shiva answered indifferently, "So no, we have never clashed directly during the primogenitors' era."

"I see..."

"But, I can tell you this for free." Lord Shiva added with a serious tone, "Boy if you want to win your battle, you will have only one chance, and that's freezing him with your spiritual pressure. Failing to do so means he will either win or the fight will never end."

"There is no other outcome besides those three."

While Lord Shiva didn't clarify much, it was obvious that he didn't believe himself to have what it takes to kill Lord Marduk.

Sure, he was the destruction primogenitor and possessed the most powerful abilities in the universe, but when dealing with the creation primogenitor?

The battle would always end evenly between them unless one of them made a fatal mistake, which was impossible.

The only reason Lord Shiva was believed to be the strongest primogenitor in his time was due to his absolute menacing terror.

In reality, those two were opposite faces of the same coin.

However, Felix had something that none of them possessed...A higher spiritual pressure, which was a game-changer in such close battles.

"I also believe the same." Felix affirmed in agreement, "He possesses unknown creation abilities and creation domain, which turns him into an unkillable god. I have to take advantage of his lack of information about my spiritual pressure to defeat him in the first second of the battle."

Everyone supported his plan. It was simple, direct, but most effective. When fighting against highly intelligent opponents, complex strategies would be less reliable than direct approaches.

Still...

"Just because you have chosen a direct approach, it doesn't mean that you jump him barbarically." Lady Sphinx advised, "He is like a chess master who is always a hundred times steps ahead of you, and if you made your motive obvious of getting close to him, he will make sure to keep his distance even if he had no idea about your spiritual pressure."

"I will see what I can do."Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

Felix comprehended that spiritual pressure was a killer move, but it had a fatal weakness of being obvious and slow.

In other words, while he could push his spiritual pressure to cover millions of kilometers, it would be utterly useless if it caught no one.

That's why he had to be extremely close to Lord Marduk before releasing it, giving him almost no time to react against it like he did to the darkins.

"You have been given a month to reach the location, but I think it's best if you make your move right now." Thor mentioned with a stern tone, "You can't give him an entire month on the battlefield, god knows how large his creation domain will be by the time you arrive."

Felix affirmed in agreement and requested Lord Khaos to help him teleport there after informing his squad that he would leave for a while.

As for the mind-controlled mercenaries? They would stay like that regardless of the distance until he canceled his mental control or died...Just like his army of crystal miners.

****

In the vast emptiness of space, far from the bustling life of galaxies and nebulae, Felix arrived at a location destined to become a historic battleground between the new destruction god and the current creation god.

The setting was stark yet majestic: an enormous, desolate expanse where the laws of physics seemed to hang in a delicate balance.

Before him loomed a planet, colossal in scale, five times the size of Jupiter, adorned with a massive ring that glittered with stardust and cosmic debris.

The ring cast a spectral light, creating a surreal backdrop for the impending confrontation. Nearby, two stars whirled in a perilous dance, their proximity was dangerously short.

They emitted a fierce light that bathed the area in an unyielding glow.

As Felix emerged from the void with the darkins, Nimo, and Candace, their arrival was marked by a ripple of energy that disturbed the eerie calm of the space.

'I guess everyone had the same thought as us.' Felix's eyelids twitched after noticing tens of primogenitors exiting from spatial portals, attending from all parts of the universe.

This sight didn't surprise him that much, knowing that they must have bought a ticket here from Lord Dune.

Unlike other lords, he never minded helping anyone as long as the price was worth the transaction.

'It's been a while since this many primogenitors had gathered in the real world.' Thor commentated with a nostalgic tone as he recalled the last pact he participated in.

That was the last time the primogenitors made a gathering before his death.

Meanwhile, the primogenitors formed a silent audience, their expressions ranging from impassive to keenly interested.

Some stood solitary, lost in their own contemplation of the upcoming battle, while others conversed in hushed tones, their voices a whisper against the backdrop of cosmic winds.

Felix took in the scene, his gaze sweeping over the assembled deities, wanting to check if Lord Marduk was around.

Unfortunately, he was nowhere to be seen...He even extended his senses to the nearest planet and they didn't pick on any lifeform.

'Is this a neutral area?' Felix slit his eyes, 'He didn't give me the location of his home, so the battle will be on fairgrounds?'

This made Felix understand that Lord Marduk was confident in beating him down and didn't want to leave him a single excuse to hide behind when he lost.

'I see how it is.' Felix smiled, not too bothered by this.

Meanwhile, the primogenitors comprehended that it was proper etiquette to leave a decent distance from each other unless there was a blind trust between them.

So, no one really approached Felix besides Lady Sphinx, Fenrir, Cyclope, and Lady Yggdrasil.

'Boy, how confident are you to win this?" Cyclope inquired while having his forging hammer resting on his shoulders.

"50/50." Felix responded genuinely.

"That's already freakishly high enough," Cyclope exclaimed, "I might even bet on you."

"Bet?"

"Yeah, Erebus has started collecting bets from everyone on the outcome of the battle the instant he exited from the rift." Cyclope ratted out while pointing at Erebus.

"Is that so?" Felix's eyelids twitched as he reached out to Erebus telepathically, 'What are the bets' terms?'

'Favors, ancient collectibles, and such...The usual.' Erebus shared, 'Kid, you are in the big leagues now, we can allow you to join the bet only if you choose yourself as the winner. If you lost, you better pay up even if a primogenitor used his favor to request the truth from you for free.'

'I know, put me in.' Felix participated without hesitation.
