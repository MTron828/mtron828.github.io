Chapter 1010 Everyone Wants In!

The Next Morning...

Felix, Olivia, and the rest of the earthling team were all gathered in the council hall that resembled a white egg...Even Noah and the secondary members were attending the meeting.

"Now that the captain has returned, I will leave things in his hands." George said with a wide smile as he walked to the side of the podium.

Although George's strength was incomparable to the earthling team, he was still kept around as the head coach due to his great contribution to the team.

Felix nodded in appreciation and stood in front of the podium. He looked around him and saw less familiar faces than the ones he used to knew.

It was quite normal...Besides the main team members, the rest of the team members were completely replaced by much stronger players.

After all, the earthling team was now the capital of the Federation.

In other words, it was representing the entire Federation and all backgrounds within it instead of just one planet.

This meant only the best of bloodliners of the Federations were recruited to join the team.

'Even Kenny got sacked and replaced.' Felix thought to himself, 'Fate really works in mysterious ways. I haven't aimed at him or done anything to him, yet he ended up fading in the background on his own.'

Felix was a firm believer of giving people second chances even if they had done the most horrible things ever.

After all, he was given the biggest second chance in the history of the universe.

It was only fair to give Kenny a second chance and not kill him off in this timeline because of the wrongdoings in the previous timeline.

'With how things developed, he couldn't betray earthlings even if he wanted.' Asna chuckled.

'True.'

In Felix's previous life, Kenny was the final straw that caused Earth to get kicked out of the SGAlliance and get forced to fall under the rulership of the Alexander Kingdom.

Although there was no evidence, everyone knew that Kenny had thrown the game.

It was a football-based game and Kenny had missed the goal even though he had the perfect opportunity to score.

If that goal was scored, earthling team would have tied and remained in the game.

Alas...

If this were all, everyone would have been merely pissed off at Kenny instead of accusing him for throwing the game.

What exposed him was the fact that he was given a high tiered citizenship in the Alexander Kingdom and enough capital to live his life in retirement.

Just like everyone else, Felix despised Kenny for betraying the earthlings at the most critical moment of their lives.

If they had won the last game, they would have survived the soft reset and be given an entire year to fix their ranking before the next reset.

That's why Felix was always keeping an eye on him at the very start, believing that he might pull the same shit.

Since Kenny hadn't done anything wicked in this timeline yet, it only reaffirmed Felix's belief that Kenny wasn't evil at heart.

He was simply forced by the circumstances.

Sure, what he did was unforgivable, but Felix was not entitled to judge him since he had also betrayed Earth by changing his citizenship to join the bloodline clan in the Mariana Empire.

'What's done is done.' Felix smiled faintly, 'I don't care what he is up to right now. Nothing he does can harm me or those I care about.'

Since Kenny faded in the background, it was better to leave him there...

"Captain?" Sylvia called after seeing Felix staring at them absentmindedly for a while.

"Oh, sorry about that." Felix woke up from his daze and announced calmly, "My main goal for coming back is hit radiant rank and join the Racial Games."

Everyone almost chocked on their saliva after hearing his shocking and daring proclamation.

When they heard that Felix was planning to join them, they expected him to play a couple of games and disappear on them again.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"Felix, you're kidding right?" George asked.

"I don't have time for jokes." Felix said with a stern tone, "Some races have ten to twenty teams in the Racial Games and helping their race farm SGPoints...Meanwhile, we don't even have one."

"It's time for us humans to join the competition."

Although his words were aspiring, it still didn't change the fact that everyone here was scared shitless by the implication of his decision.

Who could blame them?

They understood that the Racial Games required ten members in each team. This meant that even if Felix was going to fight alone in those games, he needed nine other players to fill up the numbers.

They didn't mind doing so in the diamond games since they were fully confident that Felix would terrorize everyone.

But in the Racial Games? It was thoroughly different...They would be going against ten players with at least a peak-tier radiant rank under their belt.

No matter how confident they were in Felix, they understood that he couldn't fight and protect them at the same time against those monsters, who move at least five times the speed of sound.

"You guys think I can't protect you?" Felix promised, "You don't have have to worry...I give you my word that you won't lose a single hair strand."

"Of course, if you are still not comfortable to enter such battlefield, I won't force either of you."

Felix wouldn't hold it against them even if everyone decided to ditch on the team...He understood that he was asking them to put their lives in his hands.

No one would be too comfortable by such thought.

"I'm in." Leo expressed with a faint smirk, "I heard that the Racial Games offer wishes to all team members in addition to other great benefits...I can't say no to such freebies."

"Haha! I totally forgot about that!" Ronaldinho announced with a heartedly laugh, "Count me in as well."

Now that they were reminded that the risk they would take wouldn't go rewardless, most of the team members eyes lighted up.

One by one, they started raising their hands in the air while expressing their desire to join the Racial Games.

In their eyes, they would be getting rewards without even needing to lift a finger in the Racial Games.

Though, the downside was the fact that they could die at any given moment without even knowing how it happened.

"For now, let's finish the diamond games."

After he saw that most of the team had agreed, Felix manifested two holograms...One was showing the earthling team's state and the other showed the green button to spin the wheel.

"The team's stats are quite great...It's unfortunate that you have lost the winning streak bonus, but it's still a good result." Felix praised as he checked the stats again.

He knew that not a single team in human history had such results even when origin bloodliners were involved.

After all, there weren't many origin bloodliners in the galaxy and most of them weren't too interested in meaningless climb in the SGPlatform.

In their eyes, it wasn't worth risking their lives after going through so much crap to finally break through to the Origin Realm.

That's why not a single origin bloodliners had volunteered to join the earthling team and assist them in the climb even though they had reached the diamond rank.

"Let's restart our winning streak again." Felix proclaimed with a confident smirk as he spanned the format wheel before everyone.

Ting Ting Ting...

Before anyone could react, Felix spanned the second wheel and brought it into a halt almost instantaneously.

"Me!"

"I am in!"

"Pick me, captain!"
