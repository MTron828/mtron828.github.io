Chapter 1715 Capital Quantaar.

ÔªøÔªø1715 Capital Quantaar.

A phenomenon that eluded even the smartest beings in the universe, leaving them unable to connect the dark reaction's existence with anything related to the universal order.

'I can't wait...I can't wait for the day when there will be nothing, absolutely nothing but eternal darkness.'

As Apollo's darkside contemplated the silent ranks, his figure a lone beacon of authority in the engulfing darkness, it became evident that his ambitions stretched far beyond the confines of the quantum realm.

In this universe of light and matter, where the three rulers held sway, he seemed to envision a new order, one forged from the very essence of void and shadow.

"Out of the darkness was the universe born and into the darkness, it shall return, Haha, hahaha!!"

As the echo of his laughter, both chilling and exhilarating, filled the realm, the scene faded to black, a prelude to a saga that threatened to redraw the boundaries of existence itself.

Meanwhile, Felix was still vibing with Apollo on top of the pink cloud, having no idea about the kind of trouble he was heading to...

Somewhere in the infinite expanse of the quantum realm, Eris, Uranus, and Demeter moved as a singular unit, their forms shifting to adapt to the peculiarities of this space.Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))

"Finding a way into any of the fifty major civilizations scattered across the realm will be a lengthy process." Demeter uttered with a stern tone, "Can't you utilize your laws to find them?"

They had been roaming the quantum realm for more than a year now and they had yet to locate a single portal, entry, or gate linked to any of the large civilizations.

It was an expected result.

When it came to finding those entry points, one had to be either a native or possess immense luck.

"We can create portals, but due to the spacetime instability here, we might end up in a far worse situation." Eris replied calmly, "Just be patient, the moment we find an already established portal, I can reengineer it to lead us to our desired destinations."

"You better be," Uranus said with a cold look.

After what happened in their last meeting, he didn't trust Eris in this search mission at all.

Eris ignored his remark and continued moving forward while sending her senses far and wide, hoping to pick up on any kind of portal.

If she had been in Felix and Apollo's place when they discovered the quantum maze, she would have already entered one of the many major empires and started her search.

"Apollo is bound to seek refuge among the realms' natives until the Rift opens up." Demeter tried to change the subject, "Where do you think he is more likely to stay in?"

"Since the rift between the realm and his alter ego opens at random locations, it's hard to tell." Uranus frowned, "Vibronix Empires is the first that comes to mind due to their open-mindedness in accepting foreigners, but, Apollo isn't that dumb to head for such a high-profiled empire."

"True, he is quite cowardly and will most definitely pick the safest option to avoid us." Demeter nodded in agreement, "I trust he will choose Damikon Nation or Roman Kingdom. They don't accept foreigners, but it will be easier to infiltrate them through a disguise."

Although most unigins were not interested in visiting the quantum realm, they still gathered information about it. As a result, many of them knew about major empires, cities, native cultures, their strengths, weaknesses, and more.

"If you think Apollo will spend that much time away from women and entertainment, then you truly don't know him deeply enough." Eris shook her head, "He will most likely pick the liveliest city. The capital Quantaar of the Vibronix Empire is the best choice."

Before Uranus could respond, Demeter interjected with a suggestion, "Your thought process is also valid...How about this, we split up when we locate portals, and we each head to a different city."

"I couldn't be any happier." Uranus agreed with a faint scoff.

"It's decided then." Demeter shared, "Uranus will head towards the Vibronix Empire since you are more attuned with the laws there while we choose another location."

Eris shrugged her shoulders in agreement and the party persisted on its journey.

Just like Ares, unigins preferred to work solo since they trusted in their capabilities more than anyone else.

Since the three rulers couldn't care less about how the mission was handled as long as the results were favorable, they were given free reign to do as they pleased.

***

Over eight months passed since Felix entered the quantum realm.

Felix and Apollo had already discovered the nearest entry point leading to the Vibronix Empire. If it wasn't for Apollo's alter ego's guidance whenever they got lost, they would have spent more than centuries heading toward nowhere.

However, the entry point merely threw them somewhere random in the Vibronix Empire's territory, which was massive in its own right.

Fortunately, Apollo's alter ego knew the directions and this allowed them finally to travel at the speed of light without worrying about missing portals or such.

After some time, Apollo slowed down his speed until they came to a halt.

"Why have we stopped? Have we arri...Woaaw!"

Before Felix could finish his question, an awed exclamation escaped from his lips after being welcomed by a sight that was both bewildering and breathtaking.

A marvelous colorful city of vibrational engineering was presented before them!

The buildings themselves were unlike anything in the known universe, designed to resonate harmoniously with the natural frequencies of the realm.

They stood tall and slender, crafted from materials that shimmered with translucency, reflecting the city's ever-changing mood.

The architecture was fluid, with structures pulsating gently, as if breathing, their forms subtly shifting in response to the vibrational energies coursing through the air!

Vehicles, if they could be called that, floated without making contact with the ground, propelled by harmonic resonances that allowed for smooth, soundless travel.

These crafts varied in size and shape, accommodating single passengers or groups, all moving in a synchronized ballet that avoided any collisions or disruptions to the city's harmonic flow!

The city of Quantaar was a vibrant and bustling place, with locals and visitors intermingling freely.

The Vibronix natives progressed with a graceful and almost musical gait, their bodies seemingly in tune with the pulsating rhythm of the city.

They displayed a wide range of appearances, with some sporting iridescent tattoos that pulsed in sync with their heartbeat, while others adorned themselves with jewelry that resonated with their personal frequency.

Foreigners of all kinds added to the city's vibrancy, each bringing a piece of their home through their unique appearances and customs.

"This...this isn't a normal city...It feels like a breathing living entity." Felix murmured in astonishment.

"That's because it is a living breathing creature." Apollo smiled widely as he introduced himself with an extended arm, "Welcome to Quantaar, a mega vibrational creature that feeds on outsourced frequencies from the natives and creatures. In return, it protects the citizens from the dangers of the quantum realm."

Felix was left stunned as he gazed at the city, not spotting a single hint of this metropolis being an actual creature besides its liveliness!

"You joking right?"

"You will find out when we step inside." Apollo chuckled as he took Felix toward the city's main gate.
