Chapter 131 - Hidden Compartment Chest

A mountain of jigsaw boxes, cross word puzzles toys, colorful cubes and more of such games, all piled up in the corner of the room. Some were brand new, while the majority had tear marks on them.

"Let's see if I can break my record."

She switched her vision from that mountain to Felix, who was sitting in front of two cartoonist jigsaw boxes. He put a timer next to him and unlocked the boxes at the same time. He then did the unexpected, as he emptied them all in one spot and mixed their pieces together!

"Let's begin! I need to finish before lunch."

He let out a childlike laugh and began piecing the two puzzles, each in one space.

Asna didn't stay to watch the rest, as she already saw enough to understand Felix's abnormal familiarity with puzzles.

If she stayed another second, she might begin reevaluating his stupid image in her mind to an intelligent one. She would rather die before that happened. So, she could only exit the memory and reconnect her connection with Felix.

....

'Asna? It's weird that you are not begging me to use the teleportation circle.'

Befuddled, Felix crouched near the circle while scratching his cheek. He expected that Asna would squeal at him for using it, but she went silent for a while now.

'No need! You won't listen to me anyway.'

'True.'

'Bastard.'

She gritted her teeth and stopped bickering with him. As for mentioning what happened earlier? She wouldn't mention it even if the fate of the universe was based on it. She knew that Felix was merely waiting for her to ask, so he would reply smugly about his childhood.

There was nowhere in hell, she would put herself in that situation.

'Let's hope we find something worth our time.'

Felix decided to focus on the chest after realizing that his chance to brag was not coming. Annoyed, he approached the chest aggressively.

"Don't kick it!" "Don't kick!!" "Don't kick!"...

The spectators yelled with desperation written all over their faces after seeing his hands were in his pockets as he approached the chest.

Smach!!

Zero f*cks given by Felix, as he kicked the lid of the chest wide open. The audience instantly spat and cursed at him. Before long, boos rained on him again.

His fans didn't even make a squeak this time, as they were also low key hating what he did.

Two epic chests were just ruined by his thuggish personality. What's sad was the fact those chests were the only ones found in the game currently. For both of them to end up on Felix's hands, was truly an unfortunate day for the audience.

Felix sighed in relief after seeing no fireworks leaving the chest. Well, it was only natural, as he was currently inside a wall, and with the SGA taking realism dead serious, they wouldn't do so, even if they could.

He waited for a moment, but it seemed that the chest wasn't going to display its content like the one before. So, he put his hand inside and brought everything outside.

'Oh! Not bad at all.'

Delighted, his eyes gleamed as he evaluated the three items in his hands. The first one appeared the same as a chicken leg. If it wasn't for its l.u.s.trous azure color, everyone would mistake it as such.

"Hehe, Malon Chicken fish leg, this one is going to net a good sum."

How could it not?

This leg was one of the few possible ways for nonmarine races to be able to breathe underwater freely without side effects. Though for a limited time.

"Never mind I should probably use it."

His thoughts of selling it were extinguished after recalling games, which had marine-based maps. If he had it in his previous life, he wouldn't have struggled to just survive against the environment.

Satisfied with the first item, he retrieved it inside his bracelet. As for the other two items, one was a small book and the other was an orange shimmering scroll.

"Interesting, Exit navigation ability?"

He opened the book and found out after reading the first page that it was an ability, which uses an arrow to point in the right direction of the exit.

His palms couldn't help but get sweaty after reading that. However, his tense muscles relaxed after finding out that it had only 2 minutes duration.

No one could run from their spot to the exit in 2 minutes unless they were already quite close to it. At that point, this ability was going to be a ticket to the championship.

He wiped his sweaty hands and focused on the scroll. He unsealed it with an eager expression, hoping to be surprised.

"The hell!"

Well, he was surprised alright after seeing a path drawn from his current spot to a red 'X' at the top rightmost corner of the maze, written above it >Legendary Chest<.

Yet his happiness didn't even take root before it got quenched by the long distance between him and the mark.

Based on the scroll, he figured out that his position was near the bottom leftmost of the maze. This meant to reach the chest; he would need to travel the entire map from corner to corner on foot while dealing with beasts, chests, and players on the way. He knew that was impossible to do, especially now that there was a bet ongoing.

Irritated yet again, he kicked the damned chest for giving him such a treasure without the ability to use it. If only he was given the first two items alone, his mood wouldn't be ruined like this.

'Felix there is another way to solve it.'

Asna decided to rejoin the chat after believing that this problem should have offset his focus from the puzzle.

'Don't you dare propose using the circle.'

Felix easily figured out her purpose based on her appeasing sweet tone. Every time she required something for him, she used the same tone.

'Come on, just use it, what are you going to lose? You are already at the worst possible position to get the chest.'

He glanced at the white circle and at the scroll in his hand. He kept switching sight between the two not knowing if it was a worthy venture or not.

Asna had a good point. He understood it clearly as well. But, if he decided to teleport, it meant that he would need to give up on the beasts he marked in this area and start hunting randomly in whichever zone he got teleported at.

It's a big gamble to take. If he succeeds, he would be close to the legendary chest, making the venture worth it. But if he failed, which was actually highly likely to happen, he would end up hunting leftovers of the players in the zone he got teleported into.

If he got lucky, he might find epic rank beasts that no one dared to fight against.

"Whatever."

Helpless, he rubbed his eyelids and entered the circle under the cheers of both Asna and his fans. Both of those bastards only wanted to get entertained, uncaring about the stress of the player. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, Felix didn't do it for either of them, He only believed that regret awaits him if he missed this chance to open a legendary chest. Especially when he needed a massive amount of GP.

If he failed, so be it, he could just frenzy hunt anything he meets. But if he succeeds, those hardcore players should just give up on the wager.

If epic chest gave 1500 GP, How many more a legendary chest would give Felix?

...

30 seconds later, Felix's body reassembled from light particles into becoming whole again.

A moment after, He opened his eyes and raised his vigilance to the peak; he began surveying the area with his infrared vision activated to its full potential.

Wall after a wall was being removed from his sight, exposing a 100-meter diameter around him without a single hindrance.

Immediately after, two red lights were laid bare in his predatory eyes. One was at the very tip of his vision, showcasing a weak shape of a quadruped beast, while the other was 70 meters away to his right, displaying a shape of a human.

'Not bad, a beast and a human.'

Satisfied, he smiled and lowered the intensity of his vision to the minimum again. The walls began to reappear until he was sandwiched between two, creating a path that led to a 90 degree two ways cross.

Felix pulled his right sleeve up and clicked on his bracelet, planning to bring out the scroll to check on his position.

Hopeful, he unrolled the scroll wholly, showcasing a new drawn path between him and the chest. The path was the only thing shown on the map, as for the rest of the maze? It appeared foggy, blocking his vision from seeing the paths around his position.

'See?! You should always listen to my advice!'

Felix didn't even get the chance to feel elated about the new path before Asna's proud voice ruined it for him.

'It's just alright. I will still need 1 hour and half at least to reach the chest.'

Annoyed, he snorted and closed the scroll, not wanting to give her the satisfaction of being right. Although he didn't enter the circle due to her advice, Asna would still see it as such and take the credit since she was the first to propose it.

'Hehe, I can taste your salt from this misty popcorn.'

Felix clicked his tongue and stopped bickering with her. There were more pressing issues to take care of now.

'Which one of those two are on the way to the treasure?' He asked.

He didn't want to move until he got a clear objective of what he should do. As for the chest? That was for later.

Felix never planned to just run to it straight, ignoring all the preys in his path. He was not stupid to miss free guarantee GP.

After all, he had no idea which beast was guarding that chest. Hell, it could be a mental type legendary beast, and Felix understood clearly that if it was, the only option he had was to give up on it.

This meant that he would have wasted 1 hour and a half running for nothing. His contenders on the bet were definitely going to surpass him. Forget about Princess Bird, Mastermania who wasn't even in the top 5 could reach him!

Thus, Any prey he met on the way must be killed no matter what!
