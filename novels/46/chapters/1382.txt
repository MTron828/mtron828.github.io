1383 A Wandering Spirit.

'Felix! Wake up!‚Äò Asna called, her voice echoing through the vacant corridors of his thoughts, a solitary melody playing on the silent stage of his mind.

While Felix had lost his memories and consciousness, Asna wasn't affected as much by their death...Her memories could not be erased since it was one of the spirits guardian's laws and as the origin of laws, she was immune to all of them.

Ever since their passing, she had been trying her best to wake up Felix as she could sense his presence, a faint flicker amidst the abyss, but it was as if he was a distant star, unreachable and forgetful of its own brilliance.

She ventured deeper, traversing through the maze of forgotten memories, past echoes of laughter, warmth, and love, all now cold and fading away into nothingness.

"Felix," she whispered again, her voice like the softest breeze, trying to coax life back into the decaying remnants of his memories.

She reached out, her ethereal hand drifting through the shimmering remnants of his past, dissipating like fog at her touch. Each fragment of memory was cold, lacking the vibrant life it once held, but she was relentless.

But her pleas went unanswered.

The void swallowed her words, extinguishing them as they echoed into nothingness.

'The only way for his memories to return is through the spirits guardian. I have to meet him.‚Äò

Knowing that her attempts were futile, Asna moved on to her next plan.

A deep breath filled her lungs and she closed her eyes, her chest rising and falling with the universe's rhythm. She folded her hands together in a gesture of prayer, and her spiritual energy began to coalesce, building, growing, reaching out to the farthest corners of her essence.

Suddenly, her spirit was ablaze. The power she held deep within her soul came alive, pulsating with a strength that echoed through the expanse of the void. Her brilliance degree was increasing exponentially, setting her alight in the darkness.

It was like a star being born in the deep recesses of space. The energy surged through her veins, setting every fiber of her being alight. The light around her grew brighter, the glow intensifying until it illuminated the entire void.

It was so powerful it felt tangible, casting brilliant streaks across the abyss that seemed to turn the darkness itself into a canvas of ethereal beauty!

The radiance poured out from her in waves, shifting from soft gold to the intense white of a supergiant star.

Her power seemed to vibrate through the universe itself, casting everything into a bright silhouette. Each pulse sent ripples through the cosmos, bending the fabric of reality to its will!

The nearby spirits were all pushed away and overshadowed by the intense light, making them almost invisible.

And in that moment, Asna was not just a star, she was the star.

'Please let this work...‚Äò

Her immense brilliance hadn't gone unnoticed. In this dreadful blue hue void, no one else shimmered as intense as she.

This caused all the nearby Charons to get attracted to the emerging light, making them seem like moths flying in the direction of a hot lamp.

As Asna continued to illuminate the void, casting the darkest corners of the cosmos with the brilliance of her energy, she began to see a movement in the distance.

At first, they were mere specks of black against the vibrant canvas of the universe, but soon their shapes started taking form.

They were the Charons, the ferrymen of the spirit realm...Resplendent in their otherworldly robes, they maneuvered their spectral boats with ease only born from an eternity of traversing the cosmos. Their figures, cloaked in shadows and mystery, were in stark contrast to Asna's bright brilliance, yet held a certain allure of their own.

Their boats, crafted from the stardust and the echoes of the cosmos, glided effortlessly through the vast expanse of the void.

Each boat was a work of art, inlaid with intricate designs of galaxies and constellations, its sails woven from strands of nebulae, reflecting the faint glow of the stars.

'It worked...‚Äò

Asna sighed in reprieve as she lowered the intensity of her light, knowing that if she continued pushing herself, she would end up going into slumber to recoup the lost spiritual energy.

Even though her light dimmed down, it didn't matter to those Charons as she was still the brightest spirit in the area, making her the most wanted.

After the Charons had arrived and surrounded Asna/Felix from all sides, none of the ghostly ferrymen made a move to pick them up.

Instead, they entered a telepathic discussion with each other, using the language of the dead.

'I have never seen such brilliance in life before...0ur master has told us if we ever see something like this, we have to report to him immediately.‚Äò A Charon with a spectral goat's head and the eerie grace of hidden spider legs disclosed with a earnest tone.I think you should take a look at

'This spirit is really too unique...How can two souls be merged into one, yet still each maintains their own colors and brilliance,making them get judged individually by the master's laws?‚Äò Another one added with an intrigued tone.

Just as the other Charons wanted to join the conversation, Asna sent a telepathic message to all of them, 'I request a meeting with the spirits guardian, Hades.‚Äò

'It can talk!‚Äò

'Oho...Does this spirit really belongs to a unigin?'

'It must be, only unigins can avoid our lord's laws.'

The Charons were left dazed as none of them had seen the spirit of a unigin in their entire long and arduous lives. Still, none of them listened to her request as they‚Äòre operating on a set of iron rules, and in this case, they had to report back to their master. Just as one of them was going to do this, all of them received a ringing heavenly order straight in their minds.

'Bring her.'

Without a single word uttered, one of the Charons picked up Asna/Felix's spirit and placed it inside a small container. v

Their humanoid spirit was turned into a small multicolored flame, flickering once in a while. The container was placed above a long shelve amidst thousands of other shelves.

All of them carried millions of the same containers.

Listening to the order, the Charon canceled any plans he had on collecting more spirits and took off in the direction of the heavenly plane, disappearing into the cosmos in the blink of an eye.

'A dead unigin...What in master‚Äòs name is happening in the living realm?l

The goat‚Äîlike Charon wondered as he gazed at the unique flickering flame of Felix and Asna, having a strong feeling that they're inviting trouble into their own world.

Alas, such thoughts had no place in his mind as he could only listen to the orders and bring them back to his master.

Meanwhile, in the living world...

More than a year had gone since Felix's death as the time difference between the spirit realm and the matter universe was not fixed.

Sometimes, the spirit realm moved faster and sometimes it moved slower...In this case, a mere few minutes in the spirit realm were turned into an entire year in the outside.Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm

The SGAlliance's leaders did as they planned and focused wholly on conquering the seven demon realms as fast as possible.

Since the demon princes had no clue about Felix's situation, all of them went into hiding and give up on their demon realms.

This made it a walk in the park for the alliance's troops to streakroll all the populated planets and reverse as many demons as possible.

In less than a year, the seven demon realms were successfully conquered and named as The Twilight Terra.

The moment the SGAlliance's troops finished their conquest and retracted most of their troops back to their positions, the news of Felix's death was leaked somehow and it had sent crushing waves across the entire network!

More than 90% of the citizens disbelieved the news and made fun of the rumor spreader while the last 10% either wanted their grand supreme to be dead or were just eager to witness some drama unfolding.

Whatever it was, the network was buzzing with this tumor and everyone were waiting patiently for the alliance's leaders to come in public and dinanounce the rumors.

However, nothing like this happened and the SGAlliance's kept ignoring the public outrage. Their silence on the matter made most citizens believe that their leaders simply had no time to waste on such nonsense while the rest began to have doubts about the rumor's falsehood.

While the citizens had no access to more detailed information, the same did not apply to Noah, Olivia, Selphie, Bodidi, and the rest of Felix's loved ones.

The moment they heard the news, they reached out to Felix and when he did not answer, they assumed that he was busy training.

Still, they did not drop the subject and checked with Lady Sphinx and Fenrir.

"He's dead, he was smitten from above."

Unfortunately, neither Lady Sphinx nor Fenrir sugarcoated the news, leaving them frozen in their places the instant they received their confirmation...
