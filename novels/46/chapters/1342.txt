1343 The Universal Conquest!

As Lucifer, reborn and ascended, began his universal rampage, the cosmos resonated with his sinister, indomitable presence!

With Felix's ultimate abilities, the ascension enhancement, and his original gifts, he seemed absolutely unstoppable!

He increased his size to that of celestial bodies using size manipulation ultimate ability, causing each step he took to echo across the void of space with the frightening tune of his power!

The crimson-haired titan traveled between celestial bodies with terrifying ease, his demonic form wreathed in an unholy aura.

With a mere sweep of his hand, he released unfathomable levels of evil energy that engulfed planets and sucked the last drop of purity from them!

'This is the good stuff!' Lucifer enjoyed the sensation very much as those purities were capable of enhancing his strength in all departments!

Unlike other demons, he wasn't affected by petty amounts, but devouring purities from celestial bodies whether populated or not was a different matter entirely.

His power, once merely a potent force, kept growing exponentially with each feast.

When he was done with planets, he moved to stars, leaving them dim in his wake, their energies sapped to the limit.

News of Lucifer's devastating conquest reverberated across the universe, eventually reaching the primogenitors.

Together, they confronted Lucifer, their combined power threatening to shake the very cosmos.

However, the reborn demon lord, now endowed with unparalleled strength, stood his ground.

The ensuing clash was cataclysmic, a tempest of clashing powers that twisted and warped the surrounding universe.

One by one, the primogenitors fell before Lucifer's unstoppable might. Lord Osiris, with. his power over mortality, was reduced to dust.

Lord Quetzalcoatl, a symbol of life and growth, wilted and decayed under Lucifer's touch.

Lady Sphinx crumbled, grains dispersing into the endless void. Fenrir's chilling form melted away, and Lady Yggdrasil's verdant life force withered and browned.

With each defeat, Lucifer grew stronger, their fallen essences absorbed and integrated into his own...The universe trembled under his might as he claimed dominion overall.

In time, the cosmos fell under Lucifer's ironclad rule, its countless celestial bodies bending to his indomitable will.

His conquest was complete, and the universe was turned into his kingdom, a realm of darkness presided over by a monarch of unparalleled might: Lucifer, the ascended Demon God!

As Lucifer finally decided to take a break and sit on his throne to enjoy the fruits of his labor, memories of the past war-filled millennials surfaced in his mind.

"This happened exactly the same as my mother told me." Lucifer showed a pleased smile, "The moment I merge with my other half and ascend to my godhood, not a single being would be able to stop me."

"I just didn't expect those self-proclaimed gods to be slain so easily." Lucifer sneered, "What a joke."

It took him merely a few thousand years to completely conquer the universe and enslave everyone on it.

With him sucking purities out of millions of celestial bodies, primogenitors, and trillions of innocent lives, the universe might have been turned a bit quieter, but his strength could be said to have reached the final barrier...The barrier between a primogenitor and a Unigin.

With Lucifer's insane ambition, there was no way he was going to settle down like this for the rest of his life.

"I will be the true owner of the universe only after I deal with its guardians." Lucifer smiled coldly.

Although his confidence was brimming, Lucifer still understood that unigins were a different entity than primogenitors and he needed help from his mother to break past that wall.

So, after relaxing for less than a couple of days,Lucifer embarked on a journey back to the Darkness Well.

'Mother, as you have seen, I haven't disappointed you...The universe is now ours.' Lucifer said with a caring tone, something he never demonstrated to anyone before.

Even more, he was sitting in a meditation position with his head lowered in respect before the darkness well.

'Very good, my son, very good. His mother praised him with a proud tone, making Lucifer feel a tint of warmness in his frozen solid heart.

'But I still think this isn't over yet.' Lucifer stated coldly, 'I have done nothing but eradicate the primogenitors' pests, which the universe didn't want in the first place. I feel like the only way to truly rule over the universe is by getting rid of the guardians of the laws.'

'That's not easy.' His mother advised, "The guardians of laws are considered immortal beings for a reason. Even if you killed them, the universe would give birth to new ones in time. With their memories aligning together with their past selves, they will come for you.'

'It doesn't matter, I can just kill them again and keep killing them until the universe decides to bestow me with the freedom to rule it to maintain its integrity.' Lucifer requested, 'But to do that, I need to find out a way to break past the unigins' barrier and become as strong as them.'

"Unfortunately, that's impossible.' His Mother said.

'You always said that there is nothing as impossible.' Lucifer frowned.

'I lied.'

'But you never lie to me, you feel that's beneath you.' Lucifer's frown deepened, 'What happened to you, Mother?'

The voice from the other side kept to itself for a long while, which made Lucifer even more agitated and confused about the situation.

Crack!!! Crack!!!

The instant a single thought of suspicion had taken root in his mind, glass-shattering noise echoed in his mind like mirrors falling on the ground‚Ä¶

When he started looking around him, the mighty halls of his conquered kingdom seemed to have cracks on them.

The infinite cosmos seemed so close to him like he was merely sitting in a four- dimensional glass cube with cracks on its walls.

'What the hell is going on...'

A strange dread gripped him, an icy shiver curling around his heart... The universe seemed to sway, spinning out of control. His realm, his victory, his conquest - everything wavered like a mirage in the scorching desert heat. It was as if reality itself was shattering, breaking apart under the immense weight of his pride!

Then it happened.

The illusion that was his conquest crumbled into dust, and reality crashed down around him.

The feeling was akin to plunging from the highest pinnacle of celestial glory into the coldest abyss of mortal despair.

The palatial throne room with its grotesque grandeur, the unending sea of his damned followers, the primogenitors' corpses floating in the sea of nothingness, and the millions of stars and planets dimmed down, all vanished into nothingness...

The reality, stark and unwavering, rose up to greet him. His eyes were finally opened to the sight of a bleak farming field under a crimson sky.

A recognizable environment from thousands of years ago, as he could never forget the day of his triumph over Felix and ascension to godhood.

And there, standing before him, was Felix.

Unharmed. Unscathed. Not a single scratch marred his visage.

When he turned around and saw his three subordinates giving Felix murderous glares like the first time they had met, he couldn't help but open his mouth, but no words came out...

He merely turned to stare back at Felix and shared a moment of silence, seemingly trying his best to make sense of this impossible scene.

The triumph in his heart turned to ashes, replaced by a sudden, all-consuming realization.

"It was all a dream, a fantasy..." He murmured under his breath, making Lokaka and the two dragons' heads give him weird looks.

"My Lord?"

Lucifer ignored their calls as his mind was consumed with a single thought... He had been dreaming a bitter fantasy, and now he was awake.

"How...?"

Lucifer asked against his own will. His question targeted Felix as he knew it was his own doing.

"Just like in your fantasy, you refused to answer my questions. So, there is no point in sharing my answers with you." Felix replied calmly.

Before Lucifer or his baffled subordinate could react to his statement, Felix turned around and walked away.

"Where the f*ck you think you're going?!"

When Lokaka realized that his lord was out of it, he took it upon himself to stop Felix from escaping.

He pointed his antennas in his direction and attempted to cast a spatial freezing ability to keep Felix in place.

"I have gotten all I need from you."

Felix didn't even bother to turn around...He merely murmured with a low voice, but it was carrying a sense of undeniable authority.

"Totality Collapse,"

The atmosphere around him thickened, a tangible weight pressing down upon the entire realm.

His feet dug into the cracked ground beneath him as the essence of his being started to resonate with the very fabric of existence.

Then, he lifted his hands, palms upturned towards the heavens and the hells, and the resonance amplified.

RUMBLE! RUMBLE!!

Reality stuttered, shivering under the weight of his power. The ground began to crack open, vast chasms spreading out from beneath his feet!

Overhead, the sky roared in agony, seeming to tear apart at its very seams. A cataclysmic symphony of destruction resonated, its melody heralding the end of everything!!ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

Reality itself trembled as gravity, time, and space were drawn into the maelstrom of Felix's power!

Lucifer and his subordinates could only watch in horrified awe as their existence started to crumble.

Stones and debris started lifting off the ground, losing their gravity and floating toward the epicenter of the collapse.

Time distorted, stretching and compressing in wild fluctuations. Space itself seemed to warp and twist, a surreal painting by a maddened artist!

A final, deafening crack echoed out as the sky shattered entirely, revealing nothing but an all-encompassing, eternal darkness.

It was an abyss, an endless void, swallowing everything that once was.

The ground, too, finally gave in, crumbling into nothingness and leaving them suspended in the infinite dark.

The Totality Collapse had completed its course.

All that remained was Felix, standing amidst the void, the eternal darkness mirroring the determined emptiness in his eyes.

Around him, Lucifer and his subordinates were gone, along with their illusions of universal conquest.

Their existences were utterly erased from reality...
