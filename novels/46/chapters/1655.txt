Chapter 1656 The Second Round! VIII (The End)

1656 The Second Round! VIII (The End)

"First, put some respect to my name." Felix frowned coldly, "Secondly, you have taken my home."

In Felix's eyes, without Asna, his partner in crime and the love of his life by his side, he had no home to go back to...

Through Felix's cold and defensive demeanor, Eris was able to notice his sincere emotions as he had meant every word he said.

"Interesting...If I may ask, does she share the same love as you?" Eris inquired with a tone tinted with a bit of intrigue, "I was always under the impression that unigins are incapable of 'love'...We are above such a mere chemical reaction as we can control it as we please. If 'love' can be manipulated, doesn't that take its value?"

"So, are you little ones truly in love with each other?" She pressed, her eyes had the same glitter as Lady Sphinx's whenever she was interested in a subject.

While Felix was a bit taken aback by her desire for a conversation instead of getting rid of him, he had no intentions of shushing her.

He had to buy time until his main finished with the devouring process and she was doing him a favor by giving him such a chance.

Alas, before he could open his lips and engage with her, she seemed to have seen through his motives easily.

She shook her head and said, "I don't think I will get a genuine and truthful response if your mind is focused on something else."

"Let's fix that, shall we?"

With a subtle, deliberate motion, she flipped a single page of the mysterious tome. G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

As the page turned, the letters inscribed upon it shimmered with an otherworldly light, a visual symphony of order and chaos intertwined.

For a fleeting moment, the script seemed to dance and twist upon the page, morphing into shapes and patterns that defied comprehension.

This was no ordinary text; it was the written embodiment of the fundamental forces that Eris commanded!

At her command, the reality around her and Felix began to undergo a profound transformation.

The air shimmered like a mirage, and the very fabric of space seemed to warp and bend...A surreal distortion enveloped them, altering the landscape into something unrecognizable.

Gravity fluctuated erratically, causing objects to float and then suddenly plummet. Time seemed to stretch and compress, moments elongating into eternities before snapping back!

The elemental forces present in the environment behaved unpredictably, fire freezing, water burning, and light casting shadows!!

Felix caught amid this altered reality, found himself in a world where all conventional understanding was turned on its head!

Eris, the orchestrator of this chaos, observed the effects with a detached curiosity, her expression unreadable behind the lenses of her glasses.

The world around her was her canvas, and she painted with broad strokes of order and disorder, creating a landscape that was both bewildering and mesmerizing.

'What's going on?'

Suddenly, Felix's expression changed for the worse after realizing that his spiritual connection with his main had been cut off!

He could no longer communicate with his main or other wisps...What's worse? The link between him and Asna's core was severed too, which implied his main consciousness was cut off from fuel!

The moment this happened, the real Felix felt the severance akin to a rope being snapped in his soul.

His reaction was the same as his clone, incapable of believing what had just transpired.

His reaction was an understatement.

'Did I just lose my clone? No, did I just lose a part of my soul?'

He sensed like his clone was no longer related to him and that the portion of his soul that controlled it was gone with it.

He had no clue whether he got killed or captured and it f*cked with his mind, which left a small opening for Hephaestus to take advantage of.

'Chance...'

Alas, before Hephaestus could commit, he got smashed in the face with a flaming knee, breaking his nose into pieces and sending his teeth flying everywhere!

Opening or not, Felix was at a point of strength where even his mistakes could be corrected instantly!

Still, Felix realized that he couldn't put his focus on his clone at the moment.

'The other unigins must be rushing here at their top speed.' Felix frowned coldly, 'I have to end this fight with whatever is left of my celestial energy and retain some for my escape.'

Aware that his reserves were dwindling, Felix knew he required to adapt his strategy and conclude the battle with Hephaestus swiftly.

With a grim determination, Felix adjusted the intensity of his celestial flames.

He reduced their brilliance, conserving the precious energy that remained. This decision, while necessary, meant relinquishing some of his overwhelming advantage.

The flames, though less intense, still flickered around him.

To compensate for this reduction, Felix unleashed a newfound ferocity in his physical attacks!

Bam!! Bam!! Thud!!...

Each punch and kick was delivered with even greater violence, a raw display of brute strength!

Still, Hephaestus, sensing the shift in the tide of battle, discovered another glimmer of opportunity amidst his dire circumstances.

'I have to buy time to keep him here!!'

He saw how his peers took off for his rescue with Zeus' assistance and understood that with his speed, he would arrive here in less than two seconds, which was in unigins' senses, two minutes or so.

"AAAAAAAARGHHH!!!"

So, he roared at the top of his lungs furiously and began trading blows with Felix, using every ounce of his being to fight back!

Alas, even with the celestial flames' intensity lowered and the gap in their power bridged by a bit, it was nowhere enough to rival Felix in his current form.

After all, the celestial flames weren't the only thing enhancing Felix's strength, he had multiple symbols at work.

This caused Felix's relentless assault to continue unabated, each strike bringing Hephaestus closer to his inevitable defeat through the roars and his desperate last attempts...

This was not a movie where screaming and last-ditch efforts could magically turn the tide around...If he had the option to escape, then maybe, but with Asna's core glued to his, he was going nowhere without Felix.

This sealed his fate, now, and forever...

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"

With one wretched scream that broke the sound barrier, Hephaestus's core, the very essence of his divine being, inexorably devoured by Asna's core at last.

The last bit of it was consumed and Asna's core dimmed down and returned inside Felix, uncaring about The god of the forge, whose soul seemed to have left his rocky body.

Hephaestus, now a mere shell of his former self, faced Felix with a mix of resignation and a faint glimmer of hope.

As Hephaestus gathered the remnants of his courage to plead for his life, his eyes conveyed a depth of emotion that spoke of regret, fear, and a desperate wish to survive.

He knew that as long as his core was within Asna's, he had no control over it, which in turn, created his existence subjected to Felix's mercy.

In this moment of vulnerability, he sought to appeal to whatever mercy might reside in Felix's heart.

"I...I..."

"Save your breath."

But before Hephaestus could articulate his plea, Felix acted.

With a cold and resolute expression, he delivered a final, devastating punch straight to Hephaestus's heart!

The force of the blow was catastrophic, piercing through the god's body, and emerging from the other side.

This act was not just a physical strike; it was a symbolic end to their bitter rivalry and a return of favor to how he killed his other clone.

"You...Will...Regret...This...I...Will...Return...Remember...Me...Remember...

"

As the last word left Hephaestus's mouth, Felix cast him aside like a discarded relic of a bygone era.

The god's body, devoid of its core, began to disintegrate, succumbing to the reality of its mortality.

The once mighty figure of Hephaestus crumbled, turning into black ashes carried away by an unseen wind...Each particle that drifted into the air was a poignant reminder of the impermanence of even the mightiest beings.

As Felix watched Hephaestus's ashes scattered into the distance, he couldn't help but mutter to himself while activating his greed laws, "Are you watching, Asna? I am coming, step by step, but I am coming...Just be patient with me, for I will never forsake you..."

As the unigins created an appearance near the battlefield, the last sentence of Felix was the only thing they managed to obtain from this confrontation...Echoing in their ears loudly as they watched the scathing ashes of their peer with deep frowns.

They traded knowing gazes with each other as it finally dawned upon them that Felix wasn't a child who lost his way and came here, but someone with an agenda, someone who would not let anything stop him from achieving it, even if it meant massacring all the unigins in the kingdom!

"We might need to rethink our plans and motives from this hunt. The Paragon has created it clear that he is coming for anyone who stands in his path." Athena uttered with a solemn tone as she eyed her peers, "So, are we going to free his path or reinforce our blockade?"

"What's your choice?"
