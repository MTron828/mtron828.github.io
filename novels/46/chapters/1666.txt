1667 Exploring The True Potential of Seven The Sins Laws. III

"That's the one."

Felix praised as he watched a fox-like green aura surrounding Nimo while the symbol itself was manifested above his head.

"Show me what you got!"

Whoosh! Whoosh!!

As they commenced their spar, Felix could sense a change in Nimo. The boy's usual calculated approach was replaced by a more aggressive and reckless style.

With each successful block and counter, Nimo's confidence surged, fueled by the symbol's power!

His eyes, a vivid shade of green, betrayed the influence of the Avarice Amplifier Symbol, its power enhancing his physical capabilities in real-time, reflecting his growing desire for strength and victory!

Nimo's attacks became faster, stronger, and more unpredictable. The air around him seemed to crackle with raw energy, each strike carrying the weight of his burgeoning greed for power!

'Interesting, the enhancement was extraordinary, but the influence on the mind is too much.'

Felix, observing the transformation, recognized the signs of the symbol's darker influence.

Nimo's technique was devolving into something wild, uncontrolled, and barbaric, far removed from the disciplined approach he had been taught.

Thuud!!!

Felix parried another wildly thrown punch, stepping back to gauge Nimo's condition.

"Nimo, focus!" He called out, attempting to break through the haze of greed clouding his judgment.

"Fol Victolly!!!!"

But Nimo seemed lost to the symbol's allure, his attacks growing more frenzied with each passing moment...Even his speech was hindered greatly.

With a swift motion, Felix disengaged, putting some distance between them.

"Nimo, stop!" He commanded, his voice imbued with enough force to momentarily break through Nimo's frenzied state. "Look at yourself. This isn't what I have just taught you."

Nimo paused, his breathing heavy, as the green in his eyes began to fade.

The realization of his loss of control dawned on him, the wildness in his gaze giving way to confusion and then to shame.

He looked down at his hands, as if seeing them for the first time, the symbol's glow dimming with his waning aggression.

"Sorry, daddy! I sorry..."

The notion of disappointing his father brought tears to his eyes.

Felix wiped his tears and said with a gentle tone, "The Avarice Amplifier Symbol is a powerful tool, but it demands respect and restraint. Greed, unchecked, can lead to ruin. Today, you learned that power must be wielded with wisdom, not just desire...This applies to everything."

Nimo nodded, the lesson etched deeply in his mind.

"I... I didn't realize. sorry,"

Felix smiled faintly, recognizing the value in the lesson learned. "It's alright, this is part of your journey. Understanding your desires and learning to master them is as important as any physical training."

For Felix, this was a reminder of his responsibility as a mentor and a father, guiding Nimo not just towards physical prowess but towards becoming a balanced and wise wielder of the sins laws.

He acknowledged that the seven sins laws were capable of ruining someone's personality, leading him down a horrible path if misused.

He was an adult when he ascended and still found it difficult to control his desires sometimes...Don't even mention a child with a blank slate.

Thus, Felix didn't hold back in his teachings.

Sometime later...

"You did well today, Nimo," Felix said, pride evident in his voice.

"Daddy most powerful!" Nimo beamed, his respect for his father deepening after each spar.

"I still have to get much stronger to save your mother." Felix said as he touched him on the head, "So, go spend some time with Candace until I am done with work."

"I help Daddy save Mommy!" Nimo proclaimed with his fangs protruding in anger.

"You already helped me enough today."

Felix meant every word as he had managed to deepen his understanding of the creation of new symbols through their spar.

After some other reassuring words, Nimo took off with a wide smile and a glimmer of excitement in his eyes, seeking to show Candace and the rest what he learned.

"Phew, children sure are a handful." Felix chuckled to himself as he returned to his seated position.

"Avarice Amplifier seemed to have enhanced Nimo's strength by 20% or even 30% before he started losing control." Lady Sphinx analyzed, "You might receive a much bigger enhancement."

"Let's test it out."

As Felix activated the symbol, a vibrant, fox-like aura enveloped him, its ethereal tails swirling around his form like flames.

He could feel the surge of strength coursing through his veins, each muscle fiber tensing with newfound vigor.

His senses sharpened, the world around him coming into focus with unprecedented clarity. The power was intoxicating, seductive in its intensity!

+10%...+20%...+30%...+40%...+50%!

With every passing second, Felix felt the boost in his strength, agility, and elemental prowess climbing, reaching a staggering +50% all- ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

rounded enhancement!

But with this ascension came a barrage of greedy thoughts, whispering promises of endless power and urging him to seek more, always more. Why stop here? Imagine what you could achieve with even greater strength... You could reshape the world, bend it to your will... No one could stand against you...

Those thoughts assaulted him nonstop, causing Felix to struggle to maintain his focus, the symbol's influence tugging at the edges of his mind, tempting him to succumb to the greed that powered it.

He could feel the fox-like aura pulsing, its glow intensifying with his growing desires.

Gritting his teeth, Felix fought against the tide of greed, reminding himself of the symbol's true cost.

He knew that yielding to these desires would only lead to his downfall, ensnaring him in a cycle of insatiable hunger for power that could never be satisfied!

'Enough is enough!'

With a Herculean effort, Felix reined in the greedy thoughts, the fox-

like aura beginning to dissipate as he regained control.

Huff huff...

Breathing heavily, he took a moment to reflect on the experience.

"It's indeed a potent symbol, but wielding it required an unimaginable level of discipline and mental fortitude.." Felix commented while wiping his sweaty forehead.

"It seems like 40% to 50% is your current limitation." Lady Sphinx remarked.

"If utilized with his other enhancement symbols, like I am Supreme, Rampage, and such, the boost will be much deadlier," Thor added.

"I doubt it." Felix shook his head, "Don't forget that my other enhancing symbols require conditions and have their limitations. I can't defend I am supreme symbol if I am fighting against my thoughts and the rampage symbol already messes with my mind a bit through rage. I can't add greed too in a critical battle that requires complete concentration."

In other words, Felix acknowledged that if he went and decided to stack up all the enhancement symbols at once, the side effects would also stack up and might ruin his battle.

"If only there was a way to combine the symbols into a much more potent symbol to limit the drawbacks," Felix murmured.

Upon saying this, his gaze quickly shifted towards Lilith. He observed a faint smile on her lips, which she quickly concealed.

"You...Is this the next level you were talking about?" Felix asked with an eager look.

He had already tried to combine and merge symbols before through willing it, but the symbols refused to budge. He gave up on the thought, believing that it might be impossible.

But now? Knowing that Lilith verified there was a next level of sins manipulation, he had to revisit this idea.

Alas, Lilith merely shrugged her shoulders as a response, "Beats me."

"..."

Felix's eyelids twitched...He understood that Lilith had no intentions of helping him explore the next level of manipulation unless he succeeded in the challenge.

At least, he was now confident that merging symbols was a viable option.

"Let's continue with the creation of the symbols." Felix held his chin thoughtfully, "What's next? Should I try to merge the heat-based sins with a sin? I might be able to create a whole new symbol."
