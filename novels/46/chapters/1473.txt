1474 Wickedness and Evil even In The Afterlife...

Sharky was left stunned at the amount of evidence in their possession...While he couldn't read everything, he saw that many of the shown evidence were heavily related to Mr. Atticus.

This...

"Save it for the court." Captain Charleson interrupted him and put his hands in handcuffs behind his back.

As the squad prepared to leave, the weight of the situation seemed to hit Sharky. The powerful and respected warden was now just another criminal in chains

He looked at Captain Charleson, anger and confusion evident in his eyes. "You'll regret this, Charleson. Trust me, you will regret this

Captain Charleson met his gaze, unwavering. "Justice always finds its way, and if I have wronged you, I am ready to accept the punishment.

"Heh, wronged him? You are too soft captain. With what we know, he deserves to be buried ten meters under a wasteland." Hazel sneered in disgust as she pushed Sharky forward, almost causing him to trip.

Sharky merely gave her a deathly glare and remained silent, knowing that nothing he said or did at the moment was going to help him.

Unfortunately, he couldn't even reach out to the other top heads for assistance...His device had been confiscated and he was too far for a telepathic conversation.

"Clear out the entire mansion...I will escort the captured back to the department." Captain Charleson ordered.

Felix and the others nodded in understanding and spread out using their ethereal forms, allowing them to move through surfaces.

'I will take downstairs.' Felix said after picking up vibrational energies deep underground.

When Sharky turned around and saw Felix disappearing through the ground, his expression couldn't help but turn ugly.

'I am f*cked!'

The fact that he was arrested meant that a judge had approved of an arrest warrant after seeing the evidence stacked against him.

But, to approve a search warrant was much more strict and this made him understand the evidence in their ownership must be pretty damning!

With his mansion being searched, it was only going to get worse for him.

...

'Where is she?' Felix frowned as he searched for Carbuncle's wife.

He prioritized her more than anything at the moment and ever since he stepped into the mansion, he was searching for her.

Right now, he was walking down a long twisted flight of stairs, which seemed to be heading into the depth of an abyss.

Descending the stone steps, Felix felt a chilling draft that seemed to intensify with each step, as if the air was thick with despair.

The chaotic intense vibrational waves coming from below didn't make him feel any better about this exploration.

Soon, he found himself at the bottom with a wooden gate closed shut. Felix went through it with his guard raised to the limit.

When he saw a dim corridor on the other side, he ventured deeper and deeper.

'Hmmm?'

Suddenly, the faint sound of whimpering reached his ears the closer he got to the end of the corridor.

When he turned a corner, Felix was met with a gruesome sight: a vast hall, with walls lined with chains and shackles, each holding a spirit...

Machines, tubes, and strange devices were connected to each spirit, extracting their energies into dark crystals that pulsated with a foreboding glow.

The floor beneath them was stained with ethereal blood and tears.

Felix's heart pounded loudly as anger boiled inside him...He had no idea what he was looking at, but he didn't like it one bit.

Even his cold heart was starting to get heated from rage the more he watched those spirits get utterly tortured.

"Help me...It hurts...Sob, please...Help."

"I ca...n't...stand it...any longer...Officer...Hel..."

"Ughh..."

When the nearest spirits saw Felix's outfit and realized that he was a law enforcer, a spark of hope emerged in their bloodshot eyes.

Some begged with tears flooding down their cheeks and some gave him a mere pleading look, either too exhausted to speak or had their tongues pierced by metal spikes...

The sight was absolutely horrendous and Felix never expected in his life to see such wickedness and evil in the afterlife...

"I will free you all. Hang in there."

Felix's unconcerned voice wasn't pleasant to the ears at all, but at this instant, all the spirits who heard it, felt like it was the most angelic melodious voice they had ever heard...

Whosh! Whoosh!

He swiftly moved through the dungeon, using a flaming blade to cut the chains and free each spirit.

He placed them gently on the ground and gave them medication pills to enhance their recovery.

Some were too weak to stand, and others clung to him like toddlers holding onto their mothers for safety and protection...

"I won't leave you...Just close your eyes and take a rest..." Felix promised softly as he caressed their hands until exhaustion finally got into them.

'Guys, request for reinforcement immediately and come down here.' Felix said coldly as he continued freeing the spirits.

'What did you find?' Ravager asked.

'A dungeon full of tortured spirits.' Felix reported indifferently, not softening the blow even a bit.

His squadmates' hearts chilled akin to being thrown into a bucket of ice...Knowing Felix's nonplayful personality made them understand that he wasn't joking with them.

'On our way.'

Without waiting for their arrival, Felix continued moving further in his save mission.

Suddenly, his feet froze in their place after spotting a familiar face in the corner of his eyes.

Stunned, he slowly turned his head until he was faced with a chained and beaten-up small creature reminiscent of a humanoid hamster, covered in soft fur that had turned filthy and matted from neglect...

A large, once radiant, gem rested on her forehead, but it now looked dull, clouded by the pain and suffering she had endured.

Two shimmering, crystalline wings extended from her back, though they were no longer their usual radiant hue.

Instead, they were fractured in places, with edges chipped and splintered...

'Carbuncle's wife...'

Felix kept staring at her without a single blink, his mind went blank at the horrific thought that his elder watched his wife getting tortured at the hands of Sharky without the ability to save her.

'Elder...'

He glanced up, his eyes as cold as ever, but the look he was giving was full of sorrow and sympathy.

He had a feeling that Elder Carbuncle was watching him and his assumption was correct.

Carbuncle stood in his dim office, staring intently into a large, ornate spiritual mirror.

The surface of the mirror shimmered like liquid silver, and within its depths, the scene of Felix discovering his wife in Sharky's dungeon played out.

The soft glow from the mirror illuminated Carbuncle's face, which was an amalgamation of contradictory emotions.

His large eyes, usually twinkling with joy and mirth, were now clouded with pain.

They welled up with tears, but not a single drop spilled, reflecting his determination to remain composed.

His whiskers drooped in sadness. Yet, amidst this profound sadness, there was a gentleness in his gaze‚Äîa hallmark of his ever-present kindness.

Even in this moment of deep personal anguish, he didn't let the darkness take away his inherent warmth.

"Bring her home, son. Bring her home..."

Carbuncle murmured as he watched Felix approach her, offering words of comfort and comfort. The sight of his dear junior taking care of his wife filled Carbuncle's heart with gratitude.CHùíÜCk for ùíèew stùíêries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Carbuncle's wife looked up as Felix approached, her eyes red and swollen, filled with both fear and hope.

A pained smile tugged at her lips, realizing that her suffering and anguish were finally going to be put to an end.

Seeing her in this state, Felix felt a surge of anger and desolation, a powerful mix that made him clench his fists.

"It will be alright, no one is ever going to hurt you again, no one..."

He moved closer, whispering promises of save and retribution, knowing that the moment she reunited with her husband, no one would dare lay a finger on her again.

When Carbuncle saw that Felix had fed her medicine and put her to sleep after covering her body, he closed his eyes for a short moment.

Then, he whispered softly, "Thank you, little one...Thank you..."
