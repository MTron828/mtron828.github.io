1319 The War For The Universe. III

Eee Eee?

Even Nimo was confused as he was certain that he had imprisoned Lucifer in his void cell, but after looking at it again, he found out that it was empty!

"Save us the trouble and just sit down." Lucifer said, "I can't be killed or trapped regardless of what you do."

'How did he do that? I thought demon princes need some of their DNA and plenty of evil energy to revive themselves?' Asna inquired.

Felix planned to capture Lucifer in the void realm instead of killing him, knowing that he would be revived somewhere else if he did.

But, he didn't expect that he would escape from another dimension without raising a single alarm!

"He must have a bit of evil energy and DNA in the cockpit, enabling him to get revived.' Felix reasoned with a solemn expression as he stared at the nonchalant Lucifer, 'This is the only explanation available.'

Eee Eee?

Nimo asked for permission to end Lucifer's life this time with his own measures and Felix allowed him to go all out.

Nimo showed an evil diabolical grin as his eyes turned crimson while staring at Lucifer.

Void particles had made their insidious ingress into his form, a horrifying invasion, invisible to the eye yet felt all too keenly.

They began consuming him, as a wave of discomfort cascaded through his powerful physique.

The initial unease turned to pain, a gnawing sensation that surged into every corner of his being, leaving no cell untouched!

He was being eaten from the inside out as Nimo had used his void laws to create void particles straightaway within Lucifer's cells!

If it was the void element manipulation, this would be impossible as there were rules and laws that had to be respected.

But when it came to laws themselves? It was more than possible as Nimo was literally able to break those laws of void and could create them whenever and wherever he desired.

"Void Laws...How can it be...You..."

Before Lucifer could finish his sentence, his entire body was erased from existence, leaving absolutely not a single particle of his DNA behind.

"Good job." Felix praised Nimo. "It will be impossible for that bastard to appear near this area again unless he left his DNA around."

Felix had no plans to stay in the same place and check out if he was right or not... Alas, just as he was about to control his spaceship to take off into the distance, a sudden pressuring aura befell Felix, causing him to remain frozen in his place.

Lucifer manifested in front of Felix from a tiny crimson particle, leaving him unable to take his eyes off the process.

"Enough is enough." Lucifer uttered with an icy tone the moment his form was fully created.

This time even Felix's masters were taken back as his revival made absolutely no sense in their eyes.

'It's too fast, way too fast to be realistic...Not even Manananggal could be revived this quickly.' Thor commentated with a serious tone.

'He wasn't making sense from the get-go." J√É¬∂rmungandr remarked.

The tenants approved of his take immediately.

Lucifer's ability to create and cover an entire space battlefield with evil energy from such a long distance was already something that should be in the realm of primogenitors.Alll ùíçùíÇtest novùíÜlùíî on novelbùíän/(.)cùíêm

Now, he showed them that he could get revived without requiring DNA or a respectable amount of evil energy and do it in less than a split second. It was normal to catch their attention.

"I am done wasting time with you." Lucifer eyed Felix coldly and asked one last time, "Are you going to meet me or not?"

After everything that Lucifer had shown, even if Felix wasn't in the Elementals Galaxy and wanted to meet him, he would think deeply about it.

However, after Lucifer had demonized an entire battlefield in less than a minute, Felix understood that if he didn't give him an answer that would please him, he would take it on the SGAlliance's army.

"Alright, I will meet you." Felix paused for a moment before adding with a serious tone, "But, I decide the time and location."

"Speak."

"Five Decades from now and the location is your capital planet. But, you must not participate in the war."

Felix disclosed his condition even though he still had no clue what the hell Lucifer wanted with him.

But at that moment in time, Felix wouldn't care too much as he would be strong enough to fight even primogenitors.

Five decades translated to five thousand years, which was enough time for him to master plenty of new stuff while also ascending to a deity.

"Five decades?" Lucifer sneered, "You have a month, nothing more, nothing less."

"A month?" Felix's expression turned ugly.

He barely finished a year in the Elementals Galaxy and now he was asked to leave it right away?

Felix just couldn't accept the deal as it would literally ruin his entire future and there would be no more chances of entering the galaxy ever again.

'You must not do it! Thor frowned, 'Even if you accepted the deal and met with him after a month, it would be too dangerous. I have a feeling that this demon has somehow transcended to a deity level.

'A deity level? That can't be right?' Felix was stunned.

Although Lucifer had demonstrated an uncanny level of strength that made his brothers look like lesser demons, Felix still didn't put a deity label on him.

After all, being a deity was more than just manipulation range and strength.

Use Nimo's spiritual pressure to confirm it. Elder Kraken suggested.

Felix did as he was told, knowing that Nimo's current spiritual pressure was on par with primogenitors due to being separate from his stronger half.

If they were together, he would have had a unigin spiritual pressure that was capable of pressuring even primogenitors.

Eee Eee!

After Nimo released his spiritual pressure on Lucifer and it didn't work on him in the slightest, it made Felix's heart skip a beat and his complexion turn paler.

Even the tenants were startled after receiving confirmation of their doubts.

"I guess you are still not taking me seriously." Lucifer stood up and said with a cold tone, "Don't bother coming to me I will be finding you myself and taking your weird pet with me."

The moment he finished speaking, Lucifer disappeared from the cockpit.

"This can't be good." Asna commented.

"An unkillable furious deity-level demon in a war between mortals?! No sh*t!"

Felix didn't let his emotions get the best of him as he knew that Lucifer would most definitely do whatever it took to meet with him!

The easiest method was clearly forcing Felix out by punishing his people!

"Commander Nethrael! Evacuate all the people from Revia N1 and order a mass retreat!" Felix shouted with an agitated tone.

"Grand Supreme, I can't do..." Commander Nethrael was stunned.

"I have no time to explain, just do it!!"

"As you command."

Although Commander Nethrael needed such an important order to be confirmed through the inner circle leaders beforehand, he ignored the protocol and went for it.

In his eyes, if there was something capable of freaking out even the Grand Supreme, then he should be horrified.

Just as he was about to announce the order, his subordinate reported with a shocked tone, "Commander! A demon has invaded the mothership...He oddly looks like our grand supreme."

"Is it him?"

When Commander Nethrael looked at the monitor and saw Lucifer in his blood and flesh floating in the direction of the Mothership's core area, he couldn't help but feel chills course in his spine.

The first thing he did was report the matter to Felix as he had a bad feeling that his previous orders must be related to him.

"This monster...The mothership is at least a million kilometers away from here...A million kilometers..."

With a wide-eyed stare, Felix's face was a canvas painted with pure, unadulterated fear...His eyes were pools of terror, the usual vibrant hues subdued to a dull gray.

It had been a long while since Felix felt such a level of fear as even the darkins seemed killable and handleable.
