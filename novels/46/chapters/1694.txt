Chapter 1695 The Last Dance. III

Ôªø1695 The Last Dance. III

They had no clue that their peers were killed since the dreamrealm was under Felix's commands and no one could peer through it.

The universe didn't announce their death since it had already occurred with Hephaestus and they decided to blow themselves up...The universe would never announce such a thing.

"Child, you have been pushing your luck a bit too much."

Meanwhile, the first ruler, sensing the impending catastrophe, acted with divine swiftness, conjuring a majestic golden sword from the ether, a weapon of pure divinity aimed to intercept and neutralize the cataclysmic explosion by erasing the puppet.

Yet, in a moment of sacrificial defiance, Felix positioned himself directly in the sword's path!

"Veil of Pride! Indestructible Will! Concetrated Void Shield! Sun's Protection! Celestial Black/White Flames!"

Felix summoned every last ounce of his power to erect a series of formidable shields around him, each one a testament to his determination to protect what he held dear!

The divine golden sword, a weapon that radiates with the fury of the cosmos itself, descended upon him with a might that seemed to bend reality itself!

Kaa-thuud!!!

With a deafening roar, the barriers erected by Felix begin to falter under the sword's relentless assault!

One by one, they shattered into nothingness, their fragments disappearing into the ether as if they were never there.

The sword, unyielding and precise, continued its forceful penetration, now mere inches from Felix's outstretched hands!

"Argh..."

A scream tore through the silence, a raw expression of pain and defiance, as the tip of the sword made contact with Felix's flesh.

It pierced through his hands with a force that seemed to echo through the ages, then continued its merciless path until it found his chest.

Pssss!!

Blood blossomed forth, painting a stark contrast against the ethereal glow of the sword, dripping slowly from the corners of Felix's mouth...

The golden sword might not seem like a lot, but it was a concentrated divine attack that could be said to be much more powerful than that divine palm!

Even with everything in Felix's arsenal used to block it, it still failed short, demonstrating the chasm between them in strength.

Yet, amidst the agony and the encroaching shadow of death, a faint grin played across Felix's lips.UppTodatùíÜd frùíêm n√¥/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

With a voice strained by pain but undimmed in its resolve, and gentle eyes affixed on the frozen expression of his beloved, he whispered, "Let the fireworks begin..."

As the sword completed its devastating journey, Felix's words hung in the air for a nanosecond before the promised chaos arose.

An intense beam of light, brighter than a million suns, erupts from its gaping maw, a torrent of raw, unbridled energy that raced toward Felix with the inevitability of fate itself.

The first to be consumed by this wrathful storm was him...

His figure, ensnared by the divine sword and bathed in his own blood, became the epicenter of the explosion.

Yet, that gentle grin never left his face, a smile that seemed to calm his beloved, a smile that seemed to tell her, that he would not forsake her even if he took the brunt of a million sun...

In a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity, he was erased from existence, the clone's sacrifice marking the beginning of the end.

As the blast continued its relentless expansion, it met the eternal kingdom's divine barrier, a construct that had stood unchallenged for eons.

The barrier trembled under the onslaught of the explosion, cracks forming across its surface like spiderwebs sprawling across a fragile window.

BOOOOOOOOOM!!

With a sound that reverberated through the cosmos and the hearts of the watchers, the barrier shattered, its fragments dispersing into the void...

"..."

"..."

"..."

The three rulers and the unigins watched in utter silence as the blast freed from its confines, engulfing the meteor shower of stars, each star a giant awaiting its final performance.

As they were consumed, they ignited in supernovas, a cascade of celestial fireworks that illuminated the universe with their dying light.

The spectacle was both beautiful and horrifying, a dance of destruction that painted the sky with the colors of annihilation...

Everyone knew that if this cascade of destruction were to reach the kingdom undisrupted, its glory, its history, its very essence, was going to be erased in a spectacle of light and shadow, leaving behind nothing but the echoes of a universe forever changed.

Thus, the three rulers didn't hesitate to take matters seriously at last, not caring anymore about the amount of celestial energy needed to stop this.

With a tint of lividness in their eyes, the three rulers extended their arms, desiring to confront the apocalyptic onslaught unleashed by Felix's final act.

In a desperate bid to salvage what remained of their celestial domain, they channeled their collective might into the creation of a new barrier, a bastion of hope amidst the encroaching chaos.

This barrier, unlike any before, was wrought from the essence of celestial energy, woven with the very fabric of creation itself!

It stretched across the skies, enveloping the most vital regions of the eternal kingdom in a protective embrace, while the outer reaches, now deemed expendable, were left to the mercy of the inferno!

The spectacle of the exploding stars, now a destructive symphony that threatened to erase all it touched, crashes against the newly erected shield!

BOOOOOM!!! BOOOOOM!!!...

Each impact, a burst of blinding light and unfathomable force, tested the resilience of this last defense.

The barrier trembled under the relentless assault, its luminescence flickering with the strain of containing such power.

The three rulers channeled their essence into the barrier, feeling angrier and angrier the more Celestial energy was burnt into nothingness.

Their relaxed attitude and disregard for Felix's threats had finally bitten them in the ass.

Their faces, etched with determination and the gravity of their task, reflected the monumental effort required to maintain this shield.

This compelled the rulers to devote all their focus and energy to prevent the barrier from crumbling.

"Crazy...He is crazy..."

Aeolus commentated with a dumbfounded expression as he watched the three rulers being forced to put in an actual effort.

A sight, many unigins had seen only once and coincidentally, it was related to Lilith, the previous paragon of sins!

"He has gone and done it now, he has done it now,"

Artemis repeated, knowing that the three rulers would not stop until they either locked Felix away or have his head under their feet.

That's what happened to every unigin that stood against them and their ultimate commands!

'Is this true love...' Eris murmured as she lifted her head and gazed at Asna with a hint of envy in her eyes.

She felt like her life would be complete if there was someone out there who was willing to go against the universal authority for her sake.

Alas, all she could was sigh deeply and get rid of such thoughts.

'I am not deserving of such pure love.' She smiled bitterly while lowering her gaze, understanding deep down that such love alluded her.

For she knew that no one would give her their heart unless she gave them hers first...To go that far would mean putting her absolute trust in the other person.

Unigins were simply not engineered for such action. Otherwise, they wouldn't have treated little Asna so poorly...

While everyone was deep in their thoughts at this catastrophic event, the only person enjoying this performance was Asna.

A single droplet rolled down her cheek as she gazed at her lover's final act, knowing now more than ever, that he was the sole person to love her wholeheartedly and unconditionally.

Thus, she also placed her blind trust in him without a single question in her mind or heart.

'We live together or we die together.'

While the three rulers were distracted by holding the cosmic inferno in addition to dealing with the eternal black flames, Asna reached out to Tiara on top of her head.

Then, with a look of pure love and madness, she shattered it into fragments, drawing the attention of the three rulers immediately to her!

"You brat..."

"What have you done!"

The three rulers' expressions turned for the worse slightly as they didn't fear Asna being able to escape, but the backlash that would hit her after breaking their seal in this manner!

Because she was already in a weakened state due to not having her core connected to her for a long time, the backlash came in instantly with the force of a galloping herd of basons.

This backlash was not physical but one that assailed her soul, manifesting as a tumultuous blast within the confines of her spiritual existence!

The force of the detonation sent fissures running through her soul barrier, each crack a testament to the severity of her action, and the price of defying the constraints placed upon her!

As the turmoil within escalated, Asna's physical form mirrored the torment of her soul.

Blood, a stark crimson against her pale skin, began to seep from her eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, each of the seven orifices becoming conduits for the visible manifestation of her internal suffering.

The intensity of the backlash engulfed her, stripping away her consciousness slowly and leaving her in a state of vulnerable collapse.

Cough! Cough!

Her body, now limp and marred by the traces of blood, leaned against the balcony's rail as she kept coughing large amounts of blood.

With a hazy gaze filled with despise directed at the three rulers, she uttered with great difficulty, "You wouldn't...understand...even if I told...you.."
