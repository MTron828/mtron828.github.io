Chapter 1618 Returning To Earth.

1618 Returning To Earth.

Felix now had all the tools and time to help his race establish themselves strongly and collectively in the universe, instead of relying on a couple of powerful beings to carry them.

The first thing he did was contact Noah, Olivia, Selphie, Malak, and Bodidi as he needed their help to make his vision clear.

He already had a cultivation system in mind, which was considered perfect for humans if he succeded.

"Meet me next to Earth." He left them this cryptic message and took off without bothering to explain much.

Noah and the rest made their move the moment they received his message...None of them seemed shocked by his sudden return after more than five decades.

Felix had already informed them before he took Nimo's fight, that he might be gone for a long time and they shouldn't be too concerned.

...

Sometime later...

Felix, having journeyed through realms and realities far beyond the ordinary scope of existence, was finally returning to a place that, despite its cosmic insignificance, held a deep and personal significance for him...Earth.

As Felix approached the solar system, his form, a silhouette against the backdrop of stars and planets, began decelerating.

He had traveled as a being of void particles, a formless entity moving through the cosmos, but now, as he neared his destination, he solidified back to form.

As Felix gazed upon Earth after eons, the sight of the once vibrant planet now completely enshrouded in ice sent a chill through his heart.

The massive, gaping hole in the Pacific Ocean, a dark abyss amidst the frozen expanse, stood as a haunting testament to the changes and turmoil the world had endured because of him...

'Is it possible to revive forty billion people with the greed laws?' Felix murmured to himself.

He came here with plans to return the planet back to its glorious and peaceful days...But, he couldn't help but wonder if he could revive all the lives lost in it during that apocalyptic day.

"It's possible, but only if you are considered a true unigin." Lilith anwsered with a faint curious grin, "Even then, you will be subjected to one of the most gruesome punishments you have experienced."

"..." Felix smiled bitterly.

He knew that witch anwsered him to see what his decision would be.

Would he be selfish enough to ignore remedying his mistake now that he possessed the powers necessary to make it happen...Or, he would go for it, uncaring about what would happen to him.

As for why he needed to be a unigin first? Felix knew that wishes' reach and powers were affected by the level of the being.

Djins' wishes were the most limited, Nimo came second, and then his alter ego since he possessed the core and was considered an 'awakened'...Lilith was last.

In the case of Felix, his wishes were considered on the same level as Nimo's...He possessed the paragon of sins' powers, but he had no control over the core since he wasn't a unigin yet.

So, for such ground-breaking wishes, he needed the right requirements to make the trade with the universe.

"Even if you could and you want to do it, you should drop the thought from your mind." Elder Kraken advised, "Reviving forty billion people, no, reviving just a couple thousand is enough to warrant Lord Hades' attention...Now, that he is weakened more than ever, he will see it as a sign of disrespect."

Lord Hades was a stickler for the rules and reviving anyone without his approval first was extremely disrespectful.

This was the reason he punished Lord Quetzalcoatl when he caught him later on.

While Felix was close to him, he would not permit him to resurrect that many spirits no matter what he offered him.

If it was that easy for him to bend his rules, he would have approved of at least helping Felix's grandfather and family members settle down in the heavenly plane.

"It's for the best." Felix's expression went cold as he stared above him, "Even if there were no penalties, reviving them will do nothing but give my enemies ammo to deal with me."

Felix understood that the same scenario would repeat if he revived his loved ones while still having too many powerful enemies lying await.

Getting them killed once was already too much, he would never forgive himself if he revived them and they ended up with the same fate because he couldn't protect them.

So, he decided to bring them back only after he obtained the necessary strength to protect them from anything.

"For now, Let's fix my home."

Felix looked upon the frozen Earth, its beauty marred by the gaping maw in the Pacific and the icy sheath that enveloped it.

Felix called upon the Equal Trade Symbol...As it materialized, Felix's eyes, reflecting the cold light of distant stars, were resolute as he focused on the symbol above.

The energy required for such a planetary restoration was immense, but it wouldn't go past one billion void creatures since the planet was a soulless object, which reduced complexity.

The symbol accepted the offering even with such distance between it and the void creatures.

With a brilliant glow that enveloped Earth, the planetbegan to respond.

Rumble! Rumble!!... Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

The abyss in the Pacific slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, began to close. The edges of the massive hole shifted, earth and water moving to fill the void that had scarred the planet's face.

Simultaneously, the icy sheath that covered the Earth started to recede. Glaciers melted, releasing rivers that flowed freely for the first time in millennia.

The atmosphere, once thin and fragile, thickened and warmed, clouds forming and bringing the promise of rain!

As the planet transformed, Felix watched, a mix of awe and relief in his heart.

The void creatures he had given were a small price to pay to see his home, this cradle of life, breathe and thrive once again.

The Equal Trade Symbol, its task completed, began to fade, leaving behind a world on the path to recovery.

***

While this was happening, in the austere command center of the Mariana Federation on Mars, a group of leaders huddled around a large holographic display.

The room, typically a place of order and control, was suddenly abuzz with confusion and disbelief.

As the images and videos of Earth's remarkable recovery beamed onto the screen, showing the once-frozen planet blossoming back to life, the leaders were caught completely off-guard!

"Is this some sort of trick?" Zosia Everglow demanded, her eyes narrowing as she scrutinized the images. "Earth was a frozen wasteland and it has been predicted to last like this for another thousand years before the balance returns...How could this possibly happen,"

Maganda Chief shook his head in shock. "This is unprecedented. Look at the atmosphere readings and the oceanic activity! It's as if the planet has been restored overnight."

Gabrial Lotus chimed in, "It's nothing short of a miracle..."

Murmurs of agreement and skepticism rippled through the group as they continued to watch the transformation unfold.

The images showed the once gaping abyss in the Pacific closing, the ice retreating, and life returning in a display that defied all their scientific understanding.

"Contact our teams on the ground immediately," commanded Zosia, her voice a mix of awe and determination. "We need eyes and ears on this. Verify the authenticity of these reports, and gather as much data as possible."

As the leaders sprang into action, coordinating with their teams and seeking answers, the room was filled with a newfound energy. Despite their initial shock and disbelief, there was an underlying current of excitement and wonder.

The possibility that Earth might be rotated again into the capital of the Mariana Federation was a thought that stirred something deep within each of them...Especially, when the federation now was in complete control over the entire galaxy!

"Could it be him?" Zosia murmured as images of Felix surfaced in her mind, comprehension such miracles could be related only to him. But soon, she stirred her head with a bitter smile, "He has long since been gone..."

While Felix had returned from death over a long period now, the news wasn't released to the public...Only primogenitors and Felix's friends knew about his revival.

"Whatever caused this, it's a chance to honor his death by turning Earth int..."

Before she could finish her sentence, the atmosphere in the command center dropped a couple of degrees, causing everyone to feel chills on their back.

"Is this the new center of operation? Interesting choice of decoration."

Suddenly, a familiar laid-back voice resounded in everyone's ears as clear as daylight even when the chamber was noisy.

Zosia, Maganda Chief, Gabrial, Barry, and many other old leaders and new ones went silent and rotated their heads slowly.

The moment they made half a circle, Felix came into their line of sight with a familiar humane appearance instead of his demonic one.

Whether they were close to Felix before or not, everyone's eyes widened to the limit in utter disbelief and shock.

"F...Fe...Felix..?" Maganda Chief stuttered as he pointed a shaky finger in the direction of Felix.

"It's been a while, chief." Felix grinned gently, "How is little princess bird doing?"
