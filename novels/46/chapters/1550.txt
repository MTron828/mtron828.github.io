Chapter 1551 Becoming A Bioresearcher!

Ôªø1551 Becoming A Bioresearcher!

At the moment, Felix was at the ninth dragon mark and the thirteenth devourer's mark. This meant the dragon marks enhanced his strength by 180k, while the devourer's marks helped him obtain 130k.

"Devourer marks are peaked at thirty marks while dragons are infinite." Lady Sphinx remarked, "Though, the resources required to fulfill each mark keep doubling and I don't think absorbing them like before is efficient."

"I know, I am losing a decent chunk of elemental energy since my hearts aren't optimal 100%."

Felix understood that his previous method of absorbing natural treasures and elemental minerals would no longer work in upper marks if he didn't find a way to perfect the process.

Losing 20% or 30% of resources during each absorption was a bit okay before, but in his current state, those percentages translated to thousands of rare treasures wasted.

"Master, is there a potion or divine item that can help with this problem?" Felix inquired with a serious tone.

"For divine items, you should check with Cyclope." Lady Sphinx anwsered, "As for the potions, hmmm, it's a bit tough to say."

"What do you mean?"

"Rank six potions are the potions capable of affecting primogenitors either positively or negatively. However, I have made only a dozen recipes of them since they are extremely challenging to create." Lady Sphinx clarified, "Not a single one is related to enhancing elemental energy absorption from natural treasures."

Felix always heard about rank six potions and never learned how to concoct one.

Time wasn't his ally and he was always giving his attention to other fields, which would help him receive an instant strength enhancement.

So, his potion-making had been stagnated for a long while now.

"I think it's time to learn how to create my recipes." Felix remarked, "If there isn't any, I just need to create it."

"I love the enthusiasm, but it's not going to be easy." Lady Sphinx warned, "You can't be half-hearted with this. You will spend decades if not more, experimenting and trialing unique combinations for the sake of creating the perfect recipe."

"In addition, rank six potions require only SSS+ natural treasures and materials, which are almost impossible to locate through effort. Most of the ones found were through sheer luck."

"Since you will be creating a new recipe, this means you will need to find new undiscovered SSS+ natural treasures to experiment on. I have already tried every possible combination with the discovered ones, and they gave birth to the recipes in my possession."

"This does sound a bit too difficult and heavily reliant on fortune." Felix frowned.

Felix had no problems with working hard, but to find new undiscovered SSS+ natural treasures? That's something unrelated to hard work or effort.

The only new undiscovered SSS+ natural treasure he managed to find was the dark moss in the ancestral dragon dimension, and it happened purely through chance.

Not willing to give up so easily, Felix wondered, "Is it possible to minimize the luck facture through heavy studying and using the analytic powers of my wisdom eye?"

In his eyes, he believed that it was possible to predict the existence of the super rare natural treasures and materials if he managed to study geography, history, weather, biology, evolution, and previous data of discovered SSS+ treasures, whether extinct or not.

"It's not guaranteed to work, but I believe it might help you minimize the luck factor by a small percentage." Lady Sphinx nodded

Even though the SSS+ natural treasures seemed heavily reliant on luck, they just didn't pop off randomly across the universe.

Many strict conditions needed to be fulfilled for their birth and cultivation. Felix believed that if he managed to find those conditions, it would help him predict a natural treasure's birth without knowing about it beforehand.

Though, even if he pulled this off, and there was a natural treasure at the end of his calculations, nothing guaranteed it would be a super rare one.

Many low-graded natural treasures were also born under strict conditions.

"Wait, I have illusion domain! I don't need to go out and search for natural treasures after reading data." Felix exclaimed, "With wisdom eye and enough data, I can cultivate my natural treasures in an illusionary garden and see if there is any area in the universe where their birth checks out!"

"That's quite smart." Candace praised.

In another sense, Felix would be playing the role of bioresearcher in his illusion domain, crossbreeding plants, accelerating time, feeding them with different types of elemental energy, and the list goes on.

Later on, if an SSS+ natural treasure was born in his illusion domain, he would already have the conditions and he would just need to search for a location that matched them!

This way, he was guaranteed to at least not end up finding lower-

grade natural treasures.

"You could do this in the UVR too." Lord Loki shared lazily, "I can remove the time restrictions in your private room."

"It's cool, I prefer using my illusion domain, it gives me more freedom and knowledge about everything in it." Felix rejected the offer politely.

Even with the time manipulation restriction taken off, the UVR had many other limitations and Felix was more comfortable with his domain.

Plus, since he would be using his domain in his private room, he wouldn't be wasting any elemental energy in the process.

"As you wish."

Without wasting time, Felix entered his private room andembarked on a grand endeavor to create a vast and diverse garden that would serve as a hub for cultivating and researching new plant life.

With a wave of his hand, he brought forth a series of distinct environments, each carefully tailored to support unique ecosystems.

The first environment he conjured was a sprawling desert, with towering dunes and a scorching sun overhead. In this arid landscape, he nurtured cacti species, succulents species, and many other resilient desert flora that thrived in the harshest conditions.

Moving on, Felix shifted the scene to a volcanic terrain, where smoldering lava flows and geysers of steam created a harsh and volatile setting.

Amidst the rocky outcrops, he wanted to cultivate rare heat-resistant plants that drew their sustenance from the Earth's fiery depths.

Transitioning to a lush forest environment, he created a green canopy of towering trees that filtered sunlight onto a rich undergrowth of ferns, mosses, and vibrant wildflowers. Here, he focused on the cultivation of shade-loving and woodland species.

Next, he transported himself to an oceanic paradise, with crystal-

clear waters, vibrant coral reefs, and swaying kelp forests. He wanted to experiment with marine plant life, nurturing species adapted to various depths and conditions.

Felix continued to craft diverse habitats within his garden, including alpine meadows, subterranean caves, and even a celestial grove bathed in moonlight.

Each environment was meticulously designed to mimic the conditions of its real-world counterpart.

"Those environments will do for now. I will add complicated ones later on related to time, void, vibration, death, life, gravity, and such."n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

As he wandered through this botanical wonderland, Felix understood that he had to start easy and simple.

Those environments mostly give birth to S-graded natural treasures and below. The SSS+ usually were related to rare elements, which was one of the reasons it was nearly impossible to find them in the first place.

But he was still a beginner at this and it was best to level up his experience and knowledge gradually.

Fortunately, he had a biology excel at behind him.

"Since we are doing this, I might as well teach you genetic manipulation to become a true alchemist at last." Lady Sphinx informed while entering his garden.

"I will be honored." Felix smiled joyfully.

He always wanted to excel at the genetic manipulation field and other fields of alchemy, but Lady Sphinx insisted that he needed to master potion-making first.

With his current tools and available free time, there was no better period to excel at all aspects and transform into an alchemist!
