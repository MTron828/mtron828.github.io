'Make sure to put everyone in your darltness field. So, not even his masters could save those pests if they wanted.‚Äò Saurous said, smiling coldly as he was seen traveling with a massive cloud of darkness.

'No need to tell me what to do.' Wendigo replied. 'No one will leave my presence unless I say so.‚Äò

In a few moments at best, the darkins were already close to the capital's atmosphere and most of the SGAlliance's fleets were seen grouped up around the Mothershop for protection.

'Mauananggal, are you in position?' Wendigo asked.

'Almost.l Manananggal replied.

He was seen speeding into the darkness, seemingly trying to put more distance from the SGAlliance's troops, but at the same time, keep them in his range.

Sometime later, Mananauggal stopped and said in his mind, 'This should be enough.‚Äò

He was indeed in the perfect position as everything was in his line of sight and with a simple zooming technique, he was able to see past hundred of thousands of kilometers with pinpoint accuracy.

He might not possess truth vision, but he was easily able to zoom in and out as it was a basic technique all primogenitors have mastered.

Only Lady Sphinx had taken mastering her eyes to the next level.

Suddenly, Manananggal beamed a massive divine crimson cannon.

It was enrobed in an ethereal aura, the cannon resonates with an age-old energy that seemed to pulsate with the beat of a heart, casting a hypnotic, blood‚Äîred luminescence that danced around it like a living flame!

It resembled an oversized human heart in design, an intricate network of grooves etched deep into its surface, mirroring the vascular system's complex arrangement.

This was Manananggal's most powerful weapon and partner who went through many battles together. It was called...

'Lifeblood Loom...l-iow l have missed you.‚Äò Manananggal displayed a faint gentle smile as he caressed the cannon's barrel.

The cannon seemed to have responded to his touch as it shimmered for a split second before turning dark again.

The last time this weapon was against Fenrir was when the three darltins ganged up on him and forced him to seal himself in a world of untouchable ice.

'I really didn't expect that the next time I will be using you, it will be for a puny hurnam...Yet, here we are.‚Äò

Manananggal muttered as he lifted the crimson cannon above his shoulder and aimed it in the direction of the SGAlliance's troops.

The moment Manananggal was in a perfect position, he tried to inform his partners.

'I am rea...‚Äò

Alas, before he could finish his sentence, a sudden powerful spatial disruption occurred around him!

The very fabric of reality twisted and shrieked around him, gravity distorted, space‚Äîtime ruptured, as the universe started to implode before Manananggal's own eyes!

‚ÄòBrat!'

Just as the collapsing reality was about to engulf Manananggal, a surge of power pulsed through his form.

In a flash of crimson brilliance, Manananggal transmitted into a swirling cloud of sanguine mist.

The rush of the transformation was instantaneous and much faster than the collapsing reality around him!

In a swift manner, he was propelled out of the immediate danger zone.

Still, the cloud of blood darted through the cosmos until he put a safe distance from the falling reality." ‚Äò 'As expected, they sure are slippery.‚Äò

Felix sneered as he emerged from the belly of nothingness, seemingly unaffected that his ambush attempt had failed.

His eyes narrowed as he traced the trajectory of the swirling blood cloud.

'You ain't going anywhere.‚Äò

Bathed in the cosmic darkness, Felix paused for a fraction of an instant, his gaze locked onto the distant crimson mist of the Manananggal.

Felix inhaled deeply, feeling the neutral energy surge through his being. His body started to glow with a faint bluish hue, the first sparks of energy playing around his fingertips.

His form quivered like a mirage as be concentrated, the flickers of lightning growing more intense and vivid.

In less than a millisecond, his body dissolved into a radiant bolt of pure lightning!

The transformation was striking, a blinding arc of electric power against the darkness of space.

For a moment, Felix was no longer a physical entity but an embodiment of raw energy and absolute speed!

As a lightning bolt, he moved at a speed almost incomprehensible, a flash that ripped through the cosmos with a silent thunder.

The space between Felix and the Manananggal ceased to exist in less than a heartbeat.

One moment he was there, and in the next, he had already reached the cloud of blood.

His arrival was marked by a brilliant streak of blue, his form flickering back to that of a man, now standing before the crimson specter.Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

immediately after, Felix drew his weapon, the fabled Cosmosbreaker!

'Concept Erasure Palms!‚Äò

With a thought, a surge of destruction particles flooded into the axe's blade, igniting it with a brilliant crimson hue!

He had channeled concept erasure palm through it while making sure he marked only blood elemental particles!

Then with a swift, fierce move, he. swung it towards Manananggal.

"Die!"

The blade cut through the space with a furious velocity, leaving a trail of glowing crimson in its wake! The cosmic silence was pierced by the shrill cry of the blade as it ripped through the vacuum, aimed with deadly accuracy at the blood cloud!

'Useless move.‚Äò

Manananggal scoffed, not having an ounce of fear at the sight of the Cosmosbreaker moving closer and closer.

'Split...Volume Expansion.‚Äò

He used two abilities simultaneously, causing the blood cloud to split into two parts and for one part to explode in volume until it engulfed Felix with his weapon!

The Cosmosbreaker did its job and erased the blood particles in its area, but there was too much of it to destroy altogether.

Manananggal didn't waste the opportunity of having Felix be inside his own blood particles.

'Blood Coffin!‚Äò

He morphed the swirling cloud of crimson mist into a colossal coffin of congealed blood, entrapping Felix within its pulsating, sanguine confines.

As Felix languished in the sanguine prison, Mananangal prepared to unleash his lethal finale. ..

With a thought, be invoked the 'Blood lmplosion'.

An insidious grin spread across his face as the blood coffin began to pulsate, its rhythm growing frenetic, echoing the silent countdown to Felix's doom!

The final note played. the coffin contracted violently and exploded outward.

The force of the implosion was terrifying, fuming Felix's body into a brilliant nebula of crimson!

Still, Manananggal's guard was at its peak as he knew that there was no way Felix could come for him on his own and end up dying this easily.

Manananggal's form manifested inside the blood cloud and he reached out with his senses to stttdy Felix's blood drops.

'A perfect match, this can't be faked and there is no way he has a clone this powerful.‚Äò As much as the results seemed in his favor, Manananggal wasn't easily trustful. '15 this really it? Did I just eliminate that unkillable cockroach?‚Äò

Manananggal found it too hard to believe but at the same time, there was not an ounce of fool play. Felix's blood was real, he recognized Elder Cyclope's work on the axe, and the abilities used in their swift battle couldn't be used by a clone.

It was as real as it could get.

Even then, Manananggal replayed the exact fight sequence in his mind and analyzed it to find out any irregularities.

'Our location and plan should have been known to only us, yet he still found out about most of the details.‚Äò Manananggal frowned, 'This means either my partners betrayed me or there is a third party involved.'

Manananggal didn't even consider the first option as he knew that his partners would never betray him for the Asgardians.

'Lord Loki... Theymust have gotten our information front him.‚Äò Manananggal reasoned, 'It's the only explanation.'

Lord Loki was the only third-party indirectly involved in their conflict 7.4/7, making him the biggest suspect.

'Why did he help them? Did he choose their side in this conflict? If he did, does that means be permitted the brat to use his bloodline? It can't be, the human bloodline path ends at seven bloodlines and he already reached its end.‚Äò Manananggal soon narrowed his eyes, 'But with Lady Sphinx's involvement, she can make it happen.‚Äò

In his eyes, Lady Sphinx had done too many miracles on Felix's body for him to question her capability to pull off another one.

This made him reach one final conclusion.

'Am I under an illusion?"

Crack Crack!

The moment this question popped into his mind, the sound of mirrors shattering resounded in his mind thunderously!

The eerie and silent universe seemed to have broken into little fragments before his vision was consumed by utter darkness.

When the light returned, Manananggal was left utterly stunned and frozen in place.

He found himself inside a throne chamber, that was nestled within an eerie grandeur castle.

The chamber was an opulent testimony to the ancient vampire lineage, a cold stone marvel built with original gothic aesthetics and bathed in an ominous palette of deep purples and onyx blacks.

High, vaulted ceilings loomed overhead, lost in shadow and hung with colossal chandeliers adorned with a thousand crystal prisms, which danced with spectral radiance in the dim, flickering candlelight. At the end of the room, on an elevated dais, sat the magnificent throne, forged from obsidian and embellished with blood‚Äîred rubies and silver filigree.

Reclining regally on the throne was a figure of deathly allure. Her skin was as pale as moonlight, eyes gleaming with an ethereal crimson glow that bespoke ancient power.

Her raven‚Äîblack hair cascaded down her shoulders, contrasting against the intricate ruby‚Äîstudded black gown that citing to her form.

A pair of onyx bat wings were folded neatly behind her, matching the dark aura that enveloped her.

She seemed pregnant as her belly was slightly bigger even under her heavy clothes.

To her sides, an array of princes lounged, a constellation of dark stars orbiting their radiant queen. Each prince was unique in his countenance, some with long, flowing hair, others with sharp, handsome features, but all bore the same intense eyes reflecting the bloodlust of Manananggal's lineage.

"Welcome back, dear." The Queen Vampire smiled gently, leaving Manananggal staring at her udth mixed emotions.

"Omarini..." He muttered her name, his heart was as heavy as a boulder while his mind was being assaulted by sealed memories of their precious life together.

"Do you miss her?"

Abruptly, Felix's voice resounded across the throne chamber, causing Mauananggal's expression to turn murderous immediately.

"Boy, if you are thinking what I am thinking, I can assure you that your death won't be gentle in the slightest." He threatened.

"I am not going to do anything." Felix manifested next to the queen and uttered with the most sinister smile as he rubbed her belly, "You will be doing the deed all on your own."

"Welcome to your personal hell."
