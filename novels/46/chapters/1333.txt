1334 Concept Erasure Palm.

The world around Felix dissolved into an inscrutable nothingness, a void where everything ceased to exist. Yet, he was certain that he wasn't in the void realm.

"Relax." Foremother Siamese said in a calming voice that reverberated in the silent abyss. Her eyes held a milky way of wisdom, her tone doused in quiet authority. "This place will allow you to reach a level of purity you couldn't have experienced elsewhere."

Felix nodded in appreciation as his voice couldn't travel in the same manner as Foremother Siamese.

He closed his eyes, breathing deeply as he prepared himself for the upcoming enhancement.

There was a moment of silence, and then the ritual began.

Tiny particles of red light began to emerge. They danced in the air, congregating around Felix. Each one pulsed with energy, their cores radiant with raw elemental power!

'So intense!' Felix expressed.

"These are the particles of the Destruction element, purified to their very core," She explained.

Felix could feel the humming energy of the particles on his skin, a tingling sensation that bordered on discomfort.

The particles began to infuse Felix's body, like golden threads weaving themselves into his very being.

There was a sudden pressure, a tension building within him that seemed to expand and push against his physical limits... But, the feeling was still more soothing and enjoyable than painful.

Felix embraced the feeling with his eyes closed and focused on the pure elemental particles swirling around his limbs and coursing through his veins.

The sensation was ethereal like a cascade of liquid fire imbued with celestial light. His senses were flooded with raw elemental energy, each particle a note in the symphony of destruction!

And then, just as abruptly as it started, it ceased. The particles disappeared, and their radiant light dimmed.

Felix stood tall, his breath ragged, his body vibrating with the resonant energy of enhanced destruction affinity.

"We will continue tomorrow." Foremother Siamese disclosed with a flat tone before sending Felix back to the Northern Forest.

The moment Felix opened his eyes, he couldn't help but grin widely at the power thrum in his veins, a constant reminder of the enhancement.

"She is really on a different level than the tribal chiefs. Candace expressed, "The process barely took a few seconds and yet, you have already reached your daily limitation."

"This is one of the times when being too good isn't preferred. The enhancement sensation feels too good for it to end in a few seconds." Felix narrowed his eyes, "But, this isn't the time to focus on such a thing."

Without an ounce of hesitation, Felix teleported outside of the northern forest and restarted his training in an empty area under no one's rulership.

He was already taught the concept destruction ability and the basics of how to master it two years ago. However, since his destruction affinity wasn't the best, he found it too hard to communicate what he desired from the destruction particles...

The more complex an ability, the harder it was for elemental particles to achieve the end results without proper communication, which was possible only with those with the highest possible level of talent.

It was similar in this case to mastering runic spells, but the difficulty was much more as advanced abilities could be considered to be on a much higher level than omnipotent spells.

The ability chosen by Lord Shiva was called *Concept Erasure Palm*.

The reason why concept destruction abilities were considered all advanced abilities wasn't due to the type of ability itself, but the ability to destroy concepts at will.

In other words, it didn't matter if Felix chose a palm, spear, sword, or whatever.

What he needed to master was manually destroying each concept at will!

'Lord Shiva has separated the mastery over the ability into four steps, understanding the concept, channeling the power, focusing the erasure, and lastly, control and release.'

Understanding the concept meant that erasing it was not just destruction, but a complete removal, a negation of existence while maintaining everything else around it.

The very essence of the target would be wiped from reality, both physical and metaphysical.

The next step would be to channel that power through his palm, transforming it into a conduit for this immense force.

It wouldn't be enough to merely understand the concept; he had to become an embodiment of it, able to harness and project its energy at will.

Felix raised his right hand, palm open. He visualized the energy, the essence of erasure flowing from his core, up his arm, and into his palm.

With the power now coursing through him, he would then have to focus it, targeting a specific concept to erase. It was an act of extreme precision, the slightest misstep could lead to unintended consequences.

In this case, he had chosen to start simple and picked gravity.

Felix eyed a random pebble sitting on the ground in front of him...He envisioned the stone, and then he focused on the force of gravity that made it remain on the ground.

All was well at the moment as Felix hadn't found an issue with those three first three steps, but the last one...Control and Release.

This was where his talent would be put to the test as he needed to communicate his wants to the elemental destruction particles.F·ªãùíèdd ùíèew updùíÇtùíÜs on n(o)v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

'Steady...'

Felix stepped forward, his hand extended towards the stone while his eyes were closed shut to focus on the elemental particles.

His palm trembled with the accumulated energy, the air around it distorting. He pushed forward, a silent shout echoing in his mind.

'Erase...'

And he released a wave of crimson energy that shot from his palm, crashing into the stone. There was a blinding flash, then...nothing.

The stone was gone, erased from existence. No rubble, no dust, only the empty plinth remains.

"Another failure." Felix commentated as he lowered his hand. He didn't seem too disappointed as he expected such results.

Although his communication with the elemental particles had somewhat improved due to his affinity enhancement, it was still not enough.

While he wanted them to destroy the gravity applied to the stone, the destruction particles end up committing total destruction to it.

"Again."

Felix focused on another stone and restarted his training, knowing that Lord Shiva wasn't going to accept his results unless he mastered destroying even the most complex concepts, such as the memories straight out of a person's mind!

That's where the fun begins!

****

Three Hundred Years Later...

"It's time." Felix uttered with a peaceful expression.

Felix had invested more than 95% of the past three hundred years into mastering the concept erasure palm ability and 3% on his elemental destruction range.

As for the remaining 2%? It was for his rest.

He fully committed himself to mastering the ability and he pulled it off in such a ground record time, even Lord Shiva was left pleased!

Naturally, he hadn't completely mastered the destruction of all concepts as there were a few ones that needed more than a couple of millennia of effort, like destroying the bonds between atoms or such.

But, his end results were more than enough to fulfill the end of his deal and no matter what Lord Shiva said, Felix was going out.

But before that, he still needed to ascend to a deity, which meant giving up on either lightning or gemstone-etched abilities to kick off the seventh bloodline replacement.

"So, what did you decide?" Asna asked.

Felix had plenty of time to finalize his decision. In the end, he came to the rational decision that emotions and sentiments shouldn't be involved in such a big matter.

"Lightning Quick Reflexes." Felix exhaled deeply.

"Good choice." Thor smiled in approval.

Felix already had mastered the passive on his own, which meant it had to be removed even if he was going to lose the lightning absorbers mutation.

As much as it pained Felix to come to this conclusion, he knew that his master would beat him to a pulp if he picked the crystallization beam.

"As I mentioned before, you can choose to remove my bloodline by taking away size manipulation and replacing it with lightning-quick reflexes." J√É¬∂rmungandr informed, "This way, you can replace the weakest bloodline in your path in addition to keeping Thor's mutation."

"I have told you that's making things too messy in his DNA as I can't remove and stitch whenever I desire without risks." Lady Sphinx shot down his idea, "I am already going to replace his void immunity with void domain in addition to taking out an entire portion of his DNA to leave space. This is more than enough to cause anyone's DNA to collapse and if I wasn't confident in my genes manipulation, I wouldn't have dared to touch this. But, it doesn't mean that I can do whatever I want."

"Fine, fine, I will drop it." J√É¬∂rmungandr waved his hand in defeat.

His idea was quite smart since both Thor and J√É¬∂rmungandr's ultimate abilities were size manipulation.

This ensured that Felix would obtain as many benefits as possible from the process. However, it was too complicated and Lady Sphinx had no interest in endangering Felix's life by being greedy for more benefits.

The process was already complicated enough.

"So, now to the big question." Candace asked with a tone of anticipation, "What bloodline have you chosen to conclude your path with?"
