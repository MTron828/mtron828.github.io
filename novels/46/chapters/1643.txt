Chapter 1644 Poseidon's and Hephaestus's War!

1644 Poseidon's and Hephaestus's War!

It was indeed a difficult dilemma...Felix and the tenants understood that making rash decisions in such situations was unwise.

"If you had access to the void realm, it would make things much easier." Candace frowned, "Is there really no possibility of breaking the seal apart?"

"If it were easy, Hephaestus wouldn't have struggled to break Lord Hades' seal after everything he had invested in his operation." Felix shook his head.

Breaking the seal on the void realm wasn't in his mind at the moment as he understood that it would be the same as going against the three rulers' hold of the seal.

As the ones erecting it, they would be defending it...Regardless of the amount of celestial energy he could gather, it would never be close to the amount in their possession. G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

As for using a wish? Yeah, the price would be enough to force him into slumber for eons to come.

"What I am more irritated about is the fact the rulers still have sight of me." Felix said with a cold tone, "I need to get rid of their constant snooping before considering making any move."

While Felix's spiritual pressure was able to protect him from the unigins' eyes, it could do nothing against the three rulers.

That's because their spiritual pressure was higher than his and unigins, allowing them to bypass their barriers.

Fortunately, at the stage of unigins, there was no such thing as being completely dominated by another one with a higher spiritual pressure.

They would be oppressed and be at a disadvantage, but not to the point, where they could not move their bodies or souls.

The universe would never allow such a massive imbalance between unigins and the three rulers, knowing that if the three rulers could freeze unigins with a mere look, there would be no need for their existence in the first place.

"A wish will work, giving you a temporary barrier." Lilith shared casually while licking a lollipop near the pool, "Since those old geezers want your ass badly, they will most definitely invest plenty of celestial energy to break it apart and keep you under their radar."

"In other words, not worth it," Thor remarked.

"Not precisely." Felix asked Lilith, "How long will it last?"

"Usually, it lasts a couple of minutes." Lilith anwsered, "With the rulers' intervention, it might not last a couple of seconds at best?"

"A couple of seconds..." Felix murmured while holding his chin thoughtfully.

"You have a plan in mind?" Lord Marduk asked with an intrigued look.

"I don't know if I should call it a plan." Felix smiled coldly, "But, at this point, I don't really care anymore."

The quick-witted ones quickly figured out what was in Felix's mind for him to react like this...They couldn't help but agree with his statement.

"It's not a plan, it's a suicide mission." Lady Sphinx knitted her eyebrows, "It's too risky."

"You will have only a few seconds..." Lilith chuckled, "Are you sure, you will be able to pull it off?"

"With enough preparations, there is nothing I can't do." Felix asserted with a confident gaze.

"What are you guys on?" Thor asked in irritation, still having no clue what they were talking about.

Felix went on and brought everyone into the plan...As expected, not one of them warmed up to it and believed that Felix was biting more than he could chew.

Still, Felix didn't listen to anyone's warnings and began his preparations to perfect it, forcing everyone to drop their misgivings and help him out.

"Poseidon and Hephaestus' war is the k..."

Before Felix could finish his sentence, he swiftly switched to his main consciousness after realizing that his senses had picked off the appearance of a new area in his radar.

Closing his eyes, Felix reached out with his heightened awareness, his senses stretching across vast distances.

As his perception expanded, he transcended the physical barriers, his mind's eye soaring over the tumultuous borderlands where the two deities' territories converged.

What he witnessed was a scene of epic proportions ‚Äì a colossal confrontation between two mighty armies, each consisting of millions of creatures embodying the essence of their respective domains!

The battlefield stretched along the vast expanse where Poseidon's endless ocean met Hephaestus's volcanic lands, a dramatic frontier where water clashed with fire!

"That attention seeker wh*re...He must have lifted his spiritual pressure to allow everyone free spectatorship of his invasion." Lilith smiled in amusement, knowing Posedion's character very well.

If there was something else he loved more than dogging and embarrassing Hephaestus, it would be doing it with public eyes on him!

"He sure didn't waste a single second," Felix said with a faint pleased smirk.

How could he not be pleased? He had live access to the ongoing war and this would help him immensely strategy for his future move.

"Aren't their armies a bit too small? Why even use armies when they could erase them with a single thought?" Candace commentated with a curious tone as she eyedthe formidable ranks of Poseidon's forces.

Water elementals surged forward like living waves, their forms shifting and flowing with lethal grace. Among them were mighty sea creatures, their scales glistening in the aquatic light, and legions of aquatic warriors, their weapons drawn and eyes set with unwavering resolve.

On the other side, Hephaestus's army stood as a living inferno. Creatures born of fire and molten rock moved with a fiery intensity, their bodies glowing with intense heat.

Fire elementals danced through the air, leaving trails of flames in their wake, while volcanic beings marched forward, the ground cracking and smoldering beneath their feet!

There was no sight of Poseidon or Hephaestus...Just their overwhelming armies in a complete standoff in front of their borders, awaiting further commands.

"Those armies are not small or weak in the slightest," Felix replied with a serious tone, "Each one must be blessed with various levels of Incandescent Divinity, which increased their strength immensely."

"In addition, the unigins bring subordinates under them only if they possessed enough radiant divinity to protect them from the territorial pressure during the invasion."

"Lastly, this isn't the only war ongoing. there are more than ten other battlefields."

Felix added as he switched his vision to share with them many other areas with the same confrontation happening.

"I see..." Candace raised an eyebrow in understanding.

Since even unigins struggled against the territorial pressure of their peers, it was obvious that their subordinates wouldn't be able to survive walking even a mere step on another side.

As expected, from the depths of the vast ocean, a radiant, golden celestial light emerged, a luminescence so pure and powerful that it pierced through the water, reaching up toward the sky and bathing the entire battlefield in its celestial glow!

The warriors of Poseidon's army, caught in this heavenly light, underwent a wondrous metamorphosis.

They were enveloped in an ethereal aura, their forms taking on an almost holy aspect. Their armor and weapons shimmered with divine energy, and their eyes glowed with a newfound resolve and power.

This divine intervention infused them with a sacred strength, elevating them beyond their natural abilities, and most importantly, giving them the necessary protection against Hephaestus's territorial pressure!

"FOR THE LORD!"..."FOR THE LORD!!"..."FOR THE LORD!!"...

Emboldened by this heavenly blessing, Poseidon's warriors let out resounding war cries, their voices echoing across the oceans and the skies as they charged toward Hephaestus's forces!

The clash that followed was a spectacle of divine and elemental warfare!

Warriors wielded water, ice, and fog with masterful control, shaping them into powerful weapons and shields.

The ocean itself seemed to respond to their command, with waves, and currents aiding their assault!

But beyond these elemental attacks, the warriors now also unleashed a barrage of divine techniques, utilizing their Incandescent Divinity!

It might be the weakest form of divinity with no more than 0.1% of celestial energy in it, but it was still powerful enough to cause great ruination among Hephaestus' forces!

<nulli>Booom!! Boom!!...

Divine beams of concentrated light shot forth from their hands, cutting through the ranks of Hephaestus's army with unerring precision.

Divine swords materialized from pure energy and clashed against the fiery weapons of their opponents, their celestial clangor resonating across the battlefield!

Warriors called upon celestial shields, impenetrable barriers that reflected the flames and heat back toward their assailants!

Hephaestus's forces weren't some sitting ducks...They also possessed Incandescent Divinity as it was a standardized blessing among them compared to the Radiant Divinity Blessing.

While Hephaestus was broke at the moment and couldn't afford to share his Radiant Divinity with them, the fight was still occurring in his territory, which gave his forces an advantage over their counterparts!

"DO NOT LET THEM GAIN GROUND ON US!!"..."DEFEND THE LORD'S TERRITORY WITH YOUR LIVES!"...

This turned the battlefield into an arena of both elemental and celestial combat with both forces suffering from major casualties across the board.

More so on Hephaestus's side since Posedion's forces were somewhat protected by his radiant divinity.

Both unigins remained hands-free from their troops' confrontation as it was an unspoken rule between unigins to not involve themselves in such battles.

Even if they didn't care about honor or their word, they saw it as beneath them to engage with those lesser than them in status.

Most importantly, if one dared to join, the other would most definitely stop him.

Thus, Hephaestus was left sitting in the heart of his fiery domain, brooding on his magnificent throne made of flowing magma.

His expression grew dark with irritation. His jaw was set firm, and his eyes, glowing like hot coals, burned with a mixture of rage and frustration.

With a clenched fist, Hephaestus slammed the armrest of his magma throne, causing a small eruption of sparks and molten rock.

"Shameless bastard, haven't you already taken enough from me?!"

Hephaestus could only curse and vent his anger in this manner, knowing that if he dared to make a move and stop Posedion's armies from advancing, he would go all out on him!

At this moment, he wasn't sure he would be able to push him away without suffering many more losses with his current amount of stored divinities.

In other words, Posedion was making sure to ruin his day and torture him by invading his territory bit by bit!
