Felix narrowed his eyes in focus on the flame, wanting to control it through its frequency. Though, Felix understood that fire did not have a frequency in the traditional sense.

The fire was a chemical reaction (combustion) that produced heat and light. It was more accurate to control the frequency of the light that the fire emitted.

If he considered a common yellow flame, the frequency of that light was roughly around 510 THz (terahertz), which corresponded to a wavelength of about 5901 nm (nanometers).

He understood that this was a rough estimate, and actual values could vary, but imagining that his mind could pinpoint the exact frequencies of each object, energy, or such, allowed him to pinpoint it and control it.

He could feel the vibration, the frequency of the fire, humming in his veins, intertwining with his very essence.

The realization of this connection was not one of shock, but of quiet acceptance as if he had always known this to be true.

The flame, vibrant and blazing, danced on the top of his palm, its intensity varying with his control.

When the link was established, Felix attempted to alter the vibration, the frequency of the flame...He imagined it extinguishing, the vibrations becoming slower, less intense.

Slowly, he began to notice a change. The flame flickered, and wavered, as if uncertain of its existence. Its wild, chaotic dance began to slow down, the fire diminishing in intensity.

His heartbeat followed, slowing down in sync with the flame...He could feel it, a distinct shift in the energy, a disruption in the flame's vibrational frequency.

For a moment, the flame seemed to sputter out, threatening to disappear completely. But Felix had a different plan. With a thought, he imagined it regaining its vibrancy, the vibrations speeding up, the frequency increasing. And just like that, the flame roared back to life, more vibrant than ever, flickering excitedly in his palm!!

'No wonder Asna said it's one of the most powerful elements in the universe.' Felix commentated as he snuffed out the flame.

He knew that he was not just manipulating fire... He was resonating with the universe, becoming a part of its symphony.

Becoming part of its symphony implied his ability to manipulate any kind of energy, object, liquid, and the list goes on.

That's because, on a universal scale, vibration could be understood as a fundamental characteristic of energy and matter.

Everything in the universe, from the tiniest particles to the most massive galaxies, was in a constant state of vibration!

The concept of vibration could be traced back to quantum mechanics, a branch of physics that described the behaviors of particles at the smallest scales.

According to this theory, every particle exhibited a wave-like nature, which was characterized by a specific frequency or set of frequencies.

This was often referred to as the particle's vibrational frequency.

On a larger scale, galaxies, stars, and planets also exhibited vibrational characteristics, albeit in different ways.

For instance, stars vibrated due to the nuclear fusion processes occurring in their cores. These vibrations could be measured as variations in their brightness and were a major method by which astronomers understood the interior of stars.

This concept of the universe being in constant vibration was rooted in theories such as the ancient String Theory, which postulated that the fundamental constituents of reality were not particles, but one-dimensional strings that vibrated at different frequencies.

It was this continual vibration and interaction of energy and matter that helped to shape the universe as everyone knew it.

Therefore, when Asna said that at the peak of vibration manipulation, Felix could bend reality to his own will, she wasn't joking around!

'Such a complex element would have been close to impossible to learn and master without its primogenitor teachings... But here?' Felix smiled coldly, 'I can use my own creativity to break down barriers and find the truth at the end of the path."

With his imagination and intelligence, Felix could test out what works and what doesn't without suffering any consequences..

Felix didn't know if it was possible to obtain vibration manipulation if he returned to the living world, but he wasn't going to waste this opportunity to study and dominate the element.

A couple of hours later....

Sekiro had returned from his errand. He brought with him more than fifty spiritual treasures.

They were small, ornate relics that bore an uncanny resemblance to exotic fruits, each carrying a unique imprint of power that could grant its possessor a certain level of enhancement.

"Sir Felix, are you sure about this?" Sekiro stressed, "It's not too late to sell them and void your plan."

Sekiro wasn't really afraid of him not receiving his payment but more about Felix ending up regretting his decision later on.

Since Felix gave his word to use his own light to pay him back, he understood that if he liquified twenty thousand Lumus, he would drop to orange or even below it!

That was a massive blow as it would take him ten times the effort to get back to his original color grade.I think you should take a look at

"I know what I am doing" Felix replied calmly as he lined up the spiritual treasures in front of him.

"Okay..." Sekiro shook his head and remained quiet on the side, not bringing this issue up again.

Slowly, Felix opened his mouth and ingested the first spiritual treasure.

The moment it passed his lips, a profound aura washed over him, a wave of powerful energy surging into his soul like a rushing river. His spirit trembled, but he remained composed, bearing the impact with unwavering resolve.

"Not a bad sensation." Felix commentated as he picked up the next one and continued to consume the spiritual treasures, each ingestion intensifying the surge of energy

He could feel the pure spiritual power coursing through his veins, pulsing within his soul, and amplifying his spiritual prowess with each heartbeat.

However, as he kept devouring one after the other, he started to feel a spiritual pressure, a crushing force that wanted him to slow down his rapid consumption.

Knowing that he couldn't die from this, Felix pushed through, swallowing treasure after treasure. Twenty, thirty, forty... the count kept rising.

His whole body was shaking now, his spirit thrumming like a plucked string, vibrating with the countless influxes of spiritual power.

The pressure was starting to go from uncomfortable to straight-out painful, but Felix was resolute.

'Why isn't he stopping? Doesn't the pain affects him?'

Sekiro had eaten his own fair share of spiritual treasures and knew that when his body reached its limit, it was best to stop and continue when his spirit finished its digestion. Otherwise, the pain would make one wonder if he was truly a spirit.

But, Felix seemed like the pain was merely tickling him as his eyelids didn't even twitch!

By the time the final energy wave receded, Felix opened his eyes. They shone with a new, brilliant light - the light of a soul transformed, a soul fortified.

His spiritual prowess had reached unprecedented heights, the successful consumption of fifty spiritual treasures having launched him into a realm he had never imagined.

Still, Felix knew that it was just barely enough to put him in the lowest form of the participation list.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, Karra entered the apartment from the wall and landed in front of Felix and Sekiro. Her cheeks looked flushed, her furry forehead was damped from sweat and her eyes seemed like they were about to break into tears at any moment.

"What's the matter?" Felix frowned.

"No..Nothing." Karra tightened her fists as hard as she could and then said, "I...I have brought you the information you wanted."

"Tell me what happened to you, I don't like repeating myself. Felix stated coldly as he reached out with his hand, making Karra flinch with her eyes closed.

This reaction made Felix pull back his hand with a serious expression.

'Was she abused physically? Is this why she is always scared? But, how can she get abused physically in the spirit realm with such tough law enforcers roaming around?'

"Karra, is it possible that you have met your previous dominate in your way?" Sekiro asked with a hardened expression as he was more familiar with the evil undergoing in the heavenly plane than Felix.

Karra opened her tearful eyes and nodded her head with great difficulty, seemingly shivering just at the notion of her previous dominate being mentioned in her presence.

When Felix saw how scared she was, resembling an abused puppy, he neither felt sympathetic nor saddened.

He just felt...Nothing, like there weren't more details for his other emotions to be triggered.

"Karra, tell me what happened to you with your previous master."

So, he ordered more information without an ounce of sympathy in his tone, causing Sekiro to give him a bad look.

"Sir Felix, that's way out of line," Sekiro complained to Karra as she didn't even dare to glance in Felix's direction after he tried to touch her before.

"Shut up." Felix eyed him coldly, "I hired her to run errands and be my maid. If her previous relationship with her dominate is going to affect her duties negatively, I have no reason to keep her under me."

"I am not a charity... Understood?" Felix eyed Karra and ordered, "Now talk if you want to keep your job."
