Chapter 1694 The Last Dance. II

Ôªø1694 The Last Dance. II

Felix understood that absorbing those two cores was nothing but a mere bonus...His goal was always to absorb their souls' explosion as he was certain that they would go for it even if they didn't take their cores with them.

That's because he had prepared a tight plan to imprison their souls here forever, leaving them with the sole option of self-implosion if they desired to leave his domain!

With their cores being safe in their territories, Zeus and Poseidon wouldn't hesitate to go for it.

"It's time for the last dance, the last act, and if I want to bring everything together, I can't make a single mistake," Felix uttered as he took a deep breath.

"We believe in you..." Thor encouraged with a solemn tone, recognizing the true difficulty of Felix's final act.

"Felix, you have gone through this so many times now." Lady Sphinx said as gazed at him with a faint smile, "The circumstances might change, but you always emerge victorious."

"Makes us proud and bring Asna home," J√∂rmungandr added with a head nod, a gesture filled with an untold amount of trust and confidence.

Those three were his masters and they spent the most time with him apart from Asna...They watched him evolve from the very beginning and now he was on the verge of pulling the trigger against the three rulers.

Thus, their encouraging words meant the world to Felix and made him realize that he had people observing his back now and forever...

"Let's bring her home." With narrowed eyes in focus, Felix ordered, "You may begin."

...

In the vast emptiness of outer space, high above the gleaming expanse of the Eternal Kingdom, a spectacle of cosmic proportions unfolds.

Four clones of Felix were seen spread in different areas above the kingdom.

"This is it, boys, this is the hill we die on." One of Felix's clones extended both of his hands and shouted into the heavens, "ENLARGE!"

Their bodies, already formidable in their power, swelled in size, expanding exponentially until they dwarfed the celestial bodies that pepper the universe, standing as colossal titans against the backdrop of the cosmos!

With movements that carried the weight and grace of celestial entities, these titanic clones extended their hands toward the void.

From their outstretched palms, a miraculous phenomenon occurs: thousands of prepared stars, each one supermassive and incandescent, burst forth into existence!

These newborn stars, forged from the unyielding will and power of Felix's clones, shimmered with a radiant light, casting their luminous glow across the endless expanse of space.

As these stars found their places in the fabric of the cosmos, they illuminated the darkness, creating a breathtaking tableau that spoke of creation itself.

'Little paragon...It seems like you aren't done yet.' Eris murmured as she gazed at the pretty array of stars gleaming in the starry sky of the kingdom.

'Felix, please be safe...' Asna held her hands together as she prayed under her breath, feeling it in her bones that Felix was coming soon.

As more heads kept rising to stare at the celestial-sized clones of Felix and his array of stars behind him, all of them reached one conclusion.

'What is he up to now?' Athena frowned, 'Is he planning to pour down on us with stars?'

The moment she thought this, the clones of Felix commanded the newly birthed stars to cascade down toward the Eternal Kingdom, setting the heavens ablaze with a meteor shower of unparalleled beauty and terror!

Initially, these falling stars appeared as mere streaks of light across the night sky, a mesmerizing spectacle that drew the eyes of the kingdom's citizens upwards in wonder and awe.

However, as the celestial bodies drew nearer, their true magnitude became horrifyingly clear.

What once were distant, twinkling lights now swelled into colossal orbs of fire, their surfaces roiling with nuclear fury, each one a miniature sun descending upon the kingdom!

The sky, once a tapestry of the cosmos' infinite expanse, was now obscured, replaced by the overwhelming presence of these stars.

Their light was so intense that night turned into day, casting harsh, shadowless illumination across the land!

Panic gripped the heart of the kingdom as the once beautiful meteor shower transformed into a portent of doom.

The citizens, who had initially marveled at the display, now scramble for shelter, their awe replaced by a deep, existential dread.

The entire kingdom was cast into turmoil, with whispers of the end times spreading as quickly as the stars' ominous light.

Yet, neither the three rulers nor the unigins seemed afraid...They gazed at the stars akin to a meteor of pebbles about to strike them.

"Doesn't he know that the eternal kingdom's divine protective barrier can block even ten moments the power of those stars?" Demeter remarked with an unbothered look.

This was the reason the three rulers didn't bother to make a move and waste more of their celestial energy, knowing that the protective barrier would keep the explosions on the other side.

The protective barrier had stood against the moments of the universe without a single crack on it...Unless the unigins combined their forces, it was near impossible to destroy it!

Whoosh!

Abruptly, under the impending doom of a starlit meteor shower, a solitary clone of Felix teleported right in front of the invisible divine protective barrier.

With his arms crossed above his chest, hestood defiantly, casting a stark shadow against the celestial onslaught.

Despite the vastness of the threat above, all eyes were inexplicably drawn to this lone figure, whose determination seemed to pierce the heavens themselves.

"Felix!"

Asna called out loud, hoping for her voice to reach him as he was standing above the capital's sky.

He seemed unafraid of being so close to the three rulers even after he witnessed the horrible fate of the other clone.

Felix's clone was indeed not scared as he came here with the will to die!

With a calmness that belied the chaos unfolding, the clone called forth the All-Devouring Puppet.

The gigantic humanoid pitch-black puppet manifested behind Felix, its lanky arms and legs made it resemble a demonic creepy creature.

'What is he planning to do with that...'

Before the three rulers, Eris, Athena, Asna, and the rest of the watchers could figure out Felix's motives for bringing this puppet out, he commanded with a menacing tone, "Release."

In response, the puppet's gargantuan maw yawned wide open and started the preparation to unleash an explosion of unfathomable power, the very essence of the two unigins' obliterated souls!

It might not seem like much due to how the puppet had easily absorbed it, but that would be a false misconception...

The force stored within its stomach was capable of annihilating thousands of galaxies without an ounce of struggle!!!

The instant the three rulers sensed the hidden threat that was about to be released on their glorious land, their stoic expressions were finally cracked a little.

"This kind of pure spiritual force...It can't be manifested unless out of a unigin's soul." Athena's pupils expanded in disbelief.

"Zeus and Posiedon..." Demeter murmured.

"I can't trust it...He has finished them off and absorbed their souls' explosion..." Aeolus felt a chill crawl down his spine.

Even the unigins reached the same conclusion and made them realize that what they were witnessing was the final roar, the final scream of their peers...Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))
