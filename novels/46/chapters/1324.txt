1325 One of The Greatest Cheats in The Universe! II

Before Lord Shiva taught Felix how to use his wisdom eye, his thoughts were consumed by a labyrinthine web of mysteries and complexities whenever he read the time runes.

He found himself lost in a torrent of contemplation, seeking to unravel the profound implications and hidden truths concealed within these arcane symbols. But now?

He delved deep into the labyrinthine depths of knowledge, unraveling the enigmatic patterns etched upon these ethereal symbols. The whispers of time have permeated his thoughts, guiding him toward a profound revelation that both exhilarated and unnerved him.

'I have no idea how that monster can even begin to understand something like this on her own. Felix thought to himself as he envisioned Selphie.

With each intricate line and intersecting curve, he had come to comprehend the essence of temporal manipulation, the power to reshape history, and the delicate threads that weaved the tapestry of existence.

It was all written in the Runic Codex for everyone to see but no one was capable of extracting such knowledge besides Lady Yggdrasil and Selphie.

The magnitude of this understanding was both awe- inspiring and humbling, for he held within his grasp the key to altering the course of destinies and unlocking the secrets of the universe itself!

But such power did not come without consequence.

As he meticulously deciphered the time runes through his wisdom eye, he witnessed the delicate equilibrium upon which the fabric of time rests.

The very act of tampering with temporal currents could unleash chaos and upheaval, tearing asunder the natural order of events.

The weight of responsibility pressed upon him, urging caution and contemplation in every decision he made.

'It's like a guiding book to use a time spell instead of being merely a sequence to activate it. Felix knitted his eyebrows with a solemn tone, 'Selphie said that the key to mastering time spells is through creating a connection and that connection can't exist without comprehending them first. I realize what she means now!

The complexities Felix had unraveled have revealed the fragile interconnectedness of all moments, the intricate dance of cause and effect that governed his universe.

Such powers could and should never be accessible to the public, which was the reason why mastering. Time spells required a connection with the time runes.

'It's like I have to seek their approval. Felix said, 'The only way for that to happen is to show that I have comprehended the message and will be responsible with every time spell utilized.

If Selphie was right in her assumption that elemental particles were alive and could decide whether to allow one to use them or not, then he had to give it the appropriate approach even when it sounded somewhat mad.

"It's not confirmed and there is no way to confirm it, but her assumption does have some logical premise to it." Lady Sphinx explained, "I believe anyone using the Universal Codex to manipulate elements has absolute control over them whether they were alive or not. But, those using Runic Codex and Divine Codex to manipulate them don't have equal authority. This is the reason why elements such as time, space, void...etc seem to have a massive learning curve compared to other elements. But, this is all nothing but an unconfirmable theory."

"Whether it's true or not, it seems like it's working." Felix commented as he sensed the time runes responding to him after comprehending their message. It was hard to describe the feeling, but he was certain that he had made a massive advancement.

"With my wisdom eyes, I won't even need to use my other cheat method to master those spells at a reasonable duration." Felix smiled widely, "I have a feeling that I can even decipher the runic codex and create new space/time spells."

"Hold your horses and master the already known spells first." Thor said.√öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

"I will, I will." With a faint chuckle, Felix returned to his practice, hoping to master this lesser time spell in a few years at best. He had made a deal with Lord Shiva that he wouldn't come out of the galaxy until the day he was satisfied with his progress.

It might take a decade, century, or even millennia on the outside universe and it was up to Felix to convince him of his results as soon as possible.

'Space/Time spells mixed with wisdom eye, will it be possible for him to create spells on a higher level than Omnipotent spells?' Lord Shiva thought to himself as he watched Felix busting his ass to master the runic sequence. "The future might not be as bleak as I thought.'

Six Decades Later in the outside universe...

The once-thriving SGAlliance territory now stood as a haunting testament to the devastating aftermath of a universal demonic invasion.

More than 20% of territories with hundreds of thousands of planets had been transformed into a desolate wasteland, marred by the scars of destruction and chaos.

Ruins stretched as far as the eye could see, a shattered remnant of what were once bustling civilizations. Scorched surfaces stretched out in all directions, bearing the marks of rampant infernal energies that ravaged the land.

The once-vibrant flora now withered and decayed, the once-rich soil tainted by a sickly hue.

Cries of lost souls and distant echoes of battle hung in the air, a haunting reminder of the horrors that unfolded in this once-prosperous domain.

Six decades was a long period of time as it represented six great resets... Felix had missed them all as he was still in seclusion inside the Elementals Galaxy even though more than six thousand years had gone by in there...

"My king, I have just received news that we have lost another solar system inside the Bardot empire...The casualties estimates can reach up to seventy billion citizens." Candace reported with a distressed tone as she stood in front of Felix's clone.

"We lost thirty billion humans in total last year and now we are starting the new year with seventy billion more casualties?" Felix gritted his teeth with a look filled with nothing but absolute hatred, "Is it possible to rescue some of them at least?"

"Our forces are stretched too thin and unlike us, those demons multiply through our own people..." Cadance sighed. She didn't have to say more for Felix to understand that those seventy billion citizens were as good as lost.

The worst part? When turned into demons, it meant there would be more than seventy billion new lesser demons seeking purities to keep their rationality intact.

When they fail to do this because everything and everybody had already been demonized, they would turn into immortal humanoid animalistic demons.

At that point in time, Felix could do nothing but send a world eater or a dreamer void creature to devour their planets and at least end their misery....

It might seem weird that demons were dominating the SGAlliance even with their technological differences, but Lucifer's involvement really changed the entire narrative.

That's because all lesser demons under Lucifer's direct control were capable of keeping their elemental manipulation and memories.

Now, imagine if he had demonized an army of space worms and other powerful races or even utility races such as witches and dwarves.

Space worms could easily create wormholes and portals straight inside the targeted planets and send waves of demons into them, avoiding space battles completely.

It was a known fact that the moment demons stepped foot on a planet, it would belong to them in less than a day if they weren't stopped.

At the very beginning, the SGAlliance and all races were capable of protecting themselves from said invasions, but Lucifer had decided to target the highly profiled targets like race leaders and made them his subordinates.

With such high targets switching to the other side, the invasions kept getting easier and smoother for the demons until the SGAlliance began losing their grip on the war bit by bit.

In fact, there were a few inner-circle races that had fallen almost completely from top to bottom in the past six decades...Such as Orcs, Giants, lonians, and more!

With such grave losses and the entire SGAlliance seemingly on a path of extinction, most entertainment platforms were shut down including the SGPlatforms.

Because the platforms were shut down, the races' ranks were frozen until the war ended. Though it was still possible to earn SGPoints, and right now, the best method to get them was through slaying demons.

This allowed the players to offer their services to fight off the invasion and get paid for it, which created a new occupation called, Demon Hunters.

Selphie, Bodidi, Olivia, Noah, The Exutioneers, Wowef/Nero, DisfiguredBeauty, and many other names had risen to the occasion and made themselves known universally wide with their hunting records...Especially Noah and Olivia, as those two made everyone question if they were truly human.

While Felix's friends were popping off in a good way, his name on the other hand was being dragged across the mud in the past decades. It was understated as Felix never made a public appearance to promise the end of the invasion or even showed himself to participate personally in helping the people.

If it wasn't for the fact that his void nation was offering the best possible help and considered a true savior, his title as grand supreme would have been denounced by the public a long while ago.

But Felix knew that it wouldn't be long before he lost everyone's trust if he remained hidden for much longer...
