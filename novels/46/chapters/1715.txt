Chapter 1716 The Frequencies Hub!

ÔªøÔªø1716 The Frequencies Hub!

As Felix and Apollo approached the main gate of Quantaar, they found it majestically unguarded, its gates flung wide open in a welcoming gesture to all who wished to enter.

The entrance was a grand archway that pulsed with soft, inviting light, echoing the city's foundational principle of harmony and openness.

Around them, a diverse crowd of natives and visitors of all shapes, sizes, and colors flowed in and out of the city, each contributing to the vibrant life that defined Quantaar.

Stepping forward to cross the threshold into the city, Felix experienced a sudden and unexpected sensation. His entire body began to vibrate as if resonating with an unseen force!

In that brief instance, Felix felt an inexplicable connection to Quantaar, as if the city itself had accepted him by syncing his frequency with its own.

This bond was not just physical but almost spiritual, creating a sense of unity and belonging that Felix had seldom experienced.

He glanced at Apollo, who offered a reassuring smile, as if to say, "Welcome to Quantaar."

'What's this?' He asked with a surprised tone.

'That's the Quantaar linking you with itself and to the city's frequencies hub. You can feel the frequencies going through your body and then the ground, correct?' Apollo said.

'Yes.'

'That's the mechanism for feeding.' As he lifted his feet, Apollo explained, 'One of the city's most important rules is to always be in touch with the ground, a building, or any surface. Otherwise, your bodily frequency will be messed up and make your life here unbearable.'

'I see.'

While this rule was somewhat bizarre and quite demanding, Felix wasn't too bothered by it. He understood that it was impossible for an empire to welcome everyone with open hands and not expect something from them in return.

In this case, the foreigners were used as food sources for the Quantaar and if they weren't too pleased with it, the gate was always open.

'What about them? Are they exempted from the rule because they are natives?'

Felix asked as he pointed his finger at the flying vehicles and traveling Vibronixians through the air.

'Yep, the Vibronixians are exempt from many core rules in the city and possess quite a significant advantages and access to the city's facilities compared to the foreigners.' Apollo clarified.

'What kind of advantages?' Felix asked as he glanced around and noticed many females sneaking gazes at him and Apollo.

The disguise was indeed working as Apollo said, which made him more vexed than joyful with females' attention.

'First, you need to understand the core aspect of the city that keeps it running in order and harmony...It's called, The Frequencies Hub.'

Apollo began to explain the intricacies of the Frequencies Hub as they walked through the bustling streets of Quantaar.

'You see, the moment we got linked to the Quantaar, we have been given access to the Frequencies Hub. It's like a massive, living radio, connecting everyone and everything here. This connection allows access to a network that serves as the backbone of Quantaar's society.'

He gestured around them, where natives and foreigners alike seemed to move with a purpose, their steps synchronized with the city's vibratory heartbeat.

'Each frequency within the hub is akin to a radio station, catering to different needs and interests. There's a frequency for the marketplace where you can listen in on the latest deals, auctions, and even haggle in real time without being physically present. Then there's my favorite, the brothel hub, offering...well, hehe, I suppose that's self-explanatory."

Felix's eyelids twitched after noticing the pervy look on Apollo.

'Cough,' Apollo's voice took on a more serious tone as he continued, 'There are more specialized locked frequencies, like the career hubs that require a license or certification to access. They're platforms for professionals to network, share knowledge, and find opportunities within their field. It's incredibly efficient but also ensures a level of security and privacy for sensitive information.'

Felix listened intently, intrigued by the concept...Even the tenants were left somewhat dazed and astonished at such an ingenious idea to connect an entire city with its citizens together.

It was like the internet or the UVR, but more intimate.

'There's even a transportation hub. Think of it as the ultimate travel guide, providing real-time updates on routes, vehicle availability, and even traffic conditions. It makes getting around Quantaar a breeze.'

'However, not all hubs are open to the public. Some are private, accessible only to certain families, organizations, or even races. The Vibronixians, for example, have their exclusive channel. No matter how high your status is, if you aren't native, you can't gain access to those private channels. Let me tell you, they have the good stuff in them.'

'I guess it's the same racial treatment across the universe.' Felix remarked.

'Even if you are smaller than an atom, there is no escaping from racism.' The ever-silent Lady Yggdrasil shook her head for a moment.

The only way for racism to be completely removed was if all races regardless of status were given the same benefits and disadvantages across the board.

However, this was just a mere fantasy as no race would ever willingly relinquish such authority on their turf.

'So, how do I gain access to those hubs?' Felix inquired.

'It's simple, tune your mind to the city's vibration, then dial down to match the marketplace's frequency. It's like finding the right radio station, the complicated part is handled by the Quantaar.' Apollo instructed with an encouraging nod.

Felix closed his eyes, focusing on the vibrational essence that enveloped them. At first, the task seemed straightforward, but as he connected, a cacophony of voices bombarded his senses!

"Crystaux Quasi ad vili pretium!"

"Sis, emere id volo!"

"Nodos magnos opus est!"

The noise was overwhelming, with vendors shouting their wares, customers haggling loudly, and countless other transactions occurring simultaneously.

The worst part? He couldn't understand anything as no one was speaking the common universal language.

Felix winced, the discord grating on his nerves.

Apollo observed Felix's struggle with a slight chuckle. 'I forgot to mention, it's a bit similar to stepping into a bustling market square. Now, you need to learn how to filter out the noise. Focus on zoning out the unwanted frequencies. It's about picking the signal you want to hear amidst the chaos.'

'As for Quantum Quasi language, this will do the trick.'

Apollo stated as he placed two fingers on Felix's forehead and forwarded all the necessary information needed to master the quantum realm's Quasi language.

Since both of them were unigins, the learning curve for them was nonexistent...Even through the barrage of noise, Felix managed to master the new language instantly and began to somewhat understand what everyone was clamoring about.

Still, there was too much noise to work with.

Taking Apollo's advice to heart, Felix concentrated, attempting to isolate the frequencies, to sift through the auditory barrage.

Gradually, the surrounding clamor dimmed, except for one clear voice that rose above the rest, an auctioneer, vigorously conducting his sale, and the distinct responses of eager buyers in his private hub.

The transformation in Felix's perception was remarkable. Where there was once a tumultuous sea of sound, there now existed a focused stream of communication between the auctioneer and his audience.

'One thousand Quasi Lira for The Desire Enhancer Vial!'LùíÇaTest novùíÜls on (n)ùíêvelbi/ùíè(.)coùíé

'One thousand and two hundred Quasi Lira.'

'One thousand and three hundred Lira.'

'Two thousand here.'

'Two thousand!! Is there anyone willing to pay more?!

Silence.

'Fellas! This is the one and the only Desire Enhancer Vial! If consumed right before engaging in any act related to pleasure, it will double the sensation! You can't miss this.'

Some murmurs followed, but still, no one placed another bid. This forced the auctioneer to swallow his greed and start calling the offer three times before smacking the gavel on a wooden surface.

'Sold!'

A gentle applause followed suit and the auctioneer moved to the next item.

Felix opened his eyes with a look of fascination on his face...He had just experienced the hustle and bustle of Quantaar's commerce in a uniquely direct and intimate way, feeling like he was actually there.

'See? Just like that. You will get the hang of it later on and realize that it will be near impossible to live in this city without taking advantage of the hubs.' Apollo said.

'It's truly one of the most fascinating systems I have ever come across.' Felix complimented genuinely, already anticipating the many possibilities for such a system.

'However, how does currency work here? If someone bought or sold something, how does the transaction work?' Felix wondered.

In his eyes, if the buyer or seller were required to meet face-to-face for such an operation, then it would defeat the purpose of having the marketplace hub. Well, not truly defeat the purpose, but it would reduce its efficiency greatly.

'Give it a guess.' Apollo smirked.

Felix thought about it for a moment before answering, 'Is there a transaction hub connected to a bank? So if both parties agreed to a deal, they could conclude it remotely similar to this?'

'Spot on.' Apollo nodded, 'However, you need to sign up for the bank, and for that, you need an identity.'

'Do you have an identity?' Felix frowned, 'Is it even possible to get it while in disguise?'

'It's tricky.' Apollo smirked faintly, 'But don't worry, I know someone who will hook you up. We are heading to him right now.'

'What does your 'friend' do?' Felix asked, not liking the look in his eyes.

'He is an entrepreneur who is heavily invested in people's needs.' Apollo coughed.

'Why do I have a feeling that he runs a brothel or a business oriented around sex?'

'All I can say is that he is a dedicated entrepreneur.'

Apollo avoided Felix's gaze and kept walking forward.

'Don't tell me he runs a brothel...' Felix's eyelids twitched

'I don't know what you are talking about.'

'You are truly going to be the death of us.' Felix facepalmed, 'Even a child can predict your movements.'

'Na uhhh.' Apollo replied with a childish voice.

'Sigh...'

Felix let out a long exhale and stopped talking to him, feeling similar to his brain cells were being drained.
