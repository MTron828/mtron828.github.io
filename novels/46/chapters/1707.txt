ÔªøÔªø1708 The Beauty and The Danger of The Quantum Realm.

Somewhere in the vast expanse of the cosmos, a dark cloud cruised silently.

Felix lay motionless atop it while Apollo sat at the front. He was strutting the divine's lyre strings gently as he sang a pleasant melody.Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

"In a realm where dreams and reality intertwine, fought a hero and a god, in a clash divine. With strength unmatched and resolve so fine, Felix stood his ground, his spirit did shine."

"Against Amun-Ra, the king of gods, In the dreamrealm's chaos, they did sway. With every strike, light did fray, till Felix's fury, made the god give way..."

"With a force of will, beyond measure, Felix pushed past pain, in pursuit of treasure. Not gold nor jewels, but freedom's pleasure, for himself and his beloved Asna, beyond any measure..."

He paused his singing momentarily, intensifying his strumming, causing white luminous musical notes to pour out of the lyre, reflecting his inner state.

"As the final blow, through the void did ring, Amun-Ra was sent flying, an unthinkable thing. The god of the sun, on an ethereal wing, defeated by an ascended mortal, a new legend to sing..."

"So sing we now, of courage and might, of Felix, who fought with all his might. Through darkness and despair, he brought light, A beacon in the cosmos, burning ever bright..."

Apollo's voice, both haunting and clear, carried through the void, for all to hear...A song of victory, of love, and fear, A tribute to Felix, whom the gods revere.

In this forsaken place, the stars themselves seemed to pause and listen, As Apollo's melody made the cosmos glisten.

For a tale of triumph, where the odds were beaten, in the endless night, a new legend was written...

It seemed like the song had touched upon Felix's inner parts as his consciousness slowly seeped back into his mind.

His first sensation was weightlessness, a gentle buoyancy as if he were suspended in a realm of whispers and ethereal touches.

Blinking open his eyes, he found himself seated atop the dark cloud that felt like sitting on the densest yet softest cotton.

Before him, Apollo, the embodiment of radiance even in the darkest reaches of space, casually strummed his lyre, perfecting the rest of the song.

The melodic strings wove through the cosmic void, creating ripples of light that danced harmoniously with the music, illuminating their path through the endless cosmos.

Felix's voice emerged hoarse and disoriented, "Where...where are we?"

"Nowhere," Apollo replied without missing a beat, his fingers deftly moving over the lyre's strings, the music a soothing constant in the vast emptiness.

"Nowhere?"

Felix echoed, confusion knitting his brow as he took in their surroundings...An infinity of stars, galaxies, and the velvet darkness of the universe stretching out in all directions.

"How long was I out?" His question floated softly.

"A couple of minutes, give or take," Apollo answered with a nonchalant shrug, his gaze still fixed on the cosmic scenery unfolding before them.

The casualness in his tone contrasted sharply with the gravity of their recent encounters and the tumultuous events that had led them here.

While Apollo might whine and b*tch most of the time, the moment he accepted his fugitive status, he no longer complained about it.

Felix tried to process Apollo's response, his mind still foggy, the pieces of his memories fragmented like a puzzle thrown asunder.

It was expected as his mind was forced to awaken after a mere few minutes, which was the least amount of time he needed for his hibernation recovery symbol to do its magic.

As he sat there, trying to piece together his fractured thoughts and memories, the gentle strumming of the lyre and the serene journey through the cosmos offered a tranquil respite from the chaos that had preceded his unconscious state.

Yet, he couldn't enjoy it...Such a false sense of peace and calmness made him restless.

"Before you ask me any questions, we have to leave the matter universe first," Apollo said with a solemn expression.

"Why?"

'He is probably going to take you to his lunatic alter-ego.' Lilith said lazily.

'Why?' Felix directed his question to Lilith this time.

'Apollo is too cowardly to risk his lifestyle for anything.' Lilith anwsered, 'His alter-ego is responsible for this rescue mission and for him to go against the three rulers, you must have something he desires.'

'This makes more sense now.' Thor said with a faint sigh of relief, 'I don't know what he needs from you, but the fact still stands...He saved you when you had no one in your corner.'

Felix and the rest knew that he was dangerously correct. Felix had reached a point in his life where those who could help him were few and far.

Lord Hades was the only one capable of saving him from Uranus' clutches but at the risk of his death due to his weakened state.

Lord Hades would never jeopardize the safety of his spirit realm for anyone's sake, knowing that the realm's fate would be horrible if it landed in the hands of the three rulers.

With their ever-hunger for celestial energy and unique methods, god knows what they would do to the infinite pool of wandering spirits.

Before Felix could inquire Lilith again about the location of the alter ego, he received his answer from Apollo.

"My idiotic counterpart wanted me to bring you to him...He is currently residing in the Quantum realm and is waiting for our arrival."

"Quantum realm?" Felix raised an eyebrow in surprise, "What is he doing there? How could you both exist in two separate dimensions at the same time?"

"As I said, depart your questions until we get there." Apollo narrowed his eyes, "While I possess been using spiritual pressure in addition to other techniques to hide our presence, I have no interest in pushing my luck by cruising here."

While Apollo wanted to convey Felix to the Quantum realm for his alter-ego's sake, he understood that it was one of the few places where the three rulers had no reach.

Plus, he had his alter-ego residing there for a very, very long time, which was the same as having a stronghold.

"Fine." Felix agreed without much of a struggle.

It wasn't because he started trusting Apollo after he saved him...He understood that he couldn't afford to say no to anything in his current condition.

He was 99% weakened and could barely breathe without feeling the celestial chains tightening down his neck.

He wasn't dumb to reject Apollo's calls as he could always utilize force...It was much better for him to keep this mutual level of respect.

"It will be good for you too." Apollo smiled, "The spacetime down there is f*cked up and with a bit of effort, you might find an area with a much accelerated time difference, helping you serve the punishment sentence faster."

"Sounds good to me." Felix approved.

In reality, the punishment sentence would be the same for Felix either here or there. However, if he served it with a time difference to his advantage, he would return to his peak without wasting real years in the matter universe or the eternal kingdom.

Apollo placed his lyre aside, a serious expression replacing his usual playful demeanor.

"Ready for a dive into the unknown?" He asked Felix, who nodded, still feeling the aftermath of his recent battle.

Apollo linked himself with Felix using a dark tether...This was used to avoid getting separated while shrinking down.

With a shared knowing glance between them, both of them initiated the shrinking process, an inner ability known only to the unigins and some rare entities in the universe.

The cosmos around them began to expand‚Äîor so it seemed‚Äî

as their bodies grew smaller and smaller, crossing the boundary that separated the macroscopic world from the Quantum realm.

As they shrank, Felix observed the transformation of the universe. Stars and galaxies turned into blurs of light, then into individual particles, and eventually, even those particles became indistinct.

As they crossed past the particles, they were thrown into an empty colorful void with peculiar structures, a strange atmosphere, weirdly shaped surfaces, and seemingly chaotic unfamiliar energies roaming past akin to a spring breeze.

"Welcome to the Quantum realm, the first level of reality," Apollo announced, his voice echoing strangely in this new environment.

"We're now at the first level of the quantum realm," Apollo explained, his voice a beacon in the surreal landscape. "This is where matter begins its dance, where everything you gaze in the universe starts its existence."

"It's so mesmerizing..." Felix murmured in astonishment and awe as his eyes roamed across the unfamiliar bizarre realm.

The experience was quite overwhelming for Felix...He had fought gods and traversed realms, but never had he been so intimately connected to the essence of reality itself.

Even when he used his Quantum vision before to gaze at it, the sensation was nowhere the same.

"Always keep using your spiritual pressure as a barrier and a camouflage." Apollo warned, "We are considered foreigners here, and without making ourselves somewhat in tune with the environment, we will be attacked by everyone and anything."

"I know." Felix nodded with a serious expression, understanding that behind this beauty laid an unknown danger that could steal even unigins' souls.

'How could they be scared of entities here?' Candace tilted her head in confusion, 'Aren't unigins the top predators of the universe below only the three rulers?'

'In the matter universe and other realms, sure thing. But, in the Quantum Realm?' Lilith responded casually, 'There is no such a thing as a force...All beings and entities possess a standardized force across the entire dimension and could change randomly over time.'

'Which means, a mere quantum cockroach could kill unigins if their guards are low.'

'You joking right?'

'Nope.'

'...'

'...'

'...'

Everyone was left staring at each other speechlessly, having no idea how to react to such a dumbfounding piece of information!
