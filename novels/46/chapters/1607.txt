Chapter 1608 Five Thousand Years of Slumber.

1608 Five Thousand Years of Slumber.

A few moments later...

The three celestial rulers had announced the bounty, an unprecedented decree that sent shockwaves through the territories of the Unigins.

At the heart of this tumult was the target of the bounty: Asna's core, now residing within Felix.

In Apollo's territory, a magnificent city known as the Domain of Duality, the news of the bounty reached the god of light and darkness himself.

This city was a marvel of divine architecture, split down the middle ‚Äî one side bathed in blinding, eternal light, and the other shrouded in impenetrable darkness.

The contrast was not just visual but symbolic, representing the balance between light and shadow, day and night.

Apollo, seated in his grand palace that straddled the two realms, received the announcement with a raised eyebrow.

His appearance was as striking as his domain: his hair shone like spun gold, and his eyes flickered with a light that seemed to capture the essence of the sun itself.

He was draped in robes that shimmered with a radiant luminescence on one side, while the other melded into the shadows.

As the proclamation echoed through his hall, a look of interest crossed his divine features.

"That boy has been the greatest source of entertainment besides the unigins' celestial promotion event. I would have never thought he would be bringing it home."

The prospect of capturing Asna's core was intriguing, but the involvement of Felix, a being who had endured and transformed so dramatically, piqued his curiosity even more.

"Should I join the bounty hunt? I am not too interested in becoming an upper celestial, but the hunt does sound fun."

A thoughtful smile played on his lips as he considered the possibilities, the gears of strategy already turning in his mind.

...

Meanwhile, in Hephaestus's territory, the reaction was starkly different.

This realm was known as the Inferno Dominion, a vast expanse that resembled hell itself. Fire and magma flowed freely, creating rivers and lakes of liquid flame.

The sky above was dominated by multiple suns, each casting an oppressive heat that kept the land in a perpetual state of smoldering fury.

At the peak of the highest volcano sat Hephaestus's palace, a fortress carved from obsidian and magma, its walls glowing with the intense heat from within.

The god of fire and forge, Hephaestus, stood at the heart of his domain. His eyes, usually a molten orange, now burned with a deep-

seated anger as the announcement reached his ears.

The pondered of Felix, and by extension, Asna's core, being the target of a bounty ignited a fierce rage within him.

His reaction was understandable when considering that Felix was one of the main culprits in his promotion plan failure.

"If it wasn't for that meddling little sh*t, I would have already joined the upper celestial echelon and recovered my lost territories from that bastard Poseidon." He uttered with a bone-chilling tone.

Felix had no idea how much resources Hephaestus had invested in his plan to open up the spirit realm to the eternal kingdom.

Besides the divine armies and the divine equipment, he had invested an unholy amount of celestial energy to open up the portal, leading to the spirit realm.

Even with Lord Hades injured, punished, and weakened, the celestial energy required to open up any gate or portal outside of the eternal kingdom was massive.

Hephaestus had wasted millions of years to gather the necessary amount by either stealing it from his nemesis Poseidon's territories by conquering them or participating in events held by the three rulers themselves.

The worst part, Poseidon had taken advantage of his absence and invaded his territories, conquering a significant portion before he returned.

Territories within the eternal kingdom were everything since celestial energy was roaming freely across the entire realm and the only way for unigins to harvest it was through having a larger surface area than their peers.

This created nonstop conflicts between unigins and their neighboring territories...Poseidon and Hephaestus were always at each others' throats because of this.

At this moment, Hephaestus understood that this was the perfect rebounce opportunity...He had both a chance for revenge and another chance to get promoted directly.

With a snarl of fury, Hephaestus clenched his fist, the air around him shimmering with heat. He growled, his voice like the rumble of an earthquake, "Brat, your head will be mine."

The rest of the unigins might not share a direct relationship with Felix, but the bounty's reward was simply too enticing to give up on.

Thus, across the entire eternal kingdom, the majority of the unigins had their eyes affixed on Felix, awaiting the day of his ascension and joining the land of the gods...

****

Five thousand years later in the elemental galaxy...

Felix could be seen sleeping on a wooden bed above a cozy hatch nestled in the wilderness of the northern forest.

The hatch was a sanctuary of warmth and tranquility, a stark contrast to the void's cold, endless expanse where he had last battled.

Felix had genuinely slumbered for more than five thousand years even when his soul and body were at their peak forms...

One could only wonder if he had slumbered all this time to avoid the consequences of his decision or if his mental health was too damaged.

Either way, his consciousness slowly seeped back into Felix's mind, and his eyes fluttered open, revealing a world blurred by time and disorientation.

The room swam into focus gradually ‚Äî the rustic wooden walls, the simple furnishings, and the warm light spilling from the hearth.

'Where am I?'

For a moment, Felix merely lay there, trying to piece together the fragmented memories of his last conscious moments.

Suddenly, the battle with Nimo's alter ego played back in his mind like a vivid yet distant dream.

He remembered the overwhelming onslaught, the transformation, the intervention of the Paragon of Sins, and the descent into the void.

His body tensed as the memories flooded back, each one more intense and chaotic than the last. R√™aƒë latùíÜst chùíÇpters on nùíê/v/ùíÜ/l(b)iùíè(.)cùíêm

A sheen of cold sweat formed on his brow as he thought, 'Was this all one nasty nightmare?'

But then, cutting through the silence of the hatch and the turmoil of his thoughts, a familiar voice greeted him.

It was Lilith, the Paragon of Sins, her tone warm and filled with concern. "Little darling, awake at last? You sure had me worried for a second there. You slept for close to five millennia."

'No...'

At the sound of her voice, Felix's seven hearts plummeted to the bottom of his stomach. The realization that it wasn't a nightmare, that everything he recollected had indeed happened, weighed heavily on him.

But this time, he didn't give in to his emotions as his mind was stronger than ever.

He closed his eyes once and when he snapped them open, his expression was that of utter coldness.

"Paragon, I believe you owe me an explanation."

"So serious, how scary." Lilith chuckled, "Join me in your consciousness space."

As Felix entered his consciousness space, a place that once buzzed with the presence and energy of his tenants, a starkly different scene welcomed him.

The vibrant town that had been the hub of activity and camaraderie was now deserted, a ghostly echo of its former self...

"Where is everyone..."

Felix's heart sank as he took in the desolation, the absence of his tenants leaving a palpable void in the space that had once been filled with their laughter, arguments, and support.

As he wandered the empty streets, trying to make sense of the silence, his eyes were drawn to a tranquil area at the town's edge.

There, a pool, clear and inviting, shimmered under the gentle light of the consciousness space...And by its edge sat the Paragon of Sins, Lilith.

Lilith lounged gracefully, her posture relaxed yet inherently powerful.

She wore a two-piece swimsuit that left little to the imagination, accentuating her voluptuous body and curves.

The fabric hugged her form, a tantalizing display of her divine physique. Her presence was an arresting sight, a being of immense power and enigmatic allure at ease amid the deserted town.

Standing next to her was Candace dressed in a maid outfit. She held a tray with a couple of drinks, her posture attentive and her eyes watchful.

Felix's arrival did not go unnoticed...Lilith's eyes, sharp and discerning, lifted to meet his.

A slow, charming smile spread across her lips, and she gestured subtly, inviting him to join her. "Cutie, come sit with me...We have much to discuss."

"Felix..."

Felix neglected her completely and stared at Candace, who seemed on the verge of breaking into tears.

He could see from her expression that she wanted dearly to rush into him, but her feet refused to budge...

"What did you do to her and where is everyone?" He inquired with a bone-chilling tone.
