Chapter 1633 The Eternal Kingdom's Gate.

1633 The Eternal Kingdom's Gate.

Without much thought, Felix swiftly blinked out of his current location and reappeared inside the dimensional pocket.

As Felix's eyes adjusted to the light, he noticed a small, purple-

skinned humanoid figure on the ground.

It was Nimo, the size of a one-year-old toddler, his naked form curled up gently on the floor...

He had distinctly large, expressive eyes that added an undeniable charm to his appearance. Protruding from his head were small raccoon ears, and a fluffy black and white tail swayed softly from his back. His skin was a soft purple like Lilith's.

Yet, with all of those changes, his facial features made him resemble a miniature version of Felix!

Felix's presence seemed to capture Nimo's attention immediately.

Nimo's eyes widened in recognition and wonder, and a sparkle of excitement and happiness danced in them.

With an innocent and joyful expression, Nimo looked up at Felix and uttered a single word with a clear, melodious voice, "Dada!!"

The word, simple yet profound, hung in the air between them.

Before Felix could react, Nimo crawled on all fours rapidly toward his father and hugged his leg akin to a Koala hugging a tree.

"..." Felix glanced down speechlessly, having absolutely no idea how to behave in this situation.

He always considered Nimo as his son, but for him to turn into a human child and even show signs of talking was a different story.

It made him being a father all too real and too fast.

"I haven't even had sex with Asna and now I have a child with her..."

Felix looked at the sky with a helpless smile, knowing that if Asna could see him, she would be laughing her ass off at him.

"Loki's mouth sure is something else." Thor chuckled, "If he doesn't benefit you, he sure as hell will jinx you."

"Don't put this on me, he is the one who used his soul for the revival." Lord Loki shrugged his shoulders, having no interest in taking the blame.

Everyone was smart enough to recognize Nimo's current form due to Felix's soul being most dominant during the hatching process.

Even if the universe wanted to revive Nimo in his favorite form, it couldn't do so when his soul was that of a human.

So, the result was this...A mixture of a raccoon and a human.

"Dada!!" Nimo named again with a wide smile, showing his toothless mouth.

"I guess you won't be squealing anymore."

Felix reached out with a faint gentle smile, his hand carefully cradling Nimo, providing him with warmth and a sense of security. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

While he was shocked, it didn't mean that he had intentions of forsaking Nimo.

Whether he was in a raccoon form, a dog form, or a human form. He would always consider him as his son and would raise him as such.

Nimo hugged him tightly for a bit before he lifted his head and saw Felix's scalp...His eyes gleamed for a second and then he broke free from Felix's grasp and climbed to the top.

"It seems like he is acting based on the recollections engraved on him." Felix chuckled in amusement after Nimo sat on his head and held his hair for support.

"He is extremely attached to you because you used only your memories of your time together." Lady Sphinx nodded.

In other words, the current Nimo had absolutely no clue about his previous relationship with Lilith and had only good recollections of Felix.

"It seems like he is less intelligent than the previous Nimo," Felix commented while stretching Nimo's cheeks gently, making him giggle in enjoyment.

"It must be because his intelligence was reset after his hatching." Lady Sphinx reasoned, "Though because he isn't a unigin anymore and has no relation to Lilith, his intelligence will grow normally with the coming years."

"That's good to hear." Felix smiled.

Since Nimo was now in his humanoid form, Felix didn't want him to grow into an adult form while still calling him Dada, that would be too weird.

...

A couple of days later...

Felix could be seen sitting on his throne in the void nation's dimensional pocket. He returned after spending some quality time with Nimo and checking almost everything about him.

For example, what did he eat? Was he an immortal? Could he be harmed? Did he still possess the powers of void and seven sins?..etc.

Felix was pleasantly surprised by his findings.

Meanwhile,Candace and the rest of the councilmen were standing in front of him...Their eyes were affixed on Nimo, who was wearing a cute black hoodie and a pair of shorts, sitting on top of Felix's head while gazing at them curiously.

None of them expected Felix to return with their little god in a toddler form, leaving them staring at him speechlessly.

"Have you finished your preparations?" Felix asked, unbothered by their looks.

"Cough, yes, everything and everybody is ready." Arthur switched back to his serious attitude, "We are just awaiting your orders."

"Alright, inform everybody we will be heading out in the upcoming days after I establish a direct portal to the gate." Felix nodded, excusing them all but Candace.

"I will be going now, take care of Nimo before I return," Felix said as he pulled Nimo down and handed him to Candace.

Nimo didn't throw a tantrum as he held onto Candace's supple chest and kept calling for her name.

"Ca ca!" "Ca ca!"...

Since Candace was always taking care of Nimo in Felix's memories, Nimo had a favorable impression of her.

"Are you hungry?" Candace said with a baby voice as she kept rubbing her face gently against Nimo's.

Felix departed them be and took off on his own.

The moment he exited the dimensional pocket, he created a void portal, which connected him to the entrance of a dimensional maze.

It was an enigmatic and colossal structure that served as the only known pathway to the Eternal Kingdom's elusive gate.

He was already informed of the path leading to the eternal kingdom as it wasn't a secret...All primogenitors knew about it after it was first discovered by Lord Dune.

If it wasn't for him, no one else would have found it.

It was for a valid reason as the entrance looming before Felix led to an intricate weave of archways and portals, each connected to a different dimension!

With a nonchalant expression, Felix stepped forward, crossing the threshold into the maze.

Immediately, the scenery around him shifted.

He found himself in a realm where the laws of physics seemed altered, the gravity fluctuating and the landscape constantly changing.

The sky above swirled with iridescent colors, and the ground beneath him was a mosaic of ever-shifting tiles.

He proceeded with caution, aware that one wrong turn could lead him astray into an endless loop of bizarre and unpredictable worlds.

The maze was not just a physical challenge but a test of mental acuity and intuition.

Each junction presented multiple choices, each portal a gateway to a realm more peculiar than the last.

In one, the ground was a transparent glass overlooking a vast cosmos. In another, gigantic flora towered above, their leaves casting strange, dancing shadows.

"They sure made it inaccessible to mortals." Thor sneered.

"They placed millions of dimensions between us and them like our existence is seen as filth in their eyes," J?rmungandr said coldly.

The majority of primogenitors had followed Lord Dune's map and reached the gate too. However, no one anwsered them on the other side.

The only two times a reaction was erected from them were for Lord Shiva and the Ancestral Dragon.

Ever since the fate that befell the Ancestral Dragon and his people, none of them dared to get close to it again.

Felix was the first person after the ancestral dragon and everybody was somewhat curious if it was still the same or if something had changed about it.

After a short journey of encountering various oddities ‚Äì floating islands, inverted waterfalls, and creatures that defied imagination, Felix emerged at last into an area filled with beautiful golden illuminating clouds.

When he pierced through the clouds, the gate to the Eternal Kingdom emerged before him, causing him to come to a halt.

Towering in stature and grand in design, its surface shimmering with a celestial radiance that seemed to capture and reflect the light of distant stars!

The gate's architecture was intricate, featuring elegant motifs and patterns that intertwined harmoniously, each detail a testament to otherworldly craftsmanship!

Flanked by towering pillars that seemed to reach toward the heavens, the gate conveyed a sense of solemnity and reverence.

The top of the gate arched gracefully, culminating in a magnificent crest that radiated with an ethereal glow, imbuing the surroundings with a gentle, golden light.

Upon closer inspection, the gold appeared to be alive, subtly pulsating with energy, as if the gate itself was breathing!

Carvings of mythical creatures and deities adorned its surface, each figure etched with such precision and care that they appeared almost lifelike, ready to leap off the gate and into the realm beyond.

It was so magnificent, that even the least artistic person in the universe would be forced to gaze at it in awe.

"I feel like it's calling me..."

Felix expressed with a faint murmur, feeling like his seven hearts and unigin cores were trying to leap out of his throat and enter it.

"That's not the gate calling you." Lilith remarked with a faint smirk, "That's the celestial energy on the other side."

"It's like I am put in a withdrawal for a drug that I haven't even experienced that much." Felix frowned, not liking the feeling that much.

"Push the gate open and you will come to understand why." Lilith chuckled.
