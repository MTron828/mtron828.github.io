Chapter 727: Hotel

Translator: CKtalon

Xia Liuchuan looked over and saw that it was a tiger with wings on its back. Azure lightning danced on its body as though every cell was flashing with lightning.

The tiger immediately saw Xia Liuchuan and the other two. It flapped its wings and instantly transformed into lightning.

“Not good!” Xia Liuchuan’s expression changed as he summoned an ancient sword. The ancient sword split into two at every turn until there were eight. It transformed into a sword formation that resembled a metallic wall of copper and iron that defended Xia Liuchuan.

Dugu Ge rapidly retreated like a ghost. He was unbelievably fast. Zhou Wen’s all-out use of Transcendent Flying Immortal was not much better.

Zhang Chunqiu flicked his sleeve and talismans appeared in front of him, turning into a talisman formation that protected his body.

At that instant, an azure bolt of lightning tore through the sky and transformed into a lightning net. Instantly, it enveloped the sword formation and the talisman formation. No matter how fast Dugu Ge’s movement technique was, he wasn’t as fast as the lightning. He was also enveloped.

Rumble!

The sword formation shattered and the talismans were burned. The might of the lightning was like heavenly punishment that could destroy everything.

“Ah!” The three of them cried out tragically as their bodies convulsed from the lightning. Their hair was smoking.

Zhou Wen, who was riding with the wooden log on his shoulder, looked in the direction behind him in puzzlement. He saw lightning striking in the distant mountain, producing incessant rumbling sounds. He couldn’t help but mutter to himself, “Why is this lightning so terrifying? Could it be that the lightning and rain have mutated? From the looks of it, I should rush to the city ahead and find a place to stay.”

Zhou Wen urged the Great Might Vajra Bull, hoping that it could run faster.

However, the big guy was panting in exhaustion. It had no way of running any faster.

Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. The dimensionalization was still limited to Earth itself and didn’t involve the satellites outside. Therefore, the Federation could still guarantee basic communication with artificial satellites.

If the artificial satellites were affected in the future, the means of communication would be even weaker.

Thunder rumbled in the distance as bolts of lightning descended from the sky. The sound of thunder was terrifying.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t struck by lightning. He rushed all the way and finally arrived at a nearby city at 6 p.m.

The lightning in the mountains rumbled, but it wasn’t that terrifying in the city. It was just a little cloudy. There was a drizzle that didn’t feel cold. It felt refreshing when the rain landed on his skin.

This city was relatively small. After the dimensional storms, it had suffered a serious loss of population. Now, very few shops opened on both sides of the streets. There were very few pedestrians. Most of them had probably moved to a large city.

This was a good thing for Zhou Wen. At the very least, there weren’t many onlookers wagging their tongues at him as he rode on a bull and carried a log. Occasionally, pedestrians would pass by and look at him in surprise.

Not long after Zhou Wen entered the city, he saw a small hotel. The door of the hotel was open, but there was no one inside. The tables and couches were in a mess and there was quite a bit of dust on them. From the looks of it, the owner had already left.

Zhou Wen went in and found a room. He realized that there was a bed with a blanket in there, so he chose to stay.

In any case, he only needed to rest for a while before continuing on his journey. He didn’t have too high a requirement for a place to stay. All he needed to do was shield himself from the elements.

Shortly after Zhou Wen entered the hotel, it began pouring heavily outside. The rain seemed to be water from an overturned basin. In just a short period of time, rainwater began to pool on the roads. The sewers were unable to keep up with the quantity of rainwater.

From the looks of it, I can only continue on my journey after the rain stops. Just as Zhou Wen was about to put down the log on his shoulder, the antelope suddenly tugged at him, indicating for him to look at the ground. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Zhou Wen looked down and saw a few words on the ground. It was obvious that the antelope had written them with its hooves.

“Body must remain inseparable from the log. Separation means certain death.”

“What do you want? This place is still far from the Imperial Capital. I can’t keep carrying it, right?” Zhou Wen said gloomily.

“Can’t you read? Do you not know what it means for your body to remain inseparable from the log” The antelope gave Zhou Wen a disdainful look before writing a line on the ground.

So that’s how it is. Is it fine as long as my body doesn’t leave the log? Zhou Wen placed the log on the ground and sat on it.

With his body greatly enervated, Zhou Wen could finally heave a sigh of relief.

This piece of wood was heavy. Even after using the power of the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul, he still felt that his body couldn’t take it.

Since he couldn’t leave the log, he didn’t even need to sleep on the bed. Zhou Wen pulled a blanket over himself and slept on the log.

The antelope slept comfortably on the bed; so did the chick. It even covered itself with a blanket by pecking a rug over.

With the heavy rain outside, Zhou Wen didn’t dare rashly set off. He planned on leaving after the rain stopped.

“That’s not how you kick a ball...”

Zhou Wen was sleeping soundly when a voice suddenly sounded. It nearly made him jump up in fright.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen still remembered the words that the “body must remain inseparable from the log.” He forcefully stopped himself from leaping off the log.

When he opened his eyes and took a closer look, he realized that the television in the room had turned on and it was playing an old movie.

I was nearly scared to death. How did this crappy television switch on by itself? Zhou Wen turned his head and saw that the chick had woken up at some point in time. It was fiddling with a remote control with its claws.

“I’m sleeping. Stop fooling around.” Zhou Wen reached out and sucked the remote control over. Then, he used the remote control to turn off the television. Seeing that it was still early and that the rain was still pouring outside, Zhou Wen lay down and continued sleeping.

He had just fallen asleep when he was suddenly woken up by a sound.

“This move is clearly called An Old Man Pushing A Cart. Don’t write me off as ignorant...”

Zhou Wen was woken up again and saw the television turn on again. It was playing the old movie.

“Little Feifei, stop fooling around, alright? Let me rest for a while. I’m really tired.” Zhou Wen was just about to take the chick’s remote when he realized that the chick wasn’t holding the remote at all. The remote was still beside him. The chick crawled out of the blanket and looked at him blankly.

What’s going on? Did I touch the remote control myself? That’s not right... That’s not right... This hotel has been abandoned for some time. There’s no electricity. How can the television be switched on? Zhou Wen finally snapped out of his daze and sat up to carefully watch the television.

At this glance, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but change his expression. This was because the television’s power cable was hanging down. It wasn’t plugged in at all. Even if there was electricity in the hotel, it was impossible for the television to be switched on.

“Watch and see...” The old movie on the television was still playing. Zhou Wen frowned as he stared at the television and used Truth Listener to inspect it.
