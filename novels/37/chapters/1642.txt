Chapter 1643 Treasurefall Money

Under the envelopment of the Money Domain, all sorts of powers were immediately sealed. Even Essence Energy couldn’t circulate normally.

Xiao’s figure immediately sank as though he had fallen out of a special trajectory. When he moved again, he couldn’t leave behind any afterimages. Even the Essence Energy circulation in his body stopped, preventing him from releasing it.

“You are still too young to fight me.” Toad Immortal’s tongue moved again as he instantly appeared in front of Xiao and swept towards his neck.

Xiao was unable to enter the void trajectory again, making it difficult for him to dodge the tongue. He could only use his hand to block the golden light.

Bang!

Xiao’s body was sent flying. The tongue chased after him like a bolt of lightning and lashed around him.

Xiao tried his best, but he could barely block the tongue’s attacks. He didn’t have the strength to counterattack as he was constantly struck.

This was still a result of him maintaining his mental mutation state. Otherwise, he might have been swallowed by the tongue. Jiuyang and the electromagnetic tentacle monster were also within the range of the Money Domain. Under the influence of the Money Domain, the Sun God Light on Jiuyang’s body immediately converged. It could only circulate in his body without being released.

The electromagnetic storm around the electromagnetic tentacle monster vanished, revealing its true body.

What was previously thought to be a huge octopus wasn’t the case. Its main body was like a meat pillar made of intertwined tentacles. The tentacles extended out from the meat pillar. And in the middle of the meat pillar, there was a huge eyeball wrapped around it. Its wheel-like pupil was looking left and right, making it look extremely strange.

This was because its body had turned into white jade. It looked like a white jade statue, but it wasn’t that terrifying. If it was its original color and appearance, it would probably be even more terrifying.

Although the electromagnetic monster and Jiuyang couldn’t release their Essence Energy, their Essence Energy was still circulating in their bodies. It wasn’t completely sealed.

This was thanks to them being at the Heaven level. If it were some low-level creature, their Essence Energy would probably be completely sealed, crippling them.

Xiao wanted to summon his Companion Beasts, but he realized that he couldn’t. The sealing effects of the Money Domain were just too powerful.

Ding! Toad Immortal suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a golden beam. Xiao had already sensed that the golden beam was somewhat different from the tongue from before, but he had no chance of dodging. All he could do was deliver a punch.

When the fist collided with the golden light, Xiao saw that it was a golden ancient coin. The ancient coin seemed to contain a huge suction force as it stuck to his fist. Instantly, Xiao felt the Essence Energy in his body vanish without a trace. The last bit of resistance was wiped away.

“Die.” Toad Immortal’s tongue swept over again.

Without Essence Energy, although Xiao’s physical strength wasn’t bad, it was difficult for him to withstand Toad Immortal’s tongue. Although he tried his best to push the tongue away, he was still pulled towards Toad Immortal’s mouth.

Even if Jiuyang wanted to save him, most of his strength had been sealed. He couldn’t rush over in time, much less with the electromagnetic monster still pestering him.

Just as Xiao was about to be pulled into Toad Immortal’s mouth, he suddenly saw a saber beam slash down and strike the middle of Toad Immortal’s tongue. Although this strike failed to sever Toad Immortal’s tongue, it still left a wound. Alarmed and in pain, Toad Immortal retracted his tongue, allowing Xiao to be liberated.

“Zhou Wen?” Xiao retreated and saw that the person who had struck out was Zhou Wen.

“Gentlemen, how about we cooperate and kill him first?” Zhou Wen asked.

Toad Immortal’s strength was extremely terrifying. Zhou Wen could barely survive alone. After Toad Immortal finished off Xiao, it would probably be him and Tsukuyomi next.

The enemy of an enemy was a friend. As long as he could kill Toad Immortal, Zhou Wen didn’t mind temporarily cooperating with the Saints of the Holy Land.

“Alright.” Xiao was straightforward as he agreed. At the same time, he said, “You can crack his power?”

Jiuyang also wanted to know the answer to this question. Everyone had clearly seen Zhou Wen slash out a saber beam in Toad Immortal’s domain. Clearly, he wasn’t suppressed by the domain’s power.

Jiuyang and Xiao wanted to know if Zhou Wen could only exempt himself or if he could help them. If Zhou Wen could only exempt himself, they couldn’t recover their combat strength, making any form of cooperation useless.

“Probably, but I have a condition. After killing him, everything on him will belong to me,” Zhou Wen said as he dodged the furious Toad Immortal’s attacks.

“Deal.” Jiuyang was still somewhat hesitant, but Xiao agreed immediately.

“Xiao…” Jiuyang wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Xiao.

“Nothing is more important than survival. Let’s survive first,” Xiao said with a wave of his hand.

Jiuyang didn’t say anything else. In fact, he didn’t have the time to say anything else. The electromagnetic monster continued attacking crazily. Without the power of the Sun God Light, Jiuyang’s strength was much weaker than the huge electromagnetic monster.

When Toad Immortal saw that Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy wasn’t sealed, and how he was stronger than before, killing intent surged in his heart. He opened his mouth and spat out another Treasurefall Money, turning it into a golden beam that smashed at Zhou Wen. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Seeing Xiao’s outcome, Zhou Wen already knew how terrifying the Treasurefall Money was. How was it possible for him to allow it to stick to him? He used instant transmission to dodge the Treasurefall Money’s attack.

As the Teacher Domain simulated more and more trajectories of the Money Domain, it almost reached completion. Although he couldn’t condense an Essence Energy Art, it had a faint restraining effect on the Money Domain, allowing Zhou Wen to obtain more power over it.

However, at the instant Zhou Wen phased into existence, the Treasurefall Money slammed into his forehead.

Zhou Wen immediately felt the Essence Energy in his body vanish as he fell from the sky.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s physical strength and reaction were still present. He somersaulted and landed on the ground, preventing his head from hitting the ground.

Zhou Wen wanted to gather his Essence Energy, but he couldn’t control them. Apart from the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder circulating, the other Essence Energy Arts were completely sealed. The Dragon King armor on his body was sealed as it transformed into a tattoo that returned to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen’s connection with the other eight Companion Beasts was instantly severed, greatly weakening Zhou Wen’s strength.

Zhou Wen reached out to remove the ancient coin on his forehead, but it seemed to be stuck to his bones. Unless Zhou Wen chopped off his head, it was impossible for him to remove the ancient coin.

“I was once invincible in the Mythical era. To think a few mere humans have the delusion of fighting me,” Toad Immortal said disdainfully as he brandished his tongue again and swept it at Zhou Wen, who had lost his Essence Energy.

Toad Immortal felt that Zhou Wen was the greatest threat. Although Zhou Wen’s strength was the weakest, he was also proficient in taboo powers. He likely posed the greatest threat to him.
