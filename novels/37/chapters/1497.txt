Chapter 1498 Dubhe

Zhou Wen wasn’t the only one who knew of this news, but to most people, it didn’t seem to matter whether the celestial body on the Cube was Dubhe or not.

“Charlatan, the rumors floating about point to that celestial body being Dubhe of the Big Dipper. What do you think?” Xia Liuchuan immediately called Zhang Chunqiu. The Zhang family was better at these things.

Zhang Chunqiu said, “That’s Dubhe of the Big Dipper all right. However, I advise you not to have any ideas about it.”

“Why?” Xia Liuchuan asked in puzzlement.

“You should know that Dubhe is also called the Ravenous Wolf Star, right?” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“I do. Although I’m not as good at astronomical observation as you are, I’ve heard of Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Isn’t it synonymous with the Wisdom Star and the Auspicious Star?” Xia Liuchuan said.

“That’s because you don’t know much about Ravenous Wolf or what it entails. Dubhe is indeed auspicious, but under certain circumstances, the Ravenous Wolf is a very ominous sign. It’s best not to touch it before things are clear,” Zhang Chunqiu said solemnly. “For real?” Xia Liuchuan still didn’t believe it.

“It’s up to you whether you believe it or not.” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say anything else and hung up.

“I didn’t say that I doubt you. Why get so worked up?” Xia Liuchuan muttered and put down the phone.

Many people asked Zhang Chunqiu about it, but Zhang Chunqiu only said some ambiguous words to the average person. He only persuaded a few people not to touch Dubhe.

“We have to retrieve the Companion Beast of Dubhe no matter what.” Berserker Immortal’s figure appeared in the unfinished Skysplit Tower as he ordered Immortal and the Guardians.

“Your Excellency, we will definitely do our best to fight for it, but you should know that with the rise of the heroes on Earth, our League of Guardians hasn’t been able to gain an absolute advantage. Together with the uncertain variables like cosmic creatures, it’s really unknown if we can obtain Dubhe’s Companion Beast,” Immortal said with a bow.

“I only care about the results,” Berserker Immortal said coldly.

“I also hope for a good outcome,” Immortal said neither obsequiously nor superciliously.

Berserker Immortal’s gaze was like a sword as he stared at Immortal, as though he wanted to split his body apart. However, Immortal only stood there with his eyes lowered as though he hadn’t seen anything.

“Whoever can retrieve Dubhe’s Companion Beast can become the representative of our Immortals in the mortal world. I will personally bestow him as the strongest Guardian of the Immortals,” said Berserker Immortal.

The Immortals had always respected the strong. Berserker Immortal believed that it was the same for humans. He wanted to use this to incite an internal division among the League of Guardians.

However, Blood Shaman and the other Guardians didn’t seem to hear him as they continued to stand by Immortal’s side.

A cold glint flashed in Berserker Immortal’s eyes, but he suppressed his killing intent. Just as Wang Mingyuan had said, the situation on Earth was already relatively clear. Even if the Immortals began nurturing new factions now, it wouldn’t be of any use anytime soon.

If he wanted to maintain his competitiveness on Earth, he had to continue using the League of Guardians. There weren’t many other options. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The six families had always been vassals of the Holy Land. Although the six families wanted to escape the Holy Land’s control, it wasn’t necessarily possible for them to completely escape it. Secondly, even if they could really escape, it might be a result of jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.

There was also the federal government, the Holy Spirit Association, and the various warlords. Under Hui Haifeng’s leadership, the federal government had been developing the strength of humans, so it was even more impossible for them to be used by the Immortals.

The Holy Spirit Association directly devoured Guardians. If the Immortals worked with them, they would probably only be feeding them. It would be difficult to truly control them.

As for the warlords from the various lands, if there was a chance, Berserker Immortal didn’t mind giving them some benefits and getting them under the Immortal’s employ. However, there weren’t many warlords who could truly achieve the level of the six families. Gaining control of them couldn’t be done anytime soon.

At this stage, Berserker Immortal could only get the League of Guardians to continue working for the Immortals.

However, Berserker Immortal had already made up his mind to establish a faction that completely obeyed the Immortals as soon as possible and kick the League of Guardians out.

“Don’t worry. My race will definitely help you when needed. Skysplit Tower has to be repaired as soon as possible. Otherwise, even if my race wants to help you, we won’t be able to deliver the items to you.” Although Berserker Immortal said that, he thought to himself, All I need is a portion of Skysplit Tower repaired and I can use it to enter Earth and reestablish a human faction that belongs to the Immortals. Once I succeed, I’ll kill that bastard Wang Mingyuan first.

“Skysplit Tower has been attacked twice in a row. Many materials are nowhere to be found. It’s very difficult to repair it. Your Excellency, I wonder if you have a way to repair it?” Immortal kicked the ball back to Berserker Immortal’s court.

Although Berserker Immortal wanted to kill Immortal with one strike, he couldn’t do so. All he could do was say, “There’s naturally a way. Previously, my race placed Guardian cocoons in many mystic realms. Now, those mystic realms have already transformed into dimensional zones. I’ll send you the information regarding the Guardian cocoons. After you find them, use the Guardian inside to help you and you can naturally easily occupy those dimensional zones and obtain the resources inside.”

“We will definitely do our best to serve you, Your Excellency.” Immortal bowed with the Guardians.

Zhou Wen hadn’t figured out what was going on with the land and the giant bird’s skeleton, but he didn’t dare take the risk to experiment. All he could do was ignore it for the time being.

At that moment, Zhou Wen was studying his Companion Beasts.

After the two Golden Wyrms gave birth, another Golden Wyrm appeared. However, this Golden Wyrm seemed a little different from its parents.

Golden Wyrm: Calamity (Evolvable)

Life Providence: Metal Life

Life Soul: Gold Essence

Wheel of Destiny: Love is Stronger than Gold. Terror Form: Stator (S-grade)

Calamity Zone: True Gold Fire Refinement (Human Realm)

Strength: 100

Speed: 100

Constitution: 100

Essence Energy: 100

Talent Skill: Midas Touch, Strangle, Unstoppable, Dominance Body

Companion Form: Stator

Zhou Wen didn’t know what a Stator Companion Form was. He made the Golden Wyrm appear in its companion form and realized that its body had turned into a coiled dragon pillar.

It was clearly a pillar, but for some reason, it was called a stator.

With the experience from the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, Zhou Wen tried putting the three Golden Wyrms into the fusion frame. Indeed, he could fuse them. Furthermore, the success rate was 99.9%. There was almost no chance of failure.

Should I fuse them? Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant. After all, these were three Calamity-grade creatures. If he fused them, even if a Hell-grade creature appeared, it would only be a Companion Beast. It didn’t seem worth it.
