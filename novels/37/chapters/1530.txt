Chapter 1531: Cemetery

“I know who these people are!” Grim Demon suddenly shouted.

Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon. As Grim Demon had always been in his Terror form, the others couldn’t see him.

Therefore, the elder and the group of fearful people only saw Zhou Wen turn his head to the side as though he was staring into the void. This made them panic even more. They increasingly found Zhou Wen incomprehensible. He was capricious, solid proof that he was the Lost Paradise’s devil king.

“They call this place Lost Paradise, not the Land of the Fallen, nor is it hell. If this place is really related to the myths and legends of Lost Paradise, it’s not difficult to guess the origins of these people. Adam and Eve were tempted by Satan and secretly ate the forbidden fruit before being expelled from the Garden of Eden. If the location of this story isn’t Earth but the dimension, then all of this can be explained,” Grim Demon said.

Zhou Wen immediately understood what Grim Demon meant. Grim Demon meant that these people were the descendants of Adam and Eve.

However, on second thought, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. In the myths and legends of the pantheon of God, Adam and Eve should be the founders of humanity. According to Grim Demon’s guess, it didn’t seem right.

If Adam and Eve had reproduced here after being chased out of the Garden of Eden and they had never been to Earth, why would there be such legends on Earth?

As though reading Zhou Wen’s mind, Grim Demon said, “Adam and Eve betrayed God and secretly ate the forbidden fruit. After being banished, where could they go? Apart from a place like the Garden of Eden, the dimension wasn’t suitable for humans to survive. The only place they could go to was probably Lost Paradise. Look at their bodies. You can tell that there aren’t any Mythical humans among them. They are all Legendary or Epic creatures based on your standards. Yet, such standards can build a city in the dimension. Only by being protected by the Lost Paradise can this be possible.”

Zhou Wen knew that Grim Demon was right. He could already vaguely sense the dimensional nomological powers in this small mountain city, but it was much weaker than the true dimensional laws Zhou Wen had previously encountered.

This place was clearly affected by Lost Paradise, allowing these humans to survive here.

However, this was only Grim Demon’s guess. Perhaps these humans were sent over from Earth by dimensional experts as experimental subjects.

It was even possible that some humans on Earth had some fortuitous encounters and accidentally ended up here.

“You are the king of this city?” Zhou Wen stared at the elder and asked.

The elder was feeling uneasy and guessing what the devil king wanted after not getting a reply from Zhou Wen after quite some time. He jumped with fright at Zhou Wen’s abrupt question. He knelt on the ground and said in fear, “Your Devilish Excellency, you are the only king. I’m only the city lord of this city and your slave. If you need a living sacrifice, please take my life and spare the child.”

“Since you know that I’m the only king here, tell me. Who gave you the guts to negotiate with me?” Zhou Wen thought to himself,?Instead of wasting my breath explaining, why don’t I use my identity as the devil king to figure things out?

Everyone was immediately alarmed and afraid. The elder kowtowed repeatedly. “Your Devilish Excellency, we definitely don’t have any intention of offending you, much less negotiating with you. We only wish to obtain your pity. Our ancestors were able to survive here because of your benevolence. Our lives are yours, and everything here is yours. How can we have the right to negotiate with you? We only hope that Your Devilish Excellency will be magnanimous…”

As Zhou Wen listened to the elder’s drone on, he increasingly felt that Grim Demon’s guess was right. These people might really be descendants of Adam and Eve.

“Take me around this city,” Zhou Wen said indifferently as he declined to comment on the elder’s pleas.

“Yes, Your Devilish Excellency. I’ll show you around. What do you want to see?” the elder hurriedly asked.

“What do you think?” Zhou Wen glanced at him indifferently.

The elder immediately broke out into a cold sweat as his mind raced. Soon, he seemed to think of something and hurriedly said, “Your Devilish Excellency, I understand. Please follow me.”

The elder led the way while the others hurriedly retreated to the sides, not daring to be in Zhou Wen’s way.

The style of this city was very similar to the ancient style of the West District. Zhou Wen remembered that the word to describe it was ‘gothic.’

It was obvious that this place was very backward. There were no electronic devices or even lights. Clearly, there was zero technology here.

When he walked to the middle of the city, Zhou Wen was surprised to discover a Cube. Like the Cube on Earth, the Cube here also displayed the scene of Dubhe.

There’s actually a Cube here. That makes things easier. I just need to pass through the Cube and reach Dubhe before I can teleport back to Earth.?Zhou Wen was first delighted before he rejected this method.

Through the Cube, one could indeed reach Dubhe, but to reach it in such a way, one had to clear Dubhe’s dimensional zone or they wouldn’t be able to leave.

This was previously verified in the Venusian dimensional zone. As long as one entered the dimensional zone through the Cube, they could only fight to the death. Unless one cleared the level, there was no chance of leaving.

The elder didn’t know what Zhou Wen was thinking. He led the way with his back hunched, not daring to look back at him.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word, so he didn’t dare spout nonsense.

Although the city was ancient, it was filled with an artistic aura. There were many carvings on the buildings. Statues of humans and strange creatures could be seen everywhere.

After walking for a while, the elder took Zhou Wen to a garden. There were many flowers planted in the garden, making it look beautiful.

Toward the back of the garden stood two tombstones. Zhou Wen didn’t recognize the words on them. When Grim Demon saw them, he immediately shouted, “There’s no mistake about it. These fellows are the descendants of Adam and Eve. They are the tombstones of Adam and Eve.”

“Your Devilish Excellency, our ancestors were your friends. Unfortunately, they don’t have the mighty power of immortality like you. They can only be buried here.” As the elder spoke, he felt abnormally uneasy, unsure if his guess was right.

The outcome was unknown if he guessed wrongly and angered the devil king. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Get out,” Zhou Wen said coldly.

“Yes, Your Devilish Excellency.” The elder glanced at Demonic Neonate in Zhou Wen’s arms, but he didn’t dare say a word of defiance. He retreated with his men and closed the garden’s gates.

“See? Those fellows are the descendants of Adam and Eve,” Grim Demon said smugly to Zhou Wen.
