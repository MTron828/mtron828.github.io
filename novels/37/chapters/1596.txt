Chapter 1597: You Are An Exception

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen was still constantly studying the various abilities and uses of the Teacher Domain.

The same piece of paper had different uses in the hands of different people.

In the hands of an ordinary person, it might only be used as a diary or a post-it note. It might even be used to wipe one’s mucus, but in the hands of an artist, it might be a world-class painting. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Different people produced different effects on the same item.

No matter how powerful a Calamity Zone was, it required the user to have enough control and imagination. Otherwise, just the domain itself was strong, but the person ultimately couldn’t be considered a true expert.

Just as Zhou Wen was studying the Teacher Domain, he suddenly heard someone shouting outside. He listened carefully and realized that changes had happened on the Cube again. Another person was about to attempt the Big Dipper Palaces.

Zhou Wen originally didn’t care who attempted the Star Palaces. Even a Heaven-level creature wouldn’t be able to clear it so easily.

Taking the level with Starlord Cherished Kismet as an example, the stronger the offensive strength of a Heaven-level creature, the more miserable their death would be.

However, when Zhou Wen heard someone shout out “fsukuyomi,” his heart stirred. He hurriedly switched on his phone and opened the livestream. Indeed, Tsukuyomi had already entered Dubhe Palace.

Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised that Tsukuyomi could reach a place as distant as Dubhe Palace.

Ignoring the fact that the other planets had Cubes, even if they didn’t, Tsukuyomi’s spatial teleportation ability wasn’t inferior to Zhou Wen’s. It wasn’t impossible for her to teleport to Dubhe Palace.

Zhou Wen was thinking about something else. Tsukuyomi is the Lady Goddess of the Moon, so she definitely has the power of moonlight. And that toad is restrained by the power of moonlight. Doesn’t that mean that Tsukuyomi is the nemesis of that Toad Immortal? I wonder what level she has reached?

As Zhou Wen was thinking, Tsukuyomi had already walked to the door. Two ghost phantoms appeared in front of her and pushed open Dubhe Palace’s door for her.

Starlord Ravenous Wolf seemed to feel pressure when he saw Tsukuyomi. He didn’t wait for Tsukuyomi to walk over before launching an attack. A terrifying surge of light blasted at Tsukuyomi like a volcanic eruption.

How will Tsukuyomi deal with Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s starlight domain? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

In fact, it wasn’t just Zhou Wen. Everyone was curious about Tsukuyomi’s performance.

Tsukuyomi’s domain was called “Ghost Parade.” It had the ability to summon ghosts, but inside the starlight domain, the starlight attacked indiscriminately. Summoning a single ghost was actually not much different from summoning a hundred ghosts.

When the light blast descended, Tsukuyomi didn’t dodge, nor did she have any intention of attacking. Hashihime, who was wearing a kimono and seemed to be enveloped by darkness, appeared beside Tsukuyomi. The paper umbrella in her hand opened as blurry neon colors appeared around her, blocking

the light blast.

Hashihime held the umbrella and followed Tsukuyomi. Tsukuyomi slowly walked towards Starlord Ravenous Wolf. No matter how powerful the light blast was, it couldn’t break through her defense.

Just Hashihime alone managed to block Starlord Ravenous Wolfs starlight domain. From the looks of it, Tsukuyomi is already at the top of the Hell level, Zhou Wen thought.

‘When Starlord Ravenous Wolf saw that the blast of light couldn’t do anything to Tsukuyomi, he immediately charged down, hoping to engage her in close combat.

However, when he rushed over, ghosts suddenly appeared. Starlord Ravenous Wolf was immediately surrounded.

It was difficult to beat a number advantage even for the best of people, especially when the number advantage was overwhelming. Soon, Starlord Ravenous Wolf was ganked to the point of death. Tsukuyomi remained standing under the umbrella and didn’t make a move. After Starlord Ravenous Wolf

died, she walked towards the teleportation nexus.

“Goddess Tsukuyomi is too powerful!”

“Ghost Parade. Who can withstand such strength at the same level? Whoever fights Tsukuyomi is equivalent to fighting a hundred alone.”

Before anyone could say anything, they saw a new scene appear on the Cube’s screen. It was the projection of Merak Star Palace.

“Tsukuyomi wants to challenge Starlord Titan Gate?”

“Of course she has to. Her domain is virtually invincible among peers of the same level. I wouldn’t find it strange even if she chose all the Big Dipper stars, much less the second Star Palace.”

‘As everyone discussed, Tsukuyomi had already pushed open the door to the Merak Star Palace.

Hashihime kept following Tsukuyomi. Just as the door to Merak Star Palace opened, the ferocious ghosts rushed in. A fox-like shadow rushed into Starlord Titan Gate’s body the moment he opened his mouth.

Starlord Titan Gate’s open mouth closed. He couldn’t make a sound. He lost control of his body and could hardly fight the ghosts.

Before Starlord Titan Gate could escape the control, the hundred ghosts had already surged forward and devoured him.

Tsukuyomi killed two Starlords without even lifting a finger. She walked into the teleportation nexus once again.

However, this time, the Cube didn’t produce a new Star Palace. Instead, a ranking appeared.

Everyone hurriedly looked at the rankings. Their eyes landed on first place, but they realized that first place wasn’t Tsukuyomi. It was still the Tiger Soul General.

Tsukuyomi was ranked second despite slaying two Starlords.

“How did this happen? Egg Sovereign used a Companion Beast after all. Tsukuyomi didn’t even use a Companion Beast. Why is she ranked below Egg Sovereign?”

“That’s right, this doesn’t make sense!”

“Of course, Egg Sovereign’s Tiger Soul General is even stronger. He killed two Ravenous Wolves alone and instantly killed Titan Gate. His strength is far above Tsukuyomi’s.”

“That’s right. The Tiger Soul General is undoubtedly stronger.”

People were discussing who was stronger—Tiger Soul General or Tsukuyomi. Soon, they were divided into two factions. No one could convince the other. All sorts of analysis threads constantly appeared on the Internet.

Zhou Wen had already teleported outside Merak the moment the rankings appeared. Now, he only hoped that Tsukuyomi hadn’t teleported over from the Cube on a particular planet. That way, he wouldn’t be able to see her even if he came to Merak.

After arriving on Merak, Zhou Wen quickly instant transmitted towards the Star Palace’s entrance. Before he entered the planet, he saw Tsukuyomi’s figure rush out of the high-temperature liquid.

Hashihime was still standing behind Tsukuyomi as she held the umbrella. All the high temperature, radiation, and shock waves were isolated by the umbrella.

“are you looking for me?” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.

“That’s right. I want to make a deal with you,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

Although he had a plan, Lady Supreme Yin had said that it wasn’t easy to deal with Toad Immortal. To be safe, Zhou Wen decided to buy some additional insurance.

“You know that I never make deals with others,” Tsukuyomi said.

“This deal is very beneficial to you,” Zhou Wen replied.

“Whether there are benefits or not does not concern me.” Tsukuyomi remained unmoved.

Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed, but he heard Tsukuyomi continue, “However, you are an exception.”
