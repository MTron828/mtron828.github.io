Chapter 1506 Coach’s Gift

Zhou Wen only defended without attacking. He could handle the attacks easily in the beginning, but at any moment, Feng Qiuyan’s saber speed would become faster and faster. This gave Zhou Wen no choice but to activate the power of Human Sovereign and raise his physical stats to the Calamity grade. Only then could he suppress Feng Qiuyan in terms of speed, preventing him from hitting him.

This fellow’s saber is really fast-abnormally fast. It should be related to his Terror transformation ability, right? However, his powers don’t seem to be purely wind-elemental… Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Ming Xiu’s eyes lit up as he watched from the side. He subconsciously moved his toes back and forth, having the urge to join the battle.

“As expected of Coach. If I want to defeat Old Feng, I can’t let him have a chance to deliver more than three strikes. Otherwise, I’ll definitely lose. However, no matter how many strikes Old Feng strikes, he can’t even touch Coach’s clothes. This is no longer an existence on the same level,” praised Ming Xiu.

Li Xuan curled his lips and said, “Aren’t you spouting nonsense? You and Little Yanyan were taught by Old Zhou. It would be strange if you could hit him.”

However, Li Xuan had spoken too soon. He originally imagined that no matter how fast Feng Qiuyan’s saber was, there was ultimately a limit. It was impossible for it to reach the speed of a Calamity-grade.

However, this pattern clearly didn’t apply to Feng Qiuyan. In the end, Feng Qiuyan’s saber speed really broke through the speed of light. It was a speed that only a Calamity-grade could reach.

How does this fellow do it? From the looks of it, the Wind God Cave isn’t simple. There’s more to the thing inside. Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. To reach the speed of light at the Terror grade was definitely not something an ordinary Terror creature could

do.

Zhou Wen wanted to visit the Wind God Cave. If he could find the tiny palm symbol, he would be in for a killing.

If I let Feng Qiuyan’s saber speed increase as he continues slashing like this, I might not be able to dodge it. I should quickly end it. With a thought, Zhou Wen extended two fingers into the saber beam and grabbed the blade that resembled a stream of light.

Instantly, the swift saber came to an abrupt halt.

At the same time that Zhou Wen grabbed the saber, Feng Qiuyan’s legs went limp as he fell to the ground. He panted heavily as sweat gushed out. It made him look like he had just come out of a bathtub. His clothes were drenched and he looked like he had been enervated.

“As expected of Coach. You could even tell that I had reached my limit and ended the battle at the right time, preventing me from over-exerting myself.” Feng Qiuyan felt somewhat ashamed and felt that he shouldn’t have continued fighting.

Zhou Wen released his fingers that were holding the saber and used Truth Listener to scan Feng Qiuyan’s body. Seeing that he had just expended too much energy and hadn’t injured his body, he immediately felt relieved. However, he muttered inwardly, What are the attributes of Feng Qiuyan’s powers?

Zhou Wen failed to figure out what Feng Qiuyan’s attributes were despite the long observation. It looked like the power of wind, but it was somewhat different.

They aren’t anything like Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, nor are they spatial or temporal. There don’t seem to be any special attributes. They seem to be somewhat similar to my Dao Sutra and Qi Refinement Sutra, but there are also some differences. If I have to give an answer, they are much more similar to the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. However, my Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation has the power of an array formed from multiple skills combined. His power is singular, but it’s so similar to the power of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. This is somewhat odd.

Zhou Wen wasn’t too sure because Feng Qiuyan’s powers were actually very different from his Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. It wasn’t completely the same.

“Coach, how can I make myself stronger?” Feng Qiuyan was still panting as he asked Zhou Wen eagerly. His stamina had yet to recover.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what Feng Qiuyan’s powers belonged to, so it wasn’t appropriate for him to spout nonsense. However, when he saw Feng Qiuyan’s expectant gaze, he couldn’t bear to say that he didn’t know.

After some thought, Zhou Wen said to Feng Qiuyan, “I’ll give you a small item. Take it and take a look. Perhaps you will gain something.”

As he spoke, Zhou Wen took out a coin and circulated the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation to attach to the coin.

The coin instantly spun like a spinning top. When Zhou Wen released his hand, the coin floated in the air and kept spinning as though it was being propelled by infinite power. It showed no signs of falling.

“Coach, don’t worry. I definitely won’t disappoint you. I’ll figure out the mystery behind this,” Feng Qiuyan said as he stared at the spinning coin as though he had obtained a treasure.

“It’s just a trinket. Just take a look. There’s no need to mind it too much.” Zhou Wen didn’t know if this could help Feng Qiuyan figure out his powers. However, studying the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was definitely not a bad thing. With Feng Qiuyan’s high talent, he might gain some insight.

“Coach, you’ve already given Old Feng something. Shouldn’t you give me something too? You can’t favor one over the other!” Ming Xiu shamelessly asked for something.

“I’m really not good at temporal powers. I’ll give you one move.” Zhou Wen pointed at Ming Xiu.

Ming Xiu extended his hand to block, but he realized that he couldn’t block Zhou Wen’s fingers. The sword beam that bloomed on Zhou Wen’s fingers appeared half a beat later and flew past Ming Xiu’s cheek.

“Isn’t this my Tomorrow Sword Art? Coach, you’ve made it much stronger than mine!” Ming Xiu couldn’t help but be secretly delighted. Zhou Wen had actually practiced his Tomorrow Sword Art. Although he had higher attainments than him, it was still his sword art after all. He felt honored that Zhou Wen was willing to practice it.

“This isn’t Tomorrow Sword Art. Its name is Spacetime Bandit. You can use it to verify your Tomorrow Sword Art. Perhaps you will gain something.” Zhou Wen told Ming Xiu some key points of Spacetime Bandit.

As he didn’t have the skill crystal, Zhou Wen couldn’t teach it to Ming Xiu. All he could do was tell him some of his experience. Whether he could use it depended on him.

Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan acted as though they had obtained a treasure and stopped pestering Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen led the baby bear and Li Xuan back as Li Xuan explained the situation in Guide City in detail.

It turned out that in the past half a month, Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan weren’t the only ones who had come. Many experts had come to Guide City as well. Only then could Li Xuan stabilize it. Otherwise, just the manpower they had wouldn’t have been enough to defend such a large area.

Those experts came from different places. Most of them were sent over by the various factions. Hui Haifeng had also sent quite a number of people over. There were more than ten Mythical experts who had advanced using the Mythical Serum. What gave Zhou Wen a headache was that Hui Wan had also come.

Is Hui Haifeng crazy? He sent his only son to such a place? Zhou Wen felt his head ache.

“Hui Haifeng got Hui Wan to deliver a message. He said that it’s safer for his son to be with you than with him,” Li Xuan said.

“From the looks of it, Hui Haifeng isn’t that comfortable being president.” Zhou Wen could only shake his head with a bitter smile.
