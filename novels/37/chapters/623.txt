Chapter 624 Signature in Hand

"What did you steal?" Zhou Wen asked.

Liu Yun opened his mouth, but he suddenly closed it again. He was regretting it now. He shouldn’t have been greedy for the alcohol and food. After escaping, he should have left the town.

Liu Yun originally imagined that Zhou Wen wouldn’t return so quickly and would definitely be entangled by Mountain God for a long time. Who knew that Zhou Wen would be able to catch up so quickly and even have the time to set up so many Time-Blasts? If he had known, he wouldn’t have done all those things and would have long fled.

"I didn’t steal anything valuable. They’re all small things." Liu Yun changed the topic and said, "Junior Brother, you have taken the treasure too. It’s time for me to leave. Can you remove your traps?"

Liu Yun had never seen an Essence Energy Skill like Time-Blast. He had seen Life Blast in the past, and he could also see the traces of Life Blast. However, it wasn’t easy for him to see any flaws with the Explosive Fiend Man’s Time-Blast. Furthermore, it wasn’t just used on living bodies. This made him stumble and suffer.

"Sure. Sign here and you can leave." Zhou Wen placed a piece of paper and a pen in front of Liu Yun.

"Junior Brother, what are you doing?" Liu Yun had been through a lot, so he knew that things weren’t as simple as signing an autograph.

"You can leave after you sign your signature," Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun forced out a smile. "It wasn’t easy for us fellow disciples to meet. As a senior brother, I should stay and accompany you more."

"Even if you don’t want to leave, you have to sign it," Zhou Wen continued.

Liu Yun’s expression immediately turned bitter. "Junior Brother, we share the same roots, so why torment each other? Can we negotiate this nicely?"

"Don’t you want to know what Companion Beast I will use to challenge Chimera? Then I’ll let you experience it for yourself." Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun and was about to summon Tyrant Behemoth.

"I’ll sign it." Before Zhou Wen could summon Tyrant Behemoth, Liu Yun quickly picked up the paper and pen and signed his name before handing it to Zhou Wen. "Junior Brother, what’s the use of this signature?"

"As long as you don’t spout nonsense, this signature won’t be of any use. Don’t worry." Zhou Wen folded and put it away when he saw the words "Liu Yun."

In fact, the authenticity of the name didn’t matter. As long as he signed it in person, Explosive Fiend Man’s death list would take effect.

Now, with just a thought from the Explosive Fiend Man, he could kill Liu Yun who had signed his name.

"Alright, you can leave now." Zhou Wen turned around and walked towards the town square.

"Remove the traps first before you leave." Liu Yun had suffered terribly from the Time-Blast. If it wasn’t for the Time-Blast, he would have fled long ago.

After all, he was only at the Epic stage, and his Mythical pets couldn’t protect his entire body. He really couldn’t withstand the continuous explosions.

"There’s no more left. I didn’t have much time just now. I only had time to set up that many. You have already detonated them all," Zhou Wen said without turning his head.

Liu Yun’s face looked livid when he heard that. If he had known this would happen, he would have been able to escape even if he was injured. He had been robbed of the red pearl for nothing and had even signed his name for some unknown reason.

"Why aren’t you leaving? Why are you following me?" Zhou Wen asked when he saw Liu Yun follow him from behind.

"Junior Brother, I don’t feel at ease until you explain what that signature is for. It’s better I follow you." Liu Yun had seen many strange Essence Energy Skills before, so he knew of some special Essence Energy Skills that just needed a name to kill someone thousands of kilometers away.

Liu Yun didn’t know which type of Essence Energy Skill Zhou Wen had, nor did he know what use it had. How could he leave just like that?

"Up to you." Zhou Wen continued walking towards the town square.

"Junior Brother, why don’t we do this? I’ll tell you a secret of the Cape family. Why don’t you return the paper to me?" Liu Yun said as he walked.

"I hate hearing secrets the most," Zhou Wen said.

However, Liu Yun continued disapprovingly, "The secret I’m talking about isn’t an ordinary piece of news. A while back, I tried my best to sneak into the Special Inspector Bureau and the few large families and learned quite a lot of secrets. You know the Zhang family, right? The family of the Hero King, the Zhang family’s princess, Zhang Yuzhi. Do you know why the Zhang family dotes on her so much?"

"Why?" Zhou Wen was intrigued.

"Because she’s very special. In recent years, the Zhang family’s strength has increased tremendously. It has something to do with the little princess of the Zhang family. I accidentally discovered this secret when I sneaked into the Zhang family residence to steal something. Other than the few upper echelons of the Zhang family, I’m afraid I’m the only one who knows this secret." Liu Yun deliberately kept him in suspense.

Zhou Wen didn’t pursue the matter. He walked all the way to the square and saw the black cube.

Seeing that Zhou Wen didn’t pursue the matter, Liu Yun continued, "I’ll treat this secret as a free gift to you. The little princess of the Zhang family has a special Life Providence. With such a Life Providence, she can easily gain the favor of any dimensional creature, allowing them to treat her as one of their own. Think about it, this is such a terrifying ability. With Zhang Yuzhi, the Zhang family can easily grasp the habits and abilities of those Mythical creatures. Then, killing those Mythical creatures will be much easier. Such a person will be doted on like a princess no matter where they are. They definitely won’t let anything happen to her."

"Zhang Yuzhi really has such a Life Providence?" Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

"Don’t doubt me. I heard it myself. It’s definitely not fake news," Liu Yun swore.

In fact, Zhou Wen was already convinced. This was because he had seen Zhang Yuzhi use her weak body to stop the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon in its rage. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon actually didn’t injure her. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Back then, he felt that there was something odd about Zhang Yuzhi, but he didn’t think too deeply about it.

Now that he thought about it, Zhang Yuzhi really must have that ability or something even stronger.

However, Zhou Wen felt that there was still a problem with Zhang Yuzhi’s Life Providence. Back when the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon was killed, Zhang Yuzhi’s sorrow was definitely not faked.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred. Could Zhang Yuzhi’s Life Providence be two-way? If she can make dimensional creatures treat her as a friend or relative, she might have the same feelings. That might be more reasonable.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it was best if his guess didn’t come true. Otherwise, Zhang Yuzhi would be too pitiful.

If his guess was true, Zhang Yuzhi had already treated the dimensional creatures as family and friends. Yet, her family wanted to use her to kill them. That was a tragedy in itself.

As he pondered, Zhou Wen walked to the black cube and summoned Tyrant Behemoth.
