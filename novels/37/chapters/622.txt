Liu Yun escaped back to the town, but he didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he returned to the minimart at the corner of the street and took some things before walking out.

"Junior Brother should be fine, right? He won’t be killed, right?" Liu Yun looked in the direction of the lake and muttered to himself.

However, in the blink of an eye, Liu Yun muttered to himself as though he was comforting himself, "The people that Teacher tutored shouldn’t die so easily. He even has the guts to target Chimera. The Companion Beasts on him are definitely no trifling matter. They aren’t inferior to Genie. Furthermore, with the Golden Greatsword and the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, he should be able to escape even if he can’t defeat Mountain God."

After some thought, Liu Yun took a bottle of alcohol from his bag and placed it on the table by the door. He used his finger like a sword and etched a sentence on the wall beside him. "Junior Brother, thank you for your help. This bottle of vintage wine was stolen from the Family Clan of Gods with great difficulty. It’s been aged over a hundred years. Take it as my thanks. Don’t miss me. Let’s meet again if fate allows."

"What a pity. I wonder if this junior brother of mine is a wine connoisseur. If he doesn’t, wouldn’t it be a waste?" Liu Yun looked at the bottle and muttered reluctantly.

With that said, Liu Yun prepared to leave.

"You should keep the wine for yourself. Leave the thing you took from the flower to redeem your sins." A voice sounded from the roof not far away.

Liu Yun’s expression changed drastically as he looked up and saw Zhou Wen standing on the rooftop opposite him. He immediately smiled. "Junior Brother, you sure are outstanding. You killed that Mountain God so quickly. You’re much stronger than me. It’s no wonder Teacher thinks so highly of the four of you. He even called you to his side before he left. You are indeed the cream of the crop." Liu Yun said as he retreated to the side. It looked like he was about to escape.

"If I were you, I would stay still," Zhou Wen said indifferently without stopping him.

"I also wish to have a good chat with you, Junior Brother. Unfortunately, the bureau is hounding me. If I were to stay here, I’m afraid I would implicate you. That wouldn’t be nice. I’ll take my leave now." As Liu Yun spoke, he directed strength into his feet and attempted to rush out.

However, just as he exerted strength, the ground beneath his feet exploded. It was as though he had stepped on a landmine. Liu Yun’s reaction was fast enough as he tumbled away, reducing most of the explosive force. However, wherever his body rolled on the ground exploded.

"Ah!"

Screams and explosions rang out. By the time Liu Yun stopped, his body was already charred black. His hair was standing up and still smoking.

"Junior Brother, I never expected you to be proficient in Life Blast? That’s not right. You didn’t use a lifeform for the blast, so it shouldn’t be Life Blast. What skill is this?" Liu Yun stood rooted to the ground and didn’t dare move. He forced a smile and asked Zhou Wen.

"I don’t know what skill it is either. If you are interested, why don’t you try taking another step?" Zhou Wen said indifferently.

When Liu Yun was packing up, Zhou Wen had already directed Explosive Fiend Man to set up many Time-Blasts nearby to prevent him from escaping.

"Junior Brother, we are fellow disciples. Why do you have to do this? Why don’t we do this? We’ll split this treasure equally." Liu Yun took out something from his pocket.

Zhou Wen carefully sized up the item in Liu Yun’s hand. It was a blood-colored bead that was the size of a billiard ball. It was completely blood-red and crystalline, like an alluring red pearl. It flashed with a red glimmer as though something was flowing inside.

"Leave your life or leave that pearl behind. You can choose either one," Zhou Wen said.

"There’s no need to be so ruthless, right?" Liu Yun smiled bitterly.

"If it wasn’t for Teacher, you would have died the moment you lured Mountain God to me," Zhou Wen said.

In fact, it wasn’t entirely because of this that Zhou Wen didn’t kill Liu Yun. Firstly, Liu Yun’s abilities and Companion Beasts were rather odd. He didn’t know what other means he had, so Zhou Wen wasn’t completely confident that he could ensure retaining him while not having the red bead destroyed.

Zhou Wen’s interest in treasures was far greater than killing someone.

Secondly, Liu Yun had also told him about Mountain God when he left. Furthermore, there was a high chance that he was Wang Mingyuan’s student. There was no need for him to fight him to the death.

"Forget it. You are my junior brother after all? I’ll give you this treasure." As Liu Yun spoke, he threw the red pearl at Zhou Wen.

He summoned Genie at the same time and made it open up a path for him to escape in another direction. The direction he chose wasn’t to leave the town but to go towards the lake.

Liu Yun thought that Zhou Wen had set up a trap to prevent him from escaping. He thought he would have set up a trap in the direction of the town’s exit so he would escape into the forest before scaling a mountain. Naturally, he would be able to escape. After all, there probably hadn’t been enough time for Zhou Wen to set up traps all around him.

Zhou Wen reached out to grab the red pearl, but he realized that it was only a bubble. It shattered with a touch.

"Junior Brother, you’re still too young to fight me." Liu Yun held the red pearl in his hand and quickly rushed towards the forest outside the town.

Genie charged ahead, and there didn’t seem to be any explosions. Things had developed according to Liu Yun’s expectations. Zhou Wen hadn’t set up a trap in this direction.

Genie charged into the grasses and was fine, but when Liu Yun rushed into the grass, the plants suddenly exploded like bombs. Immediately, a series of tragic cries and explosions sounded.

When everything calmed down, Liu Yun was already lying on the ground covered in injuries. His handsome face had turned black, and most of his hair had been burnt.

"Try running again." Zhou Wen came to Liu Yun’s side and took a deep breath. The red pearl was sucked out of Liu Yun’s sleeve and landed in Zhou Wen’s palm.

"You and your schemes. There’s nothing impressive about using traps and harming others. If you really have the ability, remove the surrounding traps and fight me openly. Whoever wins the battle will have the treasure," said Liu Yun with a righteous tone.

Zhou Wen curled his lips in disdain. This wasn’t the first time he had been hoodwinked. Once bitten, twice shy. Wang Mingyuan’s students looked young and handsome, but, including Wang Mingyuan, none of them were decent. Zhou Wen wouldn’t fight him in an open match unless he was crazy.

"Why are you being pursued by the bureau? Is it because of Teacher?" Zhou Wen asked.

"No." Liu Yun shook his head.

This answer exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations, so he continued asking, "Then what’s the reason?"

"Because I stole something from the six families and the bureau’s headquarters." Liu Yun puffed up his chest proudly. However, because he looked as though he had been struck by lightning, he didn’t look that impressive.
