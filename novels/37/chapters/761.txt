Chapter 762: Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence

Translator: CKtalon

There were Great Wall dimensional zones in many places, not just in the Imperial Capital.

Zhou Wen didn’t have the chance to go anywhere else for the time being. He decided to head to the local one first, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol to download it as a game dungeon.

The various Great Wall dimensional zones were mostly the same. The dimensional creatures in them were creatures called Battle Souls. However, the Battle Souls differed by district.

The most common Battle Soul here was called the Undying Battle Soul. It was said that no matter what method was used, one could not kill the Battle Souls here. Therefore, as time passed, no one visited.

Zhou Wen was most interested in these strange dimensional creatures, so he wanted to download the dungeon into his phone and study them.

Just as Zhou Wen arrived in front of the Great Wall and before he could begin searching for the tiny palm symbol, he saw two people walk over. One of them was Wang Chan.

“Little Chan, where are you going?” A silver-haired youth walked beside Wang Chan as he asked.

“It’s my freedom to go wherever I want. It’s none of your business,” Wang Chan said without turning her head.

“How are you not my business? Your father wants me to take care of you. I can’t let anything happen to you. If anything happens to you, how am I to answer your father?” the silver-haired youth said with a smile.

“You don’t need to explain it to him. Xiao Si, I can tell you now that I definitely won’t go to the South District with you. I want to be like my sister and enter Sunset College to study,” Wang Chan said.

Xiao Si’s expression remained unchanged as he continued following Wang Chan. He said casually, “Little Chan, don’t joke around. Your sister has the Life Providence of the Goddess of Luck, so she can naturally go wherever she wants. However, your Life Providence is the Goddess of Misfortune. Apart from me, who has the Traversing Misfortune Buddha Body, who else can turn your misfortune into a blessing? Only with me by your side can you reverse fate and enjoy fortune. The heavens have destined me to protect you for the rest of your life.”

“I don’t need any luck, much less your protection. Don’t think I don’t know that you want to use this to threaten my family to help your family,” Wang Chan said.

“I need your family’s help, but you also need my help. Isn’t that good?” Xiao Si said.

“No, not at all. I’ve said it before. I don’t need your help, nor do I need any luck,” Wang Chan said.

“You can shrug it off, but have you considered your family? If I do not resolve your bad luck, your family will be affected by it. Don’t tell me you don’t know that? Your Wang family originally had a great opportunity to advance the Wang family further and even become an existence comparable to the Xia family. However, it was because of your birth that the Wang family failed. If not for your sister’s strong luck, the Wang family might have rapidly declined. Would you wish for that to happen again?” Xiao Si said slowly.

Wang Chan curled her lips and said, “Don’t try to scare me. With my sister around, my bad luck won’t affect my family. Furthermore, I’ll be studying at Sunset College soon, so it won’t affect my family.”

“Then what about the people from Sunset College? You will have classmates, friends, and people you like there, but the better your relationship with them and the closer you are to them, the more they will be affected by your bad luck. They will constantly be unlucky and they might even lose their lives because of you. Have you really decided to study at Sunset College without my company?” Xiao Si said calmly.

When Wang Chan heard Xiao Si’s words, she seemed to hesitate. However, she still said, “Don’t try to scare me. My Life Providence isn’t that terrifying. Even if you and my sister aren’t around, my Life Providence won’t kill anyone. It will only bring a little misfortune.”

The invisible Zhou Wen listened for a long time before he finally understood two things. Wang Lu’s luck wasn’t some form of metaphysics, but because she had the Goddess of Luck Life Providence. Zhou Wen had long guessed that.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Wang Lu’s sister, Wang Chan ended up having a completely opposite Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence. It was unbelievable that sisters born from the same parents would have such different Life Providences.

However, on second thought, the bad luck he encountered every time he met Wang Chan convinced him of her having such a Life Providence.

The smile on Xiao Si’s face vanished as he looked at Wang Chan and said, “The reason why you want to study at Sunset College isn’t because of your sister, am I right?”

“What has this got to do with you? Anyway, I definitely won’t return to the Xiao family in the South District with you,” Wang Chan said.

Xiao Si laughed. “It’s fine. You can try to find that person and see what kind of effect your Life Providence will have on him. Then, it won’t be too late to make a decision. I believe that other than me, no man in the world can withstand the bad luck you bring.”

“I’ve already tried. There’s no problem,” Wang Chan said.

“Then did you take him to a dimensional zone?” Xiao Si asked.

“Why must I go to a dimensional zone?” Wang Chan asked.

“If you really go to Sunset College to study, it’s inevitable that you will enter a dimensional zone to complete your homework missions. Isn’t that normal? Or are you afraid that he will lose his life because of you?” Xiao Si said with a smile.

“So be it. It’s no big deal.” Wang Chan turned around in a huff and left.

Xiao Si stood there without moving. After watching Wang Chan leave, he took out his phone and made a call. “An outsider approached Wang Chan and gained her trust. That person might be a student at Sunset College. Find out who that person is. I don’t wish for him to affect our plans of having Wang Chan enter our Xiao family.”

After hanging up, Xiao Si slowly left.

Zhou Wen watched Xiao Si leave and pondered for a moment before taking out his phone to call Wang Lu and ask her about Wang Chan and Xiao Si.

When Wang Lu heard that Zhou Wen had already met Wang Chan, she sighed and recounted the details regarding Wang Chan and Xiao Si.

When Wang Chan was young, her luck was a little bad, but she was still very talented and hardworking. The family had placed high hopes on her.

However, a few months ago, Wang Chan condensed her Life Providence. Unexpectedly, her Life Providence was Goddess of Misfortune. It was the opposite of Wang Lu’s Life Providence.

Her Life Providence brought quite a bit of trouble to the people around her. Only when Wang Lu was by her side would the situation improve.

However, it was impossible for Wang Lu to stay by her side forever. Therefore, the Wang family had always hoped to resolve the problem of Wang Chan’s Life Providence. They came up with many solutions, but none of them worked well. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Xiao family in the South District had somehow heard of this matter. It made Xiao Si, who had a Traversing Misfortune Buddha Body, go to the Wang family. Under the influence of his Traversing Misfortune Buddha Body, not only did Wang Chan’s Life Providence not trigger any more misfortune, but she also became lucky.

This made Wang Chan’s parents, Wang Lu, and everyone else very happy. The Xiao family didn’t make any excessive requests. They only hoped that Xiao Si could stay in the Wang family and spend more time with Wang Chan. If the two of them could get along well, they might be able to become husband and wife when Wang Chan reached the legal age of marriage.

Their Life Providences complemented each other. If they could really become husband and wife, it would be beneficial to both of them.

Although the Wang family felt that the Xiao family was deliberately trying to curry favor with them and definitely needed their help, Xiao Si’s Life Providence was too important to Wang Chan. It was worth it even if the Wang family had to pay a price.

Therefore, they allowed Xiao Si to stay in the Wang family to accompany Wang Chan. Firstly, it could resolve the danger of the Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence, and secondly, they could let them spend some time together and see if anything blossomed.

Perhaps what the Xiao family wants isn’t the Wang family’s help, but Wang Chan herself, Zhou Wen thought. However, as he didn’t have any evidence, it wasn’t his place to tell Wang Lu his thoughts.
