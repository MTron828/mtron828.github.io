Chapter 1533: Inauspicious

Bang!

The Chaos Egg exploded as there were too many solid Essence Energy Crystals that couldn’t be sent away in time.

The phone screen went black. The game ended, but Zhou Wen obtained quite a bit of information.

What left Zhou Wen most satisfied was that although the Chaos Egg exploded in-game, Tyrant Behemoth had devoured many solid Essence Energy Crystals before the Chaos Egg exploded. It was showing signs of evolving.

As he couldn’t find a way to leave the dimension for the time being, Zhou Wen decided to constantly grind the Dubhe instance dungeon. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

If he could clear the Dubhe dungeon, he might be able to use the Cube to return to Earth.

However, to use the Cube to return to Earth, there was still a problem that needed to be resolved. Four people had to drip their blood on the Cube to use it to enter the Dubhe instance dungeon.

Now that Zhou Wen was alone, he had to find three others to enter with him.

As Zhou Wen gamed, he used Truth Listener’s ability to monitor the conversations of the people in the city.

It didn’t take long for Zhou Wen to roughly understand the situation in the city.

This city built on the mountain was named “Regretless City.” Grim Demon was right. After Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden, there was nowhere to go. It was Satan who gave them a way out and settled down beside Lost Paradise.

After generations of reproduction, only today did Regretless City reach its present scale. In fact, in the beginning, there were only a few caves.

Although these humans were born in the dimension, they looked no different from Earth’s humans. Even their physical flaws were the same. No one could advance to the Mythical stage with their own strength, so the strongest human in the city was only at the Epic stage.

For them to survive here, other than the protection of the Paradise Lost, they still needed to gather supplies for living. They were humans, not gods. They had to eat, drink, and poop every day.

They didn’t dare enter the Lost Paradise. Even if they entered, there was nothing to eat other than flowers.

Therefore, the people of Regretless City could only search for food in the mountain range. However, after entering the mountain range, the dimensional forces would become stronger. Ordinary citizens couldn’t withstand it, so they couldn’t go very far.

Zhou Wen learned that their food came from plants in the forest. There was something very peculiar—in the mountain range, there was a plant whose leaves couldn’t be plucked no matter how hard one tried. However, those plants couldn’t be seen at any time. One would be very lucky to occasionally chance upon them.

While Zhou Wen was studying these things, Grim Demon wasn’t idle. He kept studying the tombstone, hoping to find some clues.

However, the words on the tombstone didn’t reveal anything. After studying it for a long time, Grim Demon couldn’t find any problems.

Finally, Grim Demon made up his mind and planned on digging up Eve’s grave to take a look.

Zhou Wen clearly didn’t like digging up other people’s ancestral graves. Grim Demon was afraid that Zhou Wen would stop him, so he didn’t inform Zhou Wen. Taking advantage of Zhou Wen’s lack of focus, he began digging.

Pushing the tombstone away, he revealed the stone coffin below. Grim Demon made a prompt decision and lifted the lid of the stone coffin.

“Ah!” Zhou Wen was eavesdropping on the conversation between the elder and his friend when he suddenly heard Grim Demon’s cry. He hurriedly turned his head and realized that Grim Demon had opened Eve’s stone coffin.

At that moment, Grim Demon’s expression was somewhat complicated. He stared intently into the stone coffin as though he had seen something bizarre.

“What’s inside?” Zhou Wen walked to Grim Demon’s side and traced his gaze. When he saw what was inside the stone coffin, he was immediately taken aback.

There were no corpses in the stone coffin—not even bones. There was only one thing inside.

“What’s this? Why is this here?” Zhou Wen realized that there was a princess-like puppet inside the stone coffin.

This puppet was huge. It was almost a 1:1 live person. It wore a princess dress and was placed in the stone coffin. It looked like it was sleeping.

No one could answer him. Grim Demon was also at a loss. “Guardians don’t need graves. You should ask yourself. If it were you, under what circumstances would you have this thing in your grave?”

“Dig up Adam’s tomb and take a look,” Zhou Wen said to Grim Demon.

Grim Demon pushed away Adam’s tombstone and indeed, he saw the stone coffin inside.

When he opened the stone coffin, there was indeed a puppet inside. However, this time, it was a puppet that looked like a boy. It wore a tailcoat and looked very gentlemanly.

“These are clearly two puppets. There’s no skeleton inside. In other words, this can’t be Adam and Eve’s tombs,” Grim Demon said.

Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to carefully scan the stone coffin. Apart from the two puppets, he didn’t discover anything.

That’s strange. If the real Adam and Eve didn’t die of old age here, where did they go? Are the people in Regretless City their descendants??Zhou Wen was puzzled.

Grim Demon wanted to take out the two puppets to take a closer look, but no matter how hard he tried, the puppets inside remained motionless.

“There’s something wrong with these two puppets. With my strength, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to take them out even if they are forged from gold, much less puppets… Ah…” As Grim Demon spoke, he suddenly let out a tragic cry and fell to the ground.

“Grim Demon, what’s wrong?” Zhou Wen saw Grim Demon collapse beside the tombstone without moving as though he was dead. Alarmed, he didn’t dare go close. He shouted Grim Demon’s name from the side.

However, after shouting a few times, Grim Demon didn’t respond at all.

“I’ve already said that digging up graves is inauspicious. It’s very easy for something to happen, but you didn’t listen to me and insisted on digging.” Zhou Wen looked at the two puppets with an odd expression. He summoned the Golden Battle Gods and got them to restore the grave. Zhou Wen didn’t dare approach them.

After closing the coffin lid and pushing the grave back to its original spot, the Golden Battle Gods weren’t attacked, but Grim Demon remained motionless. It was useless no matter how Zhou Wen shouted.

There was no reaction even if he was electrocuted or smashed with ice. However, Grim Demon’s vitality remained. It didn’t look like he was dead.

After a while, Grim Demon got up in a daze.

“What happened?” Grim Demon asked Zhou Wen after waking up.

“I should be the one asking you that.” Zhou Wen recounted his sudden collapse.

Grim Demon’s expression turned nasty after hearing that. “How did this happen? I don’t have any memories of it happening..”
