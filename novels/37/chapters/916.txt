Chapter 917: Scarecrow

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen stopped and stood by the lake. He suddenly took out the purple bronze ball.

When Yin Talisman King saw the purple bronze ball in Zhou Wen’s hand, he slowed down and didn’t immediately rush over.

“This is what you want, right?” Zhou Wen asked as he slowly walked over.

In fact, Zhou Wen already knew the answer without needing Yin Talisman King to answer. This was because Yin Talisman King’s eyes were glowing when he saw the purple bronze ball.

“Give it to me and I shall give you a quick death. Otherwise, I’ll let you suffer so much that you’ll wish you were dead,” said King Yin Talisman.

“What’s this? Is it worth you risking your life to chase after me? You didn’t chase after the person who took away the Sun True Flame Furnace, but you chased after me for this. I believe this thing must be extraordinary, right?” Zhou Wen held the copper ball and slowly retreated. He had already retreated to the edge of the lake and was about to step into it.

Yin Talisman King was also sizing up his surroundings, especially the lake behind Zhou Wen. He didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen. Although it looked like Zhou Wen was unable to escape, Yin Talisman King was still very careful when Zhou Wen chose to stop here. He didn’t dare charge forward, hoping to figure out if there were any problems here.

Just like Zhou Wen, Yin Talisman King didn’t discover any problems. He believed that this was only an ordinary lake and that there was nothing special nearby. Therefore, he focused his attention on Zhou Wen.

In fact, this was where Zhou Wen had discovered the scarecrow. It was erected in the lake.

“You don’t need to know what this is. Where’s the other one?” Yin Talisman King asked.

“There’s two of these?” Zhou Wen saw that Yin Talisman King had already approached him. He suddenly flew up and flew across the lake.

Yin Talisman King tore through the air at a speed faster than Zhou Wen’s. He was just moments from grabbing Zhou Wen from behind.

Zhou Wen suddenly threw the purple bronze ball into the lake, and it landed near the scarecrow.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that Yin Talisman King would chase after the purple bronze ball first. If he approached the scarecrow, the scarecrow wouldn’t be indifferent.

However, to his surprise, Yin Talisman King was more ruthless than Zhou Wen had imagined. He seemed to think that it didn’t matter even if the purple bronze ball fell into the lake. He could quickly return to retrieve it later.

Therefore, Yin Talisman King didn’t chase after the purple bronze ball. Instead, he continued attacking Zhou Wen, hoping to kill him first. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed, but he had also thought of this possibility. His body suddenly sank as he burrowed into the lake, allowing Yin Talisman King to rush past him.

The moment Zhou Wen entered the water, he switched to the Demon God Catalog and dived deep into the lake.

Without any hesitation, Yin Talisman King chased after Zhou Wen and rushed into the lake. He wanted to kill Zhou Wen quickly and not give him any chance of survival.

However, just as Yin Talisman King was about to rush into the water, he suddenly saw a strange scene.

Yin Talisman King had been paying attention to the purple bronze ball with a sliver of his mind. He needed to know where the purple bronze ball had landed so that he could search for it later.

However, before the purple bronze ball landed in the water, it suddenly changed its trajectory. Yin Talisman King saw the purple bronze ball land in the hands of the scarecrow on the lake.

The scarecrow that originally looked like an ordinary object was now holding the purple bronze ball in its moldy straw palm. It tilted its head and looked down at the purple bronze ball.

Yin Talisman King was alarmed. If the purple bronze ball was taken away, it would be useless even if he killed Zhou Wen. He immediately made a prompt decision and spun like a strange eagle, striking at the scarecrow with his palm.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that he would be in a bitter battle, but to his surprise, Yin Talisman King changed directions and charged at the scarecrow.

Zhou Wen lay in the lake and looked up at the scarecrow.

The scarecrow’s face was the same as the rest of its body. It was already moldy, but on its face—under the cover of the hat—was a pair of red eyes and a crescent-shaped mouth that emitted an evil red glow.

At that moment, the scarecrow was completely different from when Zhou Wen had observed it. It emitted a terrifying evil aura that resembled black demonic smoke. It rose from its body as though it was wrapping its body like its clothes and a hat.

One of Yin Talisman King’s hands had already slammed in front of the scarecrow. Yin Talisman King was clearly very careful. His entire body had turned into a crystalline state as he entered his Terror form. His hand was almost transparent.

Just as Yin Talisman King’s hand was about to strike the scarecrow’s head, the scarecrow finally looked up. The eyes and mouth that were covered by the brim of the hat were revealed to Yin Talisman King.

“Ah!” Yin Talisman King suddenly screamed as he retreated.

Zhou Wen saw that Yin Talisman King’s eyes were like the eyes of a scarecrow, turning blood-red. Furthermore, the redness was still spreading around his eyes like protruding blood vessels. It made Yin Talisman King’s eyes look extremely strange. Furthermore, his eyes protruded and shimmered with red light. It gave off the feeling that his eyes were about to burst.

Zhou Wen’s heart trembled as he thought to himself that it was a close call. Thankfully, he thought that the scarecrow might be a dimensional creature like a demon. As for the Demon God Catalog, it had a bewitchment effect on such dimensional creatures. It made them mistake Zhou Wen for one of their kind, so he switched over.

From the looks of it, he had escaped a calamity. If not for the protection of the Mirror Eyes Life Soul in the Demon God Catalog, he would probably have suffered the same outcome as Yin Talisman King when he saw the scarecrow’s eyes.

Yin Talisman King was impressive as well. He gathered his strength with both hands and pressed it on his eyes that were about to burst. Two beams of Yin energy were injected into his eyes, forcefully suppressing the red light in them.

However, the red light didn’t disappear. It was suppressed and remained in his eyes, preventing him from opening his eyes to see.

“Who are you?” Yin Talisman King used his ears as his eyes and listened in the direction of the scarecrow with a heavy expression.

The only one who could injure a Terror-grade was a Terror-grade creature. The scarecrow had nearly crippled his eyes. Clearly, it was also a Terror-grade creature.

However, the scarecrow had no intention of answering. Its body dissipated like black smoke as it silently condensed in front of Yin Talisman King. The finger that carried black smoke and demonic aura stabbed at Yin Talisman King’s blind eyes.

Just as Zhou Wen thought that Yin Talisman King was about to be crippled, he suddenly saw a jade light on Yin Talisman King’s body glow. His palm was like a jade claw as it penetrated the scarecrow’s chest. He had actually discovered the scarecrow’s location.

However, the scarecrow didn’t seem to feel any pain. Its hand continued reaching out, wanting to grab Yin Talisman King’s neck.

Yin Talisman King raised his other hand and grabbed the scarecrow’s palm.
