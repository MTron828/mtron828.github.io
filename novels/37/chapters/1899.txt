Chapter 1900 The Last Supper

“Are you really leaving? You still have a choice,” Zhou Lingfeng said as he drank his tea.

“I wish to head out to take a look,” Zhou Wen said.

“So what if you see it? What if you can’t withstand it?” Zhou Lingfeng put down the teacup and asked Zhou Wen.

“I might regret seeing it, but I’ll always regret it if I don’t,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“That’s true. Instead of living the rest of life in regret, you might as well die a quick death.” Zhou Lingfeng smiled and said, “From the looks of it, I have to work harder. If my main account is crippled, I can only power level my smurf.”

Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless. He could never keep up with Zhou Lingfeng’s train of thought.

“Tell Ouyang Lan yourself. If there’s a need, you can also tell her the truth,” Zhou Lingfeng suddenly said seriously.

Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before shaking his head. “There’s no need. It’s good to let An Jing be her child. If I fail to return, I’ll just be making her sad for no reason.”

“Then have a meal with her.” Zhou Lingfeng sighed.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded.

“You should meet Tianzuo too,” Zhou Lingfeng said again.

Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “No.”

“No matter what, you are brothers. What

grudge can’t be resolved?” Zhou Lingfeng said with a bitter smile.

“There’s no grudge between us. I’m just not used to it. Same for him. It’s perfectly fine the way it is,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Seriously? Forget it. I’ll leave it up to you.” Zhou Lingfeng shook his head helplessly.

That night, Zhou Wen ate with Ouyang Lan and Zhou Lingfeng. Ya’er and An Jing were there.

Ya’er stayed by Zhou Wen’s side the entire time. An Jing lowered her head and ate without saying a word.

“Come, come, come, our hero who saved the world. Here’s a toast.” Ouyang Lan was very happy as she kept pouring wine and toasting Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen didn’t reject her. After a few glasses, Ouyang Lan became a little tipsy; she danced with Zhou Wen.

She was even more straightforward than a

man, but she wasn’t good with alcohol.

“Zhou Wen, did I treat you well?” Ouyang Lan’s face flushed red as she wrapped her arms

around his shoulder.

“Excellent,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.

“You are Lingfeng’s son, which means you are my son. It’s been so long, but you haven’t called me mom. Have I not done enough?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he was momentarily at a loss for an answer.

“Or am I not good enough for you to call me mom?” Ouyang Lan said angrily.

“Of course you are good enough. You are my

mother,” Zhou Wen said.

“No, you have to seriously call me Mom,”

Ouyang Lan said.

“Mom,” Zhou Wen called out with mixed

feelings.

“My good son, I can now tell everyone that my

son is the hero who saved the world.” Ouyang Lan staggered to her feet and raised her glass. “Come, a toast to my good son.”

With that said, Ouyang Lan downed the wine in

her cup.

“That’s enough. Stop drinking,” Zhou Lingfeng

persuaded.

“Why not? I’m happy today. Let’s drink till we drop! Am I right, son?” Ouyang Lan grabbed the bottle again and poured herself some wine.

Ouyang Lan eventually collapsed from drinking. Zhou Lingfeng carried her back to her room before Zhou Wen got up to leave.

“Are you leaving?” An Jing suddenly said from behind Zhou Wen.

“Yeah.” Zhou Wen nodded.

“Will you return?” An Jing’s words made Zhou

Wen realize that he had misunderstood her

first question.

“How did you know I was leaving?” Zhou Wen turned around and asked An Jing.

“The Thearch said that she wants to leave. A

person like you would have the same thoughts as her, right?” An Jing said.

“Yes, I’m leaving. I don’t know if I can return.”

Zhou Wen sighed. Even An Jing could tell, so how could Ouyang Lan not? She didn’t say a word despite drinking so much. It must have been a huge blow to her.

“Goodbye,” An Jing said as she turned to leave.

It surprised Zhou Wen. An Jing was calm like her name, nothing like before.

Zhou Wen went out and walked the streets of

Guide Ancient City. Although it was almost midnight, the streets were still brightly lit. After walking for a short distance, he saw a person sitting on the stone steps by the street. It was Jing Daoxian.

“What are you doing here?” Zhou Wen had

come here because he knew that Jing Daoxian

was here. Otherwise, why would he need to

walk? He could go anywhere with a mere thought.

“Can I take a look at the Essence Energy Art

Wang Mingyuan left behind?” Jing Daoxian

asked.

“No,” Zhou Wen replied.

“Then there’s nothing I can do. Kill me,” Jing

Daoxian said as he stood up and walked in

front of Zhou Wen.

“Why? Are you sick of living?” Zhou Wen looked at Jing Daoxian’s expression; he didn’t seem to be joking. He really looked like he wanted to die.

“You’ve become a god, and my path has been

severed. I can’t take that step, so death is my only solution.” Jing Daoxian pointed at Zhou Wen and said, “I know you have something

that can turn a dead person into a Companion Beast. Kill me and turn me into your Companion Beast. Take me with you.” “Do you know what that means? Not everyone

can become a Companion Beast after death.

Even if you succeed, you will lose all your past memories. It can be said that it’s no longer you. Are you sure you want that?” Zhou Wen Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

said to Jing Daoxian. The reason the Devil King could find herself

again was that she had left her Devil Spirit

behind in advance. It was equivalent to leaving behind an avatar with her past memories. By fusing with the avatar, she could be considered to have found a portion of herself. Wang Mingyuan and Jing Daoxian didn’t have

such things. If they became Companion Beasts, there was no coming back.

“It doesn’t matter. If I can’t improve further, what’s the difference between living and dying? There’s nothing unknown in life. To me, I’m already a dead person…” As Jing Daoxian spoke, blood flowed from the corner of

his mouth.

Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He realized that Jing Daoxian’s vitality had been severed. He was killing himself. From the looks of it, he was really bent on death.

“Then let’s see your luck.” Zhou Wen pulled out the Human Sovereign Stone Saber and stabbed it into Jing Daoxian’s heart.

“Thank you.” Jing Daoxian slowly closed his

eyes. People came and went on the streets, but no one could see Jing Daoxian and Zhou Wen. It was as though they didn’t exist. Seeing Jing Daoxian completely lose his life, Zhou Wen was wondering if the Dead Man Tree would react to him when his phone vibrated. The Dead Man Tree indeed reacted. Zhou Wen watched as Jing Daoxian’s corpse turned into points of light and was sucked into the Dead

Man Tree. Another fruit grew on the tree. You won the bet again, but was it really worth

it? Zhou Wen sighed and put away his phone.

He recalled the two Companion Eggs Wang Mingyuan had left behind. After taking them out, he hatched them.

Indeed, it was the same as the information he had previously read. One was the Yin Reincarnation Flower, while the other was the Yang Reincarnation Flower.

The two plants had two leaves—one blue and one red—with flowers growing on the top. The roots below danced around Zhou Wen like two pixie-like Companion Beasts.

Zhou Wen focused his gaze and his body trembled. There was a transparent bead in each of the two flower pistils.

There was an extremely tiny baby curled up in each bead as though they were in their mother’s womb.

Upon closer inspection, the two babies looked

familiar.

As expected of Teacher. Zhou Wen pondered

for a moment before taking a step forward and disappearing. When he appeared again, he was already in front of Liu Yun.

“Eldest Senior Brother, I have something I need your help with.” Zhou Wen summoned the two Reincarnation Flowers and made them float in front of Liu Yun.

“These are…” Liu Yun looked at the babies in

the beads and immediately looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.

“Help me raise them.” With a thought, the two Reincarnation Flowers were transferred to Liu

Yun.

Even if he managed to leave, his survival remained a mystery. He wouldn’t take them with him to their deaths. “Are you leaving?” Liu Yun asked Zhou Wen.

“It’s as though everyone in the world knows that I’m leaving.” Zhou Wen smiled bitterly. “Haha, who asked you to be Human Sovereign? If you don’t leave, many people—no, it should

be said that many creatures will feel terrible,”

Liu Yun said with a laugh. “Why?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

“Who likes to call others daddy forever? You

“Haha,

aren’t their father.” Liu Yun chuckled. now that you mention it, I should head over and hear them call me daddy before I leave.” Zhou Wen also laughed.
