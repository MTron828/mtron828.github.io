Chapter 1200: Xiao

“Is that so?” Xiao pointed his bow and arrow at An Tianzuo. The tip of the arrow gradually lit up like a light bulb. As time passed, the light on the tip of the arrow became brighter and more intense, like a sun.

“Sun True Body, Sun Strafe Art?” An Tianzuo was slightly taken aback.

The Sun True Body was nothing; one had a chance of obtaining it as long as one went to the Sun God Holy Temple. However, according to what he knew, An Jing was the only one who knew the Sun Strafe Art. He originally imagined that Zhou Wen had also practiced it, but he later realized that Zhou Wen wasn’t practicing the Sun Strafe Art.

The crux of the matter was that the Sun Strafe Art was essentially exclusive to the An family. It didn’t seem like it should be passed on to outsiders.

At the instant An Tianzuo fell into a daze, the arrow shot out. It was like the descent of a heavenly sun as it charged at An Tianzuo with an extremely blazing power.

An Tianzuo only had one arm left as he held the broadsword. His eyes were firm and determined as he raised the sword and slashed at the sun.

Boom!

The sun-like dazzling light was sliced apart by the broadsword. The blade collided with the tip of the arrow, and the terrifying light exploded like a hydrogen bomb.

The surrounding Asuras were instantly annihilated as An Sheng was sent flying by the shockwave.

Thankfully, although An Sheng hadn’t reached the Terror grade, his skills and Companion Beasts were very good. He managed to leverage himself in the air as he traveled through it, all the while reducing the impact on his body.

After the light faded, An Tianzuo stood in his spot with the broadsword in hand. A large area around him had turned into a deep pit as the wrecked Asuras squirmed and recovered.

“Where did you learn the Sun Strafe Art?” An Tianzuo asked as he stared at Xiao.

“Aren’t you good at guessing? Guess,” Xiao teased.

An Tianzuo clearly wasn’t a person who liked to waste his breath. He slashed his broadsword at Xiao.

Xiao stood motionlessly on the stone pillar until the broadsword was in front of him. Just as it was about to touch his hair, his body seemed to warp. Not only did he not retreat, but he charged at An Tianzuo.

As space distorted, the broadsword seemed to automatically avoid him as it brushed past him. Instead, Xiao used the hunting bow’s bowstring as a blade to slash at An Tianzuo’s neck.

The broadsword was clumsy to begin with, and the two of them were too close. An Tianzuo had lost an arm, so he had no time to block. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Everyone believed that An Tianzuo would dodge, but he didn’t. At the instant the bowstring approached, he opened his mouth and bit the bowstring with his teeth, snapping it instantly.

Almost at the same time he snapped the bowstring, An Tianzuo slashed horizontally at Xiao.

Xiao did a twist and drew an arc. It didn’t seem fast, but he dodged the sword’s attack. The sword’s trajectory seemed to be distorted. It should have been able to hit Xiao’s blade, but it slashed past him.

“The Dugu family’s movement technique,” An Tianzuo said as he slashed at Xiao again without stopping.

“Didn’t you say that I came from the Trajectory Holy Temple? What’s so strange about me knowing the Dugu family’s movement techniques?” Xiao’s figure moved erratically as he dodged An Tianzuo’s repeated attacks.

An Tianzuo knew that the truth wasn’t as Xiao said.

The Dugu family’s movement technique was indeed from the Trajectory Holy Temple, but what the Trajectory Holy Temple had given them was only the tricks to the Trajectory movement technique. The Dugu family’s present achievements were due to their continuous research on the Trajectory movement technique.

The Dugu family’s Trajectory movement technique had already been imprinted with their own unique trademarks.

Even if he had learned the Trajectory movement technique from the Trajectory Holy Temple, it would be impossible for it to be identical to the Dugu family’s.

However, Xiao’s Trajectory movement technique clearly had the inklings of the Dugu family’s. It wasn’t purely the Trajectory movement technique.

“Your sword art isn’t as arrogant as you.” Xiao dodged a few strikes before finally counterattacking.

As he dodged the broadsword, frost appeared on the bow that had its string snapped. It swept at An Tianzuo like an ice popsicle.

“The frost battle aura of the Ultimate Family Clan?” An Tianzuo’s broadsword clashed with the bow. A cold aura immediately spread from the broadsword, forming frost on half the blade.

An Tianzuo blasted the bow away, but Xiao used the bow like a staff in an extremely strange manner. An Tianzuo’s broadsword had no choice but to constantly clash with the bow.

Every time they clashed, the frost battle aura on the bow was transmitted into the broadsword, and traveled through the broadsword up to An Tianzuo’s hand. His sword-wielding arm was already covered in frost that was spreading towards his body.

“Now, are you still sure that I’m from the Trajectory Holy Temple?” Xiao said as he attacked.

“Yes,” An Tianzuo answered very calmly, but his tone was very certain.

He brandished his sword and sent Xiao retreating. The frost on his body instantly shattered and splattered everywhere. Ice shards fell to the ground, but An Tianzuo’s body wasn’t affected by the freezing.

“You are actually immune to the freezing forces of the frost battle aura. You shouldn’t have revealed it so early. If you had waited a little longer and suddenly attacked when I was close, you would have been able to cause me some trouble,” Xiao said as he retreated.

“There’s no need.” An Tianzuo struck again and again.

His sword art was domineering and orthodox. Ordinary people would have some evil aura when their sword art was so domineering.

It was just like how Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal was domineering. But, despite being domineering, An Tianzuo’s sword art gave off an upright feeling. It was truly odd.

Xiao’s movement technique was ever-changing, and his moves were varied. It appeared as though he could freely use the famous techniques of the six families as if he had practiced them since he was young.

Even An Tianzuo was alarmed.

He knew that this was definitely not an mime ability, but something he had truly cultivated with great effort. He could sense that something was different.

Who is this fellow? An Tianzuo was momentarily unable to gain the upper hand.

An Sheng hadn’t reached the Terror grade yet. Although his talent was special and he could vaguely see some shadows—blurry ones. It wasn’t much different from not being able to see them. He only roughly knew where they were fighting.

Gritting his teeth, An Sheng avoided the area where they were fighting and rushed towards the altar, hoping to save Ouyang Lan and company.

Bam!

An Sheng wanted to rush up the altar. There was clearly no obstruction, but when he rushed over, it was as though he had slammed into a wall. He bounced back, his face swollen and his nose bleeding.

An Sheng summoned his Companion Beast and transformed it into a dagger that stabbed into the air. There was only a clang, and the hand holding the dagger went numb—the dagger failed to break through.

He tried various methods to break through the invisible barrier, but none of them worked.

Meanwhile, An Tianzuo and Xiao were fighting evenly. Neither of them had the absolute upper hand.

An Tianzuo’s figure suddenly froze as he pointed the broadsword at Xiao. Instantly, the entire world seemed to vanish, leaving only the broadsword in the world.

Xiao was wearing a mask. It was unknown what expression he had, but his body stopped moving as he stared intently at An Tianzuo. The purple armor on his body emitted a golden glow as the Light of Terror above his head condensed into a crown.

“Holy Emperor Body?” An Tianzuo recognized what it was and couldn’t help but frown slightly.

The Holy Emperor Body originated from the Divine Emperor Holy Temple. It had always been the heritage of the Cape family.

“Your Terror powers are similar to nomological powers. They can destroy all evil, but this power of imperial authority should be your nemesis, right?” Xiao looked down at An Tianzuo like a supreme god emperor.
