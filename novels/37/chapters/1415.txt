Chapter 1416: Doing Something For All Life

Six stars. I wonder if that Calamity-grade gunman is dead. I didn’t hear any gunshots. He probably isn’t dead. If I kill the Calamity-grade gunman, I should have a chance of exceeding six stars, right??Zhou Wen thought to himself.

If other humans had obtained first place, Zhou Wen wouldn’t put in so much effort. However, it was intolerable for someone from the Holy Land to obtain first place.

Now, Zhou Wen was more vexed about how to find the Calamity-grade gunman.

Killing him was unlikely to be difficult. The difficult part was finding him. Zhou Wen had tried many times and tried all sorts of methods, but he failed to find him.

That Calamity-grade gunman might very well have an invisibility ability like the Invisibility Cloak. Furthermore, it’s high-level invisibility. Otherwise, it shouldn’t be able to escape Truth Listener’s notice, or perhaps it’s some concealment ability.?After some thought, Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a way to find the Calamity-grade gunman.

…

In the Federation, people were discussing Xiao’s domineering ascension to the apex. After all, he was the only six-star. It rekindled their curiosity and anticipation for the Holy Land.

“These people are really easily incited. Yesterday, they swore that they would learn from you and raise Companion Beasts, but today, they are all thinking of joining the Holy Land,” Li Xuan came to Zhou Wen and sat on his couch as he gloated.

An Sheng said, “Isn’t that what humans are? It’s very easy to abandon things like faith, bottom lines, and morals that don’t benefit them.”

“Brother Sheng, don’t tar everyone with the same brush. I’m a person with morals and a bottom line. I’m different from ordinary people,” Li Xuan immediately retorted.

“That’s only because you haven’t received enough benefits. It’s hard to say how you would choose if I gave you enough benefits,” An Sheng said.

“Brother Sheng, you are doubting my character. Nothing can shake my bottom line,” Li Xuan said righteously.

“Is that so? Then if your brother is severely injured and will definitely die, but you realize that killing someone who has some grudge with you despite not deserving death will allow your brother to completely recover. Will you kill him?” An Sheng asked.

“About that…” Li Xuan was somewhat hesitant.

“Another example is the instance where everyone in your Li family has fallen into the hands of a serial killer. If you don’t help him steal something, he will kill your entire family. Will you carry out the theft?” An Sheng asked again.

“I say, Brother Sheng, can you not curse me? Can’t you think of something better?” Li Xuan said gloomily.

“I can come up with positive ones, but your enemy won’t. The so-called beliefs and morals of a human are relative. Therefore, if you want to have a moral bottom line, you have to do and think more than others. Don’t give yourself the chance to cross your moral bottom line. What’s that saying again? If you want to be a clean official, you have to be more sinister than a corrupted official.” An Sheng paused before continuing, “Of course, there are also people who can maintain their beliefs and bottom lines under any circumstances, but I think there are very few saints. It’s best if we ordinary people don’t let ourselves fall into such a situation, nor do we test the bottom lines of others.”

“That makes sense. Brother Sheng, let me toast you.” Li Xuan seemed to agree with An Sheng as he poured him a cup and clinked it with his.

“What are the two of you up to?” Zhou Wen looked at the two of them and asked with a frown.

The two of them had been sitting at his place for a long time and were mentioning things that seemed to imply something. He didn’t know what they were up to.

“Nothing. Isn’t this just a casual chat?” Li Xuan smiled and continued asking, “Old Zhou, do you have plans on getting first place again?”

“The reason that the two of you have been talking all this while is so that I’ll challenge the level again?” Zhou Wen seemed to understand.

An Sheng sighed and said, “Humans are selfish creatures. Previously, there was Immortal from the League of Guardians, and now there’s Xiao from the Holy Land. If this continues, I’m afraid everyone will want to join the Holy Land to contract Guardians in the future. Who will take the difficult path? At this moment, someone has to step forward and attract them back.”

“I don’t have what it takes. Find someone else,” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.

He really had no solution. If he couldn’t find the Calamity gunner, he would at most obtain five stars like the last time. It was impossible for him to obtain six stars.

“You might not be able to do so, but Human Sovereign definitely can,” An Sheng said with a wink. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Even Human Sovereign won’t be able to do it this time.” Immortal Culling Sword was indeed very strong, but without finding the Calamity-grade gunman, it was useless no matter how strong it was.

Zhou Wen suddenly sized up Li Xuan and said, “That’s strange. I can understand why Ah Sheng wants me to get first. Why do you want me to get first?”

“Hey, what kind of person do you think I am? I’m also a nice guy. I also want to do something for all life in the world,” Li Xuan said stubbornly.

“That’s not right. This isn’t like you. There’s definitely something going on here.” Zhou Wen stared at Li Xuan, giving him the creeps.

“Stop staring at me like that. It’s terrifying. I really want to do something good for all life in the world. However, I also want to earn some pocket money.” Unable to withstand Zhou Wen’s questioning gaze, Li Xuan revealed his intentions.

“Pocket money? What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked.

Realizing that he couldn’t hide it, Li Xuan could only say, “Actually, it’s nothing. Someone made a bet on who will take first on the Cube. I placed a heavy bet on you. No, on Human Sovereign.”

“You want me to risk my life just for that bit of money? Are you even human?” Zhou Wen cursed.

“This isn’t just a bit of money. After Xiao’s recent appearance, the odds for others have increased significantly, especially those who haven’t been on the rankings. Human Sovereign is one of them. If Human Sovereign takes first place in the end, I’ll be able to obtain a large sum of resources. Take note, it’s resources, not money. They are paying with resources, paying whatever is bet,” Li Xuan said.

“You dare buy into such a bet? Aren’t you afraid that they will abscond with the money?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“They won’t run. The Family Clan of Gods is the bookmaker.” Li Xuan was very certain.

“You bought in too?” Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng.

“I bought a little,” An Sheng said shyly.

“How much is a little?” Zhou Wen pressed.

“500 tonnes of Essence Crystals,” An Sheng answered.

“You call that a little?” Zhou Wen was rendered speechless. 500 tonnes of Essence Crystals was probably the total amount of Essence Crystals Luoyang had on hand.

Although the Butterfly Valley where Master Zhuang’s Tomb was located had Essence Crystal ores, there was no way to mine them. People could only enter at specific times. Therefore, they had yet to obtain any Essence Crystals from there.

“I really have no means of getting first place now. Good luck to both of you,” Zhou Wen said.

“It doesn’t matter if you don’t have the means. We do,” Li Xuan suddenly said.
