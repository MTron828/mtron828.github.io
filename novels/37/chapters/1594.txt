Chapter 1595: Moon Essence Basin

Translator: CKtalon

“What Moon Essence Basin? I’ve never seen it before,” Zhou Wen immediately denied.

What a joke. It hadn’t been easy for him to obtain it. He definitely couldn’t give it to Jing Daoxian.

Jing Daoxian only smiled. “Don’t worry. I don’t want the Moon Essence Basin. I just want to remind you that you have the Skyimmortal Swan and the Moon Essence Basin. Toad Immortal won’t let you off so easily.”

“shall repeat myself. I’ve never seen the Moon Essence Basin. Furthermore, I’ve already killed it. So what if it doesn’t let me off? Can it crawl back from the netherworld and bite me?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe Jing Daoxian.

“Have you forgotten the story I just told you? You only killed Toad Immortal’s mortal body. It can be considered as helping Toad Immortal escape. When it completely recovers its true body, it will quickly come for you,” Jing Daoxian said.

“Don’t tell me you want me to give you the Skyimmortal Swan and the Moon Essence Basin so that you can lure that Toad Immortal away?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe Jing Daoxian at all.

“If you trust me, I can help you,” Jing Daoxian said seriously.

“Stop joking. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.” Zhou Wen turned around and left.

Jing Daoxian said, “You should know very well that you can kill the toad because it’s suppressed to begin with. That body is also a restriction on Toad Immortal. When it recovers and makes a comeback, it won’t be that easy to deal with. It’s a top-notch Heaven-level creature.”

Zhou Wen tumed around and asked, “Why don’t you tell me what you want the Moon Essence Basin for?”

Jing Daoxian had plotted to give the Skyimmortal Swan Companion Egg to Zhou Wen so that he could kill the toad. It was naturally a plot for him to obtain the Moon Essence Basin.

“Idon’t plan on hiding it from you. I need the essence of the sun and moon to help the Yin Yang Mirror grow. The Moon Essence Basin is a treasure for Moon Essence. It’s very helpful for the Yin Yang Mirror’s growth.” Jing Daoxian paused before saying, “However, I’m not lying to you. As long as you have

the Skyimmortal Swan and the Moon Essence Basin on you, Toad Immortal will be able to find you once it completely recovers its true body.”

“Then let’s put it this way. What do I gain by giving you the Skyimmortal Swan and the Moon Essence Basin?” Zhou Wen asked bluntly. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Isn’t not dying the greatest benefit?” Jing Daoxian narrowed his eyes and said, “I know you can’t accept it, but how can there be so many things in this world that go according to one’s wishes? A young man can grow by suffering some losses. This is tuition money that you need to pay. As long as you don’t

die, you will gain experience from suffering losses. You can also get others to pay you tuition fees in the future.”

“Sorry, I quit school a long time ago.” Zhou Wen turned around and left with the baby bear.

“Don’t think that you can fight Toad Immortal just because you killed that toad. The toad was only mortal, completely different from Toad Immortal,” Jing Daoxian said.

“That’s still better than you not being able to deal with a mere toad,” Zhou Wen said without looking back.

“Tll be heading to Yinxu soon. You can find me there when you need me,” Jing Daoxian added.

“Please go and don’t worry about me.” Zhou Wen waved his hand and quickly left.

Jing Daoxian wasn’t in a rush. He took a sip of alcohol and muttered to himself, “When you meet the real Toad Immortal, you will naturally come to me.”

Although Zhou Wen rejected Jing Daoxian, that didn’t mean that he didn’t take Toad Immortal to heart.

Jing Daoxian was right. If the toad hadn’t been suppressed, it wouldn’t have been that easy for him to kill it.

Furthermore, the Teacher Domain played a huge role in his killing of the toad; otherwise, it would have been a bitter battle.

Regardless of whether Toad Immortal was as powerful as Jing Daoxian described, he had to be wary of him.

The pressing matter at hand is to study the Teacher Domain. This domain is extremely useful. Even if I don’t fight Toad Immortal, it will be of great use in the future. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and didn’t continue exploring the other dimensional zones. Instead, he teleported to the Moon.

He wanted to ask Lady Supreme Yin what the Moon Essence Basin was.

“Where’s the Misfortune dimensional creature I got you to find?” Lady Supreme Yin asked when she saw Zhou Wen.

“About that... I haven’t found it yet...” Zhou Wen had forgotten about it.

It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t wish to do something, but Lady Supreme Yin’s requirements were too high. The attribute of misfortune was difficult to find to begin with, and it required something with low levels but with great potential. Zhou Wen had never seen such a dimensional creature before.

“Why are you here when you haven’t found it?” Lady Supreme Yin said angrily.

“Lady Goddess, I have something here. I want you to help me take a look at it.” Zhou Wen took out the Moon Essence Basin.

The door to Lady Supreme Yin’s temple suddenly opened. Moonlight shone out and landed on the Moon Essence Basin, sweeping it into the temple before closing the door.

“Lady Goddess, what are you doing?” Zhou Wen was alarmed as he thought to himself, Don’t tell me Lady Supreme Yin wants to steal my Moon Essence Basin?

“Where did you get this?” Lady Supreme Yin didn’t answer Zhou Wen’s question and instead asked.

Zhou Wen recounted what had happened. After Lady Supreme Yin heard that, she sighed and said, “So that’s how it is. You’ve gotten into big trouble. Jing Daoxian is right. As long as the Moon Essence Basin and the Skyimmortal Swan are with you, Toad Immortal won’t let you off. No matter where you

are, it will be able to find you.”

“Legend has it that this Moon Essence Basin is a gift from the Moon Goddess to the Queen Mother. Is it true? Do the Heavenly Courts and the Queen Mother really exist?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

Lady Supreme Yin fell silent for a while. Only when Zhou Wen began suspecting that she had fallen asleep did she say, “There’s no Heavenly Courts in the world, but Queen Mother does exist. However, she’s not in the Heavenly Courts, but a dimensional zone on Earth.”

“In that case, is the Moon Essence Basin really a gift from you?” Zhou Wen said in surprise.

“No.” Lady Supreme Yin explained, “The Moon Essence Basin is actually a Zone Core. It was forcefully destroyed by Queen Mother and extracted from a dimensional zone. I don’t know what it was originally used for, but later on, it was used to suppress Toad Immortal. That’s why the Moon Essence Basin

was injected into its body.”

“Which dimensional zone does Queen Mother live in?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he hurriedly asked.

“Tt has long been destroyed in the Mythical era war. Even if you can find it, all that’s left is ruins,” said Lady Supreme Yin with a sigh.

Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed. “Who has the ability to destroy such a dimensional zone?”

“I don’t know. I’m on the Moon after all. I’m only partially aware of what’s happening on Earth.” As Lady Supreme Yin spoke, she threw out the Moon Essence Basin.

“Jing Daoxian is right. A Heaven-level Toad Immortal is a top-notch Calamity-grade creature. Ordinary Calamity-grade creatures can’t compare with it. Although the Moon Essence Basin is good, it’s not worth risking your life for it,” said Lady Supreme Yin..
