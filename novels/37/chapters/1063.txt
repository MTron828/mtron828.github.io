Chapter 1064: You Can Have It All

Translator: CKtalon

“If you don’t want to choose, you can request both.” The voice that came from the Moon Goddess Temple left Zhou Wen’s mouth agape in surprise. He failed to immediately recover from his shock.

He didn’t know that he could make such a choice. In the past, when he had chosen Truth Listener and Banana Fairy, he could only choose once. There would be no reaction if he tried again.

But this entity was different. She actually said that he could choose them both.

Conspiracy... It must be a conspiracy... This Lady Supreme Yin wants to scam me after scamming them? Zhou Wen didn’t believe that such a good thing would happen and felt that there was definitely a trap.

Shen Yuchi also thought so, so he kept looking at Zhou Wen. If Zhou Wen were to choose to take both, he might end up worse than Wang Qiuyuan.

“Your Excellency, I’m not doubting you. It’s just that I’ve heard from others that a person can only choose a Companion Beast once, right?” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s right. A person can only choose once.” The Moon Goddess’s voice floated out again.

Zhou Wen never expected the Moon Goddess to admit it so quickly. After some thought, he carefully asked again, “One person can only choose one Companion Beast?”

“Yes,” the Moon Goddess answered with certainty.

“Then why are you allowing me to take both?” Zhou Wen felt that the Moon Goddess’s trap was a little too obvious. No matter how stupid he was, he wouldn’t fall for it that easily, right?

Although Shen Yuchi knew that Zhou Wen was very careful, he couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed when he saw that Zhou Wen wasn’t tempted.

“Choosing and requesting are two separate matters.” The Moon Goddess’s voice sounded, leaving Zhou Wen and Shen Yuchi stunned as their emotions underwent a subtle change.

“You mean...” Zhou Wen looked at the pearl and jade slip in disbelief.

“Now that these two Companion Beasts have been chosen, there are naturally no rules. Anyone can take them away and hatch them.” The Moon Goddess’s words left Shen Yuchi somewhat dumbfounded.

It must be a conspiracy... There must be a conspiracy... Shen Yuchi reacted and stared at the pearl and jade slip in the temple as he thought repeatedly.

“That works too... However, Your Excellency, your divine might is too powerful. A mortal like me can’t enter your temple...” No matter how greedy Zhou Wen was, he didn’t dare enter to take them.

However, just as Zhou Wen said that, the pearl and jade slip flew out and quickly landed in his hand.

Zhou Wen held the pearl and jade slip in disbelief.

Could it be that my luck has really turned for the better? I actually encountered such a good thing. Or could it be that I’m handsome and confident, and Lady Supreme Yin thinks that I’m a promising talent? Zhou Wen looked at the pearl and jade slip in his hand and was momentarily at a loss.

Meanwhile, Shen Yuchi gritted his teeth so hard that they almost shattered. He had been tricked. Furthermore, he had been tricked by a deity.

However, he still couldn’t figure out why the Moon Goddess would entrap him and Wang Qiuyuan and give Zhou Wen the Companion Beasts that originally belonged to him and Wang Qiuyuan.

This didn’t make sense. It didn’t make any sense at all.

According to the information he had obtained, the Moon Goddess was a goddess who saved the world from calamity. It didn’t matter if one came from a noble family or a lowly family. Therefore, she didn’t have any requirements for their physiques. As long as one sincerely knelt and prayed, they would be rewarded by her.

But from the looks of it, that wasn’t the case at all.

Zhou Wen didn’t even kneel. He even caused trouble in front of the Moon Goddess Temple. That was a great disrespect to the Moon Goddess.

Now, not only did the Moon Goddess not punish him, but she had also scammed them and given their Companion Beasts to Zhou Wen. This infuriated Shen Yuchi to the point of nearly exploding. He couldn’t understand why this was happening.

Thankfully, Shen Yuchi had experienced too many storms in his life. He had long reached the point where he didn’t show his emotions on his face. Even though he didn’t show it at all, he was so angry that he almost went crazy.

“Lady Moon Goddess, you are truly wise, mighty, beautiful, and magnanimous...” After Zhou Wen confirmed that the Companion Beasts in his hand weren’t fake, he thought about the praises his limited vocabulary could afford and used them all to praise the Moon Goddess.

He now felt that the Moon Goddess was the best deity in the world—a deity with such foresight should be the only true god in the world.

Those gods such as God, Jade Emperor, Buddha, and the like were nothing compared to the mighty Moon Goddess. They should have long been eliminated.

“That’s not what you were thinking. Didn’t you say that I should be called Scam Goddess?” The words that came from the Moon Goddess Temple instantly made Zhou Wen break out into a cold sweat.

“Nothing of that sort. You are the gentle, beautiful, and kind Goddess of the Moon. If anyone dares to be disrespectful to you, I’ll not let him off,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said, not daring to think too much.

Moon Goddess seemed to have the ability to read minds.

Beside him, Shen Yuchi’s face turned pale. If the Moon Goddess really had the ability to read minds, what he was thinking would probably lead him to an outcome worse than Wang Qiuyuan.

Just as he thought of this, his body quickly froze, turning into a jade statue like Wang Qiuyuan.

“Since you have already obtained the Companion Beasts, would you mind doing me a small favor?” The Moon Goddess didn’t harp on the matter.

“You also know that I’m weak. What can I do for you?” Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he thought to himself, As expected, there’s no free lunch in this world. I wonder what this Moon Goddess wants? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“It’s not a big deal. Go to Moon Palace and help Chang’e defeat the logger,” the Moon Goddess said.

“Your Excellency, your divine powers are boundless. Isn’t it just a matter of moving your fingers to deal with the logger? With my lowly strength, I won’t be of much help even if I go. Instead, I might become a burden.” Zhou Wen wasn’t crazy. How could he be a match for the logger?

However, the Moon Goddess’s words confirmed that the one possessing Wei Ge was the logger.

“If I could leave this temple, would I need to seek your help?” The Moon Goddess said, “Her abilities are very compatible with the Moon Palace. If you take her to help in the battle, you might be able to defeat the logger.”

Moon Goddess was naturally referring to the frozen Ice Maiden.

“You also said that it’s a ‘might’...” Zhou Wen still didn’t want to go. Ignoring how terrifying the logger was, the body he possessed belonged to Wei Ge. They were former school classmates after all. Neither Wei Ge nor the logger had made attempts on his life. It wouldn’t be right for him to kill them, much less destroy Wei Ge’s body.

“Of course, you can also choose not to help. However, if the logger succeeds, the Moon will be destroyed. Do you think Earth will be unaffected?” the Moon Goddess said calmly.

Zhou Wen naturally knew that the Moon had a huge influence on Earth. If the Moon was really destroyed, Earth would definitely be greatly affected. It was even possible for an apocalyptic calamity to happen.

“Didn’t the logger say that he only wants to retrieve his Companion Beast? It shouldn’t be that exaggerated to the point of destroying the Moon, right?” Zhou Wen was skeptical.

“Do you know what Companion Beast he wants to take away?” the Moon Goddess asked calmly.
