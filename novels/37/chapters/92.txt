Chapter 93 Lotus Ant

The game system gave a compatibility score of 34%. This also meant that the chance of a successful fusion was at about a third. It was quite a low probability.

However, the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus was so excellent that Zhou Wen couldn’t bring himself to feed it to Truth Listener. He had no way of taking it out of the game after all.

As for the Mutated Skeleton Ant, although it was quite a good Mortal Companion Beast, it was limited by its Mortal stage. After having the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, there was a decreasing need for it. Even if he didn’t fuse it now, it would gradually be eliminated in the future.

Therefore, after plenty of thought, he decided to risk it to fuse the two Companion Beasts together.

After Zhou Wen chose to proceed with the fusion of the Mutated Skeleton Ant and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus, the game system immediately gave a notification: ‘As the Mutated Skeleton Ant is an adult, the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus will be treated as a supplement for fusion. Proceed with fusion?’

It was identical to the previous time. Zhou Wen was already mentally prepared, so he instantly chose ‘Yes.’

The Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg and Mutated Skeleton Ant bloomed with light as the former flew to the latter. As the two blobs of light merged into one, it caused the entire phone screen to light up. Instantly, nothing could be seen.

Zhou Wen waited for quite some time until the phone’s screen dimmed. Then, he heard a chime.

‘Fusion successful. Obtained Legendary Companion Beast, Mutated Lotus Flower Ant.’

Only then could Zhou Wen see a Companion Beast on his screen. It didn’t look much different from the Mutated Skeleton Ant from before. It still had a white bone exterior and its body seemed to be bigger. On its head, there was a budding blood-colored lotus flower.

After opening the stats of the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant, Zhou Wen was overjoyed by what he saw.

Companion Form: Bracer.

The Lotus Ant had inherited the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus’s Life Providence-Turbid Waters Clear Lotus. It was a pretty good and pragmatic one that made it immune to venomous liquids and corrosion.

Amongst the four stats, only Speed was 1 point short of maxing out. As for Strength, it was an Overdrive at 19, having exceeded the limits of a typical Legendary maximum. It was considered the best among the best.

Even crazier was that the Lotus Ant had retained all the Mutated Skeleton Ant’s and Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus’s skills, becoming one with five Primordial Energy Skills. Furthermore, it was a terrifying existence with rather high Primordial Energy Skill ranks.

If such a Legendary Companion Beast was put on sale, just the fact that it had five Primordial Energy Skills was enough for it to be sold at an astronomical price. If there was an overall Legendary Companion Beast ranking, the Mutated Lotus Ant would definitely rank high.

In his joy, Zhou Wen summoned the Mutated Lotus Ant and saw a horrifying tank-sized ant appear in front of him. Its body was covered in terrifying bone spikes that made it look ferocious and terrifying.

But on its head was a red lotus flower. It was connected to the top of its head with a flower bud. It made its terrifying looks appear rather adorable.

As the Mutated Lotus Ant crawled, the lotus flower on its head would bob up and down, making it rather interesting.

Just as Zhou Wen was admiring the Mutated Lotus Ant, he suddenly heard the doorbell ring. After dispelling the summon, he opened the door and was astonished to see Wang Fei.

Sunset College’s education methods were very simple. One counselor led a class and was responsible for giving class homework and missions. Under normal circumstances, they wouldn’t be directly involved in the education of students.

Students could select which teacher’s classes they attended based on the mission they had. They could then learn the knowledge and techniques they needed.

Therefore, although Wang Fei was Zhou Wen’s counselor, there weren’t many opportunities for him to meet her. She typically wouldn’t request a meeting with her students before the ten-day deadline of the last mission.

Unless a student encountered problems and sought her help, a counselor typically didn’t interfere with a student’s usual studies.

“Zhou Wen, pack your things. Let’s have a walk,” Wang Fei said directly before he could even speak.

“Miss Wang, what do you want me to do?” Zhou Wen asked, feeling somewhat unhappily.

Wang Fei said with a smile, “Professor Chen has a project that requires a student to be his assistant. I think you are very suitable for it, so I recommended you to him.”

“Is that a homework mission?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He had no intention of being an assistant.

He had long heard of the benefits that came from being a professor’s assistant as it allowed one to interact with many high-level objects and broaden one’s horizons while also gaining some pointers from a professor. It was an opportunity many students wanted.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t like having such an opportunity. Although it was beneficial, it required him to sacrifice his time to work for the professor.

To other students, such work was a way of honing themselves, a type of improvement. But to Zhou Wen, it was a waste of time that would eat into his gaming time.

“It’s not a homework mission. I just find you very suited for it, so I recommended you. Professor Chen has great achievements when it comes to nurturing Companion Beasts. In Sunset College, he’s an authority in such matters. Furthermore, he has done a great amount of research on melee-fighting Primordial Energy Skills. I believe it will be very beneficial to you if you were to learn from him.” Wang Fei was feeling rather pleased with herself.

Professor Chen was a famous old fogey. Getting anyone to convince him to take in another student as an assistant was practically impossible. In Sunset College, not more than three people could get Professor Chen to agree to such a request.

Zhou Wen wasn’t able to see Wang Fei’s face as he said directly, “Miss Wang, if it’s not a homework mission, I hope to decline the offer.”

Wang Fei’s smile instantly froze. Imagining that Zhou Wen wasn’t aware of what was happening, she explained, “Professor Chen Qishan isn’t just an authoritative figure in Sunset College, but in the entire League. By being his assistant, you can come into contact with several high-level Companion Beasts and learn of their characteristics and powers. This will be of tremendous help to your future exploring of dimensional zones. Furthermore, Professor Chen is...”

Before Wang Fei could finish, Zhou Wen said firmly, “Miss Wang, thank you for your kind intentions. I still wish to decline. My usual homework missions give me enough stress. I need time for studying and revision. I really do not have enough time, so if it isn’t a homework mission, I wish to decline.”

Wang Fei felt as if she had been doused in cold water. All her excitement and glee instantly turned to nothing. It left her mood extremely nasty.

“Are you sure you are declining?” Wang Fei asked Zhou Wen with a glare.

“Yes, Miss Wang.” Zhou Wen clearly wasn’t good at reading people as he nodded.

“Alright.” Wang Fei turned and left, her teeth grinding angrily.

As Zhou Wen’s counselor, one who had paid special attention to him, Wang Fei knew that he hadn’t attended any teacher classes for the past few days, so what did he mean by studying and revision? Apart from slaying the Blade Demonized General, he likely spent most of his days in his dorm gaming.
