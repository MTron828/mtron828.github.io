Chapter 1871 Master-Disciple Battle (2)

Clang!

Another sword appeared in front of Wang Mingyuan and blocked the Human Sovereign Stone Saber.

The Human Sovereign Stone Saber’s force remained boundless. After sending the sword flying, it continued slashing at Wang Mingyuan.

Clang! Clang!

Another two swords appeared in front of Wang Mingyuan and blocked the Human Sovereign Stone Saber in the form of a cross. Finally, they fully defended against the Human Sovereign Stone Saber.

“The power of the other world is indeed interesting.” Wang Mingyuan threw out the Immortal Culling Sword that flew into the air. The four swords surrounded and trapped Zhou Wen inside.

This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen the complete Four Immortal Vanquishing Swords. The four swords emitted terrifying might. Just the sword intent from the swords could wipe away the will to kill.

The four swords moved as sword beams crisscrossed. The sword beams intertwined like lightning in a bid to slay Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen’s eyes were clear as he brandished the Human Sovereign Stone Saber with both hands. He didn’t make any unnecessary movements as he blocked the attacks from the four Immortal Vanquishing Swords.

The combat suit provided him with potent energy, allowing him to fight an Apocalypse expert at Wang Mingyuan’s level without being at a disadvantage. He even had the advantage.

One had to know that Wang Mingyuan had absorbed the power of countless Apocalypse-grade experts. He was so powerful that no one in the world could match him.

The energy of the combat suit allowed Zhou Wen to fight him without being at a disadvantage. This was absolutely amazing.

Bang!

Zhou Wen suddenly slashed out, sending the four Immortal Vanquishing Swords flying.

The four Immortal Vanquishing Swords that had been swept away flew back to Wang Mingyuan’s side. Wang Mingyuan looked at Zhou Wen’s combat suit and said, “You’re actually immune to the taboo power of the four Immortal Vanquishing Swords. It’s no wonder she could use that combat suit to defeat the Immortal Thearch back then.”

“You know about her?” Zhou Wen stopped when he heard that and didn’t continue attacking Wang Mingyuan.

“Back then, your father, Ouyang Ting, Jing Daoxian, and I entered Chess Mountain together and got lost inside. We took different paths. Finally, Ouyang Ting and I boarded the ship from another world and found something on it,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“What did you find?” Zhou Wen immediately asked.

He had found almost nothing on the ship previously. It turned out that the useful things had long been taken away by Wang Mingyuan and Ouyang Ting.

However, Wang Mingyuan didn’t say what he and Ouyang Ting had found on the ship. Instead, he said, “Jing Daoxian and your father didn’t reach the ship. The place they went should be where the Immortal Thearch was imprisoned.”

“That Immortal Thearch lost unjustly. She only lost because she didn’t understand the other world. If not for the unequal information, how could she have lost to such a person?” Wang Mingyuan glanced at the woman who was restrained by him. “The energy of the other world is stronger than the energy of this world, but their order in life might not be higher than ours. Although that Immortal Thearch was defeated because of the unequal information, she wasn’t someone who would be at the mercy of others. In that battle, she secretly took something that originally belonged to a woman. Furthermore, when Jing Daoxian barged in, she deliberately let him obtain it.”

Zhou Wen knew that he was talking about the Lost Immortal Sutra. Only today did he realize that the Lost Immortal Sutra came from The Thearch.

“Your father was able to take An Jing out of Chess Mountain because of that Immortal Thearch. Otherwise, with your father’s abilities back then, how could he have taken An Jing away who was in the core meant to replace Earth’s Companion Beast?” Wang Mingyuan’s words left Zhou Wen alarmed.

“You know that An Jing is the baby my father brought out?” Zhou Wen said in surprise.

“I didn’t know that before. Only after I took you in as my disciple did I realize that you were definitely not that baby. Although your father’s cultivation talent isn’t much, he’s still considered a talent. He is unpredictable and creative. Only he could think of replacing An Jing with you. He lied to me, Ouyang Ting, and Jing Daoxian. He’s the only one in the world who can lie to the three of us.”

“Since you knew that An Jing was the baby, why didn’t you attack her?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Why should I?” Wang Mingyuan asked.

“Because she’s Earth’s Companion Beast. Isn’t that what you want?” Zhou Wen said.

“Before I boarded the ship, that was indeed what I wanted. However, after seeing what was on the ship, Earth’s Companion Beast was already useless to me. Or rather, it wasn’t what I wanted to begin with.” Wang Mingyuan’s eyes shimmered with a strange glint.

“What did you see on the ship?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask again.

“I saw another possibility.” Wang Mingyuan didn’t elaborate. He glanced at the woman and said, “I want to enter the other world, but my strength to this very day can’t open the passageway to enter that world. Therefore, I need her.”

“What possibility?” Zhou Wen also looked at the woman. The woman didn’t say a word.

Wang Mingyuan didn’t say anything as he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “It’s time for you to leave. The combat suit on you might be able to defeat Immortal Thearch, but it’s useless against me. This is because I’ve already figured out that world. These things are no longer a mystery to me.”

“I don’t know much about it, so I want to know more. Therefore, it’s best you leave this woman with me.” Zhou Wen brandished his saber again and slashed at Wang Mingyuan.

“Must we fight?” Wang Mingyuan sighed and extended his hand. The four Immortal Vanquishing Swords flew into his hand and fused into one, turning into a sword.

Clang! The clash of blades didn’t produce a shockwave this time. Zhou Wen felt the power of his combat suit flow towards Wang Mingyuan like a dam.

Zhou Wen was very familiar with this power. It was Jiang Yan’s ability. However, Wang Mingyuan had improved it. He was better and more terrifying than Jiang Yan.

With a thought, Zhou Wen activated sin of All Life. His body immediately absorbed external forces like Wang Mingyuan.

Both parties were absorbing energy. Immediately, it was like a tug-of-war. Zhou Wen couldn’t absorb Wang Mingyuan’s energy, and neither could Wang Mingyuan absorb his.

The sword in Wang Mingyuan’s hand suddenly pressed down. As he absorbed the power, he could also suppress his opponent. Furthermore, the power on the sword became stronger and stronger. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The more pressure Zhou Wen gave him, the stronger Wang Mingyuan’s sword became.

He actually fused Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya’s powers into one? Zhou Wen’s anger gradually rose.

He knew that Wang Mingyuan was deliberately provoking him by using Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s strength in front of him.

But that didn’t matter because Zhou Wen was really furious.

Zhou Wen’s strength erupted as the Human Realm domain replaced the Sin of All Life. Human Sovereign Stone Saber slashed again, but this time, it was powered by In the Human World.

In the Human World was only a Calamity-grade skill, but with the augmentation of the combat suit’s energy, it now possessed the strength of the Apocalypse grade.

Clang!

Human Realm’s first slash sent the sword in Wang Mingyuan’s hand flying. The second slash forced Wang Mingyuan to release his grip on the woman and retreat. The third slash shattered the seemingly long distance in front of Wang Mingyuan as the blade came slashing in front of him.
