Chapter 1626 Shaking the Star Palace Empty

Translator: CKtalon

n the fleeting clouds, jade buildings appeared and disappeared like mirages.

A jade pavilion would appear in the clouds one second, turning into a palace the next second.

From time to time, one could see mountain peaks floating in the air. The mountain peaks had something divine about them. Some of the mountain peaks were unique and dangerous, while others carried a weight of

solemnity. There were even mountain peaks that seemed to support the heavens as they stood erect in the world.

However, they seemed to be illusions. The flight of a beautiful butterfly across them or the drifting of clouds would result in the images of the jade buildings and mountains vanishing.

n the sea of clouds that filled the sky, there was a small boat slowly advancing. At the bow stood a man. His white clothes fluttered slightly with the clouds, but his long hair that resembled ice and snow hung behind

him without any ripples.

He was handsome with a pair of crystal-like dragon horns on his head. Although he was handsome, he didn’t have the sharp angular features of a typical handsome man. His face was softer, giving off a gentle feeling.

When the boat arrived in front of the mirage-like clouds, a jade building gradually appeared as butterflies flew out.

The butterflies that looked like phantoms gradually turned corporeal. Their wings flapped, sweeping away the clouds like a veil, making the illusory jade building behind the clouds appear even more real.

The boat beneath the white-robed man’s feet had already stopped as he calmly looked at the jade building. On the jade building’s plaque were two words that didn’t seem to be tainted by the mortal world.

Immortal Crossing. The white-robed man silently read the words on the jade building’s signboard. His eyes revealed a strange look that seemed to be praise, but also somewhat different.

“Immortality and mortality are just separated by a single thought. The world only knows how to seek an immortal destiny, but they don’t know that such destiny is already across them. It’s just that the world is ignorant

and doesn’t know how to redeem themselves.” A woman’s voice sounded from the Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion.

“Having been summoned, Dragon King of the Octokind, Wang Mingyuan, is humbly here before you to pay my respects. May I know which Immortal Supremacy of the Immortals you are?” Wang Mingyuan folded his

arms in front of his chest, his sleeves hanging down as he bowed slightly.

The woman in the Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion didn’t seem to hear him as she continued, “Zhou Wen is your disciple?”

“Yes,” Wang Mingyuan answered calmly.

“Where did he obtain the concept of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal?” the woman asked again.

“Self-taught.” Wang Mingyuan remained as gentle as ever.

t’s rare for an Immortal to comprehend the concepts of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal. Do you think a mere mortal human can comprehend the concepts of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal?” The woman’s voice

was somewhat cold.

‘ve never taught him. If he hadn’t figured it out himself, I wouldn’t know how he learned it either,” Wang Mingyuan said.

if you can teach the concepts of the Zenith Heaven True Immortal, us Immortals will respect you as master.” The woman’s voice turned even colder. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

wouldn’t dare.” Wang Mingyuan bowed slightly. His eyes were lowered, but he didn’t bend his back.

“Go. Bring Zhou Wen to the Immortals.” The woman’s voice sounded again.

mmortal Supremacy, may I ask why you want him to come to the Immortals?” Wang Mingyuan had no intention of leaving.

f I say I want to kill him, will you bring him here?” The woman seemed to be born a cold person. Her voice had a coldness that kept others at bay.

“No, but I know that you won’t kill him, Immortal Supremacy. There’s no need to go through so much trouble to kill him if you want him dead,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“You know that I won’t kill him, but you still reject me. Do you think that I won’t really kill you because of my good temper?” With the woman’s voice, infinite power seemed to surge out of the Immortal Crossing Jade

Pavilion like invisible threads that bound Wang Mingyuan’s body.

Tears immediately appeared on Wang Mingyuan’s clothes due to the invisible threads. The silk clung tightly to his skin, and an invisible thread had already wrapped around his neck. Just touching his skin was enough

to slice through the crystalline jade-like skin as blood seeped out.

It was as though Wang Mingyuan’s head would leave his body forever with just a thought from the woman.

“I have no intention of offending you. I just want you to know that I’m his master and naturally have to suffer any punishment my disciple needs to suffer.” Wang Mingyuan’s expression remained calm as before. The

gentleness seemed to have penetrated deep into his bones. Even if his head was chopped off, it would be difficult for him to turn ferocious.

The invisible threads suddenly retracted before dissipating, as though the mirage in the clouds had never existed.

“The path to immortality and mortality is gradually opening. There’s nothing stopping it in this great world. All races vie for supremacy, and my race needs a Holy Son in the human world. Go, bring Zhou Wen to the

Immortals. As long as he’s my race’s Holy Son, the matter between Perfect Sword Immortal and Berserker Immortal will be written off.”

The Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion gradually vanished into the clouds, going from something corporeal to nothingness. Finally, it vanished like a phantom. Only the woman’s voice echoed in the sea of clouds.

“Wang Mingyuan bids… farewell…” Wang Mingyuan bowed slightly and turned around on the boat. He looked at the ethereal sea of clouds with a smile in his eyes.

Zhou Wen continued exploring the Star Palace and entered the seventh Star Palace.

The seventh star of the Big Dipper was Alkaid, and the Starlord was Army Breaker. It was said that he was a Starlord with immense killing intent. Legend had it that he was an extremely destructive existence just like

the Seven Killings Star.

However, after seeing Starlord Martial Song, Zhou Wen was still very doubtful whether Starlord Army Breaker was the kind with immense killing intent.

After teleporting into the Alkaid dimensional zone, he immediately saw the Star Palace. It looked surprisingly normal. A proper Star Palace stood in the sun-like halo.

There was a long staircase from where Zhou Wen stood to the front of the Starlight Palace. It looked like a staircase to heaven.

Zhou Wen stepped onto the stairs and walked towards Alkaid Star Palace, but he quickly realized that his Essence Energy was rapidly drained.

Zhou Wen sped up and charged towards the Star Palace’s door, but the faster he charged, the faster he lost his Essence Energy. Before he reached the midway point, nearly half his Essence Energy had been drained.

Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he used spatial teleportation to reach the end of the steps and the door to Alkaid Star Palace.

However, at the instant he instant transmitted out, he felt the Essence Energy in his body empty. There wasn’t even a drop left. His legs went limp and he nearly fell to the ground.

Thankfully, even without Essence Energy, Zhou Wen’s physique was already rather powerful. He stood firm and looked at the door of Alkaid Star Palace. He was somewhat surprised. As expected of the last star of the

Big Dipper. My Essence Energy is useless before entering the Star Palace.

Zhou Wen was already attempting to recover his Essence Energy. His Essence Energy recovery speed was very fast, but here, as long as there was a sliver of Essence Energy in his body, it would immediately be

drained. There was no way to gather it..
