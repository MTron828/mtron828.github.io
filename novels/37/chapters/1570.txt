Chapter 1571: Ravenous Wolf Ring

Translator: CKtalon

After Zhou Wen came out of the teleportation nexus, he indeed arrived on Merak Star. Beside him was the Cube. He would find himself back at the Cube he used if he were to use it.

Zhou Wen naturally didn’t need to return. He directly used Singularity Universe to teleport back to Earth.

I’m finally back.?Zhou Wen couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw the familiar scenery.

Although living outside didn’t adversely affect him, he still felt comfortable at home.

This was already within the range of Guide City, but it was still a distance from the city. Zhou Wen instant transmitted and returned to his yard.

“Old Zhou, you’re finally back,” said Li Xuan—who lived beside him—with a grin when he came over to check due to the commotion.

“It’s only been a few days. You make it sound like I’ve been away for a few years. Nothing happened here, right?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“With me around, what can happen?” Li Xuan seemed to think of something as he changed the topic and continued with a smile, “I forgot. Something did happen.”

“What is it?” Zhou Wen wasn’t flustered at all. Li Xuan’s tone didn’t sound urgent.

“Xia Xuanyue came to Guide City,” Li Xuan said.

“Why is she here?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He had a deep impression of Xia Xuanyue.

The Demonic Sword in Demonic Neonate’s hand originally belonged to Xia Xuanyue. Furthermore, after what happened to Xia Jiuhuang, it was difficult not to remember her.

“The claim is that she’s here to see if we can do some business. I think she’s here for you. Otherwise, in this crappy place of ours, what business can the dignified eldest daughter of the Xia family do here?” Li Xuan nudged Zhou Wen with his elbow and said with a knowing expression, “Aren’t you still single? I think this eldest daughter of the Xia family is pretty good. Although she’s a little older than you, she’s beautiful. Besides, as the saying goes, a wife three years older than the husband ensures a richer life.”

“What nonsense are you spouting? I’ve only met Xia Xuanyue a few times. I’m not familiar with her at all.” Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry.

Li Xuan chuckled and said, “You’ll soon get to know each other, and before you know it, you’ll be bedding her.”

“Don’t spout nonsense. It’s not good if she hears you.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to waste his breath on Li Xuan. He pondered and said, “What do you think she’s doing here? Is she friend or foe?”

“My take is that she doesn’t seem to have any ill intentions. I reckon the Xia family finds us promising and wants to make a bet ahead of time,” Li Xuan said.

“If that’s the case, we can let her stay. If we really build a city in the future, we will definitely need to connect to other cities. The Xia family has a deep background and plenty of resources. It’s not a bad choice to become partners.” Zhou Wen had a good impression of the Xia siblings.

“She’s been here for days. Do you want to meet her?” Li Xuan asked.

“Where is she?” Zhou Wen felt that he should meet Xia Xuanyue. It was best if he could clearly figure out why she was here.

“She’s staying in a hotel in the city. I originally prepared a place for her to stay, but she said that she wanted to tour the area, so she didn’t stay here.” Li Xuan paused before continuing, “Recently, she has been circling the nearby dimensional zones. She’s probably carrying out an inspection.”

“Alright, I’ll do some packing now and find her later.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he placed Demonic Neonate on the bed, took a shower, and changed his clothes.

By the time Zhou Wen came out, Li Xuan had already left. Although the city was nominally theirs, Li Xuan had been the one worrying about various matters. Even if Zhou Wen wanted to chat with him, Li Xuan really didn’t have the time.

He took out Starlord Ravenous Wolf and looked at its stats.

Companion Form: Ring

Zhou Wen checked Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s stats carefully and couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback. Typically, only some special Companion Beasts, such as Banana Fairy and Truth Listener would have their stats at the minimum after evolving to the Calamity grade.

It wasn’t surprising that Starlord Ravenous Wolf had an Evolvable attribute. However, its attributes were the lowest at the Hell level. This was intriguing.

Typical wild Companion Eggs wouldn’t have their values at the starting value. Starlord Ravenous Wolf having such stats meant that he wasn’t ordinary at all.

In that case, the Starlords in every domain are actually in their most basic form. There should still be plenty of room for growth.?Zhou Wen thought again.?Don’t tell me the Starlords of the Big Dipper are in the form of rings? Perhaps they can even form a set.

Zhou Wen was only musing. He also knew that it was too difficult to have seven Starlord Companion Beasts drop.

As Zhou Wen had already seen Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s appearance and abilities, he summoned him in the form of a ring.

A star ring appeared on Zhou Wen’s finger. The surface of the ring was a star that emitted a starlight halo that enveloped Zhou Wen’s body.

What’s the use of this ring??Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. He tried a few times and realized that the starlight wasn’t a protective shield. It couldn’t stop external forces from invading.

With a thought, he took out his phone and entered the Big Dipper instance dungeon. Zhou Wen immediately knew what use the halo had.

With this ring, the high temperature and radiation on Dubhe were ineffective against him. Furthermore, Dubhe’s power was constantly gushing into the ring. The ring served as a conduit, making Zhou Wen feel as though infinite power was coursing through his body.

This ability was only effective on Dubhe, but it was useless in other Star Palaces.

This thing is only useful on Dubhe. I can’t stay on Dubhe forever, right? It’s impossible for me to invite people to Dubhe every time I fight.?Zhou Wen found the ring’s ability somewhat useless.

However, Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s combat strength was still very strong. He didn’t need to appear in his companion form.

Zhou Wen packed his things and thought for a moment before picking up the sleeping Demonic Neonate and taking her with him.

He didn’t know what was happening with Demonic Neonate. Zhou Wen was afraid that things would be bad if something alarmed her while he wasn’t by her side.

He carried Demonic Neonate out and headed for Xia Xuanyue’s hotel.

…

What Xia Xuanyue had seen in Guide City over the past few days shocked her.

Xia Xuanyue and Xia Liuchuan originally believed that investing in Guide City now was providing timely help.

However, the situation in Guide City was very different from what they had imagined.

Apart from Li Xuan, there were also Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan who were helping Zhou Wen. The two of them were rather famous in the Federation, but according to the Xia family’s intelligence, their strength was much greater than their fame.

Now that they were here, it meant that their families had already chosen to invest in Guide City and Zhou Wen.
