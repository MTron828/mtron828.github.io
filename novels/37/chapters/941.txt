Chapter 942: Evil Spirit King

The fruit was unique, like a graphite fruit.

Zhou Wen plucked the fruit and immediately checked its stats.

Evil Spirit King: Mortal (Evolvable)

Strength: 11

Speed: 11

Constitution: 11

Essence Energy: 11

Talent Skill: Spirit Devouring

Companion Form: Soul

It’s the same soul state as Doctor Darkness. In other words, it can attach itself to me, strengthen my stats, and let me use its abilities. Unfortunately, it’s at the Mortal stage. Although it can evolve, it still needs some time to advance to the Mythical stage. Zhou Wen studied his only skill, Spirit Devouring, and realized that it wasn’t very practical, but it was a skill that was almost like a bug in computer games.

Spirit Devouring could only be used on creatures of the same level. Furthermore, the success rate wasn’t high. It might not succeed once in ten attempts. Even if one didn’t skip levels, there was a chance of a backlash from creatures of the same level.

When used on creatures higher than one’s level, it was basically a 100% failure rate.

However, the functionality of Spirit Devouring was extremely terrifying. It was like a bug.

When used on any creature, there was a certain chance of obtaining one of their skills. In other words, having the Spirit Devouring Skill was equivalent to having infinite skills. If one wanted a particular skill, they just needed to devour a particular dimensional creature.

If it advanced to the Mythical stage and combined with all sorts of impressive skills, it would be amazingly powerful.

I wonder what its Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny are. Can they also be increased through devouring? Zhou Wen felt that it was unlikely. If that was the case, it would be fantastic.

Zhou Wen eagerly hatched the Evil Spirit King and saw a black puppet wearing a white mask appear in front of him.

His black clothes were like a devil’s gown. The mask on his face was smooth white, as though it was carved from bones. It looked very strange.

Zhou Wen attempted to feed it with Companion Eggs. The Evil Spirit King directly used the Devouring Skill. The palm wrapped in the black glove grabbed the Legendary Companion Egg and sucked it dry.

Bam!

The Evil Spirit King’s body exploded. Its body was too weak, so it couldn’t receive the energy in an Legendary Companion Egg.

Thankfully, it’s in-game. If it was outside the game, this fellow would already be dead. From the looks of it, I can only use Mortal Companion Eggs to feed the Evil Spirit King. When he advances to the Legendary stage, I can use Legendary Companion Eggs to raise him. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel a headache when he thought of this.

It wasn’t difficult to obtain Legendary and Epic Companion Eggs, but Mortal Companion Eggs were really difficult to find. The chances of a Mortal Companion Egg dropping were too low. If one were to buy them in real life, they needed to pay a high price and it wasn’t easy to obtain them.

I hope he doesn’t need too many Companion Eggs to advance to the Legendary stage. Zhou Wen didn’t continue feeding the Evil Spirit King because he didn’t have any Mortal Companion Eggs. He could only farm for them in the future or spend money to buy them.

After arriving at the An family residence, An Tianzuo and An Sheng weren’t around. When Zhou Wen saw Ouyang Lan and Ya’er, he almost didn’t recognize Ya’er.

She was wearing a pink princess dress with a huge pink butterfly hair clip. She was hugging a Barbie doll in her arms as she sat on the sofa expressionlessly.

“How is it? She’s very cute, right? I spent a lot of effort to dress her up so beautifully. Don’t say that she’s not pretty,” Ouyang Lan said smugly.

“Can I take her back?” Although Zhou Wen didn’t find it ugly, it was somewhat different from Ya’er’s usual style.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen seemed to know why Ya’er had sent a message when she saw him online.

“What’s the rush? Let Ya’er stay here for a few more days. I still plan on taking her to the amusement park,” Ouyang Lan said.

Without waiting for Zhou Wen to speak, Ya’er had already stood up from the sofa and walked to Zhou Wen’s side. Clearly, she planned on returning with him.

“Perhaps another time,” Zhou Wen said.

When Ouyang Lan saw that Ya’er wanted to leave, she didn’t force her to stay. However, she got someone to move out all the things she had bought for Ya’er. She instructed the driver to drive Ya’er to Zhou Wen’s dorm.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what the bags were. Since they were for Ya’er, he didn’t say anything.

After returning to her dorm, Ya’er changed into her usual clothes.

“Did you suffer at the An family?” Zhou Wen asked Ya’er.

Ya’er shook her head and said, “No, Sister Lan treated me very well.”

“That’s good.” Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. However, when he heard Ya’er call Ouyang Lan Sis Lan, he couldn’t help but grumble inwardly. How obsessed are women with their youth and looks? Is it that difficult to admit that they are aging?

Zhou Wen planned on taking Ya’er out for a walk. The Glimmer Life Soul needed Zhou Wen to continue visiting unfamiliar places to advance to a Perfect Body.

As for the advancement method of Sword Pill, Zhou Wen hadn’t figured it out yet. He was still in the process of absorbing Essence Energy.

Before leaving Luoyang, Zhou Wen planned on learning a few skills. This was because after the Demon God Catalog’s Life Soul reached the Perfect Body, Zhou Wen’s Constitution finally reached 41 points. He had a few Mythical skill crystals to absorb.

Zhou Wen roughly sorted out the Mythical skill crystals he already had and could absorb.

Jade Lute Crystal: Constitution 41, Spatial 21.

Great Might Vajra Bull Crystal: Constitution: 41, Essence Energy: 41

National Cornerstone Gold Man Crystal: Essence Energy 41, Constitution 41

Black-Armored Golden Silk Turtle Crystal: Essence Energy 41, Constitution 41

Blue Sky Crystal Beast Crystal: Constitution: 41, Spatial: 21.

Zhou Wen searched and found that there were five Mythical crystals he could absorb in real life. The Mythical skill crystals that dropped in-game had long disappeared from respawning because he couldn’t absorb them back then.

These were obtained in reality, and his attributes had already met the requirements.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and absorbed the Jade Lute Crystal. As his stats had reached a certain level, the absorption process was very smooth. The Jade Lute Crystal quickly transformed into Essence Energy that formed a new Essence Energy circulation in Zhou Wen’s body.

‘Absorbed Jade Lute Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill, String Aural Quake.’

Zhou Wen also obtained some information. It was as he had expected. It was a spatial skill, not an aural skill.

Unfortunately, String Aural Quake needed a string instrument as a weapon to be used. Without a similar instrument, this skill couldn’t be used.

Ordinary musical instruments naturally weren’t sufficient. They couldn’t withstand the vibrations of the Essence Energy and the strings would snap. Thankfully, Zhou Wen had a Golden Harp, so he could give it a try.
