Chapter 1637 Terrifying Companion Beast

The Companion Beast only watched without any intention of moving.

The controlled electromagnetic tentacle monster and strange fish lunged at Jiuyang and company fiercely. Their strength didn’t change at all; they even seemed stronger. A large electromagnetic storm descended as Jiuyang condensed the Sun God Light. The collision with the electromagnetic storm triggered a terrifying energy explosion. There were dazzling light spots everywhere. It was so dazzling that one couldn’t even open their eyes.

The strange fish’s tail that covered the sky descended, enveloping the black and white wolves, the blue ribbon of light, and Xiao.

The blue ribbon of light was too fast. In a flash, it rushed out of the tail’s range. Xiao’s figure phased away and vanished like a ghost. The black and white wolves weren’t fast enough. They could only raise the barrier and forcefully block the strange fish’s tail.

The muslin-like tail enveloped the barrier. Although it couldn’t crack it, the tail enveloped the barrier and constantly tightened. The barrier shrank bit by bit.

Seeing that the situation wasn’t looking good, the blue ribbon of light headed straight for the exit. It followed the passageway through the abyss to the outside world and rushed out without looking back. “Xiao, are you confident?” Jiuyang asked as he fought the electromagnetic tentacle monster.

“Let’s give it a try. That fellow’s strength is probably more terrifying than we expected.” As Xiao spoke, he charged at the newly-born Companion Beast like a phantom.

Although Xiao came from the Trajectory Holy Temple, he was proficient in the various techniques of the six Holy Temples. He could even use the various famous techniques of the Federation.

At the instant he instant transmitted to the Companion Beast, Xiao’s entire body moved. Every part of his body turned into a terrifying killing weapon.

Even a finger or tongue turned into terrifying weapons of murder.

Coupled with his strange movement technique, Xiao delivered countless attacks in an instant. Fingers, palms, fists, elbow, shoulder, knees, legs, and feet. All sorts of attacks rained down on the Companion Beast’s white jade-like body like a storm. It struck every inch of its body countless times. Every strike carried terrifying Yin power that penetrated its body. Perhaps it was because it didn’t react in time, the Companion Beast didn’t show any resistance. Its body retreated repeatedly before it was sent flying by Xiao’s punch.

Boom!

The Companion Beast’s body flew out and slammed into the stone dome, creating a huge crater as its body sank into the shattered rocks.

Its body was embedded in the rocks, but it didn’t struggle. Its feline-like eyes stared straight ahead as though it wasn’t focused. It was unknown what it was looking at.

Xiao had no intention of stopping. He instantly appeared in front of the Companion Beast and threw a barrage of punches at its face.

Just as the phantom-like fist was about to land on the Companion Beast’s face, the fist shadows that filled the sky suddenly vanished. A claw grabbed Xiao’s fist.

Xiao tried his best to escape the claw, but his wrist felt like it was about to snap. The fist held by the claw remained motionless.

This was no trifling matter. Xiao’s other arm and legs moved as his body attacked the Companion Beast in an extremely strange manner. Every joint in his body seemed to contain immense explosive power.

Before Xiao’s attack landed on the Companion Beast, the Companion Beast’s fist suddenly exerted strength as it raised Xiao’s body.

Boom!

Xiao’s body spun uncontrollably as he was slammed into the rocks. Blood spewed out of his mouth as his bones emitted cracking sounds. It was unknown how many had been shattered.

At some point in time, the Companion Beast had already drilled out of the rocks. It floated in the air and looked at Xiao who had been smashed into the rocks. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Its feline-like eyes gradually began to glow as it stared at Xiao with a strange smile.

Xiao also stared at it. He felt an unprecedented crisis.

Xiao had experienced too many storms. He knew when things only looked dangerous and when it was really dangerous. Even when he entered Lake Frustration, he didn’t feel that he was in such grave danger.

“Xiao, be careful.” Jiuyang wanted to rush over to help, but the electromagnetic tentacle monster held him back fearlessly. No matter how Jiuyang struck, the electromagnetic tentacle monster’s body would gather together again before fusing into one.

It was as if it wasn’t a living creature at all, but a collection of countless iron sand particles. Due to the existence of electromagnetism, no matter how its body was destroyed, it could be sucked back and reformed as a whole.

They were both at the Heaven level. Although Jiuyang’s offensive strength was far stronger than the electromagnetic tentacle monster after absorbing the Holy Artifact, one didn’t need to defend at all and attacked with all its might. The other had to take into account many things. Even though he had the advantage, he couldn’t escape the entanglement of the electromagnetic monster any time soon.

Xiao heard Jiuyang’s warning, but it was too late. In fact, he had already begun moving his body, hoping to use the power of the Trajectory to traverse the void and pull away from the Companion Beast.

However, just as his body was about to enter the void, a claw grabbed his neck. His body that had already turned into an illusion seemed to have no corporeal body. One of his feet had now stepped into the void and was pulled out.

Bang!

The claw that grabbed Xiao’s neck pressed him into the rocks. Xiao’s entire body sank into the rocks again, causing the hard rocks to splatter everywhere.

Following that, the Companion Beast’s entire body seemed to turn into a killing weapon. Fingers, palms, fists, feet, legs, knees, elbow, etc. landed on Xiao like a storm.

Just like a replica of Xiao’s bombardment of the Companion Beast, every inch of Xiao’s body crackled from the Companion Beast’s attacks. All his bones were fractured.

What was even more terrifying was that Xiao’s Trajectory power was unable to free him from his present predicament. He was crushed there and could only bear the brunt of the dense barrage of attacks.

“Wa!” Blood spewed out of Xiao’s mouth as his body distorted and deformed. He sank into the rocks and no longer looked like a human.

“Xiao!” Jiuyang was alarmed. Although they had already expected the Companion Beast’s abilities to be very high, they never expected them to be this high.

After fusing with the Holy Artifact, Xiao was already a true Heaven-level existence. Furthermore, with Xiao’s abilities, he was top-notch among Heaven-level existences. It was unimaginable that he would be thrashed like this.

“Don’t come over.” Jiuyang was just about to rush over and attract the Companion Beast’s attention when he heard Xiao’s voice.

Xiao’s voice was definitely not a result of pessimistic self-sacrifice. His voice didn’t have the down and out feeling of a loser, nor did it have the weakness it should have. In any case, it had a terrifying madness.

Jiuyang looked at Xiao in puzzlement and realized that there was still blood at the corner of his mouth, but his eyes were somewhat terrifying. His eyes seemed to be filled with madness.
