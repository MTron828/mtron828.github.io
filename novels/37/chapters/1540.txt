Chapter 1541: Wolf Kiss

Translator: CKtalon

Crack!

With the sound of scissors opening and closing, Zhou Wen saw the light blast in the palace suddenly vanish as the world in front of him became clearer.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors stood there, levitating in the hall. The Tiger Soul General with armor that resembled burning crystals also stood in the hall. As for the amethyst-armored creature, it had already collapsed. Its head and body had been separated.

His body quickly dissipated into purple streams of light. With a tinkling sound, a few crystals fell to the ground. They were all high-valued ones with values exceeding 200.

One of them was a skill crystal, but no Companion Egg dropped.

‘Killed Hell creature, Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’

Zhou Wen picked up the skill crystal and took a look. The stat requirements weren’t high—99 Constitution, Strength, Essence Energy, and Speed. Zhou Wen met all of these, but he needed a light-elemental Essence Energy Art which he could come up with a solution for. The only difficulty was the 99 Light-elemental stat.

The Light stat was a special attribute, so the chances of it dropping weren’t high. Zhou Wen had never downloaded a Light-elemental zone, so he hadn’t had many Light-elemental crystals drop. He was far from reaching the Light stat requirements.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling depressed, he suddenly realized that one of the dimensional crystals that Starlord Ravenous Wolf dropped was Light-elemental.

Without any hesitation, he absorbed the Light stat crystal that nearly reached 300 in value.

Zhou Wen achieved 99 Light stat points. This was the limit at the Terror grade as he hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade. No matter how high the stat crystals he absorbed were, it was impossible for him to continue raising his stats.

This really doesn’t make sense. The limit of the Mythical stage’s stats is 81, but the limit of the Terror grade’s stats is 99. Isn’t the difference too small??Zhou Wen found it odd. The difference in values between the other levels was huge. It was about double. Only the difference between the Mythical stage and the Terror grade was tiny. He didn’t know why.

That was what he thought, but he could only come to terms with the reality. No matter how unreasonable it was, it couldn’t be changed. He could only adapt.

Thankfully, with 99 points of Light stats, he satisfied the requirements needed to absorb the skill crystal. What was lacking now was a Light-stat Terror transformation ability.

Among the Essence Energy Arts I simulated, the only one that can be associated with light is the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. That flame of life should be considered light, right??Zhou Wen wasn’t sure as he switched his Essence Energy Art to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. Then, he picked up the skill crystal and attempted to absorb it.

Immediately, a hot and numbing force flowed out of the skill crystal and rushed into Zhou Wen’s body, making his entire body feel like it was being baked by high temperatures.

Thankfully, he was in-game. If he were outside, Zhou Wen’s clothes would have been burned to ashes by the high temperature.

The terrifying energy barbarically opened up a new Essence Energy circulation in Zhou Wen’s body. The terrifyingly high temperature and radiation energy made Zhou Wen believe that the blood-colored avatar’s body was about to collapse.

Thankfully, he ultimately survived and absorbed Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s skill crystal.

‘Absorbed Starlord Ravenous Wolf Crystal. Attained Hell-level Essence Energy Skill: Wolf Kiss.’

Wolf Kiss!?Zhou Wen sensed the skill information from the Essence Energy Crystal and his expression turned odd. He opened the skill column and saw that it was indeed Wolf Kiss.

Wolf Kiss (Hell): The Ravenous Wolf Star is the Star of Desire. The Ravenous Wolf’s Kiss is earth-shattering.

What the hell!?Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. He originally imagined that with Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s powerful abilities, any random skill like a light blast, radiation, or high temperature would greatly increase the destructive power of his skills. To his surprise, he ended up with Wolf Kiss.

The skill introduction sounded very strong, but Zhou Wen couldn’t be hugging the enemy and kissing them amid his battle, right?

Zhou Wen imagined a scene of him fighting An Tianzuo. At the brink of losing, he could only use the only Hell-level skill he had—Wolf Kiss—to turn the tables.

He then took the opportunity to hug An Tianzuo’s head and use Wolf Kiss. It was an unbearable sight.

Zhou Wen definitely hadn’t misunderstood the language describing the skill’s usage because the information had been transmitted to his brain by the Essence Energy Crystal. That was exactly how Wolf Kiss was used.

How can I use this skill!?Zhou Wen was so depressed that he nearly vomited blood.

This skill wasn’t suitable to be used against men. If it was used on monsters, even if Zhou Wen could bring himself to kiss them, many monsters’ mouths would be extremely large. Ignoring kissing, Zhou Wen would just be giving them more protein if he really leaned his head over.

Although he didn’t know how powerful Wolf Kiss was, Zhou Wen was certain that he couldn’t use it casually. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Just like kowtowing could trigger the Sigh of the King—something Zhou Wen knew was useful—but he really couldn’t bring himself into such embarrassment. Most of the time, Zhou Wen was embarrassed to use that move.

Wolf Kiss was about the same, but Zhou Wen realized that he could use it at times after some thought.

He distributed the other stat crystals to the Companion Beasts that needed them. Banana Fairy’s stats were already maxed out. It was useless eating them without leveling up. The Soul Mirror was almost maxed as well. Raising stats wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen. The difficult part was how to raise the level.

“If Banana Fairy can advance to the Calamity grade, she might be able to extinguish the sun with a gust of Supreme Yin Wind. I wouldn’t need to go through so much trouble!”

Zhou Wen was just musing. If he wanted to extinguish the sun, it was unknown if the Apocalypse grade could do it, much less the Calamity grade.

After tidying up everything, Zhou Wen circled the palace again and realized that there was only one hall. There were no other exits behind it, nor were there any other palaces.

At the back of the palace was a strange altar. On it seemed to be some kind of runes used for rituals.

Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to stand on it as a notification popped up in-game: Do you want to teleport to Merak Star Palace?

Zhou Wen immediately understood that the Big Dipper instance dungeon was indeed a serial dungeon. He guessed that there was a dungeon on each of the Big Dipper stars. He had to clear all seven dungeons to clear the Big Dipper instance dungeon.

Starlord Ravenous Wolf in the first dungeon is at the Hell level. Typically, dungeons become stronger the further one goes. I wonder how strong the dimensional creatures in the next six dungeons will be.?Zhou Wen thought for a moment and chose no.

He wanted to see what would happen if he chose no.

System Notice: Do you want to teleport out of Dubhe Palace?

Zhou Wen immediately chose ‘yes’ to see where he would teleport to.

The teleportation nexus flashed as the scene in front of Zhou Wen changed. There were dazzling flames everywhere. Zhou Wen looked around and realized that he was at the periphery of Dubhe.

There’s a way to return!?Zhou Wen was overjoyed.
