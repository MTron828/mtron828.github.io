Chapter 994: True Tyrant Behemoth

Translator: CKtalon

“Isn’t it the same?” Li Xuan said.

“Of course it’s different. Figurines aren’t toys for children, but works of art,” the boy explained seriously.

“I don’t see any difference. It’s just a doll.” Li Xuan looked around and couldn’t tell what was different about this Tyrant Behemoth doll. It just looked more exquisite.

The boy said angrily, “Not at all. If you don’t understand, don’t spout nonsense. This is a great work.”

Li Xuan looked inside the shop and curled his lips. “If it’s really a great work, why isn’t there a single customer in the shop other than you?”

“Let me see... Wow... Such a tiny doll is actually sold for more than a hundred thousand. It’s no wonder no one wants to buy it. After all, a doll is only a doll. It’s so expensive. Which kid would spend so much money to buy a doll? With so much money, it’s enough to buy a very good Legendary Companion Egg.” Li Xuan was bored and wanted to tease the boy.

The boy immediately said, “That’s not the case. Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui used to sell very well, but... but...”

“But what?” Li Xuan pressed.

“However, those people are too superficial. They feel that Guardians are stronger than Tyrant Behemoth, so they went to buy Guardian figurines,” the boy said sadly.

“Is this shop yours?” Zhou Wen looked at the Companion Beast models placed in the shop. It sold several Companion Beast models which topped the rankings last time, but most of them were Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui.

Other Companion Beast models typically only had two or three types, but there were many different versions of Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui. There was a huge difference in sizes and models.

There were replicas, cartoon versions, cute versions, and ferocious versions. There was a huge difference in size. The biggest Tyrant Behemoth was on the shop’s display booth. It was more than four meters tall and looked very similar to Tyrant Behemoth when it wasn’t huge. It was a one-to-one replica.

Zhou Wen really didn’t know that Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui were so popular.

“Yes.” The boy nodded.

“Since Guardians are popular, why don’t you sell Guardians? Is there a problem with the supply?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

The boy shook his head and said, “The figurines are made by our own factory. It’s very easy to create a Guardian figurine, but I don’t like it. I don’t want to sell the figurines of those Guardians.”

“Why? Did a Guardian bully you?” Li Xuan asked with interest.

“I sold these Companion Beasts because they are partners who fight for humans, but those Guardians aren’t. I heard from Mommy that those Guardians fight to enslave Earth and us humans. No matter how powerful they are, I won’t sell their figurines, much less make them,” the boy said with a serious expression.

When Zhou Wen and Li Xuan heard that, they knew that the boy’s background wasn’t simple. For him to know this information, it meant that his father wasn’t an ordinary person.

“Others are selling them, but if you don’t sell, there won’t be any business. Then, can this shop continue operating?” Li Xuan said. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Anyway, the shop belongs to my family. At most, it won’t be sold. It’s not a big deal. Besides, I believe that Tyrant Behemoth, Tai Sui, and company will definitely showcase their powerful strength on the rankings. When that happens, those superficial fellows will know that Companion Beasts aren’t inferior to Guardians at all. They can even be stronger,” the boy said.

This time, Li Xuan didn’t strike a blow at him. He knew that the chances of a Companion Beast appearing alone were very low. It could only appear in a Guardian battle coupled with another Guardian.

However, seeing how stubborn and serious the boy was, even Li Xuan couldn’t bear to tell him the truth.

“Little Yi, we should return,” a middle-aged man walked in and said to the boy.

However, when he saw Zhou Wen’s appearance, he said in surprise, “You are Zhou Wen?”

When the boy heard Zhou Wen, he was first taken aback before his eyes widened. He looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement and asked, “Your name is Zhou Wen too?”

“Yes, my name is Zhou Wen.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.

The middle-aged man said, “What do you mean by Zhou Wen too? He’s Tyrant Behemoth’s owner, Zhou Wen.”

After the boy heard that, he asked in disbelief, “You... Are you really Tyrant Behemoth’s master?”

“If there’s no second Tyrant Behemoth, I think I should be the one you are referring to,” Zhou Wen said.

“You... You... Are you really... Is Tyrant Behemoth alright? No, that’s not what I meant. It’s great to be able to see you... My name is Li Benyi. I really like you and your Tyrant Behemoth...” The boy immediately became nervous as he spoke incoherently.

“Do you want to see the real Tyrant Behemoth?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.

“Can... I?” Li Benyi’s voice trembled with excitement.

“Of course.” Zhou Wen looked at the space here. The exhibition hall was very high and was more than enough to accommodate Tyrant Behemoth. He summoned Tyrant Behemoth.

“Wow... It’s really Tyrant Behemoth. It’s so cool. It’s even cooler than what I saw in the video. Our figurines aren’t good enough...” Li Benyi looked at Zhou Wen with a look of longing.” Can I touch it? ”

“Of course. If you are willing, I can let it take you around,” Zhou Wen said.

“Yes... Yes... Of course I’m willing... Thank you so much.” Li Benyi immediately jumped up excitedly.

Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to extend its hand and lift Li Benyi up. It placed him on its shoulder and carried him around the shop.

“How cool. When I grow up, I’ll also want to have such a Companion Beast.” Li Benyi stroked Tyrant Behemoth’s hair and wore a blissful expression.

“Sorry to trouble you,” the middle-aged man said to Zhou Wen.

“It’s nothing. It’s rare for someone to like my Companion Beast so much.” Zhou Wen looked at the symbol on the middle-aged man’s clothes and asked, “Are you from the Ultimate Family Clan?”

The middle-aged man nodded. “Yes. I was in charge of picking you up, but something happened on my end and someone else took my place. I didn’t expect us to be so fated to meet here. My name is Li Benyu.”

Zhou Wen chatted with Li Benyu for a while before realizing that he was considered a collateral relative of the Ultimate Family Clan. He didn’t have the bloodline of the Ultimate Family Clan, but he was invited to join because he was valued by the Ultimate Family Clan in certain aspects.

Li Benyu was from the East District, but his wife had the pure bloodline of the Ultimate Family Clan. Li Benyi was a mixed-blood.

“Thank you. I’ve completed one of my two dreams. Now, I’m only left with seeing Tai Sui with my own eyes.” When Tyrant Behemoth brought Li Benyi back, he still looked unsatisfied. He didn’t want to let go of Tyrant Behemoth’s fingers as he thanked Zhou Wen.
