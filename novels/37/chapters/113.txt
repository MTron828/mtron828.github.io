Chapter 114 Gym Training

Inside an office, Qiao Siyuan stood respectfully in front of his desk with his head lowered, wearing a humble look.

“Have you found the thing I asked you to find?” A man sat behind his desk. As the only light in the office was the table lamp, the man’s face couldn’t be seen clearly. Only a blurry silhouette could be seen.

“Sir, apart from the An family, I’ve searched everywhere I can. I didn’t find the thing you were talking about.” Qiao Siyuan lowered his head and replied cautiously.

“Why didn’t you go to the An family?” the man asked indifferently.

“We had sent people to infiltrate them, but Ouyang Lan keeps the An family tightly under wraps. The people we sent didn’t have the chance of getting close to where Ouyang Lan and the rest live. They were only able to do miscellaneous chores in the yard.” After a pause, Qiao Siyuan continued, “In the name of pursuing Jing Daoxian, I had tried using Liz to test the An family’s attitude. An Tianzuo was very unyielding, and he didn’t care about the Senator by maiming Liz’s energy sea. It’s not simple to enter the An family to search for it.”

“If everything is that easily solved, what do I need you for?” the man coldly asked.

“Yes, sir. You’re right. I will think of another solution.” Qiao Siyuan bowed slightly before continuing, “Sir, I don’t think Professor Ouyang left the thing at the An family home.”

“Why do you say that?” The man sitting behind the light lit up a cigarette with an old lighter.

“According to my investigations, Professor Ouyang may be close friends with the An family, but he did not agree to Ouyang Lan’s marriage into the An family. Because of this matter, they had a falling out. Since then, he hasn’t entered the An family home and wasn’t even present when An Tianzuo and An Jing were born.”

Seeing no response from the man, Qiao Siyuan continued, “It’s also because after that person’s death in the An family that Professor Ouyang and Ouyang Lan’s relationship improved. However, he’s only visited the An family a few times and never stays there for more than an hour, much less stay overnight. With Professor Ouyang’s relationship with the An family, I don’t think he will leave something so important there.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Then, where would Ouyang hide the thing?” the man flicked away some cigarette ash before asking

“Sir, do you think Professor Ouyang could have taken it with him?” Qiao Siyuan probed.

“Impossible. That thing can’t enter dimensional zones or it will only spell trouble. Ouyang often needs to enter dimensional zones, so he won’t be so stupid. He must have hidden it somewhere.” The man paused before saying, “Regardless, you must find the thing at all costs. Do not dismiss the An family’s residence. Who knows if their poor relationship was just an act Ouyang deliberately created.”

“Yes, sir.” Qiao Siyuan bowed.

“We don’t have much time left. We need to retrieve it as soon as possible. Those ignorant fools outside think that time can be squandered, but they have no idea that the disaster is already hanging above their necks like a guillotine blade. It can fall at any time. Once the dimensional zones’ restrictions are gone, humanity will usher in the apocalypse. Therefore, we need to have that item in our hands to prevent that from happening,” the man said.

“Sir, is that thing really that important?” Qiao Siyuan asked the question on his mind.

“Back when humanity entered the Holy Land, there weren’t just six heroes. In fact, there were a lot more, but most of them ended up dying inside, their names unknown to people. Besides the six heroes, some also left the Holy Land alive and brought certain things out. Jing Daoxian was one of them. Likewise for Ouyang. The thing he has was something I saw him take out the Holy Land with my own eyes. It is of grave importance. We need to gain control of it,” the man said.

“Sir, I think there’s a coincidence over a matter, but I’m not sure if it’s problem,” Qiao Siyuan said after some thought.

“Speak.”

“Back when Jing Daoxian was seriously injured and under our pursuit, he actually stayed in Guide City for nearly ten minutes,” Qiao Siyuan said.

“You’ve already written this in the report. It’s related to that youth named Zhou Wen, right?”

“That’s right. Later on, I investigated Zhou Wen in detail. Other than being Zhou Lingfeng’s son, he has a rather good relationship with Professor Ouyang. When Professor Ouyang was principal at Guide City, he often invited Zhou Wen to eat at his placea treatment that other students and even teachers didn’t receive. Now, Ouyang Lan has married Zhou Lingfeng. I just find it too much of a coincidence. I’m thinking of the possibility that Professor Ouyang gave the item to Zhou Wen or Zhou Lingfeng.”

“Impossible. The power of that thing isn’t something a Mortal-stage can withstand. It’s impossible to even hold it. You can continue investigating Zhou Wen, but you have to place your focus on the An family. The only ones with the capability to commandeer that item in the An family are An Tianzuo and Ouyang Lan.”

“Yes, I understand.”

Feng Qiuyan wasn’t in a good mood. He originally thought that he would definitely be first in class for the homework mission, but he never expected Wang Lu to be faster than him by nearly a second.

As expected of Wang Lu. She already has such power even before advancing to the Legendary stage. After Feng Qiuyan saw Wang Lu’s video for the homework mission, he realized that he had lost fair and square. Wang Lu’s comprehension and control over her positioning had reached an extremely high level. This was something that he lacked.

After Wang Lu advances to the Legendary stage, I will definitely fight her. Before that, I still need to train myself and make myself stronger. Feng Qiuyan quickly walked to the school gym.

Feng Qiuyan believed that he had to be focused on everything he did. Quality was demanded for everything, so he only practiced his saber techniques. He hoped to make his saber techniques faster and stronger, allowing him to reach the peak of the world.

Hence, after arriving at the gym, Feng Qiuyan immediately walked towards the training court where the ball launcher was. It was the most suitable machine for him to practice his saber’s

speed.

However, when Feng Qiuyan got to the ball launcher court, he frowned when he realized that someone was occupying the grounds in practice.

On careful look, he realized that the person was someone he knew—the freshman who had killed the word-engraved Demonized General, Zhou Wen.

There was only one ball launcher, so Feng Qiuyan didn’t wish to waste any time waiting. Therefore, after some thought, he walked straight into the court and picked up a rubber training saber from the rack before walking towards Zhou Wen.
