Chapter 759: Wang Chan

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen was about to cry when Wang Chan gestured for him to keep quiet before quickly hiding under the bed. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Soon, an old woman walked in and looked into the room. She didn’t see Wang Chan, so she said to Zhou Wen that she was sorry for disturbing him before closing the door.

Only then did Wang Chan crawl out from under the bed and swat away the dust on her body. She then picked up the phone beside the pillow and handed it to Zhou Wen. “Sorry, who are you? Why are you lying here?”

Zhou Wen took the phone and said, “My name is Zhou Wen. I’m Wang Lu’s classmate.”

“Oh, you’re that Numbskull Wen? I heard my sister mention you before,” Wang Chan said in enlightenment.

“What Numbskull Wen?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback, but he knew that Wang Chan was Wang Lu’s younger sister. He just didn’t know if she was his biological sister or his cousin.

Wang Chan didn’t answer. She only sized him up curiously and said, “Why are you so heavily injured? Why don’t I help you heal?”

“Actually, it’s just a superficial wound. With the life pixie’s treatment, I’ll be fine in a few days,” Zhou Wen said.

Wang Chan curled her lips and said, “Life pixie’s healing effects are too poor. I have better Companion Beasts here that can quickly heal your injuries. Since you are my sister’s friend, you are also my friend. It’s only right that I help you. You don’t have to stand on ceremony.”

With that said, Wang Chan summoned a Companion Beast. It looked very strange. No matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, it looked like a syringe with wings.

Although the syringe had cute little wings and was pink in color, similar to Cupid’s Arrow of Love, it was a syringe. Zhou Wen, who had been seriously ill when he was young, often had injections. He just couldn’t bring himself to love something like a syringe.

“This... There’s no need...” Zhou Wen couldn’t bear to reject Wang Chan’s kindness, but he didn’t wish to be injected.

“Don’t stand on ceremony with me. You will recover quickly,” Wang Chan said as she ordered the syringe to fly down and stab Zhou Wen in the arm.

The liquid in the syringe was injected.

This syringe Companion Beast looked rather intelligent. It was actually able to accurately inject intravenously.

Zhou Wen felt heat enter his blood vessels. It was warm and didn’t hurt much. Furthermore, when the medicinal essence spread within his blood, Zhou Wen immediately felt energized and even felt his blood boil.

“Little Chan... Where are you... We are going back...” At that moment, a woman’s voice sounded from outside the wall. When Little Chan heard the voice, her expression changed slightly. She turned her head and said to Zhou Wen, “My mom is looking for me. I’ll come and see you tomorrow. Goodbye, Numbskull Wen.”

With that said, Wang Chan ran out without waiting for Zhou Wen’s reply.

She already has a Companion Beast at such a young age. Wang Lu’s sister’s talent isn’t bad. She’s quite kind. Zhou Wen felt his vitality surge as his injuries seemed to heal much faster.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to continue gaming, he felt something amiss. He felt his body heat up as though there was a furnace in his body.

It’s so hot... It’s so hot... Not long after, Zhou Wen felt like he was about to die. He tore open the gauze on his body, allowing the heat in his body to emit.

Even so, he still felt uncomfortable. It was as though there was a force pushing him, making him involuntarily move.

He first ran, but he realized that running vented too little heat. Zhou Wen sprawled on the ground to do push-ups. It was as though he had installed an electric motor as his body rapidly rose and fell while he emitted hot air.

The heat was really helpful to Zhou Wen’s injuries, accelerating the healing of his wounds. However, Zhou Wen’s crazy exercise ruptured his wounds again.

When Zhou Wen finally stopped, he realized that not only had his injuries not healed, but some areas that had already healed had ruptured.

What Companion Beast is that? Why are its effects so domineering? Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless.

Although Wang Chan’s Companion Beast had a healing effect and the effects were very good, he couldn’t withstand the heat and had crazily exercised, resulting in the opposite effect.

After lying in bed again, Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to get someone to wrap him in gauze. He got the life pixie to treat his injuries as he lay in bed gaming.

The blood-colored avatar entered the underground sea and opened the door to the war wagon. He saw the white cocoon floating in the void.

Zhou Wen held the Golden Overlord Sword and activated the Sigh of the King. He waited for the Sigh of the King to reach a certain intensity before activating Slaughterer and striking with Immortal Slaying.

The blood-colored avatar’s body trembled because the Sigh of the King’s strength was just too powerful. It caused the blood-colored avatar’s body to crack as blood seeped out.

This level of strength was still insufficient to activate Slaughterer. When the blood-colored avatar’s body was about to collapse, Slaughterer was finally activated. Zhou Wen held the Golden Overlord Sword and activated Immortal Slaying as he slashed at the white cocoon.

The void was cleaved apart as spatial powers were unable to withstand the power of Immortal Slaying. The white cocoon was split open almost instantly, revealing the Guardian inside.

This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen the Guardian’s full appearance. It was somewhat different from what he had imagined. The Guardian inside the cocoon wasn’t a dragon. It looked more like an ancient emperor.

Dressed in an imperial robe with a crown on his head, a hand extended out. It had six fingers, and each finger wore a ring.

Immediately, the six rings emitted intense spatial fluctuations as one hand reached towards the Golden Overlord Sword.

Crack!

Wherever the Golden Overlord Sword passed, the Guardian’s arm was severed. Blood splattered as the spatial power failed to change the trajectory of Immortal Slaying.

At first, Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw the Guardian extend its other hand. It also had six fingers and wore six rings. With a smack of its hand, it destroyed the blood-colored avatar that had entered a weakened state after using Immortal Slaying. The game screen went black.

From the looks of it, Immortal Slaying is still useful against Guardians. However, next time, I should directly sever the Guardian’s neck. Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive and entered the game again.

Soon, Zhou Wen realized that although the Immortal Slaying strike could tie with the Guardian, he lacked the ability to fight after a miss since it drained him of all his combat strength. As for the Guardian, it had very powerful spatial powers. It was clearly very difficult to kill him with one strike. Zhou Wen tried a few times, but he could only injure him, not kill him.

The power of Immortal Slaying deals damage over time. If I can guarantee that the blood-colored avatar won’t be killed by the counter attack, the Guardian might die if I wait a little longer. Zhou Wen continued his attempts.

He realized that this was similarly difficult to do. This was because, after the Immortal Slaying strike, the blood-colored avatar’s body would be almost at its limits. It had no combat ability at all. It was impossible for it to escape in front of a Guardian who was proficient in spatial powers.

My level is still too low. If I were also at the Mythical stage, killing this Guardian with one strike wouldn’t be a problem. Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss.
