Chapter 1277: Reappearance of the Dead Man Tree

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen felt his body emptied. Despite having so much external power supplementing him, using the Immortal Culling Sword still placed quite an immense burden on him.

Thankfully, it only weakened him a little—a lot better than previously. It didn’t injure his body and didn’t pose much of a hindrance. With the circulation of the Dao Sutra, Essence Energy surged endlessly and he recovered significantly.

He flew into the rift with the Immortal Culling Sword in hand. Although it was unlikely that a creature that had been slashed by the Immortal Culling Sword would survive, Zhou Wen still wanted to confirm it with his own eyes. It was best if he could deliver another strike or two to nip the possibility of the woman’s survival.

Zhou Wen flew down the rift and saw the woman’s severed body. She had lost her life.

The reason why the Immortal Culling Sword was terrifying wasn’t just because it was powerful. The creatures it killed had a very low chance of survival even if they had powerful self-healing or revival abilities.

Otherwise, how could it cull immortals? Those immortals had the Art of Longevity, so self-healing wasn’t difficult for them.

However, to Zhou Wen’s surprise, although there was zero vitality in the woman’s body, her head continued emitting life force. Her soul hadn’t been wiped away by the Immortal Culling Sword’s power.

Zhou Wen clearly saw the woman’s eyes widen. On her forehead was a tiny red lipstick mark.

The lipstick mark was very cute. It should have come from a child and not an adult. At that moment, the lipstick mark shimmered with a strange glow. It actually resisted the power of the Immortal Culling Sword, allowing the woman to cling on to survival.

Her body had already begun to decay, but her head remained alive. Her head flew up in a bid to escape.

Unfortunately, with only her head left, she was clearly no longer as powerful as a Calamity-grade existence. Her speed was even slower. With Transcendent Flying Immortal, Zhou Wen slashed at the woman’s head with his sheathed Immortal Culling Sword, slashing it to the ground.

Unfortunately, the unsheathed Immortal Slaying Sword was only equivalent to a hard metal pole. Zhou Wen’s full-powered strike failed to shatter the woman’s head.

The head landed on the ground, shattering a large area of the rocky ground and sinking into the rocks.

Due to Zhou Wen’s strike, the lipstick mark on her forehead became incomplete. The light on it gradually dimmed as her head’s life force weakened. The flesh on her neck had already begun to decay.

What’s the origin of that lipstick mark? It can actually withstand the power of the Immortal Culling Sword??Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised, but now wasn’t the time to think about that. He wanted the woman completely dead to prevent any future trouble.

The woman seemed to know that she was doomed. She shouted at Zhou Wen sternly, “No matter who you are, no matter where you are, you are doomed. No matter where you hide—be it the sky, the ground, or the endless universe—Mistress will avenge me and smite you down to endless hell, never to reincarnate… Lowly human… You will soon know… What true horror means…”

Following the woman’s sharp cry, a strong holy light suddenly erupted from her head and exploded. The shockwave instantly obliterated everything around her.

The intense light made the image transmitted by the satellite turn white—nothing could be seen. The light continued without any reduction, as though it was eternal holy brilliance.

Zhou Wen instant transmitted away and wasn’t affected by the self-destruction. Although he was still enveloped by the light, the power of the light couldn’t injure the Prisoned Dragon armor at such a distance.

However, Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. With the woman’s strength, she was an extremely powerful existence even in the dimension.

However, from her tone, she was only a slave. Then, how powerful was her mistress?

Apocalypse level??Zhou Wen guessed inwardly.?But so what if it’s at the Apocalypse level? The Apocalypse powerhouses of the dimension wouldn’t dare enter Earth personally.

Zhou Wen thought of the metal flower and instant transmitted nearby, hoping to see if it was completely dead. If it wasn’t completely dead, he could take the opportunity to deliver the killing blow. Perhaps a dimensional crystal would drop.

It would be awesome if a Companion Egg dropped. He still didn’t have a Calamity-grade Companion Beast.

When he arrived at the flower, he saw that the metal flower’s roots were almost completely severed. Its leaves had also been chopped off, leaving only its stem and flower on the ground. The metallic luster had become very faint. It didn’t look like it would survive.

Seeing the metal flower in such a state, he didn’t even need to deliver the killing blow. Just as he was about to pick up a petal to see if it was of any use, he suddenly felt the mysterious phone vibrate as though it wanted to come out.

Could it be…?Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he scanned the area with his consciousness. He didn’t discover any other creatures nearby, and due to the holy brilliance’s existence, he couldn’t see anything beyond. He took out his phone and took a look. Indeed, the Dead Man Tree automatically appeared and took a shot of the metal flower.

The metal flower’s corpse and countless roots instantly vanished. An additional flower bud appeared on the Dead Man Tree.

Strange, hasn’t the Dead Man Tree always absorbed special humans? Why would it absorb this metal flower??Zhou Wen felt increasingly puzzled.

However, it was ultimately a good thing. Without staying any longer, Zhou Wen teleported back to Earth.

The people watching the livestream had only seen a blazing white color all this while. The Venusian temperatures were already very high, but the temperature on the battlefield was even higher. The blazing white color made it appear like a huge white lake of holy flames. It burned without end and would continue for decades without extinguishing.

From space, it looked like a glowing white eye. People in the future called the lake of holy flames on Venus the Eye of Human Sovereign to commemorate the battle.

…

At the instant the woman’s head exploded, the red lipstick mark vanished as a stream of light.

In an ancient castle somewhere in the universe, a blonde girl was lying in a crystal coffin. She was wearing white dress-type pajamas and her face was ruddy. She looked like she was sleeping.

Suddenly, red lips appeared on the crystal coffin’s lid. The girl was jolted awake. When she saw the red lipstick mark on the crystal coffin lid, her eyes immediately revealed a sad expression.

“Yana’s dead?” The girl pushed away the crystal coffin lid. The red lipstick mark automatically flew in and landed on her lips. The girl bit her lip as her eyes gradually became firm, as though she had made a major decision.

A giant, who was more than ten meters tall and wearing a servant uniform, came in front of the crystal coffin and knelt down. His face approached the crystal coffin as he asked softly, “Mistress, why are you up?”

“Yana’s dead,” the little girl said sadly.

“Which Yana? Oh, I remember now. It’s that dishonest maidservant. She’s already been exiled.. So what if she’s dead? It’s not worth your concern, Mistress,” the giant manservant said indifferently.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
