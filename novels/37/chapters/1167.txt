Chapter 1168: Shinra Temple

“Going anywhere is fine,” Tsukuyomi suddenly said to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen found it reasonable. With a Calamity-grade bigshot like Tsukuyomi with him, there was no danger to speak of no matter which route they took.

Furthermore, there was the antelope of unknown level beside him. With such a powerful lineup, it would be difficult for anything to happen.

However, Zhou Wen’s character was different. He felt that the resolution of anything with force was the last resort. He had a nagging feeling that there was no way to resolve the problem with force. Once he failed, there was no way out. He didn’t like that feeling.

Today was somewhat different. Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to waste. He had to find Li Xuan as quickly as possible before taking him to Netherworld City.

“Let’s head over there to take a look.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and finally chose the direction that Unkilling Dugu had mentioned.

Zhou Wen chose to head in this direction not because he believed Unkilling Dugu, but because in theory, if they were telling the truth, it either meant that the black-robed man was luring them to their deaths, while Unkilling Dugu only wanted to obtain strength. The latter was relatively less dangerous. In both cases, he would be tricked, but the latter was clearly safer.

“Zhou Wen, if he enters the Shinra Temple, the consequences will be unimaginable,” the black-robed man said with a heavy expression. He knew that he couldn’t stop Zhou Wen, so he could only continue, “If you have to go, it’s best you imprison Unkilling Dugu.”

“There’s no need. Let’s go.” Zhou Wen shook his head. He had his own thoughts, so there was no need to imprison Unkilling Dugu.

“Let’s leave quickly. I hope we can still save Second Master and the rest.” Unkilling Dugu rode his bird and flew in the direction he had chosen.

“Zhou Wen, do you know what you’ve done?” the black-robed man asked with a frown.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he got Chick to speed up and followed behind Unkilling Dugu.

The black-robed man followed. Although he knew that he couldn’t stop Zhou Wen, it was impossible for him to do nothing. All he could do was wait for an opportunity.

Under Unkilling Dugu’s lead, the group flew through the sea of clouds, passing through various mountain peaks and palaces.

Some palaces were just illusions. They could directly pass through the palaces, but some palaces and mountains that looked like phantoms turned corporeal moments later. It looked magical and strange.

On many mountain peaks, the figures of dimensional creatures could be seen. However, in the illusory mountain peaks, the dimensional creatures couldn’t rush out. The corporeal mountain peaks were circled by Unkilling Dugu. Clearly, he didn’t wish to waste time.

After flying for more than an hour, the man in black, who had been silently following behind, suddenly said, “Shinra Temple is ahead. Now is the time. If we let him rush in, it will be too late to stop him.”

“What’s inside Shinra Temple?” Zhou Wen asked. He felt that even if the black-robed man wasn’t lying, he had to be hiding something.

A palace appeared in the sea of clouds in front of him. Unlike the other palaces, this palace was inverted at the end of the sky above.

There were many mountain peaks hanging down from the sky in Myriad Elephant Valley, but there was only one inverted palace. Regardless of whether this palace was Shinra Temple, it was an extraordinary place.

At this point, seeing that Unkilling Dugu was gradually approaching the palace, the black-robed man hesitated for a moment before saying, “I don’t know much. I only know that there’s a person trapped in Shinra Temple.”

“A person?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

“A member of our Dugu family. Furthermore, he’s someone we can’t let Unkilling Dugu meet. This is what the Patriarch said. There’s definitely no mistake.” The black-robed man looked at Unkilling Dugu and continued, “It’s not too late to stop him now. Don’t let him in.”

Zhou Wen said to Unkilling Dugu, “The palace ahead isn’t Boundless Mountain, right? There’s no need to approach it. Let’s circle around it.”

“Alright.” Unkilling Dugu agreed verbally, but he didn’t change his direction. He continued charging towards the inverted palace.

At this moment, it was obvious that Unkilling Dugu had been lying. His goal was the palace.

Chick let out a long cry and spewed out golden flames at Unkilling Dugu.

Although Chick now looked like an eagle, it actually had a phoenix bloodline. It spewed out phoenix flames and Unkilling Dugu and his Companion Beast were swept into the terrifying golden flames.

The Mythical Companion Beast was burned to ashes. Even Unkilling Dugu was aflame and on the brink of turning to ashes.

Even so, Unkilling Dugu didn’t die. With his body burning with phoenix flames, he suddenly sped up and transformed into a stream of light that rushed towards the inverted palace.

He can still live despite being burned to such a state. His ability is almost comparable to Li Xuan’s. Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi. With a Calamity like Tsukuyomi around, it was impossible for Unkilling Dugu to charge into the Shinra Temple.

However, to his surprise, Tsukuyomi had no intention of attacking at all. She only stood there and watched as the charred Unkilling Dugu tore through the door and rushed into the Shinra Temple.

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, but he wasn’t too surprised. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“It’s over.” The black-robed man sighed. Although he wanted to stop it, the speed that Unkilling Dugu had displayed at the end was something he couldn’t stop.

However, the black-robed man also knew that it wasn’t the time to blame Zhou Wen. Solving the problem was the priority.

“Zhou Wen, I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble you to stop Unkilling Dugu later. You can’t let him leave Myriad Elephant Valley. After the grand ceremony ends, our Dugu family will rush over to provide support. We are still about an hour away before the grand ceremony ends and Boundless Mountain materializes. I hope we can hold on until then,” the black-robed man said.

“Don’t worry. I’ll naturally answer for the trouble I’ve caused,” Zhou Wen said.

The man in black shook his head and smiled bitterly. He thought to himself, You have no idea how big the trouble you have stirred up.

However, since Zhou Wen was willing to stay behind to help, he didn’t harp on the matter. He continued, “I don’t know what kind of power Unkilling Dugu will obtain inside. You mustn’t be careless. Prepare for the worst. If you have any means to deal with it, it’s best you prepare immediately.”

Zhou Wen nodded but didn’t do anything. All he did was look at Shinra Temple.

Shinra Temple was pitch-black like ink. There were no signs of bricks at all, as though it was carved from a complete boulder. The appearance of the palace was ancient. It was only one floor, and it was squarish. It was somewhat different from ordinary rectangular palaces.

However, this palace had no signs or plaques. He didn’t know why it was called Shinra Temple.

“Why is this place called Shinra Temple?” Zhou Wen asked the black-robed man.

“This is the center of Myriad Elephant Valley, the core of everything. That’s why we call it Shinra Temple. If you want to ask me what’s inside, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed. I’ve already told you everything I know. I only know that there’s a terrifying creature trapped inside, and it’s a member of our Dugu family,” the black-robed man said helplessly.

As the two of them spoke, Tsukuyomi suddenly walked towards the entrance of Shinra Temple.
