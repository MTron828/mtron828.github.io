Chapter 1711 The Gate Found by Accident

After circling around Xicheng Mountain for so long, Zhou Wen finally saw the tiny palm symbol.

However, there was no entrance to the mountain at the spot where the tiny palm symbol was. There was a bare stone wall with a fist-sized depression on it. As the nearby mountain walls weren’t flat, the depression looked inconspicuous.

“Junior Brother, are you really not planning on entering the mountain? I think that although Teacher is a little strange, he wouldn’t scam us. Furthermore, the old fellow has already gone in to take a look. You know how sharp his eyes are. If he says that there’s no problem, I don’t think there will be a problem,” Liu Yun muttered.

Zhou Wen ignored him. He took out his phone and snapped the tiny palm symbol on the mountain wall with his back facing Liu Yun. His phone immediately displayed the download notification of the dungeon. “What’s so good about snapping this crappy mountain? Say something. Do you want to enter the mountain or not?” Liu Yun was extremely depressed. “Don’t you think this mountain wall is a little different?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the mountain wall.

If not for the tiny palm symbol, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have discovered anything amiss here. However, since the tiny palm symbol was engraved here, it didn’t make sense that there was nothing special around the mountain wall.

Therefore, after repeated observations, Zhou Wen realized that the mountain wall was somewhat special.

“What’s different?” Liu Yun was taken aback when he heard that. He couldn’t help but carefully size up the mountain wall. “The protrusions and depressions on this mountain wall are somewhat strange,” Zhou Wen said as he looked.

“What’s so strange about it? Why don’t I see any differences? The terrain here is just like that. It’s all natural. There aren’t any signs of artificial excavation.” Liu Yun was a little puzzled. He couldn’t tell what was wrong.

“If I’m not wrong, the protrusions and depressions here are arranged in a profound formation. They look irregular, but they contain great wisdom.” Ever since Zhou Wen watched the battle between Truth Listener and Starlady Polestar, he had a deeper understanding of the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. He knew a little about such stuff.

Although he didn’t know what the arrangement of the protrusions and depressions was called, some of them were very similar to the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. It wasn’t difficult to make an analogy.

“You know array formations?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.

“A little. Let me see. If I’m not wrong, there should be something else here,” Zhou Wen said as he reached out and pressed down on one of the protrusions.

However, nothing happened. He didn’t manage to sink the protruding stone, nor did anything happen nearby.

“Haha, Junior Brother, there’s no need to blush. It’s normal for humans to make mistakes. Don’t show off if you haven’t learned it well in the future...” He was very happy that he had finally found an opportunity to criticize Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen ignored him and pressed a few other protrusions and depressions.

“Junior Brother, array formations come from the Book of Changes. It’s a form of specialized knowledge. It’s not something that can be learned simply by browsing through. If you really want to learn it, I’ll recommend you to the Zhang family later. Their family is good at this...” Liu Yun was speaking happily when the smile on his face suddenly froze. After Zhou Wen finished tapping, he heard cracking sounds as a fissure suddenly opened in the mountain wall.

The hole wasn’t big, only slightly bigger than a dog hole. People could probably only crawl inside; it was impossible for ordinary people to stand up.

“Holy sh*t, there really is one. Could this be one of the nine gates of Kunlun? However, this entrance is too small. It’s very difficult for humans to enter. Can those creatures in Kunlun Mountain burrow out?” Liu Yun widened his eyes.

“I wonder if we can reach the place you mentioned by entering from here,” Zhou Wen said as he sized up the hole.

“I’m afraid no one knows about this mountain entrance. Who knows what will happen if we enter from here. Let’s not waste any time. If you want to enter, go through the gate I mentioned.” Liu Yun didn’t wish to take the risk. Kunlun Mountain wasn’t a place where one could take risks.

Zhou Wen didn’t plan on entering either. Like Liu Yun, he wasn’t willing to risk his life.

Since the mobile dungeon was already downloading, he could slowly explore it in-game in the future.

Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly heard a strange sound coming from the hole, as though something was rubbing two stones together.

What’s that sound? Zhou Wen sized up the cave entrance. It didn’t seem to be obstructed, but he could only see a meter or two. When he looked further in, he couldn’t see anything. All he felt was darkness.

Darkness wasn’t an obstacle to Zhou Wen’s vision. He could see everything clearly even if it was pitch black. It wasn’t as simple as being dark.

“It sounds like someone’s using sandpaper to grind rocks.” Liu Yun listened for a while before continuing, “That sound seems to be getting closer and closer to the hole. Could something be coming out?”

“What could it be? A break-out creature?” Zhou Wen was somewhat curious. After retreating and waiting for a period of time, he continued staring intently at the hole.

Liu Yun retreated even further than Zhou Wen. If something really came out of Kunlun Mountain, it would definitely be an extremely terrifying object.

The stronger the dimensional zones were, the harder it was for the dimensional creatures inside to break out. The thought of creatures that could break out of the Kunlun Mountain struck fear in him.

The grinding sounds coming from the cave grew louder and louder. Zhou Wen thought for a long time, but he couldn’t figure out what the sound was. He had never seen an animal make such a sound when crawling out.

No matter how hard he listened, it sounded like someone was grinding rocks. Not long after, the sound of grinding became even more intense. This time, it didn’t sound like it was grinding rocks. It sounded more like someone was cutting rocks.

The thin and sharp sound hurt one’s eardrums.

“From the commotion, I reckon a huge fellow is about to come out. Let’s not cause trouble. Quickly close the gate.” Liu Yun retreated a distance. If there was so much of a stir, he would probably be the first to escape. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Since it’s coming out, it won’t be too late to leave after seeing what it is,” Zhou Wen said as he retreated. The two of them hid behind a boulder in the distance and secretly looked in the direction of the cave entrance. Now, he was really curious about what would crawl out.

“Junior Brother, do you think an electric saw will crawl out?” Liu Yun looked nervous, but he didn’t stop talking.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he saw a blurry shadow appear in the cave, but he couldn’t clearly make it out. The thing in the cave seemed to have walked out of the thick fog. At first, he could only see its outline, but as he got closer and closer to the cave entrance, its appearance gradually became clearer.

“What’s this?” Finally, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun saw what the thing that crawled out of the cave looked like, but they still didn’t recognize it.
