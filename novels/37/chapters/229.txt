Chapter 230 Ghost King

“Let’s charge in.” Zhou Wen gritted his teeth when he saw the black-armored, white-haired ghost charging at them. He got up and charged towards the Yin Yang Boundary Stone.

With the Grand Yin Wind clearing the path, the red-dressed female ghosts were sent flying dozens of meters away.

Li Xuan and company also knew that facing the black-armored, white-haired ghost would only lead to death. Without any hesitation, they followed Zhou Wen past the Yin Yang Boundary Stone.

Despite the Grand Yin Wind sending many female ghosts flying dozens of meters away, there were just too many red-dressed female ghosts. Soon, more red-dressed female ghosts surrounded them.

Zhou Wen fanned again, blowing away the female ghost in front of him as he ran desperately inside with the trio.

Not long after the four of them ran in, the black-armored, white-haired ghost charged to the Yin Yang Boundary Stone. However, he didn’t hesitate like the white-robed ghosts and rushed straight in.

The moment he entered, the red-dressed female ghosts seemed to break into a frenzy. All of them began screaming as their hair stood on end. They charged at the black-armored, white-haired ghost fearlessly.

Zhou Wen and company were pleasantly surprised when they saw this.

“Holy sh*t, all hell’s breaking loose!” Li Xuan cried out in pleasant surprise.

However, their pleasant surprise didn’t last long. When the group of red-dressed female ghosts pounced at the black-armored, white-haired ghost, the black gas emitting from the latter suddenly blasted outwards, producing a shockwave. It instantly obliterated all the red-dressed female ghosts within a twenty-meter radius.

The black-armored, white-haired ghost ignored the red-dressed female ghosts and flew towards Zhou Wen and company.

The four of them felt their hearts turn cold. The black-armored, white-haired ghost could kill a group of red-dressed female ghosts without even laying his finger on them. Such strength was a calamity for them.

Although the red-dressed female ghosts continued charging forward fearlessly, they had no effect on the black-armored, white-haired ghost. Just a surge of his black gas evaporated and dissipated them, leaving only a few ghost crystals falling to the ground.

The four of them only managed to run for about a hundred meters before the black-armored, white-haired ghost caught up to them. He extended his ghastly claws and grabbed at Zhou Wen.

The black gas condensed into the shape of a ghastly claw and, despite being more than ten meters away, appeared in front of Zhou Wen instantly and was about to hoist him up.

Zhou Wen held the banana fan and fanned it at the black gaseous claw. The Grand Yin Wind swept over, blowing away all the black gas.

However, before Zhou Wen and company could rejoice, the black-armored, white-haired ghost released another claw. A gigantic ghastly hand, formed from black gases grabbed at Zhou Wen, its speed so fast that it was almost impossible to dodge.

The Grand Yin Wind had just been used and Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy had yet to recover. Unable to use it again, all he could do was pull out his Bamboo Blade and slash at the black gaseous claw.

Ghost Bride and Truth Listener attacked the black gaseous hand at the same time. The Yin Wind Claw and the golden beam of Truth Listener’s claws almost struck the black gaseous claw simultaneously.

Bam!

The black gaseous claw was shattered by the two pets, but Zhou Wen felt his hands go numb as his Primordial Energy was nearly drained.

“Run separately!” Zhou Wen could tell that he was the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s target. He immediately ran in another direction.

The black-armored, white-haired ghost indeed chased after him without any hesitation. The red-dressed female ghosts that approached him were dissipated as though he was a demon king in the flesh.

Zhou Wen felt worse than the black-armored white-haired ghost. By using the Great Yin Wind to rid the red-dressed female ghosts in front of him, there was no way to deal with his pursuer. Furthermore, the black-armored, white-haired ghost was obviously much faster than him. In a blink of an eye, he had caught up to him.

As though he knew that the black gaseous claw was useless against Zhou Wen, the black-armored, white-haired ghost grabbed at him with his hand. It was as fast as an illusion.

Zhou Wen switched his Primordial Energy Art to the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and used the Bamboo Blade to produce Transcendent Flying Immortal.

Instantly, the sky lit up as Zhou Wen’s speed suddenly increased. Like lightning, he slashed at the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s body.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Sounds of metal ringing sounded incessantly as the extremely sharp Bamboo Blade struck the black armor of the white-haired ghost. It was unknown what the armor was made of, but it looked like black jade. When the Bamboo Blade struck it, only white scuff marks were left behind, failing to split the armor apart.

The black-armored, white-haired ghost floated in the air, blocking Zhou Wen’s attack without even lifting his palm.

The instant Transcendent Flying Immortal ended, the black-armored, white-haired ghost extended his hand and instantly appeared in front of Zhou Wen, moments from grabbing his neck.

The difference in speed was too great, so Zhou Wen didn’t even have a chance to dodge.

Truth Listener appeared on Zhou Wen’s shoulder as a golden light flashed across its claws. It was as though it was wearing a mysterious hex seal as it moved towards the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s palm.

Bam!

Its palm was branded with a golden mark that made him retract his hand as if he had been pricked by a needle. As for Truth Listener, it was sent flying. It tumbled in the air a few times before landing on the head of a red-dressed female ghost. She was so frightened that she didn’t dare move.

Truth Listener didn’t look injured. After baring its teeth and crying out loud, it leaped up once again, rushing towards the black-armored, white-haired ghost.

The ghost shook his hand and immediately, the golden flame-like branding on his palm was drowned by the black gas. Then, he shot out a plume of black gas, immediately sending Truth Listener flying.

Truth Listener was only at the Legendary stage. Despite being struck by the black-armored, white-haired ghost twice, it remained unharmed. However, there was nothing it could do about the black-armored, white-haired ghost. Before it could reach him, it was sent flying by the hand formed by the black gas.

Zhou Wen felt a little depressed. If Truth Listener could advance to the Epic stage, it would probably be able to fight the black-armored, white-haired ghost or even suppress it. Now, it could only be trounced.

The black-armored, white-haired ghost seemed to know that Truth Listener was a nemesis of ghosts, making it difficult to kill. Therefore, he only sent Truth Listener flying before ignoring it. With his body phasing away, he appeared in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was already prepared as he fanned at him, sending the black-armored, white-haired ghost flying back more than a hundred feet. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, just as he retreated, the white-haired ghost’s figure blinked again. It was so fast that Zhou Wen had no time to recover his Primordial Energy.

It was already too late for Truth Listener and Banana Fairy to save him. Zhou Wen could only use Ghost Bride to ward off his assailant, but Ghost Bride appeared to be extremely afraid of the black-armored, white-haired ghost. She didn’t dare rush forward to help Zhou Wen ward off the disaster.

Zhou Wen immediately cursed inwardly. Typical Companion Beasts were absolutely obedient. They wouldn’t hesitate even if they were ordered to commit suicide.

Only a Mythical pet like Truth Listener and Banana Fairy had a certain level of self-awareness. He never expected Ghost Bride to have her own consciousness and even know fear.

However, with the Ghost Bride’s hesitation, Zhou Wen immediately fell into peril. He watched as the black-armored, white-haired ghost’s palm grabbed at his neck.
