Chapter 967: Seven Seas Dragon King

“Little Yanyan, you don’t have to be sad. Actually...” Li Xuan wanted to comfort Feng Qiuyan, but Feng Qiuyan didn’t show an expression that needed his comfort.

“What’s the other half of her bloodline?” Feng Qiuyan asked calmly.

“Sea God Reef’s Golden Dragon King bloodline,” Zhou Wen answered Feng Qiuyan.

“I see. My memories back then were indeed correct. I saw strange horns growing from her head and scales appearing on her body,” Feng Qiuyan muttered to himself.

“When I returned, I met Qin Ling. She told me to tell you that she has gone to Sea God Reef and will never return again.” Zhou Wen conveyed Qin Ling’s words to Feng Qiuyan.

“That’s good too.” Feng Qiuyan nodded slightly.

Zhou Wen then told Feng Qiuyan the full story about the Seven Seas Dragon King.

“What’s that Seven Seas Dragon King? I don’t care if it hoards the monsters in the sea, but it actually wants to target a human beauty. Damn it, I can’t tolerate it. Old Zhou, count me in if you want to take down that Seven Seas Dragon King,” Li Xuan said.

However, Feng Qiuyan didn’t say a word. He turned around and left the building, but he didn’t leave the Feng family residence.

“From the looks of it, Little Yanyan suffered quite a heavy blow,” Li Xuan said with a sigh.

“People have to suffer some blows to grow. It’s not a bad thing,” Zhou Wen said thoughtfully.

“I’m just afraid the blow is too great.” Li Xuan shook his head slightly.

“Don’t be sentimental here. Aren’t you going to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King? What are you waiting for? Go and prepare. We are about to set off,” Zhou Wen said.

“Are we really going?” Li Xuan asked with widened eyes.

“Didn’t you say that you couldn’t tolerate it?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“I was just responding to the mood back then. That’s an old Terror-grade monster. Didn’t you say that only a Terror-grade can kill a Terror-grade. The two of us aren’t at the Terror-grade. Wouldn’t we be sending ourselves to our deaths if we went?” Li Xuan said.

“Enough, we’re just going to deal with the other ordinary dragon monarchs. We aren’t going to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King.” Zhou Wen rolled his eyes at him.

The two of them left the Feng family residence and headed for the seaside again. When they arrived at the seaside, Li Xuan looked back and couldn’t help but feel slightly disappointed when he didn’t see Feng Qiuyan.

“Let’s go.” In an area without anyone else, Zhou Wen summoned Deep Blue Crab Sovereign and got Li Xuan to sit with him.

A gravity bubble appeared around the Deep Blue Crab Sovereign’s body. A hemispherical bubble was hooked onto its back, protecting Zhou Wen and company, preventing them from being hit by the seawater.

The Deep Blue Crab Sovereign wasn’t slow at all. It moved in water as though it was flying. Furthermore, it didn’t walk horizontally. It walked forward normally like a spider.

The first dimensional zone Zhou Wen planned on heading to was known as Undersea Blue Hole to humans. The sea surface appeared to be an extraordinary blue color. It was very different from the surrounding seawater, as though it was a blue hole.

In fact, the seawater there was the same color as the surrounding seawater. The difference was that there was a bottomless cave at the bottom of the sea.

As it was underwater and it was very difficult for humans to fight underwater for long periods of time, very few humans entered the Undersea Blue Hole.

According to Miya’s intelligence, there was a huge sea snake in the Undersea Blue Hole dimensional zone. The sea snake was extremely poisonous. As it had a sliver of a dragon’s bloodline, it also claimed to be a Sea Dragon King.

In the Undersea Blue Hole, there were a large number of poisonous sea snakes. The toxicity of these sea snakes was very intense. Once someone’s body was injured, the snake venom would enter their bodies through their wounds. It was doubtful many humans could withstand it. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Zhou Wen’s Poison stat was very high. Furthermore, he cultivated a Poison-type Essence Energy Skill, so he wasn’t afraid of poison.

Li Xuan had an indestructible body and with the carapace that had fused with Alpha, he probably could shrug off ordinary sea snakes. He only needed to be careful against the Sea Dragon King.

However, Zhou Wen had already learned of the Sea Dragon King’s weakness from Miya. He had brought Li Xuan here because he wanted to use his strength to safely finish off the Sea Dragon King.

Although Zhou Wen could handle it himself, it was relatively more troublesome without help. After all, reality wasn’t a game. Zhou Wen didn’t wish for any accidents to happen.

“In a while, after we enter the Undersea Blue Hole, leave the ordinary sea snakes to me. You don’t have to worry. When the Sea Dragon King comes out, I’ll hold it back. Then, you can release the Ice Silkworm and use it to lower its temperature.” Zhou Wen explained his plan to Li Xuan.

The Sea Dragon King didn’t have any natural enemies in the water. The only thing it was afraid of was the cold. If the temperature was too low, its body would turn stiff.

Zhou Wen didn’t have any Mythical ice-type pets, so he could only rely on Li Xuan’s Ice Silkworm.

When he arrived at the entrance of the Undersea Blue Hole, Zhou Wen looked around and couldn’t help but feel disappointed when he didn’t find the tiny palm symbol.

Quite a number of sea snakes had already appeared near the blue hole. These sea snakes looked rather odd. Their bodies were flat and looked similar to fish, but they were more than ten meters long.

Furthermore, their bodies were blue in color. It was difficult to discover them when they melded into the environment.

When the sea snakes approached, there was no need for Zhou Wen to do anything. The Crab Sovereign brandished its crab pincers and snipped the sea snakes into two. No sea snakes could approach them.

After entering the blue hole, a large number of sea snakes appeared in Zhou Wen and company’s line of sight. They watched as countless sea snakes twisted and squirmed in the seawater. The scene left them shuddering.

Crab Sovereign spewed out a large number of gravity bubbles. The moment the sea snakes encountered the gravity bubbles, they were sucked into them. Then, as though gravity had lost its effect on them, they floated in the bubbles, unable to rush out.

There were many sea snakes, but there were even more gravity bubbles. A large number of sea snakes were trapped by the gravity bubbles, unable to rush over.

Suddenly, a blue-scaled, nearly hundred-meter-long, strange sea snake with a horn on its head rushed out from the depths of the blue hole. Its eyes were filled with anger as it stared coldly and sinisterly at the Crab Sovereign.

“How ugly. That Seven Seas Dragon King sure is hardcore. To think that he can even lay his hands on a harem of this quality.” Li Xuan couldn’t help but criticize when he saw the Sea Dragon King’s appearance.

“They are dragons. They have different standards of beauty from us.” Zhou Wen watched the Sea Dragon King rush over and wasn’t in a rush to attack. All he did was order the Crab Sovereign to continue spewing out the gravity bubbles.

“Thankfully, Qin Ling isn’t this fellow’s sister,” Li Xuan said with a strange expression.

The Sea Dragon King was unbridled as his body tore through the gravity bubble. He opened his terrifying snake mouth and was about to swallow both the humans and crab.

The Crab Sovereign exerted all its strength as it raised its pincers and clamp down on its jawbone. However, the Sea Dragon King’s strength was just too great. It forcefully pressed down the Crab Sovereign’s pincers. The latter was no match for the Sea Dragon King.

Zhou Wen summoned Sword Pill which transformed into a stream of light that stabbed at the Sea Dragon King’s eyes. At the same time, he signaled Li Xuan with his eyes.

Without any hesitation, Li Xuan summoned the two Ice Silkworms. While the Sea Dragon King was distracted by the Sword Pill, the male and female Ice Silkworms landed on the Sea Dragon King’s body from both sides and attached to it like leeches.
