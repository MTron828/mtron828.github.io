Chapter 1342: An Tianzuo Isn’t the Only One

Human Sovereign’s power allowed Zhou Wen to use his powerful vitality to heal injuries. Apart from being unable to heal himself, ordinary injuries could be treated.

However, when Zhou Wen’s fist struck the antelope, he felt as though its body was a huge furnace. The moment his vitality entered, it was devoured without a trace.

Zhou Wen had never encountered such a situation. The antelope’s condition didn’t show any signs of improvement, but Zhou Wen felt his vitality severely drained. Human Sovereign’s brilliance was becoming weaker and weaker.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to feed the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence and other pills to the antelope before continuing to use the power of Human Sovereign to inject it into its body.

Seeing the pill essences enter the antelope’s mouth like candy, Zhou Wen’s heart ached so much that it was about to bleed. It was fine if it was the other pill essences, but the drop rate of the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence was too low. After grinding Pill Furnace Mountain for so long, he had only obtained one. He also fed the other Mythical pill essences, such as the Vital Dragon Pill, to the antelope.

It was unknown if it was because of the pills or Zhou Wen’s Human Sovereign powers, but the terrifying temperature in the antelope’s body decreased slightly.

Its convulsing body gradually calmed down.

“Stop beating me. With that tiny bit of vitality of yours, it won’t be of much use even if you send it all into my body.” The antelope regained consciousness and struggled to get up from the ground.

Zhou Wen’s hands were about to break from the punching. The Human Sovereign brilliance over him was almost gone, so he could only stop and decouple with Human Sovereign.

“Are you alright?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Let’s talk when we get back.” The antelope looked around and saw that they were still near Forbidden City.

Although Starlady Polestar was suppressed by the rules of Earth and shouldn’t dare to come out, this couldn’t be confirmed. It was better to stay away.

As the antelope’s injuries were too serious and Zhou Wen was exhausted from expending too much of his vitality, he decided to summon the Earth Elemental Beast and use Earth Escape to travel.

After leaving the capital, the antelope suddenly said to Zhou Wen, “Release Chick.”

Zhou Wen released Chick and Ya’er from the chaos space. Chick glanced at the antelope and automatically landed on its head.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that the antelope’s temperature was slowly decreasing. As for Chick, it was in high spirits. Its feathers seemed much brighter.

So Chick can absorb the heat from Antelope. It’s no wonder Antelope likes to bring Chick around.?Zhou Wen was enlightened.

“Ol’ Ante, I heard from Starlady Polestar that you have returned to your human form. Could it be that you were a human in the past?” Zhou Wen had questions that he couldn’t help himself from asking.

The antelope said lazily, “Not really.”

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen couldn’t understand what it meant. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, the antelope ignored him. It lay on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back as though it was asleep.

Since the antelope wasn’t willing to say anything, Zhou Wen had no choice but to swallow his questions and focus on driving the Earth Elemental Beast.

“Today’s matter is a little strange. It’s impossible for the Spirit Suppression Talisman to fall by itself. Under those circumstances, it’s impossible for Starlady Polestar to break free,” the antelope suddenly said with its eyes closed.

Zhou Wen nodded. “I know, but I was paying attention the entire time. I didn’t discover any other creatures nearby.”

The antelope didn’t say anything else and continued to rest with its eyes closed. It was unknown if it had fallen asleep.

If Zhou Wen could see it, he would discover a blonde girl standing on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back. Furthermore, she was behind him, less than an arm’s length away.

The golden-haired maiden was naturally Sweetie. She had thought that Starlady Polestar would be able to avenge Yana on her behalf, but who would’ve thought that they would still be able to come out alive?

Looks like I’ll have to avenge Yana myself, the blonde thought, but she didn’t attack immediately.

As the Earth Elemental Beast had been burrowing underground, if Zhou Wen touched her and turned into gold, the Earth Elemental Beast would naturally die as his Companion Beast.

When that happened, Ya’er and the others would be trapped underground. Sweetie was afraid of hurting her.

It won’t be too late to make a move after they return to the surface, Sweetie thought to herself as she continued to stand there and wait.

…

Ever since Zhou Wen helped Hui Haifeng’s people get on the rankings, many factions had secretly contacted the An family, hoping to get Zhou Wen to help them get on the rankings. They also wanted to figure out what ability Zhou Wen had used to dodge the Calamity-grade bullets.

From their point of view, Zhou Wen was a member of the An family. If they couldn’t contact Zhou Wen, they could contact An Tianzuo.

However, An Tianzuo had no say in Zhou Wen’s matters, nor could he offend all the factions. He could only stall for time, but it also gave An Tianzuo a headache.

“Overseer, the League of Guardians has also sent their men over. Although they didn’t say it explicitly, from what they said, they also want to know how Young Master Wen dodged the Calamity-grade bullets.” An Sheng pushed open the door and saw An Tianzuo leaning back in his chair with his hands massaging his temples.

“Overseer, are you alright?” An Sheng hurriedly asked.

“I’m fine.” An Tianzuo lowered his hand and frowned. “That fellow always causes trouble. He always does thankless things without considering the consequences.”

An Sheng explained with a whisper, “Overseer, this isn’t a bad thing. With Young Master Wen’s showcase, the various factions won’t dare touch our Luoyang easily. Even the people from the League of Guardians are polite this time. Their attitude is much better than before.”

“What’s the use of having a good superficial attitude? They yearn to kill him deep down,” An Tianzuo said with a cold snort.

An Sheng thought to himself,?If you want to talk about the people the League of Guardians wants to kill, you should be ranked ahead of Young Master Wen. Young Master Wen didn’t do anything to the League of Guardians, but you blew up their Skysplit Tower. Aren’t you still alive and well?

An Sheng naturally didn’t dare say that. He only whispered, “Overseer, you’re right. However, with Young Master Wen’s current strength, even Calamity-grade bullets can’t injure him. They are unlikely to rashly attack Young Master Wen.”

An Tianzuo clearly wasn’t fond of this topic. He didn’t continue the conversation with An Sheng and instead, picked up the document on the table to read it.

“Overseer, we have some clues about the situation in the Holy Land. According to what we know, many Saints like Xiao have appeared from the Holy Land. They are actively contacting the various factions. I wonder what they are up to,” An Sheng said.

“Capture one alive,” An Tianzuo said.

“We’ve tried, but we failed. After that saint was captured, he chose to commit suicide. He didn’t give us a chance to question him,” An Sheng said in distress.

“Did you find out how those saints entered and exited the Holy Land?” An Tianzuo asked again.

“We did. They also use teleportation nexuses, but for ordinary humans to enter through them, it’s still the same as before. There’s a level restriction. Even Mythical creatures can’t pass through, much less Terror-grade ones. However, those saints don’t have such restrictions. They can enter and exit from the teleportation array at will,” An Sheng said.

An Tianzuo pondered for a moment before suddenly looking at An Sheng and asking, “Does anyone else know about the saint’s suicide?”

An Sheng was alarmed when he heard that. “Overseer, don’t tell me you want to disguise yourself as that saint to gain entry into the Holy Land?”

“We can give it a try,” An Tianzuo said.

“Absolutely not. It’s too dangerous. Besides, what will happen to Luoyang if you leave?” An Sheng immediately objected.

“An Tianzuo isn’t the only one in Luoyang, right?” An Tianzuo said indifferently.
