Chapter 466 The Invisibility Cloak Is Stolen

What’s up with this fellow? He doesn’t seem to be even twenty years old? He should still be a student, right? How can he so easily kill the Fire Furnace Queen? Countless thoughts flashed through Lucas’s mind.

That sword’s beam is way too powerful, isn’t it? The Fire Furnace Queen is an extremely powerful existence even among Epic creatures. Yet, she couldn’t even withstand one strike. It must be because the sword is too powerful. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have such strength at such a young age. That’s not right! Only by advancing to the Epic stage can he incubate an Epic Companion Beast. That means he’s at least at the Epic stage...

Zhou Wen had already picked up the Fire Furnace Queen Companion Egg. It was still very useful. With powerful fire-elemental powers, she performed pretty well in many human fields.

"Young lad, you’re pretty strong. You’re almost on par with me. Have you graduated from college?" Lucas laughed as he walked forward and asked. He thought to himself, This fellow might only look young and rather young. In fact, he’s already quite old. He’s probably in his thirties like. Yes, that must be the case.

"Not yet. I’m still schooling," Zhou Wen answered.

Lucas froze when he heard that. He forced a smile and continued asking, "What year are you in?"

Lucas calculated inwardly. I advanced to the Epic stage at the age of twenty just as I graduated from university. The East District should be the same as our Peninsula of Gods. They are all about seventeen years old when they enter college. If he’s in his fourth year, he should be twenty. To advance to the Epic stage at the same age means the mighty Lucas didn’t lose.

"I’m a freshman," Zhou Wen said as he put away the Companion Egg.

"Did you attend university late?" Lucas found it unbelievable that Zhou Wen had advanced to the Epic stage at seventeen.

"No. I attended university at a normal age."

"Have you been retained?"

"No."

Lucas looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression. After some time, he wrapped his arm around Zhou Wen’s shoulder and said, "To have such achievements at such a young age, from the looks of it, you will be as great as Lucas in the future." Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Zhou Wen thought to himself that this person was really thick-skinned, but he wasn’t a bad person.

"Lucas, thank you for your hospitality today. It’s time we bid you farewell. If you have a chance of coming to the East District in the future, contact us," Zhou Wen said to Lucas.

"Where are you going? Anyway, it’s on the way. I’ll take you there." Lucas patted his Tyrannosaurus and thought to himself. Thankfully, I have such a domineering Companion Beast mount. This isn’t something that can be easily obtained. I spent a large sum of money to obtain it.

"Thank you for your kind intentions, but there’s no need. We can go back ourselves," An Sheng said as he summoned a mount.

When Lucas saw the mount, his eyes widened. It was also a Tyrannosaurus. Although it was about the same size as his Tyrannosaurus Rex, it was made of metal. It looked like a metal statue, not a living creature.

Is this an Epic Mutated Metal Tyrannosaurus? On the list of Companion Beasts released by the Federation, Lucas had seen the introduction of this Mutated Metal Tyrannosaurus. It was far stronger than the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

After Zhou Wen and An Sheng bade farewell, they left on the Mutated Metal Tyrannosaurus. After returning to his senses, he hurriedly uploaded the photo of the Flaming Furnace Queen’s corpse on the Internet. There was even a caption.

"Today, I hunted a very rare Fire Furnace Queen with my friends from the East District. Delightful!"

"Your mount isn’t bad. Where did you get it from?" Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the Mutated Metal Tyrannosaurus.

"I got it when I went to Dinosaur Island. There are dinosaurs everywhere there. If you’re interested, I’ll take you there in the future," An Sheng said with a smile.

"I think we should head to the nearby temples to take a look." Zhou Wen still wanted to visit the other temples to see if there were any tiny palm symbols. It was best if he could download more dungeons.

"Do you want to visit the other temples? Why not let The Great Lucas take you there. Otherwise, there are many dimensional zones in the Peninsula of Gods that don’t allow outsiders to enter." Lucas rode his Tyrannosaurus Rex and chased after them.

"How can we trouble you?" Zhou Wen asked.

"What’s there to be embarrassed about? We’re friends," Lucas said straightforwardly.

Lucas led them to the relatively famous dimensional zones on the Peninsula of Gods, such as the God of Light Apollo’s Music Temple.

It sounded a little odd, but the Olympian gods usually had multiple titles. Apollo was talented and took on many titles. The Music Temple was one of his many temples.

Zhou Wen found the tiny palm symbol outside the Music Temple and downloaded it.

After that, he went to the other temples, but Zhou Wen didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. He downloaded three dungeons that day.

The Metalwork Temple, Music Temple, and Curse Demon Palace.

The first dungeon Zhou Wen had downloaded was actually Curse Demon Palace. This surprised him. Athena was the Goddess of Wisdom, and in the legends, she was also the Goddess of War, but the word "curse" didn’t seem related to her. Furthermore, the word "Demon Palace" was clearly not something a god’s temple should have.

This made Zhou Wen realize that the temple didn’t belong to the Goddess of Wisdom. If the people on the Peninsula of Gods treated it as a temple of the Goddess of Wisdom, they would likely suffer a huge loss.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to visit a few more dimensional zones, but after receiving a phone call, Lucas hurriedly left, as though he had something urgent to attend to.

Zhou Wen and An Sheng had no choice but to return to the hotel. This was because the Zhang family had already left the Peninsula of Gods. They couldn’t hitch a ride on the plane back, so they could only fly back on Federation Airlines.

Just as they were about to book the air tickets, Zhou Wen received a call from Lucas.

"Dear friend, if a police officer requests you to assist in their investigations, don’t panic. It’s just assisting in the investigations. I’ll rush to the police station to testify for you," said Lucas without any head or tail.

"What happened? Why are we being taken by the police to assist in investigations?" A puzzled Zhou Wen asked.

Lucas said, "The Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg bought by Lord Irjarr for a large sum of money has been stolen. The thief has East District features. Therefore, every East District person in the Peninsula of Gods is being investigated. For now, they can’t leave the Peninsula of Gods. However, you don’t have to worry. When the Invisibility Cloak Companion Egg was stolen yesterday, you were always with The Great Lucas. I will be your witness."

"Thank you, Lucas," Zhou Wen thanked him sincerely. Although he wasn’t afraid of being investigated, it was indeed nice of Lucas to inform them in advance.
