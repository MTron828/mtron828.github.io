Chapter 1414: Tai Sui Symbol

Translator: CKtalon

Tai Sui’s ability can enhance skills and even Terror transformation abilities. Even Companion Beast equipment on me has been augmented. Under such circumstances, my Speed and Strength are comparable to a Calamity-grade. Can I use Tai Sui’s strength to kill the Venusian Calamity??Zhou Wen felt that he was really about to take off and soar.

With Tai Sui’s powerful augmentation ability, he could fight a Calamity-grade creature head-on. He might not be at a disadvantage.

With the augmentation of Tai Sui and The Disqualified, Zhou Wen could even instant transmit seamlessly. The chances of finding the Calamity creature in the Venusian instance dungeon were much higher.

The so-called seamless instant transmission was actually a skill that had virtually zero casting time. By continuously instant transmitting, he could almost constantly be in a state of instant transmission. It was impossible for others to attack Zhou Wen as they couldn’t lock onto his location or even see him.

If the Calamity creature couldn’t see him and he could quickly instant transmit to find the target, there was a high chance of finding the Calamity creature.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen had just grinded the Venusian instance dungeon and ended up dying. All he could do was wait for the Venusian instance dungeon to respawn tomorrow.

“My dear Tai Sui, you’re really outstanding.” Zhou Wen raised the fair and fat Tai Sui and felt blissful. With Tai Sui by his side, he really didn’t think much of ordinary Calamity-grade creatures.

To be safe, Zhou Wen led Tai Sui into Deer Terrace Pavilion again. He wanted to try a few more times to prevent any miscalculations.

Tai Sui’s ability was really impressive. Zhou Wen killed all the way. The Terror-grade creature that he needed to expend some effort to kill was instantly killed. The thrill left Zhou Wen somewhat mesmerized.

However, when he came to the four generals of the Mo family and activated them, even with Tai Sui’s augmentation, the blood-colored avatar was quickly killed.

Although he had the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation protecting him, after the four statues were activated, thousands of pearl beads shot out from the umbrella the Demonized General opened like a vortex, filling the entire space. The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was actually affected and couldn’t circulate normally.

Then, Zhou Wen was ganked and killed. These four fellows were all Calamity-grade existences, and they were top-notch ones. Any one of them had very special abilities that made Zhou Wen envious. He wished he could kill them all and have Companion Eggs drop.

It’s no wonder The Thearch got me to steal the pearl instead. These four fellows are indeed ferocious.?Zhou Wen had previously stolen the beads from the umbrella. Back then, he didn’t know that they were so ferocious.

He couldn’t defeat the four generals of the Mo family for the time being, but Zhou Wen didn’t have any intention of targeting them. He still focused on killing the Calamity creature on Venus.

As long as he could kill the Calamity creature, a Calamity Companion Beast would drop sooner or later. When the time came, with the sure-kill seventh bullet, he could sneak an attack on the four Mo family generals from afar.

As long as I obtain the Companion Beast on Venus, it will be much easier to kill a Calamity creature.?Although Zhou Wen also had his sights on the Kui, nothing dropped.

After respawning, Zhou Wen grinded other dungeons before sleeping. When he woke up, the Venusian instance dungeon had already refreshed.

After killing me so many times, it’s time for me to kill him.?Zhou Wen led Tai Sui into the Venusian instance dungeon and made it undergo Terror transformation.

As a golden light flashed, Tai Sui entered a Terror state as the golden symbol appeared on its body. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Filled with confidence, Zhou Wen wiped out the Metal Guards with a wave of his hand. He wasn’t in a rush to use the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. After all, with Tai Sui’s augmentation, he could set it up almost instantly. There was no need to prepare in advance. This was what Zhou Wen was most satisfied with.

When the Golden Battle God appeared, Zhou Wen wanted to kill it with a wave of his hand, but he suddenly felt that something was amiss.

Zhou Wen hadn’t paid much attention due to his excitement. Now that he had summoned Sword Pill to kill the Golden Battle God, he realized that his summoning speed was much slower.

Bang!

The Golden Battle God’s bullet shot out. Zhou Wen wanted to dodge, but his actions were much slower. He failed to dodge and was hit by the bullet.

What was even more unbelievable was that with his physique, it was fine even if he took a shot head-on. It was impossible for the freezing bullet to freeze his body.

However, when the freezing bullet struck the blood-colored avatar, it froze his body, preventing him from moving.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The Golden Battle God continued firing as freezing bullets struck the blood-colored avatar’s body. Finally, the blood-colored avatar’s body shattered into pieces as the game screen went black.

What’s going on??Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he felt extremely humiliated.

He could kill the Golden Battle God even before he advanced to the Terror grade. Now that he had advanced to the Terror grade, he had been killed by the Golden Battle God. It was a great humiliation.

Tai Sui… is problematic…?Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive. He launched the game again and carefully looked at Tai Sui.

Soon, Zhou Wen realized that after Tai Sui transformed into its Terror form, the golden symbol on its body was different from yesterday’s. It looked very similar, but it was indeed different.

Zhou Wen tried a few more times and indeed, he realized that the problem was with Tai Sui. After touching it, not only was he not augmented, but his body was greatly weakened. In a head-on clash, he couldn’t even defeat ordinary Terror-grade creatures.

He got Tai Sui to exit its Terror form before using it again. This time, there was no golden light, and it was the same symbol.

Zhou Wen studied it for a long time before finally discovering that the symbol on Tai Sui wasn’t fixed. After twenty-four hours, the symbol on Tai Sui changed when it used the Terror transformation ability again.

The symbol that appeared this time was different from the previous two times. After Zhou Wen touched them, he wasn’t augmented or weakened. However, no matter what dimensional creature he killed, none of them dropped dimensional crystals, much less Companion Eggs.

“Bro, are you kidding me? Tell me honestly. How many of those crappy symbols do you have? Quickly give me the first one,” Zhou Wen threatened Tai Sui.

Tai Sui continued bouncing around, unable to understand Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was exasperated. Before figuring out how many symbols Tai Sui had and what effects came with each symbol, he didn’t dare touch them.

As Zhou Wen was studying Tai Sui, the Cube lit up again. The scene of Venus appeared as someone challenged the Venusian dimensional zone.

This time, it was really a person. Zhou Wen immediately recognized the person when he saw him. It was Saint Xiao, but the present Xiao seemed to be different from the Xiao he had seen previously.

Xiao emitted a holy aura, as though he was a saint who had just had his soul cleansed.
