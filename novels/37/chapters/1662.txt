Chapter 1663 Representatives

“The resources that the six Holy races possess are indeed much more than our Spirit race. What they can give you might also be what our Spirit race can’t give you. However, the six Holy races have been plotting on Earth for many years and have already spread the net for countless geniuses among humans. Even if they think highly of you, the resources they give you will only be a tiny fraction,” said Spirit Slave.

An Tianzuo sat in his chair and placed his hands on the table as he calmly looked at Spirit Slave and said, “A large race is a large race after all. Even if it’s just a fraction, it might not be less than what you can offer. Furthermore, as the saying goes, when it comes to choosing shade, it’s better to choose a big tree. If I choose your Spirit race, it’s equivalent to fighting alone. And by choosing them, not only can I obtain resources, but I can also have many helpers, right?”

“You’re right. However, the Holy race might not think as highly of you as we do. It’s impossible for them to have their race’s sovereign to personally meet you, much less give you pointers. This is my race’s sincerity.”

“The leader of your race wants to meet me?” An Tianzuo revealed a look of surprise.

“Yes. Although my race hasn’t reached the position of Holy races, my race’s leader is a powerful existence that can be ranked in the top ten of the alien races.” Spirit Slave’s voice was filled with pride.

“In that case, I’ll meet your race’s leader who can be ranked in the top ten of the alien races,” said An Tianzuo. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This time, Spirit Slave was the one who was slightly taken aback. He never expected An Tianzuo to agree so easily. He swallowed the words of persuasion he had prepared.

“Why? Can’t we meet now?” An Tianzuo said indifferently.

“Of course. However, with Earth’s openness, it’s still a little troublesome to enter the dimension. I can only ask you to leave Earth with me before using some means to enter the dimension…”

Luoyang’s Li family.

“Li Mobai, you don’t have to answer me immediately. You can consider it slowly.” Li Mobai sat in front of the lamp that shone his shadow on the wall. The shadow was completely different from his actions. Furthermore, it could make sounds.

“There’s no need. Take me to your Lord of Evil Ghosts,” Li Mobai said.

“What a wise choice.” The shadow cackled. In the next second, the lamp was switched off and the room turned pitch-black.

The Ultimate Family Clan of the North District.

“Lance, tell me your answer.” A glorious figure floated in front of Lance. Under the immense pressure, the companions who were with Lance couldn’t withstand the terrifying pressure as they knelt on one knee. Their faces were distorted and their bodies were covered in sweat.

“There are so many Saints in the Divine Emperor Holy Temple. Why do you still want me? Furthermore, the ones corresponding to your Divine Emperor Holy Temple should be the Cape family, right? Why aren’t you choosing people from the Cape family? Why are you looking for me?” Lance’s entire body was trembling. His legs were about to break, but he still held on and didn’t kneel.

SOV

“There can only be one sovereign in this world. If you come, you will be the only sovereign in my race’s Holy Temple.” The figure continued, “However, everyone wants to become sovereign. If you become sovereign, you have to constantly accept challenges from everyone. If you lose, you will be reduced to nothing. If you remain undefeated, the people who want to become sovereign will constantly challenge you until you die or lose… Tell me… your choice…”

“It doesn’t matter if I become sovereign or not. The key is that I like the feeling of constantly winning,” Lance said in all seriousness.

Zhou Wen had already explored Guide Ancient City thoroughly in the past few days. Apart from the lack of dimensional creatures, everything else was suitable as a human city.

The city was big enough. Not only was it huge, but there was also a large space inside the many buildings. The entire city’s space was many times bigger than it appeared from the outside.

Furthermore, there was plenty of water here. There were many stone wells distributed in the city, and the underground water in the wells was endless.

It could be used for planting and breeding. As long as there was water, they could become self-sufficient with food.

The only hidden danger was the stone saber on Fire God Platform. If the stone saber was pulled out, it was unknown what changes the ancient city would undergo.

As for the humanoid monster, it had already been completely tamed by Zhang Yuzhi. It followed Zhang Yuzhi every moment like her bodyguard.

However, other than Zhang Yuzhi, he had a strong desire to attack other humans when he saw them. Luckily, with Zhang Yuzhi around, he wouldn’t really attack humans.

S.

“How is it? Have you decided? Do you want to build a city here?” Zhang Yuzhi asked Zhou Wen with a smile.

“Let’s do it here,” Zhou Wen answered with a nod. He had already thought it through over the past few days, so there was no need for him to hesitate.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s answer, Zhang Yuzhi sighed. “From the looks of it, I jumped from one cage to another.”

“This isn’t a cage. This is home,” Zhou Wen said.

“Then I want to choose the best room for this home.” Zhang Yuzhi laughed again.

Zhou Wen left the ancient city and returned to the base. Zhang Yuzhi and the Zhang family stayed in the ancient city. It wasn’t that Zhang Yuzhi didn’t wish to return with him, but she couldn’t leave. She needed to continue nurturing her relationship with the humanoid monster, hoping to restrain him as much as possible to prevent any accidents from happening during the mass migration.

Just as Zhang Yuzhi had said, if they really built a city, it would probably be difficult for her to leave in the future.

Zhou Wen returned to the base and found Li Xuan in the meeting hall. Then, he realized that Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, and Qin Zhen were all there.

“Old Zhou, you came back at the right time. They encountered some trouble. Give them some suggestions,” Li Xuan said as he pointed at Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu.

“What happened?” Zhou Wen imagined that something had happened to their family when he saw that they were fine.

Feng Qiuyan’s expression was solemn as he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Coach, there are dimensional races that want the two of us to become their representatives on Earth.” “Which race found you? One of the six Holy Temples?” Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised when he heard that. He had already learned from Wang Mingyuan that the seal on Earth was weakening. The terrifying existences in the dimension wouldn’t dare risk entering Earth themselves. They would definitely find some humans to figure out what was on Earth on their behalf.

Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu were the cream of the crop among humans, so it wasn’t surprising that the races of the dimension would seek them out.

“No, they are all races I’ve never heard of. The one that came to me is some Inter race? The one that went to Little Yanyan is some Phaseless race.” Ming Xiu paused before continuing, “They said that they will send us into the dimension to cultivate for a period of time and give us enough resources and help us advance to the Calamity grade. Coach, do you think we should go?”

Zhou Wen looked at Ming Xiu before looking at Feng Qiuyan. He shook his head and sighed. “The answer is already in your hearts. Why bother asking?”

“If Coach needs me to stay, I’ll stay,” Feng Qiuyan said.

“I need you, but not now.” Zhou Wen patted Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu’s shoulders. “Just respect your conscience. However, you still have to be careful. The fellows from the dimension aren’t good people. You can take advantage of them, but be careful not to be exploited.”

“The base’s situation is in a terrible state now. If we leave, will the base be capable of defending?” Ming Xiu asked worriedly.

“Don’t worry. I’ve already chosen a city. There’s no need to build it. We can move over immediately,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

There was no such thing as an airtight secret in the world. The news of the various dimensional races choosing representatives among humans quickly spread in the Federation.
