Chapter 181 Fairy

“Are you confident in killing a Fairy?” Zhou Wen followed behind the group as they walked towards Lotus Flower Cave.

“No,” Hui Haifeng answered.

Although Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya didn’t answer, their faces implied that they weren’t confident either.

“Aren’t you taking too much of a risk when you don’t have the confidence in killing a Fairy?” Zhou Wen looked at the trio speechlessly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Hui Haifeng smiled and said, “If it’s something that can definitely be done, what’s the fun in doing so? It’s only interesting if you aren’t confident.”

“What theory is that?” Zhou Wen was rendered even more speechless. He didn’t agree that risking one’s life for fun was something interesting.

Zhong Ziya pursed his lips and said, “Hui Haifeng might not be entirely right, but there’s nothing wrong with it. If it’s something others can do, why should we do it?”

“What about you?” Zhou Wen looked at Jiang Yan.

“Counselor got me to watch you all. Since all of you are going, I can only follow,” Jiang Yan said indifferently.

Zhou Wen looked at the trio and was momentarily at a loss for words. He increasingly felt that none of Wang Mingyuan’s students were normal.

He had originally found Hui Haifeng was rather normal, but from what he saw today, he was wrong. Apart from Zhou Wen, no one else was in any way normal.

Why would a gentle person like Teacher, teach such a bunch of strange and eccentric fellows? Zhou Wen originally wanted to say that he wasn’t going, but the trio had already gone far.

“Whatever.” Zhou Wen sighed and shook his head before following.

Zhou Wen wasn’t completely lacking in confidence. He wasn’t a Fairy’s match in the past, but he was much stronger now. Although he wasn’t enough to fight an Epic Fairy, he still had some confidence in staying alive.

When he grinded in Lotus Flower Cave, he would occasionally encounter a Fairy. It wasn’t difficult for him to escape.

Soon, the four arrived at Lotus Flower Cave. Not long after they entered the cave, they met a Fairy Monkey.

Before Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya could make a move, Hui Haifeng nudged Zhou Wen forward. “You’ve been recuperating for so long, let’s warm up your muscles first so that you won’t have a cramp when you encounter a Fairy.”

I’ll be the last one cramping between the two of us, Zhou Wen cursed inwardly, but he had no choice but to approach the Fairy Monkey.

He had lost count of the number of Fairy Monkeys he had killed in-game, but he knew every action of theirs. When he saw the Fairy Monkey flap its wings and fly down, its claws shimmering with a terrifying light, he unhurriedly took a huge step forward and leaped up, causing the Fairy Monkey to barely miss him.

Bam!

Zhou Wen struck the back of the Fairy Monkey’s head with his palm. The Fairy Monkey didn’t even have the chance to scream as it fell from the sky. It convulsed twice without any sound.

“Beautiful!” Hui Haifeng couldn’t help but praise.

Jiang Yan was also slightly surprised, but Zhong Ziya pursed his lips and said, “Passable. All that training in palm techniques didn’t go to waste after all. You didn’t embarrass Teacher.”

They encountered several Fairy Monkeys in a row, but no one was willing to take action. Zhou Wen had no choice but to head up and hunt them, treating it as an opportunity to practice his Seven Distribution Palm.

Zhong Ziya led the way, passing through more than ten caves when they suddenly saw a fairy-like creature rushing towards them with its clothes fluttering.

Zhou Wen recognized it at a glance. It was a Fairy-an Epic dimensional creature inside Lotus Flower Cave.

But upon careful inspection, Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically. He had seen quite a number of Fairies, but they were all dressed in colorful clothes with ribbons wrapped around their bodies.

However, this Fairy was different. She was dressed in black and the ribbons fluttering in her body were pure white in color. She was very different from the Fairies that Zhou Wen had previously seen.

“Oh no, it’s a Mutated Fairy.” Zhong Ziya was also surprised, but he had no intention of retreating. He took out a gun and aimed it at the Fairy, shooting three consecutive shots.

The bullets instantly appeared in front of the Fairy, but she didn’t move at all. The pure white ribbons danced around her body as though they had a life of their own, repelling the three bullets.

The bullets made of Primordial Gold failed to deal any damage.

“Run!” Seeing that the three bullets were useless, Zhong Ziya immediately turned around and ran. His actions were swift and without any hesitation.

Zhou Wen had just started when he saw Jiang Yan and Hui Haifeng running, each faster than the other. They had run virtually at the same moment with Zhong Ziya, and Zhou Wen was the slowest.

However, even Zhong Ziya, who was running right ahead, was unable to rush out of the cave. Just as he was about to enter the neighboring cave, he saw the surroundings suddenly turn pitch black. He could no longer see anything

Zhong Ziya leaped up in a bid to rush out of the cave in the darkness.

However, with that jump, he slammed into what appeared like a steel plate. With a loud bang, Zhong Ziya’s face was flattened from the impact. He fell back as his nose bled.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan could see, but he could see everything clearly with Truth Listener’s powers.

As for the Fairy in the air, a black sun suddenly appeared behind her. It emitted black light which enveloped the entire cave, forming a dark space.

Is that the Life Soul of a Fairy? Zhou Wen had also seen a few Fairies, but he had never seen them use their Life Souls. It was unknown if the typical Fairy’s Life Soul was the same as a Mutated Fairy’s.

Zhou Wen was just about to warn Jiang Yan and Hui Haifeng to be careful when the ribbon on the Mutated Fairy flew over like a jade wyrm tearing through the air. It was targeting Zhou Wen.

Just as he was about to fight, he saw Jiang Yan’s figure flash and help him block. A slender sword had appeared in his hand in the process.

The sword’s width was at most one finger wide, even thinner than paper, so thin that it was almost transparent.

The sword in Jiang Yan’s hand drew out a purple beam and accurately hit the ribbon. It failed to slice through it but instead wrapped around the sword.

With a tug of the Fairy’s milky-white hand, the pure white ribbon tightened and the sword in Jiang Yan’s hand snapped loudly into several pieces.

Jiang Yan retreated in time, avoiding being sliced by the ribbon.

Zhong Ziya leaped up from the ground, a gun in each hand. He fired ceaselessly at the Mutated Fairy, but unfortunately, all the bullets were blocked by the spinning ribbons. The Fairy wasn’t injured at all.

.

Why are we so unlucky? Zhou Wen knew that if he didn’t kill this Mutated Fairy, they would probably die. Without any hesitation, he took the opportunity to summon the Great Yin Fan while the Fairy was blocking the bullets. He leaped into the air and charged at the Mutated Fairy.

Meanwhile, Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan seemed to act as though their minds were connected by telepathy. They charged at the Mutated Fairy, clearly having the same thoughts.
