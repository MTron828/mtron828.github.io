Chapter 1415: Unique

Translator: CKtalon

Xiao is the representative of the Holy Land. Since he’s appearing in the Venusian dimensional zone, he will definitely be able to clear it. However, I wonder what method he will use.?Zhou Wen guessed how Xiao would clear the Venusian dimensional zone.

In theory, Xiao was only at the Terror grade. Only by using some special techniques could he clear the level.

However, the Holy Land was not to be trifled with. It was the only place on Earth that wasn’t bound by Earth’s rules. The powerhouses of the dimension could freely control their powers there.

Although they didn’t dare leave the Holy Land, the help they could give the saints was beyond what the typical person could imagine.

In fact, it wasn’t just Zhou Wen. The various factions were also paying attention to every move the Holy Land made.

After all, the Holy Land was the first faction to rule Earth. Although the six families’ overt opposition and open strife made the Holy Land lose absolute control of Earth, no one dared to underestimate the Holy Land’s influence on Earth.

The six families that had gradually escaped the Holy Land’s control still didn’t dare to openly say that they had betrayed the Holy Land. From this, one could tell how terrifying the Holy Land was.

Now, everyone wanted to know how much strength and influence the Holy Land had on Earth without the support of the six families.

Under the attention of everyone, Xiao entered the Venusian dimensional zone.

The Metal Guard that appeared in the beginning was naturally nothing to a powerhouse at Xiao’s level. No one believed that the Metal Guard could deal any damage to Xiao. What people really wanted to see was how Xiao could fend off the Calamity-grade bullet.

However, what happened next surprised many people.

The Metal Guard didn’t attack Xiao. It seemed to stand there in a daze.

Xiao watched as the Metal Guard did nothing, but the Metal Guard suddenly aimed its gun at itself.

Da! Da! Da! Da!

The Metal Guard riddled its body with holes.

“Body control or mind control?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

“The Metal Guard’s body didn’t look like it was under control. It’s more likely to be a mind-control technique,” An Sheng said.

“Are you sure?” Zhou Wen asked An Sheng.

“No.” An Sheng shook his head with a bitter smile. “Let’s watch and see. Perhaps we can find some clues.”

Zhang Chunqiu and Zhang Yuzhi from the Zhang family were also discussing this problem, but they didn’t have an answer.

In fact, the various factions were also studying and analyzing the situation, but they had no results.

Hordes of Metal Guards rushed out, but they only rushed out without shooting at Xiao.

Following that, the Metal Guards raised their guns and aimed them at themselves. Soon, they succeeded in killing themselves and dropped metal fragments on the ground.

After the Golden Battle Gods rushed out, Zhou Wen originally imagined that Xiao wouldn’t clear them so easily, but the Golden Battle Gods raised their guns and committed suicide once again.

The entire Federation was in an uproar.

“Who is this person? Why haven’t I seen him before? He’s just too powerful.”

“This is sick. His opponent committed suicide without him even moving his hand. Is he a god?”

“From the looks of it, he seems to be stronger than Immortal, Tsukuyomi, and Zhou Wen.”

“It’s still too early to say that he’s strong. It’s nothing to make the Golden Battle God commit suicide. It will be truly impressive if he can make that Calamity-grade creature commit suicide.”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. The typical citizen only knew that Xiao showed a strong performance, but no one could tell how strong he was.

However, when the various factions saw the Golden Battle Gods commit suicide, they jumped in fright. Their expressions turned nasty.

Those who were truly knowledgeable were alarmed at the strength that could make Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods commit suicide.

One had to realize that other than Immortal, the strongest combat strength among humans now was at the Terror grade. If Terror-grade creatures would commit suicide when they saw Xiao, Xiao alone could probably destroy all the factions.

“He can’t be that strong, right? There must be a limit,” Xia Xuanyue said as she looked at the Cube’s screen in surprise.

“He doesn’t seem to have any restrictions.” Xia Liuchuan also frowned.

Now, the Holy Land’s control over the various families was weakening. It wasn’t just the Xia family. The six families were deliberately or unintentionally trying to completely escape the Holy Land’s control over them.

However, after seeing Xiao’s performance today, the fear in their hearts deepened.

Like the Metal Guards from before, all six Golden Battle Gods committed suicide. None of the Golden Battle Gods shot at Xiao. Their bullets were aimed at themselves.

The alarms on the six doors sounded at the same time, snapping the bewildered people back to their senses. They stared at Xiao, wondering if Xiao’s power was effective against the Calamity-grade creature.

Xiao walked towards the door leading to the tunnel as though he hadn’t heard the alarms.

He didn’t walk quickly, as though he was taking a stroll. He ignored the ear-piercing alarm.

Everyone’s hearts pounded with his footsteps. Soon, they were alarmed to discover that Xiao had already walked into the tunnel, but they didn’t hear any gunshots.

No way… Even a Calamity-grade creature can be affected…?Zhou Wen’s expression changed.

He didn’t know how Xiao had done it, but from the looks of it, Xiao was really terrifying.

And he was undoubtedly Xiao’s enemy. If Xiao came knocking on his door that very moment, Zhou Wen didn’t know if he could withstand Xiao’s power.

If he couldn’t withstand it, he would commit suicide like the Golden Battle Gods. When that happened, that was it.

Zhang Chunqiu’s expression turned abnormally solemn. Xia Liuchuan stood up and stared at the Cube’s screen without saying a word. However, his brows were furrowed. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Xiao was still walking in the direction of the Golden Palace. Every step he took made everyone’s hearts beat as though they were silently keeping pace with his steps.

Many people were looking forward to the gunshot, but they didn’t hear any even when Xiao reached the Golden Palace’s entrance.

The Golden Palace’s door opened as a metal ball flew out and landed in Xiao’s hand.

The Cube’s screen returned to the rankings. The words ‘Saint Xiao’ appeared at the top of the rankings, outranking Zhou Wen who had only been first for a short period of time.

“Ah! I thought that the maximum would only be five stars. Why are there six stars!?”

People were surprised to discover that behind the words “Saint Xiao,” there were six golden stars.

Regardless of whether it was Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen, The Fallen, or Immortal, the most they received was five stars via using all sorts of methods to clear the level. Therefore, people felt that the maximum was five stars.

However, the six golden stars behind ‘Saint Xiao’ clearly told everyone that five stars wasn’t the limit, and he was the only existence with such an achievement.

Everyone’s expression, including Zhou Wen’s, turned solemn as they looked at Xiao’s name on the rankings.
