Chapter 1475 Sovereign Sui’s Statue

“Zhou Wen… Not good…” Yu Qiubai anxiously sought out Zhou Wen.

“What happened?” Zhou Wen looked at Yu Qiubai in puzzlement, unsure what had happened to make him so nervous.

“A large-scale break-out has happened in Luoyang. An Sheng has returned to Luoyang with his troops to provide reinforcements. The troops have already left Guide City…” Yu Qiubai said worriedly.

“How many people did An Sheng and company take with them?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought. “As they left in a hurry, they didn’t take anyone with them. After the skeleton creatures lost their suppression, they charged out en masse. With our present strength, it’s very difficult to stop all the skeletons from rushing out…” Yu Qiubai explained the situation clearly.

When Zhou Wen heard that, he knew what had happened. The so-called situation of break-out creatures in Luoyang wreaking havoc everywhere was just an excuse. An Sheng had long made up his mind to keep them behind.

“Sir, lead your men to the school’s main entrance and set up a signboard. If anyone wishes to enter the school and receive our protection, get them to sign this contract.” Zhou Wen handed a document to Yu Qiubai.

Yu Qiubai unfolded the document and carefully read the content. Then, his expression gradually turned odd.

“Isn’t this a little inhuman?” Yu Qiubai said hesitantly.

“Since they had already chosen to leave, they naturally have to pay a price if they wish to stay. Otherwise, they will think that we are a place that only takes in the rejected in the future, a place they can come and go as they wish. Then how can rules be implemented?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

Zhou Wen could only use the school as his base as a front to recruit people. He could then establish his city when he found a suitable place. Zhou Wen’s idea was good, but there were too few people under him who could carry out his vision. There were too many people who came to seek refuge under him. Many of them entered secretly. They did not take the initiative to sign a contract with Zhou Wen, believing that they could bluff their way through. Zhou Wen also knew that many people had sneaked in. It could even be said that less than a tenth of the people had signed a contract. Most of them had sneaked in without signing a contract.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t take it to heart. All he did was tell Yu Qiubai to give more classes and tell them the consequences of not signing a contract.

Zhou Wen got his Companion Beasts to guard the area near the school. Humans from the nearby area kept coming to seek refuge.

Most people had no choice but to join Zhou Wen. It was impossible to travel the distance between Guide and Luoyang without sufficient strength. All they could do was join him. Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about such matters. When he arrived at Sovereign Sui’s Tomb again, it had been about four days since he had left the animals inside.

In theory, if the power of the torch could really affect them, they should be close to death. Or rather, they should be dead.

Don’t die… Please don’t die… Zhou Wen prayed silently as he walked into Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

If those tiny animals died due to the influence of the torch’s power, it would be impossible for them to build a human city here. Zhou Wen would have no choice but to find other suitable dimensional zones which might not exist.

After entering Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, the scene Zhou Wen saw left him stunned.

Not only had the animals not died, but they were also shockingly healthy and energetic. What was even more terrifying was that there were many babies in the grass.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed. From the looks of it, the power of Sovereign Sui’s torch wasn’t Time Acceleration, nor would it kill animals.

On the contrary, the vitality emitted by the torch made animals stronger and healthier.

I’ll experiment a few more times. If there aren’t any accidents, I should be able to begin building the city. Zhou Wen watched as Chick sucked away the flames on the torch. He clearly saw that the feathers on Chick’s body seemed to glow brighter. Not daring to be careless, Zhou Wen carried out a few more tests. The results showed that the power in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb had a very potent effect on plants and animals, but it didn’t age them.

This is somewhat similar to my Human Sovereign power. Zhou Wen suspected that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was likely created by Sovereign Sui. And his original intention was similar to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra that Zhou Wen had comprehended. However, because no human could take this path, he took another.

Zhou Wen took the opportunity to study Sovereign Sui’s statue. Typical flames couldn’t ignite a torch. The torch looked like it was carved from stone and didn’t have any fuel. Typical flames naturally couldn’t make the stone burn.

When Chick’s phoenix flames touched the torch, it would immediately ignite. However, no matter how long it burned, it wouldn’t damage the torch carved from stone.

Furthermore, Chick was very interested in the phoenix flames that burned on the torch. Every time Zhou Wen made it absorb the flames, Chick would appear thrilled.

Zhou Wen used a few fire abilities, but he failed to ignite the torch. Unwilling to give up, he switched to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and the sun-like Human Sovereign appeared in front of him.

The moment Human Sovereign appeared, Zhou Wen immediately discovered something strange.

The originally motionless Sovereign Sui statue began to emit vitality.

Previously, when Chick used its phoenix flames to ignite the torch, it only emitted vitality and flames. The Sovereign Sui statue’s main body didn’t undergo an anomaly.

However, the Sovereign Sui statue’s body now began emitting vitality. Although it wasn’t as intense as before, it delighted Zhou Wen. With a thought, Human Sovereign reached out and pressed down on the flaming torch in the statue’s hand.

The torch that ordinary flames couldn’t ignite immediately ignited upon contact with Human Sovereign.

It wasn’t just the torch. The entire Sovereign Sui statue burned as though gasoline had been poured over it.

The flames and vitality over Sovereign Sui’s body transmitted to Human Sovereign at the same time, making the originally dazzling Human Sovereign even more dazzling.

Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra in his body was circulating crazily as the surrounding vitality constantly surged into his body.

Boom!

A deafening boom suddenly entered Zhou Wen’s ears as the burning Sovereign Sui statue moved.

The statue that was clearly made of stone slowly raised its leg and stood up from its stone throne. The flames of vitality on its body intensified, making it difficult to see its body clearly.

In particular, the pair of eyes stared at Zhou Wen and Human Sovereign like two two-million-watt searchlights.
