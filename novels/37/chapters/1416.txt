Chapter 1417: He Who Must Not Be Named

Translator: CKtalon

“What means do you have?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan and An Sheng in puzzlement. Clearly, the two of them had discussed it beforehand.

Li Xuan said, “Actually, our family has been researching ways to clear the level. We have come up with a few solutions, but the requirements are too high. No one in our family can meet such high requirements, but it would be different if it were you.”

“What solution?” Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to beat around the bush with Li Xuan.

Li Xuan finally said straightforwardly, “You can fend off the Calamity bullet and have enough strength to kill the Calamity creature. Based on our family’s judgment, the Calamity gunner’s flesh shouldn’t be too strong, so you already have the basic conditions to kill him. Although Xiao is very strong, he failed to kill the Calamity gunner after all. You can, so you have a chance to surpass him and obtain first place.”

“The family you are talking about is your brother, Li Mobai, right? He sure is scheming. He wants me to risk my life while he benefits in the comforts of his home.” Zhou Wen glared at Li Xuan and said, “Go back and tell your brother not to fantasize. If I could kill that Calamity gunner, I would have done so a long time ago. Would he even be able to take advantage of me?”

“Listen to me. It’s true that you are capable, but you can’t find the Calamity gunner, right? Li Mobai has a solution that you can use to find it,” Li Xuan hurriedly said.

“He has a solution? What solution does he have? He hasn’t even been to the Venusian dimensional zone and knows how to find that Calamity gunner? Don’t tell me he’s trying to scam me?” Zhou Wen refused to believe it.

He had been grinding the Venusian domain for so long, but he hadn’t been able to find the Calamity gunner. He really didn’t believe that Li Mobai, who didn’t even dare enter the Venusian dimensional zone, could tell where it was.

“You also know that my relationship with Li Mobai isn’t good. How can I help him scam you? This time, he really has a way to get you to find the Calamity gunner. Trust me. Go meet him and hear what he has to say. If you think it’s infeasible, it won’t be too late to reject him when the time comes.” Li Xuan seemed very confident in Li Mobai’s method.

“You also believe in Li Mobai?” Zhou Wen asked An Sheng.

An Sheng shook his head and said, “I don’t believe Li Mobai. I only believe in Overseer. Overseer sent a message asking me to cooperate with Li Mobai.”

“Are you sure it’s news from An Tianzuo?” Zhou Wen was somewhat suspicious.

“There’s no mistake about it.” An Sheng was very certain.

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss. He seemed to realize something, but he couldn’t connect the dots.

Although Li Mobai re-cultivated after the problem with his body, it will definitely take a lot of time. He won’t be able to catch up so quickly. With his eyesight, it’s hard to say if he can see the Calamity-grade figure. Furthermore, finding a Calamity-grade that’s good at hiding definitely isn’t something he can do.

Besides, why would An Tianzuo want to cooperate with Li Mobai? An Tianzuo should be in the Holy Land now. Why would he be in contact with Li Mobai?

Zhou Wen combed through his thoughts for a while before his heart suddenly stirred.?I get it. If all of these things are valid, there’s definitely a missing link. This link might be something or a person. If An Tianzuo discovers the location of the Calamity gunner, he should have directly informed An Sheng without needing to cooperate with Li Mobai. In that case, it’s very likely that the Li family discovered the location of the Calamity gunner, but it’s unlikely that Li Mobai has such eyesight, nor can he be in contact with An Tianzuo while he’s inside the Holy Land. The remaining possibility is that the Li family has someone in the Holy Land.

Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan and An Sheng thoughtfully. He didn’t believe that Li Xuan and An Sheng hadn’t thought of this. They had figured it out, but they kept mum. This could only mean that this person’s identity was very important. They were afraid that the Holy Land would catch wind of him, so they couldn’t even say it out loud. They could only use this hint to let Zhou Wen know of his existence. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Zhou Wen exchanged looks with An Sheng before saying, “In that case, let me meet Li Mobai first.”

“He’s already waiting outside the manor. I’ll invite him in.” Li Xuan ran out.

“Young Master, safety first. These were the last words Overseer sent back,” An Sheng whispered to Zhou Wen.

“It must be very difficult to send a message from the Holy Land, right?” Zhou Wen said.

An Sheng said, “Every Saint has a special power. Their every word and action, even if it’s something related to them, or even just mentioning them might be sensed by the terrifying existences in the Holy Land. However, the further away they are from the Holy Land, the less effective this power is.”

Zhou Wen knew that his guess was right. He probably couldn’t even say the person’s name, so it was best not to mention it. That meant that he was likely one of the Saints. Furthermore, he was the real deal, not an imposter like An Tianzuo.

“If there really is such a power, wouldn’t An Tianzuo be easily discovered?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Young Master, don’t worry. Overseer has used a special method to successfully infiltrate the Holy Land. There’s no danger for the time being.” An Sheng was about to say something when a voice sounded from outside. It was Li Xuan and Li Mobai.

“Even if Overseer says that the Li family can be trusted, Young Master, you have to make your own judgment. You have to make the decision on what can and cannot be done. Don’t be influenced by anyone. As long as you think there’s a problem, don’t listen to anyone, no matter who says it—including me. Stay true to yourself,” An Sheng whispered the last sentence.

Zhou Wen nodded. Li Xuan had already led Li Mobai in.

“Can I have a private chat with Zhou Wen?” After Li Mobai entered, his gaze didn’t land on Zhou Wen but on An Sheng.

“Of course.” An Sheng led Li Xuan out and closed the door. He also activated the room’s defense system.

“I never expected to meet you again in such a place,” Li Mobai said with a smile as he sat down on the sofa without standing on ceremony.

“Just get straight to the point.” Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in chatting with Li Mobai.

Li Mobai didn’t mind, but his body gradually changed. His eyes turned whiter and whiter as his black pupils shrank before completely disappearing.

At that moment, Li Mobai’s eyes were white—ghastly white—even more terrifying than a blind person’s eyes.

Mythical Serum??Zhou Wen frowned slightly. Li Mobai’s aura was a little strange. It seemed to be the result of advancing through the use of Mythical Serum, but it also seemed different.

“Mythical Serum made from the Calamity-grade creature, Ghost Eyes, in the South District,” Li Mobai said.

“You have the ability to kill a Calamity-grade creature?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“It was slain during its advancement to the Calamity grade. When it was made into Mythical Serum, it could and could not be considered a Calamity-grade creature. I still haven’t been able to completely unleash the power of the Ghost Eyes Mythical Serum. I’m only at the Mythical stage now,” Li Mobai answered.

Li Mobai didn’t claim to be the one killing Ghost Eyes. Zhou Wen could roughly guess that it was likely done by the undercover Saint.

“My Ghost Eyes can help you find the Calamity gunner,” Li Mobai continued.

“You want to clear the level with me?” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai.

“No, from what I’ve reckoned, if two creatures were to challenge the level together, their ratings would be lower than if it was done by one. If you want to surpass Xiao, you can only clear the level alone.” Li Mobai’s answer exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations.

“Then how can you help me find that Calamity gunner? Communication with the outside world is impossible after entering the Venusian dimensional zone,” Zhou Wen said.

“Therefore, you have to take my eyes with you,” Li Mobai said as he extended his finger and stabbed it into his eyes.. Blood immediately gushed out like a blooming flower.
