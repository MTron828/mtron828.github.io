Chapter 1804 Nüwa Temple

The jade statue was engraved in the shape of a woman. She was beautiful but not gorgeous. She had a dignified bearing and her entire body seemed to emit a holy glow.

Although the stone temple was nameless, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun had already guessed that the jade statue was very likely the legendary Nüwa.

“The war between Shang and Zhou, or rather, the beginning of the war between humans and gods, is here-Nüwa’s temple.” Jing Daoxian also confirmed their guess.

“Why aren’t there any creatures in such a place?” Liu Yun asked in puzzlement.

“Not being able to see something doesn’t mean there’s nothing.” Jing Daoxian stared at the Nüwa statue and said, “Back then, the four of us had different fortuitous encounters here.”

“What fortuitous encounters?” Zhou Wen sized up the stone temple and saw that there was only one room inside. Apart from Nüwa’s statue, there was nothing else.

“Nüwa Temple doesn’t seem dangerous, but it’s actually the most bizarre place in the world.” Jing Daoxian arrived at the entrance of the temple, but he didn’t walk in. He sneered and said, “All four saw different scenes after walking into Nüwa Temple.”

“You mean that Nüwa Temple is actually an entrance to a different space? Everyone will enter a different space?” Zhou Wen said in thought.

“That’s one way to explain it, but it’s not that simple.” Jing Daoxian paused before continuing, “After I came out of Nüwa Temple, I stayed here for a long time. I only saw Ouyang Ting and Zhou Lingfeng come out separately, but I didn’t see Wang Mingyuan. Zhou Lingfeng was carrying a baby in his arms. Ouyang Ting didn’t show anything special.”

...

“What did you see in Nüwa Temple?” Zhou Wen asked Jing Daoxian.

“It’s nothing. I just obtained something. You’re very familiar with that thing,” Jing Daoxian said with narrowed eyes.

“Lost Immortal Sutra?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred.

“That’s right. It’s the Lost Immortal Sutra. After I obtained it, I tried all sorts of methods to crack the secret technique within. Not only did I fail, but I also ended up suffering damage. Furthermore, I gave it to different people, but the outcome was the same. No one could master the Lost Immortal Sutra. Instead, they ended up worse off. Later, I had an idea...” Jing Daoxian looked at Zhou Wen with a strange look.

“You gave me the Lost Immortal Sutra. It was indeed premeditated. You suspected that I’m the baby my father carried out of Nüwa Temple,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

“That’s right. Reality has proven that only you can master the Lost Immortal Sutra.” Jing Daoxian seemed to be certain that Zhou Wen was the baby.

“In that case, not only did you obtain Lost Sutra Immortal in Nüwa Temple, but you also saw something else,” Zhou Wen said slowly as he looked at Jing Daoxian.

“Why do you say that?” Jing Daoxian asked with interest.

“If you only obtained Lost Immortal Sutra and didn’t have anything more precious, why would you give it to me so easily? You gave me Lost Immortal Sutra because you wanted to use the power of me and Lost Immortal Sutra to obtain something even more precious,” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s right. You’re right. I did see something even more precious, but to obtain that thing, I have to master the Lost Immortal Sutra. And the only person who can master it is you.” Jing Daoxian readily admitted Zhou Wen’s guess.

“In that case, you must have thought of a way to get me in. Why don’t you tell me?” Zhou Wen didn’t ask what the item was.

“Everyone finds themselves in a different place when entering Nüwa Temple. There’s only one way to get you to where I ended.” Jing Daoxian’s eyes flickered. “That is to make the two of us become one.”

“Oh, how can we become one?” Zhou Wen continued asking without batting an eyelid.

“It was originally very easy. After you cultivate the Lost Immortal Sutra, I was going to snatch your body and abilities for myself. Unfortunately, this method won’t work now. I might not be able to defeat you in a fight.” Such shameless words sounded natural from Jing Daoxian’s mouth.

“I’m really sorry for raising the difficulty for you,” Zhou Wen quipped.

“It’s nothing. A living person must go with the flow. There’s always a way,” Jing Daoxian said with a smile. “Not only did I fail to cultivate the Lost Immortal Sutra, but it also caused a huge latent danger to my body. It can be said that all these years, I’ve been dragging my half-crippled body in a race with Death. Although I survived, I’ve always been half a step away from death’s door.

“Therefore, I thought of a way to resolve the problem with my body and let you enter Nüwa Temple with me.”

“What was it?” Zhou Wen was really curious.

“I can attach myself to your Companion Beast. This way, you and I will be one,” Jing Daoxian said.

“That works?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

“To me, there’s nothing in this world that’s impossible.” Jing Daoxian spoke casually, but his tone was filled with pride.

“Don’t worry. It’s only a temporary attachment. After leaving Nüwa Temple, we will go our separate ways and have nothing to do with each other in the future,” Jing Daoxian added, afraid that Zhou Wen would have scruples. “It doesn’t matter. I’m very interested in seeing how you will attach yourself to my Companion Beast.” With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned a low-level Vigor Ant Companion Beast.

“Although my name has the word ‘xian’-in other words ‘immortal,’ I’m not a true immortal. I can’t attach myself to just any Companion Beast,” Jing Daoxian said as he slowly took out a Companion Egg and handed it to Zhou Wen. “Hatch this Companion Egg first. I can only attach myself to it.”

Zhou Wen sized up the Companion Egg and saw that it was a fist-sized black crystal-like Companion Egg. Black light swirled inside like a black hole that devoured everything. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What Companion Egg is this?” Zhou Wen scanned the Companion Egg and didn’t discover anything abnormal. Jing Daoxian hadn’t tampered with it.

“A special Calamity-grade Companion Egg. After you hatch it, you will naturally know why I can only attach myself to it,” Jing Daoxian said.

Zhou Wen took the Companion Egg and glanced at Liu Yun. “What will happen to Eldest Senior Brother after we enter?”

“He doesn’t need to enter. All he needs to do is stay here to provide backup. If we encounter any mishaps inside and remain inside for twenty-four hours, he can leave and get help,” Jing Daoxian said with a smile.

“Who can save us?” Zhou Wen could tell that Jing Daoxian was implying something.

“It might be Ouyang Ting, Zhou Lingfeng, or even Wang Mingyuan. Who knows? Perhaps someone doesn’t want us to die inside,” Jing Daoxian said indifferently. “There’s not much time left. Let’s begin.”

Zhou Wen glanced at Jing Daoxian and with a thought, he injected Essence Energy into the Companion Egg in his hand and hatched it.

After the Companion Egg absorbed the Essence Energy, it immediately emitted a black light that transformed into a black light vortex that fused into Zhou Wen’s body and condensed into a strange symbol on his forehead.
