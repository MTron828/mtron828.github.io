Chapter 1334: Returning to Settle Scores

Translator: CKtalon

These are six sure-kill bullets. Even the Calamity-grade Dragon Turtle couldn’t withstand them. If I can find a Calamity-grade creature… The premise is that if it can’t kill me, all I need to do is rush up and hug it. The six bullets should be enough to kill a Calamity, right??Zhou Wen thought as he took out his phone and entered the dungeon.

However, to his disappointment, there were no bullets surrounding the blood-colored avatar.

In that case, I can only search for Calamity-grade creatures in reality.?Zhou Wen immediately felt that the risk factor was too high.

Heavenly Robe’s Lucky Dodge was indeed amazing, but there was a limit to it. Single-target attacks like bullets were fine, and they might even be very effective against the rain of arrows that covered a wide range.

However, if he encountered an AOE flaming or icy power, there was no room for him to dodge. No matter how high his Lucky Dodge was, it was impossible for him to dodge those attacks.

With this in mind, there were fewer places he could go. The few known Calamity-grade creatures were not easy to approach.

It’s best if I don’t go to Chess Mountain. Drought Demon Fairy couldn’t leave the Fiend Tomb and was only frightened by my words. If I really rush up, I won’t be able to hide once she releases her Heavenly Fire…?Zhou Wen thought about it and felt that no matter which Calamity-grade he provoked in reality, it would be very dangerous.

After all, Calamity-grades had their own Calamity Zones, and only a few of them attacked individually.

Is there no Calamity-grade creature like the Dragon Turtle??Zhou Wen searched through his memories, hoping to find a suitable target.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen thought of a place—the Forbidden City he had previously been to.

Now, the owner of the Forbidden City was likely the one inside the log. From what Zhou Wen knew, she had the power of lightning and liked to use lightning for smiting.

That attack seemed dodgeable. With Zhou Wen’s lucky equipment and Heavenly Robe’s dodging abilities, he should be able to dodge it.

I nearly died last time. It’s time to settle this score.?Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he didn’t dare immediately head to Forbidden City.

After returning to the Overseer Manor, Zhou Wen went to find the antelope.

This guy was still lazy all day. Other than eating and sleeping, he did nothing else.

Bullets surrounded Zhou Wen. When he entered, the wall near the door instantly shattered. The antelope looked up at him and looked at the bullets in surprise.

“Ahem, Brother Antelope, have you been feeling better recently? Do you want me to buy you some supplements?” Zhou Wen said with a light cough.

“I can’t deal with the bullets around you. Find someone else.” The antelope lazily closed its eyes again.

“No, that’s not what I meant. I just want to ask you. Look at my equipment. Can I dodge the lightning from the fellow in Forbidden City?” Zhou Wen knew that the antelope knew a lot about that fellow. For safety’s sake, he decided to consult it.

“The Heavenly Robe can indeed dodge a Calamity-grade attack with high Luck, but it’s only limited to attacks that can be dodged. It’s useless against large-scale indiscriminate attacks…” The antelope seriously looked at Zhou Wen’s equipment and the six bullets before continuing, “The one from Forbidden City doesn’t just produce single-target attacks.”

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling somewhat disappointed, he heard the antelope say: “But it’s not like you don’t stand a chance. If your plan is good, your six bullets might really make her suffer.”

“What do you plan on doing?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. The antelope seemed to be putting way too much effort into this matter, so he stared at it warily. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The antelope chuckled. “I’m not afraid to tell you the truth. My injuries are too serious. I nearly lost my life back on Mount Laojun. Although I’ve recovered a little, the recovery process is too slow. Furthermore, without external help, it’s very difficult for me to fully recover. There are many good things in Forbidden City, and a few of them are of great help to my injuries. If you cooperate with me, how about we split the items obtained from Forbidden City equally?”

“What do you mean by even? I’m taking the risk and I have to fight her. All you need to do is speak theory and you want 50% of the spoils?” Zhou Wen naturally disagreed.

“Without me, there’s no chance of getting close to her. I’m providing key technology. As an investor providing the technology, 50% isn’t much,” the antelope said with a smile. “If you’re not afraid of death, you can try doing it yourself.”

“Tell me about the way to safely approach her?” Zhou Wen asked.

“It’s definitely impossible to fight her head-on. She can activate the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. When the time comes, you probably won’t even see her, let alone get close to her. It’s even a question if you can escape from the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.” The antelope lowered its voice and said, “The only way is to ambush her and use the power of the six bullets to finish her off when she’s unprepared.”

“Are you crazy? Sneak an attack on a Calamity-grade? Do you think it’s possible to do so undiscovered?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that it was as simple as the antelope said.

“You definitely can’t do it yourself. You need my help, so it’s really not much for me to take 50%,” the antelope said.

“What good things are in Forbidden City?” Zhou Wen wondered if he should take the risk.

“There are plenty. After Starlady Polestar returns to the Forbidden City, many hidden dimensional zones there will open…” The antelope’s saliva flew as it recounted what good things were inside.

Zhou Wen listened for a while and was really tempted.

“Alright, fifty-fifty. However, you have to tell me the complete plan first. I’ll decide if I want to go. If I do, I’ll definitely give you fifty percent.” Zhou Wen ultimately failed to resist the temptation.

The antelope was very straightforward as it told Zhou Wen its plan in detail.

…

The weather was terrible during this season in the capital. It was very dry, and there were dust storms. When the wind blew, one’s face would feel itchy because there was too much sand in the air.

Most people were unwilling to go out at this time. Even the shops by the roadside would mostly be closed, and the pedestrians would be in a hurry.

However, there was a blonde girl who looked to be twelve or thirteen years old on the street. Her body was abnormally clean as she slowly sauntered. As she walked, she looked around as if she was looking for something.

The girl was very beautiful. No matter how one looked at her, one could not find a single flaw. She was so perfect that she did not seem like a human. Instead, she looked like a work of art.

“Little girl, the sandstorm outside is strong. Come in and have a cup of milk tea to avoid the wind.” The owner of a milk tea shop seemed to have noticed the blonde girl very early on. When she walked past his shop, he opened the door against the wind and greeted her.

“Ahem, Brother Antelope, have you been feeling better recently? Do you want me to buy you some supplements?” Zhou Wen said with a light cough.
