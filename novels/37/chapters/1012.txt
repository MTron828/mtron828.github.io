Chapter 1013: Gaiman

Translator: CKtalon

In order to clear the Maze of Lies and obtain the mask inside, other than the experts from the Ultimate Family Clan, they also invited experts with Mythical Companion Beasts.

However, very few of these people were members of the six families. They were basically the leaders of the various wealthy families in the North District. In the East District, they were equivalent to An Tianzuo.

It could be seen that the Ultimate Family Clan was very prestigious in the North District. Furthermore, the wealthy families in the North District were united. They weren’t like the East and West District, where there was a lot of internal strife.

Although Frod was one of the six heroes, he was trapped in the ice cave and couldn’t move freely. Now, the true leader of the Ultimate Family Clan was Gaiman.

After all the invited experts arrived, Gaiman planned on holding a meeting to explain the general situation and introduce Zhou Wen to them.

As Zhou Wen had already said that he had to have the final say, Gaiman was the leader in this operation, but he still needed to listen to Zhou Wen on how to proceed.

“Inform Zhou Wen about the meeting tomorrow,” Gaiman said to his secretary. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The secretary responded but didn’t leave immediately.

“What’s the matter?” Gaiman looked at Gemar and asked.

“According to our observations over the past few days, Zhou Wen has only entered Friday’s Maze of Lies at most. He hasn’t entered the Maze of Lies on Sunday at all. Is it really good to give him veto powers? This concerns the fate of our Ultimate Family Clan,” Gemar said.

“Old Master naturally has his reasons for making such a decision. Furthermore, Zhou Wen is indeed a person with true talent. You saw the battle between him and Lie. To be able to defeat the Guardian without any external help, how many people in the Federation can do so?” Gaiman said.

“Zhou Wen is very strong, and it’s indisputable, but strength is different from being a commander. I’m afraid that problems will arise because of his decisions,” Gemar said.

“There’s no rush. We still have time to get used to each other and build teamwork. Deliver the news of the meeting.” After Gaiman said that, he lowered his head and continued working on his documents.

Gemar had no choice but to leave the office and arrange for someone to inform Zhou Wen of the meeting tomorrow.

After Zhou Wen received the notice of the meeting, he agreed readily. He already had a more detailed understanding of the Sunday dungeon, but he hadn’t found the mask that Frod had mentioned.

The Ultimate Family Clan still had some secret information regarding the Maze of Lies that hadn’t been released. The information would likely be announced at the meeting. Zhou Wen wanted to know how much they knew about the Sunday dungeon.

The next morning, Zhou Wen left with Ya’er. Just as he was about to attend the meeting, he saw a girl getting out of a car.

“Wang Lu? Why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu in pleasant surprise.

“Old Mister Gaiman invited me to help, so I came.” Wang Lu wore a white fox fur coat, making her baby-like skin appear even whiter.

Upon hearing Wang Lu’s words, Zhou Wen knew that the Ultimate Family Clan was very knowledgeable about the Maze of Lies on Sunday. Inviting Wang Lu was most likely to deal with the Destiny Witches.

“This operation is very dangerous. Why did you agree to come?” Zhou Wen frowned.

Wang Lu smiled and said, “Our family has quite a number of business dealings with the North District. Furthermore, Old Mister Gaiman has repeatedly guaranteed my safety. Furthermore, I heard that you are here and will be participating in this operation. What else do I have to worry about?”

“You can’t say that. It’s best to be careful. This dimensional zone is indeed very strange. You mustn’t be careless,” Zhou Wen exhorted.

“Sir, Madam, the family head is already waiting for you inside.” A staff member came over to welcome them.

The two of them chatted as they walked. Wang Lu was fine and things were very stable at her side. Although Wang Chan still had occasional incidents, with Wang Lu’s Life Providence suppressing her, nothing serious happened.

When the two of them entered the meeting hall, many people looked over.

In the entire meeting hall, only the two of them weren’t from the North District. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had recently killed Joseph, who had a Guardian. This had caused quite a stir in the North District.

Gaiman introduced the two of them to everyone at the right time. At the same time, he said, “When attacking the Maze of Lies, there are some key areas that require the help of the two of them. They are an indispensable part of this operation. This is because after entering the Maze of Lies, there’s no way to communicate with words. Therefore, before we go, there are some things that need to be explained clearly. We also need to practice and train for a period of time to prevent any problems from happening after entering the dimensional zone.”

After arranging for Zhou Wen and Wang Lu to sit down, Gaiman explained the detailed plan.

The Ultimate Family Clan knew a lot about the situation regarding Sunday’s dungeon. They also knew the abilities of the Devil Clown and the Destiny Witches and explained in detail.

From Gaiman’s description, Zhou Wen knew that they had paid the price of many lives to obtain this information.

However, their intelligence wasn’t much more than Zhou Wen’s, nor was it that detailed.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen realized that they hadn’t been able to pass the Destiny Witches’ trial to reach the garden at the back.

The reason they had invited Wang Lu all the way here was to deal with the Destiny Witches. Only then could they pass the witches to reach the final garden.

However, there was something that left Zhou Wen puzzled. Gaiman and company had clearly failed to pass the test of the Destiny Witches and reach the final garden.

Yet, they seemed to be very certain that the mask was behind Witch Castle. As long as they defeated the Destiny Witches, they would have a chance of obtaining the mask.

Strange, why didn’t I see that mask in the garden? Zhou Wen had already carefully searched the entire garden, but he didn’t discover the mask that Frod had mentioned.

As for the plan that Gaiman and the others had set up, it was all for the sake of passing Witch Castle. It would be fun if they couldn’t find the mask after entering the garden.

Furthermore, there was a Shapeshifting Beast in the garden. It was fine if Zhou Wen went in alone, and the rest of his team were Companion Beasts. Regardless of who the Shapeshifting Beast turned into, Zhou Wen could tell.

However, with so many people entering, it would be difficult to identify the Shapeshifting Beast if it transformed into anything outside Zhou Wen’s sphere of influence.

After explaining the plan, Gaiman asked Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, what do you think?”

The others also looked at Zhou Wen.

“I have a question. Since no one has defeated the witches, it means that no one has reached the place outside the ancient castle. How do you know that there must be a mask there?” Zhou Wen asked Gaiman.
