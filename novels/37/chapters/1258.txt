Chapter 1259: A Non-Existent Opponent

Translator: CKtalon

As large swaths of trees fell, a clearing appeared in the forest. Philo and company also heard the oppressive panting, but they couldn’t see anything.

“Terror creature?” The elder’s expression changed slightly.

However, Zhou Wen, Ice Maiden, and company knew that things weren’t that simple. If the other party was an ordinary Terror-grade creature, they would have long seen him. However, up to now, they couldn’t see anything either. Only the panting constantly echoed in their ears, as though there were wild beasts that had red eyes from killing.

Grim Demon emitted a terrifying demonic aura that surged towards the clearing in the forest like a tidal wave. Presumably, he didn’t see where the other party was and wanted to use this method to force him out.

However, after the surging demonic aura swept over, all the trees and vegetation were leveled, but they still didn’t discover traces of the other party. Only the extremely oppressive breathing could be heard from time to time, almost driving one crazy..

Zhou Wen had long activated Great Brahma and had been observing his surroundings, but he didn’t discover anything.

Grim Demon had rather rich combat experience. After his first probe failed, he immediately launched a second attack. However, this time, he didn’t use a large area-of-attack demonic aura. Instead, he roared at the sky and emitted a demonic sound that was filled with killing intent.

The demonic sound spread in all directions. When the elder, Philo, and company heard the demonic sound, they immediately covered their ears and fell to the ground. Soon, they began bleeding from their seven orifices as they rolled around in pain and let out tragic cries.

If this continued, their companions would die before they found the opponent. Zhou Wen had to get Grim Demon to stop the demonic aural attack.

Grim Demon had no choice but to stop. He frowned and said, “It’s not an invisibility ability. If it’s an invisibility ability, my demonic voice should have feedback when it touches it.”

Zhou Wen saw Philo and company crawl to their feet. Although they were in a sorry state, there wasn’t much of a problem. He knew that Grim Demon had deliberately controlled the lethality of the demonic sound. Otherwise, ordinary people like them would have died.

“It’s not an invisibility ability, but we can’t see it. What kind of ability is this?” Zhou Wen wasn’t asking Grim Demon, but thinking aloud to himself.

When Ice Maiden heard that, she said, “According to what I know, there are several possibilities. Creatures like Phantoms, Nightmares, and Ghosts can achieve such an effect. However, these creatures aren’t very aggressive and focus more on psyche attacks. The strike that destroyed the forest was an undiscounted strength-type attack. I can’t think of any creature that has both of these abilities.”

Zhou Wen didn’t expect it to be an ability, but he had his own way. He summoned his army of Musical Note Sprites as tens of thousands of them flew in all directions, covering all the nearby areas.

No matter what kind of creature it was, if it wanted to come over, it had to pass through the Musical Note Sprites. When the time came, it would naturally be exposed.

Seeing countless Musical Note Sprites cover a large area, Philo and the others felt a lot more at ease. At least in such a situation, they felt that it was safe in the Musical Note Sprites’ coverage.

Even if there was danger, it was the Musical Note Sprites that would be killed first.

However, they had clearly underestimated how terrifying the creature was. The Musical Note Sprites that produced the music weren’t touched, but a member of the team suddenly vanished.

The person had stood not far from the elder. In an instant, he had vanished as though he had learned instant transmission.

However, the terrifying panting that sounded in the elder’s ear made him realize that it wasn’t that the person had learned instant transmission, but that the terrifying creature had taken him away.

Zhou Wen, Ice Maiden, and Grim Demon had ugly expressions. He had vanished not far from them, but they hadn’t discovered the opponent.

Zhou Wen suspected that the other party was a tiny dimensional creature, but despite using Great Brahma’s Minute Subtlety observation ability, he didn’t discover any special microorganisms nearby.

“We have to leave this place immediately and split up,” Ice Maiden suggested.

They didn’t even know where the enemy was, so there was no way to fight this battle. They could only passively take a beating. If they stayed behind, only death awaited them.

“What’s the rush? If a few more people die, we will definitely be able to capture it,” Grim Demon said coldly. Such an opponent infuriated him.

The dead people he was referring to were naturally the guides. It wasn’t just Grim Demon. Zhou Wen and Ice Maiden could also tell that the creature didn’t prioritize its attack on them. Instead, it targeted the weaker guides. It was also apprehensive and likely wouldn’t attack them first.

Grim Demon naturally didn’t care about the lives of the guides.

If one was slow-witted, they definitely wouldn’t be able to survive for long while being a guide to the strange forest. The guides were all smart people, so how could they not know that staying behind would only lead to death? Without any hesitation, they ran back the way they came, hoping to escape.

Grim Demon wanted to stop them from escaping, but Zhou Wen stopped him.

“Come back.” Zhou Wen got Demonic Neonate to summon Grim Demon back. At the same time, he got Ice Maiden and Jade Rabbit to return to the Chaos Bead. Ya’er was also sent into the Chaos Bead.

Philo gritted her teeth and rushed towards the Time Hut. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Zhou Wen reached out and grabbed at the air, pulling Philo back and throwing her into the Chaos Bead.

Only Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate remained. The reason Zhou Wen did so was because he realized that Demonic Neonate seemed to be able to see the creature.

Demonic Neonate’s eyes kept turning. No panting could be heard after she looked at a spot.

“Can you see where that thing is?” Zhou Wen asked Demonic Neonate.

Demonic Neonate nodded slightly before shaking her head. “I can only sense its location. I can’t see it.”

“Left,” Demonic Neonate suddenly said.

Zhou Wen immediately understood and instant transmitted to the right.

Boom!

A huge hoof mark appeared where Zhou Wen had been. The deep pit that it created was the size of a room.

Zhou Wen held the Golden Battle God Spear in his hand and struck the hoofprint, but he failed to hit anything. He failed to sense the other party’s location.

“Behind,” Demonic Neonate said again.

Zhou Wen instant transmitted again. The spot he had been standing on was attacked again. It was as though something like a saber had slashed across the sky. The nearby trees were sliced apart like grass.

What the hell is this??Zhou Wen’s expression turned nasty. In such an intense battle, he was still unable to sense the other party’s existence.

However, the other party was clearly a creature with immense strength. It wasn’t a spirit body with weak offensive strength.

Thankfully, Demonic Neonate could sense the other party’s location and acted as Zhou Wen’s eyes. A special battle unfolded in the strange forest.
