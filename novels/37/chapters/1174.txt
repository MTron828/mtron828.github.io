Chapter 1175: Orphan

Clang! Clang!

Before Not Heaven could react, the antelope stomped down again. Not Heaven’s head exploded as blood and brain matter splattered everywhere.

Zhou Wen was dumbfounded as he stared blankly at the antelope. He felt as though curses were running through his mind.

Not Heaven didn’t revive this time. He could not be any more dead. With his death, the power that sealed Shinra Temple vanished and it returned to its original state.

“F*ck, if you could kill him, why didn’t you... stomp down earlier...” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but question the antelope.

The antelope glanced at him and said disdainfully, “Do you think he’s that easy to kill? If Tsukuyomi hadn’t severely injured him, I’m afraid all of you would have died here. It’s only because he had been suppressed for so long that his strength was far from its peak.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“It wouldn’t have been difficult to defeat him if you had joined forces with Tsukuyomi, right? Why did hold out, forcing Tsukuyomi to leave Earth?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Isn’t it the same? There’s no difference. Anyway, Tsukuyomi had to leave. It’s something that was bound to happen sooner or later. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for not retaining her.” The antelope curled its lips and walked out of the Shinra Temple.

Zhou Wen glanced at Not Heaven’s corpse on the ground. It looked very similar to a human’s corpse.

When Tsukuyomi was around, Zhou Wen had thought of all sorts of methods, hoping to escape her and let her leave Earth early. But now that she was gone, Zhou Wen felt a little odd.

When he walked out of Shinra Temple, he realized that there were already many people outside. They were likely members of the Dugu family. The leader was a person with white hair, but his face made it appear as though he was thirty. He was likely the hero of the Dugu family, Nameless Dugu.

Of course, this was only one of the two Nameless Dugu. Zhou Wen didn’t know if he was the elder or younger brother.

Zhou Wen’s guess was right. It was Nameless Dugu. He walked into Shinra Temple alone and took Zhou Wen to a secret chamber in the Dugu family.

“Brother Zhou, I believe you have already learned about my brother,” said Nameless Dugu with a sigh.

“Yes, a little, but I’m not too sure of the details. Furthermore, I’m not interested in these things, so I won’t shoot my mouth. All I want to know now is where Worm Dugu is.” Zhou Wen made his stance clear.

Nameless Dugu continued, “Qianqiu and I were twins. It was an era of foolishness. In our village, twins were an ominous symbol, just like Gu. In a Gu container, only one poisonous bug can survive to the end and turn into a Gu. As long as a second one is alive, they will continue fighting. Therefore, when we were born, the elders in the family wanted to drown one of the babies.”

“Perhaps he wasn’t destined to die. The drowning baby was accidentally saved by someone and luckily survived.” Nameless Dugu told a very long story.

Zhou Wen originally didn’t care about the Dugu family’s matters, but as he listened, he couldn’t help but be attracted by the story.

He wasn’t interested in the love and hate between the two brothers, but later, Nameless Dugu mentioned their entry into the Holy Land.

The two brothers had entered the Trajectory Holy Temple. Zhou Wen had also entered the temple and experienced many strange things there.

The Ah Lai that Li Xuan had taken in had come out of the Trajectory Holy Temple. However, there was no such person among the people who had entered the Holy Land.

The Dugu brothers’ encounter in the Trajectory Holy Temple was equally bizarre. However, after they entered the Trajectory Holy Temple, they didn’t see each other despite being inside.

Nameless Dugu only knew what he had experienced in the Trajectory Holy Temple. He had only heard what his younger brother had experienced later. However, he was unable to determine the truth.

However, ever since they had left the Trajectory Holy Temple, his younger brother no longer showed his true face to others. Furthermore, he had convinced Nameless Dugu to share the same identity—Nameless Dugu, one of the six heroes of the Federation.

Nameless Dugu was good at movement techniques, but not only was his younger brother good at movement techniques, he also had the ability to use the Soul-Washing Divine Light. He had even broken through to the Mythical stage.

Nameless Dugu originally imagined that his brother was talented, but he later learned that it was because his brother had signed some agreement in the Trajectory Holy Temple and obtained the help of the Holy Temple that he absorbed a Guardian to advance to the Mythical stage.

“After leaving the Trajectory Holy Temple, my brother’s actions became weirder and weirder. Furthermore, many of the things he did were incomprehensible to me. I secretly paid attention to him. Later, I realized that he secretly nurtured many orphans.” When Nameless Dugu said that, he wore a strange expression.

“What’s so special about those orphans?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

“In the beginning, there wasn’t anything special. I thought that he only wanted to nurture a faction that belonged to him, so I didn’t take it to heart. However, as those orphans grew up, I gradually discovered something extremely terrifying.” Nameless Dugu’s expression was extremely complicated. It was indescribable.

“What happened to those orphans?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked. He was also very curious.

“Nothing happened to the orphans. They were very normal. The abnormality was with the Federation,” said Nameless Dugu.

Zhou Wen was infuriated when he heard that. He thought to himself, Can’t you finish what happened in one go?

Nameless Dugu continued with a strange expression, “In the beginning, I didn’t pay too much attention to it. Later, the Federation developed very smoothly. Stabilizing our families and expelling those devils were many things that we needed to do. However, I’d never seen my brother use the orphans he raised. I found it odd. After spending so much time and effort to nurture so many orphans, it’s definitely impossible for him to just keep them without doing anything. However, twenty to thirty years have passed. I’ve never seen those orphans appear. Don’t you think it’s strange?”

“Could it be that he has secretly sent them away without your knowledge?” Zhou Wen asked.

“That’s what I thought too, so I went to take a look again. The orphans were still there, and not only had their numbers not dropped, but there were even more. Some of them had already grown up, while some were still children. The oldest were in their thirties or forties, and the youngest were only a few months old. When I saw the faces of the older ones, I was stunned.” Nameless Dugu seemed to sink into his memories as he revealed a look of lingering fear.

Zhou Wen wished he could tear open the top of Nameless Dugu’s head to see what was on his mind.

Without making Zhou Wen wait too long, Nameless Dugu continued, “Those few people’s faces were very similar to many of the famous people in the Federation back then. I wouldn’t just call it similar, but identical. Those people were top figures in the various fields of the Federation. Some were experts in certain areas, while others were Senators of the Senate...”

Zhou Wen felt his blood run cold when he heard that, but it also rang a bell.
