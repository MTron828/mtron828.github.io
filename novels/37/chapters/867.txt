Chapter 868: Underground Imperial City

He needed to deal Jing Daoxian a fatal strike and not give him a chance to counterattack; otherwise, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to withstand the Terror-grade Yin Yang Mirror.

Without full confidence, Zhou Wen could only feign civility and listen to Jing Daoxian’s instructions.

The three of them sat on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back. Zhou Wen controlled the Earth Elemental Beast and used the coordinates Jing Daoxian had mentioned to let it drill into the Founding Emperor Tomb.

The Earth Elemental Beast phased away with the trio and burrowed into the ground. When Zhou Wen’s vision recovered, he realized that the Earth Elemental Beast’s body had landed atop a huge stone pillar.

The stone pillar was more than four meters in diameter and more than thirty meters tall. Beneath the stone pillar, there was silver liquid flowing slowly.

In the huge underground world, there was a huge stone pillar every few hundred meters. However, the stone pillars were connected to the stone ceiling. Only the stone pillar they were standing on was halved.

In the entire underground world, other than the stone pillar, there was only silver liquid. If the Earth Elemental Beast’s Earth Escape had deviated slightly, they would have fallen into the silver liquid.

Seeing Zhou Wen and Liu Yun look at the silver liquid below, Jing Daoxian said, “That liquid is mercury. It’s very poisonous to humans, but this mercury shouldn’t be much considering our physiques. It can’t harm our bodies. However, after the dimensionalization, there’s a now terrifying dimensional creature in the mercury. If we fall into the mercury, even I might not be able to come out alive.”

“What dimensional creature is that?” Zhou Wen asked.

“See for yourself,” said Jing Daoxian. He summoned a mouse-like beast and let it fall into the mercury.

The little beast bobbed up and down over the silver liquid’s surface twice. The surrounding mercury suddenly gathered towards the little beast, turning into a strange creature that looked like a snake with wings on its back. It swallowed the little beast in one mouthful.

When the little beast touched its saliva, its body immediately festered as though it had melted.

Zhou Wen and Liu Yun were alarmed when they saw the instant devouring of the tiny beast. The mercury-like monster’s aura was extremely shocking. It was definitely at the Mythical stage.

“You don’t have to worry too much. As long as you don’t touch the mercury, you won’t alarm it.” As Jing Daoxian spoke, he summoned a bird and sat on its back before flying deep into the underground world.

Zhou Wen unsummoned the Earth Elemental Beast and summoned a flying mount just like Liu Yun did. They flew deep into the underground world with Jing Daoxian.

“Legend has it that the Founding Emperor Tomb is extremely dangerous. From the looks of it, it’s nothing much.” Liu Yun looked around but didn’t find anything dangerous.

“We haven’t even entered the Founding Emperor Tomb’s main entrance,” Jing Daoxian said indifferently.

Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener to scan the area in front of him. He could already see a huge metal door at the end of the Mercury Sea. In the middle of the metal door was a flat opening that looked like it would fit an ancient sword.

Soon, the three of them arrived at the door. Jing Daoxian pointed at the gap and said, “Insert the Emperor Qin Sword in. After opening this door, we will truly enter the Founding Emperor Tomb.”

Liu Yun was somewhat hesitant, but his life was still in Jing Daoxian’s hands. He had no choice but to walk over with the Emperor Qin Sword. After ensuring that he was 100% protected, he carefully inserted the Emperor Qin Sword.

When the Emperor Qin Sword was completely inserted, the three of them heard a cracking sound.

Liu Yun flew back like lightning, but the door slowly opened, revealing the scene behind it.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel shocked when he saw the scene inside. Behind the door was a huge ancient city. There was a stretch of ancient palace complexes in the ancient city, and there were many bronze men with weapons standing on both sides of the street. There were even a few bronze carriage statues standing in the middle of the street.

At the end of the long street, there were twelve golden men sitting in front of the majestic temple-like palace. Each golden man was thirty feet tall when sitting, as though they were golden divine generals guarding the palace.

Whoosh!

The moment the trio stepped through the door, the bronze men on the long street raised their weapons and looked at Zhou Wen and company.

These bronze men were very similar to the Bronze Men at the periphery of the mausoleum. However, the Bronze Men at the periphery of the mausoleum were typically bare-handed and did not carry any weapons. As for the bronze men here, each of them held a spear or sword.

With the sound of the bronze swords being unsheathed, groups of bronze men charged at Zhou Wen and company.

“Leave the mere bronze men to me.” Liu Yun took the initiative to charge forward.

Bronze Men Companion Eggs were rare to begin with, and these bronze men had weapons. If a few Companion Beasts dropped, their value would definitely be rather high.

However, after Liu Yun rushed in, he realized that the bronze men were like warriors who had been battle-hardened. They advanced in rows and formed a battle formation, constantly attacking the encircled Liu Yun.

Thankfully, Liu Yun’s movement technique was extremely powerful. His fast hands flashed repeatedly as he snatched the white blades with his bare hands, snatching all the weapons from the bronze men nearby.

Crack! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A bronze man was beheaded by Liu Yun with a bronze sword. Liu Yun charged all the way as though he had entered a no man’s zone. Be it his movement techniques or offensive techniques, they were all excellent. Even an army of thousands seemed unable to trap him.

After killing dozens of bronze men, a Companion Egg dropped.

Liu Yun’s was really fast. Before the Companion Egg landed, he had grabbed it.

Just as Liu Yun was about to kill more bronze men, he suddenly saw one of the golden men stand up. The golden man, who was thirty feet tall when sitting, looked even more majestic when he stood up.

The golden man stepped on the stone steps and walked down the long street. His speed became faster and faster. After a few steps, he was like a charging lion. When he was a hundred meters away from Liu Yun, he leaped up and struck down at him.

Liu Yun didn’t hesitate either. He summoned his Companion Beast and transformed it into a bracer that wrapped around his fist and arm. Then, without retreating at all, he clashed with the golden man’s huge fist.

Boom!

When the two fists collided, Liu Yun immediately flew back and fell to the ground. He rolled far away and slammed into the city wall behind him before stopping.

“Junior Brother... That’s the end of the road for me... I’ll leave the rest to you... You have to get out alive...” Liu Yun struggled a few times but failed to get up. Blood kept flowing out of his mouth. Just as he finished speaking, he fell to the ground. There was no heartbeat or breathing. It looked like he was dead.

Jing Daoxian grabbed the Emperor Qin Sword and stabbed it into his thigh. Liu Yun remained motionless; there was no reaction from his muscles.

“From the looks of it, he’s really dead. Don’t waste a perfectly good body. Dig out his heart and use it for food.” As Jing Daoxian spoke, he was about to stab Liu Yun’s chest.

“Cough, cough... I... I can still be saved...” Liu Yun suddenly sat up again. His heartbeat and breathing were back as he laughed dryly.
