Chapter 1635 Fighting for the Companion Egg

The five Calamity creatures from before were surrounding the egg-shaped object. The blue ribbon of light circled above. The two unicorn wolves occupied the left side, and the strange fish was on the right.

Far away from Jiuyang and company was the ball of magnetic storms. From time to time, tentacles would extend out as though they wanted to sweep away the white egg-shaped object, but they didn’t seem to dare. They quickly shrank back.

Jiuyang and Xiao’s arrival immediately alarmed the Calamity creatures. They constantly sized them up. Once they realized that they were too weak or had any weaknesses, they would probably immediately attack to reduce their competitors. “Can you see the situation inside?” Jiuyang asked Xiao when he saw that the Calamity creatures seemed to be afraid of each other and didn’t take the initiative to attack them.

His combat strength was very strong, but he was far inferior to Xiao’s proficiency in some special techniques.

Xiao’s eyes suffused a demonic glow as his pupils turned white. He resembled a pupil-less blind man.

After staring at the white egg-shaped object for a few seconds, Xiao’s eyes returned to normal. He looked at Jiuyang and shook his head. “I can’t see what’s inside. I can only sense that there’s a lifeform inside.”

“It shouldn’t be wrong. This is the core of the planet. The planet’s Companion Beast should be hatching here. I reckon the rift abyss we entered is the path opened up by the parasitic Companion Beast when it rushed in,” Jiuyang guessed after some thought.

“That’s right, but those five Calamity creatures don’t look simple. It probably won’t be easy to snatch the Companion Beast inside from their jaws. Furthermore, the Companion Beast inside can appear at any time. When the time comes, we won’t just be facing five Calamity creatures,” Xiao said.

“Act according to plan then. Contract the Companion Beast before it appears, or kill it ahead of time,” Jiuyang said.

“Don’t be anxious. If we go over now, we will probably be besieged by those Calamity creatures.” Xiao shook his head slightly, gesturing for Jiuyang not to go over for the time being

“Being Calamity-grade creatures, their intelligence can’t be too low. Even some creatures with low intelligence have already accumulated quite a bit of experience and intuition. No one wants to become the target of the masses, but they don’t know that if that Companion Beast appears, it will be difficult to say who ends up as the meal,” Jiuyang said with a cold snort when he saw that none of the five Calamity creatures were willing to charge forward.

“Therefore, we have to think of a way to incite them,” Xiao said as he looked at the white egg-shaped object.

“How?” Jiuyang asked. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Just wait here for me. I’m better at incitement.” As Xiao spoke, he took a step forward and vanished like a ghost.

When he appeared again, he was already in front of the white egg-shaped object. He extended his hand and slapped it.

Pa!

Xiao was the closest to the electromagnetic storm. Before he could touch the white egg-shaped object, the tentacles in the electromagnetic storm flailed wildly. Every tentacle carried a terrifying electromagnetic storm, causing the electromagnetic storm that only covered its body to spread out and envelop half the planet’s core.

Before the electromagnetic storm landed on Xiao, he easily turned around and vanished. Large swaths of the electromagnetic storm missed him while most of the electromagnetic storms landed on the white egg-shaped object. With a series of crackling sounds, the white egg-like object rapidly shrank to about half its original size as though it had been injured.

With this, the other four Calamity creatures were immediately unable to sit idle. All of them carried terrifying domain powers, hoping to control the white egg-shaped object in their domains.

The black-and-white wolves’ domains were very strange. The black wolf’s domain power was a black barrier, while the white wolf’s domain power was a white barrier.

When they stood together, the intersection of the black and white barriers turned transparent as though it had vanished.

The strange fish flicked its tail, and its graceful tail that resembled a cloud blotting out the sky covered the white egg-shaped object from all directions.

The blue ribbon of light was even more direct. With a flash, it wrapped around the white egg-shaped object.

Apart from the strange fish’s domain power being relatively slow, the domain powers of the other four Calamity creatures descended almost at the same time. Together with the Calamity creature that had used the electromagnetic storm, all sorts of domain powers intertwined, instantly producing a terrifying explosion.

All sorts of forces constantly collided, producing continuous explosions and shockwaves. The entire space shook as cracks appeared on the hard rocks that supported the interior space of the planet. Extremely hard rocks constantly fell.

The five Calamity creatures were sent flying. No one could snatch the white egg-shaped object.

“Such powerful destructive power failed to break its outer shell and deal a certain level of damage to it!” Xiao had hidden behind Jiuyang at some point in time and said with a smile.

The Sun God Light on Jiuyang’s body bloomed and blocked the shockwaves that surged at them. He said in surprise, “Two of these five Calamity creatures seem to be at the Heaven level. The other three are also powerful Hell-level creatures. Furthermore, the domain powers of the three Hell-level creatures are very special.” “Those at the Hell level are fine, but it’s probably hard to tell if we can handle the Heaven-level ones,” Xiao said as his expression suddenly changed. In the middle of the explosion, the white egg-shaped object shrank to the height of a person. The membrane that was almost transparent had turned into the color of milk. It looked much thicker.

Most importantly, the terrifying energy blast from before failed to injure it.

“What kind of Companion Beast is this planet’s original Companion Beast? Is its eggshell’s defense that high that two Heaven-level and three Hell-level forces failed to injure it at all?” Xiao frowned.

“From the looks of it, your incitement sucked.” Jiuyang wasn’t looking at the white egg-shaped object. Instead, he was looking at the few Calamity creatures because they were in a brawl.

The monster in the electromagnetic storm and the strange fish were clearly at the Heaven level. Their strength was extremely terrifying. The black and white wolves were probably still at the Hell level, but when their domain powers were stacked together, they could actually withstand the power of a Heaven-level creature. They weren’t taken advantage of by the strange fish and the monster in the electromagnetic storm.

The blue ribbon-like Calamity creature was likely at the Hell level, but its strength was extremely strange. It shuttled through the various domains without being too affected.

The five monsters fought each other, hoping to snatch the white egg-shaped object and have a good meal. However, in the battle, they didn’t notice that tiny cracks had appeared on the white egg-shaped object.
