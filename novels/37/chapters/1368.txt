Chapter 1369: The Sunlight Here Is Too Glaring

Countless sword beams condensed into something corporeal as if a galaxy was pouring out and colliding with the terrifying beam of light.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The sound of steel nails piercing wooden planks sounded. Countless sword beams tore through the beam of light and surged upward, shattering the beam of light.

The noble and terrifying figure—which resembled a thousand-armed and thousand-eyed Bodhisattva—instantly shattered like glass under the countless sword beams’ impact.

“Ah!” Under the assault of countless sword beams, Hermit’s body was drowned by the sword stream. His tragic scream stopped just as his body and his Guardian armor shattered and dissipated in the torrent.

The terrifying Bodhisattva’s figure vanished. Only the galaxy-like sword stream revolved around Zhou Wen like a dazzling star.

Cave Era was horrified. She had never seen such a terrifying attack at the Terror level in her life. Even Immortal probably didn’t have such terrifying destructive power.

Hermit’s thousand-handed, thousand-eyed power was considered top-notch destructive power at the Terror grade, but it was as weak as tofu around Zhou Wen’s sword stream. What terrifying power was this?

Without any hesitation, Cave Era used her temporal powers and instantly vanished. She didn’t dare stay another second.

Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array had already scared her guts out.

“Hermit, one of the four Heavenly Kings, is nothing much. Can’t he last a little longer?” Zhou Wen said in disappointment.

He said such a thing because he hadn’t considered that using the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array was no longer a one-on-one battle. It was equivalent to countless Terror-grade creatures ganking Hermit. It would be strange if Hermit could withstand them.

Wei Ge looked at Zhou Wen and couldn’t help but shake his head and smile bitterly. He thought to himself, I originally thought that I had done extremely well over the years and might have a chance to compete with this fellow. I never expected this fellow to have already reached this stage…

“President, I really have to thank you for this. If you hadn’t sent the news in time, I probably wouldn’t have been able to rush back in time. Without you attracting the bhikkhuni to finish off the undead in the city, Luoyang would have suffered heavy losses. I wonder how many people would have died.” Zhou Wen still used the title he used to address Wei Ge in school instead of using his present official title. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“There’s no need to thank me. I’m just doing what I want to do to satisfy my selfish desires. Saving them was only in passing.” Wei Ge looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “You should be advancing to the Calamity grade soon, right?”

Calamity??Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback before he shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “Let’s not even talk about the Calamity grade, I don’t even know how to advance to the Terror grade.”

“You… are still at the Mythical stage?” Wei Ge was stunned as he looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief.

Zhou Wen nodded. “I also want to advance to the Terror grade, but I haven’t been able to do so.”

Wei Ge looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression. After a while, he sighed and said, “You advanced to the Mythical stage as a human?”

Zhou Wen nodded again. “Yes, this path is too difficult. I’m still figuring it out.”

“Continue on. I’m beginning to look forward to the day you advance to the Terror grade.” With that said, Wei Ge turned around and left.

“Where are you going? Why don’t you stay in Luoyang?” Zhou Wen extended an invitation.

Wei Ge had helped Luoyang through the calamity and completely severed ties with the League of Guardians. It was too dangerous for him to return now. The League of Guardians probably wouldn’t let him off.

Wei Ge looked at the sky and said indifferently, “Devils can survive anywhere, even in hell. Besides, I don’t like sunlight. The sunlight here is too blinding.”

Sunlight… Blinding… Zhou Wen looked up at the sky. It seemed to be nighttime, and it was cloudy. There wasn’t even a moon.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, Wei Ge vanished into the distance. Only the specks of smoke from his flaming robe hadn’t completely dissipated, like fireflies.

Zhou Wen shook his head. He had discovered a very serious problem.

None of the students from their generation who had graduated from Sunset College seemed to be a sociable bunch. Apart from Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan who were considered to be close, most of them were from different factions. There was no talk of cooperation.

After Luoyang’s calamity was over, Zhou Wen returned to Overseer Manor.

Sweetie had followed Zhou Wen to Overseer Manor. Zhou Wen had no choice but to get An Sheng to take good care of her, but he definitely couldn’t let anyone touch her.

However, An Sheng didn’t give Sweetie special attention. He treated her like any ordinary guest. He didn’t even prepare the desserts that Zhou Wen wanted him to prepare for her.

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, and when he asked An Sheng why he was doing this, An Sheng only told him, “You won’t find it sweet if you add too much sugar.”

Zhou Wen thought for a while before finding An Sheng’s words interesting.

“Why don’t I see Ice Maiden and Nether Lotus?” Zhou Wen had been somewhat puzzled as to why he hadn’t seen them. However, there had been too many things on his plate that he hadn’t had the time to ask.

“They previously helped suppress Chess Mountain, but they recently disappeared. They must have entered Chess Mountain,” An Sheng said.

“They entered after all?” Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised.

Ice Maiden wanted the Demon God Bloodline Catalog, while Nether Lotus wanted to enter to take the strongest Companion Beast on Earth. It would be strange if they could remain well-behaved.

However, with their strength, they couldn’t cause much of a stir in Chess Mountain. Now, Zhou Wen was afraid that the two of them would end up in The Thearch’s hands.

“Forget it. Let them be.” Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered anymore.

Now, the most pressing matter for him was the advancement to the Terror grade. He still needed to master the infinite spatial circulation skill. Otherwise, it would be impossible to kill the Calamity-grade in the Venusian instance dungeon.

Slaughterer, Slaughterer, how do you advance??Zhou Wen had killed quite a number of high-level creatures, but he had been unable to trigger Slaughterer’s growth. This made Zhou Wen suspect that it wasn’t as simple as killing to advance Slaughterer to the Terror grade.

Since killing doesn’t work, I might as well change my train of thought.?Zhou Wen felt that he had to find another way out.

Sweetie’s question gave Zhou Wen a headache. With such a time bomb by his side, no one knew when it would explode. It would be very troublesome when that happened.

Should I give it a try and eat that lemon candy??Zhou Wen was already tempted.

It was just too difficult for him to advance. If the lemon candy could really advance him, all the difficulties would be resolved.

However, after some thought, Zhou Wen gave up on the idea.

Firstly, Sweetie had been following him the entire time. If he took out the lemon candy, it was hard to guarantee that Sweetie wouldn’t discover it immediately and give him no chance to eat it.

Secondly, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that if he couldn’t truly understand Slaughterer, it would be a hidden danger even if he advanced to the Terror grade.

“Young Master Wen, Chancellor Leng has invited you over,” An Sheng knocked on the door and said.

“Why is Chancellor Leng looking for me?” Zhou Wen opened the door and asked in surprise.

“I don’t know. However, Chancellor Leng doesn’t like to be disturbed. Even a proud student like Overseer won’t have an easy time meeting him. There’s no harm in meeting him,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen felt that An Sheng was right, so he followed the address An Sheng had given him to Leng Zongzheng’s residence.
