Chapter 216 Trajectory Crystal

There was no concept of north or south, east or west here. Zhou Wen carefully observed his surroundings for a long time, but he failed to discover any differences. All he could do was choose one.

It was no longer within Zhou Wen’s consideration whether he could pass the trial. All he wanted was to leave quickly and leave the Holy Land before getting the League’s authorities to investigate Ah Lai’s origins.

Every person who entered the Holy Land had their information recorded. If he had entered with the rest of them, information about him was definitely available.

If there’s no information about him... The corners of Zhou Wen’s eyes twitched when he thought of this.

The road seemed endless as it extended to the end of the horizon. After more than an hour of walking, the surrounding scenery remained unchanged.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen realized that there was something different in front of him. He quickened his pace and continued proceeding. He discovered that there was another crossroad ahead of him—it didn’t seem different from the one he had set off from. The only difference was that there was another stone statue in the middle of the crossroad. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The stone statue was a three to four meter tall root. The four sides of the stone statue were faces. The face that faced Zhou Wen said, “Congratulations, Human. You have completed the test and can become the representative of the Trajectory Holy Temple in the mortal world.”

The moment the stone statue said that, Zhou Wen felt a strong sense of aversion from the Sigh of the King. Even his emotions were affected.

Zhou Wen suppressed his emotions and looked at the stone face, saying, “Sorry, I don’t plan on becoming the representative of the Trajectory Holy Temple. I only wanted to get my friend out and accidentally entered.”

Zhou Wen secretly cursed inwardly. It’s clearly you who forcefully pulled me in. Besides, how is this a trial? It’s a forced selection.

“Since you are already here, why don’t you consider it? As the representative of my Trajectory Holy Temple in the mortal world, not only will you obtain a Trajectory Holy Body, you will also obtain a Mythical Companion Beast that’s compatible with it,” added the stone face.

“Thank you for the offer, but I already have my own goals. The Trajectory Holy Temple isn’t my choice. Please open the door and let us leave this place.” Zhou Wen increasingly felt that this fellow was up to no good. One who was unreasonably solicitous was definitely hiding evil intentions.

The stone face didn’t say anything else. Its originally expressionless face slowly turned stiff, turning into a lifeless stone statue.

Zhou Wen shouted a few more times, but the stone statue didn’t react at all as though it was just an ordinary stone statue.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment before circling around the stone statue and continuing forward. After walking for some time, another crossroad appeared in front of him. In the middle of the crossroad was the four-faced stone pillar.

Zhou Wen surveyed his surroundings and felt that this was the crossroad that he had previously arrived at. He couldn’t help but frown slightly, but the stone statue remained silent. All he could do was switch directions before continuing forward.

Soon, Zhou Wen realized that no matter where he went, he would ultimately return to the four-faced stone pillar, as though this place was an endless cycle.

“Why are we still here?” Ah Lai, who was on the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant’s back, woke up as he rubbed his eyes.

Zhou Wen looked at Ah Lai and suddenly had a thought. “You previously said that there was a ship inside the Trajectory Holy Temple when you entered?”

“Yes, a ship, one identical to the one my father worked on,” Ah Lai answered.

“Did you board your father’s ship before?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“I did. On the first day after graduation from high school, my dad took me onto the ship,” answered Ah Lui.

“Then take a careful look. Have you been here before? Have you seen it before?” Zhou Wen pointed at the four-faced stone pillar.

Ah Lai looked at it for a while before answering with certainty, “No, I’ve never seen it.”

After Zhou Wen heard that, he seemed to understand something as he secretly frowned in thought. Based on Ah Lai’s situation, the people who entered the Trajectory Holy Temple will be trapped in their memories. However, since Ah Lai has never been here before and has never seen the four-faced stone pillars, this might be my memory. However, I’ve never been to such a place before, right?

Guide City, where Zhou Wen was born, was a flat plain. Even if there were large swaths of flat land, they were farmland. It was impossible for there to be such a large grassland. Zhou Wen was certain that he had never been here before.

After a moment of silence, Zhou Wen suddenly drew his Bamboo Blade and slashed at the four-faced stone statue.

The Bamboo Blade was extremely sharp, splitting the stone statue into two upon contact. The broken stone statue vanished with a poof.

The roads and plains around him vanished as well. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but break out into cold sweat when he saw the scene in front of him.

He was indeed standing at a crossroads, but this crossroad was not built on grasslands, but built on a volcano lava pool.

If Zhou Wen hadn’t walked along the path and stepped onto the plains, he would probably have fallen into the lava pool.

In the middle of the crossroads, there was a stone platform with a black seed floating above it. It was like the condensation of night, emitting a strange and mysterious aura.

This aura was similar to the Sun God Crystal he had previously obtained, but there were differences.

Zhou Wen attempted to grab the seed with his hand, but nothing special happened. He easily removed the black seed.

Boom!

The moment the black seed was removed by Zhou Wen, the entire temple quaked as the door opened once again. Zhou Wen saw Li Xuan standing outside.

He quickly took Ah Lu out of the temple with him. As expected, a bright light was shining from the Trajectory Holy Temple. The various engravings emitted a strange black fog, a sign that the Trajectory Holy Temple had selected an heir.

From then on, the Trajectory Holy Temple would shut its doors until the Holy Land opened again.

“Old Zhou, don’t you have a body that matches the Sun God Temple? How did you pass the Trajectory Holy Temple’s trial?” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen in astonishment.

“I don’t know what’s going on either. I find it a little baffling.” Zhou Wen looked at the black seed in his hand and felt that something was amiss.

He felt that the black seed had been given to him by the temple itself and not something he had obtained from a real trial. At least, he was not trapped in his memories.

Zhou Wen even suspected that what the four-faced stone statue had said wasn’t a test or an illusion, but to genuinely rope him in.

“Why bother? It’s better to have something than nothing. If the six families learn that you have actually obtained the recognition of two temples, their expressions will be very interesting.” Li Xuan chuckled.

“There’s nothing to show off about.” Zhou Wen made Li Xuan watch over Ah Lai as he secretly snapped a picture of the black seed on his cell phone, sending it into the game.

He had a strange feeling that the Trajectory Holy Temple was odd, so he didn’t dare absorb the black seed directly.
