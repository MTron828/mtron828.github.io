Chapter 696: Li Mobai’s Information

Translator: CKtalon

In a private room at Elegant Peace Restaurant.

“After you.” Li Mobai carefully brewed a cup of tea and placed it in front of Zhou Wen, gesturing for him to drink it.

“Just say it directly,” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai without drinking it.

Li Mobai didn’t mind. As he continued brewing tea, he said, “Zhou Wen, do you know what the most terrifying power in this world is?”

“I don’t know,” Zhou Wen answered.

Li Mobai continued, “The most terrifying power in this world is to be able to see something but not be able to obtain it. For example, having an enemy who killed your father and stole your wife right in front of you. You can see him every day. You can see him smile, watch him go crazy, and watch him enjoy all the riches and glory in the world. However, you can’t hurt even a single strand of his hair. This is more unbearable than any physical pain.”

“Second Young Master, I’m an ordinary student. I don’t understand such profound principles. If you wish to discuss philosophy, I’m afraid you’ve found the wrong person,” Zhou Wen said.

Li Mobai brewed a cup of tea for himself and took a sip before pouring away the remaining tea.

“Now, there are two things I can see but can’t obtain. One thing is the life of my enemy, and the other is a cocoon.” Li Mobai put down his cup and continued, “Ever since John challenged you with the six-winged seraphim, I’ve been trying my best to figure out what kind of power it is. In the end, I managed to find the answer, the cocoon of a Guardian.”

Zhou Wen silently waited for Li Mobai to continue. Li Mobai definitely didn’t invite him here to talk about this.

“Perhaps the heavens pitied a half-crippled person like me and allowed me to find a Guardian cocoon. However, there are terrifying Mythical creatures guarding it. I spent a lot of effort and paid a huge price, but I failed to even approach it.” Li Mobai looked at Zhou Wen and said, “But you are different. You have the ability to help me approach it.”

“Why should I help you?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Because you can bet on a one-third possibility,” Li Mobai said with a smile.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand what Li Mobai meant.

“According to what I know, a Guardian like the six-winged seraphim wouldn’t casually reach an agreement with a human. Instead, it depends on whether that person manages to obtain their recognition. I know where the Guardian cocoon is, and you have the ability to get us near it. Each of us will have one chance. I’ll have a go first. If I don’t succeed, it will be your chance. Of course, it’s also possible that we won’t be able to obtain its recognition, but you have at least a one-third chance, right?” Li Mobai said.

Zhou Wen fell silent. He was naturally interested in the Guardian cocoon. Not only was he interested, but he also wished he could immediately find one.

However, he didn’t want to obtain the Guardian’s recognition, but to kill it.

However, Zhou Wen knew very well that every Guardian had terrifying strength. They were top-notch existences among Mythical creatures. He didn’t know if his strength could kill the Guardian.

Li Mobai continued, “The Guardian cocoon I discovered is in the South District. It’s where I obtained my Essence Energy Art. According to my speculation, since I could obtain the Essence Energy Art there and condense the Evil King Gu Life Soul, perhaps it might be compatible with the Guardian cocoon, elevating my chances of success. Unfortunately, my foundation has been destroyed and I’ve already cultivated another Essence Energy Art. This is also where I’m at a disadvantage. In short, my chances are very high. It’s not like you don’t have a chance. Do you want to take a gamble? The decision lies with you.”

“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll snatch your chance?” Zhou Wen said to Li Mobai.

Li Mobai laughed. “Just as I said, I can’t do anything while watching my enemy live a carefree life. Now, I’m living a life worse than death. If it were you, would you be willing to take the risk?”

“I need time to consider it,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“That’s fine. You can take your time to consider it. I can wait.” Li Mobai said to Butterfly, “Take Zhou Wen back.”

“There’s no need. I can go myself.” Zhou Wen got up and left Elegant Peace Restaurant.

On the way back, Zhou Wen kept considering the proposal.

A Guardian cocoon was difficult to find. If what Li Mobai said was true, it was worth taking a look. Li Mobai had a chance, but he might not succeed.

However, Li Mobai was someone who could do anything for revenge. Zhou Wen didn’t dare trust him.

When he returned to school, he realized that An Sheng was waiting for him outside.

“Young Master Wen, the selection of treasure chests in the maze has been prepared. When do you plan on going?” An Sheng directly explained his intentions.

“Let’s do it now.” Zhou Wen also wanted to resolve this matter as soon as possible.

The world was changing at an increasing pace. Who knew if there would be a chance to go in the future? It was best to go early before the dimensional zone’s seals completely collapsed.

“I share the same thoughts. Get in.” An Sheng opened the car door and let Zhou Wen in before taking the driver’s seat.

“Young Master Wen, why did Li Mobai want to see you?” An Sheng clearly knew that Li Mobai had met Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen didn’t hide it as he recounted the matter.

“Ah Sheng, there’s something I don’t quite understand. Why did Chancellor Leng kill Buddha Annihilation and not choose to attempt a contract?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I’m not too sure about that. I’m afraid only Chancellor Leng can answer you.” An Sheng shook his head.

After a pause, An Sheng continued, “What Li Mobai said might be true, but it’s probably too late to go now.”

“Why do you say that?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

“According to reliable intelligence, Zhang Chunqiu, Xia Liuchuan, and Dugu Ge have gone to the South District together. Furthermore, their target is a Guardian egg. The place they’ve gone to is very close to the region Li Mobai mentioned,” An Sheng said.

“Li Mobai didn’t say where the Guardian egg is. How do you know where it is?” Zhou Wen asked.

“The An family has naturally been secretly paying attention to people like Li Mobai. He used to stay in the South District for a period of time. We’ve checked the areas he has been to and can determine a general area,” An Sheng explained.

“I see. That’s a pity.” Zhou Wen was originally tempted, but after hearing An Sheng’s words, he felt that his hopes were most likely dashed.

The roads these days were difficult to navigate. An Sheng stopped the car inside a service station before the two of them rode their Companion Beasts forward.

Zhou Wen rode the Great Might Vajra Bull as though he was walking on flat ground in the forest. His speed wasn’t slower than driving.

“Young Master Wen, you have to memorize the map of the maze. Although I’ll lead the way for you, you’ll have to come out by yourself if you get lost inside,” An Sheng exhorted Zhou Wen again.
