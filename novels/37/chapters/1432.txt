Chapter 1433: Venusian Companion Beast

“What are you waiting for? Leave quickly.” Tsukuyomi’s figure appeared beside Zhou Wen. Without any explanation, she grabbed Zhou Wen and left using spatial teleportation. In the blink of an eye, they returned to the asteroid belt.

“What were you waiting for? If I were any later and you ended up trapped by its Calamity Zone, you wouldn’t even have the chance to escape. You could only wait for death when that happened,” Tsukuyomi said as she rolled her eyes at Zhou Wen.

“Ahem, I just didn’t expect it to appear there,” Zhou Wen said in embarrassment.

“Didn’t I tell you that a Calamity creature needs immense energy to advance? It’s naturally no exception. Were you even listening?” Tsukuyomi said angrily.

“Since it wants it, shouldn’t it be challenging the Venusian dimensional zone itself? With its strength, it shouldn’t be difficult to obtain first place, right?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

“It does, but it’s a Companion Beast. Do you think a Venusian Companion Beast will give itself to Companion Beasts from other planets?” Tsukuyomi looked at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at a nerd. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“So there’s such a restriction.” Only then did Zhou Wen realize that wild Companion Beasts couldn’t obtain planetary Companion Beasts. Therefore, the galactic behemoth was camping near Venus, waiting for someone to take it out.

“Go back. As long as you return to Earth, you will be safe. No Calamity creature can enter Earth without being punished. The cosmos is too dangerous. It’s not suitable for you,” Tsukuyomi said.

“How about you? Did you gain anything?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.

“I didn’t gain much, but at least I won’t starve to death,” Tsukuyomi said casually.

“That’s good. This is for you.” Zhou Wen took out a Companion Egg and handed it to Tsukuyomi.

“Why are you giving me this?” Tsukuyomi took the Companion Egg and curled her lips. “You are too insincere. If you really want to thank me, shouldn’t you give me the Venusian Companion Egg you just obtained? What’s the use of giving me a Metal Guard Companion Egg? Don’t tell me you think this thing can fill my stomach?”

“Take it with you,” Zhou Wen said before getting up to teleport back to Earth.

He had exchanged his life for the Venusian Companion Egg, so how could he give it away so easily? Zhou Wen had left a spatial mark on the Metal Guard Companion Egg. If Tsukuyomi needed him in the future, he could directly reach her.

…

After returning to Luoyang, Zhou Wen got An Sheng over.

Before Zhou Wen could ask, An Sheng said, “Young Master, Overseer is back.”

Zhou Wen thought to himself,?No doubt about it; he was definitely the one impersonating Xiao.

An Tianzuo hadn’t held back in the previous battle. Zhou Wen could sense that he had used all his strength. This made Zhou Wen suspect that An Tianzuo was taking the opportunity to finish him.

As though he had seen through Zhou Wen’s thoughts, An Sheng hurriedly whispered, “Young Master, Overseer said that if you hadn’t fought with all your might, you wouldn’t have been able to fool the person in the Holy Land. However, he believed that you would definitely be able to hold out.”

“If I hadn’t, would he have just slaughtered me?” Zhou Wen said coldly.

“Definitely not. Overseer knows his limits,” An Sheng hurriedly said.

Zhou Wen thought to himself,?Who knows what his limits are. Perhaps his limits are to kill me.

However, Zhou Wen knew that if An Tianzuo had intended to eliminate him, he would have had plenty of opportunities when he first came to Luoyang to study. He wouldn’t have waited until now.

Just as An Sheng was about to say something, Zhou Wen added, “By the way, do you know the expert who forged the Essence Gold weapons?”

“Our An family has many blacksmiths. A few of them have pretty good skills. Young Master, do you want to forge an Essence Gold weapon?” An Sheng asked curiously.

“My Bamboo Blade has shattered. I’ve brought back the fragments and scabbard. See if you can think of a way to recover or reforge them.” Zhou Wen handed the Bamboo Blade’s fragments and scabbard to An Sheng.

Zhou Wen was used to using the Bamboo Blade. Furthermore, the Bamboo Blade had a Jinxes Master effect. It should be of some use against powers like blessing. Zhou Wen wanted to see if it could be restored.

“I’m afraid it can’t be restored now that it’s shattered to such a state. I can only try to reforge it,” An Sheng said as he looked at the shards.

“Then reforge it.” Zhou Wen didn’t know if the Bamboo Blade would still have any Jinxes Master effect after reforging it. However, he still wanted to carry a weapon that he was used to.

“Alright, I’ll take all of these pieces back and let the masters study them. I’m not sure yet, but it shouldn’t take long.” An Sheng put away the fragments and scabbard.

“I’m not in a rush to use it. Do it slowly. It’s best if it can be recovered to its original state,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright, I’ll get them to try their best to find the original blueprint of Bamboo Blade and reforge it according to it.” With that said, An Sheng left with the fragments.

Zhou Wen returned to his room and had just taken out the Venusian Companion Egg when he saw the antelope and Chick run over and stare intently at the Venusian Companion Egg in his hand.

“What are you doing?” Zhou Wen hurriedly stored the Companion Egg away into the Companion Egg and looked warily at the antelope.

“Look at you. Isn’t it just a Venusian Companion Egg? Who would snatch it from you?” The antelope curled its lips and said disdainfully, “I’m just here to see what the Companion Egg can hatch.”

“I see. That’s easy. I’ll show you when I hatch it.” Zhou Wen took out the Venusian Companion Egg again.

Whoosh!

The antelope charged over like a phantom and opened its mouth to bite the Companion Egg. Zhou Wen was already prepared as he retracted his palm and quickly retreated, causing the antelope to miss.

“What did you just say?” Zhou Wen mocked the antelope.

The antelope showed no embarrassment at all as it said without a blush, “Give me the Companion Egg. I’ll take you to Mount Laojun to retrieve the treasure. The treasures there are much better than this Companion Egg.”

“Go get it yourself. I’m not interested.” Zhou Wen teleported to the Moon with the Venusian Companion Egg without giving the antelope a chance.

Without heading to Lady Supreme Yin’s place, he used his phone to scan the Venusian Companion Egg in an uninhabited spot.

Golden Wyrm: Calamity (Evolvable)

Strength: 100

Speed: 100

Zhou Wen was rather satisfied with these stats. It was born at the Calamity grade. Although it was only at the Human Realm, it was enough for him. Now that he had a Calamity-grade Companion Beast, there was no need for him to risk his life the next time he encountered a Calamity-grade opponent.

The only surprise was that this thing’s companion form wasn’t a gun. From the creatures in the Venusian dimensional zone, Zhou Wen imagined that it would be a gun.

He took out the other Venusian Companion Egg and was immediately alarmed.
