Chapter 1003: Slaying the Guardian

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen’s movement techniques and saber techniques were pleasing to the eye and looked extremely elegant.

Even with the help of the Guardian’s powers, Joseph’s Speed and Strength were stronger than Zhou Wen’s in all aspects; yet, he was ultimately unable to injure him.

Even ordinary people who didn’t know how strong or weak their combat strength was could tell that although Joseph’s Strength and Speed were great, his technique and realm were far inferior to Zhou Wen’s.

Zhou Wen relied solely on his technique and combat experience to forcefully make up for the difference in physique between the two.

The Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal combined with the Mythical Heart Defying Sword made Zhou Wen appear no weaker in his battle with Joseph.

Joseph was alarmed. He believed that after having a Guardian, he was already one of the strongest humans. Ignoring normal humans, even people with Mythical Companion Beasts were probably no match for him.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t even use a Companion Beast. Just his strength, skills, and Essence Gold saber were enough to render him helpless. It was rather terrifying.

Joseph made up his mind. Previously, he had that strange sword that prevented the Guardian’s Hypocritical Transaction from finding a target to transfer. Now that he can’t use Companion Beasts, I don’t believe that he can withstand the damage transfer. He can’t self-destruct, right?

However, with his previous experience, Joseph didn’t dare be careless against Zhou Wen. Although he felt that this move was feasible, he couldn’t activate the Wheel of Destiny again anytime soon. If his life ended up in danger, he couldn’t use the False God Statue to escape.

To prevent any accidents, Joseph made a decision.

Zhou Wen used the Bamboo Blade as a sword and used the Heart Defying Sword to perfection. The might of his sword moves also became stronger.

As for Joseph, he seemed to be completely suppressed by Zhou Wen. He seemed to be retreating in defeat.

The spectators were already dumbfounded when they saw this. They couldn’t believe that an Epic human could suppress Joseph, who had a Guardian.

“Joseph seems to be deliberately luring Zhou Wen into delivering greater might with his sword,” Sadie said.

“That’s indeed the case. From the looks of it, he still plans on using that damage transfer ability,” said Lance.

“He still hasn’t learned his lesson after suffering a loss. He just has to do it again,” Li Xuan said with a curl of his lips.

“The situation now is probably a little different. Zhou Wen is using an ordinary Essence Gold weapon and not a saber transformed from a Companion Beast. It’s impossible for him to let the Bamboo Blade leave his hand to attack Joseph. If the damage is transferred, it can be transferred to Zhou Wen. Even if Zhou Wen were to throw the saber out, Zhou Wen’s situation will be very bad if the saber is destroyed,” Gulli said.

Lance thought for a moment, but he couldn’t think of a way for Zhou Wen to nullify the damage transfer. He pondered and said, “Since Zhou Wen has agreed not to use Companion Beasts, there should be a solution. Let’s continue watching.”

With Joseph luring Zhou Wen to use greater strength, Zhou Wen’s might grew stronger and stronger. This was also what Joseph wanted. He wanted to use damage transfer to kill Zhou Wen.

Seeing that the time was ripe, Zhou Wen’s sword stance was like a storm. It was impossible for him to retract his force.

Joseph suddenly retreated, but the armor on his body condensed into a Guardian that looked like a devil. It faced the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.

Bamboo Blade crisscrossed over Lie’s body like bolts of lightning, leaving deep marks on its body.

Without the augmentation of Mythical Strength, Zhou Wen’s Strength was still a little weak. The injuries he left on Lie weren’t deep.

Joseph was delighted when he saw this. Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t as terrifying as he imagined. It was completely within the limits of Lie.

However, such a violent sword attack left many wounds in a short period of time. Even if these injuries couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, they could reduce him to a heavily injured state.

“Zhou Wen, you’re dead.” Joseph roared as he excitedly launched Hypocritical Transaction to transfer the Guardian’s injuries to Zhou Wen.

However, in the next second, the excitement on Joseph’s face froze. He realized that the Guardian’s injuries couldn’t be transferred to Zhou Wen.

“Impossible... How can this be... You cheated... You used the power of a Companion Beast to withstand the Guardian’s damage transfer?” Joseph roared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes.

The people in the spectator stands also felt that what Joseph said wasn’t impossible. Otherwise, how could Zhou Wen, an Epic-stage human, suppress the Guardian so badly?

“Do I need to cheat?” Zhou Wen said calmly as the Bamboo Blade’s aura suddenly increased.

Instantly, Zhou Wen’s aura reached a terrifying level. At the instant he brandished the Bamboo Blade in his hand, he seemed to vanish.

When he appeared again, he was already at the other end of the arena. He slowly returned Bamboo Blade to its scabbard.

Crack!

And in the sky, Lie’s body split into two and was killed on the spot.

Not far behind the Guardian, Joseph spat out a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground.

The arena was silent. Those who had doubted Zhou Wen moments ago now felt the coldness deep in their bones.

Is there a need to cheat? It really doesn’t seem like there’s a need. This thought appeared in everyone’s minds.

The strength of humans can really kill Guardians! Apart from that, an unbelievable thought sprouted in everyone’s hearts.

“You cheated... You cheated... It’s impossible for human strength to defeat a Guardian... It’s impossible for you to defeat me, a chosen one of God... You must be cheating...” The wounds on Joseph’s body were still bleeding, but he seemed to have gone mad. He ignored his injuries and struggled to get up and shout.

Zhou Wen didn’t kill him. After all, he was from the Ultimate Family Clan. It was better to leave him to the Ultimate Family Clan to deal with.

He originally imagined that the matter would end here, but gray smoke suddenly rose from Joseph’s body as though his body was turning into dust.

As for the smoke, it condensed into the appearance of Lie above Joseph.

This strange scene left everyone horrified. As Joseph constantly screamed, his body quickly dissipated, and the smoke transformed into the complete Lie.

However, the current Lie looked much more agile and strange than the previous Lie.

“What happened? Aren’t Guardians supposed to protect contractors? Why did it devour Joseph?” Everyone felt their blood run cold.

Lie floated in the air as it looked at Zhou Wen with its demonic eyes and said, “You defeated Joseph. Now, you have the right to succeed Joseph as God’s chosen one. I will bestow you supreme power.”
