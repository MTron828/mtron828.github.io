Chapter 902: Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle

Zhou Wen quickly left without looking back. Uesugi Nao stood there in a daze with a notebook and pen.

From Uesugi Nao’s point of view, Zhou Wen’s reaction was clearly unreasonable. Even if he wasn’t willing to give his fans autographs, a normal person wouldn’t have such an attitude.

“Forget it. Let’s go,” the female guard said to Uesugi Nao.

“I know the reason. Go back now. I have my ways,” Uesugi Nao said to the female guard as she walked in another direction.

When she reached an empty spot, Uesugi Nao returned to her original appearance and changed back into female clothes before heading to the beach again.

Although Uesugi Nao had never liked men who treated women as accessories, she had to admit that women had a huge advantage in certain aspects.

Ordinary people might be impatient with male fans who clamored for autographs, but they would be much more patient towards female fans, especially beautiful and cute ones.

Uesugi Nao was very confident in her appearance and figure. It was much better than her transformation as Xu Ai.

Since I have the qualities, it’s not a bad thing to occasionally use them, Uesugi Nao thought as she walked up the beach and walked towards Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was still strolling on the beach, his main goal to search for the tiny palm symbol. As he walked, he felt someone watching him.

He turned around and looked at the source of his gaze, but he realized that it wasn’t the two men from before. Instead, it was a beautiful girl who looked less than twenty years old. There was a hint of charm in her beauty. She was a rare beauty.

Seeing Zhou Wen staring at her, Uesugi Nao revealed a charming smile. From her point of view, it was a very advantageous weapon. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Zhou Wen stared at Uesugi Nao’s eyes and found them somewhat familiar. However, it was difficult to tell with just one look. He wanted to take a closer look to determine where he had seen a woman with such eyes.

Uesugi Nao thought to herself, Indeed, men are all the same.

With this in mind, Uesugi Nao walked towards Zhou Wen. Her beautiful hair fluttered under the sea breeze as her thin clothes clung tightly to her body, revealing her exquisite figure.

Such a style was comparable to a model on the runway. It was more natural and delightful, something that models lacked.

“My name is Hai’er. I seem to have seen you somewhere before. Can you tell me your name?” Uesugi Nao came in front of Zhou Wen, tidied her hair, and said to him with a smile.

“You remembered wrongly. I don’t know you.” Zhou Wen thought carefully and indeed, he didn’t know this woman. With that said, he turned around and left.

Uesugi Nao was slightly taken aback. Seeing that Zhou Wen had already turned around and left, she calmed herself down and chased after him. She stood in front of him and said, “It’s fine if you don’t know me. I think you’re very special. Can we get to know each other?”

“No, please make way.” Zhou Wen brushed Uesugi Nao’s hand aside and glanced at the reef behind her before walking to the other side.

Uesugi Nao stood there in a daze for quite some time. By the time she snapped to her senses, Zhou Wen had already walked far away.

Is this guy... a woman who used Body Transformation? Uesugi Nao thought with a strange expression.

Zhou Wen circled the beach but didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. Instead, he killed a few sea turtles that crawled out of the sea.

Unfortunately, they were all at the Mortal stage, so nothing dropped.

Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and rode it towards the islands in the sea. The six islands in Turtle Tomb could only be seen when the tide receded.

According to the information Zhou Wen had obtained, there would occasionally be Mythical sea turtles on the six turtle shell islands, but there were very few of them. Instead, there were quite a number of Legendary and Epic sea turtles.

Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in ordinary sea turtles. He mainly wanted to head to the island to see if there was a tiny palm symbol.

There were also people hunting sea turtles on Turtle Shell Island. These people were clearly much stronger. Most of them were at the Legendary stage, and occasionally, Epic existences could be seen.

Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in them. He circled the first Turtle Shell Island and didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly saw a behemoth rush out from the seawater beside him.

It was a sea turtle that was the size of an elephant. The turtle shell looked about the same as the typical iron-armored turtle. It was black, but it looked darker.

Furthermore, the patterns on the turtle’s back were golden. They were like golden threads that outlined a strange pattern on the turtle shell.

“Mythical Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle!” Not far away, someone exclaimed.

His shout attracted the attention of the people nearby. Some people retreated the moment they saw the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle, while others rushed over.

Those who dared to rush over were basically at the Epic stage.

As the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle wasn’t fast, Epic creatures had the chance to dodge. Furthermore, with several Epic entities attacking from different directions, it made it difficult for the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle to deal any damage.

The sea turtles in Turtle Tomb had very strong defenses, but their combat strength wasn’t very strong. This was probably the only Mythical creature that could be bullied by a few Epic entities.

However, the Epic humans’ offensive strength was useless against the Black Iron Gold Thread Tortoise. All sorts of Essence Energy Skills and Companion Beasts’ abilities struck it, producing metallic clangs, but they hardly left a mark.

Zhou Wen watched from the side for a while but didn’t immediately attack the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle.

Uesugi Nao also went to the island. When she saw the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle, she had an idea. I can use the excuse of competing with Zhou Wen for the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle to test his strength.

After seeing Zhou Wen’s sword technique, Uesugi Nao didn’t dare underestimate him despite believing that she had the Great Skyfiend Guardian that made her better than Zhou Wen.

Uesugi Nao felt that Zhou Wen might be a key opponent if she wanted to obtain the Lu family’s Fiend Dust rights. Furthermore, Zhou Wen represented the An family. It would be best if she could think of a way to get Zhou Wen to quit before the dimensional creature hunting began.

I might not be as good as you in sword arts, but you might not be able to beat me in actual combat. As Uesugi Nao thought about it, she approached the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle.

The Epic humans clearly didn’t have a good way to deal with the Black Iron Gold Thread Tortoise. Their attacks couldn’t penetrate its defense.

After watching for a while, Zhou Wen gained a general understanding of the Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle. This Mythical creature basically had all its talent in defense. It was very weak in other aspects. As long as he could break through its defense, it would be very easy to kill it.
