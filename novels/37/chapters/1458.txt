Chapter 1459: Source of Calamity

Tsukuyomi twisted her waist and did a spin, preventing herself from falling. She was extremely depressed.

If the stone beast had broken through her restrictions a little later, she would have succeeded. All was for naught now. She couldn’t accept it.

Zhou Wen pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword and slashed at the stone monument, leaving a sword mark. However, the stone monument instantly healed as though it had never been injured.

“What’s engraved on the stone monument is its merits it has done for all eternity. No power can erase it. Not even the power of a mighty immortal can do so,” Tsukuyomi said as she walked over.

Zhou Wen had just raised his sword to slash at the stone monument again. Upon hearing Tsukuyomi’s words, he had thoughts of unsummoning his sword when, to his surprise, a force was suddenly released from the Immortal Culling Sword. It tugged at his hand and drove him to slash at the stone monument.

The Immortal Culling Sword struck the stone monument, splitting it apart instead of just leaving a sword mark like before. What was even stranger was that after the Immortal Culling Sword slashed, the engraved words on the stone monument appeared out of thin air.

The stone monument turned into a stone slab. There were no longer any signs of carving on it, as though the engravings had never existed.

The two halves of the stone monument fell onto the rocks and shattered, turning into rubble.

Tsukuyomi couldn’t help but be stunned as she looked at the rocks on the ground.

“What’s the origin of that sword?” Tsukuyomi couldn’t help but look at the Immortal Culling Sword.

The Immortal Culling Sword automatically returned to its scabbard after the slash. Zhou Wen held it in surprise.

He had always treated the Immortal Culling Sword as a nuke that was in the form of a cold weapon. He didn’t expect the Immortal Culling Sword to have such special effects other than its powerful destructive power.

Furthermore, this effect clearly needed triggering. The numerous strikes he had delivered hadn’t triggered such a strange effect.

Could it be that Tsukuyomi’s words triggered its power? In that case, the Immortal Culling Sword’s intelligence is probably much higher than I imagined

, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

The moment the stone monument collapsed, the growing rocks slowly shrank back. The underground space gradually returned to its original state as the passageway that allowed departure from the dimensional zone appeared again.

Tsukuyomi walked to the shattered stone beast’s corpse and picked up a fist-sized crystalline jade. She walked to Zhou Wen’s side and handed it to him. “Unfortunately, there aren’t any Companion Eggs or dimensional crystals. This is the part of its body that has undergone the Calamity grade. It’s usually known as the Source of Calamity. It contains immense energy and can enhance the special attributes of one’s body.”

Zhou Wen reached out to take the Calamity jade and looked at it before throwing it to Tsukuyomi.

“I was just joking. Are you still mad?” Tsukuyomi caught the Source of the Calamity and said.

“This item is your food, right? I can live without it, but you can’t,” Zhou Wen said.

“Are you concerned about me?” Tsukuyomi’s eyes were filled with joy.

“I just don’t want to see you die.” Zhou Wen turned around and headed for the exit of the dimensional zone.

Tsukuyomi smiled and put away the Source of Calamity before following him.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word along the way. After leaving the dimensional zone, Tsukuyomi said, “There are some beautiful planets nearby. Furthermore, there shouldn’t be any other creatures on them for the time being. Do you want to take a look?”

“There’s no need. I still have matters waiting for me on my return.” Zhou Wen rejected Tsukuyomi and was about to teleport back to Earth.

Tsukuyomi was somewhat disappointed, but there was nothing she could do. All she could do was watch Zhou Wen leave as she sighed inwardly.

“Don’t damage it for no reason. It’s the last one.” Zhou Wen turned his head and threw a Companion Egg with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping mark to Tsukuyomi before teleporting back to Earth.

Tsukuyomi caught the Companion Egg and was taken aback. After a while, she revealed a smile and muttered to herself, “The ancient humans didn’t lie to me. There’s some use to reading after all.”

After Zhou Wen returned to Earth, he took out his phone to look at his stats.

Indeed, he realized that his four basic stats had reached 99 points. That wasn’t all. The spatial attribute in the special attribute column had also reached 99 points. This was the first time Zhou Wen’s special attribute had reached the maximum value of his current level.

I never expected the Origin of Calamity to have such benefits. I have to think of a way to obtain some in the future.?Zhou Wen organized his Companion Beasts again.

Quite a number of Companion Eggs had dropped during his recent grinding of dungeons. He had already obtained four Mythical Golden Battle God Halberds and three Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods.

Zhou Wen suddenly realized that Companion Eggs with the word “Golden Battle God” seemed to drop especially easily. The other Mythical and Terror-grade Companion Eggs didn’t drop that easily.

Just after obtaining a Terror-grade Stone Beast Companion Egg, Zhou Wen looked at its stats and saw that it was indeed a strength- and defense-type Companion Beast. It had an armor form, but he didn’t lack such Companion Beasts.

The stone beast’s stats were inferior to Prisoned Dragon’s, so Prisoned Dragon remained a prime choice.

Sell them??Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to give the batch of stone beast eggs to An Sheng. He could leave it to him.

For the new Bamboo Blade to have such an effect, the materials used were definitely not simple. The value of this batch of Stone Beast Companion Eggs was far from enough. And this defensive armor-type Companion Beast could save the lives of many soldiers.

What’s the use of this Metal Seed? Don’t tell me I should bury it in the ground??Zhou Wen played with the Metal Seed Companion Beast.

He had studied this thing for a long time, but he didn’t find any way to grow it. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Thinking of the might of the metal flower on Venus, Zhou Wen felt that it was a waste to not do anything to it. He had to think of a way to advance it.

After some thought, he felt that he might need to plant it and produce a metal flower. Therefore, Zhou Wen dug a hole in his yard and buried the Metal Seed to see if he could end up with a metal flower.

After planting the Metal Seed, Zhou Wen deliberately poured some water on it, but he didn’t discover any reaction.

It shouldn’t grow so quickly. I’ll wait a few days.?Zhou Wen turned around and prepared to find An Sheng to give him the Stone Beast Companion Eggs.

To his surprise, just as Zhou Wen walked out of the yard, the Metal Seed tore out of the ground and flew back to him, returning to its tattoo form.

It doesn’t work??Zhou Wen summoned the Metal Seed again and saw zero changes.

Zhou Wen didn’t give up. He thought to himself,?This thing is a Metal Seed. Do I have to plant it in metal?

Seeing that there wasn’t any metal around him, Zhou Wen touched the Bamboo Blade with Metal Seed. He was only giving it a try and didn’t expect it to be of any use.

However, to his surprise, after the Metal Seed came into contact with the Bamboo Blade, it stuck to it firmly like a magnet..
