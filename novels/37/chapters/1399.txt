Chapter 1400: Fusing Skill

Zhou Wen entered the Venusian instance dungeon when it finished refreshing. This time, he wanted to see if he could crack the fatal seventh bullet.

Spacetime Bandit, Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, Absolute Space, Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, and other skills were used according to his repeated practice.

A miniature Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array formed around Zhou Wen. This Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array had the Lunar Mansion Array as its core. With the augmentation of spatial skills, it formed a small periodic space around Zhou Wen.

In theory, any attack that entered would be trapped in the looping space forever. It was like walking into the orbit of a M?bius loop.

Of course, in fact, it didn’t have such a powerful effect. It only used the tricks of array formation and spatial swapping to make the prey enter alternating spaces.

When the bullet shot by, the Metal Guard was within three feet of Zhou Wen. It immediately changed from taking a straight line to exhibiting circular motion around Zhou Wen’s body.

A large number of bullets spun around Zhou Wen like a galaxy.

Zhou Wen had already done the experiments. Typical Mythical bullets were indeed unable to break through the restrictions of the looping space, but Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if they could withstand a Calamity-grade bullet.

After killing all the Metal Guards, the Golden Battle God appeared. The Terror-grade bullets failed to break through Zhou Wen’s protective array. The bullets could only revolve around his body.

After killing all the Golden Battle Gods, he obtained two stat crystals. One had 89 Strength and the other 91 Essence Energy, raising Zhou Wen’s two stats. He was still a distance away from his 99 stat limit.

An ear-piercing alarm sounded. Zhou Wen felt a little uneasy, unsure if he could block the Calamity-grade bullet.

Bang!

A bullet shot out from the tunnel. With Zhou Wen’s present strength, he could already see the trajectory of the bullet when he activated The Disqualified.

However, he didn’t block it and allowed the bullet to reach his body.

When the bullet was three feet from his body, it underwent a distortion. However, it continued advancing, causing Zhou Wen’s heart to sink.

Thankfully, after advancing less than a foot, the trajectory of the bullet finally changed. It spun into an arc that revolved around Zhou Wen like a satellite.

There’s a chance!?Zhou Wen was overjoyed.

Bang! Bang!

Bullets shot over one after another. No matter where they shot at Zhou Wen, they would eventually turn into satellites that orbited him. They would only fall to the ground when all their strength was expended.

However, Zhou Wen soon discovered a problem. The Calamity-grade bullets shot out one after another. Before the first bullet’s force was completely eliminated, they were followed by subsequent shots.

As the number of bullets increased, there was a problem with the looping space. The bullets entered with increasing distance, but they got closer and closer to Zhou Wen’s body.

Bang!

When the fifth bullet shot in, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array around Zhou Wen immediately disintegrated. Due to the impact of the force, a gap appeared in the alternating space. Unable to swap them accurately, the balance was broken, and the entire system instantly collapsed.

Without waiting for the sixth shot to be fired, Zhou Wen exited the game.

There was still a problem with his ability. If he didn’t resolve it, there was no benefit in fighting again.

Just five bullets caused problems in the alternating space. I didn’t even see the seventh bullet. There appears to be a huge problem with this skill.?Zhou Wen’s goal had always been to kill the Calamity creature on Venus, not just clear the level.

Zhou Wen switched dungeons and constantly used skill combinations in-game to figure out where the problem was.

After some extended research, Zhou Wen finally gained a rough understanding of the problem.

It was because Zhou Wen’s alternating space was a combo formed from the combination of several skills. Once the combo deviated, its stability would be affected, easily causing the combo to crack or even collapse.

After trying a few times, he wanted the combo to be more perfect and optimized, but the outcome wasn’t ideal. Once he suffered a strong impact, the combo would produce slight deviations. This was something that couldn’t be completely avoided.

The sure-kill seventh bullet has the characteristic of perpetual attacking, but my combo can’t withstand too much pressure. In other words, it’s impossible for me to block the sure-kill seventh bullet.?Zhou Wen was somewhat vexed.

Now that he knew that this combination could form an alternating space, but was unable to withstand the Calamity-grade bullet, Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue thinking of a different plan.

Since there’s no way to avoid the gap between skills, I’ll fuse them into one skill.?After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that this was the only way.

…

“What’s Little Wen doing? Why haven’t I seen him recently?” Ouyang Lan called An Sheng over and asked.

“Young Master Wen has been studying something recently. He hasn’t left his room in days,” An Sheng answered.

Ouyang Lan looked at the empty dining table and sighed. “I clearly have a husband, two sons, and a daughter, but there’s no one to eat with me. What’s going on?”

“Madam, did Uncle Zhou go out again?” An Sheng asked.

“That’s right. The Dugu family discovered an ancient site in a dimensional zone. They don’t understand some words, so they invited him to take a look,” Ouyang Lan said.

“Didn’t he discuss it with Young Master Wen before going?” An Sheng whispered.

“It’s not like you don’t know his temper. He usually does whatever I say, but once there are those strange ancient texts, he won’t listen to me. I can’t do anything about him,” Ouyang Lan said helplessly.

“Although the Dugu family has a good relationship with us now, Uncle Zhou’s identity is special. If someone tries to use him, it will be very disadvantageous for Young Master Wen. It’s best to be careful. If we really don’t want to trouble Young Master Wen, I can get someone to accompany Uncle Zhou,” An Sheng said.

Ouyang Lan said with a bitter smile, “It’s useless. I did send someone to protect him, but if the Dugu family really wants to touch him, how can the typical person stop them? Unless he doesn’t leave, such matters can’t be done just by providing him with bodyguards. Thankfully, nothing serious has happened up to now. He’s only a scholar after all. His cultivation is very ordinary, so ordinary people won’t make things difficult for him.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

An Sheng also knew that this matter was thorny. He couldn’t come up with a good solution even after some thought.

If they didn’t let Zhou Lingfeng out, what was the difference between that and sending him to jail? However, he couldn’t let Zhou Wen follow him 24/7, right? Typical bodyguards would be of little use when encountering powerful enemies.

“Go and see how Little Wen is doing. If he has the time, get him to come over to have a meal with me and have a chat. He shouldn’t stay cooped up in his room all day. He’ll end up with depression,” Ouyang Lan said.

“I’ll go now,” An Sheng agreed and turned to leave the hall, heading for Zhou Wen’s yard.
