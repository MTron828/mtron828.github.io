Chapter 1805 Super Jinx

With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned the Companion Beast.

It was a black humanoid Companion Beastblack clothes, a black hat, black shoes, and a black veil. Only its hair was especially long and white, and the ends burned with white light.

Companion Form: Permanent Passive

Zhou Wen frowned when he saw the Companion Beast’s information. He looked at Jing Daoxian, who had given him the Companion Egg

Clearly, Jing Daoxian’s previous words weren’t trustworthy. Super Jinx didn’t have any abilities that were convenient for possession. All these abilities pointed in one direction-to make Zhou Wen suffer.

Furthermore, its Companion Form was especially strange. Zhou Wen had never seen such a Companion Form before. It meant that there was a permanent passive acting on him. It probably meant that even if he didn’t summon Super Jinx, its ability would still be in effect.

“That’s right. I lied to you again.” Jing Daoxian chuckled. With that said, he didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to take action before rushing through the door of Nüwa Temple.

Zhou Wen didn’t take action as he had other plans.

“Nüwa Temple does have multiple spaces. He wasn’t lying about that,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself as he watched Jing Daoxian’s body vanish like he had sunk into water.

“What’s going on?” Liu Yun was still in a daze as he asked in puzzlement.

“This Companion Beast will increase one’s bad luck. Furthermore, even if it isn’t summoned, it will still have an effect. From the looks of it, your old man is using me as a beacon,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

He had never trusted Jing Daoxian from the beginning. He had long thought of the possibility of Jing Daoxian tampering with the Companion Egg.

Perhaps to others, Super Jinx was a problem that was extremely difficult to resolve, but to Zhou Wen, it wasn’t a problem at all.

Using the phone’s Companion Beast fusion function, he could directly wipe out Super Jinx’s abilities. It couldn’t be easier.

“What beacon?” Liu Yun didn’t understand what Zhou Wen meant.

“I’ll tell you later.” Zhou Wen unsummoned Super Jinx before taking out his phone and opening the Companion Beast interface.

I’ll wipe away Super Jinx first. Zhou Wen planned on using the lowest-level Companion Beast to fuse with the Super Jinx. Even if he couldn’t wipe it in one round, he only needed a few more rounds to wipe out its Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and so on into something different. It might even be destroyed.

Such an unlucky Companion Beast’s fusion success rate had to be pitifully low. The possibility of it being destroyed on its first fusion was very high.

Zhou Wen wanted to tap on the Companion Beast he wanted for the fusion, but to his surprise, he sneezed and closed his eyes uncontrollably.

ere

Zhou Wen immediately knew that things were bad. When he opened his eyes and looked at the phone screen again, he realized that the fusion animation was playing.

In less than a second, Zhou Wen thought of something and hurriedly checked his Companion Beasts. Indeed, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was gone.

“F*ck you!” Zhou Wen cursed under his breath.

“Why are you still on your phone at a time like this? Aren’t you going to think about how to resolve the Companion Beast problem? Why don’t you transfer the Companion Beast to me or let me kill your Companion Beast?” Liu Yun said.

“It’s useless now.” Zhou Wen shook his head and smiled bitterly.

Now that this thing had fused with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, who knew what would happen? He could only hope that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was stronger than Super Jinx and could override all the latter’s abilities.

“What does beacon mean?” Liu Yun scratched his ears and cheeks anxiously.

“If I’m not wrong, there will definitely be a multiple-choice question waiting for me in Nüwa Temple. Furthermore, there will be two choices. As long as I choose the wrong one, your old man will be able to choose the right one.” Zhou Wen paused for a moment before continuing, “However, there’s something I don’t understand. If he wants to use me to eliminate a wrong answer, he can choose anyone else. There’s no need to trick me into coming over. Therefore, it’s very likely that only I can choose. No one else can make the choice.”

“What’s there to choose? Under such circumstances, it’s best if you leave quickly,” Liu Yun said.

“It’s fine. I also need an answer. This is an opportunity for me,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the phone screen.

The fusion came to an end. The Companion Beast that appeared on the screen still looked like the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. There were almost no changes. However, there were some subtle black patterns on the armor, and their edges burned with a white halo.

Companion Form: Permanent Passive

These stats stunned Zhou Wen. It was a miracle that a fused Companion Beast could obtain such stats.

After all, the two Companion Beasts used for fusion could only be considered high-level Calamity-grade Companion Beasts, not true top-notch ones.

It was normal to have such stats when combining Companion Beasts like Truth Listener or Mystic Thearch with Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

Two Companion Beasts with stats that didn’t exceed 400 at most produced 999 stats. This had nothing to do with luck.

What was even more terrifying was that all his abilities had the word ‘Super’ as a prefix. It was obvious that all his original abilities had increased.

Thankfully, it didn’t inherit any of the abilities related to bad luck. But this Permanent Passive and Super Jinx Master… Zhou Wen didn’t know if his life could endure such hardship

“Wait here. I’ll go in and take a look.” Seeing that Liu Yun still wanted to persuade him to leave, Zhou Wen interrupted Liu Yun and walked straight into Nüwa Temple.

Jinxes Master was terrifying, but Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid. He had studied the reason why Jinxes Master hadn’t caused any substantial damage to him.

What did Jinxes Master mean? In order to study this problem, Zhou Wen gathered a lot of information and asked some people who had Companion Beasts with Jinxes Master.

The outcome of the research was that Jinxes Master targeted the master’s Life Providence. It would weaken the master’s Life Providence. In serious cases, not only would the Life Providence not be able to play a positive role, but it might even have negative effects, causing the master to be unlucky or even die.

It was normal for an ordinary person’s Life Providence to not be able to withstand Jinxes Master, but Zhou Wen’s Life Providence was different. It was the Sigh of the King. It wasn’t Zhou Wen’s Life Providence to begin with. It was a Life Providence formed after absorbing the Lost Immortal Sutra. Jinxes Master was aimed at the woman in the Lost Immortal Sutra.

Zhou Wen deduced that the reason he hadn’t suffered any damage despite having the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General for so long was that the Sigh of the King had taken all the damage. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General couldn’t do a thing to him.
