Chapter 1020: Different

Translator: CKtalon

Although Gaiman had agreed, Zhou Wen didn’t relax.

The human heart was unpredictable. No one knew what would happen after entering.

However, Zhou Wen needed to do what needed to be done in exchange for the intelligence Frod had provided him. If they had a death wish, Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to stop them.

“After entering the maze, follow me. Listen to me. Don’t believe what others say,” Zhou Wen whispered to Wang Lu.

“Alright.” Wang Lu nodded slightly.

Everyone arrived in front of the maze and answered the questions in the order they had arranged.

As some questions were questions that couldn’t be answered, some could only give up. They couldn’t return for another question in a day.

Therefore, the Ultimate Family Clan had prepared many people just in case. Even if a portion of them couldn’t enter, it wouldn’t hinder their plans.

There were three indispensable people in the team—Zhou Wen, Wang Lu, and Gaiman.

Zhou Wen glanced at the crowd. There were nearly thirty people. Most of the powerhouses in the North District who had Mythical Companion Beasts were here.

However, if they continued answering the questions one by one, it would probably take thirty minutes for everyone to gather inside. It would be such a waste of time.

“Mr. Gaiman, must so many people enter?” Zhou Wen asked Gaiman.

“The maze is too dangerous. It’s easier to deal with any accidents with more people,” Gaiman said.

“Alright then. What’s Wang Lu’s place in line?” Zhou Wen asked.

“As no one will be able to pass the test of the Destiny Witches if Wang Lu doesn’t enter, she has to be one of the first to enter. We will get the experienced members of the two families to enter before her in case anything happens when inside,” Gaiman said.

“Change it. Let Wang Lu be the last to enter,” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s not good, right? If she can’t enter as the last one, wouldn’t our previous efforts be in vain?” Gemar said.

“Remember that I call the shots here. If I say she’s the last, she’s the last. Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen said to Gemar.

Gemar’s expression changed slightly, but he couldn’t say a word. All he could do was look at Gaiman.

“With Wang Lu’s ability, it’s unlikely that she won’t be able to enter. Then let her be the last,” Gaiman said, unwilling to clash with Zhou Wen over such a trivial matter.

With Gaiman’s words, Gemar changed the order of entry.

Others believed that Zhou Wen had taken a fancy to the young and beautiful Wang Lu and wanted to show off in front of her, but they didn’t say a word. All they did was look down on him. At this moment, Zhou Wen was still only thinking about women. He was ultimately a young man.

How could they know that if by entering half an hour later, the safe period would be decreased by half an hour? If something happened inside and they failed to come out in time as planned, this might save her life.

One by one, everyone answered the questions and entered the maze. Many people had to give up answering because they had encountered questions that meant certain death. Only about half of them could really enter.

Zhou Wen was originally second last, but after some thought, he got Wang Lu to answer the question first.

It wasn’t that Zhou Wen wanted to ensure his safety, but he wanted to know what question a person like Wang Lu would encounter.

When Wang Lu walked to the door, a problem immediately appeared on it: Is one plus one equal to two?

Zhou Wen was immediately rendered speechless. There was actually such a question.

Without a doubt, Wang Lu successfully entered.

Zhou Wen went up to answer the question again and saw the question on the door: Are humans born evil or good by nature?

“My life doesn’t need simple beauty.” Zhou Wen decisively activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and randomly chose one before successfully entering Sunday’s Maze of Lies.

Including Zhou Wen and Wang Lu, a total of seventeen people entered. Gaiman and Gemar were among them, and Lance had successfully entered too.

Gaiman had already arranged for people to take action after Zhou Wen entered.

Although he didn’t know that there was a time limit, he knew that he couldn’t waste time here.

Soon, the group arrived in front of the carousel. There was really a Devil Clown there. When he saw everyone, the six magic balls in his hand shot out.

Gaiman directly summoned an Ice Nightmare. The ice gas that the Ice Nightmare spewed out actually froze the six magic balls, preventing them from bouncing again.

The Devil Clown phased away as one of them summoned a bat-like Mythical Companion Beast. The bat emitted a sound wave that made the stealthy clown appear. He couldn’t maintain his stealth any longer.

Everyone joined forces to defeat the enemy and successfully killed the troublesome Devil Clown. No one was injured at all.

Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange. This was because they had already sacrificed quite a number of people to figure out the information on Devil Clown. If they couldn’t kill it, they would really be letting down the people who had died in the Maze of Lies.

“Keep in line with our previous training. Keep moving forward in this state.” Gaiman led the team in the direction of Witch Castle.

Zhou Wen had actually encountered a few dimensional creatures in-game, but their range of activity wasn’t in this area. Logically speaking, after killing the Devil Clown, they should be able to reach Witch’s Castle without any obstructions.

However, not long after they proceeded, they suddenly saw a white wolf with three heads and two wings on its back tear through the air. One wolf head spewed out flames while the other spewed out ice mist. The wolf head in the middle emitted an aural attack.

“It’s a three-headed wolf. Don’t panic. Follow the plan according to our training.” Gaiman continued commanding.

Although the three-headed wolf was powerful, it was difficult for it to defeat more than ten Mythical Companion Beasts. It was quickly killed.

“Although the Mythical creatures here are powerful, it’s easy to enter Witch Castle with our Mythical Companion Beasts.” As a local bigshot expressed this statement, he deliberately shot a glance at Zhou Wen.

He seemed to mean that even without Zhou Wen, they could still complete the mission. Zhou Wen was redundant.

Zhou Wen sincerely hoped that he was redundant. Being safe was better than anything else. He wanted to complete the mission quickly and return.

However, just as the person signaled that, he suddenly saw the three-headed wolf’s corpse explode. Blood and flesh splattered everywhere. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Many people were stained with blood. At that moment, they suddenly heard strange cries coming from all directions. They sounded like crying banshees.

They could vaguely see some creature in the distance approaching them.

This seems a little different from in-game... Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown, but he had already guessed what creature it was.
