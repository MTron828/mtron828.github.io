Chapter 1529 A Lost Paradise

The stone platform slowly sank, revealing a bottomless abyss beneath it. There was no light in the deep hole below. Even looking into it made one feel as though they were being devoured.

As the stone platform descended, the girl lying on it gradually became blurry.

Zhou Wen was sizing up the bottomless pit when he suddenly saw the girl open her eyes and smile at him strangely. She opened her mouth as though she was saying something.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t hear anything, nor did he know what she was talking about.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but tremble as the girl and the stone platform sank into the bottomless abyss, nowhere to be seen again.

“Was that an illusion?” Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if he had really seen the girl open her eyes and speak.

However, he remembered the pair of silver irises and the strange smile very clearly.

It shouldn’t be an illusion, right? Zhou Wen tried his best to recall the girl’s mouth shapes, hoping to guess what she was mouthing.

However, before Zhou Wen could give it much thought, the entire building collapsed as though there was an earthquake. The seven devils glared at Zhou Wen and jumped into the bottomless abyss. In the blink of an eye, the seven devils were gone.

Zhou Wen and Grim Demon didn’t dare take the risk to jump in. All they could do was escape the building. Not long after they came out, the building completely collapsed as though it had been sucked into a bottomless abyss. Soon, even the ruins vanished. The bottomless abyss-like crater was nowhere to be seen.

The spot where the building was originally located turned into a mud pit. Soon, ageless flowers grew out of the pit as though the building and the bottomless abyss had never existed.

“Grim Demon, did you see that girl open her eyes?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.

“No, when did she open her eyes?” Grim Demon asked in puzzlement.

“Not long after the stone platform sank into the crater and was about to enter the darkness, she seemed to open her eyes and mouth something. Didn’t you see it?” Zhou Wen explained in detail.

“Were you seeing things? I was staring at her from beginning to end. I didn’t see her open her eyes even when she vanished, much less speak,” Grim Demon said with certainty.

Zhou Wen frowned silently. Although he felt his mind go adrift for a little moment as though he was dreaming, his brain still remembered it clearly. It was unlikely to be a mistake.

Zhou Wen didn’t ask further since Grim Demon didn’t see her. He looked at Demonic Neonate in his arms. She was still sleeping soundly. Her lips were even sucking her thumb.

“We have to think of a way to return.” Zhou Wen looked around, hoping to find a way to return to Earth.

Zhou Wen had previously been to the dimension, but he had Ice Maiden leading the way, allowing him to return. He didn’t know how to return now.

“I think we should stay here and wait for my lady to wake up. It might be more dangerous to run around in such a place,” said Grim Demon.

Zhou Wen naturally knew that Grim Demon was right, but he didn’t know when Demonic Neonate would wake up.

If Demonic Neonate was really evolving, according to Zhou Wen’s previous experience, the higher the Companion Beast’s level, the longer it took to evolve. It would be considered quick if a Companion Beast took about half a month to advance to the Terror grade.

It could take as long as months. It was impossible for Zhou Wen to wait that long and do nothing.

There was still an endless sea of flowers around him. Apart from that, there was nothing else. Apart from flowers, there was no vitality in the world.

The vitality of the flowers was very strange. They looked brimming with vitality, but they also had a deathly aura that resembled ashes.

“Grim Demon, what else do you know about the Land of the Fallen?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.

“Nothing much… By the way… I seem to remember hearing an angel mention it… The Land of the Fallen is also called a Lost Paradise… It’s a place without happiness with eternal misfortune…” Grim Demon said as he tried his best to recall.

When Zhou Wen heard the words “Lost Paradise,” he thought of a mythical epic called “Lost Paradise.” The story was related to Satan.

After Satan was defeated, he was banished to hell by God, but Satan was unwilling to admit defeat. He waited for an opportunity to seek revenge.

Satan finally found an opportunity to turn into a snake and entered the Garden of Eden. He tempted Adam and Eve to secretly eat the forbidden fruit. In the end, Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden.

This was only a mythical epic. Even if there was really the Garden of Eden, it was difficult to say if there was Adam and Eve.

Is Sweetie living in the Garden of Eden? Zhou Wen suddenly thought of Sweetie, but he couldn’t associate her image with the omnipotent God.

Grim Demon recalled some hearsay information, but it didn’t help Zhou Wen’s present situation. He still couldn’t think of a way to leave.

“Hell is a prison used to imprison devils. Even in the dimension, this is an extremely special place. It’s definitely not that easy to leave this place. Let’s wait for my lady to wake up before making plans.” Grim Demon tried his best to persuade Zhou Wen not to act rashly.

Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of loneliness. It wasn’t a problem for him to stay here for a few years, but something could happen at Guide City at any time. Zhou Wen was afraid that Li Xuan and company wouldn’t be able to handle it.

After some thought, Zhou Wen carried Demonic Neonate and walked away. He decided to give it a try.

However, as Zhou Wen walked, he discovered something very magical. When he walked forward, the flowers in front of him automatically parted to make a path.

These flowers can move on their own? Then why didn’t I see them move before? Zhou Wen attempted to walk in another direction.

However, no matter where Zhou Wen went, the flowers in front of him automatically made way as though they were avoiding him.

Zhou Wen glanced at Demonic Neonate in his arms and said to Grim Demon, “Walk to the other side.”

Grim Demon walked to the side, but the flowers didn’t make way for him.

“Take her.” Zhou Wen handed Demonic Neonate to Grim Demon and tried it himself. Like Grim Demon, the flowers didn’t make way for him.

It was obvious that the flowers were making way for Demonic Neonate.

This didn’t happen when I summoned Demonic Neonate. From the looks of it, it’s because Demonic Neonate ate that gem. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and carried Demonic Neonate as he continued walking forward.

Wherever Zhou Wen or Demonic Neonate went, the flowers avoided them, forming a path between the flowers. Zhou Wen walked along with it. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Not long after, Zhou Wen and Grim Demon were surprised to discover that they had reached the end of the sea of flowers. In the distance, they could see a continuous mountain range.

They could see smoke billowing. A small city sat at the foot of the mountain.
