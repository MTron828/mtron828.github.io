Chapter 1021: Evil Puppeteer

Translator: CKtalon

It was very difficult to communicate in the Maze of Lies. This was because the silencer had used Silence on them. Usually, they could communicate through handwritten words, but in an emergency, it depended on everyone’s reaction.

“Retreat now.” Gaiman didn’t have the time to write too many words. He only wrote two words for everyone to see before retreating towards the door.

Clearly, Gaiman and company didn’t know what was about to appear. They had only explored the parts related to Witch Castle in the past and hadn’t explored all of the Maze of Lies, nor had they seen all the dimensional creatures.

However, Zhou Wen had explored the entire maze. He had seen almost all the dimensional creatures inside.

Although he had never seen the three-headed wolf’s corpse self-destruct, he could roughly guess the dimensional creature that was about to arrive from its sound.

If that thing really comes, those people who are stained with the three-headed wolf’s blood won’t have it easy. Zhou Wen swept his gaze and quickly confirmed who the people stained with the blood were.

Wang Lu, who was by Zhou Wen’s side, wasn’t stained by the wolf blood. Zhou Wen was relieved when he saw that Lance wasn’t stained with the wolf blood either.

However, nine out of the seventeen people were stained with wolf blood. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown slightly. The self-destruction of the three-headed wolf was really timely. It happened to self-destruct in the middle of everyone. Could it be that it was a suicide bomber?

Upon thinking of this possibility, Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. If the three-headed wolf was really sending itself to its death, the Maze of Lies in reality was much more terrifying than in-game.

The dimensional creatures in the game kept to their own territories. They would only appear when they were triggered.

The three-headed wolf in real life had run over and infected so many people with its wolf blood. This was to pave the way for another dimensional creature to appear.

When everyone retreated to the door, they stood in formation with their backs against the exit. The Companion Beasts were also prepared to fight as they looked in the direction of the strange sound.

Soon, everyone saw blood-colored puppets appear everywhere. They looked like humans and were very well-made. They were even wearing clothes.

However, at their joints, thin threads extended into the distance.

It’s indeed the Devil Puppeteer. Zhou Wen knew that his guess was right when he saw the puppets.

However, in-game, the Devil Puppeteer was in the Puppet Hall and wouldn’t run out by himself.

Yet, here he was. Furthermore, those people had already been stained with the blood of the three-headed wolf. It happened to match the skill of the Devil Puppeteer. In a while, those who were stained with the wolf blood would probably become puppets.

Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s guess.

If the Devil Puppeteer had tampered with the three-headed wolf in advance, the blood could be used by him. If he hadn’t tampered with it in advance, the people who were stained with the three-headed wolf’s blood wouldn’t be affected.

Gaiman and company ordered their Companion Beasts to attack the puppets, but in the next second, some were horrified at what happened.

Strange threads appeared on the bodies of the people stained with wolf blood. The threads were like puppets that extended deep into the maze.

The people and Companion Beasts with fine threads on their bodies found that they were no longer in control of their bodies. They seemed to be controlled by the threads as they lunged at their companions.

Such an unforeseen event exceeded everyone’s expectations. It was a mess.

Before they could meet the Destiny Witches, they were already having in-fighting.

The puppets also rushed forward to join the battle. The scene became extremely chaotic.

Gaiman wanted to sever the threads on those people and see if he could save them. Unfortunately, when their weapons slashed down at the threads, they found the threads akin to flowing water. The threads didn’t break under the weapons’ slices.

Zhou Wen had long expected this outcome. He pulled Wang Lu back and waited for the Devil Puppeteer to appear.

Killing these puppets was useless. The puppeteer had countless puppets, so it was useless to decrease their numbers. He had to wait for the puppeteer to appear before killing him.

Gaiman and company clearly realized the problem. They also wanted to find the dimensional creature controlling the puppets. One even charged in the direction of the threads.

From Zhou Wen’s point of view, these actions were futile. Like Demonic Neonate, the puppeteer was very good at hiding himself. He was a fellow who liked to kill others while in hiding. It was impossible to find him by following the threads. It would only place one in danger.

Indeed, after the person rushed over with his Companion Beast, there was quickly nothing from him. He was nowhere to be seen, not even his corpse.

“Let’s follow the threads and rush over together.” Gaiman wrote a few words wanting to follow the threads on the puppets.

The puppets revived after being killed. It was useless killing them anymore. They had to kill the person controlling the puppet.

“Do not go over.” Zhou Wen wrote on the cardboard.

When he first encountered the puppeteer, he had suffered the same way. He thought that he could find the puppeteer by following the threads, but what awaited him was a death trap.

“If we don’t go over, death awaits us. We can only go.” Gaiman quickly wrote.

“According to the agreement, I call the shots. Stay here. No one is allowed to go over.” Zhou Wen quickly wrote a line.

“Give me a reason,” Gaiman wrote as he stared at Zhou Wen.

“I think only by staying here will there be a chance of survival. Going over will only lead to death.” Zhou Wen wrote.

“Staying here is the only way to die. Mr. Gaiman, don’t worry about him. Let’s rush over and capture the fellow who controls Old Liu and the others.” One person wrote a line before rushing towards the other end of the threads.

Zhou Wen had no reason to stop others if they were suicidal. After all, their lives had nothing to do with him.

The others were also eager to give it a try. Clearly, they felt that if this continued, unless they killed all their controlled people and puppets, there was no chance of survival.

“Give Zhou Wen a chance.” As Lance controlled his Companion Beasts to circle around the puppets, he rushed over and raised the board in his hand.

As communication was inconvenient, many people wanted to say something, but they had no time to write in battle. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Gaiman looked at the spot where the person had gone and saw that he had vanished silently like the previous person. Finally, he gritted his teeth and ordered everyone to continue resisting the puppet’s attack. He gave up the thought of following the threads.

However, their situation became worse and worse. This was because nine people had been controlled. When they fought the nine people, it wasn’t appropriate for them to kill them. This resulted in them being at a disadvantage.

Furthermore, with a large number of puppets charging at them, it became increasingly difficult for them to deal with them.
