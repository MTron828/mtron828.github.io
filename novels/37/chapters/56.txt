Chapter 57 Quarrel

“As expected of Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks. They are truly extraordinary. It appears this blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus will likely be slain by Yang Lie,” Li Xuan said.

Zhou Wen shook his head and whispered, “Not necessarily. The blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus can’t be slain by just two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks.”

Zhou Wen’s research on the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was nothing these students could compare with. He was acutely aware of how powerful the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was. It was impossible to slay it with just two Legendary Companion Beasts capable of flight.

Perhaps intentionally or unintentionally, An Jing happened to shoot Zhou Wen a look when he said those words.

Li Xuan was just about to ask why when the lotus pond experienced an anomaly. One of the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk rushed right in front of the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus and was swallowed by the latter’s petals that opened like a gaping mouth.

Just as the other Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk was about touch the petals with its talons that were glimmering in gold light, the blood patterns on the petals-a sitting Buddha-shot out beams of sanguine light. What seemed like a fragile petal remained undamaged after clashing with the hawk’s talons.

When the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus opened its petals again, the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk which had been devoured was reduced to bone. Furthermore, the bones were rapidly melting.

The students watching this battle gasped. It was shocking that the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus could devour the Legendary Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk and instantly corrode its bones.

It even managed to resist the Golden Halo Talons of the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk, a Primordial Energy Skill. It was quite shocking.

Flower-type dimensional creatures typically were rather weak in Constitution. Amongst dimensional creatures of the same stage, their Constitution usually lined the bottom.

However, the fact that this blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus was able to withstand a powerful Legendary Primordial Energy Skill like Golden Halo Talons made it terrifying. It overturned the average person’s understanding of flower-type creatures.

Yang Lie’s expression was livid. He didn’t dare order his Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawk to continue attacking as he summoned the surviving one back.

All the students looked at the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus with fear and greed. It clearly had more than one Primordial Energy Skill. If it dropped as a Companion Beast, they could possess a Companion Beast with more than one Primordial Energy Skill.

However, the chances of Companion Beasts dropping were low to begin with. Furthermore, with Yang Lie’s two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks suffering a defeat, it meant that no student could currently kill it.

“How did you know that the two Hawks weren’t a match for the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus?” Only then did Li Xuan have the chance to ask the question that was eating at him.

“It was obvious to the eye.” Zhou Wen shrugged, preparing to leave the area. It was unlikely that the students could kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus anytime soon. This lotus flower was probably a top existence among Legendary creatures. Unless one had even more powerful Companion Beasts or was capable of targeting its weak points, even a siege against it wouldn’t be of much use.

“Brother Wen, since you were able to tell that the Hawks weren’t the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s match, doesn’t that mean that you have the means to kill it?” Xu Miantu’s eyes lit up as he asked Zhou Wen.

Xu Miantu wasn’t much to speak of. He wasn’t a bad man either, but he was someone who shot his mouth off. He hadn’t suppressed his voice, allowing people around them to hear him.

Yang Lie was already in a bad mood, so when he heard Xu Miantu, he turned his head and saw that it was Li Xuan, Xu Miantu, and an unfamiliar youth, he immediately felt even more infuriated.

Li Xuan was well known to be a foppish person in Luoyang. Together with an adopted son of the Li family, Xu Miantu, Yang Lie naturally knew how much they amounted to. It could even be said that he viewed them with contempt.

Yang Lie often imagined that if he were Li Xuan and had all the resources of the Li family, he would be able to achieve so much more.

Xu Miantu’s unintentional question sounded like a mockery to Yang Lie.

“To be able to tell at a glance that the hawks aren’t the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s match. Not a bad eye. Might I know how you should be addressed?” Yang Lie held back his anger and asked Zhou Wen as he sized him up.

Although he was angry, he wasn’t willing to offend students with significant backing. After all, the students of Sunset College were the elites of East District. Many of them had strong backers.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word, but Xu Miantu drummed up support for him. “Zhou Wen got second in the combat test of Guide City. He’s the number one genius of Guide High School. He’s Brother Xuan’s buddy!”

Xu Miantu didn’t brag emptily but was trying to use this opportunity to make Zhou Wen known to all, making students of Sunset College know of his existence.

This brought about plenty of benefits. In the future, when they formed teams to enter dimensional zones to complete the missions handed out by the school, other strong students would be willing to team up with Zhou Wen.

Otherwise, if Zhou Wen was unknown to everyone, how would those strong students be willing to team up with him? It was already a very common way of societal thinking for the strong to ally together.

However, those who heard Xu Miantu looked at him and Zhou Wen with a look of mockery. It wasn’t only Yang Lie, but all the other students as well.

Many students in Sunset College had the accolades of being the number one genius of so-and-so high school or first in the combat test of so-and-so city. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had only gotten second place. Others weren’t even interested in who got first place, much less second place.

If it were first place in places like Beijing, people might have paid some attention. However, a tiny city like Guide City wasn’t worth paying any attention to.

When Yang Lie heard that Zhou Wen had come in second at the Guide City’s combat test, he knew that Zhou Wen likely didn’t have much of a background. Otherwise, he would have obtained first place. Only those who obtained the first place of a city could receive certain privileges and resources from the Sunset College. This was also one of the reasons why Li Xuan needed to get first.

“Second place. That’s pretty impressive,” Yang Lie quipped. “In that case, I would like to know what amazing strategy you have to kill that blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.”

The other students could naturally tell that Yang Lie was being sarcastic. They were freshmen and only at the Mortal stage. They weren’t even close to the Legendary stage, so it was obvious that they didn’t have the qualifications to kill top Legendary creatures like the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus.

Xu Miantu couldn’t tolerate the treatment as he curled his lips and said in disdain, “Are you a fool or do you think of us as fools? Why should we tell you the strategy we’ve come up with?”

Ever since the battle at Guide Ancient City, Xu Miantu was truly impressed with Zhou Wen. He strongly believed that Zhou Wen had the means to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Since it was a given, he naturally wouldn’t tell others of the strategy.

But his words only amused Yang Lie. “Alright. There’s no need to tell me. Don’t you have the strategy? Isn’t being second in Guide City impressive? Fine then, slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Please broaden our horizons.”
