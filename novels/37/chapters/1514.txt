Chapter 1515 Immortal Vanquishing Palm

“So that’s all there is after saying so much? Shall I entertain you? So that you can return home in peace?” Li Xuan felt his heart itch when he saw Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu in the limelight. He also wanted to be in the limelight, so he stepped forward and spoke to Berserker Immortal.

Li Xuan’s appetite was much bigger than Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu’s. He wanted to finish off the leading Berserker Immortal.

Zither Immortal and Chess Immortal were enraged, having the urge to rush forward to teach Li Xuan a lesson, but they were stopped by Berserker Immortal.

“Alright, I’ll entertain you.” Berserker Immortal’s voice was calm and even carried a smiling tone, but he was already filled with killing intent.

He knew that it was impossible for him to easily subdue Zhou Wen and company today. He needed to suppress them with absolute strength, and Li Xuan was his opening gambit.

“Let’s begin,” Berserker Immortal said to Li Xuan as he stood there casually.

Although all of them were using ancient corpses, Berserker Immortal’s body was slightly stronger than the four immortals. It could constantly pump out strength at the Human Realm, and he could just produce a burst of strength at the Hell level.

Furthermore, Berserker Immortal’s realm far exceeded his peers. Even if he could only produce strength at the Human Realm, his combat strength was not something ordinary humans could compare with.

He got Li Xuan to attack first to give him a chance to strike.

“I’m afraid I’ll kill you with one punch. It’s best you attack first,” Li Xuan said proudly as he stood still like a mountain. At the same time, he thought to himself, You are still too young to posture in front of me. I never lose when it comes to posturing.

“Is that so?” Berserker Immortal’s eyes narrowed as they landed on Li Xuan.

“When…” Li Xuan’s eyes suddenly widened just as he said a word. His eyes nearly popped out as he opened his mouth and spat out blood. His body curled like a shrimp.

Berserker Immortal was already standing in front of him at some point in time and had struck his chest with a hand.

Bang!

Li Xuan’s chest sank as he hunched his body and flew backward like a cannonball. He slammed into the wall and toppled it, his body plowing a deep ravine that was hundreds of meters long.

Due to the speed and immense friction, the soil and bricks in the deep ditch emitted smoke. The attenuated ends of the steel columns turned dark red as though they had been burned.

“Silence at last. Now, we can have a good chat,” Berserker Immortal said to Zhou Wen.

The surrounding people had already caught wind of the commotion, but with the soldiers stopping them, no one could come over. They could only watch from afar.

“What do you want to talk about? I’m all ears.” A voice sounded from a distant ravine, leaving Berserker Immortal slightly taken aback.

Berserker Immortal turned his head and indeed, he saw Li Xuan walk out of the deep ravine. His armor had shattered, but there were no injuries on his bare chest.

His firm chest and abs were exposed. They were smooth and majestic, so perfect that they didn’t look like a human’s, but like a marble statue.

“You should be proud to be able to withstand my strike without dying,” said Berserker Immortal.

Li Xuan walked over step by step and stared at Berserker Immortal. “Your strength isn’t bad, but it’s still too soft. You can try using more strength.”

When Berserker Immortal heard Li Xuan, his eyes sank as he broke through the sound barrier. The sonic boom blasted a huge crater in the ground.

Li Xuan wanted to block, but he was ultimately too slow. He was once again hit in the chest by Berserker Immortal.

However, this time, Berserker Immortal’s strength didn’t send Li Xuan flying. Li Xuan remained standing in his original spot, but the terrifying force penetrated his body, instantly rupturing his bones and organs.

Berserker Immortal gracefully retracted his palm and waited for Li Xuan’s body to reduce to mud.

He was very confident in his strength. Although Li Xuan’s body was very powerful, even a Human Realm creature would be reduced to meat paste under his palm’s hidden force.

Berserker Immortal stood there waiting for Li Xuan to collapse, but Li Xuan remained standing there motionless even after some time. There were no signs of him collapsing. There wasn’t even any blood seeping out of his seven orifices. This made Berserker Immortal feel that something was amiss.

“Is that all you got? I told you to use more strength. Why is it softer than the first palm strike? Have you not eaten? Do you want to eat something before continuing?” Li Xuan looked at Berserker Immortal and said provocatively.

The four immortals looked at Li Xuan in surprise. They knew about Berserker Immortal’s Immortal Vanquishing Palm.

Although Berserker Immortal’s palm force wasn’t as terrifying as his sword, it didn’t mean that his palm force wasn’t strong. On the contrary, it was extremely sinister. Very few creatures of the same level could withstand the hidden force of the Immortal Vanquishing Palm.

Berserker Immortal had already used his Calamity-grade strength; yet, he failed to kill Li Xuan. Li Xuan didn’t even look injured. This left the four immortals somewhat incredulous. They even wondered if this was a dream.

The four immortals looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

They never expected such a situation to happen before coming here.

They originally imagined that it wouldn’t be difficult to suppress a factionless Zhou Wen, but the people who were beside him were each more terrifying than the last.

Even the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association might not have so many terrifying figures. “What the hell. Where did these people come from? Why isn’t there any intelligence on them? Are the fellows from the League of Guardians doing their job?” Painting Immortal said angrily.

“Immortal must be up to no good. He deliberately didn’t report it,” said Zither Immortal.

However, Chess Immortal shook his head and said, “I don’t think so. If they are really very famous, even if the League of Guardians doesn’t report it, it’s impossible to not have any news from the Holy Temple. For there to be no news from the Holy Temple as well, it can only mean that they aren’t very famous.”

The attention that the dimension paid to humans was concentrated on the especially famous people like Immortal, Ya, or the Zhang family’s Zhang Chunqiu.

Although Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan were somewhat famous in the Federation, they hadn’t reached that level.

There was no need to mention Li Xuan. At home, outsiders only knew that Li Mobai was the head of the Li family.

When out, Li Xuan was always with Zhou Wen. He basically didn’t have any chance to showcase himself. Outsiders didn’t know that there was a figure like the Li family’s third scion.

But in fact, even Zhong Ziya and Qin Yan weren’t completely confident of defeating Li Xuan. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Berserker Immortal’s eyes turned serious as he looked at Li Xuan and said, “It’s not bad for a human to cultivate the Invincible Connate Divine Art of the Connate Holy Temple to such an extent. Unfortunately, it’s only an incomplete fake. Ignoring a fake Invincible Connate Divine Art like yours, even if you were to master the real Invincible Connate Divine Art, you wouldn’t be able to live if I wanted you dead.”
