Chapter 1567: Tiger Soul General Appears

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen didn’t plan on escaping. He was thinking about which Companion Beast to send.

He originally didn’t plan on fighting, but the situation made it clear that it was almost impossible for Jiuyang to win. At most, he would severely injure Starlord Ravenous Wolf or kill one in exchange for his life.

It was a waste not to pick up such a bargain. After all, this was the Calamity-grade Starlord Ravenous Wolf. In-game, Zhou Wen might have to clear all the dungeons in the Big Dipper instance dungeon before he would respawn again. Two of them had now appeared in real life. If a Companion Beast dropped, he would be making a killing.

Zhou Wen planned on finishing off the two Starlord Ravenous Wolves when Jiuyang was at his wits’ end.

Which Companion Beast should I send? The Golden Wyrm Scissors makes it too obvious. It’s more suitable to keep it as a trump card.?After some thought, Zhou Wen planned on letting the Tiger Soul General who had just advanced to the Calamity grade fight.

The Tiger Soul General was extremely suitable for the Big Dipper dimensional zone. He definitely needed it to appear in the future. It was only a matter of time.

Furthermore, the Tiger Soul General’s appearance was very different from before. Even people who had seen it in the past would definitely not recognize it.

After all, ordinary people didn’t have the ability to fuse Companion Beasts, nor could they imagine that a Companion Beast would undergo such a huge change. They wouldn’t associate it with the same Companion Beast. At most, they would think that it was a Companion Beast of the same type.

I’ll let the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General get some training then.?

With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

After all, it needed to gather strength ahead of time. Only then would it be unbeatable. Being at the Human Realm, it would have to waste time gathering strength to kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf.

After the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General appeared, it was struck by high-temperature radiation and light blasts. The flames within his body immediately burned vigorously as though something was swimming in its armor.

Zhou Wen got the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to stand beside him while waiting for an opportunity to attack.

The spectators were greatly surprised when they saw a Companion Beast appear beside Unlucky Egg. They couldn’t help but size it up.

Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General now looked pretty cool. Its entire appearance was extremely imposing, like a mechanical warrior riding a mechanical tiger. Its body was still burning with terrifying flames. In its hand was an odd-looking spear that seemed high-tech. Its entire appearance was like a high-tech mecha knight from the future world.

“What Companion Beast is that? It looks very cool.”

“What’s the point of looking good? Don’t you see that Unlucky Egg doesn’t dare let it attack?”

“Currently, no Companion Beast owned by humans can fight a Calamity-grade creature, right?”

“Since it can withstand the high-temperature radiation, it should be at the Terror grade.”

“From the flames on his body, I can tell that he’s a fire-elemental Companion Beast. It’s not surprising that he can withstand high-temperature radiation.”

“Professor Gu, what do you think of the Companion Beast summoned by Unlucky Egg? Can you determine its level?” The host, Su Yi, chatted with Professor Gu on the program.

“Based on his appearance and the abilities he displayed, he should be at the Terror grade at the very least. However, the possibility of him being at the Calamity grade isn’t high,” Professor Gu said.

“Why? Is it because humans do not have Calamity-grade Companion Beasts yet?” Su Yi asked in puzzlement.

Professor Gu smiled and said, “There are already Calamity-grade Companion Beasts among humans. It’s something I’ve seen with my own eyes, but it’s not the time to reveal which Companion Beast. However, I’m certain that it’s not the one on the screen. Furthermore, if Unlucky Egg has a Calamity-grade Companion Beast that can fight Starlord Ravenous Wolf, he wouldn’t have tried heading for the teleportation nexus. Previously, he had already decided to give up and leave. This means that he doesn’t have the confidence to fight. Therefore, I’m guessing that the Companion Beast isn’t at the Calamity grade. It’s most likely at the Terror grade.”

“I see. Since it’s only a Terror-grade Companion Beast and can’t fight Starlord Ravenous Wolf, what’s the point of summoning it now?” Su Yi asked again.

“It’s naturally difficult for a Terror-grade Companion Beast to fight a Calamity-grade creature. However, if Saint Jiuyang and the two Starlord Ravenous Wolves fight to an internecine outcome, he might still stand a chance,” Professor Gu said.

“Are you saying that Unlucky Egg wants to pick up the spoils? Is that possible?” Su Yi said in surprise.

“Although the chances aren’t high, if he succeeds, he might be able to kill two Calamity-grade creatures in one fell swoop. If he’s lucky, he will be elevated to success once a Companion Egg drops. After all, such an opportunity can’t be encountered at any time. Without Saint Jiuyang, there wouldn’t be such a chance. It’s normal for some people to be blinded by huge benefits,” Professor Gu said.

“Then can Unlucky Egg clinch this rare opportunity? Let’s wait and see.” Su Yi was also very curious about the outcome.

The people watching the program were crazily commenting on this matter. Most people believed that Unlucky Egg was taking too much risk. The chances of success were too low, so the best choice was to take the opportunity to teleport away. Otherwise, he might very well die there.

Bang! Bang!

Two consecutive attacks landed on Jiuyang, causing the Sun God armor on his body to dim. Cracks crisscrossed the armor.

Must I use that power??Jiuyang felt a little bitter. He had always been unwilling to use that power because it made him feel like a puppet without any value.

Therefore, he would rather use his own techniques to fight than use that power.

But at this point, he no longer had a choice.

“Do you need help?” Jiuyang suddenly heard a voice and couldn’t help but be taken aback.

Although he had been fighting with all his might, he didn’t give up on monitoring Zhou Wen to prevent him from causing trouble while he was fighting.

Jiuyang had also seen Zhou Wen summon the Tiger Soul General. Like Professor Gu and most people, he believed that Zhou Wen wanted to take advantage of the situation when he and the Starlord Ravenous Wolves were mutually injured.

Although Jiuyang knew that he wouldn’t give Zhou Wen such a chance, he never expected Zhou Wen to say such words.

Jiuyang’s heart stirred as he temporarily gave up on using that power. As he fought bitterly, he asked, “How are you going to help me?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Get out of the way,” Zhou Wen said as he ordered the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to charge at the Starlord Ravenous Wolves.

This place was very suitable for the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. During this period of time, the power accumulated by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had reached a level that surprised Zhou Wen.

The high temperature and energy blasts of Dubhe, as well as Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ blasts of light, gave the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General time to quickly accumulate the energy of the demonic flames in its body.

Now, the terrifying demonic flames in the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body were like a bomb that could explode at any moment.
