Chapter 897: Possibility

Translator: CKtalon

I never expected the destructive power of a tiny Essence Energy Pill to be so powerful. If I can advance it to a Perfect Body, its destructive power should be comparable to a relatively low-level Mythical weapon, right? Zhou Wen was somewhat delighted.

His Life Soul didn’t have a pure destructive Life Soul. The downside was that the Life Soul was only a pellet and couldn’t be used as a weapon.

How can I advance the Essence Energy Pill to a Perfect Body? Should I continue absorbing Essence Energy? Zhou Wen attempted to continue absorbing the Essence Energy in the Essence Energy Crystals, and it turned out to be useful.

The Qi Refinement Art is really unique. As long as I have enough Essence Energy, I can resolve all problems. Such an Essence Energy Art can be quickly mastered as long as I have the resources. It’s very suitable to be popularized among humans. Zhou Wen was still thinking of promoting Essence Energy Arts in the future.

The Essence Energy Pill can slowly absorb Essence Energy. Glimmer requires me to walk outside. The advancement of these two Life Souls only requires time. However, the Civilized Country and the Demon God Catalog are somewhat troublesome. Civilized Country needs a large number of teleportations. I have to think of a way to get a pet that can teleport. The Demon God Catalog needs the blood of a Guardian. From the looks of it, I must think of a solution using The Thearch. Zhou Wen thought about how he could obtain The Thearch’s blood essence.

The Thearch wants me to meet her at Chess Mountain. This is a chance. Perhaps I can settle that alchemist when I obtain the blood essence. Zhou Wen thought of all sorts of possibilities.

Unfortunately, there was no news of the alchemist. He didn’t know if the alchemist had given up on pursuing him.

“Young Master Wen, haven’t you been searching for Companion Beasts that can teleport?” An Sheng called with good news.

“There’s news?” Zhou Wen was delighted.

“It’s not easy to find such a Companion Beast. However, recently, a break-out creature that’s suspected to be able to teleport has appeared on the eastern coast. If you are interested, you can try your luck. You can also do me a favor as a result,” An Sheng said.

“What happened?” Zhou Wen asked.

An Sheng roughly explained the situation. Due to the appearance of the break-out creature, the nearby cities suffered heavy losses. A local wealthy family there had business dealings with the An family.

The An family’s Essence Energy compression accelerator required an important supplementary material. It was mainly provided by that family.

They were now asking the An family for help. If the An family could help them eliminate the break-out creature, not only would they obtain the materials at low prices, but the family would also prioritize providing them the materials in the future.

There were very few materials produced. Many places in the Federation needed them. The An family wasn’t the only family that was willing to help them eliminate the break-out creatures. However, no one had succeeded so far.

The main reason was that the break-out creature had a powerful spatial ability. It could teleport continuously and it was very difficult to trap it. Even if one had the ability to kill it, they wouldn’t be able to catch up to it.

An Sheng then transmitted the detailed information about the break-out creature to Zhou Wen. In the video he received, Zhou Wen discovered that it was a dimensional creature that looked a little like a Qilin. Its body was as colorful as colored glass, and it ran extremely fast. Furthermore, it could instantly vanish. It would then appear elsewhere. It was undoubtedly a spatial teleportation ability.

Zhou Wen carefully studied the video. As the break-out creature was too fast, even high-speed cameras couldn’t capture a complete image. If he slowed down the video, there would be some missing parts.

However, from the video, it could be seen that the break-out creature’s combat strength was very strong. Apart from its spatial teleportation abilities, its physical combat strength was also tremendous. It also had powerful single-target and group-target Essence Energy Skills. It was a very comprehensive Mythical creature with almost no obvious weaknesses.

In terms of combat strength, Tyrant Behemoth is definitely not inferior to it. The main point is that its spatial teleportation ability is too powerful. It won’t be easy to kill it. Zhou Wen was already tempted. If not for such powerful spatial teleportation abilities, it wouldn’t be worth him taking the risk.

However, before the problem of the alchemist was resolved, Zhou Wen was afraid that the alchemist would find him after he left Luoyang. When that happened, it wouldn’t be easy for him to run to Chess Mountain.

“I’m very interested in that break-out creature, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to go over before resolving the alchemist problem,” Zhou Wen said to An Sheng.

“There’s no rush. No one can deal with that break-out creature yet. There’s still a chance if you go later.” An Sheng paused before continuing, “We can’t wait for the alchemist to come. Why don’t we think of a way to lure him over?”

“How? Don’t tell me you want to use me as bait?” Zhou Wen immediately guessed An Sheng’s intentions.

An Sheng said, “According to what you said, the banana fan in the Sun True Flames Furnace has already been absorbed by your Companion Beast. It’s useless even if that alchemist kills you, but he is still stubbornly chasing after you. There should be another reason for this. Think about it carefully and you should be able to come up with something. Perhaps we can use this point to lure him over and let him have a taste of the Essence Energy compression accelerator.”

“Forget it. Your accelerators require too much preparation time. Energy is also a problem.” Zhou Wen rejected An Sheng’s good intentions.

However, An Sheng’s suggestion gave Zhou Wen some inspiration.

It wasn’t reliable to rely on the An family’s accelerator to eliminate the alchemist, but it was a good way to lure him to Chess Mountain.

If it wasn’t for the sun banana fan, why would the alchemist chase after me? Zhou Wen thought of the purple bronze ball that Liu Yun had given him before he left, as well as the things he had taken from the stone house.

It should be these things, right? After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there was only one possibility. Apart from that, he didn’t take anything out of the Founding Emperor Tomb.

I can give it a try. Zhou Wen didn’t know if these things could lure the alchemist over, but he could give it a try. After all, he could only wait.

Zhou Wen decided to take the purple bronze ball and pill-related items to Chess Mountain to see if he could lure the alchemist over.

Xu Ai hadn’t been in a good mood the past few days. She had come to the An family mainly because she wanted to obtain information on the An family’s Essence Energy weapons. However, after arriving, she had only seen An Tianzuo once. She didn’t even have the chance to speak to him, much less go to the An family’s weapon factory. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Miss, I’ve found out that the An family values the material—Magic Dust. As for the Lu family, which mainly produces Magic Dust, they have been seeking help everywhere recently because of a break-out creature. Furthermore, the Lu family is willing to use large amounts of Magic Dust as payment. At the same time, they are also willing to provide Magic Dust’s priority purchase rights. If we can obtain these rights, the An family will likely take the initiative to cooperate with us.” The female guard sent the news to Xu Ai.
