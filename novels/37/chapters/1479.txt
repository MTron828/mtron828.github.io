Chapter 1480 Holy Spring Well

It can’t be that coincidental, right!? Zhou Wen muttered inwardly.

The behemoth in the stone pavilion looked like a bear no matter how he looked at it. It was a giant bear with grayish-blue fur. Zhou Wen’s present appearance was somewhat similar to it.

This little beast isn’t a cat! It’s a bear? Aren’t you too deceptive looking like that? Zhou Wen sensed that the bear’s aura was extremely terrifying. Before it flew into a rage, its aura surged like a tsunami. Even Zhou Wen was alarmed. It was definitely at the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen had always been reverent towards creatures like bears.

Many people found bears stupid, nothing but fools that were easily bullied. Zhou Wen had thought so too when he was young.

However, in middle school, Yu Qiubai had given a lecture about bear legends. It completely overturned Zhou Wen’s understanding of bears. This made him subconsciously take more care every time he saw bear-type dimensional creatures.

In fact, in the early myths and legends of the East District, bears occupied a very important position.

Yellow Emperor Xuan Yuan had a bear lineage. In the legends of Yu the Great’s control of water, Yu the Great had also transformed into a bear and fought all sorts of water beasts. Before the Spring and Autumn War, there were many legends regarding divine bears—they were also the earliest form of totem worship. The rise of dragons only happened in the later generations.

The reason why ancient people worshiped bears so much was not only because of their immense strength and impressive combat prowess, but also because of the bears’ hibernation habits. A bear could avoid food and water for months. When it appeared again, it would give people the feeling that life had returned. Therefore, ancient people worshiped bears very much.

Even the legendary Chaos Beasts were very likely to be created using bears as blueprints in certain versions.

After hearing Yu Qiubai’s lecture, Zhou Wen’s impression of bears changed significantly. Therefore, when he saw a Calamity-grade bear, he subconsciously became cautious and didn’t attack immediately.

The giant bear only stared at him without attacking

The giant bear’s blood-red eyes looked at the tiny beast beside it before looking at Zhou Wen as though it was in a dilemma.

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. So that’s how it is. It can’t tell who its child is. That’s why it’s so hesitant and hasn’t taken action.

As Zhou Wen was pondering over the matter, the giant bear got up and walked out of the stone pavilion. It circled around Zhou Wen and the baby bear a few times before reaching out its claws and throwing Zhou Wen and the baby bear onto its back.

Zhou Wen was given a fright. Thankfully, his mental fortitude was sufficiently robust. He resisted the urge to attack as he found himself on the bear’s back.

Which bastard said that the Calamity creature here looks something like a lion or tiger, but not like either? It’s a freaking bear! Many thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind as he sat on the bear’s back.

With his current position, it was undoubtedly the best opportunity to assassinate the bear. All he needed to do was pull out the Immortal Culling Sword and strike the bear’s neck or other relatively weaker spots. Perhaps he could have Calamity-grade bear meat for his meal today.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but gulp.

However, Zhou Wen quickly rejected this thought. A Calamity-grade creature doesn’t have negative intelligence, right? Even if it can’t tell who’s its child, doesn’t it know how many children it has?

This clearly didn’t make sense. The bear placed both creatures on its back despite knowing that one creature wasn’t its child. That meant that something had to be wrong. From the looks of it, this bear definitely wants to trick me. There must be a conspiracy. That must be the case. I can’t act rashly. I can’t let it see through me. I’ll figure out its scheme first. Zhou Wen resisted the urge to assassinate the bear.

The bear shook its body from side to side as it slowly walked through the forest.

Its body was huge, but as it moved, its body seemed to turn into a blue phantom. When its body slammed into the trees or other vegetation, it passed right through them.

Even Zhou Wen and the baby bear were affected by this power.

Zhou Wen watched as the trees passed through his body as though they were illusory. It left him greatly surprised.

Zhou Wen was proficient in spatial powers. He was also proficient in spatial teleportation and spatial traversal. He was very certain that this was not a spatial ability.

How strange. What are the origins of this bear? With its level and ability, there aren’t many creatures on Earth that can fight it. Does it need to hide from its enemies and come to a place like Laojun Platform? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more puzzled he became.

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that there was something wrong with the bear’s origins, so he didn’t dare attack haphazardly.

The bear carried Zhou Wen and the baby bear as it slowly walked deeper into Mingdao Palace. Be it the forest or various buildings, nothing could stop the bear from advancing.

It was like a ghost that didn’t exist in the world. It walked through the mortal world without being bound by anything in it.

Zhou Wen saw all sorts of buildings and ancient trees. There were many dimensional creatures lurking around, but they didn’t dare approach the bear. They quickly retreated once they discovered it.

They retreated, but not in fear. Furthermore, after retreating, they looked at the giant bear from afar. It was obvious that they weren’t especially afraid.

Could it be that this fellow wants to take me to Laojun Platform? What motives does it have? How does this benefit it? Could it be that there’s something on Laojun Platform that allows it to determine who its real child is? Just as Zhou Wen was guessing, the bear slowly stopped and didn’t continue walking forward.

Zhou Wen looked around and realized that he hadn’t arrived at Laojun Platform. In front of the giant bear was an ancient well with a water pump and a wooden bucket. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this point, the bear sprawled down and lifted Zhou Wen and the baby bear down to the side of the well. Then, like a human, it picked up the wooden bucket and placed it in the well. It shook the wooden rack, hoping to draw some water.

What’s this fellow up to? Zhou Wen sized up the surroundings and saw the words “Holy Spring Well” engraved on a rock. He immediately knew where he was.

Holy Spring Well was rather famous. Legend had it that when Laojun was about to ascend, his mount, Azure Bull, who was chained to the side of the well, seemed to know that its master was about to leave. It couldn’t help but moo and cry as tears of blood flowed down its eyes.

Laojun couldn’t bear to part with the Azure Bull either, but the Azure Bull was mortal, so it was impossible for it to ascend with him.

Helpless, Laojun poured a calabash of Golden Cores he had personally refined into the well, causing the ordinary water well to surge.

The Azure Bull drank the Holy Spring Water daily, allowing it to ascend and reunite with its master in the future.
