Chapter 1044: Queen Mother Fox Immortal

Translator: CKtalon

“Do you think there will be a sixth Demon Blood True Dragon?”

“It can’t be that crazy, right? Even if there are really eight Eight-Trigram True Dragons, who has such good luck to have all eight Demon Blood True Dragons drop?”

“To have five drops is already crazy luck.”

There were still many resourceful people in the Federation’s media. During this period of time, someone had already investigated all the Companion Beasts that had appeared.

The Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau was a rather famous media outlet in the Federation. They had already created a column that specifically introduced these Companion Beasts.

Not only did it introduce the origins of the Golden Battle God Halberd, but it also dug up the origins of the Invisibility Cloak and the story of the Invisibility Cloak.

Only then did people realize that the Invisibility Cloak had returned to its Companion Egg form after hatching. Almost no one could hatch it again.

What was even stranger was that after the Invisibility Cloak was won in an auction, it had actually been stolen. Up to now, no one knew who had the Invisibility Cloak.

The origins of the Demon Blood True Dragon had been dug out by them, causing widespread discussion.

Although they couldn’t see a battle, this didn’t reduce their enjoyment at all. Many people read the reports while waiting.

“Holy sh*t, it’s awesome. There are a total of nine Demon Blood True Dragons, and they are in the terrifying Zhuolu underground sea. What kind of powerful existence can kill the nine Demon Blood True Dragons and have five Companion Beasts drop?”

“I think this was definitely done by a family. It can’t be just one person.”

“According to the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau’s report, the combat strength of these nine Demon Blood True Dragons is extremely terrifying. I haven’t heard of anyone being able to fight them alone.”

“The Golden Battle God Halberd of the West District and the Demon Blood True Dragon of the East District. How powerful are the people who have them?”

“It’s definitely not one person. It must be a family.”

“The six families haven’t indicated that this matter has anything to do with them. I have a feeling that the person who has these Companion Beasts might be a person.”

“Compared to who has these Companion Beasts, I want to know what kind of Companion Beast will appear next. Will it be another Demon Blood True Dragon?”

People were discussing who the person who had these Companion Beasts was. They were divided into two factions that argued incessantly. Most people believed that the entity who had these Companion Beasts was definitely a large family clan.

Even if it wasn’t an existence like the six families, it was definitely a powerhouse.

A portion of them were discussing if the people with these Companion Beasts were from the East or West District. This was because up to now, the Companion Beasts used came from the East and West District.

Amidst the discussions and arguments, two hours passed. Everyone punctually waited in front of the cube or the live broadcast, hoping to see a new Companion Beast appear.

Indeed, at the last second, the Golden Battle God Halberd accepted the challenge again. However, this time, the challenger that appeared on the cube was no longer the Demon Blood True Dragon.

It was an extremely beautiful girl with mesmerizing eyes and long hair. Just a glance at her made one feel like they were in love.

“Medusa... It’s actually Medusa... Furthermore, it’s Medusa in her maiden form...”

“I heard that ever since the Curse Demon Palace was discovered, many experts wanted to have Medusa drop. Some people killed Medusa, but up to now, no one has heard of anyone dropping a Medusa Companion Beast.”

“I knew it. The owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd is definitely from our West District.”

“Maiden Medusa is really beautiful. I really like this Companion Beast.”

“Purchasing her for one hundred million Federation coins!”

“It’s this Medusa that’s cute. She’s too terrifying when she transforms into a demoness.”

“I’m willing to use ten years of my lifespan to exchange for a day with Medusa.”

The videos and pictures of the young Medusa quickly became popular in the entire Federation because she was just so beautiful.

Zhou Wen was still in town playing cards with Wang Lu and company. Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan had already rushed over, but their journey wasn’t that smooth. They encountered many powerful dimensional creatures and had to storm their way to the town.

The few of them had nothing to do in the town, so Zhou Wen took out a table and cards. They played cards in front of the cube, but after a few rounds, they found it boring.

There were clearly four people playing cards, but only Wang Lu won. It was really meaningless.

“You guys have fun. I’ll take a walk nearby. I can increase my combat experience,” Feng Qiuyan said as he stood up.

He wasn’t afraid of losing, but playing cards wasn’t fun for him. He might as well practice his saber.

Li Xuan also brushed off the matter with a laugh. “This card game is really boring. You don’t need to look at the cards to know that you will lose. No matter how good the cards are, you won’t win. I’m not playing anymore.”

Wang Lu said helplessly, “I can’t do anything about that. I can’t control my Life Providence.”

“Is there anything interesting around here?” Li Xuan asked. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Wang Lu thought for a moment and said, “There’s a Fox Immortal Temple nearby. It worships Queen Mother Fox Immortal. I heard that as long as you offer her incense, she can fulfill a wish.”

“For real? Then can I make a wish for a Mythical Companion Beast or a Guardian?” Li Xuan asked.

“Of course... not...” Wang Lu said with a smile,” In fact, there’s only one wish that Queen Mother Fox Immortal can satisfy. That is to temporarily improve your luck. During this period of time, if you kill dimensional creatures, the chances of a Companion Egg dropping will be higher.”

“There’s actually such a good thing? How long can this effect last?” Li Xuan was interested.

“It’s variable. It depends on the person. Some people only enjoy it for a short period of time. It might be about ten minutes or an hour. There are also those who have a longer period of time. Their luck will be better the entire day. However, typically speaking, it will only be effective on the day. After midnight, the luck augmentation will definitely disappear.”

Wang Lu paused for a moment before saying, “Furthermore, it’s only useful to offer incense on the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar. Our luck is pretty good. Today is the fifteenth. We can go there to take a look.”

“Is it far?” Zhou Wen was very interested when he heard that. If the augmentation of Fox Immortal Temple was really useful, his efficiency at grinding Companion Beasts in-game would increase significantly.

“With our speed, we can reach there in twenty minutes at most,” Wang Lu said.

“Then let’s go take a look together.” Zhou Wen looked at the time. There was probably enough time.

Under Wang Lu’s lead, the group quickly arrived at Fox Immortal Temple. It was also a dimensional zone, but it was very small. It was only a tiny temple.
