Chapter 58 The Opportunity to Slay the Blood-Patterned Buddha Heart Lotus

Xu Miantu didn’t dare make the decision as he cast his gaze at Zhou Wen. There was a fervent look of encouragement in it.

Zhou Wen could only smile wryly in secret. Xu Miantu had thought too highly of him. He didn’t have the strength to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus at present. All he could do was slightly shake his head at Xu Miantu.

However, Xu Miantu had full confidence in him. Believing that Zhou Wen was only being humble, he continued encouraging him. “Brother Wen, there’s no need to be overly humble in a place like Sunset College. You have to showcase your absolute strength. This will give you the opportunity to obtain more resources.”

Zhou Wen felt a little depressed. He did wish to slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, but he really wasn’t capable of doing so at present.

Seeing Zhou Wen show a stumped look, Yang Lie sneered and said, “One needs to have the strength to actually showcase it. Otherwise, they will only be a joke.”

After saying that, Yang Lie ignored Xu Miantu and turned to walk to An Jing.

From Yang Lie’s point of view, he would only disgrace himself if he continued embroiling himself with Xu Miantu, Li Xuan, and Zhou Wen.

Although Xu Miantu didn’t wish to let it go, he was helpless when he saw Zhou Wen remain silent. All he could do was watch the supercilious look Yang Lie had while turning around.

Yang Lie came in front of An Jing and said in a very gentlemanly manner, “I lost the bet. If you have anything you need me to do, I’ll definitely give my all. However, I’m curious why you knew that the Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks weren’t the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus’s match? Could it be that you’ve already fought it before?”

“First, I’d said that the bet was completely meaningless. Neither do I have anything I need you to do. I am equally capable of doing what you are capable of. If I can’t do it, it only makes it impossible for you to do it. Second, those who are truly in the know do not need to engage in a fight to know who’s stronger.” An Jing wore a calm look, but every word she said was biting.

Zhou Wen suspected that with her vicious tongue, she might have been beaten up by many if she hadn’t been born into the An family.

Indeed, Yang Lie wore a rather embarrassed look. His face oscillated between blue and white. He was a student who wasn’t even twenty years old, so he wasn’t thick-skinned enough.

“Well said.” Xu Miantu took this opportunity and cheered. This only made Yang Lie glare at him hatefully.

An Jing ignored him and rode her white horse, brushing past Yang Lie’s shoulder. She headed for Zhou Wen.

“Your sister is coming over,” Li Xuan whispered as he nudged Zhou Wen with his elbow.

Zhou Wen shook his head, gesturing to Li Xuan to cut the nonsense. However, before he could say a thing, An Jing had already arrived in front of him.

When Yang Lie and the other students saw An Jing standing in front of Zhou Wen, all of them cast their gazes over, curious as to what she wanted.

An Jing stared into Zhou Wen’s eyes and asked, “Do you have the confidence in slaying the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus?”

“It definitely won’t be a problem. An Jing, let’s work together to slay this blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Brother Wen will definitely not let you down.” Xu Miantu didn’t know the relationship between An Jing and Zhou Wen. Imagining that An Jing was interested in Zhou Wen, he believed that Zhou Wen might be able to sweep her off her feet if he did well.

Furthermore, this beauty’s family was extraordinary. She was the daughter of Luoyang’s An family. She was practically a princess in Luoyang.

“Is that right? Brother Wen?” Xu Miantu nudged Zhou Wen as he winked at him while his back was facing An Jing. His meaning was clear-he wanted Zhou Wen to do a good job.

Although Zhou Wen knew that Xu Miantu had good intentions, he really couldn’t do it. All he wanted was to game in peace and he had no intention of stealing the limelight here. Involving himself with An Jing was the last thing he wished to do.

“You really have wild ideas. If An Jing really wants to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, would you have even have a chance?” Yang Lie already detested Xu Miantu, so he couldn’t help but shoot off a snide remark. He vented all the pent up anger he had thanks to An Jing on Xu Miantu. “A dog is a dog. It only knows how to threaten others thanks to its master. However, you have to at least take a good look. Is that really your master?”

When Yang Lie said that, not only did the expression on Xu Miantu’s face change, even Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were no exception.

Li Xuan coldly said, “Yang Lie, who did you say was the dog? I dare you to say it again.”

Yang Lie sneered and said, “Who in Luoyang City doesn’t know that your patriarch enjoys adopting sons. To put it nicely, it’s an adopted son, but at the core of the matter, it’s just a lapdog reared by your Li family. This is known by all, so what did I say wrong?”

The look in Li Xuan’s chilled. Just as he was about to flare up, he was held back by Xu Miantu. Surprisingly, Xu Miantu wasn’t angry. He grinned at Yang Lie and said, “That’s right. I’m a dog of the Li family. I even feel proud and honored being the Li family’s dog. The Li family is my benefactor and I’ve benefited from them. It’s not like someone who yearns to be the dog of the An family, but they can’t even be bothered to spare him a glance. Something that’s worse than a dog isn’t worth mentioning.”

Xu Miantu’s words hit Yang Lie where it hurt. It was true that the Yang family was trying to cozy up with the An family, but the An family’s attitude was rather vague. It had never truly accepted the Yang family.

Therefore, Yang Lie’s expression changed drastically once he heard that. His face was extremely livid. His eyes stared viciously at Xu Miantu as a look of killing intent flashed through them.

“Does a dog of the Li family only know how to bark? If you’re as impressive as you say you are, slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus; otherwise, quit the barking,” Yang Lie said with a cold look. If they weren’t in public, he would have immediately taken action and slaughtered Xu Miantu.

Xu Miantu was about to snap back when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Then, he heard Zhou Wen whisper, “If you wish to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus, we can do it together.”

“Brother Wen, really?” Xu Miantu was delighted as he hurriedly asked.

Zhou Wen nodded slightly and said seriously, “As long as you aren’t afraid of sacrificing your Companion Beast.”

Xu Miantu had started the conflict because of Zhou Wen and Yang Lie, so naturally, he couldn’t sit idly as Xu Miantu was being ridiculed by Yang Lie. However, his claim of being able to kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus wasn’t just a spur of the moment.

Zhou Wen really couldn’t kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus in-game, but this wasn’t the game. He didn’t need to face it alone and he still had Xu Miantu and Li Xuan to help him.

Zhou Wen had carefully run through the Companion Beasts they possessed. If they controlled them well and no mistakes happened, he believed he could slay the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus based on his understanding of it.

“There’s nothing to be afraid of. Let’s do it,” Xu Miantu turned to say to Yang Lie. “Heard that, Yang? We’ll be slaying it right now. Open your eyes and watch it well. Don’t blame us for not teaching you.”

“I’m looking forward to it,” Yang Lie said with a sneer.

From his point of view, it was fool’s talk that the trio could kill the blood-patterned Buddha Heart Lotus. Even two Silver-Eyed Golden-Feathered Hawks weren’t a match for it, so it would be ridiculous if three freshmen at the Mortal stage could slay it.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
