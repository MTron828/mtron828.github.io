Chapter 1675 Education

Zhou Wen was naturally not an unreliable person. He wasn’t making such a condition to insult Mohe.

In fact, he had already arrived when Sei Gasakai fought Mohe. Back then, Sei Gasakai had already agreed to Mohe’s challenge. It was too late for him to stop it.

Therefore, when Sei Gasakai fought Mohe, Zhou Wen activated the Teacher Domain to observe the extent of Mohe’s abilities.

The Teacher Domain was a Calamity Zone derived from the Dao Sutra. The game’s introduction was the Domain of Education. Its actual use could block the different nomological powers. At the same time, it could study how the other party’s power worked. It could even produce an Essence Energy Art by studying the other party’s nomological power. Zhou Wen originally only wanted to study Mohe’s powers, hoping to figure out what kind of power the reflective power was. However, when Zhou Wen used the Teacher Domain to observe it, he made an unexpected discovery.

This discovery didn’t stem from Mohe, but because of Sei Gasakai.

This was because Sei Gasakai’s Niten Flying Immortal-ryū was inspired by Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal and Immortal Slaying. It could be said to share the same lineage as Zhou Wen’s Sword Dao.

When Sei Gasakai used the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū’s Sword Dao, Zhou Wen discovered some other abilities in the Teacher Domain.

In the Teacher Domain, not only could Zhou Wen clearly sense all the pros and cons of Sei Gasakai’s Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, but the Teacher Domain had even automatically modified the flaws of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, giving Zhou Wen new insights into the Teacher Domain’s abilities.

He could clearly sense that as long as he was willing, he could use the Teacher Domain to make up for the flaws of Sei Gasakai’s Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. He could even directly raise Sei Gasakai’s Sword Dao realm.

So that’s how it is. The so-called Domain of Education is indeed not as simple as imitating and learning. Zhou Wen came to a realization.

Having Sei Gasakai use the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū to fight Mohe in the Teacher Domain was almost equivalent to Zhou Wen fighting Mohe himself. Now, Zhou Wen had already made a judgment on Mohe’s Sword Dao realm. At the same time, he wanted to test the Teacher Domain’s new ability, so he had raised such a condition.

Zhou Wen even vaguely felt that he had found a path of advancement for the Teacher Domain.

Honn Shinsakura looked at Zhou Wen and couldn’t help but feel nervous. The Sword Dao Zhou Wen had imparted was probably extremely profound. Otherwise, it would be difficult for him to defeat Mohe. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He didn’t doubt Zhou Wen’s Sword Dao standards, but he was afraid that he couldn’t master the sword techniques Zhou Wen imparted to him in such a short period of

time.

“There’s no need to be nervous. Just taking it easy while learning it will be enough,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

These words sounded arrogant in the ears of others, but that was the truth. This was because he wanted to use the Teacher Domain to directly raise Honn Shinsakura’s Sword Dao realm and not really let him learn the three strikes.

“I’ll do my best,” Honn Shinsakura said seriously.

“Then watch carefully.” Zhou Wen didn’t say another word. After activating the Teacher Domain, he began brandishing the saber in his hand.

Everyone was drawn to his actions. They wanted to see what peerless sword technique he was teaching to allow Honn Shinsakura to defeat Mohe in such a short period of time.

Even Mohe couldn’t help but focus on Zhou Wen’s sword technique. He also wanted to know how good Zhou Wen’s Sword Dao was.

Mohe didn’t believe that he would lose to Honn Shinsakura. He was already preparing to defeat Zhou Wen after defeating him.

However, Zhou Wen’s next three strikes made everyone widen their eyes.

It wasn’t because the sword technique Zhou Wen taught was profound and powerful, but because the sword technique Zhou Wen taught was too simple. It was so simple that all the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace could understand it.

Even the young Mortal-stage disciples understood the sword technique Zhou Wen had taught.

In fact, it was very difficult for them not to understand it even if they wanted to. This was because the sword technique Zhou Wen had displayed was the most basic sword technique of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. Even a young child of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace had practiced it countless times and was extremely familiar with it.

“Master… What’s going on?” Shiraishi Satomi began to doubt her eyes. She suspected that Zhou Wen had taught something so profound that she couldn’t understand it.

Sei Gasakai was equally puzzled. He also suspected that Zhou Wen’s ordinary three strikes contained some profundity, but he really couldn’t tell what was different between them and the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū basic sword stances he had created.

Mohe knitted his brows tightly. He had focused on studying the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, so he naturally knew the basic sword moves like the back of his hand. However, he couldn’t tell how Zhou Wen could defeat him with these three strikes.

Disregarding how Honn Shinsakura could defeat him with three strikes, even if Zhou Wen were to use them himself, Mohe didn’t believe that they would be of any use.

The others couldn’t sense anything, but Honn Shinsakura felt something completely different.

Under the effects of the Teacher Domain, the ordinary three strikes struck Honn Shinsakura’s brain like three bolts of lightning, enlightening him. His mind exploded with many unprecedented sword experiences.

So the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū I mastered has so many flaws… So this is the profundity of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū… I never expected there to be such a realm…

The three simple strikes in the eyes of others caused Honn Shinsakura to produce the effect of three epiphanies. His cultivation in the Sword Dao had already approached Sei Gasakai, but he suddenly had three epiphanies. His realm in the Sword Dao instantly rose to an unbelievable realm.

How rare was an epiphany? A swordsman who had an epiphany once in his life could become a sword master of a generation.

For example, Sei Gasakai had one epiphany because of Zhou Wen. This resulted in him establishing the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū and gaining the reputation of the Sword Sage

overseas.

Now, Honn Shinsakura had experienced three consecutive enlightenments. It was an unbelievably fortuitous encounter. In a moment, his Sword Dao realm had reached a status that even Sei Gasakai found difficult to reach. At that moment, he was pleasantly surprised. He almost couldn’t believe that he had gained such insights. He looked at Zhou Wen as though he was looking at a god.

If he wasn’t a god, how could he use three simple strikes to give him such insight?

Zhou Wen looked at Honn Shinsakura and was also pleasantly surprised. With Honn Shinsakura’s epiphany and improvement, his Teacher Domain began to improve, evolving from the Human Realm to the Hell level.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that by using the Teacher Domain to educate Honn Shinsakura, Honn Shinsakura’s comprehension of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū should have reached the limits of his comprehension.

However, that wasn’t the case. After Honn Shinsakura experienced three epiphanies, the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū Sword Dao he had comprehended had exceeded the limits of the Teacher Domain.

The Master guides one into the way. Cultivation depends on the individual. The education of the Teacher Domain is no longer limited to one’s bottleneck. The enlightenment of the educated will be reflected in the Teacher Domain if they exceed the Teacher Domain… Zhou Wen had already completely understood the Teacher Domain’s abilities.
