Chapter 1749 Godfiend Spacetime

“No.” Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan took a step back almost at the same time and looked at Li Xuan warily.

Li Xuan retracted his hands in embarrassment before his expression instantly changed. He said indignantly, “I never expected you guys to be such people. I treated you as brothers, but you don’t treat me as a brother. Are you still human? Do you have any conscience?”

“You’re not a bad person when you don’t call us brother. But nothing good comes out of you calling us brother,” Ming Xiu said.

“Am I that kind of person?” Li Xuan said angrily.

“Yes,” Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan answered in unison.

Li Xuan was taken aback as he scratched his nose in embarrassment. “Your misunderstanding of me is too deep…”

“Just get straight to the point. We know what kind of person you are,” Ming Xiu said.

“I’m just thinking that there’s not a single human on the Cube. It doesn’t look pretty. There aren’t many golden apples left. Why don’t you go up and win some glory for us humans?” Li Xuan said.

“I want to, but this isn’t easy,” Ming Xiu said helplessly.

“What’s not easy about it?” Li Xuan asked.

“Firstly, we might not be able to pluck the golden apple since our strength is still lacking. Secondly, the various alien races have sent similar messages to their representatives. We are not allowed to challenge this dimensional zone,” Ming Xiu said.

“You are representatives, not slaves. Must you obey them? I think they just don’t want the dimension’s resources to fall into the hands of us humans. They are extremely sinister,” Li Xuan goaded.

“Of course, other than the contract’s conditions, there aren’t many restrictions on a representative. It’s not impossible to go if we have to, but we can forget about receiving any more resources.” Ming Xiu shrugged.

“There will still be more resources?” Li Xuan was somewhat surprised.

“Of course, they agreed to help us advance to the Heaven level. Otherwise, how can we have any competitive ability?” Ming Xiu thought for a moment and continued, “However, that’s not the main point. I’ve gained a lot of insight recently. Even if I don’t receive their resources, advancing to the Heaven level is only a matter of time. The main reason is that we haven’t reached the Heaven level yet. We might not be able to pass through the Lake of Fog to pluck the golden apple.”

“Is that Lake of Fog really that terrifying? Those alien races seemed quite relaxed.” Li Xuan found it unbelievable.

“It’s not that simple.” It was rare for the taciturn Feng Qiuyan to speak. “The alien races have a better understanding of that place to begin with. The alien races that attempt it have a way to restrain the place, but our understanding of the Lake of Fog is very limited. From the looks of it, the fog should have the ability to disrupt space. The lake water also has some kind of suction force that will suck a Calamity-grade creature to the bottom of the lake. Even if one can resist the suction force of the lake, as time goes by, one will eventually be exhausted. If we can’t crack the fog and reach the island in the middle of the lake before that, we will ultimately die.”

“Even you aren’t confident. From the looks of it, that place is indeed very dangerous. There’s no point in going,” Li Xuan said gloomily. “It’s just depressing watching those alien races strut around.”

“Isn’t that simple? If Coach is willing to take action, that wouldn’t be a problem,” Feng Qiuyan said.

“Let’s go and find him.” Li Xuan could only let Zhou Wen do it. Therefore, he led Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu to find Zhou Wen.

With the help of the Zone Core, Godfiend Era advanced to the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen was studying the Godfiend Era’s Calamity Zone and Mystic Thearch’s powers.

Godfiend Era’s Calamity Zone was called Godfiend Spacetime. It had the characteristics of spacetime and was very useful. It was especially effective when combined with Mystic Thearch’s powers.

In Godfiend Spacetime, Zhou Wen could temporarily use Spacetime Backtracking. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

For example, if Zhou Wen’s body was penetrated by a saber, as long as he used Godfiend Spacetime, his body could return to the state before he was hit.

Of course, this was only an example. In fact, it was much more complicated. Now, Godfiend Spacetime could only backtrack for a short period of time. He couldn’t randomly choose the period of the backtracking. He probably had to advance to Hell or the Heaven level to have greater freedom.

Zhou Wen was mostly done studying Mystic Thearch’s abilities. This gave him a sliver of hope-hope to counterattack the dimension.

Mystic Thearch’s power could actually break through dimensional barriers. This was a power Zhou Wen had never seen before.

Typically, if one was in a dimensional zone, even if they had spatial teleportation abilities, it was impossible for them to teleport out of the dimensional zone. However, Mystic Thearch’s power could directly tear open the dimensional zone to connect to the space outside.

In other words, as long as Mystic Thearch attached herself to Zhou Wen in her soul form, Zhou Wen could ignore the dimensional zone’s seal. Once he encountered danger, he could directly teleport out of the dimensional zone.

Coupled with the Godfiend Spacetime’s Spacetime Backtracking, Zhou Wen’s escape abilities were off the charts. He could head to any dimensional zone he hadn’t dared to go to without any worries.

Based on Zhou Wen’s testing of all the dimensional zones that he had downloaded, he could apparently teleport out.

Of course, this wasn’t what Zhou Wen valued the most. What excited him the most was that Mystic Thearch’s ability should be able to tear through the dimensional barrier, allowing Zhou Wen to enter the dimension freely.

This was only Zhou Wen’s speculation. He didn’t dare go to the dimension. If he encountered an Apocalypse-grade big shot, he might not have a chance of returning.

Now, he was using Godfiend Spacetime and Mystic Thearch’s abilities to explore Chess Mountain, hoping to advance the last Essence Energy Art to the Calamity grade.

“Old Zhou, what are you busy with?” Li Xuan brought Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan to him.

“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen knew that something was up when he saw the three of them come together.

Li Xuan shared his thoughts with Zhou Wen before saying, “It’s a waste not to take things from the dimension. If you have the ability, show your face. That would bring us humans glory, right?”

Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and said, “It’s not difficult to pluck the golden apple, but I reckon the golden apple isn’t the most important thing in that dimensional zone.”

“What do you mean? Doesn’t that place end after plucking the apple?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.

“That seems to be the case on the surface, but if it’s really that simple, why haven’t any of the alien race’s Apocalypse-grade experts appeared? I reckon there’s something hidden inside that we don’t know. Why don’t we let the alien races scout ahead and prevent those alien big shots from being on guard? At the final moment, we might have a chance of succeeding in one strike. Otherwise, if I’m watched by an Apocalypse-grade big shot, I’m afraid it will be difficult for me to have another chance.” Zhou Wen had already considered this problem, so it wasn’t that he didn’t dare go. “You sure are scheming.” Li Xuan said with a smile, “Then let them be smug for a few more days. However, not a single human has been on the rankings. It’s truly depressing.”
