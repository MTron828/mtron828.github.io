Chapter 716: Master

Translator: CKtalon

“Do you know how you lost?” Zhou Wen asked Worm Dugu.

He had no idea what had happened, so he wanted to figure it out.

Worm Dugu ended up misunderstanding Zhou Wen. He said bitterly, “Young Master Wen, you are indeed brilliant. I used the Blood-Sucking Spider, Black Blood Gu, and seven other types of miniature Companion Beasts. Each one was smaller than the last, but none of them escaped your notice. All the Companion Beasts were killed by you. In the end, I had no choice but to use the Magical Hair Gu. I originally thought I could use the Magical Hair Gu to teach you a lesson, but I never expected that I would be the one being taught a lesson.”

“Why did you attack me?” Zhou Wen asked again.

Worm Dugu blushed and stammered, “When I saw your technique at the hospital, I felt that you were more suited to learning my techniques of raising insects and worms, so I wanted to take you to the South District to learn how to raise insects and worms from me.”

“You mean that you want to take me in as your disciple?” Zhou Wen asked Worm Dugu in a daze.

Worm Dugu’s face flushed red. “Young Master Wen, I’m really sorry. I’ve really embarrassed myself. Only today did I realize that there’s always someone better out there. What a joke about you being my disciple; I’m not even qualified to be your disciple. If you wish to kill me, just give the word. I won’t dirty your hands.”

“Did the dimensional creature in Governor Qin’s brain have anything to do with you?” Zhou Wen asked directly.

Worm Dugu immediately said with a serious expression, “Definitely not. Although our Dugu family does need a batch of Essence Gold, we wouldn’t go to such an extent, much less harm Deputy Governor Qin who defends against a dimensional zone.”

“In that case, leave,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

However, Worm Dugu had no intention of leaving. He gritted his teeth and said to Zhou Wen, “Young Master Wen, I’ve raised worms my entire life. This is the first time I’ve suffered such a terrible defeat. I don’t even know how I failed. Can you tell me how you killed the Magical Hair Gu?”

“I don’t know,” Zhou Wen said casually. He really didn’t know how the Magical Hair Gu died. He didn’t even see it. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

On second thought, the chick had been flying around without him knowing why. He could roughly guess that the chick had resolved the miniature Companion Beasts and the Magical Hair Gu. However, it wasn’t appropriate for him to tell Worm Dugu.

“You don’t know how the Magical Hair Gu died?” Worm Dugu naturally didn’t believe such an answer.

“It was dead before I even saw it. How would I know how it died?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he prepared to close the door. He wasn’t in the mood to say anything more to Worm Dugu.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he didn’t wish for Worm Dugu to die in school thus causing a conflict between the Dugu family and Luoyang, he would have taken action.

Although he didn’t plan on taking action now, Zhou Wen had no intention of letting Worm Dugu off the hook. He planned on using the Invisibility Cloak to tail Worm Dugu and see if he had any accomplices before deciding what to do.

Zhou Wen was only making a passing remark, hoping to send Worm Dugu on his way. It also gave him an opportunity to test the effects of the Invisibility Cloak.

However, when Worm Dugu heard that, he was alarmed. “You killed the Magical Hair Gu without seeing it?”

“Yes. If there’s nothing else, leave. Don’t disturb me again,” Zhou Wen said as he closed the door.

To his surprise, Worm Dugu rushed over and held the door open. “Young Master Wen, can you let me see your Companion Beast. A Companion Beast that can easily kill a Magical Hair Gu must be extraordinary...”

Just as he was about to say something, Worm Dugu suddenly saw the chick standing on the table. He immediately widened his eyes in shock.

“What’s wrong with you? Do you really think I don’t dare kill you?” Zhou Wen said with a cold expression. If Worm Dugu continued pestering him, he would have no choice but to attack.

“That... That can’t be...” Worm Dugu didn’t seem to hear Zhou Wen’s reprimand as he stared intently at the chick and stammered,” Could that be the legendary phoenix fledging?”

“You recognize it?” Zhou Wen looked at Worm Dugu in surprise.

The chick had been with him for quite some time, but not many people recognized its origins. Now, the chick looked like a tiny golden eagle. It didn’t look anything like a phoenix.

“I recognize it, of course I recognize it. How can a person who plays with worms and insects not recognize a phoenix? A phoenix is the nemesis of insects and worms. No matter how powerful a Gu worm is, they are powerless against it... No wonder... No wonder...” As Worm Dugu spoke, he tore off its clothes, revealing his dry chest muscles.

“What are you trying to do?” Zhou Wen took two steps back and looked at Worm Dugu in surprise.

However, Worm Dugu turned around, allowing Zhou Wen to see his back. On his back was a huge blood-colored phoenix tattoo. It looked extremely realistic as though it could flap its wings and fly out at any moment.

“You have a phoenix Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen was alarmed.

Worm Dugu said in embarrassment, “How can I have a phoenix Companion Beast? The teacher who taught me how to raise worms tattooed this on me. It’s called the Phoenix-Hooking Evil Painting. This is a rule passed down from my ancestors. It uses a mixture of special avian blood and medicinal herbs for the tattooing. It can be used to ward off insects and evil. It’s to prevent me from being injured when catching insects and raising Gu. In my lineage, there are also ancient books regarding phoenixes. The phoenix fledging described in them is very similar to yours. It’s just slightly different... Young Master Wen... Is this really a phoenix fledgling?”

“I see.” Zhou Wen didn’t answer as he nodded and said, “If there’s nothing else, go back. I won’t let you off so easily the next time I see you.”

However, Worm Dugu didn’t move. He said to Zhou Wen in a fawning manner, “Young Master Wen, do you lack any errand boys? Do you want me to be your assistant?”

“I don’t need an assistant,” Zhou Wen said with a frown.

“That’s right. Men usually find young ladies to be their assistants... Then, what do you think about you becoming my master?” Worm Dugu’s eyes darted around as he suddenly said something unexpected.

“How old are you? Why are you still taking me as your master? I...” Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Worm Dugu had already plopped to the ground.

“Master, please accept a bow from your disciple, Worm Dugu...” Worm Dugu didn’t hesitate at all. He was about to pay his respects to his master by kowtowing.

Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. He had no idea what was happening. Before he could react, Worm Dugu had already finished kowtowing.

“What are you trying to do?” Zhou Wen stared at Worm Dugu and frowned.

Worm Dugu crawled up and said, “From now on, you are my master. Master, when are you going to teach me how to raise a phoenix?”
