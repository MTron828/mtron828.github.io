Chapter 1184: Li Xuan’s Terror Transformation

Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he teleported into the Dream Punishment Chamber, hoping to pull Li Xuan out.

In the past, when he activated Great Brahma, he could do whatever he wanted. Even the punishment ghosts had to obey him, but this time, it was different.

Zhou Wen was repelled by a force, preventing him from rushing into the torture chamber.

“One dream in a thousand years—living an additional thousand years longer than others is a good thing. It’s not something one can even beg for, so I lucked out,” Li Xuan said as he reached out to pick up the tea bowl.

“Li Xuan, don’t be silly. There’s no need to do this. We can think of another solution.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he condensed his strongest Terror power, hoping to rush in to stop Li Xuan.

However, for some reason, this torture chamber was completely different from the previous torture chambers. His Terror powers couldn’t penetrate it at all.

“Old Zhou, don’t be anxious. I’ll be out in a jiffy. If I don’t come out in time, wait for me outside,” Li Xuan said as he drank the bowl of Thousand Year Dream without leaving a single drop.

“Nice tea.” Li Xuan licked his lips. Just as he finished speaking, he collapsed to the ground and fell asleep.

“Let him out.” Great Brahma appeared behind Zhou Wen as he attempted to order the white-haired granny to release Li Xuan.

However, the white-haired granny remained unperturbed. She sat there calmly and looked at Li Xuan who was sleeping on the ground.

An Tianzuo frowned as An Sheng shook his head with a bitter smile. Although one’s body wasn’t injured in the dream of a thousand years of torture, the mental pressure was enough to make any steel-willed human collapse.

An Sheng and An Tianzuo were people with extremely powerful wills, but even they didn’t dare claim that they could definitely withstand the torture.

Although the white-haired granny said that the Thousand Year Dream could be short if one wanted to, they didn’t have much time left in Netherworld City. If Li Xuan didn’t come out in time, even if he could withstand the Thousand Year Dream, his body would be killed by the rules of Netherworld City.

What can I do?

Zhou Wen regretted inviting Li Xuan over.

Zhou Wen tried a few times, but he failed to charge into the Dream Punishment Chamber. He had already used several Terror-grade powers. Since the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Great Brahma were useless, the rest were even more useless.

Zhou Wen looked at the antelope. At this moment, he could only rely on this Calamity-grade fellow.

When the antelope saw Zhou Wen look at it, it immediately turned its head to the side and pretended not to see him.

B*stard. Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless. However, from the antelope’s appearance, he knew that the white-haired granny in the Dream Punishment Chamber definitely had a terrifying background. She was definitely a Calamity-grade existence.

“Come on... Come on... Hehe... All together...” Just as Zhou Wen was feeling worried, he suddenly heard Li Xuan’s voice.

Zhou Wen hurriedly turned his head and realized that Li Xuan wasn’t awake. Instead, he was talking in his sleep. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

However, seeing the wretched smile on his face and the lascivious voice, it didn’t look like he was suffering torture in a dream.

“Harder... Harder...” Li Xuan cried out in pleasure.

Lu Bushun and company stood outside as they stared at the sleep-talking Li Xuan with a strange expression. They questioned what kind of dream he was having. Was it really as the white-haired granny had said—a torture?

What the hell is this fellow dreaming of? Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan and felt that he wasn’t dreaming of torture.

However, it didn’t take long before Li Xuan’s face began to sweat. Not only was he sweating, but he was also heating up. His carapace mask was red as white smoke constantly emitted from his head.

“Didn’t you say that it was just a dream? Why did his body become like this?” Zhou Wen stared at the white-haired granny, prepared to use the Immortal Culling Sword.

“The brain of any creature has its limits. Under normal circumstances, the brain can only think about one thing. However, in the Thousand Year Dream, he’s making time pass too quickly in the dream. Time in reality is too slow, and this results in his brain needing to complete the thought processes that should have taken years, even decades, or centuries in an extremely short period of time. It’s already very rare that his brain didn’t explode,” the white-haired granny said.

“Why didn’t you say so before?” Zhou Wen asked with a sullen expression.

“If you need others to explain everything to you without thinking for yourself, what use is your brain?” the white-haired granny said indifferently.

Li Xuan’s carapace helmet was about to turn into flames. Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t wait any longer. Otherwise, even if he could save Li Xuan, his mind might end up fried.

Just as he was about to draw his sword, he suddenly saw Li Xuan’s carapace flash with a strange light.

With Li Xuan’s head as the starting point, points of light flowed out like a data stream, instantly flowing through Li Xuan, turning his entire body into data points of light.

This power is... Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he found the power somewhat familiar.

Soon, Zhou Wen recalled why it looked familiar. Although this power had Li Xuan’s original attributes, it also had another creature’s attributes.

Alpha! Zhou Wen immediately realized what had happened.

Back then, the Guardian, Alpha, who resembled a nanomachine had possessed Li Xuan. In order to preserve his life, he had contracted Li Xuan in a strange manner.

One of the reasons Li Xuan could advance to the Mythical stage was because of Alpha.

The power that erupted from Li Xuan’s body, other than his Strength stat, was Alpha’s Strength stat. However, the two powers had already fused.

Li Xuan’s body seemed to turn into a data stream. His entire body seemed to be formed by countless glowing points of light, making him look extremely illusory and unreal.

With Zhou Wen’s vision, he could clearly see that Li Xuan’s body couldn’t be called a human body. The cells in his body seemed to have turned into nanomachines.

It was impossible for the human brain to handle so much work in such a short period of time, but now, Li Xuan’s entire being was like a super-brain, rapidly processing all sorts of data streams.

As the digitalization of his body sped up, Zhou Wen also felt the power fluctuations of the Terror grade.

Is he advancing to the Terror grade? Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan in surprise and delight. He didn’t know if Li Xuan could survive the Thousand Year Dream after advancing to the Terror grade.

In the eyes of Lu Bushun and company, Li Xuan, who was glowing, was gradually turning transparent before completely disappearing as though he had turned invisible.

“Terror transformation?” An Jingyu looked in horror at the spot where Li Xuan had vanished and finally couldn’t help but shout.

Currently, there weren’t many humans who could reach the Terror grade. Most of them were humans who had contracted Guardians, and had raised the Guardian to the Terror grade.

Humans who advanced to the Terror grade on their own were very rare, even if they used the Mythical Serum.

Li Xuan was clearly different from the people who had contracted Guardians. His body was undergoing Terror transformation, not simply letting the Guardian undergo Terror transformation.
