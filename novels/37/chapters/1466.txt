Chapter 1467 A Narrow Escape

As he was smashed into the ground, Zhou Wen used the Chaos Egg to protect himself. This was his strongest defense.

Zhou Wen used Spacetime Bandit inside the Chaos Egg and slashed out Immortal Slaying.

Bang!

The Chaos Egg bounced upon hitting the bottom. The power of Immortal Slaying under the effects of Spacetime Bandit was simultaneously released from its previous spot and slashed at the spot where the humanoid monster was standing.

Even the Soul Mirror’s speed couldn’t keep up with the humanoid monster, much less Immortal Slaying’s speed.

The humanoid monster’s body flashed. Not only did he dodge the power of Immortal Slaying, but he also appeared above the Chaos Egg. He clenched his fingers into a fist and punched the Chaos Egg.

Bang!

The Chaos Egg was severely deformed and nearly turned into an awl. It slammed into the ground, blasting open a huge crater. The Chaos Egg didn’t shatter as it bounced back and bounced everywhere in the ancient building.

The Chaos Egg was instantly filled with solid Essence Energy crystals. They inflated the Chaos Egg, pushing it to the brink.

Bang!

Another punch struck the Chaos Egg, causing it to explode. The Essence Energy Crystals inside exploded like stars as Zhou Wen’s body fell out.

Blood spewed out of Zhou Wen’s mouth amidst his horror. Even the Chaos Egg had only managed to block two punches. With his damaged body, he probably couldn’t even withstand a single strike. Even if he wasn’t hit in a vital spot, he would probably die. Sigh of the King… I’ll really die if you don’t come out… From the looks of it, I can only use that move… Zhou Wen had already predicted the location of the humanoid monster’s appearance, but in his present state, he couldn’t even dodge. Even if he barely teleported, he would probably be killed by the humanoid monster the moment he phased into existence. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Instead of dying when the time came, he might as well risk it and use his ultimate move.

The humanoid monster instantly arrived at a speed beyond Zhou Wen’s senses. Zhou Wen stopped looking and summoned all his Companion Beasts.

“Truth Listener… Come out…” Zhou Wen’s will shouted crazily, but Truth Listener in its earring form remained unmoved. It had no intention of coming out.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

In an instant, countless Companion Beasts that stood in front of the humanoid monster were killed.

Thankfully, when Zhou Wen summoned his Companion Beasts, he deliberately placed them like the Golden Battle God Halberd on the front. His main combat pets like Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate were summoned to the side.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare hesitate. He bent his legs and wanted to kneel down to force the silent Sigh of the King out. At this critical moment, he couldn’t care less.

However, the humanoid monster was too fast. Just as Zhou Wen’s knees bent, the humanoid monster’s fist arrived in front of him.

Oh no, it’s too late! Zhou Wen was alarmed. Although Banana Fairy and the other Companion Beasts had already attacked the humanoid monster’s location with all their might, Banana Fairy’s terrifying Chaos Wind and Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World failed to injure him. To the humanoid monster, the Chaos Wind was no different from a breeze in spring. It couldn’t even stop him for an instant.

Just as the blurry fist was about to land on Zhou Wen’s face, it suddenly stopped as though something had blocked it. However, there was nothing in front of Zhou Wen.

That humanoid monster suddenly showed kindness? Or did he suddenly realize that I resemble his long-lost father and can’t bear to attack me? Zhou Wen saw the monster stop there with its fist hanging in front of him without advancing. Many thoughts flashed through his mind.

Ring!

As Zhou Wen thought about it, the attacks of Banana Fairy and the other Companion Beasts landed on the humanoid monster, but they were useless.

However, when a strange chime sounded, the humanoid monster suddenly hugged his head as though he was in extreme pain.

Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he was delighted. He looked up and saw Demonic Neonate holding the Heaven Shrouding Bell in her hand. She was rapidly shaking it. The sound waves that undulated from the Heaven Shrouding Bell spread out like water ripples, forming a strange spatial barrier. No senses could pass through the barrier formed by the Heaven Shrouding Bell.

Banana Fairy, Torch Dragon, Limitless Demon Dragon King, and other attacks constantly struck the humanoid creature, but he didn’t dodge or counterattack. All he did was hug his head with both hands as his body constantly trembled.

However, the attacks were useless against the humanoid monster. Even when the Soul Mirror’s Soul-Extinguishing Light shone on the humanoid monster, it only made him roar as though he was in extreme pain. It didn’t wipe away his soul.

“Neonate, well done!” No matter how stupid Zhou Wen was, he could tell that the power that really affected the humanoid monster was the Heaven Shrouding Bell in Demonic Neonate’s hand.

Demonic Neonate hadn’t used the Heaven Shrouding Bell much since she had obtained it. She had never used it against powerful creatures.

Zhou Wen imagined that the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s power had weakened in her hands. After all, Demonic Neonate’s level was too low. It was normal for the Heaven Shrouding Bell she had absorbed to suffer a loss in level.

He never expected the Heaven Shrouding Bell to be effective at such a critical moment.

“Neonate, continue maintaining it.” Zhou Wen unsummoned his Companion Beasts and only left Soul Mirror and Demonic Neonate out. The Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light was still effective against the humanoid monster.

Zhou Wen retreated towards the ancient city’s exit as Demonic Neonate rang the bell. At the same time, he picked up the Immortal Culling Sword that had flown out of his hand.

Zhou Wen observed the humanoid monster as he retreated. The Heaven Shrouding Bell’s power didn’t injure him, but what puzzled Zhou Wen was that the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s power wasn’t a psyche attack, but from the looks of it, the humanoid monster seemed to be suffering from a psyche attack.

Strange, the Heaven Shrouding Bell is clearly a spatial power. How can it have such an effect? Zhou Wen was puzzled.

The Soul Mirror’s attacks were clearly psychic in nature, but its effects weren’t as good as the Heaven Shrouding Bell.

Although the Heaven Shrouding Bell was indeed effective, it didn’t seem like it could kill the humanoid monster. All Zhou Wen wanted to do now was leave Guide Ancient City and survive.

The humanoid monster kept hugging his head and trembling. In the beginning, he would let out a low roar due to the power of the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. However, behind him, only his body trembled. There was silence.

However, this didn’t mean that his vitality had weakened. On the contrary, the humanoid monster showed no signs of dying. Instead, his vitality increased.

Zhou Wen was about to reach the entrance. Just as he was about to unsummon Demonic Neonate and the Soul Mirror before escaping, he suddenly heard a voice. “Wait, child.” Zhou Wen’s body shook as he realized that the humanoid monster had stopped trembling. He straightened his back and stared at him. The person who spoke was none other than the humanoid monster.
