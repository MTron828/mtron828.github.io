Chapter 200 Thundergod General

“Indeed. I’m just afraid that their passion will be unbearable when the time comes,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“The An family actually didn’t send An Jing. What’s the meaning behind sending an outsider? Are they afraid?” a stern-looking youth in black asked. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“The An family is smart. They didn’t send one of their own out of fear and got an outsider to let us vent our anger.” Another handsome young man with blonde hair wore a look of disdain.

“It looks like apart from An Tianzuo, there aren’t many talents in the An family. They actually found an outsider to enter the Holy Land. I feel sorry for the An family.”

Zhou Wen could tell from the number of youths speaking that he was in trouble this time.

“Young Master Wen, if you don’t wish to participate, it’s still not too late for you to quit. Madam has said that you should act according to the circumstances and don’t force it,” Ah Sheng whispered to Zhou Wen

“Since I’ve agreed to come, I can only take the challenge even if there’s a sea of fire ahead of me. There’s no reason for me to return now.” Although Zhou Wen spoke beautifully, he really didn’t wish to get involved if not for his attempt to see if the special physiques could enhance his physical stats.

Of course, he had to return the favor he owed. No matter what, he had to enter the Holy Land to take a look.

Ignoring the mockery and sarcasm of those people, Zhou Wen’s gaze constantly observed the so-called Holy Land, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol.

The so-called Holy Land was different from what Zhou Wen imagined. It didn’t have any magnificent ancient buildings or immortal-like paradises.

In a desolate desert, there was an ancient and worn-out stone platform. The stone platform was hexagonal and every edge had a stone pillar.

The six stone pillars had different symbols engraved on them. Even the carving techniques and styles were different, as though they were made by six different kinds of craftsmen.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen failed to see any tiny palm symbol despite using Truth Listener to observe his surroundings for quite a while.

“Shut up. This isn’t a wet market. Whoever spouts any more nonsense will be disqualified.” The official coldly stopped everyone and continued, “Before coming here, your family has already informed you of the rules of the Holy Land. However, I still have to repeat them one more time. Everyone who enters the Holy Land does so voluntarily. If any mishaps happen in the Holy Land, it has nothing to do with the organizers of this trial. In other words, even if you die inside, no one will be responsible for it.”

With that said, the official looked at Zhou Wen and continued, “If anyone wishes to quit now, they can immediately make the request to not enter the Holy Land. However, once anyone enters the Holy Land, they need to be responsible for their actions. Good luck to them.”

Everyone knew very well that the official’s words were directed at Zhou Wen. With so many people targeting him, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t have a good time after entering the Holy Land. The chances of death were much higher than the others.

Seeing that Zhou Wen had no intention of backing out, the official continued, “Since no one plans on quitting, this year’s Holy Battle will officially begin. In a while, the Companion Egg Market will begin business. If anyone needs a Companion Egg, you can purchase it. For the next twenty-four hours, you can enter the Holy Land at any time. As for whether you can leave the Holy Land alive, it will depend on your fate.”

After the official spoke, the trading market opened for business. Many merchants had set up stalls. On the stalls were various Companion Eggs. They were basically at the Legendary stage.

Zhou Wen saw a few brands he was familiar with. They were all famous Companion Eggs retailers in the League.

“Young Master Wen, feel free to choose any Companion Egg you need. Madam has already prepared sufficient funds. It should be enough to buy all the Companion Eggs you need. Therefore, you don’t have to worry about money,” said Ah Sheng.

“There’s no need. I’ll just use my Companion Beasts,” Zhou Wen said.

Although the Companion Beasts that a person could obtain were unlimited, having a large number of them would be difficult to command in battle. It would be fine if a Companion Beast had high intelligence, but most Companion Beasts had low intelligence. If they were left to attack on their own, they would be a bunch of disorderly mobsters. They might not be able to use their powers and might even hinder each other.

Therefore, most people focused on training a few Companion Beasts, ones that they could use with the greatest ease.

Zhou Wen was already very adept at using his Companion Beasts. Furthermore, they were considered top-notch existences at the Legendary stage. It was enough.

“Madam was right. Indeed, you aren’t willing to buy Companion Eggs.” As Ah Sheng spoke, he took out a box and handed it to Zhou Wen. At the same time, he solemnly said, “Before I left, I was specifically instructed to hand it to you. Madam said that you can choose not to have any other Companion Egg, but this one was personally obtained by her in a dimensional zone. She said that you have to accept it no matter what. Otherwise, she will make you accompany her for meals daily when you return. Miss Jing will also join the meals.”

“Sis Lan sure is thoughtful.” Zhou Wen didn’t reject the offer and took the box.

He didn’t like the An siblings, but he wasn’t averse to Ouyang Lan. Since Ouyang Lan had said so, Zhou Wen didn’t reject the item.

When he opened it, he saw a black Companion Egg the size of a fist inside. It looked like metal, but it also had the luster of jade.

“What kind of Companion Egg is this?” Zhou Wen looked inside the box, but there was no information card.

“Madam didn’t tell me. She only said that you would know after you hatch it,” Ah Sheng said.

Zhou Wen nodded but didn’t immediately incubate it. He stored it away in his backpack and said to Ah Sheng, “I’ll accept the Companion Egg. I’ll find an opportunity to hatch it in the future. Don’t worry.”

Zhou Wen had a Dao Body and his Primordial Energy recovery speed was extremely fast. He could incubate Legendary Companion Eggs at any time, so he didn’t have to worry about the danger of expending too much of his Primordial Energy.

“Alright, now that your matters have been resolved, and since you aren’t buying Companion Eggs, why don’t you accompany me to take a look. I don’t have as many excellent-grade Companion Eggs as you do. This is a good opportunity for me. Who knows, I might be able to obtain a few.” Li Xuan pulled Zhou Wen towards the market.

Li Xuan’s words weren’t wild fantasy. In fact, as long as he had enough money, he could buy Legendary Companion Beasts that were usually rarely seen.

In order to leave an impression on these young people who could lead a future generation, many of the excellent-grade Companion Eggs were put on sale here.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be astonished when he followed Li Xuan around. He had never heard of many of the Companion Eggs here, but from their introductions, many of them had very useful abilities. They were in no way inferior to the Mutated Demonized General before it underwent a fusion.

The Companion Eggs here were basically at that level. The prices were also astronomical and were at least twice the price of a typical Companion Egg shop.

Even so, many young people who were prepared to enter the Holy Land spent a huge sum of money to buy Companion Eggs. Their expressions remained stoic as though what they were spending wasn’t money.

“Thundergod General... There’s actually a Thundergod General here...” Suddenly, a voice sounded, attracting the attention of many.
