Chapter 1032: Shen Yuchi in a Great Mood

Translator: CKtalon

Shen Yuchi had been in a good mood recently. Although he had suffered heavy losses previously, the bureau was still the eyes and ears of the Federation.

As the anomalies in the Federation intensified, Shen Yuchi made up for a lot of losses using various channels of intelligence.

However, the main reason why Shen Yuchi was in a good mood wasn’t because of this, but because of their recent discovery on the Moon.

Although the Earth’s anomalies were getting more and more serious and it was detrimental to the development of technology, it wasn’t completely without benefits.

The physique of humans had greatly improved. With a powerful Companion Beast, their survivability in space had greatly increased.

Humans with Mythical Companion Beasts equipped with equipment like space suits could do much more in space than before.

However, there were very few people who were willing to develop the space business. Shen Yuchi was one of the more determined ones.

He had always believed that even in this era, technology would one day occupy an important position. In particular, Shen Yuchi had invested a lot in aerospace technology.

Two months ago, humans had landed on the Moon again and made a major discovery.

A dimensional zone was discovered there. Furthermore, a large number of Essence Crystals were discovered in the dimensional zone. Apart from that, they also discovered something very strange. Shen Yuchi felt that this discovery might change the Federation’s present situation.

This was because the moon landing operation was mainly pushed by the bureau. Most of the astronauts on the moon were from the bureau, so Shen Yuchi quickly enforced a news blockade.

This will be the underlying reason for the bureau’s comeback. We mustn’t make any more mistakes.

Shen Yuchi thought through the key details again. After confirming that there were no mistakes, he felt relieved and poured himself a cup of tea.

Just as he picked up the teacup, but before it touched his lips, someone reported, “Director-General... We found... found it...”

These words were unclear, but Shen Yuchi was overjoyed when he heard them. He immediately got up and walked out of the office to the main control room of the moon landing project.

“Director-General Shen, we just received a message from the Moon. We’ve finally found it,” an old professor said excitedly.

Shen Yuchi held back his excitement and said, “Establish comms. I want to see that thing.”

“Yes.” The staff member quickly connected to the communication device on the Moon. Soon, an image of a certain part of the Moon appeared on the big screen.

A few people in space suits were inside a pit on the Moon. In the pit, there were many Essence Crystal ores.

Shen Yuchi’s gaze wasn’t on the Essence Crystal ores at all. Although the reserves of the Essence Crystal ores here weren’t lower than the ones in the bureau, mining and transporting them was a problem. There was no easy solution for the time being.

Even if all of them were dug out, they weren’t something that could be transported back in a short period of time. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In comparison, something in the Essence Crystal ore was the focus of Shen Yuchi’s gaze.

It was a tree root with a tip as thick as a finger. It twisted and extended all the way into the Essence Crystal ore. The roots were as black as ink, but there were no signs of foulness.

It was clearly black like charcoal, but it gave off a holy feeling.

“That’s right. This is it. Dig it out.” Shen Yuchi suppressed the excitement in his heart and gave the order.

“Roger that.” After the astronaut received the order, he summoned a Companion Beast that looked like a rat but was as large as a bull. It continued digging towards the root.

The Companion Beast was at the Mythical stage. Among all the astronauts, it was only one. It was also because of its existence that these discoveries had been made.

Only Mythical Companion Beasts could survive in ordinary space environments and work normally.

Although some Epic creatures could just about survive, it was very difficult for them to work normally.

In the beginning, Shen Yuchi only wanted to know if there had been any changes to the Moon.

If the Moon hadn’t undergone any anomalies, perhaps he could build a base on it to prepare for a large-scale break-out of Earth’s dimensional zones in the future.

If the Federation really couldn’t hold on, there was still a way out.

With humanity’s present physique, as long as they could build a sealed base, it wasn’t impossible to live on the moon.

Of course, many resources still needed to be obtained from Earth. That was only a final form of insurance.

In the beginning, they didn’t discover any anomalies or dimensional zones on the Moon. Later, when they were exploring and taking samples, they discovered an Essence Crystal mine. That wasn’t much to speak off.

While excavating for samples from the Essence Crystal mine, the Mythical Companion Beast dug up something different.

It was a petal. It was white like snow, without any impurities. It was holy like snowflakes.

The petal was like a fossil that was enveloped by the Essence Crystal mine, but it didn’t petrify or wither. It remained bustling with vitality.

Discovering Essence Crystal ores on the Moon and some plants was nothing.

However, when the petal wrapped in the Essence Crystal mine was extracted, something shocking happened.

As they didn’t know what the petal was, they handled it through a Companion Beast in a sealed environment.

The Companion Beast was a Legendary Nature Elf. Although the level of a Nature Elf wasn’t high, its appearance was similar to a human’s. It could do precision work, so there were many similar Companion Beasts in a typical laboratory.

The moment the Nature Elf touched the petal, the petal melted and was absorbed by the Nature Elf. In a few hours, the Nature Elf advanced to the Epic stage.

This discovery shocked everyone.

Shen Yuchi immediately ordered a news blockade and continued digging the Essence Crystal mine.

Indeed, they dug up a few more petals and carried out some experiments. The results of the experiments confirmed that these petals could indeed advance a Companion Beast.

With just one piece, a Companion Beast could easily advance to the Epic stage.

However, as there were too few petals, there was no way to test if the petals could advance an Epic Companion Beast to the Mythical stage.

They did some simple research on this petal and realized that it resembled the petals of an osmanthus, an evergreen tree. However, it was unknown why such petals existed on the Moon.

Shen Yuchi and many people from the East District immediately thought of a legend of the East District. In that legend, there was indeed an osmanthus tree on the moon.

In order to determine if there was really such an osmanthus tree, the Mythical Companion Beast had been diligently digging over the past few days. It had finally found something.

Just a petal is already so magical. Then what about a tree? Just the thought left Shen Yuchi’s heart beating especially fast.
