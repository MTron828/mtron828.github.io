Chapter 1800 Submission or Annihilation

“Wang Mingyuan, how dare you show your face?” A golden-armored general that emitted a sun-like glow rushed out of the Sun God Temple and arrived in front of Wang Mingyuan. He pointed at Wang Mingyuan and said coldly, “The Immortals failed to take your life, but the Inocciduus Divine Mountain shall be your resting place.”

“If you don’t submit to me, this will be the last sunset of Inocciduus Divine Mountain,” Wang Mingyuan said indifferently, ignoring the golden-armored general. Such a tone immediately infuriated the Solarian’s golden-armored divine general. Without another word, he emitted infinite divine light that shone at Wang Mingyuan.

The omnipresent light instantly illuminated the entire world with golden light. The glorious golden light penetrated everything, destroying and burning it.

Even space melted under the illumination of the Solar Divine Light. The golden light seemed to dawn the end of the world.

The terrifying Solar Divine Light shone on Wang Mingyuan’s body, but he had no intention of dodging or resisting it. He just stood motionless in midair.

The golden light landed on Wang Mingyuan’s body like water on a sponge. It fused into his body without causing any ripples.

The golden-armored general was horrified. The Apocalypse-grade Solar Divine Light could burn the heavens and annihilate the earth, but it was unable to injure Wang Mingyuan at all. This was something he had never imagined in the past.

In his shock and anger, the golden-armored general fully unleashed Solar Divine Light. All the beams condensed into an aurora that instantly penetrated Wang Mingyuan’s body like a golden lightning spear.

However, Wang Mingyuan remained floating calmly as he quietly looked at the golden-armored general. The golden beam that penetrated his body was hot enough to melt any immortal existence in the world, but it failed to injure him at all.

It was as though the body was a ghost that didn’t exist in the world. The golden beam couldn’t injure his body at all.

The golden-armored general’s pupils constricted because he felt his Apocalypse powers crazily leak out. In the blink of an eye, most of the solar beams he had condensed vanished.

“Bastard! How dare you!” Several roars sounded from the Sun God Temple as several golden beams shot out. Golden figures soared into the sky.

The four Apocalypse-grade powerhouses of the Solarians appeared and surrounded Wang Mingyuan from different directions. They shot out beams of Solar Divine Light at Wang Mingyuan, hoping to wipe him out.

......

The world seemed to turn into a red-hot furnace. The entire area around Inocciduus Divine Mountain turned into a golden domain of light. It was like an extremely huge golden sun that illuminated the entire dimension.

However, when the Solar Divine Light that was enough to destroy everything stabbed into Wang Mingyuan’s body, it was like a stone sinking into the sea. It didn’t cause any ripples. Instead, a golden glow rose from Wang Mingyuan’s body. It was the power of the Solar Divine Light.

“Impossible… How can this be…” The four bigwigs of the Solarians were horrified. They couldn’t imagine that someone in this world could fight four alone. Not only was he not injured by their Solar Divine Light, but he could also devour its power.

“Submission or annihilation?” There was no joy on his face as Wang Mingyuan asked calmly.

His body was already close to perfection. The abilities of Sword Immortal Nihility, Zhong Ziya, Jiang Yan, and Transcendent Immortal had fused into one, changing Wang Mingyuan’s physique to an unparalleled state. Almost no power in the world could injure him.

The four Solarian bigwigs felt the power in their bodies surge towards Wang Mingyuan like a tidal wave. If they didn’t stop, they would probably be sucked dry in a moment.

A deep sense of shock and helplessness arose in their hearts. Wang Mingyuan’s thin figure was even more unattainable than the majestic Inocciduus Divine Mountain in their eyes.

They simultaneously wanted to retreat, but they realized that their powers were leaking uncontrollably. They couldn’t stop.

“This is your choice. Then be annihilated.” As Wang Mingyuan spoke calmly, the Solar Divine Light on his body expanded like a balloon.

A silent golden glow filled the entire world as though it melted away all sound. It became dead silent.

A moment later, the golden light receded. Wang Mingyuan remained the same as before, as though nothing had happened.

However, Inocciduus Divine Mountain and the Sun God Temple, and all the Solarians, including the four Apocalypse-grade bigwigs, had vanished.

The spot where it was originally located had already turned into a golden scorching hole, like a huge void furnace.

Zhou Wen leaned against the sofa and focused on grinding on his phone.

Chess Mountain dungeon. This was a dungeon that Zhou Wen had downloaded into his phone a long time ago, but he had yet to clear

it.

Now, all he wanted to do was complete the Chess Mountain dungeon before heading to it in reality.

In the past, Chess Mountain was like a land of forbidden existences to Zhou Wen. It was common for him to die thousands of times inside. Every time he entered, he couldn’t avoid death despite all his caution.

Zhou Wen was much more relaxed this time round. He advanced with ease until he arrived at the four Demonized Generals’ territory.

Zhou Wen originally believed that although the four Demonized Generals were powerful, they hadn’t reached the standards of the Apocalypse grade and were only top-notch Calamity-grade creatures. With his present strength, he could still kill them easily.

The outcome left Zhou Wen somewhat surprised. The four Demonized Generals held the Azure Cloud Sword, Chaos Essence Umbrella, Azure Jade Lute, and the Purple-Gold Flower Fox Ferret. The four different powers formed a strange domain that resembled a barrier.

Zhou Wen slashed with all his might, but he failed to crack the strange domain. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This piqued Zhou Wen’s interest. He didn’t use it In the Human World. He just used all sorts of techniques to fight the four Demonized Generals. For a moment, it was difficult to determine who had the upper hand.

The four Demonized Generals are already so powerful. How powerful will Chess Mountain’s final boss be? Who will this boss be? Zhou Wen guessed.

The Nine-Tailed Fox had long appeared. In other words, the mythical Daji couldn’t be the final boss of Chess Mountain.

Of course, King Zhou couldn’t be the final boss because he had long gone to the dimension and seemed to be imprisoned there.

The Thearch? Zhou Wen wasn’t sure because there was nothing related to The Thearch in the phone dungeon.

The powers of the four Demonized Generals were very strange. They each had their characteristics, but Zhou Wen’s strength was unpredictable. In the Human World, he ultimately cracked their defense. After killing one of the Demonized Generals, the remaining three Demonized Generals’ strength immediately decreased drastically as they were easily dispatched by Zhou Wen.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The items dropped by the four Demonized Generals fell to the ground, almost covering the ground.

Zhou Wen saw that there was actually a Companion Egg among them. Just as he was about to pick it up, the entire cave suddenly trembled. The mountain wall beside him split open. It was dark and deep like the gaping mouth of hell.
