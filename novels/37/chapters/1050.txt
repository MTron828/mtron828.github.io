Chapter 1051: Grim Demon’s Appearance

Translator: CKtalon

Unexpectedly, the Invisibility Cloak didn’t admit defeat this time. Instead, the Golden Battle God Halberd admitted defeat and left the battlefield.

People believed that this was a sign of giving up. Presumably, the owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd didn’t wish to continue.

“Is it finally ending? Although I knew that it was meaningless, I don’t know why, but I still have some indescribable anticipation,” someone said in disappointment.

“Perhaps it’s because of our own expectations. In the real world, we have many things we want to do, but due to our own conditions or various reasons, we can’t do it. Sometimes, we will subconsciously hope that someone can do something that we can’t. Even if it’s just watching others succeed, we will be very happy,” his friend said after some thought.

“That’s right. Although we can’t participate in the ranking battle, we still hope that there are real humans who can participate and not those fellows with Guardians.”

Another person said, “There’s actually no difference, right? Aren’t Companion Beasts and Guardians the same external forces?”

“How can it be the same? Companion Beasts are obtained through our own hard work. That’s the power we control. But what about Guardians? Their power ultimately belongs to them. They represent the dimension. Even if they win in the end, it only means that the dimensional race they represent obtained victory, not us humans.”

There were many people who shared the same thoughts as them, but everyone knew that the era of Guardians was coming. This was already an irreversible trend.

The Invisibility Cloak took first place, and a Guardian immediately issued a challenge.

The Invisibility Cloak was a Companion Beast. According to the changed rules, it only had three minutes to accept the challenge.

Three minutes quickly passed. The humans stared at the screen, wondering if the Invisibility Cloak would still choose a Companion Beast as its opponent.

A light flashed on the screen as the Invisibility Cloak accepted the challenge. However, this time, the one challenging the Invisibility Cloak wasn’t a Companion Beast, but a Guardian.

From the looks of it, he has really given up. Everyone sighed inwardly. Although they knew that failure was inevitable, they were unwilling to see this moment arrive.

“Grim Demon is a Guardian I’ve never heard of. I wonder who he belongs to.”

“It looks like only the Guardian went on stage. His human companion didn’t appear alongside him.”

“Does he look down on the Invisibility Cloak that much?”

“That’s true. Although Guardians are also at the Mythical stage, they are clearly much stronger than ordinary Mythical Companion Beasts. Furthermore, the Invisibility Cloak isn’t a Companion Beast with very strong combat strength. I believe this Guardian will still win in the end.”

Everyone suddenly felt dispirited. The Guardian battle that they had been looking forward to was no longer that interesting.

“We’re finally back on track. Let me see how strong the other Guardians are.” A man in Guardian armor smiled when he saw Grim Demon appear.

However, after a while, people suddenly realized something amiss.

After Grim Demon entered the cube’s arena, he floated in the air. He looked very mysterious, mighty, and domineering. However, he only floated there and looked up at the sky at a 45-degree angle without attacking.

“Wait, what’s going on? Look at that Guardian. Doesn’t the way he’s acting look familiar?”

“Don’t tell me he’s here to stall for time like those Companion Beasts?”

“No... Impossible...”

“I don’t think it’s possible either. What’s the point of a Guardian stalling for time? Besides, if there’s a Guardian, why don’t you appear with the Guardian? Why do you need those Companion Beasts?”

“But look, he’s really the same as the Companion Beasts from before. He’s just standing there without moving.”

Instantly, ripples surged once again in the Federation. Everyone was guessing what Grim Demon, the Guardian, was up to. Why was he doing this?

Also, was the owner of Grim Demon and the owner of the Invisibility Cloak the same person, or was he just stalling for time?

“It’s been half an hour, but Grim Demon still hasn’t moved. From the looks of it, there’s no mistake. He’s also stalling for time.”

“Holy sh*t, since he possesses a Guardian, why didn’t he use it earlier? Turns out that this is a fellow who started out with the help of a Guardian.”

“That’s right. If he didn’t have a Guardian, how could he have killed so many Mythical creatures and have so many Companion Beasts drop?”

“Don’t you find it strange? Why didn’t his human companion participate? Instead, the Guardian went up by himself?”

As people discussed, the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau suddenly released an article, “The Contract between Humans and Guardians.”

An interesting idea was proposed in the article. This idea also caused a huge reaction in the Federation.

The article pointed out that up to now, more than forty humans had known to contract Guardians. Some of them didn’t hide their identities and had even become celebrities among humans.

Some were originally unknown youths who ended up becoming famous celebrities in the Federation.

The Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau had also interviewed a portion of them. All humans with Guardians said that their contract with Guardians was absolutely fair. Any party could terminate the contract at any time without any ramifications. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, the reporter from the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau pointed out that although this contract looked absolutely fair, it wasn’t the case.

After humans contracted with Guardians, the growth of humans would stop. As for Guardians, they could continue to become stronger. It looked like a fair contract, but in the end, only the Guardians benefited.

Of course, when humans had the Guardian, they could also use Guardians to do things that were beneficial to them. However, in the end, humans were more like tools.

Grim Demon’s lone appearance in the arena gave the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau’s reporter a sudden thought. Hence, he raised the question of whether there was only one way for a human to contract a Guardian.

Furthermore, he also speculated the possibility of another contract that placed the human in the driver’s seat. Before humans violated the contract, the Guardian couldn’t take the initiative to terminate the contract.

“How is that possible? The difference in strength between humans and Guardians is too great. Even if there’s such a contractual method, Guardians will definitely not be willing to sign something like that.”

“That’s right. Now, humans are in need of Guardians. How can they sign such a contract?”

“It sounds like this contract method is even fairer. The Guardian obtains benefits from humans, so it doesn’t make sense that they can leave whenever they want to.”

“That’s right. Even a divorce requires one to split the family assets. Letting all the benefits be taken away by the Guardian is unfair in itself.”
