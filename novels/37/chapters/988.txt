Chapter 989: Last Chance

Translator: CKtalon

“Absolute Defense is indeed a very powerful ability. Unfortunately, if the Companion Beast that possesses it is at the Terror grade, it can be considered Absolute Defense in the absolute sense of the word. This ability is a waste on the Astral Shell Dragon. Now, that armor can’t even last a minute. Once Absolute Defense completely fails, it will be the end of your life.” Night Thearch’s demonic voice sounded in the darkness again, but his attacks never stopped.

“Perhaps that might spell the end of your life,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“I’m very curious. What gives you the confidence? Apart from the Astral Shell Dragon, what other trump cards do you have? Why don’t you take them all out and let me see what power you can rely on?” Night Thearch was really curious.

From the moment Zhou Wen returned, Night Thearch was already rather interested in him. He didn’t underestimate Zhou Wen. On the contrary, after Zhou Wen really returned, he placed an elevated importance on him.

However, Night Thearch was still curious to know what Zhou Wen’s return was banking on.

Even so, Night Thearch didn’t relinquish the chance of killing Zhou Wen just because of his curiosity. He would still kill Zhou Wen the moment the Shell Dragon armor failed. Therefore, he hoped to see Zhou Wen’s trump card before that.

Clang!

The Shell Dragon armor suffered another attack. This time, the Shell Dragon armor was sliced open by the blade condensed from darkness. It was so deep that even Zhou Wen’s bones could be seen. Blood flowed out of the wound.

“This is your last chance...” As Night Thearch launched another attack, his voice entered Zhou Wen’s ears.

Once the Shell Dragon armor was destroyed, Absolute Defense would be useless. Night Thearch could enter Zhou Wen’s body through the ruptured wound and kill him.

Zhou Wen knew very well that this was indeed his last chance. If he couldn’t withstand this strike, he would probably die here.

In Sea Return City, only Li Xuan, Hui Haifeng, and Ya’er received special treatment from Night Thearch. They could see everything.

Upon seeing Zhou Wen bleed, the three of them became nervous. They wanted to rush over to help, but it was as though they were separated by a strange distance. No matter how they charged towards the battle, they were unable to reach it. It was as though they were stuck in place.

Almost at the instant Night Thearch attacked, Zhou Wen changed his Life Soul and fused the Primordial Human Sovereign Life Soul with himself.

Instantly, Zhou Wen’s body turned into a humanoid sun. The area he illuminated was greater than he imagined. It was even bigger than the Mythical Flaming Sword.

And just inches away from Zhou Wen was where Night Thearch stood. With his fingers on one hand stretched out, he stabbed at Zhou Wen’s wound like a sword. There were cracks in his armor that provided zero defense.

They saw it. They finally saw it. It wasn’t just Zhou Wen. Li Xuan, Hui Haifeng, and company also saw Night Thearch’s true body appear in the light.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen threw the Bronze Sparrow Sword out.

That’s right. It wasn’t a stab, but a throw. This was a Mythical skill, Vajra Drill. It was a skill that sacrificed weapons to unleash the strongest attack.

With the augmentation of Vajra Drill, the power that erupted from this strike was equivalent to the combined strength of Zhou Wen and the Bronze Sparrow Sword. Its speed was unimaginably fast as the Bronze Sparrow Sword stabbed into Night Thearch’s body before immediately exploding. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Boom!

Flames erupted like a sun flare. A Mythical weapon instantly erupted all its energy. The destructive power it produced was unimaginable.

The darkness that enveloped Sea Return City finally vanished as everyone regained their vision. Apart from Li Xuan and a few others, no one knew what had happened.

When their vision recovered, they saw Zhou Wen floating in the air like a sun god and the intense explosion of light.

Has the terrifying Night Thearch been killed? He should be dead. Even Mythical creatures can’t survive such a terrifying explosion. Everyone prayed for this outcome.

However, when the light from the explosion gradually dissipated, they realized that Night Thearch was standing there unharmed. His long black hair was still flowing as before, as though he wasn’t injured at all.

“You’re really impressive. You have more than one Life Soul, and it’s so powerful. You were actually able to reveal my true body in the Night of Terror. Unfortunately, although your strike is extremely powerful, one that would have probably halved the lives of any Mythical creature even if they didn’t die, to a Terror-grade creature, it’s useless no matter how strong it is. Only a Terror-grade power can defeat a Terror-grade. You are still too weak,” Night Thearch said as he walked towards Zhou Wen. He no longer had any curiosity after seeing Zhou Wen’s trump card. He had no regrets killing Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen touched the scabbard in his left hand and condensed the Bronze Sparrow Sword again.

Weapons that were destroyed by Vajra Drill typically vanished. However, because the Bronze Sparrow Sword had the ability to be reborn in the scabbard, it didn’t really vanish. It was also the best weapon to use with Vajra Drill in reality.

Zhou Wen once again threw out the Bronze Sparrow Sword with Vajra Drill. Night Thearch didn’t dodge as he reached out to grab the flying Bronze Sparrow Sword, causing it to explode in his hand.

It was useless. That body was like a divine body that wouldn’t be injured by mortal powers. No matter how terrifying the power unleashed by the Bronze Sparrow Sword was, it couldn’t injure Night Thearch at all.

Zhou Wen threw out the Bronze Sparrow Sword again and again, but it was like setting off fireworks.

Is he a god? The people from Sea Return City were dumbfounded as irresistible terror arose in their hearts. Under such a terrifying explosion, he wasn’t injured at all. He was no different from a god.

Night Thearch was slightly disappointed because the Night of Terror was useless against Zhou Wen. He didn’t activate it again as he destroyed everything with a wave of his hand. He arrived in front of Zhou Wen and didn’t even give him a chance to draw his sword. He struck Zhou Wen’s head with one hand, hoping to completely end his life.

With Absolute Defense completely nullified, it was impossible for Zhou Wen to withstand this strike.

Zhou Wen’s right hand still moved. However, this time, he didn’t pull out the Bronze Sparrow Sword with his right hand, nor did he use Vajra Drill again.

An ice-blue dragon tooth that resembled a sapphire appeared in Zhou Wen’s right hand before disappearing with the use of Darkness Right Hand.

It was so fast that no one saw his actions. When everyone saw what happened, they saw that the ice-blue dragon tooth in Zhou Wen’s hand had already penetrated Night Thearch’s chest.
