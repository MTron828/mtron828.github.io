Chapter 1307: Breaking Out

Translator: CKtalon

The light inside came from the deep depths, but after Truth Listener entered, the light inside rapidly weakened.

Soon, the golden light inside the cocoon dimmed. Instead, the golden light over Truth Listener’s body intensified.

Under Great Brahma’s enhancement, Zhou Wen’s vision could already penetrate the golden light and see what was happening inside.

Zhou Wen saw something in the golden light, but he didn’t see the Guardian he had imagined. All he saw was an eyeball, a golden crystal-like eyeball.

The golden light in the cocoon came from the golden eyeball.

The eyeball itself was so pure that it chilled one’s heart, as though it was the purest, most sanctified object in the world.

When Zhou Wen stared at the eyeball, it moved as though it had sensed Zhou Wen’s gaze. The golden iris in it spun and looked at Zhou Wen.

With just a glance, Zhou Wen felt as though all his clothes had been stripped off. He stood there like a nude model, allowing others to observe and paint. He subconsciously raised his hand to cover his vital spots.

Roar!

Truth Listener roared like thunder as golden light bloomed from its body. It extended its claws and grabbed at the golden eyeball.

However, the light outside the golden eyeball had almost solidified. The closer Truth Listener’s claws were to the eyeball, the slower its progress.

When it was nearly a foot away from the golden eyeball, its claws couldn’t advance any further.

Crack!

The fifth earring on Truth Listener’s ear shattered as its claws continued forward. However, it only advanced about ten centimeters before its speed slowed down again. Finally, it couldn’t move at all.

Truth Listener’s last earring shattered and fell, turning into golden light that scattered.

Zhou Wen saw that Truth Listener’s six-ringed body didn’t continue expanding. Instead, it shrank significantly. The golden fur on its body emitted a resplendent and pure golden light that nearly condensed into something corporeal. It was like a Super Saiyan transformation.

Now, Truth Listener was only half a head taller than Zhou Wen. Its fingernails were like golden crystal daggers that tore through the golden light outside the eyeball and penetrated it.

As the golden eyeball was pierced, the golden light in the cocoon seemed to lose the power it relied on. Truth Listener gently inhaled and the light surged towards his nose like a tumultuous river.

However, this time, Truth Listener didn’t deliberately suck the golden light. It just sniffed the eyeball.

Truth Listener stabbed the eyeball using its middle finger’s nail as it held it in front of its nose and inhaled. It looked like Zhou Wen when he was eating skewers.

Then, Zhou Wen saw Truth Listener open its mouth and suck at the eyeball. After chewing a few times, it swallowed.

Following that, it opened its mouth and crazily sucked the golden light in the cocoon. In the blink of an eye, it had completely sucked the golden light inside dry. The golden light over its body had already reached a peak. The intense golden light prevented Zhou Wen from seeing it.

However, he could vaguely sense his connection with Truth Listener. Truth Listener didn’t completely lose control this time. It still maintained a weak connection.

Crack! Crack! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As the eyeball and the golden light were devoured by Truth Listener, cracks appeared on the stone artifact that contained the stone cocoon.

It wasn’t just the stone artifact. The chains that were connected to the stone artifact, as well as the collars on the four apes’ bodies and the huge turtle shell beneath their feet, began to crack.

Roar!

The four apes roared excitedly in unison as they exerted strength with their eight claws. The stone artifact that was already covered in cracks instantly shattered, and the chains on their bodies broke inch by inch.

The sea and the entire underground space were affected by their powers. The seawater surged and the stone dome shattered. Sunlight shot into the sky as though it had broken the barrier between hell and the human world—sunlight entered hell.

The aura that erupted from the four apes was terrifying and unimaginable. Zhou Wen had never experienced such a terrifying aura.

This power… This power… It’s not at the Calamity grade, right??Amidst the terrifying aura, Zhou Wen’s body involuntarily trembled.

It wasn’t because Zhou Wen was afraid. At the critical moment, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid. This was because fear was useless. His mind raced as he tried to come up with a way to survive.

That trembling was an instinct of life. It was an instinctive reaction when facing an irresistible calamity. It was a physical spasm triggered by powerlessness and despair.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used interstellar teleportation and teleported to Venus.

Due to the loss of the turtle shell and the stone artifact’s suppression, there was no longer a spatial lock. Zhou Wen’s Singularity Universe’s powers played its role, allowing him to arrive above Venus.

However, before Zhou Wen could stand firm, he felt the world spin. He knew that something was amiss as he hurriedly circulated all sorts of powers, hoping to escape his present predicament.

Then, in the next instant, Zhou Wen’s figure appeared in the black-gray ape’s claw. At that moment, the black-gray ape’s aura was as terrifying as a devil king.

Due to its strength, its ape arms became as huge as two metal towers. It was as if it could crush the planet with one swipe of its claws if it wanted.

Taking the sun and moon, shrinking a thousand mountains, switching the positions of stars… This fellow is the Long-Armed Ape Monkey… Could these four apes really be the Four Dimitrios Monkeys??Zhou Wen was alarmed. To be able to pull him back from Venus, and with an ape’s body, Zhou Wen could only think of the Long-Armed Ape Monkey.

The black-gray ape suspected to be the Long-Armed Ape Monkey pinched Zhou Wen’s body between its fingernails. The Prisoned Dragon armor that Zhou Wen was wearing with Absolute Defense cracked and severely deformed under its strength.

Even Zhou Wen’s body was nearly flattened. His chest collapsed as blood spewed out of his mouth.

However, from the looks of it, the Long-Armed Ape Monkey didn’t seem to use much strength. It was just casually pinching Zhou Wen.

“F*ck you,” Zhou Wen cursed as he suddenly unleashed his strength. He pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword and slashed at the black-gray ape’s face.

Clang!

Halfway through the slash, the Immortal Culling Sword froze in midair. The Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s other claw grabbed the Immortal Culling Sword’s blade, preventing it from going any further.

With a flash of light, Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy automatically rushed out of Zhou Wen’s body. Banana Fairy held the banana fan and fanned out Chaos Wind at the Long-Armed Ape Monkey.

The Demonic Sword in Demonic Neonate’s hand vanished as well. It strangely appeared beside the Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s ear and stabbed at its ear hole.

However, the Chaos Wind with the augmentation of the Three Realms’ Best Wind could only make the Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s fur stand up vertically. It didn’t injure it at all, nor did it make it move a step.

Just as the Demonic Sword was about to stab into the ear hole, it suddenly lost control and deviated from its trajectory. It instantly vanished. When it appeared again, it was already in the Long-Armed Ape Monkey’s claws.

The Long-Armed Ape Monkey didn’t seem to care about all of this.. It picked up Zhou Wen’s body in the wind and was about to throw him into its mouth.
