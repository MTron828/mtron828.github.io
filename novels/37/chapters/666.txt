Chapter 667: Battling the Golden Bull

Translator: CKtalon

Leng Zongzheng was sitting on a chair on a skyscraper. He looked at the entire battlefield and his gaze landed on Zhou Wen, who was confronting the golden bull. He asked An Sheng, “Ah Sheng, is that student Zhou Wen?”

“Yes, Chancellor. He’s our Young Master Wen. What do you think of him?” An Sheng said respectfully.

“He’s a slippery one. He actually wanted to pick up freebies on the battlefield. He’s really greedy,” Leng Zongzheng said.

“Young Master Wen only wants to help. He didn’t mean to snatch anything from you,” An Sheng hurriedly explained.

Leng Zongzheng didn’t say anything else. It was impossible to tell if he was angry or not.

Zhou Wen faced the golden bull-headed creature head-on and didn’t dare be careless. This was a battlefield. If he died, that would be it. Therefore, he didn’t charge at the golden bull-headed creature himself. Instead, he got Six-Winged Guardian Dragon to charge forward first.

Six-Winged Guardian Dragon didn’t fear death as it transformed into a black bolt of lightning and charged over. The six dragon wings slashed at the golden bull like blades.

The golden bull was massive, about the same size as a mammoth. It wasn’t at a disadvantage facing the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. When it saw Six-Winged Guardian Dragon charge at it, it roared and lowered its head to slam into it.

Boom!

Due to the terrifying collision, a huge crater formed on the ground. The golden bull and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon were evenly matched and neither of them retreated.

Six-Winged’s front claws grabbed the horns on the golden bull’s head as the two monsters locked themselves in a stalemate.

Golden flames constantly spewed out from the golden bull’s nose. The dragon wings on Six-Winged’s back flapped wildly, but neither was able to gain the upper hand. It looked like their strength was about the same.

Zhou Wen held the Golden Overlord Sword and was about to lop off the golden bull’s head.

To his surprise, the golden bull’s head suddenly shook. A golden bell hanging around its neck rang the moment it shook its head.

Zhou Wen immediately felt his mind go blank when he heard the sound. He was momentarily dazed.

Six-Winged Guardian Dragon looked as though it was drunk. It staggered and involuntarily dispersed all the strength it exerted.

The golden bull roared as a pair of thick and huge golden horns slammed into Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s chest, piercing through its dragon scales and deeply impaling it.

Six-Winged... Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly summoned Six-Winged back.

Although Six-Winged’s combat strength was only considered average among Mythical creatures, its Life Protection was a rare protective Wheel of Destiny. Having it for so long, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to see it die.

Six-Winged transformed into a stream of light and returned to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. As long as it wasn’t dead, it was good. Companion Beasts could slowly recover with their owner’s Essence Energy.

Now, Zhou Wen didn’t have time to think too much. The golden bull was now targeting him. Zhou Wen hurriedly retreated and threw the Golden Overlord Sword in his hand. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The ringing of the golden bull’s bell had actually caused him and Six-Winged to suffer a mental blow, causing them to instantly feel dizzy. If he had been the one charging forward to fight the golden bull, he would probably have been killed.

Before figuring out the meaning of the bell, Zhou Wen didn’t dare approach the golden bull.

Although releasing Torch Dragon or Tyrant Behemoth was likely enough to finish it off, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to expose his two trump cards.

When the golden bull saw Zhou Wen retreat, it immediately charged forward. It looked like it hated Zhou Wen who had ambushed it.

The Golden Overlord Sword slashed at the golden bull autonomously. The golden sword beam was extremely sharp, but the golden bull managed to block the Golden Overlord Sword’s attack with its horns. The beams only left a shallow mark on the horns.

Zhou Wen was somewhat dumbfounded when he saw this. The Golden Overlord Sword was augmented by Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable; yet, it only left a very shallow sword mark on the horns. The toughness of the horns was rather shocking.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The Golden Overlord Sword and the horns constantly clashed. The shockwave produced by the collision shattered everything around them. Even Zhou Wen could only retreat a second time.

The golden bull wanted to catch up to Zhou Wen, but it couldn’t escape the Golden Overlord Sword’s entanglement. Therefore, it shook its neck again, ringing the bell once more.

Zhou Wen was already dozens of meters away from the battlefield. When he heard the bell, his mind jolted as he felt momentary dizziness. Thankfully, the dizziness was short-lived. Zhou Wen reacted and staggered two steps on the ground without falling.

As for a brainless Companion Beast like the Golden Overlord Sword, it actually showed signs of dizziness. Unguarded, it was sent flying by the golden bull’s horn.

The Golden Overlord Sword flew out like a meteor and slammed into the Dragon Gate Grotto’s stone wall. The sword immediately embedded itself into the stone wall.

What the hell is that bell? Does it actually have such a strange power? I used the Gods Retreat, but it was useless. From the looks of it, it isn’t a nomological force. Could it be a pure aural power? As Zhou Wen retreated, he summoned the Golden Overlord Sword back. He saw that there were many cracks on the Golden Overlord Sword’s blade.

Without the Gold Overlord Sword’s entanglement, the golden bull roared as it charged at Zhou Wen like a golden train that had gone amok.

An Sheng wanted to render his assistance, but he was stopped by Leng Zongzheng. “Don’t worry. That punk hasn’t done his best. Let’s wait and see.”

An Sheng also knew that Zhou Wen hadn’t used his full strength. After all, Tyrant Behemoth hadn’t appeared. However, it was best if he didn’t expose Tyrant Behemoth.

With Leng Zongzheng’s extraordinary status, An Sheng couldn’t refute him. All he could do was stand by the side and continue watching.

Must I summon Torch Dragon to deal with it? Zhou Wen rushed out, but he couldn’t think of a way to deal with the bell on its neck.

In terms of combat abilities, the golden bull, Six-Winged, and Golden Overlord Sword were about equal. However, the bell on its neck was too bizarre, preventing Truth Listener and Gods Retreat from showing any effect.

If it’s only an aural power, Truth Listener should have reacted. Why isn’t even Truth Listener reacting? Zhou Wen was depressed.

After some thought, Zhou Wen led the golden bull closer to Dragon Gate Grotto to prevent any further human casualties.

When the golden bull saw that it couldn’t catch up to Zhou Wen, it shook its head again. The bell rang again.

This time, Zhou Wen was already prepared. He charged into the sky and switched to the Godfiend Era Essence Energy Art.

His head spun again, but due to the Godfiend Era’s spatial powers, Zhou Wen remained suspended in midair and didn’t fall.

When the golden bull saw that Zhou Wen didn’t fall, it leaped up and charged at him like a gigantic golden cannonball.
