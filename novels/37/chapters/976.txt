Chapter 977: Absolute Defense

Translator: CKtalon

“What’s wrong?” Miya asked Zhou Wen in puzzlement when she saw Tyrant Behemoth put down the ice dragon tooth and stop digging.

“The Seven Seas Dragon King has gone to see that person. Even if we can leave, only death awaits us. Let’s wait for now.” Zhou Wen didn’t have a good solution. Even if he didn’t wish to eavesdrop, now wasn’t the time to escape.

Sitting on the crystal, Zhou Wen took out his phone to continue gaming and grinding dungeons. He didn’t know how much time he needed to stay here, so since he had nothing to do, he gamed.

Miya knew that Zhou Wen was right. They couldn’t even defeat the Seven Seas Dragon King, much less the more terrifying human, so it was pointless for them to leave.

“Qin Ling was captured by them, right?” Although Miya had already guessed the answer, she still hoped that Zhou Wen could give her a different answer.

“She’s probably captured.” Although Zhou Wen didn’t see the man capture Feng Qiuyan and Qin Ling, he could guess that the man wouldn’t let Qin Ling leave.

Miya was vexed, but there was nothing she could do. She couldn’t even leave to risk her life now.

“When can we leave?” Miya asked, but she was suddenly stunned. She realized that she seemed to be overly reliant on the human in front of her.

In the past, she wouldn’t even spare humans a glance, much less ask such a foolish question.

Zhou Wen looked up at Miya and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll save them.”

Although it was a simple sentence, Miya felt much better after hearing it. It was as though Zhou Wen could really do it.

The Seven Seas Dragon King returned to the underwater abyss, but to Zhou Wen’s dismay, he didn’t head for the underwater palace where the human was. Instead, he entered a cave to rest.

Zhou Wen could only wait patiently. With a minion like the Seven Seas Dragon King available, it was impossible for the human to let the Seven Seas Dragon King sleep in the cave.

Zhou Wen knew that it was useless to burn with anxiety. He grinded dungeons as usual and also farmed some Mortal Companion Eggs for the Evil Spirit King, hoping that he could evolve as soon as possible.

He went to the Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon again, a place where Zhou Wen had often grinded in recent times. He hoped to obtain some inspiration and perhaps have a chance of evolving Sword Pill.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen had personally pulled out the swords and killed them when he visited Ancient Sword Tomb dungeons in recent times. He hadn’t gotten Tyrant Behemoth to take action, or it would have been difficult for him to gain any insight.

The ancient swords were pulled out by the blood-colored avatar and killed. Quite a number of crystals dropped, but nothing new triggered.

Could it be that the advancement of Sword Pill has nothing to do with swords? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but there was nothing he could do. This was the only solution he could think of at the moment.

Zhou Wen came in front of a sword tomb again and pulled out a short sword.

The short sword was red in color and looked like it was made of red bronze. It was exquisite and elegant. The hilt was in the shape of a phoenix’s head, and the guard was a pair of wings. Furthermore, this short sword had a scabbard.

At the instant the short sword was pulled out, terrifying flames erupted from the scabbard. It scalded Zhou Wen so much that he immediately released his grip and hurriedly summoned and wore Galaxy Shell Dragon’s armor.

The short sword filled the sky with flames as it attacked Zhou Wen again. It was clearly a Mythical fire-elemental ancient sword. The power of the flames was rather powerful.

The defense of the Galaxy Shell Dragon armor surprised Zhou Wen. It was able to block the ancient sword’s attack without activating Absolute Defense.

However, the flaming sword aura on the ancient sword heated the armor so much that it was scalding.

After Zhou Wen activated Absolute Defense, he realized that he couldn’t even feel the burning heat of the flaming sword beam. Zhou Wen stood there and allowed the ancient sword to constantly slash at him. At most, it would only send him retreating a few steps with Absolute Defense preventing him from being injured at all.

What powerful defense! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Such armor’s defense was definitely a life-saving weapon. It was much stronger than Dragon Scale Armor. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The strength of Absolute Defense was probably comparable to Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength. However, one was for offense while the other was for defense.

Thankfully, I ambushed and killed the Galaxy Shell Dragon. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been easy to kill it in a head-on battle.

Zhou Wen was secretly delighted.

The duration of Absolute Defense was shorter than Absolute Strength, but it was already very strong. Even top Mythical powers couldn’t injure Zhou Wen when Absolute Defense was activated.

Absolute Strength... Absolute Defense... Could there be something like Absolute Speed... If I can gather an Absolute set, it will be really impressive, Zhou Wen thought greedily.

After testing the strength of the Galaxy Shell Dragon, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to waste time with the ancient sword. He summoned Light Concealment Sword to fight it.

Zhou Wen’s sword techniques were pretty good now, but he couldn’t gain an advantage against the short sword.

As he fought, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that there was no need for him to work so hard. He didn’t need to do it himself. He was a man with Sword Pill.

Sword Pill was similar to flying swords. It could be used hands-free, so there was no need for him to use a sword to slash others.

I wonder if Sword Pill’s strength can withstand a Mythical weapon. Zhou Wen summoned Sword Pill and planned on giving it a try.

With a thought, the resplendent diamond-like Sword Pill appeared in front of Zhou Wen. Then, with Zhou Wen’s will, it stabbed at the short sword.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Sword Pill and the short sword constantly clashed in midair, turning Zhou Wen into a spectator.

It feels so good not having to use a sword to slash at others. It’s no wonder so many people like flying swords. It’s indeed a skill best suited for lazy people. Zhou Wen was somewhat delighted.

It wasn’t because he had found another way to be lazy, but because the strength of Sword Pill could actually clash head-on with a Mythical sword without being damaged.

It’s really good stuff. Zhou Wen used the 3,000 sword intents. Sword Pill already had the concepts of the 3,000 sword intents. Now, with Zhou Wen using the thirteen stances, the might and concepts were much stronger than when Zhou Wen slashed with his sword.

Furthermore, Sword Pill didn’t have any restrictions. It could use the moves far more frequently than when Zhou Wen used them himself. It also had a lot more freedom.

If I can really raise Sword Pill to the Mythical stage one day, will I be like the legendary sword immortals in ancient times, able to behead enemies from thousands of kilometers away? The more Zhou Wen used Sword Pill, the more he found it convenient. He decided to use the short sword as a sparring partner and used all 3,000 sword intents.

Zhou Wen didn’t notice that during the battle between Sword Pill and the short sword, some ancient swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb would tremble gently as though they were responding to the sword intents in Sword Pill.
