Chapter 940: Imprisoning the Ice Maiden

After returning to the ice castle, the ice maiden once again used the Heaven Shrouding Bell. However, after using it, she appeared extremely weak. It looked like she had expended a lot of energy.

Even a Terror-grade expert pays such a heavy cost to use the Heaven Shrouding Bell. I wonder if the Heaven Shrouding Bell is the bell The Thearch wants. Zhou Wen was now certain that he hadn’t successfully teleported to the place The Thearch wanted him to go, but the Heaven Shrouding Bell was almost identical to the bell The Thearch had described. It could be the same bell.

The ice castle came to the volcanic area again. The ice maiden shrank the ice castle to the size of a ring and put it away.

Zhou Wen led the ice maiden to a volcano and said, “This is it. Enter the calabash.”

The ice maiden frowned and said, “It won’t be too late for me to enter after you open the spatial passageway.”

“Although I’m not very smart, I’m not stupid. You could enter the spatial passageway directly once I open it. You would then be leaving me alone behind to await death, so no can do,” Zhou Wen said with a firm shake of his head.

The ice maiden thought for a moment and said, “Alright, give me the calabash.”

The ice maiden was confident that she wouldn’t be trapped by the calabash, so she didn’t insist.

Zhou Wen handed the calabash to the ice maiden, who entered it.

“Alright, I’m about to open a spatial passageway. Wait a moment, and we will be teleporting to Earth,” Zhou Wen said as he picked up the calabash and stuffed it into the Chaos Bead.

The calabash might be broken, but the Chaos Bead was a legendary treasure of a mighty god. The ice maiden probably couldn’t break out of the Chaos Bead so easily.

The ice maiden clearly hadn’t discovered that she had been sent into a special space. Zhou Wen didn’t explain it either. It wouldn’t be too late to release her when she couldn’t wait any longer.

Of course, Zhou Wen’s release meant releasing her from the calabash. Her person would still be in the chaos space to prevent her from destroying the calabash.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was 36 hours yet, so he didn’t dare delay any further. He headed straight for the volcanic pool.

How could he open a spatial passageway? The bronze tripod’s spatial passageway had always been open. It was open for only 36 hours.

Thankfully, when Zhou Wen returned to the blue liquid volcano, the spatial passageway in the pool was still open. Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to enter. He was still somewhat uneasy. If another teleportation malfunction happened, he didn’t know if he could safely return to Deer Terrace Pavilion.

After a long teleportation, Zhou Wen saw that he had returned to the bronze tripod cauldron. The Nine-Tailed Fox was staring at him and he was delighted.

“Did you pass the message I entrusted you?” the Nine-Tailed Fox asked Zhou Wen.

“Although there were some twists and turns, I finally met the Emperor of Shang. I passed him your message,” Zhou Wen said as he returned the pearl to the Nine-Tailed Fox.

“Did he say anything?” the Nine-Tailed Fox asked hesitantly.

“He also got me to pass a message to you, but there’s only one word: wait.” Zhou Wen conveyed the Emperor of Shang’s words to the Nine-Tailed Fox.

The Nine-Tailed Fox was slightly taken aback when it heard that. A complicated human expression appeared on its face. After a long while, it opened its mouth and sucked the pearl in Zhou Wen’s hand back.

“Leave.” The Nine-Tailed Fox had no intention of killing Zhou Wen. It didn’t even suspect the authenticity of Zhou Wen’s message.

Perhaps she had some doubts previously, but after hearing this word, she no longer doubted it. This was because there were some things that only the person in question could say. Others couldn’t imitate it.

The simple word ‘wait’ made the Nine-Tailed Fox understand many things.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay any longer. There were too many horrors in Chess Mountain. Apart from the Nine-Tailed Fox, there were definitely other Terror-grade existences. Zhou Wen suspected that the four demon general statues he had seen were Terror-grade experts that had been sealed.

After leaving, Zhou Wen hurriedly walked out of Deer Terrace Pavilion.

“What are you doing? Have we not reached Earth?” The ice maiden in the calabash couldn’t sense the situation outside, but too much time had passed. She was already suspicious even before Zhou Wen left Deer Terrace Pavilion.

“We’re here. You can come out.” Zhou Wen opened the calabash’s mouth.

However, the ice maiden remained somewhat suspicious. This was because she was a Terror-grade dimensional creature. She would be restricted if she descended to Earth. It was impossible for her to maintain her original Terror grade.

However, she didn’t feel any restrictions on her body, so she didn’t believe that she had already arrived on Earth.

Since Zhou Wen hadn’t imprisoned her, she naturally didn’t need to destroy the calabash to drill out of it.

Just as the ice maiden came out of the calabash, she realized that the calabash beside her had vanished. As for her, she was in a void of chaos. There was an endless chaos space around her. There was no sign of Zhou Wen, nor could she see Earth. This immediately made the ice maiden realize that something was amiss.

“What did you do?” The ice maiden had already transformed into her Terror form. She shot out a terrifying ice beam, hoping to see where this space was.

Her terrifying ice beam shot out without any obstruction, but it failed to reach the end. It was as though the void’s chaos space was infinite, making the ice maiden’s expression turn nasty.

“This is Earth. We’ve already arrived on Earth. However, to prevent you from being injured by Earth’s powers, I’ve temporarily found a place for you to stay. Feel at ease and rest here for the time being,” Zhou Wen said.

“Do you know what you are doing? Do you know what will happen to you if I get out?” the ice maiden said with a cold expression.

Zhou Wen wasn’t angry as he continued, “I’ve been so good to you and even arranged such a nice place for you to stay. Shouldn’t you pay some rent? I think you should just hand the Heaven Shrouding Bell to me as rent.”

“You’re dead.” The ice maiden’s expression was cold as she summoned the ice castle.

The ice castle constantly expanded in the chaos space, returning to its original size. The ice maiden then walked into the ice castle and picked up the Heaven Shrouding Bell.

Zhou Wen wasn’t too nervous. Even if she could really come out of the chaos space, she and the Heaven Shrouding Bell had already arrived at Chess Mountain. Zhou Wen could explain to The Thearch, so she could deal with her herself.

The ice maiden shook the Heaven Shrouding Bell, hoping to teleport out of the mysterious chaos space. However, after shaking it a few times, she realized that the ice castle remained in the chaos space and couldn’t be teleported out. This immediately left the ice maiden alarmed and furious.

She didn’t know what Zhou Wen’s space was. Even the Heaven Shrouding Bell couldn’t break out. Now, she was really trapped inside.

Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw that she couldn’t come out. He continued, “Think about it. Give me the Heaven Shrouding Bell first. If I’m in a good mood, I can consider letting you out.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“In your dreams.” The ice maiden was filled with hatred. She never expected to ultimately fall into Zhou Wen’s hands.
