Chapter 1573: First Showcase of Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens

Translator: CKtalon

After Zhou Wen returned, he recounted the matter to Li Xuan.

“Is there such a dimensional zone nearby?” Li Xuan had recently spent quite a bit of time studying the nearby dimensional zones.

Safety was ultimately a huge problem when it came to constructing a city outside. The city needed to be built inside a dimensional zone, but Li Xuan had inspected many nearby dimensional zones, but none of them satisfied him.

Or rather, he had nothing to choose from. The nearby dimensional zones were strange, making them unsuitable for building a city inside.

“Let’s continue searching. If we really can’t find it, we will have to negotiate with the Xia family. We need a dimensional zone.” Zhou Wen also knew that having so many people living outside wasn’t a long-term solution.

If a Calamity creature were to pass by one day, their city would be doomed. It was impossible for Zhou Wen to guard this place daily.

“Alright, I’ll continue searching. It doesn’t make sense that they can find it, but we can’t,” Li Xuan said gloomily.

After handing the matter of finding the dimensional zone to Li Xuan, Zhou Wen returned and continued studying how to kill the Starlord at the third level.

After returning, Zhou Wen searched for information on the Internet and learned that the third star of the Big Dipper was named Phecda. The Starlord guarding it was named Cherished Kismet.

“You have to repay what you owe. You have to pay for what you damaged. You have to pay for what you kill. I cherish kismet and I’ll make the call on how it should be returned. In this case, how can there be anything unfair in this world?”

This was the core belief of Starlord Cherished Kismet. After Zhou Wen saw this, he roughly knew why Starlord Cherished Kismet had such an ability.

How do I crack Starlord Cherished Kismet’s ability??Zhou Wen kept thinking about this problem.

Zhou Wen tried all the methods he could, but the outcome was the same. As long as he injured Starlord Cherished Kismet, he would be injured. He died if he killed him. There were no exceptions.

Wait!

?Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as his eyes lit up.

He had been thinking about how to kill Starlord Cherished Kismet, but after reading some information on him, Zhou Wen realized that killing him didn’t necessarily require the power that killed.

These words sounded a little awkward, but they seemed to be a viable path.

I have to repay what I owe, damage or kill. Then, what if it’s something I give to him??Zhou Wen wanted to give killing Starlord Cherished Kismet from another angle a shot.

At this moment, Human Sovereign’s strength came in handy. This power couldn’t injure others, but it could treat the opponent.

Zhou Wen wondered what the outcome would be if he used Human Sovereign’s power to deal with Starlord Cherished Kismet.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but take out his phone and open the dungeon before entering the Big Dipper dimensional zone.

Starlord Ravenous Wolf and Starlord Titan Gate hadn’t respawned. They probably wouldn’t respawn until all seven levels were cleared.

Such a serial dungeon is just too troublesome. I can’t even farm a dimensional creature alone.?Zhou Wen entered the Phecda Star Palace without summoning a Companion Beast.

It was useless even if he summoned one. Even someone as powerful as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General would die instantly if he made any killing attempts.

Zhou Wen had previously thought about what would happen if Li Xuan were to kill Starlord Cherished Kismet.

Li Xuan would be beheaded when he slayed Starlord Cherished Kismet. However, being beheaded wasn’t enough to kill Li Xuan. Would this form some cycle??It was rather intriguing.

The green-armored Starlord Cherished Kismet remained sitting there firmly like a meditating Buddha. It was as though he didn’t see the blood-colored avatar.

Zhou Wen engraved the Ancient Sovereign Sutra on the Wheel of Destiny. Human Sovereign’s figure appeared and fused with Zhou Wen’s body.

Zhou Wen was like the sun as he emitted a glorious glow like a miniature humanoid sun.

“This domain’s name really sucks.” Zhou Wen activated Human Sovereign’s Sacrifices to the Heavens domain and muttered to himself.

The moment Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens was activated, large amounts of vitality surged to wherever the light from Zhou Wen’s body shone.

If there were injured people, their wounds would quickly heal in such a powerful vibrant domain. It could even revive people who were on the brink of death.

Even the injuries a Companion Beast suffered could rapidly recover.

Even if there wasn’t any damage, vegetation would rapidly grow. The effects of Human Sovereign’s Sacrifices to the Heavens when used to save people were excellent.

However, Zhou Wen had never thought of using it to kill. This was the first time.

Zhou Wen stared at Starlord Cherished Kismet as the power of Human Sovereign’s Sacrifices to the Heavens shone on him. Starlord Cherished Kismet suddenly opened his eyes.

After the green armor was hit by the light from Zhou Wen’s body, it began turning from green to yellow before turning from yellow to black as though it was rotting.

As for Zhou Wen, he didn’t suffer any injuries. Instead, he felt his vitality grow stronger.

It’s indeed feasible!?Zhou Wen was overjoyed.

As for Starlord Cherished Kismet, he suddenly stood up and charged at Zhou Wen with all his might.

His Speed and Strength weren’t inferior to Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s, but to Zhou Wen, what was terrifying wasn’t his Strength and Speed. In terms of combat, Zhou Wen could barely fight him with his experience and techniques.

Thankfully, Starlord Cherished Kismet’s technique was much weaker than Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s. Starlord Ravenous Wolf was an all-rounder, while Starlord Cherished Kismet was clearly much weaker in this aspect. That allowed Zhou Wen to put up a fight.

Zhou Wen constantly used instant transmission and movement techniques to dodge Starlord Cherished Kismet’s attacks. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Starlord Cherished Kismet was illuminated by the light from Zhou Wen’s body. He was rapidly weakening and losing strength.

Finally, Zhou Wen had the chance to punch Starlord Cherished Kismet’s back. This punch contained intense vitality. If it struck a heavily injured person, the wounds on the heavily injured person would immediately heal.

However, when this punch landed on Starlord Cherished Kismet, his green crystal armor produced a black fist mark. The fist mark quickly turned to dust like burning ashes.

And in Zhou Wen’s body, large amounts of vitality appeared out of thin air, making his Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens domain even stronger.

I never expected that my Ancient Sovereign Sutra would have such a day.?Zhou Wen was very excited as he threw punch after punch at Starlord Cherished Kismet at an even faster speed.

Starlord Cherished Kismet’s body was already very weak, and his speed was much slower. The green crystal armor had basically turned black, and the spots that Zhou Wen’s fist struck immediately turned to dust.

Under Zhou Wen’s onslaught, Starlord Cherished Kismet’s body exploded and turned to dust.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

A few dimensional crystals dropped. Just as Zhou Wen was feeling depressed about not having a Companion Egg drop, he realized that there was a Samsara Stone in the dimensional crystals that dropped.

Another Samsara Stone!?Zhou Wen was delighted.. Ignoring everything else, he decided to pick it up first.
