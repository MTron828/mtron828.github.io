Chapter 1651 Gushing Tears

The suona sounded as the Companion Beast that was charging at the bee suddenly seemed to be shackled. Its movements became abnormally slow.

Furthermore, there seemed to be a downward force that gradually pulled the Companion Beast to the ground.

As the bee played the suona, it easily dodged the Companion Beast’s attacks.

Zhou Wen and company were already very far from the battlefield, but the sound of the suona made their knees sink. Their bodies leaned forward as they had the urge to kneel. “What’s wrong with your faces…” Jiuyang suddenly shouted. Zhou Wen and Xiao didn’t feel anything amiss, but when they looked at each other, they realized that tears had subconsciously fallen from the corner of their eyes and were flowing down their cheeks.

Zhou Wen wiped the tears from his face, but there were still tears seeping out of the corners of his eyes.

“You too,” Xiao glanced at Jiuyang and said in a deep voice.

Jiuyang reached out to wipe his tears. Indeed, he realized that tears had already appeared on his face at some point in time. He couldn’t help but reveal a look of horror.

“It’s the power of that music.” Zhou Wen circulated the Teacher Domain with all his might, hoping to screen the sound coming from the distance, but he couldn’t.

The suona’s sound seemed to ring in his head, causing more and more tears to flow. Jiuyang and Xiao were in an even worse state. They were already covered in tears. What was even more terrifying was that they felt their knees sink deeper and deeper. Their bodies were on the brink of collapse, as though they would kneel at any moment.

Boom!

The Companion Beast on the battlefield fell onto the planet. Its knees were bent as its strength constantly erupted as though it was resisting some invisible force.

The Companion Beast’s face was the same as Zhou Wen and company’s. It was already covered in tears. Its huge eyes were constantly brimming with tears as though it was experiencing extreme sorrow.

“Damn it, we mustn’t kneel or we might die.” Seeing the Companion Beast struggling with all its might not to kneel, Xiao had a bad feeling. He tried his best to stop his knees from bending, but to no avail. His legs couldn’t help but slowly bend.

Zhou Wen and Jiuyang were the same. As they cried, they tried their best to prop their bodies up, preventing themselves from kneeling. Their efforts were less than ideal.

Zhou Wen tried a few methods, but none of them worked. When he saw that the Companion Beast couldn’t escape the magical power of the music, he knew that ordinary powers were useless.

If even the top Calamity Companion Beast couldn’t withstand the sound, it was even harder for them to withstand it.

Seeing his knees approaching the ground, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and summoned the hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites. Then, he used the Golden Harp to control them and made them play the bubble music he had heard by the pool.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was of any use. He just treated it as a last-ditch effort. Perhaps the outcome of doing so would accelerate their kneeling, but at this point, there was no other way. All he could do was give it a try. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After summoning the Musical Note Sprites and Golden Harp, they were surprisingly unaffected by the magical sound, giving Zhou Wen some hope.

Under the control of the Golden Harp, the Musical Note Sprites began playing the bubble music.

It was strange. It was clearly the same music, but the effects of the Musical Note Sprites’ playing were different from the suona.

The sound waves produced by the hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites combined with the suona’s music immediately made Zhou Wen and company’s tears gush out. Their knees suddenly sank, just shy of a foot from the ground.

“Holy sh*t, Zhou Wen, what the f*ck are you doing?” Jiuyang couldn’t help but curse in fright.

Zhou Wen hurriedly got the Musical Note Sprites to stop playing. He had expected this possibility, but he never expected it to be the worst situation.

“Zhou Wen, get your Musical Note Sprites to continue playing that music,” Xiao suddenly said.

Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he immediately thought of something. Xiao also said, “Don’t let their rhythm be the same as the suona. Play it out-of-sync.”

Zhou Wen had already begun doing it. Although he didn’t know if it would be effective or make them kneel faster, the outcome was the same if he didn’t do anything —they would only kneel at a slower pace.

Amidst the Golden Harp’s music, a portion of the hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites produced rhythmic music. The tune was the same as the suona’s tune, but the beat was out-of-sync.

The Musical Note Sprites that filled the sky surrounded Zhou Wen and company as they danced like countless butterflies. The sound waves constantly echoed around them.

Zhou Wen and company were so nervous that their foreheads were covered in sweat. Their tears were still flowing, and Zhou Wen was prepared to order the Musical Note Sprites to stop playing at any moment.

However, after the music sounded, their knees didn’t suddenly sink. Instead, they sank at a much slower speed; their tears also flowed less.

It’s effective! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly ordered all the Musical Note Sprites to perform together.

The sound waves constantly echoed. As the beat was out-of-sync, it produced a very discordant feeling with the suona’s music. Although Zhou Wen and company could still hear the suona’s music and their tears were still flowing, the speed at which the tears flowed had slowed down significantly. The force that made their knees sink had weakened significantly, allowing them to barely withstand the pressure and not continue sinking.

Zhou Wen was in a dilemma. The bubble music combined with the hundreds of thousands of Musical Note Sprites was indeed effective. If he used this power to help the Companion Beast, he might be able to free it from the restrictions of the music. It might even give it the strength to fight.

The problem was that the two Companion Beasts weren’t anything good. One wanted their lives while blowing the trumpet, while the other wanted their lives even without the trumpet being played.

No matter which Zhou Wen helped, the final outcome might not be a good thing.

After some hesitation, Zhou Wen controlled the Golden Harp and tried his best to control the sound waves near them, preventing the Musical Note Sprites’ powers from affecting the Companion Beast.

The Companion Beast would definitely kill them. The bee had only shown animosity towards the Companion Beast and hadn’t targeted them. Zhou Wen decided to place his bet on the bee.

Making such a decision was actually equally risky.

This was because the bee had the treasure-like suona. It was highly likely that it was the parasitic Companion Beast. It could parasitize others and appropriate their nutrients or even their lives. It was impossible for it to be a docile Companion Beast. After it killed another Companion Beast, it was very likely to kill Zhou Wen and company. However, at this point in time, there had to be a choice. The rest was up to fate.

Under the magical sound of the suona, the Companion Beast’s knees approached the ground. Even someone as powerful as it couldn’t withstand the god-like music.

Bang!

One of the Companion Beast’s knees knelt on the ground, producing fractures in the ground that spanned several kilometers.
