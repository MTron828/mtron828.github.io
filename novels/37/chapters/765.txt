Chapter 766: Undying Battle Soul

Translator: CKtalon

“Wei Ge, most people call me Brother.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and shook Xiao Si’s hand.

Xiao Si secretly remembered this name, but he naturally wouldn’t call him “Brother.” He planned on investigating Wei Ge’s background after he returned.

...

In an office of the Imperial Capital Special Inspector Bureau’s headquarters, Wei Ge, who was drinking tea, suddenly sneezed. He rubbed his nose and muttered to himself, “Who’s thinking of me?”

...

“Cut it out. Brother-in-law, didn’t you want to go to the Great Wall? Let’s go.” Wang Chan pulled Zhou Wen towards the stairs at the entrance of the Great Wall.

Zhou Wen had been searching outside the Great Wall for a long time, but he couldn’t find the tiny palm symbol. However, he remained adamant about giving up—he wanted to search while on the Great Wall.

After all, dimensional creatures like Undying Battle Souls had very rare characteristics. Such dimensional creatures might be very useful.

Wang Chan was still somewhat uneasy, afraid that her Goddess of Misfortune would endanger Zhou Wen.

Xiao Si tailed them while constantly wearing a smile on his face. However, he was sneering inwardly. Do you think you’ll really be safe after coming to a place like the Great Wall? How naive.

Zhou Wen hadn’t ascended the Great Wall yesterday and had only searched its exterior. Therefore, he hadn’t seen the Undying Battle Souls. After ascending the Great Wall, he finally knew what kind of existence the Battle Souls were.

On the ancient city wall, soldiers in armor wandered aimlessly as though they had no mind or soul.

Their attire looked ancient. Furthermore, these soldiers were like virtual projections. Their bodies were translucent. When Zhou Wen reached out to grab an Undying Battle Soul’s arm, his palm passed through the Battle Soul’s body as though it was only an illusion and not a real creature.

Zhou Wen condensed his Essence Energy and attempted to attack the Undying Battle Souls but to no avail. All sorts of Essence Energy Skills penetrated the Undying Battle Soul’s bodies, leaving them unaffected.

An Undying Battle Soul wandered over and passed through Zhou Wen and company as it continued wandering forward.

These Undying Battle Souls are quite interesting. They look similar to the Ghost Bride that has a Spirit Body, but they seem a little different. Zhou Wen sized up the Undying Battle Souls with interest.

This was clearly the first time Wang Chan had seen an Undying Battle Soul. She was very curious and reached out to grab it, but it was naturally futile.

“I’ve only heard that Undying Battle Souls were very magical in the past. I’m finally seeing it today.” Wang Chan was very happy. This was because Undying Battle Souls indeed couldn’t harm anyone, so she didn’t have to worry about Zhou Wen being affected by her bad luck.

Xiao Si looked at the Undying Battle Souls, his eyes flashing with a strange, indiscernible look.

Zhou Wen searched for the tiny palm symbol along the way, but Wang Chan treated it as a vacation. However, the scenery of the Great Wall was too monotonous. All there was to see other than the city walls were Undying Battle Souls.

Such a scenery became a little boring after a long time.

As they walked, they suddenly saw black smoke rising in front of them.

Looking in the direction of the rising black smoke, they saw that it was coming out from a beacon tower.

The so-called beacon towers were actually the place where signals were transmitted in ancient times.

In ancient times, there were no modern signaling stations, nor were there any radio or satellites to transmit signals over distances. They could only rely on producing smoke to allow people in the distance to see the signal.

Therefore, there would be a beacon tower built at certain distances on the Great Wall to deliver information quickly.

This was also the main purpose of the Great Wall. Although the Great Wall was tall and majestic, its main purpose wasn’t for war. Apart from the beacon tower’s ability to transmit information, the Great Wall’s main purpose was to block trade and information transmission.

However, in modern times, the Great Wall was basically useless. After the dimensional storms, there were very few humans who could reach the Great Wall, much less ignite the flames of war.

To suddenly have smoke rising from the beacon tower on the Great Wall made Wang Chan’s heart skip a beat as she felt that something was amiss.

Rising smoke from the nearby beacon tower looked like a black tornado rushing into the sky from afar.

What was even stranger was that the soulless Battle Souls seemed to awaken all of a sudden. Their eyes glowed red as they swarmed towards the beacon tower.

“Brother-in-law, something seems amiss. Let’s leave quickly.” Wang Chan pulled Zhou Wen and wanted to leave the Great Wall. She was really afraid that something would happen.

However, when they retreated, they didn’t see any stairs that led them away from the Great Wall.

The Great Wall had already transformed into a dimensional zone. It was impossible to jump off the city wall. Although one could also jump out of the city wall, the dimensional zone’s power would take effect. One would be bound by a mysterious force. The further one was from the Great Wall, the greater the force.

It would be as if one had a powerful spring attached to them. In the end, they would be pulled back to the Great Wall. Only by taking the stairs could one truly leave the Great Wall.

“No... How can it not be here... It was clearly here...” Wang Chan looked left and right, almost crying from anxiety.

“It’s fine. Since we can’t get out, I might as well see what’s on the beacon tower,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards it. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Although Wang Chan was very worried, she had no choice but to follow Zhou Wen to the beacon tower.

Xiao Si said from the side, “I’ve already said that only my Traversing Misfortune Buddha Body can give you peace of mind. No one else can.”

Wang Chan pretended not to hear him as she quickly walked to Zhou Wen’s side.

Soon, the trio came to a nearby beacon tower. They saw a strange container emitting copious amounts of black smoke. The nearby Undying Battle Souls were throwing themselves into the container.

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised to discover that the black smoke was produced by seemingly burning the Undying Battle Souls.

He turned around and looked at the other beacon towers nearby, but he didn’t see any smoke from them. Only this one had smoke rising from it.

He carefully sized up the container. It was a two-handled pot. It was completely black, but it wasn’t made of gold or jade. It looked more like a lacquered container.

There were some mysterious patterns engraved on the pot, but Zhou Wen couldn’t understand them.

As more and more Undying Battle Souls threw themselves into the pot, the patterns on the pot gradually lit up as though there was some evil aura flowing through them.

All the nearby Undying Battle Souls had already thrown themselves into the pot. The black smoke stopped spewing out and the pot shook violently.

Suddenly, something shot out from the pot. When Wang Chan saw what it was, her expression changed.
