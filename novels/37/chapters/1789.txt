Chapter 1790 Telling a Love Story

Although Jing Daoxian wasn’t the type to spout words of wisdom and his words weren’t pleasant, everything he said was very alluring. He even raised the possibility that Chess Mountain might be related to Earth’s Companion Beast.

Towards the end of the conversation, Zhou Wen could only say that he would consider it and didn’t give Jing Daoxian an accurate answer.

Jing Daoxian looked confident as though he was certain that Zhou Wen would cooperate with him. After giving Zhou Wen his contact details, he staggered away.

“Old Zhou, do you think that old fellow, Jing Daoxian, is fooling us? He doesn’t sound reliable no matter how I look at it. Is Chess Mountain really related to Earth’s Companion Beast? Can we determine that Chess Mountain is related to Earth’s Companion Beast just because it’s the watershed in ancient mythology? Isn’t that too far-fetched?” Li Xuan whispered after Jing Daoxian left.

“With his character, if Jing Daoxian dares to take the risk at Chess Mountain, he must have some confidence. He definitely hasn’t been entirely truthful.” Zhou Wen also knew that Jing Daoxian definitely didn’t have any good intentions. Regardless of whether Chess Mountain was related to Earth’s Companion Beast, Jing Daoxian only wanted to use them.

However, Zhou Wen had his own considerations, so he didn’t directly reject Jing Daoxian.

He had to go to Chess Mountain. Even if he didn’t go, The Thearch definitely wouldn’t let him off. If he could pull Jing Daoxian along, it was hard to say who would be cannon fodder.

“No matter how I think about it, this matter doesn’t seem right. Even if what Jing Daoxian said makes sense, that Chess Mountain is a watershed in ancient mythology. It might not have anything to do with Earth’s Companion Beast. Furthermore, Chess Mountain is only a watershed in eastern myths. How do you explain the myths in other regions?” Li Xuan pondered.

“There’s no such thing as a watershed in the myths of the other regions. From the source, the myths of the other regions have always been about the supremacy of the divine. Gods are rulers to begin with. There’s no such thing as a watershed,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

Li Xuan thought about it carefully and realized that it was true. The few Mythical systems in the world were basically theocracies. There was nothing involving humans.

“In short, I don’t think that old fellow is reliable. The things regarding Wang Mingyuan are most likely unreliable,” Li Xuan said.

“We’ll eventually get the answers whether it’s true or not, but I have to make a trip to Chess Mountain.” Zhou Wen told Li Xuan about Chess Mountain, and Li Xuan also understood why Zhou Wen had to go to Chess Mountain.

“There’s actually such a sick creature on Earth. Isn’t it even more terrifying than the dimension’s Apocalypse?” Li Xuan jumped in fright when he heard The Thearch’s omnipotent wish power.

“At the very least, from what I’ve sensed, she’s definitely not weaker than Transcendent Immortal.” Zhou Wen sighed.

“Then why are you going? Aren’t you sending yourself to your death?” Li Xuan shouted.

“She won’t let me off even if I don’t go. I can sense that after the bet, there’s an inexplicable connection between us. I can’t escape.” Zhou Wen smiled bitterly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“That f*cking sucks!” Li Xuan was rendered speechless.

Not long after returning to the ancient city, a message appeared on Zhou Wen’s phone. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw the sender and content of the message. “Little Wenwen, I’m back in Luoyang. Come to Luoyang when you have the time. It’s been a long time since I had a good chat with you.” The sender was Zhou Wen’s father, Zhou Lingfeng

Zhou Wen replied before heading to Luoyang’s An family.

He hadn’t seen Zhou Lingfeng in a long time. He could also take the opportunity to visit Ya’er in Luoyang.

Luoyang in March remained a little chilly. When the wind blew on his face, there was a knife-like coldness.

In front of the An family’s mansion, a man in a white military uniform and a large cloak stood at the door, his face expressionless.

Behind him stood a smiling man, and in front of him was a beautiful girl who looked like a doll.

The girl didn’t say a word when she saw Zhou Wen. She shook off the man’s hand that was holding hers and ran to Zhou Wen. She threw herself into his arms and hugged his neck tightly.

“Ya’er.” Zhou Wen picked up Yaler and gently stroked her head. His originally impetuous mood seemed to calm down significantly.

“Young Master Wen,” An Sheng greeted with a smile.

Before Zhou Wen could answer, he heard An Tianzuo say indifferently, “Uncle Zhou and Mom are waiting for you inside for dinner.” Zhou Wen nodded at An Sheng and carried Ya’er into the An family residence.

Ouyang Lan was the same as before. She didn’t seem to have changed much, but Zhou Lingfeng looked much older than before.

Although he still looked as refined and casual as before, there were many white hairs around his temples.

Ouyang Lan warmly invited Zhou Wen to sit down. An Jing also sat by the side. Their eyes met, but neither of them said a word.

Zhou Wen’s present state of mind was completely different from when he first arrived in Luoyang. He had this meal in comfort.

He no longer cared about the thoughts and views of others. He had his own principles. He treated the kind with kindness, and returned with a fist to those who were malicious. There was no need to blame himself or pity himself.

“Little Wenwen, have a cup of tea with me. It’s been a long time since we sat down for a chat.” After the meal, Zhou Lingfeng called Zhou Wen over and the two of them went to the small garden in the backyard.

A pot of tea and two people. Under the cold moonlight, steam from the tea rose.

Zhou Lingfeng picked up the teacup and took a sip. After putting down the teacup, he suddenly said something Zhou Wen had never expected. “Have you been to Xiyuan Store?”

“How did you know?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

Zhou Lingfeng didn’t answer as he continued, “Have you seen that silver-haired Companion Beast? How does it feel?”

“What feeling?” Zhou Wen felt that Zhou Lingfeng’s question was out of the blue. He didn’t know what he was referring to.

“My Companion Beast isn’t bad, right?” Zhou Lingfeng asked again with a smile.

Pfft!

Zhou Wen spat out the mouthful of tea he had just drunk.

He stared at Zhou Lingfeng with widened eyes and said in disbelief, “What did you say? That silver-haired Companion Beast is your Companion Beast?”

He never expected Zhou Lingfeng to say such words. In fact, he still found it unbelievable despite hearing it with his own ears.

“Why? Is it difficult to accept that I have a Companion Beast?” Zhou Lingfeng said with a faint smile.

“It’s not difficult to accept you having a Companion Beast, but that Companion Beast…” Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss for words.

“He’s indeed different. He can be said to be my Companion Beast, but also not,” Zhou Lingfeng said calmly.

“What’s going on? Isn’t that silver-haired Companion Beast the former principal’s… which is your current father-in-law?” Zhou Wen was filled with puzzlement.

“You’re right. He was indeed separated from me by Father-in-law,” Zhou Lingfeng said with a nod.

“What’s going on?” The more Zhou Wen heard, the more confused he became.

“It’s a long story. I have to tell you a story. It’s a touching love story.” Zhou Lingfeng took a sip of tea as though he was immersed in his memories. He also seemed somewhat nostalgic and smug.
