Chapter 641: Bone Die

The person was wearing armor carved from white bones. On his head was a skull-like mask. His eyes were shimmering with a strange red light as he casually sat on the yellow jade throne. His gaze was sizing up the people on the long street below.

He didn’t look like he was looking at humans, but more like beasts such as pigs or dogs.

He supported his face with one hand and tilted his head to look at them. Meanwhile, the people on the street below were all ghastly pale. Their bodies involuntarily trembled as though something extremely terrifying was about to happen.

“Who is that guy? Why is he so cocky?” Liu Yun whispered.

The person, far away above the stone steps, seemed to have heard Liu Yun’s words. Looking at him from afar, Liu Yun’s scalp immediately went numb and cold sweat broke out on his back.

Fortunately, that person only glanced at him and didn’t pay much attention to him.

Zhou Wen noticed that in front of the person was a bowl made of a skull. Unfortunately, he didn’t know what was inside.

Truth Listener’s ability had been restricted. He couldn’t sense that far away.

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the person extended a hand and took some things from the bowl, clamping them between his fingers.

Only then did Zhou Wen see that they were dice—six of them. Each one was crystalline-like jade, but they looked more like the bones of some creature. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The dice didn’t look too special. Just like ordinary dice, there were numbers from one to six engraved on each of the six sides. The colors were red, like blood.

When the person picked up the dice, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun were alarmed because the stone slab beneath their feet lit up.

However, the stone slabs were extremely bright this time. A blood-colored number actually appeared on it.

The number under Zhou Wen’s feet was 19, and the number under Liu Yun’s feet was 18. Neither of them knew what this number represented.

However, Zhou Wen soon realized what the numbers meant. This was because blood-colored numbers lit up beneath the feet of the people in front of him. Everyone’s numbers were different. From 1 to 33, this meant that there were a total of 33 people on the long street. These numbers were their serial numbers.

Zhou Wen had already figured out what would happen next.

That high and mighty fellow would definitely throw the dice. If the number he threw was the same as the number under someone’s feet, that person would definitely be in for a rough time.

From the reactions of the people in front of him, he knew that they must have experienced the same thing, which was why they appeared to be so afraid.

“I wonder what will happen if the points under our feet match the points he throws out?” Liu Yun also noticed something and swallowed his saliva.

“I don’t know, but I’m certain that nothing good can come out of it.” As Zhou Wen spoke, the person waved his hand and threw the dice out.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that he would throw the dice into the bowl, but to his surprise, the person threw the dice down.

Six dice landed on the stone steps and rolled along.

Amazingly, the six dice grew in size as they rolled. When they landed on the long street, they were more than a meter long.

Six huge rolling dice rumbled down the long street at an extremely fast speed. Wherever they passed, the people in front would dodge to the side, not daring to come into contact with the die. They looked extremely afraid.

“What should we do?” Liu Yun looked at the dice that were rolling. Two of the huge dice were likely to pass through the spot they were standing.

If they wanted to dodge, they needed to move at least three stone slabs.

“Let’s dodge it first.” Zhou Wen didn’t know what the dice were, so he decided to avoid them. He would wait until he figured out the situation when he went further forward.

Six dice rolled past them amidst rumbling, and their step counter was reduced by four steps.

Clang!

The dice rolled all the way to the entrance and slammed into it. Then, they bounced back and landed in the open space inside the door. After rolling for a while, they stopped.

One two, three threes, one six, and one five—a total score of 22.

Zhou Wen and Liu Yun’s eyes immediately looked at the street in front of them. The person with the red number, 22, at his feet was around the middle of the long street. He looked like an extremely muscular middle-aged man. He was tall and mighty, and his muscles looked like steel.

Everyone on the long street looked at him, and his face instantly turned pale. He looked extremely horrified as he shouted crazily, but unfortunately, his voice couldn’t be heard. All they could see was his mouth open, but no one knew what he was shouting.

As he shouted, he ran crazily. However, no matter which stone slab he ran to, the stone slab would light up with the blood-red 22.

Boom!

Without any warning, the middle-aged man’s body exploded like a split watermelon. Blood flowed everywhere.

However, the blood very quickly seeped into the cracks on the stone slabs, leaving not a single drop. It was as though the stone slabbed ground could suck blood.

The man on the throne spread his fingers and the six huge dice flew back into the air, shrinking amidst their flight. By the time they reached his hand, they had returned to their original size.

Holding the dice in his hand, the person looked coldly at the people on the long street. The throne slowly descended and eventually disappeared.

“That bastard. What does he treat us as? His toys?” Liu Yun gritted his teeth.

“From the looks of it, there’s nothing wrong with that.” Zhou Wen stared at the building on the stone steps. There was no longer a throne or man there.

After watching for a while, Zhou Wen said, “That fellow should be the most terrifying dimensional creature in Netherworld City. If we can kill him, we might have a chance of escaping.”

“How do we kill him? The rules of Netherworld City are set by him. We are just chess pieces on the board. How can we play chess with the chess player?” Liu Yun said with a bitter expression.

“That depends on whether he abides by the rules or not. If he abides by the rules, we still have a chance of defeating him even if he’s a chess player,” Zhou Wen said.

“What if he doesn’t follow the rules?” Liu Yun asked.

“Then we will have to think of a way to avoid the rules.” Zhou Wen looked at the person closest to them. There was still a look of horror on the person’s face. From the looks of it, he had been frightened by the scene.

“Let’s go and ask them what’s going on here,” Zhou Wen said as he continued walking forward.

They weren’t too far from that person. After killing a few Epic dimensional creatures, they finally arrived within ten steps of that person.
