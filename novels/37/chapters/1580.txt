Chapter 1581: Nondisputatious Sword Intent

Translator: CKtalon

Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere.

Those who are skilled do not dispute; the disputatious are not skilled in it.

Those who know are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.

The sage does not accumulate for himself. The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself.

With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive.

This was the origin of the Nondisputatious Sword Intent. It was a passage from ancient scriptures.

The skilled didn’t need to strive. Things would naturally fall into their hands because others couldn’t do what they could do. It would only be natural for the things to be given to them.

Jiuyang’s realm also contained this concept. He pursued his own cultivation without being affected by anything else.

Zhou Wen looked at Jiuyang’s realm and gained a deeper understanding of the Nondisputatious Sword Intent.

3000 sword intents are just too many. If I want to figure out the true meaning of all of them, forget a mortal like me with about a hundred years of lifespan, even if I could live for more than a thousand years and figure out one every year, that will only cover a third. Besides, it’s impossible for me to figure

out the true meaning of one sword intent in a year. I’s fine if I just figure out a few things in the fature, but I can’t pursue perfection like Jiuyang. The ancient scripture’s saying is right. Those who know are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. Although my 3,000 sword intents

aren’t weak, Jiuyang’s realm is much higher than any of the 3,000 sword intents, Zhou Wen thought.

As the essence of their realms were too similar, Zhou Wen quickly made a huge breakthrough in the Nondisputatious Sword Intent from referencing Jiuyang.

Til give it a try and see how well I’ve cultivated this sword intent. Zhou Wen’s saber stance changed as he used a concept similar to Jiuyang’s. It was none other than the Nondisputatious Sword Intent that had just experienced a breakthrough.

Jiuyang,Carlos, and Shenluo’s eyes focused at the same time. They could tell that the change in Zhou Wen’s saber aura was very similar to Jiuyang’s boxing concept.

He actually wants to imitate Jiuyang’s technique and concept. Isn’t he a little too idealistic? How can such a realm be mastered in a short period of time? It’s especially so for Jiuyang’s characteristic of pursuing details. It’s not something that can be mastered just from mimicking. He’s aiming high only to

achieve little. Shenluo snorted coldly.

Carlos was also somewhat puzzled. Zhou Wen’s actions seemed a little too rash.

It was true that Zhou Wen was a genius, but Jiuyang was also a genius. Furthermore, he was a top genius. To use Jiuyang’s ultimate skill that he had cultivated for so many years after such a short period of time was a little arrogant.

However, the battle left the two dumbfounded.

‘The saber in Zhou Wen’s hand remained sheathed, but he had already switched from defense to offense. During the battle with Jiuyang, the similarity of their techniques and realms exceeded 90%.

More importantly, Zhou Wen had managed to tie with Jiuyang without being at a disadvantage.

“Could it be that... there’s really such a genius in this world...” Carlos widened his eyes and muttered to himself in disbelief.

“What do you mean?” By the side, Youkai didn’t understand. He could only tell that Zhou Wen wasn’t blindly defending, but his attacks weren’t very powerful. They were very ordinary.

Carlos said with a bitter smile, “Youkai, do you think I’m considered a genius?”

“Of course. If you aren’t a genius, there aren’t any geniuses in the Federation. Although you don’t have the Sovereign Body inherited from your family, your talent and comprehension far exceed those fellows with the Sovereign Body. I still remember the time when you trained in an Essence Energy Skill

John took two months to master. You did it for a short while to be much stronger than him,” said Youkai.

“Then, do you think it’s possible for someone to learn something that will take me one to two decades in just a few minutes?”

“That’s naturally impossible. A human who can do such a thing, no—I shouldn’t say human; it’s impossible for humans to do it. If they can do it, they are not human at all,” said Youkai.

“But that fellow just did it,” said Carlos with another bitter smile.

“Who? What did he do?” Youkai was stunned and asked blankly.

“Jiuyang’s talent isn’t inferior to mine. I believe his cultivation realm was obtained through arduous cultivation. If it were me, I would also need so much time, but in the short twenty to thirty minutes of battle, Zhou Wen actually reached the same realm as him. He’s even on par with Jiuyang,” said Carlos.

“That’s impossible, right? Could it be that Zhou Wen already knew it and is only using it now?” Youkai guessed with a look of disbelief.

Carlos sighed and said, “I hope so too, but it’s obvious that his realm is still improving. He should still be in the midst of comprehension. In the past, I always felt that I was a genius, not inferior to anyone in the Federation. Even An Tianzuo was only a target for me to catch up with in my studies.

However, after meeting Zhou Wen today, I suddenly feel disheartened and even some despair.”

“Don’t think that way. There must be a reason. It’s impossible for there to be such a genius among humans. There must be a problem. We can find the problem. Don’t give up...” Youkai immediately panicked. Carlos was the most promising person in the Cape family now. If he were to be dispirited, it would

undoubtedly be a fatal blow to the Cape family.

“Don’t worry. I’m not a greenhouse flower who hasn’t experienced storms. Even if Zhou Wen is really such a genius, I won’t give up on my goal. I’m just feeling wistful.”

“That’s good.” Youkai heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that there was nothing abnormal about the latter’s expression. However, he was still alarmed.

If it was really as Carlos had said, Zhou Wen was too terrifying.

Shenluo’s surprise was far greater than that of the two. They didn’t know much about Jiuyang, so they were only speculating. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, Shenluo knew a lot about Jiuyang. Among the many Saints in the Sun God Holy Temple, only Jiuyang had obtained the recognition of the Sun God Guardian and obtained the Sun God Holy Temple’s Holy Artifact.

Although everyone was a Saint in name, Jiuyang, who controlled the Sun God Holy Temple’s Holy Artifact, was actually the Sun God Temple’s Holy Son.

Shenluo was in a similar situation. He knew very well how great the price one needed to pay to become the Holy Son who controlled the Holy Artifact.

Jiuyang had been cultivating arduously since he was young. His achievements were the result of years of hard work. Even Shenluo had to admit that he was no match for Jiuyang in terms of the martial arts realm.

It was very difficult to mimic Jiuyang’s realm because it wasn’t as simple as hard work. It also required inhuman talent.

Such a talented and extremely hardworking person had actually been imitated by someone in a short battle. Furthermore, the combat strength he displayed wasn’t inferior to Jiuyang’s. Shenluo found it unbelievable.

This Zhou Wen looks much more terrifying than expected. It’s no wonder Lord Holy God sent me to help Jiuyang. Indeed, Lord Holy God has foresight. I definitely can’t let such a fellow grow stronger. Otherwise, he will be a great enemy of my Holy Land. Killing intent flashed in Shenluo’s eyes..
