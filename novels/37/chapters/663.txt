Chapter 664: Dragon Gate Anomaly

Translator: CKtalon

Crack!

As the Essence Energy was absorbed, the outer shell of the metal walnut split into two along the crack. A white ball-shaped object rolled out and transformed into a stream of light that shot at Zhou Wen’s body, turning into a white, circular tattoo.

When he summoned the Companion Beast, it was about the size of a football. He held it in his hand and pinched it. It was soft and bouncy, similar to the feeling of a bouncy ball. Maybe even softer.

Zhou Wen casually pinched the Companion Beast into various strange shapes. Once he released his grip, it would return to its original state.

This Companion Beast is rather fun. I wonder what use it has? Zhou Wen didn’t receive any information regarding the Companion Beast, so he felt somewhat puzzled.

Typically, after contracting a Companion Beast, one would receive some vague information, such as the name, level, etc.

However, this one didn’t give any of that. Zhou Wen could only take out his phone to read its information. He was still thinking, Such a special Companion Beast must have a very special ability, right? However, it absorbed rather little Essence Energy. Its level shouldn’t be high.

After placing the white Companion Beast in the viewfinder, Zhou Wen clicked on its information and ended up petrified.

Tai Sui: Mortal (Evolvable)

Strength: 11

Speed: 11

Constitution: 11

Essence Energy: 11

Talent Skill: Earth Escape

Companion Form: Mimicry

Holy sh*t, this darn thing is Tai Sui... Zhou Wen regretted it so much that he felt a kick in his guts. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have asked for trouble. He would have let the little beast eat it.

Thankfully, it’s only at the Mortal stage. It doesn’t seem to have any Life Providence or skills like a Jinxes Master or Misfortune. Zhou Wen carefully looked at the introduction and realized that it wasn’t as bad as he imagined.

However, Tai Sui could actually evolve. This was basically the specialty of a Mythical Companion Beast. If he continued evolving it, it was unknown if it would have abilities like a Jinxes Master or Misfortune.

I read online that Tai Sui has a Life Providence like Misfortune and Bad Luck. However, it seems like the photos taken online of those Tai Sui are a little different from this one. Zhou Wen searched the pictures online and compared them to the Tai Sui in front of him. They were indeed different.

Those Tai Suis looked ugly and were either black or yellow. They weren’t as smooth and white as Zhou Wen’s—it looked like white jade.

It’s also possible that my Tai Sui is different from theirs. Mine doesn’t bring misfortune, Zhou Wen thought.

Tai Sui bounced around on the ground like a white bouncy ball. Its fleshy look made it very interesting.

Just as Zhou Wen was looking at Tai Sui, the tiny beast woke up. When it got up and saw the two halves of the metal walnut on the ground, it immediately rushed over.

However, when it realized that there was nothing inside, it was stunned. It turned its head and saw Tai Sui in front of Zhou Wen and immediately pounced over.

Tai Sui seemed a little afraid of it as it immediately jumped behind Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen reached out to grab the fur on the tiny beast’s back and lifted it up. The little beast desperately brandished its tiny claws as though it wanted to fight Zhou Wen to the death.

However, its claws were just too short. No matter how hard it tried, it couldn’t touch Zhou Wen.

“Come, be good. This is for you to eat... You’re not eating it? What about this?” Zhou Wen took out something to coax the little beast.

Finally, when Zhou Wen gave it an Epic Companion Egg, the little beast angrily sprawled on it and ate it. As it chewed, it glared at Zhou Wen and Tai Sui as though it was indignant.

Zhou Wen fed some Companion Eggs to Tai Sui. Tai Sui didn’t seem picky at all, but its eating speed was very slow.

Its body wrapped around the Companion Egg like liquid. It didn’t manage to digest it even after a long time.

After trying out Tai Sui’s Earth Escape skill, he realized that it was very useful. As long as it touched the ground, it could instantly move anywhere.

However, because Tai Sui’s level was too low, it couldn’t escape too far.

As for its companion form, it was somewhat magical. It could simulate the companion form of other Companion Beasts. It could transform into armor, weapons, and other forms. It could even simulate the appearance of a Companion Beast.

However, it only simulated its appearance, its essence didn’t change. It didn’t possess the ability of other Companion Beasts. It looked like a plasticine toy.

Although Tai Sui doesn’t have the legendary Misfortune, it doesn’t seem to be of any use. Realizing that Tai Sui was useless, Zhou Wen let it slowly eat and evolve. He wanted to see if it would be of any use in the future.

“Young Master Wen, are you at school?” An Sheng called.

“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered.

“It’s best you don’t leave the school for the next few days,” An Sheng said.

“What happened?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

“Recently, Dragon Gate Grotto has been a little abnormal. According to Chancellor Leng’s judgment, Dragon Gate Grotto might encounter a large-scale breakout of creatures. When the time comes, we will do our best to prevent the breakout creatures from entering the city. As we don’t know how many breakout creatures will appear, we might need your help as a last resort,” An Sheng said.

“Alright, I’ll stay in school for the next few days.” After a pause, Zhou Wen asked, “Does this mean that the other dimensional zones will also experience a large-scale breakout?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“We are closely monitoring them. From the looks of it, we haven’t discovered anything similar. The situation in Dragon Gate Grotto has changed. Perhaps something special is affecting them,” An Sheng said. “According to Chancellor Leng, some of the break-out creatures outside also came to Dragon Gate Grotto. It’s still a mystery what’s attracting them.”

When Zhou Wen heard that, he immediately thought of the giant golden bird above Dragon Gate Grotto. Back then, it was only when Chancellor Leng personally appeared that the giant golden bird retreated.

Not long after Zhou Wen received the news, Dragon Gate Grotto was sealed off by the military. In the next two days, the school had organized a mobilization meeting. The students had also been assigned some logistic work to assist the military in preventing the large-scale breakout.

The entire school’s atmosphere became abnormally tense. Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and company were assigned work. In such a situation, no one could stay out of it.

That night, a roar that sounded like a cow’s moo came from Dragon Gate Grotto. The sound was soul-stirring. The ground near Dragon Gate Grotto shook as though there was a slight earthquake. The roar lasted the entire night, but nothing came out.

However, this cast a shadow on everyone’s hearts. This was because they were certain that something had really happened to Dragon Gate Grotto.

“Old Zhou, if all of these dimensional zones suffer a breakout, do you think our Luoyang will still hold?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen as he moved the supplies.

“I’m afraid it can’t be defended.” Zhou Wen knew very well that humans were much weaker than dimensional creatures.

There appeared to be a hundred Mythical Companion Beasts on the ranking, but the number of Mythical creatures in the dimensional zones was far more than that. It might be a hundred or a thousand times more.

Zhou Wen even suspected that there were even more terrifying existences above the Mythical stage. Otherwise, Torch Dragon’s stats wouldn’t have the evolvable attribute.
