Chapter 644: Punishment

“If we continue like this, I’m afraid we won’t have enough steps to reach the Netherworld Divine Throne. If we backtrack, the number of steps we take will also decrease,” said Liu Yun.

Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “Even if we start with the first torture chamber, I’m afraid we won’t be able to reach the Netherworld Divine Throne.”

“Why? Will there not be enough steps?” Liu Yun was puzzled.

“I don’t know if the number of steps is enough. However, I do know that in the short span of a day, suffering 239 types of punishments might be nothing to our bodies individually, but can we take a total of 239 punishments? I doubt I can. Among the people I know, I’m afraid only one person can complete this street and survive all the punishments. Unfortunately, he’s not here,” Zhou Wen said.

“Although it’s very difficult, we still have to give it a try. We can’t just sit back and wait for death, right?” Liu Yun said.

“Then give it a try later,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the shop beside him.

“As you wish.” Liu Yun also knew that at this stage, he had to try his best. Otherwise, there was no way out.

“Do you want to go back first?” Liu Yun looked at the path they had taken, but he quickly rejected it. “I’ll first try entering the torture chamber beside me.”

There was still some time before the next hourly bell. The two of them could only stand there and wait.

Zhou Wen took out his phone to take a look, but he still hadn’t finished downloading it. The dungeon map was clearly very big.

Zhou Wen took the opportunity to cultivate Gods Retreat. Every time he summoned it, he would switch it away when it was about to explode. After repeated cultivation, the jade infant’s body became more transparent. Soon, it became as transparent as crystal.

Zhou Wen vaguely felt that the jade infant was about to break through.

I wonder what a Life Soul’s Perfect Body would be like? Zhou Wen placed all his hopes on the jade infant. Gods Retreat wasn’t enough to resist the taboo power here. If it could advance to a Perfect Body, they might still have a chance of survival.

As for entering the punishment chamber to receive punishment, Zhou Wen didn’t pin much hope on it. His physique was already very strong, but he might not be able to withstand so many punishments in such a short period of time. Unless Li Xuan was here, Zhou Wen didn’t even wish to give it a try.

An hour quickly passed. While the jade infant rested, Zhou Wen chatted with Chu He and deliberately asked about his past.

Chu He was already reeling in horror after being trapped here. Being able to chat with others was also a way to relieve stress. He said a lot.

Chu He remembered everything that had happened in the past very clearly. It didn’t look like there was a problem with him, nor was there any memory loss.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The bell rang again. This time, the bell rang eight times. After the bell stopped, the torture chambers that had been closed on both sides of the street opened their doors.

Zhou Wen looked at the torture chamber beside him and saw that there was a strange torture device inside. It looked like a wooden horse, and on its back was a long spike that resembled a unicorn’s horn. However, it wasn’t growing on its head, but on its back.

Beside the torture equipment was a sign with the words “Wooden Horse Punishment Twenty Steps” written on it.

“Eldest Senior Brother, you get twenty steps each punishment. The rewards are very high. Do you want to give it a try?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.

Liu Yun’s face turned green when he saw the torture equipment. He immediately shook his head and said, “No way! I’ll try this instead. Punishment by a thousand cuts. Every slice of meat is one step. More slices, more steps. This is a punishment that can be repeatedly undertaken. Perhaps it’s a better opportunity to get more steps.”

“Can you take it?” Zhou Wen looked at the torture chamber and saw that there was an iron chain hanging on the beam. Beside it was a dagger.

With one look, he roughly understood that one was going to be cuffed by the hands and hoisted up before having the dagger slice off pieces of meat.

“As a man, anything can be done to live. I’ll do it.” Liu Yun knew that if he wanted to live, he had to risk it.

Without any hesitation, Liu Yun followed Chu He’s earlier instructions and shouted at the punishment by a thousand cuts chamber, “I want to undertake punishment by a thousand cuts.”

The moment he finished his sentence, his body vanished as though he had teleported. Zhou Wen looked over and saw that his hands had been cuffed and he was hanging in the torture chamber.

The tiny blade was picked up by a white ghost-like creature before it slashed at Liu Yun’s thigh.

The small blade was like a saw as it sliced back and forth, bit by bit. A piece of flesh fell from Liu Yun’s thigh.

It had to be said that the white ghost’s blade techniques were first-rate. The flesh that was sliced off was as thin as a cicada’s wing and was almost transparent. It was comparable to a top chef.

Zhou Wen roughly understood why the flesh sliced off was so thin. It wasn’t because they were afraid of the victim dying, but because if it was too thick, he wouldn’t have enough flesh to cut a thousand slices. It naturally couldn’t be considered a punishment by a thousand cuts.

It was only one slice, but Liu Yun’s face was pale from the pain. Not much flesh had been sliced off, but the wound was nothing in comparison to the pain.

Liu Yun gritted his teeth and didn’t say a word. The small blade continued to slice off another piece of flesh.

When Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun again, his forehead was breaking out in cold sweat.

Chu He’s heart trembled as he watched from the side. Such a bloody and cruel punishment made one’s hair stand on end.

Liu Yun didn’t even grunt as the blade sliced through his flesh. He was like a classic example of a true man. Even Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be impressed. Liu Yun was truly unyielding.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Liu Yun’s wounds didn’t bleed much. Every time the tiny blade sliced off a piece of flesh, the wound would automatically contract without much bleeding.

“Eldest Senior Brother, I couldn’t tell. You’ve also practiced such a powerful self-recovery technique,” Zhou Wen exclaimed.

“Self-recovery my ass. It’s the power of the torture chamber that prevents me from bleeding. It’s afraid I’ll die before I complete the thousand cuts,” cursed Liu Yun. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He wasn’t really such a hot-tempered person. All he wanted to do was to vent his pain through his cursing.

After 23 slices, the unyielding Liu Yun finally couldn’t hold it in any longer. He shouted, “I give up on continuing the torture.”

With a clang, the metal cuff released and Liu Yun’s body fell. However, when he landed, he returned to the stone slab he was on before the punishment.

Indeed, the number on his stone slab increased by 23.

“See, isn’t it simple? I got it to increase by 23 in no time at all. Try a few more torture chambers, and it won’t be a problem for us to reach the Netherworld Divine Throne,” Liu Yun said with a pale face.

Ignoring Zhou Wen, even Chu He could tell that Liu Yun was merely comforting himself.
