Chapter 825: Lady of the Stars

Is there any Guardian related to the stars or the universe? Zhou Wen sat on the sofa and muttered to himself. It was too difficult to find a suitable Guardian. The key problem was that Zhou Wen didn’t know where the Guardians were.

Zhou Wen had the urge to take the chick back to the phoenix’s nest to discuss with the phoenix. He wanted to see if he could obtain a drop of blood essence from the cocoon protected by the phoenix.

Just as he was considering it, the antelope walked over and stood opposite Zhou Wen, writing on the ground with its hooves.

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. The antelope usually ignored him, so he wasn’t sure why it had suddenly come over. He hurriedly looked at the ground.

“You want to find a Guardian related to the stars?” The antelope wrote on the ground.

“So what if I do? Do you know where to find one?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Didn’t you already see it before? Why are you asking where it is?” the antelope continued writing.

“When did I see it?” Zhou Wen frowned. He couldn’t remember when he had seen such a Guardian.

“Not only have you seen it, but you have also carried it.” The antelope looked at Zhou Wen in a teasing manner and continued writing.

“When did I carry... it...” Zhou Wen suddenly reacted as he widened his eyes and asked the antelope, “Are you saying that there’s a Guardian inside the log?”

The antelope smiled at Zhou Wen and wrote: “That’s a Guardian with the Life Providence of the Lady of the Stars. She’s also a top existence among Guardians. You originally had the chance to contract her, but unfortunately, you screwed up. Not only did you fail to contract her, but you even became an enemy. Do you regret it now?”

“Why didn’t you say so earlier? How would I know?” Zhou Wen said helplessly.

“How do I tell you? You had to keep carrying that log. Did you want me to tell you in front of her that you have to lie to her and think of a way to cheat her?” The antelope curled its lips.

“You could have told me in advance.” Zhou Wen paused before continuing, “Let’s not talk about this first. Do you have a way to help me obtain a drop of her blood essence?”

“Why do you want her blood essence?” The antelope looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I’m cultivating an Essence Energy Art, but I don’t have a special physique that matches it. I need a drop of Guardian’s blood with the same stats as a foundation,” Zhou Wen said.

“What Essence Energy Art is it?” the antelope asked.

“Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.” Zhou Wen had no intention of hiding it. Having followed him for so long, the antelope naturally knew that he knew many Essence Energy Arts. There was nothing to hide.

“So it’s the Sky-Stealing technique. It’s possible to use her blood essence as a foundation...” When the antelope said that, it pondered for a moment before continuing, “Now that she has returned to Forbidden City, Forbidden City has experienced a recovery in Essence Energy, so it will definitely be extremely terrifying. Furthermore, she probably doesn’t have a good impression of you. Even if you have a Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth, you will probably die after entering. It’s basically impossible to obtain her blood essence.”

“Is there no other way?” Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed.

Even the antelope said that there was no hope, so Zhou Wen felt that there was no need to take the risk.

To his surprise, the antelope changed the topic and continued writing. “However, your luck isn’t bad. I happen to have some of her blood essence.”

“You have her blood essence? When did you obtain it?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe the antelope.

The Guardian had always been inside the log. The log had never been opened, and the antelope had never touched the log. How could it obtain the blood essence?

“Of course it wasn’t obtained recently. The one in the log is one of the few Guardians that survived the last Guardian Battle. This blood essence was obtained in the past.” After the antelope finished writing, it shook its body and a small jade bottle dropped from the fur around its neck.

This fellow is actually hiding something? Zhou Wen sized up the antelope’s fur in surprise.

The antelope’s fur was very short. Only the fur around its neck was slightly longer. However, it couldn’t hide a bottle no matter what, so he had no idea how it had hidden the bottle.

Zhou Wen reached out to take the jade bottle, but he was stopped by the antelope’s hooves.

“You can have the blood essence, but I have a condition,” the antelope wrote.

“You live off me, and you still want to negotiate with me?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Do you want it?” The antelope had no intention of reasoning with Zhou Wen.

“Alright, tell me. What are your conditions?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to ask patiently.

“In the future, if you have the ability, you have to make another trip to Forbidden City and get something from her. Originally, as long as you contracted with her, that thing would have been ours, but it ended up in this state. Now, there’s no other way but to use force,” the antelope wrote.

“What’s that?” Zhou Wen asked.

“You’ll know when the time comes. Don’t worry, I’ll help you. When the time comes, we’ll split it according to our agreement—20-80.”

“That won’t do. In the past, we said 20-80 because you were the one who found the log. Now that we are cooperating, we naturally can’t do 20-80 again. 40-60, I’ll get 60% while you get 40%. After all, I know nothing about it. The risk is rather high.” Although Zhou Wen didn’t know what it was, he wasn’t willing to suffer a loss.

He wanted the blood essence anyway, so he definitely had to agree to the antelope’s conditions. It wasn’t a bad idea to fight for some benefits.

“Impossible.” The antelope rejected it directly.

Seeing its firm attitude, Zhou Wen said, “Then split it 50-50. It can’t be any lower.”

“You don’t want the blood essence?” The antelope pointed at the small jade bottle.

“40-60. You get 60% while I get 40%. That’s my bottom line. Besides, you have to put in some effort. You can’t let me take it all alone,” Zhou Wen said.

“Deal.” The antelope handed the jade bottle to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen took the jade bottle and opened it. He saw a tiny blob of blood inside. The blood was a strange purple color that suffused faint purple starlight. It was as though there was purple star sand inside. It looked beautiful and mysterious.

Zhou Wen had come into contact with the blood essence of many Guardians, so he knew at a glance that it was the blood essence of a real Guardian. However, its attribute was different from anything he had seen before. It was very similar to the aura in the log, so it was likely real.

After returning to the training room with the blood, Zhou Wen attempted to use the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art to absorb the blood in the jade bottle, and he successfully refined it.

Zhou Wen immediately felt the Pocket Universe in his body erupt. The purple blood essence provided the Pocket Universe with terrifying energy, causing it to emit terrifying starlight.

Zhou Wen felt his essence, vitality, and spirit condense inside the pocket universe. This was the precursor to condensing a Life Soul.

Perhaps it was because he had absorbed too much blood essence this time—possibly about eight drops—compared to a single drop in the past, the energy contained was much more than before, causing the Life Soul to condense at an abnormally fast speed.

A speck of starlight condensed in between Zhou Wen’s brows as it shimmered with a purple glow.
