Chapter 1010: Divination House of Fate

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen realized that if he continued dodging, the magic ball would bounce faster and faster. Sooner or later, it would hit him, so he stopped dodging. He pulled out the Bronze Sparrow Sword and slashed at one of the magic balls that was bouncing towards the blood-colored avatar.

Zhou Wen was already prepared for the magic ball to suddenly vanish, but it didn’t vanish. It was struck by the Bronze Sparrow Sword.

It was different from what he had imagined. The magic ball didn’t seem to be very hard, nor did it have any explosive effects. It didn’t have ice or fire, nor did it have the effects of the yellow ball.

Just like that, the black-and-white magic ball was cleaved into two by Zhou Wen before shattering into powder.

In the next second, the devil-like clown appeared to his left. His sharp black fingernails stabbed at the blood-colored avatar’s neck.

The clown’s speed was very fast; it was definitely at the Mythical stage. However, Zhou Wen’s reaction and speed weren’t slow either. He extended his hand to block the clown’s strike.

He originally wanted to use his left hand to block, but he immediately realized that something was amiss. This was because he was thinking of his left hand, but his right hand ended up moving. Furthermore, when he wanted to block with his left hand, his right hand raised to the right. It was completely opposite from what he had imagined.

In an instant, Zhou Wen reacted and understood what had happened.

Seeing that the clown’s dagger-like fingernails had already touched the skin on the blood-colored avatar’s neck and were about to stab into it, Zhou Wen’s body spun like a top as he barely dodged the strike.

That magic ball actually has the ability to distort thoughts and physical actions. When I think left, I move right. When I think up, it moves down. If it were anyone else, they wouldn’t have reacted in time. The more they try to dodge, the more they would slam into danger. Zhou Wen was extremely calm. After figuring out the reason, he controlled his body to circle around the clown.

It was very difficult for ordinary people to not make mistakes after their thoughts and actions were reversed, but Zhou Wen’s mind was extremely clear. He didn’t make any mistakes as he dodged the clown’s repeated attacks.

After the blood-colored avatar was hit by the magic ball, the other magic balls didn’t attack him. One of them hit Tyrant Behemoth, and then Tyrant Behemoth revealed a situation where its thoughts and actions were completely opposite.

Tyrant Behemoth clearly didn’t have Zhou Wen’s powerful thought processes. It immediately became at a loss for what to do. It wanted to rush left, but it ended up charging right. Instead of retreating, it advanced. It nearly tripped on its left leg and fell to the ground.

Sunday’s Mischief Clown is so powerful... Just its ability is so strange. I wonder how many Mischief Clowns there are here. If there are as many as usual, it would be very terrifying without even including the other dimensional creatures, Zhou Wen thought as he fought.

Soon, Zhou Wen discovered the secret of the Mischief Clown’s magic ball. It turned out that the magic ball couldn’t penetrate walls. Instead, during its flight, it caused a spinning vortex to appear around the ball due to its high-speed rotation. Once the vortex stopped, the magic ball would automatically deviate from its trajectory and dodge the fist. It would slide down or sideways, making it look like it had vanished.

In fact, Mischief Clown didn’t have spatial abilities. It was just that the technique of throwing the magic ball was very powerful.

The dimensional creatures here are really interesting. I wonder if a Companion Egg will drop? Zhou Wen was extremely interested in the Sunday clown’s ability. Be it the method of throwing the magic ball or the ability to subvert one’s thoughts with the magic ball, they were very useful. Furthermore, the clown had the ability to move stealthily.

If it were anyone else, they would be doomed if they couldn’t control their bodies when their Companion Beasts couldn’t be used normally. However, these abilities weren’t of much use against Zhou Wen. Soon, he saw an opportunity. When the clown appeared again, he used Light Concealment Sword to kill it.

‘Killed Mythical creature, Devil Clown.’

Nothing dropped. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be somewhat disappointed. So this isn’t Mischief Clown anymore. It’s a true Mythical creature. From the looks of it, I’ll have to farm this place a few more times in the future. Even if I can’t obtain a Companion Egg, I can still obtain skill crystals.

After finishing off the Devil Clown, Zhou Wen continued walking forward. However, before long, the blood-colored avatar suddenly died and the game screen went black.

How did I die?

Zhou Wen carefully recalled, but he still didn’t know how he died. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He had no choice but to drip his blood to revive again and enter Maze of Lies. This time, Zhou Wen didn’t see the Demon Clown on the merry-go-round, so he walked straight ahead.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that there would be quite a number of Devil Clowns here, but he only saw one. He didn’t find a second one.

When Zhou Wen walked into an ancient castle, he discovered another dimensional creature. This time, it was a Divination Witch.

The Divination Witch started appearing in the dungeon on Wednesday. She was also an Epic dimensional creature. She was a terrifying-looking old woman in blue clothes and a blue hat. She even held a crystal ball in her hand.

Her abilities didn’t seem to be anything impressive. She could only use the crystal ball to activate some light-attribute waves.

However, the Divination Witch in front of him was completely different. No, it wasn’t one, but two.

Two witches sat side by side behind the long table in the ancient castle. One was dressed in white and had a white hat, while the other was dressed in black and had a black hat. Both of them were maidens. They were completely different from the old and ugly witches in the previous few days. They were rather fair and beautiful.

Furthermore, they didn’t have a crystal ball in their hands. The white-robed witch held a black poker card in her hand, while the black-robed witch held a white poker card in her hand.

The two witches sat there and silently watched Zhou Wen walk into the hall. They had no intention of attacking.

“Welcome to the Divination House of Fate. You can draw a card from our hands to decide your fate.” The white-robed witch and the black-robed witch spoke at the same time. Their voices were completely identical. If one closed their eyes, they would think that only one person was speaking.

“Why should I draw your cards?” Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in playing divination games with them. He drew his sword and slashed at the white-robed witch.

The white-robed witch was surprisingly weak. He was already prepared for a fierce battle, but the white-robed witch had fallen to the sword and had her head beheaded by the Bronze Sparrow Sword.

However, at the instant the white-robed witch’s head was chopped off, Zhou Wen realized that the blood-colored avatar’s head had also fallen. The way it fell was identical to the white-robed witch’s head. It was as though it had been chopped off by someone.

The game screen went black as Zhou Wen faced death again.

This dungeon is really sick. What the hell is it? Zhou Wen hadn’t died like this in a long time. The Maze of Lies was somewhat different in every aspect.

Thankfully, this was in-game. It wasn’t a big deal to die once. If it was in reality, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t take the risk in such a dangerous place.

I wonder how much Frod and company know about the Maze of Lies on Sunday? Zhou Wen felt that helping Frod this time wouldn’t go so smoothly.
