Chapter 1808 Decision

“Zhou Wen, isn’t it obvious? If she really had the ability to escape, how would I still be alive?” Jing Daoxian continued.

He had to admit that what Jing Daoxian said made sense.

If The Thearch was really as strong and free as she said, how could she tolerate Jing Daoxian spouting nonsense in front of her?

Zhou Wen looked at The Thearch, hoping to hear her explanation.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to make a decision. The present situation was very beneficial to him. Perhaps this was the opportunity to dig out the truth.

The Thearch didn’t seem to have any intention of explaining to Zhou Wen. She only looked at Jing Daoxian and said, “You risked your life to come here to tell him that this box can’t be opened?”

Not a single word was an explanation, but it was more powerful than any explanation.

Jing Daoxian had risked his life to come here. Before entering Nüwa Temple, he even tried using Super Jinx to scam Zhou Wen. He definitely wasn’t doing it just to stop Zhou Wen from opening the box.

If that was the case, there was no need for him to invite Zhou Wen to Chess Mountain.

.

“I came for a reason, but the item isn’t in that box,” Jing Daoxian said slowly without flinching.

...

“That’s interesting. Why are you here?” The Thearch looked at Jing Daoxian with interest.

“For you.” Jing Daoxian’s answer not only surprised The Thearch, but also Zhou Wen.

“Are you trying to say that I’m Earth’s Companion Beast?” The Thearch laughed.

“Ahem, there’s no mistake about it. She’s the real Earth Companion Beast. That box is something that suppresses her. If you open it, she will escape. Zhou Wen, you should know better than me what kind of impact the birth of a planet’s Companion Beast will have on the planet,” Jing Daoxian said to Zhou Wen.

In just a short while, Zhou Wen had heard two versions regarding Earth’s Companion Beast. One version said that he was Earth’s Companion Beast, and now, Jing Daoxian said that The Thearch was Earth’s Companion Beast. Who was lying?

The Thearch had no intention of defending herself. She only smiled at the two of them like a spectator watching a program. “You said that she’s Earth’s Companion Beast. What evidence do you have?” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t believe Jing Daoxian’s one-sided story.

Jing Daoxian leaned against the wall and sat down. As he panted, he said, “Zhou Wen, think about it carefully. Who on Earth can control everything on Earth and satisfy all their wishes? Do those dimensional Apocalypse powerhouses even have such abilities?”

Jing Daoxian was indeed able to grasp the crux with every word he said. This was also something Zhou Wen had always found suspicious.

The Thearch could do whatever she wanted on Earth with the power of wishes. This ability couldn’t be summarized with the word powerful.

“Is that all?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that this was enough to confirm that The Thearch was Earth’s Companion Beast.

Jing Daoxian coughed out blood. After a while, he continued, “I don’t know if she told you that only you can come here. Back then, the four of us entered Nüwa Temple. Although we went to different spaces, all of us ended up meeting her. Of course, I can only say that I’ve seen her before. I also obtained the Lost Immortal Sutra from her. Whether Wang Mingyuan and company saw her or not, I’m only guessing. Whether you believe me or not is up to you.”

“Is what he said true?” Zhou Wen asked The Thearch.

The Thearch had indeed said that only Zhou Wen could come here, but now, Jing Daoxian had also entered. This was problematic.

If Jing Daoxian had really been here before, it could only mean that The Thearch’s words were even more unbelievable.

“Would you believe me if I said that he has never been here?” The Thearch said with a smile.

“But he’s here now. You told me that only Earth’s Companion Beast can reach this place,” Zhou Wen said.

“That was before you obtained the key. Now that you are here, there are naturally no restrictions. However, even so, I’m indeed surprised that he came here alive,” The Thearch said indifferently.

What the two of them said made sense, so Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to determine who was more trustworthy.

However, who was more trustworthy wasn’t a choice for Zhou Wen. He didn’t need to make a choice.

“Jing Daoxian, you said that she’s Earth’s Companion Beast and you came for her. Now that you’ve seen her, what do you plan on doing?” Zhou Wen asked Jing Daoxian.

“Naturally, I’ll contract her and make her work for me,” Jing Daoxian said.

“How? You don’t seem fine. Are you sure you can defeat her?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that Jing Daoxian had that ability.

Ignoring the fact that Jing Daoxian was already injured, even if he wasn’t injured, how could he defeat The Thearch?

“I can’t do it now, but you can.” Jing Daoxian coughed and said, “Don’t be fooled by her appearance. She’s very weak now. She’s definitely not your match. Remember what I told you? On this day every year, that flower will vanish and leave Chess Mountain. This is definitely not a lie. After that flower leaves, she won’t have that omnipotent strength. She’s very weak now. This is our only chance. There’s not much time left. You have to make a choice as soon as possible.”

“Is that so?” Zhou Wen looked at The Thearch.

“What do you think?” The Thearch continued grinning at them. She didn’t stop them from talking, nor did she have any intention of explaining

“Think about it carefully. Did she tell you that she’s an Immortal, but she’s clearly human. How can she be an Immortal?” Jing Daoxian continued. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Why?” Zhou Wen looked at The Thearch. He was also puzzled by this question.

Anyone could tell that The Thearch’s body was 100% human. No one would believe the obvious lie of her being Immortal.

However, with The Thearch’s scheming abilities, would she use such an obvious lie?

“Are you questioning me?” The Thearch curled her lips as though she was extremely disdainful.

“I just want to know the truth,” Zhou Wen said.

“The truth is in front of you. Open the box and you will naturally understand the truth,” The Thearch said indifferently.

“Even if you don’t believe me, you can subdue her first before opening the box,” Jing Daoxian added.

“That’s a good idea.” Zhou Wen looked at The Thearch and slowly pulled out the Human Sovereign Stone Saber hanging at his waist.

At this point, there had to be an end to the matter. After hearing both sides, Zhou Wen already had his own judgment.

Just as Jing Daoxian had said, he didn’t have much time left. He had to make a decision.

Hum!

The Human Sovereign Stone Saber tore through the air and slashed out with a hum.
