Chapter 794: Tai Sui’s Might

Translator: CKtalon

Suddenly, the white chick on Zhou Wen’s shoulder flapped its wings and flew in front of the dragon breath. It opened its mouth and sucked in the dragon breath. The dragon breath that filled the sky was sucked into the white chick’s mouth, leaving nothing behind.

Gu Shanshui, Butterfly, and company looked at the white chick in a daze. They knew how powerful the chick was and guessed that it was a phoenix descendant.

However, the white-chick form that Tai Sui took on didn’t appear too conspicuous. Furthermore, it didn’t look like a fire-elemental creature. It couldn’t be a descendant of a phoenix.

Furthermore, phoenixes were rare. One was extremely lucky to have one. It was hard to imagine that a person could have two phoenixes.

In addition, Tai Sui usually seemed to be in a daze and didn’t move much. Most of the time, it stood motionless on Zhou Wen’s shoulder. They didn’t pay much attention to the silly white chick, believing that it was only an ordinary Companion Beast at the Epic stage.

However, to their surprise, Tai Sui opened its mouth and swallowed the dragon breath of the Dragon King Gu, as though nothing had happened. They were pleasantly surprised.

Although Tai Sui was powerful, it wasn’t really invincible. The main thing was that the dragon breath of the Dragon King Gu was different from real dragon breath.

The dragon breath of the Dragon King Gu was somewhat similar to the corpse fog of the Corpse Bug. It was formed from a large number of miniature Gu, and Tai Sui was the nemesis of these things.

In fact, it wasn’t just the dragon breath. Even the Dragon King Gu itself was a complicated microscopic agglomerate. To Tai Sui, the Dragon King Gu’s body was a feast.

Tai Sui flapped its wings and charged at the Dragon King Gu. The Dragon King Gu clearly didn’t know how powerful Tai Sui was. It opened its mouth and swallowed Tai Sui who was flying towards it.

Everyone was alarmed. They originally thought that the white bird could fight the Dragon King Gu, but to their surprise, it was swallowed in one mouthful.

The Dragon King Gu was the king of all Gu. Its body contained all kinds of microscopic Gu. If one was swallowed by it, they would be invaded by large numbers of Gu. Even a Mythical creature might not be able to withstand it.

But at that moment, Gu Shanshui and company suddenly saw the Dragon King Gu roar at the sky as though it was in extreme pain. Then, they saw a small hole appear in its abdomen. Tai Sui crawled out and pecked at the Dragon King Gu’s body.

The Dragon King Gu’s body was filled with Gu. Ignoring the fact that it had just been eaten, ordinary creatures would be parasitized by the Gu just by touching it. Even Mythical creatures would probably die tragically.

The white bird’s casual pecking at the Dragon King Gu’s body was unbelievable.

“Is that really the Dragon King Gu? It can’t be fake, right?” Gu Lou had a look of doubt. How could the legendary king of innumerable Gu, Dragon King Gu, be casually eaten by a small white chick?

Tai Sui circled around the Dragon King Gu and pecked at it, leaving holes in its body.

The Dragon King Gu released terrifying dragon breaths and might, but they were useless against Tai Sui. Tai Sui was the nemesis of microscopic creatures. Even Tyrant Behemoth might be parasitized by the Gu on the Dragon King Gu. Even Torch Dragon found it difficult to withstand the Dragon King Gu’s power. After all, the Dragon King Gu was transformed from a Gu that devoured a true dragon. It was naturally effective against dragons.

Tai Sui happened to be the nemesis of the Dragon King Gu. No matter how powerful the Dragon King Gu was, it was still pecked by Tai Sui.

Gu Shanshui and the rest watched in a daze as the Dragon King Gu was eaten by the small white chick. In the end, it escaped into the water and tore through the bottom of the river. The legendary king of innumerable Gu had actually escaped just like that.

Tai Sui’s body swelled up as it couldn’t eat any more. Furthermore, it wasn’t fast, so it couldn’t catch up to the Dragon King Gu underwater. It flew back and landed on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.

Gu Shanshui and company looked at Tai Sui on Zhou Wen’s shoulder in surprise. They originally imagined that the chick with the phoenix bloodline was already a god-like existence, but they never expected the nameless, white chick which definitely wasn’t a phoenix was even more terrifying. Even the Dragon King Gu could only be trampled by it. It even fled in such a sorry state. It was unbelievable.

Unlike the chick, although Tai Sui looked similar to the chick, it didn’t have the aura or ability of a phoenix. Gu Shanshui and Li Mobai couldn’t deduce its origins.

Zhou Wen handed the calabash back to Gu Shanshui. “Master Gu, let’s leave this place now.”

Gu Shanshui didn’t reach out to take the calabash. “Mr. Zhou, if it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t even be alive. How would I have the nerve to take this Corpse Bug? It’s best you keep it.”

Zhou Wen said with a smile, “I don’t know how to tame Gu. What’s the point of keeping it? Master Gu, if you feel apologetic, teach me a few Gu nurturing techniques when we return.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Mr. Zhou, it’s my honor that you are willing to learn how to rear Gu from me. I will definitely teach you everything and not hide anything,” Gu Shanshui said seriously.

“Let’s talk when we get back. This isn’t a place to talk,” Zhou Wen said as he handed the calabash to Gu Shanshui.

Gu Shanshui didn’t decline. After carefully putting away the calabash, he steered the boat towards the exit of Dragon Corpse River.

Zhou Wen looked in the direction the Dragon King Gu had vanished with a strange look in his eyes.

If not for Tai Sui, even with a Mythical Companion Beast, defeating the Dragon King Gu wouldn’t be easy. Furthermore, it was very likely that they would be parasitized by the Gu before the battle began.

However, even Tai Sui only managed to injure the Dragon King Gu. The energy contained in its body was too immense. Tai Sui couldn’t digest it all.

What caught Zhou Wen’s attention was that the Primordial Spore that he had placed in the river had taken the opportunity to enter the Dragon King Gu’s body, as though it wanted to parasitize it.

However, Zhou Wen could sense that the Primordial Spore had yet to succeed. Now that it had been taken away by the Dragon King Gu, Zhou Wen could only sense that the Primordial Spore was still alive due to the distance. The connection between them had become very weak. He didn’t know how the Primordial Spore was doing in the Dragon King Gu’s body.

If I can successfully parasitize it and take the Dragon King Gu for my own, I’ll have nothing to be afraid of in the South District, Zhou Wen thought.

Zhou Wen wasn’t too worried about the safety of the Primordial Spore. It had an Eternal Immortality Life Providence, so killing it wasn’t an easy task.

However, it would take a long time to parasitize a Mythical creature. Zhou Wen couldn’t wait for it in Dragon Corpse River, so he could only leave.

Without the threat of the Dragon King Gu, the other Gu were afraid of the chick, so none of them dared to rush over. The group successfully left Dragon Corpse River.

Zhou Wen could also sense the existence of Primordial Spore outside Dragon Corpse River. Although the connection was very weak, it was enough to determine whether Primordial Spore was still alive and its location.

Zhou Wen didn’t see any tiny palm symbols along the way and couldn’t help but find it a pity. The Dragon Corpse River had no fewer Gu than the Valley of No Return. If he could download it into a game dungeon, it would be a good place to grind. Unfortunately, he couldn’t find the tiny palm symbol.
