Chapter 1609: Junior Brother

Translator: CKtalon

Why is this teleportation nexus so resilient? Zhou Wen had already used the Void Salamander to strike seven or eight times, but only a portion of the teleportation nexus’s foundation was destroyed. Its main body remained.

‘When Zhou Wen returned to the Holy Land, he immediately realized that something was amiss. At the instant he appeared, the surrounding space distorted as a strange invisible domain power enveloped him.

Old K, Jiuyang, and Xiao appeared not far away. Zhou Wen immediately realized what had happened.

However, since Zhou Wen dared to be here, he had already thought of a solution. He wasn’t surprised.

“Zhou Wen, you will definitely die today for daring to destroy the Holy Land’s teleportation nexus,” Old K said coldly as he raised the scepter in his hand. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Unfortunately, the satellites could only capture the scene, but it was difficult to capture sounds from afar. The people watching the livestream couldn’t hear what Old K was saying. They only knew that the Holy Land had finally sent someone.

“That’s Jiuyang! The other two Saints’ identities don’t seem to be inferior to Jiuyang’s. Their strength shouldn’t be too different, right?”

“One Jiuyang isn’t much weaker than Egg Sovereign. Now that three have appeared, Egg Sovereign is in danger.”

“That might not be the case. Egg Sovereign’s Tiger Soul General hasn’t been released. It’s hard to say who’s stronger.”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. Su Yi and Professor Gu were also commentating. Su Yi asked, “Professor Gu, a Saint has finally appeared. What do you think of Egg Sovereign’s chances of winning?”

Professor Gu cleared his throat and said, “From the previous battle, the difference in strength between Jiuyang and Egg Sovereign isn’t too great. If the other two Saints aren’t weaker than Jiuyang, Egg Sovereign will probably be in danger this time.”

“Since Professor Gu says that Egg Sovereign is in danger, it means Egg Sovereign should be safe.”

“Lwas still worried about Egg Sovereign just now. After hearing Professor Gu’s analysis, I feel a lot more at ease.”

“Didn’t we agree not to utilize the weapon of mass destruction—Professor Gu? Why are we using it now? Those Saints are really unlucky.”

The screen was filled with such optimistic comments. Professor Gu’s face immediately warped when he saw them.

“From the battle just now, Egg Sovereign should be proficient in spatial teleportation. It shouldn’t be that easy for those Saints to attack him, right?” Su Yi said.

Professor Gu said expressionlessly, “From a professional point of view, it’s impossible that the Holy Land doesn’t know that Egg Sovereign is good at spatial teleportation. Since they sent Saints, they naturally have a solution. If Zhou Wen were to retreat now, he might still have a chance of escaping. It

would probably be too late if he waits any longer.”

“It’s set! It’s set! Professor Gu just gave his blessings. Egg Sovereign is going to be invincible.”

“Sir, with your words, I think the Holy Land has already lost.”

‘There were all kinds of optimistic comments on the screen, leaving Professor Gu’s face livid and pale. He was so angry that he stopped talking.

In fact, all of his analysis couldn’t be said to be completely without reason. In fact, there was some evidence. He wasn’t randomly spouting nonsense, but in the end, he was teased by the netizens, making him feel embarrassed.

Zhou Wen felt regretful. Although he had already thought of a way to break through the encirclement of Old K and Xiao’s domains, he could only escape. It was impossible for him to continue bombarding the teleportation nexus.

Til come again in the future. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. Just as he was about to rush out, he suddenly heard a voice not far away.

“Do Saints like to bully others with numbers?” A three-sail ship flew over from the distant sky. On the bow was a man.

The man wore a white robe and held an ancient sword in his arms. He sat casually at the bow of the ship with the ancient sword in one hand and a small teapot in the other. After he finished speaking, he took a sip.

The white robe on his body fluttered with the wind. On his back was the word “Ya.”

“It’s Ya… Why is he here…” Although the people watching the livestream couldn’t hear what Ya was saying, they recognized him at a glance.

“Ya doesn’t have a grudge against Egg Sovereign, right? He won’t help those Saints, right?”

“Ya hates Guardians the most. How can he help the Holy Land? He must be here to help Egg Sovereign.”

“Eh… There seems to be someone over there…”

On the other side of the screen, something seemed to be approaching.

“Quick, look over there. It looks like… Immortal…”

The scene changed a little. Indeed, on the other side, a person was riding the wind and walking through the void as though he was stepping on invisible stairs.

He walked very slowly, but in the blink of an eye, he arrived near the battlefield. It was none other than Immortal from the League of Guardians.

“Why is Immortal here? The League of Guardians is a lackey of the dimension. He must be here to help those Saints kill Egg Sovereign.”

“Loriginally thought that with Ya’s help, Egg Sovereign might still have a chance of survival. I never expected the League of Guardians’ Immortal to come. They should be archenemies, right?”

‘As everyone was discussing, they saw Ya carry the ancient sword on his shoulder and suddenly leap up. He tore through the air and rushed into the domain, blocking Old K and company. He said indifferently, “Junior Brother, leave these three to me. Continue doing what you want to do.”

‘When Ya said this, he used some special power to make his voice sound even louder than the void lightning. Even the program team filming hundreds of kilometers away captured his voice.

The people watching the livestream immediately broke out into an uproar when they heard that. Holy sh*t, Egg Sovereign is actually Ya’s junior brother. So he’s from the Holy Spirit Association!

“Is the Holy Spirit Association that strong now? Ya’s junior brother is so powerful. Then, how strong is Ya now?”

“You are tempting fate!” Old K’s expression darkened as he pointed the scepter in his hand. It immediately transformed into terrifying ripples that swept towards Ya like a huge wave.

Before Ya could take action, a petal fell. Wherever the petal passed, the huge waves instantly vanished.

Immortal walked over step by step with a flower between his fingers. The petal had dropped from the withered flower.

“Holy sh*t, what’s going on? Immortal is actually here to help Egg Sovereign?”

“What’s going on? Aren’t the League of Guardians and those fellows from the Holy Land in cahoots?

“Immortal, do you know what you’re doing? Don’t think that you can be presumptuous here just because the Immortals are backing you,” Old K said coldly as he stared at Immortal.

“Of course I know what I’m doing. I don’t want to interfere in your matters, but who asked you to harm my junior brother?” Immortal said indifferently.

Immortal also used some special power to say those words. Although his voice was gentle, it was extremely clear amidst the rumbling thunder. Everyone in the distance could hear him clearly.

“No way! Could Immortal be Egg Sovereign’s senior brother?”

“That doesn’t make sense. Aren’t Immortal and Ya archenemies? How can Egg Sovereign be their junior brother at the same time?”

“There must be a mistake somewhere!”

Everyone’s mouths gaped open. They immediately thought that their ears were damaged. They must have heard wrongly or were suffering from auditory hallucinations.
