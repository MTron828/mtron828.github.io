Chapter 1073: A Cool Breeze

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen was near the Moon Goddess Temple. With the Moon Goddess around, the logger didn’t dare enter the area.

However, the Tree of Immortality was being consumed by the flames. If he didn’t save it, it would probably be charred in a few hours.

Huge cracks constantly appeared on the Moon’s surface. This was clearly a sign that the Companion Beast inside was about to appear.

Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to see the changes in Banana Fairy’s stats. He summoned her immediately.

With a flash of light, a young woman wearing a white veil was sitting on a banana leaf that resembled a boat. Her snow-white feet were swaying playfully.

Her face was beautifully delicate, but her figure was petite. As the banana leaf floated in the air, she looked like a fairy.

“Little Fairy, can you help me extinguish the flames on that tree?” Zhou Wen pointed at the flames on the Tree of Immortality.

Banana Fairy blinked and looked in the direction of the Tree of Immortality. Then, she opened her red lips and spat out a cool breeze.

Zhou Wen was filled with anticipation. Banana Fairy’s Supreme Yin Wind was known as the Three Realms’ Best Wind. Furthermore, it was Yin-elemental. It should have an extremely powerful restraining effect on flames.

With the help of the Supreme Yin Wind, he might have a chance of defeating the logger.

A cool breeze silently blew into the darkness.

The wind that blew out of Banana Fairy’s mouth was just too weak.

“Little Fairy, use more strength!” Zhou Wen was somewhat anxious. After all, the other party was a top existence at the Terror grade. He didn’t know if Banana Fairy’s casual blow would be effective.

However, in the next second, Zhou Wen’s mouth gaped open.

The cool wind that looked like a breeze immediately extinguished the flames and demonic aura when it came into contact with them. As for the demonic aura, it dissipated.

In an instant, the demonic aura that had filled the area vanished without a trace. The terrifying fire was also extinguished. Not even a wisp of smoke remained as though the fire had never existed.

Bam! Bam!

Grim Demon and the logger slammed into the trunk of the Tree of Immortality, but they didn’t fall. Their limbs stuck to the trunk, unable to move in the wind. The muscles on their faces were distorted by the wind, and frost formed on their brows and hair.

If not for the Tree of Immortality, they would have been blown into space.

Zhou Wen was at a loss for words. After a long while, he exclaimed, “Holy sh*t! Isn’t this a little too strong?”

Only when this gust of wind passed did Grim Demon and the logger fall from the tree trunk. They failed to get up immediately.

“Supreme Yin Wind!” Moon Goddess’s voice was somewhat odd.

She was Lady Supreme Yin, so she was naturally no stranger to the Supreme Yin Wind. She immediately recognized it.

However, she found it unbelievable that a Companion Beast could use the Supreme Yin Wind, and this Companion Beast was Zhou Wen’s.

The logger changed his stats again, turning from fire to ice. He condensed an ice ax and threw it at Banana Fairy.

The ice ax vanished in midair. All that could be seen was ice swirling over.

Banana Fairy sat on the banana leaf without dodging. She pouted her red lips and blew out another mouthful of fragrance.

However, the wind this time wasn’t as cool as before. Instead, it was scorching.

When the fragrant wind encountered the power of the ice ax, blazing white flames appeared out of thin air. Instantly, the ice ax completely melted. From ice to water, then from water to steam, it finally turned into nothingness in the blink of an eye.

The strong wind swept over with flames and devoured the logger’s body. It instantly melted the ice aura and his body immediately burned.

“Ah!”

“We’re on the same side... We’re on the same side...” Another tragic cry sounded. It was Grim Demon, who had just gotten up and was standing not far from the logger. He was implicated as his demonic aura caught fire, turning him into a flaming man.

Banana Fairy’s wind was good at everything, but its area was just too wide. It didn’t distinguish between friend and foe, causing Grim Demon to be implicated.

“Supreme Yang Wind!” Moon Goddess was even more bewildered.

Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang were two conflicting attributes, and they were two extremes. A Companion Beast actually had the ability to control Supreme Yin Wind and Supreme Yang Wind at the same time. This was just too terrifying. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If she can advance to the Calamity grade... Moon Goddess didn’t dare imagine such a scene. Just with one gust of the wind, even Earth would probably suffer an apocalyptic end, much less the Moon.

“Ahem... Little Fairy... That’s one of us...” Zhou Wen hurriedly helped Grim Demon resolve the situation.

It was unknown what kind of fire Banana Fairy’s flames were, but Grim Demon failed to extinguish the flames on his body. He cried out from the heat.

Banana Fairy blew out another gust of wind. This time, it was the Supreme Yin Wind. As the breeze brushed past, the flames on Grim Demon’s body immediately extinguished.

Just as the logger turned into the fire attribute and wanted to absorb the flames on his body, the flames on his body were extinguished by the Supreme Yin Wind. Then, she saw Grim Demon and the logger fly out together.

Bam! Bam!

They slammed into the Tree of Immortality again and had their limbs plastered to the tree trunk. After the Supreme Yin Wind blew, they fell again.

Grim Demon didn’t dare continue staying there. He could tell that this unknown Companion Beast was a destroyer who didn’t distinguish between friend and foe. She was even more unscrupulous than himself. If he stayed, due to her whims, it might be the end of him.

The logger struggled to get up after falling from the tree, but he suddenly held his chest. His chest seemed to have been pierced by an invisible sword.

Blood flowed down the invisible sword hilt and dripped onto the ground.

The logger wanted to pull out the Demonic Sword, but he felt his strength rapidly disappearing. He knew that he had no chance of fighting again.

“I’ve waited for countless years. I never expected such an outcome.” The logger sat under the Tree of Immortality and looked up at the osmanthus petals dancing in the sky. However, there wasn’t much anger or hatred on his face.

He extended his hand and caught a petal. He held it in his palm and stared at it, but his gaze wasn’t focused on the petal. It was as though his emotions had flown elsewhere.

“Back then, I was focused on cultivating and attempted to escape my mortal coils. Instead, I neglected the most important person... This can be considered my retribution... Sorry for making you wait so long... I’ll be accompanying you soon...” As the logger spoke, he slowly looked up and his gaze landed on the distant Zhou Wen.

Don’t tell me he wants to self-destruct and drag me down with him? Zhou Wen subconsciously took a few steps back.

To his surprise, the logger said, “Do you have anyone you want to protect?”

“If not, I wouldn’t have stopped you,” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s good. Be careful of those fellows in the dimension. Don’t believe their so-called rules.” The logger nodded before closing his eyes. “Unfortunately, I won’t be able to see the day you cut down the Tree of Immortality.”
