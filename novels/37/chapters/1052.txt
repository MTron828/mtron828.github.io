Chapter 1053: Where is He?

Translator: CKtalon

After Shen Yuchi left, the fearful expression on Wei Ge’s face vanished. He sat back down and picked up his teacup to slowly drink tea as he watched the livestream.

If one placed their ear close to Wei Ge’s mouth, one could hear him muttering to himself, “From the looks of it, my chance is finally here. I just don’t know if it’s a blessing or a curse.”

Battles that hadn’t been seen for more than a day were about to begin again. Many people were still looking forward to the outcome of this battle. The media had reported a little of Darkness Emissary’s abilities. He was indeed very strong. Furthermore, Zhou Ming had recently been very close to a local wealthy family. Perhaps he had already obtained a Mythical Companion Beast, so his strength was definitely not to be underestimated.

As for Grim Demon’s strength, it was unknown, but his human companion hadn’t participated. This was undoubtedly a huge disadvantage. Without a human’s participation, there were no Mythical Companion Beasts available to be used.

Grim Demon didn’t mind this. He looked at Zhou Ming, who had appeared in the arena in the Darkness Emissary armor, and said condescendingly, “I’m happy today. I’ll let you live a little longer. I’ll give you a two-move handicap before killing you.”

Zhou Wen massaged his temples when he heard Grim Demon’s words, feeling a headache.

This bastard. Doesn’t he know that I’m stalling for time? If you want to kill him in three moves, how can I stall for time? Zhou Wen decided to summon Grim Demon back to reprimand him after the battle ended. He wanted him to figure out the importance of the holy edict.

Such a speech excited all the spectators in the Federation.

“Isn’t Grim Demon too arrogant?”

“Perhaps he really has the right to be arrogant. After all, his origins are definitely not simple. The person backing him has so many Mythical Companion Beasts.”

“You said it yourself. It’s his backer who isn’t appearing in battle. Without a human accompanying him, he can’t use Companion Beasts.”

Zhou Ming only sneered. Without any hesitation, he attacked.

The power of Darkness Emissary was different from Night Thearch’s. The moment Zhou Ming attacked, the Darkness Emissary armor on his body erupted with terrifying energy. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The energy condensed in the air above his head gradually transformed into a dark door. As time passed, the dark door became clearer and clearer. It emitted a terrifying dark aura like a door to hell.

Anyone could tell that using such a skill required a large amount of time to channel the strength. If it was a normal battle, Darkness Emissary wouldn’t have the time or opportunity to use such a skill.

However, as Grim Demon had actually given him a two-move handicap, Zhou Ming took the opportunity to use this skill.

Ordinary people knew that skills that required time to gather strength were typically very terrifying.

“Grim Demon really deserves it. I’m afraid it’s irrevocably committed now.”

“What a powerful Essence Energy fluctuation. It has such a powerful aura even before it’s fully formed. This strike must be extraordinary.”

After a few minutes, the dark door condensed above Zhou Ming’s head.

“As you wish. Let my Door of Darkness take you to the Seamless Abyss.” Zhou Ming finally spoke. Almost at the same time, the Door of Darkness opened.

A strange suction force was produced in the dark world behind the door, sucking everything nearby into the dark door.

Zhou Ming was very confident in this move. He had once used it to instantly kill an extremely powerful Mythical creature. The only pity was that after using this move, the Mythical creature was reduced to nothing, leaving no spoils behind.

Go to hell. This is the outcome of underestimating me. Zhou Ming sneered inwardly as he waited to see Grim Demon’s horrified expression when he was sucked into the Dark World.

But soon, the sneer on Zhou Ming’s face turned to horror.

Grim Demon floated in the air and moved. He continued looking down at him as though the suction force in the Door of Darkness didn’t exist.

Impossible... The suction force of the Dark World is enough to devour top Mythical creatures... How can this be... Zhou Ming was alarmed and furious. He gathered his strength and pushed the Door of Darkness closer to Grim Demon.

The closer the Door of Darkness was to Grim Demon, the greater the suction force of the Dark World. However, when the Door of Darkness was almost in front of Grim Demon, Grim Demon remained standing there motionless.

“Stop dawdling. You’ve still got one move left.” Grim Demon waved his hand and demonic aura surged, shattering the Door of Darkness.

Pfft!

However, at the same time as the Door of Darkness shattered, Zhou Ming spewed out blood as he fell backward.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Ming immediately surrendered and left the arena.

Instantly, all the spectators looked at Grim Demon in a daze. Their shock was indescribable.

Although Darkness Emissary wasn’t very strong, it was ranked in the top twenty. The attack he had channeled with all his might had been easily dispersed by Grim Demon, scaring Zhou Ming into admitting defeat.

Furthermore, anyone could tell that Grim Demon had no intention of doing anything to Zhou Ming. It was an unintentional strike.

“This Grim Demon... is so powerful...”

“D*mn, this is too ferocious.”

“Who is his contractor? I really want to know.”

“For real? Is the difference between Guardians that great?”

...

Zhou Wen never expected Grim Demon to be so ferocious. With a casual wave of his hand, he had destroyed Darkness Emissary’s all-out strike.

The Terror grade is indeed powerful. Without the Terror transformation ability, even Mythical creatures are nothing. Yet, I’m not even considered nothing. How tragic. Zhou Wen wished he could immediately advance to the Mythical stage.

Grim Demon was depressed. He remembered that the Guardians of his era weren’t that weak.

He was originally prepared to unleash a massacre, but it ended before it even began.

What depressed Grim Demon even more was that none of the people who had been constantly challenging him previously challenged him again. The cube also lost its video broadcast because there were no Guardians challenging it again. It returned to the ranking menu.

On the rankings, Grim Demon was first, while Ya was second.

People waited for a while, but no one challenged Grim Demon again. That strike had stunned all the Guardians. Even if someone wanted to challenge him, they wouldn’t act rashly like before.

I never expected such an unexpected gain. Zhou Wen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he saw Grim Demon return.

He had previously wanted to reprimand Grim Demon, but he never expected that after Grim Demon’s ruckus, he would end up with more time. Perhaps he could while away the 48 hours.

“Well done,” Zhou Wen said as he patted Grim Demon on the shoulder.

...

On the Internet, the scene of Grim Demon accidentally defeating Darkness Emissary had already become an emoji. Someone even added lines to the picture.

“Fight me... Eh... Where is he...”
