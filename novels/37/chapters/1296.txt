Chapter 1297: Another Invitation

Translator: CKtalon

“This is what a foundation begets. The Holy Spirit Association paid such a huge price to enter the rankings, but the League of Guardians didn’t even deploy their most powerful Immortal to enter the rankings. Furthermore, they obtained two stars and rank above the Holy Spirit Association.”

“Indeed, the League of Guardians is still too powerful.”

“You can’t say that. With so many preceding examples, the League of Guardians can come up with a corresponding strategy. It doesn’t mean that their strength is definitely stronger than the Holy Spirit Association’s. It’s just that the people and skills they use are just right.”

“That’s true, but they are ultimately too strong.”

“They reached the Golden Palace at such a fast speed, but they only obtained two stars. It looks like the speed of reaching the Golden Palace doesn’t seem to be the standard for obtaining stars?”

Everyone was somewhat surprised by the blitz strategy the League of Guardians used to enter the rankings.

Regardless of the reason—be it strategy or strength—they could only be said to be very strong for being capable of this feat.

Zhou Wen also looked at their method of clearing the level. This method wasn’t worth referencing because it required the cooperation of three abilities.

Each aspect of the trifecta of time, space, and Great Skyfiend’s speed was indispensable.

Zhou Wen had Great Skyfiend’s speed and wasn’t slower than her. He also had spatial abilities, but he didn’t have temporal abilities. Unless he could find a temporal expert like Cave Era to augment his temporal abilities, he would not be able to reach the Golden Palace before the seventh shot.

Zhou Wen had already tried many times in-game. It was difficult to reach the Golden Palace by relying solely on speed.

Unfortunately, there was no reward for reaching the Golden Palace in-game, nor could he open the door. Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in such a method. He still had to think of a way to crack the seventh bullet and kill the hidden Calamity-grade creature.

After the League of Guardians, no other creatures entered the rankings.

Tsukuyomi, The Fallen, Great Skyfiend, and Ya. There were only four creatures on the rankings.

I wonder how many stars the Cube will give if I kill that Calamity creature??Zhou Wen thought to himself.

A message notification sounded. Zhou Wen imagined that it was Liu Yun, but to his surprise, it was from Hui Haifeng.

“Zhou Wen, is there a way to reach the Golden Palace?” Hui Haifeng’s message was very direct.

“Yes.” After watching Great Skyfiend and company’s battle, Zhou Wen was even more certain that the Venusian dimensional zone in reality was the same as in-game. The Calamity-grade bullets only targeted the creature whose order in life was highest. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Do me a favor and lead a team to enter the rankings,” Hui Haifeng said.

“What for?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement. He didn’t know why people liked to be on the rankings so much. What was the point in getting onto the rankings when they couldn’t get first place?

Hui Haifeng explained, “People in the Federation now have a weaker sense of belonging to the Federation. If we don’t do anything, who will be proud of being a member of the Federation in the future? Perhaps in a few years, people will only know about the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association. There will be no Federation in their hearts.”

“Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen didn’t have a sense of belonging to the Federation, so he didn’t think there was a problem.

Hui Haifeng sighed and said, “Humans are creatures that like to fight. They want to vie for everything. With the Federation as a system, they can still coordinate in various aspects. If this fig leaf is gone one day and all sides fall out to vie for the right to rule, who do you think will suffer the most?”

Zhou Wen understood what Hui Haifeng meant. Once that happened, countless people would die from the various factions vying for supremacy. The ones suffering the most were still ordinary people.

“I can only think of a way to get on the rankings, but I can’t guarantee that the results will be good.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish for such a situation to happen.

“As long as you can get on the rankings, there’s no need to worry about anything else,” Hui Haifeng said. “When can you go? Any preparations needed?”

“Let me think about it again. There are some things I haven’t figured out yet. I need to be fully prepared,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“Alright. Give me a list of anything you need.” Hui Haifeng didn’t lack money. He controlled the Mythical Serum business, and the Hui family was now one of the richest families.

In terms of money, the Hui family might have more money than the six families, but its heritage and accumulated resources were lacking. Some things couldn’t be bought even with the Mythical Serum.

“Do you have any Luck Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Luck Companion Beasts are relatively rare. We can find them, but the highest is at the Mythical stage. I’m afraid we won’t be able to find any higher,” Hui Haifeng said.

“Any level is fine.” Zhou Wen still wanted to see if he could gather a set of lucky equipment.

“Alright, wait for my news.” Hui Haifeng hung up.

Zhou Wen knew that this matter wasn’t easy. The requirements of Lord Fourth weren’t high—he just needed to get on the rankings. That wasn’t difficult.

However, if he wanted to help Hui Haifeng get on the rankings, it wouldn’t be that simple. If he was ranked below the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association, there wasn’t much point in getting on the rankings.

Hui Haifeng didn’t send any messages for the next two to three days. It was probably because it was really difficult to find Luck Companion Beasts. Even if others had one, they would hatch it themselves and seldom sell it.

The only good news was that An Sheng and An Tianzuo had finally returned. Zhou Wen couldn’t stay in Overseer Manor forever.

“Has it been settled?” Zhou Wen noticed that An Sheng didn’t seem happy.

“In a way. We did find an Essence Crystal mine there, but the stores are much lower than expected. I reckon there are only tens of thousands of cubes,” An Sheng said.

“That’s too little?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask when he heard that there were tens of thousands of cubes.

“To ordinary people, it’s indeed a lot. However, to the accelerator, the materials refined from tens of thousands of crystals are only enough for half a shot.”

Zhou Wen was alarmed when he heard that. In the past, he only knew that the accelerator must have expended a lot of energy. Otherwise, it would be impossible for it to be that powerful. However, he never expected it to be so expensive. Tens of thousands of Essence Crystals could only be used for half a shot. If they were to fire two or three shots, the An family would definitely go bankrupt.

“However, it’s better than nothing. Let’s take it slow. The accelerator is only a form of deterrence after all. I don’t think there will be many opportunities to use it in the future.” An Sheng still had something to do. After chatting with Zhou Wen for a while, he went off.

Zhou Wen didn’t need to stay in the Overseer Manor any longer. He contacted Liu Yun and got him to arrange for a meeting with Lord Fourth.

It was naturally impossible for him to choose an area near Luoyang for his meeting with Lord Fourth. Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s instant transmission was superb, so it wasn’t difficult for him to switch to a distant place.

Finally, Zhou Wen chose the West District’s Dossier Island to meet Lord Fourth. The island was very close to the mainland and was one of the few islands controlled by the Federation.

It had a dimensional zone that produced Lucky Birds. Zhou Wen planned on taking the opportunity to have a look.

Lord Fourth agreed readily. Zhou Wen decided the time and place.

Zhou Wen didn’t tell him the location ahead of time. He only told him when and where to go before telling him the exact location when they met.

Thankfully, nothing happened. When Zhou Wen saw Lord Fourth, he couldn’t help but be surprised.

He was somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. The name ‘Lord Fourth’ sounded like an elder, but the person Zhou Wen saw was a middle-aged man. He looked refined, making it impossible to associate him with the word “lord.”

“We meet again,” Lord Fourth said with a smile.

“Jing Daoxian?” Zhou Wen was alarmed when he heard his voice.
