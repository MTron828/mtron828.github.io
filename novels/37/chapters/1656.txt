Chapter 1657 Sigh of the King Reappears

Tsukuyomi’s eyes were firm, resolute, and stubborn, but there was sorrow, sadness, relief, liberation, reluctance, pain, and other complicated emotions hidden deep in her eyes.

Even a heartless person would probably melt when they saw Tsukuyomi’s eyes. They would be moved by the sincere emotions and feel pity for her.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen was only a little slow-witted; he wasn’t truly heartless.

“Tsukuyomi, stop. I’ve never said I’m unwilling... Stop quickly...” Zhou Wen’s emotions went through upheavals as he couldn’t help but shout.

However, Tsukuyomi didn’t stop. She smiled bitterly and said, “There’s no need for you to force yourself. I’ve said it before. No one can force you to do something you aren’t willing to

much less sympathy...” Zhou Wen saw that Tsukuyomi was already on the brink of self-destruction and didn’t have the time to convince her. Therefore, he roared, “Stop when I tell you to. Cut the crap. Don’t I know what I want? If I want you to live, you should live. If I don’t want you dead, you aren’t allowed to die. From now on, you will do whatever I say.”

Tsukuyomi watched in a daze as her eyes gradually softened. The energy fluctuations on her body finally stopped expanding, but they didn’t dissipate.

“Do you know what it will entail if we kneel down? It’s not a simple ritual, but truly becoming husband and wife. Are you really willing?” Tsukuyomi looked at Zhou Wen and asked in disbelief.

“Of course. If not, I wouldn’t have let you live,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh.

Although it was good to keep Tsukuyomi alive, it was difficult to predict what the bee would do to them next. If it was really as he thought, the bee’s target was the descendant embryo of him and Tsukuyomi, it would be troublesome.

“Alright, I’ll listen to you. If you don’t want me dead, I won’t die...” Tsukuyomi’s cheeks flushed as she said lovingly. At this moment, the two of them couldn’t hold on any longer. Zhou Wen’s knees were about to touch the ground, and the distance he was from the ground was only the height of a piece of paper.

Zhou Wen had already resigned himself to fate and gave up resisting. He planned to take things one step at a time to see what the bee was up to.

However, just as Zhou Wen gave up on resisting and his knee was about to touch the ground, a force erupted from his body, causing his knee to bounce up from the ground as he stood straight.

“Scram!” A voice sounded from Zhou Wen’s body. It sounded like it came from his mouth, but Zhou Wen’s mouth didn’t move.

Furthermore, that voice wasn’t a man’s voice, but a woman’s.

With the word “scram,” the bee that was playing the suona seemed to be struck by lightning as it suddenly flew backward. The suona in its claws fell out.

The dazzling Heavenly Happiness Token lost all its luster and fell from the sky, returning to its original stone form. Before Zhou Wen could react, he saw a shadow flash from his body. Demonic Neonate had rushed out of his body and caught the suona in the air. She held it to her mouth and puffed up her cheeks before blowing at the bee.

The loud suona music penetrated straight to the soul, causing everyone’s heads to buzz. It was as though their souls were about to be blown out of their bodies.

The bee was the first to bear the brunt of the attack. It became dizzy, and its body kept spinning in the air. It looked like it was losing consciousness.

Perhaps it was because Zhou Wen was Demonic Neonate’s master or perhaps Demonic Neonate had deliberately not allowed the suona’s sound to affect Zhou Wen, but regardless of the reason, Zhou Wen wasn’t affected. Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used the Demon Dragon King armor and borrowed the power of eight Companion Beasts. Then, he injected all his strength into the Golden Wyrm Scissors and snipped at the dizzy bee.

Although the bee was very powerful, it was only at the Heaven level. It hadn’t reached the Apocalypse grade and was affected by the suona’s music. It was already powerless to fight the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

Furthermore, the reason it was so strong was that the suona played a huge role. Without the suona, the bee was at most similar to the Companion Beast from before or even inferior.

Just as the bee’s fate was about to be sealed, it suddenly flapped its wings with all its might and transformed into a stream of light to escape, hoping to put up a final struggle. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Zhou Wen chased with the Golden Wyrm Scissors in hand. Now, he naturally couldn’t let the bee off.

However, to everyone’s surprise, the bee’s figure flashed and landed diagonally on Tsukuyomi. It hid behind her as though it was afraid and stole a glance at Demonic Neonate before stabbing its head into Tsukuyomi’s neck, turning into a Companion Beast tattoo.

Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi in a daze as Tsukuyomi’s gentle and shy expression gradually turned embarrassed.

As though realizing something, Tsukuyomi’s expression instantly changed to pleasant surprise. “Zhou Wen, you’re really amazing. This Companion Beast is afraid of you. It automatically contracted with me and became my Companion Beast. As expected of my husband...”

Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi and didn’t say

Xiao didn’t say anything and only gestured at Tsukuyomi with a thumbs up gesture. “We’ll be leaving now.” With that said, Xiao reached out and pulled Jiuyang. The two of them immediately vanished into the void. Only Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi were left on the dilapidated planet.

Zhou Wen finally understood why a smart woman like Tsukuyomi would choose such a dangerous planet as her residence and choose to absorb the Moon Essence Basin here.

Previously, Zhou Wen hadn’t thought too much about it. Now that he thought about it carefully, he immediately felt that there was definitely something fishy. Coupled with the fact that the bee had become Tsukuyomi’s Companion Beast at the critical moment of life and death, he was certain that Tsukuyomi had long known about the planet and had even begun setting up the whole thing. It was definitely not a coincidence that she had chosen to stay here to absorb the Moon Essence Basin.

Their eyes met and the atmosphere was a little awkward.

“Ahem, Zhou Wen, listen to my explanation...” Tsukuyomi looked into Zhou Wen’s eyes as her cheeks flushed red.

“There’s no need to explain. It’s good that you’re fine. I should return.” Zhou Wen wasn’t angry. Tsukuyomi didn’t harm him. Even if they had finished the nuptials at the end, it wouldn’t have been as dangerous as he imagined

Demonic Neonate held the suona and flew back to Zhou Wen’s side. She transformed back into a tattoo and even the suona vanished.
