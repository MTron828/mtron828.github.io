Chapter 549 Fated to be Beaten Up

“Coach, did you notice that Li Xuan’s bizarre armor seems a little strange?” Feng Qiuyan said as he stared at the carapace on Li Xuan.

“It’s indeed a little strange.” Zhou Wen had long discovered it.

Every time Li Xuan’s carapace was shattered and restored, it would become even more resilient. The monster caused less damage when smashing into his self-healing carapace.

Furthermore, this ability seemed to have no upper limit. It could be shattered repeatedly. Every self-recovery made it stronger. After a few consecutive rounds of self-recovery, the monster’s golden hoop could only cause him minimal damage.

Why is Li Xuan learning from Li Mobai? His Life Providence and Life Soul mean he’s born to be beaten up and injured. How can he become stronger without being beaten up? It’s a waste to learn from Li Mobai! Zhou Wen thought.

Li Xuan was clearly the first person to realize that there was something wrong with his Life Soul. This was because his Life Soul had been condensed under Li Mobai’s pressure. He had even absorbed Li Mobai’s Evil King Gu. Even he himself knew little about his Life Soul. He even believed Li Mobai’s words—his Life Soul was a failed Life Soul.

Indeed, his Life Soul was different from Li Mobai’s expectations, it did not have the Evil King Gu as its primary core; it only absorbed a portion of the Evil King Gu’s characteristics and formed its own Life Soul.

His Life Soul had parts of the Evil King Gu’s characteristics, but they were not completely the same.

Previously, Li Xuan blamed himself. He felt that he needed to mature as soon as possible and become the pillar of support for his family like Li Mobai. Therefore, he deliberately trained himself, hoping to be stronger than Li Mobai.

He wanted to surpass Li Mobai in all aspects, but in the end, he walked a path that was not suitable for him at all. He had been training his skills all this time, trying his best to avoid getting injured. Unbeknownst to him, his Life Soul only became stronger after being injured. He had taken a long detour for nothing.

It was only today that he discovered the secrets of his Life Soul after being injured continuously. He could not help but feel overjoyed.

“To seek victory in defeat, to rebuild a kingdom that belongs to you from ruins. Such strength is similar to a phoenix’s nirvana. It’s a very powerful Life Soul,” Feng Qiuyan said seriously.

Anyone who fought Li Xuan would be under immense pressure. If they couldn’t kill him in one fell swoop, he would become stronger the more they fought. In the end, the opponent might be the one to die.

Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan and felt that his Life Soul wasn’t just becoming strong from every shattering. Zhou Wen vaguely felt that every time the carapace shattered and healed, it would gain an additional sinister power.

The feeling was very strange. Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what it was, but he kept feeling that something was amiss. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Finally, Zhou Wen knew what was amiss. Li Xuan punched out and he realized that his punch was somewhat similar to a monster’s attack. The way he used it was very similar to the three-headed, six-armed monster.

However, if Zhou Wen didn’t remember wrongly, this move was likely the monster’s Essence Energy Skill. It wasn’t something that could be learned just from watching. One had to know the way to circulate Essence Energy.

Li Xuan definitely didn’t know such an Essence Energy Skill in the past. Now that he had used it, there was only one possibility—he had actually learned the three-headed, six-armed monster’s Essence Energy Skill while battling it.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall something. Li Mobai once said that his Life Soul was called Evil King Gu, a Life Soul formed from cultivating a secret Essence Energy Art from the South District.

Zhou Wen had once heard of some legends. South District’s Gu techniques placed many different kinds of poisonous worms and insects in a jar. They constantly hunted each other out of hunger, and the last poisonous worm to survive was a Gu. Not only was this Gu the strongest poisonous object, but it also possessed the ability to hunt and devour other poisonous worms.

Li Xuan’s Life Soul wasn’t only becoming stronger as it shattered, but it could also learn the enemy’s Essence Energy Skill in battle. It was very similar to the legends of Gu.

How much power has Li Xuan’s Life Soul inherited from Li Mobai’s Evil King Gu? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Li Xuan had already gained the upper hand. When the golden hoops struck him, there were no longer any cracks on the armor. All it could do was make Li Xuan retreat half a step.

Li Xuan no longer dodged the monster’s golden hoops. While they smashed on his body, his saber slashed at the monster’s body. The battle between the man and monster felt like a battle between two monsters.

Li Xuan was struck by the golden hoops and his injuries rapidly healed. As for the monster’s body, it couldn’t heal from the saber slashes. In this constant battle, the monster that was originally terrifying looked weaker and weaker. It even felt like it was trembling.

Ming Xiu watched with a complicated expression. He wondered if death was the only option if he couldn’t kill Li Xuan with his strike.

Feng Qiuyan frowned as he pondered. If he were to fight Li Xuan, how could he win? After thinking for a long time, there was only one solution. He had to kill him before he became stronger.

Ka-Cha!

Li Xuan’s strength had clearly increased by a lot. After countless slashes, he cut off one of the monster’s heads.

The monster seemed to be a little afraid as it turned around and ran, not daring to fight Li Xuan again.

“Trying to run after hitting me so many times? It’s too late!” Li Xuan refused to give up. With a flash, he chased after the monster like a phantom.

The monster was truly afraid. It didn’t dare turn back to fight Li Xuan. After Li Xuan caught up with it, it took him a few slashes to slice off the remaining two heads.

Seeing the monster collapse at Li Xuan’s feet, Zhou Wen walked over and asked Li Xuan, “Are you alright?”

He had a nagging feeling that Li Xuan’s Life Soul was a little too strange. It gave off a sinister feeling perhaps of the absorption of the Evil King Gu’s characteristics.

Li Xuan dispelled his Life Soul and revealed his body. He sighed softly and said, “From the looks of it, I won’t be able to be a gentleman like Li Mobai in this lifetime. After all, I’m just a foppish guy who doesn’t care about his life.”

“It’s good being foppish.” Zhou Wen laughed. Since Li Xuan could say that, it meant that he was really fine.

“Sigh, so I can be very strong just by casually practicing. I didn’t need to be so serious,” Li Xuan continued sighing.

“That’s a little overboard...” Zhou Wen was rendered speechless.

Just as Li Xuan was about to say something, the three-headed, six-armed monster’s body suddenly moved. It gave Zhou Wen and company a fright as they stared warily at the monster’s corpse. They saw a bright glow in its chest, as though a blob of golden magma was churning.

Boom!

The corpse suddenly exploded, and a golden object emerged from the corpse.

They took a careful look and realized that it was another dimensional creature. It was different from the three-headed, six-armed monster. It was very normal with only one head and a pair of arms.

However, its appearance was even more terrifying than the three-headed, six-armed monster. Its entire body seemed to be made of gold, and its body did not seem human. It had two horns on its head, and there was a row of bone spurs on its spine. Its fingers were like golden hooks. Standing at half the height of a person, its body was burning with golden light.

With a wave of its hand, the six golden hoops that landed on the ground automatically flew over and covered its limbs and neck. The remaining golden hoop landed in its hand.

The golden hoops shrank automatically and became the size of a bracelet and a choker. Only the golden hoop in its hand remained the same size.
