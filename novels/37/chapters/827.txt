Chapter 828: Cupid’s Gift

Translator: CKtalon

Liu Yun led Ya’er out of Luoyang and rode an eagle into the forest. Even if An Tianzuo personally gave the order to capture him, it was probably too late.

“Hehe, little girl, with you in my hands, I’m not afraid that bastard Zhou Wen won’t come to Mount Dragon Tiger.” Liu Yun glanced at Ya’er who was sitting beside him.

Ordinary children would cry from fright if they encountered such a situation. Yet, to his surprise, there was no expression on Ya’er’s face. It was as though nothing had happened. She was no different from before. She sat obediently on the eagle’s back. She wasn’t afraid of heights either.

Is she an idiot? Liu Yun felt that there was definitely something wrong with Ya’er’s brain.

How can a normal child be so calm? Not to mention a one-year-old child, even an eleven or twelve-year-old child would probably cry from fright.

“Come, give me the necklace. I’ll change it for you.” Seeing that Ya’er was a little silly, Liu Yun wasn’t in the mood to say anything to her. He reached out and wanted to take the necklace from her neck.

This necklace was extraordinary. It was a treasure of the Cape family. Although it wasn’t a dimensional item, it was very famous before the dimensional storms.

This necklace was known as Cupid’s Gift. Before the dimensional storms, the queens of several countries had worn it. It was a priceless treasure.

However, this necklace had another name. It was called “Widow Queen.” In the beginning, this necklace was a gift from a king to his queen. The king expressed his love for the queen and searched for the best ruby back then. After the forging and setting was done by a master artisan, Cupid’s Gift was created.

However, who knew that good times wouldn’t last long. Not long after giving away the necklace, the king died from illness, and the queen became a regent queen.

Later, the necklace switched hands a few more times. Many of its owners were queens, and they all lost their husbands.

When Liu Yun went to the Cape family to steal something, he accidentally discovered Cupid’s Gift and stole it.

Although this item wasn’t a dimensional item, many women liked it, especially those who were rich, powerful, and married. Many were willing to buy it at a high price.

Liu Yun knew that there was a rich lady of a local family who had been looking for this necklace for a long time. If he took it to her, he could exchange it for many resources.

Liu Yun originally planned on auctioning this necklace in the future, so he naturally couldn’t really give it to Ya’er.

When Liu Yun tried to take the necklace off, Ya’er naturally refused and retreated.

However, they were now sitting on the eagle’s back. Once Ya’er retreated, her body would fall.

Liu Yun hurriedly pulled her back, preventing her from falling.

Forget it. You can wear it for now, Liu Yun thought to himself. After all, Ya’er was in his hands and she couldn’t escape. It wouldn’t be too late to take it back when she was sick of wearing it. There was no need to force her to take it off.

Zhou Wen, that bastard. You made me suffer so much the last time. I’ll teach you a lesson this time. Liu Yun had been planning this for a long time. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He had disguised himself as a student and sneaked into Sunset College. He had even joined the Xuanwen Club to think of a way to get Zhou Wen to Mount Dragon Tiger.

The Earth Elemental Beast was being auctioned at the Zhang family’s Mount Dragon Tiger. Liu Yun was also very interested in the Earth Elemental Beast, but he naturally wouldn’t use money to bid for it. He wanted to steal it before the auction.

Liu Yun had already made an attempt before, but ever since he had stolen from the Zhang family, the Zhang family had implemented measures against him. They nearly captured him alive.

Liu Yun knew that it wouldn’t be easy for him to steal the Earth Elemental Beast, so he planned on finding someone to help him. Therefore, he thought of Zhou Wen and planned on using Ya’er to force him to steal it.

That bastard caused me so much trouble the last time. I can’t let him have it easy this time. I’ll let him do all the dirty work. In the end, after I take the Earth Elemental Beast, I’ll disavow him... Liu Yun couldn’t help but laugh out loud when he thought of the smug look he would be wearing.

“Haha... Haha... Haha... Haha...” Liu Yun laughed heartily, but as he laughed, his expression turned ugly.

This was because he realized that he couldn’t stop laughing.

“I... Haha... I... Haha... What’s going on... Haha... What’s going on... Haha...” Liu Yun couldn’t stop laughing. His mouth was about to deform from laughing, but he couldn’t stop.

He covered his mouth with his hand, but he couldn’t stop himself from laughing. Instead, he looked even more wretched as though he was secretly laughing.

After a while, Liu Yun finally stopped laughing.

What’s going on? Could it be that Zhou Wen has something up his sleeve? He knows that I stole Ya’er, so he’s messing with me? Liu Yun checked his body but didn’t discover any curse-like powers.

There’s no curse. Could it be that I’m too happy? Liu Yun’s ring didn’t react so he couldn’t help but be puzzled.

Ever since he had succumbed to Zhou Wen’s move, Liu Yun had thought of many solutions to prevent himself from being cursed. He had obtained many Companion Beasts to resolve this problem, and this purification ring was one of them.

Although the purification ring couldn’t remove all curses, it would react if he suffered from one. It was very convenient to use it to detect curses.

Now that the purification ring didn’t react, it meant that Liu Yun wasn’t cursed.

Liu Yun carefully checked his body again and didn’t find any problems. He had stopped laughing.

From the looks of it, it might be because I was too happy just now. Liu Yun thought for a moment and felt that it was plausible. He had seen people who couldn’t stop laughing.

“Hungry,” Ya’er suddenly said some time into the flight.

“So you can speak?” Liu Yun looked at Ya’er in surprise.

However, Ya’er didn’t say anything else. She only looked at Liu Yun.

“Alright, I’ll take you to eat when we reach the city ahead.” Liu Yun controlled the giant eagle and flew towards a nearby city.

After arriving in the city, Liu Yun took Ya’er window shopping.

Ya’er stopped in front of a dessert shop and pointed inside, indicating her desire to eat some desserts.

However, Liu Yun curled his lips and said, “What’s so good about these non-nutritious things? Furthermore, as a godly thief, how can I pay for food? I’ll let you have a free meal.”

Ya’er followed Liu Yun expressionlessly. This was what Liu Yun was most satisfied with. Although Ya’er was a little strange, she didn’t cry or make a fuss. It saved Liu Yun trouble.

After walking for a while, Liu Yun brought Ya’er to a hotel. The hotel looked rather high-end and was very lively.

However, there was one thing. At the entrance of the hotel, there were many flower wreaths and couplets. It was as if someone had died and they were having a funeral.
