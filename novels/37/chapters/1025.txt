Chapter 1026: Time’s Up

“Companion Beasts? Aren’t dimensional creatures unable to use Companion Beasts? Why do they need them?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

“Who told you that dimensional creatures can’t use Companion Beasts?” The masked man curled his lips and said, “They just can’t use Earth’s Companion Beasts. In dimensional zones, there are many powerful Companion Beasts, but they are just a little different from Earth’s Companion Beasts. Furthermore, they are far stronger than Earth’s Companion Beasts.”

“Since dimensional Companion Beasts are stronger than Earth’s Companion Beasts, why are they searching for a Companion Beast on Earth?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled.

“This world is unique so no dimensional creature can understand it.” The masked man pondered for a moment before continuing, “In any dimension, creating something out of nothing is impossible. Even in theory, it’s impossible to do such a thing. However, humans have done it on Earth.”

“Humans can create something out of nothing? Why don’t I know?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment. There didn’t seem to be such powerful technology on Earth.

“Yes, every human can do it.” The masked man smiled at Zhou Wen. “You can do it too.”

“What’s that?” Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out how he could make something out of nothing.

The masked man raised a hand and pressed it against his head with his finger. “It’s the imagination of the brain. In the dimension, there’s no such thing as ghosts and gods. Only Earth has those imaginary entities. Isn’t that creating something out of nothing? What’s even stranger is that the ghosts and gods in human imagination can actually result in the appearance of the corresponding creatures in the dimension. It is a mystery that has yet to be explained.”

“The saying of ghosts and gods originated from humans’ fear of nature. It’s just that humans have a richer imagination. Perhaps it doesn’t mean anything. Or perhaps, it’s the dimensional creatures that descended to Earth in the past. Humans saw them and treated them as ghosts and gods, so they had their legends. It’s not strange to find the corresponding creatures in a dimension,” Zhou Wen said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“No, that’s not the case. In fact, you don’t know that outside this world, there’s another area between this world and the dimension. That area gives birth to many dimensional creatures. The dimensional creatures in Earth’s dimensional zones come from there, not from the dimension.”

The masked man continued, “What’s even stranger is that some powerful dimensional creatures once spent a lot of energy and effort to study the region where dimensional creatures were born. They discovered something very strange.”

“What was that?” Zhou Wen naturally knew of such a place. Not only did he know about it, but he had also been there.

“The dimensional creatures born there are highly compatible with the creatures you humans imagine. Furthermore, the dimensional creatures that originally didn’t exist there were actually born there after you humans used your imagination to create them.”

“How are you sure that dimensional creatures were born after humans used their imagination to create them? Perhaps humans have long imagined them, but you didn’t discover them in the past.” Zhou Wen attempted an analysis.

“This isn’t difficult to prove. This is because a thousand years ago, humans didn’t have firearms, and the dimensional creatures born in that area didn’t have firearms. When something like a pistol appeared among you humans, dimensional creatures were actually produced that wielded pistol-like weapons. Although there were very few of them and they were very rare, this is a concrete fact.”

“Really?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

“I don’t know if there are many instances of this in the modern world, but before I fell asleep, such a situation had already happened.” The masked man continued, “There are still many strange things about Earth. For example, even powerful existences at the Apocalypse grade will have their strength weakened to the level of ordinary Mythical creatures when they descend upon this world. Another example is that only human bodies can break through to a level above the Terror grade in this world. These are all very unscientific. In theory, this world is a low-level world relative to the dimension. Low-level creatures have no way of limiting high-level creatures. Even if they can’t withstand the descent of high-level creatures, they can only be destroyed by high-level forces, not restrict high-level creatures. However, until I fell asleep, no expert has been able to break the rules of this world. What does that say?”

“It means that Earth isn’t a low-level world? It could be higher than the dimension?” Zhou Wen asked.

“That’s right. The dimensional experts also had such considerations, but if this world is a high-level world, there will definitely be high-level lifeforms. However, there aren’t such lifeforms on Earth. And other than Earth, there aren’t any lifeforms on other planets. Therefore, those big shots want to find the answer.” The masked man revealed a strange smile.

The smile sent a chill down Zhou Wen’s spine as he had an ominous feeling.

“Have they found the answer?” Zhou Wen asked nervously.

“Almost. According to their speculations, this world might give birth to a very powerful Companion Beast. As for you humans and the other dimensional creatures, you are just companion creatures of that Companion Beast,” the masked man said with a smile.

When Zhou Wen heard that, he frowned and asked, “Why would it be giving birth to a Companion Beast instead of a dimensional creatures”

“I don’t know about that. You have to ask the big shots of the dimension. These ideas were speculated by them. Furthermore, they guessed that once the Companion Beast appeared, this world would be destroyed,” the masked man continued.

“Why?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled.

“I don’t know either, because I only heard the news, but didn’t know their inference process. However, this matter has already reached the consensus of the various races in the dimension. They are vying for control of this place because they want to find that Companion Beast and take it for themselves. Once that Companion Beast is found, this world will be doomed.” The masked man looked up into the sky and said, “Times up. You should be on your way. I hope you had a good time before you died. After all, I don’t wish for this body I’m using to have any unpleasant memories.”

“What do you mean time’s up?” Zhou Wen asked the masked man.

“Time of death.” The masked man didn’t look at Zhou Wen. He continued looking up at the sky at a 45-degree angle, waiting for the moment Zhou Wen died.

However, as time ticked by, Zhou Wen remained standing there without any changes. He didn’t show any signs of dying. As for the masked man, his neck seemed to ache as his expression stiffened.
