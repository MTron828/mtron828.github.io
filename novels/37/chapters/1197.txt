Chapter 1198: Asura Realm

“Pui! Pui! Pui!” The antelope shouted as it spat out three mouthfuls of blood. The three mouthfuls of blood bloomed into three blood flowers that rose up and shielded their heads.

Boom!

The terrifying brilliance collided with the three blood flowers, producing a terrifying shockwave that sent the antelope, Zhou Wen, and company flying.

The antelope’s majestic body was already covered in blood patterns as its vertical eye surged with blood.

It transformed into a sanguine beam in midair and carried Zhou Wen and Ya’er out of Mount Meru, heading straight for the exit of the Deva Realm.

Only then did the three blood flowers shatter. The brilliance continued chasing after the antelope and company, and just as it was about to catch up, the antelope had already rushed to the entrance of the Deva Realm and leaped out.

However, the brilliance couldn’t leave the Deva Realm; it couldn’t chase after them.

The antelope landed on the ground and its forelimbs went limp as it collapsed. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Zhou Wen landed on the ground and hurriedly turned to look at the antelope. He saw that it had already gotten up. The vertical eye on its forehead had vanished, but there was a bloody mark between its brows. Its body had returned to its normal antelope form.

Even so, its body was still stained with blood, and blood was still seeping from the corner of its mouth.

After spitting out a mouthful of blood, the antelope cursed, “That bastard on Mount Meru made me lose a bet. When I recover, I’ll definitely storm my way up Mount Meru and capture those turtles and let some blood spill.”

Zhou Wen looked at the antelope in shock. Its appearance overturned his former impression of it.

This fellow used to be lazy and ignored anyone while sprawled on the sofa. Furthermore, it didn’t speak at all. Occasionally, he would write a few words with its hooves, looking aloof.

But now, the antelope was like a hooligan. It kept spewing out vulgarities.

“Um, do you need me to treat you?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the antelope’s body.

“Even Mount Laojun’s Nine Revolutions Golden Pill can’t treat my injuries. Can you treat it?” The antelope was clearly in a bad mood. It glared at Zhou Wen and spat in the direction of the Deva Realm’s door. “Pui.”

“You mentioned a bet. What bet was it?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

The antelope rolled its eyes unhappily. “It’s none of your business. Stay out of it.”

After a pause, the antelope asked, “How’s Chick? Did it eat the third Mustard Fruit?”

Zhou Wen looked inside the Chaos Bead. He also wanted to know how Chick was.

However, his expression immediately changed from the scene he saw. He scanned the Chaos Bead several times, but he didn’t find Chick.

“Holy sh*t, Chick is missing. Don’t tell me it’s still in the Deva Realm?” Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed.

The antelope was very calm and after some thought it asked, “Is the third Mustard Fruit still there?”

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he somewhat understood the antelope’s intentions. He hurriedly looked into the Chaos Bead and realized that the Mustard Fruit was indeed gone.

“The Mustard Fruit is gone,” Zhou Wen said.

“Then it’s fine. After some time, Chick will naturally complete its evolution and return... Ugh...” As the antelope spoke, it suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. Its body staggered and it nearly fell. It looked like it had suffered serious injuries.

“I have a Dragon Tiger Pill Essence here. It has a resurrective effect. Take a look and see if it’s of any use.” Seeing that the antelope’s situation was terrible, Zhou Wen summoned the Mythical Dragon Tiger Pill Essence.

If it wasn’t for the antelope going all out, they probably wouldn’t have made it out alive. Although the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence was rare, there was still a chance of it dropping in the future. In such a dangerous place, having the antelope with such combat strength was far more useful than a pill essence.

“That low-grade item is useless to me. Keep it for yourself.” The antelope glanced at the door of the Asura Realm and continued, “The person you are looking for is probably in the Asura Realm. If you want to go, be careful. I’m injured, so I won’t join you in the fun.”

The antelope was straightforward. With that said, it turned around and walked towards the Bridge of Helplessness to leave the strange six realms of rebirth and existence.

As it walked, it cursed. “What a huge loss. Sooner or later, I’ll skin those b*stards and hang them on a flagpole and use them as lanterns...”

As Zhou Wen watched the antelope walk onto the Bridge of Helplessness, a thought suddenly flashed across his mind. Could it be that this fellow’s bet was to not speak?

Without any time to think, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and turned to walk towards the door of Asura Realm. Since Ouyang Lan and company weren’t in Deva Realm, the most likely possibility was the Asura Realm.

The Asura Realm was fiendish, so it wasn’t safer than the Deva Realm. It might even be more dangerous.

Since there were Calamity-grade existences in the Deva Realm, it was definitely the same for the Asura Realm. Zhou Wen only hoped that An Sheng and company were fine.

Taking a deep breath, Zhou Wen walked into the Asura Realm.

The moment he entered, Zhou Wen was immediately given a fright. He saw a cold saber cleave down, almost hitting his face.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen was prepared. The Asura Saber in his hand blocked the saber in front of him.

Crack!

The Asura Saber was transformed from Deva Asura. How could an ordinary weapon compare to a Terror-grade weapon? When the blade touched the Asura Saber, it immediately snapped into two.

The Asura Saber didn’t stop there as it split the saber-wielding figure into two.

Only then did Zhou Wen identify the creature slashing at him—a humanoid creature wearing a ghoul mask. It bared its muscular upper body and revealed a strange bird tattoo on its back.

The strange bird symbol occupied almost all of his entire back and left shoulder. It looked like a peacock, but it was blood-red.

As for his lower body, he was wearing a black feathered piece of clothing that resembled a skirt and pants. It was difficult to tell what it was.

“Kill!” A tsunami-like battle cry sounded, causing Zhou Wen’s eardrums to buzz.

Looking ahead, there were creatures everywhere on the dilapidated land that resembled an ancient battlefield. They held long sabers and their eyes were filled with killing intent as they swept toward Zhou Wen like a tidal wave.

Zhou Wen brandished the Asura Saber and instantly killed countless nearby creatures, but the other creatures continued charging forward fearlessly.

Zhou Wen slew the aggressors as he advanced, hoping to find An Sheng and company. However, before long, he discovered a problem.

The creatures he had killed came to life again. Even if their bodies were diced up, they could automatically reconnect. In the blink of an eye, they were no longer injured as they continued their charge.

Strange? The Deva Asura is a Terror-grade saber. It can slay even Mythical, much less these creatures who don’t even have combat strength at the Mythical stage. Yet, they are completely fine. Something’s amiss. Zhou Wen realized the problem as he rushed forward.

An Sheng and company would probably be in trouble if they were entangled by these undying and indestructible monsters. Zhou Wen’s number one desire was to find them quickly.

With his previous experience, Zhou Wen didn’t teleport. All he did was constantly charge across the land. With the Asura Saber in hand, the tidal-like creatures couldn’t stop him.
