Chapter 1012: One in 54

Translator: CKtalon

Choosing black is death, but so is choosing white. I can’t kill the witches either. How can I survive? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Of course, he could just make no choice. With Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification and Heaven-Opening Scripture, he might be able to forcefully break through and kill the black-and-white Destiny Witches.

However, if Zhou Wen were to enter the Maze of Lies with Lance and company in the future, it was best to understand the various abilities of the black-and-white Destiny Witches. If anything happened, he could figure out how to deal with it.

In fact, Zhou Wen’s main goal for grinding wasn’t to clear the dungeon, but to figure out all the information regarding Sunday’s dungeon to prevent any accidents from happening in real life.

After entering the game again, Zhou Wen went in front of the witches. This time, Zhou Wen wanted to see if he could draw a few more cards, but it was useless. After he drew the first white poker card, the other cards would vanish into thin air when he attempted touching them.

Zhou Wen flipped the cards over and saw that there was still a black silhouette on the white poker card. However, this time, it wasn’t Death, but a black heart. Furthermore, the middle of the heart had cracked.

After seeing it, Zhou Wen felt the heart in his chest rupture before the game screen went black.

“Do you have any cards that allow for survival?” Zhou Wen asked the two witches when he came in front of them again.

“Yes,” the two witches answered in unison.

“How many cards are there in total? How many allow for survival?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“There are 54 cards in each deck. There are 108 cards in total,” the black-robed witch said.

“Every deck has a card that allows survival. Your chances are still very high,” the white-robed witch said immediately.

Zhou Wen’s face immediately darkened. In other words, I only have a one in fifty-four chance of drawing a card for survival?

“In theory, but you can try a few more times. The success rate will naturally be higher,” the two witches said together.

“Try my ass. If it was in real life, I would have died a long time ago. How would I have the chance to try again?” Zhou Wen felt that there was definitely some trick to drawing the cards. Otherwise, it would be too difficult to get what he needed with luck.

Luck... Wait... Could it be that to kill the Destiny Witches, one needs someone with a Luck-type skill, like Wang Lu? Zhou Wen thought of Wang Lu, whose luck was virtually invincible. If she were to draw, she would definitely be able to draw the card that meant survival.

If I need luck, I definitely won’t be able to draw it. Zhou Wen tried using Truth Listener’s ability to listen to the cards and used Doctor Darkness’s Light of Penetration, but it was useless.

The cards he saw and heard were blank. He had no idea what the cards were showing.

He thought of all sorts of ways to cheat, but all of them were useless. If he wanted to clear this obstacle, he had to invite Wang Lu over. Otherwise, he could only use force.

This time, Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener and activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder before drawing his card.

However, the first card was an angel. Zhou Wen immediately felt the Truth Listener earring heat up before large amounts of Essence Energy surged into his body.

Although the angel shadow appeared, it failed to take the blood-colored avatar’s soul into Heaven.

Seeing that Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification was effective, Zhou Wen continued drawing cards. He drew them one by one. The Truth Listener earring kept heating up as Essence Energy surged into him like waves.

Zhou Wen knew that if it wasn’t for Truth Listener’s ability, he would have died countless times.

When he drew the 37th card, Zhou Wen pulled out a black mask from the white card. This time, the Truth Listener earring didn’t heat up, nor did it produce Essence Energy.

At the same time, the wall behind the black-and-white Destiny Witches parted. It was the door that led to the back of the Maze of Lies.

In the previous Monday to Saturday instance dungeons, Witch Castle was the end. There was no such door, so Zhou Wen didn’t know what was behind the door.

The black-and-white witches looked at Zhou Wen from the side without any intention of attacking. From the looks of it, they were rather special dimensional creatures and had no intention of fighting him to the death.

Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to walk out the door and leave Destiny Witch Castle.

After walking past the door, Zhou Wen immediately saw a garden. In the middle of the garden was a strange tree.

Zhou Wen felt that the tree looked somewhat similar to the Dead Man Tree and the Longevity Tree, but there were some differences.

At the very least, there were no fruits on the tree. Beneath it, an elder sat with his back against the tree. His clothes were tattered, and from the holes, one could see his skin and bones. However, his chest was still heaving slightly. He didn’t look dead.

As though he heard the blood-colored avatar’s footsteps, the elder opened his eyes. His eyes were deep and looked extremely turbid.

“Young man, it’s great to finally meet you. I don’t have to die with that huge secret...” the elder said weakly.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen drew his sword and slashed.

Who was he kidding? This was a game, not reality. It was impossible for a human to exist in-game. No matter how much the elder looked like a human, Zhou Wen was certain that he wasn’t human.

Just as the Bronze Sparrow Sword was about to strike, the zombie-like elder suddenly released a terrifying force. He leaped up and charged into the sky at an unbelievable speed, dodging Zhou Wen’s strike.

As for the elder, his body had already changed in midair. He transformed into Zhou Wen and charged at him. His movement technique was extremely strange.

Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to fight him. He summoned his Mythical lineup and surrounded it.

In the next second, the monster that had transformed into Zhou Wen emitted a white fog before transforming into the Great Might Vajra Bull. When the two bulls stood together, it was impossible to tell which was real and which was fake.

Unfortunately, the Great Might Vajra Bull was Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast. It was telepathically connected to Zhou Wen, so he could naturally tell which was real or fake.

No matter how the dimensional creature changed, it was still quickly beaten to death.

‘Killed Mythical creature, Shapeshifting Beast. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’

Zhou Wen glanced at the crystal and was immediately disappointed when he realized that it was only an ordinary stat crystal.

Although there are many Mythical creatures in the Maze of Lies on Sunday, the drop rate isn’t very high. Zhou Wen thought carefully and realized that he had only killed two Mythical creatures. One was a Devil Clown and the other was a Shapeshifting Beast. It couldn’t be considered a lot.

There was only one Shapeshifting Beast in the entire garden. There were no other dimensional creatures, nor was there any other way out. Zhou Wen glanced at the tree and had no choice but to return via the same path. He then returned, through Witch Castle, to the maze that resembled an amusement park and continued exploring.
