Chapter 1206: Alive

It works! Zhou Wen was delighted.

Unfortunately, the Asura quickly recovered from the dent produced by the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power. This left Zhou Wen somewhat vexed.

The power of the Primordial Human Sovereign gave Zhou Wen the ability to heal. No matter how badly he beat his opponent or how serious the damage was, they would ultimately recover.

This was because the usage of the Primordial Human Sovereign’s power to beat someone was actually saving them.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that since there were traces of death powers in the Asura’s body, the power of Human Sovereign might possess true lethality.

From the looks of it, Zhou Wen was overthinking things.

Could it be that the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra really doesn’t have any lethality? Zhou Wen had thought of this problem back when he was trapped, but he failed to come up with an answer.

In fact, the Ancient Sovereign Sutra wasn’t necessarily without lethality. It was just that Zhou Wen’s own insights and advancement direction had made the Ancient Sovereign Sutra lean towards this aspect. This eventually led him to condensing a strange Life Soul like the Primordial Human Sovereign.

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the Asura lunged forward again. Fortunately, it was blocked by Great Brahma.

Zhou Wen stood on Great Brahma’s head. No matter how the Asura attacked, Great Brahma could withstand his attacks. Even if Zhou Wen stood there in a daze, he wouldn’t be injured at all.

As Zhou Wen thought about it, he put theory into practice. From time to time, he would throw a punch at Asura. The Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power grew stronger, making Zhou Wen feel as though he was about to turn into light. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra remained the same. It didn’t have any true destructive power. The wounds that were inflicted healed in a short while.

Furthermore, the power of the Mythical Ancient Sovereign Sutra couldn’t really harm the Asura.

Zhou Wen kept pursuing lethality, but he realized that it was counterproductive. Not only did the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s power undergo Terror transformation, but it also weakened. The marks left on the Wheel of Destiny became shallower and shallower.

Realization dawned on Zhou Wen. He knew that he had been too stubborn. Some things couldn’t be forced.

After giving up on forcefully changing the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s characteristics, Zhou Wen restarted his deductions on the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. He engraved all his thoughts and insights into the Wheel of Destiny.

The sovereign forged from blood and fire led humanity to defy the heavens and seek the true meaning of life.

This was Zhou Wen’s previous understanding of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, but being trapped for a hundred years had given him a deeper understanding of life.

Even if Zhou Wen didn’t deliberately think about it, he inevitably thought of this problem during his time in imprisonment.

What was life? In the past, Zhou Wen felt that as long as one was alive, it was life. However, after a hundred years of imprisonment, Zhou Wen realized that life wasn’t as simple as being alive.

Living happily, living in sorrow, living while traveling the world and taking in the world’s scenery—even lying in bed like a vegetable was living.

There were many ways of living. Ten thousand people had ten thousand ways to live, but which way was meaningful?

Different people might have different answers. Such questions might crop up in a person’s extreme boredom. Zhou Wen would occasionally have such thoughts and had seriously considered this question, but he hadn’t obtained a final answer.

From Zhou Wen’s point of view, there was no such thing as a better, more outstanding way to live. Some people were very happy just lying there under the sun, eating peanuts and drinking a bottle of beer. Some people put in all their efforts and only achieved happiness when they obtained higher achievements and status.

In fact, there was no right or wrong. As long as one could make themselves feel happy, they would be living their dream.

Such an understanding didn’t allow the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to advance to the Terror grade. Therefore, Zhou Wen knew that he hadn’t grasped the core.

What kind of life does the Ancient Sovereign Sutra pursue? Longevity? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he felt that this wasn’t the answer.

Qi Refinement Warriors pursued immortality, but not the Ancient Sovereign. From the beginning, the Ancient Sovereign only wanted survival.

If the conditions for survival are satisfied, what should I do next? Zhou Wen planned on considering the problem from a different angle.

An Sheng and company watched Zhou Wen fight Asura. Although they couldn’t see the Terror-form Asura and Great Brahma, they could see the shockwaves produced by their battle.

From their point of view, Zhou Wen floated in the air and spent most of his time thinking. He would occasionally deliver a punch, but even if he stood there motionless, the Terror-grade Asura failed to injure him at all. The terrifying shockwaves shattered everything nearby.

“Madam, Young Master Wen’s strength is probably not inferior to Overseer’s,” an officer who had been rescued said to Ouyang Lan.

“My sons naturally won’t be bad,” Ouyang Lan said matter-of-factly.

An Sheng also nodded and said, “Young Master Wen is extremely talented. His future achievements will definitely not be limited to this. In the future, with Overseer and Young Master Wen presiding over Luoyang, it will definitely be as stable as a mountain.”

The other officers felt something amiss when they heard that.

As the saying went, a mountain couldn’t accommodate two tigers. In the past, they felt that any genius was an underling in front of An Tianzuo. There was always a main and a support, so there was naturally no need to worry about the two tigers fighting.

However, the ability Zhou Wen displayed made them worry. What if Overseer can’t suppress Zhou Wen? Will Luoyang become a battle between dragons and tigers in the future?

Experiences from the ancients and cruel reality told them that such things were too common. They naturally couldn’t help but worry.

However, Ouyang Lan and An Sheng didn’t have such concerns. This was because they knew that Zhou Wen’s ambition wasn’t that small. At the very least, Luoyang wasn’t enough.

At that moment, the light on Zhou Wen’s body stopped growing stronger. Instead, it gradually dimmed.

The Primordial Human Sovereign was still fusing with him, but the sun-like glow was converging as though Zhou Wen was degenerating from a god to a mortal.

However, Zhou Wen’s aura didn’t weaken as a result. Instead, it grew stronger.

A thousand people have a thousand ways of survival. With my intelligence, I’m unable to tell which way of survival is the correct one. However, I’m certain of one thing. The form of living I want depends on age. The things done at different ages should be things done at that age. At the age of five, I wanted an ordinary plush toy. That would be my greatest joy, but I failed to obtain it back then. This was because the money my father left me was only enough for my daily meals. If I used the money to buy a toy, I would starve for a week. Therefore, I chose to give up on the toy.

At this point, it’s easy for me to buy thousands of toys, but that happiness, that desire back then, can never be retrieved again. Zhou Wen closed his eyes as the past surfaced in his mind like a movie.
