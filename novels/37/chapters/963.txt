Chapter 964: Seven Seas Dragon King

“That’s right,” said the dragon queen as she nodded at the stone token.

“If that’s the case, it’s very simple. I can give it to your sister’s fiancé. That way, they can be legitimate,” Zhou Wen said.

“The Heavenly Happiness Token has already bound you. What’s the point of giving it to him?” The dragon queen snorted coldly.

Holy sh*t, why did Emperor of Shang give me such a token? I really don’t want to get married. Zhou Wen was filled with regret. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have wanted the token.

However, on second thought, Feng Qiuyan’s fiancée was indeed not human. At the very least, she wasn’t a pure human. What Feng Qiuyan saw when he was young probably wasn’t wrong.

“Your Majesty, actually, it doesn’t matter if there’s a token. I think your sister and my schoolmate, Feng Qiuyan, are truly in love. Why do you have to separate them?” Zhou Wen wanted to use words to move the dragon queen.

On careful thought, this dragon queen was considered Feng Qiuyan’s sister-in-law. They would all be family in the future, so fighting her wasn’t a good idea.

“Without the Heavenly Happiness Token, whatever you say is useless. If we can’t use the Heavenly Happiness Token to reverse her fate and break the taboo, she can only become the concubine of the Seven Seas Dragon King,” said the dragon queen.

“What Seven Seas Dragon King?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled when he heard that. He had only heard of the Four Seas Dragon King. What the hell was the Seven Seas Dragon King? Why would Qin Ling become his concubine?

Since the dragon queen needed Zhou Wen’s help, she had no choice but to patiently explain, “This sea is called the Seven Dragons Sea. In fact, it’s a huge dimensional zone. The Sea God Reef is only a tiny dimensional zone in it. In every dimensional zone like the Sea God Reef, there’s a dragon monarch. However, the supreme ruler of the Seven Dragons Sea is the Seven Seas Dragon King. He’s the supreme existence that rules over everything in the Seven Dragons Sea.”

After explaining everything, Zhou Wen finally had a clearer understanding of the entire matter.

Dragons were extremely lascivious by nature. In fact, the seven dragon monarch domains in the Seven Dragons Sea were the harem bases of the Seven Seas Dragon King. Once a new female dragon was born, they would be added to the Seven Seas Dragon King’s harem.

The dragon queen’s father was the Dragon King of the Sea God Reef, and her mother was also a dragon. As the Seven Seas Dragon King wanted her mother for his own, the old Dragon King of the Sea God Reef fought the Seven Seas Dragon King and was ultimately killed by him.

Her mother was also severely injured in that battle and was saved by a human. Later on, for some reason, her mother and that human had Qin Ling before she passed away.

The Seven Seas Dragon King didn’t kill them all and made the dragon queen the dragon monarch of the Sea God Reef. However, the Seven Seas Dragon King didn’t do it out of goodwill. He was waiting for the dragon queen and Qin Ling to grow up. Once they grew up, they had to become Seven Seas Dragon King concubines.

“Have you never thought of killing the Seven Seas Dragon King?” Zhou Wen asked.

“The Seven Seas Dragon King is a Terror-grade existence. Even if the seven dragon monarchs join forces, they are no match for him,” the dragon queen said indifferently.

Terror-grade? Zhou Wen felt his head ache when he heard that. Banana Fairy’s evolution hadn’t been completed, so he didn’t have a good solution to deal with Terror-grade existences.

“Can’t you escape inland with your sister? The world is so huge. It’s impossible for the Seven Seas Dragon King to find you, right?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

The dragon queen nodded and said, “I think so too. However, we are limited by the dimensional zones. It’s impossible for us to leave the sea. I can’t even leave the dimensional zone. My sister’s partial human bloodline allows her to leave the dimensional zone, but she can’t be too far from the sea. Unless...”

With that said, the dragon queen didn’t continue as she looked at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen immediately understood what she meant and said, “The Heavenly Happiness Token on me can remove the dimensional zones’ restrictions on her, right?”

“That’s right. That’s why the person she marries can only be you. She can use the Heavenly Happiness Token’s power to escape the dimensional zone’s restrictions on her,” the dragon queen said. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I only have one Heavenly Happiness Token. Even if I can save Qin Ling, I can’t save you, right?”

“I’ll handle my own matters. You just need to marry Qin Ling and take her inland,” the dragon queen said.

“Impossible.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

“If you don’t do it, you’ll die,” the dragon queen said with a cold expression.

Zhou Wen looked at the dragon queen and continued, “It would be okay if I didn’t know about this, but now that I do, I’ll feel terrible if I watch the tragedy happen to you and your sister without doing anything. If you are willing, please let me help you kill the Seven Seas Dragon King and save your sister and the entire Seven Dragons Sea.”

Zhou Wen thought to himself that this might be a good opportunity. He might be able to obtain immense benefits while the Seven Dragons Sea was in chaos.

The dragon queen looked at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at a fool. “Do you know what a Terror-grade existence is? It’s an existence that can kill you thousands of times with one finger.”

“Actually, I’ve seen a few of them. They aren’t as terrifying as you make them out to be. If you believe me, give me some more time and I’ll definitely be able to save you.” Zhou Wen thought about how he could convince the dragon queen to become his spy in the Seven Dragons Sea.

“Forget about giving you more time; it’s impossible for a human like you to defeat the Seven Seas Dragon King. Besides, there’s no time. According to the dragons’ standards, Qin Ling will be an adult in six months,” said the dragon queen.

“What about you?” Zhou Wen asked the dragon queen.

“Less than a month.” The dragon queen hesitated for a moment before answering Zhou Wen’s question.

“Less than a month?” Zhou Wen pondered.

It was clearly very difficult to advance to the Terror stage. Zhou Wen didn’t know if Banana Fairy could complete her advancement in a month.

“Stop dreaming. There’s only one path for you now. Marry Qin Ling and take her inland so that the Seven Seas Dragon King can never find her,” the dragon queen said.

“If I want to take anyone away, you should be the one taken away.” Zhou Wen meant that Qin Ling still had six months, while the dragon queen only had a month left. He naturally had to rescue her first. They could still stall for time for Qin Ling to think of a solution.

However, these words sounded different to the dragon queen. She looked at Zhou Wen in a daze.

Zhou Wen didn’t think there was anything wrong with his words, nor did he notice the dragon queen’s abnormality. He was now thinking that this might be a huge opportunity.

It was very difficult to kill a Terror-grade dimensional creature, but with the help of a traitor, there might still be a chance.

According to the dragon queen, the seven dragon monarchs of the Seven Dragons Sea probably didn’t have a good impression of the Seven Seas Dragon King. They might even hate him to the core. If he could incite internal strife, he might have a chance to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King.

It was unrealistic to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King in its Terror form, but a Terror-grade existence wasn’t always in a Terror form. If he could take advantage of it, he might not need to wait for Banana Fairy to complete her evolution.

“You should have a name, right? How should I address you?” Zhou Wen asked the dragon queen.
