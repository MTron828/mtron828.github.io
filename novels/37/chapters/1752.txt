Chapter 1753 Humanity’s First Fruit

“He didn’t plunge in? How did he do it?” Su Yi was overjoyed as she said excitedly.

The comments exploded. Everyone was discussing why Ming Xiu hadn’t fallen into the lake. Previously, there were human powerhouses who had attempted to clear the level, but just as they entered the Lake of Fog, they inexplicably fell into the lake and died.

Ming Xiu could actually fly on the Lake of Fog. This was already a pleasant surprise.

“This Ming Xiu fella is something! Why haven’t I heard of him before?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Ignorant. That’s a powerhouse from our East District, the famous Swordsman Tomorrow.”

“What’s there to be smug about? He’s not out of the Lake of Fog yet.”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. The names ‘Ming Xiu’ and ‘Swordsman Tomorrow’ quickly spread throughout the Federation. Even many factions in the dimension were paying attention to the attempt.

Ming Xiu rode his sword and slowly flew across the misty lake.

Suddenly, his stance changed. He slashed with his hand. His actions were still gentle and slow, but there was nothing wherever his sword slashed.

After that, Ming Xiu brandished his sword several times, but he failed to hit anything. Everyone was puzzled.

“What’s he doing? Performing?” Many people were puzzled. They really couldn’t see the meaning behind the sword brandishing. They only felt that it was a swordplay.

Professor Gu, who hadn’t commented in a long time, seemed to understand something. He said excitedly, “Amazing, really amazing!”

“Professor Gu, are you talking about Ming Xiu?” Su Yi asked Professor Gu in puzzlement.

“Of course.” Professor Gu continued excitedly, “Swordsman Tomorrow lives up to his reputation. I have to take back what I said previously. His sword art has already transcended the typical sword art and reached an unprecedented height. It’s not an exaggeration to say that he’s the number one sword art expert I’ve ever met.”

“Professor Gu, can you please explain in detail how strong Swordsman Tomorrow’s sword technique is?” Su Yi added.

“Previously, many human experts speculated about the Lake of Fog. Most of them believed that the Lake of Fog had a powerful suction force. Creatures with insufficient strength would be sucked to the bottom of the lake the moment they entered. However, after seeing Swordsman Tomorrow’s performance, I truly understand that my previous guess was wrong. The Lake of Fog doesn’t have any suction force. What really pulls creatures to the bottom of the lake isn’t the suction force of the lake, but an invisible creature,” Professor Gu said seriously.

“An invisible creature?” Su Yi looked at the lake in surprise again, but she still didn’t discover anything. She said in puzzlement, “If there’s really a creature lurking in the lake to attack the challenger, even if it can’t be seen with the naked eye, the lake should have some reaction, right? But from the looks of it, the lake doesn’t stir at all. It’s as calm as a mirror’s surface. How does that creature rush out of the water to attack the challenger?”

“It’s precisely because the lake doesn’t stir that I was misled. Only when Swordsman Tomorrow appeared did I discover something. That underwater creature is an existence that can freely traverse the water without affecting the water flow. However, you have to watch carefully. Don’t look at the water surface. Pay attention to the fog around Swordsman Tomorrow when he brandishes his sword… It’s not beside the sword, but somewhere further away from it…”

After hearing Professor Gu’s words, people looked carefully and immediately saw something unusual.

Every time Ming Xiu brandished his sword, a tiny vortex would appear in the fog not far from the sword. If one didn’t look carefully, they would think that it was the airflow caused by the sword.

However, upon careful inspection, one would discover that the direction of the vortexes was clearly different from the airflow triggered by the sword.

The more Professor Gu spoke, the more excited he became. “Although I can’t see what that creature is, every swing of Swordsman Tomorrow’s sword forces it into a retreat. Clearly, it has sealed off the creature’s attack path. It looks like he’s slowly brandishing his sword, but it’s an ingenious and flawless judgment and seal… This person is really too powerful… I can’t imagine how he did it…” After Professor Gu’s explanation, the average person gradually understood. The more they looked at Ming Xiu, the more they felt that he was indeed extremely powerful. Their impression of him gradually improved.

“I never expected such a powerful swordsman to exist among us humans!”

“This Swordsman Tomorrow is really strong and ferocious. He’s many times stronger than the representatives of the six families. Look at those fellows. They don’t even dare to attempt the level while he rushes straight in.”

“From today… No… From now on… Ming Xiu is my idol…”

Everyone watched as Ming Xiu tore through the fog like a sword immortal. In the distance, they could vaguely see the lake’s bank and the golden apple tree. They immediately became excited.

“These young people grow very quickly.” Zhang Chunqiu looked at the scene on the Cube and couldn’t help but sigh.

“You make it sound like you’re very old. You’re not much older than them,” Xia Liuchuan said with a twitch of his lips.

“My person may not be old, but my heart is old,” Zhang Chunqiu said indifferently.

“There are merits to being old. This world doesn’t just need young courage,” Xia Liuchuan said.

“But that’s the mental crutch that humans need,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

It was indeed as Zhang Chunqiu had said. The moment Ming Xiu stepped onto solid ground, many people watching the livestream around the world cheered in unison.

Although many people didn’t know who Ming Xiu was in the past, at that moment, Ming Xiu was like family or even their own incarnation. They felt the joy as if it was their own.

Ming Xiu held his sword and walked towards the golden apple tree. Under the attention of everyone, he slashed at the stalk of one of the golden apples.

Just as everyone thought that humans were finally about to take down the first golden apple, they heard a metallic clang. The thin stalk blocked Ming Xiu’s sword without suffering any damage.

Everyone was alarmed. Previously, when they saw the alien races easily pluck the golden apples, they imagined that it would be easy to pluck it. They never expected it to be so hard.

Ming Xiu slashed at the apple stalk again and again. After slashing more than ten times, he failed to damage it at all. His forehead was already covered in sweat, and his breathing had become very heavy. Everyone was alarmed.

Is the difference between humans and alien races really that great? Many humans couldn’t help but feel a chill.

“Humans are ultimately too weak. So what if they can walk to the golden tree? They can’t do anything.” The girl, who was originally worried, secretly heaved a sigh of relief when she saw this scene. She looked at Zhou Wen provocatively.

Just as the girl said that, Ming Xiu took two steps back and didn’t continue brandishing his sword. He only held his sword in one hand and stared intently at the golden apple hanging on the tree branch.

In the next second, Ming Xiu suddenly brandished his sword again. However, this time, his sword was even slower than before. It moved towards the golden apple inch by inch.

“Can such a slow sword slice off the golden apple?” Su Yi asked. This was also the answer all humans wanted to know.

The moment the blade touched the branch, it made one feel as though their eyes had gone adrift. For some reason, the sword passed through the tree branch and arrived behind the golden apple.

Crack!

Just as everyone was wondering what had happened, the tree branch snapped and the golden apple fell. Ming Xiu grabbed it with one hand.

Humanity finally had their first golden apple.

Soon, the Cube’s screen changed. The dimensional zone vanished and was replaced by the Cube’s ranking. A new name appeared on the rankings. However, when people saw the name clearly, their eyes widened as their mouths involuntarily gaped. They didn’t close them for a long time.
