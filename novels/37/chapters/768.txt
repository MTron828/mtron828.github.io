Chapter 769: Cherish the Opportunity

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen picked up the Buddha plaque in Xiao Si’s hand with his sword. For Xiao Si to use the Buddha plaque against Zhou Wen despite having seen his strength, it was likely that the Buddha plaque had extraordinary strength, so Zhou Wen was rather careful.

After the dimensional storms, there were too many mysterious powers in the world. Zhou Wen wasn’t arrogant enough to believe that he was invincible just because he had some achievements.

If he was not careful, this tiny Buddha plaque might become his death warrant.

Zhou Wen carefully sized up the Buddha plaque and couldn’t see anything amiss. All he felt was that there was some invisible evil aura lingering on it.

However, this evil aura didn’t seem to have any effect.

This was because the Buddha plaque needed a special method to be used. Zhou Wen didn’t know how to use it, nor was he able to activate the Companion Beast in the Buddha plaque. After fiddling with it for a while and seeing that it was useless, he put it away.

He searched Xiao Si’s body again. Apart from a few Buddha plaques, there was nothing else of value.

Zhou Wen put away the Buddha plaques and summoned the Fire Furnace Queen to burn Xiao Si’s corpse to ashes.

“Let’s return.” Zhou Wen took Wang Chan back to the Wang family’s courtyard and went to see Grandma Wang. He recounted the entire process in detail, but he didn’t explain much.

Grandma Wang listened attentively without saying a word. After she finished listening, she asked Zhou Wen and Wang Chan a few questions.

“Little Zhou, you’ve done well. You’ve helped our Wang family greatly and saved Little Chan. I’ll just keep it short. I need to gather the core members of the Wang family to discuss our response. Although the Xiao family’s forces aren’t comparable to our Wang family and are far away in the South District, their Companion Beasts and various skills are somewhat special. We have to be wary of them. Also, don’t tell anyone about this matter. Just treat it as though it never happened. Leave everything to our Wang family,” Grandma Wang said to Zhou Wen after some thought.

“I killed him. If there’s anything you need me for, just tell me,” Zhou Wen said.

“Good child, since you call me Grandma, I won’t stand on ceremony with you. I’ll think of you when I need you. Go back with Little Chan now. Do what you need to do and pretend nothing has happened,” Grandma Wang said.

Zhou Wen and Wang Chan left the hall. Wang Chan looked at Zhou Wen in delight and said, “Zhou Wen, thank you. If it weren’t for you, I would have been fooled by that detestable fellow. Now, I can finally be at ease.”

Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “Your sister helped me a lot. In comparison, what I did was nothing. You don’t have to take it to heart.”

With that said, Zhou Wen turned around and returned to his room.

Since the Wang family already knew of the Xiao family’s intentions towards Wang Chan, they would naturally be wary in the future. Zhou Wen didn’t need to continue interfering.

As Wang Chan watched Zhou Wen enter the room, she held the Silver-Winged Yaksha Companion Egg in hand. She wanted to stop him, but when she opened her mouth, she closed it again.

“Humph, Sister is right. This Numbskull Wen is pretty nice, but he isn’t good with words.” Wang Chan put the Silver-Winged Yaksha Companion Egg back into her pocket. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She originally wanted to return it to Zhou Wen. After all, she had no way of incubating such a Mythical Companion Egg. It was useless even if she took it. Furthermore, she wasn’t someone who would take things from others.

If she really wanted a Mythical Companion Egg, it wouldn’t be difficult for her with her having an elder sister like Wang Lu around.

Despite that, Wang Chan changed her mind and didn’t return the Companion Egg to Zhou Wen. Instead, she returned to the Wang family with it.

...

Wang Lu already knew what had happened. After Wang Chan returned, she asked her in private, “Little Chan, are you alright?”

“I’m fine. Thankfully, Zhou Wen was there. Otherwise, I would have been fooled by that b*stard Xiao Si. Now, I finally know that my misfortune Life Providence might not necessarily bring misfortune to everyone. At the very least, Zhou Wen isn’t affected by my misfortune,” Wang Chan said.

Wang Lu smiled and said, “It’s good that you think that way. Your Life Providence is nothing much.”

“By the way, Sister, do you like that Numbskull Wen?” Wang Chan asked.

“How can that be? We are just classmates with a better relationship,” Wang Lu hurriedly said.

“I see. Then, sister, you have to cherish this opportunity,” Wang Chan said.

“What do you mean cherish the opportunity? No one wants such a boring man. It would be strange if he had a girlfriend,” Wang Lu said with a twitch of her lips.

“That might be the case. I think Numbskull Wen isn’t bad. If you don’t want him, I’ll be his girlfriend when I grow up.” With that said, Wang Chan carried the Companion Egg back to her room.

Wang Lu was taken aback. She hadn’t expected Wang Chan to say that.

...

After Zhou Wen returned to his room, he continued grinding the Ancient Sword Tomb. He was still thinking about the Shadow Containment Sword and Night Training Sword.

However, the Ancient Sword Tomb was just too huge. Most ancient swords were at the Mortal and Legendary stage. It wasn’t easy to find an Epic, much less a Mythical.

After grinding for a few hours, none of the ancient swords destroyed were at the Mythical stage.

On the other hand, the vine sword was still there. Zhou Wen had tried all sorts of methods to pull out the sword, but the outcome was the same. He couldn’t pull it out no matter what.

Zhou Wen didn’t take out the Buddha plaques to study them because he was afraid that there were special settings on them. It wouldn’t be good if the Xiao family traced the clues to him.

Placing them in the chaos space was equivalent to them being in another space. It severed all connections with the outside world. No matter how powerful the Xiao family was, it was impossible for them to find those Buddha plaques.

Zhou Wen planned on studying the Buddha plaques after leaving the Imperial Capital.

His only regret in coming to the Imperial Capital was that he couldn’t download the Great Wall instance dungeon. However, Zhou Wen already roughly knew that the Undying Battle Soul was a soul-type creature. It wasn’t that he couldn’t kill it, but he needed some special powers.

...

The anomaly in Forbidden City continued as lightning continued to fall from the heavens, turning Forbidden City into a city of lightning. However, the lightning was limited to the city, so it didn’t affect the Imperial Capital much.

Some people had already attempted to enter Forbidden City to explore the situation inside, but the outcome was terrible. Be it Companion Beasts or humans, people immediately lost contact with them upon their entry into Forbidden City. Up to now, no one had survived.

What exactly is the woman inside that log? What’s her relationship with the antelope? Why would it let me carry her into Forbidden City? Zhou Wen thought for a long time but failed to come up with an answer.

He asked the antelope, but it kept looking at him with a strange expression. He couldn’t tell what it meant. It looked a little like pity, regret, contempt, and a hint of gloating. In short, Zhou Wen’s hair stood on end every time he looked at it, but the antelope didn’t give him an answer.
