Chapter 1481 The Baffling Giant Bear

Holy Spring Well had apparently dried up in the past. After Mingdao Palace transformed into a dimensional zone, Holy Spring Well surged with spring water again. After the spring water appeared, someone had tried drinking the spring water from the Holy Spring Well, but there were no special effects. Not only did he not ascend to immortality, but there weren’t even any healing effects.

As Zhou Wen was pondering, the bear had already raised the bucket. It was filled with water.

wouldn’t be too clear, but now, the water in the bucket looked purer than pure water. One could even smell the sweetness of the spring water.

Earth’s environment is many times better than before. Speaking of which, can this be considered a form of self-repair for Earth? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think.

The giant bear placed the bucket between Zhou Wen and the bear as the baby bear lowered its head to lick the water.

When Zhou Wen saw this, he had no choice but to move his head over. Otherwise, if the giant bear saw through him, all his prior forbearance would have been in vain.

Now, Zhou Wen wasn’t too interested in killing the bear. With the huge changes in Mingdao Palace, all he wanted to know was if there had been any changes to Laojun Platform.

In the past, Laojun Platform had a total of 33 steps from bottom to top. It meant that Taishang Laojun had ascended to the 33 Heavens. It was unknown what Laojun Platform had become.

In fact, Zhou Wen was still looking forward to it before coming

The Dao Sutra he cultivated came from Mount Laojun. This place was called Laojun Platform. Perhaps they had some connection and he could use Laojun Platform to advance the Dao Sutra to the Calamity grade.

However, along the way, he didn’t discover anything that could advance the Dao Sutra. At the very least, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder in his body didn’t resonate.

As Zhou Wen thought about it, he drank the water. Soon, the bucket was finished by him and the baby bear. Finally, the baby bear hugged the bucket and rolled on the ground, pouring the remaining water into its mouth.

Zhou Wen didn’t notice anything special when he drank the water. There wasn’t any rich Essence Energy contained in it, nor did he discover any special attributes. Apart from the refreshing taste, he didn’t discover any benefits from the water.

Seeing that the bucket was empty, the giant bear carried the bucket away and quickly scooped another bucket of water. It placed it between Zhou Wen and the baby bear again. It apparently wanted them to continue drinking. The baby bear obediently drank the water, but Zhou Wen wasn’t too willing. Although he could drink it, he wasn’t an aquatic animal. What was the point of drinking so much water?

Despite his thoughts, he still had to drink. Furthermore, he couldn’t drink less than the baby bear.

If the baby bear drank a lot every day and he only drank a little, it would inevitably arouse the giant bear’s suspicion.

Zhou Wen never expected the giant bear to draw bucket after bucket. It had no intention of stopping Once the water in the bucket was finished, the giant bear would immediately draw another bucket of water.

Zhou Wen foolishly fought with the bear for more in the beginning. After a few buckets, he couldn’t take it anymore. All he could do was drink as little as possible and let the baby bear drink more.

After ten buckets, Zhou Wen was at his limits. All he did was extend his tongue and lick it a few times. He really couldn’t drink anymore.

Zhou Wen was even willing to fight the bear to the death rather than drink any more water.

To his surprise, the giant bear ignored Zhou Wen’s obvious difference. It only watched from the side and waited for the baby bear to finish drinking before drawing more water.

Zhou Wen had only heard of people who couldn’t be satiated. This was the first time he was seeing someone like the baby bear who could drink indefinite amounts of water.

The baby bear was like a bottomless pit. It drank more than half of the ten buckets of water, but it still looked like it wasn’t enough. Its stomach didn’t expand either.

Could it be that the water in the Holy Spring Well really has some benefits? But I’ve also drunk quite a bit. Why don’t I feel anything? Logically speaking, there should be some benefits after drinking for so long, right? But if there aren’t any benefits, why is this baby bear so gluttonous? It’s as though it can’t be satiated. Zhou Wen considered drinking more. What if there were benefits?

However, this thought was instantly rejected by him. He really couldn’t drink anymore. He nearly vomited when he saw the water.

Forget it. If the Holy Spring Well’s water really has benefits, I’ll just find an opportunity to extract some and place it in the chaos space. I’ll use Holy Spring Water to eat, cook, and boil soup. I’ll even use Holy Spring Water to wash my clothes… It was just a thought on Zhou Wen’s part. He wouldn’t really bear to use Holy Spring Water to wash his clothes.

What’s that giant bear trying to do? When Zhou Wen saw that the giant bear was constantly drawing water for the baby bear to drink, he had more questions. However, he didn’t know who to ask.

In the end, Zhou Wen stood by the side and watched without even continuing the act.

Zhou Wen kept counting by the side. The baby bear finally seemed full when it drank more than thirty buckets. It burped before it could finish the remaining half of the bucket.

Seeing that the baby bear was full, the giant bear didn’t continue drawing water. It extended its claws and picked up Zhou Wen and the baby bear before placing them back on its back. Then, it turned around and walked into the forest. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The giant bear passed through the forest and soon arrived in front of a mountain-like building

Laojun Platform? Zhou Wen took a careful look. Although the building was somewhat different from the pictures he had seen of Laojun Platform, it looked mostly correct.

Laojun Platform was many times taller than before. Conservatively speaking, it was already more than a hundred meters tall.

Although Laojun Platform was much taller, it scaled in the same ratio, so it didn’t look too different. Even the steps were the same-only 33 steps.

One step was now two to three meters tall. It would be difficult for ordinary people to climb

It was no problem for the giant bear. It used all its limbs and climbed up step by step.

I was planning on going up Laojun Platform to take a look. Perfect, I don’t even have to walk on my own. I’m riding a bear up. This treatment can be considered unique, right? Zhou Wen sat stably on the giant bear as the baby bear kept pestering him, constantly leaning against him.

Laojun Platform was almost right in front of him. Zhou Wen sized up the top of the door and saw that the words engraved on it weren’t Laojun Platform, but Immortal Ascension Platform.

The door to the Immortal Ascension Platform was closed. He couldn’t see anything inside from the outside. The giant bear had already sprawled at the door instead of rushing in immediately. Zhou Wen’s gaze was attracted by a pair of doors on both sides of the entrance. The door was shaped like a vertical drum. The drum’s surface was engraved with the symbol of two dragons playing with a pearl. And above the door was a beast-like sculpture. It had deformed due to age, making it impossible to tell what creature it was.

Zhou Wen was studying the strange beast on the door when the giant bear suddenly leaped up and pounced at the door. In the next second, there was a boom.
