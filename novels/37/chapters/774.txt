Chapter 775: The Chick Spews Fire

Translator: CKtalon

“Zhou Wen, what did you discover?” The people in front stopped and Li Mobai looked at Zhou Wen. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“There’s something amiss up ahead,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed ahead.

Gu Shanshui looked ahead, but he didn’t seem to notice anything. However, he quickly summoned a Companion Beast. The Companion Beast transformed into a mirror eye that appeared in his left eye, making it look like his left eye was completely occupied by the iris.

Gu Shanshui used his left eye to look ahead for a while before saying, “There’s indeed a problem ahead. Stay here and don’t move. I’ll go take a look.”

As Gu Shanshui spoke, he dived forward. Before long, he returned and said to Li Mobai, “Zhou is right. There’s indeed something wrong ahead. There are many corpses with jellyfish fungi growing on them. There are too many of them. We can’t deal with them.”

Butterfly said, “We also have fire-elemental Companion Beasts. We can help you clean them up.”

Gu Shanshui shook his head and said, “You must not use fire-elemental Companion Beasts here. Otherwise, there might be trouble. Although the fire-elemental Companion Beasts we use aren’t of a high level, their fire-elemental attributes are very special. It’s called Corpse fire. It’s a type of Yin fire that is most effective against parasitic fungi on rotting corpses.”

“Master Gu, is there any other way?” Li Mobai asked.

“We can only take a detour. If we take a detour, it will take us an additional 30 to 40 kilometers. Furthermore, we might have to pass through a dimensional zone known as the Spirit Absorption Valley. Our speed won’t be fast. We will have to walk for at least ten hours more than we expected. Furthermore, the Spirit Absorption Valley is somewhat dangerous. If we are unlucky, we might have to retreat again,” said Gu Shanshui after some calculations.

“Is there no other way? Spirit Absorption Valley is too dangerous. Furthermore, we might not be able to reach it.” Li Mobai had heard of the famous Spirit Absorption Valley and didn’t wish to go there.

“If we don’t take a detour, we must get rid of the jellyfish fungi. However, we can only slowly deal with them from the periphery. It will probably take two days to clean up all the jellyfish fungi along the way. Furthermore, we don’t know if there are any more,” Gu Shanshui said.

Li Mobai thought for a moment and said, “Then let’s clean up the jellyfish fungi. It’s better not to go to the Spirit Absorption Valley.”

“I have a fire-elemental pet here. Master Gu, can you help me see if it can be of any help?” Zhou Wen released the chick from his backpack.

After Tai Sui advanced to the Mythical stage, it didn’t seem to have much appetite for ordinary microbes. As for these jellyfish fungi, they were only grown from the spores emitted from the parent fungus’ body and not dimensional creatures’ bodies. Tai Sui was even less interested.

Zhou Wen had tried Tai Sui’s Wheel of Destiny, but he hadn’t discovered any special effects as though it was useless. Tai Sui’s body didn’t undergo any changes, leaving Zhou Wen depressed.

“Didn’t Master Gu say that ordinary fire-elemental creatures can’t be used here? Didn’t you hear him just now?” Gu Lou said unhappily.

Zhou Wen hadn’t listened to Gu Shanshui’s words to store the chick and Tai Sui away. From the looks of it, he didn’t trust them. This made Gu Lou have a bad impression of Zhou Wen.

Now that Zhou Wen had taken out a fire-elemental pet, Gu Lou felt even more irked.

However, Gu Shanshui didn’t share the same thoughts. Zhou Wen had discovered the jellyfish fungi ahead of time, making him feel that this young man wasn’t simple.

Furthermore, people like Li Mobai seemed to respect Zhou Wen, making Gu Shanshui even more afraid of underestimating him.

Gu Shanshui stopped Gu Lou and looked at the chick. “Does your pet’s flame belong to the Yin fire type?”

“I’m not too sure about that, but its flames can be released and retracted freely. It should be of some use,” Zhou Wen said.

“What’s the point of releasing and retracting freely? Whose Companion Beast’s ability can’t do that? Don’t you have any common sense? There are a lot of spores here. When gathered together, they are like powder. Using ordinary flames can easily trigger a dust explosion. Even without the dust explosion, igniting a large area of spores will trigger a forest fire. It’s very easy to alarm the dimensional creatures in the forest...” said Gu Lou.

“Gu Lou, don’t be rude to guests.” Gu Shanshui frowned.

Upon hearing Gu Shanshui’s words, Gu Lou could only shut up and not say another word. However, from his expression, it was obvious that he wasn’t convinced.

Gu Shanshui bowed at Zhou Wen and said, “Zhou, Gu Lou is young and insensible. Please don’t take his rude words to heart. However, what he said is right. Typical flames will indeed cause many problems. If you are confident, you can get your pet to give it a try. If you aren’t confident, let us be in charge of cleaning up. It doesn’t matter if we spend more time.”

“Master Gu, I know a little about the taboos of using flames. Didn’t I just say that my pet can control its flames without triggering an explosion or fire?” Zhou Wen had seen the chick’s flames before, so he naturally knew that it had such an ability.

“Then let’s give it a try. Let it spew out some flames,” said Gu Shanshui.

Zhou Wen gestured for the chick to spew out its flames, but the chick’s temper wasn’t as good as Zhou Wen’s. Its intelligence wasn’t inferior to humans. Although it didn’t speak the human language, it could understand them.

Gu Lou’s words displeased it. Just as Zhou Wen gestured, the chick flapped its wings and didn’t spew out any flames for Gu Shanshui to verify. It flew straight to the corpses and spat out a swath of golden flames.

“Not good!” Gu Shanshui, Gu Lou, and Gu He were all shocked.

There were nearly a hundred corpses there. Countless jellyfish fungi of various sizes grew on them. Once they were burned by the flames, large numbers of jellyfish fungi would explode. Even if they didn’t produce dust explosions, large numbers of spores would spread out.

However, what happened next left them stunned.

The chick’s golden flames landed on the corpses, igniting the corpses along with the jellyfish fungi. Strangely, the jellyfish fungi didn’t explode when they were burned. They quickly turned to ashes amidst the golden flames.

Nearly a hundred corpses, along with the jellyfish fungi on them, were instantly reduced to ashes. Nothing was left behind.

Furthermore, the golden flames only burned the corpses and jellyfish fungi. They didn’t affect the nearby creatures at all. Even the other spores in the air weren’t ignited.

Gu Lou and Gu He were stunned. Even the Corpse fire they used didn’t have such a good effect, much less be capable of removing all the jellyfish fungi and corpses so quickly.

Gu Shanshui stared at the chick as his expression turned odd. After staring at it for a while, he suddenly turned to Zhou Wen and bowed. “Mr. Zhou, if I’m willing to send you through the Flower River to enter the Valley of No Return, can you do me a favor?”

Gu Lou and Gu He were alarmed. The foreigners didn’t know the bow that Gu Shanshui was giving, but they knew very well that it was a very high-level etiquette. Typically, such a bow would only be used for accomplished monks with great merit.
