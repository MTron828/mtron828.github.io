Chapter 1669: The Strange Ancient Well !

Translator: CKtalon

My dear lady, you aren’t eating this or that. If you are so picky, you will starve to death sooner or later.?Zhou Wen was depressed, but he didn’t verbalize it as he racked his brains.

“Neonate, do you have anything you want to eat?” Zhou Wen squatted in front of Demonic Neonate and asked as he stroked her head.

Demonic Neonate thought for a moment before turning to leave. Zhou Wen hurriedly followed. He hadn’t gone out for days, so he found the sunlight a little blinding when he walked out of the room.

Zhou Wen lived in a courtyard house in the north-west corner of the ancient city. Such courtyard houses were everywhere in Guide Ancient City and weren’t very eye-catching. In fact, there were many bigger courtyard houses.

As the owner of the ancient city, Zhou Wen could have chosen a better place. The reason he didn’t do so was that this inconspicuous courtyard house actually had something strange.

Every building in the ancient city was almost an independent space. Zhou Wen had already explored most of the buildings, but he had yet to find a way to enter a few places.

For example, he had yet to find a way to enter the Town God’s Temple, a bell tower, and some strange courtyards. Although he could enter this small courtyard, there were some bizarre things that Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out.

On the one hand, he was staying here to explore the secret of the yard, but on the other hand, he was afraid that something would happen here. If anything really happened, he could suppress it in time.

The yard wasn’t big, and the buildings themselves weren’t too special. However, there was a well in the yard. On special days, one could hear the churning sound of spring water coming from it.

It sounded normal for there to be such sounds in a well. It wasn’t strange at all for wells with fresh water and underground springs.

In fact, even if a dimensional creature in the well made a sound, it wouldn’t be strange.

The strange thing was that there was no water in the well. It was a well without water, but one would often hear water splashing in the middle of the night. This was somewhat strange.

Zhou Wen had once sent Companion Beasts to explore, but he didn’t discover anything. The ancient well wasn’t deep to begin with, so Zhou Wen could see the bottom at a glance. The bottom was covered in aged soil without any humidity, much less water.

Every time there was the sound of water, Zhou Wen would look down from the well, but the outcome was the same. He could only see the mud at the bottom of the well with no signs of water.

However, the sound of water flowing like a fountain clearly reached his ears. It wasn’t just Zhou Wen. Everyone could hear it as long as they entered the yard.

Zhou Wen had once dug the bottom of the well, but no matter how deep he dug, he didn’t discover anything. Furthermore, the soil he dug out would vanish after some time. The hole that was dug out would return to its original state as though it had never been moved.

How could Zhou Wen be at ease with such a strange ancient well in such a residence? He could only stay here himself. If anything happened, he could deal with it in time.

However, for such a long period of time, although the ancient well often produced water sounds in the middle of the night, there were no other abnormalities. Therefore, Zhou Wen hadn’t deliberately studied the ancient well recently.

After Demonic Neonate came out of the room, she came to the side of the ancient well and jumped onto the edge. She craned her neck and looked into the ancient well.

After watching for a while, Demonic Neonate looked up at Zhou Wen. She pointed the Demonic Sword into the ancient well with one hand and said, “Down there.

“There’s nothing under this ancient well. I dug more than a thousand meters deep, but I didn’t see anything,” Zhou Wen said as he came to the ancient well and looked inside. He knew that Demonic Neonate wouldn’t do so for no reason.

Just like before, he could see the bottom of the well at a glance. There was nothing below.

Demonic Neonate lowered her head and looked into the well. After a while, she suddenly said, “The thing is down there.’

“Where is it?” Zhou Wen focused his gaze and even summoned Doctor Darkness to fuse with him. He used his Eyes of Penetration to look down, but he still didn’t see anything.

Demonic Neonate frowned in thought as though she didn’t know how to explain. After a moment of silence, she suddenly reached out and plucked the suona at her waist.

Typical Companion Beasts didn’t use weapons. Even if some Companion Beasts did, they were companion weapons that they came with. However, Demonic Neonate was different. The tools on her body were basically snatched from others.

The Demonic Sword, the Heaven Shrouding Bell, and the suona were all snatched from someone. However, other than the Demonic Sword, Demonic Neonate seldom used the Heaven Shrouding Bell and the suona.

Demonic Neonate placed the suona in front of her mouth. Her cheeks swelled up as she tried to blow the suona.

“Don’t!” Zhou Wen jumped in fright as he hurriedly reached out to hug Demonic Neonate. His other hand covered her mouth, preventing her from blowing out.

The suona sounded like funeral music. Zhou Wen could withstand the power of

the suona, but ordinary people in Guide Ancient City probably couldn’t.

It wouldn’t be good if the entire city cried.

Zhou Wen covered Demonic Neonate’s mouth, preventing her from releasing her breath. Her cheeks swelled as her eyes widened.

He reached out to pull away the hand that covered his mouth. Demonic Neonate exhaled and stared at Zhou Wen. “Without blowing... The thing below won’t come out...”

“What’s down there?” Zhou Wen really couldn’t tell what was down there. He was really curious as he stared into Demonic Neonate’s eyes and asked. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Food,” Demonic Neonate answered with certainty.

“What kind of food?” Zhou Wen nearly vomited blood as he continued asking patiently.

“Don’t know. It’s food,” Demonic Neonate answered very quickly.

Zhou Wen was depressed, but he knew that he couldn’t get any answers from her. He pointed at the suona Demonic Neonate was holding and said, “You can blow this thing, but is there any way to prevent its sound from affecting the others in the city?”

Demonic Neonate tilted her head and thought for a while before nodding. “Yes.”

Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief and released Demonic Neonate. “Go ahead. I happen to want to know what’s inside this ancient well.”

Demonic Neonate placed the suona by her lips again and puffed up her cheeks to blow.

The loud music was earth-shattering. It penetrated deep into one’s soul as though it wanted to rob a person of their soul.

Plop!

Zhou Wen’s legs went limp as he knelt on the ground. His tears in his eyes were like pearls as they fell one after another.

“Holy sh*t, didn’t you say that it won’t affect the others?” Zhou Wen’s words turned into sobbing as he struggled to stand up, but he couldn’t.

“There’s no one else here.” Demonic Neonate’s voice sounded in Zhou Wen’s mind as she continued playing the suona.

The demonic, desolate voice constantly entered Zhou Wen’s ears, causing his tears to constantly fall. He had never cried so much ever since he grew up.

Zhou Wen was about to say something when he heard the sound of flowing water from the ancient well.

The sound of water in the ancient well usually sounded at night. This was the first time it had appeared in broad daylight..
