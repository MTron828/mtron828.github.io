Chapter 979: Successful Parasitizing

Constant daily practice brought about excellent results. Although Sword Pill hadn’t advanced, Zhou Wen’s sword technique had improved tremendously.

Although it wasn’t as good as his movement technique, he had already gained some level of mastery in the way of the sword. It wasn’t like before when he only used a sword as a blade to slash at people.

With practice came interest. Although they were all swords, the usage and concepts of different swords were different. Some very subtle things could not be understood by just looking at them. He had to experience them personally.

As he had truly put in hard work, be it his sword intents or the thirteen sword arts, they had advanced by leaps and bounds. Zhou Wen felt that the thirteen sword arts were likely to be the second Mythical technique he would master.

Seven days had passed, but the Seven Seas Dragon King remained motionless. It slept in the cave, somewhat different from what Zhou Wen had imagined.

Although Tyrant Behemoth had already penetrated the white liquid and discovered that they were inside something that resembled a stomach, it was useless even if they could escape if they couldn’t save Qin Ling and company.

Therefore, Zhou Wen kept placating Miya, getting her to wait patiently.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t think it was feasible to just wait. Since the white liquid had been penetrated, Zhou Wen decided to try releasing Primordial Spore to see if he could parasitize the Seven Seas Dragon King from the inside.

In theory, it was impossible for a Mythical Primordial Spore to parasitize a Terror-grade Seven Seas Dragon King.

However, Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t impossible for Primordial Spore to do so. After all, it was currently in the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body. This was a huge advantage. Furthermore, the Seven Seas Dragon King was sleeping, so its bodily functions were at their lowest in all aspects. Perhaps Primordial Spore had a chance.

The tiny Primordial Spore flew out of the Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach and quickly landed on the inner wall of an organ like a speck of dust.

The organs of the Seven Seas Dragon King were still undulating evenly without any abnormalities. Only then did Zhou Wen heave a sigh of relief. Although he didn’t know if he could successfully parasitize it, from the looks of it, Primordial Spore hadn’t been discovered.

Zhou Wen continued waiting. If Primordial Spore could successfully parasitize the Seven Seas Dragon King, it would undoubtedly be great news for him.

Following that was another long wait. Zhou Wen spent every day grinding dungeons to train. His sword intents constantly became stronger, and his sword techniques seemed to gain divine augmentation.

In Zhou Wen’s mind, he also memorized the characteristics and usage of various swords. Furthermore, Zhou Wen vaguely felt that Sword Pill seemed to show signs of advancing.

Three thousand sword intents needed to be matched with three thousand swords. Most sword intents could find their corresponding sword in the Ancient Sword Tomb.

However, there were still many sword intents that failed to find a sword to resonate with in the Ancient Sword Tomb.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if it was because his sword intent wasn’t strong enough to trigger the high-level swords or if it was because there was no ancient sword with the corresponding sword intent in the Ancient Sword Tomb.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that the former was more likely, so he planned on raising his sword intent level.

Although sword intent stemmed from a sword art, it was something that required comprehension instead of practice. If one could comprehend it, they might only need an instant to raise their strength.

However, if one couldn’t comprehend it, they might not be able to improve even if they trained for ten years.

Training hard definitely doesn’t work, but if I don’t train, I won’t be able to understand the true intent of the sword, so I naturally won’t be able to comprehend sword intent. What should I do? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and he came up with a solution that wasn’t a solution. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He first used the three thousand sword intents to trigger the ancient swords’ resonance before plucking the ancient swords that had never resonated. Although he might encounter low-level swords, he might also encounter Mythical swords. In that scenario, he would narrow down the range of finding Mythical swords.

During the battle with high-level swords, he could comprehend his own sword intent.

Pulling out a sword, fighting, pulling out a sword, and fighting again—Zhou Wen kept repeating this process.

“What’s the thing you play all day?” Miya had observed Zhou Wen for many days. Although she wasn’t interested in human games, it was boring here, so she couldn’t help but ask after seeing him game on his phone.

“This? A mobile game. I can obtain experience and equipment by killing monsters,” Zhou Wen explained.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Miya’s expression turned odd. She didn’t think of herself as a monster in the past, nor could she understand why Qin Ling was so vexed because of her Golden Dragon bloodline.

However, after hearing Zhou Wen’s unintentional words today, Miya suddenly understood why Qin Ling minded her dragon bloodline. This was because she also felt uncomfortable.

“Do you want to play?” Zhou Wen looked up and asked Miya.

“No.” Miya shook her head and sat back on her mat to watch some dramas. However, she couldn’t get into it no matter what. She was somewhat in a daze.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what Miya was thinking as he continued practicing his swordplay in-game.

This was already the eleventh day since Zhou Wen and Miya had entered the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body. The Seven Seas Dragon King was still sleeping, but Zhou Wen received a signal that delighted him.

Primordial Spore had successfully parasitized the Seven Seas Dragon King. Although it was only a preliminary parasitization and it would take some time to truly control the Seven Seas Dragon King, this was already very good news for Zhou Wen.

I hope there’s still time. Zhou Wen had eavesdropped on the conversation between Dragon Granny and the man. He knew that if Qin Ling drank that thing, she would reach adulthood in a couple of weeks. When that happened, the man would extract Qin Ling’s bloodline and create something that could turn humans into human-dragons.

Zhou Wen had to save Qin Ling before that. He didn’t know if becoming a human-dragon was good or bad, but humans needed the right to choose. Zhou Wen felt that such a forceful mutation was a little too much. At the very least, he didn’t wish to become a Dracotaur.

Wouldn’t it be better to become a cat-man? Zhou Wen thought to himself. If he had to choose to transform, he would rather become a cat. At the very least, it wouldn’t be that ugly.

“Do you know sword arts?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked Miya one day.

“No.” Miya shook her head and asked curiously, “Why are you suddenly asking this?”

“If you know sword arts, I want to see your sword intent.” After cultivating for so many days, Zhou Wen felt that his sword art had reached a bottleneck. If he could improve further, his sword art would probably break through to the Mythical stage.

However, this bottleneck was clearly not that easy to break through. Furthermore, time was indeed too short. It had only been a few days since he began practicing seriously.

“The concepts in the world are all interconnected. Although I don’t know sword arts, I can let you see my concept if you want to see it,” said Miya.
