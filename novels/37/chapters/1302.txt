Chapter 1303: Strange Guardian Cocoon

Translator: CKtalon

For some reason, the ape that could swallow a flood dragon only stared at Zhou Wen without taking action.

Although they didn’t move, Zhou Wen still felt uneasy. He felt like an infant that had fallen into a tiger’s den and was surrounded by a group of tigers.

Grim Demon was also trembling in fear. Although he said that he was fearless, he was only at the Terror grade. There was no way to compete with an existence at the level of the Four Monkeys.

The ignorant were fearless. The more one knew about something, the more they would feel reverence.

Grim Demon was clearly a knowledgeable person. He knew how terrifying the four ferocious monkeys were.

“Do you recognize the Guardian cocoon’s species?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.

Grim Demon was slightly taken aback. Under Zhou Wen’s instructions, he realized that there was a Guardian cocoon inside the stone artifact.

“Strange!” Grim Demon didn’t dare approach to take a look. He only peeked from below, but his expression became puzzled. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“What’s strange?” Zhou Wen asked.

Grim Demon frowned and said, “That Guardian cocoon is a little strange. Typically, a Guardian cocoon that hasn’t hatched will be sent to a dimensional zone that matches its stats after being teleported to Earth. The power of the dimensional zone will have a certain effect on the Guardian cocoon, causing the Guardian’s growth to undergo a certain mutation. However, it won’t change his fundamental stats.”

“For example, if it’s a Guardian created from the genes of the angels, no matter how this Guardian mutates, be it into a fire-elemental angel or ice-elemental angel, he will still be in an angel form.” Grim Demon continued with an odd expression, “But this Companion Beast is somewhat different.”

“What’s different? Do you know what species the Guardian in the cocoon is?” Zhou Wen was spying on the Guardian cocoon, but he couldn’t see anything.

Grim Demon shook his head slightly. “I can’t see what’s inside the cocoon either. However, the power from the cocoon is clearly incompatible with the power attributes of this dimensional zone. Didn’t you notice?”

Zhou Wen had previously felt that the Guardian cocoon was somewhat strange, but he had been thinking of a way to escape without thinking too much about other things. Now that Grim Demon had mentioned it, he realized that the attributes of the Guardian cocoon were indeed somewhat incompatible with the attributes of this dimensional zone.

Although he couldn’t tell what attributes the Guardian cocoon had, it repelled the Essence Energy in the dimensional zone.

Grim Demon looked at the four apes and continued, “Furthermore, typically speaking, the dimensional creatures that stay beside the Guardian cocoon do so voluntarily. As for these four fellows, they seem to be chained here and have no choice but to guard this Guardian cocoon. Such a situation definitely has a special reason.”

“What could be the reason?” Zhou Wen didn’t know much about Guardians, so he could only ask Grim Demon.

Grim Demon shook his head. “There might be many reasons. Perhaps someone didn’t want this Guardian cocoon to hatch, so they sealed it in a place that doesn’t match the Guardian cocoon’s attributes to prevent it from hatching. The four apes might be used to prevent someone from contracting the Guardian cocoon or taking it away. It’s also possible that there’s something special about this Guardian cocoon such as it being only hatchable in such a place. There’s also a possibility that someone found this Guardian cocoon elsewhere and moved it here…”

Grim Demon listed a few possibilities, but he couldn’t determine which one it was.

“Someone imprisoned four Calamity-grade creatures and placed the Guardian cocoon in such a place. With such strength, it’s unlikely he’s human, right?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“That might not be the case. During the war in ancient times, there were quite a number of humans who reached the Calamity grade by combining with Guardians. There was even…” Grim Demon suddenly seemed to realize something and shut up.

“There was even an Apocalypse grade?” Zhou Wen sized up Grim Demon with interest. He had previously had the notion that Grim Demon might not be purely arrogant. Now, from the looks of it, he knew many things. It was very likely that he was a powerful Guardian that had survived the ancient era.

“I heard so.” Grim Demon was clearly being patronizing.

Seeing that Grim Demon had no intention of continuing, Zhou Wen didn’t press further. Instead, he asked, “Then, do you think that this Guardian cocoon might be a Guardian that survived the ancient era?”

“It doesn’t seem like it. This should be a Guardian cocoon that hasn’t hatched.” After a pause, Grim Demon continued, “However, it’s really possible that it was left behind from that era. Only an environment like this allows one to not hatch after such a long period of time.”

“How long ago was the ancient era you mentioned?” Zhou Wen asked.

“To you humans, it’s the prehistoric Mythical Era.” Grim Demon suddenly frowned and said, “Strange!”

“What’s wrong? Did you discover anything special?” Zhou Wen didn’t see anything amiss. The four ferocious apes were still staring at them without doing anything different.

“It’s just that it’s strange that there’s nothing special about it. Regardless of the possibility, these four fellows were chained here to guard this Guardian cocoon. We’ve been here for so long, but they haven’t reacted at all. This is too strange,” Grim Demon said.

Zhou Wen had previously found it odd that they were here to protect the Guardian cocoon, but they ignored him, an intruder. This was clearly odd.

“Could it be that they have been suppressed for too long and have lost the ability to attack?” Grim Demon pondered out loud.

“I saw with my own eyes that the golden-haired ape grabbed the air with one hand and sucked a flood dragon out of the sea. Then, it chewed it alive.” Zhou Wen rejected Grim Demon’s theory.

“That’s strange. Then why don’t they attack us? That doesn’t make sense.” Grim Demon frowned.

“Could it be that they are restricted by some taboo power and are unable to attack creatures on the turtle shell?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Impossible. No one is that foolish. Unless…” Grim Demon seemed to think of a possibility, but he was somewhat unsure.

“Unless what?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Unless there’s someone among us who can hatch the Guardian cocoon and meet the requirements of the person who designed all of this; only then will they not attack.” The person Grim Demon was referring to was naturally Zhou Wen. He was the only human here.

“No way?” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable. How could it be so coincidental that he met the conditions for hatching the Guardian cocoon?

“Apart from that, I really can’t think of any other possibility.” The more Grim Demon thought about it, the more he felt that it was right. He said to Zhou Wen, “You don’t have to belittle yourself. To be able to obtain Master’s favor, you aren’t too bad. Perhaps it’s really possible.”

No matter how Zhou Wen tried to interpret Grim Demon’s words, something seemed amiss.. It sounded like he was praising him, but it also didn’t feel right.
