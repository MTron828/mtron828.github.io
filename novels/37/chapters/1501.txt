Chapter 1502 Chick Starting A Fight

“Don’t be rash!” Zhou Wen wanted to stop Chick, but it was already too late. Chick was too fast as it rushed into the flames.

Chick’s entire body burned with phoenix flames. It was still dazzling amidst the already dazzling flames as it quickly charged at the gigantic figure.

Roar! The liquid on the planet spewed out, producing a terrifying glow and releasing massive amounts of energy. The explosion and radiation were accompanied by a terrifying shockwave and light spots. Instantly, all Zhou Wen saw were all sorts of strange light blasts. His vision became useless.

The Prisoned Dragon armor was affected by the terrifying energy. The armor turned red like a piece of red-hot metal at high temperatures.

The constantly erupting shockwaves sent Zhou Wen’s body into a retreat. As he retreated, Zhou Wen saw a monster’s head that resembled a rainbow crystal extend out from the various energy explosions. Just its head was comparable to an aircraft carrier.

It widened its mouth and devoured Chick who had flown into the flames. It was unimaginably huge.

Chick was like an ant in the monster’s mouth. It was close to being devoured.

A phoenix cry tore through space as Chick flapped its wings. Its phoenix flames burgeoned as every golden feather spewed out golden phoenix flames, instantly melting Chick’s body.

A huge golden flaming phoenix appeared, flapping within the monster’s mouth. Space seemed to distort as Chick slid out of its mouth the instant the monster closed it.

Its actions were extremely elegant and light. It didn’t seem fast, but it managed to escape the monster’s lightning-like bite.

The monster’s figure rushed out of the liquid. Its body was like a rainbow-colored glass whale. It had horns on its head and wings on its back. It looked strange and beautiful.

Although it was huge, it didn’t appear bloated. Its contours were smooth as they exuded indescribable power.

Chick dodged the monster’s bite and circled around the flames. The surrounding flames condensed towards its body, causing the phoenix flames on its body to burn brighter and brighter.

It went from slow to fast, from stillness to movement, from grace to swiftness. Instantly, Chick’s speed increased to its limits. It was like a golden blade of light that crisscrossed the monster.

Chick appeared behind the monster, and a long golden burn mark appeared on its abdomen, as though it was a melted magma dyke.

Nicely done! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Chick’s strike seemed to have sliced open the monster’s abdomen. The monster had probably been severely injured.

Zhou Wen saw the monster’s flames burn as the wound on its abdomen rapidly healed the very next second. It flapped its wings and infinite flames rose, forming a huge flaming barrier that enveloped the nearby area.

The barrier’s range was too large. It was already too late by the time Zhou Wen realized it. His body was trapped in the barrier as the energy inside constantly erupted. It was as though countless hydrogen bombs were exploding as they filled the area with light blasts.

Bang!

Zhou Wen’s body slammed into the barrier as the Prisoned Dragon armor turned redder. If not for its Absolute Defense, it would have long been destroyed.

What level is this fellow at? Just the power in the domain is already so terrifying! Zhou Wen used spatial instant transmission to rush out of the barrier to avoid the outcome of both armor and human dying.

Thankfully, this barrier can’t block spatial powers. Zhou Wen stood outside the barrier domain and could still sense the terrifying energy inside.

The fire phoenix formed by Chick constantly danced in the light, leaving behind golden phantoms that constantly flashed around the monster. It left a long burn mark on the monster every time.

However, as fire-elemental creatures, the monster’s fire-elemental immunity and self-healing abilities were equally terrifying. The injuries Chick left on its body weren’t enough to injure it.

After the monster unleashed the barrier, it stopped attacking Chick. It floated in the barrier and allowed Chick to attack it.

However, the barrier constantly shrank. As the barrier shrank, Chick’s range of activity decreased, and the energy blast within the barrier intensified.

If one looked at it with their naked eyes, the barrier was like a miniature sun, and it was a miniature sun that was constantly shrinking.

Zhou Wen realized that Chick’s situation wasn’t going south. Chick looked very strong, but it ultimately hadn’t reached the Calamity grade.

The reason Chick could exchange blows with the monster was that it was a phoenix with a top-notch fire-elemental bloodline. This could almost be considered its home ground. The monster also had fire-elemental powers, so Chick was immune to its fire-elemental powers. It could even absorb them, allowing it to fight the monster.

The problem was that no matter how strong Chick was, it was still much weaker without entering the Calamity grade. If it was imprisoned, it would be impossible for it to fight the monster head-on.

Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and threw them at the barrier.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors instantly cut a hole in the barrier and rushed into it, but the hole in the barrier was immediately filled with flames.

None of this was important to Zhou Wen. His target wasn’t the barrier to begin with, but the unknown monster.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors transformed into a golden beam that slashed at the rainbow-colored glass-like monster. With a crack, the monster’s massive body couldn’t withstand the Golden Wyrm Scissors. It was sliced into two.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors is too amazing! Zhou Wen was gratified. It was worth combining the three Calamity-grade creatures.

However, Zhou Wen immediately realized that something was amiss. The monster had been sliced into two, but the barrier domain didn’t vanish. Furthermore, it was still shrinking. This meant that the monster wasn’t dead.

Indeed, large amounts of flames spewed out from the monster’s severed body. The flames on both sides intertwined, causing its body to fuse together again.

“Golden Wyrm Scissors, kill it.” Zhou Wen ordered the Golden Wyrm Scissors to attack again.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors was activated again as they transformed into golden beams of light that slashed at the monster.

The monster didn’t dodge. The Golden Wyrm Scissors snipped off its head into two, but still failed to kill it. Its head quickly fused again.

Chick also used its wings to attack the monster again and again. The blade- like wings left wounds on the monster’s body, but they quickly recovered.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown. The Golden Wyrm Scissors was very powerful, but due to the limitations of his Essence Energy, he could only produce a maximum of three Clean Breaks when he used all his strength. Then, he needed time to recover his Essence Energy

He had already used Clean Break twice in a short period of time. If he still couldn’t kill the monster with a final strike, he could only give up. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As Zhou Wen was in thought, the Golden Wyrm Scissors had already used all its strength to slice apart the monster’s tail using their third Clean Break.
