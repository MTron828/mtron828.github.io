The chick stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and looked around curiously.

However, the antelope looked listless; it didn’t seem to like walking.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush. This trip was also a form of training. He planned on taking a look at all the dimensional zones along the way. He planned on taking a picture of all the dimensional zones with the tiny palm symbol to prepare for a full-scale break-out of dimensional zones in the future.

Ancient Sword Tomb was in Imperial Capital. Zhou Wen could also take this chance to visit Wang Lu and repay his debt.

Imperial Capital was also known as Capital. Unlike the Holy City that was jointly controlled by the six families, Imperial Capital was basically controlled by the Xia family. However, to everyone’s surprise, the Special Inspector Bureau’s headquarters was also in Imperial Capital, not Holy City.

Zhou Wen had plans of making a trip to the bureau’s headquarters on his visit to the Imperial Capital.

As many roads were blocked by dimensional zones, all he could do was circle around them. He had to travel further. Even with Zhou Wen’s present strength, he didn’t dare barge into unexplored dimensional zones to prevent any accidents.

The route Zhou Wen chose was the one An Sheng had planned for him. Although it was a little further, it was safe and reliable.

After carefully studying the information, the first relatively famous dimensional zone he encountered was called Five Dragons Mouth.

It was originally a scenic spot. After the dimensional storms, the Five Dragons Mouth turned into a complicated, stacked dimensional zone that had multiple dimensional zones within.

One of the most famous dimensional zones of the Five Dragons Mouth was called Mount Confucius. There was a Teacher Square in the western Mount Confucius, and Mount Laojun was in the east. Legend had it that the Confucian and Daoist families had competed here, leaving behind many moving tales.

After the dimensional storms, Mount Confucius became even stranger. One could often hear the sound of reading from Teacher Square, but when one really looked over, there wasn’t a single soul.

There was also Arrow Atop. It was the highest peak of Five Dragons Mouth. It had many legends related to Hou Yi.

There were also other dimensional zones that had their own specialties. Zhou Wen planned on heading to the Five Dragons Mouth to take a look. If he could download the dimensional zones, it wouldn’t be bad to keep them for future research.

Worm Dugu didn’t know that Zhou Wen had left Luoyang, so he went to look for him early in the morning.

“Master, are you awake? I’m here to pay my respects to you. When are you free? Teach me, your disciple, how to raise a phoenix.” In order to learn the way to raise a phoenix, Worm Dugu didn’t care about his reputation at all. He kept using the words, “master” and “disciple,” without any hesitation.

“Why are you making such a din so early in the morning?” Li Xuan walked out of Zhou Wen’s dorm.

Before Zhou Wen left, he got Li Xuan to take all the food in the fridge to prevent it from spoiling.

“Who are you? Where’s my master?” Worm Dugu glared at Li Xuan.

“How would I know who your master is?” Li Xuan sized up Worm Dugu and saw that the old man was already in his seventies or eighties. To think he still had a master.

“You walked out of my master’s dorm, and you still say that you don’t know who my master is?” said Worm Dugu.

“Zhou Wen is your master?” Li Xuan widened his mouth as he sized up Worm Dugu in disbelief.

Zhou Wen was only seventeen or eighteen years old. How could he have such an old disciple?

“That’s right. Zhou Wen is my master. Has he woken up?” Worm Dugu said matter-of-factly.

“If Zhou Wen is your master, then wouldn’t I, Zhou Wen’s classmate, be your martial uncle? Disciple-Nephew, there’s no need to continue shouting. Zhou Wen has gone out and isn’t on campus,” Li Xuan joked.

Worm Dugu narrowed his eyes. He recognized Zhou Wen as his master because he wanted to learn how to rear a phoenix from Zhou Wen. It didn’t mean that others could use him as a joke.

“Sure. That depends on whether you have the fortune to be my martial uncle.” Worm Dugu remained unperturbed as he secretly released a Black Blood Gu, hoping to teach Li Xuan a lesson.

However, when the Black Blood Gu crawled to Li Xuan’s side, it suddenly stopped moving. It sprawled on the ground and trembled. No matter how the Worm Dugu urged it, the Black Blood Gu didn’t dare approach Li Xuan.

“Eh?” Worm Dugu was slightly taken aback. He had never encountered such a situation.

He summoned a few more Gu, but the moment they approached Li Xuan, they immediately curled up in horror, not daring to touch him.

Worm Dugu wore a look of surprise. What’s going on? Why are my Gu worms afraid of him? Does he have a phoenix too?

...

Zhou Wen continued forward and didn’t encounter any danger. Along the way, he saw a Companion Beast caravan that transported goods.

As motor transportation became increasingly difficult, many transportation companies had chosen to use Companion Beasts to transport goods.

He successfully arrived at Five Dragons Mouth. Zhou Wen walked along the mountain path, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol. After searching for a long time, he didn’t find it.

Instead, he saw many people fighting a monkey-type dimensional creature. The monkey was muscular and had a short tail. It looked rather ferocious.

Zhou Wen took a look at the information and knew that this dimensional creature was called a macaque. It was a relatively common dimensional creature at Five Dragons Mouth. There were many of them, and they were typically at the Mortal stage. Occasionally, one could see a Legendary Monkey King. Legend had it that the macaque here had the bloodline of the Handsome Monkey King. He didn’t know if it was true.

The Macaque King’s combat strength was considered quite powerful among Legendaries. Furthermore, the Macaque King Companion Beast’s companion form was very special, giving it a rather high value. The nearby Legendaries would often come here to hunt the Macaque King, hoping to gain something.

Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in hunting the Macaque King. He just searched for the tiny palm symbol.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen heard a strange sound coming from a nearby mountain. It sounded like children reading textbooks. The sound was drawn out, making it sound odd.

However, those voices were clearly not children’s voices. They were the voices of adults.

Zhou Wen looked at the source of the sound and then at the map. He immediately knew that it was the legendary Teacher Square.

The legends are true. There’s actually the sound of reading in broad daylight at Teacher Square. Zhou Wen’s interest was piqued as he walked towards Teacher Square to see what was so magical about it.

However, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he reached Teacher Square and saw the scene in front of him.

There were many people sitting on Teacher Square. They were all twirling their heads as they read. The voice Zhou Wen had heard wasn’t a phenomenon, but a result of actual people reading.

These people were engrossed in their reading. They twirled their heads and read loudly, as though they were primary school students who were seriously reciting their textbooks. They also resembled scholars from ancient times. Their voices were especially charming as they dragged out their last words.

Could this be a reading activity that’s hosted here? Zhou Wen thought as he climbed onto Teacher Square.

However, just as he stepped onto Teacher Square, he couldn’t help but open his mouth and emit the same voices as the others. He began reading with them, but he had never heard the content that he was reading.

There’s something odd about this place! Zhou Wen was alarmed.
