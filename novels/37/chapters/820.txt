Chapter 821: Six-Winged Seraphim’s New Master

Translator: CKtalon

Seeing the way the soldiers looked at Zhou Wen, An Jing felt mixed emotions. It was something she wanted but couldn’t obtain.

Zhou Wen, I’ll surprise you this time, An Jing thought.

Even Qin Wufu came out to take a look when he heard the commotion. When he realized that it was Zhou Wen, he got someone to call him over.

“Little Zhou, have you thought it through and decided to join us as a soldier?” Qin Wufu poured a cup of water for Zhou Wen.

“I heard that the six-winged seraphim appeared near the Qihe River, so I came to take a look. Will it be possible for you to get someone to take me there?” Zhou Wen asked.

“That’s easy, but that six-winged seraphim’s strength is extremely terrifying. I don’t know if he’s friend or foe. If we encounter him, you have to be careful.” Qin Wufu exhorted before saying to his adjutant, “Call Little Jing over.”

“Governor, are you looking for An Jing?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“That’s right. You are family. She’s currently in charge of monitoring that area. She’s the perfect choice to take you there,” Qin Wufu said.

“There’s no need to trouble her. Just find a soldier to take me there.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to get into trouble with An Jing.

“It’s not trouble at all. It’s her job,” Qin Wufu said with a smile.

Seeing that the adjutant had already left, Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else. After all, it wasn’t a big deal to just lead the way.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that An Jing wouldn’t be willing to take him, but to his surprise, after An Jing came and listened to Qin Wufu’s orders. She didn’t make any outlandish show of expression. She was like an ordinary soldier who chose to carry out orders.

From the looks of it, she hasn’t come to the military for nothing. She has indeed matured and is no longer as childish as before. Zhou Wen felt that this trip wouldn’t be troublesome when he saw An Jing treating him like an ordinary person.

The two of them left the encampment and An Jing led Zhou Wen all the way to the Qihe River.

An Jing didn’t say much on the way, but Zhou Wen was happy with that as well. He had no intention of making small talk with her.

However, Zhou Wen soon discovered a problem. According to the intelligence, the location of the six-winged seraphim was near the Qihe River, but An Jing had already reached the nearby mountains and was a little far from the Qihe River.

“Didn’t the six-winged seraphim appear near the Qihe River? Why are we in the mountains?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to ask.

“You are looking for the six-winged seraphim, right?” An Jing asked expressionlessly.

“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded.

“There’s no mistake then. Just follow me.” An Jing continued leading the way, but she thought to herself, You never expected me to be the current owner of the six-winged seraphim, right? Although you once defeated John, who possessed the six-winged seraphim, John was unable to use the true strength of a six-winged seraphim. And I can already use more than 90% of the six-winged seraphim’s strength. It should be enough to fight you.

Seeing how confident An Jing was, Zhou Wen continued following her into the mountain.

After walking for quite some time, An Jing finally stopped at a cave. She guessed that even if a battle happened here, the camp wouldn’t be able to hear anything.

“Have we arrived? Did the six-winged seraphim appear nearby?” Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find any traces.

Truth Listener was activated the entire time, but there was no sign of the six-winged seraphim nearby.

“Yes, the six-winged seraphim is here,” An Jing said, pretending to be calm.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen had already noticed that An Jing’s tone was odd.

Holy light rose from An Jing’s body as white feathers condensed, forming a six-winged seraphim that floated behind her. It was the six-winged seraphim Zhou Wen had seen before.

“So you are the new contractor of the six-winged seraphim.” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.

He had come to kill the six-winged seraphim, but now, the six-winged seraphim was An Jing’s Guardian. It didn’t seem right for Ouyang Lan to know that he had killed her Guardian.

“Ever since I joined the military, I’ve been working hard. I work when others are working, and I train hard to make myself stronger when others are resting. Now, I’m at the same starting point as you. I have an Epic Perfect Life Soul, a Mythical Companion Beast, and a Guardian. What you have, I already have. Now, we can have a fair battle,” An Jing said to Zhou Wen.

“Did The Thearch help you contract the six-winged seraphim?” Zhou Wen asked An Jing.

“You know The Thearch?” An Jing was slightly taken aback. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Zhou Wen immediately smiled bitterly when he heard An Jing’s reply. “I’d rather not know her. Does she have any conditions for helping you contract the six-winged seraphim?”

“This has nothing to do with you,” An Jing said.

“It’s true that your matter has nothing to do with me, but you are Sis Lan’s daughter. I don’t wish for Sis Lan to be sad, so I hope you understand that The Thearch is a very dangerous person. Think about John’s outcome and you should know what kind of person she is,” Zhou Wen said.

An Jing looked at Zhou Wen and said, “You don’t have to worry about my mother. I’m already an adult. I know what needs to be done and what shouldn’t be done. I didn’t agree to do anything for The Thearch. She didn’t ask me to do anything for her either. Her only request was for me to try my best to clinch first place in the next Companion Beast ranking battle and obtain a divine fruit for her.”

“In that case, you obtained a Mythical Companion Beast in Chess Mountain, right?” Zhou Wen never expected The Thearch to place so much importance on the divine fruit. She didn’t manage to obtain it from him and instead got An Jing to do it.

“How did you know?” An Jing was even more surprised.

“Because The Thearch came to me before, but I rejected her. She’s too dangerous. It’s best not to have anything to do with her,” Zhou Wen said truthfully.

“If one wants to become stronger, one naturally has to take the risk. I know what choice to make. There’s no need for you to teach me.” An Jing looked at Zhou Wen and slowly said, “Regardless of victory or defeat today, the grudge between us ends here.”

“Do you really have to fight me?” Zhou Wen asked An Jing.

“Of course. Otherwise, why would I train so hard? I have to beat you this time,” An Jing said.

“Even if it means losing the Guardian?” Zhou Wen asked again.

This time, without waiting for An Jing to answer, the six-winged seraphim said, “The only one who can defeat a Guardian is a Guardian. Last time, John was too weak and couldn’t even use a tenth of my strength. Now, with An Jing as my Guardian, my true strength can be exhibited. You have no chance of winning. An Jing’s compatibility with me is virtually perfect, so I won’t betray her.”

The six-winged seraphim had clearly misunderstood, believing Zhou Wen meant that he would betray An Jing like he had betrayed John.
