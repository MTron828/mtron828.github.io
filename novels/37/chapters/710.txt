Chapter 711: Snatching Blood, Condensing Soul

Translator: CKtalon

He attempted to get Doctor Darkness to attach himself to the blood-colored avatar as a soul. Zhou Wen immediately felt his physical attributes increase, especially his left hand. After advancing to the Mythical stage, the Golden Left Hand Life Providence augmented Zhou Wen’s left hand even more.

After using all of Doctor Darkness’s skills, he realized that the effects of his skills had increased significantly. Fight Poison With Poison’s poison became even more potent. A single milliliter of poison could instantly kill an Epic creature, even when it was a venomous creature like the Chi.

The destructive power of Scalpel became stronger and it was sharper.

The enhancement of the Eyes of Penetration was the greatest. The ability to see through things had been enhanced. It wasn’t as troublesome as before; yet, the effects had increased significantly. It was very easy to see through every minute detail inside a creature’s body.

As long as Zhou Wen used the Eyes of Penetration, he could see the creatures’ meridians and blood vessels clearly. However, he could only see through lifeforms; his ability to see through objects like metal was very poor.

All that’s left is to experiment with Darkness Right Hand. If everything goes well, I might be able to enter Ant City and obtain the blood of that Guardian. Zhou Wen was somewhat excited.

Since Darkness Right Hand could dig out hearts across space, it might be able to dig out a Guardian’s heart. When that happened, it wouldn’t just be a drop of blood.

After waiting for twenty-four hours, it was finally time for Darkness Right Hand to be used again. Zhou Wen got Doctor Darkness to possess the blood-colored avatar and he carefully studied the abilities of Darkness Right Hand.

After Zhou Wen experienced it personally, he concluded that Darkness Right Hand was indeed extremely powerful. It augmented his right hand’s speed greatly. At the same time, this augmentation wasn’t on speed alone, it also had the ability to pass through matter.

From his tests, there was nothing that could block or prevent Darkness Right Hand from entering.

The ability of Darkness Right Hand didn’t only remove organs. As long as it was a region the right hand could enter, it could pluck anything.

However, Darkness Right Hand also had a flaw. Just like the Poison Dragon Palm, it required the palm to touch the opponent’s body to be of use. This skill couldn’t be used as a long-range attack.

I thought I could pluck hearts from afar using my right hand to reach into the Guardian’s body. I wonder if I can do it with the speed of Darkness Right Hand? Zhou Wen wasn’t confident.

Although Darkness Right Hand was very fast, the Guardian of Ant City was also extremely fast.

Even if there’s no way to pluck the Guardian’s heart, the ability of Darkness Right Hand is very useful. If a dimensional creature like Primordial Spore invades the body and can’t be resolved with Fight Poison With Poison, I can rely on Darkness Right Hand to extract it from the body. Also, this ability is undoubtedly a divine skill for doctors. Surgery can be performed without cutting up bodies. Unfortunately, I’m not a doctor.

Zhou Wen gave his last usage of Darkness Right Hand to Medusa.

After Medusa respawned, Zhou Wen entered Medusa’s palace. This time, he didn’t get Demonic Neonate to help. With the speed of Darkness Right Hand, he managed to pluck out her heart before Medusa’s Demon God Transformation.

Unfortunately, Medusa didn’t drop a Companion Egg this time. All she dropped was a Speed Crystal.

With my hand’s speed, I might really have a chance of obtaining the blood of a Guardian. I don’t need a heart. Just a drop of blood will be enough. Zhou Wen felt hope again.

After waiting for another twenty-four hours so that Darkness Right Hand could be used again, Zhou Wen entered Ant City and arrived at the familiar ant nest.

With the Golden Flying Ant easily killed, Zhou Wen arrived in front of the Guardian cocoon. However, this time, he had no intention of cracking open the cocoon. Instead, he got Doctor Darkness to possess him and directly used the Eyes of Penetration.

With his penetrative vision, Zhou Wen immediately saw the situation inside the cocoon.

The Guardian was curled up in the cocoon. Her body was already rather mature, and the thin wings on her back had completely taken form. Her body emitted a strange glow.

The Guardian sensed that she was being looked at and moved.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare hesitate as he used Darkness Right Hand. His right hand seemed to be enveloped by a devilish power as it instantly vanished.

Zhou Wen felt that everything in front of his right hand seemed to turn to water. His right hand easily passed through the cocoon and reached for the Guardian’s heart.

Darkness Right Hand was just too fast, but the Guardian opened her eyes first and grabbed at it. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, the Guardian missed as Darkness Right Hand passed through her palm.

Changing his plans, Zhou Wen didn’t aim for her heart. He directly took a drop of blood from her palm and quickly retracted.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen retracted his Darkness Right Hand and switched to Lost Country. He teleported to distance himself before rushing out of Ant City at full speed.

Boom!

Just as Zhou Wen rushed out of Ant City, the underground space in Ant City exploded, instantly turning into ruins.

Not daring to turn his head, he controlled the blood-colored avatar to run as he circulated the First Order of Chaos, the drop of blood in hand. He hoped to see if he could absorb it.

The drop of blood was immediately absorbed when the First Order of Chaos circulated. As the First Order of Chaos circulated, it gradually underwent a strange change.

Can I finally condense a Life Soul? In that case, I might be able to rehatch the Invisibility Cloak’s Companion Egg. After Zhou Wen absorbed the blood, he switched instance dungeons to prevent the Guardian from chasing after him.

The First Order of Chaos constantly circulated. With the drop of Guardian’s blood as its foundation, it fused with Zhou Wen’s essence, vitality, and spirit, nurturing a strange power.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that the First Order of Chaos would be similar to the Life Soul condensed by the Dao Sutra. After all, both of them used the blood of the same Guardian. Furthermore, the type of Essence Energy Art was very similar.

However, when the First Order of Chaos truly condensed a Life Soul, Zhou Wen realized that his guess wasn’t accurate. Although the two shared similarities, they were two different Essence Energy Arts after all.

Boom!

Zhou Wen’s essence, vitality, and spirit, as well as Essence Energy fused together. Like a terrifying explosion, it made Zhou Wen’s body and mind tremble.

In the next second, Zhou Wen realized that the blood-colored avatar’s body had turned into an egg.

No, it wasn’t that the blood-colored avatar had turned into an egg, but that a barrier that resembled an eggshell had formed around it.

An eggshell? What Life Soul is this? Zhou Wen felt odd as he looked at the information on his phone. He saw the words “Chaos Egg” written in his Life Soul column.

It’s really an egg! Zhou Wen was somewhat curious. He didn’t know what special effects the Chaos Egg Life Soul would have.
