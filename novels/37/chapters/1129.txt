Chapter 1130: Nirvana

Zhou Wen could clearly see that the white figure that came out of the ancient well was a woman with silver hair and eyes like the moon.

In the woman’s arms was a saber. The hilt and scabbard were pitch-black, forming a stark contrast to her white clothes.

The woman’s expression was cold. She looked at Fang Mingsu, who was fighting the four Terror-grade creatures, as though she was looking at a dead person.

Fang Mingsu completely unleashed the power of a Guardian. Just as he gained the upper hand—

The saber in the silver-haired, white-robed woman’s arms suddenly moved. Zhou Wen only saw a saber flash. Even with his eyesight, he couldn’t see the trajectory of the saber clearly. All he saw was a crescent blade flash before his eyes. In the next second, the phoenix-like Fang Mingsu was sent flying.

Boom!

Fang Mingsu crashed to the ground. The golden armor on his body shattered. The Terror-grade Guardian armor was completely destroyed.

On Fang Mingsu’s chest, a bone-deep wound could be seen. Blood was rapidly gushing out.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, after Fang Mingsu’s armor shattered, the clothes were also mostly destroyed. What appeared in his vision was a female body.

Fang Mingsu is a woman? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

Although Fang Mingsu looked a little delicate, her actions were very masculine. Furthermore, Ji Moqing kept calling her brother-in-law. Zhou Wen hadn’t read too much into it.

He never expected Ji Moqing’s brother-in-law to be a woman.

When Zhou Wen looked at Ji Moqing, he realized that she was also alarmed. She stared at Fang Mingsu with widened eyes as though she couldn’t believe it.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to figure out why Fang Mingsu was a woman. He pulled Ji Moqing and teleported away.

Regardless of whether Fang Mingsu was a woman or a man, she was doomed. Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t take the risk to save her. Escape was the most important thing now.

Now, Zhou Wen hoped that the dimensional creature that had crawled out of the ancient well would quickly leave Earth and head to space like Sei Gasakai had said.

However, Zhou Wen soon realized gloomily that the woman didn’t continue pursuing the heavily injured Fang Mingsu. She had cast her gaze at Zhou Wen and walked towards him.

As the entire island was enveloped by spatial rifts, Zhou Wen was unable to teleport out. All he could do was teleport elsewhere on the island and distance himself from the woman.

After Zhou Wen teleported out, he was immediately alarmed to discover that the woman had already arrived in front of him. She was looking at him with her emotionless eyes.

Zhou Wen immediately teleported again. Furthermore, he constantly teleported. After teleporting a few times, Zhou Wen saw the situation in front of him clearly. His heart chilled as goosebumps rose all over his body.

That woman actually appeared in front of him again and looked at him coldly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

I’ve been trapped for too long. I actually forgot that something happens every time I enter a dimensional zone. If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have come to this darn place even if I’d be beaten to death. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed as he threw Shiraishi Satomi and Ji Moqing in different directions, allowing them to escape.

As for Zhou Wen himself, he knew that he had been targeted by the strange dimensional creature in front of him. Since he couldn’t escape Bride Island, he could only risk his life.

Thankfully, Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy had already recovered while he was trapped. With the Mourning Stick and Immortal Culling Sword still around, Zhou Wen didn’t lack the capital to go all out.

Boom!

Zhou Wen’s aura erupted as Great Brahma appeared in front of him. The Mourning Stick also appeared in his hand.

Immortal Culling Sword was too dangerous. He would basically be crippled with each use. Even if he could kill this terrifying female dimensional creature, Zhou Wen might not be able to escape alive.

Now, Zhou Wen wanted to stall for time, hoping that she would lose her patience and leave Earth as soon as possible.

After Ji Moqing was sent flying by Zhou Wen, she gritted her teeth and ran in the direction where Fang Mingsu had fallen. Although she knew that Fang Mingsu was probably doomed, she still wanted to take a look.

After Shiraishi Satomi landed, she didn’t choose to escape. Instead, she held her blade as though she wanted to put her life on the line.

“Don’t come over. You will only affect my battle.” Zhou Wen’s voice dispelled her intention to immediately attack. However, she didn’t plan on escaping. She continued searching for opportunities nearby.

The woman suspected to be at the Calamity Grade stared at Zhou Wen as she slowly walked over. It was unknown when the saber in her arms would be unsheathed.

Suddenly, golden phoenix flames rose from Fang Mingsu’s direction.

Fang Mingsu, whose Guardian armor was almost completely shattered, was surrounded by a group of dimensional creatures. Just as she was about to be dismembered, terrifying phoenix flames suddenly erupted around her. Any dimensional creature that approached Fang Mingsu was burned to ashes. Even Yuki Onna and the other three Terror-grade creatures suffered some injuries and retreated far away to dodge the phoenix flames.

A phoenix cry resounded through the clouds. The phoenix flames that filled the sky transformed into a Phoenix that circled around Fang Mingsu a few times before flying towards her body.

As the Fire Phoenix fused into her body, the shattered Guardian armor on Fang Mingsu’s body rapidly recovered amidst phoenix flames. Soon, it formed brand new golden armor.

Fang Mingsu was bathed in phoenix flames. The power that erupted from her body was even stronger than back when she had given her all.

Boom!

Fang Mingsu’s figure flew across the sky like a Phoenix. She was unbelievably fast.

Daitengu was actually unable to dodge her punch. Under its forceful resistance, it was sent flying by Fang Mingsu’s punch. The clothes on its body and the feathers on its back burned. Daitengu circulated its strength, but it was unable to extinguish the phoenix flames on its body.

In the end, it could only cut off the burning part in a sacrificial act.

Yuki Onna, Hashihime, and Umibōzu all surrounded her, but this time, their siege seemed even more powerless in front of Fang Mingsu. In just a moment, they were beaten back by her.

Firstly, it was because the phoenix flames were very effective against ghost-type dimensional creatures. Secondly, it was because after her Guardian armor underwent Nirvana Rebirth, the might it could produce was much stronger than before.

Among those who could become strong in such a way, Li Xuan was an example Zhou Wen had seen before Fang Mingsu.

However, she was different from Li Xuan. Fang Mingsu couldn’t learn the techniques of others. Her strengthening only made her Guardian armor stronger.

The woman suspected to be a Calamity seemed to be attracted by Fang Mingsu’s gaze as she didn’t continue walking towards Zhou Wen.

On the other side, Fang Mingsu had beaten back the Yuki Onna and the others. She began a massacre as though she had entered a no man’s land. The phoenix flames on her body became more and more intense, almost turning half of Bride Island into a sea of flames.

Ji Moqing couldn’t help but be overjoyed when she saw that not only was Fang Mingsu still alive, but that she had become even stronger.

However, before she could run over, Fang Mingsu had already charged towards the woman who was suspected to be a Calamity with a sea of flames.
