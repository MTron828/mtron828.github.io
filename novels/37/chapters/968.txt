Chapter 969: The Remnants of Terror Creatures

Translator: CKtalon

“No way?” Zhou Wen found it unlikely.

“Let’s search. Who knows?” Li Xuan began searching the dragon’s lair.

Zhou Wen originally thought that there was no hope, but to his surprise, Li Xuan found something.

“There really is one. Look here. There’s also the same ice as the bottom of the blue cave.” Li Xuan’s voice sounded from inside the dragon lair.

Zhou Wen went over to take a look and indeed, he realized that there was a thick layer of ice in the stone cave. There was an ice-blue glow inside.

“That does seem to be the case.” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he got Crab Sovereign to dig up the ice layer. At the same time, he said, “If there’s also the same tooth here, it means this matter won’t be that simple.”

Li Xuan nodded. “The Sea Dragon King is afraid of the cold, so it’s possible that the tooth was put there to suppress it, but this Evil Dragon isn’t afraid of the cold. There’s no reason to put one here.”

With that said, Li Xuan’s eyes suddenly lit up. “By the way, didn’t you say that the seven dragon monarchs are the concubines of the Seven Seas Dragon King? Do you think this tooth is a token the Seven Seas Dragon King gave to his concubines? Something similar to the tooth having the same authority and presence as the dragon?”

“How would I know? Let’s wait until we dig it out.” Zhou Wen shook his head helplessly.

Soon, the Crab Sovereign dug out something else. It wasn’t the tooth they had imagined. Instead, it was a bone that looked like a rib. However, it had a broken section. It didn’t look complete.

Although it was a bone, it was similar to the tooth. They were both ice-blue and crystalline. It was obvious that they originated from the same creature.

“The Seven Seas Dragon King probably wouldn’t remove his rib to use as a love token, right?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the rib.

“From the looks of it, the tooth and rib are unlikely to belong to the Seven Seas Dragon King. However, apart from the Seven Seas Dragon King, are there any other Terror-grade creatures in the Seven Seas? Why are the things from its body in the two dragon monarchs’ nests?” Li Xuan stroked his chin in thought.

“We can go to the other dragon monarchs to take a look. Perhaps there’s something similar in their lairs. If that’s the case, it will really be interesting,” Zhou Wen said.

“Why?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.

“I heard that deities were born because of humanity’s fear. Therefore, as long as human fear remains, deities are immortal existences that will never die. That’s also the origins for the Terror grade.”

Zhou Wen paused for a moment before continuing, “I don’t know if the legend is real or fake, but from the looks of it, there’s still a terrifying Terror form power on the tooth and bone. If we can really find all its bones, do you think it will suddenly revive?”

“Don’t scare me. If we ended up killed after going through great trouble to find the bones and teeth, wouldn’t that make us look stupid?” Li Xuan said.

“If there really are more parts in the other dragon monarchs’ lairs, do you think we should dig them up or not?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.

“We dig. Of course we have to dig. These Terror form teeth and bones must be extremely high in value. If every dragon monarch has some Terror form item, we just won’t dig them all out. I often see on television that those devils who want to revive need to find their bodies. As long as their bodies aren’t complete, they can’t be revived,” Li Xuan said with a smile.

“That makes sense.” Zhou Wen didn’t care. At most, he would put them all into the chaos space.

Even if the owner of the teeth and bones really revived, they wouldn’t be able to cause any trouble in the chaos space.

If something major really happened, Zhou Wen could get the owner of the bones to meet the ice maiden who was trapped in the Chaos Bead and let them fight to the death.

Therefore, the two of them went to another few dimensional zones and avoided some terrifying taboos along the way. Soon, the two of them killed two more dragon monarchs. In the end, they really found something similar at the two dragon monarchs’ lairs.

They found a crystal-like strand of hair in one lair and a broken horn in another. They were also cold and crystalline. It likely originated from the same creature as the tooth and bone from before.

“Why do I feel like we are villain minions trying to revive a demon king?” Li Xuan said with an odd expression.

“How can we be villains? When villains revive a demon king, they have righteous protagonists who try their best to stop them. How can there be villains as successful as us?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“That’s true.” Li Xuan thought for a moment and asked, “Where are we going next?”

“The closest dimensional zone is the Deathwater Zone. It will be troublesome there. The seawater in the Deathwater Zone is affected by the dimensional zone. Any creature that enters will sink. Even if they can fly, it’s useless inside. All they can do is constantly sink. To kill the lobster-like dragon monarch inside, the greatest obstacle is the Deathwater Zone itself,” Zhou Wen said.

“You are good at this. Ya’er and I will wait for you outside,” Li Xuan said.

When they arrived near the Deathwater Zone, Zhou Wen got Crab Sovereign to stay outside to protect Li Xuan and Ya’er while he put on his Invisibility Cloak and entered the Deathwater Zone. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

With the protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, the Deathwater Zone prevented Zhou Wen from drowning. At the same time, Zhou Wen used Grand Turtle Breath to restrain his vitality.

The lobster-like dragon monarch was blind. It could only rely on vital aura to determine the location of other creatures. Zhou Wen’s Grand Turtle Breath could restrain it.

Not only was the water in the Deathwater Zone not black, but it was crystalline, like pure water without any impurities.

There were no dimensional creatures in the water. Apart from the dragon monarch, ordinary dimensional creatures didn’t have the ability to swim in the Deathwater Zone. They were all at the bottom of the sea.

Ordinary people would quickly sink into the Deathwater Zone and be eaten by them.

Zhou Wen naturally didn’t have any qualms. He quickly swam through the Deathwater Zone and easily passed through it under the cover of the Invisibility Cloak and Grand Turtle Breath to find the dragon monarch.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw the dragon monarch. The dragon monarch was much more beautiful than he had imagined.

Although it looked like a lobster, its carapace was crystalline, revealing a mysterious sapphire color. There were countless shimmering streams of light inside.

When it stood still, it was like a sapphire art piece that was illuminated by starlight.

“Miya said that its carapace isn’t only beautiful, but it’s also hard. If I want to kill it, I have to attack from the inside.” Zhou Wen turned invisible and approached the huge lobster. At the same time, he summoned the Ancient Splitting Tadpole and stuffed it into its mouth in the form of a grenade.

Boom!

As the Ancient Splitting Tadpole kept exploding, the lobster’s body kept tumbling. Pieces of flesh spat out from its mouth, but its carapace remained intact.

Ding!

With the lobster’s death, a Companion Egg dropped.
