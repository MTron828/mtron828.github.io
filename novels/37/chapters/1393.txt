Chapter 1394: Sword Immortal

Translator: CKtalon

“Who dares to barge into the Octokind’s land?” The Yaksha and Garuda, who were guarding the Octokind Holy Mountain, immediately berated when they saw an outsider walking towards the Holy Mountain.

The person looked like a man in his thirties, but his hair was white; his white clothes were whiter than snow. He walked over step by step. He clearly walked on the ground, but he gave off the feeling that he was walking on clouds.

It was as if the ground beneath his feet was no longer dirty, but pure white clouds.

The man didn’t answer and continued walking over.

The Yaksha and Garuda were immediately enraged. Those who were sent to guard the Holy Mountain were the cream of the crop among the Octokind. They could be said to be elites, so when had they ever been belittled?

They erupted with Terror-grade power and attacked the white-robed man from both sides.

The white-robed man continued walking forward as though he hadn’t seen them. As for the Yaksha and Garuda, they flew up with tragic cries.

It was as though invisible sword intents flashed, slicing their strength and bodies to pieces, turning them into a rain of blood.

The white-haired man stepped onto the stone steps of the Holy Mountain as though nothing had happened. The spot where he stood was clean and flawless, but behind him was blood-stained yellow sand.

The Yaksha and Garuda’s tragic cries before they died had already alarmed the Octokind on the mountain. Many rushed down the mountain and were enraged when they saw the blood on the ground and the white-haired man who was climbing the mountain.

Many irascible Asuras and Yakshas had already charged at the white-haired man. The sky was filled with a strange light as though countless stars were crashing down at him.

The white-haired man didn’t even raise his eyelids as he continued walking up the stone steps.

Without exception, the Octokind that charged at him were all killed by the invisible sword intent. Sabers, swords, spears, musical instruments, and all sorts of broken weapons were sent flying with bloodied flesh.

Wherever the white-haired man passed, no Octokind survived.

On the huge Holy Mountain, more than ten thousand members of the Octokind had gathered, but no one dared to approach the white-haired man.

With every step the white-haired man took, the Octokind that filled the sky involuntarily retreated. No one dared to resist him.

“We Octokind have always had a good relationship with the Immortals. As a member of the Immortals, why are you slaughtering the creatures of our Octokind? Could it be that the Immortals are violating the dimensional agreement?” A dancing, lute-wielding Gandharva floated in the air and stared at the white-haired man who was ascending the mountain as she asked.

The Immortal ignored her and continued walking up the mountain as though he was deaf.

“I’m talking to you. Didn’t you hear me? I’m the Queen of the Gandharva. If there’s anything you need, you can tell me. If there’s nothing, don’t blame me for being heartless if you take another step forward,” said the Gandharva as her expression turned cold. She hugged her lute and stared at the Immortal.

The Immortal ignored her and continued walking forward.

The Gandharva was immediately enraged. She strummed the strings with her finger, and the resonating music transformed into an invisible killing intent that wrapped around the Immortal.

Crack! Crack!

There was no sword beam or sound of sword beams, but there was an invisible force that minced the music. All the strings on the lute in the Gandharva’s hand snapped at the same time.

The Gandharva was alarmed. It was too late to retreat. She could already sense a terrifying sword intent approaching her. Perhaps she would be beheaded in the next second.

As Queen of the Gandharva, she was a Calamity-grade expert after all. She never expected the other party to force her to such a disadvantageous state without even touching her.

A dragon’s roar resounded through the clouds. Dragon aura that resembled a waterfall cascaded down from the top of the Holy Mountain. It circled around the body of Queen of the Gandharva, as though it was colliding with some divine weapon. The dragon aura instantly shattered.

Thankfully, the sword intent had already vanished. The Queen of the Gandharva hurriedly retreated and distanced herself from the Immortal.

Apart from the monarchs of the Celestials and Dragons, the other six monarchs had already appeared and blocked the Immortal’s path as though they wanted to take him down.

Tens of thousands of Octokind had already rushed over. They surrounded him from all directions. They held weapons in their hands and pointed them at the Immortal.

The tens of thousands of Octokind royalty and six Calamity-grade monarchs didn’t seem to exist in the eyes of the Immortal. He continued walking forward, his gaze fixed on a figure standing at the top of the stairs.

When the six monarchs saw him in such a state, they were enraged as they prepared to kill him.

“Let him pass.” A voice sounded from the top of the stone steps. The person standing there was none other than Wang Mingyuan, who had already become the Dragon King. He was also the one who had saved the Gandharva with his dragon aura.

When the six monarchs heard Wang Mingyuan’s words, they had no choice but to order their men to retreat and make way.

However, the tens of thousands of Octokind were eyeing them covetously from both sides. They were everywhere. If it were an ordinary person, they would probably be terrified.

However, the Immortal didn’t notice anything as he walked towards the top of the stone steps.

“Sir, why are you here?” Wang Mingyuan asked when the Immortal came close. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The Immortal ignored him and walked past him. His fluttering white hair brushed past Wang Mingyuan’s face.

Wang Mingyuan stood there and watched the Immortal walk into the divine temple before sitting down at the main seat.

It was originally the seat of the Lord of the Octokind. Even Di Tian, who had been the leader of the Octokind, wasn’t qualified to sit there. Now, Wang Mingyuan was only taking the deputy’s seat. Only the king of the Exalted which the Octokind relied on had the right to sit there.

Seeing that the Immortal was sitting in that spot, be it the royalty or ordinary members of the Octokind, all of them rushed into the hall to kill the Immortal, but they were stopped by Wang Mingyuan.

“Sir, what do you want?” Wang Mingyuan asked as he looked at the Immortal sitting high on the platform.

“From today on, the Octokind shall be sealed in the mountain for three years. No Octokind shall take half a step out. All who disobey shall be executed.” The Immortal looked down at Wang Mingyuan and continued, “In the past, Damo faced the wall for nine years and finally gained enlightenment on some principles. You don’t have to face the wall. Just stand there and reflect for three years. No matter how slow-witted you are, you should be able to understand something.”

“What gives you the right to dictate that?” The Yaksha King questioned. Instantly, the masses were enraged. Some of the Octokind couldn’t help but rush into the hall.

Just as the battle was about to begin, a blob of golden light tore through the air.

“Supremacy… He…” When the golden light landed, it was a Buddha with a golden glow. Yaksha King and company hurriedly went forward to bow. Before they could say anything, they were cut off by the Buddha.

Buddha walked in front of the Immortal and pressed his palms together. He bowed slightly and said, “Sword Immortal, please calm down. From today onwards, the Octokind will stay sealed for three years. The Dragon King will reflect on himself for three years and will not be allowed to move half a step. Do you have any other requests?

“A disciple of my Sword Immortal lineage can’t die for nothing. The ones who killed him have to pay with their lives.” As the man spoke, he kept looking at Wang Mingyuan.. He knew that Jiang Yan was Wang Mingyuan’s disciple.
