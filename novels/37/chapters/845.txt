Chapter 846: Terror Transformation

Translator: CKtalon

The flames on Goddess Ba’s body surged as Tyrant Behemoth’s huge body immediately transformed into a fireball. Terrifying flames rapidly burned its body. Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t withstand the flames even with its physical strength.

The entire valley plunged into a sea of flames. Due to Banana Fairy blowing out the Supreme Yin Wind, she was barely able to prevent the blood-colored avatar from being burned by the flames.

However, without the augmentation of the Three Realms’ Best Wind, the Supreme Yin Wind was clearly no match for the flames. It was being rapidly devoured by the flames.

Seeing that Tyrant Behemoth was about to be burned to death, Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned Torch Dragon Youngling and used Bright Torch Vision World on Goddess Ba. However, in Torch Dragon Youngling’s eyes, there was only a sea of fire with no sign of Goddess Ba. Goddess Ba stood there without being sucked into the Vision World.

Holy sh*t, what’s this? Even Bright Torch Vision World is useless? Is it because of the Terror form? Zhou Wen was alarmed. Without waiting for him to think further, the sea of flames had already devoured the blood-colored avatar and the game screen went black.

What a terrifying Terror form. Is this the true power of a Terror-grade Mythical creature? Zhou Wen felt that Goddess Ba was the most terrifying creature he had ever seen. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Even the two Guardians of Ant City and the underground sea aren’t that terrifying. I wonder if they have a Terror form. Zhou Wen guessed that they didn’t have one. At the very least, he had never seen them before.

If there is anyone else with a Terror form, it’s probably the one inside the Forbidden City’s log. She might have a Terror form.

The chances of new Guardians who hadn’t come out of the cocoons having a Terror form were relatively low.

How did this Terror form come about? Can Companion Beasts have such a form? Zhou Wen thought about it but couldn’t figure it out.

He suddenly thought of The Thearch and thought to himself, Could The Thearch also have a Terror form?

After some thought, Zhou Wen sent a message to The Thearch: “The Thearch, can I ask you a question? Are you a Terror-grade expert?”

He originally didn’t expect a reply, but The Thearch surprisingly replied shortly after. “Not bad. You even know about the Terror-grade. What else do you know?”

“I also know the existence of the Terror form. You should be an existence at that level, right?” Zhou Wen said after some hesitation.

“A Terror form is nothing. To you humans, the Terror grade means invincibility, but in front of me, the Terror grade is trash,” The Thearch said in contempt. “You must have encountered a fellow with a Terror form. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have asked me.”

“You are wise.” Zhou Wen flattered her, hoping that she would say more.

The Thearch didn’t disappoint and sent another message. “In theory, Mythical creatures with a Terror form are considered true Mythical creatures. However, the Terror form isn’t something all Mythical creatures can possess. It depends on their bloodline talent and comprehension abilities. Typical Guardians can have a Terror form as long as they continue fighting and evolving. However, for dimensional creatures, only the top ones can have a Terror form.”

“What exactly is a Terror form?” Zhou Wen asked.

The Thearch replied, “What do you think the difference between the Mythical stage and the typical Epic and Legendary stages is?”

“Basic stats and Wheel of Destiny,” Zhou Wen said.

“The Wheel of Destiny can indeed allow Mythical creatures to possess a powerful ability, but no matter how powerful it is, it’s only an ability. This isn’t a qualitative difference. From the perspective of dimensional creatures, being able to undergo a Terror transformation is the most important indicator of the differentiation between the levels of creatures. There’s no distinction between Legendary and Epic in dimensional zones because such creatures are too weak. They don’t have the qualifications to be categorized. There are only two ways to be truly categorized. A dimensional creature that can undergo Terror transformation and a dimensional creature that can’t. This is the first level of categorization for dimensional creatures.”

“I still don’t understand what kind of power the Terror form is.” Zhou Wen still didn’t understand.

The Thearch added, “Of course you don’t understand. That’s because that’s the true Mythical realm. If you haven’t reached that realm, you naturally won’t understand. To put it simply, the so-called God is an indescribable thing. It’s an unknown thing that makes humans feel terrified. If humans can defeat creatures with their strength, they won’t be called gods. The Terror form is an indescribable state. After the Terror transformation, no matter how strong a mortal is, it’s impossible for them to injure the body that has undergone Terror transformation. Only a Terror form can defeat a Terror form.”

“Then how can Terror transformation be achieved?” Zhou Wen asked.

“It’s impossible for you humans to undergo Terror transformation. Only by signing a contract with a Guardian and using the Guardian’s power to advance to the Mythical stage will you have the qualifications to undergo a Terror transformation,” The Thearch said.

“Why can’t humans advance to the Mythical stage?” Zhou Wen couldn’t understand why only humans couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage.

“Let me give you an analogy. Don’t you humans have something called comics? The characters in those comics are called two-dimensional creatures by you. As for you humans, you are three-dimensional creatures. No matter how powerful the characters in the comics are, do you think they can become three-dimensional creatures like humans? Of course, this is just an example. It’s not completely accurate, but the actual situation isn’t much different. Therefore, no matter how powerful the characters in the comics are, they can’t injure three-dimensional creatures. As for three-dimensional creatures, they can easily destroy two-dimensional creatures. This is why only the Terror grade can defeat the Terror grade. After the Terror transformation, they are no longer existences on the same level. There’s no comparison,” The Thearch explained.

Is humanity really hopeless? Zhou Wen couldn’t believe that humans couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage. At the very least, Xia Jiuhuang had succeeded, although his methods were very cruel.

The Thearch replied, “Of course there’s hope. Contracting a Guardian or becoming one with a Guardian like Wang Mingyuan. Only these two paths are possible.”

“I’ve seen a human before. He relied on himself to advance to the Mythical stage,” Zhou Wen said.

The Thearch’s reply was filled with contempt. “You’re talking about the one in Forbidden City, right? Do you think that he could have advanced to the Mythical stage by his strength alone if it wasn’t for the help of Starlady Polestar?”

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. Back then, Xia Jiuhuang had indeed used the power in the log to condense the final Life Providence and Life Soul. With the help of the purple lightning, he had advanced to the Mythical stage.

“There are only these two paths for humans. Have you considered which one you want to take? If you want to contract a Guardian, I can help you. I can help you contract an extremely powerful Guardian. It’s definitely not inferior to Starlady Polestar,” The Thearch said.

“I still want to see if I can advance to the Mythical stage with my own strength,” Zhou Wen said.

“Then take your time. It won’t be too late to find me when you reach a dead end.” The Thearch wasn’t angry this time. She seemed to be certain that Zhou Wen couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage with his own strength.
