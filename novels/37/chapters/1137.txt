Chapter 1138: So This Is Free Love

Translator: CKtalon

In the chaotic movie world, the tempest raged on. Dark clouds blotted out the sky as lightning streaked across the sky as waves devoured everything in their path.

However, a human emitted a holy glow as he slowly surfaced from the sea. It was none other than Zhou Wen who had fallen into the sea.

He held Tsukuyomi in one hand and held a mysterious ancient scripture in the other. The words on the ancient scripture emitted a mysterious glow.

Zhou Wen was in the movie world, but the power in the movie world could no longer affect him.

However, this wasn’t the outcome Zhou Wen wanted. He looked at the ancient scripture in his hand as the sutra’s glow intensified, illuminating the entire space.

The dark clouds dispersed as the wind and rain came to a stop. In the mysterious holy light, the humans who had been swept into the sea appeared again as though on rewind. Finally, the huge cruise ship slowly floated up from the bottom of the sea.

The entire timeline in the movie world was rewinding. The mysterious power that had resisted Sasser suddenly vanished, leaving only Sasser’s power and the power of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder at odds with each other.

In the beginning, Sasser wanted to rewind time and turn the plot back to normal.

But now, not only had time rewound to normal, but it was also constantly rewinding. It was almost back at the movie’s beginning.

Sasser wanted to stop it, but he realized that his strength was no longer able to resist the power to rewind time. Despite exerting his full strength, the movie rewound to the beginning. The camera’s screen was covered in snowflakes. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Bam!

The camera that was already producing sparks finally exploded. As the camera exploded, Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi, who were in the movie world, appeared out of thin air.

Almost at the same time as the camera exploded, Sasser spat out a mouthful of blood. His body, which was almost unrecognizable, forcefully transformed into a stream of light and escaped into the movie theater’s large screen that was playing a trailer. Then, he vanished.

Zhou Wen stood on the steps in front of the theater with Tsukuyomi in his arms. The commotion had attracted the attention of many passers-by. At that moment, everyone was staring at Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.

Tsukuyomi, who was being princess-carried by Zhou Wen, slowly opened her eyes as her injuries rapidly healed.

Her expression was gentle as her eyes appeared misted. She looked at Zhou Wen and said shyly, “You saved me. From now on, I’m yours.”

With that said, Tsukuyomi closed her eyes. A charming blush rose on her beautiful face, inevitably making one have evil thoughts.

Although they didn’t know what had happened, everyone around them began clapping when they heard Tsukuyomi’s confession. Some even shouted, “Kiss her!”

Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi and suddenly threw her to the ground.

This action stunned everyone. Tsukuyomi reacted very quickly. Just as she was about to fall to the ground, she blinked and was already standing up.

Zhou Wen left without looking back. Tsukuyomi hurriedly chased after him.

“Holy sh*t, this brother is too awesome. Such a beauty delivered a public confession, but he threw her down without a word. After that, the beauty even chased after him. Why do I never encounter such a good thing?”

“The heavens are truly blind. Why didn’t that beauty take a fancy to me?”

“...”

“Why?” Tsukuyomi chased after him and asked.

“Why? I should be asking you. Do you think I’m a fool? You were the one controlling the movie space, right?” Zhou Wen glared at her.

Previously, Zhou Wen had believed that the dimensional monarchs were attacking him, so he didn’t suspect Tsukuyomi.

However, after shattering the movie world, he realized that the other party was likely at the Terror grade—definitely not the monarchs from the dimension. Otherwise, even if the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder had Terror transformed, it would be impossible for him to shatter the movie world so easily.

Zhou Wen refused to believe that a Terror form Life Soul was able to nearly kill Tsukuyomi.

Tsukuyomi’s eyes narrowed into crescents as she said with a smile, “Didn’t you say that free love requires romance? A hero saving a beauty. Isn’t it romantic enough for a beauty to marry him in return?”

Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless as he looked at Tsukuyomi. He was momentarily at a loss for words. All he could do was shake his head and continue walking forward.

“Is that wrong? I think that’s what you humans say in your stories. I’m certain of it.” Tsukuyomi took out her phone and opened the Qidian app. She read it again and felt that she hadn’t done anything wrong.

“Tell me what I did wrong. I’ll change,” Tsukuyomi followed and asked in all seriousness.

“Please act more realistically next time. Do it in a way that I can’t tell, alright?” Zhou Wen wasn’t able to put across his point clearly, so he gave a patronizing answer.

“So that’s how it is. To deceive the other party without the other party seeing through it. Is this what it means by free love?” Tsukuyomi nodded thoughtfully as though she had gained some insight.

Zhou Wen was rendered speechless when he heard that. He decided to stop telling Tsukuyomi about such pointless matters in the future. It was best not to say anything.

Now, Zhou Wen could tell that Tsukuyomi had no intention of killing him. Furthermore, she seemed to have a request for him.

What do I have that Tsukuyomi wants? Could it be that Heavenly Happiness Token? However, Dragon Girl previously told me that the Heavenly Happiness Token can allow one to escape the restrictions of dimensional zones. Tsukuyomi has long escaped the restrictions of dimensional zones, why would she want the Heavenly Happiness Token? Could it be that it’s not the Heavenly Happiness Token? Zhou Wen thought for a moment but apart from the Heavenly Happiness Token, there didn’t seem to be anything that was worth Tsukuyomi’s efforts.

If she wanted the Immortal Culling Sword or something else, she could just snatch it from him. There was no need for her to marry him. After some thought, only the Heavenly Happiness Token needed Tsukuyomi to do these things because the Heavenly Happiness Token was something useless even if she snatched it.

What’s the Heavenly Happiness Token that Emperor of Shang gave me? Zhou Wen really wanted to go to the dimension to ask Emperor of Shang, but unfortunately, the only path he knew was in Chess Mountain.

The Thearch of Chess Mountain was probably even more difficult to deal with than Tsukuyomi. Zhou Wen didn’t wish to provoke her.

How long can this Tsukuyomi stay on Earth? Zhou Wen secretly paid attention to Tsukuyomi and realized that she was browsing the Internet with her phone—one that Zhou Wen had bought for her.

However, from Tsukuyomi’s relaxed look, it seemed like she wasn’t in a rush to leave.

Could I be wrong? Not all Calamity-grade creatures need to leave Earth? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.

Since he couldn’t escape, Zhou Wen could only get used to it.

With Tsukuyomi on the phone the entire time, he took out his phone and prepared to try the Bloodline function he had activated.

Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate constitute my main combat strength. I can try to add some useful Life Providences for them. If Doctor Darkness and Explosive Fiend Man have some more powerful Life Providences, they can become stronger. Perhaps they might have a chance to advance further. I wonder if there are any Life Providences that can resolve Truth Listener’s problem. Zhou Wen browsed through all the Companion Beasts he had. He didn’t worry about which stage they were in, only looking at their Life Providences. As long as their Life Providences were good enough, it didn’t matter if their levels were low.

After browsing for a while, Zhou Wen discovered many low-leveled Companion Beasts who had very unique Life Providences. They could be said to be fantastic.
