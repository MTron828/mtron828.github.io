Chapter 1639 Identical

In the Li family’s backyard, a beautiful boy crawled through a dog hole and said to another boy, “Laughing Li, do me a favor.”

“What is it?” Laughing Li asked the beautiful boy.

“Bury me in your garden,” the beautiful boy said with a serious expression. “Why?” Laughing Li looked at the beautiful boy expressionlessly as though he wasn’t surprised at all.

If other children heard this, they would definitely be very surprised, even shocked and afraid. However, Laughing Li was an exception. This was because he knew the beautiful boy in front of him. He knew that there was no need to be surprised at anything he did because he definitely had his reasons.

If it didn’t make sense, then it must be that this world didn’t make sense. It definitely wasn’t that the beautiful boy didn’t make sense.

“I want to try to see what it’s like to be a dead person,” the beautiful boy said.

“You will really be a dead person if you’re buried,” Laughing Li curled his lips and said. “I won’t; I’ve already learned the breathing catheter. As long as I’m not buried too deep, I won’t die.” The beautiful boy ran to a small clearing in the garden and grabbed a handful of soil. He shook it and said, “They won’t let me try it at home. I can only try it at your place. Quickly come and bury me.”

Laughing Li walked over expressionlessly and dug away the soil with the beautiful boy.

It was originally used to plant Chinese roses, but it was temporarily empty because they hadn’t bought a suitable species.

The two of them dug a pit that was about two feet deep. The beautiful boy entered the pit to have a feeling of it. The length was suitable, so he said to Laughing Li, “Laughing Li, find a bamboo tube and stick it in my mouth. Then, bury me. I’ll use the bamboo tube to breathe…” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After a long time, the two of them finally buried the beautiful boy. Only half of the bamboo tube was exposed.

Laughing Li reached out to give it a try. Only when he could sense the breathing through the bamboo tube did he heave a sigh of relief.

Time ticked by. In the beginning, Laughing Li was still very worried. From time to time, he would go over to test to see if the beautiful boy was still breathing; he was afraid there would be none.

However, he later realized that the airflow in the bamboo tube was very rhythmic and long. It was likely not a big problem.

According to their agreement, Laughing Li needed to dig out the boy 72 hours later.

However, on the first night, something strange happened.

Laughing Li was used to sleeping alone from a young age. It wasn’t that he was willing to sleep alone, but he still had two younger brothers whom his mother had to take care of. With them sleeping on each side, he would have nowhere to sleep.

Furthermore, Laughing Li wasn’t someone who would wheedle. He wasn’t too young, so he got his own room early on.

Not long after Laughing Li fell asleep, he was suddenly woken up by a strange sound. He opened his eyes in a daze and realized that there was someone standing by his bed.

There was plenty of moonlight today, so he could see that the figure was a child about his age. Laughing Li thought that the beautiful boy had crawled out by himself, so he rubbed his eyes and asked, “Tianyou, why did you crawl out by yourself?”

“Tianyou, why did you crawl out by yourself?” The moment the figure spoke, Laughing Li jumped in fright. He jolted and woke up completely.

The figure wasn’t just mimicking him. Even his voice and tone were identical. For a moment, Laughing Li even suspected that he was the one speaking

“Who are you?” Laughing Li sat up immediately and leaned against the wall. He stood on the bed and sized up the figure warily.

As there was only moonlight and it came from behind the figure, Laughing Li couldn’t see his face. However, the more he looked at the outline, the more he felt that it resembled him. He couldn’t help but feel a chill in his heart.

“Who are you?” The voice sounded again, one identical to Laughing Li’s voice and tone.

Laughing Li stared at the silhouette and suddenly threw a punch at his face.

The silhouette tilted its head slightly and dodged Laughing Li’s fist. At the same time, it threw a punch at Laughing Li’s face.

Laughing Li failed to dodge the punch and ended with a bleeding nose.

However, he ignored it and continued throwing punches at the figure. He used all his strength, hoping to leave a mark on the figure.

However, the figure’s speed and strength were clearly much stronger than Laughing Li’s. He easily dodged Laughing Li’s attack.

Thanks to dodging Laughing Li’s fist, the figure had his side facing the moonlight. Laughing Li immediately saw his appearance.

That face was identical to his. It was as though it was carved from the same mold. Even the painful expression from Laughing Li’s bleeding nose was replicated by that face.

Laughing Li wasn’t frightened or surprised. He only shouted and pounced at the child who looked like him. His pounce was easily dodged by the child. Furthermore, no matter how he shouted, there was no reaction from the outside. It was as though he was the only one left in the entire Li family compound. Could it be that I’m dreaming? No, it’s not a dream. This definitely isn’t a dream. Laughing Li calmed down and pounced at the child again. He knew that his strength and speed were much weaker than the child’s, but he had to leave something on the child. Otherwise, he would be silently replaced. No one would know that Uncrying Li was no longer the former Uncrying Li.

Laughing Li didn’t know what kind of existence it was or why it was doing such a thing, but he knew very well what he himself was capable of.

He lunged again and again, but the boy dodged all of them. His punches and kicks were easily blocked. He failed to injure the boy, but he was hit many times.

Every time he showed a painful expression when he was injured, the boy would mimic it like a puppet. “Dad… Mom… Butler…”

“Dad… Mom… Butler…”

Laughing Li shouted, and so did the boy. He imitated his voice perfectly. Even Laughing Li himself couldn’t tell that it was voices from two different people.

Laughing Li decided to shut up because he already knew that shouting was useless. If it was useful, his family would have long come to save him.

“Why aren’t you shouting?” The boy finally spoke when he saw Laughing Li hold back his words. Furthermore, there was no expression on his face.

Laughing Li remained silent as he pounced at the boy with all his might. Even if it was just a scratch, he wanted to leave something on the boy.

“Aren’t you going to scream? Then I’ll do it for you,” the boy said coldly as he suddenly raised his leg and kicked Laughing Li’s chest. Laughing Li couldn’t dodge in time and was kicked to the ground.

However, he gritted his teeth and didn’t say a word. He even tried his best to control the expression on his face to prevent the muscles on his face from changing.
