Chapter 1821: Giant City

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen had already been to a few dungeons in-game that might produce Apocalypse-grade creatures. Apart from failing to find a boss in Chess Mountain, Mount Laojun and Small Buddha Temple hadn’t respawned.

From the looks of it, I need to add some new dungeons. Zhou Wen thought about where to get some new dungeons.

Now, there were break-out dimensional zones everywhere on Earth. There was a plethora of news, and creatures like dragons and vampires could often be seen.

There were even people who had seen angels descending, devils running amok, sprites dancing, and so on.

However, no matter how he analyzed it, the possibility of those places having an Apocalypse-grade creature was slim. What really concerned Zhou Wen was a place called Giant City.

According to the intelligence gathered, an extremely huge city had appeared in the West District. The city walls were more than a thousand meters tall, taller than the tallest building built by humans.

The city gates were more than a thousand meters tall. It was unknown what kind of creature could open such a door.

Giant City was surrounded by clouds. Many people who wanted to rush into the city to gather information had already vanished from the world. Up to now, no one knew what was inside the city, and the city gates had never been opened.

Some people guessed that the giant city was very likely related to the second generation of rulers in ancient Greek mythology, the Titans.

Ancient Greek mythology had three generations of god-kings. The first generation god-king, Uranus, was the god of the sky. The second generation god-king, Cronus, was the youngest of the twelve Titans. He was an amalgamation of the creative and destructive power of time that allowed him to devour all of time. The third generation god-king was Zeus, known as the king of the gods. He was also the god of the sky and lightning.

However, the myths in ancient Greece were very chaotic, just like the myths in the East. The god-king’s family was somewhat similar to the Heavenly Courts in the East. It was just a mythical system. The original gods weren’t family members of these god-kings.

In some versions, the first god to be born was Chaos, the God of Chaos. It was somewhat similar to Pangu in the East.

Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in the Titans, but he was very interested in the God of Chaos, Chaos.

This was because Zhou Wen had long suspected that his First Order of Chaos was likely related to Chaos.

Therefore, Zhou Wen decided to head to the giant city to take a look. It was best if he could find the tiny palm symbol. If he really couldn’t find it, he didn’t plan on entering.

Although Zhou Wen had the ability to fight Apocalypse-grade creatures, who knew what special abilities they had? It wouldn’t be worth it if he accidentally lost his life inside.

After getting the coordinates of the giant city, he used spatial teleportation to arrive there.

Although he already knew that the giant city was definitely magnificent, he couldn’t help but be shocked by its beauty when he stood in front of it.

I wonder how long it will take for humans to build such a majestic city. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but marvel as he looked at the black city on the mountain peak.

The mountain was thousands of meters tall, and the city was more than a thousand meters tall. The city was on the mountain, piercing through the clouds. It was like an illusory city in the clouds.

Zhou Wen didn’t take note of the name of the mountain. Although the information had it, Zhou Wen didn’t remember such a long name, nor was he in the mood to remember it.

“You can’t enter this city.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to reach the city gate on the mountain peak, he was suddenly stopped by a voice.

“Why are you here?” Zhou Wen turned his head and realized that it was Tsukuyomi walking over with a smile.

“Why can’t I be here?” Tsukuyomi asked.

“Didn’t you already leave Earth after the break out?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. Why would Tsukuyomi return when she had already broken out? Wouldn’t she be rejected by Earth’s rules if she returned?

“Earth’s seal is now pitifully weak. I was born on Earth. What’s so strange about me returning? As for you, why are you here?” Tsukuyomi asked.

“I heard that there’s a giant city here, so I came to take a look. Why did you say that we can’t enter?” Zhou Wen didn’t explain in detail.

“Curiosity kills the cat. Although you now have the ability to fight an Apocalypse-grade creature, it’s best you don’t enter this city. Otherwise, you might become a ghost of humanity,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.

“Is this place that terrifying? Why can’t I tell?” Zhou Wen pretended to be surprised.

“There’s no need for you to probe. I’ll tell you whatever you want to know. There’s definitely an Apocalypse creature in this city. Furthermore, it’s not an ordinary one.” Tsukuyomi saw through Zhou Wen’s thoughts at a glance and curled her lips. “I’ve been here for more than half a month. I’ve seen countless humans enter, but none of them came out. Furthermore, I’ve seen some unbelievable scenes.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“What scenes?” he hurriedly asked.

“This city... can devour the sky...” Tsukuyomi said with a strange expression.

“Devour the sky? How so?” Zhou Wen was even more intrigued.

“You came at the right time. You will see it tomorrow night,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile without telling Zhou Wen the answer.

“Why are you here?” Zhou Wen didn’t ask further as he sized up Tsukuyomi.

“I originally thought that this was the place of the twelve Titan Gods. Perhaps there’s something I need, but from the looks of it, it shouldn’t be. Even if there is, it shouldn’t be just the Titan Gods here. There must be something even more terrifying inside. I’ve already given up,” Tsukuyomi said as she shrugged.

“Then leave first. I’ll take a look around.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he flew to the city’s entrance.

“Didn’t I tell you not to enter? I’m not stopping you if you are suicidal, but you can consider marrying me and letting me give birth to a son for you before entering. It will also ensure that your Zhou family doesn’t just end with you,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile as she followed Zhou Wen.

“Where did you learn that from?” Zhou Wen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Tsukuyomi’s strange thoughts were endless.

“Isn’t this how you humans think? What’s so strange about that?” Tsukuyomi pretended to be aggrieved and continued like a bullied wife, “Could it be that I misunderstood the saying that there are three ways to be unfilial?”

“You didn’t understand it wrongly, but...” Zhou Wen didn’t know how to explain. All he could do was shut up and stare at the giant city’s city gates.

To his disappointment, he didn’t see the tiny palm symbol on the city gate. However, he had experience. Sometimes, the tiny palm symbol wasn’t necessarily on the city gate. It could also be in a very ordinary spot. Therefore, he walked along the city wall and slowly searched for the tiny palm symbol.

“You should have more descendants given your excellent genes. If humans are really wiped out in the future, I can also take our children away from Earth to live on other planets. Your descendants will be the future of humanity...” Tsukuyomi followed behind Zhou Wen and spouted nonsense that gave him a headache.

He circled the city but didn’t find the tiny palm symbol. Zhou Wen originally wanted to leave, but when he thought of Tsukuyomi saying that the city could devour the sky, he wanted to see how it did so. Therefore, he stayed behind and waited until the next night.
