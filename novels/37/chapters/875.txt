Chapter 876: Treasure in the Furnace

Translator: CKtalon

Liu Yun saw that Jing Daoxian was doing his best to deal with the stone sword and the elder, and that he didn’t have the time to pay attention to him. Without any hesitation, a mysterious starlight lit up at the tip of his fingers. At the instant he directed them, it was as though they had passed through a black hole and vanished.

“Ah!” Liu Yun’s hand retracted as he let out a tragic cry. White flames burned at the tips of his fingers. The flesh on his fingertips had been burned away, revealing white bones.

Furthermore, the flames were still spreading rapidly. Almost instantly, the flames were about to reach Liu Yun’s palm.

Liu Yun was a decisive person who immediately sliced off his flaming fingers as he chopped down with his other hand.

When the five fingers landed on the ground, they were instantly burned to ashes. If he had been any slower, he probably wouldn’t have been able to keep his arm.

Jing Daoxian chuckled and said, “Even top fire-elemental Mythical creatures don’t dare touch the flames in the furnace. You actually dared to reach in to grab it? You have guts.”

Liu Yun’s right hand had all his five fingers severed. Upon hearing Jing Daoxian’s mockery, he realized that Jing Daoxian had been watching their every move. The reason he hadn’t stopped them was because he was certain that they couldn’t take out the item inside the pill furnace.

Liu Yun wasn’t angry. All he did was secretly send a voice transmission to Zhou Wen. “I touched the thing in the pill furnace with my hand. It’s definitely not a pill.”

“What is it?” Zhou Wen asked secretly.

“I don’t know. I only touched a portion of it. It feels like a handle, but I don’t know what it is. My hand turned to this from just touching it. I didn’t dare hold it tightly,” said Liu Yun.

“Could it be something like a sword or saber?” Zhou Wen asked.

“It’s possible.” Liu Yun nodded.

He had originally wanted to pull out the item inside. Even if he couldn’t take it out, he could have threatened Jing Daoxian to release his soul that was locked in the Yin Yang Mirror.

Now, he had injured his hand instead of taking out the item; there was naturally no hope.

“Let me give it a try.” Zhou Wen summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, but he didn’t rush towards the pill furnace immediately.

The flames in the pill furnace were just too powerful. Even the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General probably couldn’t withstand them.

Zhou Wen got the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to charge into the wind and fire vortex. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was blown around by the wind and fire vortex.

However, the Fiend armor on his body gradually lit up. The purple flames in his body burned brighter and brighter. The power of the flames couldn’t injure him, but instead made him stronger.

Only when the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Fiend armor had burned into something akin to amethyst and its entire body was enveloped by the purple flames did Zhou Wen get him to rush towards the pill furnace. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Jing Daoxian only glanced coldly and did not stop the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. As he blocked the elder and the stone sword, he allowed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General entry.

When the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General touched the flames, the Fiend armor immediately lit up. The originally amethyst-like Fiend armor turned purple-white due to the rapidly rising temperature. There was even magma-like liquid slowly flowing down the armor.

With the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s powerful body, it was still unable to withstand the flames in the furnace despite being able to borrow the power of the flames.

Zhou Wen could sense the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s soul roaring in pain. Although he hadn’t been burned to ashes, he was still in extreme pain.

If he continued entering, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body would completely melt before he touched anything inside. Therefore, Zhou Wen could only order him to leave the pill furnace.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t unsummon him. Instead, he made him stand beside him. The flames on his body were still burning crazily, and the melting situation improved slightly.

“Even if a Mythical Fire Elemental King were to come, they would melt in this Sun True Flames Furnace. It’s a fool’s dream to rely on a Mythical Companion Beast to take out what’s inside,” Jing Daoxian said indifferently. “The thing inside isn’t something you can take.”

Jing Daoxian had no intention of taking it himself, as though he was waiting for something.

The elder and the stone sword kept trying to kill Jing Daoxian, but Jing Daoxian was toying with them using the Yin Yang Mirror. The elder wanted to escape the Yin Yang Mirror’s control, but the effects weren’t ideal.

Suddenly, a sound came from the pill furnace.

“Wa... Wa...” Zhou Wen listened carefully and his expression changed. He looked at Liu Yun and asked, “Didn’t you say that the thing inside might be a weapon? Why is there the sound of a baby crying?”

Liu Yun also heard the voice inside and was alarmed. That’s not right. I clearly grabbed something that resembled a handle with my hand. How can there be a baby’s voice? Could it be that the weapon has become a spirit?

Impossible. It’s probably a Companion Beast, right? Zhou Wen thought.

At that moment, Jing Daoxian finally took action. With the Yin Yang Mirror in one hand to stop the stone sword and the elder, he used his other hand to reach into the pill furnace’s interior.

The elder and the stone sword seemed to know that the critical moment had arrived. Rows of laws suddenly appeared on the stone sword. Instantly, they tore through the void and stabbed towards Jing Daoxian’s heart.

The elder began to risk his life. His entire body transformed into a crystalline state as he charged at Jing Daoxian like a crystal man.

The power of the Yin Yang Mirror failed to control the elder.

Jing Daoxian frowned slightly. He didn’t have the spare strength to retrieve the item in the furnace. As he held the Yin Yang Mirror to block the stone sword’s strike, he used the stone sword’s power to retreat and dodge the crystallized elder’s strike.

When the crystallized elder saw Jing Daoxian dodge, he charged into the cauldron, hoping to take out the item inside.

However, the stone sword suddenly switched sides and slashed at the elder’s head, forcing him to retreat.

Jing Daoxian charged towards the pill furnace again, but he was stopped by the joint forces of the elder and the stone sword.

The two men and sword fought above the pill furnace, dazzling Liu Yun and Zhou Wen. Even with Zhou Wen’s eyesight, he could barely see their trajectories. There were many details that he couldn’t see clearly.

The stone sword’s sword techniques were nothing out of the ordinary. Every strike seemed to be within expectations, but it made one have no choice but to face its existence. There was no way to use tricks against it.

The elder’s moves were very strange. His entire body was like crystal, but his movement techniques were varied. He looked like a ghost.

Jing Daoxian was very good at borrowing the strength of others. His strength was far inferior to the stone sword and the elder, but with the help of the Yin Yang Mirror, he could also divert the stone sword’s and the elder’s strength to hold them back. No one could take out the thing inside the pill furnace.

Bam!

The three forces clashed, sending Jing Daoxian, the crystallized elder, and the stone sword flying into the vortex of wind and fire.

“Now.” Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to order the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to charge at the Sun True Flames Furnace again. At the same time, he flew close to the furnace’s mouth.

Under Zhou Wen’s orders, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General plunged in. His body began to rapidly melt amidst the terrifying flames. He was unable to withstand the Sun True Flames inside. It looked like he wouldn’t be able to touch anything inside before turning into a pool of magma.

Jing Daoxian and the elder knew that it was impossible for Zhou Wen and company to take out the item inside the pill furnace, so they ignored them.

Seeing that Zhou Wen still wanted to use the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to try his luck, they weren’t too worried despite not being able to rush back in time to stop him.

Just as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was about to melt, Zhou Wen, who had already reached the furnace’s mouth, suddenly summoned a banana fan and fanned at the furnace’s mouth.
