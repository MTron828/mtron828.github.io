Chapter 1038: Shen Yuchi’s Suggestion

Translator: CKtalon

“Zhou Wen.”

Just as Zhou Wen was about to see if he could extort a space station, a small door appeared beside Sky Pass’s main entrance. An extremely majestic man walked out.

Zhou Wen recognized him at a glance. He was the bureau’s director-general, Shen Yuchi. Zhou Wen had met Shen Yuchi when he had gone to Sunset College because of Wang Mingyuan.

However, back then, Shen Yuchi was a mountain that Zhou Wen could only look up to. Shen Yuchi could kill him with a flip of his hand.

Things were now completely different. Zhou Wen was completely confident that he could kill Shen Yuchi.

As the boss of the bureau, Shen Yuchi actually walked out of Sky Pass alone. He didn’t bring any inspectors with him as he walked towards Zhou Wen.

Even though Zhou Wen had always treated the bureau as an enemy, he had no choice but to applaud Shen Yuchi’s bearing. Just by standing there casually, he gave off a dignified aura like an inviolable mountain.

“Director-General Shen, it’s really not easy to meet you,” Zhou Wen said to Shen Yuchi.

“Why do you want to see me?” Shen Yuchi said indifferently.

“I should be the one asking you that, Director-General Shen. Hasn’t the bureau always wanted to invite me over?” Zhou Wen said.

Shen Yuchi’s aura was as heavy as a mountain. He said with a heavy voice, “The bureau wanted to arrest you because of your relationship with Jing Daoxian, even more so because you are Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. This is a standard procedure. We have a clear conscience.”

“In that case, are you saying I was wrong?” Zhou Wen stared coldly at Shen Yuchi.

Shen Yuchi’s gaze didn’t dodge or show compromise. He looked into Zhou Wen’s eyes and continued, “From the bureau’s standpoint, you were indeed wrong. However, it’s meaningless to say who’s right and who’s wrong now. With your strength, there’s no value talking about right or wrong with you.”

“Director-General Shen, are you calling me a lawless thug?” Zhou Wen asked calmly.

“Of course not. I’ve repeatedly studied your information. Perhaps you don’t believe me. My understanding of your personality might be better than yours,” Shen Yuchi said.

“I would like to hear what kind of person I am.” Zhou Wen looked at Shen Yuchi with interest.

Shen Yuchi said slowly, “If you hear my evaluation, I’m afraid you will want to kill me, so there’s no point saying it out loud. However, I have a suggestion regarding the grudge between you and the bureau. I believe you will be interested.”

“Tell me about it,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at Shen Yuchi.

“Summon one of your Legendary Companion Beasts,” Shen Yuchi said.

Zhou Wen was somewhat curious why a person like Shen Yuchi dared to meet him alone. What did he rely on? Therefore, he summoned a Legendary Companion Beast according to Shen Yuchi’s request.

It was a Legendary Vajra Malla, a dimensional creature commonly seen in Dragon Gate Grotto.

“Vajra Malla. Not a bad Legendary Companion Beast. It’s rare,” Shen Yuchi said as he took out an Essence Crystal and held it in his palm.

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled as to why Shen Yuchi took out an Essence Crystal. However, when he looked carefully, he realized that there was a snow-white petal inside the Essence Crystal.

Zhou Wen didn’t ask what it was because he knew that since Shen Yuchi had taken it out, he would definitely explain it clearly.

He was just a little curious how magical this petal was to give Shen Yuchi the confidence of moving him with a single petal.

Shen Yuchi didn’t say anything else. He crushed the Essence Crystal and let the petal fly out. Then, he used the wind from his palm to send the petal to the Vajra Malla.

The petal landed on the Vajra Malla’s head and, like melting snow, it fused into the Vajra Malla’s body.

Following that, Zhou Wen saw the Vajra Malla’s body emit a strange glow. It had actually begun evolving.

The Vajra Malla was only a low-level Companion Beast and didn’t have any evolutionary attributes. Therefore, under normal circumstances, there was no possibility of it evolving.

However, that tiny petal had actually allowed the Vajra Malla to begin evolving. It was truly shocking.

“There are no permanent enemies in the world, only interests. Let’s not talk about who’s right or wrong in the past. Now, even if you slaughter the entire bureau, you won’t be able to obtain any benefits. However, as long as you are willing, you can obtain such flowers together with the bureau... There are thousands of them...” Shen Yuchi said slowly.

Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted. Ignoring the fact that these petals were useless against high-level Companion Beasts, they were very useful to Zhou Wen.

This was because many Mythical Companion Beasts had difficulty advancing in the early stages. He had no choice but to wait for them to slowly grow.

With such flowers, Zhou Wen could use them to rapidly grow Mythical Companion Beasts.

For example, it was extremely difficult to advance the Evil Spirit King. This was because Mortal Companion Eggs were rare. Although Zhou Wen had bought quite a number of them, he still didn’t meet the requirements needed to advance the Evil Spirit King.

If he had such flowers, he could directly advance the Evil Spirit King without having to go through so much trouble.

Furthermore, Shen Yuchi’s claim that there were thousands of them tempted Zhou Wen.

“Why should I believe you?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Why don’t we go in and take a look at the information we recorded? You can then make a decision.” Shen Yuchi smiled. He knew that Zhou Wen had been moved.

Zhou Wen and Shen Yuchi entered Sky Pass and arrived at the bureau’s base. He also saw the information that Shen Yuchi and company had recorded on the moon.

Zhou Wen saw the entire discovery process of the osmanthus petals and osmanthus tree stump through the videos.

He knew that Shen Yuchi wasn’t lying. At their excavation speed, they might discover thousands of osmanthus petals. Furthermore, there was a mysterious osmanthus tree stump there. Perhaps it was more valuable than the petals. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Could it be that that’s the legendary osmanthus tree on the moon? Then, do the legendary woodcutter, Moon Palace Fairy, and Moon Rabbit also exist? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

“We’ll work together to gather the osmanthus flowers. After the matter is done, half the harvest will be yours,” Shen Yuchi said.

“Director-General Shen, you don’t seem like someone who will throw money at a problem,” Zhou Wen said to Shen Yuchi.

“Consider it mutually beneficial. Look further.” Shen Yuchi played the final video.

Soon, Zhou Wen saw the huge footprint and the flattened space station.

“There are other dimensional creatures on the moon?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Our bureau doesn’t plan on giving up on such divine items. Therefore, I plan on taking men to the Moon personally. If you are willing to go with me, my promise will still be valid. No matter how many osmanthus flowers we obtain, you can have half,” Shen Yuchi said.

“Apart from half the osmanthus flowers, I want that tree stump,” Zhou Wen said.

“Pleasure to work with you.” Shen Yuchi raised his teacup.
