Chapter 1674 Three Strikes

“You lost. Bring the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace along and return to the Family Clan of Gods with me.” Mohe released his palm and the ice sword in his hand transformed into water that flowed into the sea.

The disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace turned ashen. Despite Sei Gasakai’s abilities, Mohe had actually suppressed his strength to the same level as him. Furthermore, despite Sei Gasakai using the Calamity-grade Ghost Cry and God Howling blades, he couldn’t even withstand a single strike. This made them suspect Sei Gasakai’s Sword Dao.

Sei Gasakai was speechless. He had lost so thoroughly that there was nothing else to say.

Mohe turned around and was about to leave when he saw a youth standing not far behind him. The youth stood there silently sizing him up with a look of interest. This made Mohe frown.

The youth was less than a hundred meters away from him. He hadn’t sensed the other party’s arrival at all despite this distance. Just this alone surprised him.

“Mr. Zhou!” When Sei Gasakai saw Zhou Wen, he said guiltily, “I’m sorry I lost. I can only follow the agreement and head to the Family Clan of Gods.”

“Mr. Qi, there’s no need to take it to heart.” Zhou Wen smiled and said to Mohe, “The Family Clan of Gods is such a huge conglomerate. I don’t think they will snatch my guests from me.”

Mohe looked at Zhou Wen and said, “That depends on whether you have the ability to take the guests.”

“You say that the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū is this and nothing more. I wonder if you dare make a pact of three strikes with me?” Zhou Wen said calmly.

“You indeed live up to your name as Deceit King. You are truly a deceptive person,” Mohe mocked.

The fact that Zhou Wen was Deceit King was no longer a secret among the six families. Before becoming the representative, Mohe had seen Zhou Wen’s battle through the Cube, so he naturally didn’t dare underestimate him.

He dared to make a pact of three strikes with Sei Gasakai, but he didn’t dare do the same for Zhou Wen.

It wasn’t that Mohe believed that Zhou Wen was stronger than him. It was only because Deceit King had displayed his powerful spatial abilities. Even if Zhou Wen only dodged, he wasn’t confident of defeating him in three strikes.

Furthermore, the reason that Mohe could defeat Sei Gasakai in one strike wasn’t that his Sword Dao realm was really much stronger than Sei Gasakai’s. Before coming, Mohe had studied the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū’s Sword Dao and gathered a large amount of information on Sei Gasakai. It could be said that he knew Sei Gasakai like the back of his hand. That was why he could defeat the enemy with one strike. It was his style to plan before taking action.

The Family Clan of Gods had plenty of information on Zhou Wen, but they couldn’t completely understand Zhou Wen through such information. At the very least, Mohe believed that what the information revealed wasn’t everything about Zhou Wen.

“You misunderstood me. I’m not asking you to defeat me in three strikes.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

“Then do you mean that you want me to receive your three strikes?” Mohe’s expression turned cold as he couldn’t help but feel angry. Ever since he became a representative, he had never suffered such derision.

Although Zhou Wen was famous as Deceit King, that was only in the past. Mohe didn’t believe that Zhou Wen had the right to say such things to the present him.

“Of course not.” Zhou Wen shook his head again.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Mohe’s expression softened. He looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Then what do you mean by pact of three strikes?”

Zhou Wen didn’t answer him as he waved at Honn Shinsakura. “Come over and help me.”

Honn Shinsakura was taken aback when he heard that. He didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to, but he still walked over the waves and headed to Zhou Wen’s side.

“Master, why did Zhou Wen get Honn Shinsakura to go over?” Shiraishi Satomi asked Sei Gasakai in puzzlement.

“How can we see through a figure like him? However, Mr. Zhou definitely has his reasons. Just keep watching,” Sei Gasakai said.

“Sir, what are your orders?” Honn Shinsakura came in front of Zhou Wen and bowed.

“I remember that you are Mr. Sei’s disciple. You should have obtained the true teachings of Mr. Sei’s Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, right?” Zhou Wen asked Honn Shinsakura.

Mohe didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to as he watched without a word.

“I wouldn’t dare call it true teachings. I’ve been working hard to follow in Master’s footsteps,” Honn Shinsakura answered.

“Sakura’s Sword Dao is about to reach my realm,” Sei Gasakai said.

“It’s enough.” Zhou Wen nodded in satisfaction.

“Zhou Wen, what are you up to?” Mohe asked with a frown.

“You just said that the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū is this and nothing more. Then I’ll impart three strikes of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū on Mr. Sei’s behalf. It’s the same rule as before. If you can withstand three strikes from him without being defeated, you can take them anywhere you want.” When Zhou Wen said that, everyone was stunned speechless.

Everyone had already seen Mohe’s strength. Even Sei Gasakai couldn’t withstand a single strike. Although Honn Shinsakura was a genius and his cultivation in the way of the sword was close to Sei Gasakai’s, it was unbelievable that he could defeat Mohe after learning three sword strikes.

This time, it wasn’t just Mohe’s expression. Even his eyes turned cold as he stared intently at Zhou Wen and said, “You will pay the price for your arrogance.”

“All you need to do is answer whether you’ll take the bet,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“Alright, I’ll fulfill your wish. However, after that, I’ll fight you. I originally didn’t want to be your enemy, but you’re forcing me,” Mohe said coldly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Get through his three strikes without being defeated first.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he waved his hand at Honn Shinsakura. “Lend me your blade. I’ll teach you three strikes on behalf of Mr. Sei.”

Although Honn Shinsakura was somewhat puzzled, he still handed the blade to Zhou Wen with both hands.

Zhou Wen took the samurai sword and casually brandished it twice as though he was familiarizing himself with the blade’s center of gravity.

“Master, isn’t Zhou Wen being too arrogant?” Shiraishi Satomi said with an odd expression.

Although she knew that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign, it wasn’t easy to defeat Mohe even with the strength Human Sovereign had displayed in the past. To be able to defeat Mohe by teaching Honn Shinsakura three strikes on the spot was unbelievable.

In fact, it wasn’t just Shiraishi Satomi. The Elders also felt that Zhou Wen was a little condescending. Even if he was Human Sovereign, he couldn’t underestimate an expert at Mohe’s level.

Even if Zhou Wen really had such a powerful Sword Dao, it was impossible for Honn Shinsakura to immediately master his profound Sword Dao. No matter how talented a swordsman was, it was impossible for him to master a profound sword technique in such a short period of time.

What was even more unacceptable was that Zhou Wen had actually begun imparting the Honn Shinsakura Sword Art in front of Mohe without any intention of concealment.

Can we rely on… this person? It wasn’t just the Elders. Even the ordinary disciples felt that Zhou Wen’s actions were a little too childish.

To teach three strikes in front of the opponent and to use those same three strikes to defeat him, was he treating the opponent as an idiot?
