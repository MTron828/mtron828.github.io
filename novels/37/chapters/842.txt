Chapter 843: Ghoul Mask

Clang!

While Tyrant Behemoth was digging the Fiend Tomb, its horn seemed to have touched something, emitting a metallic clang. As for Tyrant Behemoth, it automatically took two steps back and stared at the dug up Fiend Tomb.

Inside the Fiend Tomb, there was a huge human face. It was identical to the fiend faces that had appeared on the Fiend Stones. However, this face was much bigger, and it emitted a grayish-white strange aura.

Zhou Wen was staring at the face as he sized it up, but it floated up by itself. Only then did he realize that it wasn’t a face, but a stone mask.

From the looks of it, the problem of the fiend face appearing lies with this mask. Zhou Wen ordered Tyrant Behemoth to deliver a punch. He wanted to see what abilities this mask had.

Bam!

Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength strike shattered the mask. This left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback. Although he felt that there weren’t many Companion Beasts in this world that could fight Tyrant Behemoth head-on, it was blasted apart with a single punch. It was too weak—even inferior to the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, he saw the dust that filled the sky float towards Tyrant Behemoth. Before Zhou Wen could react, the dust from the shattered mask touched Tyrant Behemoth’s face, turning into a complete mask.

However, this time, the mask matched the size of Tyrant Behemoth’s face, enveloping it completely.

Zhou Wen immediately felt that something was amiss. Indeed, Tyrant Behemoth roared and struggled, trying to tear off the mask on its face, but it failed. Furthermore, its struggling slowed down. Soon, Zhou Wen realized that Tyrant Behemoth was no longer under his control.

Boom!

Tyrant Behemoth threw a punch at the blood-colored avatar who dodged to the side. Its fist smashed a huge hole in the mountain wall.

Tyrant Behemoth’s terrifying strength was unleashed as it attacked the blood-colored avatar repeatedly. Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t enough to fight Tyrant Behemoth, so he could only dodge.

As Zhou Wen dodged, he observed the mask and mentally contacted Tyrant Behemoth.

The mental connection was no longer working. The mask completely controlled Tyrant Behemoth. The mask’s ability surprised Zhou Wen.

From the looks of it, I can only give it a try. After shattering the mask, can I liberate Tyrant Behemoth? Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and instantly vanished.

Tyrant Behemoth was a Companion Beast that employed brute force. It had never been afraid of anyone in a head-on battle.

However, Zhou Wen had vanished. It could only stand there in a daze. Its masked face looked around, but there was no sign of Zhou Wen. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, an invisible sword beam flashed. The mask on Tyrant Behemoth’s face was cleaved into two and fell from Tyrant Behemoth’s face.

However, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t regain its freedom. The mask automatically shattered and condensed on Tyrant Behemoth’s face, forming a new mask. Tyrant Behemoth was still under its control.

Zhou Wen continued forward invisibly as the Light Concealment Sword in his hand rapidly flashed. Countless strikes instantly shattered the mask, but the outcome was still useless.

The shattered mask returned to Tyrant Behemoth’s face and reformed. It still firmly controlled Tyrant Behemoth.

It’s impossible for there to be no weakness. What’s the weakness of the mask? Still invisible, Zhou Wen used the Hell King Life Soul’s ability and Truth Listener’s hearing to constantly scan the mask.

Coupled with Doctor Darkness’s penetrative vision, the mask had almost no secrets in front of Zhou Wen.

The mask itself was flawless. It was made of gray rocks, so he didn’t discover anything special.

It was unlike the Water Elemental that Zhou Wen had seen before. The Water Elemental could be scattered and reformed. However, there was a water element core in the Water Elemental’s body. As long as the core was destroyed, the Water Elemental could be killed.

However, this mask was different. It didn’t have a core in its body. No matter how he sliced its body or even blasted the mask to dust like Tyrant Behemoth, he couldn’t kill it.

Could it be that it really doesn’t have a weakness? Zhou Wen observed for a long time but failed to discover the weakness of the mask.

Demonic Neonate, who was hiding in the Invisibility Cloak, hadn’t taken action. Clearly, she hadn’t found the flaw in the mask, so she had no intention of taking action.

Even Demonic Neonate and I can’t discover the flaws in the mask. Then, is it possible that there aren’t any flaws? Or perhaps, its flaws aren’t on its body? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he focused his attention on the Fiend Tomb where he had discovered the mask.

Inside the Fiend Tomb were grayish-white Fiend Stones. After the mask flew out, the Fiend Stones below formed the shape of human faces, perhaps because they were compressed by the Fiend Stones above. However, they only looked a little similar in shape. They didn’t have the vibrancy of the other Fiend Stones. They didn’t seem to be living creatures.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t care. He had to give everything a shot. He immediately went over in his invisible state and quickly slashed out with Light Concealment Sword, slashing at the human-faced Fiend Stones in the Fiend Tomb.

Pfft!

Wherever the sword mark appeared, black blood spewed out like a fountain. As for Tyrant Behemoth’s mask, it suddenly distorted as cracks similar to the sword marks appeared.

When the black blood spewed out, the mask shattered with a crack and fell to the ground.

‘Killed Mythical creature, Ghoul Mask.’ A notification appeared in-game.

Nothing dropped? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. The Dragon Tiger Pill Essence that had recently dropped seemed to have expended all his luck. It had been days since anything good had dropped.

After the Ghoul Mask was dispatched, Zhou Wen recovered his connection with Tyrant Behemoth. Furthermore, the ghost faces in the Fiend Stone shattered. When the Companion Beasts touched the Fiend Stones again, they didn’t get petrified again.

From the looks of it, the problem with Fiend Stone Petrification was triggered by the Ghoul Mask. I wonder if the Zhang family’s people ran towards the Fiend Tomb because of the Ghoul Mask. If that’s the case, the Zhang family’s problem should be resolvable, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he got Tyrant Behemoth to continue digging the Fiend Tomb to see what else was down there.

Without the interference of the Fiend Stone statues, Tyrant Behemoth dug even faster. It directly swallowed the Fiend Stones it dug out to replenish its expended Essence Energy.

As it dug, Tyrant Behemoth stopped as though it had lost its soul. It stood in front of the Fiend Tomb, motionless no matter how Zhou Wen ordered it.

What’s wrong now? Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he focused his gaze at the Fiend Tomb that had been dug seven to eight meters deep. He saw that apart from the Fiend Stones, there was another living creature in the pit.
