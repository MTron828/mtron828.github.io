Chapter 1798 Annihilation

As the stone saber was pulled out, the silver-haired Companion Beast’s body floated in the air. His limbs leaned back as his chest protruded out like he were a living sacrifice.

Silver flames spewed out and surged towards Zhou Wen’s body, instantly enveloping him.

Companion Beasts that had already signed a contract couldn’t sign a contract with others, but with the stone saber as a medium, a new contract formed between the two.

A silver symbol gradually appeared on Zhou Wen’s chest.

The silver-haired Companion Beast’s body gradually dissipated in the silver flames until he completely vanished. The silver symbol on Zhou Wen’s chest was resplendent.

Just as Zhou Wen looked down to see what the symbol on his chest was, he saw it suddenly flash and vanish without Zhou Wen’s control.

In the next second, Zhou Wen’s entire body suddenly emitted silver light. His black hair quickly turned silver, and even his eyes were filled with silver.

“Who the hell stipulated that Companion Beasts can only be used as slaves to human? What are humans? I’m the true ruler of everything!” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s will roared crazily in Zhou Wen’s mind.

“Why?” Zhou Wen’s consciousness hadn’t been completely occupied, but he wasn’t flustered. All he did was calmly communicate with the silver-haired Companion Beast’s will.

“Why? Don’t you understand? What a stupid fellow. By occupying your body, I can be my absolute self. No one can control me anymore.” The silver-haired Companion Beast mocked, “I still have to thank you for the body you contributed to me. I’m very satisfied with this body. A Calamity-grade capable of producing Apocalypse-grade strength. As expected of a race that has been blessed.”

“That’s why you chose me and not anyone else,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

“Hmph, I’ve already been scammed twice. I don’t have the patience to play any games. This time, I’m going to do it in one step. You don’t have to resent Lingfeng for screwing me over so badly. A son has to repay his father’s debt. That’s your life.” The silver-haired Companion Beast seemed to be in an extremely good mood. It spoke frankly unlike before.

“Didn’t you say that he was trash? How did he scam you again?” Zhou Wen continued asking. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Sensing that Zhou Wen’s willpower was weakening, the silver-haired Companion Beast said smugly, “That trash isn’t good at anything, but he’s very cunning. He kept delaying his cultivation, preventing me from evolving. He even f*cking tricked me and forcefully stripped me of my Essence Energy… However, it doesn’t matter now. I’ll take back everything he owes me.”

“In that case, everything you said about Nüwa was a lie?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“Do I need to lie to a nobody like you? That woman indeed tore through the air on a boat and forcefully dug me out of the core. Unfortunately, she died after that.” The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly.

“Died?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback. Since she’s dead, who’s the one at Chess Mountain?

Zhou Wen never expected such an outcome. “Who else could it be other than Nüwa?” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s explanation confused Zhou Wen.

“You mean that the woman who steered the boat isn’t the same person as Nüwa? The one in Chess Mountain is Nüwa, and the one driving the boat is another woman? Who’s Nüwa? Who’s the woman?” Zhou Wen quickly understood what the silver-haired Companion Beast meant.

“I also want to know who that woman is. She came on a ship and descended into this world. She shattered the dimension single-handedly and forcefully dug out the planet’s egg. That’s an unparalleled shocking ability…” When the silver-haired Companion Beast spoke of the woman, there was a hint of admiration.

“Shattered the dimension? Isn’t she an Immortal? How can she shatter the dimension?” Zhou Wen could tell that something was amiss.

According to the information he had obtained, the woman who had descended on the ship was likely the supreme existence of the Immortals.

However, from the silver-haired Companion Beast’s tone, it didn’t seem to be the case.

“The Immortals are nothing. They aren’t worthy of being lumped with her,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said disdainfully. “Because of her descent, the entire dimension was almost shattered. A mere Immortal is nothing.”

“Now, your body will be used by me. In the future, you will definitely become the ruler of the entire world. That will also be your glory.” The silver-haired Companion Beast devoured crazily, hoping to completely devour Zhou Wen’s consciousness.

“I’m looking forward to seeing that day, but unfortunately, you can’t,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“Whether it works or not isn’t up to you… to say…” Before the silver-haired Companion Beast could finish its sentence, it suddenly realized that Zhou Wen’s seemingly weak consciousness had suddenly turned from weak to strong. No matter how he devoured it, he couldn’t completely erase Zhou Wen’s consciousness.

“Heavens, it’s no wonder you can resist an Apocalypse with your Calamity body. The strength of your will is almost inhuman. So you were also plotting against me. Unfortunately, you’re still too inexperienced. I’m Earth’s Companion Beast. On Earth, no life can compete with my will…” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s will became stronger and stronger, as though the entire Earth’s will was injecting energy into him.

Even someone as tenacious as Zhou Wen felt an unparalleled pressure. His consciousness was being devoured bit by bit.

“This body is mine!” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s consciousness roared crazily.

However, in the next second, the silver-haired Companion Beast’s crazy roar stopped.

Another will suddenly appeared in his consciousness.

Zhou Wen finally activated Sigh of the King as the strange woman’s consciousness awakened.

“How… How is this possible…” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s consciousness seemed to tremble violently as though something extremely terrifying had happened.

“Impossible… Impossible… Aren’t you already dead… How is it possible…” The silver-haired Companion Beast felt the strange consciousness. Its horror had already exceeded the limits of his mental endurance.

“Annihilate.” Like a woman ruling the world, she didn’t even look at the silver-haired Companion Beast as she indifferently spat out a word.

The silver color over Zhou Wen’s body instantly receded like a tidal wave. The silver-haired Companion Beast’s consciousness also vanished amidst extreme horror.

Zhou Wen’s eyes regained clarity as he looked down at his chest. He saw all the silver condensed on his chest, forming a silver symbol.

Could it be that the Sigh of the King transformed from the Lost Immortal Sutra is the woman mentioned by the silver-haired Companion Beast? Unfortunately, I couldn’t get more useful information from him. Zhou Wen felt mixed emotions.

He never expected that the final answer was already on him.

He habitually took out his phone and looked at his stats. Indeed, there was a new Companion Beast in the Companion Beast column.
