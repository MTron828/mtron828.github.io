Chapter 1528 Success

The Lost Immortal Sutra itself was very pure without any special attributes. It didn’t have much augmentation effect on the body. Only its usage of Essence Energy was very powerful.

However, this strength wasn’t targeted at combat. Therefore, Zhou Wen seldom used the Lost Immortal Sutra in combat. He would basically add a simulated Essence Energy Art to it.

I hope it’s of some use. Zhou Wen was only making a last-ditch effort. At this stage, he couldn’t give up unless he tried all the possibilities.

In fact, Zhou Wen didn’t even need to circulate the Lost Immortal Sutra himself. It constantly circulated in his body.

He removed the various augmentation powers and restored the most primitive state of the Lost Immortal Sutra. “Even her lady can’t take it. It’s useless even if you try again. It’s best you leave quickly. I have a nagging feeling that something is amiss here.” Grim Demon didn’t wish to stay in such a dangerous place any longer and urged Zhou Wen to leave quickly.

Zhou Wen ignored him. After returning the Lost Immortal Sutra to its original form, he unsummoned the Prisoned Dragon armor on his body and extended his hand to touch the girl’s hand.

In fact, Zhou Wen knew that the chances of success weren’t high. Even the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique couldn’t remove the ring. The chances of an Essence Energy Art like the Lost Immortal Sutra without any special augmentation succeeding were slim.

Zhou Wen wanted to see if the Lost Immortal Sutra’s simulation ability was effective. Perhaps it could simulate the girl’s aura.

Of course, this was just a wild hope. The Demon God Bloodline Catalog couldn’t even scan the girl’s body and transform him into her appearance. An Essence Energy Art like the Lost Immortal Sutra that purely simulated auras probably had nothing when the other party had zero aurae.

With all sorts of thoughts flashing through his mind, Zhou Wen’s finger touched the ring on the girl’s finger.

Zhou Wen was already prepared to be sent flying, but nothing happened when his fingertip touched the ring.

“I’m fine!” Zhou Wen was overjoyed.

Although the Lost Immortal Sutra couldn’t simulate the girl’s aura, the girl was like a dead person. There was no aura, nor was there any way to simulate it.

However, the ordinary Lost Immortal Sutra allowed Zhou Wen to finally touch the ring.

“Gal, the ring is useless with you anyway. Lend it to me. If you need anything in the future, tell me in a dream. If you want clothes, houses, or money, I’ll burn them all for you,” Zhou Wen said as he carefully lifted the girl’s finger and slowly removed the ring with his other hand.

Roar! Seeing the ring slide across the girl’s slender fingers, the seven devils immediately flew into a rage. All sorts of light spewed out from their bodies, transforming into devil phantoms that enveloped their bodies. All of them roared ferociously, gearing to rush over and tear Zhou Wen apart.

“Scram!” Demonic Neonate shouted softly. The auras of the seven enraged devils immediately extinguished. Although they didn’t immediately retreat, they didn’t dare rush forward anymore. They stood there with conflicted expressions.

Taking this opportunity, Zhou Wen took the ring from the girl’s finger. Nothing happened.

“Thank you.” Zhou Wen placed the ring in his palm and pressed his palms together. He bowed at the girl before throwing the ring to Demonic Neonate.

“How did you remove it? Don’t tell me you were deliberately putting on an act to win my lady’s favor?” Grim Demon looked at Zhou Wen suspiciously.

Zhou Wen had unleashed all sorts of powers without being able to remove the ring. Yet, he now managed to remove the ring without doing anything special. It made Grim Demon suspect that his previous actions were just an act.

Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered with him. When the seven devils saw the ring land in Demonic Neonate’s hand, they deflated and didn’t rush forward again.

Demonic Neonate caught the ring in her left palm. The ring itself didn’t reject her. When Demonic Neonate’s finger touched the gem on the ring, the gem was like a water droplet that landed on Demonic Neonate’s fingertip. It shook slightly like water droplets on a lotus leaf or transparent jelly.

Demonic Neonate threw the ring on the ground and placed the jelly-like gem into her mouth. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

What a prodigal! Zhou Wen hurriedly picked up the ring when he saw Demonic Neonate throw it to the ground.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Immortal Culling Sword had failed to scuff the ring. It was obvious that it was extraordinary.

Zhou Wen held the ring and wiped the dust off it with his hand, planning on putting it in the chaos space. Perhaps it would be of some use in the future.

Before putting it in, Zhou Wen tried pinching it, but to his surprise, the metal ring snapped with a crack.

Zhou Wen was immediately dumbfounded when he saw the ring break into several pieces.

What the hell is this? It was clearly so hard just now. Why did it suddenly become so weak! Zhou Wen couldn’t accept this outcome. He picked up the fragments and pinched them again, only to have them shatter into smaller pieces.

Isn’t this just ordinary metal? Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. After all this trouble, this thing was basically ordinary metal. The only good thing was the gem. The ring’s former hardness was either a result of the gem or the strangeness of the girl’s body.

After Demonic Neonate ate the gem, she staggered as though she was drunk and fell.

Zhou Wen hurriedly flashed to Demonic Neonate’s side and picked her up.

“Neonate, are you alright?” Zhou Wen patted Demonic Neonate’s cheek, hoping to wake her up.

“I’m about to sleep…” Demonic Neonate couldn’t even open her eyes as she said in a daze. She turned around and curled up in Zhou Wen’s arms. She grabbed Zhou Wen’s clothes and quickly fell asleep.

Zhou Wen called out a few more times, but Demonic Neonate didn’t respond at all. She fell asleep just like that.

What’s going on? Is she evolving? Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate in his arms and was momentarily at a loss.

Typically, when Companion Beasts evolved, their bodies would rapidly mutate. Even the types with slower mutations would form an energy barrier, allowing them to slowly evolve in an energy environment.

However, Demonic Neonate only looked drunk and asleep. There were no intense energy fluctuations from her body, nor did her body undergo any abnormal changes.

What was even stranger was that Zhou Wen couldn’t unsummon Demonic Neonate when he tried

“Grim Demon, what’s going on?” Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon and asked with a frown.

“This… I’m not too sure either… I told you to leave… You randomly gave her lady food… Look, there’s a problem now…” Grim Demon wasn’t sure what was going on.

Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan Demonic Neonate’s body, but he didn’t discover any problems. It was as though she had really fallen asleep.

Crack!

The stone platform beneath their feet suddenly shook as Zhou Wen and Grim Demon hurriedly flew up. The stone platform where the silver-haired girl lay slowly sank.
