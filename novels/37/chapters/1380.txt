Chapter 1381: True Sword Beam

“Do you think you are worthy of using sword beams with that incomplete Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array?” Step by step, Perfect Sword Immortal walked towards Zhou Wen. As he moved, the invisible sword beams began moving again.

However, this time, the invisible sword beams didn’t charge at Perfect Sword Immortal. Instead, their tips spun around and aimed at Zhou Wen. The sword beams that filled the sky surrounded him.

Calamity-grade!?Zhou Wen was alarmed. Without any hesitation, he used Singularity Universe’s interstellar teleportation ability, hoping to leave this place first.

However, Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that the connection between Singularity Universe and the stars seemed to be blocked. He couldn’t sense the location of the stars at all, so he naturally couldn’t teleport out.

“Ignoring you, even if Starlady Polestar were to come personally, she wouldn’t be able to escape my Perfect Sword Immortal Domain,” Perfect Sword Immortal said coldly as he saw through Zhou Wen’s intentions.

Calamity-grade??Zhou Wen didn’t have the luxury of time to think because the invisible sword beams had already descended.

Although the invisible sword beams were condensed by Zhou Wen himself, he had spent a lot of time condensing them one by one.

Now that they had descended together, other Terror-grade creatures couldn’t withstand them, and neither could Zhou Wen.

Ignoring the fact that the Heavenly Robe on him no longer had a 100% dodge rate, even if it could, there was no space to dodge amidst such dense invisible sword beams.

The so-called 100% dodge rate required space to dodge. It wasn’t something that allowed him to dodge any attack.

Many thoughts flashed through his mind as he immediately made a decision. At this moment, if he didn’t immediately make a decision, death was certain.

At the instant the sword beams landed on him, Zhou Wen’s figure suddenly vanished into thin air. He didn’t retreat. Instead, he instant transmitted to the back of Perfect Sword Immortal and pulled out his Bamboo Blade to stab at his back.

After falling into the Calamity-grade Zone, if he couldn’t use interstellar teleportation to escape, the chances of him escaping were almost zero. It wasn’t that he could go from a passive position to an active position. If he could catch his opponent by surprise and have him reveal a flaw, Zhou Wen could take the opportunity to use Singularity Universe’s teleportation to leave during a lapse in the Calamity Zone.

Clang!

Without looking back, the Perfect Sword Immortal flicked his finger, flicking Bamboo Blade’s blade and causing it to bend. The tip of the blade almost ended up stabbing Zhou Wen’s arm.

Zhou Wen felt as though his palm couldn’t grip the hilt of the saber any longer. The force was surprisingly powerful, completely exceeding the power of a Terror-grade entity.

Just as Zhou Wen’s arm was about to be snapped by the force, Zhou Wen suddenly flung his arm and went along with the force to spin his arm and body. His body spun like a drill as the Bamboo Blade stabbed at Perfect Sword Immortal.

Clang!

Perfect Sword Immortal flicked the tip of the blade with his finger again, causing Zhou Wen’s saber to tremble as his bones seemed to shake loose.

If not for Zhou Wen’s understanding of strength and sword art exceeding this level, he probably wouldn’t have been able to withstand the two simple finger flicks.

Gritting his teeth, Zhou Wen spun like a spinning top and used the momentum to move the saber out. His figure appeared by the side of Perfect Sword Immortal and slashed at his neck.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Zhou Wen’s spinning figure was like a ghost as he pushed the Heart Defying Sword Art to its limits. He appeared everywhere around Perfect Sword Immortal, and his sword moves were even stranger and unpredictable. However, every strike was easily repelled by Perfect Sword Immortal’s casual flick. Not a single strike could touch him.

“Your sword art isn’t bad. You have the right for such pride on Earth. Unfortunately, as my enemy, you are far inferior.” Perfect Sword Immortal flicked the Bamboo Blade again. However, this time, a firefly-like light lit up at his fingertip.

Clang!

When his fingertip collided with the blade, a light wave rapidly spread out like water ripples.

After the wave of light, the Bamboo Blade that had been with Zhou Wen for a long time instantly shattered. Zhou Wen’s body flew backward like a cannonball. After slamming into the ground, he left a ravine hundreds of meters long.

Zhou Wen spat out a mouthful of blood. Due to the high-speed friction, the Heavenly Robe produced smoke due to the extremely high temperature.

“Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Lucky Dodge—those are just external forces akin to tricks. It might be a little useful against trash, but it’s useless against me.” Perfect Sword Immortal wasn’t in a rush to immediately finish him off. As he spoke, the invisible sword beams that Zhou Wen condensed were controlled by him again as they swept out like a tidal wave.

However, his words embarrassed Cave Era and company. Their expressions didn’t look good.

If it was still a little useful against trash, wouldn’t they be inferior to trash if they were nearly killed by Zhou Wen? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Zhou Wen endured the pain from his injuries and leaped up from the ground. However, the sword beams that filled the sky had already arrived, giving him no chance to dodge.

He used instant transmission again, but this time, when he appeared, Perfect Sword Immortal seemed to have determined his landing spot. Countless sword beams were already there. At the instant Zhou Wen phased into existence, several invisible sword beams stabbed into his body, immediately dyeing the Heavenly Robe red with blood.

Even more invisible sword beams were already inches away as they tore towards him from all directions.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg.

Instantly, the Chaos Egg was stabbed like a reverse hedgehog. Invisible sword beams constantly stabbed at it as they collided with each other.

Thankfully, the Chaos Egg’s defense was good. The Chaos Egg, which could even withstand temporal and spatial powers, managed to withstand the terrifying sword stream’s impact.

Holy sh*t! Why isn’t Sweetie doing a thing at this point in time? Don’t tell me she’s going to watch me die??Zhou Wen crushed the invisible sword aura that had stabbed him and swallowed a Mythical Dragon Resurrection Pill Essence. His injuries immediately healed at a discernible pace. In a moment, his damaged organs recovered and his external injuries were almost healed.

“You aren’t dead yet?” After all the invisible sword beams struck the Chaos Egg and exploded, Perfect Sword Immortal couldn’t help but be surprised that the strange ball hadn’t been pierced through.

However, his surprise only lasted for a moment. To Perfect Sword Immortal, the invisible sword beams that Zhou Wen condensed were still too weak. They just had the numbers.

From the point of view of a Terror grade, so many invisible sword beams were terrifying, but they were nothing to Perfect Sword Immortal.

“Since you aren’t dead, I’ll let you see what a true sword beam is,” said Perfect Sword Immortal as he raised his index and middle fingers together and stabbed at the Chaos Egg.

A purple sword beam took form at his fingertip. Like a purple beam of light, it shot at the Chaos Egg and instantly struck it.

Boom!

The Chaos Egg was forced back by the purple sword beam. After slamming into the ground, the purple sword beam continued its onslaught, slamming the Chaos Egg deep into the ground.

The shockwave produced by the sword beam blasted open the ground spanning thousands of meters. Cave Era and the other Guardians had no choice but to quickly retreat.

After the terrifying purple sword beam completely dissipated, a huge crater thousands of meters in diameter appeared in the ground. Even Cave Era and company felt their hearts tremble when they saw it.
