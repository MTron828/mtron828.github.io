Chapter 1500 A Guest Arrives

“Cooperate in what?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement when he saw that it was Jiang Yan.

“Don’t you know? Four people are needed to enter Dubhe; no more, no less.” Jiang Yan said.

“Don’t tell me you are really that suicidal? Everything on Dubhe is an unknown, wouldn’t entering be courting death?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that now was a good time to enter Dubhe.

If he rashly entered without knowing the situation inside, even a Calamity-grade creature might not be able to come out alive.

“Of course not now. I just want you to be mentally prepared. I’ll inform you when the opportunity comes,” Jiang Yan said. “I really have to think about it,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Nothing to ask?” Jiang Yan sent another message.

“You’ll tell me what you can and won’t tell me what you can’t.” Zhou Wen replied calmly. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“There are many things that we haven’t confirmed. There’s no point in saying anything. However, this might be a chance to reverse the passive situation.” Jiang Yan replied.

“What passive situation?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand what Jiang Yan meant.

“Think about it yourself.” Jiang Yan replied after sending a message. Zhou Wen held his phone and carefully read Jiang Yan’s message again. He found the sentence interesting. It had a myriad of possibilities that ranged from something trivial to something major.

If it’s something that’s most important… Zhou Wen thought carefully and found it unlikely.

Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before an idea came to him. He wanted to visit Dubhe.

Of course, he couldn’t do so using the Cube. Other humans might find it difficult to reach Dubhe, but Zhou Wen wasn’t one of them. Singularity Universe’s interstellar teleportation ability would easily allow him to reach Dubhe.

With his defenses, he could reach the vicinity of Dubhe without entering it. The high temperature of Dubhe shouldn’t be able to injure him.

Zhou Wen mainly wanted to see if there was a tiny palm symbol in Dubhe’s dimensional zone. This was the most important thing to him.

However, space was just too dangerous. Who knew if there were terrifying cosmic creatures waiting for an opportunity near Dubhe.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to take Chick with him. The Dubhe was hot, a perfect stage for Chick.

However, without Chick, it would be too dangerous for Guide City if the skeleton legion appeared again. Typical Companion Beasts couldn’t be too far from their owners. The Dubhe was too far away. It was impossible for him to leave a Companion Beast to watch over the base.

This is troublesome. The baby bear looks silly and I don’t know how strong it is. I definitely can’t let it watch over the base. Unfortunately, the antelope didn’t come to Guide City. Otherwise, I would be at ease with it in school. After some thought, Zhou Wen couldn’t think of a good idea. He was afraid that something would happen to Guide City while he was away.

“Old Zhou, what’s going on? Why didn’t you invite me over when there was such a fun place?” Just as Zhou Wen was considering the matter, he suddenly heard a familiar voice.

Before long, Li Xuan kicked open the yard door and swaggered in.

“Can’t you wait for me to open the door?” Zhou Wen said gloomily, but he realized that Li Xuan hadn’t come alone. There was someone behind him.

“Qin Zhen? Why are you together?” Zhou Wen saw that the person who had followed Li Xuan was the famous Female Sword Immortal, Qin Zhen.

“Don’t misunderstand. We were heading in the same direction. She’s here for you,” Li Xuan said with a cheeky smile.

“Senior, I heard that you are establishing a human city in Guide City. Is the school still lacking teachers?” Qin Zhen asked Zhou Wen.

“Yes, of course. However, the remuneration we provide here can’t compare to Sunset College’s. As you can see, there’s no answer to when the school will return to normal,” Zhou Wen said.

“I just need a place to stay,” Qin Zhen said seriously.

“What are you considering? Hurry up and arrange a place for her to stay,” Li Xuan said.

“Alright. As long as you are willing to stay, I won’t treat you unfairly in the future.” Zhou Wen was in need of help. A sword expert like Qin Zhen had been a tutor at Sunset College to begin with. It was a rare opportunity.

Qin Zhen didn’t say anything else and only nodded.

“I’ll find you a place to stay.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to settle them in elsewhere, he heard a voice coming from outside the yard.

“Zhou Wen, if you don’t mind, count the two of us in.” Two more people walked in following the man’s voice.

“Tian Xiangdong, Fang Ruoxi, why are you here?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw his two former classmates.

Just like Zhou Wen, they had been admitted into Sunset College. However, Zhou Wen didn’t graduate. The two of them had left Luoyang after graduation. As they hadn’t contacted each other, Zhou Wen didn’t know where they had gone after graduation.

However, having not seen them in Guide City, Zhou Wen imagined that they had moved to another city.

“What are you talking about? This is our hometown. When our hometown is in trouble, we naturally have to come back to support it.” Tian Xiangdong chuckled. “Actually, I’m working in the Federation’s political commentary department now. The higher-ups want me to be their informant and report any information gathered.”

Fang Ruoxi also said bluntly, “My situation is about the same. If there’s anything that’s not too important, leave it to me. I will do what I can for my hometown.”

The two of them made themselves clear and handed the choice to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen smiled and said, “It’s naturally best to have free labor. Come with me. I’ll find a place for you to stay.”

Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid that the other factions would send spies. It was pointless fearing that. Even if it wasn’t Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong, there would be other spies.

Instead of wasting time guessing who the spy was, it was better to keep Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong. Regardless of whether they were doing it on account of sentiment or not, they were still very good workers. They were all elites who had graduated from Sunset College and were in the government departments.

The school didn’t have plenty of room left, but Zhou Wen still managed to arrange a single room for them. Although it was a room changed from a school office, it was the best he could offer under the present conditions.

Qin Zhen didn’t mind at all. She tidied up the room and put down her luggage before going over to Zhou Wen and asking, “Senior, what can I do?”

“No rush. Get some rest for today. There will be many things waiting for you in the future,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

Qin Zhen nodded and surprisingly returned to her room to rest.

“This junior isn’t bad,” Li Xuan said with a smile as he walked.
