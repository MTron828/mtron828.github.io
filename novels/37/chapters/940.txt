Chapter 941: Fruit Ripens

“Where’s the bell?” Zhou Wen wanted to say something to the ice maiden when he suddenly heard The Thearch’s voice in his mind.

“The Thearch, something wrong happened during the teleportation. I didn’t find the tower you mentioned,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Impossible. The bronze tripod can only teleport to one place. You must have been able to see that tower.” Although The Thearch said so, she seemed to be holding back.

She didn’t see Doctor Darkness holding the bell, and the bell could only be held by experts at or above the Terror grade. Ordinary storage spaces couldn’t store the bell.

“I’m telling the truth.” Zhou Wen immediately recounted his experience.

When The Thearch heard his description of the volcanic region, she believed him a little. This was because it was very difficult to enter that area from Earth or the dimension. If Zhou Wen had only heard of the existence of such a place, it was impossible for him to describe it in such detail.

Strange, how did he teleport there? In the cave, The Thearch muttered to herself. She already believed that Zhou Wen hadn’t obtained the bell.

The place she wanted Zhou Wen to go was in a dimensional space. And with Zhou Wen in that volcanic area, it was impossible for him to enter another dimension, so it was naturally impossible for him to find the tower to obtain the bell.

“That’s not right. If you hadn’t entered the dimension, how could you have helped the Nine-Tailed Fox pass her message to the Emperor of Shang?” The Thearch suddenly realized something.

When Zhou Wen heard The Thearch’s words, he knew that nothing in Chess Mountain could hide from her. Thankfully, he only needed to use his mind to converse with the ice maiden in the chaos space. He likely hadn’t been discovered by The Thearch. All he could do was continue, “I’m not done. After I arrived at the volcanic area, I saw a huge mountain peak. It was like a heavenly pillar that pierced into the sky. I thought the tower you mentioned was atop that, so I ascended it. To my surprise, I didn’t see the tower, but I saw an ice castle...”

Zhou Wen fabricated some changes filled with half-truths. He didn’t mention the Heaven Shrouding Bell or the ice maiden that he had abducted and brought to Earth.

What you want is the bell in the tower. The one I have isn’t the bell in the tower. It’s naturally not what you want, Zhou Wen thought. He planned on getting the Heaven Shrouding Bell from the ice maiden and monopolizing it for himself.

Seeing how detailed Zhou Wen was, The Thearch knew that something had gone wrong with Zhou Wen’s teleportation. It was already lucky for him to return alive.

“I never expected such a teleportation mistake to happen to the bronze tripod. How strange. Did you do anything during the teleportation?” The Thearch asked in thought.

“What could I do? I was just waiting for the teleportation,” Zhou Wen said.

The Thearch thought for a moment and felt that Zhou Wen’s strength wasn’t capable of affecting the spatial teleportation. Furthermore, he wasn’t a fool. Why would he deliberately make a mess of the teleportation coordinates?

Unable to figure it out, The Thearch didn’t say anything else. She waited until Zhou Wen walked to the flower outside Chess Mountain before saying, “Swear to the flower that you didn’t obtain the bell.”

Although The Thearch didn’t think there was anything wrong with what Zhou Wen had said, she didn’t trust him.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen raised his hand and swore at the flower on the mountain wall. “I swear that I didn’t see the tower or obtain a bell from the tower. If there’s any falsehood, I’ll be condemned by my conscience for life.”

Boom!

A clap of thunder sounded out of thin air. It looked like the power of the oath had taken effect, but Zhou Wen was safe and sound. Only then did The Thearch believe him.

“The Thearch, if there’s nothing else, I’ll head back now.” Zhou Wen bade farewell and left Chess Mountain to return to school.

Although The Thearch felt that something was amiss, she couldn’t figure out what it was.

After Zhou Wen left Chess Mountain, he finally heaved a sigh of relief. Although this trip to the dimension was extremely dangerous, it wasn’t without harvests. At the very least, now that the ice maiden was in his hands, he would be able to obtain the Heaven Shrouding Bell sooner or later.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the ice maiden seemed to be completely unaffected by Earth in the chaos space. The taboo power restriction she mentioned didn’t appear.

The ice maiden remained cooped up in the ice castle. It looked like she was thinking of a solution, but with the Heaven Shrouding Bell useless, the chances of her escaping were almost zero, so Zhou Wen wasn’t too worried.

Before he arrived on campus, Zhou Wen received a lot of messages from his phone. Some were from Li Xuan, Wang Lu, and even Zhang Yuzhi.

Zhou Wen replied to some messages and also learned of recent events.

The most important thing was that another Guardian had appeared on the rankings. Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised by a Guardian’s appearance. What surprised him was that the Guardian on the rankings was named Burial Immortal.

Is Senior Jiang Yan finally taking action? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

However, Burial Immortal was only ranked third. He didn’t challenge the two Guardians ahead of him. Up to now, there hadn’t been any battles between Guardians.

However, Zhou Wen knew very well that a war between Guardians was inevitable. They would fight sooner or later.

Recently, Zhou Wen had also figured out some things. The Guardians were sent by the dimensional races to vie for control of Earth, so they likely wouldn’t want to destroy Earth wantonly. There was a high chance that their battle would be carried out inside the cube.

Zhou Wen even felt that this cube ranking battle was actually prepared for Guardians, not just meant to rank pets.

Unfortunately, I haven’t advanced to the Mythical stage, so I can’t participate in the battle. If I want to kill those Guardians, I have to find them in reality, Zhou Wen thought. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“You’re back?” A message came over. It was from Ya’er. Ya’er had probably seen his account come online and knew that Zhou Wen had returned.

Zhou Wen hurriedly replied: “I just came back. I haven’t reached the city yet. I’ll pick you up now.”

“Waiting for you.” Ya’er replied.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to first head to the An family to fetch Ya’er.

As he walked, the mysterious phone suddenly vibrated. Zhou Wen was alarmed as he imagined that a new dimensional zone had appeared in the city. When he took it out, he realized that the fruit on the Dead Man Tree had ripened.

Xia Jiuhuang’s fruit has finally ripened. Zhou Wen was still looking forward to Xia Jiuhuang’s fruit.

After all, Xia Jiuhuang had already advanced to the Mythical stage back then. Furthermore, he had fused nine Life Providences and nine Life Souls. This was something ordinary humans didn’t possess.

Xia Jiuhuang still had all sorts of strange Essence Energy Skills. If all of this could be inherited by the Companion Beast, the Companion Beast’s abilities would definitely be extremely powerful.

Most importantly, the Companion Beasts born on the Dead Man Tree were unique. Zhou Wen felt that it wouldn’t disappoint him, so he looked at the fruit on the Dead Man Tree.
