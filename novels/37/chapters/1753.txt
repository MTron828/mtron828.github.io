Chapter 1754 The Weakest Disciple

“Zhou’s Weakest Disciple, Ming Xiu! What the hell is this?”

“Zhou? Which Zhou? Isn’t his surname Ming?”

“Holy sh*t, could it be Zhou Wen?”.

“That’s a little ridiculous. Zhou Wen might not even be able to reach such a level.” “Is this a prank? From the looks of it, Swordsman Tomorrow has a good relationship with Zhou Wen.”

“This joke is too much… Zhou’s disciple… and the weakest at that…”

When they saw Ming Xiu’s name on the rankings, there was an uproar. It was totally unacceptable. The first human to pluck the golden apple was actually a young man’s disciple. It was fine if he was a disciple, but to claim that he was the weakest—no matter how one looked at it, he appeared to be deliberately posturing.

“Coach, I’m ranked ninth. Is that alright?” Ming Xiu walked out with a grin.

“It’s alright.” Zhou Wen never expected Ming Xiu to leave such a name on the rankings. However, it didn’t matter. He looked at the girl and said, “How about it? Is my disciple’s name on the rankings now?”

The girl’s expression turned nasty as she gritted her teeth and said, “He’s clearly the representative of the Inter race. He used the power of the Inter race. How is that because you’re his teacher?”

“Why? Have you swallowed your previous words?” Li Xuan mocked. The girl’s lips moved as though she wanted to say something, but she couldn’t.

“Not convinced?” Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush as he asked the girl with a smile.

“Of course not. He’s clearly the representative of the Inter race. How can he be considered a student of yours?” The girl was naturally indignant.

“Alright, since you aren’t convinced, I’ll make sure you are convinced.” Zhou Wen could sense that although the girl looked ordinary, she had an extremely terrifying aura. He didn’t wish to force her, so he gave Feng Qiuyan a look.

Feng Qiuyan wasn’t a person who liked to waste his breath. When he saw Zhou Wen’s look, he walked straight to the Cube and started the challenge.

“This is also my student. If he leaves his name on the rankings, will you submit?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile. “Hmph, leave a name before we speak.” The girl was very stubborn, but she was already feeling a little nervous.

Zhou Wen smiled and didn’t say anything else. He turned to look at the Cube’s screen.

Everyone was still immersed in the excitement of having the first human pluck the golden apple. Many people were discussing what Ming Xiu’s Zhou’s Weakest Disciple meant.

Most people who knew guessed that Ming Xiu was referring to Zhou Wen, but how could the average person know? There were many ordinary people in the East District who knew that Ming Xiu had joined Guide City. The ordinary people in the other districts had never even heard of Ming Xiu’s name, so how could they know where he was?

Many people were asking who Zhou referred to. Those who knew Zhou Wen’s name immediately posted Zhou Wen’s name on the Internet as well as his relationship with Ming Xiu.

“For real? From what you’re saying, Zhou Wen is only about Ming Xiu’s age. How can he be Ming Xiu’s teacher? Are you joking?”

“He must be joking. No matter how powerful Zhou Wen is, it’s impossible for him to be stronger than Ming Xiu, right?”

“That’s right. Ming Xiu is already a top existence among humans. How old is Zhou Wen? How can he be Ming Xiu’s teacher!?”

As everyone discussed, they suddenly saw the Cube’s screen light up again.

“Holy sh*t, another human is attempting the level. What day is it today? Nobody tried previously, but when it rains, it pours!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Who is that person? He also looks unfamiliar!”

“I don’t know him. He’s less famous than Swordsman Tomorrow.”

“Don’t tell me he thinks that Ming Xiu did it easily, so he thinks that the dimensional zone is easy and wants to try his luck?”

It was no wonder they didn’t know Feng Qiuyan. Feng Qiuyan was much more low-key than Ming Xiu. Many people in the East District knew the name of Swordsman Tomorrow. Few people in the East District knew Feng Qiuyan’s name, much less the other districts. “Professor Gu, do you know this Feng Qiuyan?” As expected of a host, Su Yi was quite knowledgeable. She immediately called out Feng Qiuyan’s name. However, she had only seen some information about him and knew that there was such a person. She didn’t know much about Feng Qiuyan’s strength.

“If I remember correctly, this Feng Qiuyan should be from the South Sea’s Feng family. Now that the South Sea has fallen, there aren’t any humans living there. I wonder where the Feng family has moved to.” Professor Gu was rather professional as he directly revealed Feng Qiuyan’s origins.

“Do you think Feng Qiuyan has a chance of plucking the golden apple?” Su Yi asked again.

“There’s definitely a chance, but it’s very small. Although Swordsman Tomorrow has already scouted the Fog Lake and it’s theoretically much easier for people to clear it later, Feng Qiuyan is too anxious. If he spent more time on preparation, the chances would be much higher. He’s too rash… However, there aren’t many golden apples left now. It’s understandable that he’s anxious…” Professor Gu meant that Feng Qiuyan was too eager for success and wanted to take the opportunity to pick up the spoils.

However, just as Professor Gu said that, he saw Feng Qiuyan appear above the Lake of Fog. Then, without doing anything else, he drew his saber and slashed forward.

Boom!

The saber beam slashed down like the blade of heavenly punishment, splitting the fog in front of him into two. The fog churned to the sides, revealing a straight and wide path.

The saber beam didn’t stop as it slashed at the lake, splitting it into two. The waves surged to the sides as though they were separated by divine power as they extended into the distance.

At the end of the slash, one could see the divine tree with the golden apple. Feng Qiuyan’s body was like a stream of light as he instantly rushed to the island and landed in front of the divine tree.

He drew his saber and slashed again. He chopped off a golden apple which landed in his hand.

All of this happened too quickly. Everyone was still waiting to see how Feng Qiuyan would clear the level. Feng Qiuyan’s attempt ended before they were mentally prepared.

Only when the Cube’s screen jumped from the dimensional zone to the Cube’s rankings did people snap to their senses and break into an uproar. “F*ck, what did I just see?”

“Heavens, slap me. Was I dreaming?” “I’m probably still f*cking asleep, right? That’s it?”

“Where did this person come from? He’s too

powerful!”

“When did such a sicko appear among us humans?”

“Who said that we humans don’t have powerhouses? This Feng Qiuyan isn’t inferior to any dimensional creature…”

The comments were crazy. The screen was filled with question marks. No one could believe that such an unknown young man had cleared the level in such a domineering manner.

However, when they saw the name Feng Qiuyan left on the rankings, they weren’t just going crazy. They practically became berserk.
