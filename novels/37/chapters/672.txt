Chapter 673: Clearing the Parasite Spores

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen returned to his dorm with the Great Might Vajra Bull Companion Egg. He originally considered entering Dragon Gate Grotto, but when he saw Feng Qiuyan in the tent, he was shocked.

He saw two mushrooms growing on Feng Qiuyan’s face.

“Why are there mushrooms on your face?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

Before he left, he had already gotten Tai Sui to clean up the spores in the tent. After sealing the tent, there shouldn’t have been any problems.

Feng Qiuyan said with a smile, “I’m fine. I was just curious. I unzipped the tent and wanted to take a look at the situation outside, but who knew that I would succumb to it? However, it’s not a big deal. There should be a way to resolve it.”

“In your dreams. The military experts and tutors are studying the Parasite Spores, but they still haven’t found a way to eliminate the mushrooms. Do you know that many soldiers have fainted because of the mushrooms? They might be like vegetative humans that won’t wake up again.” Zhou Wen was somewhat anxious.

“Then what should we do? I originally imagined that Brother Sheng was fine when he came. We just wanted to see the situation outside and didn’t even go out. I originally imagined that nothing would happen, but I never expected Little Yanyan to fall victim,” Li Xuan said gloomily.

“You’re fine?” Zhou Wen sized up Li Xuan. Feng Qiuyan had fallen victim. Logically speaking, with the numerous spores, it was impossible for only two to float in. It was odd that Li Xuan hadn’t succumbed to it.

“It should be because I’m wearing my carapace. I don’t have any mushrooms growing on me,” Li Xuan said.

“That’s very likely.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s fine. With so many tutors and military experts researching day and night, it’s only a matter of time before they can come up with a treatment,” Feng Qiuyan ended up consoling them.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said to Feng Qiuyan, “I have something that could work, but it’s not guaranteed to be effective. It might end up completely useless. Do you want to give it a try?”

Feng Qiuyan didn’t ask Zhou Wen what method he had and said, “Coach, feel free to try. It’s best if it works. It’s fine if it’s useless.”

Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he summoned Doctor Darkness. Then, he got Doctor Darkness to use Fight Poison With Poison to inject some poison into the mushrooms.

The mushrooms quickly withered and fell off automatically.

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan waited for a while longer. Seeing that there weren’t any mushrooms growing on the wound on Feng Qiuyan’s face, they were overjoyed.

An Tianzuo had arrived at Leng Zongzheng’s office. He was brewing tea for Leng Zongzheng while An Sheng stood silently to the side.

“Teacher, isn’t it a little too hasty for you to give Zhou Wen the Great Might Vajra Bull Companion Egg?” An Tianzuo held the teacup with both hands and said.

Leng Zongzheng said with a smile, “I’ve already seen some of his abilities. He should be able to control the Great Might Vajra Bull.”

“Teacher, you think too highly of him. Although he does have some talent and is quite lucky to have obtained some Mythical Companion Beasts, he’s still a student after all. His experience and mental state aren’t mature enough. He hasn’t experienced much, so I’m afraid he won’t be able to deal with sudden and unknown crises. Instead, he will be a burden on us,” An Tianzuo said.

“I remember that when you were his age, you had already led the Sunset Army to battle everywhere. You engaged in a slaughter in many dimensional zones, right? In that case, he’s not young anymore,” Leng Zongzheng said as he sipped his tea.

“How can that be the same? I was trained from a young age. I’ve experienced countless life-and-death situations, but he hasn’t experienced any setbacks. Relying on him for this matter is unreliable. Why don’t you reconsider?” An Tianzuo said.

Leng Zongzheng smiled at An Tianzuo and said, “Are you afraid that he won’t do well, or are you afraid that he will be in danger?”

“Of course I’m afraid that he screws up and implicates us,” An Tianzuo immediately answered.

“So that’s how it is. Then, it’s fine. Even if he can’t help much, it’s not a problem for him to control the Great Might Vajra Bull. As for whether he will die in there or not, it doesn’t matter since you aren’t concerned,” Leng Zongzheng said with his eyes narrowed as he sipped his tea.

“Teacher, you should have heard that the empress dowager in my family dotes on him very much. If he were to die inside, I wouldn’t mind, but I’m afraid that the person back home wouldn’t agree to it. When that happens, not only will I have a headache, but you will also have a headache, right?” An Tianzuo said.

“So that’s how it is.” Leng Zongzheng looked enlightened as he took a sip of tea and said, “However, I think Zhou Wen has quite a lot of combat experience. His adaptability isn’t bad either, and he has quite a number of Companion Beasts. With the Great Might Vajra Bull’s protection, there shouldn’t be much of a problem.”

An Tianzuo was about to say something when a soldier reported, “Overseer, there’s news from the research institute. The problem of the Parasite Spores has been resolved.”

An Tianzuo was overjoyed when he heard that. He got up and asked, “Excellent, that’s great. Which expert or tutor came up with the solution?”

Although the Parasite Spores were very weak, the effects they brought gave even An Tianzuo a headache. If they weren’t resolved in time, the Sunset Army and the college would suffer a heavy blow.

The soldier answered, “According to the news we received, a student’s Companion Beast can restrain the Parasite Spores. The unconscious soldiers who he helped have already woken up. The mushrooms automatically peel off and stop growing. Currently, the student is clearing out the Parasite Spores on the soldiers and tutors.”

“Student?” An Tianzuo frowned slightly.

Leng Zongzheng smiled and asked, “What’s the student’s name?”

“His name is Zhou Wen. He was the one who rushed into the dimensional creature horde yesterday to kill the golden bull,” the soldier immediately answered.

Leng Zongzheng turned his head to look at An Tianzuo and said, “What did I say? This Zhou Wen is still alright. He resolved a problem that so many people couldn’t. If you say he’s unsuitable, who else is more suitable?”

...

Zhou Wen used Doctor Darkness to remove the Parasite Spores on everyone. Doctor Darkness’s Fight Poison With Poison was indeed useful. As long as he injected it into the spores, the spores would quickly die and there wouldn’t be a relapse.

“Little Wen, well done.” Qin Wufu was the last to receive Zhou Wen’s treatment. He patted Zhou Wen’s shoulder and said, “Think about it again. Join me after graduation. You can name any conditions you want.”

“It’s still a long time before graduation. I haven’t considered these matters,” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s about time to consider it carefully. The situation in the various parts of the Federation isn’t too good right now. I wonder how many more years we can last,” Qin Wufu said with a sigh.

After busying himself for more than a day, he finally removed all the spores that had parasitized people. When Zhou Wen returned to the tent, he originally wanted to take out the Great Might Vajra Companion Egg and hatch it.

However, he realized that Tai Sui had completed its evolution. He hurriedly summoned it to see what changes it had.
