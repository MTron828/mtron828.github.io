Chapter 1162: Zhou Wen’s Return

“Sis, this person has a fiancée,” Qin Mu hurriedly reminded Qin Zhen.

However, Qin Zhen ignored Qin Mu as if she hadn’t heard him.

“Not bad with your sword practice,” Zhou Wen praised as he looked at Qin Zhen. His words came from the bottom of his heart. To be able to master the sword art to such an extent using just a notebook was indeed extraordinary.

Although he hadn’t seen Qin Zhen use a sword, he could roughly tell from Qin Mu, whom she had taught.

Only Zhou Wen could say ‘not bad.’ In the eyes of others, it wasn’t as simple as ‘not bad.’

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, the students and Qin Mu had the urge to roll their eyes. Was there a need for him to praise the female sword immortal’s sword art? Furthermore, what did he mean by ‘not bad?’ Was he praising or criticizing her?

“I don’t deserve so much praise, Senior. My sword art still has many shortcomings. It’s not even a fraction of yours. If not for your guidance, I wouldn’t have my achievements today...” Qin Zhen said seriously.

Upon hearing Qin Zhen’s words, the entire campus seemed to explode. Qin Mu widened his eyes and stared at Zhou Wen in disbelief.

“Who is this person? Qin Zhen actually said that her sword art was thanks to his pointers?”

“Is there such an impressive figure in our school?”

“In terms of sword arts, I’m afraid only Overseer An and Chancellor Leng can guide the female Sword Immortal. However, this person is so young. He definitely isn’t Chancellor Leng or Overseer An.”

“I think Qin Zhen is being polite. This person might be the teacher who initiated her journey.”

“Yes, that must be it. However, he’s not very old. He’s not much older than Qin Zhen. How can he have initiated her journey?”

“What’s this senior’s name? Does no one know him?”

As everyone discussed, Qin Zhen continued, “Senior, there are still many things that I don’t understand about my sword art. Can you give me some pointers? I’m willing to pay any price.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Everyone was dumbfounded when she said that. Qin Zhen, the Federation’s female Sword Immortal, actually wanted him to give pointers for her sword art. This was definitely not something a teacher who initiated her journey could do. The only possibility was that this person’s sword arts were better than Qin Zhen’s—and not just by a little.

“Who is he? Could he be the legendary Swordsman Tomorrow, Ming Xiu? I heard that Ming Xiu had once attended classes at our school. Perhaps he had taught Qin Zhen back then.”

“It’s not Professor Ming. It’s not like we haven’t seen Professor Ming’s photo before. This senior isn’t as delicate as Ming Xiu.”

“Ming Xiu might not necessarily be stronger than Qin Zhen, right?”

...

“Sis... This... Who is this senior?” Qin Mu stammered.

“This is Senior Zhou Wen. How can you not know him?” Qin Zhen finally heard Qin Mu’s words and answered.

“Zhou Wen... He’s the Zhou Wen who was once invincible among his peers and suppressed the younger generation of the six families!”

“Holy sh*t, so it’s him. No wonder. I just didn’t expect Qin Zhen to have learned her sword art from him.”

“I heard that he has been holding down the fort at Chess Mountain for the past few years. It’s no wonder I don’t recognize him.”

Upon hearing Qin Zhen say Zhou Wen’s name, many students felt relieved. Although Zhou Wen wasn’t in school most of the time, he was one of Sunset College’s legends.

“Follow me,” Zhou Wen said to Qin Zhen before turning to leave.

Qin Zhen immediately followed without any hesitation. Everyone wanted to follow, but Zhou Wen and company quickly left campus, while the students couldn’t.

Zhou Wen took Qin Zhen to the An family’s training room and got her to showcase her sword art. She was stronger than Zhou Wen expected. Qin Zhen’s talent and concept in sword arts were also better than his expectations.

“Wait a moment.” Zhou Wen took out a pen and paper from the Chaos Bead and planned on writing down his experience of Transcendent Flying Immortal for Qin Zhen.

Zhou Wen didn’t care if his sword art would spread. If someone could learn his sword art, he had the hope that there would be a few more people like Qin Zhen among humans.

Unfortunately, Transcendent Flying Immortal had extremely high requirements for cultivators. It was difficult to gain basic mastery, and it was even more difficult to achieve anything higher. Therefore, it wasn’t suitable for most people to cultivate.

Sei Gasakai had also fused the concept of Transcendent Flying Immortal into the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū that made it easy for others to pick up. Although it resolved the problem of most people finding it difficult to gain basic mastery, it also indirectly raised the difficulty of reaching the pinnacle.

For Zhou Wen, a person like Qin Zhen was a rare inheritor who could pick up his mantle.

...

That night, An Tianzuo sat at the dining table and saw An Sheng and An Jing sitting on both sides. He said with a frown, “He’s getting more and more unruly. Doesn’t he know that it’s time to eat? Even if he’s not hungry, doesn’t he know that children need to eat more during their growth spurt?”

An Sheng hurriedly said, “Overseer, Young Master Wen brought a guest back. He’s currently busy in the training room.”

“What guest is more important than Ya’er’s body? If he wants to entertain guests, why doesn’t he let Ya’er come back for dinner?” An Tianzuo snorted coldly.

“I went to get Ya’er just now. She said she’s not hungry,” An Sheng said.

An Tianzuo couldn’t help but frown. After a pause, he asked, “Who did he bring back?”

“It’s Qin Zhen,” An Sheng answered.

“Qin Zhen?” An Tianzuo was slightly taken aback. “That female Sword Immortal from the college?”

“Yes, Overseer.”

“What are they doing in the training room?” An Tianzuo asked.

“I’m not sure. Perhaps they are sparring,” An Sheng said.

An Tianzuo was no stranger to the name Qin Zhen. There were very few experts from Sunset College—Hui Haifeng, Feng Qiuyan, Li Xuan, and Wei Ge were all very famous figures in the Federation.

However, there weren’t many who were truly willing to stay at Sunset College for the An family and Luoyang.

Hui Haifeng was now the Federal President, while Feng Qiuyan was the pride of the Sea Return family. Although Li Xuan’s Li family was a wealthy family in Luoyang, Li Mobai was the one in charge. He wasn’t an easy person to deal with. Sometimes, even An Tianzuo had a headache over him.

Li Xuan was out most of the year and seldom returned.

There was no need to mention Wei Ge. He was in charge of the Special Investigation Bureau and was the eyes and ears of the Federation. Now that he had joined the League of Guardians, it was even more impossible for him to be used by the An family.

Among the experts remaining on campus, Qin Zhen was the strongest.

However, An Tianzuo always believed that Qin Zhen was more suitable for the battlefield than teaching in school. Therefore, he had personally persuaded Qin Zhen to join the army many times, but Qin Zhen had rejected him.

Through their interaction, An Tianzuo knew that Qin Zhen wasn’t someone who was afraid of challenges, but for some reason, she was unwilling to leave the school.

An Tianzuo found it odd that Qin Zhen had followed Zhou Wen to the An family home. After some thought, he stood up and said, “Let’s go take a look.”

An Sheng and An Jing got up and followed An Tianzuo to the training room. They were also very curious about what Zhou Wen and Qin Zhen were doing.
