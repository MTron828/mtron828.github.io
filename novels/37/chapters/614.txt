Chapter 615 Benefits of the Ranking

With the augmentation of his Life Providence and Life Soul, Zhou Wen realized something when he watched Sadie battle.

So it’s not that she has reached the realm of Minute Subtlety, but she’s relying on her Life Soul. What kind of Life Soul is that? It actually allows her to possess the ability of Minute Subtlety? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Sadie was fighting many alone. Although she was in a sorry state, she wasn’t injured from the gank. This was quite shocking.

Unfortunately, with so many Tiger Cage Demonized Generals surrounding her, Sadie couldn’t rush out of the encirclement. Her Essence Energy and stamina were very limited, so it was only a matter of time before she died.

This proves that no matter how strong one’s ability is, it’s best to be careful. In such a world, who knows what kind of enemy one will encounter? Once restrained, no matter how strong one’s ability is, one won’t be able to deny death. However, Sadie’s ability isn’t bad. If I can obtain her Essence Energy Art, I wonder if I can use the Lost Immortal Sutra to condense the same Life Soul? Zhou Wen was just musing for a moment. Even if he had the same Essence Energy Art, he might not necessarily be able to condense the same Life Soul. The formation of a Life Soul was determined by a person’s physique and mental strength. Therefore, everyone’s Life Soul was somewhat different. There weren’t two absolutely identical Life Souls.

It was the same for a Life Providence. The functions might be similar, but not completely identical.

Furthermore, even with the Lost Immortal Sutra, condensing a Life Soul wasn’t easy. One needed a special energy with similar attributes as a foundation. Only then could the Lost Immortal Sutra simulate condensing a Life Soul.

Now that I’m thinking about it, my First Order of Chaos hasn’t condensed a Life Soul. I wonder if I can use a drop of Grim Demon’s blood as a foundation to condense a Life Soul? Zhou Wen set his sights on Grim Demon.

With Demonic Neonate as his master, he probably wouldn’t dare to object to having him release some blood.

While Zhou Wen was considering how to condense the Life Soul of the First Order of Chaos with the blood of Grim Demon, Sadie was struggling to remain safe.

She originally imagined that a dimensional zone like Tiger Cage Pass couldn’t have Mythical creatures. With her Eye of Odin Life Soul, it wasn’t difficult to kill Epic dimensional creatures. Even if she couldn’t beat them, she had a chance of escaping.

Who knew that she would encounter a terrifying existence like the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet. She didn’t even have a chance to escape.

Zhou Wen watched from outside the city. She knew that Zhou Wen definitely had the ability to help her escape, but her pride prevented her from asking him. All she could do was summon her Companion Beasts and desperately attempt to rush out of the city.

It wasn’t easy for her to kill a Tiger Cage Demonized General and find a gap, but before she could rush out, she saw the Elegant Emperor’s Avatar Puppet throw out another stack of yellow paper. Instantly, more than ten Tiger Cage Demonized Generals landed. Not only did they seal off the way out, but they also made her situation worse.

Sadie immediately fell into despair. She was surrounded by twenty to thirty Tiger Cage Demonized Generals. Even if her Eye of Odin could see the path needed to get out, her body couldn’t keep up.

The reason the six families didn’t let young people use Mythical Companion Beasts was because of this principle. Young people were hot-blooded, especially young geniuses. They were all arrogant and impulsive. Having powerful strength only made it easier for them to fall into danger.

Therefore, even if they had Mythical Companion Beasts, the various families would give them to people who had some experience and had been burnished by reality. They were calm and capable.

Although they were about the same age, Lance would definitely not make such a decision if he were here.

Sadie’s Essence Energy was almost depleted. A Companion Beast beside her was attacked and ended up slamming into her. Immediately, her trajectory deviated. It was too late to dodge the attacks of the Tiger Cage Demonized Generals.

Sadie gritted her teeth and prepared to risk her life. However, she suddenly saw a flash of saber light. The Tiger Cage Demonized Generals beside her suddenly stopped their attacks. With a poof, white mist emitted from them as they transformed into yellow paper figurines that landed on the ground. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

She turned her head and saw Zhou Wen standing beside the masked man. As for the masked man, his head had been chopped off.

Zhou Wen walked to Sadie’s side and asked, "What’s the secret regarding the Companion Beast ranking you mentioned?"

Sadie looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression before saying, "Actually, this isn’t really a secret. There should be quite a number of people in the six families who know about it. In fact, obtaining first place on the rankings isn’t the only way to get benefits."

"What do you mean? Isn’t the one coming in first place qualified to pluck the divine fruit?" Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

"Picking the divine fruit is indeed something first place qualifies for. However, it’s still unknown if one can really pluck it. However, as long as one can enter the ranking, they’ll be able to obtain the corresponding benefits. It doesn’t matter if the ranking is high. Although, if it is high, there are more benefits," said Sadie.

"What benefits?" Zhou Wen had never heard of such a thing.

"I’m not sure yet. I’ll only know what benefits we can obtain after the ranking battle ends," Sadie said.

"Where did this news come from?" Zhou Wen frowned slightly. Sadie’s words seemed unbelievable.

The ranking had not long appeared, and it was unprecedented. Even if there was really a reward after the ranking battle, how did the six families know of that?

"I’m not sure about the source of the news, but it shouldn’t be wrong. For the six families and overseas factions to be so eager in rushing up the rankings, it’s definitely not without reason," Sadie said.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if Sadie really didn’t know or if she was just unwilling to say.

"It’s about time. Let’s head back." Zhou Wen didn’t ask further.

Sadie walked back with Zhou Wen, but her emotions were mixed. Although she was confident that her acumen was better than Zhou Wen’s, the difference in combat experience was just too great. No matter how good her acumen was, it was useless. It was no different from having psychomotor problems. She felt that there was no need to challenge Zhou Wen again.

An opponent she had no way to fend against was easily killed by Zhou Wen. In front of absolute strength, the effects of her acumen were too minute.

I have to become stronger than him. Sadie cursed inwardly as she stared at Zhou Wen’s back.

Could it be that The Thearch is secretly up to no good? Zhou Wen didn’t care what Sadie was thinking. His mind was on the rankings.

Back then, it was The Thearch who had allowed John to obtain the six-winged seraphim Guardian. It wouldn’t be surprising if she had spread the news of the ranking.

There’s also a possibility that it’s Teacher Wang Mingyuan. The news might have come from his side as well. Zhou Wen felt that the possibility wasn’t small.

There were many experts in the Federation who entered the dimensional zones after a mutation. No one knew if there were any people that the Federation had deliberately planted among them.

If there was, it was not impossible to get news from them.

From the looks of it, I have to go back and ask The Thearch. Zhou Wen decided to take the opportunity of delivering items to The Thearch to ask about the ranking.
