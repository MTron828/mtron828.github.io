Chapter 934: Student Surpasses the Master

“Oh, then I want to know the reason. Why must I take you away?” The ice maiden wasn’t angry. From her point of view, Zhou Wen’s words were like an ant bragging to an elephant. It was nothing but a joke.

Zhou Wen said, “It’s very simple. This is because you previously said that you have to leave this place within three hours. In that case, as long as I enter the ice castle, you can only take me with you once the three hours are up.”

“Does that mean you plan on walking into my trap?” the ice maiden mocked.

As Zhou Wen could teleport, it wasn’t easy for her to capture him outside. However, the ice castle was only that big. Furthermore, the ice castle had a very powerful augmentation effect on her.

The ice maiden’s power could fill the entire ice castle. As long as Zhou Wen was inside, he had nowhere to hide.

Previously, she had wanted to use Zhou Wen to lure the snake monster, giving her a chance to eliminate him. That was why she had allowed Zhou Wen to easily leave the ice castle. Now, she didn’t have any scruples.

The moment Zhou Wen entered the ice castle, he was like a bird in a cage.

“It’s not walking into a trap, but a sparrow occupying a pigeon’s nest,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at the ice castle. If he wanted to leave this place, he had to enter the ice castle. There was no other way.

The ice maiden smiled. She had never smiled much in her life, but this time, she smiled. Furthermore, she smiled very happily as though she had heard an extremely funny joke.

“Then come. Let me see how you, a little sparrow, can occupy my ice castle,” said ice maiden.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen estimated that it was about time and walked towards the ice castle.

After Zhou Wen entered the ice castle, the ice maiden didn’t immediately take action. Instead, she looked at him with interest and said, “I’ve seen quite a number of humans, but you are the first to be so ignorant and arrogant. How do you want to occupy my ice castle? You can take action now.”

“If you don’t take action, I can also be a good guest,” Zhou Wen said.

“Do you know who you are talking to?” The ice maiden’s eyes flickered with a terrifying coldness as she glared at Zhou Wen.

“I was just about to ask.” Zhou Wen really didn’t know who the ice maiden was.

“The Nine-Tailed Fox dared to let you steal the Heaven Shrouding Bell, but she didn’t tell you about the four demon monarchs guarding it?” the ice maiden asked.

“What are the four demon monarchs?” Zhou Wen asked.

“What a foolish and pitiful human. You don’t even know about the four demon monarchs, but you were tricked by that demon consort to steal the Heaven Shrouding Bell. However, it makes sense. The ignorant are fearless. If you knew what kind of existence the four demon monarchs are, you probably wouldn’t have dared to come here to steal the Heaven Shrouding Bell.”

The ice maiden continued, “On Earth, so-called Mythical creatures are nothing but cannon fodder among species in the dimension. The Terror grade is the beginning of the path of the strong. Only a Calamity grade has a seat in the dimension. The four monarchs of the demons are the royal families of the four demons. The descendants of these four royal families will definitely be able to advance to the Calamity grade, and I am from the Ice Monarch race of the four royal families.”

“So you are that powerful. Then are you a Calamity grade now?” Zhou Wen asked the ice maiden.

The ice maiden choked immediately. How could it be so easy to advance to the Calamity grade? Although she was from the Ice Monarch race, she only had the talent and potential to advance to the Calamity grade. To truly advance to the Calamity grade, not only did she need talent and potential, but she also needed a large amount of resources and personal effort.

“Even if I’m not at the Calamity grade, killing you will be as easy as flipping my hand,” the ice maiden said.

Although Zhou Wen didn’t like chatting, he would rather have a chat with the ice maiden if he could leave the area without any fighting.

“Then do you know who I am?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked solemnly.

“You? You’re just a human. You’re nothing. I don’t need to know who you are,” the ice maiden said with disdain.

“Of course, you can think that I’m mediocre or that you haven’t heard of me. However, I believe you should have heard of my teacher,” Zhou Wen said.

“Who’s your teacher? Don’t tell me he’s also a human?” the ice maiden said, clearly not caring who Zhou Wen’s teacher was.

“That’s right. He’s a human. My teacher’s name is Wang Mingyuan. Have you heard of this name?” Zhou Wen actually only wanted to see if he could obtain any information about Wang Mingyuan. He didn’t think Wang Mingyuan was very strong. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Wang Mingyuan was indeed very strong among humans, but he had only recently advanced to the Mythical stage. In the dimension, the Mythical stage was nothing.

Zhou Wen used this tone to speak to the ice maiden because he wanted to use her arrogance to obtain some information about Wang Mingyuan.

However, the ice maiden’s reaction seemed to exceed Zhou Wen’s expectations. She looked at him in surprise and said, “You are Wang Mingyuan’s disciple?”

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback. From the ice maiden’s expression, she didn’t show any contempt for humans when she mentioned Wang Mingyuan.

“That’s right. I’m Wang Mingyuan’s most outstanding and most beloved disciple. How do I compare to you, the descendant of the Ice Monarch?” Zhou Wen feigned a proud expression.

The ice maiden snorted coldly and said, “Wang Mingyuan is indeed capable by defeating the Dragon King of the Octokind and becoming the new monarch of the Dragon Gods. Unfortunately, no matter how strong your teacher is, he won’t come here to save you. Your life is still in my hands. Hand over the fox core and I can spare your life. I can also send you to the Dragon Gods.”

Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that. He originally imagined that something had happened to Wang Mingyuan, but to his surprise, Wang Mingyuan seemed to have done something extraordinary.

Even the ice maiden, who looked down on humans, was somewhat afraid when mentioning Wang Mingyuan. She didn’t have any intention of underestimating him. The Dragon Monarch that Wang Mingyuan had defeated was definitely not an ordinary dimensional creature.

Zhou Wen had no idea that the monarch of the Octokind were all Calamity-grade existences. However, there were differences in strength among Calamity-grades existences. Among the Octokind, the other monarchs were only average. However, there were two monarchs who were extremely terrifying existences. Even in the dimension, they were famous. One of them was the Dragon King.

The former Dragon King was so famous that he was comparable to the four demon monarchs. As for Wang Mingyuan, he had actually defeated the Dragon King and become the new king of the Dragon Gods. This matter shocked many dimensional species.

For such an expert, even if the ice maiden looked down on ordinary humans, she wouldn’t underestimate him.

Furthermore, in essence, Wang Mingyuan was no longer a pure human.

Zhou Wen naturally didn’t know about this. However, from the ice maiden’s tone, he knew that Wang Mingyuan was doing pretty well in the dimension. Nothing bad happened because he took the divine fruit. This made him feel much better.

Zhou Wen looked at the ice maiden and said, “You dimensional species just don’t like studying. Haven’t you heard of the saying ‘the color blue is made out of indigo but is more vivid than indigo?’”

“What do you mean?” The ice maiden clearly didn’t know this human proverb.

“It means that the teacher can be very impressive, but the students they teach are even more impressive,” Zhou Wen explained seriously.
