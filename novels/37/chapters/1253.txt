Chapter 1254: Lucas’s Friend

“Did something happen at the Time Hut?” Zhou Wen asked.

The elder leading the group was very friendly. When he heard that, he said, “There’s nothing wrong with the Time Hut. However, on the path to the Time Hut, a terrifying Piranha Flower King appeared. Our team suffered great losses, so it’s best that you don’t proceed.”

“Thanks for the heads up, but we still want to take a look,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the troll Companion Beast behind their team.

It was a blue-skinned troll. It was four to five meters tall and looked extremely majestic.

On the troll’s back was a box. Zhou Wen hadn’t noticed it at first, but Zhou Wen’s sharp senses noticed it when a sound suddenly came from the box. He immediately realized that there was a woman tied up inside the box.

The woman’s hands and feet were tied up, and she was gagged. At that moment, she seemed to realize that there were others outside. Therefore, she struck the inner wall of the box with all her might, making a sound to let others discover her.

Seeing Zhou Wen look at the box, the elder said, “If you insist on going, be careful. We are in a hurry to return.”

“Wait a moment. What’s with the box?” Zhou Wen stopped the elder and asked.

Although he didn’t like being a busybody, Zhou Wen wouldn’t hold back if he could save a life.

Of course, before that, Zhou Wen had to figure out the whole story to prevent a misunderstanding.

“What has it got to do with you?” The young man glared at Zhou Wen unhappily.

However, the elder stopped the young man and said to Zhou Wen, “To be honest, the person in the box is our employer. She spent money to get us to take her to the Time Hut, but now that the Piranha Flower King has appeared on the road, none of us will go past it. A few people have already died, but she still insists on advancing. We don’t want to see her die, so we are forcefully taking her back.”

“Can I ask her a few questions?” Zhou Wen felt that the elder didn’t seem to be lying, but it was better to make things clear as it concerned a life.

“Don’t push your luck.” The young man was very unhappy.

However, the elder stopped the young man from acting up further. He turned his head and said to Zhou Wen, “Of course. Actually, what we did wasn’t right. Since we took her money, we should have taken her to her destination even if death was on the cards. However, it was a clear case of sending her to her death. There was no point in continuing. I’m already an old bag of bones. It’s fine if I die, but I can’t watch these young people die with us. We will refund her the money and double the compensation.”

With that said, the elder got someone to get the box down and open it for Zhou Wen and company to see.

“Dad, what are you doing? Is there a need to explain so much to an outsider?” When Zhou Wen and company looked at the box, the young man complained to the elder unhappily.

The elder whispered, “You’re being silly. These foreigners know nothing about the strange forest. They don’t even know the location of the Time Hut, but they were able to reach here safely. There must be extremely powerful existences among them. We can’t be rash.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The young man was alarmed as he came to a realization. He glanced at Zhou Wen and company who were sizing up the box and whispered, “I see. I was too careless.”

“You are still young. After gaining more experience, you will naturally be able to see a clearer picture of things. Just think before you act in the future.” The elder patted the young man on the shoulder and led him towards Zhou Wen and company.

The box had already been opened. Inside was indeed a woman tied up.

The elder went over and removed the gag from the woman’s mouth. The woman immediately shouted, “Hatu, you ungrateful bastard. Lucas took good care of you back when he was still around, right? Yet, you are treating me like this?”

“Philo, it’s not that we don’t want to take you there. We really can’t deal with that Piranha Flower King. If we go, we’ll just be sending ourselves to our deaths. What’s the point?” the elder said helplessly as he spread out his hands.

“If you’re afraid of death, that’s your business. Why are you stopping me?” Philo struggled to get out of the box.

However, her body was tied up like a worm. She couldn’t even stand up and could only lie in the box and talk.

“We don’t want you to die either,” the elder explained.

“I think it’s because you don’t want your reputation to be damaged, right?” Philo snorted coldly.

“What’s your relationship with Lucas?” Zhou Wen asked Philo. He was somewhat surprised to hear her mention Lucas’s name.

Philo knew that she had a chance to speak because of Zhou Wen. When she saw Zhou Wen ask about Lucas, she hurriedly said, “I’m Lucas’s fiancée. Do you know Lucas?”

Zhou Wen hadn’t heard Lucas mention a fiancée. After some thought, he asked, “Why are you going to the Time Hut?”

“To find Lucas, of course. He went to the Time Hut four years ago and hasn’t returned since. I have to find him.” Philo gritted her teeth and said, “If all of you are afraid of death and aren’t willing to go, let me go. I’ll go myself. I won’t implicate you.”

“Let her go,” Zhou Wen said to the elder.

“This…” The elder was somewhat hesitant. Although part of the reason was to not have his employer die for his team’s reputation, the primary reason was that he didn’t want Philo to die. After all, just as she had said, Lucas had taken good care of him in the past.

“Don’t worry. We’ll take her to the Time Hut,” Zhou Wen said.

“You know Lucas?” the elder looked at Zhou Wen and asked carefully.

“I’m proud to have the Great Lucas as a friend,” Zhou Wen said sincerely. A person like Lucas was indeed worthy of respect.

The elder was still hesitating when Philo shouted in delight, “Quickly release me. I’ll go with them.”

The elder sized up Zhou Wen for a while and sighed. He got someone to remove the chains on Philo.

After Philo jumped out of the box, she said to Zhou Wen, “What’s your name? I’ve basically seen all of Lucas’s friends, but I’ve never seen you before.”

“My name is Zhou Wen. Perhaps he hasn’t mentioned me, but I’m indeed his friend,” Zhou Wen said.

“You are Zhou Wen?” Philo’s eyes widened as she pointed at Zhou Wen and asked in surprise and delight.

“Yes, I’m Zhou Wen. Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled as to why Philo had such a huge reaction.

“Which school did you attend in the past?” Philo asked.

“East District’s Sunset College. I’m not sure if you’ve heard of it.” Zhou Wen roughly guessed that Lucas had mentioned him in front of Philo.

“Ah, there’s no mistake then. You are really Zhou Wen. That’s great.” Philo was overjoyed.

“Philo, is he really Lucas’s friend?” the elder asked in puzzlement.

“It’s not just a friend. He’s the person Lucas admires the most. No, Lucas said that he’s a godlike person,” said Philo solemnly.
