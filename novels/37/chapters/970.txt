Chapter 971: Seven Seas Dragon King Appears

Translator: CKtalon

The original Dragon Palace was now in ruins. There were broken coral reefs everywhere.

According to Miya, the original Dragon Palace was a coral palace, but there was no longer anything left. All that was left was ruins.

Miya didn’t wish to live in this sad place, so she stayed in the sunken ship.

Zhou Wen got the Crab Sovereign to dig up the coral reefs to search for the possible ice block. He never expected to find it, but beneath a coral reef rock, a blue ice block appeared.

After digging it open, he found a blue crystal that looked like an eyeball. Miya said that it might be the Dragon King’s dragon eye.

As Miya didn’t know what these things were for, Zhou Wen had no choice but to put them away. He had a nagging feeling that they would be of some use.

After leaving Sea God Reef, Li Xuan felt that something was amiss the more he thought about it. “Old Zhou, I think something’s amiss.”

“What’s wrong?” Zhou Wen asked.

“If that Terror-grade true dragon was really killed by the Seven Seas Dragon King, why would the Terror objects on its body be hidden in the seven dragon monarchs’ lairs? Even if the Seven Seas Dragon King doesn’t need these materials, there’s no need for him to go through so much trouble to hide them in seven different places, right?” Li Xuan said.

“It’s indeed a little strange. Perhaps the seven dragon monarchs also participated in the battle. These Terror items might be a reward from the Seven Seas Dragon King.” Zhou Wen had also thought of this problem.

“How can these fellows help in a battle at the Terror grade?” Li Xuan pondered for a moment before his eyes suddenly lit up. “Do you think the seven dragon monarchs were subordinates of that ice-elemental dragon to begin with? In the end, they betrayed the ice-elemental dragon and pledged allegiance to the Seven Seas Dragon King. That’s why they obtained these Terror items as rewards?”

“Possibly.” Zhou Wen felt that it was indeed possible.

“I still feel that something is amiss.” Li Xuan continued pondering with a frown.

After returning to Sea Return City, Zhou Wen got Ya’er to temporarily follow Li Xuan. He planned on visiting Infinite Island. If the Seven Seas Dragon King wasn’t there, he could take the opportunity to kill Dragon Granny.

However, before he went, Zhou Wen sent a message to The Thearch to ask if the Terror-grade materials were of any use.

“Where did you get the Terror items?” The Thearch quickly replied. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Zhou Wen roughly explained the matter regarding the Seven Dragons Sea before asking The Thearch: “If we find all the Terror items, will this Terror creature revive?”

“How can it be that easy to revive one. However, those Terror items are considered pretty good materials due to the existence of the power of fear. It’s useless for you to keep them anyway. Why don’t you let me experiment with them?” The Thearch said.

“How is it useless? I still plan on turning these materials into weapons. Weapons made from Terror items should be very powerful, right?” Zhou Wen hurriedly replied.

“Do you think that’s scrap metal? That it can be made into a weapon just by smelting and refining them? Different Terror items have different uses. As you said, those are ice-elemental Terror items. It’s best used to make a refrigerator to store experimental items at low temperatures,” The Thearch said.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if The Thearch was telling the truth or not. In any case, he definitely wasn’t willing to use the Terror items to build a refrigerator.

After chatting with The Thearch for a while, he didn’t obtain any useful information. Just as Zhou Wen was about to head to Infinite Island, he suddenly saw a violent gust of wind on the surface of the sea. The waves transformed into a huge tsunami that surged towards the coast. Large numbers of dimensional creatures rushed onto land with the tsunami.

Another dimensional creature tide? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he felt that something was amiss.

This dimensional creature tide was much more terrifying than the previous crab tide. Many dimensional creatures in the water found it difficult to unleash their combat strength on land.

However, this time, the seawater expanded and rushed towards the land. Many marine creatures that couldn’t enter the land were also swept forward.

Could it be that the Seven Seas Dragon King wants revenge after discovering that the five dragon monarchs are dead? Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed.

Sea Return City was the first to bear the brunt of the attack. The terrifying tsunami even crossed the high wall and poured into Sea Return City. Shark-like dimensional creatures could be seen charging through the city with the waves.

Thankfully, the people who remained in Sea Return City were all wealthy families. There were no longer any commoners. Most of them had a certain level of combat strength, so they didn’t suffer too much damage.

However, as the tsunami continued to inundate the city, more and more marine dimensional creatures swept forward. The situation was extremely bad.

Thankfully, he hadn’t discovered any Mythical creatures. Zhou Wen estimated that he had killed most of the Mythical creatures in the Seven Dragons Sea. There weren’t many Mythical creatures left.

After putting on the Invisibility Cloak, Zhou Wen flew towards the sea, hoping to see what power had triggered the tsunami. Ordinary Mythical creatures definitely couldn’t produce such a tsunami. Zhou Wen guessed that the Seven Seas Dragon King had personally arrived.

Flying far into the air, Zhou Wen didn’t dare approach the sea. If the Seven Seas Dragon King was really here, he would still have room to escape.

The tsunami came wave after wave. Soon, Zhou Wen saw the source of the tsunami. He saw huge strange dragons stirring up trouble in the sea.

The reason they were called strange dragons was that although they looked like dragons, they weren’t completely dragons.

They did have dragon faces, but there were no scales on their bodies. Instead, they had smooth skin that looked extremely tight.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t see any dragon claws on them. Instead of calling them dragons, they looked more like snakes, but they didn’t look like snakes either. There was a strange ring on their abdomen.

From the looks of it, it’s the Seven Seas Dragon King. Zhou Wen counted and indeed, there were seven of them. However, their tails were beneath the sea, so he couldn’t tell what they looked like.

As Zhou Wen was sizing up the Seven Seas Dragon King, the Seven Seas Dragon King seemed to notice Zhou Wen in midair. The strange dragons raised their heads and looked at the invisible Zhou Wen.

I’ve been discovered! Zhou Wen was alarmed as he saw the seven strange dragons spew out white liquid at him.

The liquid was clearly not ordinary water. It was probably the mucus that Miya mentioned. Once touched, he would be stuck and rendered immobile.

Zhou Wen quickly dodged without touching the white liquid. The Seven Seas Dragon King was enraged when he saw this. His body rose out of the water as though he wanted to rush out of the sea to attack Zhou Wen.

As the Seven Seas Dragon King’s body rose up, the seawater surged to the sides. Zhou Wen finally saw the lower half of the Seven Seas Dragon King and his expression turned odd.
