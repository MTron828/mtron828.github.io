Chapter 1858 The Opportunity to Rule the World

Only when he realized that the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed appeared frozen did Grim Demon calm down.

He looked around and was even more alarmed when he saw Skyfiend Consort in the distance. “Nine Tribulations Devil Seed, Skyfiend Consort… Why are they here… What is this place… What happened?”

“Grim Demon, you know these creatures, right?” Zhou Wen said to Grim Demon.

“Yes, of course I know them. These are fellows who were favored by the Devil King. In that era, we didn’t even need to say the Devils, who in the entire dimension didn’t know them?” Grim Demon asked in surprise, “Why are the two of them here?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s not just the two of them. Look over there,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed in a direction.

Grim Demon flew over in puzzlement. As he flew, crystals grew out of his body, giving Grim Demon a fright.

Zhou Wen directly used in the Human World to shatter the crystals on Grim Demon.

“What’s happening?” Grim Demon checked his body and didn’t find any more growing crystals.

“Go take a look first,” Zhou Wen said.

Grim Demon flew over suspiciously. Soon, his cry sounded. From the looks of it, Grim Demon knew all of the Devil King’s pets.

“What’s going on? Why are the Devil King’s most beloved creatures here? Shouldn’t they have died in the Battle of the Fallen Devils?” After Grim Demon returned, his face was filled with perplexity.

“That’s what I want to ask you. As a Devil, you should know better than me,” Zhou Wen said.

“This… I wasn’t with the Devils during that battle. I didn’t see what happened with my own eyes. I thought they had all died in battle. Why are they all in such a place? What kind of place is this?” Grim Demon asked.

Zhou Wen explained where they were. After Grim Demon heard that, he seemed to think of something and exclaimed, “In that case, this should be the bottom of the Dimensional Airspace?”

“Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.

“I remember a legend. The Dimensional Airspace’s Destiny Platform is connected to the upper world. The bottom is connected to the taboo land… It’s also the universe where your Earth is… Could it be that these fellows saw that the situation was hopeless in that battle and wanted to escape to Earth to avoid the pursuit of the other races, but they were trapped by that strange crystal after arriving here?” Grim Demon said.

“Probably not. Would you take a path you don’t even know about? Furthermore, with these fellows’ abilities, even if Earth hadn’t broken out back then, they would have had the ability to open up a spatial passageway to Earth, right?” Zhou Wen rejected Grim Demon’s suggestion.

Grim Demon’s words made Zhou Wen recall something.

Back when Wang Mingyuan tore through the passageway to the dimensional zone, Demonic Neonate had come to Earth through that passageway.

Is it possible that when Wang Mingyuan tore through the tunnel, this place was also connected to Earth? Did Demonic Neonate leave from here? Zhou Wen thought about it and felt that it wasn’t impossible.

Unfortunately, Demonic Neonate had been transformed by the Dead Man Tree after Zhou Wen killed her. She didn’t have any memories of the past, or she would have known something

However, Zhou Wen still hoped that she didn’t remember any of that. If she really had her memories, she would definitely remember that Zhou Wen had once killed her.

“Now that you mention it, I remember something.” Karoman pondered and said, “I heard that after that battle, no one knew where the Devil King’s corpse was. No one saw the corpses of the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed or Skyfiend Consort. Everyone thought that they had been killed by the Immortal Thearch, but from the looks of it, that’s not the case.”

“However, the Immortal Thearch had said that the Devils had been destroyed. If she wasn’t 100% confident, it would be impossible for her to announce it to the world. From the looks of it, only the Immortal Thearch knows what went on.” Karoman looked at Grim Demon and said, “You should be the Guardian prototype created by the Devil King, right?”

“I never expected anyone in this world to know me.” Grim Demon couldn’t help but reveal a smug expression.

“How can I not know? The Guardian techniques of the various races were learned from the Devils. You can be considered the progenitor of Guardians,” said Karoman with a smile. “However, from the looks of it, you don’t seem to be doing well. You don’t even have a proper contractor and have fallen to the status of contracting a weapon.”

Grim Demon was very smug in the beginning, but the more he listened, the darker his expression became. After a while, he said gloomily, “It’s none of your business.”

Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon in surprise. He never expected this fellow to have such a lofty background.

Karoman sized up Demonic Neonate and continued, “Your Companion Beast is a pure Devil. This is very rare. Pure Devils were very rare back then, much less now. Thankfully, times are different. If Wang Mingyuan hadn’t appeared and the Immortals were still in charge, you would probably have been attacked by all the races when you brought such a Devil to the dimension. No one would be willing to see the Devils rise again.”

“Hmph, they aren’t worthy without Immortal Thearch.” Grim Demon snorted coldly.

“The Immortal Thearch is gone, and the Devil King is gone. What’s there to be worthy of?”

“The King is gone? Master…” Grim Demon wanted to say something, but he stopped before he could finish.

Zhou Wen was also somewhat curious about Demonic Neonate’s relationship with the Devil King. He guessed that they were related by blood.

From Grim Demon’s appearance, he probably knew. However, with Karoman beside him, Zhou Wen couldn’t ask. He planned on interrogating him when there was no one around.

“By the way, if you want to know what happened back then, why don’t you get these fellows out and ask them? Are these fellows still alive?” Grim Demon suddenly slapped his thigh and looked at the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed.

“We don’t know if it’s alive. I’m just afraid that if it’s alive, it will bring us harm after we get it out,” Zhou Wen said.

The Nine Tribulations Devil Seed was so terrifying that his strength couldn’t even injure it. If it really wanted to kill someone, it would be troublesome.

“Don’t worry. There’s no way it would dare do so.” As Grim Demon spoke, he subconsciously glanced at Demonic Neonate.

Zhou Wen naturally knew what Grim Demon meant, but he found it odd.

Even if Demonic Neonate was a descendant of the Devil King, the races in the dimension only respected the strong. They were loyal to the powerful Devil King, but they might not bow down to Demonic Neonate who hadn’t grown to her full potential. This was also one of the reasons Zhou Wen hadn’t considered releasing them. However, from Grim Demon’s indication, he seemed to be very certain that the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed would bow down to Demonic Neonate.

“Are you sure?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.

“Of course I’m sure. Don’t worry.” With that said, Grim Demon used a special ability to send his thoughts into Zhou Wen’s mind. “They will definitely be loyal to Master. If they are still alive, Master can reign supreme over the dimensional zone with their help. The opportunity to rule the world is right in front of her.”
