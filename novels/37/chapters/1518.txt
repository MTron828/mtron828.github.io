Chapter 1519 Sword Dao Competition

Berserker Immortal was as cold as before. He wasn’t angered by Zhou Wen’s words. Zhou Wen’s actions were in line with his thoughts.

His Calamity Zone had an extremely powerful offensive power, but it didn’t stop Zhou Wen from using spatial teleportation. What he was most afraid of was Zhou Wen escaping.

Now that Zhou Wen planned on fighting to the death and not escaping, it was naturally in line with Berserker Immortal’s intentions.

“If you want to kill me, come on. Give it your best shot.” Berserker Immortal extended his hand and the blood sword beams that filled the sky gathered towards his palm.

Thousands of blood sword beams gathered together, forming a Sword of Blood that Berserker Immortal held in his hand.

Although killing Zhou Wen was easier using the blood sea-like sword beams, Berserker Immortal’s goal wasn’t to kill Zhou Wen, but to make him submit.

The ancient corpse’s body couldn’t withstand Berserker Immortal’s descent for long. Now that it had suffered such serious injuries, Berserker Immortal didn’t have much time left. He had to choose the new representative of the Immortals in the human world before returning

It was probably too late to find others. Furthermore, Berserker Immortal didn’t believe that anyone was more suitable than Zhou Wen to be the new representative.

Zhou Wen held the Golden Wyrm Scissors and got the Golden Wyrm Scissors to fuse together as a broadsword without any sharpened edges.

Zhou Wen followed the sword as it became one with the Golden Wyrm Scissors and transformed into a stream of light that stabbed at Berserker Immortal.

It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t wish to lead while the sword followed; the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ strength was far stronger than his. If he made the Golden Wyrm Scissors follow according to his strength, it would only weaken the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ might.

Therefore, Zhou Wen chose to use his strength to support the Golden Wyrm Scissors. He was the support, and the sword was the main offensive force.

If an ordinary person were to use such a sword art, they would inevitably fall into a disadvantageous position. This was because the person practicing the sword was human. Humans were the main offensive force, and the sword was auxiliary. If the sword was the main force while the human was controlled by the sword, it was equivalent to an unorthodox path-it was very easy for something negative to happen.

Berserker Immortal moved slightly and dodged the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attack. He slashed at Zhou Wen’s head with the Sword of Blood and said, “Your abilities aren’t bad, but your temperament is lacking. The Sword Dao is the heart. Your heart is controlled by the sword. How can a heartless person become a true expert?”

Berserker Immortal clearly believed that Zhou Wen’s method of using the sword was too clumsy and wasn’t a top-notch Sword Dao.

Zhou Wen ignored Berserker Immortal as he struck out again and again.

Even though Berserker Immortal had condensed the Sword of Blood, he didn’t dare clash head-on with the Golden Wyrm Scissors. All he did was constantly dodge, hoping to defeat Zhou Wen with his sword techniques.

However, over time, Berserker Immortal was surprised to discover that he couldn’t suppress Zhou Wen.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors was very powerful, but Zhou Wen’s strength hadn’t reached that level. However, under Zhou Wen’s usage, the might emitted by the Golden Wyrm Scissors was much stronger than when the Golden Wyrm Scissors fought alone.

Berserker Immortal was surprised to discover that although Zhou Wen seemed to be using himself as a support, he could use very tiny amounts of strength to influence the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

It looked like the Golden Wyrm Scissors was in charge, but in fact, Zhou Wen was the one controlling everything.

A human can actually cultivate his Sword Dao to such a level? Berserker Immortal was known as a sword immortal; therefore, his attainments in the Sword Dao were naturally extremely high. He had realized what was happening.

However, Zhou Wen’s sword art today surprised him. He couldn’t gain the upper hand in a clash of sword techniques.

“What sword art is this?” Berserker Immortal asked as he fought Zhou Wen.

“A sword art doesn’t necessarily need a name.” Zhou Wen’s Heart Defying Sword Art was born from the three thousand sword intents. He could use the style of any sword technique freely.

However, the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ situation was somewhat special. It wasn’t a real sword, so Zhou Wen had to use a special method to control it. It was very different from the sword techniques Zhou Wen usually used.

Berserker Immortal originally wanted to quickly defeat Zhou Wen, but after seeing Zhou Wen’s sword art, he had the urge to watch further. He didn’t immediately fight Zhou Wen with all his might.

Berserker Immortal was famous for being a sword immortal. He was a fanatic of the way of the sword. When he saw an excellent sword art he didn’t know, he couldn’t help but take a second gander.

Zhou Wen had already pushed the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ strength to its limits. His body cooperated with the Golden Wyrm Scissors as he constantly instant transmitted and attacked, but all his attacks were dodged by Berserker Immortal.

The Sword of Blood in Berserker Immortal’s hand similarly failed to injure Zhou Wen.

Moments later, Berserker Immortal suddenly said, “Your sword technique isn’t bad, but unfortunately, you haven’t truly mastered it. Today, I’ll let you see what a true sword technique is.”

With that said, Berserker Immortal’s hand moved as he stabbed at Zhou Wen’s heart. He was so fast that Zhou Wen couldn’t see him clearly.

Before Berserker Immortal’s Sword of Blood reached his chest, Zhou Wen felt as though his heart had already been pierced.

Zhou Wen brandished the Golden Wyrm Scissors to block, but just as the Golden Wyrm Scissors moved, the Sword of Blood changed its position and stabbed at Zhou Wen’s glabella.

Berserker Immortal fought Zhou Wen purely with his sword techniques. After more than ten strikes, Zhou Wen was forced to retreat without any room to counterattack.

Berserker Immortal’s sword art could no longer be described as domineering. When it came to being domineering, there would be traces of it-domineering when needed and restrained when unneeded.

However, Berserker Immortal’s sword art was now completely different. He was domineering when it should be domineering, and still domineering when it shouldn’t be. He was practically suicidal.

Berserker Immortal’s every strike was aimed at the enemy’s vital spots, forcing his opponent to defend or retreat with no chance of counterattacking.

Zhou Wen actually knew such a sword art that attacked the enemy’s vital spots, but he quickly realized that the two were completely different. When he used such a method to deal with Berserker Immortal, he nearly lost his cadence several times.

Berserker Immortal didn’t dodge when facing his opponent, but he wasn’t without flaws. It could even be said that he had many flaws. Furthermore, he didn’t take these flaws seriously at all. All he cared about was killing his enemy. He didn’t care about the flaws in his sword art as he constantly attacked.

It didn’t deserve being called a sword art. It was better to call it a gamble of life.

Now, Zhou Wen finally understood what it meant to be fearless. Berserker Immortal’s sword art was the fearless kind.

Zhou Wen was forced to retreat under Berserker Immortal’s attacks despite wielding a divine weapon like the Golden Wyrm Scissors. He couldn’t gain an advantage in a pure clash of swords.

It had been a long time since Zhou Wen had been at a disadvantage in battle. His Heart Defying Sword Art was seldom suppressed by others, so he never expected there to be another sword art that wasn’t included in the three thousand sword intents.
