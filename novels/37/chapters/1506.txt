Chapter 1507 Descent Through the Corpse

Boom!

Dark clouds gathered in the sky as bolts of lightning crisscrossed. A bolt struck the ground, creating a huge crater in the wilderness which revealed coffins.

Crack!

Another bolt of lightning struck one of the coffins.

The coffin was made of some unknown wood. When the lightning struck it, sparks flew and enveloped the entire coffin, but it didn’t damage it at all.

Lightning bolts descended one after another, but as though they were individually sentient, they landed on five different coffins.

Lightning flashed over the five coffins. After a while, the lightning surrounding the coffins vanished. The dark clouds and storm in the sky also dissipated.

With a few soft sounds, the lids of the five coffins were slowly pushed open. The corpses sat up in the coffins.

Although they were corpses, their bodies were no different from living people. There were no signs of decay. Apart from the lack of a heartbeat, it was impossible to tell that they were dead.

The five corpses crawled out of the coffins. Four of them bowed at another corpse and said, “Your Excellency Berserker Immortal, those fellows from the League of Guardians must have never expected that we had long left a backup plan on Earth. They thought that we had to rely on them and Skysplit Tower. Do you want to visit the League of Guardians to teach them a lesson?”

Berserker Immortal glanced at his body and said coldly, “The power these five ancient corpses can withstand is limited. The power of a Calamity-grade will cause irreversible damage to them. Once we lose the protection of these ancient corpses, the rules of Earth will deal too much damage to us. Therefore, our goal is to find a new representative. There will be plenty of opportunities in the future to teach them a lesson. Furthermore, we still need them to rebuild Skysplit Tower. It’s not appropriate to let them know that we have other methods to descend to Earth for the time being.”

“Your Excellency, according to the information we previously received, there are many warlords on Earth, but many are wanting. In the East District, the An family in Luoyang is the strongest. Their strength is enough to fight the big families like the six families. It even vaguely feels like it can surpass them. If it can be used by us, it will naturally be the best choice. However…” One of the ancient corpses didn’t finish his sentence. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“If you have something to say, just say it. It’s not the style of the four immortals of the arts.” Berserker Immortal said indifferently.

Due to the League of Guardians’ slow progress in repairing Skysplit Tower, Berserker Immortal didn’t want to be limited by others. In order to escape Wang Mingyuan’s restrictions, he didn’t hesitate to use the Immortals’ trump card in the Mythical era. He wanted to find a new representative as soon as possible to replace the League of Guardians.

As he had used an ancient corpse to descend, his strength was limited by the ancient corpse’s physique, preventing him from unleashing Berserker Immortal’s true strength. To be safe, Berserker Immortal had even invited the four immortals of the four arts to descend with him.

The four immortals—Zither, Chess, Calligraphy, and Painting-were all at the Calamity grade. Although they hadn’t reached the Heaven level like Berserker Immortal, they were still existences at the Hell level. Even if they were affected by the ancient corpses and couldn’t unleash their full strength, they were not to be underestimated.

Calligraphy Immortal who had just spoken continued, “However, Wang Mingyuan comes from Luoyang. It’s difficult to guarantee that he has nothing to do with the An family. Furthermore, Zhou Wen, who is hand in glove with the An family, is one of Wang Mingyuan’s disciples. It doesn’t seem appropriate to choose the An family.”

Painting Immortal continued, “Although the An family didn’t resist contracting Guardians, they are more inclined towards developing technology. They aren’t very enthusiastic about contracting Guardians. The chips in our hands aren’t that attractive to the An family.”

Berserker Immortal quietly listened to them before saying, “The An family has already reached such a state. It won’t be easy to rope them. Furthermore, there’s the risk of exposing our trump cards to Wang Mingyuan.”

The four immortals believed that Berserker Immortal had no intention of targeting the An family, but to their surprise, Berserker Immortal changed the topic and continued, “Now that Zhou Wen has already left the An family and wants to establish a city in Guide City, this is an opportunity. To establish a city in a place like Guide City, even the An family might not be able to succeed. Furthermore, Zhou Wen is alone. Now is the most difficult time for him. It’s also our best chance.”

“But Zhou Wen is Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. Isn’t that inappropriate?” The four immortals looked at each other, clearly doubting Berserker Immortal’s decision.

Berserker Immortal said indifferently, “The best way to defeat an enemy is to destroy his confidence. The reason Wang Mingyuan shows such arrogance in the dimension is that his disciples control almost all the strongest factions on Earth. We have no other choice. If we can destroy the assets he’s so proud of, Wang Mingyuan will definitely be in a mess. It will be up to us whether we kill him or not.”

Thinking back to Wang Mingyuan’s slap, an indiscernible killing intent flashed in Berserker Immortal’s eyes.

“Zhou Wen is Wang Mingyuan’s disciple after all. How can we ensure that he will be used by us and not go against us like Jiang Yan?” Calligraphy Immortal said after some thought.

“It’s precisely because even Wang Mingyuan can’t think of it that it’s more valuable. In comparison, Zhou Wen, who has left the An family, is the easiest to deal with among Wang Mingyuan’s disciples. As long as I can crush his will, I’ll take him for myself using the Art of Immortal Opportunity. I definitely won’t allow any accidents to happen,” said Berserker Immortal.

When the four immortals heard that, they revealed looks of enlightenment. Painting Immortal said with a smile, “I never expected you to be able to use the Art of Immortal Opportunity. We are relieved.”

Calligraphy Immortal pondered for a moment and said, “I heard that the Art of Immortal Opportunity is somewhat similar to a contractual art. It can only be used if the other party is willing to accept it. Your Excellency, how do you plan on subduing Zhou Wen?”

“The easiest moment to breach a person’s defenses is when they are in danger. It’s very easy for something to happen in a place like Guide City, isn’t it? When he is facing an insurmountable problem, we will descend from above to save him from danger. It will naturally be effective,” Berserker Immortal said as he headed for Guide City.

The four immortals understood what Berserker Immortal meant and hurriedly followed.

At that moment in Guide City, Zhou Wen looked at Hui Wan with a headache.

The Essence Energy Art Hui Wan cultivated was Zhou Wen’s Qi Refinement Art. The greatest characteristic of this Essence Energy Art was the need for extravagance. As long as one had enough Essence Energy Crystals, there was basically no threshold that prevented one from advancing all the way to the Epic stage.

Hui Wan’s family was so poor that all they had left was money. He could use all sorts of high-level Essence Energy Crystals. At a young age, Hui Wan had already advanced to the Epic stage. He was just short of advancing to the Mythical stage.

Hui Haifeng didn’t rashly get Hui Wan to use a Mythical Serum. He had sent Hui Wan over firstly to ensure his safety, and secondly, to get Zhou Wen to help him choose a path.

Hui Wan was Hui Haifeng’s only son. Apart from Zhou Wen, Hui Haifeng was worried about leaving Hui Wan’s future to others.
