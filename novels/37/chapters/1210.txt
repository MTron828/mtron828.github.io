Chapter 1211: Done

Translator: CKtalon

Beneath the magma, one could see a metal palace. It was completely bronze and mixed with the magma, making it difficult to see it at its core.

Zhou Wen carefully observed it for a while before roughly figuring out that the metal palace looked like a hemisphere. However, this was only the upper half. He couldn’t see the lower half, nor did he know how big it was.

The front of the hemispherical building appeared more than a thousand meters in diameter. There were latitude-like grooves along its parallels. At the topmost parallel, a platform could be seen. It was also circular and about twenty to thirty meters in diameter. It looked like an entrance, but it was sealed. There were no gaps, buttons, or handles.

Zhou Wen looked at it for a while, unsure what the building was.

When his gaze accidentally swept across a corner of the hemisphere, Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up. In the grid divided by the longitude and latitude meridians and parallels, there was a tiny palm symbol engraved at the bottom periphery. In the palm was a golden circle symbol. It looked like Venus.

There’s actually a tiny palm symbol! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.

He held his phone up at the Cube’s screen to see if he could snap it, but he realized that it was useless. Even if he really stood on Venus, it was too far away. He had to dive into the magma and take a close-up shot.

Zhou Wen hadn’t originally planned on taking the risk on Venus, but when he saw the tiny palm symbol, he knew that the metal building was definitely not a combat arena, but a dimensional zone.

Furthermore, the creatures that had appeared previously had safely come out after entering. Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t too dangerous, so he planned on making a trip and snapping the tiny palm symbol.

However, before that, Zhou Wen needed to be fully prepared.

After the antelope returned, it slept on the sofa all day. Zhou Wen used to think that it was lazy, but now, he knew that it was heavily injured and was recuperating.

Without a Calamity-grade protecting him, Zhou Wen didn’t dare take Ya’er on adventures. He made her stay with the An family so that they could take care of her.

Although Zhou Wen’s relationship with An Tianzuo was terrible, he had to admit that An Tianzuo’s care for Ya’er was even more meticulous than his own.

He took Jade Rabbit and Ice Maiden with him, but Zhou Wen felt that Ice Maiden wasn’t of much use. That place was too hot, so Ice Maiden’s strength would be greatly weakened. Her combat strength would definitely plummet.

Deva Asura, Banana Fairy, and Demonic Neonate should be of considerable use. There was also the Seven Seas Dragon King. It was unknown if the fellow’s mucus was susceptible to high temperatures.

He put on the Invisibility Cloak, put on the earrings, and had Doctor Darkness possess him.

Although Doctor Darkness was only at the Mythical stage, his Light of Penetration and Darkness Right Hand were still very useful.

After making sufficient preparations, Zhou Wen used Singularity Universe’s ability and chose Venus as his teleportation target. He instantly arrived above Venus.

Singularity Universe allowed for distant teleportation, but it wasn’t precise enough. When Zhou Wen appeared on Venus, he didn’t land near the magma.

He was in a huge mountain range. The mountain was even taller than the Himalayas.

After gathering his bearings, Zhou Wen was about to head for the magma when he suddenly realized that there was a faint sound coming from the rift valley at the foot of the mountain.

What’s there? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly activated the Invisibility Cloak’s complete invisibility ability before carefully listening to the commotion in the rift valley.

After using Truth Listener to listen for a while, he realized that there weren’t any creatures in the rift valley. What made the sound was a fake flower.

The reason it was called a fake flower was that it had three red leaves. Above those were white petals. Its entire body was metal, looking nothing like a living plant at all. It looked like a work of art.

However, after listening carefully for a while, Zhou Wen realized that the metal flower wasn’t an artwork, but a living plant. Its roots were embedded in the rocks, and it seemed to survive rather well in the high temperatures and air that was filled with carbon dioxide. As the heat flowed, the leaves rustled slightly and emitted a strange sound.

The sound Zhou Wen had heard was from the leaf.

A metal flower? Zhou Wen was especially sensitive to flowers and didn’t dare head straight into the rift.

With a flash, he summoned a Golden Battle God Halberd and sent it flying into the rift valley.

It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t wish to use ordinary Companion Beasts to probe. The temperature of Venus was just too high. Typical Companion Beasts would probably be killed by the high temperature before reaching the rift valley.

The Golden Battle God Halberd flew down the mountain and into the rift valley. Not long after it entered, the Golden Battle God Halberd suddenly disintegrated before it could approach the metal flower.

It was somewhat similar to the shattering of tempered glass. The Golden Battle God Halberd immediately disintegrated into countless fragments. The fragments were much smaller than tempered glass shards—only the size of sesame seeds.

Before the fragments fell to the bottom of the valley, they vanished. The Golden Battle God Halberd’s name also vanished from Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast list.

Zhou Wen felt his heart ache, but at the same time, he was somewhat puzzled. He only knew that the metal flower’s power had disintegrated the Golden Battle God Halberd. As for what kind of power it was, he couldn’t tell.

After some thought, Zhou Wen dispelled his plans to continue exploring. After determining where he was, he teleported towards the magma abyss.

Clown Mask’s teleportation ability was already very powerful. His teleportation distance was much further than before, so it didn’t take him long to arrive in the vicinity of the magma abyss.

Zhou Wen didn’t walk over directly because it was within the confines of the Cube’s field-of-view. Even if he went in his Terror form, ordinary people might not be able to see him, but he could still be seen by Terror-grade experts.

Therefore, after Zhou Wen determined the distance, he teleported into the magma to prevent himself from being discovered.

The moment he entered the magma, he experienced the terrifying temperature. Thankfully, he had already fused with the Terror-form Human Sovereign. Although Human Sovereign could only heal others and not himself, just the increase in strength produced by the fusion was enough to withstand the high temperature.

Not daring to stay for too long, Zhou Wen continued teleporting inside the magma and quickly arrived in front of the metal building. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Just as he had seen on the screen, there was a huge metal hemisphere at the front. However, in front of it, it looked even more spectacular, making him feel tiny.

What was even more terrifying was that the temperature emitted by the metal building was even more terrifying than the temperature of magma.

Even with Zhou Wen’s Terror-grade power protecting him, he still felt a burning sensation.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on searching the metal building. He found the tiny palm symbol and forcefully dispersed the surrounding magma. He took out his phone and snapped a picture of it.

Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief when the long-awaited download screen appeared.. He put away his phone and let it download slowly.
