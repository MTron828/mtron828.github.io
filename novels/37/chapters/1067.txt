Chapter 1068: Exchange for the Elixir of Immortality

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen didn’t know if the jade box had anything to do with the Jade Rabbit on the moon. After all, legends were only legends. Many legends were just far-fetched.

When he took out the jade box, he only felt that the material of the jade box was somewhat similar to the jade pestle.

He compared the jade box with the jade pestle and realized that the materials were very similar.

He casually opened the jade box and suddenly heard a whoosh. The jade pestle, that even the Seven Seas Dragon King couldn’t move, actually moved by itself and flew into the jade box.

The jade pestle shrank as it flew over before quickly landing in the jade box. The box fit it perfectly. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Wen looked at the jade pestle lying silently in the jade box and was alarmed. The Seven Seas Dragon King couldn’t even lift the jade pestle, but it didn’t seem to add much weight to the jade box.

Jade Rabbit immediately became anxious when it saw the jade pestle taken away. It stood on the edge of the mountain and shouted and jumped at Zhou Wen as though it was threatening him to return the jade pestle or it would eat him.

Zhou Wen closed the jade box and stored it in the Chaos Bead before saying to Jade Rabbit, “Exchange for it with the Elixir of Immortality.”

Jade Rabbit was even more furious when it heard that. Its body expanded once again and soon, it became an extremely huge rabbit. Its body was much taller than the ring-shaped mountain.

The ring-shaped mountain was like a toy model in front of Jade Rabbit, while Zhou Wen and company were ants inside the toy.

Jade Rabbit revealed its ferociousness, but because it had suffered under the Seven Seas Dragon King, it didn’t dare rush down. All it did was flare up outside.

“Since you don’t wish to exchange for it, I’m leaving.” Zhou Wen carried Demonic Neonate and ordered the Seven Seas Dragon King to head out of the ring-shaped mountain.

The Seven Seas Dragon King’s tentacles danced as it quickly rushed out of the ring-shaped mountain. Jade Rabbit was screaming fiercely, but it didn’t dare rush forward or stop Zhou Wen. It was in a panic.

Wah!

When Jade Rabbit saw that Zhou Wen was really leaving the ring-shaped mountain, it cried out again. Its body rapidly shrank back to its original size as it rolled on the ground and cried.

“Give me some of the Elixir of Immortality and I’ll return the jade pestle to you,” Zhou Wen said to the crying Jade Rabbit on the ground.

Jade Rabbit crawled up from the ground, its eyes still brimming with tears. Then, it gestured with its front paws as though it was outlining a square.

Zhou Wen took out the jade box and asked Jade Rabbit, “You want this box?”

When Jade Rabbit saw the jade box, it nodded immediately and stopped crying.

“Alright, I can give you the jade box and jade pestle, but you have to give me the Elixir of Immortality.” Zhou Wen had no use for the jade box, so he might as well exchange it with Jade Rabbit.

Jade Rabbit seemed hesitant as it looked at Zhou Wen and the jade box in his hand. Finally, it nodded firmly.

“Where did you put the Elixir of Immortality?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw Jade Rabbit nod.

Jade Rabbit waved its paw at Zhou Wen before running in a particular direction.

Zhou Wen ordered the Seven Seas Dragon King to follow Jade Rabbit and left the white ring-shaped mountain. He traversed numerous ring-shaped mountains and soon arrived in front of a stone hut.

The stone hut was simple and crude, as though it was built by a barbarian. It didn’t look anything special. Furthermore, the stone door was covered in dust, making it look uninhabited.

Jade Rabbit bowed in front of the stone hut before pushing open the door. It stood inside the stone hut and waved its paw at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen walked to the door and saw that the decorations in the stone hut were very simple. They were all primitive stone tools with stone carvings.

Jade Rabbit went to one of the stone pots and opened the lid. Then, it carefully picked up the stone pot and tipped it twice.

A crystalline pill rolled out of the stone pot. It was the size of a baby’s fist and emitted a strong osmanthus fragrance. The fragrance could penetrate the protection of the space suit, allowing Zhou Wen to smell the fragrance.

Jade Rabbit grabbed the pill with one paw and pointed at the jade box in Zhou Wen’s hand with the other paw, clearly indicating that it wanted to exchange it with him.

Zhou Wen didn’t hand over the jade box. He looked at the stone pot and said, “You still have Elixirs of Immortality in that stone pot, right? Didn’t you say that you wanted to exchange all the Elixirs of Immortality with me?”

Jade Rabbit immediately picked up the stone pot and looked at Zhou Wen warily. Then, it pointed at the pill in its paw and the jade box, indicating that it was a one-for-one exchange.

“No can do. You have to exchange all the Elixirs of Immortality with me.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

Jade Rabbit’s face showed a struggle. Finally, as though it had made up its mind, it extended its paws and gestured a two in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was delighted. From the looks of it, there are more than two Elixirs of Immortality in the stone pot.

Zhou Wen pointed at the stone pot and said, “I want all the Elixirs of Immortality.”

Jade Rabbit hugged the stone pot and shook its head like a rattle drum. Its body kept retreating as it looked at Zhou Wen as though it was looking at a thief.

“Don’t you want the jade box and jade pestle?” Zhou Wen waved the jade box in front of Jade Rabbit and tempted it.

Jade Rabbit’s eyes followed the jade box as it spun. It wished it could grab the jade box, but it couldn’t bear to part with the Elixirs of Immortality.

Seeing Jade Rabbit struggling as though it couldn’t make up her mind, Zhou Wen asked, “How many Elixirs of Immortality are in the stone pot?”

Jade Rabbit used its paw to gesture three. Only then did Zhou Wen realize that there were only three Elixirs of Immortality.

Zhou Wen noticed that Jade Rabbit’s intelligence wasn’t high. At most, it was at the level of a child. His heart stirred as he said to the Jade Rabbit with a smile, “How about this? I’ll exchange the jade box for all your Elixirs of Immortality.”

When Jade Rabbit heard that, it immediately shook its head and hugged the stone pot even tighter.

“Hear me out. Just treat it as leaving the Elixirs of Immortality with me. In the future, follow me and help me do some trivial things if possible. I’ll take care of your food and drink. If you perform well, I’ll return one Elixir of Immortality to you. If you perform well and make me happy, I’ll return two Elixirs of Immortality. Perhaps you can even get back all three Elixirs of Immortality. What do you think?” Zhou Wen said to Jade Rabbit.

When Jade Rabbit heard that, it extended its paw and counted as though it was calculating something.

After some calculation, Jade Rabbit felt that it was worth it. Therefore, it nodded happily and handed the stone pot to Zhou Wen.

“That’s right. I’ll help you put the Elixirs of Immortality away for now. From now on, follow me and you’ll live in the lap of luxury. I guarantee you won’t regret it.” Zhou Wen reached out to take the stone pot.

However, Jade Rabbit pulled it back and pointed at the jade box in Zhou Wen’s hand. It meant that they had to exchange the items at the same time.

Zhou Wen handed the jade box over in exchange for the stone pot. He looked inside and indeed, there were three pills inside. Each of them were jade-white and emitted a strong osmanthus fragrance. Just taking in the fragrance made him feel refreshed as though he was about to fly and ascend.

When Jade Rabbit obtained the jade box, it was also very happy. It hugged the jade box and rubbed its face against it as though it had obtained a treasure.
