Chapter 1867 Battle of the Heavenly Stairs (2) Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Zhou Wen rose into the air, spread his six pairs of wings, and raised the Human Sovereign’s ancient saber in his hand. The power of the world gathered on him.

The woman struggled to fly into the sky. Her legs seemed to be nailed to the stone steps, making it difficult for her to step off.

“First Slash... Life...” The woman held the blade of light and wanted to use Immortal Slaughtering Ancient Subordinate’s Immortal Slaying again.

However, those forces couldn’t be used on the staircase. There was no reaction from the blade beams.

The only strength she could muster was the energy of her combat suit. She couldn’t use any strength related to this world.

The woman stood on the stone steps and could only watch helplessly as infinite strength gathered on Zhou Wen.

She gritted her teeth and continued walking upward. Although she wasn’t good at combat and didn’t have a very high realm, she wasn’t stupid.

On the contrary, the woman was very smart. She had already guessed that she could only regain her freedom after finishing the stairs.

Scaling the last few steps became harder and harder. Even with the support of the combat suit, it was still difficult for her. However, she still managed to walk, and her speed wasn’t very slow.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to gather more strength, but seeing that she was in no way slow, he didn’t have the time to continue channeling greater strength.

Zhou Wen swung the Human Sovereign Stone Saber in his hand at the woman, and the terrifying nomological force turned into a strange saber beam that went for her head.

Clang!

The woman swung her blade at the saber beam formed by Sin of All Life. The collision resulted in the snapping of the saber beam.

This outcome was already within Zhou Wen’s expectations. His body was like a flying immortal as he blinked about in the sky and slashed at the woman from all directions.

The woman brandished her blade of light to parry the incoming saber beams, but she failed to block them all. Some of the saber beams were snapped by her, while others struck her.

The saber beam that could slice through a planet only caused light patterns to ripple on the woman’s uniform upon contact; they failed to slice through it.

What’s up with that uniform? Zhou Wen frowned.

When the woman saw that Zhou Wen’s saber beam couldn’t tear through her combat suit, she stopped fighting him. As she brandished her blade, she tried her best to sever Zhou Wen’s saber beam as she walked toward the Destiny Platform at the end of the stairs.

Even so, Zhou Wen’s saber beams only made the woman grunt in pain without producing much of an effect.

Zhou Wen knew that it was useless to continue slashing with only about ten stone steps left ahead of the woman, so he summoned Demonic Neonate again.

After Demonic Neonate came out, she took the opportunity while Zhou Wen was attacking the woman to immediately throw the Vajra Chakram at the woman’s head.

Bang!

The Vajra Chakram smashed into the unprepared woman’s head, causing her hat to collapse as though it had hit her head.

The woman’s body swayed as though she was drunk and nearly fell onto the stone steps.

Her expression didn’t look too good, but she still stood firm and accelerated towards the Destiny Platform.

Bang! Bang!

Demonic Neonate constantly threw out the Vajra Chakram, causing the woman to stagger. Cracks appeared on her combat suit.

The woman gritted her teeth and endured the pain as she continued walking up with all her might.

Demonic Neonate retracted the Vajra Chakram when she saw this. She grabbed the sides of the Vajra Chakram with both hands and aimed it at the woman like she was aiming a mirror at her.

The Vajra Chakram could envelop all things, but when the woman was within its sights, it failed to suck her in.

Zhou Wen was even more certain of his guess when he saw this. The woman didn’t belong to this world to begin with, so the Vajra Chakram’s ability was useless against her. It wasn’t as effective as physical attacks.

There were only four stone steps left in front of the woman. If she rushed up, who knew what would happen?

Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and flashed behind the woman. Human Sovereign Stone Saber slashed at her body again. This time, Zhou Wen didn’t use the Sin of All Life, but in the Human World.

The spot he attacked was also where the combat suit had been torn apart by the Vajra Chakram.

The Human Sovereign Stone Saber slashed at the tear in the combat suit and actually made progress. The blade sliced through her flesh as blood gushed out.

The woman’s flesh was extremely tough. Zhou Wen’s full-powered strike only sliced through her flesh without reaching her bones.

He slashed at the woman again and again while Demonic Neonate constantly threw out the Vajra Chakram, smashing it on the woman’s head, causing her to stagger.

The woman was attacked from both sides. She staggered and was close to collapsing. Coupled with the suppression from the stone steps, she couldn’t take another step up.

The people watching the battle were somewhat stunned. They didn’t understand why Human Sovereign would kill a human woman.

The human woman’s combat strength was shockingly powerful. She managed to hold on and not succumb despite Human Sovereign’s barrage of attacks.

However, they didn’t know if they should cheer Human Sovereign on. For a moment, there was silence as the atmosphere became extremely heavy.

After all, they were both humans. No one knew who was in the right. Furthermore, it looked like the woman was being trounced by Zhou Wen.

Women, children, and the elderly were more easily considered weak, and humans had an innate pity for the weak. Although they felt that it was impossible for Human Sovereign to kill a woman for no reason, no one felt that Human Sovereign’s murder was a good idea.

“Professor Gu, any thoughts?” Su Yi didn’t understand the current situation and consulted Professor Gu.

Professor Gu pondered and said, “It’s unlikely Human Sovereign would kill someone for no reason, much less under such circumstances. Furthermore, in the beginning, it was that woman who was chasing after Human Sovereign. I think there must be a reason for this. Human Sovereign definitely has his reasons.”

The people watching the program sighed when they heard Professor Gu’s words.

“It’s over, it’s over. Now that Professor Gu has opened his mouth, Human Sovereign’s reputation is probably ruined.”

“Holy sh*t, with Professor Gu being such a jinx, don’t tell me Human Sovereign is about to become some devil?”

“Amitabha, please don’t let it happen!”

The woman brandished the blade beam and desperately blocked Zhou Wen’s Human Sovereign Stone Saber and Vajra Chakram. She endured her injuries and took another step up the stone steps.

Zhou Wen saw that there were only three stone steps left ahead of her. The woman was still seeking an opportunity to head up, so he was also burning with anxiety.

In the Human World, along with the Human Sovereign Stone Saber, could only slice through the woman’s flesh. Her body was definitely not inferior to an Apocalypse creature’s.

Seeing that the woman had taken another step and was only two steps away from Destiny Platform, Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t stop her if this continued.

Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and landed on the last stone step. Demonic Neonate sat on his shoulder as the two faced the woman below.
