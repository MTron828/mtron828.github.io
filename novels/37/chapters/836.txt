Chapter 837: Ba

The human face had all five facial features and its eyes were closed. Unlike ordinary stone masks, the face on the stone didn’t have any vibes. It was as though it could open its eyes and come alive at any moment.

Everyone looked warily at the face on the stone. On the stone platform beside them, someone from the Zhang family suddenly leaped down.

It was unexpected, no one had the time to react. By the time they realized what had happened, the person had already jumped from the platform to the ground.

The ground was filled with Fiend Stones. The moment the person landed on the ground, the shoes on his feet strangely turned into Fiend Stone. Even his calves rapidly turned into Fiend Stone. It just took all of two seconds before both calves turned into Fiend Stone.

Everything happened too quickly. Only Zhang Chunqiu reacted. Using his hand as a saber, he slashed out a saber beam in midair, severing the petrified legs. He extended his hand and pulled him back to the stone platform.

At that moment, the person seemed to regain consciousness. He screamed as his legs kept bleeding.

“Stop the bleeding and treat his injuries,” Zhang Chunqiu instructed as he stared at the leg that had been completely petrified.

The legs remained standing on the ground and became one with the Fiend Stones as though they were part of them. It was so strange that it made one’s scalp tingle.

Although Zhou Wen really wanted to ask what was going on, it was clearly not the time to ask such questions. He had been using Truth Listener to scan the Fiend Tomb and the Fiend Stones, but he didn’t discover anything abnormal. All he could sense was that there was Essence Energy flowing within the Fiend Stone; nothing else was special.

“Zhou Wen, go back now. The situation at the Fiend Tomb has changed. It’s too dangerous. We need to prevent any accidents,” Zhang Chunqiu said to Zhou Wen.

Although Zhou Wen really wanted to take a picture of the tiny palm symbol of the Fiend Tomb, it was impossible for him to request to take a picture in such a situation. He had to listen to Zhang Chunqiu and leave.

The Fiend Tomb looked a little troublesome. When the Zhang family evacuated Zhou Wen, he could see members of the Zhang family constantly rushing towards the Fiend Tomb as reinforcements.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what the Fiend Tomb was like. He couldn’t help even if he wanted to.

When he returned to Celestial Master Manor, Zhou Wen kept thinking about the Fiend Tomb. He didn’t know what that strange face was.

It looked like a part of the Fiend Stone or some dimensional creature. Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure.

And this seemed to be the beginning of a nightmare. In the next few days, it was obvious that the entire Zhang family was in a tense state. There were constantly people leaving the Celestial Master Manor, and there was a high chance that they were heading for the Fiend Tomb.

“Yuzhi, how’s the situation at the Fiend Tomb?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask when he saw Zhang Yuzhi again.

“The situation isn’t good. Over the last few days, there have been people who attempted to jump into the Fiend Tomb every day. Although they were saved in the end, it’s becoming more and more frequent. No reason has been found, and questioning them comes up empty. If they still can’t find the reason, they will probably be in big trouble.

“Have you tried shattering the face on the Fiend Stone?” Zhou Wen asked.

“It’s useless. It will regrow if it’s shattered. After the face on the Fiend Stone was shattered, stone faces grew in other places. Now, there are seven stone faces around the Fiend Tomb.

Zhou Wen knew that the Zhang family had really encountered trouble this time. If they couldn’t resolve it, people would keep jumping in. In the end, the entire Zhang family might be wiped out.

“Can you tell me what’s going on with the Fiend Tomb? If it’s inconvenient, forget it,” Zhou Wen asked.

Zhang Yuzhi hesitated for a moment before whispering to Zhou Wen, “I’ll tell you about this, but don’t tell anyone. Legend has it that our Zhang family’s ancestor was buried in a special cave. With the help of the cave, a Celestial Master was born. Actually, that’s not the case. Our Zhang family found the special cave, but we didn’t find it to bury ourselves inside, but to prevent the things inside from coming out.”

“What do you mean? Do you mean that someone was already buried inside?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“To be precise, it’s not a person, but a Ba,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“Ba? Is it a type of zombie?” Zhou Wen seemed to have heard of such monsters, but he wasn’t too sure. He felt that it had something to do with zombies.

“Ordinary people often mix Ba and zombies together. In fact, the two are not the same thing. In myths, a Ba is the goddess of the heavens. She descended to the human world to help Yellow Emperor defeat Chiyou. However, because she exhausted her divine power, she couldn’t return to the heavens. Therefore, she can only sleep beneath the ground and wait for the day she recovers her divine power to return to the heavens.”

Zhang Yuzhi paused for a moment before continuing, “Ba descended to the mortal world to deal with Count of the Wind and Lord of the Rain. Even the storm they produced was incinerated in front of Ba. Even when Count of the Wind and Lord of the Rain joined forces, they weren’t a match for Ba. It’s obvious how powerful her divine power was. Ba slept underground, but once her divine power recovered, she woke up from her long slumber. Or perhaps someone disturbed her and woke her up. Her divine power spread out, causing the land to be dry and barren. That’s why she’s known as God of Drought, or Hiderigami in other places. It’s an extremely terrifying existence.

“Back then, my family’s ancestor discovered that the Ba that was sleeping underground was about to revive. That’s why he guarded the area to prevent the Ba from appearing. He was mistaken as having found a treasure cave. Over the years, our Zhang family has been guarding the Fiend Tomb to prevent the Ba from coming out. However, with the arrival of the dimensional storms, the power in the Fiend Tomb has become stronger. How long can our Zhang family guard it? Even we don’t know. The break out is only a matter of time.”

“It existed in the world before the dimensional storms. Is there really such a creature as a Ba?” Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed.

After the dimensional storms, it wasn’t surprising for any creature to appear. However, the Zhang family had already begun guarding against Ba since ancient times. This was truly surprising.

“I don’t know if there’s really a Ba, but there’s definitely something unbelievable in the Fiend Tomb. Over the years, strange things have frequently appeared in the Fiend Tomb. If it wasn’t for my Zhang family risking our lives to guard the area, I’m afraid the area around Mount Dragon Tiger would have long been plunged into misery and suffering,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

After saying that, Zhang Yuzhi got up and prepared to leave. “I have to go out for a few days. Don’t just wander around when I’m not in the Celestial Master Manor, lest others misunderstand.”

“Where are you going?” Zhou Wen was puzzled as to why Zhang Yuzhi was heading out.

The Fiend Tomb was already extremely dangerous. Logically speaking, Zhang Yuzhi should have stayed inside Celestial Master Manor to help. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I’m going to kill dimensional creatures with my brothers,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

Zhou Wen recalled the matter regarding Zhang Yuzhi’s Life Providence and said to her, “Actually, I have a golden apple that can change a person’s Life Providence without any side effects. Do you want to give it a try?”

Zhang Yuzhi was first delighted before shaking her head. “There’s no need. This is all the useless me can do to help everyone.”
