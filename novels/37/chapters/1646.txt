Chapter 1647 Two Companion Beasts

However, there was no way out. Zhou Wen and Jiuyang charged forward without any hesitation.

Jiuyang’s Sun God Light penetrated everything and illuminated everything. It was a force that was virtually impossible to hide from.

However, under the Sun God Light, the Companion Beast’s body turned into an illusion. Its true body strangely appeared behind Jiuyang as its fingertip slashed at Jiuyang’s neck like a blade.

Zhou Wen flew like an immortal as he slashed down with his Bamboo Blade. Xiao’s figure strangely appeared on the other side of the Companion Beast as he stabbed the Companion Beast’s eyes with two fingers. The Companion Beast’s fingertip that swiped at Jiuyang remained unchanged. The other monkey claw-like palm flicked the Bamboo Blade, causing it to change direction and slash at Xiao.

Xiao and Zhou Wen quickly diverted their strength, barely avoiding the situation of them killing each other. However, the Companion Beast’s fingers had already swiped at Jiuyang’s neck. At the same time, its hooves kicked out like lightning. With a sun-like glow, it kicked Zhou Wen and Xiao, sending them flying.

The armor on Zhou Wen and Xiao’s chests were destroyed. The terrifying light charred their flesh until it turned to ash.

Jiuyang had already tried his best to move forward, but a bone-deep wound remained on his neck. Blood was gushing out. Instantly, all three of them were injured.

This fellow is a freak! Zhou Wen forcefully suppressed the wound on his chest. When he saw the Companion Beast approaching him, he hurriedly dodged in the direction of the electromagnetic monster and used it to block the Companion Beast’s attack.

Just as Zhou Wen circled behind the electromagnetic monster, he saw a white light flash from the Companion Beast’s mouth. Its tongue wrapped around the electromagnetic monster and pulled its huge body towards its open mouth.

The electromagnetic monster’s body was extremely huge, but when it was pulled to the Companion Beast’s mouth, it strangely shrank and was swallowed.

The Companion Beast didn’t rush over for the time being. Jiuyang stopped the wound on the back of his neck and swallowed his saliva. “This fellow might not be as simple as a Calamity-grade creature.”

“No matter what it was in the past, we have to kill it now. Otherwise, we will be the ones dying.” Xiao’s expression was solemn.

“Do you know the origins of this Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen asked.

It was definitely not a coincidence that Xiao and Jiuyang were here. They must know something to be able to find such an inconspicuous place in the universe among millions of stars.

Jiuyang and Xiao exchanged looks as Xiao said, “There’s no need to hide anything now. This Companion Beast’s origins are somewhat special…”

Xiao recounted the origins of the Companion Beast, but he didn’t mention that it had something on it.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he heard that.

“You mean that this planet actually has two Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen stared at Xiao and asked.

“In theory, there should be two, but the other one should have been sucked dry by the parasitic Companion Beast. The chances of survival are very low,” Jiuyang said.

“That might not be the case!” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but think of the bee in the plant.

He had always believed that the bee was the Companion Beast on this planet because it had all sorts of Companion Beast characteristics.

However, after this Companion Beast appeared, Zhou Wen overturned his previous speculation, believing that the bee might be a native creature that was similar to a Companion Beast produced by this planet.

Upon hearing Xiao’s words, Zhou Wen suspected that although this planet had been parasitized by the Companion Beast, the original Companion Beast hadn’t died. It was very likely that both Companion Beasts had survived.

However, he didn’t know which was the original Companion Beast on this planet and which was the parasite.

The Companion Beast didn’t give Zhou Wen any time to consider. After floating in the air for a moment, it launched another attack and charged over like a phantom.

One after another, the phantoms used Transcendent Flying Immortal’s movement techniques to charge at Zhou Wen and company.

It was originally three people attacking a Companion Beast, but now, it was as though the three of them were being attacked by the Companion Beast.

Bang! Bang!

The phantoms were Xiao’s techniques, but at that moment, when used by the Companion Beast, they seemed to be even more powerful than Xiao’s. Not only could he not tell which were the phantoms, but every phantom seemed to have offensive strength.

Zhou Wen and company didn’t last long before they suffered varying degrees of injuries. If this continued, it was only a matter of time before they were beaten to death.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to use Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens. Although this domain was useless to him, Xiao and Jiuyang’s injuries rapidly healed inside the domain.

This crappy domain clearly has such potent healing abilities, so why can’t it heal me! Zhou Wen was extremely vexed.

Xiao and Jiuyang’s injuries quickly healed. They were originally very happy, but when they saw Zhou Wen’s situation, their expressions changed.

Zhou Wen’s strength had clearly healed them, but his injuries didn’t heal quickly. This was just too strange.

“You are really a classic example of sacrificing yourself for others,” Xiao said loudly as he fought. He had already guessed what was going on.

“Do you think it’s what I want? I can treat anyone in this crappy domain of mine but myself,” Zhou Wen said gloomily. He had already used Transcendent Flying Immortal with all his might, but the concepts of the Transcendent Flying Immortal movement techniques of the phantoms weren’t inferior to his. They were faster than him, making him suffer more and more injuries as he fought.

Although Jiuyang and Xiao’s situation was much better thanks to Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens, they were also unable to fend for themselves. They didn’t have the strength to help Zhou Wen.

They also knew very well that a large part of the reason they could survive this long was because of Zhou Wen’s double domains. One domain helped them block the Money Domain’s seal, while the other helped them rapidly recover. Without these two domains to save their lives, it was impossible for them to last until now.

Zhou Wen also knew that he couldn’t last much longer. He kept thinking about how he could escape his present predicament.

With his Teacher Domain and interstellar teleportation abilities, he might be able to escape.

However, if he escaped just like that, Tsukuyomi would definitely die under the glacier.

With the acumen of this Companion Beast, it was impossible for it not to discover Tsukuyomi’s existence. I can only take a gamble now! Zhou Wen thought of the bee in the ice pool.

If it was really the other Companion Beast on the planet, be it the original Companion Beast or the parasitic Companion Beast, in theory, the two were enemies.

After all, the parasite had snatched the nutrients of the original Companion Beast. It was impossible for the two to have a friendly relationship.

“Follow me.” Zhou Wen roared as he called out to Xiao and Jiuyang and charged down the glacier. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Although Xiao and Jiuyang didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to, they had no strength to fight once they left Zhou Wen’s domain. All they could do was rush over and burrow into the glacier with him.
