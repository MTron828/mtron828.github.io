Chapter 713: Extracting An Object From the Brain

Translator: CKtalon

The expressions of the officers changed. The An family might not even produce ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold in three years.

An Sheng said, “Mr. Dugu, can you reduce it a little? Or can we use money and dimensional crystals to make up for the rest? As you know, the production of refined Essence Gold is very low. It’s really difficult for us to hand over ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold.”

The elder said with a smile, “Adjutant An, there’s no need to act poor in front of an old man like me. Who doesn’t know that the An family’s Essence Gold mine is the richest mine in the Federation? Ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold might be a huge sum to others, but it shouldn’t be much to the An family, right? I can guarantee that Deputy Governor Qin will enjoy a full recovery. You can rest assured about this. The Dugu family is an expert in this aspect. There’s no one else in the entire Federation who can guarantee you that.”

“Mr. Dugu...” An Sheng was about to say something when he was interrupted by the elder.

“Ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold, not one bit less. Why don’t you discuss it again? However, you have to be quick. If that dimensional creature injures the brain, even my Dugu family will be helpless,” the elder said.

Everyone knew that the Dugu family was trying to take advantage of the situation, but there was nothing they could do.

No one in Luoyang could treat Qin Wufu’s injuries. If they wanted Qin Wufu to live, this was probably the only way.

An Tianzuo’s eyes were resolute. Just as he was about to say something, An Sheng spoke first. “Overseer, let Young Master Wen take a look at Governor Qin’s injuries before making a decision.”

An Tianzuo fell silent as the elder beside him smiled confidently. “It’s fine. You can get anyone to come and take a look. I don’t dare say anything else, but in the field of microscopic Companion Beasts, no one will dare claim first if our Dugu family claims second. This dimensional creature that invaded his brain can only be eliminated by our Dugu family.”

“Young Master Wen.” An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen nodded and said, “I need to observe Governor Qin’s situation up close.”

An Sheng hurriedly led Zhou Wen to the ward. On the way to the ward, An Sheng whispered to Zhou Wen, “Young Master Wen, using ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold to save Governor Qin’s life is nothing. As long as we can save him, Overseer will be willing to pay anything. However, the research on the new Essence Gold weapons in the military factory is at a critical juncture. A large amount of refined Essence Gold is needed for experiments. Without this batch of Essence Gold, the research progress will be delayed for a year or more. This will deal a severe blow to Luoyang and the An family...”

“I’ll try my best,” Zhou Wen said.

After reading the information, he had a general idea of what to do. However, the images taken by the instruments weren’t very clear. He still needed to use his Eyes of Penetration to take a clear look himself to ensure that nothing went wrong.

Standing beside Qin Wufu’s bed, Zhou Wen used his Eyes of Penetration to look at his brain.

A strange dimensional creature that looked like a blood vessel had invaded Qin Wufu’s brain. The blood vessels extended out like a fishing net that wrapped around a portion of his brain. Furthermore, it was still spreading.

Many blood vessels seemed to be part of the brain. It was difficult not to hurt the fragile brain if one wanted to remove it.

After watching for a while, Zhou Wen deactivated his Eyes of Penetration.

“Young Master Wen, what do you think?” An Sheng hurriedly asked.

“I can do it.” Zhou Wen nodded.

An Sheng was immediately overjoyed. He hurriedly turned and said to An Tianzuo, who was on the other side of the glass window, “Overseer, Young Master Wen said that he can be saved. Governor Qin, shall we get Young Master Wen to immediately rescue him?”

At this moment, the elder beside him said, “Overseer, you have to think carefully. That dimensional creature has already merged with Governor Qin’s brain. To eliminate it requires an extremely meticulous job. It also requires the cooperation of special microscopic Companion Beasts. Are you sure you want such a young man to do it? Ignoring the fact that he can’t eliminate it, even if he can, Governor Qin might end up a cripple if his brain is injured.”

An Tianzuo didn’t say a word after hearing the elder’s words. He walked to the glass window and stared at Zhou Wen. “Zhou Wen, can you ensure Governor Qin’s recovery?”

“I can only guarantee that I can eliminate the dimensional creature without harming Deputy Governor Qin’s brain. I can’t guarantee anything else,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Young man, don’t be too blindly confident. Do you know what that dimensional creature is called? Do you know what kind of ability it has?” the elder said with a smile.

“I don’t know, nor do I need to know. I just need to know that I can eliminate it,” Zhou Wen said.

“Overseer, did you hear that? What kind of statement is that? Do you really want to use such a person?” The elder laughed. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But soon, the elder’s smile froze. An Tianzuo directly said to Zhou Wen, “Immediately treat Deputy Governor Qin.”

“Overseer, isn’t your decision a little too rash? Or do you think Deputy Governor Qin’s life is more important than ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold? Wouldn’t this demoralize your subordinates?” the elder said with a smile. His words were clearly provoking the other officers.

He wanted to use the officers’ emotions to pressure An Tianzuo. Ten tonnes of refined Essence Gold were very important resources for the Dugu family.

The elder wasn’t afraid that Zhou Wen could treat Qin Wufu because he didn’t believe that Zhou Wen had the ability to do so. He was afraid that he would have no hope of obtaining the batch of refined Essence Gold if Zhou Wen killed Qin Wufu.

An Tianzuo didn’t answer the elder. He looked at an officer beside him and asked, “If you were Governor Qin, who would you choose to treat you?”

“Young Master Wen,” the officer answered without hesitation.

The elder’s expression changed slightly. Things seemed to be different from what he had imagined.

“What about you?” An Tianzuo asked another officer.

“Young Master Wen,” the officer immediately answered.

An Tianzuo asked one by one, and all the officers chose Zhou Wen without any hesitation. There was no exception. From their expressions, it seemed like a forgone conclusion.

“Overseer, your methods of subordination are truly brilliant.” The elder held back the surprise in his heart. He had imagined that An Tianzuo had given strict orders, making them be willing to risk their lives without any complaints.

Although he said that, he couldn’t help but look at Zhou Wen in the ward. He thought to himself, Does he really have that ability?

However, when his gaze landed on Zhou Wen, his pupils constricted. He saw a strange dimensional creature formed from red threads in Zhou Wen’s hand. It was the dimensional creature in Qin Wufu’s head. Zhou Wen had already taken out the dimensional creature at some point in time, and it was alive.

“That’s impossible!” The elder wore a look of disbelief as he pressed his hands against the glass window. His eyes yearned to reach out to Zhou Wen, hoping to see if the dimensional creature in his hand was fake.
