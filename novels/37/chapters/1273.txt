Chapter 1274: Six-Winged Seraphim

“Heavens… That’s Seraph…”

“The Burning One!”

“This world is really about to undergo a huge change. Even Seraph has appeared!”

Many believers who saw this scene began praying to the six-winged seraphim.

The six-winged seraphim represented the head of angels in the Old Testament. All believers were proud to see seraphim.

“The emergence of Seraph and showing his holiness marks the moment for our Church to save the world again,” an archbishop cried in excitement.

This was an era of collapsed faith. All sorts of immortals, saints, and devils had been slaughtered. Humanity’s religious faith turned more and more indifferent, and the number of devotees had decreased.

However, there were still many pious believers who believed that their true god definitely existed.

Now that the six-winged seraphim had appeared, many pious believers believed that the true angel had descended. Their true god was about to save them.

The upper echelons of the various factions had different expressions when they saw the angel’s figure. Some were happy, while others were sad.

The people of the West District naturally believed that it was a powerful existence that belonged to their region. If it really descended, it might bring good changes to the West District.

However, even the bigwigs of the Cape family and the Family Clan of Gods were not happy at all.

Their thoughts were completely different from ordinary people. Even if there were powerful existences in their own districts, as long as they weren’t under their control, they were only a threat.

Who cared about angels or demons? In this era, they no longer believed in such things.

Xia Liuchuan happened to be a guest at the Zhang family’s residence. When he saw this scene, he asked Zhang Chunqiu, “Make a guess. Is the creature in the battle really the legendary Seraph of the West District?”

“I don’t know. After all, it’s not something from our district. I don’t know much about it,” Zhang Chunqiu said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Xia Liuchuan curled his lips and continued, “According to what I know, in the West District’s Old Testament, the Seraph described should have four or two heads. This looks too normal. Furthermore, if it’s just a shadow, I wonder if it’s really Seraph. Perhaps it’s just the effects of the lighting.”

“It’s not lighting effects. It should be the manifestation of a Calamity-grade power.” Zhang Chunqiu paused for a moment before saying, “If such power appears on Earth, it will be a miracle. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that a true god has descended.”

However, Xia Liuchuan said, “Actually, I want to know who her opponent is. Regardless of whether she’s really Seraph or not, to be able to fight her to such an extent without seeing the full display of strength, her opponent might be stronger.”

“Perhaps.” Zhang Chunqiu wasn’t as curious as Xia Liuchuan. He only hoped that a battle of this level wouldn’t appear on Earth. Otherwise, it would be a disaster for humanity.

Originally, only a few people could see this battle, but due to the archbishop’s excitement and eagerness to spread this miracle, he broadcast the scene transmitted by satellite. It immediately attracted many people from the Federation and overseas.

“Holy sh*t, what’s that? Seraph?”

“That’s Venus, right? Seraph is fighting on Venus? Who is she fighting?”

“Why is this outside Venus? Shouldn’t she be challenging the Venusian dimensional zone?”

More and more people joined in the spectacle. Through word of mouth, many people knew that Seraph had appeared. Many fanatical believers immediately got onto the Internet to watch the livestream. Some even prostrated themselves before the angel.

Zhou Wen didn’t think there was anything to worship. He knew better than anyone how vicious that woman was. Zhou Wen wished he could kill her with one strike, much less worship her.

However, the Immortal Culling Sword hadn’t absorbed enough Essence Energy. It still hadn’t been pulled out.

To Zhou Wen’s pleasant surprise, the power that the woman erupted with suddenly increased significantly, causing the solid Essence Energy in the Chaos Egg to rapidly condense. Instantly, it caught up to the absorption speed of the Immortal Culling Sword.

This woman is strong!

?Zhou Wen originally imagined that the woman had already displayed her strongest combat strength, but he never expected her to suddenly unleash her full power.

In fact, it wasn’t that the woman didn’t want to unleash her power earlier, but if she used this power, it would result in serious consequences for her. Unless it was absolutely necessary, she didn’t want to use it.

Under normal circumstances, the woman wouldn’t have used such power.

Even if she couldn’t kill the metal flower, the metal flower wouldn’t be able to defeat her. At the end of the day, both parties would have their strength depleted. When the Calamity Zone’s strength was weakened, she would be able to rush out.

What she couldn’t tolerate was that she couldn’t even deal with a mere human. He was clearly a weak fellow, but she had no idea what the ball he had condensed was. Despite hitting it so many times, it didn’t break. She couldn’t tolerate letting Zhou Wen off.

Even if she had to make some sacrifices, she had to break the Chaos Egg and kill the detestable Zhou Wen on the spot to restore her calm.

At that moment, the woman had six angelic wings spread out from her back. An angelic halo appeared above her head as her entire body spewed out Holy Light that was as hot as flames.

Holy Light filled the entire battlefield, forming the silhouette of the six-winged seraphim. Even the metal flower’s vibrational domain was suppressed.

It would be very easy for the woman to leave the battlefield now, but she no longer wanted to leave.

Anyone would feel terrible if they couldn’t vent the frustration after paying a huge price for the massive strength. It was the same for the woman.

She stared coldly at the Chaos Egg that had bounced back. She clenched her hand as blazing Holy Light condensed into a flaming sword.

The Holy Light over the Blazing Flame Sword was thousands of times stronger than the Holy Light over her body. It slashed at the Chaos Egg and a sword beam that seemed to split the heavens and earth apart slashed down, splitting open the metal flower’s Calamity Zone and slashing at the Chaos Egg.

Zhou Wen was alarmed when he saw this. He was somewhat worried if the Chaos Egg could withstand such a terrifying force, but at this point, he could only take a gamble.

Boom!

The people watching the live broadcast saw the six-winged seraphim emit a sword-like Holy Light. The Holy Light split the ground, forming a long ditch that spanned hundreds of kilometers. It was like the Sword of Judgment of the Apocalypse.

As the metal flower’s Calamity Zone was slashed open, they finally saw the situation inside.

The rift that had been slashed open by the Holy Light stretched on endlessly while the six-winged seraphim floated in the air. In the rift was a huge tower-like pillar. Atop the pillar was a metal flower.

“Holy sh*t, the creature fighting Seraph is actually a flower. What’s the origin of that flower? It can actually fight a six-winged seraphim?”

“Unbelievable. A plant-type dimensional creature has such powerful combat strength?”

“A plant that can fight Seraph?”
