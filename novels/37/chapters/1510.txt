Chapter 1511 Zhou Wen Defends the City

Apart from Great Brahma’s back, the other three faces didn’t have powerful offensive strength, but that wasn’t an absolute fact. They had different effects.

Under normal circumstances, Zhou Wen used Great Brahma’s frontal defense and the terrifying black hole-like power on its back. He seldom used the power from both sides.

Now that he saw many soul-type creatures, he could use the power of the compassionate face on the right.

Ordinary people couldn’t see the Terror-form Great Brahma at all, but as his lips trembled, he let out a chant.

Everyone heard the chanting of Buddhas. Although it wasn’t loud, nor did it have a mighty force, preventing ordinary people from feeling much when they heard it, it was enough to make the wandering ghosts let out painful wails. The low-level ghosts couldn’t withstand the pain and tumbled on the ground. White gas spewed out from their bodies as they quickly dissipated.

The ghosts within a radius of dozens of kilometers were reduced to white mist amidst the chanting, filling Guide City with rising white gas. Many dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs landed on the ground, but the average person wasn’t affected. “Hmph, I never expected Wang Mingyuan’s disciple to master the ability of deliverance. He must have obtained Wang Mingyuan’s help,” Zither Immortal said with a frown.

Deliverance powers were the nemesis of ghosts. Among the Buddha race, only a few experts had mastered them.

Wang Mingyuan was only a subsidiary of the Buddha race, not a member of the Buddha race, and he didn’t seem to have mastered the ability to provide deliverance. Zither Immortal and company never expected Zhou Wen’s Terror form to have a deliverance ability.

From their point of view, Wang Mingyuan was a vassal of the Buddha race. Zhou Wen had definitely received Wang Mingyuan’s help to master such an ability.

The people who had been possessed by ghosts also spewed out white gas. After the white gas spewed out, they fainted. Instantly, the entire city was littered with unconscious humans.

The people who weren’t possessed by the ghosts and the people who had woken up from their unconsciousness saw Zhou Wen floating in midair. The Buddha-like chanting came from him.

As for the wandering ghosts that rushed over from all directions, once they entered the range of the chanting, they quickly turned into white mist. No one could approach the vicinity of Guide High School.

The wandering ghosts rushed over like a tidal wave. They looked extremely terrifying, but none of the ghosts could take half a step into the pool of destruction.

“Zhou Wen is still the best. As expected of a human expert who can enter the Cube’s ranking. He’s just too powerful.”

“How terrifying. It’s like a Buddha’s descent into the world.”

“With Zhou Wen guarding Guide City, perhaps we really don’t have to think of a way to flee to other cities.”

Upon seeing Zhou Wen’s might, everyone felt a lot more at ease. Many people who were in a panic gradually calmed down. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The troops that Li Xuan had just established were organized again to suppress the skeleton legion that rushed out of the ancient city.

Everything seemed to be improving. Just as everyone thought that the crisis was about to end, they saw a behemoth approaching from afar.

The moonlight-like brilliance easily attracted everyone’s attention. They saw an extremely huge snake with a body seemingly carved from white jade. It separated from the tide of ghosts and swam over. Just raising its head was enough to make it look like a skyscraper. The surrounding buildings looked as laughable as toys.

Everyone retreated in horror. Even if such a huge snake’s level wasn’t high, its physical strength was something ordinary people couldn’t match.

“The Buddha race’s deliverance powers are effective against ghosts, but against a creature like the white snake, they won’t be able to gain the upper hand. The chances of a Terror-grade against a Calamity-grade are slim,” Chess Immortal said.

The white snake flicked its tail and split a thirty-story building. Half of the building flew up and smashed in the direction of Guide High School. Humans scrambled to dodge it.

Such divine might left the humans dumbfounded. The power of its tail was already so terrifying. The students and ordinary people in the school fled the school in horror.

The entire school or even the school’s surroundings would be reduced to ruins if half a building smashed down at such terrifying speeds. Death was a certainty if they didn’t escape.

However, with their speed, it was impossible for them to escape the school before the building flew over. Seeing the building’s shadow rapidly envelop the school, everyone revealed looks of horror and despair. Some of the more timid girls screamed and cried.

Boom!

Zhou Wen appeared in front of the building as Great Brahma’s god-like body appeared. He sat cross-legged behind Zhou Wen.

The face at the back had already turned around. Eight palms blocked the building. At the same time, the black hole at the back constantly devoured the crumbling building, preventing the fragments from shooting out and injuring the people in the school.

Everyone looked at Zhou Wen and Great Brahma which was floating in front of him as though they were looking at an immortal with a demonic slave.

“What powerful Terror transformation power! Thankfully, he’s only at the Terror grade. If he were to advance to the Calamity grade, I’m afraid that the white snake wouldn’t be his match,” Painting Immortal exclaimed.

“The stronger he is, the more beneficial it will be for us. In the future, it will be much more convenient for you to use Zhou Wen,” Calligraphy Immortal said.

“That’s precisely the logic. When he’s no match for the white snake in battle, His Excellency will take action. He won’t have a choice when it comes to submission,” Chess Immortal echoed.

As the few of them conversed, the white snake had already leaped up. Its body was huge, but its speed was unbelievably fast. It transformed into a huge white beam that rushed toward Zhou Wen in a bid to devour him.

Just the shockwave caused by its body breaking through the sound barrier shattered the glass in the surrounding buildings. Many buildings collapsed from the shockwave as trees were uprooted.

Thankfully, there were only ghosts. Otherwise, countless people would have died. Zhou Wen remained levitating in midair without any intention of dodging. He watched as the white snake arrived in front of him.

Just as Chess Immortal and company were wondering why Zhou Wen didn’t dodge, they saw a golden light flash from Zhou Wen’s body that met the white snake.

Before anyone could see what had happened, they saw that the white snake’s head had been chopped off. Blood spewed out like a fountain as Zhou Wen remained floating there without even moving his hand.

As for Great Brahma behind him, he extended his palm and grabbed the white snake’s head and body, preventing it from falling and smashing into the humans below.

“Long live Zhou Wen!”

“He’s utterly invincible!”

“So other than Human Sovereign, there are other humans who are this powerful. I was right to stay in Guide City.” “Pui! You stayed because you couldn’t leave. Do you have the shame?”

Everyone was amazed at Zhou Wen’s strength. The four immortals—Zither, Chess, Calligraphy, and Painting—as well as Berserker Immortal were somewhat alarmed. Although they felt that the white snake might not necessarily be able to kill Zhou Wen, they never expected the white snake to be killed by Zhou Wen in one strike. It was a Calamity creature after all. It was already shocking enough to be at the Human Realm.
