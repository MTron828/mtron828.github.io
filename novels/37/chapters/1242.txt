Chapter 1243: Battle of Mount Laojun 5

Translator: CKtalon

Just as the golden sword was about to slash at Zhou Wen, he finally moved.

The golden chains that bound him were like rotting ropes. As Zhou Wen slashed, they shattered one by one and turned to dust.

The sword formed by Sword Pill drew a beautiful arc, but it was so fast that no one could react.

Sword Pill collided with the golden sword, but the blade didn’t stop. It didn’t even pause as it continued slashing forward.

Clang!

When Zhou Wen retracted his sword, everyone heard the hum of the sword. They couldn’t help but look at Yellowright. As the strike was too fast, they failed to see if the strike had hit him.

.

Yellowright stood there, looking uninjured. He still maintained the stance of slashing forward, and the sword of imperial authority also appeared unharmed.

However, for some reason, Yellowright stood there motionless as his eyes were filled with horror.

Suddenly, he moved. No, it shouldn’t be said that Yellowright moved. More accurately, Yellowright’s body was sliding apart.

Like a fractured iceberg, the upper half of Yellowright’s body and the lower half slowly slid away. It was the same for his golden sword. The sword broke from the middle.

“Yellowright...” Thunderstorm watched Yellowright’s corpse collapse with a look of shock.

Although Yellowright wasn’t the strongest among the saints, he wasn’t weak either. Despite him attacking first, he was killed by a human with a single strike. This was unimaginable.

“Sigh, why was he sick of living? Why were you so disobedient?” Xiao sighed.

Among the many officers of the Sunset Army, the officers who had been to Netherworld City had better reactions. However, those who hadn’t seen Zhou Wen showcase his might there were in a daze.

Zhou Wen’s strike gave off a unique sense of shock when compared to An Tianzuo’s powerful firepower.

Although it wasn’t as ferocious as the full-powered firepower, it sent chills down one’s spine and gave one goosebumps.

Most people failed to see Zhou Wen’s strike, but after Yellowright was killed, his body appeared. The scene of half Yellowright’s body slowly sliding down made it difficult to forget.

Zhou Wen glanced at An Tianzuo and saw that although An Tianzuo’s situation was dire, he wasn’t in immediate danger of death. He didn’t rush over immediately.

As for Cave Era and company, they were alarmed when they saw Zhou Wen kill Yellowright with one strike. Their attacks became even crazier.

They originally imagined that An Tianzuo was already very terrifying, but they never expected another person to be even more terrifying than him.

If they couldn’t finish off An Tianzuo before Zhou Wen rushed over, how terrifying would it be to have the two of them join forces? They didn’t dare imagine it, nor were they willing to think about it.

The pressure on An Tianzuo increased exponentially. The armor on his body suffered some injuries as blood seeped out.

However, An Tianzuo’s eyes remained calm the entire time. Despite being on the brink of death, he still looked at his watch.

He was actually wearing a watch on his wrist. While looking at the time, An Tianzuo dodged Cave Era’s attack at the critical moment and said, “10.”

Nobody knew what An Tianzuo meant. Why did he suddenly say such a number?

“9,” An Tianzuo continued as he fought.

Only then did everyone realize that An Tianzuo was counting down.

“8.” An Tianzuo continued counting.

Hermit and Blood Shaman didn’t know why An Tianzuo was counting down, but as An Tianzuo counted down, they couldn’t help but become nervous. Their attacks became even more ferocious.

Zhou Wen had already realized something, so he wasn’t in a rush to join the battle. Instead, he aimed his sword at Xiao and Thunderstorm.

“Will you be escaping this time as well?” Zhou Wen asked Xiao.

Although his movement technique was excellent, it was still very difficult for him to retain Xiao if he was desperate to escape.

“Escape? How is that possible?” After Xiao said that, his figure suddenly drew a strange trajectory and flew backward like a ghost. In the blink of an eye, he vanished without a trace. Only his voice still echoed in place.

“This is called a tactical retreat.”

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised, but Thunderstorm was already dumbfounded.

The three saints had besieged a young man and one of them was killed with a single strike. The other fled without fighting, leaving him rooted to the ground. Before he came here, he never expected such a huge change to happen in less than twenty seconds.

The officers of the Sunset Army looked at Zhou Wen with odd expressions.

An Tianzuo’s strength was shocking, but Zhou Wen left their hearts chilling.

They had previously believed that Zhou Wen had been besieged by three people, but now, they suddenly realized that it was Zhou Wen besieging the three saints alone.

They were still worried for Zhou Wen, worried that he would die from the siege, but now, they suddenly felt that it was a pity that Xiao had escaped.

Thunderstorm gritted his teeth as the Connate aura on his body transformed into the power of lightning. His surroundings were instantly drowned by lightning. He didn’t have Xiao’s speed, nor was he good at escaping. Therefore, he could only fight with his life.

Just as Thunderstorm raised his fist, Zhou Wen’s Sword Pill arrived in front of him. Wherever the blade passed, the lightning dissipated and Thunderstorm’s corpse collapsed.

“Was the saint Young Master Wen killed really at the Terror grade?” an officer asked in puzzlement.

Many officers were puzzled. Thunderstorm and Yellowright looked too weak. They didn’t look like they were at the Terror grade.

Qin Wufu sighed and said, “It’s not that those two saints aren’t at the Terror grade, but that Zhou Wen seems inhuman.”

Everyone agreed with him. Many officers subconsciously nodded. Qin Wufu’s words had hit the nail on the head.

“Governor Qin, why are you cursing?” Ouyang Lan was displeased.

If Zhou Wen was inhuman, what was she as a mother?

Although Zhou Wen didn’t participate in An Tianzuo’s battle, everything that happened here had a huge impact on the battle.

Cave Era and company originally wanted to finish off An Tianzuo before Zhou Wen rushed over.

However, no one expected that everything would happen so quickly. The sudden appearance of the three saints only resulted in two deaths and one escape. Everything happened so quickly that they couldn’t react in time. They found it unbelievable.

However, at the instant Thunderstorm collapsed, their fighting spirit fell to rock bottom. They knew very well that there was no chance. Zhou Wen, who had been hiding in the An family, was even more terrifying than An Tianzuo. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“3...” An Tianzuo’s countdown continued like a haunting spell.

Now, Cave Era and company were beginning to regret chasing after An Tianzuo. However, who would have expected such a situation?

They wanted to retreat, but under An Tianzuo’s terrifying firepower, it wasn’t that easy.

Cave Era and Hermit might have a way to retreat immediately, but once they did, doom was a certainty for the other Terror-grade Guardians.

“2...”

Cave Era had already made plans to retreat, but she didn’t immediately implement them. She wanted to know what An Tianzuo’s countdown meant.

“1...” Finally, An Tianzuo spat out the last number.
