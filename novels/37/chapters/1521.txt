Chapter 1522 Unexpected

No matter how much Berserker Immortal refused to believe it, all his attacks were blocked by Zhou Wen. Berserker Immortal kept speeding up his sword, but they were still intercepted by Zhou Wen every time.

It was as though a car was repeatedly overtaking another only to end with a collision. The Sword of Blood scattered in all directions. Although it would ultimately return to Berserker Immortal, the situation had already made a 180-degree turn.

Zhou Wen held the absolute initiative as he struck again and again, forcing Berserker Immortal to retreat.

Berserker Immortal had already changed his sword art, hoping to suppress Zhou Wen again, but no matter how his sword art changed, it was impossible to take back the advantage.

Zhou Wen seemed to see through everything. No matter how his sword art changed, Zhou Wen could strike at his most uncomfortable spot and attack his weakness. It made him so uncomfortable that he nearly vomited blood.

Berserker Immortal found it unacceptable that his sword art had been defeated by a human. This was even more intolerable than Wang Mingyuan slapping him twice. After the previous battle, The Disqualified had completely deduced all the weaknesses of Berserker Immortal. Zhou Wen now knew Berserker Immortal’s weaknesses better than Berserker Immortal himself.

“I want you dead!” Berserker Immortal’s strength erupted crazily, exceeding the limits of the ancient corpse’s body. The ancient corpse’s body constantly cracked as withered flesh fell from its body. It was about to collapse.

Berserker Immortal seemed to have gone mad as he brandished the Sword of Blood and slashed at Zhou Wen crazily. He no longer cared if he would be injured by the Golden Wyrm Scissors. He wanted to split Zhou Wen’s body before the Golden Wyrm Scissors could snap him. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The two of them were vying for that initiative. No one was willing to retreat at this moment.

Clang!

The Golden Wyrm Scissors in Zhou Wen’s hand suddenly spread open as the scissors that were originally stabbing at Berserker Immortal split into two. The top part blocked the Sword of Blood that was slashing at Zhou Wen and instantly snapped it. The bottom part continued stabbing at Berserker Immortal without stopping, piercing through his chest.

Not only did the heavily injured Berserker Immortal not show any signs of panic, but his lips even suffused a ferocious smile.

“Berserker Devouring the Heavens. The Door of Immortality seals one’s life. You underestimate me too much. Enjoy your last moments.” A chain-like sword beam spewed out from Berserker Immortal’s wound, instantly wrapping around the Golden Wyrm Scissors and Zhou Wen’s body.

The sword aura in Berserker Immortal’s ancient corpse expanded like a balloon that was about to explode. Furthermore, it burgeoned constantly.

Zhou Wen struggled a few times, but he failed to escape. He felt as though his body was chained by the sword beam. He couldn’t even escape the restrictions with teleportation.

Even a powerful Companion Beast like the Golden Wyrm Scissors was firmly bound and unable to escape.

“Human, this is your destiny. You chose the wrong enemy. The power of this body’s self-destruction will consign you to eternal damnation. As for me, I will leave this body and return to the dimension unharmed. The next time I return, I will turn all your family and friends into servants or send them to hell to accompany you…” Berserker Immortal’s eyes were ferocious and smug, like a wolf that had caught its prey.

However, before Berserker Immortal could finish his words, he suddenly frowned slightly. He looked down and saw that Zhou Wen had stabbed a sword into his body with his other hand.

“It’s useless. Your attack will only make this body explode faster. No matter how injured this body is, it won’t affect me…” As Berserker Immortal spoke, his expression suddenly turned nasty.

He realized that the immortal body attached to the ancient corpse was suffering damage. The source of the damage was the sword in Zhou Wen’s left hand.

“This is… the Immortal Culling Sword… You are Human Sovereign…” Only then did Berserker Immortal seriously size up the sword. He was alarmed by what he saw.

Zhou Wen didn’t answer. The Immortal Culling Sword in his hand erupted with power as it sliced up from the ancient corpse’s abdomen, tearing open its entire chest along with the sword beam chains.

The Immortal Culling Sword’s ability to restrain Immortals was just too powerful. The Immortal Culling Sword easily severed the Immortal Gate Life Lock that could seal the Golden Wyrm Scissors. It was not much different from slicing through tofu.

What was even more terrifying was that the wound delivered by Immortal Culling Sword didn’t only affect the ancient corpse. Berserker Immortal, who was attached to the ancient corpse, was also injured. Furthermore, the injuries were rapidly spreading

Even someone as powerful as Berserker Immortal couldn’t stop the injury inflicted by the Immortal Culling Sword from spreading.

After Zhou Wen severed the Immortal Gate Life Lock, he slashed at Berserker Immortal with the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand again and again. At the instant the ancient corpse exploded, he instant transmitted into the distance.

Boom!

The ancient corpse exploded, triggering a large-scale energy explosion on Dubhe. Terrifying energy blasts and radiation made the nearby cosmos seem to burn.

A red sword beam rushed out of the explosions on Dubhe.

The sword beam hadn’t gone far before it was intercepted by Zhou Wen who had instant transmitted over.

The red glow was none other than Berserker Immortal who had escaped the ancient corpse’s body. At that moment, his body seemed to be bound by invisible chains. The chains tightened as the sword beams on the red glow weakened.

Furthermore, there were sword marks on the humanoid body condensed from the red glow. The sword marks constantly extended as they tore through Berserker Immortal’s body.

Berserker Immortal unleashed a barrage of sword beams in a bid to break through Zhou Wen’s obstruction. Unfortunately, his Heaven-level strength was almost unable to reach the Hell level under the suppression of Earth’s cosmic rules.

Clang!

The Golden Wyrm Scissors flashed as one of Berserker Immortal’s arms was sliced off, making his already terrible situation even direr.

“If it wasn’t for this darn place, you would have died ten thousand times over. How could you injure me?” Berserker Immortal knew that it would be difficult for him to escape today, so he stopped fleeing and gathered his remaining strength to fight Zhou Wen to the death.

“Then why did you come?” Zhou Wen said indifferently as he mercilessly slashed with the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand.

Berserker Immortal was slightly taken aback. He had never expected such a situation when he came.

If he had known that Zhou Wen was so ferocious, he wouldn’t have given him a chance. If he had known that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign and possessed the Immortal Culling Sword, he wouldn’t have used the Immortal Gate Life Lock that gave Zhou Wen a chance to approach him.

It was too late. There were no what-ifs.

At this point, Berserker Immortal was somewhat relieved. He looked at Zhou Wen and said, “I never expected Zhou Wen, Deceit King, and Human Sovereign to be the same person. You’re very good. My loss wasn’t in vain, but don’t think that you won just like that. If you want my life, you have to pay the price.”

With that said, without waiting for Zhou Wen to react, Berserker Immortal’s red body suddenly transformed into thousands of sword beams. They bloomed in space like blood-red flowers.
