Chapter 1251: Speed of Light

“You call this a model?” Zhou Wen looked at the device in front of him that was the size of a tractor and asked An Sheng with an odd expression.

“It’s a model. It’s only 1/25th the size of the real deal. However, because it’s used in simulation experiments, its basic theory and functions are about the same as the real one. The only difference is that it’s a little weaker and doesn’t have the functions that are used in practice.” An Sheng pointed at the device and explained, “Although it’s a little weaker, you can’t say the same about its speed. It can’t even be dodged at the Terror grade. It’s perfect if you want to practice with it.”

“How do I operate this thing?” Zhou Wen looked at the device that resembled a tractor’s cockpit and had a headache.

“Although there’s a computer that can set the launch parameters, it’s still an experimental product. In order to prevent any accidents, someone needs to be at the operating console. However, this thing can’t be seen by others at the moment, so there are only four non-staff who have the authority to come here. Only I can help you.” An Sheng went to the operating console.

Soon, the front end of the device that looked like a tractor lit up. In front of it was a black crystal in the shape of a fence. On careful look, the fence was made of tiny hexagonal crystals.

“Young Master Wen… I’m going to start firing… You have to be careful…” An Sheng shouted.

“Bring it on.” Zhou Wen chose a suitable distance to stand and looked at the shiny crystal opposite him.

There was no sound, nor were there any signs as one of the hexagonal crystals shot out a beam. It was different from the light-type skills used by ordinary humans. It was the true speed of light.

Bang!

Zhou Wen’s chest was struck by the light—his body didn’t even move.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The might of the beam wasn’t high. Most of it was equivalent to a Legendary attack. Even Zhou Wen’s armor wasn’t injured.

The speed of light is indeed about the same as that Calamity-grade bullet. Zhou Wen was very satisfied with the model’s beam speed.

Furthermore, the hexagonal crystals were akin to gun barrels. Under An Sheng’s control, beams shot out from different crystals. As they were controlled by the computer, Zhou Wen couldn’t predict them in advance. All he could do was wait for the beams to shoot out before reacting.

He tried many times, but he failed every time. Even if Zhou Wen used the Demon Dragon King armor and used the power of the Terror-grade Companion Beasts, he could only see the beams shoot out, but it was already too late to dodge.

The speed of light is just too fast. With my present speed, I can’t even dodge, much less block it with my sword—unless the other party directly targets the Son of Heaven Sword. Zhou Wen repeated his attempts and quickly confirmed that it was impossible to block the beam with speed unless he advanced to the Terror grade and had the help of eight Terror-grade Companion Beasts. Only then could he react and block the beam in time.

Since speed isn’t enough, I’ll have to think of another way. As Zhou Wen thought, he attempted to block the beam with his reaction.

“Young Master Wen, it’s not feasible to rely on human reaction and speed to block the speed of light at such a distance. The Overseer has also tried, but he can’t dodge the speed of light,” An Sheng said.

An Sheng knew very well that such attempts were futile. If one wasn’t fast enough, they just weren’t fast enough. If one was too lacking, it wasn’t something that could be made up through hard work.

Zhou Wen naturally knew that training alone wasn’t enough. However, after hearing An Sheng’s words, his eyes suddenly lit up. He looked at An Sheng and asked, “Ah Sheng, what did you just say?”

“Young Master Wen, I’m not trying to put you down about your speed, but at your present speed, it’s impossible for you to dodge a light-speed attack,” Ah Sheng said truthfully. He didn’t give any unrealistic flattery just because he had a good relationship with Zhou Wen.

“No, you just said that you can’t block the speed of light at such a distance. In other words, if you are far enough away, you can block the speed of light?” Zhou Wen said.

“If we assume that the distance is far enough, there will be a time difference, so you should be able to block it. However, the distance needed is just too great. It’s very difficult to pull away to such a distance. Furthermore, there’s another drawback. At such a distance, you won’t be able to see it before the light arrives. When you can see the light, it will already be there. Therefore, this is only a hypothesis,” An Sheng said.

“Although it’s only a hypothesis, it’s not impossible. It’s still possible to exchange space for time,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.

However, just as An Sheng had said, the speed of light was too fast. Light could travel sufficiently far with just a tenth of a second.

Interstellar teleportation could open up such a distance in a short period of time, but there was no such distance available for Zhou Wen in the Venusian dimensional zone.

However, Zhou Wen was good at spatial powers. Perhaps he could give it a try and use spatial skills to widen the distance.

Zhou Wen carefully considered the various abilities of the Godfiend Era and Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping. From his present spatial skills, he couldn’t extend space.

Zhou Wen had previously seen Jiuyue use spatial extension. Since someone could do it, it meant that there was definitely such a spatial skill.

“Where can I get such a spatial skill?” Zhou Wen told An Sheng his idea.

An Sheng thought for a moment and said, “I don’t know if this method works, but we don’t have dimensional zones that produce such spatial skills here. Even if other places produce them, they will definitely be very rare. Furthermore, we can only buy Mythical skill crystals at most. No one at the Terror grade will sell them.”

“It’s fine if it’s at the Mythical stage. How can I buy it?” Zhou Wen thought that since Liu Yun could cultivate Star Stealer to the Terror grade, he could give it a try.

“We can only try our luck at the Holy City’s Fireworks Lane. It’s the only place that’s most likely to have it. Even if the other families have it, they won’t casually sell it,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the Holy City’s Fireworks Lane. He had been there before. The Faceless Buddha in Fireworks Lane was his classmate, Gu Dian.

Upon hearing An Sheng’s words, Zhou Wen attempted to send Gu Dian a message, explaining his intention of buying a spatial skill crystal.

Before long, Gu Dian replied to his message. “There are spatial skill crystals. The ones you mentioned don’t exist. No one will sell them even if they do.”

Zhou Wen was immediately disappointed. Although spatial skills weren’t something that couldn’t be created by oneself, the difficulty of creating them was as difficult as humans discovering the periodic law of elements in the past. It required luck and constant research to achieve it. It wasn’t something that could be done with just a thought.

To his surprise, Gu Dian sent a second message. “I know of a place that can produce such spatial skill crystals. The drop rate is very low. If you aren’t afraid of trouble or death, you can give it a try.”

“Where is it?” Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly asked.

“West District, Time Hut.” Gu Dian quickly replied.
