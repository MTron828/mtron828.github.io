Chapter 893: Battle for Advancement

Translator: CKtalon

Gu Dian, Feng Qiuyan, Sadie, Gulli, Fang Ruoxi, and the other members of the Xuanwen Club watched the two of them fight from the side.

Feng Qiuyan watched for a while before his eyes lit up. “President has become much stronger after returning. Be it his movement techniques or skills, he has already reached the limits of a human. In addition, he can constantly recover and become stronger in battle. Coach might really be in trouble this time.”

Sadie nodded slightly. “What’s terrifying about Li Xuan is that he has countless chances of failure. As for others, if they make one mistake, they might never have another chance. This ability is really enviable.”

Gulli said enviously, “Why don’t I have such a sick Life Soul?”

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan kept fighting. Zhou Wen coupled Transcendent Flying Immortal with Defy Ancient Sovereign, but the pressure from the battle remained immense.

Li Xuan’s movement technique was strange and inexplicable. It looked like he had inherited the Dugu family’s best teachings. Although he hadn’t reached the level of Transcendent Flying Immortal’s divine technique, he couldn’t be underestimated.

Most importantly, when Zhou Wen’s attack struck Li Xuan’s carapace, he could at best shatter it. It didn’t affect Li Xuan’s ability to continue the battle. Furthermore, after the carapace shattered, it would become even sturdier. It wouldn’t be easy for Zhou Wen to shatter it again.

Not only was the carapace becoming stronger, but Li Xuan was also constantly becoming stronger. His various techniques became more and more bizarre, and the changes became more and more unpredictable. Many stances didn’t look like something which were humanly possible.

Zhou Wen knew that this was definitely a technique and skill that Li Xuan had learned from dimensional creatures.

Zhou Wen had already pushed the Defy Ancient Sovereign’s strength to its limits. Transcendent Flying Immortal couldn’t be any faster, but he still couldn’t take down Li Xuan.

Li Xuan became more and more accustomed to the battle with Zhou Wen as he became stronger.

“Among his peers, the only one who can fight Coach to such an extent is probably President,” Feng Qiuyan said.

Sadie thought for a moment and said, “Perhaps some people might have the ability to determine the outcome of the battle with Coach in a short period of time, but there aren’t many people who can fight Coach head-on in such a manner.”

“Sis, do you think President has a chance of defeating Coach?” Gulli asked with interest.

“It’s hard to say. From the looks of it, Li Xuan is invincible. It’s not like there’s no chance,” Sadie said after some thought.

Feng Qiuyan also said, “Coach’s technique, abilities, and timing are undoubtedly top-notch. If it were an ordinary person, they would have long been defeated. However, President is the type of person who can’t be killed. Coach’s dominance will slowly decrease due to the expenditure of stamina and Essence Energy. As for President, as long as he doesn’t die, he will slowly become stronger. Time is on President’s side, so there’s indeed a chance unless Coach can defeat President in a short period of time.”

“Imagine the look on Coach’s face when he is defeated. That would definitely be interesting. I’m really looking forward to it,” Gulli said excitedly.

In fact, many people had such expectations. It wasn’t that Zhou Wen had a worse relationship with them compared to Li Xuan, but deep in the hearts of humans, they sympathized with the weak and hoped that the myth would be shattered.

In recent times, Zhou Wen was almost synonymous with invincibility. In comparison, Li Xuan was the person who could take down the legend.

Li Xuan was very serious. Although he gave off an indecent feeling, he was also someone who refused to admit defeat. Even if his opponent was Zhou Wen, he didn’t wish to lose.

In the crazy battle, the Defy Ancient Sovereign gave Zhou Wen endless energy, virtually making him a tireless machine. However, his suppression of Li Xuan continued to decrease.

Li Xuan became more and more familiar with Zhou Wen’s various moves and techniques. Although Zhou Wen was also familiar with him, he lacked the ability to self-repair and become stronger the more injured he was.

Bam!

When the fists met, Zhou Wen’s strength, which could originally suppress Li Xuan, now resulted in Zhou Wen taking two steps back uncontrollably. As for Li Xuan, his body only swayed.

“President has gained the upper hand,” Gulli said.

“From the looks of it, the situation has begun to reverse.” Sadie looked seriously at Li Xuan.

In the beginning, she didn’t have a good impression of Li Xuan. She felt that Li Xuan was a typical foppish scion, but as she constantly interacted with him, Sadie’s impression of him had changed drastically.

At this point, Sadie had no choice but to admit that Li Xuan might be one of the top few people of their generation. Even the strongest Lance in the Ultimate Family Clan might not be able to defeat him.

Outside the six families, more and more young geniuses have appeared. Existences like Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Feng Qiuyan might be existences that can influence the fate of the Federation in the future... I have to work harder...

Sadie carefully watched the battle between the two.

At that instant, Li Xuan switched from defense to offense and launched a barrage of attacks.

Previously, Li Xuan defended more than he attacked, but now, he wasn’t defending at all. He was completely devoted to attacking.

Every part of his body seemed to turn into a lethal weapon. Many of his offensive means were unimaginable to others, but Li Xuan used them without any trouble.

Zhou Wen was finally suppressed. His Strength, Speed, and Constitution began to decline. Although it wasn’t obvious, it was exactly what was happening. As for Li Xuan, he was still growing stronger.

Zhou Wen had many means to turn the situation around, but that required switching to other Essence Energy Arts. Zhou Wen had no intention of doing so. He continued using the Defy Ancient Sovereign to fight Li Xuan.

Bam! Bam!

Zhou Wen’s body began to be struck. This was the first time he had been struck since the beginning of the battle.

Once there was a first, there was a second and third time. Zhou Wen felt the pain from his body, but his mood wasn’t that bad. Instead, he became more and more excited.

That’s it... Deliver something more violent... Zhou Wen felt the power fluctuations of the Defy Ancient Sovereign in his body as he attempted to control and drive the power fluctuations.

Badump! Badump!

Zhou Wen’s heart beat crazily, like a piston that was going all out.

However, this wasn’t enough. Zhou Wen guided the infinite vital essence produced by the Defy Ancient Sovereign to constantly compress the explosive force. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Defy Ancient Sovereign could only produce powerful vitality, but it couldn’t be used in a virtuous cycle. What Zhou Wen needed to do now was mimic Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s circulation chain, constantly compressing and burning his vital force in his body instead of radiating it.

Boom! Boom!

Zhou Wen felt his heart heat up as though it was about to ignite. At the same time, he could sense that the Defy Ancient Sovereign was transforming.

Come on, make the battle crazier. Zhou Wen also abandoned defending and dodging as he brandished his fist to meet Li Xuan’s crazy attacks.
