Chapter 1726 The Path to Immortality Doesn’t Tolerate One Speck of Dust

Zhou Wen and Liu Yun carefully passed through the canyon and finally stood in front of the strange mountain peak.

“Kunlun is indeed a mysterious place. We couldn’t see such a strange and tall mountain even after walking all this distance. We can only see it when standing at the foot of the mountain. If we fly, I’m afraid we will crash into it,” Liu Yun sighed.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly saw the mountain shake.

“Oh no, we’re too late. From the looks of it, the Immortals are already retrieving the sword. What did I say? I told you not to walk around, but you refused to listen. It’s too late for regrets now,” Liu Yun said gloomily.

“I’m afraid the Immortals have yet to retrieve the sword,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at the mountain peak.

“You can see them?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement.

“Even the best eyes can’t see a hundred meters in such a strange place. How can I see it?” Zhou Wen shook his head.

“Then how do you know that the Immortals failed to retrieve the sword?” Liu Yun asked.

“A man’s intuition.” Zhou Wen didn’t explain as he walked up the mountain.

“What are you doing?” Liu Yun hurriedly stopped Zhou Wen. “Teacher told us to retrieve the sword before the Immortals come. Now that the Immortals are already retrieving the sword, aren’t you looking for trouble if you go up now?”

“If Teacher really wanted us to retrieve the sword ahead of time, he wouldn’t have informed us so late. I’m afraid he wanted us to meet the Immortals to begin with,” Zhou Wen said as he walked and stepped onto the mountain.

“Then all the more you shouldn’t head up. Despite knowing that it’s a trap, you are still jumping in?” Although Liu Yun said that, he followed.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s a trap or not. I only want that sword. Go back now. I’ll go up and take a look. If things don’t work out, I’ll naturally leave,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright. With that turtle shell of yours protecting you, you don’t have to worry about not being able to escape.” Liu Yun stopped in his tracks and didn’t follow Zhou Wen up the mountain, but he had no intention of leaving.

Zhou Wen walked towards the mountaintop step by step. Liu Yun had told him not to fly on this mountain unless it was absolutely necessary, nor should he use instant transmission abilities.

Liu Yun didn’t know the consequences of using them. Those words had come from Jing Daoxian.

On the mountaintop, the woman released her grip on the sword hilt and said to Wang Mingyuan, “Draw the sword.”

“Immortal Supremacy, you must be joking. How can I pull out a sword that you can’t?” Wang Mingyuan said calmly.

“I have my reasons. Just draw the sword,” the woman said indifferently.

“Yes, Immortal Supremacy.” Wang Mingyuan didn’t say anything else. He walked to the stone monument and reached out to grab the hilt. He tried his best to pull the sword out, but it remained motionless.

“Even the body of a human can’t pull it out?” The woman frowned slightly.

“I’m no longer human.” Wang Mingyuan released his hand and retreated to the side.

“Indeed. Then let’s find a pure human to give it a try.” As the woman spoke, she turned to leave the mountain, but when she looked down, she saw a figure approaching from halfway up the mountain.

“Who else knows about this place?” the woman turned her head and asked Wang Mingyuan.

“I’ve never told anyone about this place since my discovery. It’s not within my means if others had independently discovered this place.” Wang Mingyuan’s expression remained unchanged. He looked as usual as he continued, “If it’s a human, wouldn’t that be great? Immortal Supremacy, you wouldn’t have to go out to find someone.”

The woman couldn’t tell if Wang Mingyuan was lying, so she didn’t ask further. She turned to look at the figure at the foot of the mountain, hoping to confirm who it was.

On this strange mountain peak, the woman’s gaze was greatly affected. She could only see the outline of a figure from afar.

Zhou Wen’s eyesight clearly wasn’t that strong. He didn’t see the woman’s figure when she saw him. By the time he saw the woman on the mountaintop, she could identify him clearly.

“Wang Mingyuan, don’t tell me that there’s such a coincidence in this world. No one else has discovered the secret of Kunlun Mountain, and it just so happens that you and your disciple discovered the same secret.” The woman’s gaze at Wang Mingyuan had already turned cold.

“There are many coincidences in the world. This isn’t strange. I can swear on my soul that I’ve never told this secret to my disciple.” As Wang Mingyuan spoke, he really began making the oath.

When the woman saw that Wang Mingyuan had really sworn a soul oath, she remained unconvinced. However, it was impossible for there to be no reaction from Wang Mingyuan if he was lying under the soul oath. This meant that he wasn’t lying.

“From the looks of it, it’s really a coincidence,” the woman said as though she was about to turn to look down the mountain. However, before she could turn around, she suddenly waved her hand and slashed at Wang Mingyuan.

This slash was too sudden. Furthermore, the woman’s Nihility Sword Aura was too fast. Before Wang Mingyuan could react, he was beheaded by the Nihility Sword Aura. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When Wang Mingyuan’s head fell from midair, his face was filled with shock and disbelief. It was as though he never expected the woman to kill him. He refused to believe it even in death.

“The path to immortality doesn’t tolerate one speck of dust.” The woman seemed to have done something trivial. She didn’t even look at Wang Mingyuan’s corpse.

It was impossible for anyone to survive under the Nihility Sword Aura unless Wang Mingyuan had the ability to undergo Nirvana Rebirth like a phoenix. Unfortunately, Wang Mingyuan wasn’t a phoenix, nor did he have the ability to revive.

Wang Mingyuan’s corpse and head fell from the mountain. Zhou Wen was originally sizing up the woman when he suddenly saw something rolling down. On careful look, his expression changed drastically.

“Teacher!” Zhou Wen reached out to grab Wang Mingyuan’s body and head. After confirming his death, his expression turned even uglier. This was indeed Wang Mingyuan’s corpse. He was dead.

In an instant, Zhou Wen seemed to make a decision. Unexpectedly, he threw Wang Mingyuan’s corpse away and ran down the mountain.

“The so-called feelings of humans are truly hypocritical.” The woman was first taken aback as a sneer appeared on her lips. She walked down the mountain.

She didn’t walk quickly as though she was taking a stroll, but despite Zhou Wen running at full speed, the distance between them became shorter and shorter.

Just as Zhou Wen reached the mountainside, he heard a cold voice behind him. It sounded like it was coming from behind his neck.

“If you continue running, I’ll chop off your head just like your teacher.”

Zhou Wen’s body instantly froze as he stopped running. He slowly turned around and saw the woman standing less than three meters behind him, staring coldly at him.

“Sister, I don’t think we know each other, right?” Zhou Wen revealed a stiff smile as he looked at the woman.
