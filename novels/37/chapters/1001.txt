Chapter 1002: Subversion

Translator: CKtalon

The spectator stands were dead silent as everyone stared blankly at the battle in the arena.

Perhaps it couldn’t be called a battle. It was like a naughty child challenging a giant. Even if the giant stood there without moving, the naughty child couldn’t injure the giant at all.

Just as Joseph had said, it seemed to be the difference in absolute strength.

“Why... Why is this happening... Why can’t I break it...” Joseph changed his skills in an attempt to break through Zhou Wen’s armor.

However, it was completely useless. No matter what skill he used, it was blocked by the crystal-like armor. It couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.

Joseph’s heart sank to the bottom. He never imagined that he would lose to Zhou Wen, nor did he believe that he, who had a Guardian, couldn’t defeat a human without a contracted Guardian.

However, the truth was right before him. His heart was already palpitating, and his hands were trembling even more because he couldn’t see any hope of victory.

Now, Joseph was already regretting his decision to challenge Zhou Wen. Why did this darn Zhou Wen have so many terrifying Companion Beasts?

“Even if I kill you, you won’t be able to kill me. From the looks of it, there’s no need to continue fighting. This battle is a draw,” said Joseph as he suddenly retreated. He still wanted to preserve his final dignity.

However, his words made even the locals who had supported him find it unacceptable. All of them felt their faces burn.

“A loss is a loss. What do you mean by a draw? Can’t you act like a man?” a hot-tempered man in the stands shouted.

This was also what many people thought. They felt that Joseph should fight to the end. Even if he lost, it wouldn’t be as embarrassing as now.

Zhou Wen looked at Joseph without any expression. All he did was slowly dispel the Shell Dragon Armor and Bronze Sparrow Sword. He held the Bamboo Blade and said, “I won’t use any Companion Beasts. I’ll only use this Essence Gold Bamboo Blade to fight you. Do you dare fight?”

Instantly, the entire arena fell silent. Everyone suspected that there was something wrong with their ears or that Zhou Wen had gone mad.

The highest level humans could reach was the Epic stage. If they didn’t use Mythical Companion Beasts, they had no right to fight Guardians.

They admitted that Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts were very strong. They were practically invincible. Without using Tyrant Behemoth, he had completely suppressed Joseph, who had a Guardian.

However, this didn’t mean that they believed that Zhou Wen was qualified to fight Joseph without a Companion Beast.

“Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with his brain?” Li Benyu was also stunned. He was originally rejoicing over Zhou Wen’s victory, but, to his surprise, Zhou Wen had said such crazy words.

Lance also stared at Zhou Wen with a burning gaze. He knew what Zhou Wen wanted to do because he had done the same thing, but he had failed.

“Of course he’s not crazy. He just wants to prove that a Guardian is nothing impressive. We humans can defeat a Guardian with our own strength,” Sadie said with a complicated expression. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Although this sounded terrifying, Sadie didn’t find it strange that Zhou Wen was capable of completing such a feat.

“But... Can humans really defeat Guardians?” Li Benyu couldn’t believe it.

Li Benyi also couldn’t believe it. He muttered to himself, “Using a human’s body to defeat a Guardian? Is that possible?”

Apart from Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ya’er, no one in Frost City believed that Zhou Wen could do it.

Humans maxed out at the Epic stage. There was a huge gap between them and the Mythical stage. As for Guardians, they were the best amongst those at the Mythical stage. The difference between them was just too great. The gap was so wide that no one could see hope.

“Is he crazy? Without using a Companion Beast, he’s only at the Epic stage. What right does he have to fight the Guardian?”

“Victory blinds one.”

“I think victory makes people crazy.”

When the people in the stands snapped to their senses, they began discussing spiritedly. Clearly, they also felt that Zhou Wen had been blinded by victory.

“Are you really not going to use a Companion Beast to fight me?” Joseph looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that a person like Zhou Wen would make such a foolish decision.

“If I use a Companion Beast, even if it’s only at the Legendary stage, it will be considered my loss.” Zhou Wen immediately added, “However, I have a condition.”

“What condition?” Joseph found it normal. There was no reason for Zhou Wen to be such an idiot.

“Even if I lose using a Companion Beast, this battle can’t end before I admit defeat. Do you dare accept the challenge?” Zhou Wen had been observing the powers of Lie.

It was indeed a very strong Guardian. Although it wasn’t the kind with absolute strength, his abilities were unique.

Zhou Wen was confident that he could defeat Joseph, who had Lie, but he wasn’t completely confident that he could completely destroy Lie before Joseph admitted defeat.

Therefore, Zhou Wen had to force Joseph not to admit defeat. He had to fight him to the end.

Everyone looked at Zhou Wen in shock, believing that he had definitely gone mad. How was this a condition? It was as though he had personally delivered himself to the gallows.

Joseph stared at Zhou Wen with bloodshot eyes. He felt like he had been greatly insulted.

“There’s no need to beat around the bush. Aren’t you just trying to say that we won’t rest until one of us dies? I’ll fulfill your wish. We won’t rest until one of us dies. However, if you use a Companion Beast, it will be your loss. I want you to commit suicide.” Joseph’s eyes were red as his face couldn’t help but grimace. His voice was filled with ruthlessness.

“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.

“Everyone, you heard that, right? As a member of the Ultimate Family Clan, you can guarantee me fair treatment, right?” Joseph looked at the VIP stands in the arena and said.

There, the upper echelons of the Ultimate Family Clan were watching the battle.

“No one can violate the agreement here,” an elder said calmly as he walked to the stands.

Joseph was delighted when he saw the elder. He bowed respectfully before turning to Zhou Wen with a ferocious expression. “Zhou Wen, I’ll gladly accept your life.”

With that said, the Lie Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog that charged at Zhou Wen with terrifying power.

Zhou Wen had already analyzed the various abilities of Lie back when Joseph attacked. He already had an idea of its strength.

He held the Bamboo Blade, but he didn’t pull it out of its scabbard. As though riding the wind and smoke like an immortal, he dodged Joseph’s strange attacks.

Everyone saw that Zhou Wen really didn’t use a Companion Beast and relied solely on his strength to fight Joseph. Furthermore, Joseph didn’t have the absolute advantage.

Zhou Wen’s elegant movement technique that resembled a transcendent flying immortal was deeply imprinted in many people’s minds.

“Can humans... really compete with Guardians?” The people who rejected the notion previously had their beliefs shaken.

That elegant figure was subverting their long-established beliefs.
