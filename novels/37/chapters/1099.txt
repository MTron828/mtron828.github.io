Chapter 1100: Sealing Companion Beasts

Translator: CKtalon

When the blood landed in the air, it turned into specks of sanguine light that dissipated. The blood could no longer be seen with the naked eye, but the entire arena seemed to be covered in a faint sanguine light.

Zhou Wen extended his palm and a red glow appeared on the blue crystal bracer. It was faint and inconspicuous.

After summoning Night Immaculate Sword, he realized that his mental connection with it had weakened significantly. This made Zhou Wen understand that Blood Shaman’s blood sacrifice technique was the power to seal Companion Beasts.

Even on his ear, Truth Listener’s connection with Zhou Wen weakened significantly. From the looks of it, Evil Nullification couldn’t restrain this sealing power.

The Heaven-Opening Scripture had long been engraved, but it didn’t appear to be of much use.

Even the Heaven-Opening Scripture and Evil Nullification can’t restrain it. It’s neither a taboo rule nor a curse. What kind of power is this? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he didn’t stop. He planned on summoning the Companion Beasts that had previously fought.

Everyone watched excitedly as Companion Beasts appeared, believing that they could see another grand battle of Companion Beasts.

However, Zhou Wen had only summoned a few Companion Beasts without even summoning all six Demon Blood True Dragons before he saw a sanguine glow emit from the Blood Shaman’s eyes, turning the entire arena red.

The Companion Beasts that Zhou Wen had summoned suddenly flew back to him and returned to their tattoo form. Truth Listener was no exception.

“What happened? Why did he unsummon his Companion Beasts?”

“It doesn’t look like it was done of his own accord. It seems to have been sent back by the power of Blood Shaman.”

“Don’t tell me the power of Blood Shaman prevents people from summoning Companion Beasts? If that’s the case, Human will be in danger.”

“It looks like it. That beautiful fairy-like Companion Beast didn’t appear either.”

“Even a Terror-grade Companion Beast can be sealed? Isn’t that too much of a sham? Without a Companion Beast, how can we humans fight?”

“Blood Shaman’s ability is basically targeted at us humans. In front of him, all humans will be unable to withstand a single blow. It’s really terrifying.”

“If he can’t use Companion Beasts, will Human still have a chance of defeating Blood Shaman?”

“I’m afraid it will be very difficult. Unless he has the same combat ability as Ya.”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. Zhou Wen also attempted to summon Banana Fairy, but unfortunately, she was also sealed by Blood Shaman’s power and couldn’t be summoned.

The power of Blood Shaman is definitely a great enemy of humanity, Zhou Wen thought as he looked at Blood Shaman.

However, Zhou Wen also realized that Blood Shaman’s power wasn’t only targeted at him. Even he couldn’t summon his Companion Beasts, nor did he have any equipment transformed from them. Clearly, even he was limited by this power and couldn’t use Companion Beasts either.

Blood Shaman stood in the blood-colored light. The armor on his body emitted a strong bloody smell like a bloodthirsty god.

“Forget your futile attempts. In the blood sacrifice ritual, no Companion Beast can be summoned. Even I can’t.” Blood Shaman looked at Zhou Wen and continued, “There’s still time to withdraw.”

With Blood Shaman admitting it personally, everyone knew that their previous guess was right. Blood Shaman’s ability was simply the natural enemy of humans.

“There’s actually such power. Isn’t this too ridiculous? With such power, how can humans live in the future?”

“Such power is too unfair to humans.”

“Child, you are still too naive. There’s nothing fair in this world.”

“Human’s really in danger this time. He can’t use Companion Beasts. His combat strength has been greatly weakened.”

Zhou Wen looked at Blood Shaman and said calmly, “I’ll naturally withdraw when I’m about to die.”

Blood Shaman didn’t say anything else. However, the sanguine light on his body became stronger and stronger. It turned into blood-colored flames that enveloped his entire body like a blood shadow.

Terror-grade?

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised when he saw the change in Blood Shaman’s strength.

He wasn’t surprised that Blood Shaman was at the Terror grade. It would be strange if it wasn’t at the Terror grade if he could seal even Banana Fairy.

To his surprise, although Blood Shaman had turned into his Terror form, his body didn’t completely disappear. The average person could still see his figure.

Only some special Terror transformations would have such an effect. For example, the gigantification of Jade Rabbit.

“This is your last chance to live. If I attack, I won’t show any mercy.” Blood Shaman floated in the air like a divine blood shadow, illuminating the entire arena with blood-red light.

Wang Lu held her hands together in worry. Although Zhou Wen was very strong, how could he fight the Terror-grade Blood Shaman without the help of his Companion Beasts?

Others believed that Zhou Wen was a human who had fused with a Guardian, but Wang Lu and company knew very well that Zhou Wen hadn’t fused with a Guardian.

When they had parted, Zhou Wen was only at the Epic stage.

Although they didn’t know what method Zhou Wen had used to get on the rankings, it was already impressive that he had advanced to the Mythical stage. It was impossible for him to advance to the Terror grade in such a short period of time.

Many of the spectators were equally worried.

“Since you are standing here, you are an enemy. Why are we talking about mercy?” Zhou Wen said indifferently. He was determined to defeat all humans with Guardians. Unless he was at his wits’ end, he definitely wouldn’t give up easily.

“That’s right. I was wrong.” With that said, the anthropomorphic blood shadow charged at Zhou Wen and slashed down like a blade.

His speed was so fast that ordinary humans couldn’t keep up with him. Even though he didn’t disappear after his Terror transformation, ordinary people couldn’t see his actions.

However, Zhou Wen could clearly see that although Blood Shaman was very fast, it wasn’t much faster than a top Mythical creature. Its speed couldn’t even compare to some top Speed-type Mythical creatures.

Zhou Wen knew that this meant that Blood Shaman’s stats weren’t very high. Perhaps, just like Banana Fairy, he had just slightly exceeded 82, so he wasn’t at a disadvantage in terms of stats.

His Speed attribute had already broken past 70.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t underestimate Blood Shaman because of this. The other party’s Terror form definitely had its benefits. Although their stats were similar, he couldn’t treat him as a Mythical creature.

With a wave of his hand, a white wooden club appeared in his hand.

This wooden club wasn’t transformed from a Companion Beast. It was something Zhou Wen had picked up from the mountain god who had sacrificed the white deer and condensed the Blood Oxypetalum.

Apart from the white wooden club, there was also a metal disc that resembled a gong.

There was no way to use a Companion Beast now, and Bamboo Blade was too eye-catching. Others would recognize him at a glance, so he had no choice but to use these.

After condensing his forces, Zhou Wen used the white wooden club as a sword and charged at Blood Shaman with an intense sword aura. He wanted to see how strong a Terror-grade creature like Blood Shaman was.

Dressed in Absolute Defense armor, Zhou Wen didn’t need to worry that Blood Shaman could instantly kill him.
