Chapter 190 Crystal Purchase

“Sis Lan, can you give me the information about the Holy Land?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Since he didn’t wish to owe the An family any favors, he was prepared to make a trip to the Holy Land regardless of An Jing’s motives as payment.

“You really don’t have to force yourself. It’s fine if you don’t go,” Ouyang Lan said.

“I wish to take a look,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright then. I’ll send you the information on the Holy Land.” Ouyang Lan paused before continuing, “Look through the information first. If you aren’t confident, don’t go. If anything happens to you, I won’t be able to answer Lingfeng.”

“Alright, Sis Lan, send me the information first,” Zhou Wen said vaguely.

Ouyang Lan sent the information of the Holy Land to Zhou Wen. Only after seeing it did he realize that the Holy Land was actually a large dimensional zone.

Unlike ordinary dimensional zones, there were extremely powerful creatures in it. These creatures were actually willing to give human special bloodlines to change their physiques.

However, powerful creatures would not casually bestow human bloodlines. They had to pass their tests to obtain their bloodlines.

Currently, the known bloodlines were those of the six heroes. Previously, John’s Holy Emperor Body was one of them. However, the bloodline John had inherited naturally couldn’t be compared to the first generation’s Holy Emperor Body.

Zhou Wen had seen the Holy Emperor Body before. The other five types of physiques were all unique. The most detailed description was a body known as the Sun God Body. It was an extremely masculine type that needed one to cultivate an extreme Yang-elemental Primordial Energy Art to pass the test.

Without a doubt, the Sun Strafe Art was prepared for the Sun God Body, but unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t cultivate the Sun Strafe Art. It was hard to tell if he could obtain the Sun God Body when the time came.

“Sis Lan, I’ve already thought about it. I want to go to the Holy Land.” Zhou Wen felt that there was no harm in making a trip there. He could return the favor he owed An Jing and also attempt to download the Holy Land into his phone.

If possible, he might be able to use the Lost Immortal Sutra to obtain many special physiques in the Holy Land.

“I thought about it carefully and felt that it was best if you don’t go,” Ouyang Lan suddenly said.

“Why?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

Ouyang Lan said with a wry smile, “Back when Tianzuo was young, he went once. However, no one received any special physiques during the trip.”

“Why?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled.

“Ahem. When he went there, there was some unhappiness between him and the other youths who went. It devolved into an armed melee. That’s why the other contestants from other families were rather unfriendly to our An family. If you represent the An family, they will target you. It will be very troublesome when the time comes, so it’s best you don’t go,” Ouyang Lan said.

“Those that can enter the Holy Land are at most at the Legendary stage, right?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, the Holy Land has restrictions. One cannot enter if they surpass the Legendary stage,” Ouyang Lan said.

“I’ll go,” Zhou Wen said through gritted teeth. Perhaps it was as An Jing had said. There would be many elites waiting to teach him a lesson, but since he had agreed to return the favor, there was no reason for him to shrink back now.

Ouyang Lan added some things to take note of and got Zhou Wen to be careful. Having a chance to obtain a special physique was the best, but it didn’t matter if he didn’t get it. Safety was the priority.

Why are the mother’s and daughter’s temperament so different? If it wasn’t for the fact that An Jing had a unique appearance like Ouyang Lan, Zhou Wen really would suspect that An Jing wasn’t Ouyang Lan’s biological daughter.

Although Zhou Wen had decided on heading to the Holy Land, he had to raise his speed to 21 points first. He could head there after refining the Mutated Fairy Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.

It’s definitely too late to kill the tiger now. Ignoring the fact that there aren’t any tigers in Binyang Cave, even if there are, killing it might not necessarily result in a Speed Crystal. After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there was only one path he could take. He had to buy a 21-valued Speed Crystal from a crystal shop.

Epic grade crystals weren’t cheap. Fortunately, a 21-valued Speed Crystal was considered one of the lowest grade crystals at the Epic stage, so the price wasn’t too ridiculous.

However, even so, the price wasn’t something an ordinary person could accept. If it wasn’t for the urgency of the matter, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have chosen to spend money to buy it. After all, he lacked money.

Zhou Wen requested Ah Sheng’s help to settle the administrative procedures for his suspension at school. Since he was going to the Holy Land tomorrow, he definitely wouldn’t be able to return in half a month. A day or two didn’t matter.

He got Ah Sheng to drive him to the Xiyuan Crystal Shop. This time, there were many customers there, unlike the last time, when it was only Zhou Wen and Ouyang Lan.

When he passed by the code lockers, Zhou Wen took another look and couldn’t help but recall the numbers on the name card.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t know what those numbers meant and wasn’t sure if it was the passcode for a locker.

“Young Master Wen, what kind of stat crystal do you want to buy?” Ah Sheng asked when he saw Zhou Wen walk to the crystal cabinet.

“I want to buy an Epic Speed Crystal. Just 21 points would do,” Zhou Wen said.

“Young Master Wen, you haven’t advanced to the Epic stage yet. It’s too dangerous to absorb an Epic stage crystal right now. If you need higher valued Legendary crystals, I can prepare them for you,” Ah Sheng said.

“There’s no need.” Zhou Wen shook his head in rejection. The crystals Ah Sheng had brought were naturally given to him by the An family.

“Ah Sheng, what brings you here today?” Zhou Wen was looking at the crystal when he suddenly heard an elder’s voice. He turned his head and saw that the person speaking was an old man with a sickly look.

“Old Master Qin, I’m here to accompany Young Master Wen to buy crystals,” Ah Wen replied respectfully.

Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the sickly old man in front of him was likely the owner of Xiyuan Crystal Shop, Qin Xiyuan.

Qin Xiyuan appeared somewhat surprised as he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Lad, you’re Zhou Wen?”

“Old Master Qin, you know me?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

Qin Xiyuan said with a smile, “Of course I know. There’s probably no one in Luoyang City who doesn’t know about Little Lan’s marriage with your father.”

With that said, Qin Xiyuan pulled Zhou Wen’s hand and walked him deeper into the store. As he walked, he said, “The things outside are just to fool ordinary people. You are one of Little Lan’s. Come to my treasury and take a look.”

“Old Master, I just want to buy an Epic Speed Crystal. Just an ordinary one would do,” Zhou Wen said.

“It doesn’t matter if you are buying. Take a look first,” Qin Xiyuan said with a chuckle as he pulled Zhou Wen into the elevator.

Qin Xiyuan led him straight to the fourth floor. After exiting the elevator, he said to Ah Sheng, “Ah Sheng, stay here and watch. Don’t let anyone disturb us.”
