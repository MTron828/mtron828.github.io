Chapter 844: Ba

The creature looked very strange. Its lower body was like a snake, but it was also like a fish. Its upper body had two dragon claws, and its head resembled a dragon, but it didn’t have horns. It was a very strange creature.

It lay silently in the grave. For some reason, Tyrant Behemoth stood outside the pit and stared at it as though it was possessed. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he summoned the Golden Battle God Halberd to attack the monster in the grave.

However, when the Golden Battle God Halberd approached the grave, it lost control and landed beside the pit.

Zhou Wen hurriedly sent a few Companion Beasts over, but the outcome was the same. As long as they approached the grave, they would stand there motionless as though they had been possessed.

Be it animals or weapons, all Companion Beasts shared the same fate.

The dimensional creatures in this Fiend Tomb are really strange. First, it’s the Ghoul Mask, and now, it’s such a monster. Their abilities are so strange. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned Truth Listener to the graveside.

However, Truth Listener didn’t stand there in a daze. It broke two earrings and, after descending, grabbed the monster with its claws, tearing it into two.

By the time the monster wanted to resist, it was already too late. It died an unnatural death, and only then did Tyrant Behemoth and the other Companion Beasts regain their lucidity.

Thankfully, I have enough Companion Beasts that have well-rounded abilities. Otherwise, I really wouldn’t be able to do anything to this Fiend Tomb, Zhou Wen thought.

‘Killed Mythical creature, Ghost Hornless.’ A game notification popped up.

It’s another Mythical creature. What’s hidden underneath? Could it really be Ba? Zhou Wen wondered how powerful Ba would be if it was really Ba.

After eliminating Ghost Hornless, Zhou Wen ordered Tyrant Behemoth to continue digging. He wanted to see if there was a Ba in the Fiend Tomb.

Tyrant Behemoth received the order and continued digging. Not long after, the Fiend Stones below emitted a scorching aura. The deeper it went, the hotter the Fiend Stones became. Towards the end, the Fiend Stones turned into magma.

Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t afraid of the magma as it sucked the magma into its stomach. As the magma vanished, something gradually revealed itself.

Zhou Wen finally saw something that wasn’t a Fiend Stone. It was a type of black metal that had been forged into the shape of a bed. There was a canopy on the bed with a transparent curtain hanging down.

The magma formed by the Fiend Stones was blocked by the veil, preventing it from entering the bed.

And on the bed, there was a stunning woman sleeping. Just sleeping there with her eyes closed she was beautiful beyond description. It was difficult to imagine how beautiful she would be if she opened her eyes.

The woman was dressed in red, making her figure look enchanting and charming. Even though the game’s style was cartoonish, it was already very provocative.

If it was in reality, he wondered how sexy and alluring she would be.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to admire her beauty. His expression was still solemn because he felt a familiar aura from this woman.

That aura wasn’t from a dimensional creature, but the aura of a Guardian.

However, typical Guardians were in cocoons, but this woman was sleeping on the bed. This only meant one thing; she had long broken out of the cocoon.

According to what Zhou Wen knew, it wasn’t possible for a Guardian to break out of the cocoon just because they were strong enough. Unless someone forcefully broke the cocoon of the Guardian, or someone contracted them, the Guardian couldn’t break out no matter how strong they were.

Now that this woman wasn’t in the cocoon, it could only mean that she had already contracted a human, or that someone had forcefully torn open the cocoon.

The Zhang family has protected the Fiend Tomb for so long it’s unlikely that someone else dug up the Fiend Tomb and contracted the Guardian. Then, there are only two possibilities. One is that the Zhang family has someone who contracted the Guardian. Another possibility is that this woman is the same as the fellow in the log. She’s one of the surviving Guardians from a previous era, Zhou Wen thought as the woman on the bed suddenly opened her eyes.

It wasn’t as beautiful as Zhou Wen imagined. It was a pair of eyes that were as red as fire. Although they didn’t look ugly, they were terrifying. There wasn’t a hint of feminine charm in them.

Her red eyes stared coldly at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at a thief who dared disturb her dreams.

Zhou Wen’s heart chilled as he broke out into a cold sweat. A sense of danger arose spontaneously.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen recalled that he was still wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Yet, she could actually see him. Didn’t that mean that the Invisibility Cloak was ineffective against her?

Zhou Wen chose to strike first to gain the upper hand. Tyrant Behemoth roared and charged at the woman on the bed. After it expanded, a fist that was bigger than the bed slammed down violently in a bid to smash the bed and the woman to pieces.

However, before Tyrant Behemoth’s fist landed, the woman on the bed had already sat up and lifted the transparent veil over the bed.

At the instant the veil was lifted, terrifying flames instantly filled the entire world. Zhou Wen failed to react in time and only saw flames fill the screen before the blood-colored avatar died.

What the hell is this? A full-screen instant kill? Zhou Wen launched the game dungeon and wanted to reenter the Fiend Tomb to take a look, but the program icon of the Fiend Tomb dimmed. There was no reaction from tapping it. There was a 24-hour countdown below. The meaning was obvious. He needed 24 hours to enter the Fiend Tomb dungeon again.

Zhou Wen felt somewhat unsatisfied. It wasn’t easy for him to find another Guardian. This might be the opportunity for Slaughterer to advance to a Perfect Body.

I have Banana Fairy, so I might be able to restrain the Guardian’s flames. There’s still a chance of killing her. Zhou Wen thought again. There’s actually a Guardian in the Fiend Tomb. In that case, the Ba that the Zhang family mentioned is actually a Guardian?

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible. When he connected the origins of Ba, Zhou Wen increasingly felt that she might be the surviving Guardian of the last Guardian battle.

Now, Zhou Wen was beginning to suspect that the battle between Yellow Emperor and Chiyou might have been a battle between Guardians. There must have been many Guardians involved.

The former principal went missing after studying the Zhuolu battlefield. The things he left behind seem to be related to the Zhuolu battle. Could it be that the things the former principal left behind really give people a chance to defeat the Guardians? Zhou Wen thought about the connection.

He first went to grind other dungeons. After a painful wait of twenty-four hours, Zhou Wen entered the Fiend Tomb dungeon again. By then, the Fiend Tomb had returned to its original state.

Zhou Wen ordered Tyrant Behemoth to dig up the Fiend Tomb before drawing out the Ghoul Mask. He held the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed at the face in the Fiend Tomb.

However, just as the blood-colored avatar arrived in front of the Fiend Tomb, it collapsed and died on the spot.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback as the game screen went black. It would take another twenty-four hours to enter the Fiend Tomb.

What the hell? Do I have to wait 24 hours after a single death? Isn’t this dungeon too odd? Zhou Wen was extremely helpless.
