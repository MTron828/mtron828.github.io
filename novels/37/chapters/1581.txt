Chapter 1582: Connate Appropriation

Translator: CKtalon

The Holy Land could tolerate a human with a powerful Companion Beast, but it couldn’t tolerate the existence of a person who was powerful enough to threaten the Holy Land.

Godsfall secretly rejoiced. Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s cultivation hasn’t reached an uncontrollable level. There’s still a chance of destroying him before he attains his full potential.

Godsfall was already secretly searching for a suitable opportunity to attack.

However, before killing Zhou Wen, Godsfall wanted to snatch his Companion Beast. From his point of view, there was no conflict between the two matters.

Zhou Wen’s main combat strength stemmed from his Companion Beast. As long as it was snatched from him, Zhou Wen would suffer a drop in strength. Killing him wouldn’t be difficult since it was useless having only a potent realm.

Godsfall no longer had the mood to watch the show. Instead, he stared intently at Zhou Wen, searching for the best opportunity to attack.

Now that Zhou Wen hadn’t summoned his Companion Beast and had suppressed his strength to the Epic stage, it could be said that this was the best opportunity for Godsfall. It was a god-sent opportunity.

Godsfall was the Connate Holy Temple’s Holy Son. The Essence Energy Art he cultivated was the same as Li Xuan’s Invincible Connate Divine Art.

However, Li Xuan cultivated an incomplete version, and not only did Godsfall cultivate the complete version, but it was also a modified version that had been supplemented by past Saints.

Unlike Jiuyang, Godsfall didn’t choose to contract a Guardian. Instead, he chose the path of Spirit Casting and devoured the Connate Ancient God Guardian.

Coupled with the Connate Holy Temple sparing no expense to groom him, Godsfall had reached the Hell level like Jiuyang thanks to the massive amount of resources.

Furthermore, the abilities that Godsfall was good at were different from the typical Connate Holy Temple Saint. His Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, Terror transformation, and Calamity Zone were different from Li Xuan’s.

Li Xuan became stronger from being beaten up, but Godsfall could directly plunder the growth of others. It could be said that the two of them were at two extremities with some similarities.

The Calamity Zone of Godsfall was called “Connate Return” and was also called “Connate Appropriation.”

In his domain, he could appropriate the other party of everything other than their Connate body.

A Connate Body referred to one’s body of flesh and blood. Clothes, weapons, and accessories could be appropriated as long as they were external.

Companion Beasts were also foreign objects. Godsfall could also appropriate them.

However, Connate Appropriation wasn’t without restrictions. If Godsfall wanted to strip something, he had to come into contact with it. Furthermore, it needed to be used on living creatures.

Of course, the appropriation of a Companion Beast had to be done when Zhou Wen was alive. Once Zhou Wen died, the Companion Beast would transform into Essence Energy and dissipate back into the universe. Then there would be nothing to appropriate.

Under normal circumstances, as long as the enemy summoned a Companion Beast, Godsfall could snatch it for his own use.

However, Zhou Wen’s Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was somewhat powerful. Godsfall didn’t wish for Zhou Wen to have a chance to resist, so he decided to attack Zhou Wen himself.

As long as he touched the Companion Beast tattoo—even if it was invisible—he could successfully appropriate it.

Therefore, what Godsfall needed to do was actually determine where the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was located on Zhou Wen.

This wasn’t difficult to determine. There was a general rule. For example, armor-type Companion Beasts were usually tattooed on one’s chest or back.

Weapon-type Companion Beasts were typically on one’s palms or arms.

Godsfall didn’t know what the Tiger Soul General’s companion form was, but from the looks of it, it was highly likely that it was similar to armor. Even if it wasn’t, such a Companion Beast was most likely on the chest or back. These were also the targets Godsfall chose.

As long as I snatch his Tiger Soul General, it will be easy for Jiuyang and me to kill him, Godsfall had already made up his mind. He was just waiting for an opportunity to succeed in one strike.

In order to increase his success rate, Godsfall planned on touching Zhou Wen’s body as much as possible. It wouldn’t be a problem to appropriate more Companion Beasts. Regardless, he couldn’t miss the Tiger Soul General. Otherwise, it would be troublesome once Zhou Wen summoned it.

Godsfall didn’t know that even if Zhou Wen were to summon the Tiger Soul General, it wouldn’t be as powerful as he had seen on the Cube.

There was no heat here at all. The Tiger Soul General had no way of accumulating the demonic flames in his body, nor did he have the time to temper his body. His level was only at the Human Realm, so he was basically no threat to Godsfall and Jiuyang.

Godsfall didn’t know this, so he was determined to obtain the Tiger Soul General. Godsfall even wanted to use the Tiger Soul General to kill Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen, oh Zhou Wen, blame it on yourself for becoming enemies with the Holy Land and and on your overestimation of your abilities. Godsfall took the opportunity to instantly appear behind Zhou Wen.

Godsfall was good at the Connate Breath technique. In the senses of others, Godsfall was no different from a rock on the ground. If one didn’t see him with their own eyes, it would be difficult to discover his existence.

Despite being extremely careful, Zhou Wen failed to discover him.

At the instant Godsfall approached, he clung his entire body to Zhou Wen’s back. His hands wrapped around him and pressed down on Zhou Wen’s chest.

The Connate Appropriation took effect. The clothes covering the area vanished just before Godsfall touched Zhou Wen’s body.

Bang!

Zhou Wen’s reaction was extremely fast. In an instant, the Chaos Egg had already burgeoned from his body and sent Godsfall flying.

Godsfall’s figure spun in midair and landed on the ground like a ghost. He licked his lips and stared smilingly at Zhou Wen with his slender eyes.

“Egg Sovereign! So Zhou Wen is Egg Sovereign!” Youkai shouted when he saw the Chaos Egg over Zhou Wen’s body.

Carlos was first slightly taken aback and then enlightened before he said, “I see. It’s no wonder Jiuyang challenged Zhou Wen to a duel. I should have known.”

In fact, it couldn’t be blamed on Carlos. It was mainly because the Tiger Soul General’s performance was too domineering, No one believed that Zhou Wen could obtain its Companion Egg from killing the corresponding dimensional creature. Previously, the main speculation by people was that Egg,

Sovereign was Human Sovereign. They didn’t think of Zhou Wen.

Their guess wasn’t wrong, but no one expected Human Sovereign to be Zhou Wen.

“Inever expected the Holy Land to think highly of me. They even laid an ambush with a Saint here to wait for me,” Zhou Wen said with a frown. He had already vaguely sensed that something was amiss with his Companion Beasts.

“Godsfall, why are you here?” Jiuyang also frowned and asked Godsfall. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“To help you complete the mission,” Godsfall said indifferently.

“This is my business. I don’t need you,” Jiuyang said coldly.

“This is an order from Lord Holy God.” With that said, Godsfall ignored Jiuyang and looked at Zhou Wen with a smile. “Zhou Wen, it’s our first time meeting. My name is Godsfall, a Saint from the Connate Holy Temple. Don’t forget my name in what’s left of your short life..”
