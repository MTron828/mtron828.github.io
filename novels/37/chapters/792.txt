Chapter 793: Dragon King Gu

Translator: CKtalon

Gu Shanshui’s fears came to live. The huge shadow slowly rose from the bottom of the river.

Due to its arrival, the Gu that were crowding around the wooden boat scrambled to escape and quickly disappeared. The originally calm river surface also had burgeoning layers of waves appear.

With such obvious signs, Li Mobai, Gu Shanshui, and company clearly realized the seriousness of the problem. They stared at the river with heavy expressions.

Splash!

A huge wave pushed the wooden boat to the side. If Gu Shanshui hadn’t tried his best to control it, the wooden boat would have capsized.

Li Mobai, Butterfly, and company used their Companion Beasts to block the river water that splashed into the wooden boat. They ensured that the people on the wooden boat wouldn’t be drenched by the river water or have the river water fill the boat.

But soon, everyone’s eyes were attracted by the scene in front of them. They saw a huge body extend out of the river, staring at them like a god. In front of it, the humans and even the wooden boat were as tiny as ants.

Although most of its body was still in the river, preventing one from seeing its full appearance, just the exposed parts were shocking enough.

It was a dragon, but it wasn’t completely one. It had the appearance of a dragon, but its body wasn’t made of flesh and blood. It didn’t have dragon scales or flesh. It looked like a dragon condensed from coral, making it dazzling and strange.

Zhou Wen had seen many dragons—the white dragon in Old Dragon Cave, the black dragon in the underground sea, Torch Dragon in Torch Dragon temple, and even the western dragons.

However, no dragon could be as strange and beautiful as the dragon in front of him.

The coral-like body’s colors changed according to its emotions. It was sometimes as white as jade, sometimes as red as blood, and sometimes rainbow-colored. It was like a huge piece of art.

“Could... Could this be the legendary Dragon King Gu... Heavens... There’s no dragon corpse in the Dragon Corpse River... There’s actually a Dragon King Gu...” Gu Shanshui’s eyes widened as he stared at the gorgeous and terrifying creature in front of him and cried out involuntarily.

Gu Lou and Gu He were even worse off. They collapsed on the boat and even prostrated themselves before the Dragon King Gu.

A person like Zhou Wen who didn’t rear Gu might not understand what the Dragon King Gu meant to people who reared them, but Gu Shanshui and company had already lost their fighting spirit from fear. They were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

Legend had it that phoenixes were the nemesis of Gu, while dragons produced all the Gu in the world. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Some regions treated dragons as gods. If humans angered the gods, they would mete down punishment with diseases, plagues, and other disasters.

These disasters were actually caused by Gu, and Gu were living beings that parasitized the Dragon God. They would punish humans who did wrong in the Dragon God’s stead.

From the point of view of modern humans, Gu were parasites on the Dragon God.

Of course, this was only a legend in a certain region. It was unknown if it was true.

However, in the legends of these regions, if the parasites on the Dragon God’s body were extremely powerful, they could turn the situation around, transforming the Dragon God into Gu, then it would form the legendary King of Gu, Dragon King Gu.

This was actually just a local legend. No one had seen a Dragon King Gu before. Even in this era, no one believed that the Gu could really turn the situation and transform the Dragon God into a Gu.

However, this lifeform in front of them undoubtedly possessed the characteristics of dragons and Gu.

It looked like a divine dragon and had a terrifying dragon might, but its body was similar to the structure of coral.

As for the coral itself, it was condensed from many coral worms. The creature in front of them could also be seen as a fusion of countless Gu.

These characteristics were extremely similar to the legendary Dragon King Gu.

Furthermore, ever since this creature, suspected to be the Dragon King Gu, appeared, the Gu on Gu Shanshui, Gu Lou, and Gu He’s bodies began trembling. They could no longer move. It was even more terrifying than the chick’s suppression.

To people who raised Gu, this was undoubtedly fatal.

The chick stood at the bow and chirped at the Dragon King Gu. It looked extremely ferocious, but Zhou Wen, who knew the chick very well, could tell that it was lacking confidence.

Otherwise, with the chick’s personality, it would have spat out phoenix flames and burned the creature in front of it.

The Dragon King Gu stared coldly at the chick and Zhou Wen. It clearly wasn’t as afraid of the chick as the other Gu. It didn’t even treat the chick as a threat.

Although the chick had the phoenix bloodline, it had yet to fully mature. It could restrain ordinary Gu, but an existence like the Dragon King Gu was not something the chick could match.

Zhou Wen noticed that the Dragon King Gu’s gaze was constantly staring at the calabash containing the Corpse Bug. Clearly, it had been attracted by the Corpse Bug.

Gu Shanshui picked up the calabash with trembling hands and offered it to the Dragon King Gu. As a person who nurtured Gu, no one dared to resist the Dragon King Gu because it was the supreme god in his heart.

With a flash, Zhou Wen arrived at the bow and took the calabash from Gu Shanshui. He held it in his hand and looked at the Dragon King Gu.

As he was not a Gu-rearing professional, he did not fear the Dragon King Gu. Furthermore, even if he handed over the Corpse Bug in the calabash, the Dragon King Gu might not let them off.

Roar! The Dragon King Gu seemed to be infuriated by Zhou Wen’s actions as it let out a strange roar.

Unlike the dragon’s roar that Zhou Wen had heard before, the Dragon King Gu’s voice was very strange. It had a strange resonance.

Amidst the roar of the Dragon King Gu, Gu Shanshui and company revealed looks of pain. They wrapped their heads with their hands as though bugs were biting at their brains.

Zhou Wen also felt as though an extremely tiny creature had drilled into his ears and was about to invade his brain.

“This is a Sound Gu that uses sound... Quickly block your ears... Don’t listen to that sound...” Gu Shanshui shouted in pain.

In fact, under the effects of Truth Listener and Supreme Hell King Life Soul, Zhou Wen had already discovered the Sound Gu hidden in the sound waves. He used the Supreme Hell King Life Soul’s control over his body to seal his hearing and bar the Sound Gu from entry.

“I know you can understand me. Let us leave the Dragon Corpse River and we’ll return the Corpse Bug inside to you. If one of us dies, I’ll reduce it to ashes,” Zhou Wen said to the Dragon King Gu as he raised the calabash in his hand.

The Dragon King Gu was enraged as it spat out dragon breath at Zhou Wen.

The dragon breath was like a tidal wave that looked extremely terrifying.

The chick opened its mouth and spewed out golden flames. When the golden flames came into contact with the dragon breath, although a portion of the dragon breath was burned away, it was suppressed by the dragon breath. The dragon breath was about to blanket the wooden boat.

Gu Shanshui, Gu Lou, and Gu He’s faces were ashen. They didn’t dare resist at all. Although Li Mobai, Butterfly, and Mute had tried their best to block the dragon breath, their efforts were in vain. Their expressions turned ugly.
