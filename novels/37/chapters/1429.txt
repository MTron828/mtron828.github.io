Chapter 1430: Final Countdown

Translator: CKtalon

Tai Sui’s attack needed to hit someone to produce effects. As the saying went, breaking ground where Tai Sui presided required touching Tai Sui. Although Zhou Wen didn’t need to break ground, he had to touch Tai Sui.

Zhou Wen had previously experimented. The stronger Tai Sui’s attack was and the more attacks it delivered, the greater the effects of the Tai Sui God symbol.

Zhou Wen didn’t feel any pain when he struck his head with Tai Sui, but the feeling of having lost control immediately weakened. The automatic strengthening of his muscles also decreased significantly.

It works! He was immediately delighted as he smashed the club on his head again.

The main reason was that Tai Sui’s strength was too weak. Zhou Wen could use more strength if he did the smashing for it. On the other hand, holding Tai Sui would also affect him to a certain extent.

Hence, everyone saw a shocking scene. Human Sovereign held a huge club in one hand and smashed it on his head. His other hand held the Immortal Culling Sword as he fought Xiao.

Xiao, who had the upper hand, gradually had Zhou Wen turn the tide. Soon, he found it difficult to gain the upper hand.

“How… How do you explain this?” Xia Liuchuan’s eyes widened.

“Is this the legendary meme of you wouldn’t like me when I’m angry; I’ll beat myself?”

“Human Sovereign is freaking amazing! Is he giving Xiao a few club strikes as a handicap before beating him to the ground?”

“Could this be the legendary Great Sadomasochistic technique? The more self-mutilation, the stronger one becomes?”

Everyone was amused when they saw Human Sovereign smashing himself with a club with one hand and fighting Xiao crazily with the other. The more he fought, the more ferocious he became. He seemed to be about to suppress Xiao.

Holy God looked at Zhou Wen in a daze and didn’t say a word. The Saints beside him were even more silent. They didn’t even dare look up or watch the battle, much less speak.

Without the power of blessing to cause trouble, Zhou Wen brought Xiao back to the beginning with the Immortal Culling Sword.

Xiao watched as Human Sovereign kept smashing himself while smashing him. He was clearly surprised.

However, when he looked at the time, his expression immediately turned solemn. There were only sixteen minutes left.

How troublesome!?Xiao frowned inwardly. At the same time, his figure flashed as he left the battlefield. He didn’t continue attacking Zhou Wen as he raised the rapier in his hand. The blade was right in front of his eyes.

“The reason Calamity-grade creatures can be called Calamity-grade creatures is definitely beyond your comprehension.” With Xiao’s voice, a strange power rose from the rapier in his hand.

Zhou Wen stared at Xiao as he continued smashing himself with the Tai Sui club. However, he felt a little apprehensive.

The rapier in Xiao’s hand seemed to gradually fuse with his Calamity Zone. The feeling was indescribable as though the entire domain was attached to the rapier.

In the next moment, the rapier in Xiao’s hand moved again.

If Xiao’s previous sword art only had a strange trajectory, then his present sword art was no longer as simple as its trajectory being difficult to understand. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Many people could see the trajectory of the thrust clearly, but despite being able to see it clearly, it made them feel like slamming their heads into it.

It was as though the rapier was a shimmering flame, while others were like the moths flying towards the fire.

There seemed to be a devil’s voice saying, “How satisfying would it be to rush forward and let the blade pierce through your chest.”

This was an unreasonable matter, but even the people watching the battle through the live broadcast had the urge to charge at the rapier and let it pierce through their chests.

If not for the fact that they couldn’t rush over, many people would have already slammed into the rapier.

“He has just advanced to the Calamity grade and advanced with the help of external forces; yet, he can actually comprehend the way to become one with the domain. Such talent is rare.” Holy God revealed a look of surprise.

After an ordinary creature advanced to the Calamity grade, it was already very difficult for them to stably use their domain powers. To use domain powers as freely as Xiao required a long period of comprehension and training.

It was akin to a person who had never ridden a bicycle before managing to drive an F1 car at professional standards after recently getting an F1 car or just knowing how to drive one. It was no wonder that Holy God was surprised.

However, what surprised Holy God even more was that even though Xiao had already done so, Human Sovereign still managed to block all of Xiao’s attacks.

Furthermore, Human Sovereign was fighting with a sword in one hand and striking himself with the club in the other.

Although Xiao was very strong, Zhou Wen was immune to his domain’s power. With the effects of The Disqualified, unless Xiao was so fast that Zhou Wen couldn’t see his actions, no matter how powerful the rapier was, it would be blocked by the Immortal Culling Sword.

Time ticked by. Xiao’s attacks became more and more ferocious, but he ultimately failed to injure Zhou Wen. As for the Cube’s countdown, there was less than a minute left.

Xiao’s eyes revealed a look of worry. His eyes shimmered as though he was secretly thinking about something.

“Sigh… Xiao… What a pity… If I had known this would happen… I wouldn’t have chosen you…” Holy God sighed as though he was feeling wistful, but it was unknown what he was feeling regretful about.

Zhou Wen used all his strength to fight Xiao. To fight a Calamity-grade creature at the Terror grade, especially such a Calamity-grade creature, Zhou Wen could only block Xiao’s attack despite using all his strength. It was difficult to defeat him.

In fact, Zhou Wen realized that Xiao’s various techniques, be it his movement techniques or sword arts, weren’t inferior to his. If not for The Disqualified and various Essence Energy Arts, it would be difficult for him to be Xiao’s match even with the Immortal Culling Sword.

Furthermore, for some reason, after such a long battle, Zhou Wen felt a sense of familiarity—one which he couldn’t explain.

Suddenly!

Zhou Wen realized that Xiao’s attacks were happening faster again. This time, it wasn’t just his sword speed. Even Xiao’s speed had increased. It was much faster than before. This left Zhou Wen alarmed.

If he couldn’t even see Xiao’s actions clearly, it would be impossible for him to block his subsequent strikes.

Zhou Wen sized up Xiao and realized that the armor on Xiao’s body was emitting a holy light. The light was pure and flawless, like glass that purified all the impurities in the armor. It made the armor gradually turn transparent and crystalline.

As the holy light intensified, Xiao’s strength became stronger and stronger; likewise for his speed. It was so fast that Zhou Wen couldn’t even see Xiao’s actions clearly.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Zhou Wen blocked three strikes in a row. Even with the augmentation of the Immortal Culling Sword’s power, Zhou Wen was still forced to retreat. The hand holding the sword kept trembling as the flesh between his thumb and index finger ruptured with gushing blood.

“If you want to survive, kill Human Sovereign before the countdown. Otherwise, descend into Samsara with Human Sovereign.” Holy God watched the battle without any emotion in his eyes.

Xiao was able to advance to the Calamity grade because he had fused with Holy God’s avatar. Holy God had already activated his avatar. If Xiao failed to kill Zhou Wen before the Cube’s countdown ended, Xiao, who had fused with his avatar, would self-destruct.. The power of self-destruction was enough to destroy any creature below the Calamity grade.
