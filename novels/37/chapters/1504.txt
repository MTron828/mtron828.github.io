Chapter 1505 The Strangeness of the Wind God Cave

“The two of you… Don’t blindly… make a decision… Think about it again…” Zhou Wen originally wanted them not to blindly believe in him, but after some thought, it didn’t seem appropriate to say that. He changed his mind at the last minute.

Ming Xiu smiled and said, “It’s not blind faith. We know that there are risks, but all investments carry risks; high risk, high reward. We think we can bet on you, Coach.”

“Whatever suits you. Don’t regret it if you lose the bet.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and asked Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan, “What’s your cultivation level now?”

Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan’s eyes lit up while their expressions turned solemn. Ming Xiu said, “I’ve already advanced to the Terror grade. The Mythical Serum I used was created from a temporal dimensional creature. It’s quite a coincidence. It was originally a Calamity creature, but when it was released, something happened. It was invaded by an enemy and was severely injured. I lucked out by touching it while it was on its deathbed. I got Senior Haifeng to help me create the Mythical Serum. Now that I’ve advanced to the Terror grade, the Terror transformation ability I obtained is Temporal Arbitration…”

Everyone’s Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and Terror transformation abilities were their greatest secrets. However, Ming Xiu explained his abilities in detail in front of Zhou Wen without any intention of hiding them.

“Coach, do you think there’s anything I need to correct?” Ming Xiu looked at Zhou Wen with anticipation.

“You have your own ideas and cultivation direction. Furthermore, I’m not good at temporal powers. It’s not appropriate for me to give you any suggestions.” Zhou Wen paused before saying, “However, if you want to advance to the Calamity grade, you can pay attention to temporal dimensional zones. You might gain something.” “Coach, you actually know how to advance to the Calamity grade. That means you should have already advanced to the Calamity grade, right? I understand, Coach. In the future, I’ll especially search for some temporal dimensional zones to train myself. I hope I can comprehend time. I hope I can advance to the Calamity grade as soon as possible like you.” Ming Xiu nodded in enlightenment.

Feng Qiuyan continued, “Coach, I’ve also advanced to the Terror grade, but my situation is somewhat special. My Mythical Serum comes from the Wind God Cave that our Feng family guards…”

Zhou Wen wasn’t too surprised when Feng Qiuyan told him the details of his situation.

Back then, Feng Qiuyan had summoned a very strange Companion Beast. It was said to be from the Wind God Cave protected by the Feng family. Zhou Wen had long felt that it wasn’t simple.

Feng Qiuyan originally wanted to hunt a dimensional creature that was suitable for him in the Wind God Cave before creating the Mythical Serum.

However, to his surprise, the magical Companion Beast on him led him deep into the Wind God Cave. There was a strange cave there with a small pool at its bottom. It had a little spring water inside.

Feng Qiuyan was pushed into the pool by his Companion Beast. When he came out, the spring water in the pool had already dried up, and he had advanced to the Mythical stage.

Later, Feng Qiuyan went to look for Hui Haifeng. After Hui Haifeng helped him check his body, he told him that his physical condition had advanced after using the Mythical Serum. The clear spring water was likely a natural or man-made Mythical Serum. Even Hui Haifeng couldn’t tell what type it was.

Feng Qiuyan’s Essence Energy didn’t seem to have any special attributes, but at times, it could produce unbelievable power.

Feng Qiuyan himself wasn’t too sure of the attributes of his powers. He had always cultivated with the wind elemental in mind, but the power of his Terror form had nothing to do with wind. Its name was Rebellious.

Ming Xiu still had some traces of influence from a dimensional creature’s bloodline. For example, his ears looked a little like cat ears. As for Feng Qiuyan, there was no sign of the effects of the Mythical Serum. He was no different from a human who hadn’t used one.

“Coach, should I cultivate in a wind-elemental dimensional zone?” Feng Qiuyan asked Zhou Wen in anticipation after explaining his situation.

In fact, Feng Qiuyan had previously been to dimensional zones where many wind-elemental creatures appeared, but the effects weren’t ideal.

“Let’s find a place to first show me your powers.” With Feng Qiuyan’s description, he couldn’t tell what Feng Qiuyan’s powers were, so he decided to take a look.

Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t believe that he could teach Feng Qiuyan anything. He only wanted to help him figure out what attributes his powers belonged to.

“It’s been a long time since I received your personal guidance. Count me in,” Ming Xiu said excitedly.

When Li Xuan saw Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan looking extremely excited, he thought to himself, Could it be that these two fellows are born masochists? Do they feel uncomfortable not being beaten up? If that’s the case, they should learn from me. Why are they looking for Old Zhou? My skill at enduring beatings suits them better. However, it’s too late for them to change to my Essence Energy Art now. What a shame for these two good seedlings. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The four of them and a bear arrived at an uninhabited spot in the wilderness. When the baby bear saw Zhou Wen return, it had stuck to him and refused to leave.

While Zhou Wen was away, he got Li Xuan to help take care of the baby bear. The baby bear was barely willing to let Li Xuan approach it, but the moment Zhou Wen returned, he ignored him.

“An ingrate… To think I fed you so many good things… Pui…” Li Xuan muttered gloomily.

“Coach, please enlighten me.” Feng Qiuyan summoned his saber. At the same time, a mysterious force circulated around his body as though the wind was flowing around him, causing his clothes and long hair to dance.

What kind of power is this? It even has a hairdryer effect? Zhou Wen looked at Feng Qiuyan in envy. He looked like an immortal riding the wind, exuding an indescribable elegance.

However, Feng Qiuyan didn’t think too much about it as he slashed.

Zhou Wen’s eyesight was definitely top-notch at the Terror grade, but at the instant Feng Qiuyan’s saber slashed out, it vanished from his vision, making it difficult for him to keep up with the saber’s speed.

This left Zhou Wen somewhat alarmed. However, even though Feng Qiuyan’s saber could make Zhou Wen’s vision unable to keep up, he couldn’t escape Truth Listener’s enhanced hearing.

Zhou Wen extended two fingers and instantly clamped the blade that Feng Qiuyan had slashed out. The blade was less than three centimeters away from Zhou Wen’s neck.

“Again,” Zhou Wen said to Feng Qiuyan as he released his fingers.

Feng Qiuyan seemed to expect it. After sheathing his saber, he attacked Zhou Wen again. Feng Qiuyan’s saber was terrifyingly fast. It was already close to the speed of a Calamity-grade. Furthermore, as he constantly struck out with his saber, his saber speed constantly increased.

However, this speed wasn’t enough to injure Zhou Wen, but it already left him somewhat alarmed.
