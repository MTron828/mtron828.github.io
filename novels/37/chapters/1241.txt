Chapter 1242: Battle of Mount Laojun 4

Translator: CKtalon

“Little Wen.” Although Ouyang Lan couldn’t see the situation in the arena, she looked eagerly at Zhou Wen when she heard Ya’er.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “I’ll give it a try.”

If An Tianzuo was killed, it would be their turn next. Zhou Wen felt that it was better to take action now. At the very least, things would be easier.

He only needed to deal with Cave Era. The abilities of the other Guardians weren’t much of a threat to An Tianzuo. It was best to let An Tianzuo deal with them himself. Zhou Wen had never liked to kill.

Zhou Wen walked down Mount Laojun and was about to enter the battlefield when he suddenly frowned and quickly retreated..

A ghost-like arrow flew past Zhou Wen’s hair and vanished mid-flight.

Zhou Wen turned his head and saw Xiao holding a bow in one hand and casually grabbing the air with the other. An arrow appeared in his hand and he nocked it. He aimed at Zhou Wen and said, “Little brother, don’t interrupt such an exciting performance, alright?”

“Xiao!” Ouyang Lan exclaimed. She naturally knew how powerful Xiao was.

Back when Zhou Wen and An Tianzuo were present and had the upper hand, they had failed to keep Xiao.

Beside Xiao were two people. From their attitude, they were likely not Xiao’s subordinates. They were probably saints from the Holy Temple like Xiao.

Zhou Wen said nothing as he summoned Sword Pill and held it in his hand.

“Why are you in such a rush to leave?” The arrow in Xiao’s hand flew out like a ghost, forcing Zhou Wen to dodge it.

From different directions, the other two saints also blocked the path Zhou Wen needed to take to help An Tianzuo.

“Let me do the introductions. This is Thunderstorm, a saint from the Connate Holy Temple,” Xiao said with a smile as he pointed at a fellow wearing Guardian armor. He wasn’t tall, but his figure was wide like a tank.

Thunderstorm snorted coldly and remained silent.

Xiao then pointed at another saint who had a relatively normal figure, but was wearing gorgeous golden armor. He looked like an emperor out on an inspection. “This is the Divine Emperor Holy Temple’s saint, Yellowright.”

Yellowright looked down at Zhou Wen from above like an emperor looking at a slave. He said coldly, “Xiao, I’m here to kill An Tianzuo. It’s best if you deal with such a fellow yourself.”

However, Xiao said seriously, “Brother Yellowright, you mustn’t underestimate the enemy. His strength isn’t inferior to An Tianzuo’s. I’m not his match alone. It’s safer for the three of us to attack together.”

Yellowright and Thunderstorm revealed looks of contempt when they heard Xiao.

“The saints of your Trajectory Holy Temple are best at avoiding the important and making light of the trivial. To deal with such a person, you even need three of us saints to join forces. Aren’t you embarrassed?” Yellowright said disdainfully.

“It’s better to be embarrassed than lose your life.” Xiao thought nothing of it. From the looks of it, if Yellowright and Thunderstorm left, he would immediately flee. He definitely wouldn’t fight Zhou Wen head-on.

“Fine. It won’t be much of a waste of time to deal with an inferior fellow. An Tianzuo won’t be able to escape anyway. It won’t be too late to kill him after taking this guy down,” Yellowright said as he walked towards Zhou Wen.

With every step he took, the golden light on his body intensified. Although the light was intense, it wasn’t scorching hot. It only emitted an indescribable pressure.

The Sunset Army officers watching the battle on the mountain seemed to be affected by some force despite being so far away. They had the urge to kneel down and worship him.

Thankfully, the officers who came with An Tianzuo were all military bigwigs. All of them had reached the Mythical stage, and their willpower had been tempered to an extremely tenacious level during the wars they were involved in. This allowed them to resist the urge to kneel.

“Holy Emperor Body... Isn’t that a power unique to the Cape family? Could this person be from the Cape family? It doesn’t look like it. He should be from the East District, right?” An officer who wasn’t in the know was secretly surprised.

Zhou Wen naturally knew that Yellowright was definitely not from the Cape family, but from the Divine Emperor Holy Temple.

Zhou Wen had always suspected that the secrets he had heard from the Dugu family seemed to be related to these saints.

He also suspected that some of the orphans nurtured by Dugu Qianqiu had later entered the Holy Temple and become saints.

Otherwise, the spots to enter the Holy Land were in the hands of the six families every year. Ordinary people couldn’t enter, so the Holy Temples had no chance of finding suitable candidates.

As for the orphans, they were different. If there was an existence among the orphans who looked identical to the youths of the six families, they could replace them without anyone noticing and enter the Holy Land.

Otherwise, saints like Xiao and Blaze definitely couldn’t be nurtured overnight. It was also impossible for the Holy Temple to randomly make someone a saint.

However, this was only Zhou Wen’s guess. He wasn’t sure if the saints were related to the orphans nurtured by Dugu Qianqiu.

Now, what Zhou Wen wanted to know was the relationship between the Holy Temples and the League of Guardians.

It didn’t seem like they were in cahoots. Cave Era and the others were also somewhat surprised by the arrival of the three saints.

However, from Cave Era and company’s reaction, Zhou Wen felt that they didn’t treat Xiao and company as enemies. There wasn’t much animosity. This also meant that things weren’t that simple between them. At the very least, they weren’t strangers.

Yellowright walked towards Zhou Wen step by step. Not only was his power of imperial authority rising from his body, but golden chains also began to appear around Zhou Wen’s body.

The golden chains gradually materialized and bound Zhou Wen’s body. Like shackles, they bound him tightly.

“Thunder, let’s attack together,” Xiao said to Thunderstorm.

“That’s not necessary. I alone am enough.” Yellowright rejected him arrogantly. As he got closer and closer to Zhou Wen, the shackles on Zhou Wen’s body became more and more corporeal. The restrictions on his body also became stronger.

Zhou Wen increasingly felt that these saints resembled the orphans. They were indeed very powerful, but they also seemed to be lacking in character. They were somewhat different from ordinary people. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Zhou Wen felt that it was very likely the result of growing up in that special environment. He originally wanted to observe for a while longer, but Yellowright had already walked in front of him and raised the golden sword condensed from golden light in his hand. The mighty power of imperial authority emitted by the golden sword was much stronger than when Xiao used the Holy Emperor Body.

Perhaps this is the difference between professionals and amateurs. As Zhou Wen was thinking, Yellowright slashed down. He wasn’t in the mood to waste his breath on Zhou Wen. An Tianzuo, one of the four war gods, was his desired opponent.

Naive child. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly as he gripped the Sword Pill in his hand.
