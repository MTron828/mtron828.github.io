Chapter 1150: Ming Xiu’s Coach

Hermit sized up Zhou Wen with a frown. The more he looked at Zhou Wen, the more familiar he found him. It was as though he had seen him somewhere before.

However, if it was someone he had seen before, Hermit was very confident that his memory wouldn’t forget him.

Furthermore, to be able to be so calm and composed in front of him wasn’t something an ordinary person could do. After all, his entire body’s pulse resonated with the heavens and the earth. It was impossible for an ordinary person to face him so easily.

It was even more impossible to forget such a person.

This couldn’t be blamed on Hermit not recognizing Zhou Wen. It was because the person impersonating Zhou Wen had slowly changed his temperament, appearance, and figure over the past five years.

As it was a subtle change accumulated over time, with slight adjustments each time, it made people slowly begin to recognize that that was how Zhou Wen ought to be.

Now that the real Zhou Wen had appeared, coupled with the changes in his appearance and temperament over the past five years, it was difficult for others to associate him with ‘Zhou Wen’ unless they were very familiar with him.

Hermit had only seen Zhou Wen’s pictures and videos in the past. To be able to sense that he was familiar was already testament to his acumen.

Hermit couldn’t tell Zhou Wen’s origins, nor could he tell from his clothes and the things on him. Therefore, he asked, “How may I address you?”

“My name isn’t important. What’s important is who I am,” Zhou Wen said.

“Who are you?” Hermit was very patient as he asked again.

“I’m Ming Xiu’s coach,” Zhou Wen answered seriously.

“So what?” Hermit stared at Zhou Wen and pressed his middle finger on his thumb. Strength secretly gathered between his two fingers.

“So if you are here for Ming Xiu, you can return now,” Zhou Wen said.

Beryl wrote Zhou Wen off as crazy when she heard that. His tone made it seem as though he didn’t think much of Hermit. It was as though as long as he was around, Hermit couldn’t harm Ming Xiu at all.

Hermit’s gaze turned sharp as he stared coldly at Zhou Wen and said, “It’s fine if you want me to return, but it depends on whether you are capable of enforcing that.”

With that said, the fingers in Hermit’s sleeve moved.

After all, he was one of the four heads of the League of Guardians. If he was scared off by a few words from the other party, how could he still have a foothold in the League of Guardians?

However, Hermit didn’t plan on fighting Zhou Wen head-on. In fact, that wasn’t his specialty.

As Hermit flicked his finger, an invisible particle flew towards Zhou Wen.

Hermit was best at micro powers. In this era, many people pursued greater and stronger things. Giant monsters that resembled dragons received the attention of most people. They yearned to possess such powerful strength.

However, it was different for Hermit. Although he also pursued becoming stronger, his pursuit was towards miniaturization.

“What determines strength and weakness are often trivial things.” This had always been Hermit’s belief. In fact, he had never been wrong.

Relying on his micro powers, Hermit had defeated many powerful opponents. Some of his opponents’ strengths were not inferior to his, but even if their strengths were comparable, his micro powers gave him a huge advantage.

A power that was so tiny that it was invisible to the Terror grade could erupt with terrifying power once it entered a body. It was impossible to guard against.

This micro crystal was so small that it was at the nanometer scale. Even Terror-grade creatures might not be able to see its existence because it was just too small.

However, such a tiny micro crystal didn’t even need to enter his body. All it needed to do was approach Zhou Wen and the power that erupted would be enough to severely injure a Terror-grade creature.

Although Zhou Wen was casually standing in front of the door, he had engraved his Life Wheel with the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Great Brahma, and Godfiend Era. He just didn’t project them into existence.

The enhancement that Great Brahma gave Zhou Wen was enough for him to see a matter at the quark scale. Although Hermit’s micro crystal was tiny, it couldn’t escape Zhou Wen’s senses.

The micro crystal flew towards Zhou Wen’s mouth, and just as it was about to enter his mouth to blast open his head...

Zhou Wen didn’t move despite the micro crystal reaching his lips. Hermit didn’t feel any joy. Instead, he felt a little uneasy.

In the next moment, Zhou Wen opened his mouth as a clown face appeared over his face. With a strange smile, he swallowed the micro crystal.

The unease in Hermit’s heart intensified as he retreated at full speed, but it was still too late.

The micro crystal that had been devoured by Clown Mask strangely appeared behind him. As he retreated, he immediately slammed into the micro crystal, causing it to explode.

Bam!

One of Hermit’s arms was blasted into a bloody mist. This was still under Hermit’s extremely fast reaction and control of the micro crystal. Otherwise, his entire body would have been blown to smithereens.

Hermit held his bleeding arm and didn’t say a word. He turned around and attempted to escape.

“If you have a death wish, continue fleeing,” Zhou Wen said casually without any intention of chasing after Hermit.

However, Hermit didn’t escape. He stopped in his tracks and didn’t dare take another step.

“Whose order was it to kill Ming Xiu?” Zhou Wen asked.

“There wasn’t an order. Ming Xiu is an enemy of the League of Guardians to begin with. There’s no need for an order,” Hermit said.

“Does that mean you want to kill Ming Xiu?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“You could say that,” Hermit said through gritted teeth.

“Then stay here and guard Ming Xiu. If Ming Xiu lives, you live. If Ming Xiu dies, you die too. This shall continue until Ming Xiu gives you permission to leave.” Zhou Wen turned around and returned to the lounge. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Beryl watched Zhou Wen walk back in a daze as though she had seen a ghost. She couldn’t help but take two steps back as she felt horror.

She even saw the single-armed Hermit standing outside the door. He really didn’t leave—he just stood guarding the door.

“You... Who are you?” Beryl looked at Zhou Wen in surprise and finally couldn’t help but ask.

She didn’t even see Zhou Wen take action. It was as though Zhou Wen had just stood there and exchanged a few words with Hermit when one of Hermit’s arms suddenly exploded.

Then, because of one sentence from Zhou Wen, Hermit, one of the Four Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians, actually stood at the door as a guard. This made her feel like she was living in a dream.

“Ming Xiu’s coach.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to say his name because there was still another Zhou Wen in the An family.

“You... You...” Beryl repeated ‘you’ for a long time, but she couldn’t think of anything to say. Or perhaps she wanted to ask too many questions that she didn’t know where to start.

She suddenly recalled that Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi had claimed that Ming Xiu’s sword art was very ordinary. Back then, Beryl had thought that they were jealous of Ming Xiu, but now, she suddenly realized that they were speaking the truth.

Who is he? Is there such a powerful existence among humans? I don’t think I saw him use a Guardian, nor did I see any signs of dimensional creatures on him. Could he be a pure-blooded human? Impossible. It’s impossible for him to be a pure-blooded human. He must have hidden it well and fused with a Guardian or dimensional creature. I just can’t tell... Beryl looked at Zhou Wen and then at Hermit standing outside the door. Everything was so surreal.
