Chapter 1285: Humanity’s First Attempt

Nothing major happened for half a month. The Federation and overseas faction seemed quiet. Apart from the occasional news of dimensional creatures breaking through on a large scale, the world enjoyed some level of peace.

Over the past few days, Zhou Wen had two Golden Battle God Halberds drop, one Rejuvenation Pill, and a Golden Battle God Mark I. Now, of the six Golden Battle Gods, Zhou Wen had five. The only thing he lacked was Mark IV.

Although Zhou Wen had the intention of figuring out the Founding Emperor Tomb, Chess Mountain, Mount Laojun, Ant City, and other dungeons, his focus wasn’t on them. He had been studying the problem of Absolute Space.

Under his constant research, he had resolved the problem of not simultaneously having two Absolute Spaces.

Using the Spacetime Bandit’s delay function, Zhou Wen successfully made two Absolute Spaces appear at the same time.

This was the result of experimentation, to which the principle behind it eluded Zhou Wen.

He first used Spacetime Bandit to cast Absolute Space. Due to the delay, Absolute Space didn’t immediately appear. And without using Spacetime Bandit, he cast another Absolute Space.

When the delayed Absolute Space appeared, two Absolute Spaces would coexist.

However, this only allowed two Absolute Spaces to simultaneously exist. If he continuously released a few Absolute Spaces within the time window of Spacetime Bandit, the outcome would only be a delay in the appearance of an Absolute Space. It would disappear in succession, replacing the previous one and leaving only the final delayed one.

Only two Absolute Spaces could coexist with each other through the use of a delay and zero delay.

Although two Absolute Spaces were lacking, it gave him more maneuverability.

Now, the new problem was how to spin the two Absolute Spaces. The speed of moving Absolute Spaces definitely couldn’t keep up with the speed of light, so he had to use a special method to allow the two Absolute Spaces to switch and connect.

The Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique could only swap between two Absolute Spaces, but it couldn’t form a wheel pattern unless he had a third Absolute Space.

Furthermore, it took too long to use Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping. It was very difficult to achieve a seamless effect.

How can I make two Absolute Spaces automatically connect seamlessly??Zhou Wen could only continue his research.

He had also watched the battle of the dwarf and knew that if his spatial skill could succeed, it was very likely that he could trap the seventh bullet in the spatial wheel. Then, the sure-kill seventh bullet would never be able to injure him.

Under Ice Maiden’s efforts, Nether Lotus was completely brainwashed.

In Nether Lotus’s mind, Zhou Wen was an evil human pervert. Furthermore, he had placed an inescapable curse on her and Ice Maiden. All she could do was feign civility and obey Zhou Wen’s orders.

Recently, there had been many large-scale break-out of dimensional creatures in the dimensional zones near Luoyang. Zhou Wen got Ice Maiden and Nether Lotus to help Qin Wufu deal with them to prevent them from constantly appearing in front of him.

Although Ice Maiden wanted to go to Chess Mountain, she knew that there was a horrifying existence there and needed Zhou Wen’s strength to enter. Therefore, she had no intention of running.

With her watching Nether Lotus, Zhou Wen felt at ease. Ice Maiden was an ambitious woman. She wouldn’t give up on the Demon God Bloodline Catalog so easily.

Furthermore, ever since she had learned that Nether Lotus had information regarding Earth’s Companion Beasts, Ice Maiden had been pondering over how to get the information out of her.

“Chess Mountain… Chess Mountain actually has this… It’s no wonder you came here… So you’ve already decided…” When Nether Lotus came to Chess Mountain to help the Sunset Army clean up the break-out creatures, she immediately exclaimed.

Ice Maiden realized that the place Nether Lotus was referring to was Chess Mountain.

Ice Maiden was pleasantly surprised, but she wore a poker face. “It’s best you don’t spout nonsense.”

Nether Lotus now wholeheartedly trusted Ice Maiden. She believed that Ice Maiden definitely knew of the news, so she whispered, “This is a good opportunity. We can go in and take a look. Perhaps we can really find Earth’s strongest Companion Beast. With such an existence, we don’t have to be afraid of that evil human.”

“There’s no rush. Chess Mountain is filled with danger. There must be a Calamity-grade existence inside. With our present strength, it’s impossible for us to obtain any benefits even if we enter. We might even die inside,” Ice Maiden said.

“Then what should we do?” Nether Lotus hadn’t expected Earth to be so horrifying. Her understanding of Earth came from the previous Cube ranking battle.

“Don’t be anxious. I’ve already thought of a solution. As long as we do it well, we can lure that evil human into Chess Mountain. When the time comes, he and the creature in Chess Mountain will suffer an internecine outcome, and we can reap the benefits…” Ice Maiden said.

“Can we really do that? We can’t have that evil human obtain the strongest Companion Beast,” said Nether Lotus worriedly.

“Therefore, we need to wait for an opportunity. The plan needs to be meticulous. There can’t be any mistakes.” Ice Maiden continued the bluff.

“I guess that’s the only way.” Nether Lotus was somewhat vexed. If she had known that this would happen, she wouldn’t have sneaked over alone. At the very least, she would have brought a Calamity-grade helper. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

After more than half a month in the doldrums, a figure finally appeared on the Cube’s screen.

All the major media outlets immediately rushed to report. When people saw the person on the Cube screen, they were stunned.

“Human… It’s a human…”

“Isn’t that Thief Sage? What’s he doing there?”

“No, look at that person. He has horns on his head. He’s not human.”

“Ah! That’s the Holy Spirit Association’s Ox Demon.”

“Heavens, there’s also Fairy Peacock and True Martial. Could that fellow be… Ah… That’s Ya… The line up consists of the elites of the Holy Spirit Association… Are they trying to clear the Venusian dimensional zone?”

“That will be tough. Although they are all Terror-grade powerhouses, it’s still too difficult to pass through the defense of the Calamity-grade creature.”

The people were quickly recognized. Although the various factions had long expected someone to make an attempt, they never expected the Holy Spirit Association to be the first.

Everyone talked excitedly. Although the Holy Spirit Association was half-human, people weren’t absolutely against it due to Ya.

The Holy Spirit Association was also a very strange organization. At the very least, ordinary people didn’t have much hatred or resistance towards it.

However, because the Holy Spirit Association had been constantly trying to kill the Guardians and subvert the Federation, it had been designated as an evil organization by the Federation. This was how it had always been promoted.

However, the publicity wasn’t very good. People didn’t have a good impression of the League of Guardians either, so they didn’t believe that what they said was true.

With the main heads of the Holy Spirit Association appearing one after another, and with them all ranked at the top of the wanted list, it gave people a very odd feeling.

Was a group of federal wanted criminals, who weren’t purely human, capable of representing humanity?
