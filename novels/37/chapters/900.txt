Chapter 901: Turtle Tomb

Translator: CKtalon

When Zhou Wen arrived at the Lu family residence, the Lu family warmly welcomed him.

However, when Zhou Wen mentioned the dimensional creature, the Lu family members who received him only gave him a general summary of the situation. Then, they told Zhou Wen that they hoped he could stay with them for two days. After everyone arrived, the Lu family’s patriarch would personally take them to the place where the dimensional creature appeared.

After inquiring, he learned that the An family wasn’t the only one that had accepted the Lu family’s invitation. The Xia and Zhang families had also sent people. There were also many famous freelance hunters.

The Lu family planned on taking everyone over together. When the time came, whoever had the ability to kill the dimensional creature on the spot would receive the Lu family’s offered conditions.

Zhou Wen felt that this was fair. The Lu family only hoped to resolve the problem. As for who killed the dimensional creature, they didn’t care.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on staying in the Lu family residence. Since they would set off in two days, he left the Lu family and planned on visiting the nearby dimensional zones. He might be able to find the tiny palm symbols.

There were four or five famous dimensional zones in Sea Gazing City. The most famous one was half on land and half in the sea. That dimensional zone was named Turtle Tomb.

In fact, Turtle Tomb wasn’t a tomb, but a dimensional zone with countless turtles. It included a large area of beach and shallow sea.

The reason for the name Turtle Tomb was related to an ancient myth.

As ancient people didn’t understand the principle of the water cycle, and only saw rivers flow into the sea day and night, as the seawater never overflowed, they therefore believed that there was a huge abyss to the east of the sea. All the seawater eventually flowed into the bottomless abyss.

This abyss was known as the Sinkhole by the ancients.

Above the East Sea, there were five immortal mountains—Daiyu, Yuanqiao, Fanghu, Yingzhou, and Penglai. Due to the impact of the water, the immortal mountains constantly drifted in the direction of the Sinkhole, making both humans and deities worry.

One of the Sea Gods was afraid that the immortal mountains would slip into the Sinkhole, so he sent fifteen gigantic sea turtles. Three sea turtles formed a group as they held back the five immortal mountains, preventing them from sliding into the Sinkhole.

Everything was originally fine, but after countless years, a few giants came to the beach and used bait to capture six of the turtles. They also untied the ropes on the turtles’ back.

This resulted in a huge disaster. Daiyu and Yuanqiao lost the pull from the sea turtles and eventually sank into the Sinkhole. Only Fanghu, Yingzhou, and Penglai remained.

Legend had it that Turtle Tomb was where the giants had cooked the six sea turtles. Furthermore, they had thrown the turtle shells into the seaside. At high tide, the huge turtle shells would be submerged. And when the tide receded, the turtle shells would be revealed.

Zhou Wen didn’t know the veracity of the legend, but in Turtle Tomb, large swaths of reefs would appear after the tide fell. They were like tiny islands numbering a total of six. On each island, there were many different types of dimensional sea turtles.

All the sea turtles in Turtle Tomb had one Companion Form—armor. It had extremely strong defense. Among Companion Beasts of the same level, the sea turtles’ defense was considered top-notch. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Some special types of turtle armor had insane defense.

Furthermore, it produced a very famous Essence Energy Skill, Turtle Breath. It was available from the Mortal stage to the Epic stage. After cultivating Turtle Breath, one could temporarily stop their heartbeat and breathing. The higher the level, the longer Turtle Breath could last. It was a necessary skill for faking death.

Liu Yun had faked his death before. He had used Turtle Breath, and it was at the Epic stage.

Of course, the true use of Turtle Breath wasn’t to feign death, but to converge one’s aura. It prevented dimensional creatures, that relied on aura to determine where humans were, from detecting humans. The effect was equivalent to invisibility.

As for the Mythical Turtle Breath, legend had it that someone had once had it drop, but no one had seen it.

It wasn’t even noon when Zhou Wen arrived at Turtle Tomb. From afar, he could see many people fighting the sea turtles on the beach. And not far away, he could see several huge reef islands. There were fewer humans on them.

The sea turtles on the beach weren’t of high levels. They were basically at the Mortal stage. Most of the people who came here to hunt sea turtles were people who hadn’t cultivated for long.

Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in the sea turtles here, but he continued walking slowly along the beach as he searched for the tiny palm symbol.

Before coming, An Sheng had told Zhou Wen a legend. Some people said that if the islands formed from the six turtle shells floated away one day, they would definitely head to the Sinkhole to continue fulfilling their mission. Following them might lead to the Daiyu and Yuanqiao immortal islands that had sunk into the Sinkhole.

On the beach of the turtle tomb, two men saw Zhou Wen. One of them said in puzzlement, “Why is he here?”

“The An family likely sent him to hunt that dimensional creature and help the An family obtain the rights to Fiend Dust,” another man said.

These two men weren’t real men. Instead, they were Uesugi Nao and the female guard who had used Body Transformation. It wasn’t convenient for them to use their identities to visit Sea City, so they could only use Body Transformation to change their appearances and come to Sea City incognito.

Just like Zhou Wen, they had to stay in Sea Gazing City temporarily because of the Lu family. Since they had nothing to do, they came to Turtle Tomb to take a look.

This was an open dimensional zone. Anyone could come here without any identification. They naturally didn’t fancy the sea turtles on the beach. Just as they were about to head to Turtle Island, they unexpectedly saw Zhou Wen.

Uesugi Nao rolled her eyes and said to the female guard, “Let’s go over and greet him.”

“Why invite trouble?” The female guard was somewhat unwilling.

“He’s our competitor by coming here. Isn’t it more advantageous for us to find out more about our competitor? Don’t worry, I have a way to obtain information from him,” Uesugi Nao said as she walked towards Zhou Wen.

Although the female guard didn’t agree with Uesugi Nao’s actions, she still followed.

“Hello, are you Zhou Wen?” Uesugi Nao approached Zhou Wen and greeted him with a man’s voice.

Zhou Wen had already sensed that someone was looking at him. He had discovered Uesugi Nao and the female guard, but he didn’t recognize them. He only felt that one of them had a somewhat familiar gaze.

Seeing them come over and greet him, Zhou Wen looked at them in puzzlement and said, “I’m Zhou Wen. Who are you?”

“You’re really Zhou Wen. That’s great. We are your fans and especially admire you. I never expected to meet you here.” Uesugi Nao pretended to be excited as she took out a notebook and pen and handed them to Zhou Wen. “Can I have your autograph?”

“No.” Zhou Wen turned around and left.

His Explosive Fiend Man had the Death List skill. By signing it, it was equivalent to giving his life to the Explosive Fiend Man. Ever since he learned of such a skill, Zhou Wen basically stopped signing autographs, much less giving autographs to strangers.
