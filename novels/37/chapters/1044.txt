Chapter 1045: Lingering Fear

Translator: CKtalon

The tiny Fox Immortal Temple didn’t even have a yard wall. Although it was called a temple, it was actually a small house made of stone. The door was only half the height of an ordinary door. If one wanted to enter, they had to bend very low.

The temple was very simple. There were almost no decorations. The rocks used to build the temple were uneven and very crude.

There was an offering table made of stone in the temple. On the offering table was an ancient wooden tablet with the words “Queen Mother Fox Immortal” engraved on it.

“Wait a moment. There’s still a taboo when entering Fox Immortal Temple. You have to kneel and enter. Otherwise, what you obtain won’t be good luck, but bad luck,” Wang Lu hurriedly said when she saw Li Xuan about to enter.

“So be it. It’s not embarrassing to kneel in front of Queen Mother Fox Immortal. It’s fine if she bestows me some luck later.” Li Xuan was open-minded. He walked to the temple and plopped to his knees.

One had to admit that they could only enter the tiny temple while kneeling. Li Xuan had to lower his head to enter even while kneeling. There was no way he could enter while standing.

When inside the temple, Li Xuan lit the three incense sticks Zhou Wen had given him. He bowed at Queen Mother Fox Immortal’s tablet before inserting the three incense sticks into the incense burner.

At that moment, a purple gas immediately rose from the Queen Mother Fox Immortal’s tablet. The purple gas circled above Li Xuan’s head and landed on his forehead, forming a circular blurry pattern. It looked like a fox with its head and tail connected.

“Is that all? Has my luck increased?” Li Xuan left Fox Immortal Temple and asked Wang Lu.

“It has already increased. I don’t know how long it’s effective though. When the symbol on your forehead disappears, that’s when time is up,” Wang Lu said.

“Then let’s not waste any time. Little Yanyan, quickly go in and pay your respects. Let’s try our luck by going out and killing some dimensional creatures.” Li Xuan urged Feng Qiuyan to enter.

Feng Qiuyan took three incense sticks and mimicked Li Xuan. He entered while kneeling and bowed.

The outcome was the same. A purple gas rushed out from the tablet, but the amount of purple gas was much greater than Li Xuan’s. The pattern formed was also clearer. One could already see the fox’s facial features. It wasn’t as blurry as Li Xuan’s. Even its face couldn’t be seen clearly.

“Why is mine a little different?” Li Xuan asked as he looked at the symbol on Feng Qiuyan’s forehead.

“The clearer the pattern, the stronger and longer the luck augmentation,” Wang Lu explained.

“This is discrimination. Why are Little Yanyan’s effects better than mine when we both bowed?” Li Xuan said gloomily.

“Because you’re ugly,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Since you are beautiful, why don’t you give it a try? You might even be worse than me,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.

Zhou Wen also wanted to know if Queen Mother Fox Immortal’s luck augmentation was effective in-game. Therefore, he took out three more incense sticks and walked to the front of Fox Immortal Temple. Then, he mimicked Li Xuan and knelt in front of the door.

Bam!

The tablet in Fox Immortal Temple suddenly seemed to be blasted away as it fell from the offering table. After falling to the ground, it split into two. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Zhou Wen held the incense sticks in a daze as he looked at the two halves of the tablet on the ground.

“This... Can it still be used?” Zhou Wen wanted to enter again to give it a try, but just as his knees moved and he ended up moving half a step into the temple, the two halves of the Queen Mother Fox Immortal tablet on the ground immediately exploded into fragments.

Seeing this situation, Zhou Wen knew that it was definitely useless. All he could do was stand up with a bitter smile.

Feng Qiuyan and Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen with odd expressions. Li Xuan didn’t react much, having seen this happen before.

“Old Zhou, from the looks of it, you aren’t fated to be augmented by a god in this life. Don’t be so awesome in your next life. It’s not a good thing to be too awesome,” Li Xuan consoled Zhou Wen as he patted him on the shoulder.

Zhou Wen was exasperated as well. He knew that his Life Providence was up to no good, but there was nothing he could do about it. Most temples needed a bow, but a bow from him resulted in something bad, so he couldn’t gain anything from it.

“Forget it. I’m going back.” Zhou Wen hadn’t received the augmentation, nor had he found the tiny palm symbol. He planned on rushing back to the town’s cube with Wang Lu.

Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan went to kill dimensional creatures together. They weren’t interested in watching Zhou Wen flaunt his Companion Beasts.

Zhou Wen hadn’t walked far before he suddenly thought of something. He got Wang Lu to return to Fox Immortal Temple before switching to the Supreme Hell King Life Soul to take a look from afar.

With a glance, he realized that there was a purple Spirit Qi rising in the tiny temple. It was like a transparent purple fox had entrenched itself in the temple as it stared at Zhou Wen in surprise and puzzlement.

This thing... Does it count as a dimensional creature? Zhou Wen looked at the spirit body fox. Under normal circumstances, humans couldn’t see such a pure spirit body creature.

Only the Supreme Hell King Life Soul allowed Zhou Wen to see these things.

Zhou Wen summoned a Golden Battle God Halberd and made it fly towards the fox’s spirit body.

However, the Golden Battle God Halberd directly flew out of the fox’s spirit body and failed to injure it. The fox only stared at Zhou Wen fiercely, but it seemed to be afraid of something. It didn’t dare attack him.

Zhou Wen summoned the Light Concealment Sword and Night Immaculate Sword. He also tried several Companion Beasts and realized that their attacks were useless against the fox in its spirit body state.

The fox only looked at Zhou Wen without any intention of attacking him.

“What are you doing?” Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement.

She couldn’t see the fox’s spirit body. All she saw was Zhou Wen using all sorts of Companion Beasts to constantly attack the air above the temple. She imagined that he had offended Queen Mother Fox Immortal and had been cursed.

“Nothing.” Zhou Wen saw that ordinary Companion Beast attacks were useless against the fox, so he called out Ice Maiden in the Chaos Bead.

After coming out, she stared at the temple. Ice Maiden could clearly see the fox’s spirit body.

When the fox saw Ice Maiden, it immediately bared its teeth and stared at her as though it was afraid of her.

Could the fox in this temple really be a Terror-grade creature? Zhou Wen had only guessed it previously, but now that he saw Queen Mother Fox Immortal staring at Ice Maiden, he was even more certain.

If Queen Mother Fox Immortal is a Terror creature, wouldn’t the Earth Lord in the Earth Temple or the mountain gods of the Mountain God Temple be Terror-grade creatures?

Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd. Although it was somewhat surprising that there was a Terror-grade creature in the temple, what really surprised him was that his Life Providence could smash a Terror-grade creature’s tablet. Furthermore, the Terror-grade creature didn’t do anything to him.

Zhou Wen felt a lingering fear when he thought about it. If the Terror creatures had really attacked him, wouldn’t he have lost his life long ago?
