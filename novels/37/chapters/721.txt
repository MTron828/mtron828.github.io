Chapter 722: Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder

Translator: CKtalon

As they watched the blood-eyed black macaque die, everyone felt as though they had escaped death. They were still in disbelief.

Even Xu Tong wasn’t a match for the blood-eyed black macaque. Who had halved it?

Their heads couldn’t move, but their eyeballs could. Everyone looked in the direction of the saber beam and saw Zhou Wen sitting on the ground with a saber in hand. The blade had already returned to its scabbard.

It’s him? The girl sitting beside Sister Gui was taken aback. She couldn’t believe that Zhou Wen was the one who had killed the blood-eyed black macaque.

Zhou Wen had returned the saber to its scabbard, but he sat there motionless with his eyes closed. He wasn’t sent flying by the power of Teacher Square, nor did he continue reciting.

As Zhou Wen forcefully resisted the rules of Teacher Square, the jade infant suffered the brunt of the terrifying taboo power. It didn’t last long before shattering.

With the jade infant shattered, Zhou Wen originally imagined that he would be severely injured. At best, he would vomit blood, but the worst situation would be having his Dao Sutra crippled.

However, that wasn’t the case. After the jade infant shattered, the power that formed the Life Soul didn’t dissipate. Instead, it reformed again and completed the restructuring in an instant.

The reassembled Life Soul looked extremely strange. Its appearance was completely different from the jade infant’s. It had turned into something extremely strange.

Now, his Life Soul looked like a book, but he couldn’t open it. There were no words on the cover.

Zhou Wen couldn’t sense any powerful force from the ancient book-like Life Soul, but he knew that the Dao Sutra Life Soul had successfully advanced.

This was because he was currently in Teacher Square. The Dao Sutra in his body was still circulating, but the taboo power in Teacher Sutra seemed to have vanished. It was completely useless against him.

When he opened his eyes and looked around, he saw that Sister Gui and company were still reciting under the power of Teacher Square. Zhou Wen knew that he had really succeeded.

With his Life Soul complete, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to continue listening to their recital. He got up and said to Sister Gui, “Sister Gui, thank you for taking care of me these past few days. I’m leaving.”

Zhou Wen didn’t really like farewells. Coincidentally, Sister Gui was still reciting, so she couldn’t speak to him. Zhou Wen waved at her before turning around and walking out of Teacher Square. He quickly left Mount Confucius with the antelope and chick.

When everyone saw that Zhou Wen could move freely on Teacher Square without being affected by its power, they were convinced that he was the person who had killed the blood-eyed black macaque.

When the recital ended, everyone regained their freedom.

“I could tell long ago that Little Zhou is extraordinary. I was right.”

“Bullsh*t. You always liked to call him silly.”

“What do you know? I was just joking with him. How can an ordinary person have such great perseverance? He’s clearly not an ordinary person. I’ve long seen how different he is.”

“I don’t think he’s even twenty years old. To have such a cultivation level, he probably comes from the families of the six heroes, right?”

“I think it’s very likely. Apart from the families of the six heroes, which family can nurture such a young talent?”

Sister Gui couldn’t take it anymore. She rolled her eyes at them and said, “Which of the six hero families have the surname Zhou?”

“Apparently none!” Everyone looked at each other, momentarily unable to guess Zhou Wen’s origins.

The girl looked in the direction Zhou Wen had left with mixed feelings.

Zhou Wen left Five Dragons Mouth. His identity had definitely been exposed this time, so he didn’t head to the other dimensional zones. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The main reason was that he hadn’t found the tiny palm symbol at Five Dragons Mouth. If he were to stay here to study it, it would probably take him more than a year to figure out the entire Five Dragons Mouth dimensional zone.

When he arrived at an uninhabited spot, he summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull. As Zhou Wen rode the bull, he checked the game’s information.

The Dao Body’s Life Soul was no longer Gods Retreat. It had changed again.

Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder (Perfect Body): Before the chaos was separated, there was no heaven or earth, no Yin or Yang, no sun or moon, no crystal or light, no east or west, no south or north, no front or back, no source or sink. Infinite changes, grand and majestic, formless and intangible, natural and mysterious. Destitution to the limits, boundless and immeasurable, only the Highest Elder...

Zhou Wen didn’t understand what the introduction meant, but it sounded very impressive even though he didn’t know what it was for.

In the past, Zero Taboo and Gods Retreat could only exist in his consciousness and not be summoned.

Now that it had transformed into the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Zhou Wen’s mind stirred. The Life Soul that resembled an ancient jade scripture appeared in front of him. Despite it clearly being named Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, there wasn’t a single word on it. Zhou Wen couldn’t open it either. After studying it for a while, he realized that its use was only to resist taboo powers. He didn’t discover any other effects.

Zhou Wen tried in Netherworld City again and realized that the taboo power in Netherworld City was useless against the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. Only now could Zhou Wen be said to be truly a person of zero taboos.

The jade infant from Gods Retreat couldn’t last long in Netherworld City. Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to be tortured, so he hadn’t been able to reach the Netherworld Divine Throne in-game.

Now that he had the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, none of the taboos were effective against Zhou Wen and the blood-colored avatar. Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to walk along the stone path that didn’t even reveal the numbers.

However, when he stepped onto the stone slab, punishment ghosts would still appear. Zhou Wen casually killed them and quickly reached the Netherworld Divine Throne.

Yet, he didn’t see City Lord Netherworld in-game. After Zhou Wen sounded the Golden Bell, the Golden Divine Throne automatically separated, revealing the door to leave.

After leaving the door, the blood-colored avatar came out of the Netherworld City dungeon.

Is this all there is to the Netherworld City dungeon? There isn’t even a Mythical boss? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.

Thinking back to what City Lord Netherworld had said to him, Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. Could it be that I really have to pay a visit to all the torture chambers as City Lord Netherworld said and endure all the punishments before I can see the real Netherworld City? What is the real Netherworld City?

Zhou Wen was very interested in the secrets of Netherworld City, but he gave up when he thought of the punishments.

When I have the chance in the future, I’ll take Li Xuan to Netherworld City in real life and let him suffer the punishments. Then, I’ll know what the real Netherworld City is like. Zhou Wen placed his sights on Li Xuan.

After Zhou Wen left Five Dragons Mouth, his deeds spread around the area. Everyone nearby knew of this young man, but they didn’t know his name. All they knew was that his surname was Zhou.

Even so, this matter was still detected by the bureau.
