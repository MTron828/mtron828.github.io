Chapter 1001: Not Moving

Translator: CKtalon

A faint fog seemed to appear on Joseph’s mysterious gray armor. The Bronze Sparrow Sword pierced through the armor and his chest. The tip of the sword was revealed behind him as flames burned crazily.

“Die!” Joseph felt that such an attack was already powerful enough. He steeled his heart and wanted to transfer his injuries to the Bronze Sparrow Sword.

As the Bronze Sparrow Sword had injured him, he could only transfer it to the Bronze Sparrow Sword and not Zhou Wen.

However, before he could use Hypocritical Transaction to transfer his injuries, the Bronze Sparrow Sword had already exploded. A terrifying explosive force exploded in Joseph’s body like a nuclear bomb.

Not good! Joseph’s expression changed drastically. The explosion of the Bronze Sparrow Sword instantly made him lose his target of damage transfer. Ignoring the fact that his injuries couldn’t be transferred, even Lie probably couldn’t withstand such a terrifying explosion.

Almost instantly, Joseph activated Lie’s Wheel of Destiny: False God Statue.

Boom!

Joseph’s body was blasted apart by the flames, shocking everyone watching. No one expected such a situation to happen.

Thankfully, Joseph’s figure suddenly appeared in a corner of the arena as he half-knelt on the ground. He wasn’t blasted to death. What was blasted to death was a fake statue that was akin to an avatar.

However, the injuries he had suffered previously couldn’t be transferred out. His chest was dripping with blood as his face turned pale. He looked like he was in a terrible condition. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the silent arena, Zhou Wen held the Bronze Sparrow Sword’s scabbard which spewed out flames. It condensed a new Bronze Sparrow Sword that looked flawless.

“Wow! Too powerful... What kind of Companion Beast is that? It’s so cool. I’ve decided! I’ll create such Companion Beast figurines in the future...” Li Benyi exclaimed excitedly.

Li Benyu wore an odd expression. Zhou Wen’s strike had indeed exceeded his imagination.

“Didn’t you say you were not going to move?” Zhou Wen asked Joseph.

“You... pulled a trick...” Joseph’s expression turned nasty as he gritted his teeth and stood up. He stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “Don’t be too smug. Schemes can only last for a while. In front of true strength, scheming is useless. I’ll let you know what true strength is.”

With that said, the Guardian armor on Joseph’s body emitted a mysterious fog. His injured chest and armor rapidly recovered in the mysterious fog. In the blink of an eye, he returned to normal as though he had never been injured.

What powerful recovery ability. It’s actually stronger than my self-healing ability? Li Xuan widened his eyes in disbelief.

“From the looks of it, that shouldn’t be ordinary self-healing, right?” Feng Qiuyan said after some thought.

Sadie used the Eye of Odin to see more clearly. She said, “It really doesn’t look like self-healing. It’s more like some kind of time-reversal ability that reverts his state to before he was injured.”

“That works too? Isn’t this too much of a bug? Such a scumbag actually has such a powerful Guardian. How depressing,” Li Xuan said.

Lance pondered and said, “I don’t think it’s that easy to use such a powerful force like reversing the flow of time. Perhaps, Joseph needs to pay a certain price.”

“What kind of price could it be?” Li Xuan asked.

“I don’t know.” Lance shook his head.

In the spectator stands, many people from Frost City began shouting Joseph’s name in unison.

To be able to escape from such a huge explosion and instantly recover from his injuries, he looked as powerful as a god.

However, they didn’t dare underestimate Zhou Wen now. The strike from the Bronze Sparrow Sword had left them somewhat horrified. Even now, they still felt their scalps tingle when they thought of that strike.

“Zhou Wen, are you prepared to suffer the wrath of God’s chosen one?” Joseph said coldly as he stared at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen summoned some armor and put it on. He said with a smile, “Since you can’t abide by the agreement, it’s my turn to stand here motionless and let you attack. Feel free to attack. I’m always a man of my word. I won’t run.”

These words made Joseph’s expression turn nasty. He originally imagined that he could use Hypocritical Transaction to teach Zhou Wen a lesson, but he never expected Zhou Wen to counter him.

Now, Joseph knew that he had to suppress Zhou Wen to protect the image he had painstakingly built up in Frost City.

“You are tempting fate.” Joseph’s figure appeared in front of Zhou Wen like a phantom as he punched him in the chest.

Unlike ordinary people’s boxing techniques, there was a ring on the middle finger of Joseph’s fist. There was a spike on the ring. It was a poison spike that came with Lie’s armor. Coupled with the use of Essence Energy’s Sweet-Talking Punch, the poison produced when the poisonous sting stabbed into one’s body could make one hallucinate.

Even if Joseph didn’t kill Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen would still fall into an illusion. If his will wasn’t firm, he would commit suicide even without needing Joseph to do a thing.

Clang!

However, when Joseph’s fist struck Zhou Wen’s body, the poisonous sting failed to penetrate the armor at all. Under the powerful impact, the poisonous sting nearly snapped, but the armor remained unharmed.

“Impossible? How can it have such powerful defense?” Joseph refused to believe that his Guardian powers couldn’t break through Zhou Wen’s armor.

With that, Joseph quickly moved as he brandished his fists and struck Zhou Wen with all his might.

Zhou Wen wore the Shell Dragon Armor and had activated Absolute Defense. No matter how Joseph attacked, he couldn’t break through the armor.

No matter how strong Lie was, it hadn’t activated its Terror form. It was just too difficult to break through the Absolute Defense. Back then, Night Thearch hadn’t been able to directly penetrate the Absolute Defense, much less Joseph.

The people in the spectator stands were dumbfounded. Zhou Wen really stood there motionless, allowing Joseph to attack.

In their eyes, the god-like Joseph was now a weak child. No matter how he attacked, he couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all.

That fellow... What’s going on... A strange thought arose in many people’s hearts as they looked at Zhou Wen who was dressed in blue crystal armor as though he was protected by the stars.

Could it be that the strength of a Companion Beast is really stronger than a Guardian? Although they were unwilling to believe it deep down, the image of a Guardian suddenly didn’t seem so lofty in their hearts when they saw Joseph fighting an adult like a child.

“What Companion Beast is this? It’s so powerful. Joseph can’t even leave a mark on the armor. It’s just too powerful...” Li Benyi’s eyes lit up.

Ya’er glanced at Li Benyi and felt that this fellow was so noisy as if he had never seen anything.
