Chapter 154 A Strategy Guide That Can’t Be Sold

“What did you say?” Li Xuan’s eyes widened as he glared at a female student and shouted loudly.

The girl looked a little afraid and said meekly, “My mission is done... There’s no need... There’s no need to buy your strategy...”

“That’s impossible. Are you joking with me? How did you kill the Bronze Luck Beasts?” Li Xuan said while glaring at the girl in disbelief.

The girl said cautiously, “I didn’t kill Bronze Luck Beasts; I only killed ten Bronze Bunnies and completed the mission.”

“Bronze Bunnies? Isn’t our mission to kill Legendary bronze beasts? What’s the point of killing Bronze Bunnies?” Li Xuan said with a frown.

“The homework mission didn’t say to kill Legendary bronze beasts. All you need to do is kill bronze beasts.” The girl hurriedly took out her phone to show Li Xuan.

Indeed, her homework mission only stated that she needed to kill bronze beasts. There was no rule that required her to kill those at the Legendary stage.

“That’s impossible, right? We can’t be mistaken?” Li Xuan hurriedly took out his cell phone and read his homework mission again, confirming that he wasn’t wrong. It clearly indicated that he needed to kill Legendary-stage bronze beasts.

“Old Zhou, what does yours say?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen again.

“Same as yours.” Zhou Wen handed his phone to Li Xuan.

Li Xuan took a glance and, just like him, quickly made a few phone calls. Soon, he looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression and said, “All of our classmates received missions to kill bronze beasts. We are the only two who received the mission to kill Legendary-stage bronze beasts.”

“Could it be a mistake?” Zhou Wen asked.

“It’s impossible for the wrong message to be sent. They are sent en masse. If it was sent wrongly, all the students must have received the wrong message. How can it be just the two of us? This is clearly a message that was separately sent to us,” Li Xuan said.

“Then doesn’t that mean that my strategy won’t be of any use?” Zhou Wen’s first thought wasn’t why Wang Fei had given them such a difficult mission, but if his strategy guide could still be sold.

“That’s hard to say. According to what I know, the class of special admissions students received this mission as well. However, those guys are basically at the Legendary stage and all of them have their noses up in the air. They probably won’t spend money on buying your strategy,” Li Xuan said.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown when he heard that he might not be able to sell the strategy guide. However, when he thought of Wang Lu, his eyes lit up again. He turned to Li Xuan and asked, “Li Xuan, is there any record in Restriction City? I mean the time record for killing the Bronze Luck Beast.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Definitely. There are records in every dimensional zone.” Li Xuan instantly understood what Zhou Wen was getting at. “You mean you wish to sell this strategy to special admissions students who wish to break the record?”

“I can give it a try.” Zhou Wen felt that there was a chance. He planned on asking Wang Lu to see if she was interested in buying the strategy.

They returned to Four Seasons Garden and went to Wang Lu’s dorm to look for her. They happened to meet her on the way there. She was accompanied by about five special admissions students, seemingly having just returned. They were chatting as they walked, as though they were discussing something.

“Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, what a coincidence!” Wang Lu greeted Zhou Wen and Li Xuan when she saw them.

“It’s not a coincidence. We came here especially to find you. Did you special admissions students receive the homework mission to kill the Bronze Luck Beasts?” Zhou Wen asked directly.

“That’s right. What’s the matter?” Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen curiously, unsure why he would suddenly ask.

“It’s this. Li Xuan and I have figured out a strategy to kill the Bronze Luck Beast. It should be of some help for killing them, allowing you to kill them faster and even break the record. Would you be interested?” Zhou Wen asked.

Before Wang Lu could say a word, a male student beside her said, “Zhou Wen, we admit that your Companion Beasts are indeed powerful. Unfortunately, we don’t have any as powerful as yours. Your strategy is useless to us.”

“The strategy we came up with doesn’t need any special Companion Beasts. Besides, they can’t be used in Restriction City,” Zhou Wen said.

“Since no one can use a Companion Beast, we can figure out a method to kill the Bronze Luck Beasts ourselves. Why would we need to spend money on your strategy?” said the boy with a smile.

Zhou Wen finally realized that with his low EQ, he had overlooked a problem. Those who could enter Sunset College were geniuses, and the special admissions students were geniuses among geniuses. They were all rather proud, so to get them to spend money to buy a strategy from someone else would be akin to making them admit that they were inferior to others. How could proud special admissions students be willing to spend money to buy such a thing?

Another female student also said, “Zhou Wen, we came to Sunset College to hone ourselves. We have to experience it for ourselves before we can improve. Buying someone else’s strategy is equivalent to cheating. It’s meaningless to us.”

The other special admissions students likely had similar views.

Wang Lu said, “Zhou Wen, I’m sure your strategy is useful, but I still want to challenge myself.”

With Wang Lu saying that, Zhou Wen knew that there was no hope in selling his strategy.

After they returned to the dorm, Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen, “From the looks of it, the strategy would be a tough sell. I wonder what Ms. Wang was thinking. Why didn’t she tell us earlier that only the two of us were given the mission to kill Bronze Luck Beasts? We wasted so much time researching a strategy.”

“It’s nothing. Just treat it as a form of training and learning.” Zhou Wen didn’t mind.

Li Xuan thought for a moment and said, “By the way, you can post the strategy guide to our school’s intranet forums. It allows for monetization. Who knows, those special admissions students might be embarrassed to buy it in front of others, but wouldn’t have scruples doing it in private.”

“Alright, help me post it. However, the price must be set high. Such a strategy guide isn’t worth anything if it’s spread, so it’s best to earn as much as possible in one go.” Zhou Wen still remembered the painful experience of posting the last strategy and warned Li Xuan.

“But if the price is too high, it won’t be easy for them to be purchased, right?” Li Xuan remarked hesitantly.

“It’s fine even if it can’t be sold, as long as it’s not sold too cheaply.” Zhou Wen was quite open-minded.

“Alright.” Li Xuan nodded and posted the strategy on the school’s intranet forum. When he was done, he saw Zhou Wen lying on the sofa gaming again. He asked, “Aren’t you bored to death gaming all day? All you do is kill those ants. Isn’t it boring?”

“Not at all,” Zhou Wen said without looking up.

“Stop gaming. Join me as I kill the ten Bronze Luck Beasts first. We’ll break the record. Since those special admissions students don’t want to, let’s break it ourselves,” Li Xuan said.

Zhou Wen followed Li Xuan to Restriction City. As for the post, it attracted the attention of someone.

The counselor of the special admissions class, Liu Zhengyan, saw the post titled “A god’s guide to slaying a Bronze Luck Beast in a minute.”
