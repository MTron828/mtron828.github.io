Chapter 1174: It’s Meaningless

“Do you know what it means to completely release the power of the Calamity domain here?” Not Heaven looked at Tsukuyomi in puzzlement. He really didn’t understand why Tsukuyomi was doing this. It didn’t benefit her at all.

Zhou Wen also looked at Tsukuyomi in puzzlement. He never expected her to choose to stand on his side under such circumstances.

“I know the consequences better than you.” As Tsukuyomi spoke, the moonlight on her body became even brighter. The moonlight formed halos that sliced the space around her into many distorted domains.

In the domains, terrifying ghosts appeared. There was Yuki Onna, Hashihime, Daitengu, and Umibōzu, who Zhou Wen was familiar with. There were also many ghosts that Zhou Wen had never seen before.

Instantly, the entire Shinra Temple was filled with ghosts. It was as if it had become a Moonlit Ghost Domain.

However, Zhou Wen could tell that the ghosts weren’t the real Yuki Onna or Daitengu. They were just illusions.

However, the illusions looked extremely real. The ghosts surrounded Tsukuyomi like they were escorting royalty as they majestically marched towards Not Heaven’s Calamity Domain.

The Calamity Domain that could suppress the Moonlight Domain was now suppressed by the moonlight. As the Ghost Parade entourage advanced, the ghostly aura domain shrank even more.

The moment the illusory Night Parade of One Hundred Demons touched Not Heaven’s domain, it immediately devoured the ghostly aura in his domain.

“Are you crazy? With such explosive strength, you will soon be expelled from Earth... Asura Battlefield...” Not Heaven didn’t have the time to finish his sentence. Tsukuyomi’s Ghost Parade was too ferocious. He had no choice but to deal with it with all his might.

Not Heaven’s surroundings turned into an Asura Battlefield domain. There seemed to be countless terrifying Asura Battle Souls roaring and fighting inside.

While the two domains clashed, the power that erupted was unimaginably terrifying. As for the Asura Battlefield domain, it was being devoured by the Ghost Parade domain, becoming smaller and smaller.

Not Heaven’s expression was extremely nasty. He used all his strength to withstand Tsukuyomi’s domain, but the ghostly aura on his body weakened as he constantly retreated.

“Tsukuyomi, are you really not afraid of being expelled from Earth?” Not Heaven shouted as he tried his best to resist Tsukuyomi.

There was only a tiny area left of the Asura Battlefield domain around him, and it was just moments before it was completely devoured. Not Heaven used all his strength to barely hold on, slowing down the speed at which the domain was devoured.

The moonlight on Tsukuyomi’s body became weaker and weaker. She was about to turn into light. She was like a goddess on the moon. Her clothes fluttered with moonlight.

Something’s amiss! Zhou Wen looked at the extremely powerful Tsukuyomi and felt an abnormal power fluctuation. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A strange force gradually appeared on Tsukuyomi’s body. It seemed to be pulling her body, pulling her into the endless void.

“Tsukuyomi, how do you use this token?” Zhou Wen took out the Heavenly Happiness Token and shouted at Tsukuyomi.

Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that the power that wanted to pull Tsukuyomi into the infinite void was the repulsive force that Not Heaven had mentioned.

Although Zhou Wen didn’t know why a powerful existence like Tsukuyomi would die if she left Earth, he didn’t wish for her to leave Earth.

The Heavenly Happiness Token was useless to Zhou Wen. If he could save Tsukuyomi and make her stay, he wouldn’t mind using it now.

“There’s no need.” Tsukuyomi didn’t turn around or take the Heavenly Happiness Token. She only said indifferently, “What will come will come. It’s meaningless to take something that doesn’t belong to me.”

“You’re mad.” The Asura Domain around Not Heaven’s body was about to collapse. He tried his best to resist Tsukuyomi, but the Asura Battlefield domain kept shrinking.

However, Not Heaven’s eyes remained firm as steel as he stared at Tsukuyomi and said, “You have no chance. Before you defeat me, you will be expelled from Earth...”

Not Heaven wasn’t being an alarmist. Tsukuyomi’s entire body was about to turn into moonlight, and the force that was pulling her had already reached her head. It wasn’t affected by her domain at all. Like a black hole that devoured everything, it wanted to devour Tsukuyomi.

“Tsukuyomi, this token is meaningless to me. If you need it, I can cooperate with you to complete the contract,” Zhou Wen said again.

Tsukuyomi suddenly turned her head and smiled brightly at Zhou Wen. “If it’s meaningless to you, it’s meaningless to me as well. When it’s meaningful, you can use it to find me.”

Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi, unsure what she meant.

In the next second, Tsukuyomi turned her head and infinite moonlight erupted from her body. Her entire body completely turned into light as the pure moonlight instantly shattered everything.

Moon—a pure moon. Under the moonlight, everything was purified.

The illusory Hundred Ghosts vanished in the moonlight. The Asura Battlefield also turned to ashes. Not Heaven let out a tragic cry as his body dissipated in the moonlight as though he had melted into it.

Boom!

The stone furnace in Shinra Temple was shattered by the moonlight and turned to dust.

Moonlight filled everyone’s vision, but in the next second, the moon was devoured by the void and instantly vanished.

The moonlight dissipated and Shinra Temple returned to normal. However, there was no sign of Tsukuyomi or Not Heaven. Everything seemed so unreal.

“Tsukuyomi!” Zhou Wen held the Heavenly Happiness Token in his hand as he looked at the spot where Tsukuyomi had vanished with a complicated expression. His face was filled with puzzlement, perplexity, shame, and indignation.

He was ashamed for doubting Tsukuyomi, and he didn’t understand why she had made such a choice. He had already agreed to cooperate with her to use the Heavenly Happiness Token, so why had she given up?

Zhou Wen still didn’t fully understand Tsukuyomi’s final words.

If an Essence Energy Art or Essence Energy Skill were placed in front of Zhou Wen, no matter how difficult it was, he could find a pattern to resolve it. However, there were some things that had no pattern. This was something Zhou Wen wasn’t good at.

While Zhou Wen was still in a daze, he suddenly saw a stone furnace fragment on the ground. Ghost aura rose out of it as the Ghost aura gradually condensed into Not Heaven’s body, allowing him to reappear.

He’s not dead? Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically as he gripped the Immortal Culling Sword tightly.

Not Heaven’s body walked out of the demonic aura again as he looked coldly at Zhou Wen and said, “Unfortunately, she failed to kill me. No one can save you now. If you are obedient, you can suffer less. Otherwise...”

Clang! Clang!

Before Not Heaven could finish his sentence, two hooves suddenly descended from the sky and struck his head, smashing him to the ground.

Not Heaven sprawled on the ground and was dumbfounded when he saw an antelope descend from the sky and shatter the stone furnace that emitted a demonic aura.
