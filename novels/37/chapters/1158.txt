Chapter 1159: Alma Mater

The next morning, An Sheng modified Zhou Wen’s appearance before letting him leave the An family.

Zhou Wen looked at the changes An Sheng had given him and realized that the contours on his face had softened. His hairstyle had also changed a little, but the other changes weren’t too big.

He took Ya’er and Tsukuyomi to Sunset College which was still considered Zhou Wen’s alma mater, even though he hadn’t graduated from there.

Luoyang was relatively intact because there were dimensional zones everywhere around it. Furthermore, there were several layers of dimensional zones below Luoyang City. The whole of Luoyang was equivalent to a massive and complicated dimensional zone. It was difficult for dimensional creatures from the outside world to rush in, so it had become abnormally safe.

As for the various dimensional zones in Luoyang, there were quite a number of dimensional creatures that had breached the restrictions. However, as people were already familiar with these dimensional creatures and with the constant battles over the past five years, they ultimately managed to preserve humanity’s foundation in Luoyang.

Zhou Wen had also read quite a bit of information regarding Luoyang on the Internet. It could be said that Luoyang was a unique existence in the Federation.

Two of the four war gods of the new era were in Luoyang. One was An Tianzuo, and the other was Sunset College’s chancellor, Leng Zongzheng.

It was said that in the past five years, Luoyang had experienced countless break-out battles of all sizes. The biggest reason why humans could always entrench themselves was because of these two guards.

When he arrived at the familiar school entrance again, Zhou Wen felt mixed emotions. Although it had only been five years, the campus had undergone huge changes. Many buildings were new, and even the main entrance was different from before. It had probably been recently renovated.

Although the entire school looked brand new and looked even more grandiose than before, one could tell upon careful thought that the reason the school had undergone a large-scale renovation was definitely not because of aesthetic pursuits, but because it had to be rebuilt.

From this, it could be seen how many terrifying battles this school had experienced to make the entire school look almost brand new.

Just past the school entrance stood the statue of Human Sovereign with his heaven-defying strike. It was similar to the one Zhou Wen had seen before, but it looked even more majestic.

Upon seeing the Human Sovereign statue, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but shake his head and smile bitterly. Humans treated him as their savior and worshiped him like a god. However, he wasn’t thinking too much back then, nor was he thinking of saving humanity. He hadn’t had a choice.

Taking out the pass An Sheng gave him, he successfully took Tsukuyomi and Ya’er into the school.

It was obvious that the guards recognized him and were very respectful. Zhou Wen gathered that this respect was meant for the Zhou Wen, who was acted by An Jing, and not him.

From the looks of it, An Jing must have done quite a number of things while acting as me. Zhou Wen walked into the school and saw a very different scene from the Royal College.

Although this place placed great importance on the cultivation of Companion Beasts, Essence Energy Arts, and Essence Energy Skills, one could also see the shadow of technology. There were also many things that combined Companion Beasts and technology.

Tsukuyomi was very curious when she saw the technological components. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You’re right. The place where you attended school is indeed different from the school we went to previously,” Tsukuyomi said as she looked at the students practicing shooting on the field.

“Yes.” Although Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to admit it, he had to admit that it was mostly thanks to An Tianzuo.

An Tianzuo always placed great importance on scientific research. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had heard that the effects were rather good. The Essence Energy compression accelerator he had created had played a vital role in the early battles during Luoyang’s defense.

However, due to the excessive expenditure of Essence Crystals, the Essence Energy compression accelerator was seldom seen in the subsequent battles.

As An Jing, who impersonated Zhou Wen, had been in the military all year round, ordinary students did not recognize Zhou Wen, only the soldiers who were deployed on campus did.

However, there were many legends about Zhou Wen on campus. He was considered a legend.

When he arrived at the training grounds, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but reminisce about the times he had practiced with Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and company.

Zhou Wen circled the training grounds with Ya’er and Tsukuyomi. Just as he was about to leave, a student came in front of him and said politely, “Senior, can I help you?”

Zhou Wen glanced at the student in front of him. He was about seventeen or eighteen years old, probably in his sophomore or junior year. Although he wasn’t as tall as Zhou Wen, he was still considered tall and handsome.

“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen knew that he had mistaken him for a graduate student, but Zhou Wen could indeed be considered his senior.

“Is this beautiful senior your girlfriend?” The student didn’t answer and instead asked while looking at Tsukuyomi.

“No,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.

“It’s fiancée,” Tsukuyomi added. This time, she didn’t say that she was Zhou Wen’s wife. Instead, she used the word fiancée. He did not know where she learned it from.

“Fiancée? That means you aren’t married?” The boy’s eyes lit up as he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Senior, please fight me. If I win, can you agree to let me have dinner at the cafeteria with her?”

Zhou Wen glanced at Tsukuyomi and saw that she wasn’t angry. Then, he looked at the boy and asked, “What’s your name?”

This boy was actually quite bold to have thoughts of chasing after a Calamity creature. It was unknown if he still had the guts to do so after knowing Tsukuyomi’s true identity.

“Qin Mu.” The boy’s tone was very calm, but from the way he raised his eyebrows, one could tell that he was proud of his name as though he was very famous.

In fact, many students on the training grounds were secretly discussing as they watched. Zhou Wen’s eyes and ears were extremely sensitive, so he quickly figured out Qin Mu’s origins.

Qin Mu was a sophomore, but his strength had already reached the peak of the Legendary stage. He was only half a step away from advancing to the Epic stage.

Although there were many dimensional creatures now, to have such achievements at such a young age made him an outstanding elite in Sunset College.

At this year’s school ranking, Qin Mu had only lost to the president of the student council and was ranked second. From this, one could tell how strong he was.

However, there was another reason why Qin Mu had such strength.

This was because Qin Mu was the younger brother of the famous female sword immortal in Luoyang. Although the female sword immortal’s fame wasn’t comparable to a figure like An Tianzuo, she was also a well-known figure in the Federation. She had never tasted defeat when it came to sword technique.

Speaking of sword techniques in the East District, the most outstanding ones were for males, Ming Xiu, and for females, this female sword immortal.
