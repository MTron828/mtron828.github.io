The antelope walked to the clearing and began digging with its hooves.

Could there be some treasure buried there? Zhou Wen was curious as he burrowed into the grass and quickly arrived beside the clearing.

The antelope dug very quickly. By the time Zhou Wen arrived, it had already dug more than a meter deep. The soil dug out was piled up beside it.

When Zhou Wen saw the soil, he immediately knew why there weren’t any plants growing here. The antelope wasn’t digging out soil, but grayish-black ash. It looked like it was mixed with some form of metallic powder.

He looked into the pit and saw that there was indeed metallic powder underneath.

“Ol’ Ante, what are you digging?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

The antelope ignored him and continued digging.

Zhou Wen thought to himself, This antelope usually acts like a big shot. It sees everything beneath it and is the laziest. It’s like a lord that enjoys life and doesn’t do anything. Now that it’s digging a hole by itself, there must be something good down there.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen said with a smile, “Ol’ Ante, it’s not convenient for you to dig with your hooves. Why don’t I help you dig? If there’s anything good down there, why don’t you share half with me?”

The antelope glanced at him and after some thought, it raised its front hooves and gestured at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was puzzled as he thought to himself, You only have a hoof. There aren’t any fingers. What does your gesturing mean?

Seeing that he didn’t understand, the antelope wrote “20%” on the ground.

Only then did Zhou Wen understand what the antelope meant by its hoof gesture. There was a groove in front of its hooves, making it look like a V. It could also represent two.

“Twenty percent is too little. How about forty-sixty?” The antelope ignored him and continued digging.

“So be it. 20%. I’ll help you dig.” Zhou Wen felt that he had nothing better to do. He could help dig and save time. Furthermore, he could split the benefits. Why not?

The antelope jumped out of the hole and pointed down, indicating for him to dig.

Why would Zhou Wen dig it himself? He summoned Tyrant Behemoth. The two horns on Tyrant Behemoth’s head were like spinning electric drills as it dug at a fast speed.

What surprised Zhou Wen was that the metallic powder below was indeed extraordinary. Despite Tyrant Behemoth’s immense strength, it failed to easily penetrate the metallic powder.

After drilling for a while, it had dug a hole more than ten meters deep. The metallic powder it dug out turned darker and darker like coal.

Furthermore, the metallic powder had a smell. It wasn’t pungent, but it resembled the smell of ink on a newspaper.

“Ol’ Ante, what’s down there? How deep do we have to dig?” Zhou Wen knew that the antelope was very intelligent and could definitely answer him. It depended on its willingness to speak.

The antelope extended its hoof and drew two words on the ground: “Eight meters.”

“There are still eight meters to go? It looks like this digging will go on for a little while longer.” Zhou Wen did some calculations. The metallic powder was getting harder to dig the deeper it went. He estimated that it would have to dig for another forty to fifty minutes.

After some thought, he decided to take out his phone to grind dungeons for a while. He would wait until Tyrant Behemoth dug out the item. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After grinding dungeons for a while, he didn’t get anything good.

The antelope suddenly nudged him with its hooves. Zhou Wen knew that something had been dug out. He walked to the side of the deep pit and looked down. He saw that Tyrant Behemoth had dug a twenty to thirty-meter deep pit.

However, Tyrant Behemoth’s body was too huge. It nearly blocked the entire mouth of the pit. Zhou Wen had no choice but to let it out before looking down.

This time, he saw something in the deep pit. It looked like a wooden stake with a diameter of about fifty to sixty centimeters. It was completely black, but there were tree lines on the surface. It was probably wood.

The antelope pointed at the log and nudged Zhou Wen. Clearly, it wanted Zhou Wen to bring the log up.

Although the log looked huge, Zhou Wen had plenty of strength too. Even if it weighed several tons, it wouldn’t be a problem for him.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to take the risk. He got Tyrant Behemoth to go down and pull out the wooden stake.

Tyrant Behemoth hugged the wooden stake with its claws and pulled with all its might. The wooden stake wasn’t pulled straight out. It only moved a little and rose by ten to twenty centimeters.

Tyrant Behemoth pulled it out bit by bit, revealing more and more of the wooden stake. When the wooden stake was completely out, it was about three meters long.

Tyrant Behemoth placed the wooden stake on the ground. Zhou Wen carefully sized it up and realized that it was indeed a log. It was likely a segment of a certain tree, and the bark was rather pristine.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of log it was. The bark and tree core were black, about the blackness of charcoal, but it wasn’t dirty at all when touched. It was a little cold.

“Ol’ Ante, is this the treasure?” Zhou Wen asked the antelope.

The antelope nodded and circled the log a few times as though it was examining something.

What’s the use of this log? Zhou Wen didn’t discover anything special about it. Apart from being a little black and heavy, it didn’t seem to be anything special.

The antelope pointed at the log and then at Zhou Wen’s shoulder, indicating for him to carry it.

“If you don’t have a place to put it, I’ll help you store it. Ask me when you need it,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.

The antelope glanced at Zhou Wen, making him feel a little uncertain. However, he never expected the antelope to nod in agreement.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he reached out to lift the log. He realized that it wasn’t as heavy as he imagined. He could still lift it.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that he wouldn’t be able to lift it since Tyrant Behemoth had exerted so much strength to pull it out.

After opening the chaos space, Zhou Wen placed the large log piece inside.

“Ol’ Ante, what’s the use of that log? Tell me.” Zhou Wen wanted to obtain some information from the antelope. Otherwise, it would be useless even if the entire log was his.

The antelope ignored him and crawled out of the grass before returning along the path. Clearly, it was here to dig up the log and didn’t plan on disturbing Zhou Wen’s advance.

After returning to the fork, Zhou Wen took the correct path and continued heading for Imperial Capital.

After walking for a while, Zhou Wen suddenly felt something amiss. He felt uncomfortable, but he couldn’t tell what was wrong.

Am I reading too much into it? Zhou Wen carefully checked his surroundings with Truth Listener, but he didn’t discover any problems.

After a long journey, he entered a city. That’s when Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss. This was because the people walking towards him, be they men or women, were looking at him with strange eyes. Some women were even giggling at his face.

What’s going on? Zhou Wen was puzzled. Although he felt that he was good looking, his handsomeness wasn’t to the point of being loved by everyone. To be such a head-turner with a 100% rate creeped him out a little.
