Chapter 1713 Golden Elixir Pills?

“It’s indeed not bad to be able to advance ordinary Companion Beasts to Mythical Companion Beasts.” Zhou Wen implied that Mythical Companion Beasts were no longer of much use at their level.

“How do you know that this thing can only advance Companion Beasts to the Mythical stage?” Liu Yun wasn’t convinced. He summoned a Terror-grade Companion Beast and let it enter the metal container.

Zhou Wen didn’t believe that this thing could evolve a Terror-grade Companion Beast into a Calamity. In that case, a Calamity would have been too pedestrian.

The metal container trembled again, but even when it stopped trembling, Liu Yun’s Companion Beast didn’t come out.

“What’s wrong? Don’t tell me the Companion Beast was devoured by the metal container?” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun in puzzlement.

Liu Yun’s expression was somewhat alarmed before it turned from shock to pleasant surprise. Then, he laughed out loud.

“Could this fellow have gone mad from anger?” Zhou Wen said with a slight frown.

“You’re the one who’s crazy,” Liu Yun said excitedly as he summoned his Companion Beast out of the metal container. The Companion Beast had really advanced from the Terror grade to the Calamity grade. “No way? It really advanced to the Calamity grade!” Zhou Wen was somewhat taken aback.

“That’s not all. Look at this.” Liu Yun was so happy that he started becoming incoherent. He reached into the metal container.

Soon, Liu Yun pulled out his hand again. He held something in his palm.

“Take a look. Do you know what these are?” Liu Yun spread out his hand and saw three circular crystals of different sizes in his palm. The small one was about the size of a pigeon egg, and the big ones were like duck eggs. They swirled with rainbow colors as though they had some strange fragrance. “What are they?” Zhou Wen didn’t think they were Essence Energy Crystals, nor did they look like Zone Cores. He didn’t know what they were.

“Haha, let me tell you. Don’t be envious, jealous, or hateful. These are all treasures among treasures. Just now, my Terror-grade Companion Beast only ate something the size of a bean and advanced to the Calamity grade. The two advanced to the Mythical stage from taking a sniff. Furthermore, there weren’t any side effects. There are three more here, and each one is many times bigger than the other... Haha... Be envious... Be jealous... Unfortunately, you were too late. These treasures are all mine...” Liu Yun was so excited that he was almost incoherent.

“There’s such a thing?” Zhou Wen gaped in envy.

“I get it. The metal container must be Taishang Laojun’s pill furnace. These are immortal pills refined by Taishang Laojun... Perhaps it’s the legendary Nine Revolutions Golden Elixir Pill...” As Liu Yun spoke, his eyes suddenly lit up. He stared at the three crystals in his hand and muttered to himself, “These things seem indiscriminate. They can be used by any Companion Beast. I wonder if they can be used on humans?”

Liu Yun was fanatical about advancing to the Calamity grade, but Jing Daoxian refused to let him take shortcuts, nor was he to accept resources from the dimension. Therefore, Liu Yun had been working hard, but he was still a distance away from advancing to the Calamity grade.

Now that three treasures were suddenly placed in front of him, how could he not let his imagination run wild?

Furthermore, looking at the attributes of the three Companion Beasts after their evolution, not only could they evolve Companion Beasts, but the attributes they had after evolution were excellent. They weren’t inferior to Companion Beasts that evolved with Zone Cores.

“You’ll know when you eat it,” Zhou Wen said casually.

To his surprise, Liu Yun stared at the crystal in his hand for a while before throwing the smallest one into his mouth.

“Holy sh*t, do you have a death wish? You actually dare eat something like that? Taishang Laojun’s Golden Elixir Pill? Is Kunlun related to Taishang Laojun?” Zhou Wen was alarmed. Although the item was good, it wasn’t something one should randomly eat.

What was an elixir to Companion Beasts might be a poison that penetrated the intestines of humans.

“How is it unrelated? Legend has it that Kunlun is the Holy Land of Daoism. I know what I’m doing.” Liu Yun didn’t mind at all as though he was confident.

Just as he said that, Zhou Wen saw Liu Yun’s skin turn crystalline as though a colorful light was seeping out.

Liu Yun wore an excited and surprised expression. He reached out and swallowed the two big ones as well.

Just as he swallowed the two crystals, a strange glow rose from Liu Yun’s body. It was as though an immortal aura was spewing out, emitting a strange fragrance.

Liu Yun circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art as his body shimmered with starlight, as though he was the center of the universe. Countless stars revolved around him like a miniature universe.

The pocket universe was originally a monotonous white color. As the immortal aura fused into it, it gradually turned into a gorgeous color. The energy contained in it became more and more terrifying.

It really works? Could it really be Taishang Laojun’s Golden Elixir Pills? Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. Liu Yun was clearly condensing a Calamity Zone to advance to the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen truly regretted it. If he had done it earlier, these treasures would have been his.

Soon, Liu Yun’s Calamity Zone condensed and he officially advanced to the Calamity grade.

“Haha, Junior Brother, my dear Junior Brother, to think that you would have such a day. You’ve finally lost to me, right? Not only did this thing advance me to the Calamity grade, but the Calamity Zone I condensed is also the best among the best...” Liu Yun laughed at the sky, looking smug as though he was an emperor who had conquered a kingdom.

“Congratulations, Eldest Senior Brother,” Zhou Wen said as he couldn’t help but glance into the cave.

Since there was such an item in the cave, there might be more. Even he was tempted by such a treasure.

The two of them exchanged looks and instantly understood what each other was thinking. Almost at the same time, they rushed into the cave.

Although the immortal sword was good, that wasn’t something they could definitely get their hands on. The treasures here were real. If Taishang Laojun’s alchemy room was really inside, wouldn’t they make a killing?

Thinking of what Monkey Sun had done after entering Taishang Laojun’s alchemy room, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun wanted to carry out such a heist.

The two of them rushed into the cave one after another. Thankfully, they were relatively rational people and weren’t blinded by benefits. They were very careful and even summoned several Companion Beasts to scout ahead.

To their surprise, although this path was rugged and long, it wasn’t dangerous at all. The two of them proceeded carefully without anything happening. After a long while, they finally reached the end of the cave and crawled out of a hole to find themselves inside a stone chamber.

There were no dimensional creatures in the stone chamber. The two of them observed the stone chamber and as they looked around, their expressions turned odd.

The decorations in the stone chamber were very simple, almost without any decorations. There was a hole on the ground, and on both sides of the hole were two stone slabs that extended from the ground. From the shape of the hole, the metal container from before was likely embedded in this hole.

They connected such a setup with something bad.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
