Chapter 1367: Becoming a Devil or Buddha?

The flames on the muslin robe turned into butterflies that flew out. Everything that touched the flames burned. The surroundings instantly turned into a purple flaming world: flaming forest, flaming rivers, flaming mountains—everything was ignited. The original Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array had turned into a pure flaming array.

Hermit’s expression changed drastically as he attempted to stop the Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array from circulating, but he realized that it was completely useless. It brought with it endless energy, making it unstoppable.

Seeing that the bhikkhuni was already approaching, Hermit and Cave Era attempted to rush out, but they realized that they were trapped in the Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array. Unable to rush out, they were truly trapped.

“Didn’t you just say that the Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array contains all matter in the world? Your strength is naturally included, so you can’t leave either. Don’t you remember what you said?” Wei Ge said with a smile.

“Wei Ge, why aren’t you uncasting your fire powers to escape? After the bhikkhuni becomes a devil, the first person to be killed will be you,” Hermit said.

“Have you seen a devil who’s afraid of death? To have two of you die with me is considered a blessing for me,” Wei Ge said indifferently.

The bhikkhuni was close. Hermit and Cave Era couldn’t afford to waste any more time. They attacked Wei Ge with all their might, hoping to break through the array and escape.

However, Wei Ge’s Nihility Fire didn’t focus on powerful explosive strength. Instead, it focused on burning and nothingness. It took an unorthodox path and reached an extreme effect.

If it was a fair battle, Wei Ge might not be able to defeat Cave Era, but it wouldn’t be easy for them to injure Wei Ge.

Furthermore, they didn’t have the time. Cave Era and Hermit were alarmed and furious as they shouted, “Wei Ge, why aren’t you uncasting the array? Do you really want to die together?”

“What benefits will mutual destruction bring you? I’ll tell you a secret regarding Balrog, allowing your Balrog to really have a chance of advancing to the Calamity grade…”

“Open…”

The veins on Hermit’s forehead protruded as he roared.

However, Wei Ge remained unmoved. He danced in the flaming world like a flaming butterfly. No matter how terrifying Hermit and Cave Era’s attacks were, they couldn’t injure him at all.

At that moment, the bhikkhuni finally walked into the array, but the flames of the array were surprisingly unable to touch her robes. She walked all the way as though she was untainted by the mortal world.

It’s over!?Hermit and Cave Era’s hearts turned cold.

However, Wei Ge remained calm as before. He transformed into flames and arrived near the bhikkhuni.

“Come. It’s extremely comforting to know that I’m lucky enough to let a Buddha degenerate into a devil.” Wei Ge spread open his hands and waited for the bhikkhuni to become a devil, like a devil lord who nurtured devils with blood.

Hermit and Cave Era were alarmed. Even they couldn’t completely suppress their fear of death.

The bhikkhuni was a Calamity-grade existence. If she became a devil here, all of them would die. They wouldn’t even have a chance to escape.

However, in the next second, the bhikkhuni’s actions left everyone dumbfounded. Wei Ge froze.

The bhikkhuni looked at Wei Ge and calmly sat down. She slowly closed her eyes as her body emitted a Buddhistic glow. Her body gradually changed into the appearance of Buddha.

The Buddhistic glow illuminated everything. Everything that encountered the Buddhistic glow returned to its original natural state.

The flames extinguished as the trees bloomed and the river flowed. Greenery spread over the mountains as flowers bloomed everywhere.

“She… is about to become a Buddha…” Hermit was indescribably shocked.

He really couldn’t believe such a ridiculous thing. A person like Wei Ge who had his hands stained with blood had actually made her become a Buddha instead of a devil when facing him.

“No… Impossible…” Wei Ge was dumbfounded as well. How could a person like him be someone who could make the bhikkhuni Buddha? Even he didn’t believe that he was a good person.

More importantly, once the bhikkhuni became a Buddha, she would be harmless and wouldn’t harm anyone. It was very likely that she would tear through the air and leave Earth immediately.

Without the help of the bhikkhuni, Wei Ge was no match for Cave Era and Hermit. All his plans were in vain.

Wei Ge gritted his teeth and rushed forward to use his flames to burn the bhikkhuni, hoping to use violence to degenerate her into a devil.

However, when his flames burned on the bhikkhuni, her Buddhistic glow intensified as her body rapidly transformed into a Buddha.

“F*cking become a devil!” Wei Ge angrily threw a punch at the bhikkhuni’s face, but his fist was blocked by the Buddhistic glow over the bhikkhuni’s body.

The bhikkhuni had already transformed into Buddha. She nodded at Wei Ge with a smile before slowly rising into the void under the Buddhistic glow. She tore out of Earth and vanished. The scene of calamity that accompanied her vanished.

F*ck…?The feeling in Wei Ge’s heart was indescribable. He mechanically turned to look at Cave Era and Hermit, only to see them looking at him with killing intent written all over their faces. Furthermore, they had already surrounded him.

“Will you believe me if I say that this is all a misunderstanding?” Wei Ge said wryly.

“Guess?” Hermit stared coldly at Wei Ge and blocked his escape.

Cave Era stood in front of Wei Ge with a nasty expression. If not for the accident, their lives would have been ended by Wei Ge.

“Director-General Wei, I’ve really underestimated you. However, don’t worry. This time, I’ll definitely do my best to send you to the place you wish to go.” Hermit’s expression was sinister as a strange light swirled around his body. The power of his Terror transformation had already been pushed to its limits.

Wei Ge cursed inwardly.?The heavens really want me dead. To think that I wanted a close victory, but I lost before I could even start.

“There’s no need to trouble the two of you about sending him where he wants to go.” A figure appeared beside Wei Ge.

“Zhou Wen!” Hermit and Cave Era’s expressions changed.

“What a coincidence. I thought you wouldn’t make it.” Wei Ge finally heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Zhou Wen.

As Wei Ge had received the news too late and couldn’t contact Zhou Wen, he had no choice but to think of a way to take the risk to send the news to An Sheng. It was unknown if An Sheng believed him, the Monarch Bee. It was also a question if he could contact Zhou Wen and get him to return. He originally didn’t have much hope, but he never expected Zhou Wen to really rush back. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I’ve been back for quite some time. I couldn’t bear to disturb you when I saw how engrossed you were in your performance, so I watched for a while,” Zhou Wen answered.

Wei Ge looked at Zhou Wen in a daze. Now, he had the urge to get the female Buddha to take Zhou Wen away.

“One each. You get first dibs.” Zhou Wen gripped his Bamboo Blade tightly and looked at Cave Era and Hermit.

“I’m not a particular person, nor am I a gentleman. Leave hitting women to me,” Wei Ge said as he looked at Cave Era.

“Alright, this is mine.” Zhou Wen walked towards Cave Era.
