Chapter 1291: Sword Against Two Bigwigs

“A scam… This is too much of a f*cking scam… He wants to scam both sides…”

“Isn’t he afraid that he will bite off more than he can chew? At the same time, he’ll be offending both the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association. Can he still survive on Earth in the future?”

“He’s already on Venus. There’s no need for him to stay on Earth.”

“This isn’t about being shameless anymore. It’s a scam!”

“Don’t tell me he really wants to defeat the president of the Holy Spirit Association and Lord Immortal of the League of Guardians at the same time?”

“In any case, I don’t believe it. That’s too ridiculous. Ignoring Ya’s injuries, that Immortal is like a god. It’s hard to say if he can defeat him.”

When people came to a realization of what was happening, the Internet immediately broke out into a furor. All sorts of messages kept appearing as the scrolling text on the screen overlapped layer by layer. It made it impossible to read the messages.

“Impressive… Really impressive… To be able to claim that he’s honest despite scamming both sides… I’m not as thick-skinned as him…” Liu Yun sighed.

Zhou Wen had already moved and instantly charged at Ya like a phantom.

Zhou Wen held the Son of Heaven’s Sword with both hands and slashed at Ya.

Although Zhou Wen wanted to help Ya, he couldn’t give others the impression that he was a member of the Holy Spirit Association because of him aiding Ya. He also couldn’t have others make the connection that Looter King was Zhou Wen, so he had tried his best to craft an image of Looter King.

Thankfully, due to the matter of him picking up items in the Venusian dimensional zone, Looter King’s reputation wasn’t that good to begin with. It was very easy for people to accept his current image.

Clang!

The Primordial Immortal Sword in Ya’s hand blocked Zhou Wen’s Son of Heaven’s Sword, but due to his serious injuries, the strength he accumulated had begun to decline. How could he be Zhou Wen’s match? He was sent flying by the strike.

Zhou Wen showed no mercy as the Son of Heaven’s Sword in his hand slashed at Ya like a tempest.

Ya held Primordial Immortal Sword and fought Zhou Wen with all his might, but his injuries were just too serious. Blood constantly flowed out of his chest. The bleeding was secondary; the injuries caused by the Calamity-grade bullet had weakened his vitality. His strength and speed naturally began to weaken.

Bang!

Ya’s body exploded from Zhou Wen’s strike, turning into a shattered puppet.

Ya couldn’t withstand Zhou Wen’s attack and could only use Substitute.

This was only an ordinary Substitute Skill. It was different from the Substitute he used to block the seventh Calamity shot. The Substitute that blocked the seventh Calamity shot was an Intrinsic Substitute of his. It was different from ordinary one-time Substitutes.

Ordinary Substitutes could block the first six shots, but it was impossible for them to block the fatal seventh shot. Although the Intrinsic Substitute could block the seventh shot, it only did so barely. It had even left Ya seriously injured.

If it were anyone else, Ya’s Substitute spell would be very useful, but Zhou Wen also knew the Substitute spell very well. He knew how to draw Substitute Talismans himself. Although his wasn’t as powerful as Ya’s Substitute spell, it followed the same principle.

Therefore, Zhou Wen knew the minute signs of the Substitute spell. When Ya used Substitute Puppet again, Zhou Wen circled around it and instantly appeared in front of Ya. The Son of Heaven’s Sword stabbed into his chest like a bolt of lightning, piercing through his already injured chest.

Then, he sent Ya flying with a kick. Blood spewed out of Ya’s chest as his body flew out and slammed into Venus. It left a huge crater in the ground like a meteor.

Everyone was dumbfounded. They never expected the Looter King to be so straightforward. He attacked as he pleased. The dignified president of the Holy Spirit Association had been beaten to a pulp in the blink of an eye. From the looks of his injuries, it was unlikely he could survive.

“President…” Ox Demon struggled to get to his feet in a bid to fight Zhou Wen to the death, but his injuries were too serious. After taking a few steps, he fell to the ground and again tried his best to get up. He looked at Zhou Wen as though he wanted to eat him alive.

True Martial struggled to stand up, but when he saw Ya’s penetrated chest, he spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted from anger.

Liu Yun was also dumbfounded. He never expected Zhou Wen to be ruthless to the point of killing Zhong Ziya.

However, Liu Yun felt that something was amiss. He frowned and fell silent.

“Lord Immortal, are you satisfied with my work?” Zhou Wen turned around and flew towards Immortal as he asked with a smile.

“Not bad,” Immortal said.

“As long as you’re satisfied. Now that I’ve completed the deal with you, it’s time to complete the deal with President Ya. I’m a person who values integrity the most. I’ll definitely do a good job once I accept the deal. Don’t blame me,” Zhou Wen said as he thrust the Son of Heaven’s Sword at Immortal.

His strike was somewhat different from the sword technique he had used in the battle with Ya.

Zhou Wen had already noticed something from Immortal’s battle with Ox Demon. Immortal was also a spatial-type expert. Even if he didn’t employ a pure spatial-type Essence Energy Art, he at least had spatial-type abilities.

Ox Demon failed to touch Immortal despite his terrifying punch. It looked like he had taken the initiative to avoid Immortal.

In fact, that wasn’t the case. Zhou Wen, who was rather proficient in spatial powers, knew that it wasn’t that Ox Demon had avoided Immortal, but that Immortal had used spatial powers to distort the space around him. It looked like Ox Demon had avoided him, but in fact, space had changed the direction in which he hit.

To be able to do so, Immortal’s spatial powers were rather terrifying. However, his spatial powers clearly went in a different direction from Zhou Wen and Liu Yun’s.

When Zhou Wen stabbed out, the Son of Heaven’s Sword already contained the power of the Singularity Universe which pinpointed Immortal’s location. Even if he distorted space, he couldn’t change the final destination of the Son of Heaven’s Sword.

After the Son of Heaven’s Sword approached Immortal, it looked like it followed the same deviant trajectory as Ox Demon. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, when fighting Ox Demon, Immortal—who stood there and allowed Ox Demon to attack him without moving—moved because of Zhou Wen’s strike. He dodged Zhou Wen’s strike by moving to the side.

“Looter King is really strong. He’s not just capable of looting treasures. Ox Demon had attacked so many times, but not once did he force Immortal to move. Just one strike from Looter King has forced Immortal to dodge. This is the difference.”

“Who is this Looter King? Why was there no sign of him before? It’s as though he jumped out from a crack in a rock. Isn’t he too strong?”

“I don’t know. Anyway, among the humans I know, other than Human Sovereign, this Looter King is the strongest.”

As people discussed, Zhou Wen had fully unleashed his sword technique. Like a surging heavenly river, it slashed at Immortal.

Immortal’s figure was elegant as he calmly dodged Zhou Wen’s attack. Zhou Wen’s sword technique failed to touch the corner of his clothes, but under the pressure of Zhou Wen’s sword technique, Immortal also failed to find a chance to counterattack.
