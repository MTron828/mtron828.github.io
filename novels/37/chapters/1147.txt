Chapter 1148: Sword of Tomorrow

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen frowned slightly. The Guardian was clearly targeting them, and it was highly likely that he was here for Ming Xiu.

Zhou Wen had been missing for many years and had just returned inland. Not many people knew him. Even if his enemies recognized him, they shouldn’t have taken action so quickly. At the very least, they would investigate his current situation.

The Guardian didn’t deliberately hide his aura. As he approached, Ming Xiu also sensed his arrival.

The Guardian stopped in front of the lounge door. Although the door was closed, it didn’t affect his vision at all. He looked at Ming Xiu through the door and said, “Swordsman Tomorrow, I’ve heard so much about you. Do you dare accept my challenge?”

With the Guardian’s arrival, many students also discovered him. They whispered in the distance but didn’t dare approach. Clearly, they knew the Guardian.

“I wouldn’t dare,” Ming Xiu said with a smile.

“Tomorrow and Wind Trace are known as the two peerless masters of swords and sabers. No one can surpass them with swords and sabers. I also use swords and believe that my sword arts are alright. If I can’t win in ten strikes, it will be considered my loss,” the Guardian continued.

“You’ve already won.” Ming Xiu was no longer the competitive youth from before. He spoke casually without any signs of being moved.

“I never expected the famous Swordsman Tomorrow to be a coward. You don’t even have the courage to accept a challenge. From the looks of it, the so-called invincible Tomorrow Sword Art is just an exaggeration that serves as self-consolation for humans. A sword art created by humans ultimately can’t live up to the required standards,” the Guardian continued goading.

This time, Ming Xiu didn’t back down. He didn’t care about his reputation, but there were some things he absolutely couldn’t allow others to taint.

“Coach, please wait a moment. I’ll be back soon,” Ming Xiu said to Zhou Wen before getting up to open the door.

The students watching from afar became excited when they saw Ming Xiu come out.

The Guardian’s name was Judge, and the person he contracted was Buzz. He was a very famous Guardian of the Cape family and was also a member of the League of Guardians. Although he hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade, he had already gained some fame in the Federation with the ability, Sword of Judgment.

Ming Xiu had once killed a branch leader of the League of Guardians and destroyed a plan hatched in the East District by the league. That Guardian was also a member of the Cape family.

Although there were rumors in the outside world that Ming Xiu had once killed a Terror-grade dimensional creature, no one had seen it with their own eyes. The League of Guardians had also analyzed Ming Xiu, believing that he was still at the Mythical stage and hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade. The rumors of him killing a Terror creature previously weren’t credible.

When Buzz saw Ming Xiu come out, his eyes lit up.

If he could defeat Ming Xiu, not only would he be able to avenge the Cape family, but his name would also resound across the Federation.

This was because in the battle when Zhou Wen was conferred the title of sovereign, humans were totally against Guardians. Even if they could accept a half-human like Ya, even if they were willing to treat the mutated humans who used the Mythical Serum as a part of humanity, they were unwilling to accept pure humans who contracted Guardians.

This made humans very resistant towards the League of Guardians. It also infuriated the humans who had contracted Guardians.

They had clearly obtained powerful strength, but they were unable to obtain the recognition of their fellow species.

For a human like Ming Xiu who used Mythical Serum, the fame and anticipation he obtained were things that a contractor like Buzz couldn’t enjoy.

Even within the Cape family, these youths from the Royal Academy were more willing to worship Ming Xiu than Buzz and his Guardian.

Furthermore, people would only mention Judge when talking about him. Ordinary people couldn’t even remember Buzz’s name.

Buzz looked forward to the reaction of those who idolized Ming Xiu after he defeated him.

Ever since Ming Xiu accepted Royal College’s invitation, Buzz had been looking forward to it. He had already asked a professional analyst in the League of Guardians to help him do the analysis. His ability had a certain restraining effect on Ming Xiu. As long as Ming Xiu didn’t advance to the Terror grade, his chances of winning were more than 70%.

Ming Xiu’s Tomorrow Sword Art gave people the illusion that they could block his sword, but if they really blocked it, they would realize that the strike came later than they imagined.

The Sword of Judgment could slice through illusions and aim right at the core. Even if Buzz made a mistake, the Sword of Judgment could accurately block Ming Xiu’s sword. Therefore, Ming Xiu was at an absolute disadvantage against him.

“The Royal College’s arena should be able to allow us to fight with our full strength,” Buzz said as he looked at Ming Xiu.

“There’s no need. Let’s do it here.” Ming Xiu reached out to grab his hilt.

“Here?” Buzz frowned slightly. This was the lounge. There were students and tutors nearby. With their strength, fighting here would probably affect many people.

After all, the Royal College was the Cape family’s school. Buzz was also a member of the Cape family, so he naturally had his reservations. He thought that Ming Xiu wanted to use this to threaten him.

“Yes, right here,” Ming Xiu said as he drew his sword.

The moment the sword was unsheathed, Buzz’s pupils constricted. He still wanted to retreat, but he only took half a step before stopping.

As for Ming Xiu, he had already sheathed his sword. He turned around, pushed open the door, and entered the lounge behind him.

Only when Ming Xiu turned around and pushed open the door did the students and tutors not far away see the sword flash, piercing through Buzz’s abdomen.

Only then did the wound on the standing Buzz’s abdomen split open. Blood immediately gushed out. He hurriedly covered the wound with his hand as his face turned pale. Without a word, he turned around and left. He had to immediately treat his injuries or he would die there and then.

The students watched in a daze as Buzz retreated in a sorry state. When they looked at Ming Xiu again, they realized that he had already entered the lounge and could only see the tightly shut door.

“The sword kills before the flash is seen. This sword is just too fast.”

“Swordsman Tomorrow lives up to his reputation.”

“Judge can be considered a famous Guardian. He actually lost in one strike. It’s too terrifying.”

...

“Coach, sorry to have kept you waiting,” Ming Xiu said apologetically when he returned to the lounge.

“Your Tomorrow Sword Art can be considered as having achieved some level of mastery,” Zhou Wen said.

If anyone else said such words, they would only be considered arrogant. However, when Zhou Wen said it, Ming Xiu’s eyes lit up.

“Coach, can you teach me how to proceed in the future?” Ming Xiu asked sincerely.

Before Zhou Wen could say a word, Tsukuyomi suddenly said, “There are plenty of tomorrows, each one coming after the other that tomorrow never comes. When actually is your tomorrow?”

When Ming Xiu heard that, he was stunned. His eyes stared straight ahead, but he wasn’t looking at anything. He stood there motionless as though he had lost his focus.
