Chapter 961: Sea God Reef

“Why are you still loitering around? What if the child gets injured? Don’t you know the severity of the matter? Thankfully, a powerful human expert killed those giant crabs. Otherwise, if they were to rush into the city and something happened to the child, I’d like to see how you explain it to your wife when you return.” The middle-aged man bumped Zhou Wen again and reprimanded him.

“I’ll leave now,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said, knowing that he meant well.

“Stay at home and take care of the child. Children are our future,” the middle-aged man lectured Zhou Wen again. Before leaving, he didn’t forget to remind Zhou Wen to return. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhou Wen carried the child and headed for a city gate in an opposite direction. He still needed to visit Sea God Reef. His luck today seemed pretty good. He had a feeling that he might find the tiny palm symbol.

The Sea God Reef was also known as the Dragon King Reef by the locals. Every time the tide receded, one could see a dragon-shaped reef surface above the sea like a divine dragon undulating over the sea.

Legend had it that the reef was originally formed by a divine dragon. As there were restrictions in the world, sea dragons couldn’t go ashore. However, the divine dragon’s newborn child was caught by a fisherman during one of its playful escapades.

In order to save its child, the divine dragon ignored the restrictions and rushed onto land to snatch back its child. However, because it had violated the restriction, it turned into a rock before returning to the sea. It had been left here ever since.

This was originally just a legend. Later, after the dimensional storms, an area near Sea God Reef became a dimensional zone. Many terrifying dimensional creatures appeared inside.

No one had really landed on Sea God Reef to this day. It was unknown if the Sea God Reef had transformed back into a divine dragon.

Now, Sea God Reef couldn’t be seen from the beach. In the shallow sea, there were many shrimp soldiers and crab generals. They were all powerful Epic existences. Legend had it that deeper in the Sea God Reef was the Turtle Minister, a powerful dimensional creature at the Mythical stage.

Of course, no one dared to enter the deep sea, so they didn’t know if these legends were true.

There weren’t many people from Sea Return City who dared enter Sea God Reed. Zhou Wen didn’t encounter anyone when he arrived.

Before coming, Zhou Wen had contacted Li Xuan, but his call didn’t connect. The latter was probably in a dimensional zone.

“Young man, why aren’t you listening to my advice at all? Why are you running around with a child?” Zhou Wen had just arrived at the periphery of the Sea God Reef dimensional zone when he heard a familiar voice.

He turned his head and saw that it was indeed the middle-aged man from before.

“Brother, what a coincidence. Why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked the middle-aged man with a smile.

“The crabs that came ashore this time might be related to Sea God Reef, so I came to investigate. I say, what’s wrong with you? You’re already an adult and even have a child. Why can’t you weigh up the consequences?” the middle-aged man asked.

“This is my sister,” Zhou Wen explained.

“Then even more reason why you shouldn’t bring her to such a dangerous place. Your mother is already so old. How much effort and risk did she endure to give birth to a daughter? If anything happens, how are you going to answer your parents?” The middle-aged man tried his best to educate Zhou Wen.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to explain, he suddenly heard a dragon’s roar coming from the sea. The two of them subconsciously turned their heads and saw that the dragon’s roar was coming from the direction of Sea God Reef.

However, as they were still in the area outside the dimensional zone, the sea was covered in fog. They couldn’t see anything clearly. They could only find out by walking in.

“Quickly send your sister back. If you want to take risks, do it yourself. Don’t joke around with the child’s safety,” the middle-aged man exhorted Zhou Wen before running towards Sea God Reef.

“Brother, we don’t know what’s going on inside. It’s best you don’t enter,” Zhou Wen reminded him out of goodwill.

“My job is to investigate the nearby dimensional zones. If there’s any danger, I have to sound the warning ahead of time. Go back quickly. I have to figure out what happened here,” the middle-aged man said as he rushed into the dimensional zone.

Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on entering and only wanted to search for the tiny palm symbol outside. However, seeing that the middle-aged man wasn’t a bad person, he thought for a moment and decided to enter. If anything really happened, he could help him.

In this day and age, there weren’t many people who were willing to care about others. Zhou Wen really didn’t want anything to happen to him.

He walked into the fog with Ya’er in his arms. The fog looked so thick that it couldn’t be dispelled, but when Zhou Wen walked in, he saw a beautiful golden beach.

The middle-aged man was standing on the beach, staring blankly at the sea.

Zhou Wen traced his gaze and his eyes lit up. He saw a golden divine dragon frolicking in the seawater. Its scales seemed to be gilded as they shimmered with a mysterious glow under the sunlight.

Zhou Wen had his fair share of grand experiences. He had seen many dragons and had killed some before. He quickly reacted and hurriedly used Grand Turtle Aura to converge his aura to the limits to prevent himself from attracting the golden dragon’s attention.

The aura on the golden dragon was comparable to the white dragon Zhou Wen had seen at the bottom of Dragon’s Well. They were extremely terrifying existences, so Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to fight it without understanding its abilities.

The golden dragon didn’t seem to care about the insect-like humans as it swam in the sea. It seemed to be in a good mood.

The middle-aged man snapped out of his shock. Clearly, he knew very well that he was nothing compared to the golden dragon. He slowly retreated, hoping to leave the Sea God Reef dimensional zone.

After taking a few steps back, he saw Zhou Wen hugging Ya’er. His expression changed immediately.

Zhou Wen hurriedly gestured for him to remain silent to prevent him from alarming the golden dragon.

Thankfully, the middle-aged man wasn’t stupid. He knew that he couldn’t alarm the golden dragon, so he didn’t plan on speaking. He held back his tirade on Zhou Wen.

The two of them slowly retreated. They didn’t dare to retreat too quickly as they moved step by step.

However, not long after, the golden dragon seemed to sense something and turned to look at Zhou Wen and company.

The dragon’s golden, crystalline eyes lit up when it saw them. Then, half its body extended out of the sea and stared at them.

We’re doomed! The man’s heart trembled. Being targeted by such a terrifying creature, his chances of survival were slim.

The golden dragon stared at them for a while before suddenly raising its head and letting out a shocking dragon roar.

Accompanying the dragon roar, the originally calm surface of the sea instantly broke into turmoil. Then, Zhou Wen and the middle-aged man saw rows of strange-looking shrimp soldiers and crab generals rush up the coast.

“Leave quickly...” The middle-aged man pulled Zhou Wen and turned to rush out of the dimensional zone.

However, when he turned his head, he saw rows of shrimp soldiers and crab generals standing behind them at some point in time. They had long sealed off their retreat.
