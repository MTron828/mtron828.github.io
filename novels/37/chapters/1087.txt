Chapter 1088: Substitute Fighter

On the hilt of the sword, the words “Immortal Culling” were engraved.

Is this thing for real? Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he looked at the ancient sword. He found it unbelievable that it was the real Immortal Culling Sword.

If one were to look at the two words “Immortal Culling” alone, they weren’t anything impressive. They were even a little tacky. However, if one added the word “sword” behind the two words, it would be a little terrifying.

If there were three swords beside this sword—Immortal Vanquishing, Immortal Entrapment, and Immortal Peril—it would be even more terrifying.

The legendary Four Swords of Immortal Vanquishing were a terrifying existence that had truly killed all immortals and fiends. They were the most powerful Dharma treasure of the legendary Sect Master.

It was difficult to describe how powerful the four swords were. In comparison, an existence like the Nine-Tailed Fox in Chess Mountain was no different from a chicken waiting to be slaughtered in front of the real Immortal Culling Sword.

Any one of the powerful existences that the four swords had killed could defeat the Nine-Tailed Fox.

Ignoring the four swords, just any one of them would probably make Zhou Wen invincible on Earth if he could completely master them.

Of course, the premise was that this sword was really the Immortal Culling Sword. This ancient sword might only share the same name as the legendary one.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare take the risk. He summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to pick up the sword.

Immortal Culling Sword didn’t react at all. Tyrant Behemoth brandished it twice, but it didn’t discover any special energy fluctuations. It didn’t have the same might as before.

How did that ratman control it? With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned the Earth Elemental Beast and chased after the ratman with Immortal Culling Sword.

Regardless of whether this sword was the real Immortal Culling Sword or not, it possessed rather powerful strength. If he could figure out how to control it, it would be of great help.

Banana Fairy’s fan had blown the ratman far away. Zhou Wen followed the huge trail left by the wind and ran for hundreds of kilometers before he finally lost track of the trail. However, he didn’t see the strange ratman either.

It’s not dead? Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to search the vicinity, but he didn’t find any traces of the ratman. He wanted to return to Paradise Mountain.

However, after walking for a long time, he couldn’t even see Paradise Mountain. It was as if it had vanished into thin air.

Zhou Wen knew that it would probably be very difficult to find Paradise Mountain again. All he could do was switch on his phone. He had successfully downloaded the Paradise Mountain dungeon and entered it in-game.

There were many gray-robed rats in-game, so Zhou Wen had a great time killing them.

Soon, thirteen red-robed rats appeared. Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to waste time with them. He got Demonic Neonate to release the Demonic Sword and killed them.

A few dimensional crystals dropped. After Zhou Wen absorbed the dimensional crystals, his Strength reached 67, his Speed reached 71, his Constitution reached 54, and his Essence Energy reached 70.

However, Zhou Wen’s mind was still on the strange ratman. Without carefully looking at his stats, he led Demonic Neonate up the mountain.

What puzzled Zhou Wen was that he didn’t see the strange ratman atop Paradise Mountain.

There was a hole at the top of the mountain. It was the size of a bowl, but when he looked inside, it was bottomless, as though there was no end.

Zhou Wen summoned the Earth Elemental Beast to go down, but after crawling for a long time, it failed to reach the bottom. It was as though there was no bottom.

How strange. What’s going on? Zhou Wen knew that there was definitely something wrong with the hole. Otherwise, with the Earth Elemental Beast’s speed, it would have probably crawled to the other side of Earth in half a day.

He thought of all sorts of solutions and even got Banana Fairy to inject wind in. However, the terrifying Supreme Yin Wind vanished without a trace. He had no idea how deep the hole was.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to take the Immortal Culling Sword with him. He planned on returning to Luoyang first.

Along the way, Zhou Wen grinded all sorts of Mythical creatures in-game. He planned on raising his stats. After all, having a powerful body was the foundation. He would have an advantage in battle.

...

On the cube’s arena, a white beam descended from the sky. In the white beam was a faint shadow.

After the light descended, it landed on Jiuyue’s body and vanished in a flash.

“What was that?”

“I didn’t see it clearly. Is it a Companion Beast summoned by Jiuyue?”

“Some kind of skill?”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. They were momentarily unsure what it was.

Zhong Ziya looked at Jiuyue and frowned.

Jiuyue’s pupils turned white. Although nothing else had changed, his aura was clearly different.

“Who are you?” Zhong Ziya asked Jiuyue.

“You aren’t worthy of knowing my name,” Jiuyue replied indifferently as he looked at Zhong Ziya.

With that said, most people understood what was going on.

“Holy sh*t, that works? Aren’t those fellows from the dimension too shameless?”

“They aren’t satisfied with a tag-team battle, and are now using substitutes?”

“How f*cking disgusting. Although I don’t like people like Ya, I hate shameless people even more.”

“Ya, kill him.”

The Federation was in a frenzy. Even the devils overseas didn’t look happy.

“They really don’t treat us humans as people,” Uesugi Nao muttered to herself with a cold expression. If she could enter the arena now, she would help him regardless of which faction Ya belonged to.

Many people had the same thoughts as Uesugi Nao, but humans weren’t dimensional creatures. No one could break the rules of the cube.

However, Zhong Ziya didn’t show any emotions. He just said calmly, “Alright. Anyway, I don’t have the habit of remembering the names of losers.”

“Ignorance is also a form of bliss. Cherish your last moments of happiness.” Jiuyue wasn’t angry as he slowly raised his palm.

There was no shocking glow on his palm. With a casual grab, Zhong Ziya, who was thousands of meters away, somehow appeared in front of him and was grabbed by the neck.

It felt as if the space between them had vanished.

Crack! Ya’s neck snapped as his head fell.

However, Ya’s decapitated body exploded into a white fog, turning into a beheaded puppet that fell to the ground.

The spectators broke out into a cold sweat before feeling relieved. Now, most humans hoped that Ya could win.

Jiuyue seemed to have expected this. He grabbed again and Ya, who had just reappeared, appeared in front of him again. The space between the two of them vanished just like that.

Clang!

This time, it was Ya’s true body. He raised Primordial Immortal Sword and blocked Jiuyue’s palm, but Jiuyue’s palm grabbed the sword along with his neck, lifting them up together.
