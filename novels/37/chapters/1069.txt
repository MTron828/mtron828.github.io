Chapter 1070: The Cause of the Catastrophe

Translator: CKtalon

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right. It was no wonder the bigwigs of the dimension said that Earth would be doomed once the strongest Companion Beast was found.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall a scene after a chick broke out of its shell. It seemed like some fledglings ate their eggshells.

Ice Maiden also seemed to have thought of something, and her expression became extremely strange. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

That’s not right. If Earth is a Companion Egg, wouldn’t we be able to find the Companion Beast inside as long as we keep digging? There’s no need to spend so much time searching, right?

As Zhou Wen thought about it, he suddenly thought of something. Could it be that the ship that tore through the sky and broke apart the supercontinent was planning to crack the Companion Egg and search for the Companion Beast inside the Earth? If that’s the case, they clearly didn’t succeed. What stopped them?

Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind, but he didn’t know which was the correct answer.

While Zhou Wen was still pondering, Wei Ge’s flaming ax slashed at the toad.

“Bunny, stop him,” Zhou Wen shouted at Jade Rabbit.

Jade Rabbit was somewhat hesitant, but when it saw Zhou Wen raise the Elixir of Immortality in his hand, it immediately took action. It took out the jade pestle and transformed into the huge rabbit in its Terror state. It smashed it at Wei Ge.

The flaming ax in Wei Ge’s hand rose and collided with the huge jade pestle that Jade Rabbit had smashed down.

With a boom, a terrifying shock wave instantly destroyed everything nearby.

Zhou Wen was sent flying as the space suit turned to dust, revealing the Galaxy Shell Dragon Armor inside.

With Absolute Defense, Zhou Wen survived the terrifying blast.

Jade Rabbit’s strength was extremely terrifying. The jade pestle constantly struck out, showing zero disadvantage when facing Wei Ge head-on. It even had the upper hand.

This surprised Zhou Wen greatly. This was because Jade Rabbit had previously been restrained by the Seven Seas Dragon King, preventing it from unleashing its true strength. This had given Zhou Wen the illusion that it wasn’t very strong.

From the looks of it, the strength of the Jade Rabbit far exceeded the dark-gold toad.

On second thoughts, Zhou Wen came to a realization. The logger could fell the Tree of Immortality, and Jade Rabbit could also use the Tree of Immortality as a medicinal ingredient.

It would be impossible for an existence that could shatter the Tree of Immortality to be weak.

As long as it wasn’t restrained, Jade Rabbit’s strength was just too terrifying.

Zhou Wen wore the Shell Dragon Armor, so the radiation and environment on the moon couldn’t harm him. The boiling point on the moon was very low, so if ordinary people didn’t have space suits to protect them. Their blood would boil, making it impossible for them to survive.

With the protection of the Shell Dragon Armor, he didn’t have to worry about this. However, he hadn’t reached a state where he could survive without oxygen. Without oxygen for a long period of time, he would still die.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s Chaos Bead had many space suits and oxygen supplies, so he didn’t have to worry.

Now wasn’t the time to change into his space suit. Zhou Wen quickly retreated to prevent himself from being drawn into the terrifying battle.

Chang’e and Ice Maiden were also sent flying. They had been severely injured, so they were unable to transform into their Terror forms for the time being and could no longer participate in the battle.

Zhou Wen didn’t give the Elixir of Immortality to Chang’e. If Jade Rabbit could suppress the logger, he could save one Elixir of Immortality.

“Jade Rabbit can’t stop the logger. Give the Elixir of Immortality to Chang’e and get her to help Jade Rabbit.” Moon Goddess’s ethereal voice suddenly entered Zhou Wen’s ears.

“Moon Goddess, didn’t you say that with your token, Jade Rabbit wouldn’t do anything to me? I was nearly killed by Jade Rabbit,” Zhou Wen said coldly.

Moon Goddess’s voice remained as gentle as before. “If I hadn’t said that, would you have gone? I also knew that it would be extremely dangerous, but if you hadn’t made the trip, there’d really be no hope for the Moon.”

“Don’t tell me you really thought that I could defeat the Terror-grade Jade Rabbit and obtain its Elixir of Immortality?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.

“I didn’t expect you to defeat Jade Rabbit either, but if you want the Elixir of Immortality, you don’t necessarily have to defeat it. Others might not be able to do it, but you might be able to,” Moon Goddess said faintly.

“You sure have confidence in me. I’m not that confident of myself,” Zhou Wen mocked.

Moon Goddess said with a smile, “Didn’t you do it? Furthermore, you did it better than I imagined. Not only did you obtain the Elixirs of Immortality, but you also brought the Jade Rabbit over and made it assist you.”

“That’s because I’m lucky. What if I’m unlucky?” Zhou Wen snorted coldly.

“If you aren’t lucky, there won’t be anyone in this world with good luck,” Moon Goddess said.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“Have you ever bowed at a temple?” Moon Goddess asked.

“So what if I did?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as Moon Goddess seemed to know something.

“No, you haven’t bowed before because no temple’s deity will dare to accept your bow. Even I don’t dare,” Moon Goddess said.

“Why won’t any deities accept my bow? What’s so different about my Life Providence?” Zhou Wen finally confirmed that Moon Goddess knew something.

“I don’t know.”

Zhou Wen couldn’t accept the Moon Goddess’s answer.

“What an answer,” Zhou Wen said coldly.

“There’s no need for you to be angry. If I could completely see through your Life Providence, I wouldn’t be afraid of being worshiped by you. I can only tell that there’s something wrong with it. It shouldn’t be your Life Providence, but a Life Providence formed due to the influence of external forces. Furthermore, that Life Providence is too ferocious. If I were to receive your bow, I’m afraid I would be plagued by calamities and catastrophes. Even deities would suffer greatly,” Moon Goddess said.

Zhou Wen didn’t wish to harp on this matter as he asked, “Chang’e said that the Moon is a Companion Egg. Is that true?”

“Yes, the same for Earth too. However, you don’t have to worry. Earth is different from others. The Companion Beast inside won’t be born so easily.” Moon Goddess seemed to know what Zhou Wen wanted to ask.

“What’s the difference?” Zhou Wen asked.

“If the Companion Beast on the Moon wants to be born, it has to wait until the Tree of Immortality dies. Otherwise, it will never be born. By the same logic, if the Companion Beast on Earth wants to be born, it needs similar conditions. However, up to now, no creature knows what those conditions are,” Moon Goddess said.

“Since the Companion Beast is inside the Earth, can’t we just dig it out?” Zhou Wen asked the question plaguing him. Earth wasn’t difficult to dig.

“A terrifying existence from another dimension tried it before. It was an existence even more terrifying than us, but in the end, Earth still remained intact, but the terrifying existence from the dimension disappeared,” Moon Goddess said.

“Is the terrifying existence you mentioned the owner of a ship?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he hurriedly asked.

“You actually know of the existence of that ship?” Moon Goddess was slightly surprised.

“Is it really that ship? What kind of creature is the owner of that ship?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I don’t know. A ship tore through the sky, causing the ground to split apart and floods to occur. The world was almost destroyed, and then the ship vanished deep into the crevice in the ground. From then on, it never appeared again. No one knows who the owner of the ship is.” As the Moon Goddess spoke, she suddenly changed the topic. “Quickly feed Chang’e the Elixir of Immortality. The logger is about to forcefully cut down the Tree of Immortality. Jade Rabbit can’t stop him. Only Chang’e’s power can.”
