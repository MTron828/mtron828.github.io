Chapter 755: The Might of One Saber Strike

Translator: CKtalon

His body ruptured as his flesh split open. Blood constantly flowed out, but Zhou Wen remained calm. He gripped the Bamboo Blade tightly with both hands as he focused his insights into it. He raised the Bamboo Blade high above his head.

Old Master Xia’s heart palpitated as though he sensed danger. His expression turned solemn as he stared intently at Zhou Wen.

The wounds on Zhou Wen’s body kept cracking, but his expression was as calm as before. He exerted strength with both hands and slashed down, aiming for Old Master Xia.

With this strike, the crazily erupting power in Zhou Wen’s body was instantly drained. It gathered on the blade, causing Bamboo Blade’s body to tremble. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Old Master Xia couldn’t see the trajectory of the saber when it landed. He was shocked and his body immediately phased away.

Bam!

Old Master Xia’s body was split into two, turning into clear water that splattered on the ground.

Elsewhere, Old Master Xia’s true body appeared. However, the Guardian armor on his body was shattering. From his helmet to his armor, a saber gash appeared.

An invisible saber force continued to press down on the armor, causing it to crack from top to bottom. Old Master Xia’s blood was also gushing out.

Crack!

The Guardian armor on Old Master Xia’s body had shattered due to the blow. It turned into pieces of black jade that scattered to the ground, revealing Old Master Xia’s true body.

His body phased away again and appeared again shortly after. He must have used the Yin Yang Universe Ring’s ability.

However, when he appeared, the saber marks on his body were still spreading. It went from his head to his chest and then to his abdomen. The bloody mark constantly expanding as more and more blood oozed out.

Old Master Xia’s almost immortal Connate Dominance Body couldn’t stop the saber marks on his body from deepening, nor could it heal his wounds.

Old Master Xia watched as the saber marks on his body continued to tear, and his skull was about to split open. His expression turned somewhat crazy and in disbelief.

“Impossible... No power can take my life... My Connate Great Emperor Sutra is the strongest...”

Zhou Wen had converged the Sigh of the King’s power. His Slaughterer Life Soul had automatically turned still. During the slash, the Slaughterer Life Soul had automatically fused into Zhou Wen’s strike. Slaughterer, which had only been passively augmenting Zhou Wen, had actively shown its effects for the first time.

After shattering the Guardian armor, a strange force fused into the Slaughterer Life Soul, but it failed to advance as it did before.

Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange. The advancement of a Life Soul at higher levels was difficult to begin with. The last time he killed a Guardian, he had allowed Slaughterer to advance to an Evolved Body. It was obvious that killing one Guardian wasn’t enough to advance to a Perfect Body.

The strike had already drained Zhou Wen of all his combat strength.

In particular, his body had been severely damaged by the Sigh of the King. It was difficult for him to even stand.

Zhou Wen stared at Slaughterer as the power of the strike continued to work wonders. It was about to rip Old Master Xia’s bones into two.

Without the Guardian’s power, no matter how strong Old Master Xia was, he was only at the Epic stage. Zhou Wen believed that it was impossible for him to withstand the terrifying saber force.

The saber force wasn’t only limited to the Sigh of the King; it also had Slaughterer’s strength embedded within. Zhou Wen felt that the strength of the strike wouldn’t vanish unless it killed its opponent.

Boom!

At this moment, a sudden bolt of lightning struck the top of Old Master Xia’s head.

The purple lightning bathed Old Master Xia’s body and actually shattered the saber force in Old Master Xia’s body. The strange purple lightning also fused into his body at the same time, as if a purple shadow was flashing across his body.

The moment the saber shattered, Old Master Xia’s injuries began to rapidly recover. What was even more terrifying was that his body was rapidly transforming. It looked like he was transforming from the Epic stage to the Mythical stage.

Are you f*cking kidding me? I carried you all the way here and suffered so much, but you actually helped that old sicko deal with me? Zhou Wen felt indignant.

He could clearly see that the purple lightning didn’t smite down from the void, but shot out from the log on the roof of the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

“Haha, I’m indeed a person blessed by the heavens. Even the heavens want to help me advance to the Mythical stage. It used divine lightning to condense another soul for me so that I can advance to the Mythical stage. Who in the world can stop me? I, Xia Jiuhuang, am the Emperor of Heaven. No one can stop me from becoming a god.” Old Master Xia threw his head back and laughed. The nine Life Souls on his body were faintly discernible as terrifying power spewed out from his body. His body was rapidly transforming.

As if responding to Old Master Xia, the thunder in the sky rumbled like a 21-gun salute.

Zhou Wen sat weakly on the ground. He didn’t have the strength to continue fighting. If Old Master Xia really managed to advance, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have the strength to fight him.

However, the name Xia Jiuhuang finally made Zhou Wen know who Old Master Xia was. This name wasn’t only known to the Xia family, but it was also famous in the entire Federation. He was one of the six heroes who founded the Federation, the founder of the Xia family, the supposedly deceased legendary hero, Xia Jiuhuang.

At that moment, Xia Jiuhuang’s aura had reached its peak. His body had almost turned crystalline jade as his Essence Energy spewed out like a volcanic eruption. The nine Life Providences and the power of the nine Life Souls fused as one, and an ancient ‘Emperor’ word gradually surfaced on his forehead.

The ‘Emperor’ word shimmered with purple lightning as though it was a supreme existence.

Zhou Wen could naturally guess that the purple word “Emperor” was likely the Wheel of Destiny condensed by Xia Jiuhuang. Once the Wheel of Destiny stabilized, he would have successfully advanced to the Mythical stage.

Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate and Truth Listener. At this point, all he could do was risk his life and strike Xia Jiuhuang down to the mortal world before he completed the transformation to the Mythical stage.

Just Demonic Neonate’s strength was clearly insufficient. Zhou Wen could only consider letting Truth Listener shatter more earrings. He needed to shatter at least three of them, but Zhou Wen couldn’t predict the outcome.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to order Truth Listener to shatter the earrings, he realized that something was amiss with Xia Jiuhuang’s condition. There was a faint power throbbing in his body, like a rhythmic heartbeat.

Although this power wasn’t powerful and seemed to be a part of Xia Jiuhuang’s body, it was sending Zhou Wen some kind of message.

Primordial Spore! Zhou Wen immediately knew what it was. It was the Primordial Spore that Zhou Wen had previously sent into Xia Jiuhang’s body.

Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised. Typically, Primordial Spore would take a long time to parasitize a Mythical creature, but the information sent by Primordial Spore seemed to be telling Zhou Wen that it was already sprouting.
