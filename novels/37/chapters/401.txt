Chapter 402 Luck Composition

Apart from eating at the cafeteria and bringing Wang Lu breakfast, Zhou Wen hardly left the house.

With the baby tiger, the efficiency of grinding increased significantly. The dimensional crystals and Companion Beasts that dropped had improved significantly, be it in terms of quantity or quality.

+5 Luck really shows an obvious improvement. If I have a few more points, wouldn’t the drop rate double? Zhou Wen thought about where to get another pet that added luck.

Due to the Lucky Baby Tiger’s Life Providence being unique, even if he had one more baby tiger, the luck wouldn’t stack. Therefore, it was useless even if Zhou Wen went to Binyang Cave to grind for the baby tiger again.

Wait a minute. The Lucky Baby Tiger’s Life Providence can’t be stacked, but can it be synthesized? When two different Companion Beasts combine, they might produce a different Life Providence. Just like when I fused the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Sky Spider Youngling, the King of Low Altitudes became the King of Sky. If I were to fuse the baby tiger with some other cat or dog, would I be able to turn it into a lucky cat or something? Would it be stackable? Zhou Wen was considering the viability of this matter.

If he could really synthesize one like this, he could completely synthesize the luck-type Life Providence with another powerful Companion Beast. It would give him a luck bonus and powerful combat ability.

Zhou Wen was only thinking about it. He couldn’t have the blood-colored avatar die, nor could he refresh dungeons. All his thoughts were empty thoughts, making it impossible for him to farm the baby tiger.

As he hadn’t refreshed the dungeon, Zhou Wen had nearly wiped out all the monsters he could grind in the past few days. He was about to reach a point of not having any monsters to grind on. This was the first time he had encountered such a situation since obtaining the mysterious phone.

Although there were also instance dungeons he had never been before, such as Mount Laojun, Zhou Wen didn’t dare visit them as he was afraid the blood-colored avatar would die inside.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen had many books to read, so it wasn’t that he had nothing to do. He was engrossed in an ocean of knowledge every day.

...

Zheng Tianlun felt like crying. He originally believed that using his relationship as a fellow schoolmate, it wouldn’t be difficult to get a strand of Zhou Wen’s hair. In the beginning, he had sought out the Xuanwen Club members who were closer to Zhou Wen. He claimed that the student council wanted to host a joint activity with them, hoping that Li Xuan and Zhou Wen could participate.

He was responsible for all the expenses. For this, he spent a large sum to get some special dimensional zones passes.

However, to his surprise, Li Xuan told him that Zhou Wen was in seclusion and refused to participate in any activities. In the end, the joint activity was held. He had spent the money but failed to see Zhou Wen.

What do I do? What do I do? Zheng Tianlun was extremely anxious. There was less than a day left. He had to obtain Zhou Wen’s hair as soon as possible. He didn’t dare imagine the outcome of failure and dared not remember the tragic state of the stray dog. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Zheng Tianlun had thought of many methods, but they were unviable. Finally, he had no choice but to find Zhou Wen himself. He had to obtain a strand of Zhou Wen’s hair no matter what.

...

Zhou Wen was reading a book near the balcony on the second floor. The sunlight shone on him, making him feel warm and comfortable.

As he wore the Truth Listener earring in its companion form the entire time, Zhou Wen heard Zheng Tianlun’s approach before he even reached the yard’s entrance.

Why is he here? Zhou Wen was puzzled. Zheng Tianlun was clearly walking towards his building and was about to reach his yard’s entrance.

“I have to get his hair... I have to get it...” Zhou Wen listened carefully and heard Zheng Tianlun muttering to himself. It was so soft that ordinary people might not be able to hear it even if they stood beside him. However, Truth Listener’s hearing was just too good. Zhou Wen heard him clearly.

Whose hair does he want? Mine? What does he want my hair for? Zhou Wen immediately made some bad connections.

There were many magical dimensional forces in the League. Legend had it that some people in the West District had curse-type Primordial Energy Skills that allowed them to curse a person to death remotely through mediums such as a person’s hair and nails.

There were many similar abilities in the East District, and they were even more exaggerated. There was no need for any physical contact. Just knowing the time someone was born was enough to take their life, even from a great distance away.

Zhou Wen currently didn’t have much knowledge regarding such Primordial Energy Skills. In a real battle, be it an Epic human or Companion Beast, he had the power to contend a fight. Instead, he was afraid of powers that he could succumb to without even seeing.

Against such powers, even if he had the annihilative powers, it would be of no use considering how he couldn’t find or hit his target.

For instance, many powerful Epic experts died without even seeing a dimensional creature while exploring dimensional zones. It wasn’t that they weren’t strong enough, but that their resistance against the unknown force was too weak. They were nothing but boors who were unable to use their strength.

Of course, there were boors that succeeded. Legend had it that the Xia family’s hero had cultivated the Invincible Connate Divine Art in the past, reaching an invulnerable state. No matter how evil power it was, nothing could kill him. He was a classic example of being able to be a ramrod that could charge straight forward.

However, he ultimately didn’t end well when he entered a dimensional zone.

Therefore, Zhou Wen always firmly believed that knowing one’s enemy was the key to winning all battles. It was best if he didn’t take any risks; after all, he only had one life.

While Zhou Wen was pondering over it, Zheng Tianlun had already pressed his doorbell.

It looks like the people from the bureau have arrived. Zhou Wen had guessed what was going on. After some thought, he went down and opened the door. He wanted to find out from Zheng Tianlun about the person whom the bureau had sent.

“Zheng Tianlun, why are you looking for me?” Zhou Wen asked Zheng Tianlun who was outside.

“I have an important matter to discuss with you. Can I come in?” Zheng Tianlun asked carefully.

“Come on in.” Zhou Wen kept a high alert the entire time. He didn’t get too close to Zheng Tianlun, maintaining a certain distance.

To his surprise, Zheng Tianlun slammed the door shut after entering and plopped to his knees. “Zhou Wen, please save me. If you don’t save me, I’m dead.”

“What are you doing?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.

Zheng Tianlun said, “The night before yesterday, I applied for leave and went home. On the way, I bumped into a strange middle-aged man...”

Zheng Tianlun recounted what had happened that night. No matter how he thought about it, he knew it was impossible to get Zhou Wen’s hair by force. He knew that Zhou Wen was from the An family, so he couldn’t afford to offend him, nor could he use force.

“Zhou Wen, I’m begging you, save me. I really don’t want to die.” Zheng Tianlun kowtowed as he spoke.

Zhou Wen reached out to stop Zheng Tianlun. Although he didn’t have a good impression of Zheng Tianlun, he didn’t have any feud with him either. He felt uneasy hearing the pleading.

However, just as his hand touched Zheng Tianlun’s hand, Zheng Tianlun’s flesh and bones exploded and his arms turned into a bloody mist.
