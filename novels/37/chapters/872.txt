Chapter 873: Purple Bronze Pill Furnace

Translator: CKtalon

As soon as the elder entered the hall, the stone sword immediately emitted a terrifying sword beam that wanted to kill the elder on the spot.

The elder looked at the stone sword’s sword beam as his body underwent an earth-shattering change. His flesh, blood, skin, and clothes instantly took on the form of jade. It was as though his entire body had turned into a strange jade statue.

The sword beam struck the elder’s jade-like body, but it was shattered by a single wave of his hand.

Terror transformation! Zhou Wen was alarmed. The elder could shatter the stone sword’s sword beam. It clearly meant that he was a Terror grade expert.

The stone sword unsheathed itself without any hesitation and slashed at the elder with an invisible sword beam.

The jade-like elder suddenly extended his hands to grab the stone sword. For a moment, there was a stalemate. The stone sword couldn’t stab any further, but the elder couldn’t repel the stone sword either. The man and sword were in a stalemate.

“Who is this old fellow? He can actually withstand the power of the stone sword!” Liu Yun said in surprise.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t say a word. With a flash, he charged into the palace.

Liu Yun also reacted and gritted his teeth before rushing into the palace.

The stone sword and the jade-like elder were in a stalemate. They had no strength to stop Zhou Wen and Liu Yun. In the blink of an eye, the two of them had rushed into the hall with the bamboo slips.

Seeing that the elder was still in a stalemate with the stone sword, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to rush further in. He casually took down a bamboo slip from the rack and opened it.

When he saw the content was laws and regulations, he randomly picked a few bamboo slips on different shelves to take a look. They were all the same. He couldn’t help but find it odd.

I heard that back then, Emperor Qin believed in the Art of Longevity that warlocks advocated. I originally imagined that the books he buried with him were related to alchemy and the Art of Longevity. I never expected them to be law books. Zhou Wen casually flipped through them as he walked and realized that there were no records related to alchemy. They were all about laws.

“Junior Brother, why aren’t you leaving? What’s so interesting about those bamboo slips?” Liu Yun also flipped through a few scrolls. Seeing that they were all laws and regulations, he lost interest.

Zhou Wen put down the bamboo slips and quickened his pace. He and Liu Yun walked to the back of the palace and saw another door. However, it had already been opened. It was clearly Jing Daoxian’s work.

There was a jade screen blocking the door. The two of them circled around the screen, and the scene that greeted them left them surprised.

There were shattered bronze and jade fragments everywhere on the ground, as though a huge battle had ensued. However, there was no sign of anyone, nor were there any doors that led to other places.

“There might be a secret door,” Liu Yun said as he searched the walls, hoping to find a secret door.

“Stop looking. Look at the water in the pool. Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen pointed at a pool.

The water in the pool was black like ink, but there was no strange smell. It probably wasn’t black because of a change in water quality.

“Are you saying that there’s a path beneath the pool?” Liu Yun sized up the pool, but the water in the pool was too dark. He couldn’t see anything clearly.

“I don’t know if there’s a path down there, but there shouldn’t be a secret door in this palace.” Zhou Wen had already scanned the entire palace with Truth Listener. If there was a secret door, it was impossible for him not to have discovered it.

“Should we go down?” Liu Yun was somewhat hesitant.

“I’m afraid that’s our only choice.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he looked outside and saw that the elder had rushed in.

The stone sword chased after him unlike its reaction to Jing Daoxian’s entry. Wherever the sword beam went, almost everything was destroyed.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen jumped into the pool with Ya’er in his arms.

The Azure Dragon’s Seven Mansions Essence Energy Skill activated as though an Azure Dragon was circling his body, repelling the black liquid outside.

Liu Yun gritted his teeth and jumped down with Zhou Wen.

Strangely enough, the black water in the pool didn’t seem to have any buoyancy. They rapidly plummeted the moment they entered. Furthermore, their speed increased as though there was a force pulling them down.

Bam!

When Zhou Wen’s and Liu Yun’s feet touched solid ground, the powerful impact nearly fractured their legs.

Before they could see their surroundings clearly, two more shadows descended from above. One of them was the jade-like elder, while the other was the stone sword.

The moment the stone sword landed, thousands of sword beams shot out from the sword, enveloping the area.

Zhou Wen and Liu Yun quickly dodged. Zhou Wen somersaulted and hid behind a huge object. The object blocked the stone sword’s sword beam. The storm-like sword beams struck the object, but they failed to shatter it.

Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the thing he was using to seek refuge was a huge pill furnace. It was more than ten meters tall and looked like it was made of copper.

However, it wasn’t the commonly-seen bronze of that era, but a type of purple bronze.

The sword beam struck the purple bronze pill furnace, causing it to produce a din. However, it failed to damage the pill furnace at all.

Zhou Wen looked into the pill furnace and realized that it was filled with flames. The flames inside were already burning white, and the temperature was unimaginably high. However, the purple bronze pill furnace only felt warm, not scorching hot.

Strange, I’ve never heard of a pill furnace having flames inside. The flames should be beneath it to heat the furnace’s interior. Why is this furnace burning on the inside? Zhou Wen found it odd.

As the stone sword fought the elder, Zhou Wen took the opportunity to size up the surrounding environment. Only then did he discover in surprise that this was the peak of a mountain.

In the huge, pitch-black underground space, a mountain peak occupied a large space. They stood at the top of the mountain, only twenty to thirty meters away from the stone dome above them.

The surroundings were pitch-black. As the space was so large and there was no light, only the flames that emitted from the purple bronze furnace’s ventilation hole emitted light. This made the distant areas even darker.

The area that Truth Listener could sense was empty. However, a cold wind blew from afar. Furthermore, the wind was very strong, causing Zhou Wen’s clothes to stick to his body as the cold wind drilled into his bones.

Where did Jing Daoxian go? Zhou Wen carried Ya’er and turned his back to the cold wind. After searching for a while, he didn’t find Jing Daoxian.

Liu Yun rushed behind the pill furnace and rendezvoused with Zhou Wen. He said, “There’s nothing on this mountaintop. There’s only a pill furnace. Do you think the pill furnace contains the Elixir of Immortality refined by the emperor?”

“I don’t think so. Otherwise, why isn’t Jing Daoxian here?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he suddenly heard a loud rumbling sound from afar as though it was thunder.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
