Chapter 1182: The Last Torture Chamber

Zhou Wen realized that there were fewer of the living dead in Netherworld City than the last time he came. He didn’t see Chu He either.

Could it be that Chu He’s soul has already dissipated and can no longer be revived? Zhou Wen knew that the living dead in Netherworld City would constantly revive and repeat a life of torture.

However, every time they died, a portion of their memories would be erased.

Now that Chu He had vanished, it was highly likely that he was completely dead and had no chance of reviving.

“Ah!”

Just as Zhou Wen was observing, he heard a tragic cry. However, this time, it wasn’t from Li Xuan, but Lu Bushun.

Zhou Wen turned his head and saw that Lu Bushun wasn’t in the torture chamber. He had already arrived outside, but he was slumped there with his two hands covering his head. His body trembled violently as he let out a horrified cry.

“Old Lu, are you alright? You are already out.” The officer who had a good relationship with Lu Bushun immediately pounced forward and shook his hand.

Gradually, Lu Bushun recovered. His eyes focused again as he became angry.

He stopped screaming and his body stopped trembling. However, his hand still trembled involuntarily.

“Overseer, I’ll rest for two minutes before we continue,” Lu Bushun said as he struggled to stand up.

“There’s no need to continue. Rest,” An Tianzuo said.

“Overseer, I can do it. I just need to rest for a while,” Lu Bushun hurriedly said.

“That shall be all. It’s an order,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.

“Yes, Overseer.” Lu Bushun saluted and had no choice but to stop.

In fact, Lu Bushun knew very well that it was very difficult for him to continue. Even if he continued experiencing the tortures, he probably wouldn’t be able to last more than a few chambers before he went crazy.

Looking at Li Xuan again, he realized that he had already exceeded him by more than twenty torture chambers. Although he could hear Li Xuan’s tragic cries, Li Xuan still persisted. He showed no signs of Lu Bushun’s situation.

An Tianzuo glanced at Lu Bushun’s chamber. It was the 134th torture chamber. There were still more than a hundred chambers from the 239th torture chamber, but Lu Bushun was at his limits. The difference was just too great.

And ahead, Li Xuan happened to come out of the torture chamber. He was still bickering with Zhou Wen, showing no signs of Lu Bushun’s situation.

“The Li family’s three brothers aren’t simple. Unfortunately, the Li family’s eldest brother died too early. Otherwise, the Li family would definitely have been a hegemon,” An Tianzuo said with a sigh.

“Li Xuan and Young Master Wen have an extremely good relationship. The Li family will likely help Luoyang in the future. This is a good thing,” An Sheng said.

“That depends on whether we can return alive.” An Tianzuo also knew that there would be great danger this time.

“With you and Young Master Wen around, we will definitely be able to return alive,” An Sheng said firmly.

An Tianzuo didn’t say a word as he looked at Zhou Wen and Li Xuan in front of him. Whether they could enter the true Netherworld now depended on them. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Li Xuan entered the torture chamber again. Although he was still chatting and laughing, Zhou Wen could sense that he was under immense pressure.

Being tortured repeatedly was different from being tortured by a random punishment. The damage to one’s mind and soul constantly accumulated. Even if one rested for an hour, it was impossible to expel all the buildup.

He could only rely on his psyche and beliefs to persist. There was no other way.

Li Xuan’s screams were still tragic, but it additionally chilled the hearts of those who heard him.

Zhou Wen knew that he was truly in pain, and it was the kind that was produced when he was close to his limits.

There are still 23 torture chambers left. The torture chambers will open another three times today. Adding to this instance, there’s more than enough time. Let’s see if Li Xuan can last to the end. Zhou Wen counted the remaining torture chambers.

“Do you want to rest for a while? There’s still plenty of time,” Zhou Wen asked after some thought when he saw Li Xuan come out.

Li Xuan shook his head. He wasn’t injured, but his face was pale. However, there was a strange red flush on his pale face.

“Continue,” Li Xuan said as he walked to the next torture chamber.

An Tianzuo and company had already rushed over. When they saw Li Xuan being tortured, their hearts skipped a beat.

Even a veteran soldier like Lu Bushun couldn’t withstand the pain of the punishments. He had long broken down.

The fact that Li Xuan could last until now had already impressed them. However, Li Xuan’s situation seemed to be worsening. They were somewhat worried if Li Xuan could reach the end.

When Li Xuan came out again, he nearly fell to the ground.

Zhou Wen was quick to react and went forward to help him up.

Li Xuan wasn’t injured and he still had strength left, but his mind was in a terrible mental state.

“How many torture chambers are there left?” Li Xuan asked again.

“Twenty-two,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Continue.” Li Xuan pushed Zhou Wen’s hand away and walked in.

This time, the torture chamber was the torture of the hot pillar. After Li Xuan entered, he was tied to the iron pillar with his hands and feet hugging it. His face and body were stuck to it.

Sizzle!

White smoke rose from Li Xuan’s body and a burnt smell accompanied it. In an instant, Li Xuan had lost his human form. Just looking at him made one’s legs go limp, much less Li Xuan, who was being tortured. It was difficult to imagine how much pain he was in.

But now, Li Xuan stopped screaming.

Zhou Wen ordered the punishment ghosts to speed up, but the torture of the hot pillar needed one to endure it for ten minutes. Even if the punishment ghosts wanted to speed it up, they couldn’t do so.

“Lend him to me. Any condition is fine.” Zhou Wen came in front of An Tianzuo and pointed at An Jingyu.

He wasn’t good at accelerating time, so he could only seek help from others to accelerate Li Xuan’s torture.

“This is my family’s business to begin with,” An Tianzuo said before ordering, “Jingyu, cooperate with them to complete the remaining punishments.”

“Yes.” An Jingyu quickly stepped forward and used Time Acceleration on the hot pillar.

However, Time Acceleration could only accelerate time, but it couldn’t shorten it. Li Xuan still suffered the same pain.

As time accelerated, a black carapace suddenly appeared on Li Xuan’s body and quickly enveloped him.

Zhou Wen’s heart tightened when he saw the carapace on Li Xuan’s body.

Li Xuan’s Life Soul and Wheel of Destiny were unique. Other people’s Life Souls and Wheel of Destiny were separate, but his was one. It was somewhat similar to Zhou Wen’s situation, but it wasn’t completely the same.

The carapace could be said to be his second life. The appearance of the carapace meant that Li Xuan was indeed reaching his limits.

After the carapace appeared, Li Xuan’s condition improved significantly. After enduring the punishment of hot pillar, he walked straight to the next torture chamber.

He was in a much better state. He went to the torture chambers one after another without any hesitation.

One couldn’t see his expression under the carapace, but one could tell from his trembling body that he was enduring the pain with all his might. He didn’t even dare say a word, afraid that he would lose the grit the moment he opened his mouth, losing the courage to continue the journey.

Seeing that there was only one torture chamber left, Zhou Wen and company were extremely nervous. The last torture chamber’s door had the words “Dream Punishment.”

Zhou Wen looked into the room, but he didn’t see the white-robed punishment ghost. All he saw was a white-haired old woman sitting inside.
