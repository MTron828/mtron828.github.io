Chapter 1283: Dwarf

Translator: CKtalon

It was a red-skinned dwarf, only about a meter tall. He wore a grass skirt and had a green leaf on his head. He looked very strange.

After he entered the Venusian dimensional zone, the Metal Guard immediately launched an attack. When the bullet arrived in front of him, the dwarf suddenly opened his mouth and revealed his serrated teeth to bite the bullet.

Crack!

The bullet was actually crushed by his teeth. The dwarf quickly gritted his teeth and crushed the bullet in a few bites before stretching his neck and swallowing it.

Before the Metal Guard could fire a second shot, the dwarf rushed in front of him and bit off half the barrel. After chewing twice, he stretched his neck and swallowed it.

What happened next shocked the people watching the battle through the Cube.

The dwarf swallowed the Metal Guard alive. It was unknown how such a small body could contain the Metal Guard’s huge body.

Hordes of Metal Guards rushed out, but the dwarf was like a tiger in a flock of sheep. His body kept moving like a ghost, biting the Metal Guards to death.

The Golden Battle God’s bullet was also bitten by the dwarf. Be it freezing, flames, explosions, or lightning bullets, they were all crushed and swallowed by the dwarf, completely unable to injure his body.

“Those teeth are really good!” Li Xuan said as he shivered.

Zhou Wen, who was watching the livestream with Li Xuan, looked thoughtfully at the dwarf. With that frown, what was on his mind?

“Hey, what are you doing? I’m talking to you?” Li Xuan extended his hand and shook it in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen snapped to his senses and said, “Why do you think this dwarf can devour so much metal with his tiny body?”

“It probably has organs similar to storage spaces in its body, or perhaps its stomach has a super melting function, melting all the metal?” Li Xuan guessed.

“Both are possible, but here’s what I’m thinking. Tell me if you agree.” Zhou Wen glanced at the dwarf who was still chewing the Golden Battle God and continued, “He’s like a trash processor or a shredder. After something passes through his body, it will ultimately land in a trash bag.”

“That doesn’t conflict with my guess. The trash bag could be an organ similar to a storage space that can hold large amounts of things.” Li Xuan didn’t understand the difference between Zhou Wen’s explanation and what he had said.

“But what if the trash bag is full?” Zhou Wen asked.

“From the looks of it, it won’t be that easy to fill it up. Even if it’s really full, he can choose not to eat. He can just eat after digesting what’s inside him.” Li Xuan still didn’t know what Zhou Wen meant.

“What if he has to eat despite being full?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“That goes without saying. Of course he will burst,” Li Xuan said.

Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “We previously said that if he’s a shredder, he needs to change the trash bag when it’s full. He just needs to change the trash bag.”

Li Xuan found what Zhou Wen was saying baffling. The dwarf wasn’t really a shredder. How could there be a new trash bag to replace it?

Zhou Wen seemed to be talking to Li Xuan, but he also seemed to be muttering to himself, “Where should I find a second trash bag? Should I create a second trash bag? However, even if there’s a second, third, or even a tenth trash bag, it’s still unsatisfactory… Right… Wheels… If they’re in the form of wheels, they can be repeatedly used…”

“Old Zhou, what are you talking about?” Li Xuan failed to understand what Zhou Wen was saying despite listening for a long time.

However, Zhou Wen ignored him. He got up and gathered his strength with both hands, as though he was producing something in front of him. Li Xuan only saw the space in front of Zhou Wen distort, but was unsure what he was doing.

Why is this fellow only thinking about these strange things all day? He doesn’t know how to enjoy life at all.?Li Xuan knew that Zhou Wen had thought of something regarding cultivation and was trying to break through. He watched from the side and didn’t disturb him again. He also helped watch over him to prevent others from disturbing him.

Zhou Wen had been considering the problem of Absolute Space all this while. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible for a Terror-grade Absolute Space to withstand a bullet at the speed of light. It was difficult even to stall for time, so he had to take a different approach.

When he saw the scene of the dwarf devouring the Metal Guards, he suddenly thought of a possible solution. He felt that he might be able to create multiple Absolute Spaces and arrange them like wheels before quickly spinning them. This would allow the bullets to repeatedly pass through multiple Absolute Spaces without reaching Zhou Wen.

Of course, the spinning speed of the wheels was a problem. If Absolute Space’s rotation speed wasn’t fast enough, it couldn’t connect to the preceding Absolute Space. It would be impossible to achieve a cycle.

However, Zhou Wen had the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique as well. If he could constantly swap three or more Absolute Spaces, he might be able to resolve this problem.

Of course, this was only a theory. Whether it could really succeed depended on actual operation.

Now, he was trying to create multiple Absolute Spaces, but the outcome was disappointing. Creating multiple Absolute Spaces wasn’t easy.

In fact, it wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t have enough Essence Energy, but the characteristics of Absolute Space itself were very special. Zhou Wen could only maintain the existence of a single Absolute Space, so he couldn’t create a second.

It was as though there was a force that restrained the existence of Absolute Space. A second Absolute Space couldn’t exist at the same time. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

If I can’t create a second Absolute Space, what about letting Absolute Space spin itself? No, no. This isn’t right. I have to create multiple Absolute Spaces.?Zhou Wen stopped and fell into deep thought. He thought about how to resolve the problem of having multiple Absolute Spaces. He flipped through the book An Sheng had sent over, hoping to obtain some inspiration from it.

After thinking for a while, he still couldn’t find a solution. Meanwhile on the livestream, the Calamity-grade bullet had already been fired and hit the dwarf’s face.

The dwarf’s body flew out and slammed into the metal wall. Everyone thought that he had been killed, but on careful look, they realized that the dwarf’s teeth had clenched the Calamity-grade bullet.

Smoke was still emitting from between the teeth and the bullet, as though the friction was very intense. However, the Calamity-grade bullet had been caught.

“These teeth… are so hard…” Everyone felt their teeth ache.

Then, the dwarf rushed through the door. The bullets shot over and were bitten by him again, but his body was also sent flying by the bullets as he slammed into the wall again.

Time and time again, the first six bullets were all caught by the dwarf with his teeth. He was like an agile beast.. No matter which direction the bullets flew from, they would be precisely caught by his teeth.
