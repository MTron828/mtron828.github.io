Chapter 1545: The Omniscient Devil King

Translator: CKtalon

“I can get you two to do anything?” Zhou Wen sized up Liz and Leem and asked thoughtfully.

Liz and Leem trembled as their cheeks flushed even redder. Their bodies trembled as they lowered their heads and said, “It’s our honor to be able to offer ourselves to the Devil King.”

Before the two of them came, the City Lord had already explained plenty of things to them. It was because of this that they had such a vivid imagination.

“Your Devilish Excellency, you are the king of Lost Paradise. If we can give birth to Your Devilish Excellency’s son, we can break through the restrictions of the human body and let our descendants reach the Mythical stage. We can fight those gods and devils and no longer be fish on the chopping block. Whether our race can control our fates in the future will be up to you…”

Upon thinking of the City Lord’s serious tone, Liz and Lee couldn’t help but grit their teeth. Although they were still very afraid, they puffed up their chests and displayed their beautiful faces in front of Zhou Wen amidst trembling fear.

“If I were to let you die, would you be willing?” Zhou Wen asked.

He could only use the Cube to return, but four people were needed to enter the Cube. Zhou Wen still needed three, so he was still vexing over the numbers.

Liz and Leem immediately teared up when they heard that. They were extremely afraid.?His Devilish Excellency is an omniscient existence. How can our schemes deceive him?

“Your Devilish Excellency, we were wrong. It’s both our fault. It has nothing to do with our clansmen. If you want to punish us, punish us. It doesn’t matter even if you want our lives,” Liz and Leem said as they knelt on the ground and trembled.

“What did you do wrong?” Zhou Wen asked.

“We shouldn’t… shouldn’t have wanted… wanted…” Liz said ‘wanted’ a few times, but she couldn’t continue.

“What do you want?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown. He imagined that the people from Regretless City were secretly plotting to harm him.

Zhou Wen was clearly reading too much into it. The people of Regretless City respected the Devil King like a god, so how could they dare harm him?

“We shouldn’t have wanted to use Your Devilish Excellency’s seed…” Leem said through gritted teeth.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t drinking water. Otherwise, he would have choked to death. He widened his eyes as he looked at Liz and Leem kneeling in front of him, unable to believe his ears.

Zhou Wen even believed that he had heard wrongly. He wanted them to say it again, but on second thought, it was impossible for him to hear wrongly. It was pointless saying it again. It would only make him feel even more awkward.

“Since you know your mistake, tell me. How should I punish you?” Zhou Wen deliberately asked in a cold manner.

“Your Devilish Excellency, please forgive our clansmen. We are willing to commit suicide to atone for our sins.” Liz and Leem’s faces were filled with determination. They pulled out daggers, hoping to end their lives.

“Did I say I want you two dead?” Zhou Wen’s indifferent voice sounded. Liz and Leem looked at Zhou Wen in surprise, unsure what he meant.

Only now did they realize how capricious the Devil King was. They couldn’t infer anything via common human thought processes. They felt increasingly afraid and uneasy.

“Your lives no longer belong to you from now on,” Zhou Wen said to them.

“Yes, our lives are yours, Your Devilish Excellency.” Liz and Leem immediately knelt.

“Get up. Prepare some food before cleaning up this place.” Zhou Wen kept them because he wanted to use them when he entered the Cube in the future. He didn’t need them for the time being.

However, Zhou Wen was very curious about the food they ate. It was a perfect chance for him to sample it.

Liz and Leem left the cemetery gratefully as though they had been pardoned.

They went back and told the City Lord about the matter. The City Lord and company were so frightened that their faces turned pale and they nearly peed their pants. Only when they heard the whole story did they feel a lot better.

“The Devil King is indeed an omniscient existence. How can he not know my scheme? I nearly harmed all the clansmen in the city… Thankfully, the Devil King gave us a chance… Liz, Leem… Prepare the best food in our city. No matter what, we have to satisfy the Devil King…” After the elder said that, he felt worried. He personally made the preparations and meticulously did everything to perfection. Finally, he handed the finished product to Liz and Leem and got them to take the food into the cemetery. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhou Wen was grinding when he saw each of them bring in a basin. The basins contained clear water with a few crystalline green leaves soaked in them.

“Your Devilish Excellency, please have your meal.” Liz and Leem knelt in front of Zhou Wen and raised the two basins above their heads.

Are these leaves delicious??Zhou Wen was puzzled, but he still reached out to take a leaf and put it in his mouth to chew a little.

Just one mouthful made Zhou Wen frown. Although the leaf wasn’t terrible, it definitely wasn’t delicious. It tasted similar to the vegetable leaves on Earth.

Zhou Wen didn’t like western food or raw vegetables. He looked at the two sisters and asked, “Do you usually eat this?”

“Your Devilish Excellency, this is a precious leaf of the Jadeite Grass. It’s a very rare and delicious food. It’s very rare to gather it, and it’s impossible for ordinary people to eat it. Only during ceremonies and rituals will everyone get a little…” Liz answered.

“Then what do you usually eat?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“Usually we eat the roots of the stone grass,” Liz answered.

“Bring me the roots of the stone grass.” Zhou Wen really couldn’t imagine that such vegetable-like leaves were the precious food they were talking about. How terrible would the food they usually ate be?

The two sisters were horrified, believing that Zhou Wen wasn’t satisfied with their hospitality and wanted to beg for mercy.

Zhou Wen repeatedly said that he didn’t blame them and got them to retrieve the stone grass’s roots before they left in disbelief.

When they brought the stone grass’s roots over, Zhou Wen found them not bad—the roots were jade-white and were as thick as a finger. They were rather beautiful.

However, when Zhou Wen bit it, he immediately felt a bitter liquid flow into his mouth.

Is this thing edible at all??Zhou Wen suspected that the people of Regretless City were messing with him. How could something even more bitter than bitter melon be the food they usually ate?

However, Zhou Wen roughly scanned the area with Truth Listener and knew that they weren’t lying to him. Most of the people in Regretless City were eating this.

Looking at the trembling sisters, Zhou Wen sighed inwardly.?The people in Regretless City have it worse than the people on Earth.

Humans had stood at the top of the food chain for thousands of years on Earth. At the very least, they had experienced enjoyment. These people were at the bottom of the food chain in the dimension. They couldn’t even eat meat, much less have enjoyment. Any dimensional creature was at the Mythical stage. Who could they kill?

“This is for you..” Zhou Wen took out two pieces of bread and threw them at the sisters.
