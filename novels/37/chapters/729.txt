Chapter 730: Loving You for Ten Thousand Years

Translator: CKtalon

“I’m afraid it’s already happened,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he sized up the dark forest.

Dugu Ge didn’t say a word, but many tiny worms flew into the forest.

Although the Gu worms weren’t at the Mythical stage, they had hidden techniques. Furthermore, they were small in size, making it difficult for ordinary creatures to discover them.

However, after the Gu worms entered the forest, they simultaneously lost contact with Dugu Ge. No matter how Dugu Ge summoned them, he couldn’t obtain their memories. This made Dugu Ge’s expression turn ugly.

“Quick, let’s go...” As Dugu Ge spoke, he spread open a pair of insect wings, wanting to retreat along his original path.

Xia Liuchuan also summoned his ancient sword to use Sword Kinesis Flight. His straight line speed wasn’t slower than Dugu Ge’s. Zhang Chunqiu wasn’t slow either. He took out a talisman and was about to escape underground.

However, just as the trio was halfway through their actions, they saw a pair of ghostly eyes open in the pitch-black forest. The eyes stared at them, and they felt their minds blur. They were so tired that they couldn’t even open their eyes.

Bam!

The three of them fell to the ground in a daze. No matter how they struggled, their eyelids slowly closed.

As Zhou Wen walked in front, all he felt was that the surrounding forest was especially quiet.

However, it was different from the path the antelope had taken him. Although this path was quiet, there were many animals. However, they seemed especially lazy and were still sleeping.

Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. He walked carefully, but he didn’t encounter any problems along the way. By the time he arrived at the next city, the sky had already darkened.

After a day of carrying the log, Zhou Wen felt exhausted. He found a hotel in the small city and settled down.

This small city was similar to the previous city. Almost everyone had left. Zhou Wen randomly found an empty hotel, and no one asked him for money.

That night, Zhou Wen slept very soundly. When he woke up, he stretched his back and was filled with energy.

Nothing strange happened that night, unlike the hotel the night before. The television didn’t automatically switch on.

However, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. His chest seemed especially heavy. He looked down and immediately screamed.

For some reason, the clothes in front of his chest were lifted up as though there were two huge papayas stuffed inside. Zhou Wen hurriedly pulled open his clothes and immediately discovered two things that shouldn’t have appeared on him.

“How did this happen?” Zhou Wen realized that his voice had become extremely feminine. He hurriedly took out a mirror and looked at himself. He immediately realized that he had become a woman.

Zhou Wen immediately thought of the message The Thearch had sent him. He hurriedly took out his phone and sent The Thearch a message. “The Thearch, did you turn me into a woman?”

“Yes.” The Thearch quickly replied and admitted it readily.

“Why? I haven’t offended you recently, right?” Zhou Wen held back his anger and asked.

“Don’t you know why?” The Thearch asked.

“I really don’t know. Tell me clearly, what’s the reason?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. From The Thearch’s tone, it seemed like he had provoked her first, but he hadn’t contacted The Thearch recently. The Thearch hadn’t contacted him either.

“Have you forgotten the message you sent so quickly? Do you still need me to remind you?” The Thearch replied.

“I really don’t know what’s going on. I’m begging you, alright? Tell me. What message did I send you?” Zhou Wen increasingly felt that there was definitely something wrong.

When The Thearch heard Zhou Wen’s words, she seemed to realize that something was amiss. With Zhou Wen’s character being so afraid of death, how could he tempt fate by sending such a teasing message? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Thearch thought for a moment before sending a screenshot of the message to Zhou Wen.

“Baby, I want you to be my slave tonight...” Zhou Wen’s head turned livid when he saw the screenshot.

He originally wanted to say that it wasn’t posted by himself, but looking at the chat history on the screenshot, it was indeed sent from his account.

It’s no wonder The Thearch is so angry. So that’s how it is. However, I’ve never sent such a message. If The Thearch wants to mess with me, there’s no need to go through so much trouble to send me a fake message. Could it be that my account has been hacked? Did someone send a message to The Thearch using my account? Zhou Wen was suspicious.

“The Thearch, I really didn’t send that message. How could I send you that message? Someone must have hacked my account and sent you that message.” Zhou Wen wanted to explain the matter clearly and get The Thearch to quickly transform his body back. He really had no way of going out to meet anyone.

“What do you mean it’s impossible for you to send me such a message?” The Thearch replied.

“You are a flower. How can I have any thoughts about a flower? The Thearch, just believe me. Even if I were to tease a sow, I wouldn’t dare tease you. Quickly change me back,” Zhou Wen explained.

It was fine if Zhou Wen didn’t give his explanations, but his explanations only served to make The Thearch even angrier. She replied coldly, “Just wait. You will recover on your own.”

Then, The Thearch didn’t reply to any more of Zhou Wen’s messages. Despite thinking hard, Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out what had gone wrong. She was fine just moments ago, so why was she suddenly unhappy?

Thankfully, recovery was still possible. It was probably similar to the last time he transformed into a cat. He would recover after some time.

Zhou Wen didn’t leave. He planned on staying in the hotel and waiting for his transformation to end.

During this period of time, Zhou Wen restored his phone to its factory settings. Then, he redownloaded the apps and changed the password. He used all the available methods to prevent his account from being hacked again.

...

Feng Qiuyan was practicing his saber techniques as usual.

Suddenly, his phone rang. Feng Qiuyan usually didn’t pick up his phone or read messages when he was practicing with his saber. However, when he heard that the message was a ringtone that he had specially set, he guessed that it was from Zhou Wen. Feng Qiuyan stopped practicing with his saber and picked up his phone to take a look.

Indeed, the message was from Zhou Wen. Feng Qiuyan opened the message and his expression immediately turned odd.

“There was once a sincere love that was placed in front of me, but I didn’t cherish it. I only regretted it when I lost it. This is the most painful thing in the world. If the heavens can give me another chance, I will say three words to you: I love you. If you must add a deadline to this love, I hope it will be... ten thousand years!”

Feng Qiuyan stared blankly at the message as he looked extremely confused.

How did this happen... Why would Coach treat me... How can I reject Coach without hurting his pride? Feng Qiuyan was conflicted.
