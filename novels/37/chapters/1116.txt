Chapter 1117: Meeting Honn Shinsakura Again

Translator: CKtalon

“What’s the Sword Sage’s name?” Zhou Wen asked.

When Wu Zonglie and company heard this, their expressions turned nasty as though they had been greatly insulted.

“Out at sea, who doesn’t know the Sword Sage, Sei Gasakai of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace? Your Excellency, you are overseas, so how can you not know? Could it be that you are deliberately insulting us?” Wu Zonglie held his two sabers as though he wanted to fight Zhou Wen to the death.

“Sei Gasakai. Yes, that’s the name. That’s no mistake then.” Zhou Wen recalled that the elder’s name was indeed that.

Wu Zonglie and company didn’t know what Zhou Wen meant as they looked at him without saying a word.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and asked Wu Zonglie, “Since Sei Gasakai is known as Sword Sage, what’s his cultivation level now? Has he advanced to the Calamity grade?”

Zhou Wen believed that he had been trapped for more than a hundred years. In these hundred years, it was impossible for humans to stay in their original spots. Experts like Jing Daoxian and Night Thearch might have long cracked the restriction that prevented humans from advancing to the Mythical stage. Perhaps there were Calamity-grade experts among humans.

Since Sei Gasakai had the lofty title of Sword Sage, it was highly likely that he had already advanced to the Calamity grade.

Wu Zonglie and company’s faces flushed red. Wu Zonglie even drew his sword and pointed it at Zhou Wen. He said angrily, “If you dare insult our master again, we won’t let you escape unscathed even if we have to die today.”

“When did I insult Sei Gasakai?” Zhou Wen frowned.

Ji Moqing hurriedly said, “Master, that Sword Sage, Sei Gasakai, only advanced to the Mythical stage with the help of a Guardian’s power. He’s still worlds apart from reaching the Terror grade, much less the Calamity grade.”

“Nonsense. My master is already half a step into the Terror stage. What do you mean worlds apart? You deserve death.” Wu Zonglie was furious when he heard Ji Moqing’s disrespect for Sei Gasakai. He raised his saber and slashed at Ji Moqing, wanting to kill her.

Zhou Wen’s figure suddenly advanced and retreated. Before Wu Zonglie could react, Ji Moqing had already been pulled away by Zhou Wen.

“Leave,” Zhou Wen said to Wu Zonglie and company. He felt that it was tiring to speak to them. It was best to slowly ask the girl.

Wu Zonglie knew that he wasn’t Zhou Wen’s match. He gritted his teeth and left with his juniors.

After Wu Zonglie and company left, Zhou Wen carried Ji Moqing to the foot of the mountain. He placed her on the ground and asked, “Did you bring your phone?”

“They took everything away when they caught me.” Ji Moqing brushed away the soil on her buttocks and stood up to say to Zhou Wen, “Furthermore, even if i had a phone, there’s no signal here. It would be useless even if I had it.”

Zhou Wen didn’t want his phone to go online, but to check the date to determine the time.

He had a nagging feeling that something was amiss. It was as though he hadn’t been trapped for a hundred years.

“Since they’re all gone, stop pretending. My brother-in-law sent you here, right? Where’s brother-in-law? He didn’t come himself, right?” Seeing Zhou Wen standing there motionless, Ji Moqing reached out to grab his mask. “Honn Shinsakura is definitely nearby. After they meet Honn Shinsakura, he will definitely be able to guess that you were sent by my brother-in-law. It’s useless to wear a mask. Quickly take it off. It makes me uncomfortable.”

Zhou Wen dodged slightly, but he still took off his mask.

Ji Moqing couldn’t help but be taken aback when she saw Zhou Wen’s face. Then, she sized him up and said, “I never expected you to be so powerful at such a young age. As expected of my brother-in-law’s man.”

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, Ji Moqing pulled Zhou Wen and ran towards the beach. “Let’s not talk about this now. Let’s leave quickly. When Wu Zonglie finds Honn Shinsakura, we’ll be in trouble.”

However, after taking a few steps, Ji Moqing’s legs went limp and she nearly fell to the ground.

Ji Moqing hadn’t eaten or drunk for more than ten days. After such a long time, she was already at her limits.

“Did you bring any food or water?” Ji Moqing asked Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen took out a packet of biscuits and a bottle of water from the Chaos Bead and handed them to her. Thankfully, the time and space in the chaos space were different from the outside world. Food didn’t go bad.

Ji Moqing opened the bottle and poured water into her mouth. Then, she stuffed the biscuits into her mouth. As she stuffed them into her mouth, she walked towards the beach. She said in a daze, “Let’s... leave quickly... Don’t let them... catch up...”

“It’s probably too late to leave now,” Zhou Wen said as he looked into the distance.

Ji Moqing looked up and saw a huge whale swimming over from the distant sea.

Wu Zonglie and company were standing on the back of the whale, but the person in the lead wasn’t Wu Zonglie. Instead, it was a young man in a white sword outfit.

“It’s over, it’s over. Honn Shinsakura actually came so quickly. I can’t escape. Leave quickly. Go back and tell my brother-in-law that there’s no need to worry about me. I have a way to escape and get him to not go to the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.” Ji Moqing pushed Zhou Wen, indicating for him to leave quickly.

On the whale’s back, they also saw Zhou Wen. Wu Zonglie pointed at him and said, “Senior Brother Shinsakura, it’s that punk who disguised himself as Human Sovereign and snatched Ji Moqing away. It’s useless even if he takes off his mask. He hasn’t changed his clothes. He can’t be mistaken.”

Honn Shinsakura’s gaze landed on Zhou Wen. When he saw Zhou Wen’s face, his body involuntarily trembled as his eyes turned odd.

“Senior Brother Shinsakura, that punk even insulted Master. You have to tear him to pieces. You can’t let him die too easily,” shouted Wu Zonglie and company.

Honn Shinsakura didn’t say a word as he stared intently at Zhou Wen with mixed feelings.

Back then, he had still been a youth who believed himself to be a genius. He had believed that his talent was top-notch and that no one his age could match him.

However, he had met Zhou Wen that year. Even now, Honn Shinsakura couldn’t forget their meeting—he would never forget it for the rest of his life.

“I told you to leave. Why are you still standing here?” Ji Moqing couldn’t help but panic when she saw Zhou Wen standing still.

However, Ji Moqing quickly realized that it was too late. Honn Shinsakura had already arrived on the island with Wu Zonglie and company.

Ji Moqing knew how powerful Honn Shinsakura was. Although they were nominally disciples of Sword Sage Sei Gasakai, Wu Zonglie and company were in fact only in-name disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, while Honn Shinsakura was Sei Gasakai’s personal disciple. Furthermore, he was the one with the highest achievements.

Therefore, despite being much older than Honn Shinsakura, Wu Zonglie addressed him as Senior Brother Honn Shinsakura.

Legend had it that Honn Shinsakura’s achievements in the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū were almost comparable to Sei Gasakai’s. He was an extremely famous young expert overseas.

“Punk, let’s see if you still dare to act mysterious this time... Senior Brother Shinsakura, it’s him...” As Wu Zonglie spoke, he turned to look at Honn Shinsakura, but he was petrified.

Honn Shinsakura held his two sabers with both hands before kneeling down and bowing in front of Zhou Wen. This was an honorable bow that disciples used to pay respect to their masters. In the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, only Sei Gasakai could receive such a bow from Honn Shinsakura.
