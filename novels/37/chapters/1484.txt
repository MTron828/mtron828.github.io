Chapter 1485 Someone’s Here

In the morning, Zhou Wen was enjoying the purple light when he suddenly heard footsteps coming from below Laojun Platform.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that he had heard wrongly, but he immediately heard someone speak.

“Old man, are you sure it’s here?” A lazy man’s voice sounded.

Zhou Wen found the voice familiar and his expression immediately turned odd. This was because the voice sounded like Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun.

No way? Why is Liu Yun here? Zhou Wen was puzzled. Although Liu Yun was his eldest senior brother, it was difficult to describe their relationship. After all, Liu Yun had often tried scamming Zhou Wen in the past, but he always suffered losses every time. Zhou Wen was only passively counterattacking in the beginning, but over time, he couldn’t help but take the initiative to bully this eldest senior brother.

Their relationship couldn’t be considered good, but it wasn’t necessarily bad. No matter what Liu Yun thought, Zhou Wen had never thought of doing anything to Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun. He had never even treated him as an enemy.

This feeling was very strange. He was clearly someone who wanted to scam him the moment they met, but he didn’t think of him as an enemy.

“The place where Laojun ascended should be here. There’s no mistake about it.” An elderly voice sounded.

Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard the voice. This was because he was familiar with the voice. It was likely Jing Daoxian.

Why is Liu Yun still with Jing Daoxian? Hasn’t he suffered enough from colluding with him? Could it be that Jing Daoxian pulled some trick on Liu Yun, forcing him to obey his orders? Zhou Wen had always been puzzled as to why Liu Yun often ended up working with Jing Daoxian. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Later on, on careful thought, Liu Yun had been captured by Jing Daoxian in the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang. It was very likely that he had been tricked by Jing Daoxian and was coerced by him. “That might not be the case. Many places claim to have a relationship with Taishang Laojun. You said the same thing back in my hometown. What happened in the end?” Liu Yun mocked.

“This great immortal is the founder of Daoism. Everyone wants to rub off some blessings, causing the information to be messy. We need to slowly verify them. This Laojun Platform is indeed the place where Laojun ascended. As long as no one comes before us, that thing should still be here,” Jing Daoxian said slowly. “Let’s wait and see. I don’t dare have such high hopes.” Liu Yun still didn’t seem to believe Jing Daoxian’s judgment. As he spoke, he walked up the stairs, but he was stopped by Jing Daoxian.

“The 33 steps of Laojun Platform represent the 33 Heavens. Every step is a heaven. It’s not something that can be easily ascended,” Jing Daoxian said.

“There’s nothing special about it.” Liu Yun sized up the steps and felt that other than being a little taller, there was nothing special.

The more Zhou Wen listened, the more puzzled he became. He had been carried up here by the giant bear and didn’t find the stairs impressive. However, Jing Daoxian’s tone made it seem like even he didn’t dare underestimate the 33 steps.

“Daoism emphasizes returning to the basics. The more inconspicuous a place is, the more careful you have to be. Otherwise, you having ten lives wouldn’t be enough if I’m not by your side,” Jing Daoxian said solemnly.

“I’ve been traveling alone for so many years. Ain’t I still living well?” Liu Yun said disapprovingly. “You can give it a try if you don’t believe me,” Jing Daoxian said slowly.

“Sure.” As Liu Yun spoke, he jumped up the stairs.

Zhou Wen suddenly couldn’t hear him after Liu Yun landed on the steps. However, Liu Yun had clearly landed on the first step, so how did he suddenly vanish and go completely silent?

From the looks of it, those stairs are indeed as Jing Daoxian said. They possess unbelievable power. It’s only because I was carried by the giant bear which broke through the stairs’ restrictions that I didn’t sense the existence of that power. As Zhou Wen was thinking, he suddenly heard a tragic cry.

Liu Yun, who seemed to have vanished, fell to the ground away from the steps with a tragic cry as though he had appeared out of thin air. “Of the 33 steps, you couldn’t even last past the seventh step. Aren’t you too weak?” Jing Daoxian mocked.

Liu Yun got up from the ground and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He said stubbornly, “To be able to reach the seventh step shows heavenly talent. A genius like me is already rare in this world. You probably won’t find many in the human world capable of this feat.”

“Which one of your junior brothers isn’t stronger than you?” Jing Daoxian said airily.

“I’m just letting them have it easy. I don’t want to bully the weak on account of us being fellow disciples,” Liu Yun said as he cracked his neck.

“Luoyang’s An Tianzuo, the Dugu family’s Dugu Ge, the Zhang family’s Zhang Chunqiu, and the Xia family’s Xia Liuchuan, none of them should be inferior to you, right? There’s also that punk from the Feng family in the south sea and the Ming family’s kid that uses a sword. They aren’t much weaker than you, right? Geniuses like you don’t seem to be that rare.” Jing Daoxian listed down several examples.

Liu Yun was immediately displeased. “How can Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu be my match? An Tianzuo can at most fight me to a draw. They can barely be considered on the same level. I’m not afraid of the others.”

“When you mention a draw, is it like that time at Dragon Gate Grotto in Luoyang? He chased as you ran, but that he failed to catch up to you? That’s right. As long as you aren’t dead, it’s a draw,” Jing Daoxian said with a smile.

“How did you know?” Liu Yun was alarmed as he glared at Jing Daoxian.

“I know plenty.” Jing Daoxian didn’t answer him. He looked at the steps in front of him and said, “These 33 steps are the distance between heaven and earth. It’s the process of advancing from a mortal to an immortal. If you can reach the 33rd step at the Epic stage with your own abilities, you can break through the limits of the Deva Realm and advance to the Mythical stage with your body. Unfortunately, no one in the world can do it.”

After a pause, Jing Daoxian said, “Follow me. Let’s head up now.”

With that said, Jing Daoxian walked up the steps. Liu Yun followed closely behind him.

Soon, Zhou Wen couldn’t hear their voices as though they had vanished into thin air.

When Zhou Wen heard their voices again, it was more than an hour later. Jing Daoxian and Liu Yun had already arrived at the door.

The door that had been smashed by the giant bear had returned to its original state. It was impossible to tell that it had been smashed before.

“This door can’t be opened with brute force. If one tries to force their way in, they might be thrown out of Laojun Platform.” Jing Daoxian looked at the door and slowly walked to it before knocking on it.

He knocked on the door with a strange rhythm. After knocking a few times, the door automatically opened.

“Didn’t you say that the door is very difficult to open? Why did it open just by knocking?” Liu Yun naturally knew that something was amiss. He had said that to get Jing Daoxian to explain the oddity.

As Jing Daoxian walked into the yard, he said, “This is the Door of the Deva Realm. As long as one breaks through the limits of the Deva Realm, they will naturally be able to open it. Therefore, I can open it, but you can’t.”
