Chapter 1762 My World Doesn’t Have Dead Ends

“Between surviving and creating a miracle, what will you choose?” The woman’s voice echoed in Zhou Wen’s mind.

“I choose to live to create a miracle,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

The woman had given Zhou Wen a framework, but he didn’t believe that this framework was an ironclad principle that couldn’t be transcended. Both paths were paths that the woman had set herself. Why did he have to choose the path that the woman had set?

The so-called two options the woman proposed weren’t the best choice for Zhou Wen.

“Live on or create miracles. You can only choose one. There’s no third option,” the woman said.

“That’s your path, not mine,” Zhou Wen said. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Oh, then tell me, what’s your path?” the woman asked.

“Nothing is absolute in my path. Be it the girl or that weapon, they won’t be a necessary existence for me,” Zhou Wen said.

“You mean that you won’t snatch that weapon, nor will you kill the girl?” the woman frowned.

“No, I’ll do my best to snatch that weapon, but even if I can’t obtain it, it’s not a dead end for me,” Zhou Wen said firmly.

“Make it clear,” the woman pressed.

“As long as I’m not dead, my world doesn’t have dead ends,” Zhou Wen enunciated each word clearly.

“No dead ends?” The woman ruminated over Zhou Wen’s words as her voice gradually turned odd. “Even such a supreme existence isn’t a dead end for you? Do you still want to become an existence that can surpass him? The ignorant are truly fearless. I’m afraid you don’t know what kind of existence it is, but... I like it... Then let me see... where your end is...”

With the woman’s voice, her psychic power suddenly rose and spewed out like a volcano.

Trajectory Seeking looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression. Zhou Wen stood in the corporeal white light for several seconds, but he remained composed as though he hadn’t been injured at all.

As for the humans beside him, existences as powerful as Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu were already prostrating on the ground, unable to move.

How is this possible! He can actually withstand the will of Nameless God? Trajectory Seeking found it unbelievable. In the next second, her eyes reflected the beauty of fireworks as her eyes widened to their limits.

Boom!

An invisible force seemed to spew out from Zhou Wen’s body as the white light enveloping him shattered. It scattered like fireworks before disappearing.

The terrifying white pillar of light seemed to be pierced by a sharp blade as it instantly collapsed, turning into streams of light that scattered before disappearing.

The will of Nameless God... was actually crushed... Trajectory Seeking almost couldn’t believe her eyes. Amidst the gorgeous white streams of light, Zhou Wen’s figure was like a god. It seemed to fog Trajectory Seeking’s eyes, preventing her from seeing clearly.

As the white pillar of light dissipated, the extremely black sky returned to its sunny state. It was no longer as strange as before.

The pressure on the residents of Guide City vanished as they stood up.

Trajectory Seeking looked up at Zhou Wen in a daze for a long time.

In the dimension, Holy Lord Trajectory’s pupils suddenly constricted as a look of horror that had never been seen in millennia appeared on his face.

In the forbidden zone of the six races, the white vertical eye on the stone statue exploded. Instantly, the white light vanished and it returned to its previous cracked state. On both sides of the vertical mark, many tiny cracks appeared like spiderwebs.

The power of Nameless God’s psyche has actually suffered a backlash... This is impossible... How can there be such a terrifying lifeform on Earth... Could it be that the Immortal went missing on Earth because... Holy Lord Trajectory’s mind flickered as he found it difficult to control himself.

Zhou Wen retracted his gaze and looked at the kneeling Trajectory Seeking in front of him. He thought to himself, What do you mean that the weapon is a supreme existence? Isn’t it clearly inferior to you? What are you? Why did you become my Life Providence? Where does the Lost Immortal Sutra come from? However, the woman didn’t respond to his thoughts. The Sigh of the King Life Providence had already converged, and there was no movement from it. It was dead silent.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen thought of something. Ever since he had the Sigh of the King Life Providence, no matter how powerful an existence was, they couldn’t make him kneel. Only once did he kneel.

Back then, Zhou Wen believed that Demonic Neonate’s cooperation with the suona was too powerful, so the Sigh of the King didn’t react.

But from the looks of it, he had underestimated the power of the Sigh of the King. The reason for her not appearing and allowing him to kneel probably wasn’t because the woman knew that she couldn’t stop Zhou Wen from kneeling.

With the way the woman defeated the psychic power, it would probably only take a thought for her to kill Demonic Neonate with the suona.

Could it be... Zhou Wen thought of a possibility as his expression turned odd.

If it wasn’t because Demonic Neonate and the suona were too powerful, there was only one possibility left. It was that Zhou Wen had no choice but to kneel back then. Even the Sigh of the King had no reason to stop it.

Could the reason... be that corpse? After some thought, Zhou Wen could only think of this possibility. Back then, other than the corpse, he really couldn’t think of anything nearby that would make the Sigh of the King not react to his kneeling.

“Are... Are you really human?” Trajectory Seeking’s voice interrupted Zhou Wen’s thoughts. She looked at him with a lost look.

Ever since she was young, the thoughts that Holy Lord Trajectory had instilled in her were that Nameless God was an invincible existence. Once she truly controlled Nameless God, she could rule the world. Even if the Immortal from before was revived, she didn’t believe that she would lose.

However, Nameless God’s psychic power was actually defeated. This completely overturned her world view, causing her confidence in herself and Nameless God to waver.

“Since you have already acknowledged me as your master, you have to abide by the rules. You have to greet me as ‘Teacher’ in the future, understand?” Zhou Wen said indifferently as he looked at her.

Trajectory Seeking’s beliefs wavered, and she couldn’t think of anything to refute Zhou Wen. All she did was look at him in a daze as though she had tacitly agreed.

Suddenly, the Cube emitted light as another creature attempted the level. Zhou Wen turned his head and realized that it was another human. Furthermore, he was rather familiar with this person.

He wore a white robe, revealing his fair and firm chest. His long hair cascaded down wantonly as he casually placed a sheathed sword on his shoulder. He looked languid and wild, as though he wasn’t here to clear the level but to enjoy the sun.
