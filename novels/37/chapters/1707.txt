Chapter 1708 The Legendary Kunlun Mountain

Zhou Wen flipped through a lot of information. Although there weren’t many spatial dimensional zones, Guide Ancient City’s information sources were becoming more and more varied. The intelligence department was constantly improving, allowing Zhou Wen to gain knowledge of more spatial dimensional zones.

However, after looking around, he wasn’t sure which one was more compatible with the Godfiend Era.

Just as Zhou Wen was considering which spatial dimensional zone to visit, Liu Yun suddenly called. “Junior Brother, it’s been a long time since we last met. Do you miss your dear Eldest Senior Brother?” Liu Yun was still as greasy as ever.

“I miss the treasures on you more,” Zhou Wen subconsciously replied.

Every time he met Liu Yun, Zhou Wen seemed to be able to get some good things from him. For a long period of time, Zhou Wen treated Liu Yun as a treasure delivery boy. His words were truly heartfelt.

When Liu Yun heard that, he said in an extremely ambiguous and exaggerated tone, “Junior Brother, I never expected you to be such a person. Although I do have a big tool and great skill, I’m really not interested in

men!”

Zhou Wen was taken aback before he reacted. “Speak your mind. If there’s nothing else, I’m hanging up.” “Don’t be so petty. Can’t you take a joke? I have something serious to discuss with you,” said Liu Yun.

“I’m busy. I’ll hang up if there’s nothing else.” Zhou Wen didn’t really hang up. “I discovered something good in a dimensional zone. Are you interested in joining me?” Liu Yun hurriedly said.

“You’ll come to me if there’s something good? Speak. What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that Liu Yun would share good things with him out of goodwill.

“Hehe, nothing much. It’s just that I can’t deal with that dimensional zone myself. If you are interested, let’s give it a try together. I won’t take advantage of you either. Everything we obtain will be split 50-50,” Liu Yun said with a grin.

“What dimensional zone? What good things are inside? What’s the thing you can’t handle? Tell me everything in detail. If… I mean if… I agree to go with you and discover something different, don’t blame me for turning hostile.” Zhou Wen knew Liu Yun too well. Although this fellow couldn’t be considered bad, he was definitely not a good person. He could at most believe 70% of what he said.

“Have you heard of Kunlun Mountain?” Liu Yun’s tone became much more serious.

“Which Kunlun Mountain are you talking about?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Smart. It’s definitely not the one on the map,” said Liu Yun with a smile.

“You found the legendary Kunlun Mountain?” Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. The Kunlun Mountain on maps was different from the legendary Kunlun Mountain. Kunlun Mountain was also known as the Kunlun Ruins. There were many legendary versions.

Some said that Kunlun Mountain was mainly led by the Queen Mother of the West, while others said that it was the capital of Human Sovereign, Fuxi. Others said that it was the home of the gods.

Although there were many versions of the legends, it was impossible to tell which was real and which was fake. However, in all the versions of the myths and legends, that place was a top-notch land of immortals. Those who could be related to Kunlun Mountain were basically the super immortals of the eastern pantheon.

“Yes, it’s been found and something good has been discovered, but I can’t retrieve it myself. There’s still hope if we join forces,” Liu Yun said sincerely.

“If it’s really the legendary Kunlun Mountain, do you think I can pick up the spoils so easily from that place?” After Zhou Wen saw how terrifying Chess Mountain was, he didn’t dare rashly enter the unknown top dimensional zones.

Although the Mythical creatures in Chess Mountain were terrifying, they seemed to be inferior to Mount Kunlun.

“I’ve already made a trip inside. Ain’t I back safely? Don’t worry. I’ve already investigated and have a plan. I’m just lacking you as a helper. Are you coming?” Liu Yun said with confidence.

“Tell me. What do you want to do?” Although Zhou Wen was already tempted, he wouldn’t agree to Liu Yun so easily before figuring out the actual situation.

“I’ll be honest with you. I discovered a sword in Kunlun Mountain-a very powerful sword. You are very familiar with Human Sovereign’s sword. That sword is definitely not inferior to Human Sovereign’s. However, there’s a powerful dimensional creature guarding the sword. I can’t deal with it myself, so I came to you for help,” Liu Yun said.

“How do you know that the sword isn’t inferior to Human Sovereign’s sword?” Zhou Wen knew that Liu Yun was implying that he was Human Sovereign, but he pretended not to understand.

“Because that sword is very similar to Human Sovereign’s sword. I reckon it’s very likely related to Human Sovereign’s sword.” Liu Yun hesitated for a moment before continuing, “I suspect that Human Sovereign’s sword might be one of the legendary Four Swords of Immortal Vanquishing. And the one I discovered at Kunlun Mountain might be one of them.”

“One of the four Immortal Vanquishing Swords?” Zhou Wen’s interest was truly piqued, but he still had to make things clear. “What’s the level of the dimensional creature guarding the sword?”

“It might be the Heaven Realm,” Liu Yun answered hesitantly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“What do you mean it might be the Heaven Realm?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Because I’m not sure either. It’s just a guess. This is the truth. Do you think I can fight such a dimensional creature? If I really attack, even if I can come out alive, I probably won’t have the strength to talk to you,” Liu Yun said helplessly.

“That’s true.” Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and said after some thought, “I can agree to go with you to take a look, but I’ll decide if I’ll participate in the operation. I’ll decide after I get there. If you agree, I’ll go with you. If not, just pretend I’ve never heard of it.”

“Sure. I’ll send you the coordinates. You can teleport over. We’ll meet there.” After Liu Yun said that, he hung up and sent Zhou Wen the coordinates.

Don’t tell me this fellow wants to scam me again? Zhou Wen didn’t dare teleport over casually. He held the coordinates and compared them to the map to see where the coordinates Liu Yun had given him were.

Zhou Wen also wanted to know where the legendary Kunlun Mountain was.

Of course, he had another goal for going there. He wanted to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol and download the Kunlun Mountain dungeon into his phone.

Why is it here? Zhou Wen looked at the coordinates on the map and couldn’t help but be surprised.

He originally imagined that the legendary Kunlun Mountain wasn’t where the present Kunlun Mountain was. It was likely a relatively remote area, but the location indicated by the coordinates wasn’t too far from where Zhou Wen was. It was a small county city named Yang City County. After checking some information on the Internet and knowing that Yang City County hadn’t fallen and that there were still people living there, Zhou Wen felt relieved. He planned on teleporting over to meet Liu Yun and see what the legendary Kunlun Mountain looked like.
