Chapter 1253: Tai Sui’s Evolution

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled as he asked a few more people. He realized that none of them knew about Lucas. Even if they knew, they only had a vague awareness of him. No one knew what had happened to Lucas.

Strange. With Lucas’s personality, it’s impossible for him to lead a quiet life, right??Zhou Wen thought for a moment and sent a message to Lucas, but he didn’t get a reply.

Could something have happened to this fellow??Zhou Wen flipped through the news. The reports regarding Lucas were from four years ago. There weren’t any reports about him in the past four years.

It was as though Lucas had vanished, but there was no report of what had happened to him.

Although it was normal for humans to die accidentally in this era, it still made Zhou Wen feel uncomfortable when he thought of how he had lost someone he knew.

He took the map and headed for the strange forest. The strange forest was a dimensional zone, and the Time Hut could be considered a part of the strange forest.

As it was very dangerous, not many humans came here.

The only good thing about the strange forest was that there were only plant-type dimensional creatures here. Plant-type dimensional creatures were typically unable to move, so as long as one didn’t enter a specific radius, there wouldn’t be much danger.

However, plant-type dimensional creatures were mixed among ordinary plants. It wasn’t easy to discover them, so it was normal to accidentally approach them.

Zhou Wen’s senses were extremely sharp, so it wasn’t difficult for him to distinguish plant-type dimensional creatures. After walking into the strange forest, he immediately discovered many plant-type dimensional creatures.

Their sizes ranged from a blade of grass, a mushroom to a towering tree—all of them could be a dimensional creature.

Furthermore, plant-type dimensional creatures typically didn’t have powerful auras. It was difficult for ordinary people to tell which were dimensional creatures and which were ordinary plants.

Zhou Wen realized that some mosses were dimensional creatures. With a thought, he summoned Tai Sui.

After Tai Sui discovered the moss, it excitedly rushed over and quickly devoured a large patch of it.

It had been eating the Dragon King Gu for the past few years and seemed to be sick of it. Now that there was a change in flavor, it looked very happy.

Tai Sui, who was like a huge white ball, bounced ahead and led the way. The spore-type dimensional creatures in the air were also devoured by Tai Sui.

To others, the strange forest might be a death zone, but to Zhou Wen, it wasn’t that dangerous. It was similar to a vegetable plot he could call his own.

Ya’er even plucked a few dimensional creature flowers. They didn’t dare resist or attack.

“The scenery here isn’t bad. It would be better if there was some alcohol.” Having been finally released, Grim Demon found everything pretty good.

Demonic Neonate didn’t react at all. She was completely uninterested in the beautiful vista.

Ice Maiden carried Jade Rabbit in its smallest form and sized up her surroundings with her beautiful eyes, wary of any danger that might appear. She didn’t like this place that was filled with vitality. Only the ice world made her feel comfortable.

Such a place made her feel uncomfortable. The thought of the various bacteria caking the plants left her in distress.

Zhou Wen compared the map and walked forward. He realized that the map was indeed wrong. There were many routes and references marked on the map, but didn’t exist in reality.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to use Truth Listener’s ability to search for the Time Hut. Unfortunately, he didn’t discover it within Truth Listener’s range of detection.

The entourage could only slowly search. After walking for a short distance, Tai Sui, that was bouncing in front, suddenly stopped.

What’s going on??Zhou Wen and company walked over and realized that there was a tree in front of Tai Sui. There was a fist-sized hole at its root. Tai Sui seemed to be very interested in the tree hole.

If it wasn’t for the fact that it didn’t dare take action without Zhou Wen’s orders, it would have long burrowed in.

Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to observe what was inside the tree hole and quickly realized that it extended deep underground. The roots below were intertwined, and a huge cavern appeared more than ten meters below.

The empty space was rather large. The entire top was the tree’s roots, and there were some strange dimensional creatures growing below that looked like some mushroom variant but appeared harder.

It didn’t look like a Ganoderma lingzhi. Above the jade-like stem, there were some green teeth.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what dimensional creature it was, but Tai Sui had already rushed in.

Its body was much bigger than the hole, but Tai Sui could change its size at will. Its body liquefied, turning into long, snake-like strips that drilled into the hole.

After entering the tree hole, Tai Sui began devouring the strange creatures without restraint. The strange creatures didn’t dare resist as they trembled and were devoured by Tai Sui without any resistance.

Before Zhou Wen could figure out what they were, Tai Sui had already devoured them all.

Tai Sui burrowed out of the ground and black-gray matter secreted from its body before Zhou Wen could figure out what it had devoured.

Before long, Tai Sui’s entire body was enveloped by a layer of extremely hard black ash, as though it had turned into a black-gray ball of rock.

Has Tai Sui evolved??Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. This had happened too suddenly and too easily. He was a little at a loss.

Seeing that Tai Sui didn’t react, nor did he know when it could complete its evolution, he stored it in the Chaos Bead.

“There’s someone over there,” Grim Demon said as he looked in a direction in the forest.

“Go over and take a look. If there’s really someone, I might be able to find out where the Time Hut is.” Zhou Wen also sensed a group of humans as he walked over with Ya’er in his arms.

Before long, they saw a group of people walking over. When they saw Zhou Wen and company, they wore wary expressions.

It might not be a good thing for humans to encounter their kind in a strange forest.

“May I ask where the Time Hut is?” Zhou Wen didn’t care what they thought as he asked.

The leading elder sized up Zhou Wen and company for a while before saying, “Are you foreigners? If you want to go to the Time Hut, it’s best you hire a guide. Otherwise, something might happen.”

“If possible, can you tell me the general direction and location of the Time Hut?” Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t afraid of any danger. Unless a Calamity-grade creature appeared, it was hard for any ordinary dimensional creature to injure him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The elder was about to say something when a young man in the team pointed in a direction and said, “The Time Hut is over there. If you aren’t afraid of death, feel free to head over.”

Zhou Wen could tell from his tone that something had happened at the Time Hut.
