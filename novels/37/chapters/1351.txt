Chapter 1352: One Takes on the Color of One’s Company

This fellow, Zhou Wen, is extremely bad. He wanted to use the Heavenly Robe to scam others, and now, he has secretly run into a woman’s room… What does he want to do??Sweetie walked through the building and couldn’t help but feel slightly disappointed when she saw Zhou Wen and Wang Lu sitting at a table and talking. Their clothes were still intact.

“What are you doing here in the middle of the night?” Wang Lu asked Zhou Wen.

“I’m here to return the Companion Beast,” Zhou Wen said.

“You don’t plan on entering the Venusian dimensional zone again?” Wang Lu asked in surprise.

She knew how great of a benefit it was for Zhou Wen to be able to carry people up the rankings. Just doing so led to plenty of resources, resources that couldn’t be bought with money.

“In the future, even if I want to get on the rankings, I want to use my own abilities. I don’t need the Lucky Companion Beasts.” Zhou Wen extended his hand in front of Wang Lu. “Give me your hand.”

“This isn’t the tone a gentleman should use when speaking to a girl.” Wang Lu smiled and placed her finger on Zhou Wen’s palm.

Zhou Wen held Wang Lu’s finger and immediately circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, transferring five Companion Beasts to her.

Other than the Invincible Lucky Star, there was also the Heavenly Robe, the Lady Luck Necklace, the Lucky Stone Sprite, and the Lucky Clover King.

Zhou Wen transferred all his Mythical Luck Companion Beasts to Wang Lu.

Without the Invincible Luck Star, Lucky Dodge was already useless. It was useless keeping so many Luck Companion Beasts.

However, in Wang Lu’s hands, they could play a huge role.

Of course, Luck Companion Beasts could still increase his drop rate. If not for the fact that he wanted to return Wang Lu’s favor, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have handed them to her so easily.

“Is this what you call a fivefold return?” After Wang Lu received the Companion Beasts, she sensed the information from them. Her expression suddenly changed. “If you give me the Heavenly Robe, what about you?”

“You have the Invincible Lucky Star, so the effects of the Heavenly Robe can be maximized. It’s not very useful for me to keep it. Besides, I have more than one Heavenly Robe.” Zhou Wen paused and exhorted, “However, don’t let anyone know that you have the Heavenly Robe and Luck Companion Beasts for the time being.”

“You want to sell the Heavenly Robe?” Wang Lu was extremely smart and immediately figured out what Zhou Wen wanted to do.

“Smart,” Zhou Wen praised.

“In that case, I can take the opportunity to make a killing,” said Wang Lu.

“You want to sell some Luck Companion Beasts?” Zhou Wen also guessed what Wang Lu wanted to do.

After the Heavenly Robe was sold, the person who obtained it would definitely want to exploit it to its fullest. They would go around collecting Luck Companion Beasts like Zhou Wen had done in the past.

When the time came, the price of Luck Companion Beasts would definitely skyrocket. Zhou Wen prepared to sell the low-level Luck Companion Beasts he kept when that happened.

In any case, without the Invincible Lucky Star, there wasn’t much use in keeping so many Luck Companion Beasts.

Just as An Sheng had said, there was actually an upper limit to the luck attribute. It meant that the luck attribute wouldn’t stack indefinitely if one brought more Luck Companion Beasts.

“I’ve collected quite a number of Luck Companion Eggs in the past, but because they are duplicates and don’t add much luck, I haven’t hatched them. I only keep them as backup. I can use this opportunity to sell them at a high price. I might be able to earn tens or hundreds of times more,” Wang Lu said with a smile.

“Then I’ll congratulate you in advance for making a killing,” Zhou Wen said as he raised his teacup.

“To us, for the killing we will make together.” Wang Lu also raised her teacup.

What a shameless couple!?Sweetie understood their conversation. She originally thought that Wang Lu was quite pure and pretty, but she never expected her to be so nasty. She couldn’t help but mutter.

Looking at the two of them smiling at each other, Sweetie felt as if her soul had been corrupted.

No, I have to think of a way to find out the origins of the candy box as soon as possible.?Sweetie felt that her heart wouldn’t be pure anymore if she continued following Zhou Wen.

After some thought, she felt that it was impossible to approach Zhou Wen under normal circumstances.

There’s no need to worry so much when dealing with such despicable villains. I should fight fire with fire and use some extreme methods.

?Sweetie already had an idea and planned on using methods similar to Zhou Wen’s.

It was a pity that Sweetie didn’t understand the principle of taking the color of one’s company. Once she was tainted by the color, it would be difficult for her to revert.

When a person used the same method to take revenge on a bad person, she could no longer revert to a pure slate. Moreover, Sweetie’s previous living environment was too clean. It was so clean that she was like a piece of white paper, and white paper was the easiest to dye with color. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After Zhou Wen left the Wang family, he spent the entire night traveling, hoping to return to Luoyang as soon as possible.

An Tianzuo wasn’t in Luoyang, so he couldn’t stay outside for long. If something happened, he wouldn’t be able to deal with it in time.

It was a dark night with strong winds. Zhou Wen was instant transmitting when he suddenly saw a blonde girl in white standing at the edge of the forest in front of him. However, on a careful look, the blonde girl had vanished like a ghost.

Zhou Wen almost imagined that he was seeing things. Just as he was about to rub his eyes, he suddenly saw the blonde girl appear in front of him again. She was so close that he could see her eyelashes clearly. Her hair was disheveled and her face was pale. She was as terrifying as a malicious ghost.

Zhou Wen was alarmed as he immediately instant transmitted in retreat. He kept doing so in an attempt to escape as he muttered inwardly,?Why is that blonde girl chasing after me again? How did she find me? Could she be a ghost?

Just as Zhou Wen finished instant transmission, he realized that the blonde girl was in front of him. He was immediately alarmed as he teleported in another direction.

But no matter where he instant transmitted to, the blonde girl would be standing there, looking at him expressionlessly like a ghost.

After his instant transmission failed to evade her, Zhou Wen teleported to Venus.

However, when he stood on Venus, he realized that the blonde girl was still standing in front of him, staring at him like a vengeful ghost.

Zhou Wen had goosebumps as he looked at the blonde girl and forced a smile. He coughed lightly and said, “Um, we don’t seem to have any grudges, right? Why are you chasing me?”

“My death was so unjust. You caused my death. I want you to go to hell with me,” the blonde girl said with a voice that sounded like a malicious spirit.

“When did I cause your death?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he asked the blond girl.

“Back at the chocolate shop, you could have saved me. It was because you left me in the lurch that I died. Now, I want you to die with me.” As the blonde girl spoke, her figure constantly flashed around Zhou Wen. It was impossible for Zhou Wen to determine her location.

Zhou Wen didn’t even notice the blonde girl standing behind him.

Could there really be ghosts in this world??Zhou Wen’s legs turned to jelly.

He could only be considered half an atheist because he had heard too many ghost stories from his grandfather when he was young. Therefore, although he knew logically that there were no ghosts in the world and that they were at most dimensional creatures, he still felt fear sometimes.

Furthermore, with the hearing that Truth Listener had provided him, it was impossible for him not to sense any movement even if it was a Calamity-grade. It was even more impossible for him not to notice someone standing behind him.

This blonde girl really did seem like a ghost.
