Chapter 870: Tiger General’s Might

Translator: CKtalon

Liu Yun took a careful look and realized that he recognized the Companion Beast Zhou Wen had summoned.

Not only did he know it, but he had once owned it. Later, he took the initiative to return it to Zhou Wen.

“No way? You want to use it to block the twelve Gold Men? Are you crazy?” Liu Yun had once stolen the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General from Zhou Wen. He had some understanding of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and knew that it was an Epic Companion Beast.

It was impossible for Zhou Wen to use the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to fight the twelve Gold Men.

“I’ll give it a try. Perhaps it will work?” Zhou Wen carried Ya’er and constantly moved around the city, dodging the Gold Men’s attacks.

The strongest thing about the twelve Gold Men wasn’t their strength, but their defense. Even Tyrant Behemoth, who had Absolute Strength, wasn’t able to leave a fatal wound on them. It was obvious how powerful their bodies were.

The moment the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General appeared, he was surrounded by the Bronze Men on the street. However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General didn’t care about that. The tiger beneath him charged at the Bronze Men crazily. The spear in his hand instantly pierced through the three Bronze Men like a skewer of candied haws. He lifted them up and threw them out, tearing them apart in midair.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was like a tiger that had entered a flock of sheep. The Bronze Men with astonishing defense had no chance of turning the tide under its spear. In just a moment, he had killed twenty to thirty Bronze Men.

A Gold Man charged at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and threw a huge metal fist at him.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General showed no signs of weakness. The spear in his hand stabbed out with the momentum of an armor-piercing spear, colliding with the Gold Man’s fist.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General remained motionless, but the Gold Man was forced to take a few steps back.

In a one-on-one situation, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s Strength was stronger than the Gold Man, but he wasn’t much stronger.

That’s impossible!? Liu Yun’s eyes nearly popped out. When he stole the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, he didn’t find the latter that strong.

After the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General landed on the ground, it continued charging through the Bronze Men. Its body gradually burned with strange purple flames.

Zhou Wen knew that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s skill combination that resembled a perpetual motion machine was beginning to take effect.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was a Companion Beast that became stronger as he fought. He could condense killing aura to strengthen himself. The flames that were ignited by killing aura were transformed by the Tempered Steel Cauldron skill, making his body stronger and stronger.

As long as the twelve Gold Men failed to kill him in the beginning, he would become stronger and stronger. Perhaps when he reached a certain level of strength, he could fight the twelve Gold Men.

Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body could be strengthened to that level. He could give it a try now.

As the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General unleashed his might, more and more Gold Men were attracted to it. The pressure on Zhou Wen and Liu Yun decreased significantly.

As for Liu Yun, he wore a look of disbelief. He really couldn’t believe that the Companion Beast he had stolen and returned to Zhou Wen was so powerful.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was fighting against five Gold Men alone, and in such a spectacular manner without being at a disadvantage.

If I had known that this thing was so powerful, I wouldn’t have returned him to Zhou Wen! Liu Yun felt his heart bleed.

“Let me give him a boost.” Zhou Wen summoned three Fire Furnace Queens and got them to release a large amount of flames at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

Two of the other Fire Furnace Queens were obtained by Zhou Wen later. Now, there were only three of them.

With the augmentation of the flames, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became even more ferocious. The purple flames on the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became more and more intense. It was like a Fiend Tiger and Fiend General that had rushed out of hell.

Seven or eight Gold Men surrounded it and temporarily suppressed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s ferocious might. However, under their pressure, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became stronger the more it fought. It had no intention of retreating.

Soon, all twelve Gold Men were attracted by it.

No way! This fellow is even more ferocious than Tyrant Behemoth? Liu Yun felt as though someone had stabbed him in the heart a few times. He had stolen such a ferocious Companion Beast and ended up returning it to Zhou Wen. However, when he thought of this matter, he had the urge to bang his head against the wall or slap himself.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General staggered under the siege of the twelve Gold Men. However, it continued to brandish the spear in its hand to fight them. The ferocious tiger beneath it roared and pounced forward.

Although it looked a little tragic, even Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t restrain the twelve Gold Men.

Upon seeing the sparks fly off the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body, Zhou Wen wasn’t alarmed. Instead, he was delighted and began to feel relieved.

If the twelve Gold Men had attacked together from the beginning, perhaps only eight or nine Gold Men would have been needed to kill Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s skills had already formed a cycle. He became stronger and stronger in battle. It was already impossible for the twelve Gold Men to kill him.

As long as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body could withstand it, he might eventually become stronger than the twelve Gold Men.

“Why are you still watching? Open the door,” Zhou Wen said to Liu Yun.

Only then did Liu Yun snap out of his daze. He looked at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General with a pained expression before turning to run to the palace door to open it.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General stormed through the city, attracting the attention of the twelve Gold Men. They had no time to care about Zhou Wen and Liu Yun.

Some Bronze Men rushed over, but Zhou Wen casually killed them, preventing them from approaching Liu Yun who was opening the door.

Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener to scan the palace, but the palace was enveloped by a strange force that Truth Listener’s power couldn’t penetrate.

Unless Zhou Wen got Truth Listener to break its earrings, it would be very difficult for it to make a breakthrough.

“It’s open!” After a while, Liu Yun, who was sprawled in front of the door, shouted happily. Then, he pushed the door with both hands, and the palace door opened.

Zhou Wen focused his gaze inside, but what he saw left him and Liu Yun stunned.

He originally imagined that Jing Daoxian was plundering the palace, but the situation was completely different. Jing Daoxian stood inside the door, holding the Yin Yang Mirror with both hands. His body was covered in sweat as though he had just been fished out of water.

The Yin Yang Mirror emitted divine light. And in the hall opposite the Yin Yang Mirror, there was a five-foot-long sword hanging.

The divine light emitted by the sword collided with the Yin Yang Mirror’s divine light. It was not at all inferior. It even seemed to be suppressing the Yin Yang Mirror.

“Holy sh*t, what sword is that? It can actually suppress the Yin Yang Mirror?” Liu Yun was alarmed. He didn’t dare enter the palace and only sized up the sword from the outside.

Zhou Wen was also sizing up the sword. The Yin Yang Mirror was already a Companion Beast at the Terror grade. For the sword to be able to suppress it, it was clearly extraordinary.

The ancient sword was simple and unadorned. It was actually a stone sword. Although it didn’t look eye-catching and there weren’t any beautiful gems embedded on the sword or scabbard, the sword beam it emitted left one shuddering in fear.
