Chapter 1667 Why Not?

“It’s my decision to head to Guide Ancient City. It’s also an order. It’s not a discussion,” Honn Shinsakura said calmly.

His tone was extremely calm, but it was as though he ignited gasoline. It wasn’t just the elder who had argued with Honn Shinsakura. The other Elders also revealed looks of indignation. All of them opened their mouths. Some cursed angrily, while others tried to persuade him nicely. There were even some who criticized Honn Shinsakura in their capacities as his elders. Their words implied that they didn’t want Honn Shinsakura to be stubborn. Otherwise, he would definitely harm more than ten thousand disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. It was even possible that he would destroy the foundation Sei Gasakai had painstakingly built.

Seeing the Elders saying all kinds of words, Honn Shinsakura was about to say something when he suddenly saw a white-robed female swordsman walk in. He closed his mouth and looked at the female swordsman.

“Elders, would you mind listening to me?” the female swordsman asked the Elders.

“Shiraishi Satomi, you came just in time. Quick, come and persuade your senior brother. He wants to destroy the foundation that the Sword Sage has painstakingly built…” When the elders saw the female swordsman, their eyes immediately lit up. They invited her to join their camp to make a collective bid to persuade Honn Shinsakura otherwise.

Sei Gasakai had many disciples, but the only ones who could obtain his true teachings were Honn Shinsakura and Shiraishi Satomi. Although Honn Shinsakura had inherited the position of Palace Lord, Shiraishi Satomi’s status in the Niten Flying Immortal Palace was still very high. Her relationship with Honn Shinsakura was relatively good, so Honn Shinsakura would likely consider her words seriously.

“Elders, the Palace Lord’s decision is right. We should head to Guide Ancient City and not the six families.” Shiraishi Satomi’s words left the Elders dumbfounded.

“Shiraishi Satomi, why are you going crazy with the Palace Lord?” The Elders looked at Shiraishi Satomi in puzzlement.

“I’m not crazy, much less the Palace Lord. Guide Ancient City is our best choice, not the six families,” Shiraishi Satomi said firmly.

“Why?” The Elders were even more puzzled. They really couldn’t think of any reason to choose the tiny Guide Ancient City under the An family instead of the six families.

“Because Zhou Wen’s there.” When she said that, Shiraishi Satomi’s eyes seemed to twinkle.

The Elders were stunned. This was the second time they had heard this today. Honn Shinsakura had first given this answer, and now, Shiraishi Satomi had given the same answer. It was unbelievable that the two cornerstones of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace had given such an answer.

“Zhou Wen is indeed someone remarkable. There are also rumors in the outside world that he’s Deceit King. Ignoring the fact that he might not be Deceit King, even if he really is, the fact that he hasn’t been chosen by the dimension only proves that his potential is limited. It’s not worth us betting the foundation of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace on him…” an Elder persuaded.

“Third Elder is right. Besides, what kind of place is Guide Ancient City? There are strange dimensional zones everywhere, and the environment is not much better than at sea. It’s even more terrifying. In the future, the dimensional zones will break out on a large scale, and the situation might be even worse than at sea. Wouldn’t joining them be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire?”

“Definitely not. Even if we are considering going to Guide Ancient City, we should directly contact Luoyang’s An family. Isn’t going to Guide Ancient City lowering our status?”

“Guide Ancient City is definitely not a good place…”

The Elders began persuading Shiraishi Satomi again. No matter how good Shiraishi Satomi and Honn Shinsakura’s relationship with Zhou Wen was, they didn’t believe that it was a place worth staking the foundation of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.

“What if Zhou Wen is Human Sovereign?” Shiraishi Satomi suddenly said.

The Elders who kept talking immediately fell silent as they stared at Shiraishi Satomi as though they had frozen. They even forgot to close their mouths.

“What did you just say?” An Elder felt that he had definitely heard wrongly and asked Shiraishi Satomi.

“If Zhou Wen is Human Sovereign, is he worth entrusting?” Shiraishi Satomi asked. “Shiraishi Satomi, don’t spout nonsense just to convince us. Back when Human Sovereign killed Di Tian, Zhou Wen wasn’t even twenty years old. He was just a kid. How could he be Human Sovereign?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That’s right, that’s right. Zhou Wen is definitely not Human Sovereign. Don’t think that you can fool us and get us to agree to go to Guide Ancient City.”

“Even if Zhou Wen is really Human Sovereign, he hasn’t been chosen by the dimension. It’s unknown if he can still fight representatives. Furthermore, he will be outnumbered…”

Shiraishi Satomi was taken aback. She originally imagined that as long as she informed the Elders that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign, she would definitely gain their support. She never expected such an outcome.

Shiraishi Satomi was momentarily at a loss for words as she looked at Honn Shinsakura with a bitter smile.

Honn Shinsakura had long expected such an outcome, so he hadn’t revealed the secret of Zhou Wen being Human Sovereign. Firstly, it was useless, and secondly, it could easily cause Zhou Wen trouble.

Seeing Shiraishi Satomi’s pleading gaze, Honn Shinsakura slowly said, “Elders, do you know why the Sword Dao my master created is called the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū? Why is our place called the Niten Flying Immortal Palace?”

“The Sword Sage said that he received pointers from an expert, so he was able to create the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. As for why it’s called the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū, he didn’t say anything…” an Elder said after some thought.

The Niten Flying Immortal Palace didn’t discriminate. Most of the disciples were actually recruited from other factions. There weren’t many disciples personally taught by Sei Gasakai.

In recent years, due to the harsh living conditions overseas, many small factions had joined the Niten Flying Immortal Palace to obtain Sei Gasakai’s protection.

Most of these Elders used to be rulers of a region, not fellow disciples of Sei Gasakai.

“You are right. Master created the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū thanks to the pointers of an expert. Back then, I was only a teenager. I followed Master to the mainland to cultivate and met a peerless expert in Luoyang’s peony garden,” Honn Shinsakura said.

“I know about this. Before the Niten Flying Immortal Palace was established, Lord Sword Sage traveled to the mainland. Back then, Lord Sword Sage had already reached a Sword Dao bottleneck and was just short of creating the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū.Because he encountered that expert and was defeated by him, he gained some insight. After returning, he created the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. Palace Master, you should be referring to that time, right?” a jaundiced Elder recalled.

Honn Shinsakura nodded slightly. “That’s right. Do you know who the person I met with Master was?”

“Naturally, he’s a highly-respected senior expert,” said the jaundiced Elder.

“What if I say that the person we met was only a youth who was about the same age as me and was only fifteen or sixteen years old?” Honn Shinsakura swept his gaze across everyone’s faces and enunciated each word clearly.

“Impossible!” the Elders shouted in unison. They naturally refused to believe that such a thing would happen.

A fifteen-year-old youth had defeated Sei Gasakai, who was nearly a Sword Sage back then. This was simply a fantasy.

“Why not?” A voice sounded from outside. Everyone was overjoyed when they heard it. They looked outside and saw Sei Gasakai slowly walking over.
