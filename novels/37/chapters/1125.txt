Chapter 1126: Trapped on Lone Island

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen frowned slightly. Just as he was about to summon his Companion Beast to fight the baldy, he suddenly felt a powerful spatial fluctuation.

Almost instantly, everyone felt the intense spatial fluctuations. In the next moment, before they could react, they saw the lighting in front of them change. The scenery around them no longer looked the same.

Zhou Wen stood on the spot without moving, but the scene in front of him had turned into a white beach.

Previously, he was clearly standing on his boat, but now, there was actual sand beneath his feet.

Spatial powers? Furthermore, spatial teleportation on a large scale? Zhou Wen looked around and was immediately alarmed to discover that he was on Bride Island—the one he had seen at sea.

Standing on the beach, Zhou Wen could still see Emotional Island, which was across the sea from Bride Island. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Not far from the beach, Ji Moqing was lying on the ground. She looked unconscious. Her level was too low and her body was too weak. Zhou Wen didn’t feel anything from the spatial fluctuations, but she couldn’t withstand it and had fainted.

Zhou Wen didn’t see anyone else. It was as though the spatial fluctuations had teleported them to different locations on Bride Island.

Not in the mood to bother with Ji Moqing, Zhou Wen summoned a Poison Bat and got it to fly out of Bride Island. It hadn’t flown far when its body seemed to be sliced open by an invisible force. Blood spewed out and fell into the sea, dyeing the seawater red.

A spatial rift?

Zhou Wen summoned another group of Poison Bats and sent them flying in different directions.

The outcome was the same. No matter where the Poison Bats flew, they would definitely be sliced apart once they were ten meters away from the island.

If Bride Island isn’t totally enveloped by spatial powers, it means that there’s an extremely terrifying spatial creature controlling everything, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

However, Zhou Wen felt that the former was more likely. His present sensing abilities were excellent. If such an existence controlled everything, he should have sensed something.

If the entire island is enveloped by spatial powers, departure with teleportation and teleportation powers will definitely be prevented. Zhou Wen thought about how he could leave the island.

As Zhou Wen was in thought, Ji Moqing slowly woke up. When she was almost completely awake, she realized that Zhou Wen was beside her. She immediately jolted and got up to run.

However, as Ji Moqing ran, she realized that not only was her body not moving forward, but she was also retreating. Then, she felt a hand grab the back of her neck.

“Lord, please spare me. I really didn’t want to be your enemy. It’s that baldy who wants to deal with you. It really has nothing to do with me,” Ji Moqing pleaded with a sullen face.

“Your brother-in-law doesn’t seem to agree,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

He didn’t want to make things difficult for Ji Moqing. He had taken note of Ji Moqing trying to persuade Fang Mingsu previously.

The reason he had captured her was because he didn’t want her to run around the island and die here for no reason. After all, she was a human life as well.

Heavens, what sins did I commit in my previous life? Why did you send me to this devil’s side again? Ji Moqing was utterly depressed, but she had no choice but to smile. “My brother-in-law doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. That’s why he made an enemy of an expert like you. It really has nothing to do with me. I know how powerful you are. How can I be your enemy? Just a sneeze from you can kill me a thousand or ten thousand times...”

Although Ji Moqing said that, she was thinking to herself, Hmph, you devil. You can’t even compare to my brother-in-law. Otherwise, why would you release me the moment you saw him? Aren’t you afraid of him? Anyway, this island isn’t big. Let’s see what you can do to me when he comes to find me.

“Very good. I like good children who tell the truth,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“I don’t have any other merits, I just don’t know how to lie.” Ji Moqing heaved a sigh of relief when she saw this, thinking that she had escaped another calamity.

“Alright then. You will keep telling the truth from now on. If I hear you lie or if what your truths sound unpleasant, I’ll chop off your head,” Zhou Wen said.

“You... are really a smartas...” Ji Moqing had just said a word when she saw Zhou Wen look at her. She immediately changed her words.” You are so smart and handsome. I don’t know how to describe you. Even those fancy words can’t describe one in ten thousand of your good qualities...”

“Follow me. Let’s talk as we walk. If I hear any repeated truths, I’ll immediately behead you.” Zhou Wen walked slowly along the beach, hoping to find Shiraishi Satomi.

Bride Island didn’t look big, but Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t reach the center of the island. There seemed to be a mysterious force guarding it.

Zhou Wen could see a village in the middle of the island with his naked eye, but he wasn’t willing to take the risk. He wanted to walk around the beach and see if he could find Shiraishi Satomi.

Even if he couldn’t find her, just finding the tiny palm symbol would be even better.

“Your eyes are like the sea of stars, deep and charming. Your voice is even more moving than the singing of angels. Please, let me hear your voice again. Even the word ‘scram’ will make me blush for a long time. You are the greatest man on Earth...”

Ji Moqing had long believed that Zhou Wen was a devil, so she took his words seriously. She racked her brains to think of all sorts of praises for Zhou Wen, but she didn’t dare stop for a moment. She didn’t care if her words disgusted her.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t pay attention to what Ji Moqing was saying. He kept staring ahead. There was a human-like figure standing by the beach.

The person was standing by the sea with a lute on his back, as though he was looking into the distance.

From the point of view of an ordinary person, he seemed to be a zither player, but Zhou Wen could tell from his extremely weak aura that he wasn’t a human, but a dimensional creature.

Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate, who had long recovered. She came out in her Terror form and sat on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.

Ji Moqing couldn’t see Demonic Neonate in her Terror form, nor was she in the mood to look. She was still pondering over what words to praise Zhou Wen with.

However, the zither player by the sea seemed to sense something as he turned to look at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he prepared for battle, but he heard the zither player say to him, “The path ahead is dangerous. It’s best you return.”

Zhou Wen didn’t know if he really had no ill intentions or if he had other motives, so he asked, “What’s the danger?”

“I can’t say.” The zither player shook his head and turned back to continue looking at the distant sea.

Seeing that he had no intention of fighting, Zhou Wen attempted to circle around him and continue walking forward.

“If you encounter a woman standing by the bridge, don’t approach her or speak to her.” Zhou Wen had already walked over with Ji Moqing when the zither player suddenly said this, but he obviously had no intention of chasing after him.
