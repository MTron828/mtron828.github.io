Chapter 1074: Birth from Extreme Death

Translator: CKtalon

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was just about to ask when he saw that the logger had stopped moving. There were no longer any signs of life—he was probably dead.

Why don’t you make yourself clear before you die! Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. However, from the looks of it, the logger didn’t seem to have any intention of saying anything else. Otherwise, he would have said it before he died.

However, it was difficult to guess what the logger had meant.

There were many interpretations for this sentence. Perhaps it was because Zhou Wen couldn’t resist the temptation and wanted to obtain the Companion Beast on the Moon, so he had come to chop down the Tree of Immortality. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It could also be that there was some secret beneath the Tree of Immortality. In the future, Zhou Wen would have to chop down the Tree of Immortality to find out the secret.

There were too many possibilities. It was also possible that the logger had said it casually to deliberately arouse Zhou Wen’s curiosity.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to continue guessing. At the very least, from the looks of it, the Moon’s continued existence was better than it being destroyed.

As he walked towards the logger, Zhou Wen planned on bringing his corpse back. After all, this body belonged to Wei Ge. At the very least, he could return his body to his family in one piece.

When he arrived in front of the corpse, Zhou Wen extended his hands and placed them under the corpse’s armpits. Just as he was about to lift the corpse up, he suddenly saw the eyes widen.

Zhou Wen’s reaction was extremely fast as he instantly made a decision. If he retreated, he would have fallen for the logger’s scheme. Therefore, Zhou Wen did the opposite. Instead of retreating, he advanced and pressed his body against the logger’s body. His hands passed through his armpits before grabbing his neck. He wanted to use force to snap his neck.

“It’s... It’s me... Don’t... Cough, cough...” The logger said a few words before his neck was pressed down by a powerful force, preventing him from saying a word.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but slow down when he heard those words. He didn’t continue.

This was because the pitch and tone of the words didn’t sound like the logger’s. Instead, they sounded like Wei Ge’s.

“President Wei?” Zhou Wen released his hand and retreated as he looked at Wei Ge in disbelief.

If it was the logger, he would have killed him, but it also seemed impossible for it to be Wei Ge.

Be it Wei Ge’s consciousness controlling the body or the logger’s consciousness controlling the body, the injuries this body suffered were fatal. It was useless no matter whose consciousness it was. If the body died, the consciousness could only perish.

The wound on Wei Ge’s chest was still there. His heart had been pierced through. The logger was dead, so how could Wei Ge still be alive?

“It’s me.” Wei Ge looked down at the wound on his chest and said with a grimace, “I don’t have much time left. Quickly think of a way to save me. Think of a way to stabilize my injuries first. Just don’t let me die.”

“Are you really President Wei?” Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge suspiciously. He was somewhat suspicious that the logger wasn’t dead and was trying to trick Zhou Wen into treating him.

“Do you still remember when I went to look for you after graduation? We even chatted a little. Do you remember the sentence about ‘barely defeat the heavens?’” Wei Ge said.

“The logger has occupied the body, so he might have absorbed your memories...” Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge warily.

Wei Ge didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “My dear junior, I’m really Wei Ge. Previously, I recognized that the bone pottery artifact was a sacrificial offering to invite a deity’s descent. I knew that I might be possessed by some kind of spiritual body. Furthermore, I also knew that Shen Yuchi would most likely make me a sacrifice. Therefore, it was better to take the initiative to touch the bone pottery artifact.”

“My Life Providence is Birth from Extreme Death. It’s too troublesome to explain. To put it simply, after my body dies, I can still exist in a living-dead state for a period of time. If I heal my body during this period of time, I can still live. I can’t hold on much longer. If you don’t treat my injuries, I’ll really die...” Wei Ge said gloomily.

Zhou Wen saw that his tone and demeanor were indeed different from the logger’s. He believed him a little.

This was because Zhou Wen had previously determined that Wei Ge might know the origins of the bone pottery artifact, so he had taken the initiative to take it. He definitely had some means.

Previously, Zhou Wen had believed that Wei Ge’s judgment was wrong, so his means had failed to take effect and he had ended up dying tragically.

Without much hesitation, Zhou Wen switched to the Primordial Human Sovereign Life Soul and threw a punch at Wei Ge’s wound.

The fist blasted into Wei Ge’s heart, but when it pulled out, the wound on his heart healed significantly.

Berserk punches came one after another. Under the strange force, the fatal blow to Wei Ge’s heart miraculously healed completely. There was no longer any wound on his chest.

However, due to the excessive blood loss, Wei Ge’s body was still on the brink of failure.

Zhou Wen summoned a few more pill essences like the Rejuvenation Pill and got Wei Ge to swallow them. Only then did his body recover its vitality. As for the glow in Wei Ge’s eyes, it grew stronger and stronger. Soon, he was back to being a healthy person.

“Zhou Wen, I’ll have to thank you for your help. Otherwise, I would have really died here,” Wei Ge said as he stood up.

“If the logger hadn’t died, would you have been able to retrieve your body?” Zhou Wen asked Wei Ge.

“No.” Wei Ge shook his head.

“If I hadn’t treated your injuries, would you have lived?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“No.” Wei Ge shook his head again.

“Then why did you make such a bet?” Zhou Wen felt that the conditions for survival were too harsh. If he wasn’t here, Wei Ge would definitely be dead.

“As there are benefits that are hundreds or even thousands of times greater, it was worth taking the risk. The logger used my body and died in my body. The wealth he left behind for this body is unimaginable. It was worth betting my life.” Wei Ge smiled and continued, “Of course, there’s another important reason why I was willing to take the bet.”

“What was it?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Because you are here,” Wei Ge said solemnly.

“You think too highly of me.” Zhou Wen shook his head and smiled bitterly.

...

When Zhou Wen and company were on the Moon, the ranking battle on Earth continued. Ya constantly faced challenges from different Guardians and had yet to be defeated.

However, Ya’s various abilities were constantly probed by the Guardians. Furthermore, the opponents that appeared were getting stronger. His victories became increasingly hard-won, but he still hadn’t lost.

In Forbidden City that was enveloped by fog, a distorted figure descended from the void. The figure was very similar to the figure that had changed the cube’s battle rules twice. Or rather, it was the same creature.

The figure floated in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony. The door to the Hall of Supreme Harmony seemed to be opened automatically by some invisible force. In the hall, there was a log lying flat.

“Polestar, why haven’t you chosen a contractor yet?” An ethereal voice sounded from the figure made of light and shadows.

“That’s my business. What has it got to do with you?” A cold woman’s voice sounded from the log.
