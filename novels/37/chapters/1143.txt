Chapter 1144: Tsukuyomi’s Request

Translator: CKtalon

Great Brahma’s fourth face was definitely a powerful killing machine. It was extremely powerful at the Terror grade, but its indiscriminate killing was a huge problem.

Great Brahma was Zhou Wen’s Terror form, so he couldn’t put too much distance between him and Great Brahma. Otherwise, Great Brahma would automatically return to his body.

Unless Zhou Wen could withstand the power of Great Brahma’s fourth face, using it again was equivalent to suicide.

Great Brahma’s power seems somewhat similar to Truth Listener. Could there be a relationship between the two? Zhou Wen felt that the power of Great Brahma’s fourth face was indeed somewhat similar to Truth Listener when it released six earrings. It just wasn’t as strong.

Zhou Wen was considering how to use Great Brahma’s power when Tsukuyomi walked over.

“What’s wrong?” Zhou Wen looked up at Tsukuyomi and asked.

“The game is boring.” Although Tsukuyomi was holding her phone, she had already quit the game.

“Why don’t I take you to get something to eat?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“Human food is no different from rocks to me. It is all material energy,” Tsukuyomi said indifferently.

Zhou Wen immediately felt a headache. If he were made to kill dimensional creatures, he could think of a way to defeat his opponent.

However, he really couldn’t guess a woman’s thoughts.

“Have you been to school?” Tsukuyomi suddenly asked Zhou Wen.

“Of course.” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled, unsure why Tsukuyomi would suddenly ask such a question.

“What’s it like to go to school?” Tsukuyomi asked again.

“It’s just studying. What else would it be?” Zhou Wen found Tsukuyomi’s question odd.

“Then take me to school,” Tsukuyomi blinked and said.

“School?” Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss. He didn’t know what Tsukuyomi meant.

“Dimensional creatures are born with knowledge, so there’s no concept of schooling. I want to know what it’s like to go to school. Take me there,” Tsukuyomi said seriously.

So that’s how it is. Zhou Wen thought about it and realized that it was true. Dimensional creatures really didn’t need to study like humans.

However, Tsukuyomi’s request left Zhou Wen in a dilemma.

A school wasn’t like street markets. It wasn’t a place he could go as he wished. Although Zhou Wen had been a student in the past, he hadn’t graduated. Five years had passed and his former classmates had already graduated. Zhou Wen also had no intention of returning to school to study.

Looking at Tsukuyomi’s expression, Zhou Wen knew that they had to go. After some thought, he had an idea.

It wouldn’t be difficult for Zhou Wen to take Tsukuyomi into Sunset College, but it would be too dangerous. If Tsukuyomi ended up p*ssed and started a massacre at Sunset College, no one would be able to stop her. It would probably result in a bloodbath in Luoyang.

However, he had to agree to Tsukuyomi’s request. Otherwise, she would immediately fall out with him.

Therefore, after weighing the pros and cons, Zhou Wen planned on taking Tsukuyomi to the Royal College and letting her experience and enjoy the school’s atmosphere for two days.

Royal College was a very famous university in the Federation. It was ranked above Sunset College.

Royal College didn’t usually recruit foreign students. It was a school that only the children of the Cape family and its vassal families could attend. The people inside were basically people related to the Cape family.

Zhou Wen didn’t have a good relationship with the Cape family. Although he didn’t go so far as to destroy the Cape family, any nasty job or operation was linked to them.

After making up his mind, Zhou Wen led Tsukuyomi to the Royal College in West District.

The two of them had spatial powers, so they naturally didn’t need to walk. After Zhou Wen explained the location, Tsukuyomi directly teleported him over. Tsukuyomi’s long-distance teleportation was fast and accurate, much better than Zhou Wen’s. As expected of a Calamity. Zhou Wen only sighed. His level was still lacking.

It was definitely too late to complete the matriculation procedures now. Zhou Wen didn’t plan on really studying. All he wanted to do was take Tsukuyomi around, so he planned on just gate-crashing certain classes.

Royal College was a sealed college. It was difficult for outsiders to enter, but to Zhou Wen, it was just a matter of teleportation.

Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi appeared out of nowhere in Royal College without attracting anyone’s attention. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Is this a school?” Tsukuyomi looked around as though she was very curious.

“Yes, this is one of the most famous schools for humans,” Zhou Wen said.

“Whose statue is that? Why is it placed there?” Tsukuyomi pointed at a spot near the entrance and asked.

Zhou Wen turned his head and saw a statue erected at the school’s entrance. It was a person holding a sword that was slashing at the sky.

Although it was only a statue, it revealed a might that seemed to slice the sky into two.

Zhou Wen looked at the statue’s posture and found it somewhat familiar. When he carefully looked at the statue’s face, he was immediately enlightened. Wasn’t this him slicing through Di Tian’s nine firmaments?

“This is a memorial statue. The engraved figure is called Human Sovereign.” Zhou Wen felt a little embarrassed when he introduced it to Tsukuyomi.

“The Human Sovereign who defeated Di Tian in the cube’s arena?” Tsukuyomi clearly knew of Human Sovereign’s deeds.

In fact, as long as one went online, it was very easy to obtain information regarding Human Sovereign. It wasn’t strange for Tsukuyomi to know.

“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered with a nod, pretending that it had nothing to do with him.

The two of them chatted as they walked in Royal College. Zhou Wen originally believed that it wouldn’t be difficult to gatecrash on campus.

Unfortunately, he had forgotten that this was Royal College. Furthermore, it only recruited students from families like the Capes, so basically everyone in this school was from the West District.

Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi looked like people from the East District. After walking around the school for a while, they attracted the attention of many people.

Thankfully, most of the students were only curious and looked at them a few more times without any intention of stopping them.

After walking for a while, a female student finally walked over and stopped them. “Are you students from Bright Prospects College?”

“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen didn’t deny it as he asked.

“I especially admire your school’s Professor Tomorrow. I heard that he’s leading a team to our Royal College for an exchange. Is that true? Will he go on stage to give a speech? Can I ask you to help me get the signature of Professor Tomorrow?” the girl said it all in one breath.

“Sorry, I don’t know Professor Tomorrow. It’s best you ask him yourself.” Zhou Wen obviously didn’t know Professor Tomorrow.

“Aren’t you students from Bright Prospects College? How can you not know Professor Tomorrow?” the girl said in disbelief.

“I really don’t know him,” Zhou Wen repeated before preparing to leave with Tsukuyomi.

“It’s fine if you don’t want to help. Why are you lying? You’re clearly walking towards the venue,” the girl muttered as she followed. Zhou Wen and company were heading in the direction of the venue.
