Chapter 1425: Only One Person Can Leave Alive

When Zhou Wen saw Xiao, he immediately engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.

Since Xiao could make the Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods commit suicide and Zhou Wen was only at the Terror grade, he had to mount a full defense to not succumb to Xiao’s abilities.

Even with the double protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and Truth Listener, Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He focused his gaze on Xiao and grabbed the hilt of the Immortal Culling Sword again.

“In our battle today, only one person can leave alive. Please do your best. Let Venus see who has the right to be the owner of the Venusian Companion Beast,” Xiao said as he walked over step by step.

Zhou Wen never liked to waste his breath, much less talk nonsense with enemies. He immediately unsheathed the Immortal Culling Sword in his hand and slashed down with Immortal Slaying.

Zhou Wen’s Speed and Strength were infinitely close to the Calamity grade. With Immortal Slaying combined with the Immortal Culling Sword, he could produce the power to kill a Calamity-grade creature.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the Immortal Culling Sword couldn’t be taken into the game, Zhou Wen would have long used it to kill the Kui. He wouldn’t have needed to go through so much trouble using the Tyrant Behemoth boxing glove.

Zhou Wen had previously seen Xiao. Back then, he was still very far from the Calamity grade. Now, it was certain that he had only recently advanced to the Calamity grade. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that he could withstand the power of the Immortal Culling Sword.

However, Xiao didn’t dodge. When the Immortal Culling Sword reached him, he reached out to his waist. There was also a sword there, but it was different from the East District-like Immortal Culling Sword. The sword in his hand was a western-styled rapier.

The rapier was silver in color; even the scabbard was the same. It looked like it was made of pure silver, and the patterns on it were exquisite.

At the instant the rapier was unsheathed, Zhou Wen saw silver light collide with the Immortal Culling Sword.

Clang!

When the two swords clashed, the shockwave produced forced Zhou Wen and Xiao to retreat. The shockwave constantly spread out and struck the metal wall with a boom.

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he looked at the silver rapier in Xiao’s hand. According to what he knew, a West District weapon like the rapier wasn’t steeped in history. It was unlikely to appear in myths and legends.

However, the silver rapier didn’t show any damage after clashing with the Immortal Culling Sword. Clearly, it wasn’t an ordinary item, but Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out its origins. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Lord Holy God is right. The sword forged from Holy Metal can indeed block that Immortal Culling Sword.” The Saints watching were delighted when they saw the Immortal Culling Sword blocked.

“Of course. When has Lord Holy God ever been wrong? That’s the Holy Sword that Lord Holy God personally bestowed to Xiao. The Holy Metal used to create the Holy Sword is the foundation of the Holy Temple. It was baptized by Holy Energy for countless years and has long been a supreme Holy item. It’s virtually indestructible. How can it be easily damaged?”

“Human Sovereign is only at the Terror grade. All he relies on is the Immortal Culling Sword. Now that the Holy Sword can withstand its blow, it will be a piece of cake for Xiao to defeat him.”

The Saints discussed spiritedly, but inside the Venusian dimensional zone, Xiao didn’t immediately counterattack.

He levitated in midair with his rapier casually held in front of his chest. He looked extremely elegant and natural, like an otherworldly swordsman.

“You haven’t reached the Calamity grade. If I defeat you with the Calamity Zone, I’m afraid you will die with a grievance,” Xiao said to Zhou Wen.

“Why? Do you plan on not using the Calamity Zone?” Zhou Wen asked calmly.

“Indeed. I’ll let you see the true strength of a Saint,” Xiao said as he instantly stabbed out with his rapier. The blade vanished from Zhou Wen’s vision, preventing him from seeing the trajectory of the strike.

Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he instantly moved horizontally. At the instant he moved, a silver beam flashed from his head, almost brushing past his hair.

If Zhou Wen had been any slower, his head would have been penetrated by the sword.

That was fast!?Zhang Yuzhi’s heart nearly popped out when she saw this.

An Sheng, Li Xuan, An Jing, and company were also watching the battle. They were so nervous that their palms were sweating.

Xiao gracefully followed as he stabbed out again and again. The rapier and his figure were unbelievably fast. His usual speed could reach the speed of light, but the instant he struck out, he was so fast that even Zhou Wen couldn’t see the trajectory of the sword.

Even Tsukuyomi’s expression turned solemn.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Boom! Boom!

The clashing sounds of the blades and the impacts of the shockwave constantly echoed. Xiao’s terrifying rapier had been completely blocked by Zhou Wen. None of the strikes could injure him.

“Impossible… Although Human Sovereign is strong… it’s all thanks to the power that the sword gives him. That’s how he can kill a Calamity-grade. However, his speed and reaction shouldn’t reach the level of a Calamity-grade. Furthermore, Xiao’s stabbing speed probably can’t even be seen by ordinary Calamity-grade creatures. How did Human Sovereign block it?” The Saints were alarmed.

Li Xuan and the others who were on good terms with Zhou Wen, as well as the ordinary humans, were pleasantly surprised. Wang Lu also heaved a sigh of relief as she held her hands in front of her chest. Unknowingly, she was already covered in a cold sweat.

“I knew it. What kind of existence is Human Sovereign? A mere Calamity-grade can’t do anything to him.” The people who had held their breaths while watching were immediately overjoyed when they saw that Human Sovereign remained calm and composed under the unbelievable rapier. He had blocked all of Xiao’s attacks.

“I’m starting to doubt if Human Sovereign is really pure human. Such an ability really doesn’t seem like what a pure human is capable of,” Zhang Chunqiu said jokingly.

“Indeed. He can actually see the trajectory of the sword. Such eyesight should have exceeded the limits of a Terror-grade?” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“No, he didn’t see it, nor can he see it. The ability I’m referring to isn’t this,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“He can’t see it?” Zhang Yuzhi was taken aback as she asked in disbelief, “How does he block it if he can’t see it? Furthermore, he looks to be at ease. It doesn’t look like it was luck.”

“Of course it isn’t luck. True, you can’t say that he can’t see it. It can only be said that he can’t see the rapier’s trajectory, but he can see Xiao’s movements.” Noticing Zhang Yuzhi’s incomprehension, Zhang Chunqiu continued explaining, “Xiao’s rapier is unbelievably fast. It might also be a spatial ability. No matter what ability it is, it’s impossible for the Terror-grade Human Sovereign to see the trajectory of the rapier. Even if he can see it, it’s impossible for him to react.”

“Therefore, Human Sovereign isn’t looking at the rapier at all. He fixes his eyes on Xiao’s actions. Although Xiao’s speed is very fast, he isn’t as fast as the rapier. It’s still within Human Sovereign’s reaction speed. Human Sovereign uses Xiao’s actions to determine his target and block his attack.” After Zhang Chunqiu explained, he couldn’t help but praise, “It sounds simple, but a battle at that level is ever-changing. To be able to accurately block an almost invisible sword with just the other party’s actions is truly shocking. Even if I had the same strength as him, I might not be able to do it to such an extent. This fellow doesn’t look human at all.”
