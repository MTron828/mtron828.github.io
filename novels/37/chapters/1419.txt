Chapter 1420: Cruel Universe

When Zhou Wen landed on the ground, he felt softness beneath his feet as though he had stepped on something extremely soft. He hurriedly flew up and stabilized himself.

Only then did he look down and see that it was a large asteroid. The shape of the asteroid looked like a bowl held up diagonally. And in the crater, there was a soft bed.

At that moment, Tsukuyomi was already lying on the bed. She was lying diagonally with one hand supporting her cheek as she looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile.

“Is this where you live?” Zhou Wen looked around curiously and saw that it was an asteroid belt. There were strange asteroids everywhere.

Apart from Tsukuyomi and this bed, there were no signs of life.

“That’s right. What do you think?” Tsukuyomi said.

“The environment’s a little lacking. Why don’t you find a better place?” Just as Zhou Wen said that, Tsukuyomi suddenly flicked her sleeve. The sleeve transformed into a white ribbon that wrapped around Zhou Wen’s body and pulled him down.

Zhou Wen fell onto the bed as his expression changed slightly. He wanted to ask Tsukuyomi what she was doing, but before he could say a word, she leaned against him and covered his mouth with her hand.

“Don’t speak.” Tsukuyomi’s pink lips were almost by Zhou Wen’s ear. Her voice was so soft that even Zhou Wen could hardly hear her. Her breath made Zhou Wen’s ears itch.

Zhou Wen didn’t sense Tsukuyomi using strength, so he didn’t retaliate. He lay there quietly and used Truth Listener to probe his surroundings.

Soon, Zhou Wen discovered a problem. Not far from the asteroid belt was a huge alien beast patrolling the area.

The alien beast’s body was like a stingray, but it was many times bigger than the stingrays on Earth. Furthermore, its entire body was transparent like crystal. There were thin threads that emitted blue light in its body, like a human’s vascular network.

Zhou Wen felt a terrifying aura from the strange creature and immediately held his breath.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare mess around with something that even Tsukuyomi was afraid of.

The alien beast swam through the asteroid belt. There were a few times when it was less than a thousand meters away from the asteroid they were on. Tsukuyomi remained motionless as though she had been petrified. Zhou Wen could only mimic her.

After a while, the alien beast slowly left and vanished into the distant asteroid belt.

“What’s that?” Zhou Wen could only sense that it was a dimensional creature, but he didn’t know what kind it was.

“A Calamity-grade creature whose level is much higher than mine. If it discovers us, we might become food.” Tsukuyomi lay diagonally beside Zhou Wen with one hand supporting her cheek. Her other hand was still pressing down on Zhou Wen’s chest as though she had no intention of letting him get up.

“Level?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

“Although we are both at the Calamity grade, there’s still a difference in strength. There’s a huge difference in strength between levels; the strength of one’s domain will experience a qualitative leap likewise,” Tsukuyomi said.

“What levels are they?” Zhou Wen hurriedly pressed. He knew too little about the Calamity grade, and he could take this opportunity to understand more. Perhaps he could find a way to advance to the Calamity grade.

“Human Realm, Hell, and Heaven correspond to three different domains. I’m still at the level of the Human Realm,” Tsukuyomi answered.

“There aren’t any Calamity-grade experts among us humans, right? Why would Calamity-grade levels be named after humans?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

According to what he knew, there didn’t seem to be any pure Calamity-grade humans. Ignoring that, he had never heard of pure Mythical humans either.

“How would I know? This is the division of the Calamity grade according to ancient legends. If you want to know, you can return to countless years ago and find the answer yourself.” Tsukuyomi continued with a smile, “A Calamity creature like me that was just born on Earth doesn’t even count as the Human Realm—a pure Calamity rookie. I’m only at the Human Realm now, but there are Calamity creatures at the Hell and Heaven levels in the universe. The difference is huge.”

“Why are there so many powerful Calamity creatures in the universe?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown.

“Some of them came from Earth, while others came from other planets,” Tsukuyomi said. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Just like the dimensional creatures on Venus? However, the dimensional creatures on Venus don’t leave Venus. That so-called Venusian Companion Beast needs to reach a contract with other creatures to leave Venus.” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that so many Calamity-grade creatures had reached a contract.

“It’s not wrong to say that they need to reach a contract, but there are also situations where there’s no need to reach a contract. For example, when a planet’s lifespan reaches its end, which means that the Companion Beasts inside have already grown to their limits. Even if they don’t need to contract with others, they will automatically be released because of the planet’s destruction. That way, the Companion Beasts that appear will become ownerless Companion Beasts. Typically speaking, due to the long period of growth, these Companion Beasts are very powerful. Most of them are at the Heaven level when they are liberated. Of course, there are also planets that are accidentally destroyed before they reach the end of their lifespans. Then, the Companion Beasts produced will be weaker.”

After a pause, Tsukuyomi continued, “Of course, a portion of them are able to come out via reaching contracts. However, only creatures from Earth can contract with Companion Beasts. If those fellows from the dimension want to contract with Companion Beasts in the universe, they need to do it through the bodies of Earthlings.”

“Wait, in other words, that powerful Calamity creature was actually a Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen suddenly came to a realization.

“That’s right.” Tsukuyomi nodded slightly.

“Then I should be able to contract it, right?” Zhou Wen asked with widened eyes.

If he could contract a Calamity-grade Companion Beast, he would really make a killing.

“Of course. However, such an ownerless Companion Beast is equivalent to a feral beast. It’s different from cats and dogs reared at home. It doesn’t like to be restrained. As long as you aren’t afraid of being killed, you can give it a try.” Tsukuyomi’s finger slid to Zhou Wen’s cheek and pinched his face with her fingers. With a smile, she continued, “You are so thick-skinned. Perhaps those powerful wild Companion Beasts will be moved by your shamelessness. They might really contract with you.”

“Even so, the universe is an excellent place for a Calamity creature born from Earth like you. As long as you can contract a few Companion Beasts, your strength will greatly increase. Why are you so afraid?” Zhou Wen was still somewhat puzzled.

Even if there were many Calamity-grade creatures in the universe, they wouldn’t hunt other Calamity-grade creatures for no reason, right?

“Do you know how Calamity creatures grow?” Tsukuyomi asked instead of answering.

“I haven’t advanced to the Calamity grade, so I’m not sure.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

“Ignoring growth, just maintaining one’s existence requires a large amount of energy. The higher one’s level is, the more energy one needs. And the best way to obtain energy is to devour other Calamity creatures.” Tsukuyomi’s words immediately made Zhou Wen understand the cruelty of the universe. The competition for survival was even crueler than Earth’s.
