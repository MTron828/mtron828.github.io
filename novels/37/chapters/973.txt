Chapter 974: Slaying Dragon Granny

Translator: CKtalon

“Will you let my sister off if I drink it?” Qin Ling said as she looked at the bottle in her hand. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Qin Ling, throw it away,” Miya struggled to say.

Dragon Grandma shook the rattle drum again. Miya was immediately strangled to the point of not being able to make another sound. All she could do was tremble in pain on the ground.

“Of course. I always keep my word. Today, your sister offended me, so one of you has to die. Between you and your sister, choose who is to die.” Dragon Granny smiled at Qin Ling and said, “Of course, you can choose not to drink it. You can let your sister die. Anyway, she doesn’t share the same father as you and can’t be considered a real sister, right?”

“I’ll drink it. Let my sister go,” Qin Ling said through gritted teeth.

“It’s easy for me to kill you. There’s no need to lie to you. Once you drink it, I’ll immediately release your sister,” said Dragon Granny slowly.

Miya failed to make a sound. She struggled to get up and snatch the bottle from Qin Ling’s hand, but Dragon Granny shook the rattle drum, causing Miya to immediately collapse on the deck and tremble in pain.

Miya knew that someone must have done something to her. Otherwise, with the power of Dragon Granny, it was impossible for her to be her match, much less torture her so badly.

However, Miya couldn’t recall when anyone had done something to her.

“Stop shaking. I’ll drink it,” Qin Ling said as she opened the bottle and was about to drink the liquid inside.

“Don’t drink it!” With a clear voice, a saber beam slashed at Dragon Granny.

“Little Feng!” Qin Ling was pleasantly surprised when she saw the person.

Feng Qiuyan was expressionless as he slashed at Dragon Granny with his Life Soul Saber.

Dragon Granny’s figure moved as she dodged Feng Qiuyan’s saber force. She originally wanted to counterattack, but she realized that Feng Qiuyan’s saber aura was like a surging river. She couldn’t find any flaws.

“Your saber art isn’t bad, but unfortunately, you are too weak.” As Dragon Granny spoke, she used the clam shell to block Feng Qiuyan’s saber before striking his chest, sending him flying.

“Little Feng!” Qin Ling flew over to catch Feng Qiuyan who had flown back, only to see Feng Qiuyan’s chest collapse and blood seep from the corner of his mouth.

“Sis Ling, I’m sorry I came late,” Feng Qiuyan said in his usual tone.

“You shouldn’t have come.” Qin Ling checked Feng Qiuyan’s injuries with a complicated expression. “How are you?”

“He won’t die yet. I’m in a good mood today. I just want to kill someone. Qin Ling, who do you think I should kill?” Dragon Granny stared at Feng Qiuyan and said.

Qin Ling looked at Miya and Feng Qiuyan. She held the bottle and was about to raise it when Feng Qiuyan grabbed the bottle and threw it to the ground.

However, the bottle was crack resistant. It didn’t shatter, and the liquid inside didn’t spill at all.

Feng Qiuyan’s actions immediately infuriated Dragon Granny. She originally wanted to trick Qin Ling into drinking it, but now, she could only use force.

A strange aura rose from the Dragon Granny’s body as her eyes suffused a red glow. She stared at Feng Qiuyan and wanted to kill him first before forcefully injecting the liquid into Qin Ling’s body.

Qin Ling wanted to help Feng Qiuyan block, but she was held back by him.

Feng Qiuyan slowly stood up and stared at Dragon Granny. He said, “Sorry for making you wait so long, but there were some things I needed to settle before I could come. Otherwise, it would be useless even if I came.”

As he spoke, a Companion Beast appeared on Feng Qiuyan’s body. It was a male Companion Beast with a human torso and a snake as its lower body. It was wearing a robe that resembled a shaman.

“Mythical Companion Beast... You went to the Wind God Cave?” Qin Ling asked in surprise when she saw Feng Qiuyan’s Companion Beast.

“Yes, there are some things that require sufficient strength to do. Therefore, I went to the Wind God Cave and contracted the Companion Beast inside before coming to pick you up,” Feng Qiuyan said.

Qin Ling was delighted. She naturally knew what the Wind God Cave was.

It was a dimensional zone that only people with the Feng family bloodline could enter. There was a special Companion Beast there. Although it wasn’t a Companion Egg, as long as a person had the Feng family’s bloodline flowing in them, it could be taken in as a Companion Beast like incubating a Companion Egg.

However, the Companion Beast needed too much Essence Energy. Many generations of the Feng family, including many powerful Epic experts, wanted to subdue it, but they ultimately failed. Although they didn’t die, their cultivation levels were crippled.

Feng Qiuyan had actually gone to the Wind God Cave for her, making Qin Ling’s previously disheartened heart feel like a withering tree ushering in spring.

The strange Companion Beast transformed into a gust of wind that attached itself to Feng Qiuyan’s body as though it had vanished.

However, Feng Qiuyan’s aura was rapidly rising.

Dragon Granny looked at Feng Qiuyan in surprise. Although she couldn’t recognize the origins of the Companion Beast, she could tell from Feng Qiuyan’s aura that it was no trifling matter.

“If you don’t want her to die, it’s best you stand there and do nothing,” said Dragon Granny as she raised the rattle drum in her hand.

Clearly, she wanted to use Miya to threaten Feng Qiuyan.

“If I were you, I wouldn’t move because as long as you shake that rattle drum, I will behead you,” Feng Qiuyan said calmly.

“Interesting. A mere human actually dares to threaten me because of a Companion Beast. I want to see how you will behead me...” As Dragon Granny spoke, she was about to shake the rattle drum in her hand.

However, just as her hand moved, Feng Qiuyan’s figure vanished like the wind. When he appeared again, he was already behind Dragon Granny.

Crack!

The rattle drum in the Dragon Granny’s hand snapped and half of it fell to the ground.

Dragon Granny was alarmed. She didn’t see how Feng Qiuyan moved. She wanted to turn her head to look, but despite her head moving, her body didn’t move.

The head landed on the ground before her body collapsed. One of the seven dragon monarchs, Dragon Granny, had died just like that.

Feng Qiuyan also spat out a mouthful of blood. The mysterious Companion Beast automatically separated from his body and transformed back into a tattoo.

The incantation patterns on Miya’s neck vanished as her body gradually recovered its strength. She looked at the corpse of Dragon Granny on the ground in disbelief.

“What Companion Beast is that? It doesn’t look like a dragon?” Miya asked Feng Qiuyan.

Feng Qiuyan shook his head and said, “I don’t know his name. I only know that his surname is Feng and that he only follows people from the Feng family. However, my strength is too weak. I can’t even withstand the shock produced when I use his strength.”

Suddenly, the waves churned and the water stirred. The Seven Seas Dragon King charged into the Sea God Reef dimensional zone in a frenzy as he had sensed Dragon Granny’s death.
