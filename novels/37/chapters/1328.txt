Chapter 1329: Invincible Dodge

Translator: CKtalon

This was also the first time Wang Chan had heard someone say that her Body of Bane was good. This was unprecedented. She widened her eyes as she looked at Lady Supreme Yin with an expression filled with anticipation and fear of disappointment.

“Lady Goddess, according to what you said, wouldn’t Wang Chan, who has the Body of Bane, be very powerful? Then can she use the Body of Bane to advance to the Calamity or Apocalypse level in the future?” Zhou Wen asked on Wang Chan’s behalf.

Unexpectedly, Lady Supreme Yin rolled her eyes at him and said, “Are you dreaming? I only said that the attribute of Bane is very precious, but I didn’t say that one would definitely be very strong if they had a Bane physique. Not to mention the Calamity-grade, you humans can’t even reach the Mythical…”

Halfway through her sentence, Lady Supreme Yin glanced at Zhou Wen and suddenly paused. Then, she continued, “Generally speaking, it’s unlikely for humans to advance to the Mythical stage unless they obtain external help.”

“Let’s put it this way. The attributes of Bane, Hope, Luck, and Lust are very precious and special. With these attributes, one will naturally be much stronger than ordinary people and have greater potential. However, how far one can go depends on one’s cultivation,” explained Lady Supreme Yin.

Wang Chan revealed a look of disappointment when she heard that.

Since it was difficult to advance to the Mythical stage like the average person, and the power of the Bane Body would become stronger and stronger, resulting in an increasing effect on the people around her, it was useless no matter how strong this attribute of hers was.

“Lady Goddess, although the Bane attribute is very strong, it has a very bad influence on the people around you. Is there any way to resolve this?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“It’s impossible to completely eliminate the effects. However, it’s not difficult to control them slightly and not cause too much trouble,” said Lady Supreme Yin confidently.

Zhou Wen and Wang Chan were overjoyed. Wang Chan knelt down and kowtowed to Lady Supreme Yin, but before she could do so, she was lifted up by an invisible force.

“Don’t kowtow me. I still want to live a few more years.” Lady Supreme Yin turned to Zhou Wen and said, “Take your golden apple and get lost as far as you can. Leave this young lady to me.”

“Wang Chan, are you willing to stay?” Zhou Wen first sought Wang Chan’s opinion. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“I want to stay.” Wang Chan was very opinionated.

Since Wang Chan was willing to stay, Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else. He stayed on the Moon for another day. Firstly, he wanted to see how Lady Supreme Yin planned on modifying Wang Chan. Secondly, he wanted to see if the Invincible Lucky Star was useful.

Entering the game again, Zhou Wen summoned all the Luck Companion Beasts, including the Invincible Lucky Star. He wore whatever he could wear and had whatever he couldn’t wear by his side to boost his courage.

Once again, he saw the Metal Guards and the Golden Battle Gods. Just like before, Zhou Wen didn’t move at all. His Heavenly Robe danced as he dodged all the bullets.

However, the real test had only just begun. When the Calamity-grade gunshot sounded, Zhou Wen’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest.

I dodged it…?Zhou Wen saw the Heavenly Robe move by itself. It yanked the blood-colored avatar’s body to the side, dodging the Calamity-grade bullet.

However, this did not prove anything. He had previously dodged the first two shots and was still killed in the end.

Shot after shot—all six consecutive shots missed. None of them hit the blood-colored avatar’s body.

The crucial seventh shot is finally here… Can I dodge it??Zhou Wen was extremely nervous.

Bang!

The gunshot sounded again. Zhou Wen had already used all his means, but he couldn’t see the trajectory of the seventh shot.

However, after the gunshot, Zhou Wen saw a white halo appear around the blood-colored avatar. It was as though the blood-colored avatar was wearing a large hula hoop. It floated around the blood-colored avatar’s chest, but it failed to injure it at all.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and was immediately alarmed. It wasn’t a halo at all, but the seventh bullet. It spun around the blood-colored avatar at the speed of light, but it couldn’t touch its body.

This is the power of the Heavenly Robe augmented by the Invincible Lucky Star??Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.

The seventh bullet refused to give up unless someone was killed. It kept flying at the speed of light, trying to approach the blood-colored avatar’s body.

However, every time the bullet tried to approach the blood-colored avatar, the Heavenly Robe would use its powers to yank Zhou Wen’s body to the side. Since the bullet couldn’t hit him, it could only chase after the blood-colored avatar. Therefore, it looked like a halo.

Bang! Bang!

The Calamity-grade gunshots sounded again, but they still failed to touch Zhou Wen. The bullets were dodged by the Heavenly Robe.

Zhou Wen didn’t leave as he stood there experimenting. He wanted to know how many times he could dodge the shots with the help of Invincible Lucky Star and other lucky equipment. He wanted to know how likely it was to achieve such an effect.

The outcome made Zhou Wen even happier. After a second round of the seventh bullet, the Calamity-grade bullets still failed to hit the blood-colored avatar protected by the Heavenly Robe. The second round’s seventh sure-kill bullet was also like the first round’s sure-kill bullet. It constantly circled the blood-colored avatar’s body, but it failed to injure the blood-colored avatar.

Zhou Wen experimented again and again, but the results left him pleasantly surprised. He dodged the set of six bullets in a row. Up to now, not a single one of them could injure the blood-colored avatar. Instead, the blood-colored avatar seemed to have six additional halos around it.

This left Zhou Wen somewhat depressed. The sure-kill bullets had been circling him, wanting his life. A single mistake could result in an irreversible outcome. This was a burdensome worry. No one knew if the bullets would penetrate the blood-colored avatar’s body the very next second.

With such a powerful dodging ability, it was not difficult to reach the Golden Palace. Even an ordinary person could complete the task.

Unfortunately, there was no such thing as a reward for reaching the Golden Palace in-game. It was useless even if Zhou Wen arrived there.

Seeing that he had nothing special to do with Wang Chan on the Moon and that there was no danger, Zhou Wen got up and returned to Earth.

Now, he was completely confident that he could lead Hui Haifeng’s men to enter the rankings, so there was no need to delay any longer.

After returning to Earth, Zhou Wen first sent Wang Lu a message, telling her not to worry about Wang Chan. He also explained the general situation.

Upon hearing that Wang Chan was fine and might even be able to stop the power of calamity, Wang Lu was also very happy. She even exhorted Zhou Wen to be careful. She was fine on her side and Zhou Wen didn’t need to worry.

Only then did Zhou Wen heave a sigh of relief, but he was thinking about something else.

I’m finally going to put an end to this!?Zhou Wen wasn’t very lucky for some reason.. After traveling for nearly 72 hours, he returned to Luoyang.
