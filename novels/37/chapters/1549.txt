Chapter 1550: Treasure Hunting in Regretless City

Translator: CKtalon

A treasure from the Garden of Eden??Zhou Wen frowned in thought.

Legend has it that Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden because they secretly ate the forbidden fruit. What could they have taken out of the Garden of Eden? The forbidden fruit??This was the only thing Zhou Wen could think of.

However, there were definitely many good things in the Garden of Eden. If they took something else along the way, it wouldn’t be something Zhou Wen could guess.

Regretless City looks very ordinary, but it has evilness lurking in it. There are two puppets in Adam and Eve’s tombs. It also said that there’s some treasure buried under the city that allows humans to have Life Providences and Life Souls. This place is really odd, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

The City Lord stole a glance at Zhou Wen and said cowardly, “There’s also a third guess. It’s said that this place is protected by your magical power, allowing us to have everything we have now. I believe that this is the truth. Everything we have is given to us by you, Your Devilish Excellency.”

“Alright, you may leave.” After Zhou Wen sent the City Lord away, he thought about what he had said.

The third possibility wasn’t high, and the first was even more ridiculous. Zhou Wen had also eaten the roots of the stone grass. They were the roots of ordinary plants. Even if they had any effects, they could at best be treated as herbs. It was impossible to use them to evolve humans to such significance.

The second possibility was most likely. However, Zhou Wen was very interested in what treasures lay beneath Regretless City. He wanted to know what kind of treasure could make humans have such a high starting point.

How can I find it??Zhou Wen planned on trying.

Truth Listener’s ability was very strong. It could even pass through a thick mountain and hear a cave’s interior. However, beneath Regretless City was just pure mountain. There were no caves.

Since the item isn’t in the mountain body, the most likely possibility is that it’s in Regretless City.?Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to constantly scan the area, not missing out on any detail, hoping to find some clues.

Buildings in Regretless City had rather interesting styles. There were all sorts of statues, carvings, and murals. Zhou Wen repeatedly scanned them, but he didn’t discover any power that could allow humans to evolve.

Could it be that the treasure in Regretless City is related to the two puppets??After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that the most mysterious thing in Regretless City was likely the two puppets.

If it was really because of the two puppets, Zhou Wen really didn’t dare dig them out. Grim Demon’s lesson was still fresh in his mind. Who knew what strange things would happen if he got the two puppets out?

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to give up just like that. Now that he was establishing a city in Guide City, if there was really such a treasure, it would bring unimaginable benefits if he buried it in his city.

Ignoring the improvements of newborns, just advertising the effects would bring Zhou Wen huge benefits.

Which parent didn’t want their descendants to gain an early advantage? Who didn’t want their children to be better than others? The stronger one was, the stronger their descendants would be.

When they learned that the children in Zhou Wen’s city were born at the Legendary or even Epic stage, how many people would rack their brains to come up with ways to enter his city to have babies?

Just this point alone was sufficient for Zhou Wen to gather a large number of human experts. Even if those human experts weren’t willing to join Zhou Wen’s city, he could take the opportunity to earn large amounts of benefits. He could even exchange for resources that couldn’t be obtained with money.

In short, with this treasure, it was impossible for Zhou Wen not to develop his city.

The crux of the matter was how to find this treasure. Also, he had to find a safe place to build a city and prevent easy entry.

I’ll do a search first. If there aren’t any treasures, it’s useless no matter how much I fantasize.

?Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and took out a tiny beast from the chaos space.

The little beast looked like a cross between a ferret and a rat, with a squirrel-like tail. It looked very strange.

The origins of this little beast were not simple. Previously, Tai Sui was bitten out of the metal walnut by this little beast. Furthermore, it could replicate a weapon like the Orchid Blade with identical material and effects. It was very magical.

Back when Zhou Wen obtained this little beast, he had kept it in the chaos space. His subsequent research on its origins came up to nothing.

However, Zhou Wen knew the beast’s abilities very well. It had a rare Earth Escape technique and was good at finding treasures.

Now, Zhou Wen had no choice but to try using it.

After all, he had raised it for so many years. This little beast’s feral nature had decreased dramatically. It was considered close to Zhou Wen, but it was a little too cunning. Zhou Wen wasn’t too confident in its loyalty. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The moment the little beast came out, it looked around furtively. Perhaps because it hadn’t come out for a long time, it felt a little uncomfortable and appeared a little reserved.

However, after it sized up its surroundings, it gradually revealed its true nature and peeked everywhere.

“There’s a treasure in this city. If you can find it, we’ll split the treasure equally. In addition, I’ll give you a Mythical Companion Egg as a reward.” Zhou Wen first promised the little beast benefits.

The little beast wasn’t his Companion Beast, nor was it as loyal as Chick. It was difficult to entice it without offering some benefits.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, the little beast stood up like a human and gestured at him with its two tiny paws.

Its actions were very simple. It extended its claws and flipped back and forth several times.

“You want twenty? Isn’t that a little too greedy? My final offer is two,” Zhou Wen said.

However, the little beast was very insistent. It waved its claws and gestured twenty again. It refused to give in at all.

“Three… Four… Five… Ten…” Zhou Wen kept raising the price, but the little beast was very willful. It didn’t lower its asking price at all. It kept at twenty.

“Fine, twenty it is. However, the thing you find has to be the one I want. You can’t randomly find something to fool me,” Zhou Wen said.

The little beast nodded and looked around for a while. It sniffed the air and ran off in a certain direction.

Zhou Wen hurriedly followed the little beast and watched it sniff around. It looked like a police hound.

After leaving the cemetery, the people on the streets immediately prostrated themselves at the ‘Devil King’ when they saw Zhou Wen. Wherever Zhou Wen went, people knelt on the ground, making him uncomfortable.

The little beast didn’t care much. It circled the city randomly.. After circling for a while, it actually headed for a cliff.
