Chapter 1280: Handwritten Copy

“Tell him to do something proper if he’s going to do anything. He shouldn’t be wasting his time on frivolities. If anything happens to the family, the one at home, Little Jing, or Ya’er because of this, I won’t let him off easily,” An Tianzuo said. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Young Master Wen, the various families have been keeping a close eye on our family recently. Furthermore, those spies are everywhere. They will stoop to nothing to obtain the secret of the accelerator. They might even attack you, Madam, Ya’er, and Miss Jing while we aren’t around to threaten us. Overseer is very worried about everyone’s safety. You have to be careful. It’s fine if the An Estate is damaged. If necessary, you can give up on the An Estate. As long as the people are fine,” An Sheng translated again.

An Tianzuo glared at An Sheng as though he was saying: “Did I say that much?”

“Please tell Overseer that since I’ve agreed, I’ll naturally ensure their safety. There’s no need for him to spend time worrying. It’s best you get him to put in more effort and think about how to obtain some Essence Crystal mines,” Zhou Wen said.

“Tell him that he doesn’t have to care about me…”

“Help me tell him that he doesn’t have to interfere in my matters…”

Li Xuan was dumbfounded by the side. He had seen quarrels before, but this was unprecedented.

“Um, can you speak for yourselves?” An Sheng’s head was about to explode from all the translation and he couldn’t help but ask.

“Humph.” An Tianzuo turned around and left without even sparing Zhou Wen a glance.

After An Tianzuo left, Li Xuan patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder and sighed, as though they were in the same boat. “Old Zhou, your days at the An family haven’t been good either.”

Back home, he was often criticized by Li Mobai, but he wasn’t as bold as Zhou Wen’s opposition to An Tianzuo.

“It’s nothing bad either. I just don’t treat him as a human,” Zhou Wen said without a change in expression as he held his teacup.

“Pfft!” Li Xuan spat out the mouthful of tea he had just drunk.

He was probably the only person in the Federation who dared dismiss An Tianzuo.

As An Tianzuo walked, he said, “He’s frivolous, arrogant, self-important, and ignorant. He thinks he’s impressive just because he has some meager achievements. If all of humanity is like him, how are we to fight the dimension…”

An Sheng didn’t dare say a word as he listened while staying by An Tianzuo’s side.

“Why aren’t you saying anything?” An Tianzuo spoke for a long time, but when he saw that An Sheng didn’t say a word, he stopped and turned to look at him.

“Overseer, you’re right,” An Sheng hurriedly said with his head lowered.

“That’s not what you’re thinking.” An Tianzuo snorted coldly.

“I…” An Sheng wanted to explain, but An Tianzuo interrupted him. “I don’t want to hear a patronizing explanation.”

“Well…”

“Don’t beat about the bush. Just tell me. Isn’t that fellow infuriating?” An Tianzuo interrupted him again.

I think Young Master Wen thinks the same way too.?An Sheng thought so, but he didn’t dare say it out loud. “That’s right. Young Master Wen has crossed the line. How can he only think about Madam and Ya’er? He has to consider the welfare of you and Miss Jing as well.”

An Tianzuo stopped again and glared at An Sheng as he said coldly, “Who said he has to consider our welfare? Do we need it?”

An Sheng could only lower his head and smile apologetically. “There’s definitely no need. I was just joking.”

“If you can’t control your tongue, I don’t mind helping you tame it. If you soak it in formalin, it should become obedient and not spout nonsense,” An Tianzuo said with a cold expression.

An Sheng hurriedly covered his face with his hand, as though indicating that he definitely wouldn’t spout nonsense. Please spare his tongue.

Only then did An Tianzuo continue walking in satisfaction. After leaving the Overseer’s residence, An Tianzuo came to the car. An Sheng pulled open the back door and covered the door frame with his hand.

However, An Tianzuo didn’t take a seat. Instead, he walked to the driver’s seat and pulled open the door. He didn’t immediately get in. He stopped and said to An Sheng, “Teacher got someone to return the information I sent him previously, right?”

An Sheng thought for a moment. There wasn’t any information sent recently, so he said, “The information I sent to Teacher was delivered more than a month ago. It was personally returned by Chancellor Leng. Have you forgotten?”

“Yes, Teacher has read the information, so it’s useless. Throw it away. I’ll leave it to you.” With that said, An Tianzuo got into the car and drove off.

Throw it away??An Sheng was slightly taken aback. The information wasn’t ordinary information, but stone monuments that were discovered in a mysterious dimensional zone.

Ignoring the content on them, even the stone monuments themselves were extremely precious items.

Although Leng Zongzheng had sent back a handwritten copy, that meant even more.

An Sheng remembered that Leng Zongzheng had said that the content recorded on it was useless to ordinary people, but was extremely precious for a spatial expert like him.

Back then, Leng Zongzheng had kept the original copy and had even specially made a copy before sending it over. The content was the same, but had Leng Zongzheng’s annotations. An Tianzuo had deliberately kept it in his private collection.

On second thought, An Sheng immediately understood something. He hurriedly turned around and returned to the An family. He was the only one who could enter the room where An Tianzuo stored his private collection.

…

After Li Xuan left, Zhou Wen continued studying Absolute Space. It was only a matter of time before he broke through to the Terror grade, but the more he studied, the more he felt that Absolute Space would hardly be able to play the role he imagined if it was only at the Terror grade.

“Young Master Wen, are you there?” An Sheng knocked on Zhou Wen’s door.

“Didn’t you leave? Why are you back?” Zhou Wen opened the door and asked An Sheng in puzzlement.

“Not yet. There’s some information here. It’s been copied and annotated by Chancellor Leng. Take a look and see if it’s useful.” An Sheng handed Zhou Wen four thick diaries.

Chancellor Leng’s annotated copy??Zhou Wen took the diary and casually flipped through a few pages. He was immediately mesmerized by the content.

“Where did this come from?” Zhou Wen asked as he flipped through it.

“Apparently someone obtained it from a mysterious dimensional zone. I’m not too sure about the details. If it’s useful, give it a read.” An Sheng opened his mouth as though he wanted to say something, but after some hesitation, he didn’t say anything. He bade farewell and left.

This is clearly the insight and experience written by a spatial expert. I’m afraid the person who wrote this might very well be a Calamity-grade expert. For Chancellor Leng to be able to explain so much with his annotations, his understanding of spatial powers is extremely profound…?Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised by the content.

Furthermore, he also knew why it had to be copied by hand and not stored using electronic equipment. The meaning contained in each stroke was something electronic equipment couldn’t present.

It wasn’t enough to just look at the content. One had to look at the concepts within the words.
