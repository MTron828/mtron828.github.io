Tsukuyomi isn’t dead! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised to see Tsukuyomi sitting cross-legged in the ice cavern.

Tsukuyomi hadn’t been able to move. Furthermore, she had been implicated in that earth-shaking battle. Zhou Wen originally imagined that she had most likely encountered misfortune.

He never expected to see Tsukuyomi again. Although her situation didn’t look good, she was still alive. It was fine as long as she was alive.

Tsukuyomi sat cross-legged in the ice cavern and circulated her Moonlight Force as though she was healing her injuries. There were no visible injuries on her body. She had probably been disturbed during her evolution and suffered internal injuries.

Why did the bee come to Tsukuyomi? Could it be that it wants to finish us all off? Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he couldn’t care less as he loudly warned Tsukuyomi.

However, Zhou Wen’s voice couldn’t enter the ice cavern because the bee had started playing its suona again. The suona’s sound immediately drowned out Zhou Wen’s voice.

Ignoring Tsukuyomi, who was far away in the ice cavern, even Xiao and Jiuyang, who were nearby, couldn’t hear what he was shouting.

The moment the suona sounded, the trio’s bodies were controlled again. No matter how they struggled, they couldn’t escape its control. Even the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and the Teacher Domain were useless.

Truth Listener’s Evil Warding didn’t have any effect. Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out what category the suona’s power came under. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but walk towards the bee, but he quickly realized that something was amiss.

He walked towards the bee under the music’s control, but Xiao and Jiuyang didn’t walk over. They remained standing where they were.

Zhou Wen could even see Xiao and Jiuyang trying their best to move their bodies, but they couldn’t move at all. They stood firmly in place as though they had been nailed there.

It’s over. Could it be as Jiuyang said? This bee wants to parasitize me? Zhou Wen felt a chill run down his back.

Countless thoughts ran through his mind. Just as he was thinking about how he could escape the bee’s control, he saw Tsukuyomi being forced out of the ice cavern. Tsukuyomi clearly saw Zhou Wen as well. She opened her mouth as though she was saying something to him, but due to the influence of the suona, Zhou Wen couldn’t hear what she was saying despite the close distance. She looked rather alarmed, a probable sign that she didn’t know what had happened.

Zhou Wen regretted not learning lip-reading. If he knew lip-reading, he would at least know what Tsukuyomi was saying, so he wouldn’t be gripped by such anxiety.

The two of them walked towards the bee. As the distance closed, Zhou Wen could roughly hear Tsukuyomi’s words.

“What happened here?” Tsukuyomi asked in panic.

“It’s a long story,” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile. Too many things had happened in between, making it impossible to give a quick summary.

“Ignore that for now. Let’s see if there’s any way to escape the suona’s control.” Zhou Wen could only hope that Tsukuyomi had a way to escape the suona’s music.

Tsukuyomi should have been at the Hell level before. After absorbing the power of the Moon Essence Basin, if nothing happened in the middle, she should be at the Heaven level. Now, he didn’t know what her situation was or if she had advanced perfectly. If she was already at the Heaven level, she might have a solution.

“I’ve already tried, but none of them worked. That sound is too strange. I can’t affect it with sound-type powers, nor can I affect it with spatial powers,” Tsukuyomi said with a shake of her head.

As the two of them spoke, they had already walked to a point less than fifty meters from each other. Furthermore, they were still approaching. In between them was the suona-playing bee.

“If even you are out of options, then we can only leave it up to fate. I hope that the bee doesn’t want our lives,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh.

Zhou Wen could only accept it if the bee really wanted to parasitize him. He only hoped that the bee wouldn’t suck him dry after parasitizing him. That way, he would have time to think of a solution.

If there was really no other way, Zhou Wen would make a trip to Chess Mountain. He would rather sign some unfair treaties with The Thearch than have his flesh sucked dry by the bee.

However, the bee’s actions left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.

If the bee really wanted to parasitize him, it could only parasitize one person. Then why did it bring Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi over?

Could it be that this fellow wants to choose a host like how an ancient emperor chooses concubines? Does he want to gather all the beautiful girls together and compare them? Zhou Wen thought for a long time but couldn’t figure out what the bee was up to.

The two of them were already in close proximity to the bee. The distance between Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi was only a step or two before the two of them finally stopped and stood facing each other. The bee’s music also stopped, but Zhou Wen realized that his body was still being controlled – he couldn’t move freely.

“What happened here?” Tsukuyomi asked Zhou Wen with a heavy expression.

“Sigh, I also want to know what happened,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh. Although he had watched the bee appear from the very beginning, he really didn’t know what it was up to.

Tsukuyomi was about to say something when she heard an earth-shattering suona blare.

The bee was just above the two of them. It was just too close to them. The suona sounded even clearer than before. It was as though it reached into their souls, causing their souls to tremble.

Thankfully, although the sound was a little terrifying, it didn’t seem to do anything substantial. Apart from being unable to move, nothing else happened.

Just as Zhou Wen was guessing what the bee meant, he suddenly felt that something was amiss. Something had automatically flown out of the Chaos Bead.

Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed. After all, the chaos space in the Chaos Bead was equivalent to another spacetime. Unless Zhou Wen opened the Chaos Bead himself, the things inside shouldn’t be affected by the outside world.

Now that something had flown out, it was clearly affected by the suona. This left Zhou Wen even more alarmed at its power.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that the thing that had flown out of the Chaos Bead was a token. It was the Heavenly Happiness Token that Emperor of Shang had given him.

The Heavenly Happiness Token was actually a palm-sized stone token. There was a red “joy” character on it. At that moment, the Heavenly Happiness Token floated between Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi. The originally ordinary stone token shimmered with a strange glow.
