Chapter 1300: Wings of Tomorrow

Translator: CKtalon

Since he couldn’t contact Wang Mingyuan, Zhou Wen had no solution. He felt that there was something fishy about this matter. If Jing Daoxian had really made a bet with Wang Mingyuan, there was no reason for Jing Daoxian to come looking for him, but he had heard nothing from Wang Mingyuan.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to put this matter aside. He planned on testing the Wings of Tomorrow skill and see what it was all about.

Zhou Wen knew very well that a Terror-grade skill wasn’t likely to be able to travel into the future. Ignoring tomorrow, even a minute into the future was unlikely.

He used Wings of Tomorrow and felt a force spew out from his back. Like a rocket’s thruster, it pushed his body up.

The altitude he could fly was very low, like a swallow’s low flight, but it was very fast.

Such a speed was extremely fast even at the Terror grade. It wasn’t slower than Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal.

Is that all??Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed. Although such speed was fast, it was no different from his Transcendent Flying Immortal.

Zhou Wen wanted to stop, but he was suddenly alarmed to discover that he couldn’t stop the Essence Energy circulation in his body. The Wings of Tomorrow seemed to lose control as it carried him forward like a cannonball.

What’s going on??Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly circulated his Essence Energy Art in a bid to stop his body’s flight.

A huge mountain appeared in his vision. At this speed, he would crash into it in less than a minute.

However, the more Zhou Wen circulated his Essence Energy, the faster he flew. It was as though his Essence Energy would automatically be absorbed by the Wings of the Tomorrow. Not only could he not stop it, but he also aided it.

Seeing that he couldn’t stop, Zhou Wen attempted to change his flight path. At the very least, he couldn’t let himself crash into the mountain.

The outcome was the same. After trying several methods, his body continued flying straight forward. He was getting closer and closer to the mountain, and the granite wall was right in front of him. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Gritting his teeth, Zhou Wen released the Seven Seas Dragon King and placed it in front of him, hoping to use its body to buffer the collision.

The Seven Seas Dragon King spewed out white mucus at Zhou Wen, hoping to stop him from continuing his flight. When the white mucus landed on Zhou Wen, his body rushed through it without it sticking to him.

Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and prepared to slam into the Seven Seas Dragon King, but his vision blurred as his body tunneled through its body and headed straight for the mountain wall.

“Stop!” Zhou Wen brandished his fist and struck the mountain in front of him.

However, he realized that all the Essence Energy in his body had been drained by the Wings of the Tomorrow. Without any Essence Energy to provide his other skills, his body continued on its collision course.

It’s over! Am I going to be the first human to kill himself with his own skill??Zhou Wen was so depressed that he nearly vomited blood.

However, his flying speed was too fast. Without giving him any time to think, he had already slammed into the mountain wall.

Zhou Wen subconsciously closed his eyes and gathered all his strength, preparing to withstand the pain of the collision, but the pain didn’t come.

Zhou Wen opened his eyes and realized that he was tunneling through the mountain. The strange scene was somewhat similar to the Earth Elemental Beast’s Earth Escape technique.

Zhou Wen couldn’t tell if the mountain had turned into an illusion or if his body had turned into an illusion. When the two overlapped, there was no collision. It was like the images projected by two projectors. They overlapped and changed, but they didn’t collide.

What’s going on? The power of the Wings of Tomorrow??Zhou Wen was alarmed.

His body kept flying forward, unable to stop. He charged through the mountain, the forest, and even a dam.

However, none of this could touch Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen’s body appeared to be an incorporeal ghost. He could pass through anything he touched.

Soon, Zhou Wen discovered something even more terrifying. As he couldn’t control his body, he naturally couldn’t choose a flight path and slammed straight into a dimensional zone.

This dimensional zone was deep in the mountains, and Zhou Wen had never been there before. It didn’t seem like anyone had come here. He saw groups of strange dimensional creatures.

They looked like cats, but their bodies were as large as tigers. They basked in the warm sun on the grass in groups, as though they couldn’t see Zhou Wen flying over their heads.

Soon, Zhou Wen flew through the dimensional zone. The dimensional zone didn’t restrict his body, so he didn’t need to take the main entrance.

Wings of Tomorrow is quite interesting. Could it be that I’m using tomorrow’s body to do something today, that’s why I’m not affected??Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss.

Even tomorrow’s body couldn’t pass through the mountain wall without a collision. The mountain wall had been there for hundreds of millions of years and it would continue to exist for a long time into the future. Be it yesterday or tomorrow, it was impossible for it to suddenly vanish. It was impossible for him to pass through it no matter when.

What’s going on with this skill? Could it be that I have to fly like this until tomorrow??The possibility only made him even more depressed.

He kept flying as his body passed through dimensional zones one after another. He flew for a long time in the dimensional zones. Due to his extreme speed, it didn’t take long for him to pass through ordinary zones. Therefore, Zhou Wen had the illusion that he was flying continuously in dimensional zones.

In those dimensional zones, Zhou Wen saw terrifying snakes that resembled dragons, behemoths that were as large as mountains, and strange treants.

Zhou Wen was quite knowledgeable. He had experienced many dimensional zones and seen many dimensional creatures, but the number of dimensional creatures he had seen today was more than in his previous years combined.

Thankfully, no matter what dimensional zone he entered, the Wings of Tomorrow would fly past it with Zhou Wen appearing like a ghost without attracting the attention of any creatures.

Although I don’t know what’s up with this skill, it seems interesting. If this move can’t even be discovered by a Calamity-grade creature, can I use it to get a ranking on Venus??Zhou Wen was already somewhat relaxed.

Since no one could discover him and he didn’t have to worry about hitting anything while he just kept flying, apart from physically moving, it didn’t seem to affect him.

Zhou Wen even had the urge to take out his phone and game while flying, but before he could really take it out, he suddenly heard a bang.

He felt as though his head was about to explode from the collision. His entire body bounced back as his head spun. His head buzzed as he nearly fainted on the spot.

When Zhou Wen finally regained clarity of mind, his vision was still blurry.. He tried his best to widen his eyes, hoping to figure out where he was.
