Chapter 780: Supreme Hell King

Translator: CKtalon

The sinflames in the Eye of the Holy Hell King bloomed like a lotus flower. Invisible sinflames surged out like layers of petals that enveloped Zhou Wen’s body.

Others could only see Zhou Wen levitating in mid-air and not the invisible sinflames on his body, but they could sense that his aura was constantly rising.

When his aura reached its peak, Zhou Wen’s body underwent a tremendous change. The Holy Hell King Life Soul completed its final evolution amidst the sinflames.

Instantly, Zhou Wen felt his entire body enter a higher dimension, separating himself from reality.

Reality became extremely filthy in his eyes, like a junkyard. And despite being in such an environment, his body remained untainted.

As the sinflames in the Eye of the Holy Hell King were consumed, the Eye of the Holy Hell King gradually closed and vanished.

“When Buddha closes his eyes, every inch of the world will be separated from purity. All life in the tainted world will be abandoned by Buddha and the final purification will descend.”

Looking at the filthy world, Zhou Wen seemed to gain some insight. Although the Eye of the Holy Hell King was closed, his eyes remained open. He did not completely separate himself from reality. Instead, he allowed himself to return to the world.

The condensation of a Life Soul not only had to do with talent, bloodline, and Essence Energy Art, but it also had to do with a person’s concepts and insights. No two people’s Life Souls were identical. That was because everyone’s thoughts were different. It was impossible to be completely the same.

If Zhou Wen had been bent on leaving this filthy world, the Holy Hell King Life Soul would have evolved in the direction of a saint, eventually becoming a Buddha or a god.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t have any thoughts of transcending. He stayed in the filthy world. Therefore, the Holy Hell King Life Soul evolved in another direction.

Li Mobai and company looked at Zhou Wen in the air. They originally felt that Zhou Wen’s body emitted a holy pressure as though he was the reincarnation of a Buddha.

However, in the blink of an eye, Zhou Wen’s entire body turned dim. It was as though a true immortal had been struck down to the mortal world, reducing to a mortal. They could no longer sense the otherworldly aura from him, as though he was an extremely ordinary youth.

Zhou Wen landed on the ground and stretched his back. He picked up the Essence Energy Skill Crystal that the Nether Butterfly had dropped and looked at Li Mobai and company. “There’s only one crystal. How do we split it?”

“I’m only here for the Guardian’s cocoon. I don’t want anything else,” Li Mobai said.

Gu Shanshui shook his head and said, “I only hope that you can help me catch the Corpse Bug after this matter is resolved. These things are useless to me.”

“In that case, I’ll take it.” Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he took the crystal.

Everyone set off again. The Flower River’s Flowers of Life had already withered. The originally beautiful Flower River had turned into a barren land. There were no creatures left, allowing them to advance much faster.

While on the way, Zhou Wen took out his phone to take a look. Indeed, he discovered that the Holy Hell King Life Soul had evolved again, becoming a Perfect Body.

However, to Zhou Wen’s disappointment, the Constitution that corresponded to the Holy Hell King Life Soul remained at 40 points. It didn’t increase to 41 points.

This was the same as the advancement of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. The Essence Energy attribute it corresponded to didn’t increase to 41 points and remained at 40.

My Life Soul has advanced to a Perfect Body, but my stats haven’t reached 41. How can I advance my stats? Zhou Wen was somewhat vexed.

He had been looking forward to it for so long. His Life Soul had advanced to a Perfect Body, but his stats hadn’t increased. This meant that his chances of advancing to the Mythical stage were still very slim.

However, on second thought, Xia Jiuhuang had used the power of nine Life Providences and Life Souls, as well as absorbing the life essence of more than ten thousand Epic experts. With the help of the lightning, he advanced to the Mythical stage as a human. It didn’t seem reasonable for him to advance to the Mythical stage with just four Perfect Life Souls.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred. Xia Jiuhang used nine Life Providences and Life Souls to advance to the Mythical stage. Doesn’t that mean that Life Souls and Life Providences are helpful in advancing to the Mythical stage? I didn’t take the wrong path. Is it simply because a single Life Soul isn’t enough to break through the limitations of the attributes?

Zhou Wen thought of his Dao Sutra and the First Order of Chaos. They were very similar and had strengthened his Essence Energy.

If I were to advance the Chaos Egg Life Soul, which also augments Essence Energy, to a Perfect Body, would the two Life Souls augment my Essence Energy stat to 41 points? With this in mind, Zhou Wen felt a glimmer of hope. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

His mood improved significantly as he carefully looked at his newly advanced Perfect Body Life Soul.

Supreme Hell King (Perfect Body): The supreme existence in hell, the final faith of the source of sin.

Zhou Wen could sense the stark differences between the Supreme Hell King and Holy Hell King. He no longer had the Eye of the Holy Hell King and he didn’t have the lofty authority like the Holy Hell King.

Now, the Supreme Hell King Life Soul made Zhou Wen feel like he truly belonged to hell. He could enter it with his body, not only establish a connection using the Eye of the Holy Hell King.

However, Zhou Wen hadn’t tried it to see what would happen if he really used the Supreme Hell King Life Soul to enter Hell.

Zhou Wen planned on finding an opportunity to give it a try in-game. It was best not to give it a try in reality.

Even if he didn’t enter Hell, the Supreme Hell King’s augmentation of his senses wasn’t something that the Holy Hell King could match. When the Supreme Hell King Life Soul augmented him, Zhou Wen’s senses became terrifyingly powerful.

However, there was something wrong with this. Under such sharp senses, no matter what he looked at, he found everything filthy. It was as though he was in a garbage dump. It was unbearable.

If it wasn’t necessary, Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to activate the Supreme Hell King Life Soul.

Before long, the group passed through the Flower River and arrived near the legendary Valley of No Return. The Guardian cocoon that Li Mobai mentioned wasn’t in the Valley of No Return, but they had to pass through it.

In order to master the Evil King Gu Life Soul, Li Mobai had accidentally fallen into a stone cave in the Valley of No Return while he was chasing after a Gu King. He passed through the stone cave and arrived at an underground cave behind the Valley of No Return. That was where he discovered the Guardian cocoon.

Now, Li Mobai led Zhou Wen and company through the underground tunnel again. They circled around the Valley of No Return, which everyone in the South District would turn pale at the mention of, and arrived at an underground cave.

They saw the Guardian cocoon. It was gray in color and emitted an evil aura. It was different from any Guardian Zhou Wen had seen before.

“We can’t go any further. There’s a terrifying Mythical creature guarding it.” Li Mobai pointed to the side of the gray cocoon.

Zhou Wen and company looked over and saw a calabash vine growing there.
