Chapter 1705 Universe Inversion

The hidden dungeon in the Endless Sea of Stars was on a small planet. After Zhou Wen was sucked into the tiny planet, he realized that there was a dimensional creature he had never seen in the Endless Sea of Stars.

It was a little similar to Planet Devourer. It looked very similar to a jellyfish. It had a transparent hemispherical body with countless tentacles below-way more than jellyfish.

However, this dimensional creature was only the size of a basketball. It wasn’t as huge as the Planet Devourer.

Inside the hidden dungeon, there was a terrifying suction force everywhere. It was much more terrifying than the suction force outside the tiny planet. Zhou Wen couldn’t move inside the hidden dungeon.

The jellyfish-like dimensional creature instantly appeared above the red avatar’s head. Countless tentacles wrapped around its head, making Zhou Wen feel as though his body was being sucked dry. He immediately summoned the Chaos Egg to protect himself before blocking the jellyfish’s attack.

The jellyfish constantly attacked the Chaos Egg. Although Zhou Wen couldn’t move, he realized something.

The jellyfish couldn’t move in the hidden dungeon either. All its actions were done through spatial teleportation, which meant that it was constantly instant transmitting.

Although Zhou Wen could continuously instant transmit, his body was constantly in a state of instant transmission like the jellyfish. As there was almost no gap between instant transmissions, it didn’t seem like he was instant transmitting.

It sounded difficult to understand. In fact, because the instant transmission interval was too short, the jellyfish Zhou Wen saw was actually just an afterimage. The real jellyfish had already undergone the next instant transmission by the time Zhou Wen saw it.

What amazing spatial ability. It’s only because dimensional creatures have special physiques that they can reach this stage. It’s impossible for a human’s body to withstand such continuous instant transmission. Zhou Wen attempted instant transmissions in the hidden dungeon. Indeed, as he had expected, he could use spatial powers to move in the hidden dungeon without being restricted.

The jellyfish’s spatial powers were very strong, but from Zhou Wen’s observations, it was likely only at the Human Realm. As its spatial powers were so powerful, it probably wouldn’t be easy for others to kill it. Even if someone at the Hell level came, they might not be able to gain the upper hand.

It wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to kill the jellyfish. The Teacher Domain could restrain the suction force of the hidden dungeon, and he was proficient in spatial powers. Killing the jellyfish was too easy.

Zhou Wen didn’t do so because he wanted to learn the technique of constant instant transmissions from the jellyfish. He wanted to see if he could achieve such instant transmission with his human body.

If he could really do that, it would be very difficult for ordinary Calamity-grade creatures to injure him.

Zhou Wen originally only fought the jellyfish with the intention of practicing, but to his surprise, something strange happened when the jellyfish instant transmitted onto the Chaos Egg

The Human Realm jellyfish didn’t have the ability to break through the Chaos Egg’s defense. It was the same this time. The jellyfish failed to damage the Chaos Egg at all.

Strangely, the Companion Beast armor Zhou Wen was wearing suddenly vanished. And in the jellyfish’s transparent hemispherical body, a mini armor Companion Beast appeared before quickly disappearing.

Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that his armor Companion Beast had been declared dead by the game system.

Isn’t this Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun’s Star Stealer? This fellow actually knows it? Zhou Wen was first alarmed before he was delighted

He had always wanted to learn the Star Stealer skill, but no matter how many times he grinded in the endless cosmos, he failed to obtain the Star Stealer skill crystal. Now that this jellyfish actually had such a skill, he might be able to come up with a solution.

Furthermore, the jellyfish’s ability was clearly stronger than Liu Yun’s Star Stealer. Liu Yun probably couldn’t snatch a Companion Beast through the Chaos Egg either.

Having had no intention of immediately killing the jellyfish to begin with, the new idea Zhou Wen came up with made him even more unwilling to kill it.

Zhou Wen attempted to analyze the jellyfish’s ability and soon realized that it was impossible for him to learn it.

This was because it wasn’t an ordinary Essence Energy Skill, but the jellyfish’s innate ability. Unless Zhou Wen transformed into a jellyfish, it was impossible for him to master

it.

Despite his great disappointment, Zhou Wen still used the jellyfish to practice for a period of time. When he was almost done with his spatial instant transmission technique, he was still inferior to the jellyfish. He could only slowly hone whatever was lacking in the future. He killed the jellyfish when fighting it no longer brought about any benefits.

A Zone Core dropped from the jellyfish’s body. It was this Zone Core that advanced the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art to the Calamity grade.

What surprised Zhou Wen even more was that the Zone Core was born from the jellyfish, so it contained the jellyfish’s talent ability. After the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art condensed a Calamity Zone, it had an ability similar to Star Stealer.

Of course, it was just an additional ability. The Calamity Zone’s ability wasn’t just that.

Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art: Universe Inversion (Human Realm)

Previously, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art was best at long-distance teleportation. The Godfiend Era was the king of instant transmission at close range, but after advancing to the Calamity grade, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art’s instant transmission ability had been greatly enhanced. It could almost be said to have reached Minute Subtlety.

In the past, Zhou Wen’s long-distance teleportation had been very inaccurate, but now, he could carry it out with precision at the millimeters level. It was much more accurate than satellite positioning.

Of course, this wasn’t the main ability of Universe Inversion. This was only the strengthening of the Calamity Zone’s Terror transformation. In fact, Zhou Wen still wasn’t too sure about the true ability of Universe Inversion.

As Zhou Wen was studying Universe Inversion, Karoman came knocking on his door. Zhou Wen hadn’t finished studying it.

From the results of the research, Universe Inversion could change some cosmic rules.

For example, gravity had a downward effect, and Universe Inversion could completely reverse the effects of gravity. When that happened, things on the ground would fly up by themselves. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It sounded unbelievable, but it wasn’t without reason. Zhou Wen understood it this way. It was like the two extremes of a magnet-like poles repel while unlike poles attract. Universe Inversion changed the unlike poles that were originally stuck together into like poles, so they naturally repelled each other.

This was only Zhou Wen’s current understanding. As his research on Universe Inversion wasn’t deep enough, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if his understanding was wrong. He didn’t dare come to a conclusion.

It’s time to test the Universe Inversion’s ability to steal Companion Beasts. Zhou Wen looked at the Anasrava Gold Turtle armor and secretly circulated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art.

According to Zhou Wen’s previous experiments, he had to come into contact with the other party’s Companion Beast to ‘steal’ it.
