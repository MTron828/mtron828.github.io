Chapter 1343: Fighting Over Chocolate

“I want to eat this… This… And this…” They passed by a city which was already very far from the capital. Zhou Wen got everyone to take a break and took Ya’er to buy some snacks.

As he had been occupied with numerous matters recently, he hadn’t had much time to accompany Ya’er. He originally thought that his trip to the capital would be relatively easy and that he could take Ya’er on a vacation. Who knew that something like this would happen again?

After Zhou Wen and company exited Earth Escape, Sweetie wanted to attack Zhou Wen, but Ya’er got him to buy her all sorts of snacks.

As Sweetie watched Ya’er eat cotton candy one moment and ice cream the next, she couldn’t help but be stunned.

That… looks delicious…?Sweetie couldn’t help but swallow her saliva when she saw Ya’er constantly trying all kinds of delicacies. It seemed like every one of them was delicious.

Zhou Wen followed behind Ya’er, carrying bags of snacks for her.

From the looks of it, no matter how bad a person is, there are times when they are still alright.?Sweetie saw that no matter what Ya’er wanted, Zhou Wen wouldn’t hesitate to buy it for her. She thought to herself,?If he dies now, how sad would that young lady be? It’s better to wait for him to finish shopping before ending his sinful life.

“I want that…” Ya’er came to a chocolate shop and pointed at a box of chocolates.

Zhou Wen traced Ya’er’s finger and realized that the box of chocolates was placed in a very obvious spot. Furthermore, there was a special booth. With the lighting, the exquisite chocolate box looked even more eye-catching. It was no wonder Ya’er had taken a fancy to it.

“Please help me get that box of chocolates.” Zhou Wen saw that there was no price tag on the chocolate box and it was obvious that it was very expensive, but that wasn’t important. Money didn’t mean much to Zhou Wen anymore.

“Sir, I’m really sorry. I can’t sell you that box of chocolates for the time being,” the shop assistant said politely.

“Why?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement when he heard the store assistant’s words.

The shop assistant explained, “Sir, that box of chocolates was personally made by our boss. It’s also his proudest work. You can call it the centerpiece of our shop. Only one box is made a month. Because it’s so delicious and very popular, many people want to buy it. However, we can only make one box of such chocolates a month. Many people get their friends to get us to sell the chocolates to them. With so many people begging for it, our boss had no choice. He just can’t produce that many. Therefore, our boss made a rule. That box of chocolates can only be sold to the person who knows the most about chocolate.”

“What do you mean by knowing the most about chocolate?” Zhou Wen really didn’t understand how one was to determine if someone knew chocolate or not.

When the shop assistant heard Zhou Wen’s words, he knew that he didn’t know anything about chocolate. However, he still said politely, “It’s actually very simple. Every time the chocolate is produced, the boss will set three questions. Those who can answer the three questions correctly are qualified to obtain that box of chocolate for free.

“That’s a pretty good deal. What are the three questions?” Zhou Wen thought to himself,?With my ability, I can easily see through things. It shouldn’t be difficult to clear it. I’ll even get that box of chocolates for free.

The shop assistant pointed to the three boxes next to him and said, “There are three different kinds of chocolates in the three boxes. As long as you can determine the specific ingredients of the three chocolates, you can get our store’s centerpiece chocolate.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Zhou Wen was taken aback as he was immediately put in a spot.

If he had to guess the brand and type of chocolate in the box, he would be able to guess it even if it was locked in a safe.

However, Zhou Wen had no way of guessing the ingredients in the chocolate. He could see what was inside, but he couldn’t put a name to them.

“Let me try.” Ya’er was very interested in chocolate. She walked over and wanted to reach out for it.

“Wait a minute.” The shop assistant quickly said, “You have to blindfold yourself when eating the chocolate. Moreover, each of these three chocolates is worth three to four hundred bucks. If you eat one, it will be 350. If you eat all three, it works out cheaper—a thousand bucks…”

“Didn’t you say that it’s free if we can tell the ingredients?” Zhou Wen asked.

“The store’s centerpiece will be free, but the chocolate used for the test isn’t. Regardless of whether you can tell the ingredients, you have to pay. If you aren’t agreeable to it, you don’t have to make the attempt,” the shop assistant said.

Zhou Wen cursed inwardly at the profiteer. Although they claimed that the centerpiece would be given for free, they were actually taking the opportunity to sell ordinary chocolate.

However, it was peanuts to Zhou Wen, so he didn’t care. Just as he was about to pay for Ya’er’s attempt, he suddenly heard a sweet voice behind him say, “I want to give it a try.”

Zhou Wen found the voice familiar and was alarmed. He turned his head and saw that it was indeed the blonde girl he had met previously.

Previously, the blonde girl had wanted to scam him. Her presence here evoked many thoughts in Zhou Wen.

This place is more than 500 kilometers from the capital. It’s definitely not a coincidence to meet her here. What does she want??Zhou Wen stared at the blonde girl, but he couldn’t see through her. No matter how he looked at her, she looked like an ordinary person who had never cultivated.

Sweetie came prepared. She already knew what money was. She took out a thousand-dollar bill and handed it to the shop assistant.

“Wait a minute. There should be a first-come, first-served rule, right? We came first. If there’s an attempt, we should go first,” Ya’er said.

“You guys only came to the shop first, but you didn’t pay. I paid first, so I naturally get to go first.” Sweetie’s logic was very clear.

In fact, after following Zhou Wen and Ya’er for so long, her appetite was whet. She had swallowed countless mouthfuls of saliva, and when she heard how delicious that box of chocolates was, she couldn’t help but appear, wanting to eat it.

“That’s not right. You’re still serving us. You shouldn’t be taking her money now, right?” Ya’er asked the shop assistant.

The shop assistant was in a dilemma. He felt that what both Sweetie and Ya’er said made sense. They seemed to be right, and he couldn’t find a reason to refute them.

Seeing that neither Sweetie nor Ya’er was willing to budge, the shop assistant coughed and said, “In the past few years, many people have made the attempt every month. However, the chances of them taking our store’s centerpiece is less than one in a hundred. It’s very difficult. Why don’t you try one by one…”

As he spoke, he glanced at Ya’er. Seeing that Ya’er had no intention of backing down, he looked at Sweetie. Sweetie stood there without moving, her eyes equally determined.

The shop assistant could only throw a pleading look at Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen ignored him. All his attention was on Sweetie.?I clearly remember that this girl is an existence that can pass through Calamity-grade bullets.

“Since both of you want the centerpiece, let’s have a chocolate competition. Whoever wins will get my centerpiece. Of course, it’s also possible that neither of you will succeed and you’ll end up eliminated. It’s not that easy to get my centerpiece,” someone said as he walked out of a different room.
