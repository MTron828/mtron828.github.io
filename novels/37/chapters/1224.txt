Chapter 1225: Here Comes the Opportunity

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen felt his scalp tingle when he saw the word “deal.” A deal with The Thearch definitely didn’t end well. John was a perfect example that remained fresh in his mind.

“Ahem, The Thearch, I recently saw quite a number of powerful fellows among humans. The Great Skyfiend and Hermit in the League of Guardians are especially strong...” Zhou Wen wanted to change the topic.

“Why don’t you say that there’s Blood Shaman and Cave Era?” The Thearch replied.

“Those two are also super strong. I didn’t have the time to tell you.” Zhou Wen hurriedly replied.

“Why don’t I help you destroy the League of Guardians? What say you?” The Thearch replied mockingly.

“Uh! The League of Guardians has nothing to do with me. Whether it’s destroyed or not is up to you.” Zhou Wen was no longer the kid from before. He didn’t blush even when his thoughts were seen through.

The Thearch clearly wasn’t in the mood to talk to him about this. She directly sent a message and asked: “You didn’t contract a Guardian or fuse with other creatures, so how did you advance to the Mythical stage?”

“I just cultivated an Essence Energy Art, and as time went by, I advanced,” Zhou Wen answered.

The Thearch naturally didn’t believe him. In fact, it was impossible.

“If you don’t wish to say, I can just let it pass. However, if you continue talking to me like this, do you believe that I’ll let your fifth limb grow on your head?” The Thearch replied.

Zhou Wen really wanted to see if his present ability could withstand The Thearch’s wish powers. However, considering the immense risk of his fifth limb growing on his head, he decided to see what The Thearch wanted of him.

“What deal do you want to make with me?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I won’t ask how you advanced. But tell me, did you advance to the Mythical stage purely as a human?” The Thearch asked again.

“Yes.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and answered truthfully.

“That’s enough. Help me get something. After it’s done, I’ll tell you a secret,” The Thearch said.

“Can you be more detailed? What do I need to get? What’s the secret you want to tell me?” Zhou Wen was working on a way to reject The Thearch.

“Your hometown is in Guide City, right? There’s a Fire God Platform in Guide Ancient City. There’s a stone saber on it. Pull it out and give it to me,” The Thearch sent a message.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. The Thearch actually wants that stone saber. What does she want? Could it be that the stone saber can help her escape?

As Zhou Wen thought about it, he said, “I’ve heard of that stone saber, but I’ve heard that no one can pull it out...”

“As long as you are a pure human who advanced to the Mythical stage, you will definitely be able to pull it out.” The Thearch seemed very confident and ignored Zhou Wen’s excuse.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, The Thearch sent another message. “You should have seen the situation in the Venusian dimensional zone. However, you might not know what that dimensional zone implies.”

“You know about the Venusian dimensional zone?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

“If you can help me retrieve the stone saber, I can tell you how to obtain the item inside through the Venusian dimensional zone.” The Thearch threw out the bait.

“What’s inside the Venusian dimensional zone?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“Help me retrieve the stone saber and you will know everything.” The Thearch immediately sent another message. “There’s no rush. You can think about it. However, if the fellows from the dimension obtain the thing from the Venusian dimensional zone, I’m afraid the Earth Federation will really become a breeding ground for the dimension.”

“Let me consider it.” Since The Thearch didn’t elaborate, Zhou Wen knew that it was useless to ask further.

If it were in the past, Zhou Wen would definitely have rejected it without any hesitation. However, the bait The Thearch threw out was too much; it left Zhou Wen somewhat tempted.

Zhou Wen had already learned from Gu Dian that the dimension placed great importance on the item in Venus. If he really couldn’t clear the Venusian instance dungeon before the dimension did, he might really have to rely on The Thearch’s strength.

However, Zhou Wen couldn’t confirm if The Thearch was telling the truth, so he naturally wouldn’t easily believe her.

“There’s no rush. I can divulge some information first. There are six Terror-grade Golden Battle Gods in Venus who can fire bullets of different attributes. After them, there will be a Calamity-grade metal creature. Help me get the stone saber. I have a way that will allow you to kill that Calamity-grade metal creature.”

“What’s the name of that Calamity-grade metal creature?” Zhou Wen knew that The Thearch wasn’t spouting nonsense. He had already verified the existence of the subsequent Calamity-grade creature.

“Bring the stone saber to Chess Mountain when you’ve thought it through.” The Thearch didn’t answer him. She didn’t send any more messages after that. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhou Wen frowned in thought. From the looks of it, The Thearch really knows something about the Venusian instance dungeon, but she doesn’t want the item in the Venusian instance dungeon. Instead, she wants the stone saber. Could it be that the stone saber is more precious than the item in the Venusian instance dungeon? Or can the stone saber help her escape?

After some thought, Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out what The Thearch was up to.

The stone saber in Guide Ancient City couldn’t be pulled out. Otherwise, not only would Guide Ancient City undergo a breakout, but a large number of high-level dimensional creatures would appear. Zhou Wen didn’t know what would ensue if he completely pulled out the stone saber.

Zhou Wen had previously investigated its origins.

The Fire God Platform was also known as the Yanbo Platform. It was the first place in the East District used for astronomy, and Yanbo was the Fire God, also the founder of the Shang Dynasty. Speaking of which, it was somewhat related to Chess Mountain.

However, when it came to a Fire God, the first thing most people in the East District thought of was Zhurong, not Yanbo.

Although Zhou Wen was born and raised in Guide City, the Fire God he recognized wasn’t Yanbo Consort, but Suirenshi, who introduced fire to humans. He was the leader of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.

Could the Ancient Sovereign Sutra engraved on Fire God Platform be related to Suirenshi? If the stone saber is related to Suirenshi, it’s easier to understand. The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more convinced he was of its likelihood.

With The Thearch’s request, Zhou Wen had the urge to return to Guide Ancient City to take a look.

However, Zhou Wen still didn’t head to Guide Ancient City to prevent himself from being exploited by The Thearch.

He stayed at home and continued grinding dungeons. He grinded the Venusian instance dungeon once a day, but it was too slow. He couldn’t farm Companion Eggs on a large scale. Instead, he obtained a few Terror-grade dimensional crystals which he fed to Banana Fairy. Her stats had increased significantly, averaging above 90 points.

Unfortunately, he could only farm it once a day. Most of the time, Zhou Wen could only farm ordinary dungeons.

Suddenly, the phone’s live broadcast stirred. Another creature arrived in front of the Venusian dimensional zone. It was the black dragon that had appeared previously.

Here’s my chance. Zhou Wen’s spirits were lifted. Farming the Venusian instance dungeon once a day was just too slow.. Now was the best time to pick up freebies.
