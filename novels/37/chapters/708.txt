Chapter 709: Dimensional Axis

The fruit that emitted a divine glow felt similar to a peach when held in his hand.

“Teacher, have you realized your dream?” Zhou Wen put away the fruit and asked Wang Mingyuan.

“If it’s so easy to realize it, it wouldn’t be called a dream.” Wang Mingyuan pondered for a moment and pointed into the distance. “Look over there.”

Zhou Wen looked in the direction Wang Mingyuan had pointed and saw a huge building in the void. It was extremely strange, like a pillar that emitted a divine glow. It was unimaginably huge.

“What’s that?” Zhou Wen asked.

“The Dimensional Axis. Its existence connects Earth to dimensional zones,” Wang Mingyuan said.

Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up. “If we can sever the connection to the Dimensional Axis, will we be able to stop the invasion of dimensional creatures?”

“In theory, it’s indeed feasible. However, there’s more than one Dimensional Axis. It connects different dimensional spaces. Every Dimensional Axis is the core of a dimensional space. Almost all the most terrifying dimensional creatures will gather here, making it very difficult to reach it. Besides, a Dimensional Axis can connect to dimensional zones. It’s not that easy to destroy it,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“Teacher, you have already thought of a solution, right?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I’ve indeed thought of a way to sever the Dimensional Axis, but I don’t plan on severing it,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“Why?” Zhou Wen was stunned.

“I thought of a solution, but it takes too long to implement it. I’m afraid Earth would already be occupied by dimensional creatures before I can ever sever a Dimensional Axis. Therefore, I don’t plan on severing it,” Wang Mingyuan said as he narrowed his eyes at the Dimensional Axis.

“Why?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

No matter how difficult it was, there was still a chance as long as it was done. As for Wang Mingyuan, didn’t he enter the dimensional zone to stop the dimensional invasion? Why was he giving up now?

“In ancient times, floods were a perennial threat. Humans wanted to control floods. In the beginning, they tried building tall levees to block the flood. Do you know the outcome?” Wang Mingyuan asked.

Zhou Wen had heard of this myth before. The people who tried to stop the floods naturally failed. The higher the levee was, the stronger the flood. Once it breached the levee, it would cause a destructive force that was ten times or a hundred times greater.

Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up as he looked at Wang Mingyuan and said, “Teacher, do you mean to think of a way to guide dimensional creatures to other dimensional zones instead of rushing to Earth?”

Wang Mingyuan looked at the Dimensional Axis calmly and said indifferently, “No, what I mean is that I want to control the flood. I want the flood to obey my orders. They will go wherever I tell them to go. They will do whatever I tell them to do. I will dominate everything.”

“Dominate the dimensional zones”? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. If it was really as Wang Mingyuan had said, he would one day be able to ascend to the top of the myriad races and become an existence that controlled the dimensional zones. How delightful would that be?

However, this path was just too difficult. Even with Wang Mingyuan’s shocking talent, it was difficult for him to reach that stage.

“Little Wen.” Wang Mingyuan’s gaze landed on Zhou Wen’s face as he said with a strange tone, “Don’t take my path. There’s only death at the end of this path.”

Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly asked, “Is there a problem with Spirit Casting?”

He was somewhat worried. With Zhong Ziya’s personality, there was a high chance that he would take this path. If there was really a problem with the Spirit Casting Art, Zhong Ziya would be in danger.

“There’s no problem with Spirit Casting, but this path isn’t for humans.” Wang Mingyuan sighed and waved his hand. A force swept towards Zhou Wen as he said, “Don’t come again next time. You shouldn’t be in a place like this.”

Zhou Wen was about to say something when his body was sent into the void by an invisible force. The light in front of him changed and by the time his body returned to normal, he had already fallen onto the town’s cube.

He stood up and looked up into the sky, but the pillar of light was gone. He found it indescribable.

Wang Mingyuan’s last sentence had hinted at something. If he wasn’t Wang Mingyuan’s student, he might not have plucked the divine fruit so easily.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen still didn’t know what the person who obtained the divine fruit in his place would do or what they needed to do.

...

After Zhou Wen left, Wang Mingyuan sat on the tree’s root and closed his eyes as though he was deep in thought.

In the void above the pure land, lightning and thunder suddenly flared. It was as though the end of the world had arrived. A terrifying divine voice sounded from the void.

“Wang Mingyuan, you actually dared to violate the agreement. You should know the consequences.”

Wang Mingyuan’s eyes remained closed as he said indifferently, “Since I’ve done it, I’ll naturally bear all the consequences.”

“Very good. Then prepare to suffer divine punishment.” A terrifying lightning bolt descended along with the divine voice.

Bolts of lightning descended from the void and stabbed into Wang Mingyuan’s body like sharp swords. Thrust after thrust, they filled his entire body with lightning.

However, Wang Mingyuan sat there without any change in expression. It was as though the lightning bolts that stabbed into his body didn’t exist at all. However, blood-red spots appeared on his white clothes like blooming peach blossoms.

“The divine punishment will continue until the next divine fruit ripens. I hope you will still be alive when that happens.” The voice in the void faded and the lightning in the sky vanished.

The paradise returned to its original silence. Only the lightning on Wang Mingyuan’s body sparked like countless lightning needles as they trembled.

...

Zhou Wen returned to school and took out the divine fruit, but he was somewhat hesitant.

There was only one divine fruit, and its use was to raise a Companion Beast to the Mythical stage. He naturally didn’t need to consider the Companion Beasts that had already advanced to the Mythical stage.

Among the Companion Beasts that had yet to advance to the Mythical stage, Demonic Neonate had the greatest potential.

However, Demonic Neonate had the ability to evolve. It was only a matter of time before she advanced to the Mythical stage. And the greatest use of the divine fruit was to allow any Companion Egg to advance to the Mythical stage.

From this point of view, it was best to choose a low-level Companion Beast with immense potential to advance to the Mythical stage.

Zhou Wen really had a few Companion Beasts with such potential. For example, Doctor Darkness, Golden Harp, Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, and so on. All of them had immense potential.

Of course, Zhou Wen wouldn’t dare raise the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General again. He eliminated it.

Zhou Wen’s idea was to choose between Doctor Darkness and Golden Harp. However, this was also risky. This was because he didn’t know if the Wheel of Destiny they condensed after advancing to the Mythical stage would be of any use. If it condensed a useless Wheel of Destiny, he might as well directly advance Demonic Neonate to the Mythical stage. Her being at the Mythical stage was definitely going to be extraordinary, allowing her to immediately possess powerful combat strength. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant as he was momentarily at a loss.
