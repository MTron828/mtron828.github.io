“Ah! Why am I here?” Lucas looked at Zhou Wen and Philo in puzzlement.

“Zhou Wen saved you. Hurry up and thank him.” Philo was delighted. She was originally a little angry at Zhou Wen for forcefully imprisoning her.

However, she never expected Lucas to be in front of her after Zhou Wen released her. Although he looked a little groggy, he didn’t seem to have any problems. She couldn’t help but feel grateful and ashamed. She never expected Zhou Wen to take the risk to enter the Time Hut and rescue Lucas. She had previously suspected that Zhou Wen didn’t dare enter to save Lucas because he was afraid of death.

“Zhou Wen, how did you get me out of the Present Hut? I thought I was doomed,” Lucas said with lingering fear.

.

Although Zhou Wen wanted to ask what he had experienced in the Present Hut, it wasn’t the time for a chit chat.

“Now, the terrifying existence in the hut is pursuing us. Everyone, split up and escape. We’ll talk later,” Zhou Wen said as he instant transmitted away.

He wasn’t sure when the woman would catch up. He had already scattered the people and corpses in different places.

Now that he was separated from Lucas, even if the woman really caught up, she wouldn’t be in the mood to capture Lucas.

“The mighty Lucas shall fight alongside you…” Zhou Wen vaguely heard Lucas’s voice, but he ignored him.

Zhou Wen teleported to Venus again, but he didn’t appear near the rift valley. However, he could sense the energy fluctuations coming from it. Despite being so far away, he could still feel the ground tremble. Clearly, the battle was still ongoing.

What’s the origin of that metal flower? It can actually fight that terrifying woman to such an extent. It looks like it’s on par with her.?Zhou Wen sensed the power fluctuations and realized that the metal flower’s vibrational forces were still very powerful. It wasn’t suppressed by the woman.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare get too close. He only sensed the Essence Energy fluctuations from afar and roughly determined the battle situation.

As it was too far away, it was beyond Great Brahma and Truth Listener’s range.

Sensing the power fluctuations weakening, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and dived towards the rift valley. The terrifying woman wanted him dead. If there was a chance, Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t let her off.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t her match, so this seemed to be an excellent opportunity. The woman’s and the metal flower’s powers seemed to be fading, so Zhou Wen decided to take the risk to take a look.

If he let the woman escape safely, she might chase after him when she recovered. Therefore, Zhou Wen knew that this was a rare opportunity. He had to take a look.

He put on the Invisibility Cloak and used the invisibility function. Although he didn’t know if it was useful against a Calamity-grade existence, it gave him a sense of comfort.

As Zhou Wen constantly approached the rift valley, he realized that the energy fluctuations there were still extremely terrifying. Holy light descended and the rift had long been reduced to a basin, not a narrow rift valley.

The power of Calamity-grade existences is too terrifying. Thankfully, this is Venus. If this were Earth, I wonder how many people would die.?Zhou Wen moved towards the energy fluctuations. As they were so powerful, he couldn’t see the situation inside if he was too far away.

He had to know what was happening inside before he knew if there was a chance.

The woman’s Holy Light was fine. The power of the Holy Light was very dense. It basically struck the basin and what spread out were only the aftershocks. Zhou Wen wore the Dragon King armor and with Great Brahma’s power, it wasn’t difficult to withstand it.

However, the metal flower’s vibrational power was range-based. It spread far into the distance, but the vibrations remained potent. It made Zhou Wen feel uncomfortable because the Dragon King armor was close to shattering.

This won’t do. If I continue approaching, the armor will disintegrate.

?Zhou Wen felt the Dragon King armor creaking. It was about to collapse, so he had to stop approaching.

He was still dozens of kilometers away from the basin, and he still couldn’t sense the situation inside. However, there was nothing he could do. All he could do was wait patiently, hoping that he could approach again when the surging forces weakened.

After waiting for more than half an hour, the battle over there was still abnormally terrifying. There was no way of approaching.

…

At this moment, the humans on Earth also discovered this terrifying battle.

The Cube didn’t stream the battle. It only seemed interested in the creatures that had entered the metal dimensional zone. It ignored all other creatures.

The reason humans were able to discover this battle was thanks to the various factions using spatial teleportation to place some artificial satellites near Venus.

Originally, the artificial satellites were only used to observe the situation in the Venusian dimensional zones. They never expected to see such a huge battle.

However, by the time they discovered this battle, it was already towards the end.

The artificial satellite of the Special Investigation Bureau was the first to discover the terrifying Holy Light there. As the director of the bureau, Wei Ge immediately attempted to get the artificial satellite to film the situation there.

Although they could only capture the Holy Light and the collapsing rocks, it was still shocking. Such power was clearly not caused by Venusian internal movement. It had to be a result of some creatures fighting, but they couldn’t see it.

After this news spread, many factions quickly used their artificial satellites to observe the situation. However, the scene they could see was similar to the bureau’s.

“What terrifying power. It’s a Calamity-grade battle, right?” Blood Shaman said with lingering fear as he looked at the projection obtained from the artificial satellite.

Cave Era said, “The two parties involved in the battle are undoubtedly at the Calamity grade. If we were present, we might be able to figure out something. Although the artificial satellite’s filming capabilities are good, it will probably be very difficult to capture the true body of Calamity-grade creatures.”

“Why are they fighting there and not in the Venusian dimensional zone? Could there be something special about that place?” Hermit said in thought.

“Let’s wait and see. Perhaps there will be an answer soon,” Immortal said as he looked at the projection calmly, as though he wasn’t anxious at all.

Although Hermit had the intention to suggest sending people to watch the battle, he recalled that his radical actions had caused Skysplit Tower to collapse, causing the League of Guardians to be disadvantaged. He didn’t dare make the request.

While everyone was paying attention to this battle, Zhou Wen was also waiting. Unfortunately, he hadn’t found a chance to approach.

Just as Zhou Wen was fretting, he suddenly felt a consciousness tremble in the Chaos Bead. It left him slightly taken aback as he probed the Chaos Bead with his consciousness. He immediately realized that it was the Galaxy Shell Dragon.

The moment Zhou Wen opened the Chaos Bead, the Galaxy Shell Dragon flew back and returned to Zhou Wen, transforming into a tattoo.

However, the current Galaxy Shell Dragon was somewhat different from before. The sphere it was hugging had also vanished.
