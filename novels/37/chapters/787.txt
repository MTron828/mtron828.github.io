Chapter 788: Unexpected Reunion

With Gu Shanshui leading the way, they quickly arrived at Chiang Rai.

Gu Shanshui found them a place to stay. The place he wanted to go was near Chiang Rai.

Chiang Rai and Mong Hsat were a little different. There were many people like Gu Shanshui who had tattoos and Buddha plaques.

After dinner, Li Mobai, Butterfly, and company went out to stroll around Chiang Rai. Zhou Wen stayed put, having no intention of heading out.

As Chiang Rai’s dimensional zones weren’t in the city, he wouldn’t be able to see them even if he went out.

Gu Shanshui came to Zhou Wen’s room and said, “Mr. Zhou, we are going to catch the Corpse Bug tomorrow. There are some things we need to make clear today to prevent any future trouble.”

“Master Gu, please speak.” Zhou Wen let him in.

“The place where I’m going to catch the Corpse Bug is called Dragon Corpse River. Legend has it that a dragon died there, its veracity unknown. However, Dragon Corpse Valley is extremely dangerous. The Gu inside are at least at the Epic stage. Occasionally, there will be Mythical Gu appearing. Even the Dugu family has to be careful when entering Dragon Corpse Valley.”

After pausing for a moment, Gu Shanshui continued, “The Corpse Bug I want to capture is in the most dangerous area of Dragon Corpse River. There are many taboos inside. Furthermore, that Corpse Bug is very special. I suspect that the corpse worm is a Mythical Gu born inside the dragon corpse. When the time comes, even with the help of the phoenix divine bird, I’m afraid it won’t be easy for us to subdue it. You mustn’t be careless.”

Following that, Gu Shanshui took out a self-made map and explained the details to Zhou Wen.

There weren’t many people who knew of the existence of the Corpse Bug. Furthermore, it wasn’t an easy task to lure it out. It required some special methods.

Gu Shanshui explained his plan and means in detail so that Zhou Wen could help him when the time came.

“Mr. Zhou, only the two of us know the secret of the Corpse Bug. You mustn’t leak it out. Otherwise, others will definitely vie for it,” Gu Shanshui exhorted.

“Master Gu, don’t worry. My mouth is sealed,” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s good. I won’t disturb your rest any further, Mr. Zhou.” Gu Shanshui bade farewell and left.

Zhou Wen continued grinding as the nine black dragons in the Zhuolu underground sea respawned. Zhou Wen farmed the nine dragons again.

Due to his previous experience, the operation went very smoothly. After killing the black dragon with the Wu dragon pearl, the other eight black dragons immediately became disunited, allowing Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts to slaughter them.

When he was slaughtering the sixth black dragon, Zhou Wen heard a chime as a black Companion Egg dropped.

A Companion Egg! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he turned invisible and picked it up to check its stats.

Demon Blood True Dragon (Kun): Mythical

Life Providence: Demon Dragon Bloodline (Incomplete)

Life Soul: Kun Dragon (Incomplete)

Wheel of Destiny: Dragon Domain (Incomplete)

Strength: 80

Speed: 80

Constitution: 80

Essence Energy: 80

Talent Skill: Dragon Breath, Demon Dragon Transformation, Demon Dragon True Body, Dragon Wrath

Companion Form: Dragon Scale Armor (Incomplete)

Why are there so many incomplete traits? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel greatly disappointed when he saw the Demon Blood True Dragon. Its Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and Companion Form were all incomplete. Its stats were only 80.

Could it be that I have to gather all nine black dragons to unleash the power of the Demon Blood True Dragon? Zhou Wen hatched the Demon Blood True Dragon and summoned it in its companion form. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Although the Dragon Scale Armor was incomplete, it covered the blood-colored avatar’s entire body. It was impossible to tell what was missing.

Regardless, I finally have a Mythical armor. Zhou Wen looked at the black Dragon Scale Armor on the blood-colored avatar. It looked like its defense was pretty good.

Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up the Dragon Scale Armor, he suddenly heard a familiar voice coming from the nearby corridor.

“Old Worm, are you sure you are up to the task?”

“Of course. This was an accident. The next time I take you there, I’ll definitely be able to capture that Mythical Gu.”

“I don’t know how many times I’ve heard that. Can’t you say something new?”

“Don’t worry. I have my own plans. You should have trust in your master.”

“Don’t say that. You’re not my master yet.”

“It’s only a matter of time.”

“I really wonder if you are from the Dugu family. What’s so hard about capturing a Mythical Gu. If it wasn’t for Mi’er being so beautiful and not looking like a bad person, I would have suspected that you are a cheat.”

Worm Dugu and Li Xuan? Zhou Wen listened carefully and immediately knew who the two people were.

Zhou Wen hurriedly opened the door and walked out. Indeed, he saw Worm Dugu and Li Xuan talking as they walked, preparing to enter the room.

“Li Xuan,” Zhou Wen hurriedly called out to him.

“Zhou Wen? Why are you here?” Li Xuan was surprised and delighted when he saw Zhou Wen. He ran over and wrapped his arm around Zhou Wen’s shoulder. “As expected of my good brother. You came to me because you were worried after hearing that I had come to the South District, right?”

“You aren’t a chick. Why would I be worried? I came here because I had something to do in Chiang Rai. I didn’t know you were here,” Zhou Wen said.

“Brother, you need to work on your words. They hurt my young heart, do you get it?” Li Xuan held his chest with his hand as he wore a stifled expression of heartache.

Zhou Wen ignored him and continued, “Your brother is here.

After Zhou Wen said that, he couldn’t help but be taken aback.

Originally, Li Mobai hadn’t needed to come to Chiang Rai, but he had followed. Zhou Wen wondered if he knew that Li Xuan was there.

However, after some thought, it didn’t seem likely. No one knew where Li Xuan had gone with Worm Dugu.

When Li Xuan heard that Li Mobai had come, the smile on his face vanished as his expression turned solemn.

“What’s he doing here?” Li Xuan asked.

Zhou Wen recounted how Li Mobai had invited him to the Valley of No Return to find the Guardian cocoon. When Li Xuan heard that Li Mobai had failed to make a contract, his expression darkened.

From the looks of it, he was still very concerned about Li Mobai transferring his Life Soul to him.

“By the way, there’s something else I need to tell you.” Zhou Wen wanted to tell Li Xuan about Xia Jiuhuang. It was very likely that Li Xuan’s eldest brother was Xia Jiuhuang’s victim.

Now that Xia Jiuhuang was dead, this matter had nothing to do with the Xia family. There was no need for Li Xuan to risk his life against the Xia family.

“Eldest disciple, have you thought it through and specially come to take me as your master?” Worm Dugu walked over and said with a smile as he sized up the chick on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.

“No,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Ahem, don’t be shy. Li Xuan has already agreed to be my disciple. However, I handle matters in a very clear manner. I took a fancy to you first. You are my eldest disciple. This seniority cannot be messed up,” Worm Dugu said without a change in expression.

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. Worm Dugu, who had wanted to acknowledge him as his master, suddenly changed his attitude and turned hostile.

“Don’t spout nonsense. I didn’t agree to be your disciple. You have to beat me in a bet. Perhaps if you lose the bet, you will have to take me as your master in the future? When that happens, you will have to call Old Zhou Uncle-Master,” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.

“What’s going on?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.
