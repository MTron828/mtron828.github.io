Chapter 986: True Mythical Strength

Translator: CKtalon

Hui Haifeng took a deep breath. “Although we share similar beliefs, I’m sorry. We aren’t the same kind of people. I also want humans to evolve, but I won’t choose such a method.”

“You’re just fooling yourself. I know you want to say that you will figure out an evolution method with a high success rate, but what’s the point of having a high success rate? Even if everyone can become stronger because of a 100% success rate, there will still be strong and weak outcomes due to different talent. The strong will become stronger, and the weak will become weaker. When that happens, the strong will occupy most of the resources, but the weak will obtain fewer and fewer resources.”

Night Thearch sneered and said, “Just like how no matter how long workers work, capitalists will never find it enough. No matter how low the workers’ salary is, they will think that it’s too much. In order to squeeze out the last bit of remaining value, the weak will eventually die or even be killed by their powerful companions.”

“Instead of letting such a cruel thing happen and waste so much time, why don’t you let me complete this step directly? It will save time and also allow a genius like you to not have to think about how to snatch the last grain of rice from the weak in the future. Isn’t this a happy ending for everyone? If I’m guilty, let me bear these sins.”

Night Thearch’s eyes were firm and confident. Hui Haifeng knew that what he said wasn’t an excuse he had found for himself. He probably really believed what he said.

“I don’t know if the situation you mentioned will happen, but I still want to give it a try,” Hui Haifeng said.

“That’s a pity. I really hoped that you would stay and help me. It’s a pity. However, it’s fine. If you can survive this ordeal, even without my help, you can prove your excellence. When that happens, you will understand everything I’m saying.” As Night Thearch spoke, he waved his hand, gesturing for Seven Seas Dragon King to begin.

Seven Seas Dragon King raised its strange dragon-like tentacles and let out a silent roar. The dimensional creatures that had stopped attacking humans began surrounding the people of Sea Return City.

Everyone immediately fell into despair. Faced with the flood of dimensional creatures, their fighting spirit was long gone. They originally believed that they could rely on Hui Haifeng’s gold powder to escape, but death was still the outcome.

Suddenly, the dimensional creatures that were charging at the humans slowly stopped. Seven Seas Dragon King’s body trembled as though it was engaging in an intense battle of thoughts.

“Seven Seas, what happened?” Night Thearch frowned as he looked at Seven Seas Dragon King. Seven Seas Dragon King had actually disobeyed his orders.

Seven Seas Dragon King didn’t respond, but his trembling intensified. No matter how Night Thearch ordered it, it didn’t respond.

The dimensional creatures stopped, unsure of what to do.

Zhou Wen ordered Primordial Spore to forcefully fight for control of Seven Seas Dragon King’s body from within.

Now, Primordial Spore hadn’t completely occupied the Seven Seas Dragon King’s soul, but there was no time. Zhou Wen could only make this choice.

Although Primordial Spore hadn’t completely occupied the soul, it had played a certain role. Seven Seas Dragon King was restrained, making it difficult for him to be of any use in a short period of time.

“There’s a problem!” Li Xuan looked at Seven Seas Dragon King who looked mentally ill and realized that something might have happened.

The people from Sea Return also looked at Seven Seas Dragon King eagerly. Now, their fates no longer belonged to them. Their life and death were in the hands of others. Although they knew that the chances were very low, they yearned for a miracle to happen.

“Come out.” Night Thearch seemed to realize something as a cold glint flashed in his eyes. He pressed a hand on the head of Seven Seas Dragon King and a strange electric force penetrated Seven Seas Dragon King’s body.

Zhou Wen felt the horror of the force. He originally wanted to continue hiding, but now, he had no choice but to leave.

He pulled Miya out of Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach and teleported out of his body. He arrived above Seven Seas Dragon King and looked at Night Thearch from afar.

The people from Sea Return City were alarmed. Another human had appeared above Seven Seas Dragon King. It looked like a young couple.

“I knew it. Old Zhou wouldn’t die so easily.” Li Xuan didn’t find it strange when he saw Zhou Wen.

“You aren’t dead?” Night Thearch was slightly surprised. He originally imagined that Zhou Wen had been devoured by Seven Seas Dragon King, but he never expected him to survive.

“Night Thearch, it’s best you stop. The Seven Seas Dragon King no longer obeys your orders. It’s impossible for your plan to continue,” Zhou Wen said.

Night Thearch said indifferently, “Your strength isn’t enough to affect Seven Seas Dragon King. I believe you relied on a Companion Beast to influence it. As long as I kill you, your Companion Beast will die with you. Seven Seas Dragon King will naturally recover.”

“Many people have wanted to kill me, but they failed in the end. I don’t think it’s easy,” Zhou Wen said as he shot a look at Miya.

Miya nodded and immediately turned around to fly towards the sea.

Zhou Wen had already discussed it with her. She was in charge of rescuing Qin Ling and Feng Qiuyan while Zhou Wen was in charge of holding back Night Thearch.

Night Thearch saw through their plan at a glance, but he didn’t stop Miya. This was because there was no need. As long as Zhou Wen was killed, everything would return to normal.

“Wang Mingyuan is quite a figure. I never expected the disciples he taught to be such figures as well. Unfortunately, firstly, you didn’t fuse with a Guardian like Wang Mingyuan, and secondly, you didn’t contract a Guardian. You have no right to be my opponent,” Night Thearch said as he slowly raised his hand. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s nothing impressive having Guardians. I’ve killed a few too,” Zhou Wen said.

“I’m afraid the Guardians you killed can’t even transform into a Terror form, right?” Night Thearch raised his right hand high and slashed down like a blade. At the same time, he said, “Today, I’ll let you see what true Mythical power is.”

Zhou Wen quickly retreated, hoping to dodge Night Thearch’s attack, but Night Thearch’s strike didn’t produce any ordinary Essence Energy or light.

The sky suddenly darkened, plunging the entire world into darkness. One couldn’t see their fingers, nor could they see anything else. Night Thearch’s figure had also vanished.

“What is terror? The unknown and the invisible are the true terrors. You can’t see or touch a true Terror-grade powerhouse. As long as I’m willing, I can take your life at any time. This is a true god. It’s irresistible and impossible to compete...” Night Thearch’s voice echoed in the boundless darkness. He seemed to be everywhere, but he didn’t seem to be anywhere at the same time.
