Chapter 1166: God of Unkilling

Zhou Wen reached out to grab the man on the floor. The black-robed man didn’t hesitate to order a large number of Gu to lunge at the unconscious man. Like a sandstorm, they were everywhere.

The characteristics of those Gu were completely different. If it were an ordinary person, they would definitely not be able to handle so many.

Before Zhou Wen could move, Chick let out a long cry. Countless Gu instantly fell from the sky. Although they didn’t die, they lay on the ground trembling, completely ignoring their master’s orders.

The black-robed man’s pupils constricted as he urged the Gu, but it was completely useless. Even the Mythical Gu were trembling silently on the ground. No matter how he urged, there was no reaction.

The man in black bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood. He wanted to use his Blood Essence to jolt the Gu, but the Gu remained motionless.

How is this possible? The black-robed man was alarmed.

Those Gu’s lives were intricately connected to him. He had forcefully spewed out his Blood Essence and Essence Energy to stimulate his potential, making the Gu feel the threat of death. Usually, they would fight to the death. Even if they encountered their natural enemy, they would fight to the death.

However, no matter how he stimulated his body’s potential, the Gu didn’t move as he wished—they only trembled.

Zhou Wen had already grabbed the unconscious man by the collar and lifted him up.

“Zhou Wen, do you know that our Dugu family has worked with the An family for many years? Do you really want to destroy the trust and relationship the two families have built over the years because of a traitor’s lies?” The black-robed man paused before continuing, “Furthermore, he has already been poisoned by all kinds of Gu. It’s impossible for him to live on. Is it worth it to do all that for a person who’s about to die? Hand him over to me. Our Dugu family will think of a way to contact Second Master. You just need to wait for a period of time.”

“I’ve already told you that my surname isn’t An. Furthermore, if the relationship is so easily severed, there’s no point maintaining it.” Zhou Wen looked at the man in his hand and continued, “Most importantly, I don’t have that much patience.”

With that said, Zhou Wen stabbed at the man’s body with his other hand. His fingers that were akin to a sharp blade stabbed into the man’s body with a resplendent glow.

His hand was like a blade as it slashed across the man’s body repeatedly.

When the black-robed man saw Zhou Wen’s actions, he imagined that he was going to personally finish off the unconscious man. He said with a smile, “Whoever understands the times is a great man. The Dugu family will remember your friendship. We will find Second Master as soon as possible...”

Before he could finish his sentence, his smile froze on his face. Then, his eyes were filled with horror.

Zhou Wen’s final punch struck the unconscious man. The Gu that had drilled into his body were sent flying. Even the Brain Drilling Worms that had drilled into his brain were no exception.

The moment the Gu were blasted out, Chick spat out a golden flame that burned all the Gu to ashes.

The black-robed man clearly saw that Zhou Wen’s attack had beaten the man into a pulp. There was no reason for him to continue living, nonetheless the man’s injuries rapidly healed. In an instant, he was like a normal person. The wounds on his body were completely gone.

The unconscious man had already woken up. He landed on the ground and crawled up. He looked at his body in surprise and delight.

“Zhou Wen, my Dugu family is being besieged by a group of unknown people. Second Master and the rest are trapped in Myriad Elephant Valley...” the man anxiously shouted at Zhou Wen.

“Really?” Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the black-robed man.

The black-robed man wasn’t flustered at all. He said with a smile, “Don’t tell me you will listen to a traitor spouting nonsense?”

“Does that mean the Dugu family is fine?” Zhou Wen asked.

“They’re not exactly fine. It’s just a matter caused by this traitor. We’ll naturally be fine after capturing him,” the black-robed man said.

“Zhou Wen, you must not believe him. He’s not a member of our Dugu family...” the man said anxiously.

“Isn’t your method too despicable? You want to incite Zhou Wen to become enemies with my Dugu family so that you can escape in the chaos? It’s useless. You are also a member of the Dugu family, so you should know the means of the Dugu family,” the black-robed man said indifferently. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The man was about to say something when Zhou Wen interrupted him and said, “Since the Dugu family is fine, I’ll take him in to take a look. If he’s a traitor, I’ll personally hand him over to Worm Dugu.”

“Alright, let’s do that. I’ll go in with you.” The man was delighted when he heard that and hurriedly expressed his stance.

“Sure.” The black-robed man agreed without any hesitation. He even looked at the man and sneered. “Unkilling Dugu, I’m afraid you are mistaken to use such means to sow discord between our Dugu family and Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen and Second Master are close friends. So what if you let him enter Myriad Elephant Valley?”

However, Unkilling Dugu said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, you have to be careful. Since he’s letting us into the valley, there must be an ambush inside.”

“Your name is Unkilling Dugu?” Zhou Wen didn’t know who was speaking the truth or who was lying. However, he knew the name Unkilling Dugu.

This person was very famous in the Dugu family. His birth name wasn’t this, but after condensing a Life Providence named God of Unkilling, he had the nickname Unkilling Dugu. Perhaps because the name of the God of Unkilling was too resounding, eventually, no one remembered his original name.

The God of Unkilling was indeed famous, but it was famous for being a crippled Life Providence. This was because with this Life Providence, Unkilling Dugu couldn’t even kill an ant. His Life Providence destined him to never be stained with blood.

“Yes.” Unkilling Dugu nodded.

“Your Life Providence is the God of Unkilling?” Zhou Wen sized up Unkilling Dugu and was somewhat suspicious. This was because the legendary Unkilling Dugu was likely in his forties or fifties, and this man looked to be in his thirties.

“Yes.” Unkilling Dugu saw Zhou Wen’s puzzlement and explained, “The Essence Energy Art I cultivate is somewhat special. It makes me look much younger than my actual age. Perhaps this is the benefit of not killing.”

Zhou Wen nodded and didn’t harp on Unkilling Dugu’s identity. He looked at the black-robed man and asked, “Can we enter the valley now?”

“Of course, you can do so anytime. I still have to thank you for helping our Dugu family capture the traitor. Our Dugu family will definitely repay you. However, you have to watch over Unkilling Dugu. He’s very sinister and he’s cunning. Don’t let him escape.” As the black-robed man spoke, he made an inviting gesture before walking towards Myriad Elephant Valley.

“He can’t escape.” Zhou Wen gestured for Unkilling Dugu to lead the way.

Unkilling Dugu didn’t hesitate. He gritted his teeth and walked towards Myriad Elephant Valley without any intention of retreating.

Zhou Wen followed behind Unkilling Dugu into Myriad Elephant Valley. Ya’er, Tsukuyomi, Chick, and the antelope followed.
