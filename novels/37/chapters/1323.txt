Chapter 1324: Borrowing A Pet

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen checked a lot of information and realized that Luck Companion Beasts were indeed very rare. They were basically things that could only be chanced upon by luck. Ignoring Mythical Luck Beasts, even Epic Luck Beasts were rare.

After asking Gu Dian for information, the outcome wasn’t too good. Previously, there were two lucky pets on the black market. Due to the high price, no one was willing to buy them. They had been auctioned off a few days ago.

Gu Dian refused to say who had successfully bid for them due to his professional ethics.

However, even if he didn’t say it, Zhou Wen already knew that the two Companion Beasts were on him.

After doing a round of investigations, Zhou Wen knew that he definitely wouldn’t be able to find a lucky pet. Hui Haifeng had basically swept away all the lucky pets he could obtain. Ignoring the huge expenditure, it was very likely that he had used his connections and special items to trade. It was almost impossible for Zhou Wen to obtain a Luck Companion Beast from the market.

Zhou Wen suddenly thought of Wang Lu. Wang Lu had a Luck Life Providence to begin with, and she had quite a number of lucky pets. He wondered if any of them had yet to hatch.

“Do you have time? I have something to ask you.” Zhou Wen sent Wang Lu a message.

“So you only think of me when something’s up!” Soon, Wang Lu sent a message.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to explain, but on second thought, it did seem to be the case. Every time he took the initiative to send a message to Wang Lu, he seemed to require her help. He couldn’t help but blush and couldn’t bring himself to ask Wang Lu for help.

“Fine, I know you’re a busy person. If there’s anything, just say it. After all, you haven’t paid off the meals you owe. It won’t hurt to pile on more.” Wang Lu sent another message.

“I’ll treat you to a meal in a few days,” Zhou Wen replied in embarrassment.

“Then I have to rip you off good. I have to make you bleed.” Wang Lu asked again, “What’s the matter? Make it quick.”

“I just want to ask if you still have any Luck Companion Beasts. I want to buy a few,” Zhou Wen said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I have lucky pets, but they aren’t for sale.” Wang Lu quickly sent a message back.

Zhou Wen was only somewhat disappointed, but he didn’t fault Wang Lu. Luck Companion Beasts meant more to Wang Lu than ordinary people.

Ordinary people could only increase their luck by a little when they obtained a Luck Companion Beast, but they enhanced Wang Lu’s Life Providence. Its effects were much stronger than ordinary people. It could be said that a Luck Companion Beast was similar to Wang Lu’s exclusive Companion Beast.

I’m being too silly. Wang Lu doesn’t even have the time to collect Luck Companion Beasts. Why would she sell them??Zhou Wen felt that he was a little stupid for not thinking of this before. He shouldn’t have asked Wang Lu. This question put her in a difficult position.

“I’m just asking. It’s not of much use. I’ll look for you in a couple of days and treat you to a feast.” Zhou Wen sent a message.

“I’m definitely not selling it, but if you need it urgently, I can lend it to you for the time being. Why do you need a lucky pet?” Wang Lu sent another message.

“Can I borrow it?” Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly said, “I want to use lucky pets to attempt the Venusian dimensional zone. Is it convenient to borrow it?”

Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to return the Companion Eggs after hatching them, but Zhou Wen had the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, so it wasn’t difficult for him to return them.

“Alright, come to my place to get it. It’s not convenient for me to go out at the moment,” Wang Lu said.

“Wait for me.” Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he immediately rushed to the Wang family home.

Zhou Wen left without a word. The officers Hui Haifeng had sent couldn’t help but grumble inwardly.

They had their doubts about whether Zhou Wen could lead them to the rankings. They only trusted Hui Haifeng, but that didn’t mean they trusted Zhou Wen completely.

At the very least, Zhou Wen’s present performance wasn’t reassuring.

They had been here for two days and had only seen Zhou Wen once on the first day. Then, they hadn’t seen him again. There was no training, no discussion for cooperation—not even a plan. They didn’t have any confidence in attempting the Venusian dimensional zone together. Anyone would feel uneasy. After all, this was a matter that risked their lives.

“Captain Wei, can we count on Zhou Wen?” an officer whispered to Wei Yang.

Wei Yang was the soldier with a stiff face. His facial features looked like they had been drawn on. He was the captain of this special ops team.

Without waiting for Wei Yang to reply, the officer continued, “The creatures that can enter the rankings are either Calamity-grade or large organizations like the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians. The Holy Spirit Association has the augmentation of Fairy Peacock and True Martial, as well as an invincible existence like Ya. The League of Guardians has the guarantee of temporal and spatial powers. What do we have? Can Zhou Wen really lead us into the rankings by himself?”

In fact, it wasn’t just him. Many officers had such concerns. Zhou Wen was indeed famous, but there was still a certain gap between him and large organizations like the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians.

Furthermore, it seemed difficult for one person’s strength to beat any collective strength.

As soldiers, they could only obey orders, but to say that they weren’t nervous or afraid was a lie.

Wei Yang said expressionlessly, “Zhou Wen’s strength is undoubtedly top-notch among humans. From his past achievements, we can tell that this person isn’t simple. Furthermore, even the president holds him in such high esteem. I believe he’s definitely a person with true talent. We don’t need to worry about this. All we need to do is make preparations and help him get into the rankings.”

“How do we prepare? The president told us to listen to his orders, but we don’t even see him now,” the officer said gloomily.

Wei Yang’s expression remained unchanged as he said calmly, “The president has always been meticulous and comprehensive. If the president says that Zhou Wen can do it, he definitely can. Zhou Wen probably has his own plans for not meeting us now. All we need to do is stay sharp and unleash our greatest abilities when the time comes.”

Although the officers were somewhat uneasy, they didn’t let this uneasy feeling continue spreading due to Wei Yang’s influence. Instead, it weakened significantly. However, they were still displeased with Zhou Wen’s actions.

Zhou Wen rushed to the Wang family home that very night, but unfortunately, there were too many dimensional zones along the way. With his abilities, he couldn’t directly reach the Wang family. All he could do was constantly use instant transmission to travel and circle around some dimensional zones that had yet to be explored by humans.

Thankfully, nothing happened along the way. In less than two days, Zhou Wen reached the Wang family home.

Wang Lu curled her lips when she saw Zhou Wen. “If you weren’t borrowing a Companion Beast, would you have ever taken the initiative to repay the debt?”
