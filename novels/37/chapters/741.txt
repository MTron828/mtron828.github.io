Chapter 742: Pure Hook Evil-Slaying

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen arrived in front of Forbidden City’s city gates and saw many people gathered outside. They were all here to watch the battle, but because the city gates were sealed, no one could enter.

The Meridian Gate was tightly shut with people from the Xia family standing guard outside. Forbidden City had four city gates, but usually, only Meridian Gate could be opened. The other three city gates needed a certain opportunity for their opening, so the only way to enter and exit Forbidden City was through the Meridian Gate.

“Zhou Wen, Young Master Xia is already waiting for you in the city. Please enter,” a Xia family guard said to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was about to walk in with the log when he was stopped by the guard.

“People can enter, but things have to be left outside,” the guard said as he pointed at the log on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.

“Does your Xia family have to take away their opponent’s weapons before a battle?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

The moment Zhou Wen said that, the onlookers roared with laughter. Although they didn’t believe that Zhou Wen really used such a huge club as a weapon, it didn’t stop them from feeling contempt towards the Xia family’s high-handedness.

“Let him in,” a middle-aged man on top of the city gates said to the guard.

Only then did the guard let Zhou Wen enter the city with the log.

“Old Master, is it really a good idea to let him in like this? If there’s really something wrong with the log as Liuchuan said, wouldn’t it be very disadvantageous for him?” the middle-aged man said to Old Master Xia, who was sitting at the top of the city gate to watch the battle.

“It’s fine. This is Forbidden City. Even if Leng Zongzheng is hidden in that log, he won’t be able to escape unscathed today,” Old Master Xia said calmly.

...

On a tall building in the distance of Forbidden City, Shen Yuchi was looking at the situation around Meridian Gate with his binoculars.

He couldn’t enter Forbidden City; he probably wouldn’t be able to see anything even if he went to the Meridian Gate.

“Siyuan, what’s your take regarding this battle’s outcome?” Shen Yuchi asked Qiao Siyuan when he saw Zhou Wen enter the Meridian Gate. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I believe regardless of the outcome today, it will be very difficult for Zhou Wen to walk out of Forbidden City,” Qiao Siyuan replied.

Shen Yuchi didn’t comment as he continued using his binoculars to observe the situation inside Forbidden City.

However, there was a mysterious interference from Forbidden City. They could only see the area above the buildings, but not the actual situation inside.

...

Zhou Wen walked through the Meridian Gate and saw five white compounds leading to the Gate of Supreme Harmony. Xia Liuchuan was standing in front of it.

Passing through the Gate of Supreme Harmony was the Hall of Supreme Harmony. However, it was unknown if the layout of the city had changed after the dimensional storms.

Zhou Wen looked around but didn’t see any dimensional creatures.

“There’s no need to look around. There are no dimensional creatures in Forbidden City. You can fight me with all your might without worry,” Xia Liuchuan said.

“That’s great. However, since it’s the final battle at the peak of Forbidden City, let’s fight at a higher spot. I think it’s quite high there. Why don’t we head there?” Zhou Wen said as he pointed in the direction of a Corner Tower.

“There’s no need to go through so much trouble,” Xia Liuchuan said as a sword appeared in his hand. “This sword’s name is Ancient Pure Hook. It’s a Mythical Companion Beast. I believe you also have a Mythical Companion Beast, so I won’t hide it.”

With that said, Xia Liuchuan thrust his sword at Zhou Wen. He was a straightforward person who fought without any hesitation.

The sword beam was like snow. His body and sword seemed to instantly appear in front of Zhou Wen at an unbelievable speed.

Although Zhou Wen was proficient in movement techniques, it was impossible for him to dodge such a fast sword while carrying such a heavy log. Therefore, he could only draw his saber to fend off the attack.

Clang!

The saber and sword collided. Zhou Wen’s body remained motionless, but Xia Liuchuan was forced to take a few steps back.

It wasn’t that Zhou Wen’s strength was stronger than Xia Liuchuan’s, but that the log he was carrying was too heavy. It pressed down on his body, stopping him from retreating.

Although Xia Liuchuan retreated, he didn’t lose his balance. He tapped the ground with his toe and thrust his sword forward again. His sword technique was swift and fierce like a ghost.

Zhou Wen’s saber techniques weren’t slow either. He held the log with one hand and brandished his saber with the other. The saber and sword constantly clashed, and Zhou Wen advanced step by step, gradually approaching the Gate of Supreme Harmony.

Zhou Wen wanted to try his luck at the Hall of Supreme Harmony. After all, it was the most honorable place in the city. It was most likely the peak of Forbidden City.

Furthermore, there was only one Hall of Supreme Harmony, but there were four Corner Towers. If the Hall of Supreme Harmony didn’t work, it wouldn’t be too late for him to consider trying the Corner Towers.

“To be able to master such a mature and steady saber technique at such a young age, this Zhou Wen is indeed extraordinary.” Old Master Xia narrowed his eyes as though he was admiring a treasure.

“Zhou Wen once defeated John who had a contract with the Guardian. His strength is indeed extraordinary. Furthermore, according to our investigations, he definitely has more than two Mythical Companion Beasts,” the middle-aged man said.

“The stronger he is, the better.” Old Master Xia smiled.

Zhou Wen originally hoped to fight all the way to the front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, but Xia Liuchuan clearly wouldn’t be suppressed by him the entire time.

Xia Liuchuan’s figure suddenly changed as he appeared behind Zhou Wen like a phantom, stabbing at his back.

Zhou Wen was just too slow while carrying the wooden log. He didn’t have the time to turn around, but he didn’t plan on doing so anyway. He swung his saber and blocked Xia Liuchuan’s strike.

“The log on your body is too heavy. Why don’t you put it down so that we can fight?” Xia Liuchuan didn’t continue attacking as he looked at Zhou Wen’s back.

“I’ll naturally put it down when it’s time to put it down,” Zhou Wen turned around and said to Xia Liuchuan.

Xia Liuchuan didn’t say anything else. However, the Pure Hook Sword in his hand emitted a strange glow. It was like a holy sword that made people have the urge to prostrate themselves in worship.

This time, Xia Liuchuan attacked again, but it wasn’t that easy to deal with. When the Bamboo Blade and the Pure Hook Sword met, Zhou Wen felt his palm shake as he involuntarily took a few steps back. The Bamboo Blade nearly flew out of his hand.

“The Pure Hook Sword is known as the Exalted Peerless Sword. It can bestow me with power at the Mythical stage,” Xia Liuchuan said as he brandished his sword again.

With a thought from Zhou Wen, Doctor Darkness transformed into a soul and attached to him. Zhou Wen brandished his saber to fend him off again. Although he was still sent retreating by the Pure Hook Sword, he wasn’t as pathetic as before.

“Just show me what you’ve got. There’s no need to hide it,” Zhou Wen said as he held his saber.

“As you wish.” Xia Liuchuan waved his left hand and another sword appeared in his hand.

This sword was different from the Pure Hook Sword. It was a small sword that was about sixty centimeters long. It wasn’t as beautiful as the Pure Hook Sword, as though it carried a sense of resentment.

“The sword’s name is Evil-Slaying. It’s also a Mythical Companion Beast. I’ve cultivated for so many years, and most of my techniques are delivered through these two swords,” Xia Liuchuan said as he glanced at the sword in his hand with a glazed look.
