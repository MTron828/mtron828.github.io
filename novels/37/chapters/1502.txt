Chapter 1503 The Golden Wyrm Scissors Shows Its Prowess

Zhou Wen reeled with anxiety. He couldn’t help but feel greatly disappointed when he saw the monster’s tail heal.

However, Zhou Wen saw the Golden Wyrm Scissors split into two the next second. Their might didn’t show any signs of weakening. It looked like their Essence Energy remained abundant, and there wasn’t any problem of Essence Energy depletion.

How did this happen? Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he immediately thought of the reason.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors’ Calamity Zone was called True Gold Fire Refinement. Zhou Wen never understood what use this Calamity Zone had.

This was because no flames were produced when he got the Golden Wyrm Scissors to use its Calamity Zone.

Zhou Wen finally understood that the power of the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ domain seemed to be effective only in flames.

How can there be such a strange domain? Wouldn’t this domain be useless if the place didn’t have any flames? Yet, it really came in handy. I’ll write this off as luck. Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors exerted its powers again and again, as though it didn’t need to worry about Essence Energy.

Zhou Wen also discovered a strange phenomenon. The Golden Wyrm Scissors’ body was slowly changing. The golden scissors became heavier and heavier as the scales on the wyrm’s body became more and more crystalline.

He took out his phone and took a look. Indeed, he realized that the various stats of the Golden Wyrm Scissors had increased.

Only then did Zhou Wen understand that the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ Calamity Zone wasn’t a combat domain. It was considered a zone that allowed self-evolving through the power of the flames.

The monster was probably at the Hell level as well. Coincidentally, it was fire-elemental. Under the high temperature of Dubhe, it allowed the Golden Wyrm Scissors to unleash its strongest might.

Upon seeing this scene, Zhou Wen hoped that the monster could be killed later. He wanted to use its Calamity Zone to help the Golden Wyrm Scissors raise its stats.

Even if it couldn’t advance to the Heaven level, he could raise its basic stats to the peak of the Hell level.

Zhou Wen had already summoned his sniper rifle, but he put it away when he saw this situation.

After being attacked again and again, the monster also realized the danger. It no longer suffered a beating passively. High-temperature beams shot out from its eyes as it spat out high-temperature energy bullets.

However, such an attack wasn’t of much use to Chick and the Golden Wyrm Scissors. Instead, it gave the Golden Wyrm Scissors better tampering, significantly increasing its stats.

Zhou Wen became fonder of the Golden Wyrm Scissors as he watched on. It was very suitable for combat in such an environment. Their powerful offensive strength, coupled with the evolutionary domain, only made them stronger. I’ll probably need the Golden Wyrm Scissors to be my primary force when clearing the Dubhe dimensional zone in the future, Zhou Wen thought.

The monster could only blame it on its luck. It was clearly at the Hell level, but of all creatures, it encountered Chick and the Golden Wyrm Scissors. It couldn’t unleash the combat strength and suppression it should have.

This also made Zhou Wen understand that even if one reached the Calamity grade, creatures with the strength of a single system would find it difficult to unleash their full combat strength when facing their nemesis.

There was no absolutely invincible power in this world. Every power had a nemesis. The ability the Lost Immortal Sutra gave Zhou Wen undoubtedly gave him a huge advantage.

Although he might not be able to crush peers at his level and there might be someone who could match Zhou Wen in some aspects, Zhou Wen would have a huge advantage in relatively complicated environments and battles. It was almost impossible for him to be restrained as he could adapt to various combat situations.

Ordinary people definitely couldn’t fight like Zhou Wen. They could only use Companion Beasts and other methods to make up for their flaws.

However, compared to Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen had a greater advantage. Few people on Earth had a Calamity-grade Companion Beast.

It’s no wonder so many people wanted Venus’s Companion Beast. There are many stars in the Universe. As long as I fight in such an environment, the Golden Wyrm Scissors can produce extremely powerful combat strength. Unless there’s an overwhelming disadvantage, they’ll become stronger the more they fight. Zhou Wen looked at the stats on his phone. As the barrier domain shrank, the energy in it erupted stronger. The Golden Wyrm Scissors’ stats increased.

Crack!

The Golden Wyrm Scissors snipped off the monster’s body again, but this time, the sound was somewhat strange.

As the monster’s body cracked, the barrier shattered. The energy inside scattered and quickly vanished.

The monster’s body had already been snipped into two several times, but this time, it was somewhat different. Its two halves were rapidly collapsing rather than fusing.

The massive glass-like body constantly shattered as the crystal turned to dust. It melted under the celestial body’s high temperature as its body gradually plummeted.

Chick let out a long cry as it grabbed half of its crumbling body with one claw and dragged it into space.

Even without the high temperatures, the monster’s body rapidly disintegrated. Soon, there were only two halves of a crystal ball. The crystal ball didn’t collapse as strange energy flowed inside.

It was likely that the monster died only after the crystal ball was hit by the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ Clean Break.

Chick cried out in joy as it flew over and swallowed the two halves of the crystal ball.

Soon, the phoenix flames on Chick’s body became thicker and thicker. Finally, they formed an egg-shaped barrier that constantly shimmered with light. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Is it about to advance to the Calamity grade? Zhou Wen called out a few times, but he didn’t receive any response from Chick. He knew that Chick might have entered an evolutionary state again.

He reached out and stored Chick in its egg form into the Chaos Bead. Zhou Wen looked at the Golden Wyrm Scissors floating beside him. Although he couldn’t count on Chick anymore, with the Golden Wyrm Scissors, there shouldn’t be much danger as long as he didn’t enter the dimensional zone.

Zhou Wen decided to continue searching to see if he could find the dimensional zone on Dubhe.

As he searched, he checked the information on the Golden Wyrm Scissors and realized that its four stats had already reached 267. If that monster hadn’t died too early, it would have increased even more.

Zhou Wen attempted to get the Golden Wyrm Scissors to enter the high-temperature area of Dubhe, but as Companion Beasts couldn’t be too far from their owners and Zhou Wen didn’t dare go too close, the Golden Wyrm Scissors also found it difficult to venture deep. The surface temperature wasn’t of much help to its evolution.

The Dubhe was massive. Zhou Wen searched for a long time but didn’t find any traces of the dimensional zone. All he could do was teleport to the other companion star to take a look, but he still didn’t find anything.

Strange, why can’t I find the dimensional zone? Zhou Wen knew that there had to be a dimensional zone that could be reached through the Cube, but he couldn’t find it outside.

Could it be that the entire dimensional zone is inside Dubhe? In that case, I probably won’t be able to enter the dimensional zone without sufficient fire-elemental defensive equipment. Zhou Wen was already thinking about where to get such immunity-providing equipment. It would be best if it was at the Calamity grade.
