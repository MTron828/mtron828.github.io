Chapter 1449: New Bamboo Blade

Zhou Wen held the magic box and didn’t dare move as he waited for the crystal chandelier’s time to change.

The number on the crystal chandelier gradually changed and it soon returned to 9 before finally returning to its original state. Then, he saw the door to the shrine appear on one side of the garden.

Zhou Wen went up to push the door, but he couldn’t budge it. Knowing that this thing could only be opened by Su Yi, he released Su Yi and Liu Yun.

Su Yi was still attracted by Zhou Wen’s fragrance and other powers. Liu Yun was much better. The curses inflicted on him had clearly weakened. He also had a certain resistance against Zhou Wen’s attractiveness. At the very least, he no longer had hearts in his eyes. However, he was clearly a little exhausted.

“Eldest Senior Brother, how can we open the door?” Zhou Wen got the obedient Su Yi to give it a try, but she failed to push the door open.

“You have to get her to press both hands on the unicorn horn on the door and have it pierce through her skin. Only her blood can open the door,” said Liu Yun.

Zhou Wen got Su Yi to give it a try. Indeed, when she pressed her hands on the unicorn symbol’s horn at the same time, her palms were pierced by the horn and they stained it with blood. The door immediately opened a crack.

Zhou Wen and company hurriedly grabbed Su Yi and teleported out of the shrine.

After exiting the shrine, Zhou Wen directly took on his Terror form, preventing the program team who were searching outside from seeing him.

“I’ll leave the matters here to you. I’ll deal with the magic box first,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan before heading for the exit of the Magic Palace.

After instant transmitting out of the Magic Palace, Zhou Wen teleported to the Moon.

“Lady Supreme Yin, do you know what this is?” Zhou Wen brought the magic box to Lady Supreme Yin’s temple.

Lady Supreme Yin’s voice drifted out of the temple. “It looks like a spatial item.”

Zhou Wen recounted the origins of the magic box to her. After listening, she pondered for a moment before saying, “According to myths and legends, there are two possibilities for the magic box. One is that the magic box is a Calamity-grade creature, but it doesn’t look like one. The second possibility is that there’s a Calamity creature trapped in the magic box. Once the magic box is opened, the Calamity creature inside will escape and cause a huge disaster. The latter possibility is very likely in my opinion.”

“In that case, there’s a high chance that there’s a dimensional creature with the attribute of Misfortune inside. Is it possible to use the Calamity creature in the Rubik’s Cube to make a Mythical Serum and give it to Little Chan?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.

“Unless you have the ability to suppress the unknown numbers of Calamity creatures inside, you can abandon that thought. From the vantage point of myths, the Calamity creatures in the magic box are probably not ordinary Calamity-grade creatures. Furthermore, it’s very unlikely that there’s more than one. Otherwise, it’s impossible for them to cause such a huge disaster.” Lady Supreme Yin paused before saying, “Besides, I’ve already said it before. It’s best to use Mythical creatures to create Mythical Serum. Otherwise, Wang Chan’s body might not be able to withstand it.”

Zhou Wen was immediately depressed. He held the magic box and asked, “Any ideas on how we should deal with this thing?”

“What else can you do? If you don’t have the ability to destroy the things inside, seal it forever and never attempt to open it,” said Lady Supreme Yin.

Zhou Wen knew that it was best not to open the magic box. He sent it into the Chaos Bead and sealed it in a corner.

After leaving the Moon, he took Ya’er back to Luoyang.

Zhou Wen finally had the time to look at the four newly obtained Calamity-grade Companion Beasts when he returned to his room.

War Headband: Calamity (Limited to Lady of Misfortune Life Providence)

Helios Necklace: Calamity (Limited to Lady of Misfortune Life Providence)

Hades Ring: Calamity (Limited to Lady of Misfortune Life Providence)

After Zhou Wen saw the stats of the four Calamity-grade Companion Eggs, he immediately felt so depressed that he nearly blew a gasket. These four Companion Beasts were limited in their usage. Even if he obtained them, he wouldn’t be able to summon them without a special Life Providence.

What a pity!?Zhou Wen carefully studied the stats of the four Calamity-grade Companion Eggs. They were indeed pretty good, but unfortunately, he couldn’t use them.

Wang Chan’s Life Providence has the attribute of Misfortune, but it doesn’t seem to be the Lady of Misfortune. I wonder if she can summon these four Companion Beasts.?Zhou Wen thought that he could give it a try if he had the opportunity in the future.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on trying. Firstly, Wang Chan’s level was too low. It wasn’t a good thing for her to have these Calamity-grade Companion Beasts.

Secondly, Zhou Wen had a very serious problem to resolve. After being augmented inside Pandora’s shrine, no matter where Zhou Wen went, anyone who saw him would be like a beast in heat. The look in their eyes left Zhou Wen shuddering.

Creatures at the Terror grade and above had a slight resistance to his powers.

I have to resolve this problem.?Zhou Wen didn’t dare leave the house. He had to come up with a solution.

Even Truth Listener and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder were unable to resolve his problem.

After all, these powers were beneficial to Zhou Wen. They weren’t malicious powers like curses. Evil Nullification and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder weren’t of much use.

Despite racking his brains, Zhou Wen couldn’t think of any way to completely eliminate the strange powers in him.

“Young Master Wen, your Bamboo Blade has been reforged.” An Sheng brought a rectangular box to Zhou Wen’s yard.

Thankfully, the powers didn’t affect An Sheng at all. An Sheng had been delivering meals over the past few days, and he didn’t dare let anyone enter the yard.

“Leave it there.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about the Bamboo Blade.

“It’s best you take a look. If there’s anything that’s unsuitable and needs modification, I can take it back and get them to modify it,” An Sheng said as he placed the box in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen thought that it made sense and opened the box.

He took a look and didn’t pick it up. However, Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement, “Was the Bamboo Blade’s scabbard also reforged?”

“Yes, the blade and scabbard are one. A reforged blade will be somewhat incompatible with the previous scabbard, so we decided to reforge them together,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen reached out for the Bamboo Blade and couldn’t help but be alarmed.

The former Bamboo Blade was already heavy enough, but now, it was heavier than before. Zhou Wen found it very heavy.

This was despite his strength. It was obvious that the Bamboo Blade’s weight was extremely terrifying.

The Bamboo Blade’s size appeared to have enlarged. It was about four feet long together with the scabbard. Its entire body was gray, unlike the former Bamboo Blade which was closer to black. It looked very strange, but the quality was excellent.
