Chapter 1090: Indeed A Fool

Translator: CKtalon

These words were extremely arrogant, but the humans watching felt zeal and ardor pump through their veins.

“Well said. Nice tirade.” Xia Liuchuan couldn’t help but praise.

“He’s just a fool who has lived a little longer. Haha, what an interesting fellow.” Zhang Chunqiu laughed until his tears were about to fall.

“I suddenly feel that it’s not bad to have such a friend,” Dugu Ge, who had always abided by the mantra ‘silence is golden,’ suddenly said.

“What a pity. He said that he no longer makes friends,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“I’ll treat him as a friend. What does his willingness to make friends have to do with me?” Dugu Ge said expressionlessly.

“That’s... true...” Zhang Chunqiu realized that he couldn’t refute Dugu Ge.

“That’s totally right. I also want to shamelessly acknowledge such an interesting person as a friend,” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile.

As for Jiuyue, he was extremely furious. Instantly, he entered his Terror form and wanted Zhong Ziya dead once and for all.

Zhou Wen was feeling extremely uneasy. Zhong Ziya was severely injured, and those injuries were as genuine as can be. It would be too dangerous if he continued fighting.

However, Zhong Ziya had no intention of giving up on the battle. He continued battling Jiuyue.

Yet, although Jiuyue still had the advantage, he wasn’t able to completely suppress Zhong Ziya like before.

Zhong Ziya’s combat strength was constantly improving.

No, it shouldn’t be said that it was his combat strength. His power hadn’t become stronger, but his understanding and realm of power had become stronger. He was growing at an unbelievable speed.

“No... Impossible...” Jiuyue almost couldn’t believe that such a thing would happen.

In such a short period of time, Zhong Ziya seemed to have completely understood and absorbed the various abilities and realms he had previously displayed.

The methods he had used previously were no longer effective against Zhong Ziya. Jiuyue had to use new abilities or have a higher understanding of nomological power to continue suppressing Zhong Ziya.

However, once he used it, it was useless to use the same method again against Zhong Ziya. This was because Zhong Ziya already understood the power and realm.

They were both spatial-type and at the Terror grade. The advantage that Jiuyue had was his realm and superior understanding.

Now, this advantage was rapidly being eroded. Jiuyue’s expression finally changed.

Now, he just wanted to kill Zhong Ziya quickly. He did his best and pushed Zhong Ziya’s strength to the limits, leaving wounds on his body.

However, those wounds weren’t fatal. Furthermore, the chances of him injuring Zhong Ziya decreased.

Zhong Ziya’s pupils had already turned into a strange red color. They were blood-red, evil and crazy. It made Jiuyue panic.

“You shouldn’t have come.” Zhong Ziya was grabbed in front of Jiuyue, but at that moment, Jiuyue didn’t feel any joy from succeeding. Instead, he felt that something was amiss.

Crack!

Zhong Ziya’s neck was snapped by Jiuyue again, but his beheaded body turned into a puppet.

Jiuyue’s pupils constricted. He had actually failed to tell that it was Zhong Ziya’s clone.

Realizing that something was amiss, he wanted to use space to teleport away, but he realized that Zhong Ziya was already behind him. The blood-stained lips were almost touching his ear. “I’ll chop off your head.”

Bam!

Jiuyue felt a huge force behind him as his body involuntarily flew forward.

Jiuyue wanted to extend the distance, but he suddenly realized that his body seemed to be locked in place. He couldn’t extend the space any further. Furthermore, his body had been kicked out from his Terror state.

He felt that he had something on his back, but he couldn’t see it. It was a strange blood-colored curse pattern that was imprinted on his back. It emitted an evil aura.

Jiuyue didn’t have the luxury of time to look at what it was because Zhong Ziya had appeared behind him. He held Primordial Immortal Sword with both hands and slashed at his neck at an unbelievable speed.

As Jiuyue had been kicked out of his Terror form, all the spectators could see this scene.

Boom!

A beam of light flew out of Jiuyue’s body. Although there was still a chance for him to fight to the death, the dimensional creature didn’t wish to risk its life.

Just as Zhong Ziya had said, his true strength wasn’t limited to what had been showcased. His true strength could easily crush Zhong Ziya to death. He didn’t want to risk his life because of Zhong Ziya. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

When the figure of light ascended, it turned around and took a glance. This glance nearly made him vomit blood.

The Primordial Immortal Sword in Zhong Ziya’s hand hung around Jiuyue’s neck. The blade had already reached his skin, but it didn’t slash down.

“This... bastard...” The figure immediately understood.

There was only one possibility for him to hold back his sword and not slash down under such circumstances. Zhong Ziya had never planned on slashing down. Otherwise, with his strength and speed, it would be impossible for him to temporarily hold back his sword. Everything he had done previously was just to scare him.

Under such circumstances, Zhong Ziya actually dared to do such a thing. If he had known that this strike was a feint, the figure would have had a chance of killing Zhong Ziya.

However, not only did Zhong Ziya do it, but the figure had also been frightened. It couldn’t tell the truth behind the strike.

“You’re indeed an idiot,” Zhong Ziya muttered as he looked at the figure that flew into the void. He returned his sword to its scabbard.

The figure suddenly shook in the void before instantly disappearing.

“Haha, this person is really interesting.” Xia Liuchuan laughed until he couldn’t straighten his back.

“This isn’t interesting. He’s risking his life. If that dimensional creature saw that his strike was a feint, he would probably be dead by now,” Dugu Ge said solemnly.

“To dare slash out such a strike under such circumstances, this person is either a lunatic or an idiot,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a strange expression as he looked at Zhong Ziya on stage.

“He doesn’t look like a lunatic,” Dugu Ge said.

“That’s why he’s an idiot,” Xia Liuchuan said.

“Idiot? That’s good,” Zhang Chunqiu said thoughtfully.

In the arena, Jiuyue regained control of his body. He looked at Zhong Ziya with a complicated expression and didn’t say a word. He only cupped his fists and bowed slightly before admitting defeat and leaving the arena.

“Ya... Ya... Ya...” At that moment, many of the humans who were watching the battle shouted Ya’s name, forgetting the fact that Ya only had half a human bloodline.

Ya stood in the arena. Although his body was covered in blood, he left people in awe. None of the Guardians dared to challenge him again.

There were very few Terror-grade Guardians to begin with. There were even fewer who had Ya’s realm and comprehension. Among the Guardians who were willing to fight, no one had the confidence to defeat him.

Suddenly, Ya was ejected from the cube’s arena. At the same time, his name vanished from the cube’s rankings.

Everyone was taken aback before they suddenly understood what had happened. Instantly, the entire Federation and overseas were in an uproar.
