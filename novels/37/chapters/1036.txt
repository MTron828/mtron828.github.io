Chapter 1037: Brazen Extortion

“Surrender? Criminal?” Everyone looked at Zhou Wen and Tang Zhizhong in surprise.

“Old Tang, is this the time for jokes? Everyone is waiting for this sum of money.” The middle-aged man who came first thought that Tang Zhizhong was joking.

Tang Zhizhong grimaced, unsure how he could explain the situation. At this moment, Zhou Wen said to Yu Guang on the city gate, “I did encounter some difficulties. Is your bureau really willing to help me?”

“It’s our duty as the bureau to resolve the problems for federal citizens. If there are any difficulties, feel free to tell us. As long as it’s within the scope of our authority, we will definitely uphold justice for you...” Yu Guang said righteously like an impartial Justice Bao from ancient China.

“Old Tang, that person seems to be Yu Guang, right?” The middle-aged man looked at Yu Guang with uncertainty. He knew Yu Guang, but wasn’t too sure today.

“It’s Yu Guang alright.” Tang Zhizhong nodded.

“But why would Yu Guang...” The middle-aged man was doubtful as his eyes were filled with puzzlement.

“It’s because of him.” Tang Zhizhong looked in Zhou Wen’s direction and whispered to the middle-aged man, “Perhaps they will take receipt of our space suits this time.”

“I’ve been very interested in space suits recently. I want to buy a few space suits to study. Perhaps I can contribute to the Federation’s aeronautical industry. However, as you know, I’m just a poor student. I don’t have much money to begin with, and I’ve always been wanted by your bureau. I don’t have the money to buy space suits...” Zhou Wen said.

“Director-General, what should we do?” Yu Guang realized that Zhou Wen was blatantly extorting them. He had no choice but to seek Shen Yuchi’s advice again.

Shen Yuchi looked at Tang Zhizhong and the others through the surveillance monitor and asked with a frown, “That should be Tang Zhizhong from the Tang Aerospace, right? I remember that he has always been a space-suit supplier for our bureau’s space program. What’s going on with them?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Immediately, a director stood up and said, “Director-General, it’s like this. We recently changed space-suit suppliers, so we have some differences in contract with Tang Aerospace.”

“Tang’s space suits have always been of high quality. Why did we switch suppliers?” Shen Yuchi asked with a frown.

Everyone immediately fell silent. Shen Yuchi pointed at them with his finger, but he didn’t say a word. Finally, he said into the communicator, “You know how to deal with the matter regarding Tang Aerospace, right?”

“I know,” Yu Guang replied. He hurriedly said to Zhou Wen, “It’s our duty to support the development of young talents. The bureau has many advanced space suits. If you are interested in studying them, I can make the decision to give you a few.”

“I heard that Tang Aerospace’s space suits are currently the best and most advanced in the Federation. I’m more interested in theirs,” Zhou Wen added.

“That’s easy. Tang Aerospace is our bureau’s space suit supplier. We just ordered a batch of space suits. If you want them, I can sponsor a few sets for you,” Yu Guang immediately said.

“Are you talking about this batch?” Zhou Wen asked as he pointed at the trucks.

“Yes,” said Yu Guang.

“I heard that there’s a problem with this batch of goods. You haven’t taken receipt of them yet. Could there really be a problem?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

“That’s just a rumor. Tang Aerospace’s space suits have always been of high quality. There’s definitely no problem. We were just about to acknowledge receipt,” Yu Guang said through gritted teeth.

“Then quickly take receipt. You have to check the goods carefully. I don’t want any inferior products,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

Yu Guang had no choice but to send someone to check the goods. The entire process went surprisingly smoothly. In less than ten minutes, the inspection was completed on the spot and the goods were collected.

Tang Zhizhong and the other employees of Tang Aerospace felt like they were dreaming.

After taking receipt, the bureau didn’t dare move the space suits inside the trucks into Sky Pass. They were afraid that Zhou Wen would take the opportunity to rush in when Sky Pass opened.

“There are so many space suits. Are you planning on giving them all for my research? The bureau sure is generous.” Zhou Wen gave a thumbs up before saying to Tang Zhizhong, “These space suits were given to me by the bureau. Please help me send them to this location. Is there a problem?”

“No... No problem...” Tang Zhizhong took the slip of paper with the address written on it and hurriedly ordered the employees to reload the trucks with the space suits.

The bigwigs from the bureau were depressed. That was more than a hundred sets of space suits. They needed to pay a large sum of money for them. Although it wasn’t a huge sum to the bureau, they were still displeased that Zhou Wen had taken them all.

“Mr. Zhou, thank you. Thank you so much.” Tang Zhizhong brought a few company executives over to thank Zhou Wen.

“There’s no need to thank me. They were bought by the bureau. It has nothing to do with me. Just help me deliver them to the place,” Zhou Wen said.

“Mr. Zhou, don’t worry. We promise to deliver them to your requested location. This is my number. If there’s any problem with the space suits in the future, call me at any time. Even if the company closes down, I will provide you with after-sales service.” Tang Zhizhong handed his number to Zhou Wen with both hands.

“Alright, you may leave.” Zhou Wen took the slip of paper with the number written on it and looked at Yu Guang. He had no intention of leaving.

Although the space suits could resolve the problem regarding his survival in space, they could only be used in relatively safe areas. Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if he could teleport to a safe area, so he wanted more.

Helping Tang Zhizhong and the rest was just a matter of convenience. This small price was not enough to settle his grudge with the bureau.

“Actually, I’m also very interested in a space station. I want to study it...” Tang Zhizhong and company’s hands trembled when they heard Zhou Wen’s words.

“Let’s leave quickly and safely deliver the things to Mr. Zhou’s designated location.” Tang Zhizhong jolted the stunned middle-aged man and urged him to drive faster.

The middle-aged man started the truck, but he couldn’t help but glance at Zhou Wen through the rearview mirror. He said with a complicated expression, “Old Tang, that young... Mr. Zhou... Who is he? Even Cold-faced Hades seems to be very afraid of him...”

“It’s not just Cold-faced Hades. I heard that Shen Yuchi is also in Sky Pass and hasn’t stepped out,” Tang Zhizhong said softly.

The middle-aged man’s expression changed again. “Mr. Zhou is so young, but he can already intimidate the bureau. It’s unbelievable...”

Shen Yuchi was at a loss. Zhou Wen was asking for too much. The space station’s equipment required a lot of technology and various materials. In this era, it was very difficult to acquire most of the technology and materials. Constructing a space station could be said to be filled with difficulties.

The bureau didn’t even have many space stations built by themselves, yet Zhou Wen was asking for one.

Suddenly, Shen Yuchi seemed to think of something as his eyes lit up. He said into the communicator, “Bring Zhou Wen in. I want to talk to him.”
