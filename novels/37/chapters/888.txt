Chapter 889: Three Immortal Swords

Translator: CKtalon

I’ll bear with it... I’ll bear with it... The corners of Xu Ai’s eyes twitched as she felt like killing someone.

However, this was the Federation, and Xu Ai had a special mission. She couldn’t expose her identity, so she forcefully resisted the urge to slap Gulli.

“Are you heading back to campus?” Zhou Wen asked Gulli and company.

“Yes, let’s go together.” The few of them returned to school.

Ouyang Lan was well-informed. Zhou Wen had just returned to school when he received a call from her asking him to have dinner with her.

Zhou Wen agreed. It had been a long time since he had seen Zhou Lingfeng and Ouyang Lan. He could take the opportunity to meet them while eating.

He changed Ya’er into new clothes and took her along.

However, when he arrived, Zhou Wen realized that Zhou Lingfeng wasn’t around. Apart from Ouyang Lan, there was a girl who looked to be in her twenties.

The girl was naturally Uesugi Nao, who had impersonated as Xu Ai. She was slightly taken aback when she saw Zhou Wen and Ya’er. Only then did she recognize that Zhou Wen was the fellow who had said that Great Skyfiend was too weak.

“Come, Little Wen, let me introduce you. This is my childhood friend’s daughter, Xu Ai...” Ouyang Lan pulled Zhou Wen to sit beside her.

Ouyang Lan didn’t deliberately make Zhou Wen sit beside Xu Ai because she knew him too well. She knew that Zhou Wen didn’t know how to chat with girls, so he wouldn’t say anything if she made him sit beside Xu Ai.

“Little Ai, this is Ya’er, an orphan that Zhou Wen adopted. Although he looks cold, he’s actually very caring.” Ouyang Lan explained Ya’er’s origins and beautified Zhou Wen.

“Such caring people are rare in such an environment,” Xu Ai said with a smile.

“That’s right. Not only is my Little Wen compassionate, but he’s also talented. He can master anything he picks up...” Ouyang Lan’s praises of Zhou Wen made him blush.

“Zhou Wen, I heard that your cultivation talent is extremely high. Even the peers of the six families are far inferior to you. I wonder if you can teach me?” Xu Ai said to Zhou Wen with a smile.

“I don’t...” Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Ouyang Lan interrupted him.

When Ouyang Lan heard Zhou Wen’s opening, she knew that he wanted to say that he didn’t have the time. She knew Zhou Wen too well, so she didn’t hesitate to say, “It’s still early. After dinner, you young adults can head out for a walk. If you have any cultivation questions, feel free to ask Little Wen. He’s an absolute genius in this aspect.”

Ouyang Lan thought to herself that it wasn’t easy to find a girl that wasn’t frightened away by Zhou Wen and was willing to understand him. She felt that she couldn’t let go of this opportunity.

She was really worried that with Zhou Wen’s personality, he wouldn’t be able to find a wife in the future.

“Ya’er, can the beautiful Sis Lan take you out to play?” After the meal, Ouyang Lan wanted to take Ya’er away to prevent Ya’er from interfering with their interaction.

Ya’er turned her head and leaned her face on Zhou Wen’s shoulder, completely ignoring Ouyang Lan.

“It’s fine, Sis Lan. I’ll take her. She’s afraid of strangers,” Zhou Wen said.

“You’ll spoil her like this.” Ouyang Lan was helpless. Although she had a sharp tongue, she couldn’t bear to forcefully take Ya’er away. All she could do was let Ya’er follow Zhou Wen.

“Sis Lan, I like children too. I’ll take care of her. Don’t worry,” Xu Ai said.

“Then I’m relieved.” Ouyang Lan couldn’t help but praise Xu Ai for being sensible.

Zhou Wen and Xu Ai left the restaurant together. Seeing that Zhou Wen wasn’t speaking, Xu Ai took the initiative to say, “Zhou Wen, I have some questions regarding cultivation that I would like to ask you. Is it convenient to go to the training grounds?”

“Sure.” Zhou Wen saw that it was still early. Furthermore, Ouyang Lan had already agreed for him to help. It wouldn’t be appropriate for him to leave, so he nodded.

Seeing Zhou Wen agree, a crafty glint flashed in Xu Ai’s eyes as she thought to herself, I’ll let you know today what it means by there’s always someone better. Let’s see if you dare be arrogant in the future. You actually dare say that Great Skyfiend is too weak. I’ll let you know who’s too weak later.

The reason she had taken the initiative to ask Zhou Wen out was naturally not to build a good relationship with him.

The target of Uesugi Nao’s visit wasn’t Zhou Wen, but the An family’s weapon factory and the new Essence Energy weapons the An family researched. These had nothing to do with Zhou Wen, so she didn’t need to deliberately approach him.

If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s evaluation of Great Skyfiend and Gulli’s words in front of the cube, she would probably have politely eaten with Zhou Wen and never taken the initiative to ask him out again in the future.

Zhou Wen’s thoughts were even simpler. He wasn’t interested in Xu Ai. Furthermore, there was still the problem of the alchemist that hadn’t been resolved. He wasn’t in the mood to think about anything else.

If it wasn’t for Sis Lan, Zhou Wen would have returned to grind dungeons.

The two of them had their own thoughts and soon, they arrived at a nearby training ground.

Xu Ai didn’t want anyone to see them, so she paid for a private training room. Soon, the staff took them in.

“What do you need me to teach you?” Zhou Wen asked Xu Ai.

These words sounded awkward to Xu Ai’s ears. She thought to herself, You really think too highly of yourself. If you want to teach me, teach me in your next life. In a while, you will know who’s teaching who.

Xu Ai’s thoughts didn’t show on her face. She looked at Zhou Wen with a smile and said, “Do you know sword techniques? I’ve been practicing a sword technique recently, but no matter how much I practice, I can’t grasp the key point. I want you to help me see what’s wrong.”

“A little. How about this? Demonstrate the sword technique for me first. I’ll try to see if I can find the problem,” Zhou Wen said seriously.

He didn’t know that Xu Ai had other intentions and thought that she really wanted to seek his help. He felt that it was fine to help her. After all, she was the daughter of Sister Lan’s childhood friend.

“Alright, I’ll demonstrate it first. Help me take a look. If there’s anything wrong, just say. There’s no need to worry.” After Xu Ai said that, she took a sword from the rack and stood in the middle of the training grounds.

She naturally wouldn’t let Zhou Wen guide her in her sword practice. Not only was the sword technique she demonstrated without a problem, but it was also very profound.

This sword technique was named “Three Immortal Swords.” It was obtained by Uesugi Nao in a mysterious dimensional zone overseas. She was the only person in the world who knew the Three Immortal Swords. Furthermore, she had never displayed it to outsiders before.

Now that she was demonstrating the Three Immortal Swords, the practice sword in her hand drew a profound trajectory. It looked like a casual move, but in fact, it was very profound.

Back when Uesugi Nao practiced the Three Immortal Swords herself, she had put in a lot of hard work. After a year of arduous cultivation, she had finally mastered the Three Immortal Swords and comprehended the sword intent of the Three Immortal Swords.
