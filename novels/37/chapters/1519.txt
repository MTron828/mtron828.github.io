Chapter 1520 Let’s Do It Here

The feeling Berserker Immortal gave Zhou Wen was like an upgraded version of Zhong Ziya. He was equally crazy and domineering. Although the sword arts were different, the feeling they exuded when using swords was very similar.

Their usage of swords was different from ordinary people’s. If one drew the analogy of using swords to driving, the first reaction of ordinary people when they saw a situation ahead would be to slow down; however, they would choose to accelerate and rush over before the route was sealed.

If one’s judgment was accurate and fast enough, they could pass through. However, if one made a mistake or if one’s speed wasn’t fast enough, they would die.

However, Berserker Immortal was an extremely experienced veteran. In a harrowing battle, he could rush over before Zhou Wen could seal off the area. This threw Zhou Wen into an extreme disadvantage.

On the one hand, Zhou Wen’s speed wasn’t as fast as Berserker Immortal’s. On the other hand, the Golden Wyrm Scissors wasn’t a real sword to begin with. Its body was a little too big, so it wasn’t suitable during a speed competition.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s instant transmission was already very powerful with the augmentation of The Disqualified. Coupled with his movement technique and The Disqualified’s ability to automatically sense the enemy’s weakness, it wasn’t easy for Berserker Immortal to defeat Zhou Wen with his sword art.

Berserker Immortal was equally surprised. As the dignified Berserker Immortal, a Heaven-level sword expert who had once defeated an Apocalypse-grade existence, he still found it difficult to truly suppress Zhou Wen despite his advantage in Strength and Speed. Zhou Wen’s Sword Dao and combat strength far exceeded his expectations.

A Terror-grade human can actually cultivate a Sword Dao to such a level. How many humans like him are there on Earth? Berserker Immortal was somewhat worried.

In the past, humans were limited by their inherent flaws. After so many years, their growth remained highly restricted. Now, not long after they broke through the restrictions, many experts like Human Sovereign, Wang Mingyuan, and Zhou Wen had already appeared.

If humans were allowed to continue growing like this, even if the boundary between Earth and the dimension was broken one day, and the dimensional creatures would no longer be suppressed by the cosmic rules of Earth, it would still be a question if they could suppress humanity.

I have to establish a human faction on Earth that can control everything as soon as possible. I need to control humanity. The Sword of Blood in Berserker Immortal’s hand became more and more violent.

Zhou Wen could clearly see the sword stab over, but when he used the Golden Wyrm Scissors to block, it would slow down every time, preventing him from touching Berserker Immortal’s sword.

Even the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation around him couldn’t completely block the Sword of Blood. More and more wounds appeared on Zhou Wen’s body.

“Didn’t you want to kill me? Come on? How can you kill me if you keep retreating? Attack!” Berserker Immortal mocked as he attacked.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he continued fighting Berserker Immortal. Although his injuries increased, he didn’t use any other Companion Beasts.

Using a Companion Beast could indeed give Zhou Wen a breather, but it couldn’t help him clinch victory. If he only wanted to survive, Zhou Wen could teleport away immediately, but this wasn’t what he wanted.

The Disqualified needed a large amount of information to carry out its inference. Every time Zhou Wen was injured, the Disqualified would gain a deeper understanding of Berserker Immortal, allowing him to deduce more weaknesses. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t know Berserker Immortal’s weakness, but Berserker Immortal had cultivated a sword art to its limits. He used one advantage to mask all his weaknesses.

Although Zhou Wen knew that Berserker Immortal had many weaknesses, he couldn’t even protect himself under such an onslaught. He had no chance of exploiting those weaknesses.

Even if he’s really an immortal and really doesn’t make mistakes, it’s impossible for him to use one advantage to deal with all the problems. Zhou Wen knew that all he needed to do was continue enduring. As long as The Disqualified obtained enough information, it would definitely be able to analyze his opponent’s weakness.

Berserker Immortal had the constant belief of suppressing Zhou Wen and making him suffer a mental breakdown. However, despite his injuries increasing, Zhou Wen didn’t show any signs of panic.

From the looks of it, it’s impossible to make him yield just by injuring him. Then, I can only let him sample the taste of death. When Berserker Immortal saw that Zhou Wen had no intention of surrendering, he brandished the Sword of Blood in his hand again. It transformed into sword beams that filled the sky as they attacked from all directions.

The terrifying sword beam instantly dyed the nearby void red. The area within Zhou Wen’s instant transmission range was filled with sword beams. Apart from blocking, there was no other way.

With a thought, Zhou Wen used instant transmission again. However, this time, he instant transmitted in the direction of Dubhe.

The Dubhe was massive, far bigger than Earth. The last time Zhou Wen searched Dubhe, he could only use interstellar teleportation to head to different locations around Dubhe. After a general search, he couldn’t even figure out where the dimensional zone was on Dubhe.

However, after seeing the scene of the Tyrannosaurus clearing the level, Zhou Wen knew that as long as he didn’t open the door to the palace, there shouldn’t be much danger. He would be fine even if he encountered Dubhe’s dimensional zone.

The moment he instant transmitted into Dubhe, Zhou Wen felt the terrifyingly high temperature, radiation, and shockwaves. All sorts of energy erupted. Even his body had trouble withstanding them. He was still on Dubhe’s surface and had yet to venture too deep.

The Ancient Sovereign Sutra erupted without any reservations as Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens was activated. Although this domain didn’t heal Zhou Wen, it could greatly enhance his physique, making him comparable to a Human Realm creature.

Without any hesitation, Berserker Immortal charged in with the sword beams that resembled a river of blood. The flames outside Dubhe were washed away by the sword beams as high-temperature liquid splattered everywhere.

Zhou Wen realized that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was augmented to a certain extent in such a high-temperature environment. After the Human Sovereign Life Soul in his body was augmented, the light intensified and his vitality became stronger.

Zhou Wen didn’t summon the Human Sovereign Life Soul, nor did he fuse with it. In that case, anyone could easily tell that he was Human Sovereign.

Even without summoning it, the augmentation of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra had already strengthened Zhou Wen’s vitality His physique had clearly become stronger.

Instead, Berserker Immortal was clearly affected by Dubhe’s high temperature. Although the effects weren’t too great, the time the sword beams tore through the high-temperature liquid gave Zhou Wen a chance.

Zhou Wen turned around and continued charging into Dubhe. The high temperature of Dubhe not only augmented his Ancient Sovereign Sutra, but it also tempered the Golden Wyrm Scissors, making it stronger.

Berserker Immortal pursued relentlessly as his sword beams tore through the high-temperature liquid and constantly struck Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen brandished the resplendent Golden Wyrm Scissors and shattered the blood sword beams that surged behind him. None of the sword beams came close to him.

Before long, the blood sword beams formed a circle again, trapping Zhou Wen in the sword beams that filled the sky.

“Let’s do it here,” Zhou Wen suddenly stopped and said to Berserker Immortal.
