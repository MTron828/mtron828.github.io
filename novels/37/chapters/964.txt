Chapter 965: Miya

“Miya,” the dragon queen answered.

“Miya, taking Qin Ling away actually isn’t a good idea. The dimensional zones will definitely be lifted in the future. When the time comes, will the Seven Seas Dragon King let her off? I’m afraid the hatred will only deepen when the time comes. If she’s caught, it will be even worse. The only solution is to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King. Only then can you and your sister obtain true liberation,” Zhou Wen said with a sincere expression. “We can first deal with the Seven Seas Dragon King. Can you tell me what kind of dimensional creature the Seven Seas Dragon King is?”

“Unless I can advance to the Terror grade, there’s no hope.” Although Miya said that, she still informed Zhou Wen about the situation with the Seven Seas Dragon King.

As Miya’s father had once risked his life against the Seven Seas Dragon King, Miya had personally witnessed the battle. She knew the abilities of the Seven Seas Dragon King quite well.

However, even Miya didn’t understand some of the abilities used by the Seven Seas Dragon King. Therefore, when she explained them, some of them were just in narrative form.

According to Miya, the Seven Seas Dragon King didn’t seem to be a divine dragon in the traditional sense. It had seven dragon heads and its body was huge. Every dragon head had unparalleled strength.

Furthermore, as long as one was grabbed by the Seven Seas Dragon King, it would be difficult for them to escape.

Back then, Miya’s father’s combat strength was extremely high. With the accolade as Golden Dragon King, he was a top-notch existence in the Seven Dragon Seas thanks to having the strongest combat strength. The Golden Dragon Body was almost immortal.

However, after being grabbed by the Seven Seas Dragon King, the Golden Dragon Body was unable to withstand the terrifying power. In the end, Miya watched as her father’s Golden Dragon Body was devoured by the Seven Seas Dragon King.

“Does every dragon head of the Seven Sea Dragon King have different attributes? For example, wind, fire, thunder, lightning, etc?” Zhou Wen thought of Orochi he had seen before.

“No. The powers of the seven dragon heads are the same. They can spew out a terrifying liquid. Once one is touched by the liquid, their bodies will become immobile. Their only fate is to wait to be slaughtered,” said Miya. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What’s its Terror form?” Zhou Wen asked in detail.

“I didn’t see it. When it used the Terror form, the sea produced huge waves. All I could see were terrifying dragons tumbling in the waves. I couldn’t see its full appearance,” Miya answered.

“From what you said, if you are willing to join forces with me, we might have a chance of killing the Seven Seas Dragon King. If you can contact the other six dragon monarchs and get their help, the chances are even higher,” Zhou Wen said.

“You can’t even defeat me. What makes you think you can kill the Seven Seas Dragon King?” Although Miya still retorted, she didn’t say that Zhou Wen was delusional for some reason.

“Who said I’m not your match? I’m just unwilling to use my true strength to harm you,” Zhou Wen said.

Miya looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Then show me your true strength. Unless you really have the strength to convince me, I definitely won’t let Qin Ling take such a risk.”

Zhou Wen knew that Miya’s combat strength was powerful. Her Strength and Constitution seemed to be in no way inferior to Tyrant Behemoth. It wouldn’t be easy to defeat her.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen was known as the man with the most Companion Beasts and they were also of the highest quality on Earth.

Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth who landed in front of Miya. He looked at Miya and asked, “Do you know what this is?”

“Tyrant Behemoth. I’ve seen it on the rankings. So its owner is you.” Miya was slightly surprised. She never expected Zhou Wen to have a powerful Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth.

However, although Tyrant Behemoth was powerful, Miya didn’t believe that she was inferior to Tyrant Behemoth. Even if Zhou Wen was Tyrant Behemoth’s master, he definitely didn’t have the ability to challenge the Seven Seas Dragon King. Even she and Turtle Minister couldn’t.

“Do you believe me now?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Although Tyrant Behemoth is strong, it might not be able to defeat me,” said Miya.

“Then, what if we add on these?” Zhou Wen began summoning his Companion Beasts. He summoned the three Demon Blood True Dragons, Light Concealment Sword, and Deep Blue Crab Sovereign.

When Miya saw that Zhou Wen had so many Mythical Companion Beasts, she couldn’t help but be alarmed. She began to believe Zhou Wen’s words.

“No matter how many ordinary Mythical Companion Beasts there are, it’s impossible for them to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King. The Terror grade is an existence on a different level. It’s not something that can be defeated with numbers alone,” said Miya.

“It’s not just quantity. There’s also quality.” Zhou Wen summoned Torch Dragon.

“Torch Dragon!” Miya recognized Torch Dragon at a glance.

Dragons were probably dimensional creatures with the most branches. There were almost countless dragon-type creatures. Some dragons weren’t very strong, and they couldn’t even reach the Mythical stage.

However, some dragons were terrifyingly strong and could even fight Calamity-grade existences.

Torch Dragon was undoubtedly one of the most terrifying existences among dragon-type creatures. As a dragon, Miya naturally recognized it.

“Unfortunately, it’s still a youngling. If it can reach adulthood and transform into its Terror form, it might really be able to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King,” said Miya in disappointment after carefully observing Torch Dragon.

“Even if it’s still young, it’s still Torch Dragon. Its Bright Torch Vision World should still be of some use against the Seven Seas Dragon King. Furthermore, we don’t need to fight it head-on. As long as you tell me the details of the Seven Seas Dragon King, I can think of a way to assassinate it without it transforming into its Terror form...” Zhou Wen continued persuading Miya.

“It’s too dangerous. There’s almost no chance of success,” said Miya after some thought.

“As long as you believe me, we can think of a solution. I’ll rescue you and your sister from the sea of bitterness...” Zhou Wen knew that it wouldn’t be easy to make Miya believe him.

After all, they were facing the Terror-grade Seven Seas Dragon King. However, Zhou Wen needed Miya’s help, so he could only patiently win her trust.

“What do you want to do?” Miya asked after some hesitation.

“Do you think we can convince the other six dragon monarchs?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Absolutely impossible,” answered Miya with certainty.

“Why? Aren’t they also oppressed by Seven Seas Dragon Kings? Don’t they want to resist?” Zhou Wen said in disbelief.

“That’s if you have the ability to resist. Other than me, the other dragon monarchs won’t risk their lives to resist,” Miya said with certainty.

“In that case, tell me the situation of the other six dragon monarchs and their dimensional zones. Perhaps I can think of a solution.” Zhou Wen wanted to obtain as much information as possible.

Miya explained the situation in the Seven Dragon Seas in detail to Zhou Wen, making him sigh at how good it felt to have a spy providing information. He didn’t need to go anywhere to understand the situation in the Seven Dragon Seas clearly.
