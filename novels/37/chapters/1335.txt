Chapter 1336: Entering the Forbidden City Again

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen dodged to the side. Without looking to see if Sweetie had fallen, he turned around and instant transmitted.

Do you think I’m a fool? I’ve always been in my Terror form. Ordinary people can’t see me at all. Besides, there are Calamity-grade bullets spinning around me. Not only can this girl see me, but she can even pass through the bullets and fall towards me. How can such a person slip? Are you kidding me??Zhou Wen carried Ya’er and instant transmitted away with Chick on his shoulder.

The antelope wasn’t slow either. It ran immediately, so fast that its shadow couldn’t be seen. It was in no way slower than Zhou Wen’s instant transmission.

The two of them unanimously ran in the same direction, towards Forbidden City.

Clearly, they all believed that Sweetie’s strength was extremely terrifying. If they were to try to escape normally, there was a high chance they wouldn’t make it. If they fled to the Forbidden City, they might be able to pit the enemy against another and obtain a chance to catch their breath. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Sweetie was still in a daze. She thought that a normal person would definitely help her up, but in her eyes, something normal was not normal at all.

Normal people couldn’t see Zhou Wen, much less pass through the bullet halo. To Sweetie, this couldn’t be any more normal.

Bam!?Sweetie fell to the ground and watched in a daze as Zhou Wen and the antelope vanished. After a while, she got up hatefully. He’s indeed a bad person. He didn’t even help me up.

This made Sweetie even more determined to avenge Yana. After sensing Zhou Wen’s location, Sweetie chased after him.

When Zhou Wen reached Forbidden City with instant transmission, he realized that the antelope had already arrived. It was even faster than him.

“She didn’t chase after us?” Zhou Wen asked when he saw the antelope standing outside Forbidden City without entering. It didn’t look flustered.

“Probably not. I didn’t sense her following us,” the antelope said firmly. Clearly, it was very confident in its senses.

“Could that girl be the culprit who has turned humans into gold?” Zhou Wen guessed.

“Maybe. Anyway, she’s not simple. Even I can’t see through her. She’s definitely at the Calamity grade.” The antelope looked around but didn’t find any traces of Sweetie.

“Let’s enter the city now. Even if she catches up, she will suffer limitations inside,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards the entrance of Forbidden City.

“Don’t take the main entrance. Follow me.” The antelope stopped Zhou Wen and headed in another direction along the city walls.

They walked in front while Sweetie followed not far behind them. However, Zhou Wen and the antelope didn’t see her. It was as though she was invisible.

What are the two of them sneaking around for??Sweetie walked to Zhou Wen’s side. She originally wanted to push him and turn him into gold, but when she saw the two of them sneaking around, her curiosity was piqued. She retracted her hand.

Sweetie squatted by the side and watched the antelope and Zhou Wen crawl through a dog hole. She thought to herself,?What are they trying to do?

Zhou Wen had tried his best to be careful when he crawled in, but the dog hole was just too small. A portion of the wall’s bricks shattered as a result of the bullets around him.

Fortunately, after they crawled in, it was an empty courtyard. Other than some plants, there were no other living creatures.

That blonde girl shouldn’t have caught up.?Zhou Wen lay prone in the grass and used Truth Listener to listen. Having not discovered any traces of the blonde girl in the vicinity, he felt slightly relieved.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t know that Sweetie was crouched beside him. She was less than a foot away from him and could reach out to touch his hair.

“It doesn’t seem like she was coming for us. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have given up so easily.” The antelope lay in the grass and looked around. It didn’t notice Sweetie and spat on the ground. It cursed, “Nothing good comes from following you out.”

Sweetie crouched there and listened in on their conversation with great interest.

“How do you know that the girl was coming for me? Perhaps she was coming for you,” Zhou Wen said with a pout.

“Pui! I haven’t been out and about for millennia, but the moment I did, I encountered you, an unlucky piece of trash. How could I possibly have the opportunity to offend such a powerful enemy?” The antelope said in a very displeased manner.

“Let’s not talk about that for now. After all, she didn’t chase after us. Let’s stick to the plan and deal with Starlady Polestar first,” Zhou Wen suggested.

“Alright, let’s act according to the plan. We mustn’t make any mistakes. Otherwise, both of us will suffer greatly. The current Starlady Polestar is nothing like last time when she just freed herself,” the antelope exhorted again.

“Don’t worry. I know what to do.” Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan his surroundings.

Truth Listener received too much sound information. Zhou Wen still couldn’t analyze what all the sounds were, but he could accurately pinpoint a portion of the sounds he wanted to hear. It was much better than before.

Soon, Zhou Wen heard everything around him.

Forbidden City was indeed very different from before. Although its layout still followed the Eight-Arm Nezha’s setup, there were many independent dimensional zones in the city now.

The situation was roughly similar to Dragon Gate Grotto. They were both large dimensional zones that contained many smaller dimensional zones.

Thankfully, Truth Listener’s strength had improved greatly. Otherwise, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t have been able to hear the situation outside the courtyard because it was a dimensional zone.

“Strange, what is this place? There’s not a single dimensional creature. Why is this area only a small independent dimensional zone?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he glanced at the dog hole they had crawled through and continued, “Furthermore, why would a dog hole exist in Forbidden City, which has already transformed into a dimensional zone?”

“Don’t be surprised. The dog hole was a part of Forbidden City, so of course it can exist. As for this place, you should have seen the map of Forbidden City before, right? Don’t you know that this is the legendary Cold Palace?” the antelope said.

Cold Palace!?Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

Of course, he had heard of the Cold Palace. It was the place where the emperor banished concubines who had committed crimes. However, it was empty here and there were no concubines.

“If it weren’t for the fact that the Cold Palace is isolated from other areas, we would have long been discovered by Starlady Polestar after causing such a huge commotion here. This is one of the few places where Starlady Polestar won’t pay attention to. However, we have to move quickly. If she has a sudden impulse to look over here, we’ll be in trouble,” the antelope said as it slammed its head into the door of the Cold Palace. After shattering the door, it ran out.

The dimensional creatures outside were immediately attracted by it and chased after the antelope.

As per the agreement, Zhou Wen waited for the antelope to lure the dimensional creatures away and cause chaos before sneaking in another direction.

Sweetie looked in the direction the antelope left in, then at Zhou Wen, before walking towards him.
