Chapter 1738 The Cube Starts Again

On the Cube’s screen was a lake enveloped in fog. At a glance, it was only a foggy lake. Although there was no end in sight, it made one feel that it was a lake and not an ocean.

It was impossible to tell what place it was just from the scene. There were countless rivers and lakes on Earth. Just from this scene, it was impossible to guess where it was.

People were discussing what it was. The analysts of the various programs had all sorts of guesses, but no one could say with certainty what it was.

Zhou Wen came out of the Cube and immediately saw the scene on it. His pupils constricted.

“Old Zhou, the Cube is here to provide you warmth again. From the looks of it, it’s time for you to reap some benefits again,” Li Xuan said with a smile as he looked at the scene on the Cube.

“I’m afraid it won’t be that simple this time.” Zhou Wen’s expression was solemn.

“What do you mean? Is there anyone on Earth who can snatch first place from you?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.

“No one on Earth can snatch it from me, but I’m afraid this isn’t just limited to humans on Earth.” Zhou Wen stared at the Cube’s screen without blinking.

“You mean…” Li Xuan seemed to guess something as his expression turned odd. He looked at the scene on the Cube and said,” Don’t tell me you want to say that the dimensional zone on the Cube is the dimension?”

“I’ve been to the dimension once. It does look like it. Call Ming Xiu over,” Zhou Wen said.

Li Xuan hurriedly gave Ming Xiu a call and got him over. Without waiting for Li Xuan to ask, Ming Xiu said, “I saw it on the livestream. The place where the Cube is might very well be in the dimension.”

“What do you mean ‘might very well be?”” Li Xuan asked.

“Previously, when I went to the dimension, the place I went was limited to the Inter race’s territory. I’ve never been to places outside the Inter race. The place on the screen is completely different from the Inter race’s territory, but there’s one place that’s very similar,” Ming Xiu said.

“What’s similar?” Li Xuan looked around, but he couldn’t tell what was different between the lake on the screen and a lake on Earth. It was just a little misty.

Ming Xiu explained, “The dimension’s space is different from our space. It’s impossible for creatures below the Mythical stage to see the matter around them, much less move. It’s just like how three-dimensional creatures can’t understand the four-dimensional world…”

“Then it’s even more impossible for it to be the dimension. This scene has been broadcast for quite some time. Everyone on the Internet can see this lake. Even children without cultivation can see it,” Li Xuan said. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“You can’t see it because your level in life isn’t high enough. In essence, it’s also a manifestation of order and rules. As I’ve been to the dimension, I can sense similar order and rules above the misty lake. The reason why ordinary people can see it is because the existence of the Cube has modified the transmission scene to a certain extent. If one really goes there, ordinary people can only see the distorted dazzling light. No, I’m afraid they won’t even be able to see the dazzling light and will be killed…” Ming Xiu explained.

“Is that so?” Li Xuan had never been to the dimension, so he didn’t know if what Ming Xiu said was true.

“If Ming Xiu thinks so too, then there’s likely no mistake about it.” Zhou Wen nodded as many thoughts flashed through his mind.

“Heavens, if that’s really the dimension, doesn’t that mean that we can storm into the dimension through the Cube?” Li Xuan’s eyes lit up.

“In theory, yes. But have you thought about why the Cube can show the dimension?” Ming Xiu asked.

“Isn’t that simple? It means that the Cube is resourceful. It can even connect to the dimension,” Li Xuan said.

Ming Xiu shook his head and smiled bitterly. “Can’t you think deeper?”.

“Speak your mind and spout your nonsense. Are you itching for a beating again? Stop leaving me hanging?” Li Xuan snorted coldly.

“What if the dimension is just a dimensional zone?” Ming Xiu asked.

Li Xuan was taken aback when he heard that. His expression turned nasty as he said after a while, “That’s impossible, right?”.

“The possibility isn’t high, but what if it is?” Ming Xiu said with a bitter smile, “Even if it isn’t, this dimensional zone is in the dimension. In other words, there’s no suppression of Earth’s cosmic rules there. If those dimensional creatures can enter, do you think we humans will still have a chance of getting first on the Cube’s rankings?”

Ming Xiu, who had been to the dimension, knew better than Li Xuan how terrifying the dimension was. Human Sovereign was already considered very strong on Earth, but in the dimension, lifeforms below the Apocalypse grade weren’t considered powerhouses.

“I was just thinking about how to use this thing to counterattack the dimension, but I forgot about that,” Li Xuan said gloomily. “I don’t think the Cube will do that. If those sick fellows from the dimension can also be on the rankings, there’s no point in humans participating.” “No, those creatures from the dimension will definitely be able to get on the rankings.” Zhou Wen sighed and said, “Didn’t the dimension control the Cube in the past? Although I can tell that they can’t really control the Cube, I’m certain that they can enter the Cube. They just can’t adapt to the rules of Earth’s universe.”

“There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s something from the dimension to begin with. At most, we’ll give it to them. We’ll just storm over when we have the strength in the future,” Li Xuan said after some thought.

“I’m afraid this matter isn’t that simple. I have a nagging feeling that there’s something amiss, but I can’t figure it out immediately,” Zhou Wen said with a frown.

It wasn’t just Zhou Wen. The factions with representatives also realized how unusual this dimensional zone was. They were alarmed and puzzled as they guessed what it meant.

As everyone discussed, the Cube’s screen suddenly changed. Someone had activated the Cube’s challenge.

“Someone challenged the Cube so quickly? I wonder who it is?”

“It’s Human Sovereign? Mohe or Karoman?”

“There are so many people who are willing to take the risk. We don’t even know what dimensional zone this is, but someone has actually attempted it.”

The average man on the street discussed spiritedly, but people who really knew what kind of dimensional zone it was were filled with worry.

When the challenger appeared on the screen, the expressions of many human powerhouses changed.

With gold armor and a dark-gold staff, a lifeform that looked almost no different from humans other than being more than twice as tall as humans-standing at four to five meters tall at the very least-appeared.

On the forehead of the lifeform was a third eye. When it opened, it was like a golden sun, very similar to the Sun Sage God engraved in the Sun God Holy Temple.
