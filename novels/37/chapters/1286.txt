Chapter 1287: Blocking the Bullet

“Although it’s said that throwing lives at the seventh shot can effectively mitigate it, not any random life can mitigate the offensive power of a Calamity-grade bullet. Even a Terror-grade life might not be able to meet the requirement. The power of a bullet will definitely not dissipate after a typical Terror-grade is killed. It still needs some special Terror-grade creature to fill this hole. From their abilities, Ox Demon should be the most suitable person to fill this hole,” said Blood Shaman.

“Ox Demon is part of the backbone of the Holy Spirit Association. To sacrifice Ox Demon for a ranking seems unlikely, right?” Cave Era said.

“It’s not impossible. The thing in the Venusian dimensional zone isn’t merely something Ox Demon can compare with,” said Blood Shaman.

Bang!

As they spoke, the seventh gunshot sounded. Everyone jolted and hurriedly looked at Ya and the others, wanting to know what the outcome would be. Who would block this shot with their lives?

When things turned clear for everyone, they realized that Ox Demon had appeared in front of Ya at some point in time. This outcome wasn’t unexpected.

No matter how one looked at it, Ox Demon seemed to be the best person to block the shot. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, when people took a closer look, they couldn’t help but be alarmed. It was true that Ox Demon was standing in front of Ya, but he wasn’t hit by the seventh bullet. His body was completely unharmed.

And in front of Ox Demon, there was another creature.

The creature looked like a Guardian. It had a majestic body and was wearing resplendent heavy armor. Its limbs and body were chained, but one could no longer identify it since its head had been shattered by the bullet.

“That’s… Giant Armor God…” Cave Era stood up immediately and stared angrily at the screen. Her eyes nearly spewed out flames.

Giant Armor God was a rather important member of the League of Guardians. Unlike the Guardians that were sent through the Skysplit Tower, Giant Armor God was a Guardian that grew up on Earth. He was one of the few elites that could advance to the Terror grade. His status in the League of Guardians was second only to the four Heavenly Kings.

Even though his head had exploded, Cave Era still recognized Giant Armor God at a glance. The armor and powerful physique were not something ordinary people could imitate.

“Those bastards from the Holy Spirit Association!” Hermit’s eyes flashed with a cold glint. The Giant Armor God had always been in charge of the League of Guardians’ fieldwork. It had only been two to three days since he left the headquarters, but he had been captured by the Holy Spirit Association and used as a shield.

The Giant Armor God’s physique and defense weren’t inferior to Ox Demon’s. Although its overall strength wasn’t as strong as Ox Demon, it wasn’t that much weaker. Using him as a shield successfully nullified the seventh sure-kill bullet.

Ox Demon grabbed the Giant Armor God’s corpse with both hands and threw it to the side. Ya, Peacock Fairy, and company continued rushing towards the Golden Palace.

Another gunshot sounded. The might of the next bullet returned to the level of the first six shots. It was blocked by Ya’s Primordial Immortal Sword again.

As everyone charged in, they fended off the bullets. However, they were still a long way from the Golden Palace. The sixth shot of the second round was fired, spelling the dawn of the sure-kill seventh shot.

Giant Armor God was dead. Without any vitality or strength, it was impossible for him to block another shot even if his corpse was still around.

Without the Giant Armor God, who could withstand the seventh shot?

Everyone was guessing if the Holy Spirit Association had captured other Guardians or who would be used as a shield.

It wasn’t easy to find a powerful Guardian like the Giant Armor God. It was even harder to capture it. It was difficult to believe that the Holy Spirit Association could capture a second one.

The Golden Palace’s door was already in sight. It seemed a pity to give up now.

This concerned the ownership of the Venusian Companion Beast. No one would give up at this moment.

As long as they blocked the shot again, they could arrive in front of the Golden Palace. And among them, there was Ox Demon who could block the shot. His physique and abilities weren’t weaker than Giant Armor God and were perhaps even stronger. Since Giant Armor God could withstand the shot, Ox Demon could likely do the same.

Using an Ox Demon’s life to exchange for a chance of obtaining the Venusian Companion Beast seemed to be their only choice.

Ox Demon gritted his teeth and rushed in front of Ya again. He roared, “President, I’ll pave the way for you. I’ll use my life to exchange for the Holy Spirit Association’s chance to become the ruler of Earth. It’s worth it.”

“Without the people, what fun is there in ruling this world?” Ya said indifferently. He pressed his palm on Ox Demon’s shoulder and leaped up. He flew over Ox Demon’s head and, like an immortal riding a sword, transformed into a long beam that shot towards the Golden Palace’s door.

“No way. Although this speed is fast, it’s not as fast as the Calamity-grade bullet!”

“Just now, he used the power of Fairy Peacock and True Martial to block the first six bullets. Now, without the augmentation of Fairy Peacock and True Martial’s powers, he won’t be able to block ordinary Calamity-grade bullets, much less the seventh shot, right?”

“Although it’s very stupid and naive, I like such a person.”

“As expected of Ya. That man who fought the dimension alone. If he hadn’t been forcefully kicked out of the competition, Ya might have been able to obtain first place without Human Sovereign taking action.”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. Some were disdainful, some were contemptuous, and some were admirers. There were all sorts of emotions.

Zhou Wen’s heart was in his throat. He could naturally tell that Ya’s speed couldn’t allow him to reach the Golden Palace before the seventh shot hit him.

Even if he wanted to rush to Venus to save him, it was already too late.

After all, his teleportation skill wasn’t precise enough to teleport him directly into the Venusian dimensional zone.

Bang!

The sure-kill seventh shot sounded again, and Ya’s figure was at least a hundred meters away from the Golden Palace. This hundred meters was like an untraversable chasm.

Blocking the shot is impossible.

You have to survive!

Kill him!

Different people roared different thoughts in their hearts, hoping for different results.

Everyone’s attention was focused on Ya. Seeing Ya’s figure rapidly fall, the hearts of his supporters sank.

As for Ya’s head, it exploded. Even his body exploded.

Just as some people were overjoyed and some were sad and disappointed, they suddenly saw Ya’s figure appear in front of the Golden Palace’s door. He stood in front of the Golden Palace gates and casually held the Primordial Immortal Sword over his shoulder. The white trench coat imprinted with a black ‘Ya’ swayed with the shockwave as his long hair danced.

There weren’t many times when a man could be described as beautiful, but the present Ya was not only beautiful, but had a sort of wildness to him.

His wild and evil beauty was like a famous saber. It was beautiful and artistic, but it also made one unable to control their fear.

The Golden Palace’s door opened and a metal ball landed in Ya’s hand. The scene in the Cube also changed to a ranking. Ya’s name was shockingly on it.
