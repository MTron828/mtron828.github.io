Chapter 1447: Rubik’s Cube

Zhou Wen had the urge to sacrifice everything for the woman, even if it meant sacrificing his life.

Thankfully, his willpower was strong to begin with. He immediately sensed that something was amiss and focused his mind to sever his thoughts, preventing himself from succumbing to temptation.

Zhou Wen could clearly sense that Pandora’s allure came from her fragrance, eyes, and beauty. It was also a special skill.

Even with Zhou Wen’s willpower, he felt immense pressure. He had to focus to control his mind. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Thinking of Li Xuan still beside him, Zhou Wen thought to himself,?Li Xuan is such a lecher. I hope he doesn’t get attracted to Pandora.

Zhou Wen was somewhat worried as he turned to look at Li Xuan, but was greatly surprised. Li Xuan didn’t seem to be affected much despite being a lecher. Although he was also looking at Pandora, his eyes were still clear. He didn’t look like he had been mesmerized.

“Are you alright?” Zhou Wen asked, afraid that he had made a mistake. With Li Xuan’s personality, he couldn’t believe that he hadn’t pounced at Pandora.

“She hasn’t rushed over yet. What can happen to me?” Li Xuan said in puzzlement.

“You don’t find her beautiful?” Zhou Wen looked at Li Xuan and knew that he wasn’t affected by Pandora’s seduction. That only served to surprise him even more.

“She’s beautiful, but no matter how beautiful she is, she’s not as important as one’s life. I can’t just bed her now, right?” Li Xuan found Zhou Wen’s words odd. No matter how beautiful a dimensional creature was, it couldn’t be eaten or married. What was there to say?

Zhou Wen thought to himself,?Could it be that a virgin’s Essence Energy Art makes him invulnerable to such skills?

After confirming that Li Xuan wasn’t affected, Zhou Wen felt a lot more at ease. Since they were going to fight, he had to strike first to gain the upper hand. He summoned his two golden guns and shot at Pandora.

Zhou Wen’s two golden guns fired Explosive Bullets and Frost Bullets. Their destructive power was considered pretty good at the Terror grade.

Pandora did not dodge. When the bullet hit her Fire God Golden Silk Robe, layers of flames immediately appeared. Before the bullets touched her, they melted into a liquid and vaporized.

The freezing power of the Frost Bullets was useless against the Fire God Robe.

What a powerful Fire God Robe. As expected of a Calamity-grade Companion Beast! Why can’t I summon mine??None of the bullets Zhou Wen shot out injured Pandora.

Li Xuan flashed behind Pandora and struck the back of her head with Devourer’s palm.

Pandora’s headband moved by itself and wrapped around Li Xuan’s arm like a snake. Then, it swam up and bound Li Xuan up tightly.

Furthermore, the headband was automatically shrinking, trying to snap Li Xuan’s body.

Thankfully, after Li Xuan’s body underwent Terror transformation, he was almost immortal. Li Xuan’s damaged body automatically healed the moment the headband tightened.

Li Xuan, who should have been sliced into several pieces by the headband, remained intact when the headband passed through his body.

“Die!” Zhou Wen saw that the crystal lamp was counting down to four. He didn’t dare waste any more time as he pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword and slashed at Pandora.

Pandora waved her sleeve, and the flaming cloud-like sleeve met the Immortal Culling Sword.

Chi!

The powerful defense of the Fire God Cloak was ultimately sliced apart by the Immortal Culling Sword. After the blade touched the golden silk robe, it tore through the sleeve.

Pandora retreated like a ghost, preventing herself from being hit by the Immortal Culling Sword.

Pandora smiled and Zhou Wen immediately felt the terrifying temptation greatly increase. However, it was still useless to Zhou Wen. It couldn’t shake his willpower.

Li Xuan wasn’t affected. The two of them attacked Pandora one after another.

Pandora was a Calamity-grade existence after all. Her movement speed was above the two of them. With the help of the Fire God Robe, headband, necklace, and ring, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan weren’t able to gain the upper hand.

Pandora danced in the air like a fairy as her beautiful leg flicked out from under her dress and kicked Li Xuan in the abdomen, sending him flying.

Bang!

Li Xuan slammed into the wall like a cannonball. His flesh and bones were severely deformed as he almost turned into a pancake.

However, when Li Xuan broke free from the wall, his body rapidly recovered. His body completely recovered by the time he landed on the ground. He charged at Pandora again.

Zhou Wen pushed his sword art to its limits and used instant transmission to constantly blink around to hold back Pandora.

In fact, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan had the upper hand. Pandora’s strongest strength wasn’t her combat strength, and her Calamity Zone wasn’t a combat-type domain, but the power of temptation.

However, Zhou Wen and Li Xuan didn’t buy it. Pandora’s Calamity Zone was basically useless to the two of them; thus, she could only rely on her own strength and divine artifacts to fight them.

If not for the four divine artifacts protecting her, Zhou Wen would have long slain her.

The Fire God Robe focused on defense, while the hairband focused on offense. The necklace had the ability to produce a sun-like flash that blinded her opponents, but this ability didn’t have much effect on Zhou Wen.

As for the ring, it seemed to have some kind of augmentation effect on Pandora. It wasn’t a weapon that attacked proactively.

Zhou Wen soon became familiar with Pandora’s various techniques. He struck out more ruthlessly with the Immortal Culling Sword in hand.

Boom!

The crystal chandelier’s countdown was already at 3. However, Zhou Wen was confident that Pandora wouldn’t be able to last until the countdown ended.

After being held back by Li Xuan, Pandora’s figure came to a momentary halt. The Immortal Culling Sword in Zhou Wen’s hand had already stabbed at her chest in a bid to instantly execute her.

Clang!

The Immortal Culling Sword had already pierced through the Fire God Robe and was about to pierce through Pandora’s body, but a metallic clang sounded. Something blocked the Immortal Culling Sword, preventing it from piercing through.

Zhou Wen retracted his sword and instant transmitted, dodging Pandora’s counterattack. He saw something appear from the spot where the sword blade pierced.

It was a black square box that looked similar to a Rubik’s Cube. Furthermore, it was pure black. It was very similar to the huge Rubik’s Cubes that had appeared all over the world, but it was much smaller.

Could that be Pandora’s magic box??Zhou Wen stared at the box and thought.

Without any time to think, the countdown continued. Zhou Wen slashed at Pandora at an even faster speed with his sword art.

However, what happened next left Zhou Wen somewhat alarmed.

The magic box seemed to have a life of its own as it floated around Pandora. No matter where Zhou Wen’s Immortal Culling Sword slashed, the magic box would instantly appear and block it.

Zhou Wen had several sure-kill Immortal Slaying moves, but they were all blocked by the Rubik’s Cube.
