Chapter 1355: Clear Answer

“I’ve found myself ensnared by a terrifying creature that likes to eat desserts. Help me investigate which powerful mythical existence likes desserts. It should be a Mythical creature from the West District.” Zhou Wen sent the message out en masse.

“Old Zhou, good luck to you,” Li Xuan replied.

“I’ll investigate now. Wait.” It was An Sheng.

“A terrifying creature that likes desserts. Why would a bastard like you be afraid?” Hui Haifeng teased.

“An hour.” Gu Dian’s reply was somewhat reliable.

“Other than liking desserts, is there any other information?” Wang Lu also replied.

“Do you need my help?” Zhang Yuzhi’s answer was very direct.

“Where are you? I’ll head over immediately.” Feng Qiuyan was very direct.

“Coach, wait for me.” Ming Xiu also sent a message.

…

Zhou Wen scanned the messages and didn’t receive any useful answers. Clearly, no one knew of such a Mythical creature.

Suddenly, a message popped up in Zhou Wen’s eyes. When he saw the shimmering flower avatar, his heart skipped a beat.

The person using the flower as an image was naturally The Thearch. Zhou Wen hurriedly opened the message to take a look.

“Is it a blonde girl?” Zhou Wen was immediately overjoyed when he saw The Thearch’s message. From the looks of it, The Thearch knew about Sweetie.

“Yes, do you know her origin?” Zhou Wen hurriedly replied while Sweetie was still sampling the cake.

“Prepare your funeral as soon as possible. If there’s anything you want to eat, do so quickly. If you have any unfulfilled wishes, well… I reckon it’ll be too late to fulfill them.” The Thearch’s message left Zhou Wen alarmed.

“The Thearch, are you going to tell me that as long as we carry on with our previous deal, I’ll be able to live?” Zhou Wen replied.

“There’s no need for any deal. What deal can you make with a dead person?” The Thearch quickly replied.

Zhou Wen really felt that something was amiss. The Thearch didn’t think of taking the opportunity to make a deal with him. It seemed a little serious.

“What’s her background?” Zhou Wen asked directly.

The Thearch didn’t answer. Instead, she asked Zhou Wen a question. “Are you a believer of any faith?”

Zhou Wen was taken aback when he saw this. He didn’t know if his beliefs had anything to do with this matter, but he thought carefully and couldn’t say for the moment if he had any.

When it came to faith, he didn’t believe in any religion, nor did he pray to gods. At most, he was a fair weather atheist who turned to god in a pinch.

However, it was actually wrong to say that he had no faith. Although Zhou Wen didn’t respect ghosts and gods, he had his own beliefs. He wasn’t a complete atheist.

“That depends on what you mean by faith. If you mean a particular religion, I don’t have any,” Zhou Wen answered.

“It’s good that you don’t have one,” The Thearch replied ambiguously, making Zhou Wen confused.

Thankfully, The Thearch immediately sent another message. “Even if you don’t have any faith, you should have heard of the name God, right?”

“Of course I’ve heard of it. I just don’t know which church the God you mentioned is from. According to what I know, the God of our East District refers to the God of Heaven. As for the God of the West District, he’s the omniscient and omnipotent god.”

Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he immediately sent another message. “Could that blonde girl be related to God of the West District?”

One had to know that God was the ruler of a pantheon—a supreme existence.

Tsukuyomi was only a demigod of a pantheon, but she was already that powerful. If the God of the West really existed, his strength was obvious. To be able to be related to him definitely made one an extremely terrifying existence.

From the six-winged seraphim powers that Yana showed and Sweetie’s appearance, it was not strange that they had something to do with God.

“It does have something to do with it.” The Thearch gave an affirmative answer.

Zhou Wen thought carefully. With his meager knowledge of West District myths, the women related to God were likely angels.

However, it was really difficult to say if angels were considered women. Although many angels were given the appearance of women, angels were actually genderless.

After some thought, Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up as he immediately sent a message to The Thearch. “Could it be that the blonde girl is Eve or her child?”

He could only think of one woman, and she was the one that resulted in Original Sin.

“Your imagination is quite rich, but unfortunately, you guessed wrongly. I’ll give you two more chances. Guess again.” The Thearch rejected Zhou Wen’s guess.

“I’m stumped. Could she be an angel?” Zhou Wen probed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Sometimes, you are very smart, but sometimes, you are very stupid. Can’t you see such an obvious answer?” The Thearch’s message was filled with mockery.

“How can I tell? How is there an obvious answer?” Zhou Wen asked. His understanding of the West District myths was limited, so it was normal that he couldn’t guess it.

Beep! Beep! A message was immediately sent. Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that the message The Thearch had sent was a voice message.

Zhou Wen clicked on the message and immediately heard a very charming female voice. Upon hearing this voice, it generated images of a charming and powerful mature lady in his mind, or a lofty queen sitting on a throne with crossed legs—ones wrapped in black stockings.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to appreciate the voice because the words left him stunned.

“I’ve already told you her name, but you ignored it. What a fool.”

The corners of Zhou Wen’s eyes twitched as he stared intently at the phone screen. The Thearch had only mentioned one name—”God.”

“Are you telling me that God is a blonde girl? And she especially likes desserts?” Zhou Wen didn’t believe it at all.

“Otherwise?” The Thearch mocked.

Although I don’t know much about West District’s God, I also know that God is a trinity. Holy Father, Holy Son, and Holy Spirit, there’s no Holy Lady. How can God be a girl? Zhou Wen felt that The Thearch was probably bluffing him.

“It doesn’t matter if you believe me or not. As you are doomed, enjoy whatever’s left of your life. Also, I’ll give you a friendly reminder. Under no circumstances are you to touch her.” After The Thearch said that, she went offline and her avatar dimmed.

God is a blonde girl who likes desserts??Zhou Wen found it a little unreal. No matter how he looked at it, Sweetie didn’t look like God.

If God is really a naive blonde girl, wouldn’t this world be in chaos??Zhou Wen thought.
