Chapter 1258: Sweetie’s Wooden Hut

Translator: CKtalon

The Time Hut really lives up to its name!?Zhou Wen looked at the Time Hut and finally knew why it was given that name.

On a tree in the forest, there was an inconspicuous treehouse. It was made from wood from the forest.

On the treehouse, there were plants similar to ivy, making the entire wooden hut exude vibrancy.

If not for Philo and company being very certain that this was the Time Hut, Zhou Wen would have imagined that this was a temporary residence built by hunters. It was a little too small. From the outside, it looked as if it could only accommodate two to three adults.

The door of the hut was nailed with wooden planks and looked like it had quite a number of cracks. There was a plaque with tree bark covering parts of it hanging on the door. It was irregularly shaped, and one could see the holes left by worms and the tree rings.

.

And on the plaque, there was a line of words: “Sweetie’s Wooden Hut.”

Zhou Wen had previously seen these words on the Internet. Many people were guessing the meaning behind the word “Sweetie”, but no matter how many western myths they ran through, they couldn’t figure out who or what Sweetie was.

Someone guessed that Sweetie was the name of a creature, and the Time Hut belonged to it.

Some people guessed that to mythical creatures, the Time Hut was like candy.

There were also people who guessed that there was some kind of candy hidden in the wooden hut. One could immediately advance to the Mythical stage after eating it. There were all sorts of guesses, but no one knew the reason for its name.

People were more used to calling it Time Hut. After all, the name ‘Sweetie’s Wooden Hut’ wasn’t suitable for such a terrifying place. It was also quite a mouthful.

Zhou Wen sized up the wooden hut and wasn’t in a rush to enter. It was useless to be anxious. Lucas had been missing for four years. If he was in danger of dying, he would have died long ago. If he remained alive, the additional few minutes wouldn’t matter.

He circled the wooden hut, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol.

To enter a place like the Time Hut in real life was equivalent to risking one’s life to try one’s luck. If one was unlucky, even a Terror-grade entity might not be able to exit.

Even a temporal expert like Cave Era had to buy spatial skill crystals from others instead of farming them inside the Time Hut. It could be imagined how terrifying this place was.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen was delighted. He discovered the tiny palm symbol on the wooden plank near the roof of the Time Hut.

It was engraved on the bark of the wooden board. Under the elements, it had become blurry, like a child’s scribble.

Zhou Wen took out his phone and took a picture of the tiny palm symbol that held a wooden hut. His phone immediately entered the download screen. He then pretended to take a few pictures elsewhere.

“Are we going in now?” Philo asked Zhou Wen. She knew that she wasn’t capable enough, but she still planned on entering. If she couldn’t find Lucas, she hoped to quickly spend the rest of her remaining life in the Time Hut.

“Not for now. We need to make some preparations.” Zhou Wen planned on waiting for the Time Hut dungeon to be downloaded before entering the game to take a look.

To randomly enter such a dangerous place would be at odds with the original intention of saving Lucas—not only would he not be saved, but many lives would be lost as well.

Although Philo wanted to enter immediately, she knew that without Zhou Wen, the chances of her rescuing Lucas were slim. All she could do was wait patiently.

“Thank you for bringing us here. If you have things to do, you can head back now,” Zhou Wen said to the elder.

The elder hurriedly said, “There’s no rush. The strange forest is unpredictable. The path we came from will be somewhat different when we return. Only people who are very familiar with it can rely on experience to find a way out. We’ll wait for you and Philo to rescue Lucas before taking you out.”

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly frowned slightly and looked deeper into the strange forest.

After watching for a while, Zhou Wen turned his head and asked the elder, “Is there an animal-type dimensional creature in the strange forest?”

“I don’t think so. They are basically plant-type dimensional creatures. We have never seen animal-type dimensional creatures before. Only the Time Hut has some animal-shaped dimensional creatures, but they aren’t real animals. They are puppets that look like animals,” the elder said.

“That’s strange.” Zhou Wen looked deep into the strange forest as his expression turned solemn. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

With his hearing, he could only hear a faint panting sound. Furthermore, it gave off an extremely dangerous feeling that made Zhou Wen’s heart palpitate.

“The strange forest isn’t safe. It’s best you return,” Zhou Wen said to the elder.

Although he didn’t know where the thing was, Zhou Wen was certain that there was definitely some terrifying creature in this strange forest.

The creature’s non-appearance didn’t mean that it wouldn’t appear.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that the creature was eyeing them. This was just a feeling—he couldn’t determine where it was.

“You can rest assured about that. My father has been traversing the strange forest for decades, but he has never encountered any animal-type creatures. Instead, there are some plant-type dimensional creatures that can move. The most common ones are the Devil Treants. Their roots can move in the soil and rocks.” As the elder’s son spoke, he summoned a Devil Treant Companion Beast. It looked like a strange tree with eyes and a trunk as thick as a water vat.

“It’s not a Devil Treant. It should be some kind of animal.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly. He was certain that the panting was bestial.

Most of these people had been in the strange forest for more than ten years. They had never seen any animal-type dimensional creatures, so they naturally didn’t believe Zhou Wen.

However, they didn’t dare refute Zhou Wen’s words. It still left them extremely uneasy, believing that Zhou Wen didn’t have any use for them.

The elder smiled and said, “Then we’ll head back.”

“It’s probably too late now.” Zhou Wen stared deep into the forest as his expression turned solemn. He could already sense that the panting was approaching.

However, he didn’t discover any traces of the creature. With his senses, he could only hear panting sounds approaching, but he couldn’t discover its location. This made him extremely wary.

The elder and company were somewhat puzzled, unsure what Zhou Wen meant.

Grim Demon and Ice Maiden also sensed something as they looked around—they also heard panting. Like Zhou Wen, they couldn’t tell where the panting was coming from.

Ya’er leaned into Zhou Wen’s embrace as though she was afraid.

Demonic Neonate showed no fear. Her large eyes stared deep into the forest as though she was looking at something.

Boom!

The ground trembled as a large portion of the trees in the distance snapped. The rows of trees collapsed like dominoes as they crashed down.
