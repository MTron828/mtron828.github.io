Chapter 927: Discovered

Translator: CKtalon

After climbing to the volcanic crater, Zhou Wen looked around. All he could see was billowing black smoke that enveloped the sky and volcanoes.

Looking around, there was only one place that was slightly different. In between the volcanoes, there was a mountain that resembled a heavenly pillar. Its height far exceeded that of ordinary volcanoes, piercing through the black smoke that enveloped the sky. One couldn’t see the end of the mountain.

Could the tower The Thearch mentioned be that mountain? Zhou Wen thought to himself. However, no matter how he looked at it, it was only a special mountain. It was somewhat different from a tower.

However, Zhou Wen had nowhere else to go. All he could do was rush towards the huge mountain.

Could it really be a teleportation error? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss, but how could the bronze tripod cauldron that had a fixed destination make such a mistake?

He ran across the land in the form of a snow cat. From time to time, dimensional creatures would spew out from the volcano. Before long, void lightning would make the dimensional creatures vanish.

Could it be that the lightning is a spatial rift that leads to Earth? The dimensional creatures on Earth all pass from here? Then, if I’m struck by lightning, will I be able to return to a dimensional zone on Earth? Zhou Wen kept thinking. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If a legendary mistake really happened, he had to think of a way to return. Otherwise, if a human were to be discovered by the dimensional races in such a place, it would be no different from courting death.

Thankfully, there didn’t seem to be any particularly powerful creatures here. They were dimensional creatures that spewed out from volcanoes. They were mostly Mortal and Legendary creatures, and relatively fewer Epic creatures. Occasionally, there would be one at the Mythical stage.

If there aren’t any more terrifying and powerful existences here, it’s a good place to grind. However, although there are many dimensional creatures here, they all have the characteristics of demons... Zhou Wen observed as he walked. The Truth Listener earring constantly scanned his surroundings.

The pillar-like mountain was too far from where Zhou Wen was. The closer Zhou Wen was to it, the more majestic the mountain was.

Thankfully, with the Nine-Tailed Fox’s pearl and Eyes of Legacy, the dimensional creatures that spewed out of the volcano didn’t attack Zhou Wen, saving him a lot of trouble.

It took Zhou Wen nearly three hours to approach the mountain. The bronze tripod’s passageway could only last for thirty-six hours. If he didn’t discover anything, Zhou Wen planned on returning via the original path.

He sized up the mountain that was very close, but he didn’t discover anything. There were no dimensional creatures nearby, nor were there any traces of the void lightning.

As for the volcanic eruptions, Zhou Wen had no idea if it was a volcano because he couldn’t see beyond the black smoke above.

He constantly scanned the mountain but failed to find anything. Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before deciding to climb up to take a look. If he didn’t find anything, he could return the way he had come to avoid being trapped in this godforsaken place.

Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find any dimensional creatures nearby before climbing up the mountain.

He used the snow cat’s body to quickly jump on the mountain rocks. This was because not only was the mountain huge, but it was also especially steep. The mountain wall was inclined at almost 90 degrees, so Zhou Wen could only use the cracks on the rocks or the protruding spots as a foothold.

The snow cat didn’t have the ability to fly, so Zhou Wen didn’t use it to avoid being discovered.

Just as he was about to reach the mountainside, Zhou Wen discovered a protruding platform. He landed on it and planned on resting to condition himself.

However, after landing on the platform, he realized that there was a cave behind the platform. In the dark cave, there was a pair of eyes staring at him.

This wasn’t something Zhou Wen sensed, he could really see a pair of eyes. They emitted a blue glow, making them stand out in the dark cave.

Furthermore, the owner of those eyes was slowly walking out of the cave.

Zhou Wen was alarmed when he saw the eyes staring at him. He was about to summon Truth Listener’s earring to sweep at it.

However, before Zhou Wen could summon Truth Listener, the creature had already walked out of the cave. It was a tiger with two wings.

Its body was black, but there were many places that were transparent dark blue. As it grunted, the dark blue spots on its body alternated between bright and dark. When it was bright, it was like a glowing amethyst. When it was dark, it was the same as the other black spots on its body. It was blackish-gray like metal.

Zhou Wen sensed a powerful Essence Energy fluctuation from it. It was definitely a Mythical creature, but he didn’t know if it had the ability to undergo Terror transformation.

Zhou Wen slowly moved his body, but the creature kept staring at him. Clearly, it had locked onto its target.

Roar! In the next second, the creature let out a tiger roar. Its body emitted a blue glow as it pounced forward.

Zhou Wen was just about to counterattack when he suddenly realized something. He retreated but didn’t launch a counterattack.

Boom!

A terrifying beam descended from the mountain and struck the Mythical creature, freezing its body in ice.

This rather powerful Mythical creature didn’t even have the chance to resist. Its body maintained its pouncing pose as it froze.

And on the mountain peak, a figure quickly floated down.

Zhou Wen had already used Truth Listener’s ability to see the figure clearly. It was a woman in a snow robe. She looked very beautiful, but her face was extremely cold. Furthermore, her aura was somewhat different from humans. Her entire body seemed to emit a frost aura.

Without a doubt, she was a dimensional creature with terrifying strength.

“Why would a snow cat come here?” The snow-robed woman was slightly surprised when she saw Zhou Wen. She extended her hand and sucked the snow cat into her arms.

At that moment, another dimensional creature with a snake’s tail and human body slithered down. It glanced at the frozen Mythical creature and said, “This Fairy Demonic Tiger is smart. It actually hid here. It’s no wonder it wasn’t sent to the human world.”

“Throw it into the void lightning,” the snow-robed woman said.

The snake-tailed dimensional creature responded and grabbed the frozen Fairy Demonic Tiger with one hand before throwing it towards the volcanic area.

The huge ice block streaked across the sky like a meteor. Soon, it rushed into an area filled with void lightning before disappearing.

“What about this little thing?” the snake-tailed monster asked as it looked at Zhou Wen.

“I’ll deal with it myself,” the snow-robed woman said as she flew up and headed for the top of the mountain that resembled a heavenly pillar.

The snake-tailed monster didn’t say anything else and followed the snow-robed woman to the top of the mountain.
