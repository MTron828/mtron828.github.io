Chapter 1078: Betting Contract

Translator: CKtalon

Moon Goddess had been born on the Moon, so she didn’t know much about Earth. All she could see were some of the major things that had happened on Earth. It had to be a sufficiently large commotion for her to see a thing or two.

Just like how the ship had flown out of thin air back then, Moon Goddess could see such a huge matter clearly from the Moon.

Originally, the battle between Chiyou and Yellow Emperor wasn’t enough for the Moon Goddess to observe. However, a huge meteorite had slammed into Earth. If Earth had been hit, most of the creatures would have been wiped out.

Moon Goddess didn’t know what the experts on Earth had done. However, Chiyou had worn the Weapon Lord Armor and destroyed the meteorite.

The Dimensional Wheel Companion Egg had flown out from the shattered meteorite. However, Chiyou and the Weapon Lord were exhausted of their strength after destroying the meteorite. It was picked up by another human and Guardian. They were naturally Yellow Emperor and Mystic Thearch.

There’s actually such a thing! Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that. He didn’t know if Moon Goddess was telling the truth.

However, Moon Goddess’ knowledge was very limited. She didn’t say it clearly because there was no such thing as the black cubes in that era. The experts directly fought on Earth. Only when the combat energy exceeded a certain threshold could Moon Goddess observe it.

Moon Goddess had observed the Dimensional Wheel’s energy explosion many times. It was likely the key to Yellow Emperor’s victory.

“That’s not right. Since the Dimensional Wheel is Yellow Emperor’s Companion Beast, it should have died with him. Why did it end up in the hands of the dimensional creatures?” Zhou Wen thought of a terrifying question.

“That’s not something I can know.” The puppet controlled by Moon Goddess shook its head.

As the two of them spoke, the black cube lit up again. Another person issued a challenge, and the person being challenged was still Ya.

To dare challenge at this time, the challenger must be extraordinary. They must be at the Terror grade, right? Zhou Wen looked at the challenger’s name.

However, the name was very unfamiliar. It was a Guardian named Cave Era.

Not long after, Zhong Ziya accepted the challenge and appeared in the cube’s arena again.

Zhou Wen carefully sized up Cave Era that had entered the arena. He saw a human wearing gray armor. The armor covered her entire body, so he could only tell that it was a woman’s figure. However, he didn’t know what kind of human she was or what she looked like. He didn’t know if she was young or old. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Is this a former Guardian?” Zhou Wen asked the Moon Goddess puppet.

In recent years, very few Guardians had advanced to the Terror grade. As long as they were at the Terror grade, there was a high chance that they were former Guardians who had survived.

“I don’t know.” Moon Goddess’s answer left Zhou Wen somewhat depressed.

Zhong Ziya didn’t care who his opponent was. He immediately entered his Terror form and transformed into a beam of light that slashed at Cave Era.

Cave Era’s figure vanished in front of everyone as though she was invisible.

She’s indeed a Terror grade! Zhou Wen wasn’t too surprised. It would be strange if the person who dared to challenge Ya wasn’t at the Terror grade.

After Cave Era vanished, the only thing that could be seen in the arena was Ya, who was like a dazzling light. One could see the light constantly flashing. Ya was probably constantly attacking. He was likely capable of seeing Cave Era.

“Ya is in danger,” Moon Goddess said.

“What’s going on?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown. He couldn’t see the battle clearly.

“See for yourself.” Moon Goddess didn’t answer directly.

“Would I be asking you if I could see it?” Zhou Wen said gloomily.

“You’ll be able to see it very soon,” Moon Goddess said with a hint at what she felt deep down.

Indeed, before long, Zhou Wen realized that the shadow that represented Ya was gradually slowing down. Not only that, but even his Terror form was becoming somewhat unstable.

After a while, Ya couldn’t maintain his Terror form and revealed himself.

Furthermore, his body looked a little odd. The body under the robe looked much thinner and more hunched. Although his appearance couldn’t be seen, his body didn’t give off the feeling of a young and strong youth. Instead, he looked like an old man on the brink of death.

Temporal power! Zhou Wen immediately knew what had happened. The power of Cave Era was time.

Zhong Ziya had been affected by powers like Time Acceleration. Guardians wouldn’t die and weren’t afraid of the passage of time. However, Zhong Ziya wasn’t a pure Guardian. Half of him had a human bloodline and he had a limit to his lifespan. He would still age.

“There’s still a chance of survival if he admits defeat now. Otherwise, he will die of old age in the arena. Unfortunately, he has a betting contract. Admitting defeat will also lead to death,” said Moon Goddess with a sigh.

What kind of contract is a betting contract? Zhou Wen could roughly guess the rules of the bet, but he still wanted to know the details.

“A typical Guardian contract is an equal contract. Both parties can terminate the contract at any time without paying any price. However, a betting contract is different, especially in a situation like Ya’s. His strength isn’t enough to absorb such a powerful Guardian, so he can only agree to sign a betting contract with the Guardian. If he can win the betting contract, he can always have this body. However, if he loses, I’m afraid this body will only benefit others in the end,” Moon Goddess said.

“Just now, he said that he’s betting on whether he can obtain first place. In other words, he has no way out now. He has to win?” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.

“His body has already aged. I’m afraid there’s no chance of him winning,” said Moon Goddess.

“It shouldn’t be that simple,” Zhou Wen said as he stared at Ya.

“He can’t withstand the passage of time, nor can he touch Cave Era who possesses the ability of Time Acceleration. I can’t think of a way for him to turn the tides of defeat.” The Moon Goddess puppet looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Do you know what other abilities he has to help him turn the tables?”

“I don’t know what abilities he has, but a person like him shouldn’t be so helpless,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

However, the scene Zhou Wen was hoping for didn’t happen. As time passed, Ya’s body died and he collapsed to the ground. As time passed too quickly, Ya’s body turned to dust.

Cave Era’s figure appeared again. She glanced at the scattered dust on the ground, but her expression suddenly changed. She immediately entered her Terror form.

As for the dust that scattered on the ground, it gathered together again and returned to Ya’s appearance. Furthermore, there was no sign of age on his body.

“Do you only realize it now? It’s too late,” Ya said as he extended his palm. A strange light rune shimmered in his palm.

At the spot where Cave Era had vanished, the same light rune shimmered. It immediately pulled Cave Era’s body over, and she charged uncontrollably into Ya’s palm.

Despite using several powers in a row, she was unable to escape Ya’s power. Even though time slowed down, Cave Era still flew towards Ya’s palm.
