Chapter 1241: Battle of Mount Laojun 3

Translator: CKtalon

Blood Shaman underwent Terror transformation and used the strength he was best at. Nobody within the blood-colored halo’s envelopment could summon their Companion Beasts for battle.

Hermit condensed a micro crystal and prepared to join forces with Blood Shaman to attack An Tianzuo. Hermit had even secretly sent out a signal for all the Guardians to attack together.

However, while they were still formulating their plan of attack, the Gatling in An Tianzuo’s hand had already begun firing crazily. Terrifying blue flames spewed out from the muzzle.

Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta!

The bullets were like a roaring meteor shower that instantly enveloped everyone.

The firing was very fast. Hermit’s figure blinked in and out of existence like a ghost as he dodged the bullets.

.

However, Blood Shaman wasn’t that fast. His body emitted a sanguine glow as he punched at the bullets, hoping to send them flying.

Clang! Clang!

The bullets struck Blood Shaman’s fist and shattered the armor over his fist. At the same time, it sent the Blood Shaman retreating as he raised his arms uncontrollably.

The bullets rained down on him, causing Blood Shaman to retreat step by step. His feet cracked the ground as his armor shattered, revealing charred bullet holes.

Some of the Guardians behind him dodged in a panic while others used their own strength to block.

Some Guardians used their shields to block the bullets and were sent retreating. Some ducked the sweeping bullets, but there were also Guardians who failed to dodge. Their bodies were torn apart by the bullets as their blood and organs exploded and spewed to the ground.

The Mythical Guardians’ armor shattered. The humans inside had no chance of survival. Their lives were as fragile as paper.

In just an instant, all the Mythical Guardians were killed. One of the Terror-grade Guardians was killed and three or four were injured. The rest were more or less in a sorry state.

What domineering offensive power! Zhou Wen was slightly surprised by An Tianzuo’s destructive power. An Tianzuo, who now had both hands, was much stronger than the one-handed An Tianzuo.

The destructive power of the Gatling was something ordinary weapons could not contend with.

Hermit appeared behind An Tianzuo like a ghost. At the same time, he flicked out an indiscernible micro crystal. The micro crystal was as tiny as bacteria, but it contained the full strength of a Terror-grade power. If one didn’t sense it and accidentally touched it or had it invade their bodies, even a Terror-grade creature would be blasted to death.

However, as An Tianzuo fired the bullets crazily, it was as though he had eyes at the back of his head. He dodged the Hermit’s micro crystal while the Gatling in his hand continued firing. The bullets rained down on a Guardian like a volcanic eruption, blasting the Terror-grade Guardian’s body apart in midair.

Elsewhere, Blood Shaman rushed to An Tianzuo’s other side and punched at the back of his head with a strange blood beam.

An Tianzuo didn’t even turn his head as he struck out with the huge sword in his other hand, slashing at Blood Shaman’s fist. He forcefully shattered Blood Shaman’s violent fist and repelled him.

The constantly rumbling Gatling sent a Terror-grade Guardian who was charging at him into a retreat. Its shield was filled with circular indentations formed by the bullets.

The other Terror-grade Guardians spread out and attacked An Tianzuo from different directions.

An Tianzuo’s expression was cold, but his body moved rapidly. At the same time, he slashed with his broadsword, unleashing all his Gatling firepower. Despite being surrounded, his powerful firepower suppressed Hermit and Blood Shaman’s attacks.

“Overseer, kill those bastards!” an officer, who wore his heart on his sleeve, shouted excitedly.

However, most people couldn’t see the battle. They didn’t even have the ability to see Terror-grade power.

Zhou Wen naturally saw it clearly. Although he didn’t like An Tianzuo, he had to admit that An Tianzuo was almost inhuman. He looked more like a combat mecha.

His every move seemed to be calculated by a computer. There was no sign of him making mistakes in battle.

Even in such a high-intensity battle, there was nothing wrong with his actions.

Hermit and Blood Shaman were alarmed and furious. They had so many Guardians attacking An Tianzuo together, but they couldn’t even touch his clothes. Now, only the two of them and the five Terror-grade Guardians were left. Furthermore, they looked even more pathetic than An Tianzuo.

Blood Shaman was the most depressed. He was best at restraining humans who relied on Companion Beasts, but An Tianzuo didn’t use any Companion Beasts from beginning to end. He purely relied on his destructive power to suppress them.

Hermit was also secretly alarmed. Although he had long known that An Tianzuo was very strong, or he wouldn’t have been named one of the four war gods, he never expected him to be this strong. In terms of offensive strength, there weren’t many at the Terror grade who could fight him.

Worse still, not only was An Tianzuo’s offensive strength off the charts, but his movement techniques were as powerful as his melee abilities. Hermit had tried to sneak an attack on An Tianzuo several times, but he failed.

Blood Shaman’s melee attacks were repelled by An Tianzuo’s broadsword again and again. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Blood Shaman, get Cave Era over. Her ability can restrain An Tianzuo.” Hermit couldn’t care less. He had to capture An Tianzuo as soon as possible.

Blood Shaman also knew that they had underestimated the horror of the four war gods. Without any hesitation, he activated the time mark that Cave Era had left on him.

A clock mark lit up on Blood Shaman’s forehead. At the instant the clock mark peeled off his forehead, it strangely transformed into Cave Era’s figure.

Cave Era’s expression turned nasty. She was about to ask Blood Shaman why he had used the time mark—she had clearly told him not to use it unless it was absolutely necessary.

However, before she could ask, the bullets that swept over made Cave Era realize what had happened.

Without any hesitation, Cave Era used her temporal powers. The rampaging bullets seemed to slow down as Cave Era slowly dodged the slow-moving bullets.

“Kill him.” Cave Era was equally alarmed when she saw the situation. Killing intent flashed in her eyes as she activated the temporal power. Her speed increased to an unbelievable level as she arrived in front of An Tianzuo and pointed at his forehead.

Cave Era’s ability was indeed somewhat effective against An Tianzuo. At such speeds, An Tianzuo was unable to control the Gatling’s sweeping fire. All he could do was retreat while using his broadsword to block the finger strike.

However, Cave Era’s fingers didn’t touch the sword at all. With another acceleration of time, she circled behind An Tianzuo and tapped at the back of his head again.

An Tianzuo threw the Gatling in his other hand back and smashed the gun barrel at Cave Era’s head, hoping to exchange a devastating blow.

How could Cave Era let him do as he wished? With a flash, she appeared on the other side of An Tianzuo with the temporal acceleration. Hermit and Blood Shaman also surrounded him.

An Tianzuo was immediately thrown into danger. The situation had gone south.

“Uncle is in danger.” Ya’er looked eagerly at Zhou Wen, clearly asking Zhou Wen to save him.
