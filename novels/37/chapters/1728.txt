Chapter 1729 Chaos Egg Cracks

Just as the Chaos Egg enveloped Zhou Wen’s body, it suddenly caved in without any warning. It was as though something was squeezing the Chaos Egg from all directions, causing it to constantly distort like a balloon that could burst at any moment.

Looking at the Essence Energy Crystals that appeared crazily in the Chaos Egg, Zhou Wen secretly cheered inwardly. He couldn’t sense the existence of the sword beams at all. If not for his intuition and the existence of the Chaos Egg, he would have been severely injured by the terrifying sword beams.

The woman was somewhat surprised that her Nihility Sword Aura failed to penetrate the Chaos Egg

“Let’s see how long you can last.” The Nihility Sword Aura over the woman’s body surged out, hoping to blast the Chaos Egg apart.

However, no matter how mighty her sword beams were, they failed to break through the 1 Egg’s defense.

As expected, her strength is suppressed to a certain extent since Earth hasn’t completely lost its seal. It’s still within the Calamity grade range. Zhou Wen immediately felt relieved when he saw the Chaos Egg block the Nihility sword beams.

“Have fun. I won’t be joining you,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to leave.

“To be able to withstand the Nihility Sword Aura, your strength should be Chaos. To be able to cultivate a Chaos-elemental Essence Energy Art to such an extent, and a pure defensive Essence Energy Art at that, I’m afraid only someone like you who can cultivate multiple Essence Energy Arts at the same time can do it,” the woman said as her tone turned even more unyielding. She continued, “Unfortunately, you are ultimately at the Calamity grade; the level you come into contact with is too low.”

As he spoke, the invisible Nihility Sword Aura suddenly changed. It stopped attacking the Chaos Egg and began rapidly spinning around

it.

Although the Chaos Egg’s defense was astonishing, it didn’t have any destructive power. With the sword beams spinning around it, it was unable to rush out.

Not only was he unable to rush out, but he was also forced to spin by the power of the sword aura.

The Chaos Egg’s spinning didn’t affect Zhou Wen inside, but being trapped here and unable to leave clearly wasn’t good news for him.

“The Calamity grade is still low. Does that mean you are at the Apocalypse grade? However, it looks like the Apocalypse grade is nothing much. So what if you can retain me?” Zhou Wen probed.

The woman said disdainfully, “Chaos is the source of the world. It’s seamless, without beginning. It’s an indestructible whole, and nothing in the world can break it. If you were facing ordinary people, indeed no one could break it. Unfortunately, you encountered me. So what if it’s the One Essence of Chaos? Ignoring your mere Chaos Body, even when the world was in chaos, it could still be torn apart by supreme power. I shall slash apart Chaos today and carry out the splitting of the heavens and earth.”

Just as he said that, the Nihility Sword Aura that was spinning the Chaos Egg split into two. One sword aura made the Chaos Egg spin clockwise while the other sword aura made the Chaos Egg spin counter-clockwise. The sword aura’s differing directions made parts of the Chaos Egg spin in two different directions.

Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as he immediately understood what the woman was up to. The One Essence of Chaos was an inseparable whole, resulting in an indestructible Chaos Egg. Even if one’s strength was stronger than Zhou Wen’s, it was difficult to crack it.

However, there was no true One Essence of Chaos in this world. It was like a microscopic particle. Every time people believed that a particular particle was the smallest particle that couldn’t be split, they would realize that it wasn’t the smallest, nor was it truly inseparable with the development of technology

What the woman did was forcefully add Yin and Yang to the Chaos Egg. When the Chaos Egg had Yin and Yang, it was no longer an indestructible whole.

Originally, this was almost impossible, but the woman’s Nihility Sword Aura was also similar to Chaos, making the impossible possible.

Of course, the main reason was that the woman’s level was too high. Her level was far above Zhou Wen’s, and her understanding of Chaos was far beyond his.

If Zhou Wen’s understanding of Chaos could reach the same level as the woman’s, would the Chaos Egg be changed by the Nihility Sword Aura? It depended on who was stronger.

Although Zhou Wen had realized the problem, it was already too late.

As the Nihility Sword Aura constantly spun in two directions, cracks appeared on the distorted Chaos Egg. The cracks appeared to be strangely symmetrical. They looked extremely beautiful, but to Zhou Wen, it was a fatal blow.

This was the first time the Chaos Egg had been torn apart in a head-on clash. In the past, even if the Chaos Egg exploded, it would explode from the inside. It had never been torn apart from the outside.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be amazed that knowledge was power. Although their strengths were at the Calamity grade and Zhou Wen’s body wasn’t at the Calamity grade, the difference wasn’t overwhelming. The difference in knowledge was fatal.

Despite seeing the cracks on the Chaos Egg increase, Zhou Wen remained extremely calm.

Battles were ever-changing. Anything could happen.

Although experts who could steer a battle were terrifying, they weren’t considered top-notch existences if they didn’t have the ability to deal with all sorts of unexpected situations.

Although Zhou Wen was far inferior to the woman in terms of knowledge, the art of combat didn’t veer off from a core principle. The most basic things couldn’t be violated.

Since my knowledge is inferior to yours, I’ll turn your knowledge into mine. Zhou Wen had the Teacher Domain activated the entire time as he analyzed the woman’s Nihility Sword Aura.

If it were any other ability of the Immortals, the Hell-level Teacher Domain might not be able to analyze it. However, the Nihility Sword Aura was the same as the Chaos Egg. They were both Chaos-type powers. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Furthermore, the woman had said some key information, allowing Zhou Wen to understand the crux of the matter. The speed at which the Teacher Domain analyzed the Nihility Sword Aura far exceeded its usual speed.

Even analyzing some ordinary Calamity-grade creature abilities wouldn’t be as fast as now.

If the woman knew that her words would leave such a huge impact on Zhou Wen, she probably wouldn’t have said so much nonsense.

The power of the Nihility Sword Aura was born from the void. Like Chaos, it was power from before the world was created. Although it was called a sword aura, it could actually take any form.

It could be a wall, a shield, or even a palace. It could change into whatever shape she wanted.

Nihility doesn’t mean that there’s really nothing. Nothingness itself is an existence… As the rules analyzed by the Teacher Domain increased, Zhou Wen’s understanding of the Nihility Sword Aura deepened.

It’s still a little short. Chaos Egg, hold on! The Teacher Domain hadn’t completely analyzed the Nihility Sword Aura. The nomological connections weren’t complete, so it couldn’t transform into an Essence Energy Art.

However, the Chaos Egg couldn’t hold on any longer. It shattered under the Nihility Sword Aura as Zhou Wen’s body was instantly exposed.
