Chapter 1690: Ise Island

In that pantheon, Tsukuyomi represented the moon, and Amaterasu represented the sun. They were both supreme gods, and Amaterasu was ranked ahead of Tsukuyomi. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Wen had seen Tsukuyomi’s prowess. If there was really a Amaterasu Companion Beast, even Zhou Wen was tempted.

However, Zhou Wen still doubted if there really was an Amaterasu Companion Beast. After all, it was an existence similar to Tsukuyomi.

Since Tsukuyomi was already so powerful, Amaterasu was probably not inferior to Tsukuyomi. With humanity’s current standards, it was temporarily impossible for them to kill Amaterasu to obtain a Companion Beast.

Now that Mohe had told him that Shiraishi Satomi could obtain the Amaterasu Companion Beast, Zhou Wen didn’t believe it.

“What’s so special about Shiraishi Satomi?” Zhou Wen asked in disbelief.

“Shiraishi Satomi’s Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny are all perfectly compatible with Amaterasu. Only she can obtain its favor,” answered Mohe.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen heard Mohe’s tone as though Shiraishi Satomi didn’t need to kill Amaterasu to obtain a Companion Beast.

“This isn’t within the confines of our bet. Think about it yourself,” Mohe said with a faint smile.

“Can you give me a hint?” Zhou Wen didn’t mind and asked casually.

“Ise Island, we’re even.” With that said, Mohe hung up.

Zhou Wen put down the phone and thought for a moment before finding Sei Gasakai. Since Honn Shinsakura and Shiraishi Satomi were also there, he recounted what Mohe had told him.

“Ise Island?” The three of them were at a loss after hearing that.

“You don’t know where Ise Island is?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

They were born and raised overseas. If they didn’t know where Ise Island was, Zhou Wen suspected that Mohe was joking with him.

“There’s no island overseas called Ise Island. In myths and legends, the Ise Divine Palace is the residence of Great God Amaterasu. The place is called Takamagahara, but that’s only a legendary place. There’s no corresponding location in reality.” Honn Shinsakura thought for a moment and said, “Could it be that the information given by Mohe is wrong?”

Shiraishi Satomi also said with a bitter smile, “Perhaps they are really mistaken. My Life Providence, Life Soul, and Wheel of Destiny have nothing to do with the sun. How can they be perfectly compatible with the stats of Great God Amaterasu?”

Zhou Wen nodded. Although he was a little interested in Amaterasu, this interest was built on Tsukuyomi’s existence. He wasn’t disappointed if he couldn’t obtain the Amaterasu Companion Beast.

Just as he was about to return to continue gaming, he heard Sei Gasakai say, “Takamagahara is indeed something that exists in legends. There’s no corresponding place in reality. However, when I was traveling at sea, I did encounter a place suspected to be Takamagahara.”

Seeing Zhou Wen look at him, Sei Gasakai continued, “Takamagahara, Ashihara no Nakatsukuni, and Yomi are the three domains that form the Bansei pantheon. Among them, Takamagahara is also known as Country in the Clouds or Sky Island. Legend has it that it’s an island floating in the clouds above the sea. It’s invisible to mortals, and it’s where the deities live.”

“Once, after I experienced a storm at sea, the sky opened up and the clouds dissipated. I vaguely saw a huge island appear in the sky, but a moment later, the island in the sky vanished. I also went to the sky to investigate, but I didn’t find any traces of the island, so I thought it was a mirage.”

With that said, Sei Gasakai pondered for a moment before continuing, “But later, I heard from some friends that they saw the mirage-like sky island in the same location. Furthermore, when the island appeared, someone attempted to approach it, but they were pushed out by a powerful invisible force. After the island vanished, there was nothing there. We suspected that it was likely the legendary Takamagahara, but we couldn’t confirm it.”

“Interesting. Where’s that island?” Zhou Wen was really interested. After all, it was a dimensional zone of a pantheon. Perhaps he could download the dungeon and grind to his heart’s content.

Zhou Wen memorized the location Sei Gasakai told him. He could visit the place when he had the time in the future.

Now, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to do those things. All he wanted to know was if the hidden dungeon would respawn and if he could obtain a second Emperor Star.

There was another more important matter. Zhou Wen planned on letting Truth Listener see if it could kill the three-faced Buddha of Small Buddha Temple.

The hope of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra advancing to the Calamity grade was probably in Small Buddha Temple. However, the three-faced Buddha was just too powerful. With Zhou Wen’s own strength, there was temporarily no hope. Truth Listener’s advancement to the Heaven level gave Zhou Wen a sliver of hope.

After returning home, Zhou Wen opened the Small Buddha Temple dungeon and entered it again. He couldn’t help but feel nervous.

Truth Listener was obtained from Small Buddha Temple. Zhou Wen had no idea if it could defeat the three-faced Buddha.

This time, Zhou Wen directly circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and entered the temple hall. The three-faced Buddha didn’t react and wouldn’t attack anyone who cultivated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.

This time, Zhou Wen was just here as a bystander. Truth Listener was the one who really needed to do all the work.

My Listener, you have to work hard. Whether the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra can condense a domain depends on you.?Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener and got it to remove the restrictions of the earrings as he prayed silently.

Just as Truth Listener was summoned, the three-faced Buddha, who looked like a lifeless statue, suddenly widened his eyes and looked at Truth Listener standing in front of Zhou Wen, giving him a fright.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that only by switching out the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra would the three-faced Buddha react. This sudden development gave Zhou Wen a fright.

The three different faces of the three-faced Buddha—one without joy or worry, one filled with extreme sorrow, and one with a smile—had six Buddha eyes that emitted golden light. They stared at Truth Listener in unison.

The six golden beams were like six extremely bright searchlights that focused on Truth Listener.

The earrings on Truth Listener’s ears were unsealing, but only three of them had shattered. Under the Buddha’s eye’s golden light, the remaining three earrings shattered together, instantly allowing Truth Listener to remove all the restrictions. Its body quickly transformed into an ape before it took human form.

Zhou Wen secretly urged Truth Listener to take action quickly, but Truth Listener stood there motionless. Zhou Wen saw the ruthless expression on its face as though it wanted to shatter the three-faced Buddha with one strike, but its body didn’t react at all.

It’s over. Truth Listener is completely restrained by the three-faced Buddha. I should have known that Truth Listener came from here. The possibility of defeating the three-faced Buddha is slim.?Zhou Wen was alarmed as he knew that it was impossible to count on Truth Listener to kill the three-faced Buddha.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to unsummon Truth Listener, he suddenly saw the three-faced Buddha open its mouth to speak.
