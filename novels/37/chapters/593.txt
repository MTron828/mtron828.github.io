Chapter 594 Suicidal Farming

“Don’t do anything rash. The taboo power here is very powerful. It will really kill you,” Zhou Wen said.

“I’m just afraid that it’s not strong enough,” Li Xuan said as he stepped onto the stone steps on Jade Emperor Peak.

Just as he walked in, the carapace on his body crackled. Large amounts of cracks appeared on it, and blood oozed out.

In the next second, Li Xuan leaped out. By the time he landed, most of his carapace had shattered. Only a few remaining pieces were hanging from his body. His body was covered in blood and wounds everywhere, as though he had just been scooped out of a pool of blood.

“Are you alright?” Zhou Wen hurriedly went over to check Li Xuan’s injuries. It was a ghastly sight. There were bone-deep wounds everywhere.

“It’s fine. It’s really strong. This is it. This will be the best training ground for me.” Li Xuan struggled to his feet. The injuries on his body were healing at a discernible pace. Even the shattered carapace was rapidly growing amidst black-gray flames.

In moments, Li Xuan’s injuries and armor had completely recovered, as though he had never been injured.

“Don’t worry about me. Just do what you need to do,” Li Xuan said as he charged into Jade Emperor Peak. In the next second, Zhou Wen saw him thrown out again, covered in blood.

Seeing that he was fine, Zhou Wen walked into the Jade Emperor Peak himself. With the Gods Retreat absorbing the taboo power and protecting his body, he naturally wouldn’t be as miserable as Li Xuan.

Not daring to touch the two Demon Suppression beasts, Zhou Wen sat on the stone steps and gamed. He allowed the jade infant to absorb the taboo powers on the Jade Emperor Peak to slowly become stronger.

“Ah... Bam... Ah... Bam...” On Jade Emperor Peak, screams and sounds of falling could be heard from time to time. Even Zhou Wen was surprised by Li Xuan’s perseverance.

Although his recovery abilities were extremely strong and injuries weren’t a big deal to him, such injuries would definitely put Li Xuan in extreme pain. To endure such pain time and time again and even seek out injuries required immense perseverance. This form of self-torture to grow stronger wasn’t something anyone could withstand.

However, the effects of Li Xuan’s actions were obvious. Every time his body and carapace were repaired, he would last a little longer on Jade Emperor Peak. It was obvious that he was becoming stronger.

Seeing that Li Xuan was fine, Zhou Wen began grinding.

This time, he went straight to the Qiongqi temple. He had an idea. Perhaps he could kill Qiongqi without using the Bright Torch Vision World, but he didn’t know if it would work.

After arriving outside the Qiongqi temple, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to enter. Instead, he summoned Torch Dragon, Golden Battle God Halberd, and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Following that, he summoned Explosive Fiend Man and cast Time-Blast on Torch Dragon, Golden Battle God Halberd, and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.

Explosive Fiend Man walked in front of Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and extended his palm to press on its stomach.

Zhou Wen watched from the side as the armor on Explosive Fiend Man’s body lit up. It was as though a red stream of light was flowing through a connected tube, eventually flowing into Explosive Fiend Man’s palm.

A red light pattern immediately appeared on the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s belly. It had lines like a circuit board that spread across its body.

The light patterns spread very slowly. Two hours later, the red light patterns on the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon occupied one of the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s legs.

Explosive Fiend Man is only at the Mortal stage. His Essence Energy is too limited, so he can’t quickly release a Time-Blast. I can only take things slowly. In a real battle, it would be impossible to use the Explosive Fiend Man to fight. Zhou Wen didn’t have a good solution either. All he could do was patiently wait.

After four days, Zhou Wen really couldn’t wait any longer. Thankfully, most of the spots on the Golden Battle God Halberd and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon’s bodies were filled with Time-Blast’s red patterns. Zhou Wen didn’t plan on waiting any longer. He planned on giving it a try with this lineup.

Pushing open the temple door, Zhou Wen ordered Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd to charge in. At the same time, he summoned Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to restrain Qiongqi.

When Qiongqi saw Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd rush in, it immediately charged forward ferociously. Just as its claws were about to touch Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd emitted a red glow.

Boom!

The entire Qiongqi temple shook as dust fell everywhere. Zhou Wen and company had hidden to the side. After the explosion ended, he hurriedly looked into the temple.

The temple was in a mess. Corpse fragments were everywhere. There wasn’t even an intact bone left of Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. The Golden Battle God Halberd had also been reduced to pieces.

However, it could be seen that their bodies weren’t fully exploded and the energy usage was very low. This might be related to the low level of Explosive Fiend Man.

As for Qiongqi, its head and chest were badly mangled. Its legs had snapped. Although it wasn’t dead, it had been severely injured.

Zhou Wen hurriedly got Torch Dragon to charge in and fight the seriously injured Qiongqi.

Torch Dragon originally could not kill Qiongqi without using the Bright Torch Vision World, but now that Qiongqi was heavily injured and restrained by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Torch Dragon immediately gained the upper hand.

After a bitter battle lasting more than an hour, Torch Dragon finally killed Qiongqi in the temple. It was mainly because Qiongqi’s speed was too fast. Even with Qiongqi having its leg injured, Torch Dragon still spent a lot of effort to force Qiongqi into a dead-end before finally killing it.

Ding! As Qiongqi fell, a crisp sound entered Zhou Wen’s ears as a dimensional crystal dropped.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed. Most dimensional crystals were useless to him now. Even if it was a Mythical Essence Energy Skill Crystal, he couldn’t absorb it due to his lacking stats. He couldn’t bring it out of the game and could only let it disappear during his respawning.

However, when Zhou Wen took a closer look at the crystal, he was somewhat surprised. Beneath the gray crystal was the word “Evil stat 34.”

Evil stat? This was the first time Zhou Wen had heard of such an attribute. He had never seen it before.

However, since it was a rare stat, it would definitely be useful in the future. It should be useful when learning Essence Energy Skills.

After picking up the Evil stat crystal and absorbing it, there was indeed an additional Evil stat among his rare stats. Furthermore, it was as high as 34 points.

Although this method can kill Qiongqi, Explosive Fiend Man’s level is too low. It’s really irritating using him. I have to raise his level. Zhou Wen had the urge to feed the Explosive Fiend Man the Longevity Fruit.

However, on second thought, he did not. After all, Explosive Fiend Man wasn’t picky with food. It could evolve by eating anything, but Demonic Neonate didn’t eat anything other than the Longevity Fruits. There were only so many Longevity Fruits, so there would be nothing left after they were finished. Zhou Wen still planned on reserving the Longevity Fruits for Demonic Neonate to eat.

While Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were cultivating on White Cloud Mountain, something huge happened. Finally, someone issued a Companion Beast ranking challenge.
