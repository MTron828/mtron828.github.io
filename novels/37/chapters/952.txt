Chapter 953: Don’t Belong Here

Zhou Wen looked at the black-robed Chess Soul in puzzlement. He had won the game, but he didn’t immediately use the rules to control his body. He even asked such a question, so Zhou Wen was unsure what he was up to.

“I have a companion who wants to contract the Guardian.” Zhou Wen didn’t say that he was the one wanting to contract the Guardian.

If the black-robed Chess Soul allowed him to contract the Guardian for some quirky reason, wouldn’t it be awkward? Was he to attack or not?

One wouldn’t rush over and kill the person who had just given you a treasure with a smile, right?

“It’s that one, right?” The black-robed Chess Soul glanced at Li Xuan.

“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded.

The black-robed Chess Soul said, “I can give him a chance to attempt the contract, but there’s a condition.”

Zhou Wen looked at the black-robed Chess Soul in shock. This was the first time he knew that the Guardian Beast could negotiate with others.

This intelligence should be considered above par among the dimensional creatures on Earth, right? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and asked, “What’s the condition?”

The black-robed Chess Soul pondered for a moment before saying, “If you can’t contract it, you have to help me destroy the Guardian in the cocoon.”

Zhou Wen was even more alarmed when he heard that. He never expected the black-robed Chess Soul to make such a request ahead of time.

“Pardon me for asking, but aren’t you protecting it?” Zhou Wen asked.

The black-robed Chess Soul didn’t answer. It only asked Zhou Wen, “You can consider it. If you agree, you can get your companion to try the contract. If you don’t agree, you can leave now.”

“Why did you choose us?” Zhou Wen asked again. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Because you can help, especially you,” the black-robed Chess Soul answered directly without hiding anything.

“I need to discuss it with my companions,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“Sure.” The black-robed Chess Soul nodded slightly. Zhou Wen felt the taboo power on him vanish. He could stand up from the stone block.

Seeing Zhou Wen return, Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan wore looks of curiosity. Li Xuan asked, “Old Zhou, what’s going on?”

“The black-robed Chess Soul said that he can let us attempt to contract the Guardian, but there’s a condition,” Zhou Wen said.

“We can even negotiate?” Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan widened their eyes in disbelief.

“I originally thought that it wasn’t possible, but from the looks of it, I seemed to have had some misunderstandings in the past.” Zhou Wen now felt that the relationship between the Guardian Beast and the Guardian wasn’t as simple as he had imagined.

“Coach, what are the black-robed Chess Soul’s conditions?” Feng Qiuyan asked.

Zhou Wen repeated the words of the black-robed Chess Soul.

Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan looked at each other after hearing that. Like Zhou Wen, they found it unbelievable that such a thing would happen. It had completely exceeded their imagination.

“If the contracting fails, do we have the ability to kill the Guardian?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen.

“We can give it a try. Since the black-robed Chess Soul dares to take action, I believe he has some confidence. If you want to give it a try, go ahead.” Zhou Wen also wanted to eliminate the Guardian to prevent another enemy in the future.

“Alright, I’ll give it a try.” Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Li Xuan no longer hesitated.

After the three of them reached a consensus, they went up Mt. Chinese Chess and arrived in front of the black-robed Chess Soul.

“So as long as we agree to help you, we can attempt contracting the Guardian?” Li Xuan asked.

“That’s right.” The black-robed Chess Soul nodded slightly.

“Alright, we agree. Can I attempt to contract the Guardian now?” Li Xuan looked at the black-robed Chess Soul.

“Anytime.” The black-robed Chess Soul looked very easygoing. It didn’t request Zhou Wen and company to make an oath.

In fact, not all dimensional creatures had the ability to bind people with oaths. It was a very high-level ability that only a few powerful dimensional creatures had.

“Then I’ll be going.” As Li Xuan walked towards the Guardian cocoon, he looked at the black-robed Chess Soul.

The black-robed Chess Soul sat there leisurely without any intention of stopping him.

Li Xuan had long understood the method of contracting a Guardian from Zhou Wen. Without any hesitation, he cut his finger and dripped a drop of blood on the Guardian cocoon.

Unfortunately, this Guardian wasn’t interested in Li Xuan. Li Xuan’s blood flowed down without seeping into it.

“You don’t know what’s good for you.” Li Xuan retreated gloomily.

“Both of you can give it a try as well,” the black-robed Chess Soul said to Zhou Wen and Feng Qiuyan.

“There’s no need for me,” Zhou Wen said.

“I don’t need to either,” Feng Qiuyan said firmly.

The black-robed Chess Soul was somewhat surprised. It glanced at them and said, “Since you can’t contract it, you should fulfill your promise now.”

“What do you plan on doing? What can we help with?” Zhou Wen asked.

The black-robed Chess Soul got up and looked at the Guardian cocoon. He said with a heavy expression, “This Guardian cocoon shouldn’t be here.”

Zhou Wen was enlightened. “In that case, you don’t need to protect it?”

To his surprise, the black-robed Chess Soul shook its head and said, “My duty is indeed to protect it. Therefore, before it’s contracted, I can’t injure it unless something special happens.”

Zhou Wen guessed the special situation the black-robed Chess Soul mentioned. He looked at the Guardian cocoon and said, “Let it break out of the cocoon without a contract?”

The black-robed Chess Soul nodded and said, “Guardians without a contract are not allowed to break out of the cocoon. As long as you can help me break its cocoon and force it out, I can deal with it.”

“In other words, we only need to break the cocoon of the Guardian and don’t need to participate in the battle, right?” Zhou Wen thought.

“Of course, if you wish to participate, you can,” said the black-robed Chess Soul.

Zhou Wen and company looked at each other. They never expected the black-robed Chess Soul’s request to be so simple.

“What did you mean by it shouldn’t be here?” Li Xuan asked.

The black-robed Chess Soul said with a strange expression, “This explanation is very complicated. To put it simply, this Guardian and I don’t belong to this dimensional zone. We appeared here due to some accident.”

“In that case, you aren’t a Chess Soul?” Zhou Wen and company looked at the black-robed Chess Soul in a daze.

“No,” the black-robed Chess Soul answered firmly.

This answer made Zhou Wen and company’s expressions turn even odder. Li Xuan asked, “You aren’t a Chinese chess soul? How do you have such good skills at Chinese chess?”

“All chess souls have similarities. Although I’m not a Chinese chess soul, I’m a type of chess soul. Therefore, learning Chinese chess isn’t difficult,” said the black-robed Chess Soul.
