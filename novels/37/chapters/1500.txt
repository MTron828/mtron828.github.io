Chapter 1501 Dubhe

When Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were alone at Zhou Wen’s residence, Li Xuan said, “Old Zhou, what are your plans? Don’t tell me you really want to establish a human city here? Although this is your hometown, there’s no barrier here. There are unexplored dimensional zones everywhere. You can’t stay here forever, right?”

“I originally wanted to find a dimensional zone to establish a city, but unfortunately, I haven’t found a suitable place for the time being. I can only make do here for the time being,” Zhou Wen said as he stroked the baby bear’s back.

“I did some research on the nearby dimensional zones before coming here. There really aren’t any suitable places to build a city. Originally, Guide Ancient City was a good choice. Once the city gates are closed, it wouldn’t be easy to storm in. But that place is now too dangerous. There’s no way to enter, much less build a city,” Li Xuan said.

“If it was that easy to establish a city, this place would have long been occupied by others. The various factions are eyeing this place covetously, but they haven’t done anything yet. I know how difficult it is to establish a city here.” Zhou Wen also knew that it wasn’t easy to establish a city here.

“Since you are aware of all of this, why are you erecting a city here?” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement.

“What’s the point if it’s easy?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

Li Xuan curled his lips and said disdainfully, “Do you think I don’t know what kind of person you are? If it wasn’t for something interesting, would you be setting up a city here? I think if you have the time and energy, you’d rather play games in bed.”

Zhou Wen laughed. “You know me the best. I won’t hide it from you. Guide Ancient City has something very important to me, but I currently don’t have the ability to retrieve it. Therefore, I have to establish a city here and guard it, so as to prevent the item from falling into the hands of others. Do you still remember what you said back then about establishing a city that belongs to us? How about it? Stay behind. This city will be ours.”

“You’re full of nonsense. Why else would I be here? Do you think this is a tourist attraction?” Li Xuan curled his lips.

“That’s good. I can be relieved with you around,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“What do you mean? From what you’re saying, you want to be the boss that shirks responsibility?” Li Xuan immediately felt that something was amiss.

“That’s not what I meant. However, I do wish to make a trip to Dubhe to take a look,” Zhou Wen said.

“Sure, but don’t enter,” Li Xuan said.

“I know. Familiarize yourself with the situation here. I’ll make a trip when you are done.” Zhou Wen planned on giving Li Xuan some time.

“Do you think our Li family’s intelligence network is useless? I’m afraid I know the situation here better than you. Alright, go do what you need to do. Leave this to me. With Qin Zhen’s help, nothing will happen as long as a Calamity doesn’t descend,” Li Xuan said smugly.

“Is your brother alright?” When Li Xuan mentioned the intelligence network, Zhou Wen thought of Li Mobai. The Li family’s intelligence network had nothing to do with Li Xuan. It was all built by Li Mobai.

“He’s fine. He’s doing very well. He eats, sleeps, and curses. If it wasn’t for his eyes still in the cabinet at home, I would have wondered if he was blind. He’s even more normal than a normal person, so normal that he appears a little sick,” Li Xuan said with a smile.

“I cultivate in an Essence Energy Art with healing abilities. I can try to see if I can heal his eyes,” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s useless. He said it himself. His eyes are Ghost God Eyes. Healing abilities can’t treat it, and he’ll be like that for the rest of his life. However, he also said that looking at things doesn’t necessarily need eyes. It’s even more useless looking at people with eyes. Therefore, it doesn’t matter if he has eyes or not.” When Li Xuan said that, he looked somewhat helpless.

Zhou Wen guessed that Li Mobai was definitely educating him in a reprimanding tone when he said that.

The two chatted a lot more. The next morning, Zhou Wen summoned Qin Zhen, Fang Ruoxi, and company and introduced Yu Qiubai and the other core members to them, making it easier for them to work in the future.

Before leaving, Zhou Wen took Chick away, but he didn’t tell the others that he was leaving for a period of time.

Apart from Li Xuan, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on letting anyone know about this matter.

He would be back soon if everything went well. There was no need to alarm the others.

After returning to his room, Zhou Wen used Singularity Universe’s teleportation ability with Chick. With Dubhe as his target, he teleported over.

When Zhou Wen finished his teleportation, his vision was filled with light and flames. The temperature was terrifyingly high. Despite wearing the Prisoned Dragon armor, Zhou Wen still felt his body heat up.

Chick seemed excited as it opened its mouth and sucked. Large swaths of flames around it surged into its mouth and into its stomach like spring water.

Zhou Wen immediately felt the temperature around him drop significantly. He focused his gaze and realized that he was very close to Dubhe. The flames that surged upwards from the planet were like fountains that reached a height that exceeded where Zhou Wen was levitating. Even steel would instantly melt.

Zhou Wen pushed Truth Listener’s ability to its limits and flew close to the huge planet with Chick.

This planet was many times bigger than the sun. Wherever Zhou Wen flew, there were flames everywhere. The dazzling light made his eyes feel uncomfortable.

With Chick around, the high temperature was bearable. The nearby flames were swallowed by Chick.

He didn’t discover any dimensional zones within his detectable range. However, the light and fire Essence Energy on this planet were extremely terrifying. What was even more terrifying was that there was a planet nearby that emitted a terrifying glow.

Although Zhou Wen had long heard that Dubhe was a binary star-meaning that it had a companion star-he was still shocked when he saw it.

However, Zhou Wen failed to find any dimensional zones after circling the two stars for quite some time, much less the tiny palm symbol.

Strange. Could it be that the dimensional zone is inside the planet? If that’s the case, it will be difficult to find the dimensional zone without entering through the Cube. Zhou Wen looked at the planet that was even more terrifying than the sun. If he wanted to rush in, he wasn’t sure if the Prisoned Dragon armor could withstand it.

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over how to find the dimensional zone, he suddenly saw Chick’s feathers stand up as it stared intently at the flames below. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What is it?” Zhou Wen traced its gaze and saw a huge shadow flickering in the flames.

It was like a giant whale in the sea. He could only see a shadow, not enough to determine what it was.

Zhou Wen didn’t wish to take the risk as he watched it swim in the flames. The shadow looked bigger than an aircraft carrier. He planned on returning to Earth with Chick.

However, to his surprise, Chick suddenly let out a long cry and spread its wings to rush towards the shadow in the flames.
