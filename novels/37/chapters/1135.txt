Boom!

Just as Zhou Wen was looking around, he suddenly felt a violent quake beneath his feet. Then, he heard a loud crashing sound before an ear-piercing screech.

Before he could figure out what had happened, the ship’s massive body began to tilt to the side. At the same time, there was a muffled explosion.

An iceberg appeared out of nowhere, slamming into the deck. The shattered ice struck people, leaving many bleeding.

Cries and screams intertwined as the ship’s side tipped even more. Many people slid and fell. An explosion happened somewhere nearby as a heatwave surged over, sending Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi flying.

Zhou Wen had no idea where in hell he was. Not only was he unable to use Essence Energy Skills and various other abilities, but even his body had become extremely weak as though he had never cultivated.

Thankfully, although his strength and abilities were unusable, his technique and reaction remained. When Zhou Wen tumbled down, he grabbed the railing and prevented himself from falling into the sea.

Previously, Zhou Wen had doubted if Tsukuyomi could use her powers, but he quickly realized that she couldn’t. She grabbed a metal column that was taller than Zhou Wen, but the cabin beside her suddenly exploded. The fragments smashed into Tsukuyomi’s head, immediately causing her to bleed. She seemed to show signs of fainting as she fell and rolled down the deck, about to fall into the sea.

The temperature of the seawater was already below zero degrees Celsius. In the past, Zhou Wen could shower in such low temperatures, but now, his body was like an ordinary person’s. If he fell, it wouldn’t be long before all the heat in his body was sucked away by the seawater. When that happened, only death awaited him.

Zhou Wen subconsciously reached out to grab the half-conscious Tsukuyomi and pulled her over.

Although this was a good opportunity to kill Tsukuyomi, Zhou Wen felt that it was likely that the dimensional monarchs were targeting him. Tsukuyomi was suffering an undeserved catastrophe.

The enemy of an enemy was a friend. Perhaps saving Tsukuyomi today would give the dimension another Calamity-grade enemy in the future.

After all, Tsukuyomi was a natural Calamity creature born on Earth. It was somewhat different from the monarchs of the dimension.

“How are you?” Zhou Wen realized that the wound on Tsukuyomi’s forehead was very deep. It was a result of a few metal fragments stabbing into her and she was constantly bleeding. From the looks of it, the situation wasn’t good.

Tsukuyomi opened her mouth but didn’t make a sound. Her eyes had already lost their focus and she was on the brink of unconsciousness.

Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and pulled Tsukuyomi along the deck, hoping to find something that could be used as a lifeboat, even if it was just a floating plank.

Once the ship sank, ordinary humans wouldn’t be able to last long in the icy-water sludge. They had to leave the sea to have a chance of survival.

However, there were people running for their lives everywhere. Some people jumped into the sea disregarding anything, hoping to leave the ship as soon as possible to prevent themselves from being pulled into the sea by the suction force produced when the ship sank. From Zhou Wen’s point of view, it was no different from having a death wish.

Some people also found lifeboats before jumping into the sea and then using these tools to escape.

However, there were too many people who were escaping. In order to survive, many people tried their best to climb into the lifeboats near them. This resulted in overcapacity—the lifeboats capsized and everyone fell into the sea.

There were also a few crew members organizing the children and women to board the lifeboats. Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find anything that could be used as a boat.

The nearby hatch doors were all metal and couldn’t be used as rafts.

Zhou Wen could only carry Tsukuyomi and constantly run for the high ground, constantly searching, hoping to find something that could save himself.

After losing his strength, Zhou Wen realized that the strength of humans was pathetic. Just running for a while with Tsukuyomi in his arms made his heart beat vigorously. His limbs ached and he was out of breath.

Dao Sutra kept circulating intermittently. Zhou Wen also kept trying his best to engrave the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder on the Wheel of Destiny, but due to the strange power here, the difficulty of engraving it was too great. The shallow marks on the Wheel of Destiny quickly vanished, preventing him from engraving the complete Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.

Just as he was climbing up, a black shadow suddenly smashed down from above. Zhou Wen dodged to the side and the thing smashed into the metal pillar beside him. Only then did Zhou Wen realize that it was a table.

I’ve got it! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Seeing that the table was about to continue sliding down, he hurriedly rushed over and kicked it towards the surface of the sea.

After the table fell, Zhou Wen jumped down after it and fell into the sea with Tsukuyomi.

Tsukuyomi’s face was covered in blood and she was unconscious. As the seawater met her face, the blood all over her face was washed away, dyeing the nearby seawater red.

The bone-chilling seawater made Zhou Wen shiver as he hurriedly pulled the unconscious Tsukuyomi onto the floating table.

However, the table’s buoyancy couldn’t withstand their weight and sank a little. Zhou Wen’s calves were soaked in the seawater as he felt his body’s heat rapidly wick away.

Furthermore, the waves would hit them from time to time, making them shiver from the cold.

A lifeboat happened to row by at that moment. On it were a few women and children. They watched Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi as they rowed.

“Our boat allows for one more person...” a woman shouted at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen looked at the unconscious Tsukuyomi in his arms and gritted his teeth before handing her over.

The women pulled Tsukuyomi onto the lifeboat. The lifeboat’s waterline was almost at its limit, so it was impossible for Zhou Wen to board it.

Zhou Wen waved his hand at them, gesturing for them to leave.

Without Tsukuyomi’s weight, the table’s surface rose significantly, but it was still covered in the seawater. A portion of Zhou Wen’s calf remained soaked in the seawater, numbing it until it showed a purplish-black color.

At that moment, he couldn’t care less. As he paddled, he tried his best to get the top of the table surface out of the water. At the same time, he constantly engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and infused his insights from his hundred years of imprisonment into it.

Without the augmentation of Essence Energy, it was difficult to leave deep marks on the Wheel of Destiny with just his thoughts. However, with Zhou Wen’s thoughts changing, even without the augmentation of Essence Energy, the marks became deeper and deeper. Soon, Zhou Wen finally succeeded in carving out the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.

At the instant the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder appeared, Zhou Wen felt his Essence Energy surge out like a spring. It instantly nourished his body and restored his original strength. The cold seawater was no longer able to affect his body.

How did this happen? Sasser kept watching the scene on the camera. When he saw that Zhou Wen could actually use Essence Energy in the movie world, his expression turned nasty.

Although his Life Soul was magical, it could only send people into the movie world. He was unable to control the plot in the movie. All he could do was watch Zhou Wen recover his strength.

Suddenly, Sasser felt a mysterious force flow into his Life Soul, causing the movie world in the camera to change.
