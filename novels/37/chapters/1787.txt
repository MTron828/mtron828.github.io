Chapter 1788 Something Unusual

Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan, who were imprisoned on the stone pillar, had already turned into two dried corpses. Their flesh was shriveled like dried bacon.

Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan with a gloomy expression. He hoped that Wang Mingyuan could give him an explanation, hoping that the truth wasn’t what he thought.

Wang Mingyuan sighed softly and said, “Some sacrifices are inevitable to do what needs to be done.”

With that said, Zhou Wen felt as though he had fallen into an ice cavern as his body trembled uncontrollably.

“They risked their lives to come here for you.” Zhou Wen’s voice trembled uncontrollably.

“Therefore, I want them to die for a reason,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“You were plotting against them from the beginning?” Zhou Wen still had a sliver of hope as he asked Wang Mingyuan.

“It’s not just them. Including you, I chose all my students because you guys have the talent I need.” Wang Mingyuan’s honesty left Zhou Wen speechless.

Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan in silence. Jiang Yan treated Wang Mingyuan like a mentor in life, and Zhong Ziya treated Wang Mingyuan like a father.

Even Zhou Wen himself treated Wang Mingyuan as a good teacher worthy of respect.

However, he never expected that Wang Mingyuan had been plotting against them from the beginning.

“If you want to do something extraordinary, you have to use extreme means. I had no other choice,” Wang Mingyuan said indifferently.

“What about Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan? Didn’t they have other choices as well? But they chose you,” Zhou Wen said coldly as he looked at Wang Mingyuan.

......

“They chose me, but I chose the entire world. There’s no contradiction,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“Teacher, this is the last time I’ll call you that. I hope you won’t regret your choice in the future,” Zhou Wen said as he turned to leave.

“You can leave, but leave the two swords behind.” Wang Mingyuan stopped Zhou Wen.

“What if I say no?” Zhou Wen stopped but didn’t turn his head.

“I’ve already lost two disciples. I don’t wish to lose a third.” Wang Mingyuan sighed.

Zhou Wen ignored Wang Mingyuan and walked to the side of the Immortal Peril Sword, about to pull it out.

Bang!

Wang Mingyuan waved his sleeve gently as a force surged towards Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen slashed out with his backhand at the surging undercurrent, but it was as though he had struck a spring.

His powerful force was completely absorbed before it erupted, sending Zhou Wen flying.

In midair, he felt the hand holding the Immortal Culling Sword tremble as it uncontrollably left his hand. When Zhou Wen stabilized himself and looked again, he saw that the Immortal Peril Sword and Immortal Culling Sword were already in Wang Mingyuan’s hands.

Zhou Wen gathered his strength as his fists erupted with infinite strength as he struck at Wang Mingyuan. However, Wang Mingyuan, who was inches away, seemed to be in another world. No matter how ferocious his punches were, they couldn’t injure Wang Mingyuan at all.

It was the power of Transcendent Immortal, but not completely. It was even stranger than Transcendent Immortal’s powers.

Zhou Wen knew very well that it was impossible for him to defeat Wang Mingyuan today.

This was because the current Wang Mingyuan wasn’t only Wang Mingyuan. Not only did he have the power of Transcendent Immortal, but the attack he used to snatch the swords previously had the inklings of Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya, perhaps even more.

Jiang Yan could use external forces for his own. Zhong Ziya could infinitely stimulate his evolution. Such talent and ability were now used by Wang Mingyuan. Furthermore, he had successfully advanced to the Apocalypse grade after absorbing the power of Transcendent Immortal.

Ignoring Zhou Wen, even in the dimension, it was difficult to say if anyone could defeat him.

Wang Mingyuan ignored Zhou Wen as his hands moved slightly. The Immortal Peril Sword and Immortal Culling Sword rose up as two other swords flew out of Wang Mingyuan’s sleeve.

The four swords had different shapes, but they gave off a mysterious feeling.

In the next second, the four swords gathered together. At the instant they collided, they fused into one, turning into a sword that floated beneath Wang Mingyuan’s feet.

“If we can meet again, everything will end.” Wang Mingyuan glanced at Zhou Wen before turning around and riding the sword away. The white-robed sword shadow vanished into the horizon in the blink of an eye.

Zhou Wen looked in the direction Wang Mingyuan had vanished with a complicated expression. Finally, he could only smile bitterly and walk towards Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s skeletons.

“Let’s… go home…” Zhou Wen carried the two skeletons and left the divine mountain, feeling mixed emotions.

After returning to Guide Ancient City, Zhou Wen buried Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s corpses on a hill outside the city. He looked at their tombstones and was at a loss for words.

“F*ck, Wang Mingyuan is really a piece of trash. I’ve never seen such a shameless person. You guys risked your lives for him, but he still schemed against all of you. He’s inhumane. Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s deaths weren’t worth it,” Li Xuan said angrily.

“That’s their choice. At the very least, they met it calmly in death,” Zhou Wen said slowly.

“What bullsh*t calmness? Do you know what people are saying now?” Li Xuan hesitated.

Even if Zhou Wen didn’t know, he could guess what people would say.

“It doesn’t matter what they say. The dead can’t be revived.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about what others said.

“Well said. The dead hold the least value. Why don’t you put some thought into saving your life?” A hoarse voice sounded.

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan turned their heads and saw an elder walking over with a strange smile.

“Jing Daoxian? What are you doing here?” Zhou Wen asked the elder with a frown.

“I’m here to save your lives, of course,” Jing Daoxian said with a faint smile. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You should save your life first,” Li Xuan said coldly.

Jing Daoxian thought nothing of it. He walked to the tombstone and said with infinite regret, “What a pity.”

“What about?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Unfortunately, their powers weren’t used by me. Otherwise, the dimensional king wouldn’t be Wang Mingyuan, but me.” Jing Daoxian sighed. “What do you mean?” Li Xuan asked with a frown.

“Kid, are you really stupid or are you pretending to be stupid? Why did Wang Mingyuan do so many things? With the ability to infinitely evolve and transform all powers for his own use, coupled with the power of Transcendent Immortal helping him advance to the Apocalypse grade, what else could it be for? Just watch. If he doesn’t die, he will soon become the king who controls the entire dimension,” Jing Daoxian said with a twitch of his lips.

Zhou Wen had already roughly guessed it, but Li Xuan’s mouth gaped open in surprise. After a while, he said, “From what you’re saying, Wang Mingyuan wants to turn himself into a devil. To subdue the devils as a devil sounds rather tragic.”

“Hehe, I’m just afraid that he will end up becoming the most lethal devil king,” Jing Daoxian said with a sneer.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“What do I mean… Hehe… I’m afraid Wang Mingyuan hates humans more than the monsters from the dimension…” Jing Daoxian said with a strange laugh.
