Chapter 1111: The Missing Guardian

Translator: CKtalon

Where did Grim Demon go? As Zhou Wen retreated, he looked around, but he didn’t see Grim Demon.

Grim Demon had also entered the cube’s arena from this area. He should still be here after admitting defeat.

Previously, he hadn’t seen Grim Demon participate in the group battle of the top ten Guardians. Now that he couldn’t be found, Zhou Wen wondered if he had already been killed. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Previously, Grim Demon had publicly pledged his loyalty. It was definitely impossible for the dimension to let him fight. It wasn’t impossible to think of a way to kill him.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to look for Grim Demon. Truth Listener had already pounced over with its heavily injured body. It had forcefully shattered six earrings and entered the Calamity grade. The many latent dangers were now apparent. Not only had it severed its connection with Zhou Wen, but even its emotions seemed to become extremely unstable; it was filled with ruthlessness and malice.

However, its injuries were too serious. Even though it had Calamity-grade strength, it didn’t have much of it left.

Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy, who sent Truth Listener tumbling away with a mouthful of Supreme Yin Wind.

Zhou Wen hurriedly restrained Banana Fairy to prevent her from killing Truth Listener.

He was the one who had forcefully removed six of Truth Listener’s earrings. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have turned into this state. If it wasn’t for Truth Listener, it would have been impossible for it to hold back Di Tian for so long and give Zhou Wen the time to use the Immortal Culling Sword.

However, Truth Listener’s mind seemed to be completely out of control. It got up and dragged its injured body over in another charge.

Banana Fairy sensed Zhou Wen’s thoughts, but she only blew out the wind barrier, preventing Truth Listener from rushing over. She didn’t injure it again.

How can I make Truth Listener return to its sealed state with six earrings? Zhou Wen attempted to give Truth Listener orders, but it was useless.

In fact, Zhou Wen’s body was also severely injured. Even with the help of Slaughterer and Sigh of the King, as well as Demonic Neonate’s help, Zhou Wen’s body was still severely injured. His body was on the brink of collapse, and he was so emaciated that he was only skin and bones. He didn’t look fine like before.

He would recover with time, but Slaughterer Life Soul had nearly been sucked dry. The Wheel of Destiny had also nearly collapsed. Although he didn’t know how Sigh of the King was, it definitely didn’t have things easy after paying such a huge price.

Zhou Wen’s body was like a hole-ridden ship that had expended all its fuel. It was definitely not an easy task to set sail again.

He attempted to circulate his Essence Energy Art, but as his Essence Energy was depleted, even the Lost Immortal Sutra couldn’t circulate normally, much less inscribe other Essence Energy Arts on the Wheel of Destiny. This made Zhou Wen’s plan of using Chaos Egg to heal himself fail.

Meanwhile, Truth Listener was still trying to charge through the wind barrier again and again. However, it was too heavily injured and had no strength to break through the wind barrier. All it did was roar and charge.

However, if this continued, Truth Listener would probably die soon.

Suddenly, a figure walked out of the cube, giving Zhou Wen a fright.

Only he and Grim Demon had entered the arena from this cube. Grim Demon had long come out. Now, the ones who could come out of the cube were most likely dimensional creatures.

If another powerhouse like Di Tian appeared, Zhou Wen would be powerless to deal with him.

Even with the Immortal Culling Sword in hand, Zhou Wen didn’t have the ability to use it again.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he identified the person walking out of the cube.

Previously, in the battle with Blood Shaman, there had been eight Guardians. However, other than Grim Demon and Burial Immortal, there should only have been seven Guardians in the top ten. He didn’t know why there was one more.

Later, when Zhou Wen had used Immortal Slaying, he only killed seven Guardians. One of them had vanished into thin air.

Back then, Zhou Wen had some doubts, but he didn’t have the time to think carefully. Now that he saw that the person was the Guardian who had mysteriously appeared and vanished, he immediately guessed something.

The fact that he could come out meant that he had entered the cube’s arena through this cube. Then, he could assume the reason for Grim Demon’s disappearance.

This Guardian must have killed Grim Demon and replaced him before entering the arena.

However, there was something Zhou Wen didn’t understand. If he had the ability to eliminate Grim Demon, it meant that he was at least at the Terror grade. Why hadn’t he used his strength to fight him in the previous battle?

The Guardian slowly walked over as a terrifying aura rose from his body. The strength of this aura was definitely not inferior to Grim Demon’s.

In the next second, the Guardian attacked, but his target wasn’t Zhou Wen. With a wave of his hand, he grabbed Truth Listener.

The huge Truth Listener automatically shrank when it approached his palm and quickly became the size of a palm. At the same time, the six earrings appeared again and clamped onto its six ears.

Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated when he saw this. Such means were definitely not something an ordinary Terror-grade could muster. The Guardian’s origins were unimaginable.

The Guardian grabbed Truth Listener with one hand and slashed at Zhou Wen with the other.

Banana Fairy didn’t wait for Zhou Wen’s instructions as she immediately stood in front of him. She pouted her red lips and blew out boundless wind. With the augmentation of the Three Realms’ Best Wind, the boundless wind nearly blew the entire town away.

However, the Guardian’s sleeves didn’t budge at all. His hand blade tore through the wind like a sharp blade, circled around Banana Fairy, and instantly arrived in front of Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen didn’t even have the chance to summon his Companion Beasts to block the attack before the hand blade reached his neck.

Zhou Wen cursed inwardly. He was too heavily injured, so it was impossible for him to dodge. All he could do was close his eyes and wait for death.

I never expected that I, Zhou Wen, would die here. Zhou Wen closed his eyes and waited for death, but the attack didn’t come.

Feeling that something was amiss, he opened his eyes and realized that the Guardian was standing in front of him with a smile. The saber hadn’t slashed down, and he no longer looked like a Guardian. Instead, he was a refined man in white with crystal dragon horns on his head.

“Teacher...” Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted. He felt as though he had instantly returned to heaven from hell.

“Well done.” Wang Mingyuan smiled at Zhou Wen and reached out to press his head. A strange force surged into Zhou Wen’s body, immediately making him feel as though he was bathing in a hot spring. The injuries on his body quickly healed.

“Teacher, there’s no need for such praises.” Zhou Wen blushed slightly.

To his surprise, Wang Mingyuan rapped his knuckles on the top of his head and pursed his lips. “Do you really think I’m praising you? You’re in big trouble now. Didn’t I tell you not to come again? Why did you come to participate in the cube battle and end up in first place again? Do you really think that the dimension will give you the Dimensional Wheel? Or do you think they will just let it go?”

Zhou Wen said helplessly, “I also know that they won’t give me the Dimensional Wheel, but I couldn’t just watch them kill Zhong Ziya without doing anything, right?”

“Who told you that Ziya is dead?” Wang Mingyuan said, a little peeved.

“Didn’t he sign a bet with the Guardian... Could it be that his bet wasn’t to come in first?” Zhou Wen immediately came to a realization.
