Chapter 1645 Source of All Evil

As the Treasurefall Money shattered, Xiao immediately returned to normal. When his body moved, it was as though he had an illusion that followed him. It was as though he was swimming between nothingness and reality. “Impossible!” Toad Immortal was still in disbelief as he used all his strength to activate his Money Domain.

However, under the influence of Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain, the effects of the Money Domain were completely eliminated. It couldn’t affect Zhou Wen and company in the Teacher Domain at all.

When Zhou Wen used the Teacher Domain to scan the Treasurefall Money, he completed the final piece of the puzzle. The trajectories in the Teacher Domain transformed into streams of light that fell into the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and condensed Source of All Evil.

With the birth of the Essence Energy Art, the Teacher Domain immediately had a restraining effect on the Money Domain. Wherever the Teacher Domain was, the Money Domain could no longer produce any effects.

Even Treasurefall Money was affected. Under the restraint of the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen easily crushed it.

We are finally back at the starting line again. Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. They finally had the capital to fight Toad Immortal.

Before Zhou Wen could take action, Xiao had already stood forward. His eyes narrowed as he stared at Toad Immortal in midair.

Toad Immortal’s heart skipped a beat. He was the very impressive and strong Toad Immortal, but all of this was built on the effectiveness of the Money Domain and the Treasurefall Money. Toad Immortal had relied on this unique skill to survive while wreaking havoc in the Queen Mother of the West’s dimensional zone.

Now that the Money Domain had lost its effects and the Treasurefall Money ability had been cracked by Zhou Wen, Toad Immortal immediately lost most of his confidence.

Despite both being at the Heaven level, he had seen Xiao’s combat strength. Without the Money Domain and Treasurefall Money, Toad Immortal knew that he was probably no match for Xiao, much less Jiuyang and Zhou Wen.

Toad Immortal knew the principle of “where there’s life, there’s hope.” He turned around and wanted to escape. It wouldn’t be too late to think of a way to deal with Zhou Wen when he wasn’t with the others.

However, to Toad Immortal’s surprise, just as he turned around, he saw Xiao behind him. He was smiling at him, but the smile made Toad Immortal’s back turn cold. Cold sweat flowed down his forehead.

“F*ck you.” Toad Immortal suddenly exerted strength as the golden light on his golden robe trembled. He spat out a piece of Treasurefall Money that shot at Xiao.

However, in the Teacher Domain, no matter how his golden robe trembled, the Money Domain was useless. The Treasurefall Money wasn’t as terrifying as before. Although it could still be shot out, Xiao easily dodged it.

Pa! Pa!

Xiao appeared in front of Toad Immortal like a ghost. His palm struck back and forth, slapping Toad Immortal’s head left and right. His face was about to be smashed in, and the sound of bones cracking could be heard clearly.

IS

Toad Immortal waved his hands, hoping to fight Xiao to the death. However, when he pounced on Xiao, he only managed to hit an illusion. Another Xiao appeared behind him. His leg slashed at Toad Immortal’s waist like a blade, sending him flying. Zhou Wen only saw Xiao’s phantoms surrounding Toad Immortal and attacking him crazily. He couldn’t tell which was the illusion and which was the real deal. Both seemed capable of swapping between themselves at any time, causing Toad Immortal to cry out in pain from the lashing. He swayed back and forth like a roly-poly. Blood constantly splattered out with Xiao’s attacks as countless bones in his body were fractured. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“We agreed that everything on him will be mine.” Zhou Wen was somewhat anxious when he saw this.

If this continued, Toad Immortal would definitely be killed by Xiao. When the time came, Zhou Wen might not be able to catch up to him if Xiao ran off with something.

Bang!

Xiao’s final kick struck Toad Immortal’s head, smashing it right into his chest.

Toad Immortal’s body crashed into the planet like a comet, creating a huge ring-shaped crater. His mangled body no longer looked human.

“I’ll naturally keep my promise,” Xiao said indifferently without any intention of picking up the corpse.

Zhou Wen didn’t care as he rushed over to loot the corpse.

What Zhou Wen wanted the most was Toad Immortal’s Calamity Essence. This was because Toad Immortal’s domain power was the power of taboo. This was similar to the Teacher Domain’s attributes. Perhaps Toad Immortal’s Calamity Essence could raise the Teacher Domain to the Hell level or even the Heaven level.

In that case, even without the augmentation of the Dragon King armor and eight Companion Beasts, Zhou Wen could fight a Heaven-level expert.

Zhou Wen hoped that Toad Immortal’s body had the Calamity Essence, but before he could go over, Toad Immortal’s body moved.

“He’s still alive?” Zhou Wen and Xiao were taken aback.

No matter how one looked at the injuries Toad Immortal suffered, he was doomed. He wasn’t a Calamity creature that was good at recovery. It was impossible for him to survive.

Just as the two of them were feeling puzzled, Toad Immortal’s body staggered as he stood up.

His actions were very strange, his body jerking like a zombie. In the next second, large amounts of white matter surged out of Toad Immortal’s body and instantly enveloped his body.

“That’s… the Companion Beast of this planet… It’s not dead yet…” Zhou Wen and company immediately knew what it was. Indeed, after the white matter devoured Toad Immortal’s body, it quickly distorted and shrank. Soon, it turned into the strange white jade-like Companion Beast.

It didn’t suffer any apparent injuries, much less be devoured and digested by Toad Immortal.

Furthermore, from the looks of it, its body had become even more majestic. It was clearly much taller and stronger than before. Its aura had also become stronger.

“Be careful. This Companion Beast is very good at devouring and imitating.” Xiao looked at the Companion Beast with a heavy expression.

Previously, the Companion Beast could imitate his psyche mutation state and combat strength. Now that it had devoured Toad Immortal, Xiao was worried that it had even imitated Toad Immortal’s abilities.

The facts proved that Xiao’s worries weren’t unnecessary. The Companion Beast swept its gaze at everyone as its body suddenly emitted a powerful golden light. Ancient coins shot out from its body.

“Holy sh*t!” Zhou Wen exclaimed in surprise as his eyes widened. Not only had the Companion Beast learned Toad Immortal’s abilities, but he had also made them stronger.

Previously, when Toad Immortal used the Money Domain, the money that formed the domain was only ordinary money. Only the ancient coin condensed in his mouth was Treasurefall Money.

However, the golden ancient coins that emitted from the Companion Beast’s body were all Treasurefall Money, forming a domain made of Treasurefall Money.

The power of the Teacher Domain could indeed restrain the Treasurefall Money, but it wasn’t as easy as restraining the Money Domain. Now that the entire domain was made of Treasurefall Money, the effects of the Teacher Domain on the Money Domain immediately weakened.

Thankfully, in the Teacher Domain, the Money Domain still couldn’t be of much use.

Hum!

The Companion Beast’s body tore through the void and instantly appeared in front of Xiao.
