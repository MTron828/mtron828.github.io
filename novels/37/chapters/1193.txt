Chapter 1194: Terror Deva

Zhou Wen planned on experimenting on a Crimson Deva to see if Truth Listener and Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder were of any use.

It was better to try it on a Mythical Crimson Deva than a Terror-grade Deva.

He continued walking along the mountain path, hoping to find another Crimson Deva. However, after walking for a short while, he saw a female Deva emitting a lotus-like golden light flying towards him.

As he hadn’t seen the gold-glowing Deva enter her Terror transformation, Zhou Wen didn’t know if she was at the Terror-level. He hesitated without charging forward. Instead, he summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and made it charge at her.

Zhou Wen wanted to give it a try. He wanted to see if the attributes of Deva’s Five Signs of Decay, Luck, and Fortune were effective against the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, a Companion Beast filled with negative powers.

In any case, the Jinxes Master skill was a sore point for Zhou Wen. He wouldn’t feel the pinch even if the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General died.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General charged forward, brandishing the Demonic Spear to stab at the gold-glowing Deva. Like the others, she did not attack; she only circled around the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and dodged its attack.

However, the golden lotus flower that emitted from her body fused into the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body upon contact. It was probably the same as the ability of the Crimson Deva. It had the effects of the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay, but it was unknown if it was the Lesser or Greater version.

After a while, Zhou Wen revealed a look of pleasant surprise. Not only was the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General unaffected by the gold-glowing Deva, but the demonic purple flames in its body became even more exuberant due to the infusion of the golden lotus.

From the looks of it, not only can the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay not bring misfortune to the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, but it will also accelerate his strengthening. Zhou Wen observed for a while and found the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General becoming stronger and stronger. The gold-glowing Deva was in a sorry state from the pursuit, with several wounds over her body.

Her Deva’s Five Signs of Decay didn’t have much effect on the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Luck and Fortune skills didn’t seem to be of much use either. They were completely restrained by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

Before long, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General slew the gold-glowing Deva with his spear. Unfortunately, nothing dropped.

The gold-glowing Deva’s speed and strength were stronger than the Crimson Deva, but it was still within the range of the Mythical stage. It hadn’t reached the Terror grade.

Knowing that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General could also restrain Deva’s Five Signs of Decay, Zhou Wen felt much better. He charged forward with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and later encountered several Crimson Devas and gold-glowing Devas.

After experimenting, Zhou Wen found that although Truth Listener’s Evil Annihilation was effective against the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay, it couldn’t completely eliminate it.

As for the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, it could perfectly restrain the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay. As long as he activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, the Devas didn’t pose any harm to Zhou Wen.

This put Zhou Wen at greater ease. Even if he encountered a Terror-grade Deva, he would be invincible against them.

However, along the way, Zhou Wen didn’t discover any clues related to Ouyang Lan. This made him suspect if Ouyang Lan had come to Deva Realm. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Were we wrong? Did Sis Lan predict that An Tianzuo would have the same thought process as us, so she did the opposite and went to the Asura Realm?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

The antelope looked at the mountain path ahead and wrote on the ground, “It’s also possible. However, we are already here. Don’t you want to go up and take a look?”

“You are the one who wants to go up, right? What’s up there?” Zhou Wen felt that the antelope might not have taken this path to save Ouyang Lan from the beginning.

The antelope seemed to know that it had to say something. It wrote, “There’s something on the mountain that can help Chick complete a Terror transformation. Even if the person you are looking for isn’t there, this trip won’t be for nothing.”

“What is it?” Zhou Wen continued asking.

“I’m not sure if that thing is still there. Let’s go up and take a look first.” The antelope refused to say anything as it continued walking with its head lowered.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and followed. He wasn’t sure if Ouyang Lan had come to Deva Realm, but since he was already here, he decided to continue his search.

As Zhou Wen walked, he carved on the Wheel of Destiny, maintaining his Terror form to deal with any unexpected situations.

With the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General leading the way, he killed quite a number of Crimson Devas and a few gold-glowing Devas. A skill crystal dropped from a Crimson Deva.

Zhou Wen didn’t immediately absorb it. Instead, he put it away and continued on the path.

It was unknown how high the mountain was. Zhou Wen estimated that they had already climbed a few thousand meters, but they still couldn’t see the peak. It was difficult to imagine how huge the mountain was.

Clang!

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General killed another gold-glowing Deva and a Companion Egg dropped.

Zhou Wen was delighted as he picked up the Companion Egg and hatched it. The Companion Beast he hatched was called Golden Deva.

The Golden Deva’s attributes were very similar to that of Crimson Immortal. The only difference was that its Life Soul was called Golden Body Glow. The other attributes were basically the same.

Even the Wheel of Destiny was the Lesser Deva’s Five Signs of Decay. The Greater Deva’s Five Signs of Decay that Zhou Wen had expected didn’t appear.

He continued on his way and when he arrived at a platform, Zhou Wen’s heart couldn’t help but skip a beat. He saw a divine altar on the platform. Sitting on it was a Deva. The Deva was clearly different from the previous ones.

The glow over his body was black. Furthermore, without using the Wheel of Destiny, he couldn’t be seen.

Terror-grade Deva! Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated. He originally wanted the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to return, but to his surprise, it charged forward as though it could see the Terror-grade Deva.

The Devas from before didn’t seem to attack, but the black-glowing Deva was different. Just as the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General charged over, he threw a slap.

A black beam tore out of his palm and instantly struck the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, sending it flying back. He slammed into the mountain wall, and his fiend armor caved in.

When Zhou Wen saw this, he hurriedly retracted the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Although he had the urge to kill it at times, he couldn’t stand seeing it suffer serious injuries.

After condensing the Sword Pill, Zhou Wen used the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and used Clown Mask to teleport. He arrived behind the black-glowing Deva and slashed at his head.

Unfortunately, the black-glowing Deva turned his body in a seemingly prescient move and dodged Zhou Wen’s strike.

Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated, but he didn’t stop. As he constantly teleported, he thrust out Sword Pill again and again. Every strike was extremely bizarre, making it impossible to dodge.

Strangely, no matter how fast Zhou Wen’s teleportation was or how accurate his strike was, it was dodged by the black-glowing Deva. It was as though he could predict the future. He could dodge any of Zhou Wen’s attacks ahead of time. No matter how fast the sword was, it was difficult for it to injure him.
