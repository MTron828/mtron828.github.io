Chapter 1339: Comprehending the Lunar Mansions

Zhou Wen could still rely on his Lucky Dodge to protect himself, but the antelope relied on its own strength to withstand the sword array. Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the antelope was quite powerful.

Although the antelope couldn’t rush out of the sword array, it managed to withstand wave after wave of sword array attacks. It had all sorts of means—one moment, it would spew lightning, and the next moment, it would use wind and fire. It was unknown what attributes it had, but it seemed to be able to easily control all kinds of elemental abilities.

Although the antelope was already very impressive, it could only barely protect itself in the sword array. It was still in a sorry state.

“Starlady, no matter what, we suffered together back then and were good comrades who fought bosses together. There’s no need to be so ruthless, right? If you’re really angry, you can just beat that punk up to vent your anger. Why make things difficult for an old friend? If it doesn’t appease you, I’ll help you beat him up.” The antelope spoke with emotion and reason.

Unexpectedly, Starlady Polestar didn’t buy it at all. She snorted and said, “We suffered together? I never expected that from you? When we were trapped in the Crystal Palace, we were almost exhausted, but you secretly ate and drank well. Afraid of being discovered by us, you pretended to be on your deathbed and wanted to trick us into handing over our inheritance. I can’t afford to have a friend like you, nor do I have a comrade like you.”

The antelope blushed, but it was thick-skinned after all. Having experienced all kinds of upheavals, it coughed to hide its embarrassment and changed the topic. “Let’s not talk about the past. Last time, I got that punk to dig you out and take you back to Forbidden City. It was really out of good intentions. I originally planned to get that punk to form a contract with you and help you find a good contractor, but who knew that things would turn out this way? I still treat you as a friend from the bottom of my heart and consider your wellbeing, Starlady. That punk is a rare genius. Others fought over each other for him, but I couldn’t bear to give him to them. Instead, I brought him to you…”

“Him? You have the nerve to call a person who relies on luck a rare genius?” Starlady Polestar mocked.

She could long tell that Zhou Wen relied on his Lucky Dodge to dodge the sword array’s attacks.

“Starlady, let’s not talk about anything else, but how many people can advance to the Mythical stage as humans? Even in our era, you haven’t seen many, right? He hasn’t contracted a Guardian yet. It’s not too late for you to contract him now.” The antelope tried its best to persuade her, but its situation was getting worse. Sword beams had already swept past its body and shaved off its fur.

“Oh, he advanced to the Mythical stage purely as a human?” Starlady Polestar finally sized up Zhou Wen seriously.

“It’s absolutely true. If I lie, I’ll give my head to you to kick like a ball.” The antelope swore an oath, wishing it could bear its heart to Starlady Polestar.

“So what if I am? Do I need to borrow the power of humans? As long as I am willing, even if I contract with a piece of trash, I can rule the world.” Starlady Polestar said indifferently, “You don’t have to waste your breath. No matter what you say, you will die without a doubt today.”

After she finished speaking, a star crown appeared on her forehead. The stars in the sky resonated with it. The stars that were originally hidden in the universe and couldn’t be seen appeared one after another, almost occupying the entire sky.

Starlight descended the very next moment as if the end of the world had arrived. Everything visible to the naked eye was occupied by starlight.

“F*ck, you old b*tch, am I not submissive enough?? Do you really think that I have nothing on me?” When Ol’ Ante saw this scene, it immediately ripped off its facade and returned to how it was previously—a hooligan. It opened its mouth and spat out a talisman. At the same time, the blood it spat out landed on the talisman, causing it to emit a bright light and forcefully block the sky above.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The starlight fell on the canopy-like spiritual talisman. Like steel nails piercing into a steel plate, half of them pierced through. Soon, the spiritual talisman was like a hedgehog.

Blood kept gushing out of the antelope’s mouth as it frantically injected its Essence Energy into the spirit talisman to prevent it from shattering.

However, every starlight that stabbed the spirit talisman caused the antelope’s body to tremble. The more starlight that fell, the more the antelope trembled, and the more blood it bled from its mouth.

Starlady Polestar originally didn’t pay attention to Zhou Wen. She knew what kind of ability Lucky Dodge was and how to crack it. Under the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, starlight fell en masse and there was no space to dodge. It was useless no matter how high the probability of Lucky Dodge was. It was ultimately difficult to escape death.

However, moments later, Starlady Polestar realized that Zhou Wen wasn’t dead. She was somewhat surprised; she took a closer look and couldn’t help but be alarmed.

Starlight shimmered around Zhou Wen as though he was surrounded by a galaxy. The stellar sword beams that landed on him were like rain falling into the sea. They fused into the stellar halo around him, causing it to glow brighter and stronger.

“The twenty-eight Lunar Mansions?” Starlady Polestar looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.

She was the Lady of the Stars, so how could she not recognize the power Zhou Wen used?

Due to the lack of one Lunar Mansion skill, Zhou Wen had never used the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. By observing Starlady Polestar’s Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, he found the part he was lacking. He reverse engineered the Lunar Mansion skill he lacked and finally gathered all twenty-eight.

Using Singularity Universe to power the twenty-eight Lunar Mansion skills and constantly observing the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, he finally understood why the twenty-eight Lunar Mansion skills were so difficult to obtain despite their low levels.

These skills were not as simple as individual skills. Like the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, they could form an array, and its power would increase by several times. Even if it was a low-level skill, after combining 28 skills into an array, its power was immeasurable.

However, it was somewhat different from Starlady Polestar’s starlight sword array which focused on offense. Zhou Wen’s Lunar Mansion skills focused on defense.

The defensive net formed by the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions array could not only resist the external forces, but it could also absorb external Essence Energy.

If it were any other Guardian’s power, the Lunar Mansions array might not have been able to withstand it in the beginning, nor would it have absorbed the powers so smoothly.

However, the starlight sword array and the Lunar Mansions array shared the same origin. They were almost of the same attribute. After the starlight fell into the Lunar Mansions array, it was immediately absorbed without any rejection. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This made Zhou Wen’s Lunar Mansions array stronger and stronger. Furthermore, by observing the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Zhou Wen constantly perfected the Lunar Mansions array.

After Starlady Polestar watched for a while, the surprise on her face deepened. Zhou Wen’s Lunar Mansions array wasn’t limited to the variations of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. It had even begun to evolve in the direction of the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.
