Chapter 817: Civilized Country

Translator: CKtalon

In front of Chess Mountain’s mountain wall, there was a strange flower with a flower bud hanging down, as though it was looking at a girl beneath.

“An Jing, you should already have gotten the answer, right?” A voice sounded from the flower. It was The Thearch’s voice.

“Yes, I already have an answer. I promise you,” An Jing said calmly.

“A wise decision. With my help, not only can you obtain powerful Mythical Companion Beasts, but you can also obtain the Guardian’s favor. Soon, you will be stronger than the person you want to defeat,” The Thearch said.

“I don’t believe that I’ll be stronger than him just because I have these,” An Jing said.

The Thearch asked with piqued interest, “In that case, why did you agree?”

“Just because I want to become stronger,” An Jing said.

“Alright, as you wish. You will become stronger than all humans.” With The Thearch’s voice, a passageway opened up on Chess Mountain’s mountain wall. An Jing walked in.

...

Zhou Wen didn’t know that An Jing had also encountered The Thearch. At that moment, he was still desperately being killed by the Bright Torch Vision World. The blood-colored avatar had died countless times. It had died repeatedly for days.

Finally, after Zhou Wen used Lost Country’s teleportation ability, the Lost Country ring suddenly produced a powerful spatial fluctuation.

Half of the ghost face on the Lost Country ring looked very ugly, while the other half looked very beautiful, like an angel and devil coexisting.

At that moment, eyes on the ghost face emitted a strange spatial fluctuation as they shimmered with a strange light.

Click... Click... Click... Click...

A sound suddenly came from the eyes, like the sound produced when a mechanical needle spun. Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that there was a wheel in each of the ghost face’s eyes. There were markings on the wheel, but the markings were very strange. It wasn’t the marking of time which Zhou Wen was familiar with, nor was it a unit of length. He didn’t know what it meant.

The two wheels in the ghost face’s eyes kept spinning. The clicking sounds came from the spinning wheels.

When both wheels finished one revolution, they stopped. A notification appeared in the game.

‘Lost Country Life Soul has advanced to Civilized Country. It’s currently an Evolved Body.’

Civilized Country (Evolved Body): A lost country, but the origins of civilization.

During his advancement, Zhou Wen had also gained some information about Civilized Country. He had a simple understanding of it. To truly understand it, he needed to figure it out himself.

Compared to Lost Country that could only allow him to teleport once every twenty-four hours, Civilized Country was much better. The markings in the ghost face’s eyes represented coordinates.

After adjusting the coordinates, he could do a long-distance teleportation once every twenty-four hours.

There was also the short-distance teleportation he had used previously. He could use it ten times in twenty-four hours.

I’m one step closer to infinite teleportation. Zhou Wen was rather satisfied with Civilized Country’s abilities, but he didn’t know how to determine the coordinates.

The markings in the ghost face’s eyes were different. They looked very strange.

Could it be longitude and latitude? Zhou Wen still didn’t understand how to set the coordinates. It wouldn’t be good if he made a mistake and was teleported into a pot of boiling oil or a female bathroom.

Forget it. I’ll study it in the future. It wouldn’t be too late when I raise Civilized Country to a Perfect Body. Zhou Wen continued letting Torch Dragon use Bright Torch Vision World to kill the blood-colored avatar.

However, Zhou Wen realized that the energy obtained from the blood-colored avatar’s death was nearly indiscernible.

I can only obtain this much energy every time I die. When will Civilized Country advance to the Perfect stage? I’m afraid it won’t be enough even if I drain all my blood.

Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t continue down this path. He had to think of another solution.

“Young Master Wen, have you seen the news?” Just as he was thinking, An Sheng called.

“What news?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

Recently, he had been grinding dungeons. At best, he would take some time out to buy some food and daily necessities for Ya’er. He didn’t have the time to watch the news.

“Take a look at the headlines in Luoyang today,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what major event had happened. He looked online and immediately saw a striking picture. It was a seraphim with six wings. To be precise, it was a woman wearing angel armor. She was killing a break-out creature.

Eh, isn’t this the six-winged seraphim John contracted in the past? He found a new contractor? Zhou Wen was delighted as he asked An Sheng, “Is this a picture of Luoyang?”

Zhou Wen thought that if the six-winged seraphim was still in Luoyang, there was hope for his Slaughterer advancement.

If he wanted to kill a Guardian, he had to do so as soon as possible. According to the silver-haired Companion Beast, Guardians could continue growing. After contracting with humans, they could even reach the Calamity grade with the help of humans.

Killing them would only become harder in the future.

“Yes, it’s in a dimensional zone near Luoyang. I originally thought that the Guardian had already left, but I never expected it to still be nearby. Furthermore, there’s a new contractor,” An Sheng said.

“Can you still find him now?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I’ve already sent someone to investigate. I’ll keep you informed,” An Sheng said again. “Madam wants you to take Ya’er home for a meal.”

“Alright.” After spending so much time in his dorm, Zhou Wen had reached a bottleneck with Civilized Country. He planned on heading out to take a breather.

While he played games every day, Ya’er sat alone in his dormitory. He wondered if she would develop any psychological problems over time.

After getting An Sheng to make the appointment, Zhou Wen took Ya’er to visit Ouyang Lan.

It was rare for Zhou Lingfeng to be here today. As Zhou Wen seldom came to the An family home, he seldom saw him.

However, Zhou Wen was used to it. Before Zhou Lingfeng married Ouyang Lan, he was often away, so he didn’t find it a problem.

During the meal, Ouyang Lan mentioned what Zhou Lingfeng had been doing. Only then did Zhou Wen know that he had been translating a book for a long time. He was almost done.

“What kind of book is it?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

With Ouyang Lan around, Zhou Lingfeng shouldn’t need to do any ordinary translation work. The books he was translating weren’t just for money.

Zhou Lingfeng said, “It’s a book from a small country in the South District before the dimensional storms. As that language wasn’t very developed and was mixed with many symbols, the translation work wasn’t progressing smoothly...”

Zhou Wen listened for a while but failed to figure out anything. He wasn’t too interested in language work.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
