Chapter 895: Primordial Human Sovereign

Translator: CKtalon

Only one’s life can ignite vital essence. Zhou Wen already understood the true meaning of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. He forcefully used his life force as a catalyst to detonate the boundless vital life essence which Defy Ancient Sovereign had gathered.

As his vital essence erupted, the Defy Ancient Sovereign rapidly transformed and was instantly pushed to a Perfect Body.

The Defy Ancient Sovereign’s Perfect Body fused at a deeper level with Zhou Wen’s body. The effects on his body were even more direct and intense.

Primordial Human Sovereign? Zhou Wen had already sensed the information gained from the new Life Soul and knew its name.

Badump! Badump!

The beating of his heart combined with the power of the Primordial Human Sovereign. His heart was like a sun that emitted infinite light and heat. The light and heat made Zhou Wen’s entire body seem to burn. Every inch of his cells was filled with intense vital essence, like a humanoid sun of vital essence.

Even Feng Qiuyan and company, who were by the side of the arena, could sense the intense vitality emitted by Zhou Wen after he burned his vital essence. When the light of life shone on them, not only did it not make them feel uncomfortable, but it also gave them an indescribable sense of comfort. It was as though their bodies had been rejuvenated. All their fatigue and discomfort were swept away.

Even Li Xuan’s injuries that had yet to fully recover began to rapidly recover under the illumination of Zhou Wen’s humanoid sun.

The only injury that hadn’t recovered was Zhou Wen’s own injuries.

The Human Sovereign defied the heavens and killed, forging a way out for humans. However, he burned his own life in exchange for that.

Suirenshi observed lightning and obtained fire. Shennongshi tasted every plant. Fuxi deduced the changes in the world. All of them used their own strength to fight for a chance of survival.

And this chance of survival wasn’t for themselves.

Looking at Zhou Wen who was emitting light and heat like the sun, Li Xuan looked at him and said, “It’s fair now. Everyone has a Perfect Body Life Soul. No one will suffer a loss. Fight with all your might. Let me see how strong you are.”

“As you wish.” Zhou Wen’s body lit up as though he had turned into a burning body of energy. His fist broke through the speed of sound and blasted at Li Xuan.

“Nicely done.” Li Xuan wasn’t to be outdone. The black demonic aura on the carapace expanded as he similarly brandished his fist at Zhou Wen like an evil god. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Bam!

At the instant the two fists collided, Li Xuan’s body was sent flying by Zhou Wen’s terrifying strength. Even the carapace on his fist shattered.

While Li Xuan’s body was still in the air, Zhou Wen had already followed up like a beam of light. He punched Li Xuan repeatedly with his fists.

Crack! Crack!

Li Xuan’s carapace shattered piece by piece. Without waiting for his carapace to heal, Zhou Wen’s fist had already struck his flesh.

The maximum power unleashed with Primordial Human Sovereign seemed to explode with life. It exceeded its original limits. Even something as powerful as Li Xuan’s carapace found it difficult to withstand it.

“What powerful strength, but your strength is still insufficient to kill me. Such an injury will only make me stronger faster.” Li Xuan wasn’t alarmed by Zhou Wen’s continuous attacks. Instead, he was delighted.

“Is that so?” Zhou Wen remained unperturbed. The power of the Primordial Human Sovereign constantly erupted, shattering Li Xuan’s bones.

“It’s useless... It’s useless... It’s useless... Although this kind of power is strong... it still can’t deal fatal damage to me... It will only make me stronger and stronger... Let the tempest come strike harder...” Li Xuan was in pain and happy.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as his fists rained down on Li Xuan, nearly shattering his entire carapace. While the carapace rapidly healed, he also broke many of Li Xuan’s bones.

Finally, Zhou Wen punched Li Xuan in the abdomen, sending him flying.

However, while Li Xuan’s body was flying, his bones and carapace completely healed. When he landed on the ground, there were no wounds on his body. Even the carapace had completely recovered.

“Haha, didn’t I say so? Your attacks are useless against me. I feel that I’ve become stronger. My healing factor has sped up. It’s so fast that even I’m surprised. I really have to thank you... Strange... Why do I feel a little dizzy...” Li Xuan wanted to rub his eyes with his hand, but when he extended his left hand, he realized that his left hand couldn’t reach his face. He couldn’t help but feel strange. “What’s going on?”

“President... Your... Your body...” Gulli pointed at Li Xuan’s body in horror.

The others beside him had similar expressions as they looked at Li Xuan in horror as though they had seen a ghost.

“What’s wrong with my body?” Li Xuan looked down at his body and when he saw it, he screamed in fright.

He wasn’t injured at all, but all his bones were not in their right positions. His leg bones were overturned, and his arm was twisted like a fried dough twist. His eyes were askew from each other, and his neck was slanted. Li Xuan could almost see his back with one of his eyes.

Now, Li Xuan looked like a deformed monster. Although he wasn’t injured and his carapace was intact, there was nothing right with his body.

“Holy sh*t, Old Zhou, what did you do to me?” Li Xuan was frightened as he asked with a trembling voice.

“It’s nothing. I just broke your bones and made them heal faster,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Holy sh*t, you are screwing with me. Quickly fix me...” Li Xuan felt like crying.

Li Xuan’s self-healing had a memory characteristic that allowed him to recover to his normal state. However, Zhou Wen’s Power of the Primordial Human Sovereign also had the ability to heal others.

Therefore, Li Xuan’s fractured bones were healed before they returned to normal. This resulted in such a deformity.

“Then I must break your bones again,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Quick... Quick beat me...” Li Xuan said through gritted teeth. All he wanted now was to quickly recover his handsome appearance.

“You are the one asking for the beating. Don’t you retaliate,” Zhou Wen said as he walked in front of Li Xuan.

“Absolutely not.” Li Xuan gritted his teeth so hard that they nearly shattered.

Zhou Wen once again unleashed the power of Primordial Human Sovereign, but this time, shattering Li Xuan’s bones was much more difficult than the last time. His carapace and bones had become harder, and his healing factor had improved.

It wasn’t easy for him to break all the deformed bones again, allowing them to return to their normal states and heal themselves. Eventually, Li Xuan finally returned to normal.

Li Xuan, who had returned to normal, wanted to sneak an attack on Zhou Wen, but Zhou Wen nimbly dodged.

“If you do that again, I won’t help you recover next time,” Zhou Wen took a few steps back and said to Li Xuan with a smile.

When Li Xuan thought of his appearance, he couldn’t help but shiver. Although he wasn’t afraid of being injured, he couldn’t tolerate such a deformed look.

“F*ck, what kind of f*cking Life Soul is that? It’s freaking sinister.” Li Xuan didn’t dare attack again as he cursed indignantly.
