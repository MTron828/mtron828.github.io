Chapter 863: Three Copper Coins

Translator: CKtalon

After fusing, Zhou Wen arrived behind Pixiu. His Eyes of Penetration activated, allowing him to see through Pixiu’s body.

The Golden Overlord Sword had already been melted and absorbed by Pixiu, making Zhou Wen’s heart ache. Such a divine weapon had been destroyed by it.

The gold, silver, and copper ore that it had devoured had mostly melted. Thankfully, Zhou Wen saw that the Chaos Bead hadn’t been melted and absorbed. The bracelet was gone, leaving only a bead.

Thankfully, the Chaos Bead is still here. Zhou Wen took the opportunity to use Doctor Darkness’s Wheel of Destiny while Pixiu and Tyrant Behemoth were fighting.

Darkness Right Hand was activated as Zhou Wen’s right hand reached into the back of Pixiu’s head and stirred it, tearing a huge chunk of its brain apart.

As it was too big, Darkness Right Hand couldn’t pluck out its entire brain. It could only do its best to cause damage.

Pixiu let out a tragic cry. Tyrant Behemoth took the opportunity to press it to the ground. It rode on its body and pummeled it with its fists.

Zhou Wen didn’t stay idle either. He used the remaining two Darkness Right Hand abilities consecutively, turning its brain into a mess.

With problems arising in Pixiu’s brain, it no longer had the ability to resist. It was repeatedly struck in the chest by Tyrant Behemoth, and its struggles weakened.

Seeing that it no longer had the ability to suck wealth, Zhou Wen summoned the Light Concealment Sword and slashed its neck.

Tyrant Behemoth extended its claws into the wound and forcefully ripped open the wound. Finally, it tore off its head. A divine beast had died.

Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener and let the mini Truth Listener enter its stomach to take out the Chaos Bead.

Soon, Truth Listener crawled out again. It held the Chaos Bead in one claw, but there was something else in the other claw.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that the item Truth Listener had pulled out was three copper coins tied with a red string. The copper coins were circular on its outer rim, but there was a square hole in the middle. As they were too ancient, the patterns and words on them couldn’t be seen clearly. They were strung together by a red string, making them look inconspicuous.

However, this item wasn’t digested or absorbed by Pixiu’s stomach. Clearly, it wasn’t an ordinary item.

Truth Listener placed the Chaos Bead and copper coins in Zhou Wen’s hand. Zhou Wen took the copper coins and looked at them, but he didn’t find anything special. He first put away the copper coins before using his penetrative vision to look at Pixiu’s body.

There aren’t any Companion Eggs or dimensional crystals? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be disappointed. Pixiu’s abilities were very special. It would have been good to obtain a Companion Egg. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Unfortunately, Pixiu didn’t drop anything. He even lost the Golden Overlord Sword, making Zhou Wen feel like he had suffered a huge loss.

From the looks of it, I’ll have to think of a way to fuse a new weapon that’s similar to the Golden Overlord Sword, Zhou Wen thought.

However, Ever-Victorious was too difficult to farm. The success rate of fusion wasn’t high either. The chances of fusing an identical Golden Overlord Sword were very low.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t have OCD. All he needed to do was fuse Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable into one weapon.

I wonder if I can fuse those skills onto the Light Concealment Sword. Zhou Wen had that thought. He could only slowly try it in the future.

After searching the area and finding no other dimensional creatures, Zhou Wen left with Ya’er.

These copper coins don’t seem to be anything special. Why weren’t they digested by Pixiu? On the way back, Zhou Wen studied the three copper coins, but no matter what Essence Energy Art he injected, he couldn’t activate them.

Apart from being harder than the typical copper coin, Zhou Wen didn’t see any use for them.

I should think of a way to get a weapon. Zhou Wen also had a Mutated Overlord Snake that he had previously obtained. It had the Ever-Victorious ability.

Unfortunately, when Zhou Wen matched it with the Light Concealment Sword, he found the compatibility to be pitifully low—less than twenty.

The Golden Battle God Halberd’s compatibility with the Light Concealment Sword wasn’t high either. It was only 31. Zhou Wen didn’t dare mess around with such a success rate.

It doesn’t seem realistic to fuse these two skills with the Light Concealment Sword. What if I fuse them with a sword-type Companion Beast before fusing them with the Light Concealment Sword? Zhou Wen decided to give it a try.

After grinding the Ancient Sword Tomb for so long, he didn’t obtain any other Mythical swords. However, he obtained quite a number of Epic and Legendary swords.

Zhou Wen used the swords to match the Overlord Snake and Golden Battle God Halberd and quickly found one with a higher compatibility score.

He first used a sword to fuse with the Overlord Snake, but with a high compatibility of 63, the fusion ended up failing.

He used the Golden Battle God Halberd and another Epic sword to fuse. This time, the fusion succeeded, but the Unstoppable skill was deleted from the fusion.

Why is my luck so bad? Zhou Wen thought of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s newly added Badlands skill and felt a little uneasy. Could it be that the skill is showing its effects? I’ve suffered quite a loss this time...

Without the Golden Battle God Halberd and Mutated Overlord Snake as ingredients, it was impossible to continue any fusion. Zhou Wen had no choice but to temporarily give up on his previous plans and wait for a Companion Egg to drop.

Along the way, Zhou Wen focused his attention on grinding dungeons. He focused on the Endless Sea of Stars and the Ancient Sword Tomb. He wanted to obtain the complete 28 Lunar Mansion skills from the Endless Sea of Stars. He also wanted to obtain another Mythical Sword from the Ancient Sword Tomb.

The Light Concealment Sword was very powerful when used for assassination, but it wasn’t suitable in a head-on battle. Zhou Wen still needed a weapon for melee battles.

It was unknown if his luck had really changed for the worse. After grinding for a few days, nothing decent dropped. Instead, quite a number of useless Companion Eggs dropped.

Since he had to walk around to advance his Glimmer Life Soul, Zhou Wen took a detour to the Founding Emperor Tomb. He wanted to see if there was a tiny palm symbol to download the dungeon.

Before reaching the Founding Emperor Tomb, Zhou Wen saw a bustling town-like market. Many people were selling dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs produced in the Founding Emperor Tomb.

There were many unique Companion Eggs in the Founding Emperor Tomb, such as the Bronze Men that Zhou Wen had seen before and the Earth Elemental Beast. They were all from the Founding Emperor Tomb.

However, the Founding Emperor Tomb that humans knew of was actually only the periphery of the Founding Emperor Tomb. It was impossible to enter the tomb’s interior.

If the Founding Emperor Tomb was considered a huge underground city, the area that humans were in contact with now wouldn’t even reach the city gates.

Besides the legendary six heroes, no one had entered the true Founding Emperor Tomb.

Zhou Wen was just about to pass through the bazaar and head to the periphery of the Founding Emperor Tomb to search for the tiny palm symbol when he saw a commotion in the bazaar. He didn’t know what the group was doing.

After paying a little attention, Zhou Wen realized that Liu Yun was in the crowd, arguing with an old man.

Liu Yun doesn’t do anything unless there are benefits involved. What’s he doing here? Zhou Wen’s interest was piqued as he found a corner that no one was paying attention to and secretly observed Liu Yun’s every move.
