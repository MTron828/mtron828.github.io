Chapter 583 Backup Plan

"It’s just a legend. It might not be accurate. I think any human will see that many corpses, right?" Zhou Wen naturally didn’t believe this. If it was really the process of transcending one’s mortal coils, why hadn’t he become an immortal considering how he finished the journey?

"I don’t know if it’s accurate, but I know a few people who once walked the Seeking Immortality path. One of them only saw three corpses, with the most being a hundred corpses," Jiang Yan said.

"Then how many corpses did you see?" Zhou Wen asked Jiang Yan.

Jiang Yan glanced at the path they came from and said indifferently, "I don’t know. I didn’t count. The mountain wall along the way was filled with corpses. It’s like a mountain of corpses. All I saw were corpses, without a single part of the mountain exposed."

"Then it’s even more unlikely to be right. How many people can a student like us kill? How can there be so much sin?" Zhou Wen looked at Jiang Yan. He actually didn’t believe that Jiang Yan could see so many corpses.

"Follow the plan." Jiang Yan didn’t say anything else as he walked towards the crooked tree on the mountaintop.

As Jiang Yan walked, he summoned two Companion Beasts. The first was a black python with a mouth the size of a bowl. It was more than ten meters long and its entire body was pitch-black.

Strangely, the snake didn’t have eyes. It kept flicking its tongue.

The other Companion Beast was also black, but it was dressed as a warrior in black armor. It wore a black mask and had two sabers on its back. The scabbard and handle were also black. It was probably the Dark Domain Heavenly King.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare be negligent. He summoned Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd while Torch Dragon appeared in the form of an eye mirror. Unless it was absolutely necessary, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on using Bright Torch Vision World.

Firstly, Bai Ze’s reputation was too terrifying. Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if the Bright Torch Vision World was effective against it. If it didn’t work and ended up provoking it, he would ultimately be the one suffering. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Secondly, Bai Ze didn’t take the initiative to attack others. Previously, when Jiang Yan approached the range of the crooked tree, it had only said "Scram", causing Jiang Yan to roll down the mountain without killing him.

Only then did Bai Ze look up to glance at him. This glance left Zhou Wen alarmed. It didn’t look at Six-Winged or the Golden Battle God Halberd, but straight into Zhou Wen’s eyes.

Could it have already discovered Torch Dragon? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

Seeing that Zhou Wen was already prepared, Jiang Yan immediately ordered the Soundless Snake and the Dark Domain Heavenly King to use their powers.

The Soundless Snake opened its mouth. There were no venomous fangs inside, but visible ripples spread out from the mountaintop.

Almost at the same time, the Dark Domain Heavenly King pulled out the two sabers on his back and crossed them. A black light instantly devoured the entire mountain peak like a black hole.

Zhou Wen immediately felt his vision turn pitch-black. With the augmentation of Eight Perfections Wisdom and the Hell King Life Soul, his vision remained pitch-black. He couldn’t see or hear anything.

Unfortunately, Truth Listener is still evolving. I wonder if Truth Listener’s ability can break through the Soundless Snake’s Soundless Barrier? As Zhou Wen thought about it, he suddenly felt his eyes light up again. He could see and hear.

However, he could see that the entire mountain was enveloped in black. Furthermore, the sound waves produced spread out like water ripples.

"Let’s begin. Use your Companion Beast to attract Bai Ze’s attention. Don’t really fight it. Just attract its attention. It’s best if it can’t see or hear," Jiang Yan said as he dived towards the crooked tree.

Zhou Wen ordered Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd to surround Bai Ze using a pincer movement. At the same time, he made some noise to attract its attention.

Bai Ze continued lying on a huge rock under the tree, motionless.

Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd lunged from the left and right. One stomped on the ground with its huge feet, leaving huge footprints on the rocks, while the tip of the Golden Battle God Halberd slashed across the ground, leaving a deep mark. Wherever the halberd tip touched the rocks, sparks flew everywhere.

However, due to the Soundless Barrier, their actions failed to produce any sound. Only Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan could hear thanks to the Soundless Snake’s special treatment.

Bai Ze still didn’t react and continued lying there, but Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan felt that something was amiss.

If Bai Ze really couldn’t see or hear anything, then it shouldn’t be so calm, right?

Indeed, when the Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd approached the crooked tree, Bai Ze suddenly opened its mouth and spat out a word. "Freeze!"

Then, Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd froze. They stopped there as though someone had pressed a pause button in a movie.

As for the Soundless Snake’s Soundless Barrier, it was instantly torn apart by a force and shattered. As though it had suffered a heavy blow, the Soundless Snake collapsed to the ground.

Zhou Wen’s face darkened. The Soundless Barrier was completely useless as it was destroyed by Bai Ze.

What was even more depressing was that the Six-Winged and Golden Battle God Halberd were frozen there. No matter how Zhou Wen commanded them, they remained motionless.

Six-Winged’s eyes could still move, but its expression remained ferocious with its agape mouth, and its body couldn’t move.

The Golden Divine Light at the tip of the Golden Battle God Halberd kept flickering, but the halberd was also unable to move.

Even worse, Zhou Wen and Jiang Yan were also frozen. The Dark Domain Heavenly King couldn’t move either. Although his dark domain remained effective, no one could move. What was the use of the dark domain?

"Sorry, I underestimated Bai Ze’s strength. I originally thought that the Soundless Barrier would last for a while, I never expected it to break in the blink of an eye," Jiang Yan said.

Zhou Wen made an attempt. Although he couldn’t move his body, there was no problem with speaking. "We should have expected this. A famous divine beast like Bai Ze isn’t that easily restrained."

"Don’t worry. I still have a backup plan," Jiang Yan said.

"What’s your backup plan? Why didn’t you tell me beforehand?" Zhou Wen hurriedly asked when he heard that there was a way to turn the tables.

"There was no need to prepare for the backup plan. You just need to execute it. If I told you in advance, I’m afraid you wouldn’t agree to it," Jiang Yan said with a strange expression.

"We can’t move now. How do we execute it?" Zhou Wen asked.

"We can still move if we think of a solution. I’m just not sure if my backup plan will work," Jiang Yan said.

"What is your backup plan?" Zhou Wen asked.

"I studied many myths and legends, and I eventually came to a conclusion. Bai Ze... might be a clean freak..." Jiang Yan’s expression turned odder.

"So what if it’s a clean freak?" Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss as to what Jiang Yan was up to.
