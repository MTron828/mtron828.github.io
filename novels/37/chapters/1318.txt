Chapter 1319: Spare Your Life

Zhang Chunqiu’s face instantly turned ashen as he looked at Zhang Yuzhi in despair.

“Yuzhi… Don’t…” Zhang Chunqiu tried his best to stand up and stop Zhang Yuzhi, but his body had been severely demonized. He couldn’t even stand up.

“You only want me. Let them go and I’ll agree to fuse with you,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“Of course. To me, they are no different from ants by the side of the road. There won’t be any benefits even if I stomp them to death, but there won’t be any harm either. As long as you fuse with me, I guarantee you their safety and recovery,” Drought Demon Fairy said.

“Child, go. You’ve done enough for the Zhang family. Now, you are the only one in the entire Zhang family who isn’t affected by the demonic nature. You are the only person in the Zhang family that should live,” Zhang Siyou said.

“Yuzhi… No…” Zhang Chunqiu’s eyes were filled with despair. This was because he knew that with Zhang Yuzhi’s personality, it was impossible for her to leave now.

“Brother, I’ve been a jinx to begin with. I should have died a long time ago. I’m satisfied to be able to do something for you in the end.” Zhang Yuzhi walked towards the Corpse Flower with tears in her eyes.

“No…” Zhang Chunqiu struggled with all his might. His fingers pressed against the ground, almost to the point of snapping. The blood at his fingertips dyed the ground.

Zhang Siyou and company were also shouting at the top of their voices, but they couldn’t stop Zhang Yuzhi from walking towards the Corpse Flower.

“The one who deserves death isn’t you, but the people who made you cry.” A voice sounded from nearby.

Everyone was taken aback as they turned to look in the direction of the voice. They saw an armored figure that seemed to be bathed in light walk towards the Fiend Tomb.

“Human… Human Sovereign…” Immediately, someone recognized the figure and couldn’t help but be overjoyed.

The Prisoned Dragon armor on Zhou Wen and the Immortal Culling Sword at his waist were too eye-catching. Almost everyone on Earth knew them.

Zhang Yuzhi turned to look at Zhou Wen. When she saw him clearly, she was slightly taken aback. Her eyes were filled with pleasant surprise and an odd feeling.

Zhou Wen walked over step by step into the Earth fire. The strange Earth fire didn’t cause any damage to his body as though it didn’t exist.

He walked past Zhang Yuzhi and towards the Corpse Flower. As Zhou Wen walked, he held the hilt of the Immortal Culling Sword.

“Who are you?” Drought Demon Fairy’s voice sounded from the deep pit.

“Someone who finds you a sore sight and wants to kill you,” Zhou Wen said.

“Why are humans always so ignorant? Why do they always say such arrogant things?” Drought Demon Fairy’s voice was filled with anger, as though she was really angry.

“That’s because there are too many idiots. They won’t understand if you don’t speak clearly.” With every step Zhou Wen took, the sword intent over his body intensified. At that moment, the sword intent was already unimaginably powerful. Before the Immortal Culling Sword was unsheathed, the sword intent seemed to condense into something corporeal, as though it wanted to split the ground apart.

Amidst the flames, a figure appeared. The Corpse Flower automatically flew towards the figure’s glabella and vanished in the blink of an eye.

The figure was wearing a white dress and a white veil. It was impossible to tell what she looked like, but from her voice, she was undoubtedly Drought Demon Fairy.

“Even in the Mythical Era where Calamity entities were everywhere, no one dared to speak to me like that.” Drought Demon Fairy’s eyes turned cold. Clearly, she was infuriated by Zhou Wen.

“Then I’ll be clearer. If you can withstand my strike without dying, I’ll spare your life. I’ll permit you to continue being imprisoned in the Fiend Tomb,” Zhou Wen said.

“Die!” The already enraged Drought Demon Fairy transformed the flames over her body into a monstrous aura that filled the entire sky with flames. It was as though the entire world was only left with flames.

Infinite heavenly flames scorched everything within.

The Drought Demon Fairy’s flames could incinerate everything. They weren’t inferior to the Sun True Flames and were even more bizarre and terrifying.

As she watched the towering flames devour the world and suppress Human Sovereign, Human Sovereign’s glowing figure seemed to become much smaller under the flames.

The Zhang family was worried if Human Sovereign could withstand the heavenly fire of Drought Demon. It was a terrifying flame that could defeat the two gods, Count of the Wind and Lord of the Rain.

“You… Don’t…” Zhang Yuzhi’s expression was mixed as though she wanted to say something.

However, before she could finish her sentence, Zhou Wen had already unsheathed his sword.

At the instant the Immortal Culling Sword was unsheathed, everything in the world seemed to freeze. The rainbow-like sword beam sliced through everything in the void, splitting the heavenly flames into two as though it was slicing apart the sky.

A single sword cleaved through the nine heavens.

Zhang Yuzhi and company only saw a sword flash. The sky that was covered by the heavenly fire split into two, revealing the originally clear sky.

When they looked at Drought Demon again, they saw a purple magma-like liquid appear over her snow-white clothes..

The purple liquid dripped to the ground, each drop carrying scorching hot energy. The crystals that came into contact with them would immediately be burned through, forming a deep, indiscernible hole. It was unknown what depth it reached.

“Drought Demon is injured!” The Zhang family was pleasantly surprised.

They were delighted that the Zhang family might be saved, but they were alarmed that Human Sovereign had injured the legendary Drought Demon with one strike. He lived up to his title of the strongest human.

If he delivered a few more strikes, wouldn’t he be able to kill Drought Demon Fairy?

Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed. He originally wanted to use the Immortal Slaying and the power of the Immortal Culling Sword to severely injure Drought Demon Fairy or even kill her.

However, his strike only injured her, not causing her any severe injuries, much less killing her. Zhou Wen could sense that Drought Demon Fairy wasn’t seriously injured.

As expected of the legendary Drought Demon Fairy. She’s just too strong.?Zhou Wen marveled inwardly.

Drought Demon Fairy’s eyes emitted a ferocious glint as she glared at Zhou Wen as though she wanted to eat him.

Even in the Mythical era, she had never been injured when fighting other powerful Guardians and dimensional creatures. Yet, she had been injured by Zhou Wen.

Although part of the reason was that she had yet to fuse with humans and was severely suppressed by the rules of Earth, preventing her from fully unleashing her strength, Drought Demon Fairy still couldn’t tolerate such an outcome. Her killing intent surged as she steeled her heart to kill Zhou Wen.

Drought Demon Fairy was naturally someone who could identify the strong. She could tell that the Immortal Culling Sword was extraordinary and felt some fear.

However, Zhou Wen knew that the Immortal Culling Sword was just a decoration in his hand.

Zhou Wen hung the Immortal Culling Sword back on his waist and glanced at Drought Demon Fairy and spoke seemingly casually, “It’s quite rare to endure my strike without dying. It’s not easy to evolve to this stage. It’s a pity to kill you. I’ll spare your life.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Zhou Wen’s words filled Drought Demon Fairy’s chest with such anger that she almost blew up. Even in the Mythical era with countless experts, no one had dared to speak to her like that.
