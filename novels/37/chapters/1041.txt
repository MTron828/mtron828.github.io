Chapter 1042: Rigged Match

Translator: CKtalon

After a moment of collective silence among the Guardians, a Guardian immediately challenged the Invisibility Cloak.

Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t accept it. The Invisibility Cloak’s supplementary effects were very strong, but its actual lethality wasn’t much. In a battle with a Guardian, there was basically no chance of victory.

Li Xuan and company knew that Zhou Wen had the Invisibility Cloak and looked at him with odd expressions. However, it was difficult to say it out loud where they were.

“Wang Lu, other than here, is there a cube where there are fewer people?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Yes, but there are many dimensional creatures in the uninhabited area outside the Imperial Capital,” Wang Lu said after some thought.

“Can we get there in an hour?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“You have to be fast enough. At the very least, you have to be at the Mythical stage. Furthermore, you can’t be delayed on the trip there.” Wang Lu didn’t hesitate and immediately answered Zhou Wen’s question.

“Alright, give me the address.” Zhou Wen’s speed was comparable to a Mythical.

“That place isn’t easy to find. I’ll take you there,” Wang Lu said as she summoned a huge white cat.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen carried Ya’er and sat behind Wang Lu. After informing Li Xuan and company, Wang Lu rode the white cat away.

It was definitely not an easy task to maintain first place for two days. Zhou Wen couldn’t let the Invisibility Cloak fight, so he could only challenge himself and drag out the next two days.

As the Companion Beasts that could issue challenges had to be at the Mythical stage or had the qualifications to advance to the Mythical stage, it was impossible to use ordinary Companion Beasts to stall for time. Zhou Wen calculated that if he summoned all his Mythical Companion Beasts, he could last for twenty-four hours.

He needed many Mythical Companion Beasts to survive a day of challenges without repeats.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen had quite a number of Mythical Companion Beasts, so it shouldn’t be a problem.

Wang Lu’s white cat was actually a Mythical Companion Beast. It was rather fast as it ran on the main road of the Imperial Capital and quickly left the city.

There were many dimensional zones near the Imperial Capital. The white cat ran quickly and didn’t encounter any dimensional creatures along the way.

After more than forty minutes, the white cat had reached the ancient town that no one lived in. There was a cube in the town.

“We’re here.” Wang Lu controlled the white cat to stop in front of the cube.

“Didn’t you say that there were many dimensional creatures nearby?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. He didn’t see any dimensional creatures nearby.

“I naturally won’t see them if I don’t want to encounter them,” Wang Lu said with a wink.

Zhou Wen was enlightened. It was because of Wang Lu’s Luck stat.

“Thankfully, I have you. Otherwise, I don’t know if I would’ve made it in time if I were intercepted by a dimensional creature.” Zhou Wen looked at the countdown. There was less than ten minutes left. He hurriedly summoned a Golden Battle God Halberd and got it to challenge the Invisibility Cloak.

Zhou Wen looked at the time and wasn’t in a rush to accept the challenge. He wanted to wait until the last second and not waste a single second. After all, it wouldn’t be easy to last the forty-eight hours.

People from all over the world were waiting for the Invisibility Cloak to accept the challenge, but as time passed, the Invisibility Cloak remained motionless. The countdown was about to end.

“The Invisibility Cloak won’t automatically forfeit, right?”

“It’s very possible. Although the Invisibility Cloak is strong, it’s only a support-type Companion Beast. Its combat strength isn’t strong. Even if it accepts a challenge, it’s impossible for it to be the Guardian’s match.”

“Have you forgotten that the Invisibility Cloak defeated Ya?”

“That’s just a coincidence. I think Ya fought the Guardians with all his might previously and was already at the end of his rope. That’s why the Invisibility Cloak benefited.”

“You can’t say that. We aren’t sure if the Invisibility Cloak has powerful offensive abilities. Perhaps it does.”

As everyone was discussing, there were only ten seconds left on the countdown. As they watched the time pass, their hearts leaped to their throats.

“It looks like the Invisibility Cloak is about to give up on accepting the challenge.” The countdown was already at 1. Another tick and it would be over.

To everyone’s surprise, the screen suddenly lit up.

“The Invisibility Cloak has accepted the challenge... Whose challenge? Holy sh*t... Golden Battle God Halberd... Another Companion Beast...”

“Why does it feel like I’ve returned to the previous ranking battle? This is too retro.”

“Golden Battle God Halberd. I think it’s a Mythical Companion Beast from the West District. Can it defeat the Invisibility Cloak?”

Seeing the Golden Battle God Halberd appear on the cube and float in midair, everyone looked forward to a huge battle.

Although everyone knew that the Golden Battle God Halberd’s strength was definitely inferior to a Guardian’s, they were still very curious as to what skills the Invisibility Cloak had.

Countless pairs of eyes stared at the cube’s screen. They waited for a while, but there was no reaction. They waited for a little while longer, but there was still no reaction.

“What’s going on? Is the video stuck?” someone asked in puzzlement.

“This is a cube, not a live stream. How can it be stuck?” someone said.

“If it’s not stuck, why isn’t the screen moving?”

“I think... Perhaps... Perhaps... the Golden Battle God Halberd hasn’t moved?”

“It can’t see the Invisibility Cloak at all. What can it do? It’s staying motionless to deal with any possible change.”

“But it can’t just stay still.”

“It’s impossible for the Invisibility Cloak to remain hidden forever. The Golden Battle God Halberd is waiting for an opportunity.”

As everyone watched the frozen scene, they discussed how the Golden Battle God Halberd could find the Invisibility Cloak.

More than half an hour passed. The Golden Battle God Halberd remained motionless like a mountain, and they couldn’t see where the Invisibility Cloak was.

At that moment, people began to feel that something was amiss. “Holy sh*t, this can’t be a rigged match, right? Don’t tell me the Golden Battle God Halberd and Invisibility Cloak belong to the same person?”

“I think it’s very likely. Otherwise, how could they remain motionless?”

“A blatant rigged match. How shameless.”

After waiting for a while, the Golden Battle God Halberd and Invisibility Cloak still had no intention of moving. Everyone had already realized that this was definitely a rigged match.

“If this continues, won’t they be able to last until the end of the ranking battle? Then, the first place on the rankings will definitely be chosen between the Invisibility Cloak and the Golden Battle God Halberd.”

“This is too shameless. I wonder who could do such a thing. It’s a disgrace to the Federation.”

Be it the Federation or overseas, they hated such actions. Instead, the Guardians didn’t panic and continued waiting patiently.

Zhou Wen sat in front of the cube and played with his phone. He wanted to while away the forty-eight hours like this.

Unfortunately, the heavens didn’t listen to his wishes. On the cube’s arena, a blinding light suddenly appeared as though there was life inside.
