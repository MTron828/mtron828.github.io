Chapter 807: Collecting Dragon King Gu

The speedboat was much faster than the wooden boat as it sped across the river. Zhou Wen could clearly sense that he was getting closer and closer to Primordial Spore as the connection was getting stronger.

To people who reared Gu, the Dragon Corpse River was as dangerous as hell, but it was nothing to Zhou Wen. As he sped forward, he quickly sensed the location of Primordial Spore.

Zhou Wen could sense that Primordial Spore was beneath the boat. Furthermore, he could sense that the massive creature, Dragon King Gu, was also below.

As they were very close, Zhou Wen could sense it more clearly. Primordial Spore had been trying to parasitize the Dragon King Gu and control its body.

However, the Dragon King Gu was different from ordinary Mythical creatures. Its body was an agglomerate; likewise for its soul—countless souls gathered together. Primordial Spore attempted to parasitize the Dragon King Gu’s soul only to realize that it could only control a portion of the souls. No matter which part it parasitized, it couldn’t completely control the Dragon King Gu. This resulted in the current deadlock.

It was easy to parasitize a soul, but it was impossible to control the Dragon King Gu. Unless Primordial Spore split into thousands of small Primordial Spores and proceeded with a complete parasitization, it was possible to truly control the Dragon King Gu.

“Ya’er, can you control the Dragon King Gu below?” Zhou Wen placed his hopes on Ya’er.

However, Ya’er shook her head. She couldn’t control the Dragon King Gu.

“Is it because it’s too powerful?” Zhou Wen asked Ya’er.

Although Ya’er had the ability to control Gu, there was a limit. The Dragon King Gu was already a top-notch Mythical creature, so it was normal for Ya’er to be unable to control it with her mind.

To his surprise, Ya’er shook it again. However, this time, she finally spoke. “Can’t communicate.”

“You mean that you control Gu because you can communicate with them, and you can’t control Gu that can’t you communicate with or those that are unwilling to cooperate?” Zhou Wen immediately understood Ya’er’s ability.

Ya’er nodded. From the looks of it, Zhou Wen’s guess was right.

However, for some reason, Ya’er and the Dragon King Gu couldn’t communicate. As such, Zhou Wen’s hope of using Ya’er’s ability to subdue the Dragon King Gu was dashed.

Is there any other way? After some thought, Zhou Wen still couldn’t think of any good solution. Even if he made Tai Sui transform into a fish and enter the river, it would at most eat a portion of the Dragon King Gu’s body. It was impossible to kill it.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred. Since I can’t subdue it, I wonder if I can store it in the calabash. If I can store it in the calabash, I can feed Tai Sui even if I can’t use it. But how can I store such a huge Dragon King Gu in the calabash?

After plucking it from the vine, the calabash no longer had the ability to take the initiative to store Gu. However, although Gu wouldn’t resist entering the calabash, they wouldn’t take the initiative to enter either.

From the looks of it, I can only use the tactic of cornering it. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener’s ability to scout the terrain at the bottom of the river before summoning Tai Sui.

Zhou Wen first got Tai Sui to use its mimicking ability to turn into a tiny Ancient Tadpole. However, the Ancient Tadpole that Tai Sui transformed into was white. It was different in color from the real Ancient Tadpole, but its external appearance was no different.

After lowering Tai Sui into the river, it swam towards the bottom of the river.

Zhou Wen put on the Dragon Scale Armor formed by Demon Blood True Dragon. He also put on the Invisibility Cloak and went down the river with the calabash, but he headed in another direction.

The Dragon King Gu had suffered greatly from Tai Sui. It would definitely be afraid if it saw Tai Sui.

However, Tai Sui was previously in the form of the chick. Now that it had turned into an ancient tadpole, the Dragon King Gu failed to recognize it.

Seeing a tadpole dare approach it, the Dragon King Gu unleashed its might and swallowed Tai Sui.

When Tai Sui entered the Dragon King Gu’s body, it immediately bit left and right and began devouring the Dragon King Gu’s body. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When the Dragon King Gu realized that the tadpole it had swallowed wasn’t dead and was still devouring its body, it was alarmed and wanted to get Tai Sui out of its body.

It wasn’t a real dragon but condensed from countless tiny Gu. It could control its body freely, so it opened a hole in its abdomen. Tai Sui was devouring its body when it was thrown out.

After Tai Sui came out, it immediately used its mimicking ability and transformed into the Dragon King Gu. The two Dragon King Gu appeared at the bottom of the river and it was almost impossible to tell which was the real one.

However, the real Dragon King Gu could change its color, but Tai Sui remained white the entire time. People in the know could easily tell.

Unfortunately, Tai Sui’s mimicking ability was only superficial. No matter how big and fierce it became, its strength was still as weak. It didn’t have the abilities of the Dragon King Gu; only its appearance was more frightening.

However, the Dragon King Gu was frightened. Tai Sui was its nemesis to begin with. Now that it had become so huge, the Dragon King Gu was afraid that it would be swallowed by Tai Sui, so it immediately fled.

Tai Sui’s speed couldn’t keep up with the Dragon King Gu, so it could only chase after it slowly. Looking like the Dragon King Gu was useless, and it didn’t have the speed of the Dragon King Gu, so it couldn’t catch up.

The Dragon King Gu was quite frightened. It fled in a panic, hoping to stay as far away from Tai Sui as possible.

Zhou Wen used Primordial Spore to take advantage of a portion of the Dragon King Gu’s soul, allowing it to have some effect and affect the direction of the Dragon King Gu’s escape.

The Dragon King Gu chose the correct direction. Zhou Wen was just making sure that things followed his plan.

He stood in invisibility at the narrow mouth at the bottom of the river and watched the Dragon King Gu rush over. When it was close, he suddenly took out the calabash from under the Invisibility Cloak and opened the mouth of the calabash.

The Dragon King Gu immediately slammed into the calabash and half its head drilled in.

Zhou Wen was originally afraid that the Dragon King Gu would resist, but to his surprise, after the Dragon King Gu discovered the space in the calabash, it continued burrowing in. Soon, the entire body of the Dragon King Gu was inside. Zhou Wen capped the calabash and the Dragon King Gu remained inside.

The Dragon King Gu didn’t seem to have any intention of coming out. It stayed inside the calabash and coiled inside obediently when it didn’t see Tai Sui chase after it.

Zhou Wen never expected things to go so smoothly. To his surprise, when he saw Tai Sui swim over, Zhou Wen was somewhat curious. He rode on Tai Sui’s back and got it to rush out of the water with him.

The people that he had encountered previously happened to be nearby. They saw Zhou Wen’s speedboat parked on the river. The girl was still sitting on the boat, but Zhou Wen was nowhere to be seen. They imagined that Zhou Wen had been killed and were about to rescue the girl when they suddenly heard a loud splash.
