Chapter 1215: Super Genius

Zhou Wen still found it unbelievable. He dares to fight the entire Federation with his strength alone, and in such a blatant manner?

Old Demon said coldly, “Hui Haifeng only represents the federal government. Now, there’s not only the federal government on Earth, but there are also the League of Guardians, the Holy Spirit Association, the overseas faction, and others. And these factions need a place to exchange resources. And that’s the underground market at Fireworks Lane. Here, as long as you have money, you can exchange for anything you want. Even the six families need resources that they don’t have. There aren’t many people who can balance the relationships between the various factions and complete this matter. Do you think the Hui family can touch such a person?”

With Old Demon giving this explanation, Zhou Wen understood that the Faceless Buddha in Fireworks Lane didn’t only represent himself. It also represented the interests of the League of Guardians, the Holy Spirit Association, overseas, and even the Federation itself.

Ignoring the fact that the federation president didn’t control the entire federal government, even if he could fully control the federal government, he still needed to consider carefully if he wanted to touch Fireworks Lane and Faceless Buddha.

However, Zhou Wen still found it ridiculous for Faceless Buddha to abduct a woman from the Hui family. There had to be another reason.

“Who’s that Ah Cai? Why would Faceless Buddha abduct her?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I’m afraid only Faceless Buddha knows why. Perhaps you can ask the Hui family. However, Faceless Buddha once ordered that no one from the Hui family is allowed to enter Fireworks Lane. He’s a man of action. Previously, there were people from the six families who refused to believe his claim and were killed in Fireworks Lane.” Old Demon glanced at Hui Wan. Clearly, the Hui family member he was referring to was Hui Wan.

“Faceless Buddha is a big baddie. He snatched Ah Cai away,” Hui Wan said through gritted teeth.

“I don’t know if Faceless Buddha is a big baddie, but ever since he came to Fireworks Lane, this place, which was at the bottom of society and suffered bullying, is no longer having women like us suffer random bullying. No one dares to wantonly kill for fun,” the bunny girl said seriously.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but fall silent when he heard that. He had previously heard of it and knew that what the bunny girl said was very pragmatic.

As the Earth’s anomalies became more and more intense, and the environment became worse, many women who didn’t have the ability to protect themselves or even obtain food had to engage in special work.

However, those who could come to such a place to enjoy themselves were people with power or money. Furthermore, the mental pressure was too great. Under the circumstances where the laws were weak, it was very common for women to be bullied. They weren’t paid for their service and might even be beaten or killed.

It wasn’t just Holy City. Many human cities had the same problem.

“In that case, Faceless Buddha is not a bad person,” Zhou Wen said.

“He’s not human. He’s the Buddha of Fireworks Lane, the god here,” the bunny girl corrected him seriously.

“From the looks of it, it’s time for us to leave.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be embroiled in such a complicated matter. All he wanted was to take Hui Wan back safely.

“I’m not going back until I see Ah Cai.” Hui Wan was very insistent. However, he wasn’t like ordinary children who did things purely out of spite. He had his own independent thoughts.

“I want to see Faceless Buddha and ask him what’s needed for him to release Ah Cai. As long as he’s willing to release Ah Cai, I’m willing to pay any price. He can take anything within the confines of my abilities—money or the research products of our Hui family,” Hui Wan continued.

“Then how great is the range of your abilities? How much say do you have?” Old Demon asked Hui Wan with contempt.

He didn’t believe that a five-year-old child could have many resources at his disposal. Even if his surname was Hui—even if he was Hui Haifeng’s son—he would at most have some pocket money that ordinary children couldn’t have.

If such money could settle Faceless Buddha, Ah Cai wouldn’t have been forced to leave the Hui family.

It looked like Hui Wan had come prepared. He opened his bag and took out some documents.

“These are the shares of the dimensional zones that I have in Holy City. There are also some shares of the dimensional zones in the North and South District that I bought from the six families. As long as the six families don’t collapse, the profits should be very stable. There’s also my company here. I own 73% of the shares...” Hui Wan gave a general introduction.

Everyone was dumbfounded when they heard that. Even Brother Milk’s expression changed when he looked at Hui Wan. He picked up some documents and looked at them before saying with a strange expression, “These are all genuine.”

Old Demon also picked up one of the documents and took a look. He immediately shouted, “Is the Great Fun Group yours?”

Hui Wan nodded. “Strictly speaking, it belongs to me after I acquired it half a year ago.”

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised when he heard that. He had recently heard of the name “Great Fun Group.” Its main business was a project that combined Companion Beasts and technology. For example, the construction of some Companion Beast power stations was the business of the Great Fun Group. The An family and the Great Fun Group had business partnerships, so it could be said that it was a large corporation that covered the Federation.

“You’re still so young. Is your family at ease handing such a huge corporation to you?” the bunny girl said to Hui Wan in disbelief.

However, Hui Wan corrected her seriously. “No, it’s not from my family. I bought it myself.”

“Doesn’t the money you used to acquire it come from your family?” Old Demon said.

“No, my money was obtained by selling my inventions and investments. Apart from the experimental equipment and materials that my mother gave me in the beginning, I didn’t take a single cent from my family for nothing,” Hui Wan said.

“What inventions do you have?” Old Demon asked.

“A recent invention that has been pushed to the market. It’s called a Companion Egg backpack. You should have heard of it, right?” Hui Wan said.

“You invented the Companion Egg backpack?” The bunny girl and Old Demon widened their eyes as they looked at Hui Wan as though they were looking at a monster.

They really couldn’t believe that the thing had been invented by such a young child.

“If you don’t believe me, you can take a look at the contract I signed with the six families. The Companion Egg backpacks made by the six families have all purchased my technology.” Hui Wan took out some documents from the thick stack of documents for them to see.

After Old Demon and company read it, they couldn’t treat Hui Wan as a child when they looked at him again.

“As long as Faceless Buddha is willing, I can use all of this to exchange for Ah Cai,” Hui Wan said.

“Although you are very sincere, there are some things that can’t be resolved with money. It’s best you leave quickly,” said Brother Milk.

Zhou Wen naturally knew that if money could resolve the problem, Faceless Buddha wouldn’t have abducted Ah Cai from the Hui family.

“Why? The combined value of these can buy half of Holy City. Can’t it satisfy Faceless Buddha?” Hui Wan clearly didn’t understand.

He might be a super genius in some aspects, but in most aspects, he was still a child.
