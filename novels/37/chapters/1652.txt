Chapter 1653 Targeted

Zhou Wen wished he could immediately lunge forward and snatch the Calamity essence. It was a Heaven-level Calamity essence, and not an ordinary one.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t dare move a step. He had no delusion in front of the bee. Keeping his life was already his greatest wish.

The bee moved the suona away from its mouth and stopped playing.

However, before Zhou Wen and company could heave a sigh of relief, the bee flapped its wings and flew towards them.

The bee didn’t fly quickly as it slowly landed.

Zhou Wen and company didn’t dare move. Only their eyes moved as they watched the bee. The bee held the suona and floated in the air as it slowly landed on the Calamity essence.

Xiao and Jiuyang’s tense nerves relaxed a little. Up to now, the bee didn’t seem to have any intention of killing them.

Xiao and Jiuyang weren’t afraid of Calamity-grade creatures. Even against the freaky Companion Beasts from before, they had the ability to fight them to the death. However, the power of the suona had already exceeded the limits of a Calamity-grade creature. They had nearly died from the shockwaves of the suona’s music; there was no need discussing facing it head-on.

The tiny bee wasn’t enough to scare them, but the suona struck terror in them. Even Zhou Wen was no exception.

Although Zhou Wen still had one last trick up his sleeve, even he didn’t know how useful it was. Therefore, it was best not to have things develop to that point.

The three of them watched as the bee flew to the Calamity essence. It extended its claws and grabbed the Calamity essence, lifting the strange crystal up.

The bee clearly didn’t have the Companion Beast’s ability. It couldn’t directly devour the Calamity essence. It hugged the Calamity essence and wanted to absorb the energy inside.

“That bee might not be the parasitic Companion Beast, but the Companion Beast born on this planet,” Xiao suddenly said.

“Why?” Zhou Wen and Jiuyang were taken aback. They had always imagined that the bee was the Companion Beast that had parasitized this planet’s Companion Beast. After all, it had such a divine artifact in its hand. It seemed to match being the parasitic Companion Beast.

Xiao said, “Didn’t you realize that this planet didn’t change after that Companion Beast died?”

Zhou Wen and Jiuyang immediately realized the problem when they heard Xiao say that.

Once a Companion Beast born from a planet was born, the planet would suffer a destructive blow and explode. It was very likely that half of it would explode like Venus.

However, when the Companion Beast appeared, although it triggered some changes in the planet, the planet functioned normally even after its death.

As for the changes and damage to the planet’s surface, they were relatively inconsequential.

“In that case, that Companion Beast doesn’t look like a Companion Beast born from this planet. It doesn’t have any connection with this planet,” Jiuyang said after some thought.

“If this bee is the Companion Beast born from this planet, why would the divine artifact snatched by the parasitic Companion Beast be in its hands?” Zhou Wen said after some thought. Although he also felt that the Companion Beast didn’t look like the Companion Beast born from this planet, he couldn’t explain this problem.

“This isn’t difficult to explain. After that Companion Beast parasitized the planet’s interior, it wasn’t able to completely control the Companion Beast produced by the planet itself. Instead, the divine artifact was snatched away. Or rather, it had a reason that required it to abandon the divine artifact. It happened to let the Companion Beast produced by the planet pick up the spoils. It’s probably something like that. It’s not easy to guess the exact situation.”

Xiao paused for a moment before continuing, “The reason I said that the bee is the Companion Beast born from this planet is only partly the answer. Another important reason is that although that Companion Beast’s abilities are strange, its strength isn’t compatible with this planet. This bee is different. Its strength vaguely resonates with this planet.”

“Its power resonates with this planet? Why didn’t I discover it?” Jiuyang said in puzzlement, ‘This planet ‘s surface is covered by glaciers. The Companion Beast produced should have some ice-elemental powers, right? That bee doesn’t seem to have any ice-elemental powers, right?”

“It’s not an ice-elemental power,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. “Xiao is right. That bee does have an intrinsic connection with this planet. Up to now, this connection has been ongoing.”

“What’s that?” Jiuyang still didn’t understand what connection Xiao and Zhou Wen were talking about.

“You are just too slow.” Xiao explained helplessly, “Didn’t you realize that the restrictions on this planet haven’t been removed? If that Companion Beast was really born from this planet, even if the planet didn’t explode after it died, the restrictions should have been removed.”

“I see.” Jiuyang sometimes suffered from being slow. It was his nature, but once he was in a situation, things he thought about were more than a normal person’s thoughts.

“If the bee is really the Companion Beast born from this planet and possesses the divine artifact snatched from the mythical battle, and now that it has killed the parasitic Companion Beast, wouldn’t we be in greater danger?” Jiuyang said. Xiao sighed and said, “Indeed. Unless it’s not interested in us at all, our situation is even more dangerous than being pursued by that Companion Beast.”

As the three of them spoke, the bee’s claws hugged the Calamity essence as it flapped its wings and flew towards them. Zhou Wen’s heart immediately chilled. Xiao and Jiuyang didn’t have it easy either. Although the bee didn’t blow the trumpet and there were no music restraints, they could move freely. The restrictions of the planet still existed. As long as they couldn’t leave this planet, even if they instant transmitted to the other end of the planet, it wouldn’t be of much use.

Once the bee’s suona sounded, they would still be required to kneel. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Now, Zhou Wen could only rejoice that this thing hadn’t appeared on Earth. Otherwise, with the suona sounding, 99% of humans around the world would have died. There weren’t many people who could last until they knelt and kowtowed.

Escaping was futile, so none of the trio moved. Their six eyes stared at the slowly approaching bee.

Zhou Wen increasingly felt that something was amiss because the bee was flying straight at

au

him.

Indeed, the tiny bee flew in front of him without any intention of continuing its flight. It circled Zhou Wen a few times as though it was sizing him up.

Zhou Wen’s muscles tensed up as he prepared to fight to the death.

However, the bee didn’t attack Zhou Wen. After circling a few times, it flew off into the distance.

After flying for a short distance, the bee suddenly stopped. It raised its suona and blew it, aiming it at Zhou Wen.
