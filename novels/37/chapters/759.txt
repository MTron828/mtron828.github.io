Chapter 760: An Essence Energy Art Story

Translator: CKtalon

After many attempts, Zhou Wen realized that a better choice was to find a weaker Guardian to kill. For example, the black-jade Guardian he had killed or the previous six-winged seraphim.

I wonder where that six-winged seraphim went. It’ll be good if I can find him, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

The Guardians in Ant City and the war wagon were probably the strongest among the Guardians. At the very least, none of the Guardians that Zhou Wen had seen had displayed strength stronger than theirs.

The next morning, Wang Chan surprisingly came again.

The wounds on Zhou Wen’s body had already been rebandaged. Wang Lu had rebandaged him yesterday afternoon.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t mention Wang Chan. After all, Wang Chan was just being nice. There was no need for him to mention the matter and make the sisters unhappy.

When Wang Chan saw Zhou Wen’s state, she asked in surprise, “Are your injuries not healed yet? Didn’t I already treat you yesterday?”

“It’s almost healed. I wish to recuperate further,” Zhou Wen said.

“Why don’t I give you another injection?” As Wang Chan spoke, she summoned the syringe-like Companion Beast again.

“There’s no need, no need at all.” Zhou Wen hurriedly waved his hand. “Don’t treat my injuries. I just want to be lazy and lie here for a few days. If you treat all my injuries, I’ll have to continue working.”

“So you are just trying to skive.” Wang Chan was enlightened. She didn’t insist on treating Zhou Wen’s injuries and unsummoned the syringe Companion Beast.

“I heard from Sis that you are a genius. You can become very powerful just by casually learning a skill. Is that true?” Wang Chan asked Zhou Wen.

“Your sister is exaggerating. I also have to spend serious efforts practicing,” Zhou Wen said.

“I knew it. How can there be anyone so awesome in this world who can learn something so casually? I’ve already tried so hard, but I still can’t figure things out.” Wang Chan seemed to heave a sigh of relief as she pulled a chair and placed it in front of the bed. She leaned against the back of the chair and looked at Zhou Wen. “Do you have some secret trick to learning? Can you teach me?”

“It’s not a secret trick, but I still have some experience to share. What do you want to learn?” Zhou Wen thought that since Wang Lu had helped him so much, it was only right for him to help her sister.

“Essence Energy Arts, sword techniques, movement techniques, and so on are all difficult to learn. No matter how hard I try, I can’t meet their standards. I keep getting scolded,” Wang Chan said with a bitter expression.

“Why do you find it difficult?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Chan.

“Because it’s very difficult to remember. My memory isn’t too good. I keep memorizing the front and forgetting the back. After memorizing the back, I forget the front,” Wang Chan said.

“Actually, it’s very simple. Just tell me any Essence Energy Skill you have learned. I’ll tell you how to memorize it in an easier manner,” Zhou Wen said.

“This is an Essence Energy Art that I’ve been memorizing recently. I’ll recite it to you.” Wang Chan began reciting.

Zhou Wen listened for a while before his expression gradually turned awkward. The Essence Energy Arts that Wang Chan recited were all unfamiliar and obscure ancient texts. Furthermore, they were very long. She had recited a few thousand words in one go, but it sounded like there was still a long way to go.

Even with Zhou Wen’s memory, it was difficult for him to memorize everything without understanding the meaning of the article.

“Eh... Little Chan, stop for a moment. How many words do you have left for this Essence Energy Art?” Zhou Wen stopped Wang Chan and asked.

“There are a total of 134,467 words. I’ve memorized them for days, but I still forget the back after memorizing the front. I keep making mistakes,” Wang Chan said in distress.

Zhou Wen thought to himself, It would be a miracle if you could memorize all of them. If you can’t figure out the meaning of such an obscure ancient text, just relying on your memory to memorize the words correctly, you wouldn’t be a genius, but a god.

This ancient text was actually about the same as a foreign language. Thinking about it, it would be too harsh to require someone to memorize a work of more than a hundred thousand foreign words in a few days and not make a single mistake.

“Has anyone explained the content of this Essence Energy Art to you?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Yes, but it sounds very difficult to understand and I don’t really remember it,” Wang Chan said. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said to Wang Chan with a smile, “Then do you like stories?”

“I like them. I love hearing my sister tell me stories about the Federation’s six heroes. They fight and explore in unknown dimensional zones. I also hope that I can be like them one day—going to unknown places to fight unknown powerful creatures and obtain magical Companion Beasts...” Wang Chan wore a look of anticipation.

Zhou Wen said to Wang Chan with a smile, “Actually, the Essence Energy Art you recited was a story of a hero’s adventure.”

“Tch, can you not try to coax me like I’m a little girl?” Wang Chan curled her lips and said.

“If you don’t believe me, recite it and I’ll translate this heroic adventure story for you,” Zhou Wen said.

Wang Chan naturally didn’t believe him as she began reciting the Essence Energy Art. “The Great Dao has no form, yet it creates the Heaven and Earth. The Great Dao is lawless, but it rules the Sun and Moon. The great Dao is nameless, but it nourishes all things...”

As Wang Chan recited, she looked at Zhou Wen. No matter how she thought about it, she couldn’t tell what relationship the Essence Energy Art had with a hero story.

“Alright, let me translate this sentence for you.” Zhou Wen gestured for Wang Chan to stop reciting.

Wang Chan stopped reciting and blinked at Zhou Wen, not believing that it could be translated into a story.

Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before saying, “There’s a beautiful and adorable girl. She’s extremely talented. She became a Legendary at the age of three, an Epic at the age of six, and she advanced to the Mythical stage at the age of nine. At the age of twelve, she’s already invincible in the Federation...”

“How can there be such a powerful girl? Are you spouting nonsense? Furthermore, this has nothing to do with Essence Energy Arts, right?” Wang Chan curled her lips and said.

“Listen to what I have to say. That young heroine was invincible when she was twelve years old. She was just too lonely and wanted to suffer defeat. But on this day, a youth about her age appeared and challenged her. In the end, he defeated her with one strike.”

Wang Chan interrupted again. “Why is your story contradictory? You previously said that the girl was invincible. How could she be defeated in one strike?”

“Do you still want to hear the story?” Zhou Wen glared at her.

“Continue.” Wang Chan smiled.

“After being defeated by the youth, the girl asked the youth, ‘Why are you so powerful?’ The youth answered her, ‘Because I obtained a treasure in a mysterious dimensional zone. That treasure can nurture the Heaven and Earth and control the movement of the Sun and Moon... From then on, the girl embarked on her journey to find the treasure...”

As Wang Chan recited, Zhou Wen translated the content she recited into a hero story. Wang Chan was gradually attracted by the content of the story and forgot to pick up on Zhou Wen’s plot holes.
