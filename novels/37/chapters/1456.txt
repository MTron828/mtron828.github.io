Chapter 1457: I Won’t Make It

Translator: CKtalon

Despite being besieged by all sorts of strange ghosts like Crow Tengu, Hashihime, and Umibōzu, the stone beast remained motionless like a mountain. When all sorts of forces struck it, it was like a water spray gun hitting a steel plate—no damage was dealt.

What powerful defense!?Zhou Wen began to worry if the Immortal Culling Sword could kill the stone beast.

Since Tsukuyomi could kill a Hell-level alien beast, it meant that even if she hadn’t reached the Hell level, she was definitely a top powerhouse at the Human Realm.

In her domain, all the ghosts possessed Calamity-grade power.

However, it wasn’t sufficient to injure the stone beast at all. Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if he could slice open such a defense with the Immortal Culling Sword.

The Immortal Culling Sword was very strong, but its true might could only be unleashed when matched with a sufficiently strong user.

All Zhou Wen could do now was to pull it out and use it in battle. There was no need to talk about unleashing its true might; it was already a problem for him to rouse its might. It was really difficult to say if he could kill a Calamity stone beast with such powerful defense.

“Are you alright?” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask Tsukuyomi when he saw that the attacks of the hundred ghosts were ineffective against the stone beast.

The stone beast’s domain was showing its effects. The surrounding space became smaller and smaller. When the entire space was filled with rocks, their movements would be greatly restricted.

Even if the rocks didn’t crush them, tearing through the rocks would clearly slow them down. Instant transmission was not even an option.

There were rocks everywhere. In an instant, his body would be stuck in the rocks.

No, it shouldn’t be said he would be stuck. To be precise, the rocks would be him, and he would be the rocks. The situation would only turn even more perilous.

“I just need to hold it down, not kill it, so its strong defense is useless,” Tsukuyomi said calmly.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to ask Tsukuyomi how she was planning on holding down the stone beast, he saw a ghost suddenly fly above it.

The stone beast had been fighting the ghosts the entire time and had killed many ghosts, but in Tsukuyomi’s domain, the ghosts were immortal. It killed the ghosts again and again, but the ghosts continued to revive. They kept pestering the stone beast, preventing it from attacking its true opponent, Tsukuyomi.

The ghost that flew above the stone beast was a wrinkled granny ghost. She extended her withered hands that resembled bird claws and pulled.

Zhou Wen immediately noticed fine threads that resembled strands of hair appearing on the stone beast’s body. The threads were countless and quickly intertwined. Soon, they weaved into hair ropes that bound the stone beast.

The hair ropes formed a net again, trapping the stone beast. The stone beast tried to tear the net, but like a fish, the more it struggled, the tighter the net became. The hair rope bound its limbs, making it abnormally difficult to move.

The hundred ghosts split into four teams and each team grabbed one end of the hair net. No matter which direction the stone beast charged in, the ghosts would exert their strength to hold it back.

The stone beast charged left and right, but found it difficult to escape. The hair net was extremely tenacious and elastic, perfectly restraining a powerful creature like the stone turtle.

More importantly, after being caught by the net, the stone turtle could no longer use the power of the Stone Escape to teleport. It lost its most effective teleportation method.

“That’s the legendary Kokuri babā, right?” Zhou Wen had previously studied the Ghost Parade. He roughly guessed her identity from her abilities.

Kokuri babā was the wife of a monk. Due to her dishonorable actions, she became a demon and specially gathered the hair of the dead to braid.

“That’s right. The attack of the hundred ghosts is only to create time for Kokuri babā. Only with enough ghost hair forming a net can we trap the stone beast,” Tsukuyomi explained.

Zhou Wen naturally understood what was happening as he thought to himself,?The ghosts in Tsukuyomi’s domain have their own characteristics and abilities. Such a Calamity Zone is clearly more terrifying than the stone beast’s singular domain. I wonder what kind of domain power I can produce in the future.

If Zhou Wen were to make a choice, he would definitely be biased towards Tsukuyomi’s domain. It had more variation and allowed him to use different methods to restrain different enemies.

However, a domain wasn’t something Zhou Wen could decide.

Zhou Wen guessed that the type of domain was related to his talent, bloodline, and Essence Energy Art. He also needed to see what dimensional zone he used to advance to the Terror grade.

However, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand how to use the dimensional zones’ powers to advance to the Calamity grade.

“What are you waiting for? Let’s see if your sword can kill it now,” Tsukuyomi warned when she saw Zhou Wen standing there in a daze.

Only then did Zhou Wen snap to his senses. Realizing that the stone beast had been restrained, its speed no longer fast among Calamity-grade creatures, it was impossible for it to dodge Zhou Wen’s attack thanks to the ghost hair net’s restraints.

Zhou Wen pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword without any hesitation and slashed at the stone beast’s neck with Immortal Slaying.

Clang!

The Immortal Culling Sword slashed at its neck, leaving a gash. Rubble splattered, causing the stone beast to roar in pain. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Although the injury wasn’t serious to the stone beast, killing it was only a matter of time since damage was possible. It was a matter of how many strikes were needed.

Zhou Wen gripped the Immortal Culling Sword tightly as his figure flashed erratically. He slashed at the stone beast’s neck again and again, causing the wound to widen.

The stone beast was a dimensional creature that focused on physical attacks after all. Unable to close the distance with Stone Escape, it could only be thrashed by Zhou Wen.

“This fellow’s defense is really terrifying. If this continues, I’ll probably need another thirty to forty strikes to sever its neck!” Zhou Wen had already slashed dozens of times, but he only managed to slice off a small chunk of the stone beast’s neck.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to slash again, he saw the stone beast suddenly roar at the sky. The stone monument on its back flew up by itself. Without the stone monument’s suppression, the stone beast’s Strength and Speed increased drastically. It shook its body crazily and sent the ghosts that were pulling the net flying.

He dragged the ghost hair net into the rocks. Some of the remaining ghosts continued clinging onto the ghost hair net, but were unable to stop it. They slammed into the rocky ground.

The stone beast vanished. Only the stone monument floated in the air and emitted a strange light. The surrounding rocks grew crazily.

“Be careful!” Zhou Wen was searching for the stone beast when Tsukuyomi suddenly instant transmitted to his side and pushed him away.

Almost at the same time, the stone beast tore out from the rocks below. The horn on its head slammed into Tsukuyomi, sending her flying.

Bang!

Tsukuyomi’s body slammed into a stone wall, causing a large chunk to collapse. The ghosts and domain also vanished.

“Tsukuyomi!” Zhou Wen instant transmitted into the rubble and swept away the surrounding rocks. He realized that Tsukuyomi was held down on the ground and was on her last breath. He reached out to pull her body and realized that her body was limp as though she had no bones. Her bones had probably been shattered by the stone beast’s strike.

“I… I won’t make it… Before I die… Can you satisfy my last wish…” Tsukuyomi forced her eyes open and said with great difficulty..
