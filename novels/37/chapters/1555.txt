Chapter 1556: No Submission

Translator: CKtalon

The remaining half of the vine sword in Zhou Wen’s hand suddenly became even more terrifying. It was as though a sword emperor had descended. The terrifying sword intent pressure instantly caused the thousands of swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb to fall to the ground. Some swords couldn’t even withstand the pressure of the sword intent as they constantly trembled and shattered with a bang.

The few swords that weren’t affected by the vine sword trembled non-stop. Sword hums sounded incessantly as though they were competing for supremacy.

An ancient sword that was originally unmoved exploded inside the grave. The ancient sword also fell from the exploded grave and hit the ground, motionless. Like a subject prostrating in worship, the other swords began to shake.

Zhou Wen felt the sword intent the most directly. He could clearly sense that it wanted to bring its will into Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy Art and form a Calamity Zone that was completely compatible with it.

The sword intent that had already been thrown into disarray in Zhou Wen’s body was rapidly restoring order under the intense restraints of the vine sword intent. It began building the Calamity Zone again.

Zhou Wen was a stubborn person. Now that the vine sword was forcefully condensing a Calamity Zone, how could he accept it?

Since I can’t use the power of those swords to commit suicide, I’ll kill myself.?With a thought, the Golden Wyrm Scissors immediately flew out and transformed into a golden beam that snipped at the blood-colored avatar’s head.

Clang!

The halved vine sword moved autonomously and blocked the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ strike. A powerful Hell-level weapon like the Golden Wyrm Scissors could slice apart creatures of the same level, but it was blocked by the halved vine sword and failed to continue its snip.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors attacked a second time after failing to deliver a conclusive strike, but the halved vine sword was extremely magical. It blocked the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attack again and again. Even if the Golden Wyrm Scissors slashed at it with all its might, it was still blocked by the vine sword.

Zhou Wen tried his best to control his hands, but it was useless. Under the influence of the vine sword, his hands involuntarily moved with the vine sword, blocking the Golden Wyrm Scissors again and again.

As for the sword intent fragments in Zhou Wen’s body, they were gradually sucked back into Sword Pill.

“Even if you are really a sword immortal from the heavens, you can’t force me to do something I don’t like.” Seeing that the Golden Wyrm Scissors couldn’t be used, Zhou Wen summoned all his pets.

If people were to see so many high-level Companion Beasts, they would probably be extremely envious and jealous. However, they would probably be shell-shocked to see the Companion Beasts desperately attacking their master.

Perhaps many people had never seen Companion Beasts attack their master in their lives.

Zhou Wen’s various Companion Beasts—Golden Wyrm Scissors, Golden Sniper, Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Golden Battle God, Tyrant Behemoth, and so on—were summoned by Zhou Wen as long as they were above the Terror grade. He made them attack him with all their might.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

However, the vine sword was invincible. It blocked all the attacks from so many Companion Beasts and even killed many of them.

The Golden Sniper’s bullet shattered as the Golden Battle God was instantly parted at its waist. Tyrant Behemoth, who had just advanced to the Calamity grade, was forced back hundreds of meters by the strike despite using Absolute Strength and Overlord Zone.

Holy sh*t, what the hell is this vine sword? Is it that powerful??It wasn’t that Zhou Wen had never seen a ferocious dimensional creature, but he had never seen one as ferocious as the vine sword.

The vine sword seemed determined to fuse into Zhou Wen’s Calamity Zone. The shocking sword intent raged out, causing the Companion Beasts to retreat.

I really don’t believe it. It’s not easy to live, but can it be difficult to die??Zhou Wen summoned the Ancient Splitting Spore and made it explode in his body. Doctor Darkness attached himself to Zhou Wen in his soul form, but he didn’t help him fight. Instead, he spread poison within Zhou Wen.

Unfortunately, their levels were a little low, so they failed to severely injure Zhou Wen’s body.

Zhou Wen wasn’t dead, but due to the explosion of the Ancient Splitting Spore, Zhou Wen’s body suffered a serious shock. The Qi Refinement Art that was circulating immediately lost its Essence Energy, causing Sword Pill to lose control.

Elsewhere, the Soul Mirror’s Soul-Suppression Divine Light shone on the vine sword, causing a black halo to appear over it. It looked like it had played a certain role.

However, in the next second, Zhou Wen’s body was driven by the vine sword. He appeared in front of the Soul Mirror as though he had instant transmitted and shattered it with one strike.

This fellow is a little afraid of the Soul Mirror??Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

After fighting for so long, the vine sword only guided Zhou Wen’s arm to fight, killing or repelling any Companion Beasts that approached.

That was done with Zhou Wen standing in the same spot previously. Only when the Soul Mirror’s Soul-Suppression Divine Light descended did the vine sword take the initiative to attack. It was somewhat different from the passive battle from before.

The Soul Mirror was shattered by it. I don’t have a second Companion Beast of the same type. Even if I know that the vine sword is afraid of the Soul Mirror’s power, I don’t have any means to restrain it. Could it be that it’s really condensing a domain just like that??Zhou Wen was depressed. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He no longer had any other means to use. His body was controlled, and his Companion Beasts couldn’t defeat the vine sword. All he could do was condense the domain.

Just as Zhou Wen believed that the outcome was set and that there was no way to reverse the situation, a sword flew over.

Strange, why would a sword fly over at such a time??Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

As the vine sword’s sword intent was so powerful, it suppressed all the swords, preventing them from even moving. None of them dared to approach Zhou Wen.

However, the sword didn’t seem to be suppressed by the vine sword’s sword intent. It flew straight at Zhou Wen and with an unsheathing sound, the sword flew out of its scabbard and stabbed at Zhou Wen’s chest.

That’s… Son of Heaven’s Three Swords…?Zhou Wen was alarmed. The sword that flew over was actually the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords that Zhou Wen hadn’t been able to pull out.

Although the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was only at the Terror grade, Zhou Wen had yet to pull it out to date. Now that it had unsheathed itself, how could Zhou Wen not be alarmed?

Something’s amiss! Previously, when I used it against enemies, I couldn’t pull it out no matter what. Now that I’m letting it kill me, it actually unsheathed itself. What the hell is this??Zhou Wen, who was supposed to be pleasantly surprised, became even more depressed when he thought of this.

The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was formed from the fusion of Light Concealment, Shadow Concealment, and Night Immaculate. However, it didn’t seem to have inherited the ability of invisibility from the three swords. It was always visible with the scabbard.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords didn’t have the ability to turn invisible, but when he saw it unsheathed, he realized that he couldn’t see its blade.. All he felt was a powerful sword intent condense in front of the hilt, stabbing sharply at Zhou Wen’s chest.
