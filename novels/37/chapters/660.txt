Chapter 661: Evenly Matched

Li Xuan couldn’t see the trajectory of the battle either. All he could do was summon his Life Soul. His body was immediately covered by the carapace, and his eyes had an eye mask similar to that of a certain insect.

With the augmentation of the Life Soul, the battle scene Li Xuan saw slowed down significantly.

“Amazing. One doesn’t need to be afraid of potent strength or ruthless skill, but one needs to be afraid of such a highly-intelligent Companion Beast. For a Companion Beast to have such high intelligence, it’s impossible for a Mythical Companion Beast of the same level to win against them. It’s similar to a bug-like existence in games,” Li Xuan said.

“That’s right. Intelligence is indeed a hidden attribute of a Companion Beast. A Companion Beast with high intelligence is indeed at an advantage in battle.” Zhou Wen nodded in agreement.

He also liked to use highly-intelligent Companion Beasts like Banana Fairy, Demonic Neonate, and Doctor Darkness. Even if Zhou Wen didn’t give them orders, they knew when and what to do.

Sometimes, their decisions exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations.

As for the brainless representatives, like Tyrant Behemoth, Six-Winged, and Golden Battle God Halberd, they relied on their instincts to fight. Their intelligence was much lower.

It couldn’t be said that this was bad. If one’s strength was strong enough, such combat instinct could push their strength to the limit and erupt with 120% of their combat strength.

However, if one were to encounter an evenly matched opponent, such brainless Companion Beasts would be at a disadvantage.

However, Zhou Wen’s mind wasn’t on these Companion Beasts. He was even more interested in Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword techniques and Count of the Wind’s movement techniques. He was completely immersed in them as he sensed the two completely different approaches.

One was about claiming supremacy, while the other was about being calm and composed. The two were extremes.

And these two extremes were similar to the one Zhou Wen had when he first understood the divine Transcendent Flying Immortal.

Count of the Wind and Primordial Sword Immortal were evenly matched. Neither of them had the upper hand, but up to now, they had yet to use their Wheel of Destiny.

Ordinary citizens were fidgeting in anxiety because they could only see the glow. They couldn’t see the details of the battle. Only a few Epic experts with visual abilities could see the battle clearly.

Thankfully, modern filming equipment was already very advanced. There would be slow-motion replays in the future. Coupled with the commentary, most people would be able to understand it clearly.

Zhou Wen was engrossed in watching when Count of the Wind suddenly retreated from the battle. Without any warning, he admitted defeat and left the battlefield.

“Why did he admit defeat? The victory clearly wasn’t decided yet,” Li Xuan said in a daze.

As Zhou Wen had been taking in their sword techniques and movement techniques, he had a deeper understanding of them than Li Xuan. He shook his head and said, “Count of the Wind and Primordial Sword Immortal are very close in every aspect. If they continue fighting, they can only use their Wheels of Destiny. The Xia family clearly doesn’t want to go all out yet. It’s just a probe, so they have chosen to give up.”

“What a pity. Such a divine-level battle is much more interesting than watching those Strength-type Companion Beasts fight,” Li Xuan said.

Zhou Wen also felt that he hadn’t had enough. He got up and said, “Let’s go to the training grounds. I gained some insight from watching their battle. I liked to experiment to see if I’m right or wrong.”

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Li Xuan agreed immediately. The two of them went to the training grounds and found an independent training room.

“I will try to imitate Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword techniques. Help me check to see if it’s correct.” Zhou Wen picked up a practice sword and recalled Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword intent as he slashed at Li Xuan.

“Interesting, but it’s not domineering enough. You still have some reservations about this strike. You should be more resolute.” Li Xuan didn’t take out his weapon as he used his carapace to block the practice sword.

“Is this enough?” Zhou Wen slashed out again. At the same time, he tried his best to fuse his emotions into the Primordial Sword Immortal’s sword intent realm.

“Not enough... Not enough... It’s still not enough...” Li Xuan constantly fought Zhou Wen. As Zhou Wen’s sword techniques became faster and faster, he no longer had the time to say that it was inadequate. Every time Zhou Wen attacked, Li Xuan would only say no.

Zhou Wen gradually became one with the will, as his intent fused with the sword. The feeling of using the sword grew stronger and stronger. He gradually realized that the dominance of Primordial Sword Immortal wasn’t because his sword techniques were fast and ruthless, but because it attacked the key spots. It prevented the opponent from counterattacking, so there was no need for defense.

Clang!

Zhou Wen’s practice sword slashed at Li Xuan. Although he had only used a practice sword, he had actually left a sword mark on Li Xuan’s carapace because the sword beam was too powerful.

“Interesting. Again.” Li Xuan was very excited.

Zhou Wen was also feeling excited as he brandished his sword without any hesitation to slash at Li Xuan. The more he fought, the more he reveled in the feeling of this sword technique.

Defense? What the hell was that? I’ll slash out with my sword. Those who follow me will live, those who oppose me will die. There was no need for defense. With one sword in hand, I’m the best in the world.

The more Zhou Wen fought, the more arrogant he became. He wasn’t usually an arrogant person, but under the influence of the sword intent, his attacks became more and more violent.

Crack! Crack!

Li Xuan wasn’t able to completely block Zhou Wen’s sword technique. Sword marks appeared over his carapace, but the armor was immediately restored to its original state upon cracking. Its self-healing speed was unbelievably fast.

Clang!

Zhou Wen slashed at Li Xuan again. The practice sword made of special rubber couldn’t withstand the domineering sword beam and shattered.

“My turn.” Li Xuan leaped up and drew a practice sword from the weapon rack. He slashed at Zhou Wen, using an identical sword technique that Zhou Wen had just used.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. He knew that Li Xuan’s Life Soul could sense the enemy’s techniques and gain experience from suffering injuries, but he never expected that he could learn the techniques that humans used.

Li Xuan’s strike wasn’t much worse than the one he had used.

However, this made Zhou Wen even more excited. “Don’t worry about me. Use all your strength.”

Zhou Wen didn’t have a carapace protecting him. Although Li Xuan’s sword technique was right, it didn’t have that domineering aura. That was why Zhou Wen felt confident. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Alright.” Li Xuan didn’t hold back any further. He used all the experience he had just absorbed from his injuries in battle. A domineering sword beam immediately filled the sword.

Zhou Wen recalled Count of the Wind’s movement technique and concept and began mimicking his movement technique to circle around Li Xuan.

Movement techniques were Zhou Wen’s forte. They were easier to use than sword techniques, so he got into the groove faster than with the sword technique.

...

Gulli and Sadie had just finished watching the battle between Count of the Wind and Primordial Sword Immortal. Sadie’s Eye of Odin had seen more things. She wanted to study the battle between Count of the Wind and Primordial Sword Immortal with Gulli, so they had come to the training grounds.

They also wanted to find a private training room, but they realized that there were already people inside. Just as they were feeling depressed, they suddenly heard the whistling sound of sword aura coming from the training room beside them.
