After Tyrant Behemoth appeared, it directly activated Absolute Strength. Space distorted as the Pure Hook and Evil-Slaying swords were attracted towards Tyrant Behemoth.

Although Xia Liuchuan had tried his best to escape this situation, Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength was just too powerful. He couldn’t escape the two Mythical swords as he flew towards Tyrant Behemoth with his sword.

Zhou Wen didn’t stop as he ran towards the Gate of Supreme Harmony without waiting for the outcome.

Zhou Wen couldn’t run fast while carrying the wooden log. Before he reached the Gate of Supreme Harmony, he suddenly heard a terrifying sound. The shock wave broke through the sound barrier and produced a terrifying sonic boom.

Zhou Wen turned his head and saw Xia Liuchuan levitating in midair. He was wearing a strange black armor that resembled some kind of black jade. It also emitted a mysterious black light.

Xia Liuchuan held Pure Hook and Evil-Slaying with both hands as he crossed them in front of him, blocking Tyrant Behemoth’s punch. He wasn’t sent flying.

That’s... Guardian... Zhou Wen could tell that the armor was somewhat odd. Its aura didn’t seem like a Companion Beast but resembled more of a Guardian.

Furthermore, Xia Liuchuan was able to withstand Tyrant Behemoth in its Absolute Strength state. This wasn’t something an ordinary Companion Beast armor could do.

Xia Liuchuan wasn’t at a disadvantage when fighting Tyrant Behemoth. The two swords in his hands criss-crossed as he fought Tyrant Behemoth.

When Zhou Wen saw that Xia Liuchuan didn’t have the upper hand, he immediately continued running towards the Gate of Supreme Harmony. He had to first escape the log. Otherwise, even if the Guardian was in front of him, he wouldn’t be able to kill the Guardian while carrying it.

Zhou Wen rushed past the Gate of Supreme Harmony and couldn’t help but stop. This was because after passing the gates, there were many people standing in the open space. There were probably more than ten thousand of them.

The ten thousand people stood in a square formation on the empty ground. Each of them held a sword in their hands, but no one spoke. They were silent.

Upon seeing Zhou Wen walk over, the eyes of the ten thousand people looked at him in unison.

In front of the square formation stood a woman in black. She was none other than the Xia Xuanyue whom Zhou Wen knew.

“Zhou Wen, why are you here instead of dueling Xia Liuchuan?” Xia Xuanyue asked Zhou Wen.

“Ahem, I’m just taking a stroll. It’s rare to come to the legendary Forbidden City. I want to see the legendary Hall of Supreme Harmony,” Zhou Wen said with a light cough.

“It’s best you go back and fight. Forbidden City isn’t a place outsiders can enter as they wish,” Xia Xuanyue said.

“Since I’m already here, let me take a look.” Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t willing to retreat. Although the Xia family was already wary of him, he had to make an attempt on the Hall of Supreme Harmony regardless.

Just as Zhou Wen took two steps forward, Xia Xuanyue raised the ancient sword in her hand. The ten thousand people raised the sword in their hands at the same time. In an instant, countless sword beams surged into the sky and condensed towards the ancient sword in Xia Xuanyue’s hand.

With the augmentation of more than ten thousand ancient swords, the sword beam produced by the ancient sword in Xia Xuanyue’s hand was already terrifying beyond imagination. Even the Golden Overlord Sword paled in comparison.

Zhou Wen could roughly tell that the ancient sword in Xia Xuanyue’s hand was similar to the Golden Harp. They could gather some kind of power.

The difference was that the Golden Harp allowed sound waves to resonate, while the ancient sword in Xia Xuanyue’s hand could condense the sword beams of other sword-type Companion Beasts.

Every sword in the sword formation of more than ten thousand people was probably an Epic Companion Beast. With the augmentation of more than ten thousand sword beams, and the fact that the ancient sword might be at the Mythical stage, the might of the sword was probably not inferior to a top-notch Mythical creature.

“Zhou Wen, you should return to fight Xia Liuchuan,” Xia Xuanyue said to Zhou Wen.

“What if I insist on touring Forbidden City?” Zhou Wen walked towards the sword formation.

Xia Xuanyue slashed with her sword as a terrifying sword beam slashed down like a heavenly river. It was difficult for Zhou Wen to dodge, so he could only use the Golden Overlord Sword’s Golden Sword Aura to meet it.

The Golden Sword Aura was indestructible. In the beginning, it had indeed sliced through the sword beam that resembled a heavenly river, but the sword beam seemed to pour down endlessly. Soon, it drowned the Golden Sword Aura.

Xia Xuanyue didn’t really slash down. She retracted the ancient sword in her hand and the sword beam circled back like a dragon before returning to the sword formation.

“Please return,” Xia Xuanyue said expressionlessly.

With a thought, Zhou Wen turned around and left the Gate of Supreme Harmony. The ten-thousand sword formation was just too powerful. It would probably take quite some time to storm through it. Zhou Wen planned on heading to the unguarded building to give it a try to prevent any delays.

When Xia Liuchuan saw Zhou Wen come out, he had no intention of attacking him. He continued fighting Tyrant Behemoth.

When Tyrant Behemoth used Absolute Strength, it could only fight Xia Liuchuan to a draw. Once Absolute Strength ran out, it probably wouldn’t be Xia Liuchuan’s match.

Zhou Wen rushed to the Corner Tower and, when he arrived in front of it, he leaped up and jumped onto the city wall before jumping to the top of the Corner Tower.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to complete the jump in one try, but the log was too heavy. He couldn’t do it with a single jump.

Zhou Wen erected the log at the top of the Corner Tower and realized that there was no reaction. He tried to release the log and the word “slave” immediately appeared on his forehead.

It’s not here? Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed as he carried the log down Corner Tower. He knew that this time, he could only attempt the Myriad Sword Formation led by Xia Xuanyue.

It was highly likely that the peak of Forbidden City was the top of the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

After this ordeal, Absolute Strength didn’t have much time left. There were probably only about ten minutes left.

Xia Liuchuan clearly wanted to defeat Tyrant Behemoth first, so he wasn’t in a rush to chase after Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen passed through the door again and could already see the Hall of Supreme Harmony in front of him. However, with the Myriad Sword Formation obstructing him, it was impossible to gain passage without destroying it.

The ten-thousand sword formation’s might is too powerful. Among my Companion Beasts, probably only Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World can match it. If Truth Listener breaks two earrings, it might be able to put up a fight, but it’s not convenient for either of them to be exposed... Zhou Wen thought of something as his eyes suddenly lit up.

“Zhou Wen, why are you back?” Xia Xuanyue asked with a frown when she saw Zhou Wen running over.

“Xia Liuchuan isn’t my match. There’s no point in fighting him. I still want to visit the Hall of Supreme Harmony,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards Xia Xuanyue.

Xia Xuanyue raised her sword again without any hesitation. The sword formation regenerated as a terrifying sword beam emitted a terrifying might. From afar, it made one’s scalp tingle.

With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned a Companion Beast.

This Companion Beast wasn’t Torch Dragon or Truth Listener, nor was it Demonic Neonate. Instead, it was a beautiful girl. She was unbelievably beautiful. She had long hair that made all women envious, and her eyes were extremely charming. It was as though a single glance would entrance one, preventing them from moving their eyes away.

The Xia family disciples in the Myriad Sword Formation couldn’t help but look at the beautiful girl.
