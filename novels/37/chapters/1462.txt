Chapter 1463 Something Happened in Guide Ancient City

Zhou Wen had never entered the Golden Palace in reality. In reality, even if he succeeded in clearing the level, the metal ball would automatically fly out of the Golden Palace before transferring out of it.

Even during the final attempt, a stream of energy spewed out of the Golden Palace and injected into the metal ball before the Golden Palace self-destructed. Up to now, no one knew what the Golden Palace looked like.

That was clearly not the case in-game. He wouldn’t obtain the metal ball before reaching the Golden Palace, nor would there be any energy gushing out. In-game, this was the first time the Golden Palace had opened its door, but nothing came out. There was only a resplendent golden light inside, and nothing could be seen.

The Calamity gunner dropped a Strength Crystal which Zhou Wen fed to a Companion Beast. Without any hesitation, he walked through the door and quickly blended into the golden light.

Zhou Wen was already prepared for battle as he pushed the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation to its limits.

He guessed that there might be a Golden Wyrm in the Golden Palace, and it might not only be at the Human Realm.

However, Zhou Wen was taken aback when he saw the situation in front of him.

The huge metallic palace was cylindrical. On the surrounding circular walls, there were huge Golden Wyrm statues hanging down at fixed distances. There were a total of thirteen.

All the Golden Wyrms looked down towards the center of the palace with their tails up.

There was a strange metal artifact there. It looked a little like a tripod cauldron, but it didn’t have feet. Furthermore, it was wide at the top and very narrow at the bottom.

Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up the strange metal artifact, the door automatically closed. He then saw the Golden Wyrm statues come to life.

The Golden Wyrms swooped down at Zhou Wen. In the air, they transformed into shears.

Zhou Wen hurriedly took out the Soul Mirror, but the Soul Mirror only managed to illuminate one of the shears with the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. The other scissors had already arrived beside him.

Pa! Pa! Pa!

A few shears snipped at the Soul Mirror, shattering it.

The shears possessed potent destructive power. The Soul Mirror’s defense wasn’t weak at the Human Realm, but it couldn’t even withstand three strikes.

Zhou Wen knew that summoning other Companion Beasts wasn’t of much use now, so he decided to circulate the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation with all his might and donned the Dragon King armor.

The Dragon King armor was transformed from the Limitless Demon Dragon King. Although its defense couldn’t compare to the Prisoned Dragon armor, it had a very powerful ability. It could combine the powers of different creatures.

With the Limitless Demon Dragon King’s Limitless Wheel, Zhou Wen could share the strength of eight Companion Beasts. With their strength, he was essentially nine in one. Unfortunately, the Soul Mirror had just been shattered. Otherwise, with the power of the Soul Mirror, Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation would have been even stronger.

Now, Zhou Wen had borrowed the power of eight Terror-grade Companion Beasts and had similarly obtained a huge improvement. The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation’s range was much bigger.

The shears formed by the Golden Wyrms rushed in front of Zhou Wen and ended up trapped by the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. They constantly spun around Zhou Wen, failing to injure him.

There’s a chance! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The thirteen shears charged one after another into the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, but they failed to break through.

Thirteen sharp golden beams rapidly spun around Zhou Wen like circles of golden light.

My Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation is the nemesis of such physical offensive weapons. As expected of a skill I developed. It only needs one word to describe it-strong. Zhou Wen was somewhat smug.

A Terror-grade creature could withstand the siege of thirteen Calamity-grade creatures without being damaged at all. Anyone would be somewhat smug.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen could only trap them and didn’t have the ability to kill them. All he could do was watch them charge left and right in the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Array.

Unfortunately, my Golden Wyrm is still giving birth. Otherwise, I could have tried killing them. Bamboo Blade is only at the Terror grade after all. I probably won’t be able to gain an advantage when facing a Calamity-grade shear. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and ignored the shears as he walked towards the metal artifact in the middle of the hall.

Apart from the thirteen Golden Wyrms, there was only one artifact in the hall. Zhou Wen wanted to see if there was anything inside. His senses were sharp, much less Truth Listener’s, but he couldn’t sense what was inside the metal artifact.

Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to approach the metal artifact. After taking a few steps, he suddenly saw a strange light flash from it. Before Zhou Wen could figure out what had happened, the game screen went black.

What the hell was that? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He didn’t even understand how he had died.

Unfortunately, he could only enter the Venusian instance dungeon once a day. Even if Zhou Wen wanted to continue studying it, he had to wait until tomorrow.

He summoned the Soul Mirror but didn’t discover the Metal Guards or the Golden Battle Gods in it. Zhou Wen was even more disappointed.

From the looks of it, the dimensional creatures that are stored in the mirror world in-game can’t be brought to the real world. Zhou Wen put away the Soul Mirror and was about to head to Mount Laojun to take a look when he suddenly heard An Sheng’s voice.

“Young Master, there’s news from Guide City. It’s said that a large number of break-out creatures have rushed out of Guide Ancient City,” An Sheng said outside his room.

“Guide Ancient City has been breached? How’s the situation now?” Zhou Wen’s expression changed as he hurriedly opened the door and asked An Sheng

Guide Ancient City was called Ancient Sovereign City in-game. Even The Thearch wanted the stone saber there.

Zhou Wen didn’t even dare pull out the stone saber. With the stone saber’s suppression, it was unlikely for Guide Ancient City’s seal to undergo a break-out. Now that a large number of break-out creatures had suddenly appeared, Zhou Wen was afraid that someone had pulled out the stone saber.

It didn’t matter if others pulled out the stone saber. Zhou Wen was most afraid that the stone saber would fall into The Thearch’s hands.

“The situation isn’t good. In the past, there were only some low-level dimensional creatures in Guide Ancient City. Even Epic creatures were rare. However, among the dimensional creatures that rushed out this time, there are many Mythical creatures. The local garrison can’t deal with them at all. They are retreating in defeat. Overseer has already sent reinforcements.” An Sheng gave a situation report. “Ah Sheng, help me inform Sis Lan that I won’t be eating with her tonight. I need to return to Guide City.” Zhou Wen walked out of the door and wanted to teleport over, but after some hesitation, he decided to take Chick along.

There were many skeleton creatures in Guide Ancient City. Chick’s phoenix flames were the nemesis of such creatures.

I hope the stone saber is still there! Zhou Wen used his teleportation ability and headed for the vicinity of Guide Ancient City.
