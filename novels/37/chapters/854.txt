Chapter 855: Giant God Sovereign

Translator: CKtalon

They no longer needed to fear skills like Life Blast in midair. Moses and company sped up and chased after Zhou Wen crazily, but when Charlie predicted Zhou Wen’s location again, he realized that Zhou Wen was behind them.

“No good!” Charlie and Moses’s expressions changed drastically. This was because Zhou Wen’s current location was where they had separated from the others.

“Let’s go back quickly.” After Moses led his men back, they discovered the corpses of their companions not far from where they had parted. They had been blasted into pieces, and there were almost no complete corpses.

The surrounding forest was also in a mess. Clearly, a powerful explosion had happened. It wasn’t an ordinary Life Blast. The typical self-destruction of trees didn’t have such power.

“Zhou Wen, I’ll tear you to pieces.” Moses’s expression was livid as he urged Charlie to continue tracking Zhou Wen.

This time, Moses directly summoned Giant God Sovereign. After he fused with Giant God Sovereign, the armor transformed by Giant God Sovereign still remained huge. Moses was inside Giant God Sovereign’s body as the core existence inside Giant God Sovereign armor.

Moses, who was like a giant, grabbed Charlie and charged forward without caring if there were any Life Blast mechanisms nearby.

Indeed, large swaths of trees and grass exploded, but it was useless against the huge armor that Giant God Sovereign had transformed into. It was unable to injure it at all.

When Moses ran to the nearby water, tadpole-like things suddenly rushed out of the water. The tadpoles constantly exploded.

However, such power failed to injure Moses. All of Giant God Sovereign’s armor blocked the explosions.

“These things killed them.” Moses could tell from the tadpoles’ explosive mode that these were the things that killed their companions.

“Zhou Wen, your tricks are useless in front of absolute strength. Come out and die,” Moses said coldly.

Charlie had already predicted that Zhou Wen was less than five kilometers away and could definitely hear him.

Zhou Wen had already seen everything clearly with Truth Listener. He thought to himself, From the looks of it, Giant God Sovereign should be a Strength- and Defense-type Guardian. Tyrant Behemoth is also of the same type. It shouldn’t be weaker than Giant God Sovereign. However, Moses knows that Tyrant Behemoth is in my hands, yet he’s still so confident. He probably has a way to restrain Tyrant Behemoth.

Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he continued pulling away from Moses and company. However, after Moses donned the Giant God Sovereign armor, his speed was too fast. Not only was Zhou Wen unable to pull away, but the gap between them kept shrinking.

Zhou Wen didn’t mind. As he fled, he summoned a large number of Musical Note Sprites and Golden Harp. There were now tens of thousands of Musical Note Sprites. Together with the power of the Golden Harp, the sound waves produced were enough to kill an Epic expert.

Most importantly, it was very difficult for sound wave attacks to be completely blocked by armor. No matter how strong the defense of the Giant God Sovereign armor was, it could be penetrated by the sound waves and killed.

Moses chased after him with Charlie in a frenzy. Suddenly, he saw a large number of Musical Note Sprites and a Golden Harp. Before he could react, the Golden Harp suddenly sounded.

Hum!

With the sound of the Golden Harp, all the Musical Note Sprites sounded. The sound waves emitted were like a tidal wave that surged towards Moses.

“Ah!”

The sound wave failed to break through the armor of Giant God Sovereign, but Charlie, who was held in Moses’ hand, was bleeding from his seven orifices because of the sound wave. His Book of Prophecy and the crucifix could not defend against the sound blast.

Moses was alarmed. A golden barrier lit up over the Giant God Sovereign armor, protecting Charlie inside and thus, saving him.

The sound blast was unable to penetrate the barrier and was blocked outside. Just as Moses was about to destroy the Musical Note Sprites and harp, he realized that the Musical Note Sprites and harp had disappeared.

Moses rushed over at full speed, but he didn’t find Zhou Wen.

“Where did Zhou Wen escape to?” Moses asked Charlie. Charlie wiped the blood from his face and used the Book of Prophecy to predict Zhou Wen’s location again.

“Impossible... He’s here...” When Charlie saw the prediction, his eyes widened in disbelief. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At that moment, Zhou Wen’s figure appeared above Moses out of thin air. He held a golden broadsword in his hand and slashed at the golden barrier with an indomitable golden sword beam.

Clang!

A three-foot gap was slashed open in the golden barrier, but Zhou Wen’s sword couldn’t continue. The barrier wasn’t as simple as a shell. It also seemed corporeal. If not for the Golden Overlord Sword having the augmentation of Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable, it would have been impossible for it to slice open the barrier.

“You’ve finally appeared!” Moses wasn’t alarmed but delighted. He controlled the Giant God Sovereign armor and threw a punch at Zhou Wen.

However, Zhou Wen’s figure flashed in midair before suddenly disappearing.

Moses originally imagined that Zhou Wen was fast and had moved elsewhere, but when he looked around, he didn’t see Zhou Wen.

“Damn it, why are his skills so wretched? Where did he go? Quickly find him,” Moses gritted his teeth and said to Charlie.

Charlie used the Book of Prophecy to predict again, but he realized that Zhou Wen was already several kilometers away. He pointed in surprise and anger and said, “He’s over there. Don’t let him escape.”

With the virtually invincible ability of the Giant God Sovereign armor, Moses did not care if there was an ambush. He charged forward crazily. The tall trees were knocked away by the Giant God Sovereign armor like a huge humanoid machine.

Its defense is comparable to Tyrant Behemoth with Absolute Strength activated, but its strength is much weaker. However, in that case, it shouldn’t be able to defeat Tyrant Behemoth. What kind of power does Giant God Sovereign have that makes Moses so confident? Zhou Wen thought of various possibilities.

From the looks of it, I can only let Tyrant Behemoth give it a try. When Zhou Wen saw Moses chasing after him, he summoned Tyrant Behemoth.

Not daring to be careless, Zhou Wen got Tyrant Behemoth to activate Absolute Strength before charging at Moses.

“Good timing.” Moses finally had a combat target. His speed didn’t decrease but rose as he charged at Tyrant Behemoth.

Tyrant Behemoth also gathered all its strength and threw a punch at Moses, who was wearing the Giant God Sovereign armor.

A ruthless glint flashed in Moses’s eyes. He didn’t swing his fist to meet it. Instead, he used the golden barrier of the Giant God Sovereign armor to slam into Tyrant Behemoth.

Tyrant Behemoth’s fist struck the golden barrier, but it failed to send Moses retreating. Instead, it was sent flying as its fist bones shattered.

A repulsion barrier! With his experience, Zhou Wen immediately saw through the trick. Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t sent retreating by Giant God Sovereign, but was defeated by its own strength and the power of Giant God Sovereign.
