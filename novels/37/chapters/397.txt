Chapter 398 Seal

Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to absorb the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal. After putting it in his pocket, he left the Town God’s Temple with Wang Lu.

“What are we going to do later?” Wang Lu asked as they walked.

“Head back before reading books and playing games,” Zhou Wen blurted out his thoughts.

He still hadn’t found a way to condense a Life Soul for Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. Despite him already having three Life Souls and knowing he shouldn’t be so greedy, he wanted one that he couldn’t force. He still found it a knotty problem even though condensing a single Life Soul before thirty was considered a success.

“What’s the point of reading and gaming all day? Shall we go to the dimensional zone to hunt dimensional creatures?” Wang Lu suggested.

“I’m not going.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to enter a dimensional zone. Even if he were to grind, he could do it himself in-game. There was no need for him to risk his life in real life. If he accidentally died, he would truly be dead.

Wang Lu rolled her eyes at Zhou Wen and wanted to criticize him, but her eyes darted when she suddenly said, “By the way, didn’t you plan on killing the Binyang Cave’s tiger before? Do you want to make a trip there?”

Zhou Wen originally planned on returning to read and game, but after hearing Wang Lu’s words, his eyes lit up. “Can we?”

“With me around, there’s nothing you can’t do. You also want a baby tiger, right?” Wang Lu said with a smile.

“What are the conditions?” Zhou Wen asked as he cautiously looked at Wang Lu. He found it odd that Wang Lu would help him hunt the tiger for no reason.

“We are schoolmates, so it’s too tacky to name conditions. How about this? Based on the principle of mutually helping and showing love for each other, you have to lend a helping hand to a student with difficulties. During our semester time, you will be responsible for my breakfast,” Wang Lu said with a smile.

“Sure, you can have anything that the canteen has to offer,” Zhou Wen agreed without hesitation. Although breakfast over the years cost a lot of money, it was nothing compared to the baby tiger. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Do I look like I’m short of money?” Wang Lu rolled her eyes at him.

“Didn’t you tell me to cover your breakfast?” Zhou Wen looked at Wang Lu in puzzlement.

Wang Lu sighed and said, “We’re all schoolmates, so I won’t lie to you. Actually, I’ve had some weird disease since I was young. Every morning, I have a relapse and I am in so much pain that I have no way of getting out of bed. Breakfast time is exactly the time when I have a relapse. It’s been a long time since I had breakfast. If you don’t mind, I hope you can deliver breakfast to me every day.”

“I see. Don’t worry. As long as I’m in school, I’ll deliver breakfast to you on time.” Zhou Wen nodded. He felt a little sad for Wang Lu, having never expected her to have such a strange illness. It was no wonder he never saw her in the first half of the day.

“Then it’s a deal. Let’s go to Binyang Cave now,” Wang Lu said in satisfaction.

Zhou Wen followed Wang Lu to Dragon Gate Grotto. Zhou Wen felt that he should be concerned about Wang Lu’s condition, so he asked, “By the way, what kind of illness do you have? Do you have a solution?”

Wang Lu pondered for a moment before saying in all seriousness, “Every day at dawn, I’ll be possessed and sealed by a blanket monster. No matter what I do, I just can’t get up. The thought of waking up will be painful, excruciatingly painful...”

“Blanket monster... Seal...” Zhou Wen looked at Wang Lu in a daze.

“Don’t worry about me. I can still take it. I won’t admit defeat. I will resolutely fight the seal to the end. As long as you deliver breakfast on time every day, I can replenish my energy and have the strength to resist the seal.” Wang Lu wore a determined expression as she clenched her fists, as though she was encouraging herself.

Zhou Wen looked at Wang Lu, unsure of what to say.

Before they entered the school gate, he saw An Sheng standing beside the car.

“Zhou Wen, are you free? I have something important to discuss with you,” An Sheng said.

“You guys go ahead. I’ll be heading back now,” Wang Lu said as she winked at Zhou Wen. “Don’t forget our deal. Be on time tomorrow.”

“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded.

“Girlfriend?” An Sheng asked as he looked at the departing Wang Lu.

“No, ordinary friend.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

An Sheng smiled and said, “Wang Lu is destined to become the head of the Wang family. It’s not easy to marry her. None of the Wang family will agree to you marrying into the Wang family.”

“Didn’t I just say? We are just ordinary friends.” Zhou Wen was speechless.

An Sheng’s expression turned serious as he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Zhou Wen, there are new developments to Wang Mingyuan’s matter. You and the other three students are in a terrible situation. The League might send someone to take you back.”

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng in puzzlement.

An Sheng recounted what had happened to the League recently, leaving Zhou Wen dumbfounded.

“Was Teacher behind those humans who dimensionalized themselves and entered the dimensional zones?” Zhou Wen asked.

“It appears to be the case now. Therefore, the League has tried various means to stop such incidents from happening again. They will not let go of any possibility. Therefore, you, Hui Haifeng, Jiang Yan, and Zhong Ziya have become their main focus. Although they don’t dare to brazenly arrest you in Luoyang, they will definitely send someone to secretly abduct you,” An Sheng said.

“How’s Hui Haifeng and the rest?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Hui Haifeng is protected by his family, so there shouldn’t be too much of a problem. Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan seemed to have vanished into thin air. There’s no news at the moment,” An Sheng answered.

“That puts me at rest.” Zhou Wen wasn’t worried about his safety. As long as he wasn’t facing a large number of Epic experts, he believed that he had the ability to protect himself.

“Overseer hopes that you can go to the An family to accompany Madam,” An Sheng said ingeniously.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback when he heard that. However, he pondered for a moment before saying, “It’s better I stay on campus. After all, I’m not from the An family. It’s impossible for me to hide in the An family for the rest of my life.”

“Now isn’t the time to be impulsive. When the League sends their men, they will be top-notch Epic experts. Furthermore, they wouldn’t just appear in front of you. They will only attack in secret. It’s very likely that you would succumb without even knowing what happened,” An Sheng said.

“Ah Sheng, just as you said. A dimensional zone can lose its effectiveness at any time. When the time comes, can I still hide with the An family while all kinds of terrifying dimensional creatures are rampaging?” Zhou Wen asked.

An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen in silence. Zhou Wen continued, “I can’t rely on others for my entire life. As you know, I’ve already condensed a Life Soul. I want to try and protect myself with my strength.”

An Sheng fell silent for a long time before saying, “I respect your decision, but you have to remember that even if you have something against Overseer and Miss Jing, don’t treat Madam as an outsider. It will sadden her.”
