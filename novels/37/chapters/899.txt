Chapter 900: Mirror Eyes

Translator: CKtalon

As the blood was absorbed, the Demon God Catalog in his body circulated crazily. His essence, vitality, and spirit also circulated with the Demon God Catalog.

Essence, vitality, and spirit gradually gathered together, but they didn’t form an independent Life Soul. Instead, they fused into Zhou Wen’s eyes, making them gradually become crystal-clear.

This transparency was abnormal. Before long, Zhou Wen’s eyes turned into what Torch Dragon looked like when it activated the Bright Torch Vision World. They were like two eye-shaped mirrors.

When Zhou Wen’s eyes completely turned into mirrors, his Life Soul was finally condensed. Zhou Wen blinked and his eyes returned to normal. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

However, when he activated the Demon God Catalog, his eyes turned into mirrors again. From afar, he looked like a blind person without pupils.

Could it be that the Demon God Catalog’s ability is similar to Torch Dragon’s? Zhou Wen found it odd, but he didn’t dare look at his phone here.

However, regardless of what Life Soul it was, the Demon God Catalog’s ability to condense a Life Soul was enough for Zhou Wen. This Essence Energy Art was most likely used to strengthen his Constitution. It wouldn’t overlap with the Qi Refinement Art, so the eight Essence Energy Arts was likely complete.

“The Thearch, I’ll head back now. I’ll come back in a month.” Zhou Wen left Chess Mountain with Ya’er, but he was still thinking, Is The Thearch really Nine-Tailed Fox? Why do I feel that it’s unlikely to be the case?

After returning to school, Zhou Wen dared to take out his phone to look at the information on his new Life Soul.

Life Soul: Mirror Eyes (Primordial Body)

The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra that enhances Constitution also had an eye as a Life Soul, but it was a third eye. This Mirror Eyes overlaps with my eyes. I wonder what use it has. Zhou Wen switched on his phone, hoping to give it a try in-game to see if it had an ability similar to Bright Torch Vision World.

Soon, Zhou Wen was disappointed. He used the Mirror Eyes to look at the dimensional creatures, but it was useless. It didn’t produce the effects of Bright Torch Vision World.

Not only was there no vision, there was no light emitted at all. When he used the Mirror Eyes to look at things, it was no different from ordinary eyes.

It didn’t have the ability of vision, lethality, petrification, or charm. Zhou Wen tried all the visual abilities he could think of, but they were useless. It was as though his Life Soul didn’t exist.

What’s the use of this Life Soul? Could it be an ability that reflects the eyes? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he went to Medusa’s Curse Demon Palace.

Zhou Wen didn’t kill Medusa. Instead, he used his eyes to meet Medusa’s eyes.

The girl, Medusa, activated her Eyes of Enticement. When Zhou Wen’s eyes met hers, Zhou Wen, who should have been petrified, didn’t show any abnormalities. Instead, after the girl-formed Medusa was slightly jolted, her body gradually petrified.

It really works! Zhou Wen was delighted. Although it seemed to be a passive ability, there were many terrifying existences with Eye-type abilities. It would be a good Life Soul if it could restrain all Eye-type abilities.

Medusa had only just begun petrifying when she activated her snake-haired demoness form. After she transformed into a demoness, she used the Eyes of Petrification to look at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen continued using Mirror Eyes to fend her off, and the snake demoness’s eyes showed signs of petrification, but it wasn’t obvious.

Even the Eyes of Petrification can be reflected. I wonder what will happen when I face the Bright Torch Vision World? After killing the demoness and seeing that nothing useful dropped, Zhou Wen eagerly switched maps to Zhuolu. He wanted to head to the Torch Dragon temple to see if he could restrain Bright Torch Vision World.

When Zhou Wen stood in front of Torch Dragon Youngling and fought it, he forced it to use the Bright Torch Vision World.

Zhou Wen used Mirror Eyes to meet Torch Dragon Youngling’s gaze. Zhou Wen clearly felt that he wasn’t being sucked into the Vision World, but it only lasted for a short period of time. Then, the blood-colored avatar was sucked into the Vision World as the game screen went black.

Although he failed to restrain the Bright Torch Vision World, he was rather pleasantly surprised.

This was because Mirror Eyes had some influence on the Bright Torch Vision World. However, due to its weak strength, it was ultimately cracked by Bright Torch Vision World.

If Mirror Eyes can reach a Perfect Body, or even advance to the Mythical stage in the future, it might be able to resist the Bright Torch Vision World. With this possibility in mind, Zhou Wen became excited again as he began studying how to evolve Mirror Eyes.

However, despite trying many methods, Mirror Eyes didn’t show any changes. Be it using Mirror Eyes to reflect the power of Eye-type powers or using Essence Energy to strengthen Mirror Eyes, the outcome was useless.

Unable to find a way to advance Mirror Eyes for the time being, Zhou Wen was out of options. All he could do was go online and read up on some information regarding Eye-type powers. He hoped to obtain inspiration to find a way to advance Mirror Eyes.

Zhou Wen worked hard for two days and came up with all sorts of ideas, but they were useless.

It’s not a solution if this continues. I should make a trip to the East Sea first. I can raise Glimmer and also see if I can kill that dimensional creature that’s proficient in spatial teleportation. Zhou Wen took Ya’er along.

Zhou Wen guessed that Yin Talisman King wouldn’t come looking for trouble with him anytime soon. He didn’t expect Yin Talisman King to be that afraid of The Thearch that he wouldn’t dare cause trouble for him.

However, Yin Talisman King had lost an arm and looked to be seriously injured. It wouldn’t be easy for him to recover anytime soon.

It’s a pity that I didn’t get Yin Talisman King to hand over the Yin Talisman Sutra. That’s Yellow Emperor’s Essence Energy Art. It must be extraordinary, Zhou Wen thought regretfully.

The battle between Yellow Emperor and Chiyou back then was undoubtedly a battle between Guardians. Now, it was almost certain that Yellow Emperor and Chiyou had contracted Guardians. Furthermore, the Guardians they had contracted were definitely top-notch.

From the conversation between Yin Talisman King and The Thearch, the Guardian that Yellow Emperor contracted should be the Guardian of the Immortals. Then, which race did Chiyou’s Guardian come from? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare waste too much time on the way. He headed straight for the East Sea’s city, hoping to resolve the dimensional creature as soon as possible. If a Companion Egg dropped, it was very likely that he could resolve the advancement problem of Civilized Country.

Along the way, Zhou Wen was still extremely careful and wary of Yin Talisman King. Thankfully, Yin Talisman King didn’t appear, saving Zhou Wen a lot of trouble.

...

The Lu family’s Sea Gazing City was a newly-established city after the dimensional storms. As there were some good dimensional zones nearby, many powerful families migrated here, turning the originally small fishing village into the present Sea Gazing City.

The Lu family was a family that had migrated here. Now, the Lu family was basically the only major family in Sea Gazing City.
