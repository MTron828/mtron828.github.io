Chapter 1523 Unknown Land

Zhou Wen charged at Berserker Immortal, hoping to completely kill him to prevent any future trouble.

The change caught him by surprise as the myriad sword beams appeared too quickly. Unable to use instant transmission, he could only brandish his sword to meet the sword beams.

Thankfully, the sword beams spewed out in all directions, instead of being concentrated at Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen brandished the Immortal Culling Sword and the Golden Wyrm Scissors, hoping to shatter the sword beams ahead of him.

However, to his surprise, the sword beams were like phantoms. Be it the Immortal Culling Sword or the Golden Wyrm Scissors, they failed to touch the sword beams.

The sword beams even passed through Zhou Wen’s body, forming a blood-red chrysanthemum that bloomed before instantly disappearing. Zhou Wen immediately checked his body and didn’t discover any remnant imprints. He secretly heaved a sigh of relief. At the same time, he was puzzled as to what use the skill that Berserker Immortal had sacrificed himself for was.

However, when Zhou Wen looked around, he couldn’t help but be taken aback.

This wasn’t Dubhe at all. It was no longer scorching hot. Wherever he looked, there was an endless sea of beautiful flowers.

What is this place? Zhou Wen frowned as he looked around. He felt that this was Earth. The composition of the air was very similar to Earth.

However, after trying Singularity Universe, he realized that he couldn’t determine his location, nor could he teleport out.

Berserker Immortal sacrificed himself to teleport me here. It’s definitely not a good place. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan his surroundings, but other than the sea of flowers, there was nothing here.

What was even stranger was that there were only flowers here. Furthermore, there were no animals, no bees, no butterflies, not even a single insect, much less animals. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The flowers looked very ordinary and didn’t seem to be anything special. They weren’t dimensional plants.

What is this place? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out. All he could do was converge his aura, put on the Invisibility Cloak, and fly in a certain direction, hoping to discover some useful information.

As he didn’t know where he was, Zhou Wen didn’t dare fly too quickly. He slowly flew forward. The endless sea of flowers remained after flying for about fifty kilometers. However, a creature finally appeared in the sea of flowers.

That’s… the Devil? Zhou Wen looked at the creature sitting cross-legged in the sea of flowers and his heart sank.

The creature was covered in red skin and had horns on its head. On its back was a pair of bat-like wings. Its face was like an ox and it looked ugly and strange. It was very similar to the legendary Devil in the West District.

Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of the devil, but he thought of a serious problem.

If that was really a devil and this wasn’t Earth, could it be the dimension?

Don’t tell me that fellow teleported me to the dimension’s Devils? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss.

He had been to the dimension once. The spatial rules there were completely different from Earth’s universe. Mythical creatures found it difficult to move there.

Now that Zhou Wen was already at the Terror grade and could even match a Calamity-grade creature, there was definitely no problem with movement. However, it wasn’t to the point of not feeling anything.

The environment here didn’t seem like the dimension. Instead, it was very close to Earth’s.

As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, the devil creature sitting cross-legged in the sea of flowers opened its eyes. Its black eyes immediately lit up as it stood up. It was more than four meters tall. To humans, it was considered a giant.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. The devil-like creature flapped the wings on its back, causing the flowers around it to splatter everywhere. The devil’s figure vanished from Zhou Wen’s sight.

Clang!

The devil creature appeared above Zhou Wen and slashed at his head with its claw. Zhou Wen used the Golden Wyrm Scissors to block its claw.

It was so fast that Zhou Wen didn’t even have the time to open the Golden Wyrm Scissors. All he did was use the scissors to block the claw.

Zhou Wen felt a huge force coming from the Golden Wyrm Scissors. Unable to hold onto the Golden Wyrm Scissors, it was snatched away by the devil.

Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly ordered the Golden Wyrm Scissors to fly back.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors trembled incessantly in the devil’s claws, but it failed to escape its claws and fly back.

Zhou Wen was flabbergasted. The Golden Wyrm Scissors was a Hell-level Companion Beast, but it was actually immobilized. How powerful was that?

Berserker Immortal has indeed teleported me to a terrifying place! Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and turned around to instant transmit. He didn’t even want the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

It wasn’t that Zhou Wen didn’t want it, but if the devil could even control the Golden Wyrm Scissors, then Zhou Wen was on a completely different level from it. He would probably die if he went over to snatch the Golden Wyrm Scissors from it.

Just as Zhou Wen phased into existence, he saw a red light flash in front of him. The devil had already arrived in front of him. One of its claws grabbed the Golden Wyrm Scissors as its other claw swiped at Zhou Wen’s head.

The blade-like nails looked like they might pierce through Zhou Wen’s head and body if they really hit him.

Zhou Wen summoned the Prisoned Dragon armor and donned it. He also pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword and stabbed at the devil’s claw.

Chi!

The Immortal Culling Sword pierced through the devil’s claw. Although the devil didn’t cry out in pain, it subconsciously retracted its claw. Zhou Wen took the opportunity to instant transmit elsewhere.

However, just like the last time, just as Zhou Wen phased into existence, he saw a red shadow flash. The devil had caught up to him again, and its injured claws had already healed. It grabbed at Zhou Wen’s head again.

Zhou Wen now understood why Berserker Immortal hadn’t sent him to the dimension’s Immortals but to such a godforsaken place.

The Immortal Culling Sword had a very strong restraining effect on Immortals. If Immortals were injured by the Immortal Culling Sword, it would be very difficult for their wounds to heal. It was even possible for the wound to constantly spread.

However, against the devil, the Immortal Culling Sword’s effects weren’t that obvious. At the very least, it didn’t have any restraining effects.

Zhou Wen was extremely depressed. This devil wasn’t stronger than Berserker Immortal, who had been suppressed by Earth’s rules. However, Zhou Wen had had his most powerful weapon, the Golden Wyrm Scissors, snatched away from him. Previously, when he fought Berserker Immortal, the Soul Mirror had suffered serious damage. Now, it was still self-repairing and couldn’t be used for the time being.

He failed to gain the upper hand even with the Immortal Culling Sword.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to summon the Golden Sniper and have him shoot from afar to aid him in his battle with the devil.

Zhou Wen thought that as long as the Golden Sniper fired the seventh bullet, he could cause a certain level of restraining effect on the devil. He might even severely injure it.

To his surprise, just as the Golden Sniper fired the second bullet, the devil strangely appeared behind him and swatted the Golden Sniper who was hiding in the flowers, sending him and the sniper rifle flying.

If Zhou Wen hadn’t reacted fast enough and unsummoned the Golden Sniper, the Golden Sniper would probably have died if the devil dealt another blow.
