Although Moses and the rest were not on the stone platform, Giant God Sovereign was so huge that the people on the stone platforms also saw the terrifying body of Giant God Sovereign.

When Zhou Wen saw Giant God Sovereign, his eyes lit up. He could already smell the aura of the Guardian. Without a doubt, it was another Guardian.

Zhou Wen was still no match for the super powerful Guardians, but not every Guardian was that strong. Perhaps this Giant God Sovereign was about the same strength as the six-winged seraphim?

Zhou Wen wanted to take another look, but Moses had already unsummoned the Guardian.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and suddenly frowned. Don’t tell me that fellow wants to use the Guardian’s power to touch the Fiend Tomb? Isn’t that courting death?

When Guardians descended on Earth, they represented different dimensional races in battle. They were enemies against each other. Now, they were using one Guardian to blast the place where another Guardian was sleeping. It was obvious what would happen next.

Without a doubt, Goddess Ba sleeping in the Fiend Tomb would most likely go berserk. When that happened, the Zhang family wouldn’t be the only ones to suffer. Everyone would die.

Zhou Wen didn’t wish to die, nor did he wish for Zhang Yuzhi’s family to be destroyed. Therefore, he was already considering how he could stop the Zhang family if they really agreed to let the Guardian attack the Fiend Tomb.

Zhang Siyou was still considering Charlie’s and Moses’s suggestions. Two different solutions seemed to be worth a try, but at the same time, it was difficult to say which method would really work.

Both arguments had their merits. They hoped that the Zhang family could use their plans.

“Chunqiu, what do you think?” Zhang Siyou looked at Zhang Chunqiu and asked.

When Zhang Chunqiu was young, he had already helped his family to guard the Fiend Tomb. Furthermore, Zhang Siyou had the intention of grooming him into the Zhang family’s next Celestial Master. By asking Zhang Chunqiu now, not only did he want to know his opinion, but he also wanted to test him.

Zhang Chunqiu thought for a moment and bowed to Zhang Siyou. “Celestial Master, if possible, I wish to hear more plans before making a decision.”

“Unfortunately, other than our two families, no one has discovered the mask in the Fiend Tomb, much less come up with a solution to getting rid of it without damaging the Fiend Tomb,” said Moses.

Zhang Siyou looked at Zhang Chunqiu thoughtfully and asked, “Are there any other plans?”

Zhang Chunqiu hurriedly said, “Zhou Wen, who represents Luoyang’s An family, also has a plan that can resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb. Why don’t you listen to it first?”

“Is that Yuzhi’s friend?” Zhang Siyou clearly knew who Zhou Wen was.

“Yes, Yuzhi has a good relationship with Zhou Wen. She even saved Zhou Wen before. He has no ill intentions towards the Zhang family,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“Then invite him over to get him to tell me his plan,” Zhang Siyou said after some thought.

Zhang Chunqiu hurriedly agreed and went to look for Zhou Wen. Just as Zhang Chunqiu left, Charlie said, “Celestial Master, that Zhou Wen is just a kid with some luck. Don’t tell me you really believe him and are leaving such an important matter to him? This concerns the fate of the Zhang family. Please be careful!”

“There’s no harm in listening to more opinions. In the end, we’ll use the proposal that’s better,” Zhang Siyou said calmly.

Seeing that Zhang Siyou had made his decision, Charlie and Moses didn’t say anything else.

When Zhang Chunqiu saw Zhou Wen, he explained the situation in detail. He still believed Zhou Wen. After all, not only did Zhou Wen see the mask, but he also knew that there was a monster beneath it, as well as Ba further down.

As for Charlie and Moses, they had only discovered the topmost mask.

If he really wanted to give it a try, Zhang Chunqiu was more willing to believe Zhou Wen.

“They only discovered the mask. Ignoring the question of whether they can remove the mask, even if they can, the monster below is still there. It’s useless to remove the mask.” Zhou Wen paused for a moment and said to Zhang Chunqiu with a heavy expression, “Furthermore, I suspect that the Ba down there is actually a Guardian. We don’t know what the relationship between the Guardians is. If they are enemies, it will probably cause huge trouble if Moses uses a Guardian to attack the Fiend Tomb.”

Zhang Chunqiu frowned when he heard that. He asked, “Are you sure Ba is a Guardian?”

“I can’t be sure. After all, I can only see a portion of it through my penetrative vision. However, Ba does look like a Guardian,” Zhou Wen said.

“If there’s really such a possibility, we can’t let Moses try regardless. We can’t take such a risk.” Zhang Chunqiu had already made up his mind. He brought Zhou Wen along and said, “Follow me to the Celestial Master. Try your best to fight for an opportunity. I’ll help you from the side.”

“Alright,” Zhou Wen agreed and followed Zhang Chunqiu to Zhang Siyou’s side.

“Greetings, Celestial Master. I’m Zhou Wen.” Zhou Wen bowed at Zhang Siyou.

In the past, the Zhang family’s Hero King was the leader of the six heroes. Now, every Zhang family’s Celestial Master had a very special status in the Federation. Even the Senators of the six families were respectful in front of the Celestial Master, not daring to slight him.

“Since you are Yuzhi’s friend, there’s no need to stand on ceremony with me. I often hear Yuzhi mention you. I can tell that you are indeed a young hero.” Zhang Siyou sized up Zhou Wen and continued, “I heard that you also have a way to eliminate the influence of the Fiend Tomb. Can you elaborate?”

“My method is actually very simple. It’s to dig open the Fiend Tomb and kill the dimensional creatures inside. Only then can I completely resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb,” Zhou Wen said.

When he said that, not only did many members of the Zhang family frown, but Charlie even said disdainfully, “If we could dig up the Fiend Tomb, why would the Zhang family invite you over with their means and abilities?”

Zhang Siyou didn’t directly object to Zhou Wen’s suggestion. All he did was look at him and say, “Why don’t you tell me why you insist on digging up the Fiend Tomb?”

Zhou Wen said calmly, “I have a penetrative skill. I can roughly tell that the Fiend Tomb is split into three levels. The first level has a mask, the second level is a monster, and the third level is the creature that your family has been guarding. If I want to completely resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb, I have to eliminate the mask on the first level and the monster on the second level. If I don’t dig up the Fiend Tomb, I really don’t have the ability to eliminate both.”

“What a joke. The Zhang family has the power of the Heavenly Eye. Even the Zhang family can’t see through the Fiend Tomb, but you can see it clearly. You even know that it’s split into three levels. Could it be that your ability to see through things is even more powerful than the Zhang family’s Heavenly Eye? I’m afraid you heard what we said and know that there’s a mask in the Fiend Tomb. You are using this information to be an alarmist, hoping to benefit from it, right?” Charlie said with a sneer.

“The Celestial Master will be able to determine the veracity of my information.” Zhou Wen didn’t argue with Charlie. He turned to Zhang Siyou and said, “Celestial Master, if you want me to do it, I have to dig open the Fiend Tomb. There’s no other way.”
