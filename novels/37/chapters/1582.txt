Chapter 1583: Snatching Companion Beasts

Translator: CKtalon

“What did you do to me?” Zhou Wen asked as he checked his body.

He could clearly sense that there was something wrong with many of his Companion Beasts. There was a faint force that seemed to lock onto a portion of his Companion Beasts.

It was especially so for the Companion Beasts on his back. This feeling was extremely intense. A similar situation happened at his chest where Godsfall had touched.

Godsfall smiled at Zhou Wen and said, “What I did was to hold your life in my hand. Your life is now in my hands.”

“Ido want to know how I’ll die,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“You mostly rely on your Companion Beasts, right?” As Godsfall spoke, he snapped his fingers. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

With a snap, a hidden tattoo on Zhou Wen’s body automatically surfaced and flew out. Even the Chaos Egg failed to stop the Companion Beast from leaving.

Soon, a Poison Bat-like Companion Beast flew to Godsfall’s side and circled him twice before flying onto his back and turning into a tattoo.

“How can this be?” Carlos and Youkai were alarmed. They had never heard of anyone capable of snatching a person’s Companion Beast.

‘There was a powerful contractual force binding Companion Beasts. Once they hatched, they couldn’t even be transferred. If they were forcefully transferred, one had to pay a huge price or even pay with their lives.

Godsfall had actually snatched a Companion Beast from him. If this ability were to spread, it would probably cause panic in the Federation.

“Is that all?” Zhou Wen remained unmoved.

Zhou Wen had already seen similar powers from Liu Yun. Furthermore, Liu Yun’s technique was better than Godsfall’s.

Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that Godsfall needed to touch his Companion Beast tattoo to steal it. As for Liu Yun’s Star Stealer, it had long reached the stage of stealing pets out of thin air.

Zhou Wen had always wanted to lear Star Stealer, but he had never had it drop. This left him vexed.

“Is that all?” Godsfall’s expression turned cold as he raised his palms and clapped.

With a clap, another Companion Beast tattoo appeared on Zhou Wen’s body. This time, it wasn’t just one, but ten. All of them flew towards Godsfall.

Godsfall originally wanted to strike fear in Zhou Wen. Ordinary people would be horrified to have ten Companion Beasts stripped from him.

However, Godsfall soon realized that the ten Companion Beasts he had appropriated from Zhou Wen were all low-level Companion Beasts like Poison Bats, Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors, Steel Cauldron Sprites, and so on. He didn’t even get a single Mythical stage, much less Tiger Soul General.

“Any more?” Zhou Wen asked Godsfall.

He had many low-level Companion Beasts on him. Ignoring the Musical Note Sprites, he needed a large number of Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors, Steel Cauldron Sprites, and other Companion Beasts for fusion. He would farm them every now and then, so he had a lot of them. Furthermore, these

Companion Beast tattoos were mainly on his chest and back.

Godsfall’s expression changed slightly. He never expected Zhou Wen to have so many low-level Companion Beasts.

Although there were no restrictions on the number of Companion Beast contracts, having too many Companion Beasts was useless in battle. A person’s control was limited. It was not bad for an ordinary person to control two or three Companion Beasts while fighting.

It would be impressive even for some experts who cultivated psyche techniques to simultaneously control more than ten Companion Beasts.

Unless it was an extremely intelligent Companion Beast, summoning a large number of Companion Beasts was similar to having a disorderly mob. They might even become a burden, much less be of help.

Therefore, most people would choose Companion Eggs that were useful to them or excellent Companion Eggs for incubation. Most of the Companion Eggs they didn’t need were sold.

It was especially so for a high-level powerhouse like Zhou Wen. He had no interest in Companion Eggs below the Mythical stage. Even if he picked them up, he would give them to his friends and juniors or exchange them for the materials he needed.

It was very rare to have low-level Companion Beasts like Zhou Wen.

If Zhou Wen didn’t need them for fusion, he wouldn’t have had so many low-level Companion Beasts on him.

“Let’s see how many low-level Companion Beasts you have,” Godsfall said coldly as he clapped his hands again.

Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!

Godsfall could only appropriate ten Companion Beasts for each Connate Appropriation. He could only sense that Connate Appropriation had locked onto Zhou Wen’s body, but he didn’t know how many Companion Beasts there were.

This was because no matter how many Companion Beasts there were, the tattoos would overlap. Furthermore, different Companion Beasts could appear in the same spot. Zhou Wen’s back and chest were densely covered with overlapping tattoos.

Godsfall could only sense the Companion Beast tattoos, but he didn’t know how many Companion Beasts there were or what Companion Beast they were.

His clapping wasn’t done at random, Every time he used Connate Appropriation, he expended a large amount of Essence Energy. Even if Godsfall had tremendous amounts of Essence Energy, this series of clapping made his forehead drip with sweat.

Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts flew out like scattering flowers. More than a hundred Companion Beasts flew towards Godsfall.

Youkai and Carlos were deeply shocked by this scene. To them, Godsfall’s Connate Appropriation was an invincible divine technique.

With such an ability, he was an existence that could do whatever he wanted among humans.

After all, most humans relied on their Companion Beasts to fight. Who wouldn’t be afraid of Godsfall’s ability?

“Twonder if he can snatch a Guardian. If he can do so, it will be too terrifying,” Youkai muttered to himself.

They were alarmed, but Godsfall was so depressed that he nearly blew a gasket.

Godsfall clearly saw the Companion Beasts before they flew over. Many of them were low-level Companion Beasts he had seen previously. Even if he had never seen them before, there were many that looked familiar. Clearly, they were commonly-seen, low-level Companion Beasts.

Godsfall wasn’t sure if there were any higher-level Companion Beasts, but there was definitely no Tiger Soul General.

“Continue.” Zhou Wen stood there without moving, nor did he have any intention of attacking Godsfall. He wanted to know how many Companion Beasts Godsfall’s ability could snatch from him—he wanted to know the limits of this ability.

As for whether his important Companion Beast would be snatched away, Zhou Wen wasn’t too worried.

He had too many Companion Beasts on him. It wasn’t easy for Godsfall to win the luck of the draw—Companion Beasts that Zhou Wen valued. Furthermore, there weren’t many Companion Beasts that Zhou Wen valued.

Prisoned Dragon was in that area, but the Limitless Demon Dragon King wasn’t. It was located slightly lower.

Tiger Soul General was also situated in that region, but Zhou Wen wasn’t worried about it at all. If Godsfall really snatched Tiger Soul General, Liu Yun’s experience back then would be what was awaiting him..
