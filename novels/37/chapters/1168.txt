Chapter 1169: Nameless Dugu

Seeing Tsukuyomi walk over, Zhou Wen led Chick and the antelope towards Shinra Temple.

When the black-robed man saw that Zhou Wen and company were about to enter the Shinra Temple, he hurriedly said, “Shinra Temple’s taboo powers are extremely strong. If someone who has killed enters, they will definitely be injured by the taboo power. If they have killed plenty, they will probably be killed on the spot.”

In this era, other than special people like Unkilling Dugu, who hadn’t killed before? Even vegetarians had to hunt dimensional creatures.

Tsukuyomi acted as if she hadn’t heard him and walked straight into Shinra Temple.

Zhou Wen had already engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It was very difficult for the taboo power to have any effect on him. If needed, Zhou Wen could still use the power of the Heaven-Opening Scripture to protect Ya’er and Chick.

Ever since he had the scripture, the power of the Heaven-Opening Scripture could not only protect him, but it could also be used on others.

The antelope and Chick rushed in, looking even more anxious than Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was puzzled. He didn’t know why the two of them were in such a rush to enter, so he hurriedly followed.

After entering Shinra Temple, he saw Tsukuyomi, the antelope, and Chick inside. They weren’t injured by the taboo power.

Even Ya’er, who Zhou Wen was carrying, wasn’t injured by the taboo power. If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder converting the taboo power into Essence Energy, Zhou Wen would have wondered if the taboo power mentioned by the black-robed man existed.

The black-robed man stood outside Shinra Temple, but he didn’t dare enter. He looked inside and realized that Zhou Wen and company hadn’t been injured by the taboo power. He couldn’t help but be surprised.

What’s going on with these fellows? Could it be that they have a special Life Providence like Unkilling Dugu?

The black-robed man looked at Zhou Wen and company in surprise.

It was naturally impossible for Zhou Wen and company to have the God of Unkilling Life Providence. Apart from the antelope, who he had no idea if it had killed before, everyone else had definitely killed something.

Furthermore, an existence like Tsukuyomi was an existence that had triggered a calamity. The number of lives she had killed was probably uncountable. The number of sins she had committed far exceeded that of ordinary creatures.

However, Tsukuyomi was a Calamity-grade big shot. Since she had dared to enter Shinra Temple, she naturally had a way to deal with it. That wasn’t something Zhou Wen could understand.

Zhou Wen could roughly guess that Chick wasn’t affected by Shinra Temple’s taboo power.

It had the bloodline of a phoenix, and the phoenix itself was a nirvana creature. It wasn’t tainted by powers like karmic sinflames, so it was reasonable that the taboo powers of Shinra Temple were useless against it.

As for how the antelope did it, Zhou Wen had no idea, but he didn’t find it strange.

The only thing that surprised Zhou Wen was that Ya’er wasn’t affected. It looked like the taboo power hadn’t descended on her at all. It was unknown how she had done it.

Ya’er had killed any humans before, so she shouldn’t be unaffected.

Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it as he began sizing up Shinra Temple. He saw a seven-meter-tall stone furnace in the middle of the squarish stone temple which had an ancient design. There were patterns like the sun, moon, and stars engraved on it, but they were simple dots and lines. It looked very crude.

Chains extended out from the stone furnace, trapping a strange creature on the walls.

At that moment, Unkilling Dugu stood in front of the stone furnace and pressed his hand on the creature’s body.

The creature had a human body, but it had a bull’s head. Furthermore, it was far taller than the average person. It was probably nearly three meters tall.

Zhou Wen took a look and a Mythical figure immediately appeared in his mind. He thought to himself, Don’t tell me this is Ox-Head of the Ox Head and Horse Face—guardians of the underworld?

Unkilling Dugu pressed his hands on Ox-Head’s chest. It was strange. There was a strange force flowing towards Unkilling Dugu from Ox-Head.

The power suffused a demonic golden light. After it entered Unkilling Dugu’s body, it made his body glow golden. Not only was his body changing, but it even began to condense golden armor that gradually enveloped his body.

Is that the power of a Guardian? That’s not right. It’s not a Guardian. It seems to have the aura of a human... Could it be... Zhou Wen looked at Ox-Head who was tied to the stone furnace and revealed a puzzled look.

To simultaneously have the power of a Guardian and the aura of a human, the only possibility Zhou Wen could think of was Wang Mingyuan and Zhong Ziya’s situation.

“The creature tied to the stone furnace is from your Dugu family?” Zhou Wen turned to ask the black-robed man outside the hall.

The man in black shook his head. “I don’t know. I’ve never seen him with my own eyes. However, I think it should be him.”

Clearly, the black-robed man wasn’t too sure either. Perhaps he really wasn’t lying.

At this moment, Unkilling Dugu, who was covered in golden armor, spoke. “That’s right. He’s from our Dugu family. Furthermore, everyone knows his name.”

“Don’t tell me he’s that hero from the Dugu family?” Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he blurted out.

Among the six heroes of the Federation, the only one who was still alive was the old hero of the Dugu family.

However, what was the difference between living and dying if this was the way he lived?

“No, our patriarch is still presiding over the grand ceremony at Boundless Mountain,” said the black-robed man.

However, Unkilling Dugu sneered and said, “You are half right. He’s our hero, but only half.”

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“The so-called six heroes should be seven because our Dugu family has two heroes. Furthermore, they are twins. However, these twins are somewhat special. They basically don’t appear in front of outsiders at the same time. Therefore, outsiders only know that my Dugu family’s Nameless Dugu is a hero, but they don’t know that it’s untrue that Nameless doesn’t have a name. It’s just that they are two different people. They have their own names and no one can replace the other. That’s why they used this name,” said Unkilling Dugu.

The black-robed man’s eyes were filled with shock. Clearly, he hadn’t known of such a thing in the past.

“Since he’s the hero of the Dugu family, why is he trapped here?” Zhou Wen asked.

“It’s because he chose a different path and submitted to the Holy Temple. He obtained the power the Holy Temple gave him and even wanted to take the entire Dugu family with him. That’s why he was imprisoned here by the other Nameless Dugu.” As Unkilling Dugu spoke, the golden light on the ox-headed man’s body weakened.

His extremely strong body began to shrink and quickly, it turned into a dried corpse.

As for the golden light over Unkilling Dugu’s body, it intensified. A golden helmet appeared over his face. The helmet enveloped his entire head—in the shape of an ox head.
