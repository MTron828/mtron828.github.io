Chapter 1570: Egg Sovereign

Translator: CKtalon

While everyone was still reeling in shock from Starlord Titan Gate’s powerful aura and size, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had already rushed over.

Starlord Titan Gate opened his mouth, but before he could release the sound wave, the spear emitted a terrifying flaming bullet.

Rumble!

The meteor-like purple flaming bullets spewed into Starlord Titan Gate’s mouth. In a few seconds, his head exploded.

The huge body collapsed like a mountain, shaking the entire Star Palace for a while.

“Different Companion Beasts target… Yes…” Before Professor Gu could finish his sentence, he couldn’t close his mouth.

The entire Federation fell silent for a few seconds before the Internet broke out into a frenzy. The screen was flooded with all sorts of messages, blocking the live broadcast’s footage.

“He’s practically invincible!”

“Too f*cking strong!”

“Your Excellency Egg Sovereign, please accept my bow.”

“I’m willing to use my ten years of lifespan to exchange for that Companion Beast.”

“Egg Sovereign is awesome, Brother Tiger is awesome!”

Many people on the Internet liked to give all sorts of nicknames. Soon, Unlucky Egg from before was replaced by Egg Sovereign. They didn’t know the name of the Tiger Soul General, but from the aura that resembled a ferocious tiger out in the wild and how the mount that the creature sat on looked like a tiger, they gave him the nickname “Brother Tiger.”

There were many other nicknames, but these two were most acceptable by the masses. They quickly spread.

“Egg Sovereign, continue clearing the levels. Clear all the Big Dipper dimensional zones.”

“Brother Tiger is so impressive. What dimensional creature can’t he kill? Finish it.”

Xia Liuchuan and Zhang Chunqiu exchanged looks and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.

“Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast is ridiculously strong,” Xia Liuchuan said.

“It’s indeed a little ridiculous.” Zhang Chunqiu suddenly thought of something. He picked up his phone and called Zhang Yuzhi. “Yuzhi, don’t you want to go out for a walk…”

Xia Liuchuan glanced at Zhang Chunqiu in contempt as he thought smugly to himself, You, Zhang Chunqiu, claim to be good at divination. So that’s all you amount to. Looks like I’m the wise one. I’ve long sent Little Yue to Guide City.

Jiuyang was also shocked by the strength of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Although he didn’t know what level Starlord Titan Gate was, being behind Starlord Ravenous Wolf meant that it was impossible for him to be weaker than Starlord Ravenous Wolf. Yet, he was instantly killed. It wasn’t because Starlord Titan Gate was weak, but because the Tiger Soul General was too powerful.

Jiuyang didn’t look at the Tiger Soul General again. Instead, he looked at the Chaos Egg and muttered to himself, “Interesting. I really want to know what level that person is at to possess such a powerful Companion Beast.”

Zhou Wen didn’t care. He got the Tiger Soul General to continue blasting apart Starlord Titan Gate’s body as a few crystals dropped. One of them was crystalline like jade. There was Starlord Titan Gate’s shadow inside—a skill crystal.

Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he got the Tiger Soul General to pick up all the crystals before rushing into the teleportation nexus.

Many people were looking forward to the egg emperor and Brother Tiger clearing the seven levels and completing the Big Dipper dimensional zone.

However, they were disappointed. Zhou Wen teleported out of the dimensional zone with the Tiger Soul General.

He wasn’t stupid. The third Star Palace’s Starlord wasn’t someone who could be resolved with brute force. Although the Tiger Soul General was strong, it was useless against that Starlord.

The stronger the destructive power of the Tiger Soul General, the faster he would die.

After Zhou Wen teleported out, the Cube’s screen switched to a ranking. A new name was placed first.

“Tiger Soul General! That must be the name of that Companion Beast, right?” When people saw the name, they were first taken aback before they reacted.

“Tiger Soul General is so strong. Why didn’t he let him continue clearing the levels?”

“Egg Sovereign is way too cowardly, isn’t it?”

“It’s really a waste to have such a powerful Companion Beast follow him.”

Many people were displeased with Zhou Wen quitting at this moment. From their point of view, even if the Tiger Soul General couldn’t clear the seven levels, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to clear two or three more. It was a little cowardly to quit now.

There was something else that surprised everyone. Although Jiuyang didn’t perform as well as Zhou Wen, he was already very strong. However, his name had vanished from the rankings.

Originally, even if the Tiger Soul General entered the rankings, Jiuyang would at most drop one spot. Now, his name had completely vanished. People guessed that it had something to do with the previous PVP mode.

Jiuyang himself had already seen the notification on the Cube. As he had lost in the PVP mode, he would not be able to enter the dimensional zone through the Cube for a month. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Jiuyang, why didn’t you use that item?” Holy God walked over from afar and arrived behind Jiuyang.

“Greetings, Lord Holy God.” Jiuyang genuflected and bowed at Holy God.

“Answer me,” Holy God said again.

“It was my oversight. I originally thought that I didn’t need to use that item. I never expected such an accident to happen.” Jiuyang looked up and asked, “Lord Holy God, do you know who that Egg Sovereign is?”

“So what if I know?” Holy God said indifferently.

“Lord Holy God, please inform him that I wish to meet him in person,” said Jiuyang.

“Sure, but I have a request. Bring him back to the Holy Land. If you can’t do it, there’s no need to know,” said Holy God.

“Why do you need him to be brought back?” Jiuyang asked.

“Because he’s an enemy of the Holy Land,” said Holy God.

“He’s Zhou Wen?” Jiuyang suddenly thought of something and blurted out.

“You aren’t too stupid. According to the information we gathered previously, that egg-shaped ability is an ability that Zhou Wen once used. We haven’t discovered anyone with a similar ability, so we are certain that it’s him,” Holy God said. “Bring him back to the Holy Land. It’s best if you can capture him alive. If you can’t, bring back his corpse.”

“Yes, Lord Holy God.” After a moment of silence, Jiuyang stood up and bowed before turning to leave.

“Godsfall.” Holy God softly called out a name after seeing Jiuyang disappear from his vision.

“Lord Holy God, what are your orders?” A young man in gorgeous armor who looked like a prince walked in front of Holy God and knelt down.

“Follow Jiuyang secretly. If Jiuyang doesn’t complete the mission, you will take over,” said Holy God.

“Yes, Your Excellency. I definitely won’t disappoint you.” The corners of Godsfall’s mouth curled up slightly as he revealed a strange smile. His handsome face made one shudder.

“You have another mission. Bring Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast back, especially that Tiger Soul General. You have to bring it back,” Holy God emphasized twice.

Godsfall answered with a smile, “Lord Holy God, don’t worry. This is what I’m best at. It won’t just be the Tiger Soul General.. I’ll bring back all of Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts.”
