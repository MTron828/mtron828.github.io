Chapter 757: Scram

Translator: CKtalon

Due to the restraint of the Primordial Spore, the ‘Emperor’ character was unable to stop Xia Jiuhuang’s body from counter attacking. The demonic sword stabbed into Xia Jiuhuang’s head inch by inch. At the same time, a black demonic aura invaded Xia Jiuhuang’s body, weakening his vitality.

The ‘Emperor’ word was a Wheel of Destiny condensed by Xia Jiuhuang. Its foundation was Xia Jiuhuang. As Xia Jiuhuang’s vitality weakened, the light on the ‘Emperor’ word dimmed, no longer having the same aura as before.

“How dare you...” Just as Zhou Wen was feeling delighted, he suddenly heard a cold woman’s voice coming from above the Hall of Supreme Harmony. The source of the voice was none other than the log erected there.

There’s a woman inside the log? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

As the woman’s voice sounded from the log, the stars in the sky shimmered. Starlight cascaded down, passing through the dark clouds and illuminating Forbidden City.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that the lit stars were clearly the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. Apart from the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, no other starlight penetrated the dark clouds.

The starlight shone down, causing Forbidden City to emit resplendent starlight. The four Corner Towers in particular emitted a divine glow.

Be it the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions in the sky or the four Corner Towers, they were all centered around the log. Starlight gathered on the log, causing the log to emit purple starlight as though there were countless stars swirling inside.

Under the illumination of the starlight emitted by the purple log, Zhou Wen felt a pain in his forehead. Immediately, he felt that something was amiss. He took out a mirror and saw purple light and lines appear on his forehead. From the parts that had condensed, it looked like he was about to condense the word “slave” again.

The layout of Forbidden City is the Purple Forbidden Enclosure. The Purple Star is also known as the Emperor Star. It’s the Life Star of an emperor. Now that the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions have appeared and the four Corner Towers have submitted, could it be that Emperor Polestar is in the log? Zhou Wen guessed.

If it was really the legendary Emperor Polestar, Zhou Wen felt that he was doomed today. Unlike ordinary Mythical creatures, Emperor Polestar was an existence that controlled all immortals. He was an immortal’s emperor and not something ordinary Mythical creatures could compare with.

The slave word on his forehead became more and more obvious. Zhou Wen switched several Life Souls, but he was unable to stop the formation of the slave word.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen felt a force surge out of his body. It was the power of the Sigh of the King. However, this time, it wasn’t under Zhou Wen’s control, but an autonomous act of the Sigh of the King. It was somewhat similar to the time he knelt.

In an instant, the incomplete ‘slave’ word on Zhou Wen’s forehead shattered and dissipated. The power of the Sigh of the King enveloped his body as though he had been placed in a warm embrace.

“Scram!” Zhou Wen felt a voice coming from him.

The voice was indiscernible, but it seemed to possess a supreme might. The dark clouds that enveloped Forbidden City instantly dissipated, revealing the clear sky and sun. There was no longer any cloud.

The starlight of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions instantly dimmed and vanished without a trace. The starlight of Forbidden City also dissipated as the four Corner Towers collapsed. The log fell from the Hall of Supreme Harmony and slammed into the ground.

The log trembled incessantly as though it was about to collapse. It left Zhou Wen alarmed. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Crack!

Xia Jiuhuang’s body finally couldn’t withstand the power of the demonic sword and was split into two. Demonic aura surged through his corpse as though it wanted to destroy his body.

The mysterious phone suddenly vibrated. Zhou Wen took out his phone and saw that the game screen of the Dead Man Tree had automatically switched on. When he snapped a picture of Xia Jiuhuang’s corpse, it was sucked in without leaving a drop of blood behind.

Without having the time to take a careful look at the Dead Man Tree, Zhou Wen unsummoned his Companion Beasts and put on the Invisibility Cloak before running.

The log that had collapsed in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony trembled more and more violently, like a volcano that was about to erupt. As for Zhou Wen, the Sigh of the King’s power had already receded, making him feel uneasy. He wanted to escape from Forbidden City.

Perhaps due to the absence of the dark clouds and starlight, Zhou Wen successfully rushed out of Forbidden City. However, just as he rushed out, he saw a purple beam shoot into the sky.

Then, all of Forbidden City emitted a terrifying purple glow, like an immortal city condensed from starlight.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare look any further. He turned around and ran, hoping to get as far away from Forbidden City as possible.

After running for a short distance, he saw Wang Lu looking at Forbidden City with the chick and antelope not far away. The anomaly in Forbidden City worried Wang Lu. She closed her eyes and pressed her palms together in front of her chest as she muttered something.

“Goddess of Luck, please help Zhou Wen and let him return safely.”

Zhou Wen was greatly touched when he heard that. He thought to himself, Wang Lu is really kind-hearted.

The antelope’s eyes stared at Zhou Wen. Clearly, the Invisibility Cloak’s ability wasn’t effective against it.

The chick was also staring in Zhou Wen’s direction, but its eyes were somewhat puzzled. It seemed to have discovered Zhou Wen, but it didn’t see him.

“Wang Lu, let’s go.” Zhou Wen appeared and ran out with Wang Lu.

Now that there was an anomaly in Forbidden City, no one knew what would happen. The further away they were, the better.

Wang Lu jumped in fright. Seeing that Zhou Wen was covered in injuries and many of his wounds were still bleeding, his clothes still drenched in blood, she couldn’t help but worry. “Are you alright?”

“It’s fine. I won’t die yet. Let’s leave Forbidden City first. It’s too dangerous here.” Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and jumped up with Wang Lu before running away.

When he was far from Forbidden City, Zhou Wen made the Great Might Vajra Bull stop.

Only then did he feel the excruciating pain in his body. He had been in a highly-strung state and hadn’t paid any attention to his injuries. Now, he felt pain all over his body as though he was about to die. Every move he made hurt so much that he wanted to cry for mommy.

“Your injuries are serious. I’ll take you back to treat them now.” Wang Lu summoned a vine that crept onto Zhou Wen’s body and wrapped around him. At the same time, the bud burrowed into his wounds and emitted a faint glow to treat his injuries.

Then, she summoned a mount and brought Zhou Wen back like he was a vined mummy.

Zhou Wen’s injuries were too serious. He didn’t know when he would recover, so he allowed Wang Lu to take him back.

Now, Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. He didn’t know how Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue were doing, but he was injured. He didn’t have the strength to save them.

With Xia Jiuhang dead, there shouldn’t be anyone in the Xia family who wants their lives, right? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that they wouldn’t be in any danger. He would get Wang Lu to help him gather information later.

The anomaly in Forbidden City made the Xia family and the Special Inspector Bureau very concerned. They had set up a large number of people to monitor the situation inside, but no one could enter. They had no idea what was happening. All they could see was that Forbidden City was enveloped by clouds like an immortal city, making it even more unfathomable.
