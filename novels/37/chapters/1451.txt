Chapter 1452: Battle of the Strongest

Translator: CKtalon

“You will naturally know when you see him. Dead or alive, you have to bring him back. After the matter is done, I’ll give you the right to temporarily hold the Trajectory Holy Temple’s Holy Artifact in the name of Holy God,” Holy God said.

“Can I really wield the Holy Artifact?” Xiao was pleasantly surprised. Each of the six Holy Temples had a Holy Artifact. Xiao was from the Trajectory Holy Temple. If he could be in possession of one, his strength would significantly increase. It wouldn’t be difficult to destroy Luoyang.

“The Holy Artifact can’t leave the Holy Temple for long, nor can it stay on Earth for long. You can be in possession of it for a day,” Holy God said.

“It’s enough,” Xiao said through gritted teeth.

“Go,” Holy God said calmly.

Xiao jumped into Lake Frustration again. He still felt his body sink as though many invisible wraith hands were pulling at his body.

However, compared to the first time he entered Lake Frustration, the strength was much weaker. Xiao swam forward with all his might in a desperate attempt to prevent himself from sinking into the bottomless abyss.

The secular world was filled with frustrations.

Strength came from a lack of desire. No desire led to zero frustrations.

However, humans were humans after all. If they didn’t have any desires, what was the difference between living and being a walking corpse?

It was impossible for everyone to not have frustrations. If they had frustrations, it was impossible for them to swim across Lake Frustration alive, much less reach Paramita.

Paramita did not appear far away, but no matter how hard Xiao swam, it remained right in front of him—unreachable.

His body seemed to be entangled by threads in the lake, making it harder and harder for him to move. He slowly sank to the bottom of the lake. It was the ultimate resting place of all mortals.

Xiao felt his consciousness gradually blur. He had long known that even if he had advanced to the Mythical stage in Lake Frustration, reaching Paramita was still a perilous endeavor.

I can’t die yet!?Xiao bit the tip of his tongue hard, hoping to use the pain to sober up.

It was useless. He felt numb despite tearing the tip of his tongue. Blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth, but he didn’t realize it.

It’s still not enough to cross the lake??Holy God watched from afar as Xiao gradually sank to the bottom of the lake. He couldn’t help but frown.

No matter how many powerful creatures there were, it was difficult for them to swim across Lake Frustration. Even dimensional powerhouses were no exception. However, that weak human had managed to swim across Lake Frustration in what was a situation of certain death. Holy God had seen it with his own eyes.

Therefore, Holy God had always attempted to use humans to reach Paramita. Xiao wasn’t the first person to attempt it, nor would he be the last.

What a pity. This person’s talent and will are the best among the Saints.?Even Holy God couldn’t rescue Xiao at that depth. Therefore, Holy God felt a little regretful, but it was only a fleeting thought.

After all, he was only a human. He could slowly nurture one in the future. If one died, more Saints would take his place. He had plenty of time.

Just as Xiao was about to sink to the bottom of the lake and Holy God was about to turn around to leave, he suddenly saw Xiao struggling with all his might in the lake.

As he struggled, the invisible threads of frustration that bound his body gradually receded. Just as he was about to sink to the bottom, Xiao gradually floated up.

His consciousness is actually so pure? Could hatred really make a person so pure??Holy God looked at Xiao who was swimming towards Paramita again and was somewhat surprised.

However, he really couldn’t think of any power that could make Xiao’s mind so pure other than that.

Xiao slowly recovered memories buried deep within.

On the grassland in the suburbs, two children were fighting.

“I’m the strongest.”

“No, I’m the strongest.”

As the two children were fighting, a tall and thin middle-aged man passed by and watched with interest.

After watching for a while, the middle-aged man lost interest. His figure suddenly flashed as he picked up the two children who were fighting each other by the collar.

“Who are you? What are you trying to do? Let go of me!” The two children kicked and struggled with all their might, but the lanky middle-aged man’s arms were especially long, and their short legs couldn’t reach him.

“Don’t you want to determine who’s stronger? That won’t give you an answer. Let me tell you of a way to determine who’s stronger.” As the middle-aged man spoke, his figure flashed and quickly moved towards the distant forest.

On the tip of a mountain that resembled a sword’s edge, someone had placed a plank. It was like a see-saw, other than the fulcrum being the mountain peak.

On both sides of the plank stood a child. Their weight affected the log’s balance, causing it to undulate as though it would fall into a bottomless abyss at any moment.

The middle-aged man stood on an ancient tree’s branch that protruded from a cliff and said to the two children, “If you want a duel, you have to do it in such a place. As long as you strike your opponent down, the other one will naturally be the strongest without any dispute.”

Ordinary youths would probably have peed their pants in fear. They might even fall down due to their fright.

However, although the two children were young and uneasy, they didn’t show the fear of ordinary children. They slowly moved their bodies and tried their best to maintain the plank’s balance so that it wouldn’t fall due to the tilt. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

To be able to act so calmly at their age piqued the middle-aged man’s interest.

“It’s actually very simple to kill the opponent. All you need to do is run to the middle faster than the other party. Once the plank is in nonequilibrium, the other party will naturally fall. I’ll send the surviving one back,” the middle-aged man said.

The two children exchanged looks and charged towards the center almost at the same time.

“Interesting.” The middle-aged man found it more and more interesting.

The two children reached the center at almost the same time, but the mountain peak was just too sharp. The bottom was filled with slippery cliffs, making it inconducive for standing.

One of the children didn’t hesitate to reach out to push the other child down.

However, to his surprise, the other child didn’t push forward like him. Instead, he turned his body slightly and jumped up.

The child, who had reached out for the push, never expected such a move. He exerted too much strength and found himself falling forward. Without any counterweight to balance the other side, the plank immediately slid down.

The child plummeted with the plank.
