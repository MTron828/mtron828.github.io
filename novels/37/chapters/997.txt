Chapter 998: Can’t Tell the Truth

Translator: CKtalon

After circling Frost City, Zhou Wen felt that his Glimmer Life Soul was already showing signs of a breakthrough, just falling short of it. For some reason, he couldn’t really break through to the Perfect Body. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Could it be that I can’t advance the Glimmer Life Soul by just going to new places? Zhou Wen thought of all sorts of possibilities, but he couldn’t figure out the problem.

In Frost City, he had only downloaded a copy of Maze of Lies. There were many famous dimensional zones in the North District, but it required them to leave Frost City. Zhou Wen and company didn’t plan on going for the time being.

After returning to his residence, Zhou Wen realized that Lance, Sadie, and Gulli were waiting for them.

Lance didn’t look injured, but he was in a wheelchair. His leg must have been injured badly. A beautiful girl was standing behind the wheelchair. It looked like she had pushed Lance over.

“I’ve been waiting for you. Unfortunately, I’m temporarily unable to fight you,” Lance said helplessly.

“Is your leg alright? Do you need help?” Zhou Wen’s Primordial Human Sovereign was very effective in treating external injuries.

Lance shook his head and said, “I’ll be fine after a few days of rest. There’s no problem. As for you, you have to be careful when fighting Joseph. His abilities... No... I should say that his Guardian abilities are somewhat strange...”

“Strange in what way?” Zhou Wen wasn’t a fanatic who pursued combat excitement, so every bit he learned about Joseph’s Guardian was for the better.

“I attacked his body with all my might, but in the end, all his injuries were transferred to me.” Lance explained the situation.

“Damage reflection?” Zhou Wen asked.

“No, if it was damage reflection, I would have known back then. His ability made the injuries on him appear on me after I was done with the assault. It was as though those injuries were alive and could run on their own,” said Lance.

“That’s quite a special ability.” Zhou Wen pondered as he thought about how to deal with such an ability.

“But if it’s you, it shouldn’t be a problem. I’m looking forward to your performance tomorrow.” Lance smiled.

“If I destroy his Guardian, will your family really be fine?” Zhou Wen found it odd and couldn’t help but ask.

“No problem,” Lance answered with certainty.

“From the looks of it, Joseph is really hated by everyone. At the very least, he has a Guardian. How can the family not value him?” Li Xuan said.

“The family also wants to value him, but unfortunately, he doesn’t share the same views as the family. He has secretly done many things that have harmed the family’s interests. He believes he did them flawlessly, but in fact, the elders in the family are already well aware of them. They are just discussing how to deal with him,” Sadie said.

“I see.” Only then did Zhou Wen understand why Sadie and Lance had answered so readily.

It turned out that their family had originally planned on dealing with Joseph, but they were somewhat afraid of his Guardian. Furthermore, Joseph was ultimately a member of the Ultimate Family Clan, so it wasn’t appropriate for them to make things too nasty, making the other families in the North District laugh at them.

Zhou Wen suddenly wanted to fight Joseph. If he could really kill Joseph’s Guardian, it would help the Ultimate Family Clan resolve a problem. They were naturally more than happy to see it happen.

“From the looks of it, one doesn’t necessarily enjoy special treatment just because they have powerful strength. It’s no wonder Joseph didn’t plan on letting Li Benyi’s Mythical Companion Egg off,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh.

“Uncle Li and Aunt raised Joseph for nearly ten years and treated him like their own son. They invested all sorts of resources into him, but what he did bitterly disappointed us, let alone Uncle Li and Aunt,” Sadie said.

Everyone chatted for a while before Lance and company returned. They agreed to celebrate after Zhou Wen’s victory tomorrow.

...

Zhou Wen lay in bed and took out his phone to open the Maze of Lies dungeon he had downloaded today.

After entering the game, the blood-colored avatar appeared in front of an ancient castle. The castle looked very strange, like an ancient amusement park. The various buildings were very strange.

Furthermore, the castle door looked like a clown’s face. The door was the clown’s laughing mouth. Entering the castle was like being devoured by a clown.

“Are you a man or a woman?” A line of words suddenly appeared on the door. A pop-up appeared in-game. There were two options—male and female.

Zhou Wen naturally chose male, but following that, the blood-colored avatar exploded on the spot as the screen went black.

Holy sh*t, so this is also the taboo power of the Maze of Lies? Zhou Wen immediately understood that he couldn’t make such choices in the Maze of Lies.

Zhou Wen wanted to know the various strange things in the maze, so he didn’t use the Heaven-Opening Scripture. He dripped his blood and revived before arriving at the door of the Maze of Lies.

“Are you a good person or a bad person?” However, this time, the question on the door changed. It was different from what he had seen previously.

Zhou Wen immediately felt stumped. He felt that he wasn’t considered a good person, but he didn’t seem to have done anything too bad. He probably wasn’t considered a bad person.

However, there were only two options on the phone—good and bad. Zhou Wen had to choose one of them.

I should be barely considered a good guy, right? Then, according to the Maze of Lies, I should choose ‘bad person,’ right? Zhou Wen chose ‘bad person’ as his answer.

Bam!

The blood-colored avatar exploded on the spot again. The armor and Essence Energy on his body were useless.

How is that possible? Am I a bad person? Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that the taboo power of the Maze of Lies had determined that he was a bad person.

Zhou Wen dripped his blood gloomily to revive again, allowing the blood-colored avatar to come to the entrance of the Maze of Lies.

What was even more depressing was that the question on the Maze of Lies’s door changed again.

“Is your girlfriend your left hand or right hand?”

“...”

F*ck you. I’m not playing anymore. Zhou Wen activated the Heaven-Opening Scripture and pushed open the door to enter the Maze of Lies.

With the protection of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, the taboo power didn’t work on the blood-colored avatar as it successfully entered the maze.

The first thing he saw when he entered the castle-like maze was a huge merry-go-round.

The diameter of the merry-go-round was at least 30 meters. At this moment, the carousel was spinning, and the horses were moving up and down.

On one of the wooden horses, Zhou Wen saw a puppet clown in a clown costume. He was sitting on the wooden horse with three different-colored balls in his hand. He tossed them around as though he was performing on stage.

Is this the Mischief Clown? Zhou Wen had already heard from Li Benyi that Mischief Clown was an Epic dimensional creature with very unique abilities.

It wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to kill Mischief Clown, but he wanted to see what kind of abilities the Mischief Clown had. If the skill was really good, he could consider using it for fusion in the future.

When the clown who was tossing the ball saw the blood-colored avatar, he threw the red, yellow, and blue balls at it.
