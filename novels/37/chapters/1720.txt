Chapter 1721 Rainbow Phoenix

This is a phoenix? Why doesn’t it look as orthodox as Chick? Zhou Wen saw that the phoenix was colorful and beautiful, but due to its beauty, it lacked its domineeringness.

Zhou Wen’s impression of a phoenix was a bird covered in golden flames-domineering and noble.

Although such a gorgeous creature looked like a phoenix, it still left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.

Having been bullied for so long, the pheasant was already enraged. At that moment, it transformed into a rainbow phoenix and spat out rainbow-like flames.

Zhou Wen condensed the power of Great Brahma and punched the rainbow flames.

Great Brahma’s power seldom encountered a nemesis. Its destructive power was extremely powerful, but when it encountered the rainbow flames, it lost the destructive power it should have—it was forcefully disintegrated by the rainbow flames.

What kind of flame is this? It can actually restrain Great Brahma’s power! Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly instant transmitted to dodge the burning of the rainbow flames.

“Junior Brother.” Zhou Wen was fighting the rainbow phoenix when he suddenly heard Liu Yun’s voice.

“Didn’t you flee? Why are you back?” Zhou Wen heard the voice, but he didn’t see Liu Yun. He didn’t know where he had hidden, nor did he have the time to find his location.

“What do you mean ‘flee?’ I went to get the cavalry for you,” said Liu Yun.

“Where’s your cavalry?” Zhou Wen asked as he fought. “I haven’t found one, so be careful. I think the bird you’re fighting is most likely a phoenix.” Liu Yun paused before continuing, “Don’t think that phoenixes only spew fire. In ancient myths and legends, phoenixes are actually an extremely terrifying existence. This phoenix is probably the kind of phoenix in ancient myths. It has terrifying might.”

Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to speak to him. Great Brahma’s powers were restrained, and his speed was inferior to the phoenix’s. All he could do was rely on his techniques to fight the rainbow phoenix, but he was already at a disadvantage.

“Have you heard of the legend of phoenixes giving birth to Rocs and Peacocks?” Liu Yun continued transmitting his voice.

“Cut the crap. Tell me something useful.” Zhou Wen really wasn’t in the mood to listen to his stories. Great Brahma’s powers were restrained, making his combat a challenge.

“From what I see, your strength seems to be somewhat similar to the Buddhist pantheon. Back then, the Peacock Bright King was able to devour Buddha, so it’s obvious that the Peacock’s strength has a restraining effect on the Buddhist pantheon. As for the phoenix, it’s the peacock’s ancestor. Its strength will restrain you. You can try fighting it with a different type of power. Perhaps it will be better,” said Liu Yun.

Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He naturally knew that any other type of power might not be restrained, but he had to have one to change.

Only Great Brahma was at the Heaven level. The powers below the Heaven level couldn’t touch the phoenix. Truth Listener hadn’t completed its mutation, so it couldn’t be summoned.

“Can’t you say something useful?” Zhou Wen couldn’t dodge in time and the rainbow flames were about to burn him.

His vision blurred as he realized that he had been moved far away, dodging the rainbow phoenix’s attack.

Only then did Zhou Wen recall that the grass fruit baby was still lying on his shoulder. It had escaped with Zhou Wen, allowing him to dodge the rainbow flames.

“Alright, I’ll forgive you for being uneducated. Have you heard of a mythical peacock that knows the Five-colored Divine Light? I reckon this phoenix’s rainbow flames are even more terrifying than the Five-colored Divine Light. It’s best if you don’t touch it,” said Liu Yun.

Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be tainted by the rainbow flames. If it could even disintegrate the power of Great Brahma, death was almost a certainty if he touched it.

Thankfully, the grass fruit baby provided sufficient help. As long as Zhou Wen encountered danger, this fellow would use an escape technique to escape with him. It was very obedient. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

I don’t care anymore. If it benefits, so be it. Zhou Wen knew that this couldn’t continue.

The rainbow phoenix was much faster than him while Great Brahma was restrained by the rainbow flames; he had to think of other solutions.

He simultaneously circulated Great Brahma and the Chaos Egg. Just as the Chaos Egg protected Zhou Wen’s body, the rainbow flames enveloped the Chaos Egg.

Thankfully, the Chaos Egg wasn’t burned through as Zhou Wen expected. However, Essence Energy Crystals were produced crazily, almost bursting the egg instantaneously. Zhou Wen got Imperial Lord Behemoth to absorb Essence Energy Crystals, but it was only a drop in the ocean. Thankfully, the grass fruit baby didn’t disappoint him. It opened its mouth and instantly absorbed most of the Essence Energy Crystals.

The red light in its body became brighter and brighter, like a crystal chandelier.

Although what Liu Yun said is a little far-fetched, it’s not completely impossible. If a phoenix can give birth to a peacock and a roc, then there’s no reason why a phoenix can’t have the abilities of a peacock and a roc. The Golden-Winged Roc’s speed is unparalleled, and the mythical peacock does have Five-colored Divine Light. This phoenix has the speed of a roc and the peacock’s Five-colored Divine Light. Furthermore, it’s an upgraded version. It probably won’t be easy to kill. If Truth Listener is around, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to find an opportunity by joining forces with it... Zhou Wen wasn’t worried about the Chaos Egg exploding for the time being. He carefully observed the rainbow phoenix, hoping to find its weakness.

The Teacher Domain analyzed the rainbow phoenix’s trajectory again and again, but the analysis was very slow. It was unknown how long it would take to completely analyze it.

After the grass fruit baby absorbed the crystals for a period of time, the red light in its body gradually dimmed, turning into a red heart that appeared in its chest. The grass fruit baby’s body gradually returned to its original appearance after the heart completely solidified. It was no longer as transparent as before.

When the baby completely recovered, it stopped absorbing Essence Energy Crystals.

Zhou Wen was immediately given a fright. The Chaos Egg had lasted all this time thanks to the grass fruit baby’s absorption of the Essence Energy Crystal. Otherwise, the Chaos Egg probably wouldn’t have lasted two seconds under the rainbow flames.

Indeed, in the blink of an eye, the Chaos Egg was pushed to its limits. Imperial Lord Behemoth couldn’t absorb much, so just as it was about to explode

Bang!

The Chaos Egg failed to hold on and exploded. Zhou Wen’s body was immediately exposed. Thankfully, he used spatial instant transmission to leave his previous spot without touching the rainbow flames.

“Little brat, don’t just eat and do nothing. Haven’t you already completed your evolution? Quickly beat up that crappy bird.” Zhou Wen was still counting on the grass fruit baby to fight the phoenix, so he could take the opportunity to escape.

However, the grass fruit baby lay on Zhou Wen’s back without any intention of fighting. It was unknown if it had a good temper, had no intention of taking revenge, or if it knew that its strength was inferior to the rainbow phoenix, making it afraid of fighting it.

Just as he was feeling depressed, he suddenly realized that something was amiss with the Chaos Egg.

In the past, after the Chaos Egg exploded, its foundation would be damaged. It would take some time to condense it again. Yet, after the Chaos Egg exploded, Zhou Wen didn’t sense any damage to its foundation. It was as though he could continue using the Chaos Egg

Zhou Wen gave it a try and indeed, the Chaos Egg appeared around him again.
