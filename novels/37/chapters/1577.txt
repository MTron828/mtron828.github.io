Chapter 1578: Zone Core

Translator: CKtalon

“Many people in Sunset City are ordinary people. I hope the two of you can

understand. Try your best not to implicate the innocent,” said Carlos.

This place was sufficiently far from Sunset City and the rules of the Forbidden

Land of the Gods were somewhat special, making it difficult for energy to be

transmitted over great distances; therefore, the possibility of Sunset City being

affected wasn’t high.

However, as a precaution, Carlos raised the issue.

“I think it’s best if you evacuate everyone,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright. Please wait a moment. Give me an hour.” Without wasting any time,

Carlos turned around and quickly returned to Sunset City.

Many core members of the Cape family in Sunset City were waiting for his

news in the meeting room.

Carlos, is that person really Jiuyang? Why is he here?”

“Are they really going to duel here?

“why did you order everyone to evacuate the Forbidden Land of the Gods?

After they stopped asking, Carlos slowly said, “They are going to have a duel in

the ancient city ruins. As a precaution, everyone has to temporarily leave the

Forbidden Land of the Gods.”

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief when they heard that.

“The abandoned city is far from our Sunset City. Furthermore, with the rules of

the Forbidden Land of the Gods, it’s impossible for shockwaves from the battle Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

to reach us. There’s no need to move, right?”

“There are more than a hundred thousand people in Sunset City. Evacuating

them isn’t that simple. Besides, no matter how strong Jiuyang is, ir’s

impossible for him to really massacre the city, right?”

“How strange. If it’s really Jiuyang, why would he fight Zhou Wen? Although

Zhou Wen is very strong, he shouldn’t have reached Jiuyang’s level, right?

Everyone discussed spiritedly, but most people didn’t change their opinions.

“Who has the final say here” Carlos asked expressionlessly.

Of course it’s you, but.” An elder from the Cape family wanted to say

something.

“Since you know that I call the shots, execute it. In an hour, everyone has to

leave Sunset City and the Forbidden Land of the Gods. If anyone has any

objections, you can report me to the family head in the future. Carry out my

orders immediately,” said Carlos coldly.

Everyone looked at each other. Although many people were unhappy, they

knew that it was useless to say anything else. This place was under Carlos’s

jurisdiction.

“This is making a mountain out of a molehill. We will definitely let the family

head hear about this.” The elder snorted coldly and got up to leave the meeting

room.

The others left one by one and began the evacuation.

Carlos got his subordinates to supervise the evacuation. After everyone had

left, a middle-aged man named Youkai came to Carlos and said, “Carlos, is

there really such a need? The abandoned city is very far from Sunset City. Even

a Calamity-grade battle shouldn’t affect this place. Furthermore, we forcefully

evacuated everyone because of this. This will affect our family’s reputation.”

Carlos shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “Although the chances aren’t

high, I can’t risk the lives of everyone in the city. Besides, it’s not like you don’t

know the grudge between Zhou Wen and our Cape family. He might very well

take the opportunity to seek revenge. Furthermore, I have a nagging feeling

that his trip here isn’t as simple as a duel. Why would he fight Jiuyang? Why did

he have to come to the Forbidden Land of the Gods to carry out the duel? There

must be a reason for this. Therefore, we can only watch him and prepare for

the worst.”

“Is Zhou Wen that strong” Youkai pondered.

“Do you think a Saint like Jiuyang will duel with anyone?” Carlos asked.

“That’s true. Ill go take a look as well.” It made sense when Youkai thought

about it. Although Jiuyang had lost to Egg Sovereign, everyone knew his

strength. How could such a person casually fight a weakling?

For Jiuyang to fight Zhou Wen meant that Zhou Wen was likely an existence on

the same level as Jiuyang. At the very least, he wasn’t much weaker.

Do you think it’s possible that Zhou Wen is Egg Sovereign?” Carlos suddenly

said.

“It’s really possible. Let’s go take a look.” Youka?’s eyes lit up.

After Carlos returned, Zhou Wen walked straight into the ruins, hoping to find

something new.

“What are you looking for?” Jiuyang suddenly asked as he followed Zhou Wen.

“It wasn’t easy for me to make this trip. I want to take a look. Perhaps I’ll gain

something,” Zhou Wen answered casually.

If you wish to find the Zone Core here, I’m afraid you will be disappointed. The

Forbidden Land of the Gods doesn’t have a Zone Core,” said Jiuyang.

“What’s a Zone Core!” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he roughly

guessed what Jiuyang was referring to.

“How did you advance to the Calamity grade without knowing what a Zone

Core is?” Jiuyang paused and didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to answer. He explained,

“A Zone Core is the core of a zone. To advance to the Calamity grade, you need

to find the Zone Core corresponding to your Essence EnerEy Art. Only by

absorbing the Zone Core can you advance to the Calamity grade. Typical

dimensional zones only have one core. If the core is destroyed, the dimensional

zone will be useless. This is also the reason why the various Calamity creatures

on Earth will destroy the dimensional zone they were born in.”

Then how do you know that there’s no Zone Core here? Zhou Wen never

expected to hear this. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have

taken so many detours.

“Zone Cores have their good and bad. The stronger a dimensional zone is, the

higher the quality of the Zone Core. After advancing to the Calamity grade, the

level of the Calamity Zone is directly related to the Zone Core. Typically, a Zone

Core is the same level as the Calamity grade. It’s divided into the levels of

Human Realm, Hell, and Heaven. If one absorbs a Human Realm Zone Core,

then after advancing to the Calamity grade, the Zone Core might very well stay

at the Human Realm forever. It’s almost impossible to improve further.”

After slightly adjusting his breathing rhythm, Jiuyang continued, “In the

Mythical era, the Forbidden Land of the Gods once had a Heaven-level Zone

Core. The so-called Battle of the Gods was actually just a contest for the Zone

Core here. Unfortunately, the Zone Core was ultimately destroyed. No one took

it away. Therefore, the Forbidden Land of the Gods is actually equivalent to

half a crippled dimensional zone.”

There’s actually such a thing? Who were the ones vying for the Zone Core back

then? How do I know what level the Zone Core is? Zhou Wen muttered

inwardly.

He had no idea that there was a division of levels when it came to Zone Cores.

He didn’t know any of this infomation when absorbing Zone Core. He felt that

just being able to fuse with his Essence Energy Art was sufficient, so he didn’t

think too much about it

lf the Ancient Sovereigm Sutra, i Refinement At, and Chaos Egg only

absorbed Zone Cores at the Human Realm, wouldn’t that mean that there’s no

way to improve further?Zhou Wen was somewhat worried.
