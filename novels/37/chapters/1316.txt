Chapter 1317: Zhang Family

“Chunqiu, what are you doing? Do what you have to do.” Eldest Uncle Zhang felt that something was amiss.

Zhang Chunqiu ignored him. Without hearing the woman’s answer, he continued, “Stirring of the Earth fire, growth of the Corpse Flower, and the rise of the dead. Only with these three conditions can the Drought Demon Fairy be resurrected.”

“Even if I’m not resurrected, destroying the Zhang family will be as easy as flipping my hand.” Drought Demon Fairy’s voice finally sounded again. Her words seemed to tacitly affirm the three conditions Zhang Chunqiu mentioned.

Zhang Chunqiu continued, “That’s natural. If you want to destroy my Zhang family, there’s no need to go through so much trouble. All you need to do is trigger the demonic nature in our bodies. However, I heard that the Earth fire is an extreme Yin flame. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it’s the flames of hell. The Corpse Flower born amidst the Earth fire is the source of all Yin. It’s most compatible with your strength.

“You were suppressed here. One-half of you is suppressed, but the other half probably wants to use the Earth fire and Corpse Flower to advance further.”

“Are these also the last words of that Zhang fellow?” Drought Demon Fairy asked.

Zhang Chunqiu didn’t answer as he continued, “From the looks of it, you have more or less succeeded. However, this extreme Yin power can’t break through the power of the rules. It’s not a power that should exist in this world. Therefore, you have to rely on a human’s body to descend into this world again.

“But this person isn’t an ordinary person. What you need is a physique that can withstand extreme Yin flames, but it can’t be of the pure Yin attribute. And this physique is extremely rare. Even in the Zhang family that has been invaded by demonic aura for countless years, I’m afraid only my sis has such a physique.”

“So what?” Drought Demon Fairy didn’t deny it.

“Therefore, no matter how strong you are, even if you can destroy our Zhang family without even moving a finger, if you can’t obtain my sister’s body, you won’t be able to truly stand tall in this world. You can only hide and live an abject life,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“Chunqiu, what are you doing?” Eldest Uncle Zhang’s voice was excited. Clearly, he was infuriated.

If Drought Demon Fairy was angered, the entire Zhang family—even the Zhang family’s children—who had been separated from the main family—would not be able to escape the calamity. This was because the demonic nature had already penetrated deep into the Zhang family’s genes.

“Family Head…” Seeing that Zhang Chunqiu was ignoring him, Eldest Uncle Zhang wanted Zhang Siyou to give the order to stop Zhang Chunqiu from spouting nonsense.

Zhang Siyou said indifferently, “Chunqiu is a child who knows his limits. He knows what to do and what not to do.”

Just as Eldest Uncle Zhang was about to say something, Drought Demon Fairy spoke again. All he could do was hold it back for the time being.

“You are right. Then, do you dare use the lives of your family to prevent my resurrection?” Drought Demon Fairy said indifferently.

“I wouldn’t dare. I only have a small condition. If you are resurrected, my Zhang family did something after all. It’s not too much to make a small request, right?” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“Speak; what are your conditions?” Drought Demon Fairy asked.

“I want to contract you.” Zhang Chunqiu seemed to have already thought of it as he said it out loud.

“That really is a tiny request,” Drought Demon Fairy said sarcastically. “Don’t you know that once I fuse with a human’s body, I don’t need to contract with humans like ordinary Guardians? I can also break through the restrictions of Earth’s rules?”

“I know. You don’t need a contract, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t. My condition is that you have to contract with me and become my Guardian for up to ten years. You are free to make a choice of staying or leaving after ten years. Otherwise, even if the Zhang family is wiped out, you can forget about obtaining her,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he stroked the coffin.

“Zhang… Chun… Qiu…” Eldest Uncle Zhang was alarmed and furious. He never expected Zhang Chunqiu to have such plans. He was using the entire Zhang family’s lives to satisfy his selfish desires.

“Do you think you have the qualifications to negotiate with me?” Drought Demon Fairy asked.

“Yes,” Zhang Chunqiu said firmly. “If you can forcefully snatch her away, you wouldn’t need to negotiate with us. Since you are negotiating with us, we naturally have what it takes to negotiate, right?”

Whoosh!

The Earth fire suddenly expanded and instantly enveloped the nearby area. It wasn’t just Zhang Chunqiu. Everyone in the Zhang family was enveloped by the Earth fire.

Strangely, the Zhang family members weren’t burned to death. Even their clothes weren’t ignited. However, many of the Zhang family members’ hair and eyes began to turn white. Their fingernails also turned into jade as they rapidly grew.

Many members of the Zhang family hugged their heads and fell to the ground in agony. It was as though something was gnawing at their brains.

Zhang Chunqiu was the first to bear the brunt. Others’ hair slowly turned white, but his hair instantly turned completely white. His eyes also turned jade-white. From afar, he looked like a blind man.

Zhang Chunqiu’s body trembled violently, but he didn’t cry out tragically like the others. He didn’t collapse to the ground and hug his head to wail. He continued standing there with the coffin, silently enduring everything.

His hair, eyes, nails, and even his skin turned snow-white in the blazing white flames. Amidst the flames, even his life force seemed to be rapidly drained.

“You will die in thirty seconds.” Drought Demon Fairy’s voice sounded again like a lofty monarch.

“Chunqiu, stop fooling around. You will kill all of us…” Eldest Uncle Zhang endured the excruciating pain and wanted to rush over and replace Zhang Chunqiu to send the coffin into the Corpse Flower. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

However, just as he stood up, he was stopped by Zhang Siyou.

“Second Brother, what are you doing? Do you want this to be the end of our Zhang family?” Eldest Uncle Zhang said angrily. He didn’t even call him family head.

Zhang Siyou said expressionlessly, “The Zhang family only has people who live standing, not ghosts who die on their knees. If conditions are negotiable, then it has to be fair. Since she’s taking someone from our Zhang family, she has to return one as well.”

“Nonsense. Go and capture Zhang Chunqiu,” Eldest Uncle Zhang ordered his trusted aides.

However, just as his trusted aides stepped forward, they were stopped by the Zhang family.

“You… Do you have a death wish?” Uncle Zhang was alarmed and furious.

“Our Zhang family had the ancestral Celestial Master and the Hero King. Just as the family head said, from ancient times, there are only Zhang family members who live as heroes. There shall not be any trash from the Zhang family who kneel before death. Even if we become the devil, the Zhang family members have to be the devil incarnate, not the devil’s lap dogs who live abject lives…” An old man from the Zhang family, who was on the brink of death, collapsed to the ground. He grabbed the walking stick with both hands and propped himself up. He shouted at Zhang Chunqiu, “Child, do your best. The Zhang family can be afraid of death, but we can’t be cowardly. Even if we die, we will die an honorable death. I’ll pave the way for you.”

Bang!

The elder raised his cane and smashed it on his head. Immediately, blood flowed down from his head and he died on the spot.
