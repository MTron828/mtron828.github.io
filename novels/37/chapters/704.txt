Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed when he saw Medusa’s stats. The weakest Mythical that Zhou Wen had seen was Primordial Spore.

However, Primordial Spore still had the Eternal Immortality Life Providence that made it invincible. It also had a parasitic skill that was very useful.

Medusa was ridiculously weak in contrast. She didn’t have any skills. Her Life Providence was Tragic Beauty—a negative skill that actually reduced her stats.

The only useful ones were probably the Eyes of Enticement and the Demon God Transformation.

The Eyes of Enticement were very similar to the Eyes of Petrification. They could petrify people, but the limitations of the Eyes of Enticement were much greater than the Eyes of Petrification.

The Demon God Transformation was even more ridiculous. It was actually a single-time use Wheel of Destiny. The annotation was very clear. Once used, it would forever transform into a Demon God, making it impossible for her to be restored to her human body. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

From the looks of it, after using the Demon God Transformation, Medusa should become a snake-haired demoness. Although becoming a snake-haired demoness will definitely be much stronger than she is now, she’s just too ugly in that form. She still looks good now... However, good looks can’t be eaten or used to block bullets. What’s the point?

Although he had such thoughts, Zhou Wen still couldn’t bring himself to do it when he thought about how such a beautiful Medusa would become an ugly snake-haired demoness.

Forget it. I’ll keep her for now. Who knows what special effects she might have? Zhou Wen planned on farming Medusa tomorrow to see if Medusa in her girl form would continue dropping Companion Eggs.

If a Companion Egg dropped, he would try to see what would happen after the Demon God Transformation.

...

Before Medusa respawned again, a Companion Beast challenged Origin Realm King on the rankings. This time, it was none other than Death of the Underworld.

Li Xuan invited Zhou Wen to watch the duel at the cube. When they arrived, the Origin Realm King still hadn’t accepted the challenge.

“Old Zhou, who do you think will win this battle?” Li Xuan asked.

“It’s hard to tell,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.

The battle between Origin Realm King and Death of the Underworld was worth watching. Zhou Wen couldn’t predict the final outcome.

Death of the Underworld had a Spirit Body, rendering physical damage virtually ineffective. It was useless even if Origin Realm King entered its body.

However, it was also unknown if Death of the Underworld’s attacks were effective against Origin Realm King. Therefore, Zhou Wen was very curious about the outcome of the battle.

Soon, only ten minutes were left for the countdown. Just like the last time, the name on the ranking flashed at the end. Origin Realm King had accepted the challenge.

Everyone, including Zhou Wen, widened their eyes. They wanted to know how Death of the Underworld would deal with Origin Realm King. With the experience gleaned from Light Beast’s lesson, Death of the Underworld would definitely do something. It might even use its Wheel of Destiny to transport the Origin Realm King into the Underworld for the final battle, just like with Primordial Sword Immortal.

However, to everyone’s surprise, after Origin Realm King accepted the challenge, Death of the Underworld did nothing but float in the air.

“What’s going on? Why isn’t Death of the Underworld moving? Does he want to be passive and end up getting beaten?”

“Shouldn’t he strike first to force out the invisible Origin Realm King?”

“What is he trying to do?”

People discussed as they guessed what Death of the Underworld was planning.

Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat when he saw the motionless Death of the Underworld. It was as though it had fallen asleep while floating there. It was not good.

That’s bad. Someone has guessed that Origin Realm King is a microscopic Companion Beast just like me. They know that its strength is insufficient to kill a top Mythical Companion Beast, so they want to use the characteristics of Origin Realm King to stall for time. They want to wait until the countdown ends before defeating Origin Realm King... Zhou Wen already understood Death of the Underworld’s strategy.

In fact, Zhou Wen had thought of a similar method. For example, if Tyrant Behemoth challenged Origin Realm King, Origin Realm King wouldn’t be able to kill Tyrant Behemoth, so he could continue delaying until the time was up.

However, as Tyrant Behemoth might not be able to kill Origin Realm King, Zhou Wen gave up on this plan. Now that Death of the Underworld had used this plan, it meant that its master was confident that he could defeat Origin Realm King at the final moment.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that Origin Realm King would definitely take this opportunity to kill Death of the Underworld. However, to his surprise, Origin Realm King didn’t take any action.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and immediately understood that Origin Realm King’s master was indeed smart.

It was the best choice for him not to let Origin Realm King move.

If Origin Realm King was really as Zhou Wen and company had guessed—a microscopic Companion Beast that wasn’t very strong—then if it were to attack now, not only would it fail to kill Death of the Underworld, but it would also expose its true strength, allowing the master of Death of the Underworld to understand its weakness.

However, Origin Realm King remained motionless, giving Death of the Underworld immense pressure.

If it didn’t move, Death of the Underworld’s master wouldn’t be able to confirm if his judgment was correct. This would raise doubts.

Could it be that Origin Realm King also wants to stall for time? Could it be that it’s different from my conclusion? Could it be confident that it can defeat Death of the Underworld at the end of the countdown?

All sorts of guesses appeared in people’s minds. It was originally Death of the Underworld who was stalling for time, but it devolved into both sides stalling for time. No one could be sure whether Origin Realm King had the ability to defeat Death of the Underworld.

If this continued, there would be no time or chance in the event Death of the Underworld was defeated.

If Death of the Underworld were to attack now, the previous plan would fail. It would also expose Death of the Underworld’s strength. It was equivalent to shooting oneself in the foot.

Although the two Companion Beasts in the arena didn’t move, the battle had already begun. Such a battle was no longer limited to the confines of the arena. Instead, the owners of the two Companion Beasts were having a psychological game.

Ordinary people couldn’t figure out the mystery behind it. After waiting all day, people who were originally looking forward to a huge battle ended up surprised to watch a battle in which one of the Companion Beasts couldn’t be seen while the other Companion Beast remained motionless. It left them depressed.

“What the hell? Wasn’t this supposed to be a challenge? Why aren’t they fighting?”

“Hurry up and fight. Let us see which is the best—Origin Realm King or Death of the Underworld.”

“Can’t you tell? Death of the Underworld doesn’t even dare to move. It must be afraid of Origin Realm King. When Origin Realm King makes a move, Death of the Underworld will die like Light Beast.”

“Bullsh*t. It’s obvious that Origin Realm King is afraid of Death of the Underworld. Don’t you see that it doesn’t dare to attack? Death of the Underworld is almost falling asleep waiting for it to attack.”

The arena remained still. The fans of the two Companion Beasts and the streamers who supported them were the first to engage in a war of words.
