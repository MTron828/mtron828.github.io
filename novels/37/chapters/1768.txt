Chapter 1769 The Abnormal Demonic Neonate

“There are indeed survivors from the Three-Eyed Gods.” Holy Lord Trajectory wasn’t too surprised to see the Three-Eyed Gods.

Even the powerful Immortals didn’t have the ability to destroy the Gods along with their divine mountain back then; therefore, there was definitely something amiss.

However, after so many years, no one could figure out the truth.

Now that a golden Three-Eyed God had appeared, Holy Lord Trajectory wanted to use this opportunity to understand the truth behind the disappearance of the Gods.

The other alien factions had the same thoughts as they paid attention to the Cube’s screen.

However, from their point of view, a mere human was doomed. It was impossible for him to cause much of a stir in front of the Three-Eyed God that possessed a golden vertical eye.

The only thing they were interested in was how the Three-Eyed God would kill Zhou Wen. From this, they could tell how much strength the Three-Eyed God retained.

The moment Zhou Wen saw the Three-Eyed God, he felt like he was a father being tricked by his child. His first thought was to immediately escape, but the temple seemed to imprison him with some special power. He couldn’t use spatial skills to leave.

It wasn’t an ordinary taboo rule. Otherwise, the Teacher Domain would definitely be able to crack it.

According to Zhou Wen’s experience, that power was likely a very pure power. It was so pure that other power determinants couldn’t exist in it. Therefore, in such a pure power domain, no ability could be used unless one’s power broke through the purity of this power.

Neonate, oh Neonate, you really screwed me over this time. Zhou Wen attempted to retreat – his body wasn’t restrained.

The omnipresent pure power that filled the entire temple suppressed all abilities, but it didn’t affect Zhou Wen’s body at all. Even Zhou Wen marveled at this strange characteristic.

However, he didn’t have the time to study this now. All he wanted to do was stay as far away from the Three-Eyed God as possible. Even if he couldn’t leave the temple, it was better to stay away from him.

The aura emitted by the Three-Eyed God made him feel extreme danger. Although he couldn’t determine the exact level of the Three-Eyed God, Zhou Wen had a strong feeling that he was an Apocalypse-grade existence.

He reached out to grab Demonic Neonate’s tiny hand and wanted to pull her back with him, but Demonic Neonate had no intention of retreating at all. She stood there without moving as she stared at the Three-Eyed God.

Under everyone’s gaze, the Three-Eyed God slowly stood up.

He originally sat there with an extremely oppressive aura, but after standing up, the aura became even more terrifying. Even just watching from the livestream screen made him feel like a godking who controlled everything. It was as though a casual glance from him could kill all life.

Zhou Wen’s heart was in his throat, but despite pulling hard, Demonic Neonate remained motionless as she continued looking at the Three-Eyed God.

Has this child… gone silly… That shouldn’t be the case… Zhou Wen thought to himself.

No one knew Demonic Neonate’s personality better than Zhou Wen. She liked to hide in the shadows and sneak an attack. How could she not weigh the pros and cons and insist on standing there waiting for death? Could it be that Demonic Neonate has a plan? Zhou Wen looked at the Three-Eyed God who was slowly walking down the stairs. He gritted his teeth and stood there motionless.

Neonate, oh Neonate, don’t screw me over. Zhou Wen knew that even if he didn’t hide his strength, he only had a 1% chance of survival in a head-on battle with the Three-Eyed God.

This 1% chance was only thanks to Sigh of the King, not because his strength was enough to survive.

I should have known that something would happen every time I enter a true dimensional zone. I shouldn’t have come. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly, but he could only wait for a miracle to happen.

Is a mere human worthy of having such a noble God get up to kill him? Could it be that the power of the Three-Eyed God has already weakened to such an extent? Holy Lord Trajectory frowned slightly.

It wasn’t just him. Basically, the alien powerhouses who knew of the Gods’ former glory believed that it was beneath the Three-Eyed God to get up and walk down the stairs.

Golden Three-Eyed Gods were at the peak of the Apocalypse grade. They could kill creatures below the Apocalypse grade without even moving their fingers. Even if there were thousands of creatures below the Apocalypse grade, they would be reduced to ashes with a mere thought.

Upon seeing the golden Three-Eyed God get up and walk down, the alien powerhouses basically believed that his strength had weakened tremendously. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to do such a thing.

Ordinary humans didn’t know how terrifying the golden Three-Eyed God was as they discussed how Zhou Wen was going to kill him.

“I wonder if the City Lord will personally take action this time… Or will he let that adorable Companion Beast kill the golden giant…” In front of Guide City’s Cube, many people were discussing this problem. Clearly, they were very confident in Zhou Wen.

If three of his students could easily enter the rankings, how bad could Zhou Wen be as their teacher?

“Ignorant humans, Zhou Wen is dead,” Trajectory Seeking said with a cold snort.

She wasn’t convinced about Zhou Wen despite taking him as her master. She refused to address him as ‘Teacher.’ However, her words came from the bottom of her heart.

“Young lady, don’t think that the giant is very strong just because he’s tall and mighty. Among the monsters our City Lord Zhou has killed, there are many who are much bigger than him. There’s nothing impressive about him. It will probably only take two or three strikes,” an elder beside her informed Trajectory Seeking with a smile. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Two to three strikes? I don’t think there’s a need for that,” Trajectory Seeking said with a sneer.

“True. Our City Lord Zhou is a godlike figure. A single strike should be enough for such a giant. At most, two strikes,” the elder said with a chuckle, believing that Trajectory Seeking agreed with him.

Many citizens beside him echoed, feeling that the elder was right.

Most ordinary people in Guide City treated Zhou Wen as a god. In their hearts, Zhou Wen was an invincible existence. Killing the giant would be easy.

Keep laughing. Let’s see if you can still laugh when you see Zhou Wen smacked to death later. Trajectory Seeking couldn’t be bothered to argue with such ignorant citizens as she thought disdainfully.

“Is that three-eyed giant very strong?” Li Xuan wasn’t an ordinary person. He could naturally sense that the Three-Eyed God was very strong, so he asked Trajectory Seeking worriedly.

“Strong? You can be a little more confident and use an affirmative tone.” Trajectory Seeking finally grasped an opportunity and said immediately, “The golden Three-Eyed Gods at their peak were unparalleled and powerful existences in the dimension. They were almost synonymous with invincibility…”

As Trajectory Seeking spoke, her voice suddenly came to a halt. Her eyes, which were still glued to the Cube’s screen, gradually widened. Even at her limits, they were still expanding. Her eye sockets almost failed to contain her eyeballs.
