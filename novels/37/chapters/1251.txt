Chapter 1252: Time Hut

Zhou Wen’s smile froze when he saw the words ‘Time Hut.’

He had heard of this dimensional zone before, and it wasn’t just him. There were probably very few people on Earth who didn’t know about the Time Hut dimensional zone.

Many mainstream media had reported on the Time Hut dimensional zone. In that dimensional zone, the flow of time was completely different from the outside world.

There had been people who went in for a moment—turning from young men to dying old men. There were also old men who turned into babies after entering.

Furthermore, the flow of time inside was unpredictable. Whether one could come out after entering didn’t depend on how powerful one was, but on one’s luck.

It might be better for experts who were proficient in temporal powers to enter the Time Hut, but Zhou Wen wasn’t good at temporal abilities.

“Isn’t Time Hut a temporal dimensional zone? Why does it have a spatial skill?” Zhou Wen asked Gu Dian for more detail.

Gu Dian sent the information regarding Time Hut to Zhou Wen. It was clearly confidential information. Most of the content hadn’t been reported by the media, and it was highly detailed.

Although the Time Hut was called a hut, there were actually many rooms inside. The flow of time in every room was different. Some of the rooms had been explored before and the flow of time inside was known.

As for some rooms, none of the humans who entered had managed to come out. Therefore, no one knew the situation inside.

Even in the known rooms, the flow of time was variable.

The spatial skill crystal Gu Dian mentioned belonged to a Mythical creature named Spacetime Piglet in one of the rooms.

According to Gu Dian’s information, Spacetime Piglet had temporal and spatial skills. Someone had obtained a spatial skill after killing a Spacetime Piglet. Later on, that skill was sold to Cave Era. Cave Era had once used that skill, and it indeed had the ability to extend space.

Zhou Wen planned on heading to the Time Hut to take a look. It was too risky to enter the Time Hut, but he wanted to see if there was a tiny palm symbol there.

If he had the tiny palm symbol and could download the dungeon, he could farm in-game to his heart’s content. It shouldn’t be difficult to obtain a skill crystal.

“Young Master Wen, aren’t you going to continue?” An Sheng hurriedly shouted when he saw that Zhou Wen was about to leave.

“I’ll be heading out for a while. I’ll train when I’m back.” Zhou Wen was in a rush to head to the Time Hut as he continued walking out.

An Sheng moved his mouth as though he wanted to say something, but he ultimately didn’t.

After leaving the base with Zhou Wen, An Sheng shook his head helplessly when he saw Zhou Wen’s figure vanish. “Doesn’t this fellow have any human needs like entertainment or emotion?”

The distance to the West District was relatively far, but to Zhou Wen who had the ability to teleport, it was virtually nothing. Furthermore, it wasn’t as risky for him compared to others.

He took Ya’er with him to the West District as a vacation.

…

Ever since Tsukuyomi had cleared the Venusian instance dungeon, no other creatures had entered. All the major factions were making preparations. The most important job was to capture Thief Sage.

Apart from obtaining the Dragon Turtle Companion Egg, they also wanted to use Thief Sage’s spatial teleportation ability to help them clear the Venusian dimensional zone.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The creatures in space never appeared again. The angel with black wings from before never reappeared.

Strange; even Tsukuyomi has appeared. Why didn’t the black-winged angel enter the Venusian dimensional zone? Could it be that not all creatures in space are restricted? Zhou Wen guessed.

In fact, after Zhou Wen obtained Grim Reaper No. 10, he had been wondering if he could obtain another angel Companion Beast. To his surprise, the black-winged angel hadn’t appeared.

Zhou Wen released Ice Maiden and Jade Rabbit, while Demonic Neonate and Ya’er sat on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back. They weren’t far from the Time Hut and there weren’t many people around, so Zhou Wen let them out for a breather.

“What’s this place? It looks pretty good.” Grim Demon was seldom released. He had the excitement of having just been released from prison. Everything looked fresh.

“The Peninsula of Gods,” Zhou Wen answered casually.

Zhou Wen had been to the Peninsula of Gods before. He had obtained Medusa and the Golden Battle God Halberd, as well as the Invisibility Cloak here.

Meeting Zhong Ziya seemed like yesterday, but now, the two of them were separated. No one knew if they would have the chance to meet again in the future.

I wonder how Lucas is now. Zhou Wen thought of the fellow known as a hero.

Five years ago, Lucas often sent him messages, but ever since Zhou Wen had been trapped for five years, he hadn’t received any messages from him.

Speaking of which, Zhou Wen really missed that fellow. Such a person would always leave an indelible impression.

When they arrived at the human city closest to the Time Hut, they saw many humans walking on the streets with their Companion Beasts.

Trolls, elemental sprites, sea demons, and so on. There were all sorts of strange Companion Beasts that were too much for the eyes to take in. In contrast, the Companion Beasts Zhou Wen brought looked rather ordinary.

“How do I get to Time Hut?” Zhou Wen bought some things from a shop and asked the boss the way to Time Hut.

He only knew that the Time Hut was in a forest, but he didn’t know its exact location.

“As a foreigner, it’s best to hire a guide to lead you to the Time Hut. Otherwise, it’s very easy to get lost in the strange forest.” The boss was very enthusiastic when he saw how generous Zhou Wen was with his purchases.

“Do you have a map?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Yes, it’s cheap. Twenty bucks for one, but the path in the strange forest always changes. Having a map isn’t much different from not having one. Only an experienced guide can quickly find the location of the Time Hut.” The boss handed a map to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen took the map and looked at it. He saw that the map was rather detailed. It indicated the path to the strange forest. However, although the map in the strange forest was very detailed, there were many annotations. It indicated that paths might not exist at times and could only be used as a reference.

This was enough for Zhou Wen. After putting away the map, Zhou Wen asked, “Where in the Peninsula of Gods is Hero Lucas in?”

“What Hero Lucas?” The boss was slightly taken aback.

“It’s that famous hero who once killed Medusa.” Zhou Wen was slightly surprised that someone on the Peninsula of Gods didn’t recognize Lucas.

When the boss heard that, he thought carefully for a while before saying in enlightenment, “There seems to be such a person. However, it happened many years ago. There are so many heroes nowadays. We don’t remember people from so long ago that well. Now, the most famous hero on our Peninsula of Gods is Boss…”
