Chapter 1839: Destiny Platform

Translator: CKtalon

“Can I try taking it?” Zhou Wen turned to ask the girl.

“Feel free to give it a shot.” Bravest clearly didn’t realize the seriousness of the matter and readily agreed to Zhou Wen’s requested attempt.

There were many experts in the Sand Sea, and almost every one of them had tried. If it was possible, they would have long taken it away instead of leaving it here.

Even Apocalypse-grade powerhouses were helpless against it, much less Zhou Wen who was only a Calamity. No matter how powerful a Calamity was, one was only a Calamity.

Zhou Wen reached out to hug the hourglass and exerted his strength to lift it up.

However, the outcome was tragic. The hourglass didn’t even budge. It was unimaginably heavy. It was probably much heavier than a mountain.

“How was that? Do you still want to give it another go?” Bravest asked with a smile. She had long expected this outcome.

“Let me try again.” With a thought, Zhou Wen transformed into Supreme Hell King’s huge body. Then, he reached out to grab the hourglass and unleashed his full strength again.

No matter how hard he tried, the hourglass remained motionless as though it had been welded shut.

“Haha, why aren’t you trying?” Bravest asked with a laugh when she saw Zhou Wen return to his human form.

“I still have to give it a try, but I want to try something else.” With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate.

Demonic Neonate was the Child of Dimension after all. She was the true protagonist of this world. All sorts of treasures placed before her were fated to be hers. What others couldn’t remove didn’t mean that Demonic Neonate couldn’t.

“If you can’t even do it, what can this little one do?” Bravest curled her lips and commented.

“We’ll only know if it works after trying,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“Try as much as you want. Summon a few more little ones. Don’t tire her out.” Bravest stood there with her arms crossed, looking like she was watching a good show.

Demonic Neonate glanced at the girl before turning to look at the hourglass. She had no intention of walking over. Instead, she took off the Vajra Chakram and shone it at the hourglass.

Immediately, the surrounding buildings and the Sand Sea shook. The seawater-like sand kept churning as the buildings were swept up.

Bravest’s expression changed drastically. When she looked at the hourglass again, she realized that it had already vanished.

“You… You… You…” Bravest almost burst out in tears. She knew that she was in big trouble. This hourglass was the foundation of the Sand Sea race. Without it, the Sand Sea race wouldn’t be able to continue expanding in the future. “Quickly return the hourglass!”

“That’s quite impossible. It’s impossible for the things she puts away to come out again. I’m afraid it has already been destroyed,” Zhou Wen said helplessly as he spread out his hands.

“I don’t care. You have to return it. Otherwise, I’m dead…” Bravest paced around anxiously.

“Is it that serious?” Zhou Wen pretended to be deep in thought. “The hourglass has already been destroyed, so it definitely can’t be returned. How about this? Since you are going to the Heavenly Happiness Temple together, why don’t we leave now and leave this place to prevent you from being implicated?”

Bravest gritted her teeth and said, “How can that do?”

“I can’t do anything about it if you can’t. I’ll be leaving now. Take your time to consider it.” With that said, Zhou Wen turned around and quickly left.

He had already taken their treasure. Was he going to wait for them to fight him?

“Don’t go!” Bravest immediately chased after him.

The two of them traversed the Sand Sea, one at the heel of the other. At that moment, the Sand Sea was still trembling, throwing the Sand Sea race into chaos; no one knew what had happened.

With Zhou Wen and Bravest’s speed, they quickly rushed out of the Sand Sea’s range. This was the result of Zhou Wen deliberately waiting for the girl without using spatial teleportation.

“Why aren’t you running?” Bravest nearly slammed into Zhou Wen when he made an abrupt stop.

“I don’t know the way. I need you to lead,” Zhou Wen said.

“How can you humans be so shameless? You stole our race’s cornerstone treasure and still want me to lead the way for you?” Bravest said angrily.

“Didn’t you ask me to take it? When did it become stealing? You were the one who said that I could take it,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“When was that said? I said try… try… Do you understand?” Bravest snapped back angrily.

“That might be because my comprehension is lacking. I’m sorry. Now that I’ve taken it and destroyed it, there’s nothing that can be done. Let’s quickly head to the Heavenly Happiness Temple,” Zhou Wen said sincerely.

“This…” Bravest hesitated.

Zhou Wen could naturally tell that the girl was in a dilemma. Otherwise, with her Apocalypse grade, how could she not have caught up to him after so long? The girl probably hadn’t decided whether she should capture Zhou Wen.

“How about this? Let’s go to the Heavenly Happiness Temple first before we come up with a solution.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he walked forward. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The girl wore a complicated expression. Seeing that Zhou Wen had already walked far into the distance, she had no choice but to follow.

“Don’t even think about escaping. You have to return our cornerstone treasure.”

“Got it. Why are you looking for the Heavenly Happiness God?”

“It’s none of your business.”

“Then I should know your name, right? How should I address you?”

“Ah Yong.”

“Ah Yong, how did you advance to the Apocalypse grade?”

“I was born in the Apocalypse grade. Why would I need advancement? That’s something only the weak need.”

…

Zhou Wen chatted with Ah Yong and roughly learned of her situation.

However, Ah Yong refused to reveal why she wanted to visit the Heavenly Happiness God.

In fact, he didn’t need to ask to guess. What else could a creature ask from the Heavenly Happiness God? They naturally wanted descendants.

It would be a pity for Ah Yong who had such good genes to not leave a descendant. Not only should she leave one, but she should also leave plenty.

Zhou Wen was already considering if he should think of a way to enter the Source of Life and obtain some high-level Companion Eggs.

A Companion Egg left behind by a creature like Ah Yong might be a natural Apocalypse. He would be rich if he could get a few.

With this thought in mind, the more Zhou Wen looked at Ah Yong, the more he found her pleasing to the eye. He even found Ah Yong a little familiar.

However, Zhou Wen only believed that it was an illusion. Sometimes, people were like that. It was inevitable that they would encounter a few strangers that they found familiar.

Ah Yong clearly didn’t know the way. Under her lead, the two of them took many detours. Thankfully, when others saw Ah Yong’s fearless Apocalypse-grade aura, no one dared to stop them. Instead, they arrived at the Heavenly Happiness Temple without much trouble.

When Zhou Wen arrived at the Heavenly Happiness Temple again, he felt somewhat wistful.

“Why are you here again?” Emperor of Shang was rather surprised to see Zhou Wen walk into the Heavenly Happiness Temple with an Apocalypse-grade dimensional creature behind him.

“I need help with something.”

“Did you deliver the message I entrusted you with?” Emperor of Shang asked.

“Yes.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “She didn’t say anything.”

Emperor of Shang nodded and said, “Speak. What do you want me to help you with?”

“Actually, it’s nothing. I just want you to give me directions,” Zhou Wen said in embarrassment.

“What directions?” Emperor of Shang imagined that Zhou Wen’s ‘directions’ was just an analogy, but to his surprise, Zhou Wen was really here to ask for directions.

However, after hearing Zhou Wen’s description of the place, Emperor of Shang’s expression turned odd. “Why do you want to go to Destiny Platform?”

“Don’t you know that the Cube battle is held there?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled; Emperor of Shang didn’t seem to know anything.

“I haven’t left this place for thousands of years. How would I know what’s happening outside?” Emperor of Shang sighed and continued, “I advise you not to go to the Destiny Platform.”

“Why?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. The Cube battles had already started; why couldn’t he go?

“The Destiny Platform is where the King of the Dimension ascends the throne. Only the King of the Dimension can stand there. If it’s not the destined King of the Dimension, anyone who stands on it will only die.” Emperor of Shang’s words gave Zhou Wen a fright.
