Chapter 1129: Birth

Zhou Wen secretly circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra as invisible karmic sinflames emitted from his body. The ghosts didn’t dare approach him.

Fang Mingsu and company were besieged, but Zhou Wen was leisurely sitting on the bamboo watching the battle.

Yuki Onna‘s abilities were very similar to Ice Maiden’s, and their battle prowess was also very close.

Of Hashihime and Umibōzu who had a lute on his back, one appeared and disappeared unpredictably. The other delivered aural attacks. As for the Daitengu, not only did it possess both strength and speed, but it was also proficient in curse-type powers.

The four Terror-grade creatures attacked Fang Mingsu together. Even though the phoenix flames were very effective against Yin-attribute dimensional creatures, he was still at a disadvantage.

The soldiers were in an even worse state. Fang Mingsu was no longer able to take care of them. Just the shockwaves from the Terror-grade battle killed more than half of them.

Only the baldy and a few powerful ones rushed out of the danger zone, but they found themselves in an endless sea of ghosts. It was only a matter of time before they died.

Zhou Wen didn’t save them. Not because he didn’t want to save them, but that there was no hope.

No matter how powerful the phoenix flames were, no matter how strong Fang Mingsu was, he was only at the Terror grade. Power at the Calamity grade surged out from the well. The terrifying Yin aura was endless like a tidal wave, greatly augmenting the ghosts. Even if they were killed, they would constantly regenerate amidst the Yin aura.

The Calamity creature was about to be born. If Zhou Wen didn’t escape Bride Island quickly, he would probably be in danger, much less be able to save the others.

Zhou Wen summoned the Earth Elemental Beast and used Earth Escape to quickly move around the island in search of Shiraishi Satomi.

Now, all the ghosts were attracted to Fang Mingsu and company. The powerful ghosts no longer had the time or energy to deal with Zhou Wen.

Bride Island was filled with ghost creatures. Before long, Zhou Wen found Shiraishi Satomi, who was fighting the ghosts.

Shiraishi Satomi’s attainments in the sword were extremely high. Furthermore, her abilities had hints of Transcendent Flying Immortal. She stormed through the horde of ghosts and killed many dimensional creatures.

Unfortunately, she was still at the Epic stage. After encountering a Mythical monster, she was unable to keep up. She was greatly suppressed.

Zhou Wen walked towards Shiraishi Satomi as the Great Brahma aura on his body revealed itself slightly. The ghosts around him immediately retreated as though they had encountered poisonous creatures like snakes or scorpions. They didn’t dare stand in front of Zhou Wen.

When Zhou Wen arrived in front of Shiraishi Satomi, the ghosts had already retreated to a distance of a hundred meters. None of them dared to rush forward—even those at the Mythical stage.

“I’m fine.” Shiraishi Satomi looked at Zhou Wen before looking at the retreating dimensional creatures with an abnormal expression.

“That’s good. Let’s go.” Zhou Wen led Shiraishi Satomi to the beach. Even if he couldn’t find a way to break out of the spatial rift, he had to force his way out. Otherwise, he could only wait for death.

When he had killed Di Tian, the Immortal Culling Sword Sword had nearly taken Zhou Wen’s life. He didn’t want another repeat.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen already knew that the Di Tian he had killed was only an avatar. The real Di Tian had been killed by Wang Mingyuan’s sneak attack.

Zhou Wen led Shiraishi Satomi along the coast, but unfortunately, they didn’t find a way out. It was as though all the places were enveloped by spatial rifts, preventing them from leaving.

Boom!

In the village, a terrifying Yin aura surged into the sky like a volcanic eruption, instantly turning the sky black. It was clearly daytime, but it now looked like night.

“The Calamity creature is about to appear...” Shiraishi Satomi’s expression changed.

Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He knew that it wasn’t realistic to find a way out. The only way was to use force.

Striking a spatial rift with force was definitely unrealistic. A spatial rift was equivalent to a blade pointing out. The faster one charged, the faster they would die.

Zhou Wen’s so-called use of force was actually to use a trick. It wasn’t a reckless charge.

After circulating the Godfiend Era, Zhou Wen engraved a clown-like symbol on the Wheel of Destiny. This symbol represented the Godfiend Life Providence and the New Era Life Soul. It had a strange spatial power.

Just spatial powers weren’t enough for Zhou Wen to rush out of Bride Island that was covered in spatial rifts.

Let me see if space here has really been completely sealed. Zhou Wen extended his finger and the clown ring appeared on his finger. At the same time, the clown’s eyes flashed with a strange and warped light.

As the power of the clown ring was released, the spatial fluctuations on the ring became more and more intense, as though it was about to resonate with the spatial rifts on Bride Island.

At that moment, he suddenly saw a golden beam flash in the sky. A golden figure flew over like a comet.

Boom!

The golden ball of light landed on the beach. It was Fang Mingsu, who was hugging Ji Moqing.

Fang Mingsu was in terrible condition. The Guardian armor on his body had already cracked in many places. Blood constantly seeped out from the cracks. It looked like his injuries were not light.

Fang Mingsu suddenly threw Ji Moqing, who was in his arms, at Zhou Wen. At the same time, he said, “I’ll hold them back and give you time to escape. If you can escape, take her with you.”

“I’m afraid you can’t hold on any longer.” Zhou Wen looked in the direction of the well and could already sense that there was an extremely terrifying creature accompanying the Yin aura.

As for the four Terror-grade creatures, they had already caught up. Under the augmentation of the endless Yin aura, Daitengu, Yuki Onna, Hashihime, and Umibōzu‘s strength were greatly augmented. It was very unlikely for Fang Mingsu to match them.

“I’ll hold them back, but it won’t be for long.” As Fang Mingsu spoke, the phoenix flames on his body rose again. He was like a phoenix that had been reborn from the flames of nirvana. The wounds on his body rapidly healed as his vitality increased greatly.

Soon, Ji Moqing could no longer see Fang Mingsu. All she could see was a golden flame that resembled a phoenix dancing in the black sky.

The fire phoenix charged between the four Terror creatures and forcefully suppressed them. The ordinary ghosts around them were reduced to ashes by the phoenix flames. It was unimaginably terrifying.

The phoenixes’ Guardian is indeed terrifying. He can actually produce such terrifying strength in such a harsh environment. Although Zhou Wen felt that Fang Mingsu was indeed very strong, he didn’t believe that he could stall for too long.

This was because Zhou Wen had already sensed that the Calamity creature in the well had been born.

At that moment, a figure slowly emerged from the ancient well.

The flaming phoenix that Fang Mingsu had transformed into danced wildly. Wherever it passed, golden flames would destroy the world. The Yuki Onna was restrained too much and could no longer participate in the battle.

Daitengu‘s hair and beard were charred black, making it look extremely pathetic.

Hashihime and Umibōzu couldn’t approach Fang Mingsu either. Instantly, Fang Mingsu suppressed the four Terror-grade creatures with his own strength. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but marvel at how powerful the phoenixes were. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Meanwhile, the clown ring on Zhou Wen’s finger kept flickering, but it was still a little short of taking the final step for the breakthrough.

Suddenly, a white figure walked over from the ancient well. It looked like it was walking very slowly, but in the blink of an eye, it had already appeared on the battlefield.
