Chapter 1163: There’s Something Very Problematic About You

“Young Master Wen, are you still busy? The food has been prepared. Overseer is here to take Miss Ya’er back. Why don’t you let Miss Ya’er return for dinner?” An Sheng arrived outside the training room and pressed the video doorbell.

Before Zhou Wen could finish writing, he got Ya’er to open the door for An Sheng and company.

Ya’er opened the door and An Tianzuo and company looked inside. Indeed, they saw Qin Zhen standing there.

However, what puzzled An Tianzuo and company was that Qin Zhen and Zhou Wen weren’t sparring. It didn’t even look like they had sparred. Instead, Zhou Wen was standing in front of a table, writing. Qin Zhen was watching from the side, completely engrossed.

Does this punk know calligraphy? An Tianzuo was puzzled.

Writing beautiful words wasn’t difficult for humans at their level and their level of evolution.

He didn’t even need much practice. All he needed to do was take a look at some famous masterpieces and he could easily imitate the beautiful fonts.

However, a nice font didn’t mean it was good calligraphy. One needed to fuse their thoughts into the words to form a unique style. Only then could it be called calligraphy.

An Tianzuo secretly glanced at it and realized that although Zhou Wen’s words weren’t ugly, they definitely weren’t good.

Yet, such ordinary calligraphy left Qin Zhen engrossed as she stood there motionless.

Since it’s not a problem of the text, it should be the content. An Tianzuo wanted to see what Zhou Wen had written, but Zhou Wen had already finished writing.

After putting away the pen, Zhou Wen picked up the notebook and handed it to Qin Zhen. “Take a look.”

“Can... can I?” Qin Zhen didn’t dare to take it.

She had watched the entire process. Although Zhou Wen wrote quickly and the content was too profound, Qin Zhen had only taken a few general glances in many sections and hadn’t read them carefully.

However, just the content she saw made Qin Zhen understand that Zhou Wen wasn’t giving her parts of a sword art, but a systematic introduction to the sword art. Furthermore, it had some of Zhou Wen’s own experience and insights.

The value of this book made Qin Zhen hesitate.

“Of course. Sword arts are created for people to use. If you can learn it, take it,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

Qin Zhen looked at Zhou Wen and saw that his expression was the same as when he had given her the notebook. She couldn’t help but feel a little dazed as she reached out to receive the Transcendent Flying Immortal notebook that Zhou Wen had written.

An Tianzuo also understood that what Zhou Wen had written was likely some kind of sword art. From Qin Zhen’s solemn expression, he guessed that this sword art was no trifling matter.

However, An Tianzuo didn’t know if the sword art Zhou Wen had written was his or was obtained from somewhere else.

An Tianzuo wanted to know, but he didn’t ask.

However, An Sheng didn’t have any qualms. He said with a smile, “Young Master Wen, are you very familiar with Sword Immortal Qin? Can you even study sword arts together?”

Before Zhou Wen could say a word, Qin Zhen said with a serious expression, “Adjutant An, don’t joke around. How am I qualified to study sword techniques with Senior? Senior Zhou is my tutor. He taught me my sword arts.”

With that said, An Tianzuo and An Jing looked at each other. Qin Zhen could be said to be one of the most outstanding women in Sunset College over the years. She could go down in history for the school.

Yet, she said that Zhou Wen had taught her sword arts, but they knew very well that Zhou Wen had been missing for five years. How could he have taught Qin Zhen sword arts?

However, An Sheng didn’t care. His eyes darted around as he said to Qin Zhen, “Qin Zhen, since you learned your sword arts from Young Master Wen, you should be focusing on actual combat. Are you interested in joining the Sunset Army? On the one hand, you can protect everyone. On the other hand, you can also hone your sword arts...”

Qin Zhen didn’t answer as she looked at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen glared at An Sheng and said, “My sword art does focus on actual combat, and it’s extremely risky in actual combat. You might lose your life if you aren’t careful. It’s best to follow your heart and not be affected by others.”

An Sheng smiled without saying a word as though he hadn’t seen Zhou Wen’s glare.

Qin Zhen thought for a moment before looking at An Sheng and asking, “Can I go to the place that Senior went to in the past?”

“Of course, but it’s very dangerous there,” An Sheng said solemnly.

“I’m not afraid of danger,” Qin Zhen said.

“Then it’s settled. Sword Immortal Qin, Overseer has already prepared some food. Shall we have a meal with Young Master Wen?” An Sheng said.

Qin Zhen nodded slightly and agreed.

An Tianzuo was somewhat delighted when he saw Qin Zhen agree.

With Qin Zhen’s talent, it was too wasteful for her to teach on campus. After she trained in the military for a few years, she would definitely be a mighty person who could hold her own in the future.

However, he had invited Qin Zhen to join the army several times, but he hadn’t been able to succeed. Now, Qin Zhen had clearly joined the Sunset Army because of Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen hadn’t even said a word, making An Tianzuo very displeased.

However, this didn’t stop him from liking Qin Zhen. He had already thought of how to train her, how to make her truly become a female Sword Immortal on the battlefield, and not just a female Sword Immortal in the arena.

Although both represented excellent combat strength, there were still some differences.

At the dining table, under An Sheng’s guidance, Qin Zhen told them what had happened between her and Zhou Wen. An Tianzuo and An Jing were stunned.

That punk really has good taste. Or was he lucky? He can actually produce a female Sword Immortal with just a crappy notebook? It must be luck. That punk might have only found her pretty... An Tianzuo couldn’t accept that the person he thought highly of was someone Zhou Wen had unintentionally nurtured.

After the meal, An Sheng got someone to take Qin Zhen back, but Zhou Wen stopped him and pulled him to a corner. “It wasn’t easy to find a successor for my sword art. I don’t want to see her die.”

“Young Master Wen, don’t worry. Qin Zhen is talented, but she lacks the baptism of the battlefield. In the future, she will definitely become an existence like a war goddess. Overseer has long made plans for her. He definitely won’t let such a person die in vain.” An Sheng paused before saying, “Furthermore, in this world, with Qin Zhen’s strength, it’s only a matter of time before she enters the battlefield. It’s better to do so earlier rather than later, don’t you think?”

Zhou Wen naturally understood this principle. All he could do was sigh helplessly and say nothing else.

He, too, had no choice. He didn’t know how long he could live.

An Sheng was right. Letting Qin Zhen enter the Sunset Army now, with An Sheng taking care of her and An Tianzuo’s recognition, was better than being forced to participate in a battle in the future.

“Young Master Wen, I realize that there’s something very problematic about you!” An Sheng suddenly sized up Zhou Wen and said in a strange tone. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Zhou Wen felt his hair stand on end from An Sheng’s gaze. “Ah Sheng, don’t spout nonsense. What problem can I have?”
