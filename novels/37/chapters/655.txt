Chapter 656: Blood Oxypetalum

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen attempted to activate the Heart Lunar Fox skill, but there was no reaction.

If this skill really has something to do with the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, could it be that I have to gather all the skills of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions before I can use it? Or could it be that I can use it just by gathering the Azure Dragon’s seven palaces? Zhou Wen was just guessing. Up to now, there was no way to prove the relationship between the two.

As he had nothing to lose, Zhou Wen paid special attention to the Essence Energy Skill Crystal drops when grinding.

After grinding for half the day, he didn’t see any similar Mortal-stage Essence Energy Skills drop.

After respawning the dungeon, Zhou Wen went to the place where he discovered the Heart Lunar Fox, but he didn’t see it again.

Having had the experience of grinding the baby tiger, Zhou Wen knew that such matters couldn’t be forced. Therefore, he didn’t deliberately search for it. He only paid a little attention when grinding low-level monsters, with his main focus on finding Astral Combat Beasts.

After another day, Zhou Wen surprisingly discovered that he had obtained another Azure Dragon Heart Crystal. After absorbing it, he obtained the Room Solar Rabbit Essence Energy Skill.

However, just like the Heart Lunar Fox, the Room Solar Rabbit skill was useless.

It looks like there’s no mistake about the Heart Lunar Fox and the Room Solar Rabbit. It’s really related to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, but why are the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions such low-level dimensional creatures?

Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out the reason, but he paid more attention when grinding.

By the time he returned to the town inside the Funiu Mountain Range, Zhou Wen had obtained some skill crystals related to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions.

Among them, the number of Heart Lunar Foxes and Room Solar Rabbits were the highest. He had three of each, but they couldn’t be taken out, so they were useless.

Furthermore, these skills had no rank. There was no discernment between the same skills in terms of levels. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Zhou Wen had also obtained the skill crystals of the Horn Wood Scaly Dragon, Root Earth Raccoon Dog, Tail Fire Tiger, and Winnowing-basket Water Leopard. These Mortal-stage dimensional creatures were also strange. There were very few of them, but as long as he found them, they would definitely drop skill crystals. Nothing else would drop.

The skill crystals that Zhou Wen had obtained were all from the Azure Dragon seven Lunar Mansions. He had already learned six skills and was only short of the Azure Dragon’s Neck Gold Dragon.

After reaching the small town, Zhou Wen looked at the ranking again and realized that no one had challenged Tyrant Behemoth. It was still ranked fourth.

In front of Tyrant Behemoth, there were still three Companion Beasts—Primordial Sword Immortal, Death of the Underworld, and Fairy Immortal Gu.

Why is no one challenging Primordial Sword Immortal? There should be less than a month left in the three-month deadline, right? Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be the trailblazer. He planned on returning to school first. It wouldn’t be too late for him to come again after someone challenged the Primordial Sword Immortal.

When he reached the town’s entrance, he suddenly heard a sound coming from outside. Using Truth Listener to investigate, he realized that a few people were heading for the town.

Eh... What are they doing here? Zhou Wen realized that Qiao Siyuan and Liz were among the people who had come.

Although they weren’t wearing the Special Inspector Bureau uniform, Zhou Wen had a deep impression of them, so he recognized them at a glance.

The others looked like they were from the bureau as well. Zhou Wen didn’t know why he had such a judgment, but he had a feeling that the people from the bureau seemed to have a special aura. This aura was very rare to find on ordinary people.

It was just like how soldiers could easily be identified. It was the same for the people from the bureau. However, their auras were different from ordinary soldiers.

This was originally a good opportunity to take revenge, but Zhou Wen wanted to figure out their reason for coming here. Therefore, he retreated into the forest and used Truth Listener to monitor their every move.

“Clear the area.” After entering the valley, Qiao Siyuan gave the order. Immediately, people took out various instruments and summoned their Companion Beasts. They began to busy themselves.

Zhou Wen recognized a few Companion Beasts that were probably reconnaissance types. From the looks of it, they wanted to ensure that there were no outsiders here.

With a thought, Zhou Wen sneaked into the lake and hid in the water. Then, he used the Dao Body to converge his aura and blend with the surrounding natural environment.

Qiao Siyuan and company busied themselves for a few hours, taking control of the entire valley. Only when they seemingly confirmed that there was no one else here did they transport quite a number of things from outside the town.

Zhou Wen saw Companion Beasts carrying buckets into the town. He didn’t know what was inside.

“Minister, we have finished counting the items,” Liz reported to Qiao Siyuan.

“Set up a sentry post and split into three shifts to monitor the situation outside. Everyone else, rest immediately,” Qiao Siyuan ordered.

“Yes.” Liz accepted the order and began dividing the group.

When Liz returned to Qiao Siyuan’s side, he had already sat down in a small building.

“Minister, is the Blood Oxypetalum really as magical as the legends say?” Liz poured a cup of tea for Qiao Siyuan and asked curiously.

Qiao Siyuan took a sip of tea and said indifferently, “You should have heard of how instantaneous an oxypetalum blooming is, right?”

“I’ve heard of it, but I heard that it’s just an exaggerated metaphor from the people of the East District. In fact, oxypetalum will bloom for a few hours. It’s not as exaggerated as if it only bloomed for an instant,” Liz said.

Qiao Siyuan nodded. “It’s true that a normal oxypetalum blooming isn’t as exaggerated as being instantaneous, but it’s different if it’s a Blood Oxypetalum.”

After a pause, Qiao Siyuan continued, “To get a Blood Oxypetalum to bloom, one has to pour a large amount of blood. Typical blood isn’t enough. It has to be the blood essence of dimensional creatures. The more blood the Blood Oxypetalum absorbs, the purer it becomes. The flower that blooms will also become more beautiful. Furthermore, it can give birth to a Blood Oxypetalum seed.”

When Zhou Wen heard that, he recalled the ruby he had obtained.

Previously, many white deer had been sacrificed by the mountain god. Only then did a blood flower bloom in the lake, giving birth to a ruby. It sounded like the seed that Qiao Siyuan had mentioned.

If the flower in the lake is really a Blood Oxypetalum, then why did Qiao Siyuan and company come here? Are they planning to offer a blood sacrifice to obtain the Blood Oxypetalum seed? What’s its use? As Zhou Wen was thinking, Liz had already given him an answer.

“Minister, can a Blood Oxypetalum seed really change a person’s bloodline and talent?” Liz asked.

“That’s not something I know. I’ve never used a Blood Oxypetalum seed before, so I can’t make any judgment. However, since the director-general wants to do this, he must have his reasons,” Qiao Siyuan said indifferently.

“Minister, you’re right. The Director-General has put in so much effort this time to specially prepare this blood. If it really succeeds, the seed produced by the Blood Oxypetalum will definitely be extraordinary,” Liz said enviously.
