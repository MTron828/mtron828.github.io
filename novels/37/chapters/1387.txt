Chapter 1388: Jiang Yan’s Plan

The strength of Perfect Sword Immortal was immense. Even the Chaos Egg couldn’t withstand the increasingly powerful sword beam.

As for the petal that looked extremely weak, it didn’t fly very fast. It actually passed through the layers of sword beams and landed on the forehead of Perfect Sword Immortal. This was somewhat unbelievable.

What was even more surprising was that after the petal landed on the forehead of Perfect Sword Immortal, it melted like snowflakes and seeped into his Guardian armor.

In the next second, purplish-red petals appeared over Perfect Sword Immortal’s body. In the blink of an eye, they enveloped his entire body, forming a floral armor.

Fairy Burial!?Zhou Wen immediately widened his eyes.

He never expected Immortal to be Jiang Yan because Immortal’s Guardian wasn’t Fairy Burial.

Previously, he had joined Jiang Yan in his trip to contract his Guardian. How could he not be familiar with it? He recognized it at a glance.

So that’s how it is… It’s no wonder Cave Era wanted to save me… She was actually trying to save Jiang Yan…?Zhou Wen finally understood. He had been puzzled as to why Cave Era would take such a huge risk to save him.

Just because he was her brother’s junior didn’t seem to make sense.

“You… You actually contracted two Guardians…” Perfect Sword Immortal already understood what had happened and knew why the sword beam couldn’t injure the petal.

He used Jiang Yan’s body to fight. In essence, the current Perfect Sword Immortal was actually Jiang Yan.

As for Fairy Burial, it had a contract with Jiang Yan. Furthermore, it wasn’t an ordinary Guardian contract. It was a Life-and-Death contract that went one step further. Jiang Yan’s injuries were equivalent to Fairy Burial being injured. Likewise for the converse. Therefore, Perfect Sword Immortal couldn’t injure Fairy Burial. Otherwise, he would be injuring himself.

Unless he abandoned Jiang Yan’s body, it was impossible for him to injure Fairy Burial. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

That’s not right… What Guardian is this…?Perfect Sword Immortal frowned slightly. The floral armor formed by the Guardian was actually absorbing and devouring his Calamity power.

Perfect Sword Immortal naturally sensed that the floral armor was only at the Terror grade, but for some reason, it could absorb his Calamity-grade power.

Although the absorption speed wasn’t fast, it was very rare to absorb something at a higher level. Perfect Sword Immortal vaguely felt that the power of the floral armor seemed to restrain him.

Under normal circumstances, he would have been able to control the Guardian that Jiang Yan had contracted since he had already occupied Jiang Yan’s body. However, the floral armor rejected him and refused to be under his control.

“Fairy Burial.” Jiang Yan obtained the power of Fairy Burial again and finally regained some control. However, he could only speak. Control over the rest of his body was still in the hands of Perfect Sword Immortal.

“Just this act deserves death. You’ve been hiding and plotting for so long because you want to use its power to devour me?” Perfect Sword Immortal said coldly. “I pity your ignorance. Although I don’t know why this Guardian’s power has a faint restraining effect on me, it’s still too weak. As long as I leave your body, I can easily destroy your body along with it.”

“But do you dare leave my body?” Jiang Yan said indifferently.

Perfect Sword Immortal understood what Jiang Yan meant. Without Jiang Yan’s body as support, he would be ostracized by Earth’s rules. When that happened, his strength would be greatly weakened.

With Zhou Wen near him, he would probably die if he was weakened to the Terror grade. It would be useless even if he destroyed Jiang Yan’s body.

“It doesn’t matter; I can kill you after I’m done with him.” Perfect Sword Immortal turned to look at Zhou Wen.

Fairy Burial’s powers couldn’t deal much damage to him in a short period of time. The power it absorbed was only a tiny portion that didn’t affect his combat strength much.

All Perfect Sword Immortal needed to do was stick to his original plan and kill Zhou Wen before leaving Jiang Yan’s body to kill Jiang Yan and Fairy Burial.

However, Perfect Sword Immortal was still somewhat puzzled as to why Jiang Yan could contract two Guardians. In theory, an individual shouldn’t be able to contract two Guardians. Furthermore, Guardians wouldn’t be willing to share their contractors with other Guardians.

This was because Guardians were natural enemies with each other. They had been created to defeat each other. Guardians of different species shouldn’t be able to contract with the same person.

“Jiang Yan, what other plans do you have? Quick, tell me,” Zhou Wen shouted at Jiang Yan.

Since Jiang Yan had set up such a trap, there was likely a way to deal with Perfect Sword Immortal.

“My plan was for you to hold him back while I absorb his strength,” Jiang Yan said.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback before he flew into a rage. “F*ck you. Are you human? You call this a f*cking plan?”

“Don’t be anxious. That’s just Plan A. I still have Plan B.” Jiang Yan added.

“How can you still be in the mood to joke at a time like this? Quick, tell me,” Zhou Wen felt a little relieved as he retreated with Cave Era.

“Plan B is for you to severely injure Perfect Sword Immortal. This way, my absorption will be faster and the danger will be resolved faster,” Jiang Yan said.

“Are you really speaking anything human?” Zhou Wen’s face darkened.

“Don’t feel so inferior. You have to have confidence in yourself. I’m very confident in you. Work hard and kill him. Also, protect my sister.” Jiang Yan’s tone was very relaxed, as though Perfect Sword Immortal was some random character that could be killed with a single strike.

“Are you done?” Perfect Sword Immortal’s voice seemed to emit a cold aura. It was obvious how furious he was.

Jiang Yan didn’t think much of him. He actually said that he wanted Zhou Wen to kill him.

“Should I say that you are optimistic or ignorant? Humans can’t even leave Earth. From the looks of it, it’s not without reason.” As Perfect Sword Immortal spoke, the sword beams on his body erupted like the sun again in a bid to kill Zhou Wen.

“Enter this.” Zhou Wen extended his hand and pulled Cave Era. Cave Era didn’t resist this time as she was pulled into the Chaos Bead by Zhou Wen.

Almost at the same time, the Chaos Egg enveloped Zhou Wen’s body.

Boom!

The omnipresent sword beams struck the Chaos Egg, instantly filling it up. Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to transfer it to Tyrant Behemoth as the continuous sword beams stabbed a few spots into the Chaos Egg.

In the blink of an eye, the Chaos Egg was about to become a porcupine.

Inside the Chaos Egg that was riddled with holes, solid Essence Energy immediately vaporized when it encountered the outside air, turning into white Essence Energy that spewed out.

Zhou Wen saw the sword beams penetrate the Chaos Egg and knew that it was difficult to dodge them. However, he was still a little short of breaking through the final barrier needed to advance to the Terror grade.

What am I short of??More and more sword beams appeared in front of Zhou Wen as some of them nearly stabbed him in the face.

“Die!” Perfect Sword Immortal squeezed out the last bit of his strength, hoping to kill Zhou Wen as quickly as possible.

The blazing sword beam seemed to devour the entire world, destroying everything around it. Even dust particles were sliced apart by the sword beam.
