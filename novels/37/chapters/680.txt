Chapter 681: Treasure Chest in a Maze

According to An Sheng, he and An Tianzuo had accidentally fallen into a mysterious dimensional zone. It was like a maze. Furthermore, there were many treasure chests in the maze. Opening the treasure chest could give them Companion Eggs, dimensional crystals, or strange objects. It was also possible not to receive anything.

An Tianzuo’s first Mythical Companion Egg was obtained from there. However, one person could only open three treasure chests in the maze.

An Sheng’s luck wasn’t too good. He opened three treasure chests, but he didn’t obtain any Mythical Companion Eggs. However, it wasn’t as though he didn’t get anything.

In the maze, An Sheng obtained a mysterious pill from a treasure chest. After using it, his physique underwent some changes. In the past, An Sheng had told Zhou Wen that he was especially sensitive to Spirit Bodies. It was thanks to the mysterious pill.

“In this era, there’s really nothing out of the ordinary. To think that there’s actually such a good place. There are countless strange dimensional zones around the world. I wonder how many people have obtained fortuitous encounters. The fortuitous encounters of wuxia novels in the past are too common in this era,” Zhou Wen said wistfully.

However, Zhou Wen had a slight advantage. Other people’s fortuitous encounters were life-threatening. As for him, all he needed to do was download the dungeon and slowly encounter them. He was bound to encounter one.

Other people’s fortuitous encounters could be deemed as Heaven selecting them, but the mysterious phone made Heaven’s selection inevitable.

“The world is changing, and humans are changing as well. It’s the same for the Federation. However, no matter how the world changes, there’s one thing that won’t change,” An Sheng said.

“What?” Zhou Wen really couldn’t think of anything in this world that wouldn’t change.

“The winner is king,” An Sheng said seriously.

Zhou Wen was taken aback. This didn’t sound like An Sheng’s style. He imagined that An Sheng would say something about family.

An Sheng smiled and said, “Let’s talk about the maze. The maze itself changes automatically. To walk out of it, one needs to understand the Book of Changes and Chinese divination. Last time, we found a total of twelve treasure chests when Overseer took me through the maze. We opened six and left the remaining six for Madam and Miss Jing. However, in the maze, one needs the strength of an Epic to survive. Miss Jing hasn’t had the chance to go. Madam has been investigating Mr. Ouyang’s matter, so she hasn’t had the time to go either. Now, she’s investigating Chu He. I reckon she won’t be going. Why not use the White Elephant to exchange for a chance to enter and try your luck?”

“Since this is Sis Lan’s chance, it’s not nice of me to exchange for it, right?” Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant.

“There’s nothing wrong with it. The treasure chests have at best Mythical Companion Eggs. If you’re unlucky, there might be nothing. It’s very reasonable for you to exchange a Mythical Companion Egg for an opportunity. Besides, if Madam isn’t going, having you take this opportunity is better than letting others benefit,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen thought that it made sense. Since Sis Lan wasn’t going, it was fair for him to use the White Elephant Companion Egg to exchange for this opportunity. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.

“After the matter at Dragon Gate Grotto is resolved, I’ll take you there. That place isn’t in Luoyang. Besides, before you go, you have to remember the maze’s possible path changes. I’ll give you the map of the maze later,” An Sheng said with a smile.

After An Sheng left, Zhou Wen continued grinding dungeons.

He got nothing from entering Dragon Gate Grotto and grinding the baby tiger. Zhou Wen was already numb with disappointment.

Why doesn’t the dungeon in-game change as well? If the game dungeons can intrinsically change, I can try cracking the golden light’s secret in-game, Zhou Wen thought greedily.

Ding!

When Zhou Wen was grinding the Endless Sea of Stars, an Essence Energy Skill Crystal dropped. On careful look, it was the Neck Gold Dragon Essence Energy Skill he had been looking forward to.

It finally dropped! Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He had been grinding for many days. He had already obtained quite a number of the other six palaces of the Azure Dragon’s seven palaces, but only the Neck Gold Dragon eluded him. He had finally fulfilled his wish today.

After impatiently absorbing the Essence Energy Skill Crystal, Zhou Wen felt another nail-like Essence Energy acupoint appear on his body. When the Essence Energy acupoint formed, the other six Essence Energy acupoints that were like dead acupoints suddenly came to life. They formed an Essence Energy circulation between the seven Essence Energy acupoints.

Horn, neck, root, room, heart, tail, winnowing basket. The seven palaces were identical to the shape of a dragon. The horn was the horn of a dragon, and the neck was a dragon’s neck. Root was the stem of the neck. Room corresponded to the arms, the heart was the heart, and the winnowing basket was the tail.

Essence Energy flowed through the seven Essence Energy points like an Azure Dragon. Zhou Wen could even hear the Azure Dragon’s long roar.

Zhou Wen looked at his stats in-game and realized that the seven Essence Energy Skills had vanished, turning into an Essence Energy Skill.

Eastern Azure Dragon Seven Lunar Mansions (Mortal): Horn Wood Scaly Dragon, Neck Gold Dragon, Root Earth Raccoon Dog, Room Solar Rabbit, Heart Lunar Fox, Tail Fire Tiger, and Winnowing-basket Water Leopard.

Zhou Wen saw that the Essence Energy Skill was still at the Mortal stage, having not leveled up just because of the fusion of seven skills. However, the Essence Energy Skills that he couldn’t use previously could now be used.

He attempted to use the skill of the Azure Dragon’s Seven Lunar Mansions in-game. The Essence Energy in his body surged and transformed into an invisible force that coiled around his body, protecting him.

This feels a little similar to the Lotus Flower Buddha Body’s functions. They are all protective Essence Energy Skills, but they seem much weaker than the Lotus Flower Buddha Body. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be in a dilemma. He hadn’t used the Lotus Flower Buddha Body for a long time because it wasn’t strong enough.

Now, the Eastern Azure Dragon’s Seven Lunar Mansions was only at the Mortal stage, so the effects were even weaker.

When Zhou Wen used it, he realized that the Azure Dragon Seven Nights could transform into the seven different forms—Heart Lunar Fox, Room Solar Rabbit, and so on. But he didn’t notice anything special.

After grinding for so long, it’s only a protective Essence Energy Skill? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. With an Essence Energy Skill named after the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions and one that was so difficult to grind, it shouldn’t be so weak.

Should I try gathering the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions Essence Energy Skill and give it a try? Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to give up. He decided to grind the other Lunar Mansion skills if he had the time.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on deliberately grinding them any further. It was just that he would farm them if he saw them during his search for Astral Combat Beasts. It was best if he could gather all of them but it was not necessary.

He controlled the blood-colored avatar to constantly search for Astral Combat Beasts in the endless sea of stars. After heading to other stellar zones, he indeed obtained other Lunar Mansion skills.

After grinding for some time, Zhou Wen realized the pattern.

In the four Lunar Mansion regions of north, south, east, and west, every Lunar Mansion region had one Essence Energy Skill that was especially difficult to obtain. Furthermore, one couldn’t use it unless one gathered all seven Essence Energy Skills.

Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise are in the four Lunar Mansion zones. I wonder what effects they will have if I gather all of them. It was only a passing thought for Zhou Wen; he didn’t deliberately complete the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions.
