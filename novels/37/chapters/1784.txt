Chapter 1785 New World’s Strength

After the dust settled, the pupils of the people staring at the scene suddenly constricted, and their eyes involuntarily widened.

Transcendent Immortal slowly walked out of the temple. Her armor was still as bright as new, and her face was flawless. It even had a lustrous glow, making it impossible to tell that she was injured. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

It was as if Zhou Wen’s violent attacks had nothing to do with her.

“It’s fake, right? She’s not even injured?” Someone couldn’t believe it and consoled himself.

“How strong is Transcendent Immortal’s physique to not be injured?” Someone had a look of despair.

Professor Gu analyzed the situation with a look of disappointment. “From the current situation, Transcendent Immortal has an incomparable self-healing ability. The damage Zhou Wen inflicted on her isn’t as fast as her self-healing speed. I’m afraid there will be a tough battle ahead.”

As people discussed, Transcendent Immortal finally walked out of the temple. She stared at Zhou Wen and slowly said, “Do you know the real difference between an Apocalypse and a Calamity?”

“It’s just possessing the New World,” Zhou Wen said.

“I didn’t expect you to know about the New World.” Transcendent Immortal’s eyes were cold as she stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “That’s right. The difference between the Apocalypse grade and a Calamity grade is whether one has a New World. However, do you know what a New World is?”

The people watching pricked up their ears. The Apocalypse grade was too distant for humans. No human knew what kind of realm it was. It was better to hear something than not know anything. “It’s just a form of strength,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

“It’s just a form of power? What a bold claim. The ignorant are fearless. A so-called calamity is just a disaster. The world will still be the same after the disaster. However, an apocalypse is different. It’s the power to destroy the old world and establish a new world. It’s the rebuilding of order, the creation of a ruler, and a supreme existence that controls everything.” As her tone gradually became fanatical, the armor on Transcendent Immortal’s body fluttered as if an invisible force was surging out like a volcanic eruption.

......

Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly because he could sense that the power of the Human Realm domain had lost its binding effect on Transcendent Immortal.

No! Not only was it no longer having a restraining effect, but the entire Human Realm domain was also being destroyed. It quickly collapsed like a rotten palace.

“Everything under the Apocalypse is illusory. Things like Calamity are nothing but dust in my eyes. The old order shall be destroyed, and a new world that belongs to me will be established. You can’t really hurt me, but I can easily destroy the power you’re proud of.” Transcendent Immortal slowly raised her finger and pointed at Zhou Wen as she continued, “You are ultimately nothing but an insignificant speck of dust.”

With that said, a beam of light instantly passed through space-time and landed on Zhou Wen’s forehead, instantly penetrating him.

Upon seeing this, everyone felt like they had fallen into an ice cavern.

In their opinion, Transcendent Immortal had actually not used her true strength in the life-and-death battle. She was just playing. Transcendent Immortal—who had now shown the power of the New World—was like a genuine god. It made one unable to have the courage to fight her, leaving only deep despair and fear.

“Without entering the Apocalypse grade… you will ultimately be nothing but dust…” The words didn’t kill, but they threw people to the depths of hell.

Apocalypse… How can there be an apocalypse in the human world?

“So what if it’s dust? To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower. Even a grain of sand can be in thousands of forms. If you don’t even know this, it seems like the dimension’s Apocalypse grade is just this and nothing much.” A refreshing voice suddenly appeared, but it seemed to jolt the self-pitying people awake.

People suddenly looked up at the scene and were pleasantly surprised to discover that Zhou Wen-who they originally thought had his head blown off by Transcendent Immortal’s finger-had appeared behind Transcendent Immortal at some point in time. His figure had leaped up high, and his right arm stretched back to its limits like a drawn bow. His fist shot out like an arrow.

The ‘Zhou Wen’ that had previously been penetrated by Transcendent Immortal’s finger had already dissipated like smoke. It was only an avatar.

Bang!

The fist struck the back of Transcendent Immortal’s head, causing her body to fall forward and roll hundreds of meters away before stopping

Transcendent Immortal remained uninjured, but her expression turned extremely nasty.

It could be said that she had been playing when she was beaten up by Zhou Wen. She hadn’t used her true strength at all.

However, it was completely different this time. Although she wasn’t injured, it embarrassed her.

“Haha, stop being a poser? New World? Old World? He’ll torture you to death equally well.” Li Xuan laughed loudly.

“As expected of Coach. I need to take note.” Feng Qiuyan thoughtfully opened up his small notebook and wrote something on it.

“Coach might not be as strong as Transcendent Immortal, but his skills and realm are definitely superior,” Ming Xiu praised.

This punch swept away the previous gloominess, and it also made Ouyang Lanwho was watching the battle in front of the Cube-exhale.

Transcendent Immortal floated up, and the dust on her armor automatically dissipated. She returned to her lofty deity-like appearance from her disheveled appearance.

But this time, people didn’t look at her with the same reverence and fear as before.

As she looked at Zhou Wen, Transcendent Immortal’s eyes were filled with bewilderment.

In her New World, a Calamity grade should’ve completely lost their ability to use orderly powers, but Zhou Wen was completely unaffected. She had never encountered such a situation.

How could Transcendent Immortal know that Zhou Wen wasn’t an ordinary Calamity grade?

Eight types of Calamity Zones had combined into one, helping the Lost Immortal Sutra break through to the Calamity grade. How could the resulting Human Realm domain be an ordinary Calamity Zone?

Although the Human Realm domain couldn’t resist the New World’s power head-on, the New World’s power couldn’t completely destroy it.

At this moment, Zhou Wen had completely restrained the Human Realm domain and fused it with his body. He still maintained the circulation of his strength in Transcendent Immortal’s New World.

“Interesting.” Transcendent Immortal suppressed the anger in her heart and pretended to be calm as she looked at Zhou Wen. “You do have some redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, in the face of absolute strength, all techniques are nothing but a clown’s tricks. Even if I stand here and let you use all your techniques, you won’t be able to harm me at all.”

“Not necessarily.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he slowly drew his two swords. At the same time, his body underwent a strange change.

A mystic crystal-like armor quickly covered Zhou Wen’s body. It was black like an abyss as if it could absorb all light. The armor that tightly wrapped around his muscles outlined his slender and muscular body like a god emperor.

“That’s… Human Sovereign… Zhou Wen is Human Sovereign…” Su Yi’s expression went from confusion to shock, then to pleasant surprise, then to utter alarm. Finally, she screamed, and her voice echoed in the ears of all the humans watching the live broadcast. It was deafening.
