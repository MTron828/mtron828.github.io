Chapter 1046: Humans Are Not the Protagonists

Translator: CKtalon

“Ice Maiden, is that a Terror Creature?” Zhou Wen asked Ice Maiden.

“Yes, but it’s a little different from the dimension’s Terror creatures. It should be a Terror-grade creature born on Earth,” Ice Maiden said.

“Are you confident?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I’d be confident if I had the Heaven Shrouding Bell in hand,” Ice Maiden said expressionlessly.

“Let’s go.” Zhou Wen turned around and left, dispelling his desire to fight.

The Heaven Shrouding Bell had already fused with Demonic Neonate. He couldn’t even take it back, much less return it to Ice Maiden.

Furthermore, there wasn’t much time left. He had to get Medusa to admit defeat when he returned. Otherwise, the two Companion Beasts would be eliminated. After this matter was settled, he would study the fox.

Ice Maiden didn’t wish to return to the Chaos Bead again, so she followed Zhou Wen and company back to the town.

Seeing that the countdown was almost up, Zhou Wen was considering which Companion Beast to send to stall for another two hours.

As Zhou Wen thought about it, everyone in the world guessed what the next Companion Beast would be.

Even the six families and overseas devils were studying Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts. At the same time, they were guessing who the owner of these Companion Beasts was.

This was because other than the Golden Battle God Halberd, Medusa, and the Invisibility Cloak, few people had seen the other Companion Beasts, much less know of their abilities.

However, having so many Companion Beasts gathered in the hands of one person or faction was a very terrifying matter. It was worth their attention. They also secretly guessed who had these Companion Beasts.

Unfortunately, none of the Companion Beasts fought after they entered the arena. They had no chance of studying them.

As everyone waited, Medusa also admitted defeat and left. A new round of challenges began.

When the time allocated to the challenges ended, a Companion Beast named Ancient Splitting Tadpole appeared on the cube’s arena. Everyone looked at each other because no one had seen such a Companion Beast before, much less know what abilities it had.

“Who knows which district the Ancient Splitting Tadpole belongs to?” the chief editor of the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau asked as he scanned the entire studio.

Everyone looked at each other. They couldn’t even tell which district the Companion Beast came from.

“Investigate. Investigate immediately. Think of all ways. No matter what, we have to investigate the origins of the Ancient Splitting Tadpole before our competitors,” the chief editor said fiercely.

It wasn’t just the Freedom Investigation Bureau. In fact, the various families were trying to investigate the origins of the Ancient Splitting Tadpole. All sorts of intelligence agencies began working hard. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, a place like the Valley of No Return was somewhere even the locals of the South District didn’t dare approach. Not many people knew that there were Splitting Tadpoles inside, much less a Mythical Ancient Splitting Tadpole.

Some people who had entered the Valley of No Return and were lucky enough to come out alive had seen the typical Splitting Tadpole, but the typical Splitting Tadpole was very different from Zhou Wen’s.

In the end, it was a news reporter from the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau stationed in the South District. He remembered seeing a photo of a Mythical Ancient Splitting Tadpole in a native’s home.

The reporter hurriedly ran over and realized that the dimensional creature in the photo was indeed identical to the Ancient Splitting Tadpole. After repeated questioning, he learned the origins of the photo.

In less than an hour, the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau once again reported the origins of the Ancient Splitting Tadpole.

“Holy sh*t, a Mythical Companion Beast from a place like the Valley of No Return...” People who knew about the Valley of No Return gasped when they saw the report.

“This time, it’s another Companion Beast from the South District. Now, I can confirm that the person with these Companion Beasts is definitely from a large faction. It’s impossible for a person to do it alone. How can a person have so much time and energy to go to so many places and hunt so many Mythical Companion Beasts?”

“I think it’s highly likely that one of the six families is behind the scenes. How can a family clan have such immense strength to cross different districts to hunt Mythical creatures?”

Now, everyone was extremely interested in these Companion Beasts. They no longer had their previous contempt.

As for the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau, they also published an article, “If these Companion Beasts belong to the same person”. The article proposed a hypothesis. If these Companion Beasts belonged to the same human, what would happen if this human participated in the ranking battle.

This article didn’t provide a conclusion, but it did a lot of analysis.

The so-called Guardians were actually at the Mythical stage, but they were slightly stronger than the typical Mythical creature. Typical Mythical Companion Beasts weren’t their match.

As for the owners of Guardians, they also had Mythical Companion Beasts. If a single Mythical Companion Beast were to challenge them, there was almost no chance of winning.

But what if it was a human with a large number of Mythical Companion Beasts?

Invisibility Cloak, Golden Battle God Halberd, five Demon Blood True Dragons, Medusa, and Ancient Splitting Tadpole. There were already nine Mythical Companion Beasts in battle, and there might even be more.

If such a human participated in the battle and he didn’t contract a Guardian, could he defeat a human with a Guardian?

This article immediately sparked global attention, turning the originally tense ranking battle into a discussion.

“In theory, with the Invisibility Cloak, one can guarantee their safety. There are also a large number of Mythical Companion Beasts. If one swarms a Guardian with a sea of pets, the Guardian will also be defeated.”

“Such a strategy is useless. Guardians have absolute strength to suppress them. Furthermore, the owner of the Guardian also has Mythical Companion Beasts.”

“I think there’s a chance of defeating a Guardian. The premise is that these Companion Beasts belong to the same person.”

“This problem isn’t valid at all. Without a Guardian, humans won’t be able to reach the Mythical stage. There’s no possibility of them entering the ranking battle.”

At the end of the discussion, everyone realized that it was indeed meaningless. Without a Guardian, it was impossible for humans to participate in the battle. Even if the Companion Beasts belonged to the same person, it was useless.

This made everyone realize that the ranking battle was actually still dominated by the dimension. Humans were just auxiliary to the battle, not the protagonists.

I really want to see real humans participate in the battle and not the companions of those Guardians! Many people had this thought.

Unfortunately, humans were unable to advance to the Mythical stage. This was an indisputable fact. It was impossible to see pure humans participate in the battle.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it. With nothing to do, he was grinding dungeons. When he was almost done grinding the other dungeons, Zhou Wen went to the Maze of Lies on Sunday, hoping to see if he could kill the twin witches.

To his surprise, after entering the Maze of Lies, he discovered that the Devil Clown had respawned. After killing the Devil Clown, he heard a ding and a Companion Egg dropped.

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He had been grinding for a long time without any Mythical Companion Eggs dropping. Today, a Demon Blood True Dragon and a Devil Clown had dropped one after another.
