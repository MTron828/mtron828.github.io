Chapter 1517 Battling Berserker Immortal

The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation is about to be torn apart! Zhou Wen watched as the terrifying sword beams filled the entire Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. Even though the space in the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation could loop, there was limited space. The other party’s sword beams were so powerful that they could fill all space. It was only a matter of time before the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was torn apart.

“Where did this fellow come from? He’s terrifying!” Li Xuan’s injuries rapidly healed. He had mostly recovered, but he still felt alarmed.

If Zhou Wen had been any slower, his self-healing ability wouldn’t have been of any use.

“Thankfully, you made him expose his true strength ahead of time and gave us time to prepare. Now, we can think of a solution. Otherwise, the consequences will be unpredictable.” Zhou Wen sincerely felt that Li Xuan had done a good job.

If Li Xuan hadn’t forced Berserker Immortal to such an extent that gave Zhou Wen a chance to understand his abilities and even set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation ahead of time, the consequences would have been unimaginable. If Zhou Wen had really fought Berserker Immortal himself, once the latter suddenly used such strength, few nearby humans would survive even if Zhou Wen could dodge the attack.

“Hehe, I may not be many things, but when it comes to taking a beating, no one can be better than me,” Li Xuan said smugly.

“Stop bragging. Disperse the crowd. My Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation won’t last long,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.

The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was on the brink of collapse. Blood-like sword beams constantly surged out from the cracked array. Everything that touched the blood-colored sword beams—be it plants or rocks—was instantly dyed red before exploding.

Zhou Wen knew very well that the objects weren’t really dyed red. It was a result of the blood sword beams being too tiny. They could directly drill into objects and destroy them at the fundamental particle level, producing such a visual effect.

Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and company evacuated the crowd. Without waiting for the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation to completely shatter, Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and transformed it into a golden beam that slashed at Berserker Immortal in the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.

Berserker Immortal had already seen the might of the Golden Wyrm Scissors. When he saw it flash over, he immediately pointed at it with his finger, producing a sword art.

Following his finger were blood sword beams that surged like a tidal wave towards the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

Ding!

The vibrational sounds produced by the collision went on and on. The tiny, neutrino-like, blood sword beams constantly struck the Golden Wyrm Scissors but failed to penetrate it.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors went against the tide as the scissors opened up. Like scissors cutting through red cloth, it tore a hole through the blood sword beams and slashed at Berserker Immortal like a hot knife through butter. Berserker Immortal was slightly surprised. He had already unleashed his Hell-level strength, but he was still unable to block the Golden Wyrm Scissors. All he could do was quickly duck.

Meanwhile, the four immortals were already in terrible shape. Parts of their ancient corpse bodies had been destroyed by Berserker Immortal’s sword beams, while other parts were crumbling after being forced to unleash immense strength way beyond the limits of the body.

Bang!

At the instant Berserker Immortal dodged the Golden Wyrm Scissors, he heard a gunshot. A bullet was aimed at his face, going straight for his head.

However, the bullet was shattered by the blood sword beams before it reached Berserker Immortal.

Zhou Wen mounted the sniper rifle on a collapsed wall and shot in Berserker Immortal’s direction six times, but the six bullets were shattered by the blood sword beams. They couldn’t approach him at all.

Instead, the might of Berserker Immortal’s blood sword beams increased greatly, tearing apart the originally tottering Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. Blood sword beams that blotted out the sky rushed out like a sea of blood that enveloped the world.

The four immortals rushed out as well, but most of their ancient corpses had been destroyed, forcing them to be suppressed by the rules of Earth. Their bodies trembled as they moaned in pain. It was as though invisible chains were strangling them, making it difficult for them to move. Their throats emitted strange sounds as though they were about to stop breathing.

Zhou Wen could clearly sense that their powerful auras were rapidly weakening.

These fellows are from the dimension! Zhou Wen immediately understood that they weren’t Earthlings. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have suffered such severe rejection and pressure.

Although the four immortals suffered immense pressure, the pressure wasn’t enough to take their lives. It only constantly dropped their level in life.

They, who were originally at the Hell level, had fallen to the Calamity grade in just moments. Now, they only had strength at the Terror grade, and it was still dropping.

On the contrary, Berserker Immortal’s blood sword beams became more and more terrifying. The ancient corpse’s body cracked like a withered field, but it didn’t truly crumble.

Berserker Immortal didn’t waste any time on the Golden Wyrm Scissors. As he dodged the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attacks, he controlled the blood sword beams that filled the sky to sweep towards Zhou Wen from all directions. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The blood sword beams were just too terrifying—they were almost everywhere. They enveloped most of Guide City. The roofs of skyscrapers were the first to come into contact with the sword beam before being wrecked.

The buildings began to turn red from the top before exploding. The blood-like sword beams constantly pressed down as though the end of the world was approaching.

People screamed and cried, or they tried their best to escape, but under such terrifying power, ordinary people couldn’t escape at all. They could only wait for death to arrive.

Zhou Wen could escape, but if he did, the hundreds of thousands of people in Guide City would be instantly killed. Even the entire city would be completely destroyed, leaving nothing behind.

Zhou Wen held his sniper rifle and continued aiming at Berserker Immortal, ignoring the blood sword beams that filled the sky.

Bang!

The seventh gunshot sounded as a bullet shot out from the chamber, piercing through the blood sword beams like a beam of light.

The sure-kill seventh shot was a sure-kill bullet that used all the Golden Sniper’s strength. The bullet shuttled through the blood sword beams crazily. It wasn’t shattered by them like the first six bullets.

This bullet needed to see blood. It charged through the blood sword beams alone, but the blood sword beams were just too powerful as they struck it, dropping its speed until it almost stopped.

Hum!

The Golden Wyrm Scissors flew over and tore through space in front of the bullet as it charged at Berserker Immortal.

The bullet shot at Berserker Immortal at the speed of light using the space torn by the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

Berserker Immortal warped into the distance and dodged the Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attack. As for the sure-kill seventh bullet, it automatically made a turn and continued pursuing Berserker Immortal.

“The seventh bullet in the Venusian dimensional zone might be fatal to others, but to me, such strength is still too weak.” Berserker Immortal recognized the origins of the seventh bullet. He clamped the bullet between his fingers the instant the bullet reached him.

The bullet spun between his fingers like a drill, but it couldn’t advance even an inch.
