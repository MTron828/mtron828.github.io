Chapter 1262: Past, Future, Present

The time flow in the Chaos Hut wasn’t too high; it didn’t cause the blood-colored avatar to die immediately at the very least.

As he didn’t know the exact speed of the time flow, Zhou Wen didn’t dare waste any time. He held the golden double guns in his hand and shot at Spacetime Piglet.

Spacetime Piglet immediately reacted as it stared at the blood-colored avatar with widened eyes. Something strange happened. The golden bullets seemed to have a spell cast upon them as they became extremely slow, as though one could pick the golden bullets from midair at any time.

What a powerful spatial skill. Is this the legendary spatial extension??Zhou Wen was somewhat pleasantly surprised. The Spatial Piglet was only at the Mythical stage and already had a certain influence on Terror-grade bullets. This meant that this skill was indeed very powerful.

Unfortunately, the Mythical stage was ultimately limited. Even though it could slow down the bullets, it still couldn’t see where they were. Soon, it was blasted apart by Zhou Wen’s random shots.

What depressed Zhou Wen was that the Spacetime Piglet only dropped an Essence Energy crystal on his first kill. After that, there was nothing.

Thankfully, he could respawn in the Time Hut dungeon without limitations. If it couldn’t be done once, he just needed to pile on more attempts. The only uncertain matter was how long it would take for the Spacetime Piglet to respawn.

Not wanting to waste the dungeon attempt, Zhou Wen turned around and left the Chaos Hut. He looked at the remaining three huts and hesitated over which one to enter.

Although the mortality rate of the Chaos Hut was very high, there was still a chance of survival. As for the people who entered the other three huts, there were no survivors. Occasionally, someone would come out alive. The descriptions of the other three huts varied, making it difficult to tell the authenticity.

The path to the future ultimately depends on myself. It’s in my hands now. The only thing that can’t be changed is the past. I’ll enter the Past Hut and see what’s inside.

?After Zhou Wen thought about it, he pushed open the wooden door and walked into the Past Hut.

At the instant he entered the hut, Zhou Wen realized that he had appeared in an area with terrifyingly high-temperature lava. Thankfully, the blood-colored avatar was wearing the Dragon King armor, so the magma at this level didn’t injure him.

However, in the next second, a huge object suddenly appeared in the lava. It opened its mouth and attempted to devour Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen hurriedly teleported upwards and dodged the behemoth’s devouring attempt.

Standing in midair, Zhou Wen realized that he was surrounded by lava and volcanoes. He didn’t know where he was, but in the lava river below, there was a human with a dragon tail. His head was neither human nor dragon. He had dragon horns on his head, but his face looked like a huge human monster. He held a black flaming fork and stood in the lava, staring at him.

This was the monster that wanted to devour the blood-colored avatar. Seeing Zhou Wen appear in midair, the monster raised the flaming fork in its hand. The entire world immediately turned into a sea of flames as red flames rose up like a tsunami.

Zhou Wen used the two golden guns to shoot at the monster. At the same time, he quickly retreated to dodge the monster’s attack.

However, the speed of the flames was even more terrifying than Zhou Wen imagined. It instantly drowned the entire world. Even though the blood-colored avatar used teleportation, the screen went black when it phased out of the teleportation. The game ended with death.

The battle had been too intense. Only then did Zhou Wen see the warning window in-game. It repeatedly indicated Danger! Danger! Danger!

That thing is definitely at the Calamity grade. Furthermore, why does his appearance look a little familiar? I seem to have seen it somewhere.?Zhou Wen had definitely never seen such a powerful dimensional creature before, or he wouldn’t have forgotten it.

This sense of familiarity was most likely because he had seen something similar somewhere. Therefore, Zhou Wen carefully recalled and finally remembered where he had seen such a creature.

It wasn’t a creature from reality, but from the information Zhou Wen had garnered from the Fire God Platform.

There was actually more than one fire god in Eastern mythology. There were many different fire gods in different legends. The terrifying creature he had seen was very similar to the Fire God Zhurong who had defeated the Water God Gonggong.

Gonggong had knocked down Mt. Buzhou, causing the world to collapse. It was obvious how terrifying his strength was. Yet, the Fire God, Zhurong, could defeat him. His divine might was even stronger.

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that the monster he had encountered resembled the mythical Fire God, Zhurong.

This is the West District, and the dungeon is also a West District dungeon. It’s impossible for there to be a mythical figure from the East District here, right? It probably just resembles one. However, there’s actually a Calamity-grade creature in the Time Hut dungeon. This doesn’t make sense. How can there be such a powerful creature??Zhou Wen felt that it was too much.

He had never seen many dungeons with Calamity-grade creatures.

Even the Venusian dungeon was an elite dungeon of a planet. There seemed to be only one Calamity-grade in it. It was odd that there was a Calamity-grade creature in this tiny Time Hut.

Dripping a drop of blood to revive, Zhou Wen entered the Time Hut dungeon again. This time, his luck wasn’t bad—he didn’t die instantly. He rushed into the Chaos Hut, but didn’t see the Spacetime Piglet. From the looks of it, it wouldn’t respawn so quickly. Typical Mythical creatures only respawned once every twenty-four hours.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and went to the Future Hut.

Zhou Wen had already made sufficient preparations, but after entering the Future Hut, he was somewhat dumbfounded. Before he could see anything, his phone screen went black.

How did I die??Zhou Wen frowned inwardly, but he quickly realized that something was amiss. He wasn’t dead. The blood-colored avatar’s senses were still present, but there was absolute darkness around him. He couldn’t see or sense anything. It looked like his phone screen was completely black as though he was dead.

Zhou Wen used the power of Human Sovereign to illuminate his surroundings. Just as light suffused his body, his phone screen went black again.

This time, he was really dead. As for Zhou Wen, he had no idea what had happened.

What’s going on??Zhou Wen originally imagined that dying in the Past Hut was depressing enough, but he never expected the Future Hut to be even more unacceptable. He had no idea how he died.

Gritting his teeth, he entered the dungeon again. This time, Zhou Wen’s luck wasn’t that good. He dripped his blood and revived five times before finally arriving in front of the Present Hut. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhou Wen had already seen the Past Hut and the Future Hut. All that was left was the Present Hut. It was a perfect opportunity to enter and see what was inside.

Pushing open the door and walking into the hut, Zhou Wen was already fully prepared to withstand any terrifying attack, but nothing happened.

What he saw was still the wooden hut. The wooden table, wooden chair, wooden bed, and wooden horse were identical to the first time Zhou Wen entered the Time Hut.

There was no Spacetime Piglet here, no terrifying creature from the Past Hut, nor was there the strange darkness of the Future Hut. Even the flow of time was normal, and the blood-colored avatar showed no signs of aging.
