Chapter 547 Three Heads and Six Arms

The tiny beast originally wanted to launch a sneak attack on Zhou Wen, but after discovering the item that resembled a metal walnut, it gave up. It sprawled on the metal walnut and gnawed at it.

Zhou Wen saw that its teeth were already creating sparks from gnawing on the metal, but it couldn’t tear the outer shell of the metal walnut apart.

This fellow definitely knows something valuable when it sees it. Could it be that the metal walnut is really something good? After studying it for a period of time, Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure out what the metal walnut was. He thought it was a special metal and planned on finding an opportunity to melt it into a saber or something.

But now, looking at how the little beast wanted to eat the metal walnut, Zhou Wen felt that the walnut wasn’t just as simple as a piece of metal.

The tiny beast was good at replicating, and it had definitely seen a lot of treasures. Moreover, it knew how to hide underground. What kind of metal could it not find underground? It definitely didn’t want to eat the metal on the metal walnut’s surface. It was very likely that there was something inside the metal walnut which had made it forget about revenge.

With its cautious personality, it actually dared to cause such a commotion under Zhou Wen’s bed. Clearly, the item in the metal walnut was extremely attractive to it, making it lose its rationality.

Zhou Wen turned over and got off the bed. He lifted the bedsheets and looked inside. He saw that the tiny beast was still chewing on the metal walnut. It was as though it had been possessed. It didn’t even seem to notice that Zhou Wen was looking at it as it continued gnawing.

Zhou Wen reached out and picked it up.

However, the tiny beast’s four paws had the metal walnut in a firm grip. No matter how hard Zhou Wen pulled, it wouldn’t budge. When he pulled out the metal walnut, the tiny beast came out with it, its paws still on the walnut.

From the looks of it, what’s inside this metal walnut is no trifling matter. Zhou Wen released his hand. The tiny beast didn’t run, instead, it sprawled on the metal walnut and continued gnawing.

This fellow sure is greedy. Zhou Wen shook his head. Humans die for wealth, birds die for food. This little beast had sacrificed its life for a metal walnut. Its intelligence was truly worrying.

Since the tiny beast couldn’t bite through it, Zhou Wen ignored it and let it slowly gnaw at it while he carefully studied the metal walnut.

Truth Listener’s powers couldn’t hear what was inside the metal walnut. It seemed to be solid metal at its core. Doctor Darkness’s Light of Penetration couldn’t penetrate the metal either.

Zhou Wen didn’t sense any special energy fluctuations from the metal walnut. This left him puzzled. He didn’t know what could be inside such a metal lump.

He attempted to slash with Overlord Sword, but the sword beam that possessed Ever-Victorious only left a white mark on the metal walnut.

After a while, Zhou Wen realized that the tiny beast had actually produced a shallow bite mark on the metal walnut. At this speed, he didn’t know when it would be able to bite through it. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The tiny beast forgot about running as it greedily nibbled on it. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and placed the metal walnut and the little beast into the chaos space.

In the chaos space, the tiny beast continued nibbling on the metal walnut as if it was possessed.

Before the Golden Battle God Halberd respawned, Zhou Wen took out a Buddhist scripture and pondered as he read it. Could the Eight Perfections correspond to the Eight Consciousnesses?

Six hundred volumes of the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra are condensed into the Diamond Sutra. The Diamond Sutra is also condensed into the Heart Sutra. It can be said that the Heart Sutra is the essence of the Great Perfection of Wisdom. And its true meaning lies in the Eighth Consciousnesses. It’s also known as Tathagatagarbha Thought, and it’s also known as ālayavijñāna. However, this is the concept and essence of the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. The Small Perfection of Wisdom I cultivate seems somewhat different. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss. He then looked at the other information.

He failed to figure out anything new even when the Golden Battle God Halberd respawned. He went to grind the Golden Battle God Halberd and Medusa, but they only dropped stat crystals after expending all his efforts. It made Zhou Wen suspect that the Orchid Blade replica had affected the light that shone on him from providence.

Ah Sheng said that there’s a one-third chance. It should drop next time, right? Although Zhou Wen was anxious, he didn’t have any good ideas. All he could do was wait for tomorrow.

After grinding the rare dimensional creatures again, he was quite lucky this time. Another Three-Eyed Vajra Malla Companion Egg dropped. Zhou Wen hatched it and kept it for future fusions.

After finishing his set of grinding, Zhou Wen began studying his Life Providence, Eight Perfections Wisdom, again. Only by condensing a Life Soul could he learn the Golden Battle God Halberd’s skill.

“Zhou Wen, are you busy? Do you have time to come with me to Dragon Gate Grotto?” Li Xuan suddenly came to Zhou Wen.

Li Xuan had been cultivating diligently recently and seldom came out. For him to take the initiative to look for Zhou Wen was definitely something.

“Yes,” Zhou Wen agreed.

The two of them arranged to meet in front of Dragon Gate Grotto. When Zhou Wen arrived, he realized that apart from Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan and Gu Dian from the Xuanwen Club were present as well as Ming Xiu.

“Now that Zhou Wen is here, I’ll make things clear first before we enter.” Li Xuan recounted what had happened.

Li Xuan had been cultivating diligently recently. He had gone to many dimensional zones to hone his combat abilities. He had discovered a strange dimensional creature in Dragon Gate Grotto’s Southernmost Cave. He had never seen it before.

While battling the dimensional creature, Li Xuan had nearly been killed. Thankfully, he had escaped.

The reason he had called them over was to let them take a look and see if there was a chance of killing that dimensional creature.

According to Li Xuan’s description, the dimensional creature was somewhat different from the other dimensional creatures in Dragon Gate Grotto. The Dragon Gate Grotto’s ordinary dimensional creatures were Warriors, Vajra Mallas, Fairies, and Stone Beasts.

However, that dimensional creature looked as ugly and terrifying as a devil.

After arriving outside the southernmost Cave, Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen and company, “You aren’t familiar with that dimensional creature. Don’t attack first. I’ll fight it first. Watch by the side. It’s best if you can think of a way to counter it. It won’t be too late to attack then.”

Zhou Wen, Feng Qiuyan, Gu Dian, and Ming Xiu nodded in agreement. The five of them entered the Southernmost Cave together.

There were some Warriors in the Southernmost Cave, but they were not as strong as the Vajra Mallas of the Myriad Buddha Cave. The five of them easily stormed their way in. When they arrived at a stone cave, they saw a three-headed, six-armed monster that looked like black iron rush out of the cave.

Zhou Wen looked at the three heads of the dimensional creature. Each face looked more terrifying than the other. All of them looked like evil ghosts. The only difference was that the head in the middle had a single horn while the other two had either two or three horns.

In each of his six hands was a hoop. The hoops were as thick as an infant’s arm and were shimmering with golden light. They looked like they were made of gold and there were many mysterious patterns engraved on them.
