Chapter 1518 Threat

Berserker Immortal exerted strength again. The sure-kill bullet couldn’t continue spinning under his immense pressure. The bullet kept trembling, but it couldn’t move at all. It was almost flattened under the terrifying forces of his fingers.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors charged over again. Unwilling to fight the Golden Wyrm Scissors head-on, Berserker Immortal could only duck again.

As Berserker Immortal dodged, the bullet in his hand turned into an ancient mirror.

Berserker Immortal’s reaction was already very fast. He threw out the ancient mirror in his hand, but he was too close to it. The light from the ancient mirror continued shining on him.

When the strange light shone on Berserker Immortal, his body and the blood-colored sword beam that filled the sky suddenly vanished, leaving nothing behind.

The horrified people stared blankly at the sky. If not for the fact that the buildings were halved in height, they would have imagined that the terrifying blood sea sword beams were just a dream.

Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned for the Soul Mirror to return to his hand. He saw a sanguine glow in the mirror as though it was about to seep out.

Cracks began to appear on the originally smooth mirror surface, and they were rapidly spreading

“I’ll leave this place to you.” Zhou Wen roared at Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and company before vanishing with the Soul Mirror, thanks to interstellar teleportation.

Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ming Xiu understood what Zhou Wen meant and immediately charged at the four immortals.

The four immortals’ faces turned livid. They hadn’t accomplished anything, but their ancient corpse bodies had been destroyed by their companion, Berserker Immortal. Being severely suppressed by the rules of Earth, they could barely maintain their Terror-grade standards-one that just met the mark.

They originally imagined that no one could withstand Berserker Immortal’s explosive strength, but to their surprise, he vanished for no reason, leaving the four of them lamenting inwardly.

They had seen the strength of Li Xuan and company. If they were in the dimension, it would be too easy to kill them, but not here and now.

Zhou Wen teleported to Dubhe. The cracks on the Soul Mirror had spread like spiderwebs, an indication that it was about to shatter.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen picked up the Soul Mirror and aimed it at Dubhe. When the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light shone on it, Berserker Immortal and the blood sword beams that filled the sky immediately appeared again.

However, he was no longer in Guide City, but in the hot plasma of Dubhe. Light pulses constantly exploded around him like countless hydrogen bombs.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that Dubhe’s terrifying light pulses would affect Berserker Immortal and might even damage his body.

However, to his surprise, the blood sword beams around him resisted the high temperature, radiation, and energy explosions. They protected his body as he rushed out of Dubhe.

What a terrifying fellow! Zhou Wen knew that Berserker Immortal was definitely suppressed by hellish rules. His true strength wasn’t just that.

To be able to produce such power under such circumstances was truly terrifying.

After Berserker Immortal rushed out, he didn’t attack Zhou Wen immediately because he was certain that Zhou Wen was good at spatial teleportation.

If Zhou Wen were to teleport away, there was nothing he could do about him.

“Zhou Wen, let’s make a deal,” Berserker Immortal said as he stood amidst the blood that filled the sky and looked down at Zhou Wen.

“What deal?” Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to leave as he asked calmly.

“You are Deceit King, right?” Although Berserker Immortal was asking, his tone was certain.

“Does it matter?” Zhou Wen knew that the spatial ability he had exposed had made Berserker Immortal connect him to Deceit

King.

“Yes, it really doesn’t matter. Your spatial powers are very strong. Even in the dimension, there aren’t many people at your level who are stronger than you.” Berserker Immortal paused before continuing, “I really can’t kill you here, but even if you can escape, your family can’t. Your friends and the hundreds of thousands of people in Guide City won’t be able to escape either.”

“Are you threatening me?” Zhou Wen looked coldly at Berserker Immortal.

“I’m just stating a fact. Don’t you think so?” Berserker Immortal asked.

“What are you getting at?” Zhou Wen was already filled with killing intent.

He was a person who seldom had the intention to kill. Even when facing an opponent who wanted him dead, Zhou Wen could calmly do what he needed to do.

This was because he knew very well that the other party was his enemy. Wanting him dead was very normal. There was no need to be enraged about it.

However, Berserker Immortal was different. His actions were no longer as simple as an enemy.

“Cooperate with me. From now on, you will be my race’s representative in the human world,” said Berserker Immortal.

“Which race are you from?” Zhou Wen asked.

“If you are willing to cooperate, you will naturally know in the future.” Berserker Immortal didn’t answer Zhou Wen.

“And what if I don’t?” Zhou Wen asked.

“No one related to you will live,” said Berserker Immortal coldly.

Zhou Wen suddenly laughed happily. Berserker Immortal stared coldly at Zhou Wen and said, “What’s so funny? If you weren’t proficient in spatial powers, killing you wouldn’t have been difficult. Although I can’t kill you now, your family and friends don’t have spatial powers like yours. Killing them is too easy. It wouldn’t take much more effort than squashing an ant.”

Zhou Wen stopped laughing and looked at Berserker Immortal with a blade-like gaze. “You’re right. It’s indeed very simple for you to kill them.”

“Now that you are clear on that, what’s your choice? Do you want them to die or do you want to cooperate with me?” Berserker Immortal asked Zhou Wen.

“I don’t want them dead, nor do I want to cooperate with you,” Zhou Wen said calmly. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“You have no other choice. You can only choose one,” said Berserker Immortal coldly.

However, Zhou Wen shook his head and said, “I naturally have other paths to take.” “Oh, what path is it?” Berserker Immortal asked.

“As long as I kill you, all the problems will be resolved. That is the third path.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors again.

However, this time, Zhou Wen held the Golden Wyrm Scissors in his hand instead of letting it attack autonomously.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors was very powerful and was at the Hell level. Zhou Wen’s strength was far inferior to the Golden Wyrm Scissors, but the strength of the Golden Wyrm Scissors wasn’t enough to kill Berserker Immortal either.
