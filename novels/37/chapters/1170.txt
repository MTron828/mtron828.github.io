Chapter 1171: Free Benefits

“No way...” In a daze, the black-robed man stared at Unkilling Dugu, who struggled to get up to no avail. He found it unbelievable.

However, Tsukuyomi didn’t care about Unkilling Dugu at all. Her gaze was still fixed on the stone furnace. Unkilling Dugu, who was staggering as he stood up, blocked her vision again. Her eyes focused, causing Unkilling Dugu’s body to fly away and slam into a stone wall to the side. He smashed his head and died on the spot.

Tsukuyomi ignored Unkilling Dugu’s death. Her gaze remained fixed on the stone furnace as she walked towards it step by step.

As Tsukuyomi walked towards the stone furnace, the originally simple and crude stone furnace began to tremble.

The dessicated corpse that was tied to the stone furnace turned to ashes. The chains also shattered. The patterns of the sun, moon, and stars emitted a strange black aura.

Everyone was attracted by the sudden turn of events, but Zhou Wen felt for his mysterious phone.

The mysterious phone vibrated violently as though it was about to jump out. Zhou Wen took it out and secretly took a look. Indeed, the Dead Man Tree was stirring.

Seeing everyone looking in the direction of the stone furnace, Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of Unkilling Dugu’s corpse. Immediately, his corpse was stored into his phone and devoured by the Dead Man Tree.

A sprout finally grew from the Dead Man Tree that had been barren for a long time.

I never expected to benefit from nothing. Zhou Wen was delighted, but carrying Ya’er, he retreated with Chick.

There was a limit to Unkilling Dugu’s strength regardless of how strong he was; however, the stone furnace’s anomaly brought about unpredictable consequences. Zhou Wen didn’t dare take risks considering how this wasn’t in-game.

However, before Zhou Wen could leave the Shinra Temple, he heard a bang as the door closed.

Zhou Wen wanted to teleport out, but he found himself slamming into some spatial barrier and bounced back.

“Tsukuyomi, what’s happening?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to turn to ask Tsukuyomi. She seemed to know what the stone furnace was.

Tsukuyomi stared at the stone furnace and said, “There’s a powerful creature that doesn’t belong to Earth in that stone furnace.”

A powerful creature that doesn’t belong to Earth? Could it be a creature from the dimension? Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn. To be called powerful by Tsukuyomi probably meant that it was not much weaker than her.

Boom!

Ghost aura spewed out from the stone furnace like a volcanic eruption. Accompanying it was a figure who rose from the stone furnace.

It was an extremely ugly man. He wore black armor and emitted terrifying energy. Even with Zhou Wen’s present strength, he felt his heart palpitate when he sensed the man’s strength. He had goosebumps all over his arms.

It wasn’t fear, but a natural reaction to overwhelming power.

However, from the aura from his body, he was indeed somewhat different from the dimensional creatures born on Earth. His aura was somewhat similar to Ice Maiden’s. It was very likely that he came from the dimension.

However, according to what Zhou Wen knew, dimensional creatures that descended on Earth would be suppressed by Earth’s rules. It was impossible for them to maintain their Calamity-grade strength. Otherwise, dimensional creatures would have long invaded Earth.

“You actually dare disturb a king’s slumber. Do you have any idea of the consequences?” The terrifying creature floated above the stone furnace like a god that looked down on all living beings as it enunciated each word clearly.

Tsukuyomi narrowed her eyes and looked at the dimensional creature. “This isn’t the dimension. It’s not a place you can call yourself king.”

The eyes of the dimensional creature moved slightly as he sized up Tsukuyomi. He said coldly, “You have suffered a lot by staying on Earth, haven’t you?”

“At least I don’t have to hide like a turtle,” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.

These words immediately infuriated the dimensional creature. Ghost aura erupted from his body like a tsunami.

Tsukuyomi emitted a faint moonlight that shielded Zhou Wen and company behind her. The moonlight constantly clashed with the ghostly aura before silently annihilating it.

Zhou Wen wasn’t affected by the conflict behind Tsukuyomi, but he could still sense the horror of the clash between the moonlight and the ghostly aura.

He released Ice Maiden from the Chaos Bead and secretly asked her, “Ice Maiden, do you know who that is?”

Ice Maiden had been trapped in the Chaos Bead for ages. Although there was food and water inside that prevented her from starving to death, it was miserably boring. Just as she was about to berate Zhou Wen, she was alarmed by the dimensional creature she noticed from the corner of her eye. She didn’t have the time to blame Zhou Wen as she whispered, “How is he still alive?”

“Who is he?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked when he saw that Ice Maiden recognized the dimensional creature.

“Asura, the monarch of the Asura Clan, one of the Octokind,” Ice Maiden said with a heavy expression. “What is this place? Why is he here?”

“Asura Clan’s monarch? I remember you saying that among the Octokind, the monarchs of the Celestials and Dragons are the strongest. The others are weaker, right?” Zhou Wen felt a lot more at ease when he heard that.

Although Asura was strong, he was probably weaker than Di Tian, so he shouldn’t be too difficult to deal with.

Ice Maiden read Zhou Wen’s mind and curled her lips. “The Di Tian you defeated was only a Body Cleansing Stone avatar. It’s hard to say how much strength he had. Furthermore, this Asura isn’t the Asura of the present Asura Clan. He’s the previous Asura. In ancient times, he once defeated Di Tian with martial strength. He also has another name—Not Heaven. Like Heaven, but Not Heaven.”

Ice Maiden paused for a moment before saying, “However, in ancient times, his true body descended to Earth and participated in the terrifying divine battle. Legend has it that he had long died in battle. Why is he here? What kind of place is this?”

Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss when he heard that. He hurriedly explained the situation to Ice Maiden. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After Ice Maiden heard what had happened, her expression changed. After a while, she said, “Something’s wrong. There’s something wrong with this Not Heaven. Dimensional creatures will be suppressed by the rules on Earth. Unless they use the bodies of humans, they won’t be able to unleash Calamity grade powers. However, he isn’t attached to a human, but he can still release the power of a Calamity-grade. That leaves only one possibility.”

“What possibility?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“He has given up on the dimension and betrayed it,” Ice Maiden said.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

“It’s difficult to explain. All you need to understand now is that Not Heaven is already a traitor of the dimension. He definitely wouldn’t dare let the terrifying existences of the dimension discover him. Therefore, for us who know that he’s here...” Ice Maiden didn’t continue, but her meaning was very clear.

Not Heaven was bound to silence them; he definitely wouldn’t let them walk out alive.
