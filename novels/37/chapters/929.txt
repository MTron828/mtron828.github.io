Chapter 930: Undersea Battle

Is this really not where I was originally? Zhou Wen felt like crying as he watched the deep-sea behemoths swim in the sea.

Now, Zhou Wen was certain that something had gone wrong during the teleportation, but why did it happen?

Zhou Wen thought for a moment. The Thearch needed his help and wanted the bell, so she definitely wouldn’t play any tricks. The Nine-Tailed Fox didn’t seem to have any reason to mess with him if she wanted him to deliver a message to Emperor of Shang.

Furthermore, the Nine-Tailed Fox had given the pearl to Zhou Wen. It wouldn’t do her any good if Zhou Wen couldn’t return.

Despite racking his brains, Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out the reason.

Now, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to think too much. There wasn’t much time left for the Invisibility Cloak. He had to think of a way to shake off the ice maiden and the snake monster as soon as possible.

Zhou Wen felt that he would die a terrible death if they found him.

In the vast sea, Zhou Wen didn’t have many places to hide. All he could do was continue heading deep into the sea. He decided to find a spring to hide in.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to use the Eye of Legacy to transform into a dimensional creature, but there weren’t any low-level Legendary creatures nearby. It took quite some time to simulate an Epic creature, so the invisibility time would be up before he succeeded.

The spring was a place that gave birth to dimensional creatures. Furthermore, there were countless of them. It shouldn’t be that easy for the snake monster and the ice maiden to find him.

Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to choose carefully. Three minutes of invisibility was too little. He didn’t have many options, so he swam towards a nearby spring.

It was a blue liquid spring. When Zhou Wen came previously, he had come out of the blue liquid. The blue liquid was safer.

As he watched the blue spring gradually expand in his vision, the blue liquid inside automatically isolated itself from the seawater, just like how water and oil don’t mix.

Zhou Wen plunged into the blue liquid and found it somewhat similar to the previous blue liquid. However, it was still different. The blue liquid here was darker in color and colder.

Thankfully, this temperature wasn’t enough to damage Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen dived deeper into the spring and tried his best to hide.

At the bottom of the blue liquid was a blue crystal. It wasn’t surprising that it had a crystal body. What was strange was that the crystal bodies Zhou Wen had seen previously were densely arranged. There were many of them, but this crystal body was alone. No similar crystal body appeared around it.

The blue crystal was like a pineapple with many edges. It was about the size of a basketball.

Could it be that this is the only one left after all the crystalline bodies have been spewed out? Zhou Wen guessed inwardly. This was because he had seen many fountains spew out quite a number of dimensional creatures. It was impossible for there to be only one crystal.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to think too much as he hid beside the crystal. The Invisibility Cloak’s three minutes of invisibility had ended. Although he was still visually invisible, complete invisibility was gone.

Zhou Wen converged his aura and hid without moving. He wanted to preserve his life before finding a way to return. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, Zhou Wen’s expression quickly turned nasty.

This was because Truth Listener had already discovered that the ice maiden and the snake monster had already swam down. From the direction they were heading in, they were clearly coming for the spring where he had hidden.

Crap, could it be a problem with this bell? Zhou Wen immediately realized the problem, but it was too late to throw the bell away.

If he rushed out now, it would be no different from courting death. Zhou Wen remained motionless as he hid beside the crystal.

Indeed, the ice maiden and the snake monster arrived outside the blue spring. The ice maiden looked at the blue spring and said, “The Heaven Shrouding Bell is inside.”

The snake monster glanced at her and said, “Are you sure?”

“Do you think I’ll make a mistake?” the ice maiden said as she entered the spring.

The snake monster snorted coldly and didn’t say anything else. He followed the ice maiden into the spring.

“Didn’t you say that he’s here? Where is he?” The snake monster scanned the area, but he didn’t discover Zhou Wen. Clearly, he wasn’t proficient in searching for people.

The ice maiden said indifferently, “He’s right there. Can’t you see him?”

With that said, the ice maiden casually shot out an ice beam at Zhou Wen’s hiding spot.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to move. Thankfully, he was agile in water, so he didn’t need to use teleportation to dodge the ice beam.

However, the moment he moved, the snake monster immediately discovered his location. Although Zhou Wen was still visually invisible, it was useless.

The snake monster charged at Zhou Wen as terrifying wind blades crisscrossed and slashed at him.

Zhou Wen’s movement technique was amazing, but his speed was still much slower than the snake monster. After dodging a few wind blades, he was unable to dodge them. All he could do was use teleportation again.

The wind blades that could slice through space failed to injure Zhou Wen. After rushing over, a wind blade slashed at the crystal behind him, causing a crack to appear.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to summon Earth Elemental Beast to see if he could use the rocks at the seabed to escape, he suddenly felt a terrifying vibration coming from underground.

Then, a powerful force surged from below, spewing out everything in the spring.

The power that erupted from the spring was very strange. Even the snake monster and the ice maiden couldn’t withstand it and were spat out.

Crap! Zhou Wen separated himself from the blue liquid. He was surrounded by seawater, so there was no chance for him to use Earth Escape.

After the snake monster and the ice maiden separated from the blue liquid, they surrounded Zhou Wen.

Just as the snake monster was about to charge at Zhou Wen, it suddenly saw the blue crystal appear between the three of them. After leaving the blue liquid, the crystal rapidly transformed, quickly turning into a strange dimensional creature.

It was a blue clam. The blue crystal-like shell was fan-shaped and looked very beautiful.

The moment the dimensional creature appeared, it opened its shell and spat out a blue beam of light. Its target was the snake monster.

The clam-type dimensional creature’s attack on the snake monster had already surprised Zhou Wen. What surprised him even more was that the snake monster, which had already taken a Terror form, chose to dodge instead of blocking the blue light.

What’s that dimensional creature? It actually makes a Terror-grade existence wary. Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he wondered if this was an opportunity for him to escape.

The clam-type dimensional creature seemed to recognize the snake monster as it constantly spewed out blue light at him. The snake monster wore an ugly expression, but it only dodged and didn’t attack the shell.
