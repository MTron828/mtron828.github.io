Chapter 1692: Rising to the Heaven Level!

Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Small Perfection of Wisdom’s Calamity Zone was somewhat similar to the First Order of Chaos. They had both undergone changes over the Terror transformation. The face behind Great Brahma spun around, and his entire aura underwent a tremendous change. Even his strength changed with him, reaching the Calamity grade.

It was completely different from the expressionless frontal face. When this terrifying face appeared, Great Brahma no longer exuded the peace from before. Even his strength became incisive.

Zhou Wen could sense that this power carried an extremely destructive nature. However, before he could carefully savor it, Great Brahma underwent a new change.

Zhou Wen was delighted. Great Brahma was actually charging straight for the Hell level. It wasn’t like other Essence Energy Arts that remained at the Human Realm after advancing to the Calamity grade.

A treasure that allows advancement to the Apocalypse grade is indeed different. Even if it’s only an incomplete portion, the energy it produces isn’t something ordinary Zone Cores can match. I wonder if Great Brahma has the chance of advancing to the Heaven level.?Zhou Wen kept paying attention to Great Brahma’s changes.

The insights obtained from advancing could be said to be an extremely rare experience. It was probably impossible for it to happen a second time.

As the energy increased, the face behind Great Brahma vanished. The two faces on both sides gradually became blurry.

The eight arms vanished one after another.

When the other three faces completely vanished, leaving only that beautiful face, six of the eight arms vanished, making Great Brahma look even closer to a human.

As for his beautiful face, it seemed to have undergone some changes. It became even more unfathomable. He had a faint smile that didn’t seem like a smile; it looked like anger, sorrow, or worry, but none of them at the same time. It was impossible to tell what emotions he had.

Only the terrifying look in his eyes seemed to become even more terrifying.

At that moment, the game also indicated that the Calamity Zone had advanced to the Hell level, but Great Brahma continued changing without stopping.

It’s going straight for the Heaven level??Zhou Wen was delighted. The Heaven level was probably the best among humans. Even the human representatives who obtained the resources of the dimensional species probably couldn’t advance to the Heaven level in such a short period of time.

Dark-gold matter appeared over Great Brahma’s body. The dark-gold matter was very likely the dark-gold crystals of the Great Samsara Wheel. The dark-gold crystals connected and transformed into something that resembled armor that enveloped Great Brahma’s body.

The armor gradually took form. Even Great Brahma’s face was enveloped by the dark-gold armor. The edge of the wheel of light that resembled a black hole behind him gradually turned into a dark-gold crystal, forming a wheel that resembled a black hole inside and a dark-gold crystal outside.

Great Brahma sat cross-legged as he formed a seal with his hand. The wheel behind him spun incessantly as though it was a god that had come from the void, making it even more unfathomable.

‘Great Brahma Zone advanced to the Heaven level.’

With the notification in-game, Great Brahma finally stopped changing. This was enough to surprise Zhou Wen. He was originally vexed about using the Great Samsara Wheel, but it had also cheered him up immensely.

It was hard to say if he could obtain the other two Great Samsara Wheels in the future, but advancing to the Heaven level was a huge boon.

As for not having this Samsara Wheel, the other two chosen ones had also had the possibility of advancing to the Apocalypse stage severed. However, what had that got to do with Zhou Wen? They could only blame their bad luck.

Zhou Wen was interested to know who the two unlucky ones were. He wanted to know what expression they would have when they learned that one of the Great Samsara Wheels was gone.

Looking at Great Brahma, who had advanced to the Heaven level, Zhou Wen really wanted to use the three-faced Buddha to test its might.

However, Zhou Wen quickly dispelled this thought. He originally imagined that the three-faced Buddha might be at the Heaven level, but he found it unbelievable that he could produce a treasure like the Great Samsara Wheel that allowed advancement to the Apocalypse grade.

I should head out and try other dimensional creatures.?Zhou Wen glanced at the statue-like three-faced Buddha and left the Small Buddha Temple dungeon.

While Zhou Wen was happily gaming at home to level up, the outside world wasn’t idle. The representatives of the various races constantly appeared in the world and made a name for themselves on the Cube.

Many of them were famous geniuses in the past, but there were also some unknown figures who appeared.

Mohe’s Cube’s ranking had already dropped to third place, and first place hadn’t changed for a long time.

The Sun race’s representative in the human world, “Karoman,” had established a record of clearing the six Star Palaces of the Big Dipper. Up to now, no one could match him.

There was already news that Karoman was a member of the Cape family, but they didn’t admit or deny it. Their attitude was very ambiguous.

A handsome man in golden armor who resembled a sun god stood outside the dimensional zone where the Family Clan of Gods was.

“Karoman, why aren’t you with the Cape family? Why are you here?” The guards of the Family Clan of Gods who were guarding the dimensional zone couldn’t help but become nervous when they saw the handsome man.

Karoman’s shocking performance in the Big Dipper palaces had already shocked the entire world. Some people even called him the strongest human powerhouse now.

“I want to see Mohe,” said Karoman calmly.

His voice was gentle, but it had an irresistible authority. When the guard heard this, he subconsciously turned around, hoping to find Mohe.

“Karoman, are you eager to determine the victor between us?” Mohe walked out of the dimensional zone and said to Karoman.

Mohe’s injuries had already healed. It was impossible to tell that he had been severely injured not long ago.

Karoman shook his head and said, “Although you are very strong, I’ve never treated you as an opponent. I’m here to get an answer from you.”

“What answer?” Mohe didn’t mind the arrogance in Karoman’s tone.

“Do you know how to ascend the Ise Shrine?” Karoman didn’t stand on ceremony as he asked directly.

“So what if I know? So what if I don’t?” Mohe asked.

“I’ll make a bet with you. If I win, tell me how to ascend the Ise Shrine.” Karoman still looked lofty.

“What do you have in mind?” Mohe knew that since Karoman had come knocking on his door, he definitely had an information source. Even if he denied it, he wouldn’t let it go so easily.

“The first person to clear the Big Dipper palaces is the victor,” said Karoman.

“Are you confident of passing the final Alkaid Star Palace?” Mohe frowned slightly.

Alkaid Star Palace was the Army Breaker Star Palace. The long steps in front of the Star Palace could eliminate all Essence Energy. No matter how strong a cultivator was, they would become trash without Essence Energy if they entered the Star Palace. Therefore, up to now, no one had been able to crack it.

“It can be cracked at any time,” said Karoman indifferently.
