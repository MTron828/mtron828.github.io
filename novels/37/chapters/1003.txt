Chapter 1004: Frod

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen only looked at Lie without saying a word.

He had plotted to kill the Guardian, but the other party hadn’t died. Instead, he had devoured the puppet-like Joseph. This Guardian seemed to be stronger than Zhou Wen imagined.

Seeing Zhou Wen remain silent, Lie continued, “Don’t think that defeating Joseph means defeating me. In fact, my true strength far exceeds what you see. It’s just that Joseph can’t use my true strength. However, you are different. With your ability, you can perfectly unleash my strength. When the time comes, we can defeat many Guardians and become the King of Earth.”

With that said, the gray smoke on the Guardian rose and instantly enveloped the entire arena. As for the people in the arena, they realized that they couldn’t control their bodies.

All of them began clapping like puppets as they shouted in unison, “Become the Kings of Earth together...”

Everyone was horrified. Their minds were very lucid, but for some reason, their bodies didn’t listen to them at all. It was as though they were controlled by a devil.

“Is this the true power of a Guardian?” Everyone was alarmed, angry, and afraid.

“How about it? As long as you contract with me, you will have the supreme divine power to control everything. You will become the true King of Earth.” Lie floated in the air and looked down at the entire arena like a god. It was as though the humans in the arena were ants that he could toy with.

“I’m not interested in losers,” Zhou Wen said.

“If you have any doubts about my strength, you can use all your strength. Try again and see if you can injure me,” Lie continued arrogantly. “Of course, I’m different from trash like Joseph. You can use any Companion Beast or external force as you wish without any qualms.”

“Is that so? Then I really want to give it a try,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

“Then what are you waiting for? Do it now. Reveal your strongest strength and your strongest Companion Beast. I’ll let you know what a true Guardian is. I’m completely different from that trash, Joseph. This is the true Guardian’s strength,” Lie said.

“Since you think Joseph is trash, why did you contract him?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Humans are mostly trash. There was no better choice. We can only make do by choosing trash with a suitable physique. However, since there’s a human like you, I naturally don’t need that useless trash,” Lie said.

“Is that so? Then let me see how strong you are.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he summoned the Tyrant Behemoth boxing glove and threw a punch at the levitating Lie.

“A boxing glove with Absolute Strength? Such strength might be useful against other Guardians, but to me... It’s useless... Bam...” Before Lie could finish his sentence, Zhou Wen struck him in the chest.

However, Lie didn’t realize that just as Zhou Wen’s boxing glove was about to hit him, a crystalline blue thread appeared in the boxing glove. It stabbed into Lie’s body with a terrifying icy aura.

In an instant, Lie’s body froze. Following that, the Absolute Strength-powered punch blasted the frozen body into ice fragments.

Just like that, Lie was killed with a single punch. He couldn’t even use Hypocritical Transaction. The controlled people immediately regained their freedom. The fog in the arena dissipated as warm sunlight scattered down, bathing Zhou Wen in sunlight.

“From the looks of it, you are also trash,” Zhou Wen said coldly as he looked at the ice shards that filled the sky.

For some reason, the people who were very concerned about Zhou Wen defeating Joseph felt an inexplicable sense of joy when they heard Zhou Wen’s words.

“He’s so powerful... Zhou Wen is really so powerful...” Li Benyi was so excited that he was incoherent.

Li Benyu was already dumbfounded. This was the first time he had seen such a person. He didn’t know what to say.

“F*ck it. Guardians aren’t that impressive. They’re just trash. They can’t even withstand a single punch from Zhou Wen.”

“That’s right. What trash Guardians? We humans are the strongest.”

“How can I become as strong as Zhou Wen? I also want to kill those detestable Guardians.”

...

The beliefs in Frost City seemed to change in an extremely short period of time. The belief that Guardians were invincible was slowly fading.

Although it was impossible for them to completely change because of this matter, at least there was already a seed of restlessness sprouting in their hearts.

“Sorry, I originally wanted to hand Joseph over to you, but I never expected...” Zhou Wen returned to the lounge and said apologetically to Lance, Sadie, and Gulli.

“This has nothing to do with you, but there’s something I hope you can help me with,” Lance said.

“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“My great-grandfather wants to meet you,” Lance said seriously.

“I should greet the elders,” Zhou Wen said.

“Follow me. This might be a little different from the elder you imagine.” Lance only invited Zhou Wen.

Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ya’er had to wait outside. They weren’t on the invitation list.

Zhou Wen originally believed that no matter how bad Lance’s great-grandfather’s personality was, he wouldn’t bicker with him on account of Lance and Sadie.

However, when he really saw Lance’s great-grandfather, he realized that it wasn’t what he had imagined.

Lance took Zhou Wen to the depths of Frost City. It was a place that resembled an ice cave that had existed for billions of years. And on the ice wall of the ice cave, there was a humanoid sculpture. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

One could see that the sculpture was a very majestic elder, but there were no signs of it being a man-made carving. It was as though the elder’s ice sculpture had grown out of the ice wall.

“Great-grandfather... I brought Zhou Wen here...” When Lance bowed at the ice sculpture, his words left Zhou Wen dumbfounded.

“Hello, Zhou Wen. I’m Frod.” The ice sculpture actually spoke. Furthermore, the name he said left Zhou Wen even more alarmed.

“Frod? Could it be that you are one of the six heroes, Frod?” Zhou Wen had learned this name countless times in his textbooks, so he naturally wouldn’t forget it.

However, according to what Zhou Wen knew, other than the old hero from the Dugu family, the other five heroes should have passed away.

Even if Frod was still alive, he couldn’t be an ice sculpture, right?
