Chapter 838: Three Realms’ Best Wind

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen remained silent. Zhang Yuzhi was lucky, but at the same time, she was unlucky. She had to withstand the pros and cons of her ability and pain.

Zhou Wen could understand Zhang Yuzhi’s feelings. She wasn’t willing to become best friends with dimensional creatures before killing them.

However, the Zhang family was in such a difficult situation. It was even possible that they would be wiped out. What she did might be saving the lives of all her family members.

Every family has its hardships. It’s not easy for a large family like the Zhang family either. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly.

After Zhang Yuzhi left, Zhou Wen didn’t stay in Celestial Master Manor. He went to an inn in Dragon Tiger Town. On the one hand, he didn’t want to trouble the Zhang family, and on the other hand, it was also convenient for Liu Yun to contact him when he arrived.

That afternoon, Demonic Neonate completed her evolution and became an Epic. Her various skills didn’t change, and only her stats increased to 41. Zhou Wen could only continue to look forward to the pleasant surprise the Wheel of Destiny would bring when she evolved to the Mythical stage.

Demonic Neonate’s return made Zhou Wen feel a lot more at ease. Although she was only at the Epic stage, her combat strength was greatly beneficial to Zhou Wen.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling gratified that Demonic Neonate had completed her evolution, Banana Fairy, who hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage, successfully advanced to the Mythical stage on the same day.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He had been waiting for Banana Fairy for too long. Seeing Banana Fairy break out of her egg and transform into a young girl in a jade-silk dress, Zhou Wen couldn’t wait to see her stats.

Banana Fairy: Mythical (Evolvable)

Life State: Supreme Yin Spirit Root.

Life Soul: Divine Wind Immortal

Wheel of Destiny: Three Realms’ Best Wind (Yin)

Strength: 81

Speed: 81

Constitution: 81

Essence Energy: 81

Talent Skill: Supreme Yin Wind

Companion Form: Fan

There weren’t many changes to the other skills, but her basic stats had increased to 81 points of a top Mythical. The additional Wheel of Destiny was actually called the Three Realms’ Best Wind. This name was very domineering, but he didn’t know how effective it was.

Why is there the word Yin behind the Wheel of Destiny? Could it be that there’s the Three Realms’ Best Wind with the word Yang? Zhou Wen found it odd.

Summoning Banana Fairy in reality, he saw a girl in green clothes with a light veil. She looked to be about fourteen or fifteen years old. Her snow-white legs were bare as she sat on a banana leaf.

At that moment, the banana leaf was much bigger than before. The girl sat there, floating. Her veil was lithe and she looked uncomfortable.

Although Zhou Wen didn’t mind the appearance of a Companion Beast, he was naturally in a good mood with such a beautiful and adorable Companion Beast by his side.

He launched a game dungeon and entered the Metalwork Temple dungeon. Zhou Wen wanted to see how powerful Banana Fairy’s Wheel of Destiny was.

There were furnaces everywhere in the Metalwork Temple and the temperature was rather high.

Banana Fairy sat on the banana leaf and floated beside the blood-colored avatar. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, she puffed up her cheeks and blew at the Metalwork Temple.

Whoosh!

Large swaths of Fire Elemental Sprites and various dimensional creatures were blown away. Anything that could move was blown away. As for the huge furnaces, they were all extinguished.

As though a hurricane had passed, Zhou Wen saw the game’s notification column being flooded. Notices of various dimensional creatures dying kept popping up.

Zhou Wen quickly walked into the Metalwork Temple and realized that the flames at the back of the temple had also been extinguished. It was a mess.

The Metalwork Temple that was originally filled with furnaces no longer had any flames. The temperature had returned to normal and he no longer felt hot.

What left Zhou Wen somewhat depressed was that the dimensional creatures that had been blown to death by the Three Realms’ Best Wind had been sent flying. The dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs that dropped couldn’t be found.

That’s way too strong. As expected of the Three Realms’ Best Wind! Just as Zhou Wen was feeling excited, he saw Banana Fairy looking somewhat exhausted. Her Essence Energy had been drained, and even the Three Realms’ Best Wind had entered a cooldown state.

What a pity. If I could get her to do it a few times in a row, this thing would be better than nuclear bombs, Zhou Wen thought greedily.

Even without the Wheel of Destiny’s augmentation, Banana Fairy’s Supreme Yin Wind was considered a powerful divine technique. Ordinary Mythical creatures couldn’t withstand a single strike from her. Even if they weren’t blown away, they would be frozen.

Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy’s complete evolution delighted Zhou Wen.

After grinding Pill Furnace Mountain again, no Mythical Companion Egg dropped.

Zhou Wen went out for a stroll that day. When he returned, he realized that Liu Yun was sitting in his room. Zhou Wen had no idea when he had arrived.

Liu Yun didn’t look well. He had dark circles under his eyes and he looked cranky. His hair was greasy and messy. He looked like he hadn’t washed his hair for weeks.

The stubble on his face had grown out and his clothes weren’t clean. If not for his good looks and branded clothes, he would have been mistaken as a beggar.

“Where’s Ya’er?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.

“Ya’er is fine. Don’t worry. It’s very easy to see her. Help me do something,” Liu Yun said through gritted teeth.

It hadn’t been easy for him all this while. Now, he could finally extort Zhou Wen.

“Do you want me to help you steal the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg?” Zhou Wen asked.

“That’s right.” Liu Yun nodded smugly. “As long as you do as I say, I’ll naturally return Ya’er to you after everything is done. Otherwise...”

“There’s no need to say otherwise. If you like it, continue having her,” Zhou Wen said.

“What? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill...” Liu Yun was furious. He had suffered so much just for this moment. To his surprise, Zhou Wen actually said such a thing? It infuriated him.

“If you dare kill her, do it,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“What do you mean? Do you think I don’t dare?” Liu Yun said angrily. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Did you find your journey extremely problematic?” Zhou Wen asked.

“What has that got to do with you?” Liu Yun’s heart skipped a beat as he asked Zhou Wen suspiciously.

“It has nothing to do with me, but you can think about when your bad luck started,” Zhou Wen said.

“Are you saying that all of this was caused by Ya’er?” Liu Yun was immediately enraged. He had always thought that it was his fault, but he never expected the problem to be with that little girl.

“Do you know Wang Lu from the Wang family? Some people are born different. Ya’er is such a person, but she’s different from Wang Lu. She won’t bring you luck... Do you understand what I mean? Anyway, if you like her, continue taking her around. It saves me trouble,” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun was dumbfounded. He never expected such a thing to happen. Of course he knew Wang Lu from the Wang family. He even knew Wang Chan, but he never expected Ya’er to be such a person as well.
