Chapter 105 The Antelope That Just Won’t Leave

At the Special Investigation Bureau’s dedicated hospital.

“Liz, answer me honestly. Is there anything you exaggerated in the report you submitted?” Qiao Siyuan asked with a grave expression.

“Minister, I’ve been strictly trained in intelligence. I know the importance of correct intelligence. I can guarantee that the report I wrote has no exaggerations or falsehoods. I can be responsible for every word in it.” Liz struggled to get up as she was pushed down by Qiao Siyuan.

“You have just received treatment. Only by recuperating and being able to move can you have what it takes to continue fighting.” Qiao Siyuan placated Liz and flipped through her report. “I have already done thorough investigations and have confirmed that there’s a mysterious stone tablet in Small Buddha Temple. It’s like the other lands of mystery. No one can master the Primordial Energy Art on the stone monument unless that person possesses the special physique that matches

it.”

“In that case, that Zhou Wen...” The mere thought of Zhou Wen made Liz immediately clench her teeth.

If it weren’t for Zhou Wen, she wouldn’t have been injured, much less have her sea of energy destroyed.

Qiao Siyuan nodded slightly. “According to your report, he was able to enter the temple hall without being harmed. As for you, you had Headless Angel to protect you; yet, you were nearly killed. This means there are only two possibilities. First, it’s that he has a guardian Companion Beast that’s stronger than Headless Angel, protecting him from harm. The other possibility is that he possesses a special physique that matches Small Buddha Temple, preventing him from being attacked. I’m inclined towards the latter.”

Liz said hatefully, “The An family must have known that Zhou Wen had a special physique. That’s why they view him in a different light and gave him An Jing’s candidacy at all costs. If by a stroke of luck, he has obtained another special physique, having two talents on him, it won’t be impossible for him to have a chance to break through to the Mythical realm. The An family has really made their plans. I think Ouyang Lan and Zhou Lingfeng’s marriage was probably just a transaction.”

At the thought of the An family, Liz also gritted her teeth in hatred. She was the daughter of a Senator after all; yet, An Tianzuo had her sea of energy crippled. She had to have her revenge.

Qiao Siyuan said plainly, “The impact dimensional zones have in various parts of the world is growing more obvious. It results in the barriers between territories growing, therefore impeding movement. The factions from these territories have always been trying to use this opportunity to extricate themselves from the League’s control. The An family is filled with ambition and they have a Primordial Gold mine while they have been nurturing their army. They are also using all kinds of means to seek out a way to break through to the Mythical stage. Their ambition knows no bounds.”

“Minister, we can’t let the An family continue. We have to nip Zhou Wen in the bud. As long as the An family doesn’t have a Mythical expert, they will have scruples and won’t easily betray and abandon the League,” Liz said excitedly.

“Calm down. You haven’t recovered from your injuries.” After placating Liz’s emotions, Qiao Siyuan continued, “Let’s not talk about whether Zhou Wen was intentionally nurtured by the An family, just the fact that he has a special physique implies he needs to come under the League’s service. He cannot become a private tool of the An family. However, Luoyang is ultimately the An family’s territory. After what happened the previous time, they will definitely enhance their protection of him. It’s probably impossible to touch him in Luoyang.”

“Are we just going to watch the An family do whatever they want?” Liz said angrily.

“Of course not. However, everything depends on the ways and methods employed. The League needs the An family’s supply of Primordial Gold Ore so we can’t touch them for now. However, since Zhou Wen obtained a nomination, he will definitely be sent to our League’s holy grounds and lose the protection of the An family. From there, it will be a lot easier for us to bring him back,” Qiao Siyuan said indifferently.

“We let him off. He can live for a few more days,” Liz said hatefully.

Qiao Siyuan exhorted again. “For now, don’t tell anyone about Zhou Wen’s special physique. It’s best if there aren’t any external complications.”

“Minister, don’t worry. I understand what needs to be done.” Liz nodded slightly.

Having a special physique had wide implications. Even in the Senate, there were different voices. The various factions also treated special physiques seriously. If other factions knew that Zhou Wen possessed a special physique, it would likely be impossible for them to control the situation’s development, something Liz and Qiao Siyuan least wanted to happen.

Qiao Siyuan was thinking about work, but Liz only wanted to finish off Zhou Wen personally.

In the Four Seasons Garden dorms, Zhou Wen sat on a chair and stared at the white antelope.

This antelope had been following him ever since he returned from Mount Laojun. It even squeezed into the college bus and returned to the college with him.

Zhou Wen really wished to chase the creature away, but he knew how terrifying the antelope was. If he forcefully chased it away, it was possible that it would explode with rage and slaughter someone. When that happened, not only would it affect Zhou Wen, even his fellow classmates and teacher would be down on their luck.

Therefore, even though Zhou Wen wished to chase away the antelope, he didn’t forcefully drive it away.

Thankfully, it was normal for students to use Companion Beasts at Sunset College, so it wasn’t too shocking for Zhou Wen to bring one back. However, Li Xuan and the other students didn’t cease mocking him on the way back.

“I say, Zhou Wen, your luck is pretty good. A pet automatically recognizes you as its owner. Unfortunately, this is only an antelope that mutated on Mount Laojun and not a high-level dimensional creature. If this fellow was an Epic dimensional creature, that would be awesome. It’s really a pity.” Back when Li Xuan said those words, it was naturally a jibe at Zhou Wen. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, Zhou Wen knew very well that the fellow definitely had powers at the Epic stage.

“Brother Antelope, I’ve washed your grass. Eat it with ease. I’ve used green, natural, uncontaminated cleaning fluid to wash it more than ten times. It’s clean. Quickly finish it and go on your merry way. A place like school has too much dust and the pollution is terrible. There are all kinds of people here and there’s all kinds of noise pollution. It’s nothing comparable to a place like Mount Laojun. It must be hard on you living here. It’s best you return.” Zhou Wen placed the withered grass on the table in front of the antelope as he persuaded it sincerely.

Glancing at the withered grass on the table, it didn’t even sniff it but turned around and walked to the couch. It then lay on the couch and squinted its eyes comfortably.

“Brother Antelope, although you are indeed impressive, you should know that this is Sunset College. Many Epic experts are stationed here. If they discover that you are a feral dimensional creature, I’m afraid...” Zhou Wen had planned on reasoning with it when he realized that emotional appeal didn’t work.

To his surprise, the antelope had fallen asleep on the couch as though it hadn’t heard Zhou Wen at all.
