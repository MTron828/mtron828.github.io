Chapter 1289: Godlike

The might of this punch was so powerful that it probably exceeded the limits of the Terror grade. Its pure strength caused space to tremble and warp.

Not only was the punch terrifying, but it was also unbelievably fast. It approached the speed of light.

“The powers of Fairy Peacock and True Martial are really useful. They can actually raise Ox Demon’s strength to such a level. Although they aren’t comparable to a Calamity-grade, they aren’t too far off,” Xia Liuchuan exclaimed.

Before he could say anything else, Xia Liuchuan’s mouth gaped open.

Ox Demon’s terrifying punch missed.

What was ridiculous was that Immortal stood there without moving. Ox Demon’s punch flew past the side of his face without touching Immortal.

“Holy sh*t, he can’t even hit him. They must be in cahoots. Could Ox Demon be a spy planted by the League of Guardians in the Holy Spirit Association?”

“Ox Demon is definitely a traitor. His acting sucks.”

“Bro, can you put in more effort in your acting?”

…

Even an expert like Xia Liuchuan was somewhat puzzled as to why Ox Demon’s punch missed. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

They had thought of ten thousand possibilities prior to this, even considering the possibility of Ox Demon being suppressed by Immortal with one finger, but they never expected Ox Demon to miss.

Following that, something even more ridiculous happened. Ox Demon’s punches came one after another. Even half a planet would probably be destroyed by his crazy bombardment.

However, Immortal was completely fine. Even his hair didn’t stir. All of Ox Demon’s attacks and his violent fists brushed past Immortal as though he had deliberately missed.

At that moment, anyone could tell that something was amiss. The power in Ox Demon’s fist wasn’t fake, nor was it acting. It looked like he just couldn’t hit his target.

However, Immortal had never moved. How could he not be able to hit him?

Everyone felt that Ox Demon should be able to hit him, but every punch he threw with all his might missed. It was as though he had deliberately avoided Immortal.

“Legend has it that saints have the protection of the heavens. All Dharma can’t touch them. Could it be that Immortal of the League of Guardians is already powerful enough to be considered a saint?” Xia Liuchuan muttered to himself as he looked at the godlike Immortal.

“I don’t know if he’s a saint, but this power is really terrifying. It makes the opponent completely unable to hit him. This power is very similar to one of the legendary powers of our Zhang family, but no one in the Zhang family has mastered it,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“What power?” Xia Liuchuan asked curiously.

“Evil Annihilation Retreat,” Zhang Chunqiu answered.

On the Cube, Immortal finally moved. He raised his hand but didn’t move quickly. He pressed his thumb to his middle finger and flicked Ox Demon’s head.

Ox Demon’s eyes were filled with horror as he attacked with all his might. However, his attacks still seemed to deliberately avoid Immortal. He didn’t even touch Immortal’s clothes.

Bang!

Immortal’s middle finger flicked Ox Demon’s forehead, sending him flying like a cannonball. He slammed into Venus, creating a huge crater in the rocky ground.

The shockwave constantly tumbled out like a nuclear blast.

After the blast passed, people saw Ox Demon’s mighty body. He had collapsed inside the rock pit, his body contorted. His forehead had caved in, and his body was covered in blood.

Struggling, Ox Demon barely managed to get up from the pit. After taking two steps, he staggered and fell to the ground.

Everyone fell silent. Such a powerful Ox Demon failed to even withstand Immortal’s finger strike. He was already half-dead.

“Thief Sage, take the president away now.” Fairy Peacock and True Martial rushed in front of Zhong Ziya and shielded him behind them as they shouted at Liu Yun.

However, just as they finished speaking, they suddenly realized that Immortal, who had been far away in midair, had appeared in front of them at some point in time. His eyes were less than a foot away from theirs.

Pa! Pa!

Immortal extended his hand and slapped Fairy Peacock and True Martial in the face. The two of them immediately flew out like cannonballs. Their faces contorted as they slammed into the ground, creating two deep ravines that were thousands of meters long.

Pfft!

True Martial struggled to get up. His head was covered in blood and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

On the other side, Peacock Fairy was in an even worse state. There was no movement from her under the rubble. It was unknown if she was dead or alive.

In an instant, the three core members of the Holy Spirit Association, who had accompanied Ya to rush to the top of the rankings, appeared so weak that they were easily beaten by Immortal.

“How powerful!” Everyone felt their scalps tingle. The power of Immortal carried an overbearingness that made it difficult for others to resist.

“He’s a Calamity-grade, right?”

“I think he’s more like a god. An omnipotent god.”

“Nothing less expected of a god’s possession. Even an enemy’s attack will automatically avoid him. What a miracle!”

Ordinary people were amazed, but those who wanted to liberate themselves from the League of Guardians’ rule felt heavy emotions after seeing the horror of Immortal.

Liu Yun was alarmed as well. He gritted his teeth and instant transmitted behind Zhong Ziya, about to teleport away from Venus with him.

However, before he could touch Zhong Ziya, the Primordial Immortal Sword in Zhong Ziya’s hand was already at his throat, forcing Liu Yun to stop.

“What are you doing? I’m helping you,” Liu Yun shouted angrily.

“Find an opportunity to take them away,” Zhong Ziya said as he stared at Immortal. The Primordial Immortal Sword in his hand and his body emitted an unimaginably terrifying sword intent.

His aura constantly rose, almost no weaker than Immortal’s. However, at his chest, the white robe gradually turned blood-red. The blood-red flower bloomed on the white robe like a flower. Clearly, there was constant bleeding underneath.

“He’s indeed injured. Even with the Substitute technique, it’s not that easy to dodge the seventh sure-kill shot,” Zhang Chunqiu sighed as though he had noticed the problem long ago.

“If he wasn’t injured, he might really be able to fight Immortal. Now, I’m afraid he can at most risk his life to stall for time. I just don’t know how long he can last.” Xia Liuchuan shook his head.

Immortal looked at Zhong Ziya, whose chest was already blood-red, and said, “If you continue, I don’t need to do anything. That injury will take your life. I don’t like people I wish to kill dying in front of me.”

“Is that so? Then accompany me to hell to see the scenery there.” Zhong Ziya ignored everything and continued releasing the remaining energy in his body, about to give up on suppressing his injuries.

“Sirs, do you need a fighter substitute service?” A voice suddenly sounded.
