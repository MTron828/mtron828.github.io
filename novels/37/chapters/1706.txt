Chapter 1707 The Whereabouts of the Immortal Sword

Just as he was in a daze, he suddenly heard his phone ring. He subconsciously took it out and answered the call.

“Pata, have you arrived? Where are you now? Quickly lend me the Anasrava Gold Turtle.” Karoman’s anxious voice sounded from the phone.

Upon hearing Karoman mention the Anasrava Gold Turtle, Pata felt even more stifled. He had suffered a huge blow just now and hadn’t recovered from it. Now, he was truly awake and his heart ached even more.

“Borrow my ass. Don’t come to me again if it’s anything related to Zhou Wen in the future,” cursed Pata as he hung up and switched off his phone.

Karoman was puzzled by the cursing and couldn’t figure out what was going on. He immediately called back, but he received the notification that the other party had switched off his phone.

What’s going on? Karoman wore an odd expression. Thinking back to Pata’s words, “Don’t come to me again if it’s anything related to Zhou Wen in the future,” he had a rough idea.

This fellow went to look for Zhou Wen? Furthermore, he suffered a loss? Karoman guessed a portion of it. Although it wasn’t all, he was already somewhat afraid.

Although Pata’s strength is a little lacking, he has the Anasrava Gold Turtle protecting him. He shouldn’t have suffered a loss, but from Pata’s tone, he seems to have suffered a huge loss. Could it be that the Anasrava Gold Turtle can’t withstand Zhou Wen’s taboo power? No matter how he thought about it, he never expected Pata’s Anasrava Gold Turtle to be taken away by Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was rather comfortable at home as he looked at the Anasrava Gold Turtle’s stats.

Anasrava Gold Turtle: Calamity (Evolvable)

Life Providence: Anasrava Body

Life Soul: Immortality

Wheel of Destiny: Immunity to All Dharma

Terror Form: Invulnerable Vajra Body (S-grade)

Calamity Zone: Invincible Without Me (Hell)

Strength: 200

Speed: 200

Constitution: 200

Essence Energy: 200

Talent Skill: Protection, Breaking Out, Exorcism, Eternal

Companion Form: Armor

It’s just advanced to the Hell level. The stats are still the most basic stats of the Hell level. Zhou Wen was greedy. He originally wondered if the Anasraya Gold Turtle’s stats had reached the peak of the Hell level.

It didn’t occur to him that ordinary people had no way of obtaining so many resources to feed a Calamity-grade Companion Beast. Pata had invested tons to be able to get the Anasrava Gold Turtle to the Hell level.

This was only because he had become a representative and had used most of the resources given by the dimensional races on the Anasrava Gold Turtle. Otherwise, it was a question whether the Anasrava Gold Turtle could advance to the Calamity grade by itself.

Zhou Wen was somewhat curious if the Anasrava Gold Turtle could withstand the power of the Teacher Domain, so he summoned it to give it a try. He realized that this thing wasn’t afraid of the power of the Teacher Domain. Or rather, it wasn’t completely afraid.

The Teacher Domain could affect the Anasrava Gold Turtle, but it couldn’t completely seal it.

Zhou Wen didn’t continue his research. The better the Anasrava Gold Turtle was, the more uncomfortable he felt. If it was really one of the three Companion Beasts of Small Buddha Temple, it would definitely be devoured by Truth Listener in the future. No matter how deep the research went, he couldn’t keep it. It would only make him feel worse. Let me see if it’s you. I hope not. Zhou Wen summoned Truth Listener to see if it would react to the Anasrava Gold Turtle.

Truth Listener’s golden eyes immediately lit up when it saw the Anasrava Gold Turtle. Before Zhou Wen could say a word, the earrings on its ears shattered by themselves and it quickly transformed into the golden ape. It went forward to bite the Anasrava Gold Turtle.

It really is one! Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless as he ordered the Anasrava Gold Turtle to not resist and let Truth Listener swallow it.

After swallowing the Anasrava Gold Turtle, Truth Listener automatically transformed into a tattoo and returned to Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen couldn’t summon it no matter how hard he tried.

This fellow is getting more and more willful. Did he follow Demonic Neonate’s bad example? Zhou Wen muttered as he began studying his next target to advance to the Calamity grade.

Now, the only Essence Energy Arts that hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade were the Godfiend Era and the Demon God Catalog. Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t go to Chess Mountain now. Even if he wanted to go, he had to wait for Truth Listener to finish its digestion.

The origins of the Godfiend Era are unknown. I don’t even know which pantheon’s Essence Energy Art it is. However, its stats are related to space. I’ll find a spatial dimensional zone to give it a try. Zhou Wen didn’t have any suitable dungeons on his phone. All he could do was flip through some information, hoping to find a suitable dimensional zone.

Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion.

“Where’s the person I want?” A cold woman’s voice sounded from the jade building. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Wang Mingyuan sighed softly and said, “I’ve already handed the token to Zhou Wen. He didn’t come. Perhaps he has already made a decision or perhaps he hasn’t thought it through.” “This isn’t the answer I want.” The woman’s voice was emotionless. There was no joy, anger, sadness, or joy in it, but it made one feel reverence after hearing it, as though they were listening to the teachings of a god.

Wang Mingyuan wasn’t afraid as he said calmly, “He’s only my disciple, not my son. Even a son might not completely listen to me.”

“If you can’t do it, what’s the point of keeping you?” the woman said indifferently as though she had Wang Mingyuan’s life pinched between her fingers.

“I know the whereabouts of that immortal sword.” Wang Mingyuan didn’t seem to care about life and death as he continued smiling.

“I hope what you say next can be exchanged for your life,” the woman said.

“The sword is at Kunlun Mountain,” Wang Mingyuan answered. “How do you know that the sword is at Kunlun Mountain?” The woman didn’t believe Wang Mingyuan.

“I saw it with my own eyes,” Wang Mingyuan answered calmly.

“Since you saw it, why didn’t you bring the sword back?” the woman asked again.

“I could see it, but I couldn’t get it.”

“Why?”

“I’m no match for the dimensional creatures of Kunlun Mountain. There’s even a phoenix guarding the sword.” “What kind of phoenix?” the woman asked curiously.

Dragons were lascivious, resulting in many mixed-blood dragons, but phoenixes were pure creatures. Different types of phoenixes were unheard of.

“The Feng and Huang of a Phoenix,” Wang Mingyuan answered strangely.

However, the woman seemed to understand him. She said thoughtfully, “No wonder. It’s indeed beyond you.”

After a pause, the woman continued, “If you go to Kunlun Mountain again, will you be able to find the location of the sword?”

“If it’s only to take a look, I can lead the way at any time. I definitely won’t disappoint you, Immortal Supremacy,” Wang Mingyuan said with a smile.

The meaning behind his words was very clear. He could lead the way, but it was definitely impossible for him to retrieve the sword.

“You just need to lead the way. Someone will naturally retrieve the sword,” the woman said.

“I’m ready at your disposal, Immortal Supremacy,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“Stay here and listen to orders from the Immortals. Someone will inform you when the time comes.” The woman fell silent after saying that.

Wang Mingyuan bowed slightly before turning to leave the Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion.

Inside the Immortal Crossing Jade Pavilion, an azure-robed woman frowned slightly as though she was thinking about something important.
