Chapter 1779 Living Zone Core

Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with the woman in front of him. An Tianzuo’s sister, An Jing, could be considered his sister from a certain angle.

Of course, neither An Jing nor Zhou Wen admitted to this relationship.

“What’s the meaning of this?” Zhou Wen turned his gaze to the flower and asked coldly.

“Don’t you want Chess Mountain’s Zone Core? Chess Mountain’s Zone Core is on her. She’s a living Zone Core,” The Thearch teased.

“What do you mean by ‘on her?”” Zhou Wen’s expression darkened.

“She was nurtured by me. The Zone Core that’s compatible with her is naturally Chess Mountain’s Zone Core. Now, she has already used Chess Mountain’s Zone Core to advance to the Calamity grade. What do you think I mean?” The Thearch said with a smile.

“You didn’t hand me the Zone Core. Is that a violation of the contract?” Zhou Wen said coldly.

“How did I violate the contract? If you need me to give it to you personally, I can strip the Zone Core from her body and hand it to you.” The Thearch smiled even more happily. “However, without the Zone Core, she naturally can’t be at the Calamity grade. Furthermore, it’s impossible for her to advance to the Calamity grade in the future. Apart from this Zone Core, it’s impossible for there to be a second Zone Core in the world that’s compatible with her.”

“Do you think this will make me regret it?” Zhou Wen said expressionlessly.

“Whether you regret it or not has nothing to do with the contract. I just want you to understand a principle. There’s no free lunch in this world. You aren’t willing to pay the price, yet you want to obtain such a precious item. How can there be such a good thing in this world?” The Thearch smiled and said, “Young people have to firmly remember that this world isn’t revolving around them. It’s not something you can do as you wish. You have to pay the corresponding price for what you want. The benefits that don’t require you to pay might end up making you lose even more.”

“How will you choose now? Do you want me to personally give you the Zone Core?” The Thearch smiled very happily.

How could Zhou Wen not know the truth behind The Thearch’s words? Since he wanted to make a deal with the devil, he was already prepared to pay the price. However, he never expected such a situation.

However, even so, Zhou Wen didn’t regret coming here, nor did he regret making a bet with The Thearch.

He turned to look at the motionless An Jing. In fact, Zhou Wen hadn’t paid much attention to her before today because he had never paid attention to her. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

An Jing looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression. From Zhou Wen’s conversation with The Thearch, she understood what was going on.

An Jing originally imagined that she had obtained a huge opportunity, but she never expected it to turn out this way. She couldn’t help but feel disheartened.

She worked hard to prove that she wasn’t inferior to Zhou Wen, but the distance between the two of them grew.

After meeting The Thearch, she believed that she finally had a chance to catch up or even surpass Zhou Wen. She never expected that she was just a bargaining chip between The Thearch and Zhou Wen.

Perhaps it wasn’t even considered a bargaining chip because there was still a chance of winning the bet, but she didn’t stand any chance. With a word from Zhou Wen, her hard-earned achievements would be stripped away.

An Jing had a deep understanding of The Thearch’s words.

“It’s something that doesn’t belong to me. Take it away,” An Jing suddenly said to Zhou Wen.

She didn’t need Zhou Wen’s pity, much less have him give in to her. She would rather start all over again. Otherwise, it would be meaningless even if she succeeded. If she accepted Zhou Wen’s pity, she wouldn’t have the right to say anything about surpassing him.

“Hehe, did you hear that? She’s willing to sacrifice herself for you. What a good sister. What shall be your choice? Do you want me to take the Zone Core out of her and give it to you now?” The Thearch’s voice sounded indescribably disgusting to Zhou Wen.

“Of course I want the Zone Core,” Zhou Wen said calmly. “However, do you dare make a bet with me?”

“Oh, you want to make a bet with me?” The flower bud turned to Zhou Wen and sized him up with interest.

“Yes, do you dare?” Zhou Wen asked.

“There’s no need to showcase your clumsy goading. I can tell you clearly now that I’ll accept any bet. Even if it’s an unfair bet, it’s fine. Just tell me what you want the bet to be,” The Thearch said with a smile.

“My bet is very fair. I want to bet on luck.” Although The Thearch made it very clear that she would accept an unfair bet, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on making such a bet.

This was because Zhou Wen knew very well that his knowledge wasn’t on the same level as The Thearch’s. Even if he believed that he would definitely win, he might not. Furthermore, he might lose even more tragically.

“Are you sure you want to bet on luck with me? You’ve probably forgotten that to me, even if it’s a one in a billion chance, as long as I’m willing, it’s a hundred percent chance. I suggest that you bet on something that has a higher chance of winning. For example, you can bet that you are a man, or you can bet that I won’t die today. That way, your chances of winning will be higher,” The Thearch persuaded sincerely.

“There’s no need. Since it’s a bet, it has to be absolutely fair. I’ll bet with you on luck. If you don’t win, her Zone Core won’t count. Give me another Zone Core. If I lose, her Zone Core will still be yours. The previous bet will still be valid. Furthermore, it will be as you wish. I’ll help you escape now.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

“As you wish. How do you want to bet on your luck?” The Thearch was truly intrigued. She wanted to know how Zhou Wen was going to bet.

“I want to bet with you on who will live longer.” Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate as he revealed the bet he had thought of.

After The Thearch heard Zhou Wen’s bet, she immediately understood his intentions. She said disdainfully, “You want to bet that I’ll live longer than you, right?”

“No, I want to bet that I’ll live longer than you,” Zhou Wen said.

The Thearch couldn’t help but be slightly taken aback because it was impossible for Zhou Wen to win with such a bet.

If The Thearch was willing, she could kill Zhou Wen. Then, she would naturally win the bet. Therefore, this was a bet that was suicidal.

What kind of person was The Thearch? After some thought, she immediately understood Zhou Wen’s thoughts. Her voice turned cold. “Do you really think I won’t kill you? It’s best if you don’t test my patience. My tolerance is very limited.”

“You can kill me, but you won’t be able to win if you kill me. You will still lose the bet,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“Why can’t I win after killing you?” The Thearch was somewhat curious. She couldn’t figure out why she would still lose after killing Zhou Wen.
