Chapter 1286: Level Clearing

The Holy Spirit Association didn’t drip their blood to enter the Venusian dimensional zone. Instead, with Liu Yun’s help, they directly teleported into the dimensional zone.

Liu Yun first brought Ox Demon into the room. As the Metal Guard fired, Ox Demon’s tall figure charged forward suddenly. With a single punch, he blasted the bullet along with the Metal Guard apart. His strength was shocking.

The more powerful a person in the Holy Spirit Association was, the higher their bounty on the Federation’s wanted list. Without a doubt, the Ox Demon was the one with the highest bounty in the Holy Spirit Association other than Ya.

The number of Guardians he had killed was probably in the triple digits. Most of them were members of the League of Guardians.

Ya, Fairy Peacock, and True Martial were sent over by Liu Yun one by one. As for Ox Demon, he had already started a massacre inside. The Metal Guards that came out of the six doors were killed with his punches one after another, no different from crushing ants.

Without needing the others to do anything, Ox Demon finished off all the Metal Guards.

The Golden Battle God Mark I came out of the door and shot a freezing bullet at Ox Demon. Ox Demon was a hot-tempered individual and had no intention of retreating. His armor-covered body tore through the air and his fist smashed into the freezing bullet.

As the fist collided with the freezing bullet, the freezing bullet shattered, turning into a large icy fog that spread out. Ox Demon broke through the ice fog and arrived in front of the Golden Battle God. His body was covered in frost, but he thought nothing of it. He punched at the Golden Battle God again and again.

As the fist hit the metal, the Golden Battle God’s metal body failed to withstand Ox Demon’s punches. His entire body caved in as fist imprints appeared everywhere. Finally, his chest was shattered by the punch, and even his energy source exploded.

“What terrifying power,” said Xia Liuchuan.

Zhang Chunqiu thought for a moment and said, “Ox Demon’s original name was Zhang Jing. He was originally the son of a local tycoon. Back then, his father’s influence locally wasn’t inferior to An Tianzuo’s status in Luoyang. Unfortunately, for some reason, the Zhang family collapsed without good reason. Most of the Zhang family’s direct descendants died. Zhang Jing vanished and when he appeared again, he was already the Holy Spirit Association’s Ox Demon. The Guardian he fused with should be of pure Strength and Constitution. He doesn’t have any long-range attacks, but his Strength, Constitution, and Speed are alarmingly powerful.”

After a pause, Zhang Chunqiu said, “According to some clues, the Zhang family’s decline might be related to the dimension, but it hasn’t been confirmed.”

“You know very well,” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile.

“After all, we share the same Zhang surname. I do pay a little attention,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

As the two of them spoke, Ox Demon had already killed three Golden Battle Gods. His bravery was awe-inspiring.

“Is this the strength of the Holy Spirit Association? Just an Ox Demon is already so terrifying. I wonder how strong Ya is now.”

“After all, he’s an expert who once made a name for himself on the same battlefield as Human Sovereign. Ya’s strength is definitely extraordinary.”

“Back then, Ya could already defeat a Calamity-grade entity who descended with a borrowed body. Now, he might be able to defeat a true Calamity-grade existence.”

People were very curious about Ya. Outsiders only knew Ya, but they didn’t know that he was Wang Mingyuan’s student, Zhong Ziya.

In the League of Guardians, Blood Shaman wore a nasty expression. The way he stared at Ox Demon was somewhat terrifying.

Over the past few days, the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association had fought quite a number of times. Blood Shaman and Ox Demon were old rivals. Their combat methods were somewhat similar. They relied on their bodies to fight, but Blood Shaman had never been able to gain an advantage over Ox Demon.

“Your Excellency, if the Holy Spirit Association manages to leave its name on the rankings, the influence it has on the Federation cannot be underestimated. It will be very disadvantageous for us,” Hermit said.

“They found Thief Sage ahead of us. Without a spatial expert at Thief Sage’s level, it will be very troublesome for us to enter the Venusian dimensional zone,” Cave Era said.

“Actually, we can use Jiuyue,” Hermit said.

“We would have used him if he could be used. Jiuyue has a good impression of the Holy Spirit Association. Although he’s a Guardian, he has always refused to join the League of Guardians. How can he be used? Do you dare use his services?” Cave Era said.

“There will be a way. Your Excellency, please leave this matter to me. I will definitely be able to make Jiuyue work for us.” Hermit requested Immortal’s permission.

Immortal said indifferently, “To clear the Venusian dimensional zone, one needs flawless cooperation.”

“I understand. I will definitely make Jiuyue willingly serve us.” Hermit understood what Immortal meant and promised.

As they spoke, Ox Demon had already destroyed six Golden Battle Gods with his own strength. It left everyone amazed.

However, everyone knew that this was only the beginning. What followed was the true test of the Holy Spirit Association’s strength. Not anyone could block a Calamity-grade bullet.

After the six Golden Battle Gods died, Ya led his team towards the door.

Fairy Peacock and True Martial flanked him, while Ox Demon walked behind. Liu Yun followed right at the back.

Everyone stared at Ya, wanting to know how he was going to block the Calamity-grade bullet.

Bang!

A gunshot sounded. When everyone saw it, they realized that Ya had already raised the Primordial Immortal Sword in front of him. Sparks flew as a bullet was blocked.

“How is this possible? He actually blocked it? How did he react?” Li Xuan, who was watching, gaped in shock.

Zhou Wen was also watching the battle. He pointed at Peacock Fairy and True Martial and said, “That’s not Ya’s strength alone. He has been augmented by the powers of the other two. They seem to have some kind of halo-like power.”

“I see. I wonder what power they augmented Ya with. It actually allowed Ya to react under such circumstances and even pull out his sword to block the bullet.” Li Xuan didn’t pay attention to Peacock Fairy and True Martial. After taking a careful look, he realized that they were responsible for the feat.

The average person couldn’t tell that Peacock Fairy and True Martial had played a major role. They just saw Ya quickly brandish his Primordial Immortal Sword, blocking three bullets.

“Holy sh*t, as expected of Ya. He’s too powerful. He feels even more powerful than those Calamity-grade creatures.”

“We have strong ones among us humans. He looks even more ferocious than the dwarf and Dragon Turtle.”

“This is too powerful. Could it be that Ya is already at the Calamity grade?”

While everyone praised the team, Zhang Chunqiu observed the cracks beneath True Martial’s feet and said lightly, “True Martial is a talent.”

“That Peacock Fairy is quite interesting.” Xia Liuchuan looked at the fan in Fairy Peacock’s hand with piqued interest.

The members of the League of Guardians didn’t look too good. It looked like the Holy Spirit Association had made ample preparations. Perhaps they could really leave their names on the rankings.

However, everyone knew that the seventh shot was the true test. Whether one could withstand the seventh shot was key to reaching the Golden Palace. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Zhou Wen was somewhat worried for Zhong Ziya. He could naturally tell that Zhong Ziya was only at the Terror grade and hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade. He had also designed a special skill combination to block the bullet. However, Zhou Wen didn’t know if this method was effective against the seventh bullet.

However, their battle gave Zhou Wen some hope.

The Calamity-grade creature kept firing at Ya, but it didn’t attack Peacock Fairy and True Martial. This meant that the creature still followed the same behavioral pattern as in-game. It would first kill creatures with higher levels and strength.

If that was the case in real life, his Companion Beasts like Grim Reaper No. 10 could be put to use. They could be used to block bullets at critical moments.

Of course, perhaps the creature was in a good mood and didn’t want to kill them all.

The Holy Spirit Association members had already rushed into the tunnel. As they advanced, they blocked the bullets. Soon, they finished blocking the first six bullets.

Everyone held their breaths as their hearts raced uncontrollably. They were like criminals awaiting judgment. Regardless of whether they were friend or foe, all of them wanted to know if the Holy Spirit Association could block the critical seventh shot.

“It’s impossible to block the seventh sure-kill strike with a Terror-grade power. I’m afraid they’ll throw a life at it. I wonder who will die?” Hermit sneered.

Most of the people who knew the inside story had similar thoughts as Hermit. The seventh shot could only be neutered with death.
