Chapter 1857: Nine Tribulations Devil Seed

Translator: CKtalon

Karoman said that these creatures were the pets of the Devil King. Apocalypse-grade ones were rather dangerous.

If these fellows really came to life after shattering the crystal, it was also a question if he could control them.

Although they were all pets of the Devil King, and, in theory, they should be considered Demonic Neonate’s pets, who knew if they were still loyal to the Devil King? Even if they were loyal to the Devil King, they might not be loyal to Demonic Neonate. Furthermore, these fellows hadn’t died in the battle against the Devils. That was problematic in itself.

“What’s on your mind?” Karoman asked in puzzlement when it saw Zhou Wen staring blankly at the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed.

“I’m wondering if the fellows inside are dead. If they are already dead, they are treasures, don’t you think?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

When Karoman heard that, its eyes lit up. “That’s right. If you can break these crystals, let’s dig out the New World fragments of these fellows inside. With so many Apocalypse-grade fragments, just the New World fragments dug out can make us invincible. When the time comes, forget Wang Mingyuan, even if Wang Mingyuan’s father comes, we will beat him until he calls me granddaddy.”

The dimension had always respected the strong. Karoman didn’t find anything wrong with plundering the power of other lives.

With Zhou Wen planting a thought in it, it immediately had designs on the Devil King pets.

“I’m afraid the fellows inside aren’t completely dead. After I open the crystal, it will be troublesome if they come back to life,” Zhou Wen said with feigned hesitation.

When Karoman heard that, it immediately said, “That shouldn’t be a problem. Previously, when crystals grew out of my body, I knew how powerful they were. It will be fine revealing these fellows’ weak spots as long as you don’t shatter the entire crystal and only shatter a portion. They won’t be able to move even if they are still alive.”

“Not a bad idea. Let’s give it a try. Do you know what weaknesses the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed has?” Zhou Wen said as he sized up the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed.

Karoman thought for a moment and said, “The Nine Tribulations Devil Seed is a very terrifying creature. It was very weak when it was born. It was even weaker than the weakest creature in the dimension. It couldn’t even reach the Mythical stage. However, its evolution ability was extremely terrifying. As long as there were enough resources, it could constantly evolve without any limitations. It’s not like ordinary creatures with limited talent. No matter how hard they work, it’s difficult for them to advance to the next level.

“Legend has it that after a Demon Seed advances to the Apocalypse grade, its body will stop evolving when it reaches a certain level. Then, it will transcend a tribulation and be reborn. It will once again fall from the top of the pyramid to the bottom and evolve again. This time, after reaching the Apocalypse grade, its upper limit will become even higher. It can go further in the Apocalypse grade. When it reaches its limit again, it will transcend a tribulation and be reborn. After that, it will become stronger every time it transcends a tribulation and returns to the Apocalypse grade. It can be said to be a terrifying existence that grows infinitely.

“I heard that the Devil Seed by the Devil King’s side had undergone nine tribulations and rebirth. That’s why it’s called the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed. Such a creature’s body has almost evolved to a perfect level. It’s almost impossible to find flaws in it,” said Karoman after some thought.

“After all that talk, it doesn’t have any weaknesses?” Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless. “Weren’t you just spouting nonsense?”

“I’m saying that others can’t find the weakness of the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed, it doesn’t mean that I can’t find it.” Karoman felt that it was being looked down on and immediately said, “According to what I know, the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed beside the Devil King didn’t evolve perfectly. Although it has undergone nine tribulations and should theoretically be perfect, it had secretly eaten another pet raised by the Devil King before it transcended the tribulation. It angered the Devil King and was slapped in the face by him, causing one of its ears to go deaf. After that, despite transcending the tribulation and being reborn, it couldn’t recover the damage to its ear. It left behind a fatal flaw.”

“I see. Which ear do you think its damaged ear is?” Zhou Wen sized up the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed and realized that on its huge head, there were seven ears on each side making a total of fourteen ears. Each ear was bigger than an island. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“It should be the ear on the left. It’s hard to say which one it is,” said Karoman.

Zhou Wen carefully observed the seven ears on the left side of the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed. From the outside, he didn’t discover any damage.

However, on second thought, it made sense. The Nine Tribulations Devil Seed had experienced nine tribulations and was reborn. Its external injuries had long healed. It was impossible to tell. It was probably an internal injury.

“In that case, let’s try one by one.” Zhou Wen flashed to the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed’s ear and slashed out with his hand, shattering the crystal outside its left ear.

Not long after, a huge ear appeared. Zhou Wen kept observing the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed. Seeing that it didn’t move, he slashed at the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed’s ear.

With a clang, In the Human World’s power slashed at the ear, leaving a shallow wound. Although it was a few centimeters deep, this wound was almost negligible to the huge Nine Tribulations Devil Seed.

“Let me do it. The Nine Tribulations Devil Seed has undergone nine tribulations. Its body has already evolved to the extreme. Ordinary Apocalypse-grade creatures can’t injure its body. You’ll have to depend on me,” said Karoman as the horn on its head lit up. It lowered its head and transformed into a shocking beam of light that struck the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed’s ear.

Clang!

With a shocking bang, Karoman retreated and its body swayed in the air. It almost plummeted as though it was drunk.

Is this fellow really one of the strongest Apocalypse existences after the Immortal Thearch? Zhou Wen looked at the pathetic Karoman with a mixed look.

If the Apocalypse powerhouses in the dimension ranked after the Immortal Thearch were at such a level, it was only right that there was no king.

Karoman sobered up a little. Seeing Zhou Wen looking at it made it fly into a rage due to its embarrassment. Without a word, it lowered its head and made another charge.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Karoman slammed into it several times, but it failed to shatter the ear. It had already lot its bearings as he spun in the air.

Although Zhou Wen looked down on Karoman, it wasn’t weak. It could only be said that the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed was just too powerful.

If a pet of the Devil King is so terrifying, how strong was the Devil King back then? Zhou Wen pondered for a moment before summoning Demonic Neonate.

“Do you know it?” Zhou Wen pointed at the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed and asked Demonic Neonate.

Demonic Neonate gazed at it for a while before shaking her head at him.

“Get Grim Demon out,” Zhou Wen said to Demonic Neonate.

Demonic Neonate obediently pulled out the Demonic Sword and released Grim Demon.

“I almost suffocated to death...” Grim Demon shouted the moment he came out, but halfway through, he was shocked when he saw the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed. He even swallowed his words.

“Holy sh*t, Nine Tribulations Devil Seed, why is it here?” Grim Demon shouted as he retreated, as though he was very afraid of the Nine Tribulations Devil Seed.
