Chapter 842: Digging the Fiend Tomb

Translator: CKtalon

“Chunqiu, why did you bring him here?” an elder said with a frown when he saw Zhang Chunqiu bring Zhou Wen over.

“Uncle, Zhou Wen is proficient in many special reconnaissance-type Essence Energy Skills. As he might be able to help us discover the problem with the Fiend Tomb, I invited him over to take a look.” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say that Zhou Wen had requested to come.

“Hurry up. Don’t affect the others.” The elder frowned slightly but didn’t say anything else.

Zhang Chunqiu led Zhou Wen into the region of the Fiend Tomb. Zhou Wen could clearly see that the situation with the Fiend Stone Petrification had worsened. A small portion of the nearby mountain walls had already been petrified. The last time he had come, the Fiend Stones hadn’t covered such a large area.

Furthermore, there were more than ten Fiend Stone stone statues on the ground. They had different expressions and appearances. They were likely the Zhang family members who had run into the Fiend Tomb.

“How do you plan on investigating? Do you have any special needs?” Zhang Chunqiu asked Zhou Wen.

“I need to observe the Fiend Tomb up close. If possible, I would like to take a few photos,” Zhou Wen said.

“You can take pictures, but you have to be fast. Furthermore, when you approach the Fiend Tomb, you can’t exceed those lines or touch the Fiend Stones. Otherwise, you will end up like them.” Zhang Chunqiu pointed at the red lines in the sky. They were about ten meters away from the Fiend Tomb.

“Alright, can I go now?” Zhou Wen agreed immediately. At a distance of about ten meters, his phone could lock onto the tiny palm symbol and download the dungeon.

“Go. I hope you can discover something,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

Zhou Wen leaped into the air and used the Godfiend Life Providence to fly towards the Fiend Tomb. At the same time, he got Doctor Darkness to attach himself to him in his soul form and used his Eyes of Penetration to look at the Fiend Tomb.

In fact, the Eyes of Penetration didn’t have a good effect on things like metal and stone. Zhou Wen was only putting on a show for the Zhang family to prove that he had such abilities and wasn’t here to mess around.

When the Zhang family saw Zhou Wen’s eyes shoot out two beams at the Fiend Tomb like two searchlights, they looked at him curiously.

Zhou Wen pretended to take a look before taking out his phone to take a picture. In fact, the Eyes of Penetration couldn’t see the interior of the Fiend Tomb through the thick Fiend Stones. Zhou Wen circled the Fiend Tomb and took the opportunity to snap a picture of the tiny palm symbol.

The game immediately entered the download screen, allowing Zhou Wen to relax.

After pretending to look around the Fiend Tomb seriously for a while, Zhou Wen returned to the stone platform.

“How is it?” When Zhang Chunqiu asked Zhou Wen, the other Zhang family members looked at him.

“I can’t tell anything for the time being. I’ll go back and think about it. Perhaps I can figure out something,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright.” Zhang Chunqiu took Zhou Wen back without another word.

After Zhou Wen returned to his residence, he couldn’t wait to open the Fiend Tomb dungeon that he had just downloaded. Firstly, he was very curious about the Fiend Tomb dungeon, and secondly, he hoped to help the Zhang family. He didn’t wish to see Zhang Yuzhi’s family destroyed and for her to be sent to Sunset College.

The game had successfully downloaded. A picture of a white grave appeared on the phone’s screen. Under it were the words “Fiend Tomb.”

Zhou Wen clicked on the program and entered the game. What appeared in front of him was the crater in the mountain where the Fiend Tomb was. The tiny Fiend Tomb stood there, and the grayish-white Fiend Stones looked like snow under the moonlight.

Zhou Wen saw that there were many strange faces just like in real life on the Fiend Stone-filled ground. There were more than ten faces, but none of them belonged to the Zhang family who had transformed into Fiend Stones. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

According to Zhang Chunqiu, humans would only be petrified when they touched the Fiend Stones after the fiend faces appeared. They hadn’t discovered any similar problems back when they touched the Fiend Stones.

Zhou Wen believed in this. Tyrant Behemoth had previously eaten a Fiend Stone, and it wasn’t a problem.

Zhou Wen summoned a few different types of pets and made them land on the ground. As expected, they were all petrified.

Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth again to see if it would be petrified. After all, it had eaten Fiend Stones before.

Tyrant Behemoth landed on the Fiend Stones, but its feet also showed signs of Fiend Stone Petrification. However, it was at a slower speed.

It’s actually suffering from Fiend Stone Petrification as well? After Zhou Wen ordered Tyrant Behemoth to use Absolute Strength, the Fiend Stone Petrification stopped.

Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief. Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth was still strong enough. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be easy for him to enter the Fiend Tomb.

As there was no entrance to the Fiend Tomb, he could only dig it open with brute force. This heavy responsibility could only be placed on Behemoth.

The Zhang family had an ancestral rule that the Fiend Tomb couldn’t be dug open. Otherwise, the Goddess Ba would awaken. When that happened, everything would be incinerated. Humans would have no chance of survival.

In reality, Zhou Wen definitely didn’t dare dig either, but in-game, there were naturally no taboos.

Under Zhou Wen’s command, Behemoth, who had activated Absolute Strength, slammed into the Fiend Tomb. The two horns on its head spun like an electric drill, immediately causing sparks to splatter everywhere on the Fiend Tomb. Fiend Stone powder splattered everywhere.

Just as Behemoth began digging the grave, the fiend faces on the ground suddenly seemed to come to life. They burrowed out from the ground and transformed into Fiend Stone statues.

The Fiend Stone statues pounced at Tyrant Behemoth without a word. Zhou Wen hurriedly sent out a few Companion Beasts to fight, preventing them from disturbing Tyrant Behemoth’s grave digging.

As it was only a test, the Companion Beasts Zhou Wen sent out weren’t his main combat pets. They were all Epic Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors. The only Mythical Companion Beast was a Golden Battle God Halberd.

The speed and strength of the Fiend Stone statues looked like they were at the Epic stage. However, after their bodies were shattered, they quickly revived inside the Fiend Stones. They couldn’t be killed no matter how hard he tried.

Furthermore, anything touched by the Fiend Stone statues would be petrified. It was very difficult to deal with them.

As the Fiend Tomb was dug open, more and more fiend faces appeared around it. They transformed into Fiend Stone statues that rushed to Behemoth’s side.

Thankfully, Behemoth in Absolute Strength was indeed an invincible existence. The Fiend Stone statues grabbed at its body, but they were unable to petrify it. They wrapped around Behemoth like a nest of ants.

Is there no way to completely kill them? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He had already tried many Strength attributes, but they were useless. He could shatter the Fiend Stone statues, but he couldn’t stop them from reviving inside the Fiend Stones.

Furthermore, the game didn’t have any indication of successfully killing them. Clearly, shattering them wasn’t enough to kill them.
