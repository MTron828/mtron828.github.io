Chapter 946: Top Rank Changes

Translator: CKtalon

Oh no, he didn’t block it. Zhou Wen was alarmed.

Will the same thing happen again? Zhang Chunqiu looked at Ya, who was burning with fiend flames, and muttered to himself with a frown.

Many people in the six families were very disappointed. Although they didn’t know who Ya was, there was no doubt that Uesugi Nao was from overseas. Most people still supported Ya.

However, Ya’s body didn’t explode like the Heavy-Armored Titan. Although his body was burning with fiend flames, he was still brandishing his sword to attack. The terrifying fiend flames seemed like an illusion that didn’t exist. They failed to damage his body.

After blocking a few more strikes, Uesugi Nao realized that Ya hadn’t exploded. Even his clothes and armor weren’t burned. She was filled with puzzlement.

How can there be no reaction? Could there really be a sinless person in this world? No way. He must have the ability to restrain the Purgatory Fiend Flames that prevented him from being killed. Uesugi Nao felt depressed.

The Purgatory Fiend Flames were extremely powerful, but there was a condition. That person had to commit a sin before the Purgatory Fiend Flames could be effective.

Pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, lust, and so on were all Original Sins. No one in the world had no Original Sin at all. Therefore, the Purgatory Fiend Flames were practically invincible against humans. The heavier the Original Sins, the stronger the damage target received.

Back then, Heavy-Armored Titan had been killed by the Purgatory Fiend Flames because its owner had committed too many massacres. Furthermore, it had also committed the sins of wrath and gluttony. This led to its explosion. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

However, Ya was completely unaffected. Uesugi Nao found it impossible.

Soon, the people from the Federation and overseas realized that Great Skyfiend’s attack didn’t seem to have any effect on Ya. The people from the Federation were naturally overjoyed, but the great devils overseas had solemn expressions.

The battle continued. The situation was already somewhat disadvantageous for Uesugi Nao. She knew that she had to defeat Ya as soon as possible. Time wasn’t on her side.

From the looks of it, I can only use Great Skyfiend’s Wheel of Destiny. Uesugi Nao made up her mind as she stared at Ya through her visor. The demonic aura on her body quickly converged.

Suddenly, Uesugi Nao’s figure vanished. When she appeared again, she was already behind Ya.

Crack!

Ya’s body had been sliced apart at the waist at some point in time.

Everyone was horrified. Even Zhou Wen couldn’t tell how Uesugi Nao had killed Ya. It wasn’t a matter of speed. No matter how fast a Mythical creature was, it was impossible for Zhou Wen, who had powerful eyesight, to not see its trajectory.

Zhou Wen really didn’t see anything. Uesugi Nao’s body seemed to vanish when she completed the strike.

It wasn’t teleportation either. This was because attacks could only be delivered after completing the teleportation. As for Uesugi Nao’s strike, it was completed when she disappeared. This was different from teleportation.

Many experts from the Federation felt their hearts turn cold as they felt a chill run down their spines. If Uesugi Nao used this strike against them, few had the confidence of dodging it.

Uesugi Nao’s expression didn’t look good when she saw Ya’s body split into two. This was because she felt that something was amiss when she killed Ya. She quickly retreated.

Suddenly, the two halves of the corpse turned into a broken puppet. The other Ya appeared where he had been standing when he first entered the arena.

Everyone was stunned. They couldn’t believe that Ya, who had fought with Uesugi Nao for so long, was actually a puppet.

Uesugi Nao’s expression turned nasty. She had already used her strongest strike, so it was impossible for her to deliver a second strike in a short period of time. Now, she understood why the Purgatory Fiend Flames were useless against Ya. It was because it wasn’t Ya, but a puppet.

Primordial Immortal Sword automatically returned to the true Ya’s hand. He held the Primordial Immortal Sword and stared at Uesugi Nao like a devil.

At that moment, everyone felt that Ya was as powerful as a devil. This wasn’t a feeling brought about by strength, but a psychological pressure.

Regardless of whether Ya’s true strength could defeat Uesugi Nao, his ability to toy with his opponent was even more terrifying than his true destructive power.

The unknown was most terrifying. Once a certain power was known by others and had psychological expectations, the horror instilled would decrease. The present Ya felt unfathomable and terrifying.

Uesugi Nao didn’t hesitate and chose to forfeit. She knew very well that she had lost this time because of the unequal intelligence between them. If she continued fighting, there was only death.

If she wanted to defeat her opponent, she had to first figure out her opponent’s abilities. She no longer had that chance.

With Uesugi Nao’s withdrawal, the first name on the ranking became Ya. As for Great Skyfiend, it retreated to second place. All the Guardians and Companion Beasts on the ranking automatically dropped by one.

Ya’s entire body was covered, and no one could tell what expression he had. After obtaining victory, he left the void arena.

“He’s really too strong. As expected of the owner of Primordial Sword Immortal. Just a puppet made Great Skyfiend retreat.”

“He’s practically invincible. Primordial Sword Immortal is powerful, but its owner is even more terrifying. I don’t think there will be any more surprises in this ranking battle, right?”

The citizens of the Federation were amazed at Ya’s strength. This name quickly spread throughout the Federation. Some people viewed him as a hero.

Zhou Wen didn’t think so. Ya was indeed very strong, but the combat strength displayed by Uesugi Nao was also very terrifying. It could only be said that Ya won because of his successful strategy.

However, the same strategy might not succeed a second time. Therefore, it was difficult to say if he could maintain first place.

After returning to campus, Zhou Wen saw many reports regarding Ya. As Ya was likely from the Federation, the various media outlets of the Federation touted Ya as a hero. They held him in high esteem, raising the enthusiasm of the Federation citizens. They kept guessing who Ya was.

After Zhou Wen read the report, he smiled bitterly to himself. If Ya is really Zhong Ziya, it’s hard to tell if he’s a hero or a devil to the Federation.

The battle between the two pumped zeal and ardor through Zhou Wen’s vessels. He had the urge to fight personally.

However, Zhou Wen quickly regained his rationality. He felt that grinding dungeons was more practical. Unfortunately, he couldn’t find opponents like Ya and Great Skyfiend in-game.

If only I could scan them into the game, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

After Feng Qiuyan applied for leave, the three of them were prepared to set off. To their surprise, after hearing of the matter, Li Xuan joined them. They set off as a group of four.

“After watching Ya and Great Skyfiend’s battle, I feel like getting a Guardian to play with.” On the way, Li Xuan mentioned the battle.

“Guardians are external forces after all. It’s not good.” Feng Qiuyan clearly rejected Guardians. He wished to become stronger by himself.

“Old Zhou, what do you think? How does it feel to have a Guardian?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen.

“I don’t know. I’ve only killed a few Guardians and never had one,” Zhou Wen said.
