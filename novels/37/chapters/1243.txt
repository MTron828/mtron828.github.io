Chapter 1244: Aurora

Translator: CKtalon

With An Tianzuo saying that, Blood Shaman and the other Guardians subconsciously retreated. No one attacked again.

If it were anyone else counting down, they probably wouldn’t have bothered. However, it was An Tianzuo. That made things completely different. They still felt a little afraid deep down.

The moment they retreated, An Tianzuo attacked with all his might. At the same time, he said, ‘0.’

Holy sh*t, isn’t this a scam? Zhou Wen was also waiting for the outcome, but to his surprise, there was a 0 after 1.

As no one attacked An Tianzuo again, An Tianzuo no longer needed to be restrained. He aimed all his firepower at a Terror-grade Guardian and riddled it with holes before blasting it in midair..

Cave Era and company were furious, but since 0 had already been said, they didn’t dare charge forward.

What was even more infuriating was that after 0 was said, everyone was waiting for something to happen, but nothing happened. It only gave An Tianzuo the opportunity to kill two more Guardians.

“An Tianzuo!” Cave Era was infuriated. If they hadn’t been fooled by him, they wouldn’t have been thrown into a panic. They might have already forced An Tianzuo into a corner.

“The legendary four great war gods are only this and nothing more. They are just treacherous people,” Hermit said coldly.

An Tianzuo’s expression remained unchanged as he said indifferently, “Did you hear that?”

“Hear what?” When Cave Era realized that An Tianzuo didn’t look like he was joking, she felt that something was amiss.

“My voice,” An Tianzuo said.

“What about your voice?” Hermit’s heart skipped a beat as he hurriedly asked.

An Tianzuo said indifferently, “There’s nothing to be heard yet. However, I can only say that the four, only the four Heavenly Kings of the League of Guardians are only this and nothing more.”

Many officers of the Sunset Army found it odd. They didn’t hear anything special. An Tianzuo was speaking, but the voice he was referring to clearly wasn’t his.

Zhou Wen could roughly guess what An Tianzuo had done, but he couldn’t tell the exact location.

When Cave Era and Hermit heard that, their expressions changed drastically. Hermit shouted, “Not good. Cave Era, quickly return and take a look.”

Cave Era reacted faster than Hermit. She had already grabbed Blood Shaman and vanished under the effects of temporal powers, returning to the headquarters of the League of Guardians.

Hermit also escaped without any hesitation. An Tianzuo knew that Hermit’s strength was strange. If he was focused on escaping, it would probably be difficult to stop him. Therefore, he didn’t try.

However, the remaining Terror-grade Guardians were doomed. An Tianzuo unleashed a massacre as he killed all the Guardians that were fleeing in all directions. In the end, not a single one of them escaped.

Cave Era used temporal powers to bring Blood Shaman back to the headquarters of the League of Guardians. When she saw that the headquarters was safe and sound, she heaved a sigh of relief. However, her expression turned extremely ugly the next moment.

A strange sound spread in the air and pierced her eardrums, causing them to hurt.

Cave Era instantly flew into the air and looked in the direction of Skysplit Tower. This glance made her shiver from head to toe as she hovered there in a daze. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The so-called Skysplit Tower was an unfinished spatial teleportation station that the League of Guardians had spent a huge price and a massive amount of resources to build with the help of the dimension. Up to now, it had yet to be completed.

However, in recent years, some basic functions had been usable. Many Guardians of the League of Guardians had teleported here using the Skysplit Tower.

It could be said that the Skysplit Tower was the greatest capital of the League of Guardians. Without the Skysplit Tower, there were no dimensional resources, so the foundation that allowed the League of Guardians to dominate the other factions was gone.

The Skysplit Tower was near the headquarters of the League of Guardians. It was like a huge cylinder that passed through the clouds and into the sky.

Due to the importance of the Skysplit Tower, Blood Shaman and Uesugi Nao would take turns guarding it. In addition, there were many Terror-grade Guardians nearby.

With Cave Era guarding the headquarters, it was impossible for anyone to approach Skysplit Tower.

However, for this excursion, most of the Guardians who were good at reconnaissance and tracking had been deployed to pursue An Tianzuo. Blood Shaman had also been deployed. Apart from Uesugi Nao, who was left in Skysplit Tower, Cave Era had also left the headquarters.

Without a doubt, this was the period when Skysplit Tower’s defense was at its weakest. But even so, it wasn’t something that an ordinary person could approach.

Indeed, no one approached Skysplit Tower. However, an aurora-like beam streaked across the sky from the south, turning the night into day. When the aurora struck Skysplit Tower, it seemed to pierce through the huge Skysplit Tower like a drill. It had already fractured and collapsed. The tilting tower fell to the ground.

Boom!

Amidst the strange rumbling, the ground trembled like an earthquake. The shockwave stirred up rocks and mud, sweeping out like a tsunami.

Everything within dozens of kilometers was reduced to ruins as though the end of the world had arrived.

Cave Era watched as the aurora streaked across the sky like a rainbow. It lasted for nearly thirty seconds before it completely vanished. The sky turned dark again.

Cave Era rushed to the ruins of Skysplit Tower and saw that the originally thousand-meter-tall Skysplit Tower was now less than a hundred meters tall. The other parts had already collapsed.

And in Skysplit Tower, there were no signs of life. There should have been many members of the League of Guardians inside, but now, not a single person could be seen.

Even the signatures of life remained pathetic dozens of kilometers away. Very few of the Guardians situated along the lines of defense were left.

Many alarmed Guardians crawled out of the rubble with ashen faces. They still didn’t know what had happened. They no longer had their usual arrogance. Their faces were filled with confusion and horror.

Looking at the scene in front of her, Cave Era could only feel a bone-chilling coldness spreading in her heart.

“This is his voice?” Cave Era muttered to herself as her body involuntarily trembled.

Thinking of the man’s casual words, Cave Era found it akin to a devil’s curse.

“Cough.” Uesugi Nao, who was wearing the Great Skyfiend armor, crawled out of the Skysplit Tower’s base. Her Terror-grade Guardian armor was covered in cracks. Filthy blood mixed with mud stained her body and messy hair. Even standing up from the ground looked very difficult.

“Cave Era, what happened?” Uesugi Nao asked in agitation. She had nearly died in the Skysplit Tower.

“I also want to know what happened.” Although Uesugi Nao wasn’t dead, Cave Era couldn’t bring herself to feel happy. The coldness in her heart continued spreading.

The cost of building the Skysplit Tower was great. The damage was too much for them to bear. Furthermore, no one knew if there would be a second aurora, nor did they know where it would descend next.

The humans and beasts within a few hundred kilometers saw the aurora that penetrated the sky and the destruction of the towering Skysplit Tower. Instantly, the entire Federation was in an uproar.

All sorts of videos instantly filled the Internet. The aurora shocked the entire world.
