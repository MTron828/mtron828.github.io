Chapter 808: Legend of the Gu God

Translator: CKtalon

“I’ve already warned that fellow not to drive the speedboat into the Dragon Corpse River, but he refused to listen. I’m afraid he’s dead. That little girl sure is lucky to still be alive. However, without her family, how can she survive at such a young age? What a sin!” As the man spoke, he was about to rush over to help when he suddenly saw a huge creature rush out of the water.

“Heavens... Dragon King Gu... That’s the Dragon King Gu...” The men immediately trembled when they saw the huge creature. They were so frightened that they forgot to escape. Their legs went limp and they couldn’t move at all.

To people who reared Gu, the Dragon King Gu was almost a god-like existence.

But at this moment, they saw the Dragon King Gu lower its head in the direction of the speedboat.

That girl is doomed! They all thought that the Dragon King Gu was going to eat that little girl.

To their surprise, after the Dragon King Gu lowered its head, they saw a person standing on its head. That person jumped down from the Dragon King Gu’s head and landed in the boat.

The group of people couldn’t believe their eyes. Someone actually dared to stand on the Dragon King Gu’s head. Furthermore, the Dragon Corpse River’s river water was extraordinary. Humans couldn’t touch the river water at all, or they would have the possibility of turning into zombies.

Yet, this person came out with the Dragon King Gu. Clearly, his entire body had already come into contact with the river.

They were even more shocked when they identified the person. That person was actually the young man they had seen previously. He didn’t seem to have suffered any injuries. What was even more exaggerated was that he even patted the head of the Dragon King Gu as though he was comforting his pet.

“Oh my god... Is he the reincarnation of a Gu God? How can the Dragon King Gu let a human touch its noble head...” Everyone was dumbfounded.

Zhou Wen also saw them and got Tai Sui to retreat into the river. It transformed back into an Ancient Tadpole at the bottom of the river and followed beside the speedboat.

Zhou Wen started the speedboat, causing a long wave to ripple across the river as it headed for the Dragon Corpse River’s exit.

“Gu God... That must be the Gu God...” A man shockingly watched the speedboat leave and muttered to himself. “How can humans treat the Dragon King Gu like a pet? Only a god could have such power, and it has to be a Gu God.”

From then on, there were legends of the Dragon King Gu and Gu God in the vicinity of the Dragon Corpse River. Someone even built a Gu God statue near the Dragon Corpse River.

A mysterious young man, holding a little girl’s hand, stood on the head of the Dragon King Gu, as though he was about to ride the dragon to fly away.

Later on, the legend of the Gu God was accepted by more and more people who reared Gu. Many of them in the South District would worship the Gu God, but that was something far into the future.

After taking the Dragon King Gu out of the Dragon Corpse River, Zhou Wen set off for Mong Hsat. After meeting Gu Shanshui, he returned to Luoyang.

Although Mute wasn’t around to lead the way, Zhou Wen had already memorized the route. With the chick, Tai Sui, and Ya’er around, he didn’t encounter any danger.

On the way back, Zhou Wen kept studying the fusion problem of Ancient Splitting Tadpole. Zhou Wen’s ideal combination was to fuse the Ancient Splitting Tadpole and Primordial Spore. If he could produce a Primordial Spore that could split through fusion, he would be invincible.

However, the compatibility between the two was just too low. It wasn’t even 20%. Furthermore, he didn’t know what the outcome would be after the fusion, so he didn’t dare try it.

He matched the few Mythical Companion Beasts he already had with the Ancient Splitting Tadpole and realized that their compatibility was very low. The only one with a higher compatibility was Tai Sui, reaching a compatibility score of 69%.

This made Zhou Wen even more afraid of carrying out the fusion. Although the compatibility was very high, Tai Sui had the ability to restrain microorganisms. Even the Dragon King Gu was afraid of it. If it lost this ability after fusion, it wouldn’t be worth it.

Don’t tell me there’s no other fusion choices? Zhou Wen matched the few rare Epic Companion Beasts with the Ancient Splitting Tadpole and realized that the compatibility wasn’t high. The only one that was higher was the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

Why is this thing so odd? Those that have a high compatibility with it are strange Companion Beasts. I should wait and see. If there’s really no other choice, I can try the fusion using Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed as he gave up on the idea of fusing the Ancient Splitting Tadpole.

In fact, Zhou Wen hadn’t spent much time grinding recently because he was studying the First Order of Chaos, hoping to advance his Chaos Egg Life Soul to a Perfect Body.

The First Order of Chaos was like the Dao Sutra. They were Essence Energy Arts that mainly enhanced Essence Energy attributes. Zhou Wen wanted to give it a try and see if the Chaos Egg could raise his stats to 41 points if he advanced to a Perfect Body.

After Zhou Wen’s research, he discovered some ways to use the Chaos Egg. It had a very strong defense. Although it was only a Primordial Body, its defense was comparable to an ordinary Mythical creature’s.

Zhou Wen used Light Concealment Sword to cleave at the Chaos Egg and required two strikes to leave a mark.

If he used the Golden Overlord Sword, he could cleave it apart with one strike.

This was already rather sick. After all, it was only a Primordial Body. If it advanced to a Perfect Body, it might be able to withstand a Mythical attack without any injuries.

Also, Zhou Wen could rapidly recover from his injuries and replenish his Essence Energy inside the Chaos Egg. It was like a high-level recovery device.

The only pity was that the Chaos Egg didn’t have any offensive abilities. All it could do was defend and allow self-repair.

As the Chaos Egg’s ability was somewhat similar to Li Xuan’s Life Soul, Zhou Wen questioned the possibility of the Chaos Egg needing to be shattered before advancing.

He made a few attempts at injuring the Chaos Egg, but it quickly healed without becoming stronger.

Instead, the Chaos Egg seemed to become stronger after it helped treat his wounds.

It can’t be... Could it be that this thing can only evolve after treating my injuries? Could it be that I have to seek a beating for no reason? Zhou Wen was extremely depressed when he came to this conclusion.

However, the facts proved that the Chaos Egg was indeed becoming stronger when it healed his body.

Furthermore, the Chaos Egg was very strange. It would only become stronger after it treated different kinds of injuries that Zhou Wen sustained.

If it was the same kind of injury, although it would heal Zhou Wen, it wouldn’t become stronger.

I have to choose the style in which I’m beaten up. Isn’t this Life Soul too sick? Zhou Wen was so depressed that he nearly gave up on the Essence Energy Art.

However, after some thought, he couldn’t find any other substitute. All he could do was attempt to suffer different injuries in-game before getting the Chaos Egg to help him recover.

Bit by bit, the Chaos Egg grew stronger. By the time Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, the Chaos Egg was already showing signs of advancing to an Evolved Body.

“Little Wen, did you bring an illegitimate daughter back? Am I going to be a grandmother?” Not long after Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, Ouyang Lan suddenly visited him. She looked at Ya’er, who was sitting on the sofa, in pleasant surprise.
