Chapter 1565: Unlucky Egg

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen and Jiuyang stared at each other. Although they didn’t know the rules of the PVP match, they could guess that the two of them were definitely opposing competitors. Finishing off the opponent was definitely not wrong.

Jiuyang didn’t know that the Chaos Egg belonged to Zhou Wen, nor did he know what it was. However, he had a natural advantage in a place like Dubhe Palace. With the Sun God Armor, killing Starlord Ravenous Wolf was a possibility, so he naturally wouldn’t retreat.

Zhou Wen actually didn’t know Jiuyang because he hadn’t watched him when he cleared the level. In Regretless City, there wasn’t any Internet to read the news, so he didn’t know Jiuyang. All he knew was that there was such a person on the rankings.

Zhou Wen saw that Jiuyang was a human and didn’t wish to kill him. After all, he had only come this time to return through the teleportation nexus. He had no intention of rushing up the rankings, so he ignored Jiuyang and went straight for Dubhe Palace’s door.

“Wait.” Jiuyang suddenly shouted at him.

“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen asked Jiuyang.

“Are you human?” Jiuyang was slightly taken aback when he heard Zhou Wen’s voice. He imagined that there would be a high-level dimensional creature inside the Chaos Egg, but his voice sounded human.

“So what if I am?” Zhou Wen asked.

Zhou Wen’s answer immediately excited the Federation citizens.

Very few humans could enter Dubhe Palace. Now, many people were guessing who the human in the Chaos Egg was and if he was a human with a Guardian.

Although humans with Guardians were pure humans, they weren’t as welcomed as humans who took Mythical Serums.

Saints like Jiuyang who came from the Holy Land were even more unpopular.

People still had some fantasies before they saw who the person inside the Chaos Egg was. They hoped that it was a human who had relied on his own abilities to rush into Dubhe Palace and not a human who had borrowed the power of a Guardian.

“As a human, I’ll give you a way out. Follow me and don’t do anything,” Jiuyang said to Zhou Wen.

Everyone understood what Jiuyang meant. If Zhou Wen were to vie for the rankings with him, Zhou Wen would die. If he didn’t compete with him and followed his every order, he would still live.

Everyone looked at Zhou Wen and waited for his answer.

Although many people felt that fighting Jiuyang in a place like Dubhe Palace was no different from courting death, most people still hoped that they could fight. After all, it was human nature to enjoy spectacles.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen agreed immediately.

He had no intention of competing with Jiuyang for the ranking. It was meaningless because if he didn’t clear the Big Dipper instance dungeon, he wouldn’t be able to obtain the rewards. There was no point in competing.

Now, all Zhou Wen wanted to do was quickly return to Earth. He didn’t want to invite trouble.

Zhou Wen’s answer left Jiuyang slightly taken aback. He never expected the other party to immediately cower.

However, since he had cowered, Jiuyang didn’t have any intention of killing him. He glanced at Zhou Wen and said, “I hope you know what you should and shouldn’t do. Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself.”

With that said, Jiuyang walked towards Dubhe Palace’s door.

“How boring. He gave up just like that. He’s not a man at all.”

“That’s a wise decision. To fight Jiuyang in a place like Dubhe palace when he has the power of the Sun God is no different from throwing an egg at a rock.”

“It’s no wonder he wears an egg on the outside. He’s just an unlucky egg. It wasn’t easy for him to attempt the Cube’s rankings. I reckon he only wanted to rush to the teleportation nexus, but he ended up so unlucky. He activated the Cube at the same time as Saint Jiuyang and entered some PVP mode. Thankfully Jiuyang is kind. Otherwise, he can only blame it on his bad luck if he is killed.”

“Haha, Unlucky Egg. How apt.”

Soon, the words “Unlucky Egg” spread online. Looking at Zhou Wen, who was floating in the air and entering Dubhe Palace behind Jiuyang, they came to believe that the words “Unlucky Egg” suited him.

“Although it’s a little embarrassing, it’s better than fighting Jiuyang in a place like Dubhe Palace. It won’t be too late to settle scores with Jiuyang after he returns to Earth,” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile as he heaved a sigh of relief.

Zhang Chunqiu looked at the Chaos Egg in puzzlement and muttered to himself, “Strange.”

“What’s strange?” Xia Liuchuan looked at Zhang Chunqiu and asked.

“I know Zhou Wen quite well. With his personality, there’s no reason for him not to vie for first place unless he’s not attempting to clear the level. Although Jiuyang is powerful and has a natural advantage in Dubhe Palace, Zhou Wen is probably aiming for first place if he’s there. He has to defeat Jiuyang no matter what. Since he has to defeat Jiuyang, is there a need for him to compromise?” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“That makes sense.” Xia Liuchuan thought for a moment and felt that Zhang Chunqiu was right. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Back when Zhou Wen fought Xia Jiuhuang in that extremely difficult situation, Zhou Wen didn’t show a hint of cowardice.

“According to what you said, if he isn’t trying for the rankings, why did he go to Dubhe Palace?” Xia Liuchuan said after some thought.

“You’d have to ask him in person.” Zhang Chunqiu had no idea either.

They couldn’t guess that Zhou Wen was just using it as a waypoint.

Zhou Wen followed behind Jiuyang. Just as he entered Dubhe Palace, Starlord Ravenous Wolf released a terrifying blast of light that blasted at Jiuyang.

The Sun God Armor on Jiuyang’s body emitted a divine glow like the sun. When the power of the light blast landed on him, not only did it fail to injure him, but it also made the Sun God Armor even stronger.

This person’s Guardian is rather interesting. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be curious when he saw how magical the Sun God Armor was. It was much stronger than his Fire-Runic Divine Armor Queen. He sized up Jiuyang and the Sun God Armor from the Chaos Egg.

Zhou Wen had no idea that the Sun God Armor was created by the Sun God Holy Temple. It was the strongest sun-type Guardian that ordinary Guardians could compare with. Under the Sun God Holy Temple’s full efforts, it was already a Calamity-grade Guardian.

It wasn’t easy for the Sun God Holy Temple to chance upon Jiuyang, who was most compatible with the Sun God Guardian, before bestowing it upon him.

Jiuyang’s status in the Sun God Holy Temple was equivalent to Xiao’s status in the Trajectory Holy Temple.

Jiuyang didn’t disappoint the Sun God Holy Temple’s expectations. The last time he cleared Dubhe Palace, the Sun God Guardian was still at the Human Realm. In just a short span of time, it had already reached the Hell level.

Apart from having the full support of the Sun God Holy Temple, the main reason for that was that Jiuyang’s talent and Life Providence were highly compatible with the Sun God Guardian.

Jiuyang’s trip here was to kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf. He stood in the blast of light as the Sun God armor on his body shone like a blazing sun. He walked towards Starlord Ravenous Wolf against the terrifying blast of light.

Starlord Ravenous Wolf seemed to sense the pressure as he stood up from his throne.
