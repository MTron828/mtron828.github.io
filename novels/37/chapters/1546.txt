Chapter 1547: Devil King’s Food

Translator: CKtalon

Tyrant Behemoth placed the huge snake at the foot of the mountain. Tyrant Behemoth easily tore apart the huge snake after it lost its energy and life.

Not long after, Zhou Wen saw that a portion of the snake’s bones was blood-red and emitted strange energy. It was likely the body of a Calamity-grade creature.

These parts were stored in the Chaos Bead by Zhou Wen. They were good items obtained from a Calamity-grade creature. After advancing to the Calamity grade, he needed such high-energy flesh and bones to replenish his energy. Otherwise, he might really starve to death.

Tsukuyomi and company were examples. After leaving Earth, they had to hunt Calamity creatures to maintain their energy.

Inside the snake’s corpse, he discovered a Companion Egg. It excited Zhou Wen greatly. This was a Calamity-grade Companion Beast—an extremely rare drop.

There was too much snake meat left. Zhou Wen only stored a portion in his chaos space. The rest was used to improve the lives of the people in Regretless City.

Many people here had never eaten meat in their lives. They didn’t even know how to barbecue. It was only when Zhou Wen taught them barbecuing methods that they began eating roasted snake meat.

Just a mouthful of snake meat without any seasoning was sufficient to make many people cry in excitement.

“Long live the Devil King…” Many people praised Zhou Wen as they ate the snake meat.

In the distant valley, a tiny snake peeked its head out from the crack in the mountain. After watching for a while, it burrowed into the mountain and vanished.

“Your Devilish Excellency, this meat is delicious. I left you the best part.” Liz ran over with a bowl of snake meat and offered it to Zhou Wen.

“You can have it.” Calamity-grade snake meat was definitely delicious, but they were like barbarians. They ate it directly after roasting it. Ignoring cumin and chili powder, they didn’t even sprinkle any salt. Zhou Wen wasn’t used to this.

Furthermore, their roasting standards were terrible. Some spots weren’t properly cooked while other spots were charred.

“Your Devilish Excellency, this is specially for you. If Liz were to eat it, she would definitely be cursed to death by everyone.” Leem was much more lively. Although she still respected Zhou Wen, she wasn’t as reserved as before.

Perhaps because he had saved Regretless City, the sisters felt that the Devil King already treated them like family.

“Come over,” Zhou Wen called out to Liz.

Liz came over with a bowl and picked up a piece of snake meat. “Master, let me serve you.”

“Put it on the table.” Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. This place was too backward. There wasn’t even a knife or fork to eat, much less chopsticks. All they did was grab food with their hands.

Right, all they eat are grass, roots, and leaves. There’s no need for utensils.?Zhou Wen thought about it and understood their difficulties.

All Liz could do was place the bowl on the table. Zhou Wen took out his fork and knife and sliced off the parts that weren’t cooked and charred, leaving only a portion that was better roasted.

Then, he took out his barbecue seasonings and sprinkled them on the meat before cutting it into small pieces and slowly eating with chopsticks.

Zhou Wen preferred skewers, but these fellows roasted the meat in large chunks. He could only make do.

Liz and Leem widened their eyes as they watched Zhou Wen. They had never seen anyone eat like Zhou Wen. They felt that the chopsticks were like divine artifacts.

Master is indeed the Devil King. He looks so beautiful and elegant even when eating, Liz thought.

As for Leem, she was in a daze as she looked at the meat. She had an acute sense of smell. The fragrance emitted by the seasoned roasted meat was completely different from the original meat. The smell made Leem’s saliva involuntarily secrete quickly. She couldn’t help but gulp as her stomach rumbled.

They tried roasting meat and when their technique was passable, they immediately delivered Zhou Wen a piece of meat that was better roasted. They hadn’t even had a bite.

“I don’t want to eat this. Eat it. Don’t waste it.” Zhou Wen put down his chopsticks and walked back to his rocking chair. He lay down and took out his phone to check his information.

“Thank you, Master.” Liz and Leem saw that Zhou Wen’s chopsticks and fork were placed there, but they didn’t dare use them. All they did was carefully lift the roasted meat with their hands.

When the roasted meat entered their mouths, they first felt the saltiness from the salt and the spiciness from the chili powder, then the freshness of cumin. Finally, the tender meat and the fragrance of the meat juices seeped out and instantly filled their entire mouths.

This complex taste in the two sisters’ mouths inundated their taste buds. It was an experience they had never had. They felt as though their hearts had melted with this mouthful of roasted meat.

Is this the food the Devil King eats? It’s really delicious. It’s great to be serving the Devil King. Even if I were to die now, I wouldn’t have any regrets.?The two girls felt that they had lived all those years in vain.

If Zhou Wen knew what they were thinking, he would probably be at a loss whether to laugh or cry. Just a bit of roasted meat was enough to exchange for two lives. It was as though human lives were worth nothing.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to pay attention to them. He didn’t know what they were thinking either.

Zhou Wen was checking Tyrant Behemoth’s stats. The stats after Tyrant Behemoth’s evolution didn’t exceed Zhou Wen’s expectations.

Companion Form: Boxing Glove

The stats and skills were within Zhou Wen’s expectations. He mainly wanted to see what the Calamity Zone was. From the introduction, the Overlord Zone was likely a domain that enhanced strength.

Zhou Wen didn’t study it too much. He would slowly experiment when he had the chance in the future. Now, what Zhou Wen mainly wanted to study was the huge snake Companion Egg.

Zhou Wen had already stored the Companion Egg in-game and checked its stats.

Ancient Snake: Calamity

Companion Form: Staff

Zhou Wen carefully studied the Ancient Snake’s information and realized that it was a surprising Companion Beast. This was the first time he had seen a staff as a companion form.

Previously, he had heard that there were magic staff-type Companion Beasts in the West District. The magic staff itself came with magical spells.

However, the staff formed by the Ancient Snake was still somewhat different from ordinary magic staffs.

Zhou Wen didn’t think much of the Ancient Snake’s skill, but its Calamity Zone seemed rather interesting.
