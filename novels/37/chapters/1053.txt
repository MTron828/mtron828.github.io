Chapter 1054: Objective Accomplished

Translator: CKtalon

Grim Demon’s name spread across the world. Many people were studying Grim Demon’s abilities, but because there was too little information, they failed to figure out anything.

With no Guardian continuing the challenge, Zhou Wen finally heaved a sigh of relief.

Grim Demon wasn’t happy at all. He sat by the side dejectedly and drew randomly on the ground with a tree branch. As he drew, he muttered softly, “Why isn’t anyone challenging me... Why isn’t anyone challenging me...”

Zhou Wen pretended not to hear him. It was normal for Demonic Neonate to come out to take a breather since he was locked inside the sword.

I hope no one will challenge me in the remaining twenty hours, Zhou Wen prayed inwardly.

Ice Maiden secretly sized up Grim Demon and was extremely shocked. Previously, she had thought that Grim Demon was only an accessory and that his abilities were definitely not very strong. Otherwise, how could he be willing to be the Guardian of a Companion Beast? But from the looks of it, Grim Demon was a genuine Terror-grade existence. This left her even more alarmed.

Even the Guardian of a Companion Beast is at the Terror grade? Ice Maiden had never heard of such a thing in the past, nor did she know how Zhou Wen had done it.

Time ticked by. No one challenged Grim Demon again. Almost forty-eight hours later, someone finally challenged Grim Demon again. However, the person who challenged was Ya.

“Someone is challenging me!” Grim Demon stood up excitedly and was about to rush to the cube.

“Admit defeat immediately after entering,” Zhou Wen said lightly.

Grim Demon immediately deflated like a balloon. He looked at Zhou Wen with a look of resentment and asked, “Why? Don’t you want to get first place?”

“No, do as I say.” Zhou Wen wasn’t completely uninterested in first place. However, he still didn’t know the benefits and disadvantages.

Wang Mingyuan had once told him not to take first place again, so up to now, Zhou Wen hadn’t made up his mind.

Furthermore, it wasn’t that easy to obtain first place. It was unknown if there were any Terror-grade Guardians that were participating. However, Night Thearch and the one from Forbidden City who hadn’t participated in the battle were definitely at the Terror grade. Perhaps such terrifying existences would take action in the final infinite battle.

It probably wouldn’t be easy for Zhong Ziya to maintain his first place.

“I guarantee that as long as you let me fight, I will obtain first place.” Grim Demon looked at Zhou Wen with anticipation.

“I’ll get your help when I want first place.” Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate. Demonic Neonate seemed to understand Zhou Wen’s intentions as she glanced at Grim Demon.

Grim Demon immediately looked at the cube obediently and walked over. Zhou Wen exhorted, “Be careful when you go up. See if Ya will secretly pass you a message.”

“Got it,” Grim Demon answered listlessly as he entered the cube.

Ya didn’t pass any message. All he did was take back the first spot. If Zhou Wen had known that would happen, he wouldn’t have even sent Grim Demon. It was more straightforward to forfeit.

When the Federation citizens saw that first place had returned to Ya, they naturally understood that they were all in cahoots.

“Ya is already a Guardian. Grim Demon can’t be his, so who does Grim Demon belong to? If we can find Ya, we might be able to know who Grim Demon belongs to.”

“Which family are these people from? They have so many Mythical Companion Beasts, but they actually have Guardians like Ya and Grim Demon. It’s too terrifying.”

“Did you notice? Second place became Grim Demon, but after the Mythical Companion Beasts admitted defeat, they didn’t obtain a ranking. This is blatant discrimination.”

“What can we do about that? The future is the era of Guardians. Existences like Ya and Grim Demon are not something ordinary humans and Companion Beasts can deal with.”

“Instead of thinking about this, we might as well consider where to contract a Guardian that’s as powerful as Grim Demon.”

Zhou Wen saw Ya make a gesture before disappearing. It was the gesture Zhong Ziya had used every time he won back when they played cards together.

Only then did Zhou Wen feel relieved. Although he didn’t know what Ya had done, it looked like he had succeeded.

After putting away Ice Maiden and Grim Demon, he was just about to find Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan when his phone suddenly rang. It was a message from The Thearch.

“You contracted with Grim Demon?” The omniscient Thearch seemed to have a question for the first time.

“I have nothing to do with Grim Demon. Why are you asking?” Zhou Wen replied.

“If there’s nothing between you, would he have cooperated with your Companion Beast to stall for time? If there’s nothing, would he have given first place to Ya?” The Thearch said disdainfully.

“There’s really nothing between us.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to explain further lest he slipped up. With The Thearch’s shrewdness, she could easily guess something from his words.

“Although Grim Demon is very strong, contracting him is definitely not a good choice.” The Thearch seemed adamant that Zhou Wen was related to Grim Demon.

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. From The Thearch’s words, she seemed to know Grim Demon. Furthermore, Grim Demon was the first to be described as very strong by The Thearch.

Is Grim Demon really that strong? Zhou Wen had always felt that Grim Demon wasn’t that strong because he was too cowardly in front of Demonic Neonate. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

However, Zhou Wen now felt that perhaps what Grim Demon had said in the past wasn’t pure bragging.

“Then who’s a good choice? You?” Zhou Wen replied.

“You aren’t qualified to contract me.” The Thearch’s answer was very arrogant.

However, these words seemed to admit that she was also a Guardian, but he couldn’t be sure. It was also possible that The Thearch had deliberately said this to mislead him.

“However, if you do me a favor, I can consider giving you a chance.” The Thearch sent another message.

“What chance?” Zhou Wen was alarmed, but he asked the obvious.

“A chance to contract the strongest Guardian,” The Thearch said.

“Don’t tell me the strongest Guardian you are talking about is yourself?” Zhou Wen replied.

“Guess.”

“I’m not interested in guessing.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to play any guessing games with her. He bluntly said, “If the strongest Guardian you mentioned is you, I can consider it.”

The Thearch didn’t respond to the topic at hand. “Let’s continue our discussion after you obtain the Dimensional Wheel.”

“If I can obtain the Dimensional Wheel, I’ll be the Lord of Earth. What’s there to talk about?” Zhou Wen probed.

“Don’t tell me you really think that you will be the Lord of Earth after getting first place?” The Thearch replied.

“Didn’t they say that the Dimensional Wheel will bestow immense power? With absolute power, one will naturally be the Lord of Earth. Aren’t you also interested in the Dimensional Wheel?” Zhou Wen said.

“Let’s keep talking until you obtain the Dimensional Wheel,” The Thearch replied before going offline. She didn’t reply to Zhou Wen’s messages.

What does she want? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.
