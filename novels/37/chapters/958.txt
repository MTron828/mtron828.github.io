Chapter 959: Marine Dimensional Creatures Coming Ashore

“This is an artificial dimensional creature we are researching,” Hui Haifeng answered.

“Artificial dimensional creatures? How do you create them?” Zhou Wen knew nothing about this.

Hui Haifeng explained, “Dimensional creatures are somewhat different from Earth’s creatures. Earth’s creatures are basically carbon-based, but dimensional creatures are different. Although some dimensional creatures have flesh and blood, carbon isn’t the building blocks of their bodies. Research has shown that creatures on Earth are affected by the dimensional storms. Their bodies undergo some changes, causing some abnormal elements to appear in originally carbon-based matter.”

“Therefore, we extracted this element and attempted to culture and use it. Based on our present research, this element can rapidly mutate terran creatures. It’s even possible for them to mutate into lifeforms similar to dimensional creatures in a short period of time.” With that said, Hui Haifeng pointed at the creature in the culture tank excitedly. “This is the latest result. We used this element to successfully turn ordinary terran bacteria into a dimensional creature. Although it’s only at the most ordinary Mortal stage, this is already huge progress. In the future, we will conduct experiments on plants and animals. If everything goes well, perhaps one day, humans can become as powerful as dimensional creatures through the injection of this element.”

“Are there any side effects from injecting this element?” Zhou Wen asked worriedly.

“We haven’t discovered any side effects. Don’t worry, we will do rigorous experiments. We won’t let humans take risks easily.” Hui Haifeng continued, “Our goal is to let the human race evolve as a whole. The bodies of humans now are too weak. In the future, if humans can have powerful bodies like dimensional creatures and have a Life Providence and Life Soul at birth, we won’t have to be afraid of any invasion from dimensional creatures.”

“It sounds pretty good.” Zhou Wen nodded.

“However, we are still in the early stages. There’s still a long way to go before the real human trials. I hope that day won’t come too late,” Hui Haifeng said.

After leaving the laboratory, the two of them chatted about their past days in college and their current situation.

“You are native to Sea Return. Are there any special dimensional zones you can show me?” Zhou Wen still wanted to download more dungeons.

Hui Haifeng smiled and said, “If you want to see special dimensional zones, you’ve really come to the right place. Although there aren’t many people in Sea Return, there are quite a number of dimensional zones. They are on land and in the sea, but especially in the sea. You definitely won’t be able to see such places further inland.”

“What’s so special about them?” Zhou Wen was intrigued.

“There’s too much to tell. Sea God Reef, Undersea Blue Hole, Infinite Island, and so on are all extremely mysterious dimensional zones. Very few humans can enter them. Even the great devils overseas can only take a detour when they encounter these dimensional zones.” Hui Haifeng recounted the famous dimensional zones near Sea Return to Zhou Wen as if he knew everything.

“Since it’s still early, I’ll head to the nearby Sea God Reef to take a look,” Zhou Wen said.

“I still have work to do, so I can’t accompany you. Give me a moment. I’ll find a reliable person to guide you,” Hui Haifeng said. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“There’s no need to go through so much trouble. Feng Qiuyan from the Feng family is a member of our Xuanwen Club. He has also returned. He can be my guide,” Zhou Wen said.

“Look at me, almost forgetting this matter. It’s best if Feng Qiuyan goes with you.” Hui Haifeng pondered for a moment before reminding Zhou Wen, “Recently, Sea Return hasn’t been peaceful. There are many more break-out creatures coming ashore than before. I’m afraid something major will happen soon. Don’t go too deep. Just take a look at the coastal areas.”

After bidding Hui Haifeng farewell, Zhou Wen was just about to contact Li Xuan when he heard warning sirens in Sea Return City.

The ear-piercing sound echoed in the city. There weren’t many people on the streets originally, but suddenly, many people appeared, fleeing towards the underground bomb shelters.

“What happened?” Zhou Wen got a hold of someone and asked.

“Marine creatures have come ashore again. Aren’t you going to take refuge in the bomb shelter?” the man asked as he hurriedly left.

Therefore, Zhou Wen ran towards the coast. A high wall made of steel and concrete had been built around the city’s periphery. The members of Sea Return’s major families gathered here.

After Zhou Wen went up the high wall, he looked in the direction of the sea and was somewhat alarmed.

The waves in the distant sea weren’t huge, but huge crabs that resembled tanks crawled out of the sea. There were quite a number of them. Large swarms of crabs were heading for Sea Return City. The large crabs at the front of the swarm were less than five kilometers away from the high wall.

Looking at the black swarm of crabs that resembled a legion of tanks, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but lick his lips. He felt his saliva secreting significantly.

Previously, Ouyang Lan had treated him to eat a meal of crabs. He had heard that they were very expensive, but they tasted great.

Back then, the crabs were about the size of a plate. The crabs here were so huge that if cooked, they would probably be more delicious than what Zhou Wen had eaten before.

“Which family are you from? Why aren’t you taking refuge in the bomb shelter? Why are you here?” a middle-aged man asked when he saw Zhou Wen sprawled on the tall wall and staring blankly at the huge crabs on the beach.

“I’m here to help defend the city,” Zhou Wen said.

“Why are you bringing a child here to mess around? Quickly go back and hide,” the middle-aged man said as he left to help in the supply transportation.

Boom!

Zhou Wen heard a loud bang. A cannon set up on the high wall fired. A cannonball mixed with Essence Gold exploded among the crabs. Amidst the intense blast, the cannonball fragments scattered in all directions.

Some of the fragments struck the crabs’ shells, but they were of limited effect. They only left some superficial wounds on the shells without leaving any fatal injuries.

However, a few crabs had their legs injured, causing their movements to slow down.

Boom! Boom!

The salvo constantly rang out as shells exploded among the crabs. Zhou Wen could tell that the bombs weren’t used to kill the giant crabs, but to blast their legs apart. This way, the crabs could no longer charge into Sea Return City after losing their mobility.

However, there were too many huge crabs rushing out of the sea. The crabs in front had their legs blasted apart, but the crabs behind them crawled over them and continued charging towards Sea Return City.

The bombardment continued, but it didn’t put any end to the crab horde. When the crabs approached the city, the members of the few families began shooting with their guns.

However, their target was the crabs’ legs. They tried their best to hit the crabs’ joints and make them lose their mobility.

Capable Legendary and Epic experts summoned their Companion Beasts and stood guard outside the high wall. They were in charge of repelling the large crabs that came close.

Zhou Wen looked for a while and suddenly realized that there was a huge creature in the sea near the coast.
