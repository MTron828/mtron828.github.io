Chapter 1516 Berserk Sword Immortal

Li Xuan… Zhou Wen could already tell that Berserker Immortal’s strength was extremely terrifying. He was definitely not at the ordinary Human Realm.

Although Li Xuan’s body was extremely powerful, there was ultimately a limit. Zhou Wen was afraid that something would happen to him, so he wanted him to stand down. There was no need for him to take the risk.

However, Li Xuan cut off Zhou Wen and said with a smile, “How can I share half of your city without showing something? Take a good look at my performance. I won’t disappoint you.”

Zhou Wen read Li Xuan’s thoughts through his eyes. Li Xuan clearly knew that Berserker Immortal was extraordinary. He was using him as a target to force Berserker Immortal to show his strength, giving Zhou Wen a chance to observe from the side and understand the enemy.

What Li Xuan meant by taking a good look at him wasn’t for Zhou Wen to look at him, but to focus on Berserker Immortal as he forced his strength out.

“I don’t know what’s real or fake. All I know is that you are a coward who only knows how to spout nonsense. Kill me if you have the ability.” Li Xuan suddenly unleashed his strength and threw a punch at Berserker Immortal’s nose.

He deliberately didn’t use the Planet Devourer because he had already realized that the Planet Devourer probably couldn’t withstand Berserker Immortal’s power. It might be destroyed if he summoned it.

Berserker Immortal was an arrogant person to begin with. Despite knowing that Li Xuan was being provocative, he was still filled with killing intent.

Berserker Immortal didn’t have any qualms, nor did he need to tolerate it. At the instant Li Xuan rushed in front of him, he pointed out. It was so fast that Li Xuan couldn’t see his finger move, and his finger had already touched his forehead. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Thousands of sword beams erupted from Berserker Immortal’s fingertip as they surged towards Li Xuan like a galaxy

Berserker Immortal wanted to reduce Li Xuan to dust. Under the galaxy-like sword beams, his body would be torn into tiny fragments. No matter how strong his self-healing ability was, it was impossible for him to recover under such circumstances.

Berserker Immortal wasn’t lying. Even a Terror-grade creature that cultivated the complete Invincible Connate Divine Art would definitely be reduced to dust under his sword stream. Self-recovery was useless.

When the sword beams rushed into Li Xuan’s body, his entire body lit up as though his body had turned into a holographic projection.

The sword beams that resembled a river of stars surged through his body.

Zhou Wen activated the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation that he had set up ahead of time. The sword beams constantly circled around an area spanning hundreds of meters, preventing any from flying out.

“Is this Imperial Lord Polestar’s Major Heavenly Cycle Array?” Painting Immortal was immediately given a fright when he saw Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.

Although his strength was spatial, it was still much weaker than the Major Heavenly Cycle Array.

“It’s not the Major Heavenly Cycle Array. It’s somewhat different, but it’s already very similar. Furthermore, there are some strange powers combined with it. Strange, very strange!” Chess Immortal said with an odd expression.

He knew the Major Heavenly Cycle Array well. Now that he was in it, he could easily tell what was happening.

However, Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was somewhat different from the Major Heavenly Cycle Array. Chess Immortal couldn’t completely understand it.

Bang!

Everyone suddenly heard the sound of a fist colliding with flesh. They turned their heads and saw Li Xuan’s fist smash into Berserker Immortal’s face, causing his face to contort. The latter staggered and nearly fell to the ground.

The four immortals were filled with disbelief. It was unimaginable that Berserker Immortal had been punched in the face by a human.

That was Berserker Immortal, the one who had once defeated an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse.

Although he was now restricted by the ancient corpse’s body and could only maintain his strength at the Human Realm, it was still difficult for them to accept such an outcome.

In fact, this couldn’t be blamed on Berserker Immortal. He had always believed that Li Xuan cultivated an incomplete Invincible Connate Divine Art. He knew the path of the Invincible Connate Divine Art very well, making its cultivator an existence with an invincible body.

However, he never expected Li Xuan’s incomplete Invincible Connate Divine Art to take a completely new path. It was already very different from the true Invincible Connate Divine Art. It was almost two completely different Essence Energy Arts.

The sword beams failed to injure him when Li Xuan’s body digitalized. Berserker Immortal imagined that it was an illusion, but in fact, it was Li Xuan’s actual body.

Be it Calligraphy and Painting Immortal, or Berserker Immortal, they subconsciously looked down on humans. If they were to fight dimensional enemies, even if it was just an illusion, Berserker Immortal wouldn’t let them get close to him.

However, he didn’t retreat immediately after his sword beams failed to injure Li Xuan. That was how Li Xuan managed to punch him in the face.

Having succeeded in his punch, Li Xuan showed no mercy. He unleashed a barrage of attacks on Berserker Immortal with his fists and legs.

However, before his punches and kicks landed on Berserker Immortal, a sword beam that resembled a volcanic eruption suddenly erupted from his body. The sword beam was somewhat different from before. It was the color of blood.

A blood-colored sword beam spewed out and shot into the sky. Li Xuan’s digitalized body was corroded upon contact with the blood-colored sword beam. His hands and legs turned blood-red and quickly exploded.

In his horror, Li Xuan hurriedly retreated, but his retreating speed couldn’t keep up with the speed at which the blood-colored sword beam spread. His body was about to be devoured by it.

His Terror transformation ability didn’t really turn him into an ethereal holographic projection. Even a real holographic projection wasn’t completely incorporeal. In fact, it was made of fundamental particles.

As for Berserker Immortal’s sword beam, it was so minute that it could destroy neutrinos. Li Xuan’s Terror transformation powers were unable to survive such a sword beam.

Just as Li Xuan was about to be devoured by the sword beam, Zhou Wen instant transmitted behind him. He grabbed his body and instant transmitted out of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.

And in the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, Berserker Immortal slowly turned his face back and stood up straight. The sanguine light in his eyes was like a blade as the blood sword beam on his body constantly erupted like a crazy devil.

Wang Mingyuan’s previous slap had already pushed Berserker Immortal to the brink of going berserk. If not for the interests of the entire Immortal race, he would have killed Wang Mingyuan long ago.

However, Wang Mingyuan was the Dragon King after all, and he was now the leader of the Octokind. He had some status in the dimension, so Berserker Immortal had to put up with it.

Now, a Terror-grade human had actually hit him in the face. This made Berserker Immortal instantly rage.

As the blood sword beam on his body erupted, the ancient corpse’s body began to crack. Sanguine sword beams filled the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation as the looping space that was constantly formed by the array formation kept being torn apart.

“Your Excellency…” The four immortals shouted in horror as they unleashed their strength to withstand the sanguine sword beams.

They were still inside the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. They were the first to bear the brunt of the terrifying sword beams produced by Berserker Immortal.
