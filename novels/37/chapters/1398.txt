Chapter 1399: The Person Who Gives A Friendly Nudge

Gunshots constantly sounded. Six consecutive shots were caught by Immortal’s fingers. Furthermore, they were unable to stop him from advancing.

Others might think that Immortal’s Guardian was extremely powerful, but Zhou Wen knew that this fellow still had Fairy Burial hidden within. In fact, it was the power of two Guardians. Furthermore, it was two Calamity-grade creatures, so it was naturally not something ordinary Calamity-grade creatures could compare with.

However, Zhou Wen still wanted to know how Jiang Yan was going to deal with the sure-kill seventh bullet.

The seventh bullet wasn’t something that could be blocked with strength. Unless Jiang Yan’s strength had exceeded the Calamity grade, it was impossible.

The people from the other factions were also paying attention to Immortal.

Many people were alarmed, especially the factions that had once been enemies of the League of Guardians. They yearned for Immortal to die in the Venusian dimensional zone.

After all, the various factions didn’t have Calamity-grade combat strength. A Calamity-grade like Immortal was like a nuclear bomb. Who wouldn’t be afraid?

In the Venusian dimensional zone, before the Calamity could deliver the fatal seventh shot, Jiang Yan had already arrived in front of the Golden Palace. All he needed to do was take a step onto the steps to successfully clear the dungeon.

However, Jiang Yan didn’t do so. Instead, he stopped in front of the stairs. It was obvious that he was waiting for the sure-kill seventh shot.

Bang!

The seventh shot finally sounded. Everyone widened their eyes as they stared intently at Jiang Yan, wanting to see how he would deal with it.

When everyone saw the seventh bullet, it had already hit Jiang Yan’s palm. The Skyimmortal armor failed to completely block it.

The bullet tore forward crazily like a drill. Sparks and lightning drilled through the Skyimmortal armor as it continued, almost piercing through Jiang Yan’s palm.

However, Jiang Yan closed his fingers the next second and grabbed the bullet. Sparks flew out between his fingers, but the bullet failed to escape. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Jiang Yan held the bullet and walked up the stairs, opening the Golden Palace door as a metal ball flew out.

The scene switched back to the rankings. Everyone stared at the rankings, wanting to know what rank Immortal would receive.

From Immortal’s performance, his ranking was definitely not low. He had grabbed the Calamity-grade bullet with his bare hands, and it was the sure-kill seventh bullet. Previously, even the Dragon Turtle’s defense couldn’t withstand it, but Immortal had done it.

Others might not know, but Zhou Wen knew that the Skyimmortal hadn’t been able to block the fatal seventh bullet. Jiang Yan had still used Fairy Burial, so the bullet was probably resisting its power.

From the final scene, Fairy Burial wasn’t able to completely suppress the bullet either.

“Five stars… It’s five stars…” someone exclaimed.

Immortal’s name appeared on the rankings, followed by five shiny golden stars. Furthermore, despite both being five stars, Immortal’s name was higher than Tsukuyomi’s, putting him first on the rankings.

This ranking made many people feel uncomfortable.

After all, many factions were secretly competing with the League of Guardians. From their point of view, the League of Guardians was just a lackey of the dimension. Immortal had advanced to the Calamity grade and obtained first on the rankings. It was a greater blow to the average person than Tsukuyomi getting first.

It was especially so for humans who had worked hard and even risked their lives to use the Mythical Serum or Spirit Casting. At that moment, their hearts felt as though a boulder was pressing down on them.

Zhou Wen wasn’t concerned. After the last battle, he realized that Guardians weren’t necessarily all tools of the dimension.

Just like the Guardians of Cave Era and Jiang Yan, although they were created in the dimension, they were born on Earth. They had independent thoughts, and the dimension couldn’t completely control them.

Thinking back to a Guardian like Drought Demon Fairy, it wasn’t that easy for the dimension to control her either.

Of course, although Zhou Wen’s view of Guardians had changed, that didn’t mean that he wanted to contract them.

He had been used to being alone since he was young. Companion Beasts like Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy had already been considered a part of him, so he didn’t feel an aversion towards them.

However, Guardians were independent entities. Zhou Wen wasn’t used to having such an existence inseparable from him, afraid that his secrets would be exposed.

After this battle, the reputation of the League of Guardians was pushed to its peak again. Many youths from the new generation had thoughts of contracting a Guardian.

Compared to the other paths to the Mythical stage, contracting a Guardian was undoubtedly the easiest and fastest way to increase one’s strength.

“Young Master, do you plan on obtaining the Venusian Companion Beast?” An Sheng suddenly asked.

Zhou Wen saw that An Sheng’s expression was extremely solemn when he spoke. It was rare to see him speak in such a manner, so he asked, “I did, but I don’t know if it will succeed.”

“If it’s possible, let’s take first place now,” An Sheng said seriously.

“Why now?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“Because humans need confidence. Humans nowadays lack confidence.” An Sheng’s expression was solemn as he continued, “In this era, most humans are at a fork in the road where they are at a loss. At this moment, someone needs to step forward to give them a nudge, but the person who steps forward might nudge them to a different path. Now that Immortal has stepped forward, he has nudged many. It might even affect the future choices of an entire generation.”

“That might not be a wrong path,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. He didn’t believe that contracting a Guardian was definitely the wrong path.

An Sheng nodded and sighed. “It’s true that it might not be the wrong path, but at the very least, we have to let the next generation see that there are other paths to take, not just one. The path might be a good one, but with more people taking it, it will become the sole path.”

Zhou Wen lowered his head and pondered over An Sheng’s words. After a while, he looked up and said, “Then let me open up a new path.”

“Young Master, go break a leg!” An Sheng’s expression changed instantly when he received Zhou Wen’s affirmative answer. He looked like a fanatic who was rooting for Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng and was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. He suddenly understood An Tianzuo. An Tianzuo was clearly very satisfied with An Sheng’s capabilities, but he still kept lecturing him.

An Sheng was a person who didn’t let others live in peace. Sometimes, Zhou Wen had the urge to strangle him to death.

“However, I can only give it a try. It’s hard to say what rank I’ll get. Furthermore, I still need some time to prepare.” Zhou Wen didn’t know what rank he would get if he tried his best.

If he wanted to maximize the chances of getting first place, it was best if he waited for the Soul Mirror to complete its evolution. Furthermore, Zhou Wen still had one final step to complete the skill he had created.

Since he wanted to do it, he had to do it big.

“If Young Master needs anything, the Sunset Army will definitely provide you maximum support,” An Sheng said solemnly.

“If you really want to support me, help me get some Companion Eggs. You have the list,” Zhou Wen said.

An Sheng’s expression immediately turned bitter. “Young Master, I’ve already tried all means. There really aren’t any.”
