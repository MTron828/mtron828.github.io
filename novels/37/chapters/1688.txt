Chapter 1689: Wasting a Treasure

Everyone saw this unbelievable scene. Even Zhou Wen gaped in surprise.

Dimensional creatures were very difficult to tame. Ignoring the brainless dimensional creatures that basically fought to the death, even highly-intelligent dimensional creatures would self-destruct when forced into a corner. Apart from humans with special abilities, it was very rare to hear of dimensional creatures being tamed after being bested in combat.

The higher the level of a dimensional creature, the lower the possibility of it being tamed. It was unbelievable that this Hell-level Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast would submit to the Human Realm Imperial Lord Behemoth.

However, the truth was right in front of him. Zhou Wen suddenly thought of a possibility. Could it be that the Life Providence of the Emperor Life Providence had played a role, causing the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast to show an originally impossible attitude?

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right. In the past, Tyrant Behemoth had killed many dimensional creatures, but he hadn’t seen any dimensional creatures submit to it.

Ignoring the Calamity grade, he had never encountered such a situation even with Mortal dimensional creatures.

Now, Zhou Wen was filled with regret. If he had known that the Emperor Star was such a powerful item, he would have given it to Truth Listener. With Truth Listener’s strength, it was almost invincible among Calamity-grade creatures. He could just defeat a few Calamity-grade dimensional creatures and get them to submit to him before having them watch the gates at Guide Ancient City.

It was useless to regret it now. Thankfully, Imperial Lord Behemoth was rather powerful. In the future, if he placed more effort on it and gave it more resources, even if it couldn’t advance to the Heaven level, it would be rather impressive at the Hell level.

If the Human Realm Imperial Lord Behemoth could defeat the Hell-level Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast, then it was possible that the Hell-level Imperial Lord Behemoth might be able to compete with ordinary Heaven-level dimensional creatures.

This wasn’t a pointless trip. If I get the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast to watch the gates at Guide Ancient City, I doubt even the six families would dare barge in.

Just as Zhou Wen was daydreaming, Imperial Lord Behemoth grabbed the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast and ripped its body into two with its claws. Then, it threw it into its mouth and chewed, causing blood to splatter everywhere.

It actually ate... It ate... It ate... Zhou Wen widened his eyes and stared blankly at Imperial Lord Behemoth. He had the urge to slap the prodigal who had squandered all the wealth.

This was a Hell-level fighter, but it was eaten just like that. It was a waste of a treasure. Such acts were deserving of a lightning strike.

However, Imperial Lord Behemoth didn’t think anything about it. After chewing a few times, it swallowed it and even burped.

Looking at the Imperial Lord Behemoth, Zhou Wen had the urge to slice open its stomach and pull out the Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast. Unfortunately, it was useless even if he dug it out.

Zhou Wen gritted his teeth in hatred, but the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace were mesmerized. The Water Avoidance Gold-Eyed Beast that was extremely ferocious overseas had been devoured just like that. In their eyes, Imperial Lord Behemoth had become synonymous with ferocity and invincibility.

Zhou Wen gloomily unsummoned Imperial Lord Behemoth. This fellow had eaten a Hell-level dimensional creature, but experienced no change. From Zhou Wen’s point of view, it was no different from Pigsy eating a Ginseng Fruit.

After setting off again, the disciples and elders of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace became even more respectful and obedient towards Zhou Wen. Many people even looked at Zhou Wen with fervent gazes. It was unknown what they were thinking. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about what they were thinking. His mind was filled with a question. If the hidden dungeons in-game didn’t respawn, could he obtain the Emperor Star in real life?

From the results of his previous research, it was very likely that there was another Starlady Polestar in the North Pole Star Ice Palace in reality. Perhaps he could obtain another Emperor Star in reality.

Zhou Wen originally had no desire to challenge the Big Dipper instance dungeon in reality. The Cube’s ranking was meaningless to him.

However, this discovery made Zhou Wen have the thought of challenging the Big Dipper Palaces again. It wasn’t for the ranking, but to obtain an Emperor Star.

I’ll wait and see. If the hidden dungeon in-game really doesn’t respawn, I can only attempt the Big Dipper Palaces in real life.

Zhou Wen had already made up his mind. If he could really obtain another Emperor Star, he would give it to Demonic Neonate or Truth Listener. He yearned for a few more.

Nothing unexpected happened along the way. The ordinary dimensional creatures they encountered were shooed away by Honn Shinsakura and company. Zhou Wen finally led them back to Guide Ancient City.

The two Niten Flying Immortal Palace disciples who had taken Mohe back arrived at Guide Ancient City half a day later. After Zhou Wen asked, he learned that they hadn’t sent Mohe all the way back to the Family Clan of Gods. They had met people from the Family Clan of Gods on the way and Mohe had returned with them.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Mohe got them to bring something back and said that it was for Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen opened the box and realized that there was only a piece of paper inside. On the paper was a number. It was obvious that it was a phone number.

Zhou Wen roughly guessed what Mohe was up to. The two of them had previously made a bet. If Mohe lost, he had to tell Zhou Wen why the Family Clan of Gods wanted the people from the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t ask because he felt that it was useless to ask. If Mohe wasn’t willing to say, he could just give a random reason. It wouldn’t be difficult.

From the looks of it, Mohe planned on fulfilling his promise and telling him the secret.

After introducing Sei Gasakai, Honn Shinsakura, and company to Li Xuan, Zhou Wen got Li Xuan to settle them in. He returned to the yard and called the number left behind by Mohe.

“Zhou Wen.” Before Zhou Wen could say a word, Mohe’s voice sounded.

“How do you know it’s me?” Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant. Mohe’s tone made it clear that it was him, but Zhou Wen hadn’t made a sound. Could it be that Mohe had the ability to spy on him through the signal?

“Only you know this number,” Mohe said emotionlessly.

“I see. You left me this number to tell me the secret of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, right?” Zhou Wen was enlightened as he asked directly.

“Although I’m not a good person, I’m a person who will fulfill promises.” After a pause, Mohe continued, “Actually, the Family Clan of Gods doesn’t want all the disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.”

“Who do you want? Sei Gasakai or Honn Shinsakura?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Neither. It’s Shiraishi Satomi,” Mohe answered.

“Why?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. Although Shiraishi Satomi’s talent was pretty good, Honn Shinsakura and Sei Gasakai weren’t inferior to her. Furthermore, their cultivation levels were already above hers.

“Only she can obtain the Amaterasu Companion Beast.” Mohe’s answer left Zhou Wen alarmed.

Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi came from the same pantheon. Furthermore, it was said that Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi were twins.
