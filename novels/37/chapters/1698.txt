Chapter 1699 A Simple Name

“Junior Brother, well done!” Hui Haifeng jumped up excitedly. The effect was much stronger than he had expected. It couldn’t be any more perfect.

In the eyes of ordinary people, Human Sovereign was already a god-like existence. Truth Listener, who had blasted apart the twelve Star Palaces, made people love, fear, and envy him.

“Your daddy is ultimately your daddy. No matter how the times change, Human Sovereign is the strongest human. There’s no one else.”

“I’m dying of laughter. There was actually someone who wanted to compare Karoman to Human Sovereign? Is there a comparison?”

“Human Sovereign is mighty. This is the true number one expert of humanity. Those representatives are so weak.”

“Don’t brag yet. How do you know that Human Sovereign isn’t a representative? I think he’s basically a representative. Otherwise, how could he become so strong in such a short period of time?”

“Shut up. My Human Sovereign is definitely not a representative.”

While ordinary people engaged in a war of words on the Internet, the representatives, including Karoman, couldn’t say a word. Or rather, they were in no mood to speak.

Most of them had signed a contract with alien races to increase their strength. They originally imagined that they could become the top existences among humans, but Human Sovereign’s unparalleled strength made them feel like they had suddenly fallen from heaven to the mortal world.

“Which race is he the representative of?” After a long silence, Karoman finally spoke.

It wasn’t just Karoman who was wondering. All the representatives and experts of the various factions believed that Human Sovereign was definitely a representative. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to reach such a level in such a short period of time.

It had nothing to do with talent, but resources. Without the resources provided by the dimension, it would probably take at least eight to nine years for humans to obtain them in the dimensional zones. It was impossible for even a Human Realm Calamity to appear, much less at a level like Human Sovereign.

Everyone stared at the Cube’s screen and waited for the moment the ranking appeared. They wanted to know which race Human Sovereign was the representative of. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

It wasn’t just the various factions on Earth. Even many terrifying existences in the dimension were looking at the Cube’s screen. They also wanted to know which race had nurtured such a human. From their point of view, nurturing a human like this was a huge investment.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about what others thought. His mind was filled with

joy.

Emperor Star. Indeed, there’s an Emperor Star in reality. Starlady Polestar had dropped another Emperor Star in reality. Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen put away the Emperor Star and teleported out of the Star Palace.

With Zhou Wen’s departure, the Cube’s screen returned to the rankings.

Under the attention of everyone, the first place on the rankings changed hands as expected. Karoman was kicked to second place. However, when everyone saw the first name, they had the same reaction.

Unbelievable!

The name in first place was very simpleHuman Sovereign. It was without any additional prefixes or postfixes. Such a simple name surprised countless people in the Federation.

As for the representatives and experts of the various factions, they only felt despair spread in their hearts.

“How is that possible… Human Sovereign isn’t a representative…” They couldn’t believe that a human could reach such a level at such a point in time without relying on the resources of the alien races.

However, they had no choice but to believe it. If Human Sovereign was really a representative of the dimensional races in the human world, then according to the contract, he had to add the name of the dimensional race on the rankings unless the contract Human Sovereign signed was different from theirs.

However, up to now, they had never heard of a different contract. All the human representatives on the rankings did so without exception. It was obvious that the contents of the contracts were about the same.

Instantly, many representatives wore odd expressions. In order to increase their strength, they had signed a contract with dimensional races and become their representatives.

However, they suddenly realized that a person who didn’t rely on the dimension to provide resources was already far ahead of them. This left them momentarily unable to accept the blow.

“Haha, I knew it. It’s impossible for Human Sovereign to be a representative of the dimension. As expected of my Human Sovereign.”

“Long live our sovereign!”

“Unbelievable. Human Sovereign should be able to defeat those representatives. He’s pure human. I really wonder how those representatives feel after obtaining so many resources, only to be trampled beneath Human Sovereign’s feet.”

“I want to say something, but I’m not cultured enough. There’s only two words in my mind-Human Sovereign is awesome.”

“Not only are you uncultured, but you also don’t know how to count. That’s clearly four words, alright?” The entire Federation boiled over. A human who wasn’t a representative had actually reached such a level. Furthermore, it was possible that he was a pure human. He hadn’t become a representative or contracted a Guardian. It was even possible that he hadn’t used the Mythical Serum. This was as perfect as a dream.

Of course, most people didn’t believe that Human Sovereign remained pure human. They were more willing to believe that Human Sovereign had made some sacrifices to reach this stage.

The various platforms that were originally discussing representatives now talked about Human Sovereign. Companion Beasts-a very popular phrase to begin with-once again exceeded the search numbers of representatives and became the most popular search.

As people didn’t know Truth Listener’s name, and due to someone giving it the nickname of “Crown Prince,” the Internet was calling it that. There were countless discussions about Truth Listener.

Not every human could be a representative, but everyone had a chance of obtaining a Companion Beast. They wanted to know how to obtain such a powerful Companion Beast. The existence of evolvable Companion Beasts had already become common knowledge. It was just difficult for ordinary people to obtain them, but no matter how difficult it was, there was still a chance of obtaining one. If one could nurture one to the level of Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast, wouldn’t they also become a top human expert?

“So what if I’m weak? It’s fine as long as my Companion Beast is strong enough. If you aren’t convinced, fight my Companion Beast! If you aren’t convinced, fight Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast!” Many people began to change their views. They no longer envied the experts who became representatives.

Although it was impossible to completely change this concept in an instant, it was a good start.

“Young Master Wen is just so strong. It’s hard to imagine how he managed to reach this stage. He suffered so much in secret, but he never complained. Young Master Wen has had it hard,” An Sheng said with a sigh.

An Tianzuo remained silent. Zhou Wen’s growth was faster than he had imagined. He had truly become the cornerstone of the human race. He felt gratified as some kind of power grew in his body, causing his blood to heat up.

It’s time to go there. How can I fall behind him?
