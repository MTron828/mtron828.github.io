“I wonder how strong the five Calamity-grade dimensional creatures are,” Xiao said as he observed the five cosmic creatures.

“Regardless of their strength, we have to take that Companion Beast back.” Jiuyang stared at the glacier rift and said, “Lord Holy God said that that Companion Beast is different from ordinary Companion Beasts. It won’t appear in a normal manner. It’s very likely that there won’t be a corresponding dimensional zone and it might rush out directly. When the time comes, I’ll deal with it. Try your best to help me hold back those dimensional creatures.”

“I’m not confident fighting five alone,” Xiao said with a bitter expression.

“We can swap. You deal with that Companion Beast,” Jiuyang said indifferently. “Forget about it. I’ll try my best to hold them back.” Xiao pondered for a moment and shook his head.

The two of them discussed other details. As they hadn’t expected a human to appear here, they didn’t screen their conversation.

This couldn’t be blamed on them. This place was so far from Earth that humans couldn’t reach it even if they spent their entire lives. Furthermore, how was it possible for there to be a human here across the vast universe? Zhou Wen heard their conversation and roughly learned that their arrival wasn’t a coincidence. Holy God seemed to know the Companion Beast on this planet very well.

However, up to now, Zhou Wen hadn’t heard much useful information.

He only knew that there seemed to be something wrong with the Companion Beast on this planet and that it would rush out directly, but he didn’t hear Jiuyang or Xiao say what the problem was.

Just as Xiao and Jiuyang were discussing the details, they suddenly heard a loud bang. They hurriedly turned their heads and saw that the blue ribbon-like cosmic creature had rushed into the glacier rift.

As though it was contagious, the other cosmic creatures moved as well. They rushed into the glacier rift one after another and vanished in the blink of an eye.

Jiuyang and Xiao were taken aback. They never expected such a situation to happen when they came. Holy God only said that it was very difficult for this Companion Beast to appear, but he didn’t say that it could rush in.

The two of them exchanged looks before Xiao said, “Why don’t we go in and take a look?”

“Alright.” Jiuyang nodded slightly. The two of them headed for the glacier rift and soon vanished.

Zhou Wen watched them enter the glacier rift and was somewhat tempted. However, he ultimately held back. He didn’t know when Tsukuyomi would be fine, so he definitely couldn’t take the risk.

Should I take her away from here? Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi, who was still absorbing the Moon Essence, and wondered if he should leave the planet.

The reason he hadn’t left previously was that Tsukuyomi couldn’t move, nor could she be stored in the chaos space. It was also impossible for him to carry out interstellar teleportation of the huge ice cavern. It would be too dangerous if they encountered terrifying cosmic creatures after bringing her into the cosmos.

However, this place was even more dangerous than the cosmos. Furthermore, most of the cosmic creatures in the planet’s vicinity were dead. The few Calamity creatures who weren’t dead had already entered the glacier rift.

Based on the present situation, the dimensional creatures in the nearby cosmos were probably drawn over. It wouldn’t be easy to encounter a cosmic creature nearby, so there shouldn’t be any danger.

He could find a nearby planet to settle down and wait for Tsukuyomi to return to normal.

Before Zhou Wen could lift the ice cavern up, he heard another sound coming from the atmosphere. Zhou Wen hurriedly stopped and used Truth Listener to scan the direction of the sound.

A strange, fat person in a golden robe passed through the atmosphere and headed for the interior of the planet.

Furthermore, the person was rushing in the direction of Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.

Zhou Wen carefully sized up the strange person. The robe on his body looked golden, but it wasn’t completely golden. Golden square-holed coins were embroidered with golden thread over black cloth. They even overlapped, revealing very little of the base fabric. Therefore, it looked like he was wearing a golden robe that covered his rotund figure.

His face was very fat, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. His cheeks were like two meatballs with standard dead fish eyes.

Is this a human? Zhou Wen felt that this guy’s aura was odd, as though he wasn’t human.

Seeing that the strange person was about to reach them and was still heading straight for their location instead of the glacier rift, Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat.

Could this be Toad Immortal? Zhou Wen thought to himself. His aura was indeed similar to the toad, but it was somewhat different.

“Hand over the Moon Essence Basin and I’ll let you die a quick death.” The person in the coin robe came above the ice hole where Zhou Wen was and shouted hoarsely. His throat seemed to have been ground by sand paper, making his voice sound extremely unpleasant, like fingernails scratching the surface of metal. It gave one a headache.

It’s indeed him. Why did this fellow take human form? He really came at the worst possible time. Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he thought about how to deal with the present situation.

Swan Immortal was with him, and Moon Essence Basin was with Tsukuyomi. With these two things, Toad Immortal could find them no matter where they went.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t know what Toad Immortal valued more. If Toad Immortal thought more highly of the Moon Essence Basin, it would be impossible for him to lure Toad Immortal away.

From the looks of it, I can only fend him off head-on. Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate when he saw that Toad Immortal seemed to have the intention to charge down. He used instant transmission and appeared outside the ice cavern to confront Toad Immortal.

“You finally dare to show yourself. You killed my body and snatched my Moon Essence Basin. Dying ten thousand times isn’t even enough.” Toad Immortal stared at Zhou Wen with his dead fish eyes as his golden pupils shimmered with killing intent.

Without giving Zhou Wen a chance to speak, Toad Immortal’s cheeks swelled up like two balloons. It made one worry that they would explode at any moment.

However, in the end, his cheeks reached the size of gym balls without exploding. Then, he spat at Zhou Wen, instantly forming a terrifying storm. Everything that stood in front of the storm was swept up.

Banana Fairy was originally the best choice to deal with wind-elemental powers, but unfortunately, her level was a little low. No matter how strong her resistance against wind-elemental powers was, she couldn’t fight something that spanned so many levels.

After all, Toad Immortal was an existence at the Heaven level. The storm was just too powerful. Under the high-speed airflow, everything was torn apart. Furthermore, it enveloped a large area with almost no end in sight.

With a thought from Zhou Wen, a sword domain appeared out of thin air. Countless Sword Pills appeared around him as they faced the terrifying storm.
