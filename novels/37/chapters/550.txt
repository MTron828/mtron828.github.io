Chapter 551 Truth Listener“s Chrysalis

As soon as the tiny monster died, the golden hoop seemed to lose its life. One by one, they returned to their original size and fell to the ground with tinkling sounds.

"Six-Winged Guardian Dragon... So that’s Coach’s Companion Beast..." Ming Xiu recognized the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon at a glance. In fact, everyone recognized the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. After all, it was the first Companion Beast on the ranking.

"As expected of Coach. He already has a Mythical pet so quickly." However, Feng Qiuyan felt that it was only natural.

"I’m lucky. I got lucky during a battle between two Mythical creatures." Zhou Wen was telling the truth. Then, he looked at Li Xuan and asked, "Are you alright?"

The carapace on Li Xuan’s neck had completely shattered. A purple mark lined his neck, and his bones had almost snapped. If he had been any later, his Life Providence probably wouldn’t have been able to save his life. With his head lopped off, no matter how strong his recovery abilities were, it was unlikely he could regrow it.

"I’m fine. I don’t know what weapon that golden hoop is. It was terrifying." Li Xuan touched his neck and gritted his teeth in pain.

Fortunately, he had powerful recovery abilities. Without the restrictions of the golden hoop, he recovered in moments. There were no signs of injury.

However, this also gave Li Xuan a wake-up call. Although his body and Life Soul were very strong, it didn’t make him truly invincible. Against special attacks, it was useless no matter how strong his body and Life Soul’s self-healing abilities were.

Zhou Wen picked up the Orchid Blade, Bamboo Blade, and a golden hoop. Now that the golden hoop no longer had any magnetic force, the Orchid Blade and Bamboo Blade automatically separated from it. When Zhou Wen touched the golden hoop, there wasn’t any magnetic force.

"Look," Ming Xiu said, pointing at the tiny monster’s corpse.

They looked across and saw that the tiny monster’s golden body was rapidly melting, quickly turning into a pool of golden liquid. It looked like a pool of blood, but the color was different.

Within that liquid was a crystal.

Zhou Wen and company were somewhat surprised. Reality wasn’t a game where corpses vanished. Typically, after a dimensional creature died, it rotted quickly, but it wouldn’t be that fast. Typically, it would take at least two to three days to decompose.

What was even more strange was that the six golden hoops didn’t disintegrate together. Logically speaking, the golden hoops were part of the dimensional creature. Once a dimensional creature died, the golden hoops should have disintegrated. However, the six golden hoops remained intact. They were still as hard as before.

Zhou Wen extended his hand and sucked the golden dimensional crystal into his palm. He wiped away the golden liquid on it before throwing it at Li Xuan.

They were originally here to help Li Xuan, so they naturally had to give any spoils to him.

Li Xuan didn’t stand on ceremony as he caught the crystal and put it away with a grin.

"Do you want these golden hoops?" Zhou Wen pointed at the other golden hoops on the ground and asked.

"Objects on a monster would usually disintegrate. What’s the use of having them? They can’t be used as weapons," Ming Xiu said.

"These golden hoops seem a little special. Perhaps they won’t disintegrate." Zhou Wen tried injecting his Essence Energy into a golden hoop, but there was no reaction.

Ming Xiu shook his head and said, "Regardless of whether they disintegrate, I don’t use such ring-type weapons. They’re useless for me."

Feng Qiuyan and Gu Dian also shook their heads, indicating their lack of interest in them. Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony. He picked up the golden hoops and planned on studying them and figuring out what they were.

This thing was actually so powerful in the hands of an Epic creature. If it didn’t disintegrate and disappear, he could study how it could be used. What if it could be used?

After this trip, Li Xuan returned to his former self. He felt a lot more relaxed, unlike the mentally burdened person he was before.

However, he didn’t reduce the amount of training he did. He only changed the training method. In the past, he had been training his skills crazily. Now, he was also practicing his skills. However, he would often challenge stronger dimensional creatures, allowing his carapace to be injured before healing so as to constantly improve.

Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and studied the hoops for a while, but no matter what kind of Essence Energy he injected, the golden hoops didn’t react.

Could it be that humans really can’t use a dimensional creature’s weapon? Zhou Wen had no choice but to place the golden hoops on the table to see if they would disintegrate over time.

Some dimensional creatures disintegrated relatively slowly. Perhaps the hoops would take several days to disintegrate and disappear.

In the chaos space, the tiny beast was still gnawing on the metal walnut with all its might. However, it had not achieved much. There were still shallow teeth marks, and it did not seem to have made much progress.

He released Banana Fairy, Truth Listener, Doctor Darkness, and Demonic Neonate to give them a breather. They had some self-awareness. Usually, if he didn’t release them for a long time, they would become a little irritable, especially Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy. If it wasn’t necessary, they hated being in tattoo form.

Banana Fairy leaned on Zhou Wen’s shoulder as she curiously watched him game. She was eager to try.

Demonic Neonate stood in a dark corner with the ancient sword in her arms. If one didn’t pay attention, one wouldn’t be able to sense her existence at all.

Doctor Darkness stood there in a daze. It was unknown what he was thinking about.

Previously, when Truth Listener came out, it liked to jump around in the house. This time, it was abnormally quiet. Zhou Wen didn’t hear its voice.

After a while, Zhou Wen was suddenly blinded by a shimmering golden light in the room. He turned his head and saw the six golden hoops on the table. For some reason, they emitted a golden glow and automatically floated up.

The six golden hoops spun. A strange power surged within them as they became smaller and smaller with every spin.

At first, they were still the size of a necklace or bracelet. But later on, they reduced to the size of a ring; yet, continued shrinking.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling alarmed and puzzled, he saw the six golden hoops land and fly towards the table.

Only then did Zhou Wen realize that Truth Listener was standing on the table. After the six golden hoops landed, they flew towards Truth Listener’s body.

The six miniature golden hoops were caught onto Truth Listener’s six ears. They looked like six earrings, suiting it in quite a surprising manner.

After the six golden hoops latched on, Truth Listener’s body immediately emitted a golden glow. Wisps of golden light were like silk as they gradually enveloped its body. Soon, it transformed into a golden cocoon.

Is it evolving? Zhou Wen was surprised and delighted. He had never expected the golden hoops to allow Truth Listener to evolve. This was truly a pleasant surprise.

After Truth Listener’s evolution, it would definitely be able to evolve to the Mythical stage. When that happened, Zhou Wen would have another super fighter.

I wonder who will be stronger after the evolution—Truth Listener or Tyrant Behemoth? Zhou Wen was delighted. He had not realized that he would be able to evolve Truth Listener from fighting a monster.
