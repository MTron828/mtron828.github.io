Chapter 1256: Flower Girl

Translator: CKtalon

In the minds of ordinary people, creatures from the dimension were still lifeforms that humans couldn’t touch. After all, there was only one Human Sovereign, and most people were ordinary.

“Is there a way to cross it?” Philo looked at Zhou Wen, feeling uneasy, afraid that he would shake his head.

Zhou Wen remained composed as he looked at Ice Maiden and asked, “What do you think?”

Ice Maiden answered, “Even if the Flower race descends into the human world, it’s impossible for them to be Flower King-grade experts. Furthermore, they will be greatly suppressed by the rules of Earth. They shouldn’t be too much of a threat.”

Everyone wore odd expressions when they heard Ice Maiden’s relaxed tone. This was because Ice Maiden’s tone was just too arrogant. It was like an ordinary person eating a bowl of noodles at a streetside noodle shop when suddenly, they heard someone eating peanuts and noodles at the table discussing if they should buy a few aircraft carriers for fun this year.

Beside them, Grim Demon also said, “It’s just a mere Flower race.. If it dares block the way, just kill it. Why waste your breath?”

“In that case, let’s go,” Zhou Wen said as he carried Ya’er and Demonic Neonate towards the greenhouse.

Philo gritted her teeth and followed. The others were somewhat hesitant and didn’t dare follow them.

The elder coughed dryly. “Philo, be careful. Don’t force yourself.”

“Without Lucas around, there’s no happiness in this world. At most, I’ll die. It’s nothing,” said Philo as she strode forward and followed closely behind Zhou Wen.

Lucas had said that Zhou Wen was the most trustworthy person he had ever met. Lucas trusted Zhou Wen, and Philo was willing to believe him. Furthermore, she had no other choice.

Apart from Zhou Wen, no one else would dare take her to the Time Hut.

The elder and his employees watched from afar. No one dared to follow them. It wasn’t because they were cowardly. They had their own families and many of them were the financial backbone of their families. They didn’t dare risk their lives.

When they approached the valley, the petals swayed in the breeze, looking beautiful.

The average person would find it beautiful, but Zhou Wen, Ice Maiden, and Grim Demon saw crystalline stamens extend out of the greenhouse and attack them.

The stamens were like snakes. Their bodies were slender, but their heads could be split into four petals, like the mouths of monsters.

Without waiting for Zhou Wen to take action, Grim Demon, who was already itching from boredom, charged forward. Demonic aura condensed into a saber that instantly sliced through the flower stamen that extended out.

The flower stamens that had been severed lost their strength and immediately appeared, falling to the ground.

“He’s at the Terror grade!” The young man looked at Grim Demon in horror.

Grim Demon had been following Zhou Wen like a lackey, so he never expected such terrifying strength from him.

The elder looked at Grim Demon in thought as though he had thought of something. However, he couldn’t be sure. He asked a red-nosed man beside him, “Big Nose, do you find that fellow familiar?”

“Now that you mention it, it does seem so, but I can’t remember where I’ve seen him before,” the big-nosed man said after some thought.

“You think so too. Doesn’t he look like the Guardian who appeared invincible in the Cube battle five years ago?” the elder said again.

“Five years ago… Guardian… Ah…” The big-nosed man exclaimed as though he had figured it out. “That’s right, that’s right. It’s very similar. That Guardian’s name is Grim Demon, right? He seems to be with Human Sovereign… That’s right, that’s right. It’s him…”

The elder nodded. “If you think so too, then we can’t be wrong. I never expected to see him here. Five years ago, he was already a top Guardian. He’s probably stronger five years later. It’s no wonder he’s not afraid of creatures from the dimension.”

“It’s said that Grim Demon is Human Sovereign’s servant. If he’s following Zhou Wen now, could Zhou Wen be…” The big-nosed man widened his eyes in disbelief as he looked at Zhou Wen who was walking towards the greenhouse.

“It can’t be possible. How old is he? He was probably in his teens five years ago. It’s unlikely he’s Human Sovereign.” The elder’s son understood what the big-nosed man was getting at, but found it unlikely.

“That’s right. If he were a little older, he might really be Human Sovereign. However, even if he isn’t Human Sovereign, he definitely has a great background to be treated like this by a Guardian like Grim Demon. Perhaps the elders in his family are related to Human Sovereign,” the elder said.

The big-nosed man and company shared the same thoughts. It was no wonder they had such guesses. The Zhou Wen from five years ago was just too young. No one believed that a teenage boy could reach such a level and kill Di Tian who was like the lord of a universe.

Grim Demon unleashed his might as his demonic aura transformed into a hundred-meter-long saber. He slashed at the greenhouse in the valley, hoping to split it open and carve out a path to the heavens. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As though sensing Grim Demon’s terror, the greenhouse in the valley shook violently. Flower stamens that resembled light snakes extended out and swept towards the demonic aura saber.

However, under Grim Demon’s overwhelming demonic aura, the stamens were sliced apart. The dense flower stamens failed to block the demonic aura saber and were diced up.

Crack!

The demonic aura saber slashed at the petal, leaving a huge crack.

Just as the saber was about to strike the bottom of the petal, it was finally blocked.

Zhou Wen focused his gaze and saw a flower fairy-like girl sitting cross-legged in the stamen. Her eyes were like petals that emitted a silver glow. Her muslin clothes were translucent like some heavenly robe.

A pair of jade-like hands blocked Grim Demon’s demonic aura saber. Even someone as powerful as Grim Demon couldn’t complete the slash.

The girl held the demonic aura saber with both hands and slowly stood up. Her jade-like legs were long and straight. As she moved, the greenhouse converged and transformed into a flower dress that gathered over the girl’s body, making her look even more beautiful and noble.

Grim Demon’s eyes flashed with killing intent as the demonic aura on his body constantly surged into the demonic saber, increasing its might. However, it failed to slash down.

“Do you know her?” Zhou Wen asked Ice Maiden.

“I don’t know her but I’m certain she’s from the Flower race,” Ice Maiden said.

“That’s enough.” Zhou Wen condensed Sword Pill and shot it at the Flower race woman.

The Flower race woman was fighting Grim Demon with all her might, so she didn’t have the strength to deal with Sword Pill. Sword Pill penetrated her chest and slammed her into the mountain wall behind her.

Philo and company couldn’t see the Terror-grade battle. All they saw was Grim Demon rushing towards the greenhouse before it vanished.

When Zhou Wen waved his hand, the mountain wall collapsed. The beautiful woman’s chest was penetrated by a crystalline sword as she was nailed to the mountain wall.

“He’s indeed a Terror-grade existence. He’s still so young.” The elder sighed.

Philo was overjoyed as she thought to herself,?Lucas really didn’t lie to me. Zhou Wen is just so powerful. Perhaps he can really save Lucas.
