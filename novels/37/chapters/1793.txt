Chapter 1794 Destroying the Holy Land

The silver-haired Companion Beast accelerated, and when he arrived at the Holy Land, the energy fluctuations he emitted were no longer inferior to the Calamity grade.

Zhou Wen watched as the silver-haired Companion Beast tore through space and entered the Holy Land. It didn’t use any equipment like a teleportation nexus.

If it were in the past, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to accomplish this. It was only after advancing to the Calamity grade and fusing the eight abilities into one that he could do it as easily as the silver-haired Companion Beast.

The Holy Land hadn’t changed much from the past. The silver-haired Companion Beast ignored the various restrictions in the Holy Land as he swept his gaze while in midair before flying in one direction.

The majestic Sun God Temple was no different from what Zhou Wen had seen before. However, he didn’t see a single person along the way.

It was unknown where the Saints had gone. There was no one.

“Get out here.” The silver-haired Companion Beast looked at the Sun God Holy Temple and shouted coldly.

His voice wasn’t loud, it seemed to be able to penetrate the world and enter one’s mind. Zhou Wen felt his brain buzz from the sound.

However, the Sun God Holy Temple remained silent. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The silver-haired Companion Beast didn’t waste his breath. A silver glint flashed in his eyes, and without him moving, the almost indestructible Sun God Holy Temple rapidly decayed. Countless sprouts grew out of the palace.

As the sprouts rapidly grew, the Sun God Holy Temple also cracked and shattered. The palaces collapsed one after another, and the hard divine stones shattered.

In just a moment, the Sun God Holy Temple that had stood for years seemed to completely collapse, turning into fragments. The lush branches occupied the original spot of the Sun God Holy Temple.

At a glance, it looked like an ancient forest. It was completely unimaginable that it was once a holy palace.

......

At this stage, there was still no sign of anyone.

The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly and headed in another direction.

Connate Holy Temple, Divine Emperor Holy Temple… Zhou Wen watched as the silver-haired Companion Beast destroyed the temples.

Those mysterious and strange Holy Temples were like tofu in front of the silver-haired Companion Beast. They were probably even inferior to tofu. They turned into fertilizer with a mere glance.

This fellow’s strength is really strange! Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed.

What surprised him even more was that the entire Holy Land was like a dead city. Five Holy Temples had been destroyed, but not a single living creature was seen.

Even if it’s not convenient for the five races of the dimension to interfere, where did those Saints go? What about Holy God? Zhou Wen was puzzled.

Boom!

The last Trajectory Holy Temple turned into a vegetation paradise as well, but there were still no living creatures.

“Damn b*stard!” the silver-haired Companion Beast cursed angrily.

“What’s going on? They seem to know that you were coming.” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask. This was too bizarre.

“Ouyang Ting sure is scheming.” The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“Hmph, are you an idiot? You still don’t understand that everything was set up by Ouyang Ting. Holy Land? It’s just a nest of spies.” The silver-haired Companion Beast snorted coldly. “That old b*stard’s plan was good. Unfortunately, he underestimated my recovery ability. As long as he’s still on Earth, I can find him.”

“You mean that this Holy Land was created by Ouyang Ting?” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable.

“Who else could it be? You think you can obtain something like that with the power of the dimension? Dream on.” With a wave of the silver-haired Companion Beast’s hand, everything in the Holy Land revived. All sorts of plants grew crazily, and in a moment, the space in the Holy Land collapsed.

The sky seemed to crack like glass, revealing Earth’s normal scenery.

Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the so-called Holy Land was actually an island over the sea. It was completely different from what he had imagined.

The Holy Land was set up by the former principal. How is that possible? Zhou Wen’s heart churned in disbelief.

Back then, the former principal had been kidnapped by the Holy Land. In order to save him, Zhou Wen and the An family had spent a lot of effort.

But now that he thought about it, the silver-haired Companion Beast was trapped by the former principal. Apart from him, who could evacuate the Holy Land upon predicting that the silver-haired Companion Beast would escape?

The silver-haired Companion Beast ignored Zhou Wen’s thoughts. His eyes shimmered with silver light as though he had formed a strange connection with Earth. The silver light in his eyes seemed to resonate with the tides of the sea.

After a while, the silver-haired Companion Beast’s expression turned uglier.

“Strange, what’s going on? Could it be that that old b*stard is no longer in this world?” the silver-haired Companion Beast muttered to himself as his expression turned uglier.

Zhou Wen pondered for a long time before asking the silver-haired Companion Beast, “Are you sure that the Holy Land was created by Ouyang Ting?” “Hmph, other than those who once obtained my strength, who else can help those fellows from the dimension produce such a space on Earth?” the silver-haired Companion Beast said proudly.

“Kid, what’s your relationship with that old b*stard?” the silver-haired Companion Beast suddenly stared at Zhou Wen and asked.

Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss for an answer. In the past, Ouyang Ting was only his former principal who treated him well.

However, ever since Zhou Lingfeng told him the story that destroyed his worldview, Zhou Wen realized that Ouyang Ting was his grandfather.

“We’re considered relatives.” Zhou Wen had no intention of hiding it.

The silver-haired Companion Beast sized up Zhou Wen and said coldly, “Nonsense. The bloodline in you clearly belongs to that disappointing good-for-nothing. What has it got to do with that old fellow?”

“Who are you talking about?” he asked with a frown.

“Apart from that disappointing Zhou Lingfeng, who else could it be? Your eyes and brows are 70% similar to his. I get angry just seeing you.”

“That’s right. Zhou Lingfeng is my father. How did he offend you?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“Offend me? He’s not qualified. Just mentioning him makes me angry. If he wasn’t so useless, I wouldn’t have been reduced to such a state.” The silver-haired Companion Beast became angrier as he spoke.

From the spiel of curses the silver-haired Companion Beast made, Zhou Wen roughly knew what had happened after Zhou Lingfeng obtained the silver-haired Companion Beast.

In the words of the silver-haired Companion Beast, Zhou Lingfeng was trash.

He clearly had the strongest Companion Beast on Earth, but he didn’t seek to improve himself. He spent all his time fooling around and hitting on girls. He didn’t cultivate at all, allowing the silver-haired Companion Beast to evolve very slowly. In the end, he forcefully separated the silver-haired Companion Beast from him and gave it to Ouyang Ting. To give such a huge opportunity to others made him nothing but a prodigal.
