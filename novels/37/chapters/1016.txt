Chapter 1017: Great Demon King

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen had long been looking forward to Demonic Neonate’s evolution. Now, she was finally out.

He hurriedly summoned Demonic Neonate, but she didn’t seem to have changed much. She wore blackish-purple armor and hugged a Demonic Sword. She didn’t even seem to have grown taller.

The superficial details aren’t important. Stats are what matters. Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at Demonic Neonate’s stats. All he wanted to know was what had happened to her Wheel of Destiny when she returned to the Mythical stage.

Companion Form: None

Terror form... Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. Demonic Neonate had just advanced to the Mythical stage. Although the Wheel of Destiny he was looking forward to hadn’t changed, she actually had the ability to transform into the Terror form. He was overwhelmed with joy.

Isn’t this a little too powerful? She just advanced to the Mythical stage and already has a Terror form? Zhou Wen was very curious about Demonic Neonate’s Terror form.

He summoned Demonic Neonate in-game and made her enter her Terror form.

Demonic aura spewed out from Demonic Neonate’s body, but in the next second, she vanished in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen knew that since he hadn’t made Demonic Neonate move, she shouldn’t have moved randomly. Since she wasn’t moving, it should be an invisibility ability.

Is it invisibility? Zhou Wen could vaguely sense that Demonic Neonate was in front of him, but he couldn’t see her with the naked eye.

Zhou Wen attempted to use the Demon God Body, but he still couldn’t see Demonic Neonate. When he switched to Supreme Hell King, he still couldn’t see her. However, he could vaguely see some strange minute fluctuations in space. They were extremely tiny, and even in the Supreme Hell King state, it was very difficult to detect them.

Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He wanted to see what Demonic Neonate’s Terror form looked like, but no matter how he tried, he couldn’t see her. It was as though Demonic Neonate had really vanished.

Zhou Wen extended his palm, but he couldn’t touch Demonic Neonate. However, he could sense that she stood there without moving.

Alright, it doesn’t matter if I can’t see you. Let’s give it a try and see what your abilities are like. Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Today was the day the nine black dragons in the underground sea respawned. It was the perfect time to grind there again.

After entering the underground sea, Zhou Wen only summoned Demonic Neonate. He didn’t summon any other Companion Beasts.

When the nine black dragons saw Zhou Wen, they didn’t break their chains immediately. They just sized up Demonic Neonate in puzzlement.

Whenever the nine black dragons saw a Mythical Companion Beast at the same time, they would definitely break free from their shackles. Now, they didn’t do so immediately. There was only one reason—they couldn’t see Demonic Neonate. At most, they were about the same as Zhou Wen. They only felt that the space there was a little strange, so they didn’t immediately break free from the shackles.

Demonic Neonate, let me see how strong you are. Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he ordered Demonic Neonate to kill the nine black dragons.

In the next second, Zhou Wen suddenly saw dragon blood spew out as a black dragon was beheaded. It died without even knowing how it died.

Then, Zhou Wen saw a very strange scene. The black dragons spun around like headless flies. They couldn’t discover what was attacking them. When they sensed something, their heads had already been chopped off.

Clang! Clang! Ding! Ding!

Moments later, the nine black dragons were killed in the sea, dyeing the nearby seawater red. Two dimensional crystals and a Companion Egg dropped.

Too... Too powerful...

Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.

The Mythical Demon Blood True Dragon was slaughtered like poultry in front of the terrifying Demonic Neonate.

Zhou Wen had seen quite a number of Terror-form powerhouses, but they didn’t seem to be as strong as Demonic Neonate.

The dimensional crystal was useless, but the Companion Egg had a Li attribute that Zhou Wen didn’t have. Now Zhou Wen had four of the nine Demon Blood True Dragons.

I think I can give it a try. What will happen if I kill the Guardian inside? Zhou Wen stared at the war wagon at the bottom of the sea.

In the past, he couldn’t defeat the Guardian, but now, ignoring Zhou Wen’s strength, Demonic Neonate’s Terror transformation state was already invincible.

Without any hesitation, he opened the war wagon’s door and ordered Demonic Neonate to kill the Guardian inside.

Crack! The Guardian cocoon was split into two. The emperor-like Guardian with six fingers appeared in Zhou Wen’s vision.

Although he couldn’t see her, Zhou Wen could roughly guess that Demonic Neonate hadn’t taken action herself. She had only used the Demonic Sword to slice open the cocoon of the Guardian. Unfortunately, Zhou Wen couldn’t see the Demonic Sword that had Terror-transformed.

The Guardian seemed to be able to see Demonic Neonate. He stared intently at her as his face turned pale.

The invisible Demonic Sword slashed down again. The six-fingered Guardian seemed to be able to see where the Demonic Sword was. The ring on his finger glowed brightly at the same time as it rapidly spun. His figure also teleported and vanished.

However, when he appeared again, his body was split into two by a sword.

In the next second, a scene that left Zhou Wen dumbfounded appeared. The Demonic Sword suddenly revealed its size as demonic aura surged from it, condensing into Grim Demon’s figure. He actually grabbed the Guardian’s body and devoured it. In a few mouthfuls, he completely devoured the Guardian’s corpse before automatically returning to the Demonic Sword and quickly disappearing.

Grim Demon is still around? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He imagined that Grim Demon would be absorbed by Demonic Neonate.

‘Killed Guardian Demon Master.’ A notification popped up in-game.

So this Guardian is called Demon Master. Unfortunately, such a powerful Guardian was killed by Demonic Neonate just like that. It didn’t get the chance to reveal its abilities. With a thought, Zhou Wen recalled the Guardian of Ant City.

However, on second thought, killing the Guardian didn’t seem to be of much use now. It wouldn’t be too late to kill it in the future.

The most important thing now was to deal with the tree in the Maze of Lies.

Previously, so many Companion Beasts had failed to kill the tree. The Terror-form Ice Dragon King’s items couldn’t be taken into the game, so Zhou Wen had been vexed about it.

Now, with Demonic Neonate in her Terror form, it shouldn’t be a problem to slice through the tree.

After taking Demonic Neonate to the Maze of Lies and arriving at the garden, Demonic Neonate walked towards the tree before Zhou Wen could give her an order.

As Demonic Neonate approached, the tree, that had formerly remained motionless like a mountain, suddenly moved. Its leaves shook and the tree trembled. Its roots rose up, revealing a tree hole.

Demonic Neonate walked towards the tree hole. Zhou Wen hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to follow and see what was inside.
