Chapter 687: Buddhistic Glow Cleansing

Translator: CKtalon

In the sky, the music was demonic.

Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what was so special about it. The music didn’t seem to have any effect on them, but for some reason, when he heard it, he still felt a shiver from the bottom of his heart. It was as though there was a fear that stemmed from the depths of his soul.

As for Buddha Annihilation, it seemed to be enveloped by a dark force. It was like a devil hidden in the darkness, allowing people to sense his existence but not see it.

However, the power of darkness was blocked by the golden light emitted by the Buddha beads. The devil-like power failed to penetrate its body, and the two forces remained in a stalemate.

The golden-winged bird and the monk-robed skeleton were killed. Buddha Annihilation glanced at Zhou Wen and An Sheng, who were rushing over. The Urna between its brows revolved as though a Buddhistic glow had descended upon the Buddhist kingdom.

Zhou Wen and An Sheng were just about to rush over to help Leng Zongzheng when they saw the Buddhistic glow fall. They were alarmed as they used their Essence Energy Skills and Companion Beasts to block the Buddhistic glow.

However, they soon realized that the Buddhistic glow didn’t affect them at all. However, wherever the Buddhistic glow descended, it illuminated the crumbling Buddhist kingdom like it was cleansing it.

Zhou Wen and An Sheng suddenly widened their eyes. Amidst the cleansed area, the golden-winged bird and the monk-robed skeleton, that had just been killed, were reborn and bathing in the Buddhistic glow.

Zhou Wen was dumbfounded as he said to An Sheng in bewilderment, “Ah Sheng, pinch me. I want to know if I’m hallucinating.”

“I think I’m hallucinating as well.” An Sheng swallowed his saliva and said with great difficulty, “Young Master Wen, your Companion Beasts were able to kill them just now. They should still be capable of doing so now, right?”

“No way. My Companion Beast is enervated from earlier. If those two fellows really come back to life, the method from before definitely won’t work,” Zhou Wen said.

Torch Dragon Youngling was greatly enervated after using World King Transformation. It was useless for the time being. Even if he released it, it only had about the same combat strength as the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon. Fighting the golden-winged bird was courting death.

Tyrant Behemoth had almost used up all the time for its Absolute Strength. Without the suppression of Absolute Strength, it was probably no match for the monk-robed skeleton.

The only good news was that the monk-robed skeleton, which was bathed in a Buddhistic glow, did not have the crystal in its hand. From the looks of it, the crystal wasn’t part of the monk-robed skeleton. The only one was the one in Zhou Wen’s hand.

Zhou Wen had already studied it, but he hadn’t figured out how to make it emit the golden light to injure the enemy.

The skeleton in monk robes and the golden-winged bird had returned to life. They looked no different from when they had first entered the Buddhist kingdom. They were brimming with energy as four pairs of eyes stared at Zhou Wen and An Sheng.

“Young Master Wen, do you have any other Companion Beasts that can kill them?” An Sheng asked.

“I do have Companion Beasts, but I don’t know if I can kill them,” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile.

“Then let’s prepare to risk our lives,” An Sheng said through gritted teeth.

“Son, come here. Your daddy is here...” The bald parrot was still alive. It jumped onto Zhou Wen’s shoulder and shouted at the golden-winged bird.

Boom!

Zhou Wen punched it to the ground and thought to himself, Why would Leng Zongzheng raise such a Companion Beast?

The monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird rushed towards Zhou Wen. The monk-robed skeleton’s target was the crystal in Zhou Wen’s hand, and the golden-winged bird clearly hated Zhou Wen and the parrot to death. It wanted to kill Zhou Wen and the parrot first.

Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned Tyrant Behemoth and allowed it to clash with the monk-robed skeleton again. Although Tyrant Behemoth was unable to defeat the skeleton without Absolute Strength’s suppression, it wasn’t a problem for it to hold out for some time.

Now, the most difficult thing to deal with was the golden-winged bird. It was too fast—so fast that Zhou Wen couldn’t dodge its attack. If he couldn’t kill it, Zhou Wen would be the one to die.

Truth Listener and Demonic Neonate were summoned by Zhou Wen at the same time. Zhou Wen quickly retreated while An Sheng consciously retreated to the other side and ran towards Tyrant Behemoth.

After Demonic Neonate landed, she hid herself as she took in the situation. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, Truth Listener’s earring shattered as its body instantly transformed into a terrifying dark-gold ferocious beast.

Zhou Wen grabbed the bald parrot and threw it at Truth Listener. “Quick, scream. Use all your strength to curse all its ancestors.”

“What the f**k do you take me for? I must curse just because you want me to do so? Whether or not I want to scold my son depends on my mood. Now that I’m in a good mood, I’m not going to be petty with that young eagle brat.” The bald parrot was still mumbling, but the golden-winged bird had already charged over with a shriek. It was so fast that no one could see its figure clearly. All they saw was a flash of golden lightning in the sky.

Truth Listener seemed to have discovered the golden-winged bird’s location as it phased away and extended its claw.

However, its body’s reaction speed failed to keep up with the golden-winged bird’s speed. It failed to grab the golden-winged bird that flashed past. Instead, the golden-winged bird’s blade-like wings sliced past its chest.

Truth Listener retreated as its legs tore open two long ditches on the golden-bricked ground.

The golden-winged bird’s attack only left shallow marks on the dark golden scales on Truth Listener’s chest. It failed to cut through the scales.

Truth Listener had the Indestructible Vajra Body skill. Even Tyrant Behemoth had to use Absolute Strength to match Truth Listener’s physical toughness.

Truth Listener’s speed was already very fast. It was considered one of the best at the Mythical stage, but it was still slightly inferior to the golden-winged bird.

The golden-winged bird constantly flashed about and attacked Truth Listener, causing it to be overwhelmed. Truth Listener, who was originally extremely agile, appeared somewhat clumsy in front of the golden-winged bird. Its body was constantly being attacked by the bird’s wings and claws. Although it wasn’t severely injured, it made Truth Listener, who was already in an abnormal state of mind, become increasingly irritable.

However, what delighted Zhou Wen was that although Truth Listener couldn’t touch the golden-winged bird, it wasn’t anywhere close to being killed. It managed to stabilize the situation for the time being.

Zhou Wen looked at Tyrant Behemoth and saw that it was also suppressed by the monk-robed skeleton. Without Absolute Strength, Tyrant Behemoth also lost its absolute dominance at the Mythical stage.

The situation had completely reversed; Zhou Wen’s pets were at a disadvantage. The situation was extremely bad.

What worried Zhou Wen the most was that even if they could finish off the skeleton and the golden-winged bird this time, what about the next time?

If Buddha Annihilation could revive them, no matter how powerful Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts were, they would still end up dying.

The only way was to kill Buddha Annihilation first.

The situation on Leng Zongzheng’s side wasn’t smooth. The Demonic Organ Throne’s strength clearly wasn’t able to completely suppress Buddha Annihilation. Otherwise, Buddha Annihilation wouldn’t have the time to revive the monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird.

Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and flapped his wings as he flew into the sky. He wanted to see if he could help Leng Zongzheng destroy Buddha Annihilation.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
