Chapter 1301: Accidentally Entering a Land of Peril

As if he had suddenly plunged into the sun from the darkness, Zhou Wen’s vision became clearer. However, the scene in front of him made his hair stand up, and he had goosebumps all over his body.

Swoosh!

Zhou Wen quickly jumped up and retreated like a cat whose tail had been stepped on.

In front of him was a creature bigger than a tyrannosaurus. It was a white-furred ape. Its fur was snow-white, but its skin was as black as cast iron.

It was probably more than a hundred meters tall and unimaginably muscular. Its hands were raised high as if it were holding something, like a giant that could hold up the sky.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what level it was at, but he had most likely stopped from slamming into it. He had passed through so many places, but he couldn’t make the Wings of Tomorrow stop. Yet, when he slammed into it, he almost blew up his head. However, it was completely fine. Just its physical strength alone proved how extraordinary it was.

At this moment, the white ape was staring at Zhou Wen with a gaze like a demon king looking at a mortal.

Alarmed, Zhou Wen retreated quickly. However, he didn’t retreat far before he bumped into something and had to stop.

As Wings of Tomorrow had been interrupted, Zhou Wen regained control of his body. With this collision, he felt something soft behind him as if he had slammed into a soft animal. He was so frightened that he immediately retreated again.

He turned around and saw a golden glow behind him. It was a leg, a leg covered in golden fur.

Zhou Wen looked up and quickly saw the owner of the leg. It was also a giant ape with a body comparable to the white ape. However, it was covered in golden hair that resembled satin, and its skin was yellow.

As Zhou Wen had bumped into it, its golden crystal-like eyes stared at Zhou Wen like the white ape. There was an extremely cold look in its eyes.

“Sorry, I’ll definitely watch where I’m going next time.” Zhou Wen turned around and wanted to run to the side, but he realized that there was also a giant ape there. The hair on that giant ape was blackish-gray, making it look even more terrifying.

“No way…” Zhou Wen swept his gaze around. Just as he imagined, there was a giant ape in all four directions. In the other direction was a giant ape with red fur. Like the other three giant apes, they raised their hands as if they were holding something. They stood there motionless as they looked at him.

Zhou Wen forced himself to calm down and carefully sized up the four apes and the situation.

That glance left him even more confused and horrified.

This was a huge underground cave. There was actually a lot of seawater around it, like an underground sea.

The spot where Zhou Wen was standing wasn’t a small island, but a gigantic turtle shell.

The four giant apes stood on the turtle shell. Their hands were raised high as they collectively held up a stone-like object.

Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what it was. It was carved from gray stone and looked very crude. It looked a little like a tripod, but it was too large.

The four giant apes were more than 100 meters tall. It was obvious how large the stone artifact was if lifting it required their combined strength.

What was even stranger was that Zhou Wen realized that there was an iron collar around each ape’s neck. The collar was connected to several chains, linking their bodies to the turtle shell and the stone artifact.

What kind of place is this??Zhou Wen took a Rejuvenation Pill and felt his mind clear up. He was even more shocked and confused. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The reason for that was because he discovered a stone cocoon in the stone artifact.

Guardian! There’s actually a Guardian here!?Zhou Wen used Truth Listener and scanned the stone cocoon in the stone artifact repeatedly. There was indeed no mistake; it was indeed a Guardian cocoon.

Although Zhou Wen was very curious, he knew very well that the four devil-like apes were definitely not benevolent creatures. Furthermore, he didn’t make a habit of risking his life.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used Godfiend Era’s instant transmission to escape.

However, he was clearly moving toward the underground sea, but he still appeared above the turtle shell.

The results were the same after a few attempts. Be it instant transmission or Singularity Universe’s interstellar teleportation abilities, Zhou Wen would appear on the turtle shell when he blinked out of existence.

Apes are vegetarians, right? They shouldn’t want to eat human flesh, right??Zhou Wen looked at the four apes and carefully walked through the gap between one of the apes’ legs. He wanted to see if he could directly walk beyond the turtle shell.

As Zhou Wen walked, he kept sizing up the golden-haired ape. The golden-haired ape looked the most amiable out of the four apes. Zhou Wen thought that it might not like eating meat.

As Zhou Wen moved, the four giant apes didn’t move, but their eyes kept following his movements. The golden-furred ape was no exception.

Zhou Wen braced himself and prepared to walk between the golden-haired ape’s legs. He gathered all his strength. If the golden-haired ape suddenly attacked, he could only risk it.

Although Zhou Wen didn’t like to participate in battles with such unknowns, he knew that it was best to take the initiative when facing an unknown opponent.

Therefore, Zhou Wen had already made a plan. As long as the ape did not do anything abnormal, he would immediately attack with all his might and finish off one first.

Rumble!

Before Zhou Wen could reach the golden-furred ape’s legs, he suddenly felt the turtle shell beneath his feet tremble. The seawater around him churned as if something had happened.

Zhou Wen quickly summoned his Terror-level Companion Beasts and surrounded himself with them.

There were Golden Battle Gods around him, and Banana Fairy was sitting on a banana leaf above him. He also carried Demonic Neonate in his arms, prepared to fight to the death at any moment.

The surrounding seawater churned for a while, but it didn’t affect the turtle shell. After a while, the turtle shell stopped trembling, and the seawater gradually calmed down.

Just as Zhou Wen was wondering what had happened, he suddenly saw the golden-furred ape lower one of its claws and use only one claw to hold up the stone artifact.

The lowered claw swiped at the sea.

With a boom, the seawater thousands of meters away spewed out. A flood dragon broke out of the water like a loach that had been caught. Its body twisted and struggled, but it couldn’t escape.

The flood dragon was pulled into the golden-furred ape’s claw from thousands of meters away.

The flood dragon’s body spewed out dragon breath. Its strength was probably not inferior to the True Blood Demon Dragon, but it was like a loach in front of the golden-furred ape. It grabbed the flood dragon by the mouth and bit down. The dragon’s head, together with a small portion of its body, was bitten off. With a few bites, the dragon’s blood gushed out and the dragon bones broke.

In just a moment, a flood dragon was swallowed alive and whole, into the golden ape’s stomach.
