Chapter 1257: Trouble

Translator: CKtalon

Transparent blood constantly flowed out of the flower girl’s chest, but her clothes were gradually withering. She couldn’t even open her eyes. She looked like she was about to die.

Zhou Wen wanted to walk over and see if he could pick up anything from her.

After all, she was from a dimension. She might have some treasures on her.

Ice Maiden followed Zhou Wen. Just as Zhou Wen was about to plunder the items, Ice Maiden saw something on the flower girl’s neck. Her pupils suddenly constricted as she hurriedly said to Zhou Wen, “We can’t let her die. Quickly save her.”

“What’s wrong? Do you know her?” Zhou Wen looked at Ice Maiden in puzzlement.. He had previously asked her, but she had clearly said that she didn’t know her.

“No, there’s no time to explain. Save her first. Don’t let her die. I’ll explain it to you later.” Ice Maiden looked very anxious.

Zhou Wen seldom saw Ice Maiden with such an expression. Furthermore, the flower girl was indeed on the brink of death. If he didn’t save her now, it would be too late. There was no time for questions.

After some thought, Zhou Wen pulled out his Sword Pill from her body and used the power of Human Sovereign. At the instant the flower girl dropped down, his fist mercilessly struck her chest, leaving a hole in the wound that was the result of the sword’s penetration.

Philo looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. She had clearly heard Ice Maiden asking Zhou Wen to save her, but Zhou Wen had ruthlessly attacked.

The others looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. Zhou Wen punched through the flower girl’s chest and slammed her body into the mountain wall, producing cracks in the wall.

However, the next scene made Philo and company widen their eyes. The flower girl’s chest wound, which had been punched through by Zhou Wen, healed at a discernible pace. In a moment, she was as good as new.

Just as the flower girl recovered, Ice Maiden struck out with the power of ice, freezing the flower girl and sealing her in ice.

Zhou Wen looked at Ice Maiden, unsure of her intentions—she wanted her saved, yet she sealed her up.

Ice Maiden used a strange ability to transmit her voice into Zhou Wen’s ears. No one else could hear her.

“I’m afraid we’ve gotten into big trouble.” Ice Maiden didn’t wait for Zhou Wen to ask further as she continued, “This flower girl has the Tear of the Flower Goddess on her. She definitely has an extremely intimate relationship with the Flower Goddess. If we kill her, the Flower Goddess will be furious. If that happens, we will probably have to face unimaginable horror. However, we can’t release her. We nearly killed her, so she will bear a grudge. Releasing her will only make things worse for us.”

“Flower Goddess?” Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of existence Flower Goddess was, but from Ice Maiden’s expression, she seemed to have an extremely high status in the dimension.

Ice Maiden explained in a voice that only Zhou Wen could hear, “Among the dimension’s Apocalypse experts, the Flower Goddess can be ranked in the top five. Furthermore, there are many experts in the Flower race. If they risk everything to forcefully descend, it will be a calamity that will wipe out all life.”

Zhou Wen used his spatial powers to send his voice into Ice Maiden’s ear. “Will the Flower Goddess risk everything for a clansman who has entered Earth? That will probably cost a lot, right?”

According to what Zhou Wen knew, the clansmen sent to Earth in recent years were only cannon fodder. Most of them were Guardians and not pure dimensional creatures.

Ice Maiden said with a bitter smile, “That’s what makes it bad. This flower girl isn’t an ordinary member of the Flower race. The Tear of the Flower Goddess is extremely rare among them. Only a few very special members have been bestowed the Tear of the Flower Goddess. If the life of a Flower race member with the Tear of the Flower Goddess is threatened, the Flower Goddess will be able to sense it. This is the final defense mechanism to protect them. As this is Earth, it’s too isolated from the dimension, so the Flower Goddess might not have sensed her injuries. However, once she dies, the Flower Goddess will definitely sense it. When that happens, it will be troublesome.”

“Even if she can sense it, she won’t know who killed her, right?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“If only it were that simple. That Tear of the Flower Goddess isn’t simple. Although I’ve only heard of it and don’t know its exact use, it’s definitely possible for her to discover that we killed her. At the very least, in the dimension, no one dares to kill Flower ladies who possess the Tear of the Flower Goddess.” Ice Maiden showed an abnormal look of disgust.

She never expected that a random Flower race member on Earth would have the Tear of the Flower Goddess.

Did the Flower race member with the Tear of the Flower Goddess have nothing better to do. Why did she come to Earth? There were billions of Flower race members and plenty of cannon fodder. She never expected such a fellow to come.

“Then what should we do?” Zhou Wen didn’t like trouble, and this clearly spelled huge trouble.

“How would I know? We definitely can’t kill her, but it’s not good to let her go.” After a pause, Ice Maiden continued, “How about this? Let’s bring her along and see if we can think of a way to change her mind and rope her in.”

“What kind of people possess the Tear of the Flower Goddess? This one doesn’t look that strong,” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.

“The future Flower Goddess, or a descendant that the Flower Goddess values, or even the Flower Goddess’s very own daughter. These are all possible. I’ve only heard of them, but I’ve never seen them before. How would I know which one it is?” Ice Maiden felt disgusted at the situation she was in as though she had eaten a fly.

“Then let’s bring her along.” Zhou Wen waved his hand and stored the frozen flower girl in the Chaos Bead.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t too worried. If the dimension could conquer Earth so easily, they would have long taken Earth for themselves. They wouldn’t have waited until today and caused so much trouble.

No matter how strong the Flower Goddess was, it obviously wasn’t easy for her to descend to Earth.

However, he could keep this flower girl alive. He might be able to obtain more information regarding the dimension from such an important figure. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Let’s go to the Time Hut,” Zhou Wen said as he continued walking.

The ability to kill and save people at the wave of his hand was truly shocking. The elder ran over with the others and continued leading the way for Zhou Wen and company. He didn’t dare be negligent, and his words and actions were much more restrained.

Even Philo didn’t dare be as casual as before when she spoke to Zhou Wen again.

Ice Maiden didn’t say a word along the way. She was having a headache over how to deal with the flower girl. It didn’t seem easy for her to not bear a grudge after beating her up to a pulp.

Nothing major happened along the way. Some minor problems could be resolved with the guide and his subordinates. They were very familiar with the area.

After traveling for two to three hours, Zhou Wen finally saw the legendary Time Hut.
