Chapter 83 Stalemate at the Stone Stairs

“Madman.” Liz ignored what Zhou Wen had said. She gestured with her hand for the officers to head over and apprehend the heavily injured Zhou Wen.

She had already wasted too much time, far more than she had originally planned. It was already hard to tell if they could take Zhou Wen away before the An family came. She couldn’t afford to waste any more time.

The few officers lunged forward. By heading higher, the stone stairs had broadened. They were no longer as narrow as before, allowing them to rush up together.

But this time, Zhou Wen didn’t immediately run. He sat at the top of the stairs, striking forward at the officer that led the charge.

This strike seemed soft and powerless as though he hadn’t exerted a sliver of strength. The officer was nearly two meters away, so not even his sleeves were touched.

Liz and the few officers naturally didn’t believe that Zhou Wen had the ability to strike them from a distance. Skills that could project Primordial Energy was considered a minority even at the Legendary stage, so it was impossible for someone at the Mortal stage to master such a skill. Even if there was one, someone at the Mortal stage didn’t have the Primordial Energy needed to support the expenditure.

However, with Zhou Wen’s gentle strike, the officer silently collapsed to the ground. It instantly shocked the rest.

Zhou Wen remained unperturbed as he repeatedly struck the air. In response, the remaining officers collapsed in the zone as though their souls had been dissipated.

Liz was stunned and bewildered, nearly unable to believe her own eyes. The few Legendary officers had clearly stopped breathing; yet, she couldn’t tell how they had been killed by Zhou Wen. Her eyes flickered with a glint of shock and puzzlement. Momentarily, she didn’t dare approach him.

Yet Zhou Wen knew very well that they hadn’t been killed by him. Instead, it was the mysterious force of the stone stairs and Small Buddha Temple that robbed them of their lives.

However, no one knew this mysterious force better than Zhou Wen. He had accurately estimated the moment of the officers’ death and just posed with a strike. It was simply to scare them off.

What puzzled Zhou Wen was that Liz wasn’t affected by the stone stairs’ force; otherwise, she should have been lying dead.

Strange, don’t tell me Liz possesses a Primordial Energy Skill similar to Heart Meditation? That’s why she hasn’t been killed by that mysterious force? But that’s not right. Even if she has something like that, she doesn’t know the secret of this place. She wouldn’t be using it ahead of time... What’s happening?

Zhou Wen was puzzled, but he didn’t show it. He continued sitting on the stone stairs with a leisurely look, looking down at Liz with an air of superiority. “I didn’t want to kill, but why did you have to force me?”

His words were half-truths. If Liz hadn’t forced him, he definitely wouldn’t wish them dead, much less make people from the bureau die.

He didn’t know if he could explain their deaths clearly in the future, with the possibility of the League putting him on a wanted list.

But even so, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to expose the secret of his mysterious phone.

At most I’ll be a fugitive, escaping into dimensional zones that aren’t within human control. As long as I have the mysterious phone, the dangers of the dimensional zones are nonexistent to me. Zhou Wen made up his mind that if he were truly cornered, he would have to become a wanted fugitive.

“Don’t try to act all mysterious. Do you think you can fool me?” Liz didn’t believe that a student like Zhou Wen at the Mortal stage could possess such terrifying power.

However, she was unable to instantly tell how the four officers had died. This hesitance made her lack the courage to directly rush forward.

“You can give it a try if you don’t believe it. Let’s see if my Formless Divine Palm is capable of killing you,” Zhou Wen said with a deadpan expression as though he had everything in the

bag.

However, Zhou Wen was lamenting inwardly, I’ve already stalled for so long. Even without Heart Meditation’s protection, no matter how strong Liz is, she should have died on the stone stairs. Why is she completely fine?

“What Formless Divine Palm? I’ve never heard of it.” Liz kept staring at Zhou Wen and the four dead officers in an attempt to figure out the reason for their deaths.

“The Formless Divine Palm is colorless and shadowless. It kills people in an invisible manner, a Primordial Energy Skill Ouyang Lan gave me. It was meant to protect me, and I usually wouldn’t readily use it. If you hadn’t cornered me today, I wouldn’t have used such a vile Primordial Energy Skill.” Zhou Wen spoke nonsense, but he was considering how he could escape.

He didn’t believe he could really scare Liz. She hadn’t rushed up because she hadn’t figured out how her four colleagues had died and was unwilling to take the risk.

Liz was doubtful of Zhou Wen’s words. It was true she couldn’t tell how the deaths occurred because they didn’t seem to have any injuries at all. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, an idea came to Liz. She recalled the forbidden zone sign she had seen and immediately came to a realization. She sized up her surroundings and sneered. “Then, let me try and see how your Formless Divine Palm can kill me!”

As she spoke, Liz summoned a Companion Beast.

It had pure-white wings and supple skin and was dressed in a white gown. It resembled the mythical angel but had one thing that was different. This angel Companion Beast didn’t have a head. It was empty from the neck up.

“Headless Angel!” Zhou Wen immediately cried out when he saw the headless angel.

Headless Angel was very famous as a Companion Beast. Although it came from the League’s West district, its name had already spread across Earth’s League.

Headless Angel wasn’t a true angel, but a figure in western legend.

Legend had it that a pious nun believed in God with the purest heart, hoping that she could one day ascend to heaven to serve God as an angel.

Every person who saw the nun believed that she was the purest and most flawless person in the world. Therefore, everyone who knew her believed that she was bound to ascend to the heavenly kingdom after her death, becoming an angel who would serve God.

Perhaps the nun’s devotion moved God. One day, God descended before the nun and cast a divine light down on Earth, purifying the nun’s body into that of an angel’s.

Just as the nun’s body was being transformed into an angel’s body, she saw a prisoner on death row piously praying and confessing to God.

Hence, the nun asked God, “That prisoner is so pious. Can you absolve him of his sins?”

God answered, “I can, but his sins need to be burdened by someone. If you agree, you can replace the prisoner at the guillotine and bear his sins.”

After hearing that, the nun resolutely chose to bear the sins for the prisoner. Hence, with a flash of divine light, the prisoner at the guillotine was switched to the nun who was quickly transforming into an angel. Before her body could completely turn into an angel’s, her head was chopped off.

Although her head had been chopped off, the other parts of her body were already that of an angel. It was an unaging and immortal body that didn’t die because of a beheading.

However, the head wasn’t able to recover due to it not being angelized. Therefore, the nun became the legendary Headless Angel in western legend.

Although the name was terrifying, a Headless Angel was synonymous with purity in the West district.

After the dimensional storms, inside one dimensional zone in the West district, a Headless Angel dimensional creature appeared. It was later slain by humanity and its Companion Egg obtained.

As such, the Headless Angel at the Epic stage became famous across Earth’s League. She wasn’t the greatest at combat strength but she was great for protection.

With the protection of a Headless Angel, all kinds of evil forces like curses and hexes were unable to harm her master. It was to date, the strongest defensive Companion Beast in the West.

The master of Headless Angel relied on her defensive powers to explore dimensional zones amidst many mysterious dangers-ones that humanity believed were forbidden-returning safely every time.

Hence, the fame of Headless Angel intensified. But based on what Zhou Wen knew, there was only one Headless Angel Companion Beast, and its owner wasn’t Liz.
