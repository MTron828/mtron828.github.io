Chapter 1298: You Apparently Call Him Teacher

“Not bad. You can still tell from my voice,” said Lord Fourth with a smile.

“I never expected the famous Lord Fourth, who has a wide circle of friends, to be the devil of the Federation, Jing Daoxian.” Zhou Wen stared at him warily as he sized him up. He increasingly felt that this person was Jing Daoxian. He had a special aura that others couldn’t imitate.

“Others didn’t expect that the famous Deceit King, who suppressed the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians and is currently wanted by both officials and renegades, as well as being the number one person on the bounty list is actually you, Zhou Wen,” Lord Fourth mimicked Zhou Wen’s tone.

Zhou Wen knew that Jing Daoxian had long seen through his identity. It was useless even if he changed his voice in the Dragon King armor. He did not know how he had recognized him.

“How did you know it was me?” Zhou Wen asked.

“You did a very good job changing your temperament, physique, voice, and even your personality. Others didn’t recognize you, but I’m different. The only people who have obtained the Lost Immortal Sutra and haven’t gone mad or died are the two of us. Back then, I used some means to transfer the Lost Immortal Sutra to you. Although I didn’t master it, I still know a little about it. That’s how I was able to determine clues from you.” Lord Fourth paused before saying, “You should just call me Lord Fourth. The appearance of Jing Daoxian isn’t suitable yet.”

“You will feel fear too?” Zhou Wen was somewhat curious. He didn’t know who a devil like Jing Daoxian would be afraid of.

“It’s not that I’m afraid. It’s just unsuitable.” Lord Fourth explained very patiently, “Back when I saw you, I was seriously injured and nearly died. That was why the bureau caught up to me. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have seen me. Speaking of that injury, a large part of the reason was because of the Lost Immortal Sutra.

“In my life, I am bent on completing anything I set my mind to. However, there are two things I haven’t done. One is that I lost to that hypocrite. The second is that I failed to master the Lost Immortal Sutra.”

“Hypocrite?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

“It’s the Zhang family’s Hero King as you people call him,” said Lord Fourth.

Zhou Wen immediately understood that Jing Daoxian’s loss to the Hero King was probably referring to the matter of the number one beauty of the Federation.

Lord Fourth continued, “Back then, all those who came into contact with the Lost Immortal Sutra went crazy. However, I refused to have my beliefs shaken. Others can’t master it, but I insist on mastering it. What others can’t do is fun for me. I originally thought that it was only an Essence Energy Art. Even if it’s meant to be cultivated by an Immortal Emperor or Buddha, I would still be able to find a way to make it serve me.”

“I never expected to fail at taming it. I almost died in the Holy Land because of it,” Lord Fourth said with a sigh.

“You entered the Holy Land back then? How did you enter? Isn’t it said that only low-level humans can enter the Holy Land?” Zhou Wen had always wanted to enter the Holy Land to take a look because the former principal was likely inside a particular Holy Temple there, but he hadn’t found a way to enter.

“I naturally have my means if I wish to enter.” Lord Fourth smiled and said, “However, it’s best you don’t go. Even if you have the power to suppress the League of Guardians and the Holy Spirit Association, you still won’t be able to leave alive.”

“What’s inside? What’s going on with the six Holy Temples?” Zhou Wen had never figured out the relationship between the six Holy Temples and the dimension. All he knew was that it seemed to be the dimension’s contact point on Earth, similar to a temple or church in the human world.

“Do you know the phrase ‘concession settlement?'” Lord Fourth asked a question instead of answering.

“I’ve heard of it. It’s a rather ancient saying. It seems to be an office rented by a country in another country.” Zhou Wen thought for a while before recalling what the phrase was about. When he had studied history in the past, there had only been a few mentions of it in textbooks.

“The Holy Land is equivalent to a concession settlement of the dimension on Earth. Nothing there is restricted by the rules of Earth. The dimensional creatures can descend freely. Even Calamity-grade or Apocalypse-grade creatures can appear there and unleash their full might. You’ve been there before. Thankfully, you weren’t qualified to let them take a second gander at you back then. That’s why you were able to return alive. If you were to go again now, I’m afraid you wouldn’t be so lucky anymore,” said Lord Fourth.

Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed. If that was the case, he was considered lucky to return alive.

“If you can return alive, why can’t I?” Zhou Wen wasn’t convinced. He wanted to know more from Jing Daoxian.

Lord Fourth looked at Zhou Wen with a teasing look and said, “I came back alive because I could steel my heart. I’m afraid you wouldn’t be able to be ruthless when the time comes.”

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen looked at him in puzzlement.

“You’ll know if you go there in the future.” Lord Fourth was clearly unwilling to talk about the Holy Land. He must have done something unspeakable there.

Zhou Wen thought for a while but failed to figure out what he was talking about.

“Don’t tell me you came to talk to me about this? What do you want?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Didn’t I get Liu Yun to tell you a long time ago? I want you to help me leave my name on the rankings,” said Lord Fourth.

“Why don’t you do it yourself?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Lord Fourth doesn’t have the ability to enter the rankings,” said Lord Fourth.

His words were a little awkward, but Zhou Wen still understood what he meant. What he meant was that with the status of Lord Fourth, he shouldn’t have the ability to enter the rankings. Others would definitely suspect him if he really did it.

“Did you really make a bet with someone?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Yes.” Lord Fourth nodded.

“What did you bet on?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“Someone on my side has to be on the rankings within three months. Otherwise, I’ll have to kowtow and admit my mistake,” Lord Fourth said casually.

“Who did you make the bet with?” Zhou Wen had heard from Liu Yun that Lord Fourth had made a bet with someone, but he had no idea who he had made the bet with.

Zhou Wen wasn’t curious about this matter previously, but he was somewhat curious now that he knew that Lord Fourth was Jing Daoxian.

Jing Daoxian was definitely not someone who would do something for no reason. He had definitely made a bet with someone, so if he knew who he was betting with, Zhou Wen might figure out what he was up to.

“Regarding the person who made the bet with me, you apparently call him teacher,” Lord Fourth said with a faint smile. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Who did you say?” Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he looked at Lord Fourth. His eyes were about to pop out as his face filled with disbelief.

He naturally knew who Jing Daoxian was talking about, but he couldn’t believe it.
