Chapter 789: Gu God’s Reincarnation

Translator: CKtalon

Worm Dugu beat him to it and said, “I think Li Xuan’s talent is passable, so I plan on taking him in as a disciple. You should also consider it. It’s not too late to regret being my eldest disciple.”

Zhou Wen immediately understood what was going on. Li Xuan’s Life Soul had fused with Li Mobai’s Evil King Gu, so he had some Gu characteristics.

Worm Dugu must have taken a fancy to this point, so he wanted to take Li Xuan in as his disciple.

However, Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were good friends. Worm Dugu was afraid that Li Xuan would find it embarrassing if he knew that he wanted to acknowledge Zhou Wen as his master. Therefore, he refused to acknowledge him any further.

“Cut it out. I wonder who stood in front of Zhou Wen’s dorm back then, claiming to be looking for his master.” Li Xuan curled his lips and said, “Don’t worry. I, Li Xuan, am a man of my word. As long as you can beat me in a bet, I’ll definitely acknowledge you as my master. However, if you lose...”

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Li Xuan already knew that Worm Dugu wanted to acknowledge him as his master.

“Stop. It’s impossible for me to lose,” Worm Dugu immediately said.

Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan what was going on and Li Xuan explained the situation in detail. Only then did Zhou Wen know why Worm Dugu had persuaded Li Xuan to come to the South District.

After Zhou Wen left, Worm Dugu happened to bump into Li Xuan, who was taking something from Zhou Wen’s place. The two sides had a verbal clash. Worm Dugu wanted to use his Gu to deal with Li Xuan, but his Gu didn’t dare approach Li Xuan. This left Worm Dugu alarmed.

After many tests, Worm Dugu realized that Li Xuan’s Life Soul was the nemesis of Gu.

Raising a phoenix was also to restrain Gu. As for Li Xuan himself, he could restrain all sorts of Gu. With such talent, Worm Dugu was tempted to make Li Xuan his disciple and learn how to rear Gu from him.

Li Xuan obviously wasn’t willing but Worm Dugu didn’t give up. He showed Li Xuan the magical effects of many Gu and even said that he wanted to help Li Xuan capture Mythical Gu.

Li Xuan was truly tempted when he saw the strange and magical abilities of the Gu. However, because Worm Dugu had wanted to take Zhou Wen as his master, Li Xuan wasn’t too willing to be Worm Dugu’s disciple. Therefore, he made a bet with Worm Dugu.

If Worm Dugu could capture the famous Ice Silkworm Gu King, Li Xuan would agree to be his disciple and learn how to rear Gu from him. The Ice Silkworm Gu King would be Worm Dugu’s greeting gift to his disciple.

If Worm Dugu couldn’t capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King, he would have to take Li Xuan as his master and teach him how to rear Gu.

Regardless of the outcome, Li Xuan won’t suffer a loss. For Worm Dugu to be willing to suffer such a huge loss, does he really think highly of Li Xuan, or does he have other motives? Zhou Wen thought to himself, momentarily unsure.

“If not for someone causing trouble, I would have long captured the Ice Silkworm Gu King and taken him in as a disciple,” said Worm Dugu.

Li Xuan curled his lips and said disdainfully, “If someone hadn’t barged in and diverted the attention of the Ice Silkworm Gu King, we would probably have died there. To think you call yourself the number one expert in Gu rearing in the South District. How embarrassing.”

Li Xuan recounted what had happened. Originally, Worm Dugu had taken Li Xuan to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King with the intention of using Li Xuan’s Life Soul to restrain the Ice Silkworm Gu King. With his abilities, he could capture it in one fell swoop.

However, to their surprise, the Ice Silkworm King Gu wasn’t just one, but two. Just as they were about to succeed in trapping one Ice Silkworm King Gu, another Ice Silkworm King Gu suddenly appeared, catching Worm Dugu off guard. The two of them nearly died there.

Thankfully, at that time, there was a group of people who wanted to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King as well. They diverted the attention of one of the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings, allowing them to escape.

“Now, that group of people is still setting up a trap to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings. I think they have more tricks up their sleeves than this old man. I reckon they have most likely succeeded,” Li Xuan said.

“Bullsh*t. Do you think it’s that easy to capture the Ice Silkworm King Gu? With those few useless bums from the Xiao family, they won’t be able to capture the Ice Silkworm King Gu even if they were given another ten years. It’s more like they will all die there,” Worm Dugu shouted as he jumped.

“The Xiao family? Which Xiao family?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he asked Worm Dugu.

“Which Xiao family could it be? Only in a small place like Chiang Rai can the Xiao family stand firm,” Worm Dugu said disdainfully.

“I heard that the Xiao family is very powerful. Not only are they good at nurturing Gu, but they also use black magic and Kuman Thong. The Xiao family also has a Mythical-level Kuman Thong...” Zhou Wen said.

Worm Dugu seemed to view the Xiao family with great contempt. When he heard that, he pulled at his beard and said, “There are many bigwigs who know black magic, Kuman Thong, and Buddha plaques in the South District. The Xiao family doesn’t even rank high. They were able to gain a foothold in Companion Beast not because of their excellent techniques, but because they don’t abide by the rules and are ruthless. Do you know how the Xiao family’s Mythical Companion Beasts came about?”

“How did it come about?” Zhou Wen and Li Xuan looked curiously at Worm Dugu.

“More than twenty years ago, there was a family in Chiang Rai. The couple raised Gu and they were rather famous in the South District. They raised Gu, but they never harmed others with them. Later, the wife got pregnant. Ever since she got pregnant, wild Gu often appeared around her house. Those Gu only guarded outside her house, but not a single Gu entered. It was as if they were guarding something. The closer to the wife’s delivery date, the more Gu appeared around her house. There were even Mythical Gu.”

After taking a deep breath, Worm Dugu continued, “Back then, everyone said that the child the wife was carrying was the reincarnation of the Gu God. That was why she attracted all the Gu to protect her. Although the Gu wouldn’t harm them, they caused a lot of trouble for the neighbors nearby. Therefore, the couple had no choice but to move to a remote place to live. Not long after, someone discovered that the couple had died tragically at home. The wife’s abdomen had been sliced open and the baby was nowhere to be seen.”

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan felt their blood run cold when they heard that. They heard Worm Dugu continue, “Most people believe that the Gu harmed the couple and took away their child. However, a member of our Dugu family had a good relationship with the couple. According to him, the head of the Xiao family had a good relationship with the couple. When he went to meet the couple, he even met the head of the Xiao family. Furthermore, more than a year after the couple died, the Xiao family produced a powerful Kuman Thong. Furthermore, ever since then, the Xiao family, who originally only knew Kuman Thong and black magic, began to rear Gu. Don’t you think it’s too much of a coincidence?”

“It does sound like a coincidence, but it might not be related. Does your Dugu family have any evidence?” Li Xuan asked.

“If there was evidence, we would have wiped out the Xiao family long ago. How could we let them live until now? However, I think that the matter was most likely done by the Xiao family,” said Worm Dugu.

Zhou Wen felt that Worm Dugu’s words made sense. Although he didn’t know much about the Xiao family, he had seen Xiao Si before and knew how ruthless he was. He was definitely capable of such a thing.

Wait a minute. The Xiao family wants Wang Chan. Don’t tell me they want to use her to cultivate Kuman Thong? Zhou Wen hurriedly asked Worm Dugu. “Do you need a baby to refine Kuman Thong? Can older people be refined into Kuman Thong?”

“Typically, children between the ages of 0 and 12 can be used to create Earth Babies and Man Babies. That was the method of the past, but the method now is even crueler.” Worm Dugu didn’t elaborate.

“From 0 to 12 years old?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Wang Chan seemed to be around 11 or 12 years old. Furthermore, she had the Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence, making her extraordinary.
