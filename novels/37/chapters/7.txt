Chapter 8: Zhou Lingfeng

Translator: CKtalon Editor: CKtalon

Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it. The thoughts of others had nothing to do with him. All he wanted was to score well at the combat test during the college entrance exams. From that, he could enter a reputable school before focusing on gaming. After cruising through college and graduating, he could then get a job related to the dimensional zones.

However, there was one thing that Zhou Wen took notice of. Fang Ruoxi’s mention of his defeat under An Jing’s hands had made him realize something was amiss. It was something he hadn’t thought too deeply about previously.

An Jing was about his age and was perhaps a little younger; yet, she was very likely already a Legendary stage expert. Although they were just separated by one stage, it was a night and day difference between the Mortal and Legendary stages. It was almost impossible for someone at the Mortal stage to defeat a Legendary stage expert.

The clearest indicator of a Legendary stage expert was the opportunity to obtain a Companion Beast. And at the Mortal stage, it was very difficult to obtain Companion Beasts. Even if one did get a Companion Egg, they lacked the Primordial Energy to carry out the incubation.

There were also many opaque differences. For example, after a human advanced to the Legendary stage, they would awaken their Legendary Life Providence, greatly augmenting their constitutions. It also widened the gap between Mortal stage and Legendary stage.

Unless there was any reason that prompted action, the typical Legendary stage expert found it beneath them to attack people at the Mortal stage. For An Jing to challenge him, a student at the Mortal stage, and then transfer out of the school shortly after the challenge, it appeared as though she had specially come to beat him up.

“I’ve never left Guide City all my life. How could I have offended someone like her? Could it be Dad...” As Zhou Wen thought about it, he came up with one possibility.

Zhou Wen’s mother had passed away during childbirth, causing him to be brought up in a single-parent family. As for his dad, he was an unreliable man.

Zhou Wen’s father was named Zhou Lingfeng. Like the word ‘feng’ symbolizing ‘wind’ in his name, he was like a gust of wind. From the age of five, Zhou Wen learned to be independent. He had to do simple cooking, laundry, and the management of household matters, as well as do groceries.

And in the words of his unreliable dad, this was to nurture his survivability as a man. It would also be the foundation on which he would use to get a wife.

Although his dad was very lazy, there was something that left Zhou Lingfeng slightly relieved. Zhou Lingfeng had never missed out on paying his living expenses.

As a polyglot, Zhou Lingfeng did translation work. When Zhou Wen was young, his father often translated documents from home. However, with the improvement in technology, translation software became much better and Zhou Lingfeng’s work reduced as a result.

When Zhou Wen grew a little older, he became more independent, so Zhou Lingfeng took on interpretation work. He often went out of town for a week or even as long as a few months.

The latest instance was more ridiculous. Zhou Wen hadn’t seen his father in half a year. If it wasn’t for his monthly living expenses being transferred into his account, he would have been worried his father had died.

This was because Zhou Lingfeng often went to relatively remote places. The reception conditions there were often terrible, so it was common for him to be uncontactable. Zhou Wen was used to it.

Even if he wasn’t used to it, it wasn’t as though he could do anything about it other than waiting for Zhou Lingfeng’s return.

Their home was made up of two men. Zhou Wen had no chance to offend a figure like An Jing, so he was highly suspicious that his dad had offended her. Failing to find him, all she could do was to vent her anger on his son.

Zhou Wen had zero confidence in his dad. He was the kind of person that indulged in pleasures. He was also someone who often spent time at bars. He had often hit on chicks in the past, only to be beaten up by the woman’s male partner.

Luckily Zhou Wen was able to fend for himself. If not, he wondered if Zhou Lingfeng would even have had the ability to raise him.

As he thought about it, his phone suddenly rang. With his mind wandering, Zhou Wen jumped. After taking out his ordinary phone, he realized it was from his father, Zhou Lingfeng.

Speak of the devil. Zhou Wen hurriedly picked up the call. Just as he was about to say something, he heard Zhou Lingfeng’s voice: “Son, I’m getting married. Will you be coming to my wedding?”

Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t drinking any water; otherwise, he would have spewed it all out.

“You’re getting married? To whom?” Zhou Wen wasn’t against Zhou Lingfeng getting married. After all, he had been single for so many years, so it was very normal for him to find a partner. Besides, he might become more reliable after his marriage, so it could be a blessing in disguise. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I’ll send Sweety’s photo to you,” Zhou Lingfeng said. Before Zhou Wen said a word, the phone hung up and a photo was sent.

Zhou Wen glanced at the photo and saw Zhou Lingfeng with a young woman. The woman looked to be in her thirties at most. She was elegant and beautiful, and she had a rather good presence. She looked different from the so-called beauties on the Internet. This lady had a sensual aesthetic and a unique presence that could hardly be described with words.

“How’s it? Your new mom isn’t too bad, right? Her name is Ouyang Lan,” Zhou Lingfeng called again and said smugly.

“Not bad, but she’s not my mom,” Zhou Wen said.

Although he didn’t mind Zhou Lingfeng getting remarried, he didn’t plan on acknowledging a new mother at his age. After all, Zhou Lingfeng wasn’t home most of the time and he was already accustomed to living alone. It was also not necessary that the lady would like baggage like him, so it would be quite nice if they led their own separate lives.

“My wife is naturally your mom. That’s an undeniable fact. By the way, my wedding is in a few days. You have to come, alright?” Zhou Lingfeng said indifferently, as though he took nothing to heart.

“Where is it? When is it?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Luoyang. In a week,” Zhou Lingfeng said.

“I’ll be taking the college entrance exams in a few days. The period you mentioned happens to clash with the combat test which I plan on participating in. I won’t be able to go even if I wanted,” Zhou Wen said helplessly.

He was willing to participate in the wedding, but he really couldn’t go.

“Wow, time passes so quickly. You are already having your college entrance exams.” Zhou Lingfeng clearly didn’t remember this as he made a poignant comment.

Zhou Wen didn’t expect his father to know it, but he was still somewhat disappointed hearing him say that. Perhaps Zhou Lingfeng had even forgotten that he was graduating from high school this year.

“Dad, do you know that metal biscuit tin inside our wardrobe?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked.

“Biscuit tin? What biscuit tin?” Zhou Lingfeng asked in puzzlement.

“The one that’s about thirty centimeters long. It’s a biscuit tin that’s squarish and made of metal. It has a picture of a cartoon bear...” Zhou Wen described the biscuit tin’s characteristics in detail.

“Oh, that bear biscuit tin. I often ate from it when I was little. However, that brand of biscuits isn’t sold anymore. The one we have at home was probably left behind. Why are you asking about it?”

“Inside that bear biscuit tin is a cellphone. Did you put it in?” Zhou Wen’s heart raced slightly. That cellphone was the mysterious phone he was using.
