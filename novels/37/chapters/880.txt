Chapter 881: Crazy Escape

Translator: CKtalon

Without a word, Zhou Wen rode the Earth Elemental Beast and used Earth Escape to get far away.

However, after the Earth Elemental Beast’s Earth Escape ended, he realized that the elder had also appeared beside him. He had also used Earth Escape to follow him.

Zhou Wen cursed inwardly as he made the Earth Elemental Beast use Earth Escape again. This time, Zhou Wen chose to let the Earth Elemental Beast expend all its Essence Energy in one go and use a long-distance Earth Escape that spanned hundreds of kilometers.

Just as he came out of the Earth Escape, he saw the elder walk out from a tree beside him. He was like a ghost hidden in the tree.

Wood Escape Art? Zhou Wen’s heart chilled.

Not only did the elder know the Earth Escape technique, but he also knew the Wood Escape technique. If not for the fact that he couldn’t use it in the imperial mausoleum, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have escaped so easily.

“You won’t be able to escape,” the elder said coldly as he stared at Zhou Wen. He wasn’t anxious at all as he slowly approached Zhou Wen like a cat chasing a mouse.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used the teleportation ability of the Civilized Country. At the same time that the teleportation ended, he activated the invisibility power of Invisibility Cloak.

After activating the Invisibility Cloak, he teleported several times and changed the direction of his escape.

However, soon, Zhou Wen realized that the elder had followed him again. In front of the elder was something that resembled a hairpin. No matter where Zhou Wen fled in, the hairpin would point in his direction.

The elder clearly couldn’t see Zhou Wen, but under the hairpin’s guidance, Zhou Wen couldn’t shake off his tail.

Zhou Wen was extremely anxious. He only had three minutes of complete invisibility. If he couldn’t shake off the elder in three minutes, ordinary invisibility was useless against such an expert.

There’s less than two minutes left of complete invisibility. If I don’t destroy that hairpin-like thing, it’s impossible for me to escape. Zhou Wen made a prompt decision and stopped running. He suddenly changed his position and exploited his invisibility to slash at the hairpin floating beside the elder.

The elder chased in the direction the hairpin pointed, but the hairpin could only point in a direction, not the location. He never expected Zhou Wen to have the guts to turn around and charge back.

By the time he realized it, Zhou Wen was already in front of the hairpin. The Light Concealment Sword slashed at the hairpin with the power of Immortal Slaying.

Almost at the same time, the elder with the cold eyes threw a crystalline palm at Zhou Wen’s chest. It was so fast that it was difficult for him to dodge.

Zhou Wen had no intention of dodging. The Light Concealment Sword slashed at the hairpin, slicing it into two.

As for Zhou Wen’s chest, it was destroyed by the elder’s palm, turning into white smoke.

When the white smoke dissipated, Zhou Wen had already vanished. A shattered paper talisman floated to the ground.

He actually has a Substitute Talisman. The elder frowned slightly as he searched for Zhou Wen’s tracks, but he didn’t find anything.

Without the hairpin, the elder couldn’t determine Zhou Wen’s location.

“You won’t be able to escape.” The elder took out a few copper coins and condensed his Essence Energy. He threw them to the ground and began calculating with his fingers, as though he was trying to divine Zhou Wen’s location. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, after calculating for a while, a look of puzzlement appeared on his face. Strange. My six lines of insight can’t divine his location?

Zhou Wen was frantically running for his life when he suddenly felt something tremble. On a second look, he realized that it was something Ya’er was wearing.

It was the three copper coins and red string that Zhou Wen had taken out of the Pixiu’s stomach when he had killed it.

Later on, he gave it to Ya’er who wore it on her wrist. At that moment, the copper coin actually trembled automatically for some reason.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare stop as he continued fleeing with Ya’er. Thankfully, the elder didn’t chase after him again. The invisibility time limit had passed as Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief.

All this time, he drew Substitute Talismans whenever he had the time. Up to now, he had only succeeded in drawing two. He had just used one, leaving him with only one.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay any longer. He summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and made it rush into the mountainous area at its fastest speed.

Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of getting lost since he had the Pocket Universe’s positioning. He was just afraid of encountering an unknown dimensional zone. However, at this stage, he couldn’t care less. All he could do was escape in the direction of the more concealed areas.

After crossing one mountain after another, Zhou Wen didn’t know how far he had run. There were no more roads and he found himself by a small river.

Zhou Wen followed the river. There was a large peach blossom forest on both sides of the river. The peach blossoms landed in the river and flowed along it, making the river appear especially beautiful.

After walking for more than five kilometers, he reached the end of the river. The area ahead was blocked by a mountain. Just as Zhou Wen was about to go around the mountain, he saw a gap that allowed him to pass through. He could vaguely see the light from the other side of the mountain.

Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate as he passed through the mountain crack.

The mountain crack was extremely narrow when he first entered. After walking for a short distance, it gradually widened. Soon, Zhou Wen passed through the mountain and saw a beautiful valley in front of him.

There were many wooden houses and bamboo buildings in the mountain valley. There were bamboo forests and flowers everywhere. Similarly, there were large peach trees. The wooden houses and bamboo buildings dotted the area, like a paradise on earth.

What’s going on? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. This was because after he passed through the mountain crack, he failed to determine his location with Pocket Universe.

This place... Could it be that legendary place? Zhou Wen sized up the valley with a strange expression as he suddenly thought of an essay he had read in school.

The essay was called “Peach Blossom Spring.” It mentioned that a fisherman had accidentally entered a peach blossom garden. There he saw a beautiful village that was isolated from the world. However, after he left, he couldn’t find the peach blossom forest or the village no matter how hard he tried.

No matter how Zhou Wen looked at it, it seemed to be identical to the place described in Peach Blossom Spring. The only difference was that in the Peach Blossom Spring in the essay, there was a group of Pre-Qin villagers who had taken refuge in war. However, although there were wooden houses and wooden buildings here, Zhou Wen didn’t see anyone. He didn’t even see a chicken or dog.

Using Truth Listener’s ability to scan the valley, he felt as though there was a fog enveloping the valley. He could see it with his eyes, but he couldn’t see anything with Truth Listener’s ability.

It doesn’t matter if this is Peach Blossom Spring, it’s definitely a dimensional zone. Zhou Wen was somewhat curious as he summoned a group of Poison Bats and got them to fly into the village to scout and see what was inside.

However, after the Poison Bats left Zhou Wen’s line of sight, he suddenly lost contact with them. This made Zhou Wen’s expression turn nasty.

“Is anyone there?” Zhou Wen called out to the depths of the valley, but no one answered him. Instead, his voice echoed in the valley repeatedly.

“Is anyone there... Is anyone there... Is anyone...”
