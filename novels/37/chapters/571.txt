Chapter 572 Killing Qiongqi

The duo went all the way to the Qiongqi temple. With Torch Dragon as their main force, An Sheng and Zhou Wen didn’t even plan on entering.

Before the temple door opened, Zhou Wen summoned Six-Winged and Torch Dragon. At the same time, he summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

“Is this tiger-riding Companion Beast also at the Mythical stage?” An Sheng asked curiously as he sized up the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

“It’s not at the Mythical stage. It’s just an Epic Companion Beast. However, his Life Providence has some restraining effects on Qiongqi. It will make killing Qiongqi easier,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

These words were very honest. Without the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, Torch Dragon could only kill Qiongqi in its World King Transformation state. And with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, there was no need to use the World King Transformation. A single Bright Torch Vision World would seal the deal.

“There’s actually a Life Providence that can restrain Mythical creatures. Although it’s at the Epic stage, it’s sufficiently precious,” An Sheng commented.

“Yes, it wasn’t easy to obtain it. It’ll probably be difficult to find a second one,” Zhou Wen said as he opened the temple door.

Qiongqi was inside the temple. The moment the door opened, it pounced forward. However, due to the influence of the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, its speed decreased significantly.

Under Zhou Wen’s orders, Torch Dragon activated the Bright Torch Vision World to which Qiongqi dodged. Unfortunately, its speed was greatly reduced and it failed to escape. Torch Dragon immediately swept its gaze at it, making it disappear.

“Torch Dragon is really too strong! It will be unreasonable if it can’t get first on the rankings,” An Sheng praised when he saw Qiongqi being settled so easily.

Zhou Wen also felt that Torch Dragon was very strong, but he wondered if it could defeat the guardian of a white cocoon.

“Unfortunately, after being killed by the Bright Torch Vision World, nothing will be left. Even if dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs drop, I won’t be able to take them out. There are a lot of limitations,” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s not too good, but it’s still very strong. There are some mysterious dimensional zones with many good things inside, but they are protected by terrifying Mythical creatures. It’s almost impossible to get the treasures out. Having this Torch Dragon makes things much simpler. When I’m free later, I’ll take you to those places to take a look. After a spin through them, we’ll definitely be able to obtain some good things,” An Sheng said.

The duo entered the Qiongqi temple. Inside the stone temple, there were also many stone sculptures and murals. Many of the murals depicted a huge battle. Various creatures that looked like monsters and ghosts were fighting, while humans were just cannon fodder. The monsters were the main combat force.

The two of them carefully explored the temple several times, but they didn’t find any passageway or any clues left behind by the former principal.

Zhou Wen didn’t discover anything different about the temple versus the in-game temple. It was completely identical.

“Let Professor Lei and the rest come over and study it. They are the professionals in this area. If there are any clues, they will definitely discover them,” An Sheng said.

“That’s all we can do.” Zhou Wen nodded helplessly.

He now knew that the former principal and company were doomed. They had either been killed by Torch Dragon or eaten by Qiongqi. No matter what the possibility was, there was no need to investigate further.

Zhou Wen planned on returning to school. The outcome was no longer important to him. No matter how the former principal died, it was impossible for him to come back to life.

“Wait another two days for me. When I’m done here, we can return together. I can also take you to kill a few Mythical creatures on the way. It’s a crime not to use such a powerful Torch Dragon and Six-Winged Guardian Dragon,” An Sheng said.

“What will you be doing here?” Zhou Wen looked puzzled as he asked.

“Of course I have to find Qu Qingyun,” An Sheng said.

“Will he still be here?” Zhou Wen felt that Qu Qingyun had definitely escaped Zhuolu.

“According to the time, he was definitely still inside the underground ruins when we entered. The underground ruins only have one exit. I planted some Companion Beasts at the exit, but I haven’t detected his departure. That means he’s definitely still here,” An Sheng said.

“When did you set up the Companion Beasts? Why didn’t I know?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

“It’s an ordinary Companion Beast. Apart from being small, it doesn’t have any special abilities. However, it’s very useful for monitoring,” An Sheng said.

“Alright, I also want to know why Qu Qingyun did that. Before I came, he hadn’t done anything. Yet, he took action after I came. This clearly isn’t a coincidence.” Zhou Wen felt that Qu Qingyun was targeting him, not Professor Lei and company. Otherwise, he could have done it long ago.

“If I want to find him, I’ll have to rely on Love Letter,” An Sheng said as he summoned Love Letter.

Although its name was Love Letter, it looked like a huge scorpion. There were many strange blood-colored texts on its body. No matter how one looked at it, it had nothing to do with a romantic love letter.

“Does Love Letter have the ability to find people?” Back when An Tianzuo fought Love Letter, he was also present. He had never seen Love Letter display such abilities.

“It doesn’t have the ability to find people, but its language skills will be useful.” An Sheng left the temple with Love Letter.

Zhou Wen followed beside him and saw that Love Letter would open the wall or the ground at a fixed distance every time. The words quickly fused into the rock.

There were also some words that landed on the plants in the ruins, like grass. It was unknown what they could do.

“Although these words don’t have any offensive power, Love Letter will naturally sense any creature that passes by. I left something in all the necessary areas. Unless Qu Qingyun doesn’t move in the ruins, we will be able to catch him sooner or later,” An Sheng explained.

“Take your time. I wish to visit the underground sea.” Zhou Wen had nothing to do, so he wanted to take a look.

Zhou Wen had already explored most of the Zhuolu underground ruins. Now, he didn’t even have a place to explore. All that was left was the underground sea.

Ignoring the nine black dragons and the cocoon in the war wagon, there was also something strange inside the sapphire sky. Zhou Wen planned on taking this opportunity to take a look. Perhaps, in reality, he could discover something he couldn’t see in-game.

“Alright, I still need a while. You can take your time.”

After separating from An Sheng, Zhou Wen headed for the underground sea. There weren’t many things that could threaten him in the underground ruins. Even against the nine black dragons, Zhou Wen had the strength to fight them.

Of course, that was under the circumstances that the nine black dragons were chained. If their shackles were unlocked, Zhou Wen would have to rely on Torch Dragon.

When he passed the white desert, Zhou Wen saw the tattered flag and the skeleton sitting under it. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Apart from suddenly waking up the first time Zhou Wen passed by, the skeleton didn’t react.

Zhou Wen carefully sized up the symbol on the animal hide flag. It was indeed the symbol of a ship’s anchor. He wanted to ask the skeleton what their flag meant, but unfortunately, the skeleton remained motionless like a dead object.
