Chapter 728: Concerned Person

Translator: CKtalon

Truth Listener’s ability allowed Zhou Wen to hear the internal structure of the television.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t know much about circuit boards, nor did he notice anything amiss. He didn’t discover any Companion Beasts or dimensional creatures inside, but he realized that there was an electric current flowing inside.

It’s impossible for there to be no problems. Zhou Wen checked several times, but he failed to find anything wrong.

He tried turning the television off with the remote control, and it was switched off again. It looked no different from a normal television.

What the hell? Could it be that the electric current produced by the thunderstorm has run into the television, giving it electricity? Zhou Wen studied it for a long time, but he still couldn’t figure out why there was electricity in the television. However, even he couldn’t come to terms with his guess.

I want to see what’s messing around. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to monitor the entire hotel and the nearby area. Nothing could escape his ears even in the heavy rain.

Zhou Wen sat on the log and stared at the television.

Boom!

After a while, thunder sounded in the sky again. It felt like the lightning was very close, as though it had exploded outside the building.

Suddenly, the television lit up and the movie started playing.

“Cut the crap. Take off... Ah, take off your clothes... Hey, what are you doing... Are you trying to kill me... You’re really amazing. I don’t even mind you beating me to death...” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Zhou Wen kept staring at the television, while Truth Listener kept monitoring all its components. However, for some reason, there was suddenly electricity in the television.

There were no suspicious signs inside or outside the inn. There was no one, nor were there any dimensional creatures.

Strange. Could it be that the lightning outside has entered the television? Zhou Wen felt that this matter was odd. Ignoring the fact that the lightning couldn’t be transmitted in, even if it could, it would only damage the components. It was impossible for the television to work normally.

This time, Zhou Wen didn’t switch off the television. He sat there watching. The television had plenty of power. It continued playing even after quite some time.

“Who can be more miserable than me!” A person on the television tragically cried out at the sky before collapsing to the ground.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but laugh when he saw this.

Although he found it odd, this old movie was still quite funny.

Even if there’s really someone causing trouble, I might only end up falling for someone’s scheme if I were to leave this place and enter the heavy rain. I’ll just take a wait and see approach for now. Zhou Wen decided to turn off the television and sleep on the log.

He kept Truth Listener’s ability active the entire time. Zhou Wen would immediately know of any movement. He also switched his Essence Energy Art to Dao Sutra. With the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder Life Soul, he could be somewhat safe.

The television kept playing old movies, one after another, but other than that, nothing else happened.

After sleeping deep into the night, Zhou Wen suddenly heard footsteps coming from the entrance of the hotel. He immediately woke up. With Truth Listener’s ability, he immediately saw a strange person run in.

The person’s clothes were tattered and his hair was charred black. He looked like he had just been struck by lightning.

He finally can’t hold back? Zhou Wen sat up and monitored the person’s every move.

After the person entered, he sniffed around before walking towards Zhou Wen’s room.

He’s indeed coming for me, Zhou Wen thought.

When the person arrived at the door, Zhou Wen was waiting for him. He wanted to see what tricks he had up his sleeve, but he never expected the person to knock on the door a few times.

“Who is it?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he asked after some thought.

The person outside said, “Zhou Wen, I’m here to snitch. You have to be careful along the way. Someone wants you dead, and it’s not just one.”

“Who wants me dead?” Zhou Wen asked.

“You should know the Dugu family and the Zhang family of the Federation’s six families, right? The Dugu family’s Dugu Ge and the Zhang family’s Zhang Chunqiu both want your life,” the person outside the door answered.

“I have no grudge with them. Why do they want me dead?” Zhou Wen asked again.

This time, the person outside didn’t answer. Instead, he asked, “You’re going to the Imperial Capital, right?”

“What has my whereabouts got to do with them wanting to kill me?” Zhou Wen didn’t quite believe the person in front of him. This person looked problematic.

“They don’t want you to enter the Imperial Capital alive,” the person outside said.

“Why?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Don’t worry about the reason. Just be careful.” The person prepared to leave.

“Who are you? Why are you telling me this?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“Just call me Concerned Person,” the person said firmly and turned to go downstairs.

If it wasn’t for the fact that his clothes were tattered and his hair was charred black, he would have looked rather cool.

Zhou Wen found the name Concerned Person familiar. After being stunned for a while, he recalled that wasn’t the name used frequently in primary school composition?

Who is this person? Zhou Wen frowned.

He naturally wouldn’t completely believe this person’s words, but from the looks of it, he really didn’t have any ill intentions.

Is he behind the television? Zhou Wen was somewhat unsure.

The television was still playing, so Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it. He decided to sleep first and wait for the rain to stop. After all, he was determined to make this trip to the Imperial Capital. He would deal with whatever came his way. There was no use worrying.

Not long after he fell asleep, Zhou Wen heard someone enter the hotel again.

Tap! Tap! Tap!

After the person entered the hotel, he didn’t even take a sniff before heading to the second floor and running towards Zhou Wen’s room.

His appearance was similar to the person from before. He was also wearing tattered clothes and his hair was charred black. However, it was obvious that he wasn’t the same person. This person was taller.

Could it be that the person in question is here? Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, the person had already arrived at the door. He had actually raised his hand to knock.

“Who is it?” Zhou Wen asked patiently.

“Are you Zhou Wen?” the person at the door asked.

“I’m Zhou Wen. Who are you?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I’m just a nobody. If you’re happy, call me Nameless. I’m here to tell you that someone wants to harm you on your way to the Imperial Capital. You have to be careful,” the person outside said.

Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss as he asked calmly, “Who wants to harm me?”

“It’s the Dugu family’s Dugu Ge and the Zhang family’s Zhang Chunqiu. You have to be careful of them.” The person outside said the exact same thing as the person who had just come.

“Who are you?” Zhou Wen asked.

“There’s no need for us to know each other. Let’s meet again if fate allows for it.” With that said, the person went downstairs.
