Chapter 253 Introspection Silence

“Overseer, the people you invited have arrived. Would you like them to immediately head to Zhuolu County?” An Sheng came to An Tianzuo’s office and asked.

“Let them rest at the villa first. After I’m done with my work, I’ll head to Zhuolu with them,” said An Tianzuo.

“Overseer, are you really heading to Zhuolu personally?” An Sheng asked.

“My mom is there. If I don’t go, how can I feel at ease?” An Tianzuo said.

“Overseer, please consider it carefully. Even if you were to go, Madam won’t change her mind because of your request. When that happens, it will be hard to deal with the situation on both ends. Neither will Madam be invited back, nor will Chess Mountain have you around. There will be no way to resolve problems that happen. When the time comes, the An family’s business and the Luoyang City that you swore to protect will be destroyed. If that happens, Miss Luo won’t be happy if she learns of it,” An Sheng said.

Upon hearing the words “Miss Luo,” An Tianzuo’s eyes revealed a strange look. However, he said coldly, “Don’t mention it to Little Luo. It won’t work this time. Filial piety is most important of all the virtues. My mom is in such a dangerous place with her life possibly at risk at any moment; how can I sit at home?”

“Then let me ask you. Will Madam return if you go?” An Sheng asked.

“No, but I can accompany her to the ancient battlefield,” said An Tianzuo.

“You can indeed do that, but what about Luoyang? It can’t run without someone watching it for even a single day. This place needs you. Besides, even if you accompany Madam to the ancient battlefield, won’t she still be in danger? You can’t guarantee that she will be safe and sound,” An Sheng said.

“If I don’t go, she will be in even greater danger.” An Tianzuo was adamant.

“The safest way is to persuade Madam back. Actually, there’s a way to get her back,” An Sheng said with narrowed eyes.

“And what do you plan on doing? How are you going to persuade her?” An Tianzuo curled his lips. He knew Ouyang Lan’s character very well. Since she had decided to go, no one could persuade her to return.

“I’m definitely not capable of doing so, but there’s someone who can,” An Sheng said.

“Who? Uncle Feng? I’m afraid he can’t do it either. If he could, my mother wouldn’t have gone to Zhuolu.” An Tianzuo shook his head slightly. Ouyang Lan wouldn’t give up on her thoughts and principles for Zhou Lingfeng.

The reason she chose Zhou Lingfeng was partly because he was a man who knew how to respect her.

“Uncle Feng naturally can’t, but there’s someone who can,” An Sheng said confidently.

“Who else?” An Tianzuo frowned slightly, but he couldn’t figure out who An Sheng was referring to.

“Overseer, how could you forget that there’s still Zhou Wen? Madam wanted Zhou Wen to take the risk in the Holy Land in An Jing’s stead. Although Zhou Wen returned safely and even benefited from it, he has offended the six families because of this. With Madam’s personality, she definitely feels that she owes him. With Zhou Wen’s relationship with the former principal, if Zhou Wen were willing to persuade her, Madam might have a change of heart. No offense, but letting Zhou Wen go will be more effective than both you and Miss Jing,” An Sheng said.

“No way. There’s no need for an outsider like him to interfere with the An family’s matters. Besides, he’s only a Legendary student. Going to a place like Zhuolu would only add trouble to the mix. Who knows what trouble he will cause.” An Tianzuo immediately objected.

“I’m afraid that to Old Mr. Ouyang, you are an outsider. He treats Zhou Wen better than he treats you. This time, Zhou Wen has taken the initiative to request to go to Zhuolu, so we can get him to persuade Madam. I think it’s rather suitable. It’s more useful than you going,” said An Sheng.

An Tianzuo frowned and thought for a moment before saying, “Watch him well. Don’t let him cause any trouble. Also, if he wants to go, it has nothing to do with our An family. He can’t blame others even if he dies there.”

“Overseer, don’t worry. I will watch over him and not let him cause any trouble,” said An Sheng hurriedly.

Zhou Wen received An Sheng’s notification that he would be setting off for Zhuolu tomorrow. Therefore, he had no choice but to head to Wang Mingyuan’s place at night to bid farewell.

“You are going to Zhuolu?” Wang Mingyuan frowned slightly when he heard Zhou Wen say that.

“Yes, the former principal treated me like family. If I don’t go, I will never be able to feel at peace,” Zhou Wen said. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Zhuolu is an inauspicious land. It’s fine if you don’t enter, but if you enter, it will be very difficult for you to escape unscathed,” said Wang Mingyuan after some thought.

“I know my strength is limited, so I’ll only wait outside. I won’t enter the dimensional zone,” Zhou Wen said.

When Wang Mingyuan heard that, he only smiled and patted Zhou Wen on the head. “Although you haven’t been with me for long, I know your personality quite well. If you don’t wish to do something, why would you travel so far?”

Zhou Wen opened his mouth to explain, but Wang Mingyuan waved his hand, gesturing for him to not say any more.

“Wait a moment,” Wang Mingyuan said. He walked to his desk, took a piece of paper and pen, and wrote a few words. Then, he folded the paper into a small square and placed it into a metal box the size of a matchbox.

“Take this. If you really find yourself trapped in that inauspicious land, open the box and read the words on it. It might be beneficial to your situation.” As Wang Mingyuan spoke, he stuffed the tiny metal box into Zhou Wen’s hand.

“Thank you, Teacher.” Although Zhou Wen felt that it was useless, he respectfully received it with both hands and bowed in thanks.

“How many times have I told you that there’s no need for all these proprietaries with me? Look, when did Ziya ever say ‘thanks’ when he took something from me?” Wang Mingyuan smiled.

“I’m different from him, but I respect you the same way.” Zhou Wen shook his head and said. He really couldn’t be like Zhong Ziya.

However, Zhou Wen had an indescribable sense of familiarity towards Wang Mingyuan. It was as though his fate with him was like the former principal. With his cold personality, he couldn’t help but get close to him.

Wang Mingyuan thought nothing of it. He took a book from his desk and handed it to Zhou Wen. “You should have plenty of free time on your way there. You can’t forget your homework. Take this book and tell me your understanding and thoughts when you’re back.”

Zhou Wen took the book and agreed. Wang Mingyuan didn’t keep him any longer and told him to return to do some packing. After Zhou Wen exchanged a few more words with the reading Jiang Yan, he saw that Zhong Ziya and Hui Haifeng weren’t around. Since it was late, they probably wouldn’t be coming, so he bade everyone farewell and left.

After informing Li Xuan and company, he asked Wang Lu to take care of the antelope. Zhou Wen went to the supermarket again and bought large quantities of food and water, placing them in the chaos space to prepare for emergencies.

The tiny metal box that Wang Mingyuan had given him had also been placed into the chaos space. He had no intention of entering the dimensional zone, so it definitely had no use.

He picked up the book that Wang Mingyuan had given him and flipped through it. He realized that it wasn’t about palm techniques, but was a book named “Introspection Silence.” It was filled with Wang Mingyuan’s experience and insights. However, it wasn’t about his experience in experimenting, but his experience in cultivating the various realms.

Although the book didn’t have any cultivation methods or techniques, Zhou Wen read with relish as though he had obtained a treasure.
