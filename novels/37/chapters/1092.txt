Chapter 1093: Tiger General’s Might

Translator: CKtalon

The reason Zhou Wen maintained the state of the Heaven-Opening Scripture was to prevent any accidents.

If the bigwigs that had just kicked Ya out were still having a meeting, it would be too unjust for them to reach a conclusion and kick him out too.

Thankfully, what Zhou Wen was worried about didn’t happen. No special power descended on him. Instead, the Guardians’ challenges constantly appeared in front of him.

Zhou Wen took a look and realized that many Guardians who hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade had issued a challenge to him. His heart stirred as he chose to accept the challenge from one of the Mythical Guardians.

The Guardian’s name was Flaming Battle God. Zhou Wen really didn’t know which family his contractor was from. However, just from the name, he knew that it was definitely a fire-elemental Guardian. Furthermore, its ranking wasn’t high. It hadn’t even entered the top ten. The possibility of it being at the Terror grade was almost zero.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel disappointed when they saw that he had chosen Flaming Battle God and not the powerful Cave Era.

After all, Flaming Battle God was much weaker than Grim Demon. Even Grim Demon had automatically admitted defeat, so it was impossible for Flaming Battle God to be his match.

However, there were people who didn’t think so. Now, many human experts knew that when Guardians contracted humans, they valued potential, not absolute strength. Grim Demon chose Human because of his talent, not because of his strength.

The human wearing the armor of Flaming Battle God entered the arena. He was originally a little nervous, afraid that the strange person in front of him was really as powerful as Grim Demon. Then, he would be in danger the moment he appeared.

However, when he saw that the other party had summoned a Companion Beast and had it rush over, it was clear that his opponent planned on letting a Companion Beast fight him. He immediately felt relieved and he became emboldened.

“Why is it a Companion Beast? A Companion Beast is definitely not a Guardian’s match. Don’t tell me he wants to use a Companion Beast to win?”

“From the looks of it, that Companion Beast seems to have some fire-elemental abilities.”

“Does anyone know what Companion Beast that is? Why do I feel like I’ve never seen it before?”

The Companion Beast Zhou Wen had summoned was none other than the Mythical Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. It could be said to be the nemesis of fire-elemental powers. It was perfect for dealing with Flaming Battle God.

The reason Zhou Wen did so was because he didn’t want to scare away the Guardian, nor did he want the big shots to use the cube’s rules to kick him out.

If the Heaven-Opening Scripture couldn’t withstand the cube’s rules, he could at least kill a few Guardians before being kicked out.

“Using fire in front of me?” Seeing the strange flames burning in the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body rush over, the human wearing the armor of Flaming Battle God sneered. The flames on his body lit up as he condensed a huge flaming saber and slashed at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

The Tiger Soul General raised its spear to block. After the flaming saber collided with the spear, it immediately transformed into a sea of fire that drowned the Tiger Soul General in flames.

Amidst the flames, the Tiger Soul General’s armor turned red like iron in charcoal. It seemed as if it would melt into liquid metal at any moment.

“What’s going on? Isn’t using a Companion Beast to fight a Guardian a waste of time?”

“Not only is it a waste of time, but it’s also a waste of Companion Beasts. A perfectly fine Companion Beast will probably be killed soon. That’s a Mythical Companion Beast. It’s such a waste.”

“Quickly fight like Ya. Unleash your strength and kill the Guardian.”

People clearly didn’t wish to see a Companion Beast fight. Although Zhou Wen had previously showcased many of his Companion Beasts, it had only been for show and not a real battle.

To most people, it was impossible to use a Companion Beast to defeat a Guardian.

Under Zhou Wen’s control, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General seemed to charge at Flaming Battle God without any regard for its own safety. However, its armor had already been burned red. The situation didn’t look good.

Flaming Battle God slashed out again with his flaming saber, hoping to defeat the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

The flaming saber struck the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body, causing sparks to fly. It was as though the iron liquid on his body had splattered. Furthermore, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was forced to retreat. Its body was enveloped by more flames and the Tiger Soul General could no longer be seen. All one could see was a figure wrapped in flames retreating in the sea of flames.

“He’s actually not dead yet?” Flaming Battle God frowned slightly. He planned on finishing this Companion Beast quickly.

After all, wasting too much time on a Companion Beast was a disgrace to him.

He gathered his strength and slashed out the flaming saber repeatedly. The flaming saber slashed crazily at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General in the sea of fire, forcing him to constantly retreat. More and more molten metal splattered out from his body, but after he retreated again and again, the Tiger Soul General that looked like it was about to collapse remained alive.

Flaming Battle God realized that something was amiss. He immediately stopped and used the Wheel of Destiny’s power to repel the Tiger Soul General. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Terrifying flames turned from red to golden as they rose from Flaming Battle God’s body. They condensed into a golden flaming chariot that charged at the Tiger Soul General with roaring battle intent.

Everything melted in the wake of the Golden Flaming Chariot. Even the red flames that originated from Flaming Battle God were melted by the golden flames.

Boom!

The Golden Flaming Chariot slammed into the Tiger Soul General’s body. The flaming wheels spun crazily as though it wanted to crush and melt everything.

The Tiger Soul General’s body was constantly pushed back by the Golden Flaming Chariot. Soon, it was pushed out of the sea of flames.

At that moment, people realized that the Tiger Soul General’s body was burning with purple-red flames. It looked extremely strange. Even its armor had turned crystalline like an amethyst from the purple-red flames.

He wasn’t injured at all. None of the previous attacks had harmed him.

The Tiger Soul General raised the spear with both hands and blocked the Golden Flaming Chariot. Not only did the flames of the Golden Flaming Chariot not injure him, but it also made the flames in his body burn brighter.

Flaming Battle God could tell that there was something wrong with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General, but it was too late. With a boom, the spear in the Tiger Soul General’s hand slammed down and shattered the Golden Flaming Chariot, turning it into golden flames that scattered.

In the next moment, the strange-looking ferocious tiger under the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General let out a roar and charged at Flaming Battle God.

When Flaming Battle God saw that the situation had gone south, he summoned a dragon and a war hammer. They were Mythical Companion Beasts. He rode the dragon and sent the war hammer towards the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

Despite fighting three alone, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s ferocious might did not decrease. The tiger beneath it leaped up and stepped on the dragon. Wherever the tiger claw passed, it left several wounds that burned with purple flames on the dragon’s back, causing it to fall with a tragic cry.

The ferocious tiger used the momentum to pounce at Flaming Battle God. The spear in the Tiger Soul General’s hand met the war hammer. The powerful impact sent the war hammer in Flaming Battle God’s hand flying. He retreated as blood seeped out of his mouth. His expression changed drastically.
