Chapter 1598: Battling Starlord Merciful Song Again

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen was puzzled. Although Tsukuyomi had always expressed her fondness for him, he really couldn’t figure out why she had such a favorable impression of him.

To Zhou Wen, everything needed to be explained with logic, but he really couldn’t figure out why Tsukuyomi had a good impression of him. Therefore, he had always felt that there was something wrong with this matter. However, he couldn’t figure out the problem no matter how much he racked his

brains over it.

If it was for the Heavenly Happiness Token, he had previously agreed to give it to Tsukuyomi, but Tsukuyomi didn’t want it. This reason was clearly not valid.

“Look at this.” Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out why Tsukuyomi had a good impression of him, but at the very least, she wasn’t a threat to him.

“This is a Zone Core?” Tsukuyomi looked at the Moon Essence Basin in surprise.

“Yes, it’s called the Moon Essence Basin. Do you think it’s of any use to you?” Zhou Wen asked as he held it.

“Of course it’s useful.” Tsukuyomi gave an affirmative answer before smiling at Zhou Wen. “Are you giving it to me?”

“Sort of. However, its owner is a Heaven-level creature, Furthermore, it cares a lot about the Moon Essence Basin. It will not spare anyone who has it in their possession. It will come looking for it soon.” Zhou Wen paused before continuing, “I can give you the Moon Essence Basin, but when the time

comes, you have to join forces with me to kill the original owner.”

“Sure.” Tsukuyomi agreed without any hesitation.

“Aren’t you going to consider it? That’s a Heaven-level creature. Furthermore, I heard it’s rather terrifying, It’s also a top existence among Heaven-level creatures,” Zhou Wen said.

“What sort of considerations should I have?” Tsukuyomi asked Zhou Wen with a faint smile.

“At the very least, you should ask about the Heaven-level creature,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“There’s no need,” Tsukuyomi said.

“Why?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand.

“Even if I don’t agree to it, do you think I’ll stand by the side while watching you be killed?” Tsukuyomi said slowly, “Apart from me, no one can touch my man.”

??Zhou Wen’s mind was filled with question marks as he thought to himself, When did I become yours?

However, Zhou Wen felt that there was no point in continuing. Therefore, he threw the Moon Essence Basin to Tsukuyomi. “If it can be used, use it as soon as possible.”

Zhou Wen didn’t wish to give the Moon Essence Basin to Jing Daoxian, nor did he wish to return it to Toad Immortal. It was a good choice to use it to make a deal with Tsukuyomi and obtain her help.

After all, the Moon Essence Basin was useless to Zhou Wen. The Essence Energy Art he cultivated didn’t have any moon-elemental attributes.

“Even so, we have to find a suitable place. This place won’t do.” As Tsukuyomi spoke, she approached Zhou Wen and grabbed his hand. Then, she stepped into the void and instantly vanished.

‘When the spatial teleportation ended, Zhou Wen realized that he had arrived on a planet. It was barren without any signs of life, but there was a thick layer of ice in many places.

Tsukuyomi pulled Zhou Wen’s hand and flashed to the bottom of a glacier cliff. There was an underground ice cave there with a snow-white fur blanket and some daily necessities. It was likely where Tsukuyomi lived.

“The universe is too dangerous. Terrifying cosmic creatures might appear at any time. I need two days to absorb the Moon Essence Basin. In these two days, I won’t have the ability to resist external forces. I’ll have to trouble you to protect me.” With that said, Tsukuyomi sat down on the white fur and held

the Moon Essence Basin in her hands.

Bright moonlight immediately rose from the Moon Essence Basin and enveloped Tsukuyomi’s entire body as though a bright moon was right in front of her.

One could vaguely see Tsukuyomi in the bright moon. The moonlight was as blurry as a veil, allowing one to only see Tsukuyomi’s beautiful figure from her silhouette. It added a mysterious beauty to her.

Two days. Toad Immortal wouldn’t arrive that quickly, right? Zhou Wen took out a chair from his chaos space and placed it near the entrance of the ice cavern. He sat on the chair and took out his phone to continue grinding.

As he grinded the dungeons, Zhou Wen remained sufficiently alert. Truth Listener and Great Brahma’s abilities were circulated to their limits. Any commotion nearby couldn’t escape his notice.

Zhou Wen chose to enter the Big Dipper instance dungeon. He had killed the first three Starlords and they hadn’t respawned. Zhou Wen went straight to the fourth Star Palace where the guardian was Starlord Merciful Song.

The last time Zhou Wen came, he was stored in the book in Starlord Merciful Song’s hand.

This time, Zhou Wen didn’t give Starlord Merciful Song a chance. He summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and ordered it to attack him.

Starlord Merciful Song didn’t dodge the Golden Wyrm Scissors. The book in his hand automatically opened as strange words appeared, transforming into a treasure beam that struck the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors was indomitable, but when it was illuminated by the treasure glow, it involuntarily flew into the book and landed on it. It transformed into a picture of the Golden Wyrm Scissors that was imprinted on the page.

Holy sh*t, is Starlord Merciful Song that impressive? They are both at the Hell level, but he actually managed to subdue the Golden Wyrm Scissors! Zhou Wen was alarmed. Starlord Merciful Song was stronger than he imagined.

However, Zhou Wen could tell that the book in Starlord Merciful Song’s hand was very powerful, but his combat strength wasn’t much. He guessed that as long as he could get close, it wouldn’t be difficult to kill him.

The key was how to deal with the book. In the past, Zhou Wen could only attempt to charge forward or use something as a shield.

Now, he had an additional choice. He could try to see if the Teacher Domain could seal the book in Starlord Merciful Song’s hand. This was also Zhou Wen’s goal for coming here.

Although the Teacher Domain was very strong, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if it was still effective against high-level domains. He could use the Hell-level Starlord Merciful Song as an experiment.

Seeing the book in Starlord Merciful Song’s hand open again, the text’s treasure glow rushed out of the page and swept towards Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen also summoned the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.

The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder automatically opened as the words inside shimmered with a strange glow. The invisible Teacher Domain also opened and enveloped Megrez Star Palace.

The moment the Teacher Domain enveloped the Star Palace, the treasure glow that rushed out of the Starlord Merciful Song’s book instantly vanished. Even the book that shimmered with text lost its glow. The text vanished and the page turned to white paper.

Haha, the Teacher domain is invincible! Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he summoned the golden sniper rifle and pulled the trigger at Starlord Merciful Song.

Bang!

Starlord Merciful Song had zero combat skills. He couldn’t even dodge a Human Realm sniper bullet. The sniper bullet blasted a bloody hole in his body.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Zhou Wen kept firing, but Starlord Merciful Song dodged in a sorry state, and because he wasn’t good at combat, he lasted until the seventh sure-kill shot before his head exploded.
