Chapter 824: Pocket Universe

How can I kill the Devourer? Behemoth and Torch Dragon aren’t suitable for such battles. Demonic Neonate is still evolving. Who is more suitable?

After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there were only three Companion Beasts that stood a chance. He could use Truth Listener with many earrings released or Primordial Spore’s Parasitizing.

The other Companion Beasts couldn’t see the Devourer, so it was useless no matter how powerful they were.

As for the last method, Zhou Wen would have to wear the Invisibility Cloak so that the Devourer couldn’t see him and attempt an assassination.

Zhou Wen began with the simplest method. He first used the Invisibility Cloak to attempt an assassination. While visibly invisible, the Devourer could still see him. He had to use the three minutes of complete invisibility to prevent the Devourer from seeing him.

However, the assassination failed. The Devourer’s entire body was like a black hole. Zhou Wen went over while invisible and used Immortal Slaying on it only to be sucked in. The game instantly ended.

Therefore, Zhou Wen attempted the second method, hoping to let Primordial Spore parasitize the Devourer. However, after the Primordial Spore entered the Devourer’s body, it was sucked inside and the connection was broken.

With the two methods failing, Zhou Wen could only risk sending Truth Listener. After undoing two earrings, Truth Listener became extremely violent as it tore through space and charged at the Devourer.

The Devourer’s invisibility couldn’t affect Truth Listener. Truth Listener moved like lightning and wasn’t sucked in.

However, when Truth Listener’s claws swiped across the Devourer’s body, it was as though it had sliced through water. No traces of harm were left behind.

Truth Listener failed to gain an advantage in its battle with the Devourer, but it wasn’t devoured either. The situation seemed to be in a stalemate.

However, Truth Listener needed to constantly move at high speeds to avoid being sucked in by the Devourer. Its stamina and Essence Energy expenditure were rather intense. It would definitely not be the Devourer’s match if this dragged on.

Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and ordered Truth Listener to undo the third earring while its stamina was still at its peak.

Another earring on Truth Listener’s ear shattered. As it shattered, Truth Listener’s body underwent a strange change.

Before Zhou Wen could see Truth Listener’s exact changes, he felt an extremely violent and painful thought. It made him feel as though Truth Listener was about to explode.

And on Truth Listener’s body, black flames were rising like a bomb that could explode at any moment.

Zhou Wen directed Truth Listener to attack, but it didn’t listen to his orders. It roared at the sky as though it was resisting Zhou Wen’s orders.

Zhou Wen felt that the connection between him and Truth Listener was about to be severed. It was almost impossible to see, and Truth Listener could already resist his orders.

Return! Zhou Wen forcefully summoned Truth Listener back, but it was still useless.

Thankfully, while Truth Listener was resisting Zhou Wen’s will, the Devourer took the opportunity to devour it and kill it.

Zhou Wen exited the game. The Truth Listener earrings in reality were still there, allowing him to heave a sigh of relief.

After summoning Truth Listener, the dark-gold Six-Eared Golden Silk Monkey appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand. Thankfully, nothing happened. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Indeed, I can’t undo the earrings again. He was still reeling in fear and didn’t dare try again.

Zhou Wen had already tried all the methods he could think of, but there was nothing he could do about the Devourer. He had to think of a way to deal with it. Now, Zhou Wen could only use his invisibility to escape. If he was found again, he would let Truth Listener, who had shattered two earrings, hold it back while Zhou Wen continued exploring the Endless Sea of Stars to comprehend the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.

Using Truth Listener to hold back the Devourer wasn’t too much of a problem.

As Zhou Wen entangled himself with the Devourer, he traveled the Endless Sea of Stars. After some time, he got used to it.

What puzzled Zhou Wen was that apart from the Devourer, he didn’t see a single Mythical Astral Beast in the Endless Sea of Stars.

Could it be that all the Mythical Astral Beasts have been devoured by the Devourer? Zhou Wen guessed.

The Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art’s pocket universe became closer to perfection. Zhou Wen vaguely felt that he was about to condense a Life Providence.

Indeed, in less than two days, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art began condensing a Life Providence. The pocket universe in his body emitted resplendent starlight.

After everything was over, the Life Providence of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art condensed successfully. Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at the Life Providence’s information.

Life Providence: Pocket Universe

This Life Providence is really called Pocket Universe? Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He never expected the Life Providence to match the Essence Energy Art’s situation.

I wonder what Life Providence Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun condensed? Zhou Wen wanted to ask Liu Yun, but he couldn’t find him.

Although the two of them had cultivated the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art, their bloodlines and minds were different, so the Life Providences they condensed would be different.

Pocket Universe: Producing the universe with one’s body.

What does it mean by producing the universe with one’s body? Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss. What did this Life Providence mean?

However, when Zhou Wen switched to the Pocket Universe Life Providence and used the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art, he came to a slight realization.

Zhou Wen didn’t know about the other functions for the time being, but he definitely wouldn’t get lost again. The Pocket Universe Life Providence was like a GPS. No matter where he went, he would know his position in the universe.

Ignoring the fact that he wouldn’t get lost on Earth, Zhou Wen guessed that he wouldn’t even get lost in the universe.

It turns out that this Life Providence is just a locator? Zhou Wen was already suspicious of his previous guess, wondering if the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art was an Essence Energy Art that increased Speed.

The next step is to condense a Life Soul. I’ll first try to see if the Guardian’s blood in the underground sea can help the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art advance. Although Zhou Wen wasn’t the Guardian’s match, it wasn’t difficult to obtain a drop of blood. He could also farm the nine dragons.

The Guardian had a spatial attribute, so Zhou Wen felt that its compatibility with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art was very high. It was highly likely to work.

The nine dragons didn’t drop anything useful as Zhou Wen forcefully extracted a drop of blood from the Guardian. To his surprise, the drop of blood couldn’t be absorbed by the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art.

It doesn’t work? Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat as he had no choice but to head to Ant City to give it a try.

This time, Zhou Wen was still praying that he wouldn’t be compatible with the guardian of Ant City. Otherwise, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art might be an Essence Energy Art that enhanced his Essence Energy. Zhou Wen no longer needed such an Essence Energy Art, so cultivating it was a waste of time.

Zhou Wen tried it in fear, but thankfully, he was unable to absorb it. While Zhou Wen was delighted, he was also somewhat depressed.

Now that the blood from these two Guardians wasn’t working, he didn’t know where to find another drop of Guardian’s blood.

This sure is troublesome. Zhou Wen only knew a few Guardians. Furthermore, once a Guardian contracted a human and truly broke out of the cocoon, their blood would be useless. He had to find a Guardian that had yet to leave its cocoon and then extract their blood essence.
