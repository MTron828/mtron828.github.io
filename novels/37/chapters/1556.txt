Chapter 1557: Works Hard At Killing Master

Translator: CKtalon

The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords’ offensive strength wasn’t very strong among Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts. The Golden Wyrm Scissors’ attack was far stronger than it. Even among Terror-grade Companion Beasts, there were many that were stronger than it.

However, the vine sword actually clashed with the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords first. The vine sword struck the body of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords and sent it flying.

When the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords flew out, Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss. He saw the thousands of swords that had been suppressed by the vine swords slowly fly up.

However, in the past, the swords had flown independently without any pattern. The only similarity had been their target.

But now, it was somewhat different. The swords were clearly centered around the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. No matter how one looked at it, they seemed to be controlled by it.

Hum!

With the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords hum, the thousands of swords ignored the sword intent pressure of the vine sword and charged at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was indeed working hard to carry out his orders, but when Zhou Wen fought the enemy in the past, it had never helped him. Now that Zhou Wen wanted to commit suicide, it was putting in so much effort.

This was the first time Zhou Wen knew that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords could control other swords.

More ridiculous was the ancient sword that had dropped previously. It was probably at the Calamity grade—a level higher than the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords. Logically speaking, it shouldn’t be controlled by the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.

Yet, the ancient sword charged at Zhou Wen with the other swords.

There were also a few other swords of similar strength that rushed over.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

As the vine sword fought the Golden Wyrm Scissors and other Companion Beasts, it had to withstand the bombardment of thousands of swords. The situation immediately became terrible.

Even something as powerful as the vine sword couldn’t gain the upper hand under such circumstances. Zhou Wen also began to suffer injuries.

The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords levitated there motionless as the swords charged forward without any regard for their lives.

Faster! Or it’ll be too late!?Zhou Wen felt that the domain in his body was about to be completed. It would be useless if he was killed after its completion.

However, the swords had already used all their strength, but they still failed to kill Zhou Wen. They had only injured some unimportant spots.

Hum!

Another sword hum sounded. This time, Zhou Wen could clearly hear a sword hum coming from a huge grave.

Up to now, all the swords had basically flown out. However, he never expected that there would still be a sword embedded in a grave.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and immediately recognized that the sword in the grave was clearly the one that had nearly killed him in the past.

Later on, when the vine sword emitted a sword intent, that sword returned to the grave and didn’t fly out again.

At that moment, the sword was resonating incessantly as though it was about to rush out.

Zhou Wen could sense that the vine sword’s sword intent was surging towards the sword on the grave. Clearly, it thought highly of the sword.

As for the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords, it was even more direct. It had already flown to the back of the huge grave and floated beside the ancient sword. The sword hum from its body didn’t stop.

However, the sword intent emitted by the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords wasn’t as domineering as the vine sword. It didn’t seem to be controlling the sword, but more like using persuasion.

The sword in the grave didn’t break out of the grave. It looked like it was hesitating.

The Son of Heaven’s Three Swords is only at the Terror grade after all. I’m afraid it’ll be at a disadvantage.?Zhou Wen felt that things were going south. In a fight for the sword, the higher-level vine sword was naturally at an advantage.

If I had known that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords was so powerful, I would have thought of a way to get it to the Calamity grade earlier. Perhaps I would still have a chance of fighting that vine sword.?As Zhou Wen sized up the sword in the grave, he secretly felt regret. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The sword in the grave looked like an ordinary ancient sword. The three-foot-long sword didn’t look gorgeous. The patterns on the sword were very ordinary. It didn’t look like a famous sword at all. Instead, it looked like a standard issue for ancient soldiers.

However, after seeing it pierce through the Chaos Egg, he knew how terrifying its offensive strength was. It was probably not inferior to the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he heard a sword hum. The sword rushed out of the grave and floated in the air.

At the instant the sword appeared, all the swords seemed to subconsciously retreat a little.

Who is it helping??Although Zhou Wen felt that the possibility of the sword helping the vine sword was higher, he couldn’t help but have some fantasies. He hoped that the power of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords would move it.

Of course, Zhou Wen also knew that it was unlikely, but there was no other way. All he could do was pray.

The sword floated in the air for a while before suddenly turning into a stream of light that flew towards the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.

It’s over!?Zhou Wen was alarmed as he knew that the situation was hopeless.

The destructive power of that sword was too terrifying. It had chosen to help the vine sword, so it was likely that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords would be snapped.

However, to his surprise, the sword only circled the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords once before charging at Zhou Wen.

The sword’s flying speed was unbelievably fast and shockingly ruthless. Zhou Wen didn’t even see how it shot over when the tip of the sword touched his chest.

The vine sword’s reaction wasn’t slow either. It blocked the blade, preventing it from really stabbing down.

A shocking sword clang sounded as Zhou Wen felt his body involuntarily fly backward. The vine sword was actually no match for the sword as it flew back with Zhou Wen.

Son of Heaven’s Sword, oh Son of Heaven’s Sword. You’re really a f*cking good master killer. Such a powerful sword can actually be used by you…?Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised, but he couldn’t describe what he felt.

He was still happy, overall. He saw hope.

Indeed, just as the vine sword flew out, the ancient sword that came out of the grave transformed into a beam of light that penetrated the blood-colored avatar’s chest.

This time, there was no Chaos Egg to help Zhou Wen withstand it. Zhou Wen used his body of flesh and blood to directly experience the ancient sword’s might.

Zhou Wen’s body was already comparable to a Human Realm creature, but at the sword’s blade, he was no different from tofu as he was penetrated.

A huge hole appeared in the blood-colored avatar’s chest as the ancient sword passed through. Furthermore, its sword aura tore through Zhou Wen’s body from the wound.

Zhou Wen had already had a taste of such a destructive sword aura before. However, most of the sword aura back then had been blocked by the Chaos Egg. This time, when it rushed into Zhou Wen’s body without any reservations, Zhou Wen felt as though all his cells were about to be destroyed. There was no buffer at all.

I’m finally liberated!?Zhou Wen secretly heaved a sigh of relief, but he never expected another accident to happen.

The remaining half of the vine sword suddenly disintegrated as terrifying sword intents were released. They drilled into Zhou Wen’s body from all directions.

Half of the vine sword’s sword intent had previously fused into Sword Pill.. After the remaining half entered, Sword Pill immediately lit up as sword intent spewed out, forcefully stopping the terrifying sword aura from spreading through Zhou Wen’s body.
