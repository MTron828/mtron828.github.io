Chapter 1740 Infinite Reset

“How did you know?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise. He had gotten Li Xuan to secretly carry out a search for spatial dimensional zones. Although it wasn’t as exaggerated as absolute confidentiality, he didn’t tell anyone.

“Old Zhou, it’s been so many years, but why haven’t you improved at all? Someone has clearly been paying attention… Ouch…” Before Li Xuan could finish his sentence, Wang Lu pinched him.

“Alright, you guys continue chatting. I’ll leave, alright?” Li Xuan winked at Zhou Wen before turning to leave.

After Li Xuan left, Wang Lu said to Zhou Wen, “I heard from Li Xuan that you are looking for a spatial dimensional zone. Coincidentally, I recently encountered a somewhat special spatial dimensional zone. If you are interested, I can take you there.”

“You could have just given me a call. Why did you make the trip yourself?” Zhou Wen asked.

The corners of Wang Lu’s eyes twitched as her fingers couldn’t hold back the urge. However, she ultimately suppressed it and said to Zhou Wen, “That dimensional zone is somewhat special. It wasn’t convenient to talk over the phone, so I came by myself.” “What kind of dimensional zone is it?” Zhou Wen was fretting over this problem, so he hurriedly asked.

Wang Lu was somewhat disappointed, but she still said, “I still don’t know the name of that dimensional zone. The location is in Lop

Nur.”

“Lop Nur?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

He had heard of this place before. It was west of the East District. In ancient times, it had the names of Earth’s Ear and the Sea of Death. It was said that many strange and bizarre things had happened there before the dimensional storms descended.

“Yes, it’s Lop Nur. There aren’t many dimensional zones there, but it’s very strange. An elder of my race accidentally entered and discovered a dimensional zone…” Wang Lu recounted the situation of the dimensional zone in detail.

The elder from the Wang family had originally gone to the edge of the desert to search for a Companion Beast, but due to an accident, he lost his direction and accidentally entered Lop Nur.

Lop Nur had been extremely dangerous in ancient times, only to become even stranger and more bizarre after the dimensional storms. Anyone who accidentally entered almost never came out.

The Wang family member originally believed that he was doomed, but to his surprise, he discovered a dimensional zone. After something happened in the dimensional zone, he came out alive.

As for the place he came out from, it was no longer a desert. Instead, it was far away on the other end of another sea. That sea was equally famous. It was the Bermuda Triangle known as the Devil’s Triangle.

The Wang family member couldn’t explain what was going on. Many of his experiences were things he didn’t understand, but there were some key experiences that confirmed that he had experienced some special spatial powers.

There were no dimensional creatures in the dimensional zone, but no matter where he went, he would ultimately return to the same place. This wasn’t the bizarre part. What was bizarre were the marks he had left behind.

After realizing that he was lost, the Wang family member left a lighter somewhere and continued walking. After walking for some time, he saw the lighter again. What was even stranger was that he realized that he had an additional lighter on him.

He only had one lighter and had already placed it on the ground as a mark. It was impossible for there to be a second one. However, when he saw his lighter, he subconsciously touched his pocket to find another lighter inside. When he took it out and saw that it was identical to the lighter on the ground, he was shocked.

The Wang family member threw both lighters to the ground. After circling around, he found himself having another lighter.

After circling the area a few times, a pile of lighters appeared in front of him. All the lighters were identical in every way. Even he couldn’t tell which was his original lighter.

“In that case, I’m afraid that it’s no longer just spatial powers. It’s very likely related to the power of spacetime.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and asked, “How did he walk out later? How did he reach Bermuda?”

“He doesn’t know.” Wang Lu shook her head and said, “He fainted in the end. When he woke up, he was already on a beach.”

“That’s interesting,” Zhou Wen said in thought.

“Our family plans on exploring that dimensional zone. If you are interested, you can join us,” Wang Lu said.

“Alright, count me in.” Zhou Wen felt that this dimensional zone was really odd. Perhaps it was really compatible with the Godfiend Era. Even if he didn’t enter, he could try to find the tiny palm symbol.

Even if it wasn’t compatible with Godfiend Era, he had to make a trip to help Wang Lu.

The two of them chatted for a while longer. After setting a time and about how she couldn’t stay long because her family was preparing to explore the dimensional zone, Wang Lu returned to the Wang family.

“Old Zhou, are you stupid? Did your head get kicked by a donkey when you were young?” Li Xuan was rendered speechless when he heard Zhou Wen.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

Li Xuan sighed and said, “You are a beast. You wasted Wang Lu’s efforts.” “What’s wrong? Wang Lu wants to explore the dimensional zone. Didn’t I agree to help her?” Zhou Wen said.

“Need your help? Don’t you get ashamed? With Wang Lu’s luck, would she need your help? Besides, do you know what she meant by raising that matter? Leaving something behind allows another item to appear. Furthermore, it can be infinitely replicated. If one doesn’t throw the lighter, but a high-level Companion Egg or skill crystal, do you know what that means?” Li Xuan wore a look of disappointment.

“That’s really something I didn’t think of.” Zhou Wen was immediately taken aback. He immediately understood the true value of the dimensional zone.

Even if there were no other discoveries, just using this strange phenomenon could produce unimaginable benefits.

“She has informed you of such a huge secret; yet, you only think that you’re helping her? Are you a beast?” Li Xuan couldn’t help but curse.

“In that case, I really owe Wang Lu a huge favor. I’ll have to repay her in the future,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Li Xuan was rendered speechless as though he couldn’t be bothered to say anything else to Zhou Wen. “Do whatever you want. Anyway, if you let Wang Lu down in the future, as your bro, I’ll definitely be on her side.”

With that said, Li Xuan left. He was afraid that if he continued speaking to Zhou Wen, he wouldn’t be able to help but beat him up.
