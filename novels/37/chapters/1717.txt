Chapter 1718 Battling the Pheasant in the Garden

Zhou Wen didn’t know if he should be happy or worried. With the existence of the grass fruit baby, he didn’t have to worry about the Chaos Egg exploding. However, it was also because of the existence of the grass fruit baby that Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. This thing had absorbed so many Essence Energy Crystals that its body was becoming redder and redder. It was like a red-hot branding iron. Who knew what other tricks it could pull.

Although the grass fruit baby didn’t have any offensive strength and hadn’t displayed any powerful offensive means after being trapped by Zhou Wen, with only a notably powerful escape technique, the world was sometimes unpredictable. Water was considered a relatively malleable material that typically couldn’t harm a human’s body.

However, ignoring the floods and tsunamis, just water pressure at a high enough level could slice through rock and steel.

If anything abnormal happened after the grass fruit baby absorbed a large number of Essence Energy Crystals, it might become an existence that was more lethal than the pheasant.

Although he knew of the potential problems, there was no good solution. If he unsummoned the Chaos Egg now, Zhou Wen would have to face the pheasant’s relentless attacks.

The offensive strength displayed by the pheasant was definitely not weaker than Truth Listener.

Of course, Truth Listener’s might wasn’t completely determined by its offensive strength, but to be comparable to Truth Listener in terms of offensive strength gave Zhou Wen a headache.

If it wasn’t for the fact that Truth Listener couldn’t be summoned, I wouldn’t be in such a situation. Zhou Wen steeled his heart and charged towards the stone chamber’s door.

As Zhou Wen expected, although the stone chamber forbade spatial powers, it didn’t forbid entry and exit. The Chaos Egg immediately squeezed out of the stone chamber’s door and rolled into the garden.

The pheasant rushed out as well and continued pecking at the Chaos Egg crazily.

The grass fruit baby’s body was already as red as ruby. The red glow inside was blinding. Thankfully, its body didn’t produce a temperature, so it didn’t cause any substantial damage to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen attempted to use instant transmission in the garden and realized that it wasn’t forbidden. However, when he instant transmitted, the pheasant had already appeared beside him and continued pecking.

Being able to use spatial instant transmission made Zhou Wen feel a lot more at ease. After the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art advanced to the Calamity grade, his instant transmission ability had greatly increased. Although he couldn’t continuously instant transmit without any delays, it wasn’t something an ordinary person could compare with.

Seeing that the grass fruit baby’s body seemed to be undergoing a tremendous change, Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t wait any longer. Once it underwent a qualitative change, his situation might become more dire.

Gritting his teeth, Zhou Wen unsummoned the Chaos Egg and exposed himself to the pheasant.

Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen used Universe Inversion to rapidly and continuously instant transmit, hoping to escape the pheasant’s attack.

In any case, the pheasant’s original target was the grass fruit baby. Even if he was accidentally injured, as long as he survived the first attack, the pheasant would probably chase after the grass fruit baby.

Zhou Wen’s plan was good, but after he instant transmitted, he realized that the grass fruit baby had appeared behind him, sticking to him like a shadow and was lying on his shoulder.

The pheasant pecked down at the same time. It was so fast that instant transmission was impossible to dodge in time.

“If the tiger doesn’t show its might, do you think I’m HELLO KITTY?” The Great Brahma armor on Zhou Wen’s body shimmered with a dark glow as he threw a punch forward.

Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to fight the pheasant head-on because he was afraid that it would be too powerful. Secondly, he was afraid that the commotion caused by the battle would attract other terrifying creatures.

This was Kunlun Mountain, an unimaginable and terrifying place in myths. Legend had it that countless immortals gathered here. Who knew how many terrifying creatures like the pheasant existed here?

However, he couldn’t care less now. He had to stay alive first.

Bang!

Zhou Wen originally imagined that his full-powered strike would destroy a large section of the garden if it collided with the pheasant, but to his surprise, after the fist collided with the beak, there was only a dull thud. The expected explosion and shockwave didn’t happen.

There’s something wrong with this garden! Zhou Wen immediately realized the problem.

Previously, when the pheasant was chasing after the grass fruit baby, they didn’t cause any sonic booms or shockwaves. From the looks of it, it wasn’t because they could control their strength, but because there was some force in the garden that suppressed the spread of energy.

The power of the Heaven-level Great Brahma had annihilative power that could destroy almost everything. However, in the clash with the pheasant’s power, he didn’t gain any advantage.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t at a disadvantage. The pheasant retreated from Zhou Wen’s punch as his legs went limp and he nearly knelt on the ground.

This didn’t mean that Great Brahma’s strength was inferior to the pheasant, but that Zhou Wen’s physique was too poor. His Terror-grade body was still too weak in such a battle. Just the remnant forces that entered Great Brahma’s armor made it difficult for his body to withstand them.

“Holy sh*t, Junior Brother, what’s with your armor? Why is it so powerful?” Liu Yun, who was sneaking a peep from the stone chamber, nearly fell over when he saw Zhou Wen send the pheasant retreating several steps with a single punch. He was so jealous that his eyes turned red.

The pheasant’s ferocity was triggered by Zhou Wen’s punch. It flapped its wings and charged forward with a strange cry, constantly attacking Zhou Wen like a ribbon of light.

Liu Yun couldn’t see the pheasant’s actions at all, but Zhou Wen could see them clearly with Great Brahma’s augmentation. However, Great Brahma wasn’t good at speed. He couldn’t keep up despite being able to see it. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After he brandished his fists to block a few pecks, he found himself unable to dodge the next peck.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to use his body to withstand the pheasant’s peck, he suddenly felt his vision blur. His body had mysteriously appeared elsewhere in the garden.

The grass fruit baby! Zhou Wen immediately realized what had happened. The grass fruit baby lying on him had definitely used an escape technique to dodge the pheasant’s peck.

How could the pheasant give up? It charged over almost at the same time and began fighting Zhou Wen again.

Great Brahma’s destructive power wasn’t afraid of the pheasant’s powerful strength at all. It was just that its speed was inferior. However, every time Zhou Wen was in danger, the grass fruit baby would take the initiative to use an escape technique to help him dodge the attack. It was difficult to determine the victor.

How did Junior Brother cultivate? He actually reached such a stage as a pure human! Liu Yun was dumbfounded as he drooled in envy.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t too happy because his worst fears came true. Deep in the garden, a terrifying aura came from afar.
