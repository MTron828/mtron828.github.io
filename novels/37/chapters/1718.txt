Chapter 1719 Phoenix Breed

Half of the sky in the garden was dyed golden. It was a huge, strange golden bird that looked like a cross between an eagle and a condor. Its golden wings spread out as though they blotted out half the sky.

Holy sh*t, could it be a Golden-Winged Roc? Zhou Wen remembered seeing a creature suspected to be a Roc, but it wasn’t that big, nor did it have such a terrifying aura.

Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure if it was the Golden-Winged Roc, but he was certain that the golden-winged bird was at least at the Heaven level. It might be at the legendary Apocalypse grade. I can’t stay in this godforsaken place any longer. As Zhou Wen fought the pheasant, he rushed towards the stone chamber.

He had failed to find a way out despite fighting in the garden for so long.

The blue sky above the garden had white fluffy clouds. His spatial powers weren’t nullified, but when Zhou Wen wanted to use interstellar teleportation to leave, he realized that he couldn’t contact the stars outside.

The garden seemed endless. No matter in which direction he scanned, all he saw was an endless garden.

The pheasant was cleverer than Zhou Wen imagined. It clearly saw through Zhou Wen’s intentions and stopped fighting him. Instead, it blocked the stone chamber’s entrance—the only way out.

There was a spatial seal in the stone chamber, so he could only forcefully rush in. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth as the Great Brahma armor on his body circulated with dark swirling light, erupting with unparalleled destructive power. Zhou Wen punched the pheasant blocking the door.

Although Great Brahma’s speed was inferior to the pheasant’s, his destructive power wasn’t inferior to it. Zhou Wen wanted to blast the pheasant apart and rush into the stone chamber to escape.

The pheasant had a stubborn temper. Despite knowing that its strength was inferior to Zhou Wen’s, it refused to dodge—it was bent on stopping him.

Just as the fist was about to strike the pheasant, Zhou Wen was secretly delighted when a golden light suddenly rose in front of him. The resplendent golden-winged bird appeared behind the pheasant. Its golden wings bent down to protect its body.

Boom!

The destructive force struck the golden wings, but not a single feather fell. The golden-winged bird’s body seemed to be stronger than the pheasant’s.

“This trope of the older one coming after the younger one is defeated seriously gets old. Junior Brother, take care. I’ll take my leave now.” Liu Yun shouted before burrowing into the hole and leaving without looking back.

Zhou Wen cursed inwardly. From the looks of it, the white pheasant was most likely the golden-winged bird’s fledgling. If a fledgling was already so terrifying, there was no need to mention the golden-winged bird. Just its speed and defense alone made Zhou Wen lose the desire to fight.

The golden-winged bird was clearly infuriated by Zhou Wen’s punch as it let out a screech. Its body emitted a golden glow as it spread its wings that blotted out the sky and fanned at Zhou Wen with a terrifying aura.

Zhou Wen was already prepared to fight a bloody battle with all his might. The black hole-like wheel of light behind the Great Brahma armor spun as though it was connected to hell.

Just as the battle was about to begin, they suddenly heard an ear-piercing and discordant strange cry.

When the golden-winged bird heard the cry, it suddenly stopped flapping its wings and slowly retreated.

What does it want? Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the pheasant and the golden-winged bird behind it. The pheasant was still screaming at the golden-winged bird. The golden-winged bird took a few steps back and suddenly made an action that nearly made Zhou Wen’s eyes pop out.

It actually prostrated in front of the pheasant. From the looks of it, it was extremely respectful to the pheasant. It didn’t look like a mother treating her child. Instead, it looked like a subject paying respects to a monarch.

The pheasant screeched angrily at the golden-winged bird that prostrated. Its arrogant look was like a slave owner insulting its slave.

The golden-winged bird lay there motionless. No matter how the pheasant cursed, it remained unmoved as though it was only right for the pheasant to treat it like this.

Heavens! What’s going on? The golden-winged bird looks like the legendary Golden-Winged Roc. Even if it’s not a Golden-Winged Roc, it’s at least a Heaven-level existence. In terms of combat strength, it’s above the pheasant. Why is it so respectful and reverent towards the pheasant? Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.

The pheasant seemed to be done cursing. Then, it turned around and looked at Zhou Wen. In the next second, it pounced over as though it wanted to skin Zhou Wen alive. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Zhou Wen had no choice but to fight the pheasant again. What was depressing was that regardless if the Golden-Winged Roc had done it deliberately or not, it was blocking the stone chamber’s door, preventing Zhou Wen from having the chance to rush in.

What’s up with this pheasant? Zhou Wen was puzzled.

The pheasant’s combat strength was clearly inferior to the golden-winged bird, yet the golden-winged bird was so reverent to it. Apart from having a natural bloodline and race advantage, Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure out why the golden-winged bird was reverent towards the pheasant.

Could it be that this pheasant is a real phoenix? Zhou Wen had no choice but to have his suspicions.

In certain myths, the phoenix had once given birth to the Peacock Bright King and the Golden-Winged Roc. If that golden-winged bird was really a Roc, then the only one who could make the Golden-Winged Roc bow its head in terms of bloodline and race was the phoenix. Even the Peacock Bright King didn’t have such rights.

However, no matter how he looked at it, the white bird in front of him was like a pheasant, not the legendary supreme divine phoenix.

On second thought, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t unacceptable. The chick he reared was also a phoenix. Ignoring the fact that it didn’t look like one when it was young, it still didn’t look like one now.

Despite both being phoenixes, Chick’s level was clearly not as high as the pheasant. This made Zhou Wen suspect that Chick’s phoenix bloodline wasn’t very pure.

Could it be that a real phoenix actually looks like a pheasant? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

The pheasant constantly attacked Zhou Wen, seemingly determined to kill him personally.

Although the golden-winged bird had no intention of attacking Zhou Wen after being reprimanded by the pheasant, it kept eyeing him covetously.

From the looks of it, if the pheasant suffered any damage, it would immediately rush over and tear Zhou Wen to pieces.

From the looks of it, it’s time to use Great Brahma’s true strength. I don’t care if you are a true phoenix. I’ll kill you first. Don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance. You were the one who insisted on courting death. The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in Zhou Wen’s body circulated crazily as the Great Brahma armor over his body became even more mysterious. The black hole halo wheel behind him didn’t change, but it seemed to be devouring everything nearby.

“All life is equal…” Zhou Wen stood in the garden like a Buddha. Faced with the pheasant’s pecking, he slowly closed his eyes and chanted like a Buddha.
