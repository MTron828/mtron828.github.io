Chapter 1742 Identical

He clearly saw the Salt Water Lake behind the boulder, but after passing through it, he saw the same Salt Water Lake. It didn’t seem any different.

“Have we really entered a dimensional zone?” someone asked in puzzlement.

Many people wanted to ask this question. Even Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. After passing through the stone crack, it didn’t seem any different from before.

“It’s different. Very different,” Wang Huaiduan said with certainty. “If we don’t pass through the crack in this boulder, we will leave this Salt Water Lake no matter where we go. And after passing through the crack in the boulder, no matter where we go, we will ultimately return to the lake. It’s as though we are circling around it.”

“Has the loop already begun?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked around.

“It should have already begun. However, after we leave this place, we won’t be able to see this boulder no matter how we walk. In other words, it’s impossible for us to leave this place.” Wang Huaiduan thought for a moment and said, “At that time, I walked for a long time and couldn’t leave this place. I thought I was doomed. I was exhausted and delirious. Back then, a suction force suddenly appeared in the lake and I was swept in. When I woke up, I was already on the coast of Devil’s Triangle. I don’t know how I got out.”

“Third Uncle, come with us. Zhiyuan, stay in front of the boulder with a team.” Wang Lu instructed calmly, looking somewhat like a family head. She was somewhat different from the Wang Lu Zhou Wen knew.

Apart from leaving a five-person team in front of the boulder, the others followed Wang Lu. Zhou Wen was among them.

This time, the Wang family didn’t leave anything behind. They wanted to see if they could still see the five-person team when they returned.

Zhou Wen followed them. At the same time, he used the Teacher Domain to scan his surroundings, especially the lake. If there was really anything strange, it was the most likely problem.

However, after scanning for a while, Zhou Wen didn’t discover anything within the Teacher Domain’s range. There didn’t seem to be any creatures in the lake. Ignoring dimensional creatures, he didn’t even discover ordinary microorganisms.

“The salt content in this lake is very high. A person can float in it when jumping in. Previously, I jumped into the lake, hoping to find some dimensional creatures as food, but I didn’t discover anything,” Wang Huaiduan said as he walked.

Wang Lu only listened quietly without saying a word. Everyone stuck to circling the lake without wandering off. After walking for a period of time, they estimated that they had circled the lake once, but they still didn’t see the boulder that they used for entry.

“It’s indeed a little strange.” Zhou Wen frowned slightly. He didn’t sense any changes in space. The boulder and the Wang family members guarding it had vanished. This dimensional zone was indeed not simple.

“Little Li, act according to plan,” Wang Lu said to a youth from the Wang family.

The youth nodded and stayed by the lake. The others continued circling the lake.

The youth had some of the Wang family’s Companion Eggs on him. If he had duplicates of those Companion Eggs when they found him, the Wang family would really make a

killing

“This dimensional zone is indeed a little strange. Be careful,” Zhou Wen walked beside Wang Lu and whispered to her.

He had a nagging feeling that something was amiss. Or rather, this dimensional zone made him uneasy.

“Mr. Zhou, don’t worry. The last time I came, I circled this place for a few days and didn’t find any dimensional creatures. I even spent quite some time in the lake. If there were any dimensional creatures, they would have long eaten me,” Wang Huaiduan said.

“There’s nothing wrong with being careful. Everyone, focus,” said Wang Lu. The Wang family members responded and continued circling the lake. Perhaps Zhou Wen was too sensitive, but they didn’t encounter anything along the way.

Zhou Wen guessed that they were about to circle the lake. He focused his gaze forward, hoping to see Little Li.

He saw him. It was similar to when they left. Little Li was sitting by the lake, fiddling with the sand in boredom.

As Zhou Wen watched, his expression suddenly changed.

“Little Li is there!” After walking for a while, someone finally saw Little Li and shouted in pleasant surprise.

“Quick, let’s see if the Companion Eggs on him have doubled.” Everyone became excited as they quickened their pace towards Little Li.

As they ran, everyone slowed down again, revealing looks of horror.

This was because they realized that the Little Li sitting there wasn’t one, but two. Two identical Little Lis sat side by side.

The reason Zhou Wen’s expression changed drastically was that he had seen two Little Lis. Furthermore, he couldn’t tell which was the real Little Li under the Teacher Domain. Or rather, both Little Li were real.

“Even humans can be replicated?” Even at a close distance, Zhou Wen still couldn’t tell what was different between the two Little Lis.

At that moment, the two Little Lis also discovered Zhou Wen and company. They immediately got up and ran towards them. As they ran, they shouted, “Family Head… Not good… Something strange happened… There’s an additional me… No… Something is impersonating me…”

There was nothing wrong with what he said. The problem was that the two Little Lis’ words were identical. Even their expressions were identical. Instantly, everyone was stunned.

“Little Li, stand there and don’t move,” Wang Lu said as she stared at the two Little Lis. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Without any hesitation, the two Little Lis stopped as though they fully trusted Wang Lu.

“Take out the Companion Eggs you have on you,” Wang Lu continued.

The two Little Lis removed their backpacks and took out the Companion Eggs inside. There were a total of seven Companion Eggs. Each Companion Egg was different, but the Companion Eggs of the duo were identical, like twins.

“I should have known. This godforsaken place can replicate the lighter, so it’s possible to replicate humans as well. We shouldn’t have left Little Li here,” Wang Huaiduan said with a sigh.

“Family Head, Third Uncle, quickly think of a way. I don’t want to have two of me,” the two Little Lis said with a sullen expression.

Wang Lu was momentarily at a loss. She couldn’t tell which Little Li was the original Little Li. She couldn’t help but look at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen shook his head slightly. He couldn’t tell which Little Li was real either.

“Leave the Companion Eggs here now. Let’s continue walking.” Wang Lu thought for a moment and got someone to put down the Companion Eggs they had brought along. Then, she took the two Little Lis along and continued circling the lake.

Now, they really didn’t dare to leave a human here. They couldn’t even deal with the two Little Lis. If they ended up making a few more Little Lis, his wife would probably be in a difficult position when he returned.
