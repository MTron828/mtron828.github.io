Having heard their conversation, how could Zhou Wen not understand what was happening? The Dugu family’s guess was right. Back then, the ones who killed the mother and dug out the fetus weren’t Gu, but the members of the Xiao family.

They cultivated the fetus into a Kuman Nee and raised it to the Mythical level.

Zhou Wen’s understanding of Kuman Nee was very limited. He didn’t know how Kuman Nee matured, but he believed that the Xiao family had tried their best.

Now that they couldn’t control the Kuman Nee anymore, they wanted to refine Wang Chan into another Kuman Nee to restrain Gu Lady Kuman Nee.

What a diabolical Xiao family. In such an era, it’s not wrong to desire becoming stronger. It’s not wrong to use all sorts of means, but to be so vicious, one has to be prepared to be treated the same way by others. Zhou Wen’s heart was filled with killing intent.

Zhou Wen wanted to summon the Light Concealment Sword and kill Xiao Liuqi and Xiao Tianfang first. The two of them definitely weren’t innocent. He could make a judgment on the other members of the Xiao family when the time came.

Just as he was about to make a move, he suddenly realized that the girl was standing in front of him, seemingly trying to stop him from making a move on Xiao Liuqi and Xiao Tianfang.

Zhou Wen looked at the girl in front of him and suddenly understood something. He thought to himself, Could this girl be the Gu Lady they refined into a Kuman Nee?

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible. The person enshrined in the temple hall was likely Gu Lady Kuman Nee. Then, this strange girl might very well be the Gu Lady after growing up.

Typically, Kuman Nee wouldn’t grow, but after combining a Kuman Nee and an Essence Energy Art, anything was possible.

She’s now under the Xiao family’s control. If I kill the Xiao family, she will definitely become my enemy. With this in mind, Zhou Wen temporarily didn’t take action.

Gu Lady was a pitiful person. If she wasn’t born magical, she wouldn’t have been harmed by the Xiao family. Even her parents died tragically. She was refined into Kuman Nee before she was born. It could be said that she was extremely tragic.

Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if she could survive if he killed her master, so he decided not to take action.

Xiao Tianfang thought for a moment and continued, “Regardless of whether the Wang family has noticed it or not, let’s put Wang Chan’s matter aside for now. Let’s try our best to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King. If we have the Ice Silkworm Gu King, we won’t have to rely too much on Gu Lady’s strength.”

“It’s not easy to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King. I originally thought that with Gu Lady’s help, we would be able to capture the Ice Silkworm Gu King. After knowing that the Ice Silkworm Gu King isn’t just one, but a pair, Gu Lady probably isn’t a match for the pair of Ice Silkworm Gu Kings either. I still need to think of something else,” Xiao Liuqi said.

“How’s the taming of the Mythical Blood Scorpion Gu going? Can it be put to use?” Xiao Tianfang asked after some thought.

Xiao Liuqi said with a bitter smile, “I don’t know why, but the Mythical Gu that we used Gu Lady to capture are especially difficult to tame. The three from before were domesticated for so long, but they refuse to yield no matter what. This one is slightly better, but it’s barely under our control. It can’t be controlled freely.”

“That’s enough. Let’s take it with us to distract the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings. As long as the pair of Ice Silkworm Gu Kings are separated, Gu Lady should be more than enough to deal with one.” Xiao Tianfang looked at Kuman Nee on the offering table and continued, “Prepare the Blood Scorpion Gu. We’ll go tomorrow to prevent any delays. Worm Dugu is also eyeing the pair of Ice Silkworms. We can’t let him succeed ahead of us.”

“I understand. I’ll prepare now,” Xiao Liuqi replied.

“Do a good job. In the future, the position of family head will be taken over by you. However, as family head, you need to have strength that can convince everyone. If you can successfully capture the pair of Ice Silkworm Gu Kings, you can tame and control one of them,” Xiao Tianfang said.

“Tianfang, you are still in your prime...” Xiao Liuqi was immediately overjoyed, but he didn’t dare show it.

Xiao Tianfang waved his hand. “I know myself. All these years, in order to suppress Gu Lady, my body has been deteriorating day by day. My mind is also failing. In the future, the Xiao family will have to rely on you. You should also shoulder the responsibility.”

“Tianfang, don’t worry. I definitely won’t let you down,” Xiao Liuqi hurriedly said.

“Alright, make the preparation. I hope that capturing the Ice Silkworm Gu King will go smoothly.” Xiao Tianfang gestured for Xiao Liuqi to leave.

After Xiao Liuqi left, Xiao Tianfang stood in front of the Kuman Nee. He reached out to touch the crystal barrier outside and said with a strange expression, “It’s been so many years, but I still haven’t been able to completely tame you. Now, my plan to capture Wang Chan and refine her into a Misfortune Kuman Nee has also failed. If you still don’t submit, I can only take the final step. My body really can’t take it anymore. After I obtain the Ice Silkworm Gu King, I’ll completely erase your consciousness. Although that will greatly reduce the Kuman Nee’s spirituality and abilities, you’ve forced me into a corner. I can only take such measures...”

Xiao Tianfang looked at the Kuman Nee for a while before leaving the yard.

From beginning to end, the girl stood in front of Zhou Wen, preventing him from harming Xiao Tianfang.

“Why are you protecting him when he caused you to be in this state?” Zhou Wen asked.

The girl remained silent, but Zhou Wen seemed to think of a reason. He asked, “Is it because he’s your master? If he dies, will you be injured?”

Surprisingly, the girl nodded, as though confirming Zhou Wen’s words.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he saw the girl finally react. He asked, “Then is there a way to prevent you from being injured?”

The girl just looked at him without answering.

Zhou Wen snapped to his senses and knew that the girl couldn’t speak. Therefore, he pointed at Kuman Nee on the offering table and said, “If he transfers that to me, will you be ok after he dies?”

The girl reacted this time and nodded again.

“Alright, I know what to do. Wait a few days. I’ll quickly rescue you,” Zhou Wen said to the girl before turning to leave the temple hall.

The girl seemed to understand what he meant and didn’t stop him. After Zhou Wen left the yard, he temporarily left the Xiao family.

Gu Lady was very magical, so Zhou Wen didn’t wish to see her die with Xiao Tianfang. He planned on getting her transferred to him before settling Wang Chan’s score with the Xiao family.

After Zhou Wen left the Xiao family, he returned to his residence and gave Gu Shanshui a call. Thankfully, he had already arrived at Mong Hsat and had a phone signal. He quickly answered the call.

Zhou Wen asked some questions about Kuman Thong and Kuman Nee and confirmed that his plan was feasible.

That night, Worm Dugu and Li Xuan returned together. The situation didn’t look good. Worm Dugu’s expression was especially nasty.

Li Xuan didn’t jibe either. Zhou Wen knew that Worm Dugu’s failure must have been tragic, so Li Xuan didn’t say a word.
