Chapter 1304: Give it a try

Zhou Wen thought about it and felt that it was true.

If he hadn’t met the requirements, how could these ferocious beasts ignore him?

Since their mission here was to protect the Guardian cocoon, be it voluntary or not, the person who designed all of this definitely had a way to make them eliminate anyone who came here.

Up to now, they had no intention of attacking him. Grim Demon’s words seemed to make sense.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t lose his rationality because of Grim Demon’s speculation. He felt that it was only a possibility. If he guessed wrongly and randomly touched the Guardian cocoon, the apes who had no intention of killing him might immediately turn hostile.

However, being trapped here wasn’t a solution. Zhou Wen planned on probing the way.

With a thought, Zhou Wen summoned a Poison Bat and got it to fly towards the gap between the golden-haired ape and the black-gray ape.

Zhou Wen was extremely nervous and his nerves were taut. If the Poison Bat angered the four apes, he could only fight to the death. He might have to use the Immortal Culling Sword again.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t know if it could kill the four apes. After all, he was too weak. He could only use the most basic ability of the Immortal Culling Sword.

Thankfully, what Zhou Wen was worried about didn’t happen. The Poison Bat flew out of the turtle shell’s range without the four apes attacking it.

Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw this. He got the Poison Bat to scout the sea surface and made it fly a distance away. The four apes still didn’t react.

There’s a chance!?Zhou Wen was still worried as he experimented with a few different Companion Beasts. The outcome was the same. They ignored him.

Even Jade Rabbit was released by Zhou Wen. The fellow ran and hopped across the sea, but the four apes didn’t attack it.

Zhou Wen felt relieved as he attempted to walk out.

God bless me. If I can return safely this time, I guarantee that I’ll offer three incense sticks every day and do the ritual of bathing and eating vegetarian food for a month…?Zhou Wen felt uneasy.

Although the four apes didn’t attack him, their eyes followed his path.

“It’s fine looking as long as you don’t attack. We are all gentlemen here. A gentleman uses his tongue, not his fists… Pui… Don’t use your tongue either…” Zhou Wen suddenly thought of the flood dragon’s outcome and hurriedly changed his words.

Slowly, he took three steps. Zhou Wen carefully moved out as he observed the four apes’ reactions. If they had any nasty reaction, Zhou Wen would immediately stop and think of another solution.

However, the four apes didn’t react. They just watched him slowly move.

Grim Demon, who was following Zhou Wen, couldn’t help but break out into a cold sweat. If it was different from what he had guessed, resulting in the angering of the four apes, their outcome would probably be tragic.

Finally, Zhou Wen walked to the golden-haired ape’s side and walked past its legs. He finally left the island-like turtle shell.

Zhou Wen flew to the surface of the sea, feeling delighted. He didn’t care if he met the requirements. Since he could come out, he had to escape.

Due to the earlier lesson, Zhou Wen didn’t dare use instant transmission. He was afraid that he would return to the turtle shell. He summoned his Companion Beasts and Jade Rabbit back before using the Transcendent Flying Immortal movement technique to transform into a stream of light and flew into the distance. In the blink of an eye, he flew thousands of meters away.

Zhou Wen was feeling excited that he had finally escaped. All he needed to do was leave this dimensional zone.

However, just as he smiled, he suddenly felt the world spin. When he snapped to his senses, he realized that he was on a furry claw.

The owner of the claw was the black-gray-haired ape.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. He had clearly sensed spatial powers. Furthermore, it was a spatial power that was at a higher level than his Singularity Universe and Godfiend Era.

To be able to teleport something from thousands of meters away was no mean feat—it was something Zhou Wen couldn’t do.

Even if he used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, he had to leave a mark. Yet, the black-gray ape had teleported him into its palm. This was much harder than Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.

Zhou Wen was a living person with Terror-grade strength—a person who was good at spatial powers. He wasn’t that easily transported.

Zhou Wen already had plans to fight for his life. He quickly flew out of the ape claw and grabbed the hilt of Immortal Culling Sword.

However, the black-gray ape had no intention of continuing. It retracted its claw and returned to the stance of raising the stone artifact with both claws.

This left Zhou Wen taken aback as he thought to himself,?What’s the meaning of this? He captured me and ignored me. Could it be that he feels too bored being trapped here and wants me to stay behind to chat?

“Um… Brother Ape… Do you need any help? Just say the word and I’ll do my best,” Zhou Wen probed the four apes.

No one answered him. The four apes didn’t seem to hear him at all. They continued standing there expressionlessly, staring at him as before. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

What’s the meaning of this? Don’t you want to talk to me? Could it be that Grim Demon was right? I’m a person who meets the requirements. I have to contract the Guardian before I can leave??Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and tried to leave the turtle shell again.

The four apes still didn’t stop him, but when he wanted to leave, he was caught by the black-gray ape again.

The black-gray ape’s spatial technique was much better than Zhou Wen and Liu Yun’s. It was clearly on a higher level.

You aren’t letting me leave, nor do you kill me; yet you allow me to leave the turtle shell. From the looks of it, it’s very likely that they want me to contract the Guardian…?Zhou Wen felt somewhat depressed.

He guessed that once the Guardian was contracted and hatched, the four apes would be liberated. It wasn’t easy for them to encounter a human that met the requirements, so they had to keep him behind.

“My dear ape brothers, do you want me to contract the Guardian in the cocoon?” Zhou Wen asked again as he stared at them, hoping to figure out something.

However, they remained silent without any expression. They looked like old monks in meditation. Apart from staring at Zhou Wen, they didn’t do anything else.

Zhou Wen could tell that the four of them thought nothing of him. They had no intention of communicating with him.

Since they don’t seem to want me dead, I’ll give it a try.?Zhou Wen left the turtle shell again and flew out from the middle of the four apes. However, this time, he didn’t escape. Instead, he flew towards the stone artifact.

When he arrived above the stone artifact, he saw the Guardian cocoon inside with his own eyes. The Guardian cocoon was also a piece of rock, about the same color as the stone artifact. If one didn’t look carefully, they would mistake the stone as part of the stone artifact.
