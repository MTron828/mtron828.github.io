Chapter 1771 Gods’ New Sovereign

My dear baby Neonate, I really didn’t dote on you for nothing… Zhou Wen wished he could hug Demonic Neonate and kiss her twice. Just as he was secretly delighted, he suddenly felt the golden trident in his hand tremble.

The golden gem on the golden trident suffused a strange glow as the tip of the trident automatically pointed in the direction of the throne.

Is it trying to get me to ascend the throne? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he walked towards the throne with Demonic Neonate in one hand and the trident in the other.

The Cube’s livestream continued as the Earth and the dimension paid attention to Zhou Wen’s every move.

When Zhou Wen arrived in front of the throne and leaped up, the huge temple suddenly trembled violently.

Zhou Wen also wanted to sit on the throne to appear more imposing, but unfortunately, the throne was just too huge. He would only look ridiculous if he really sat on it.

As the temple trembled, the Cube’s screen slowly zoomed out. The temple became smaller and smaller on the screen before the scene returned to the golden fruit tree that had been sliced apart. Then, it continued pulling away, allowing people to oversee the entire island.

The entire island was trembling violently as though there was an earthquake. The surrounding lake water surged, forming waves that constantly smashed into the island.

As for the island itself, it started floating. Huge cracks appeared over the island, as though it would crumble at any moment.

Boom!

Just as people were worried, the island began to crumble. Rubble kept peeling off from the rising island and plunged into the lake.

The island rose higher and higher as the crumbling intensified, but the speed at which it crumbled wasn’t as fast as it rose. The island stood like a mountain peak above the lake as many collapsed spots revealed the black object Zhou Wen had dug out.

When the rocks outside had completely peeled off, people finally saw the true appearance of the island. Or rather, it wasn’t an island at all, but a black mountain.

The entire lake was filled with rocks that fell from the mountain. The lake stirred as the mountain rose higher and higher, becoming more and more majestic. It tore through the clouds and looked down at the endless sea of clouds.

At the peak of the mountain, a huge palace slowly appeared.

“The Gods’ divine mountain that went missing…” Trajectory Seeking was stunned by this series of changes. She only stared at the black divine mountain in a daze.

The mountain tore through layers of clouds and rose to an unknown height. It stood high above the clouds. The huge and mysterious palace emitted a strange gentle glow, like a soul palace that was independent of the world.

When the divine mountain stopped trembling, the Cube’s screen zoomed back at the divine mountain from a closer angle.

At that moment, people saw huge figures appear above the divine mountain as though they had drilled out of the ground.

Soon, people could clearly see that the huge figures were three-eyed giants.

Although the new three-eyed giants weren’t as tall as the golden three-eyed giant from before, they were still more than a hundred meters tall.

However, their vertical eyes were mostly green and blue. Only a very small number of them were silver in color.

Golden vertical eyes like the golden three-eyed giant’s were nowhere to be seen on them.

More and more huge figures appeared, soon covering the divine mountain with countless numbers. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The towering divine mountain couldn’t accommodate the large number of gigantic figures. Most green-eyed Gods appeared at the foot of the mountain.

After an unknown period of time, huge figures covered the top and bottom of the divine mountain.

The square in front of the temple was filled with white-eyed Gods.

Just as everyone was reeling in shock, countless three-eyed giants suddenly genuflected in the direction of the temple. They placed a hand on their chests and lowered their heads as they shouted in unison, “Your arrival is welcomed, unparalleled new king.”

The shouts shook the world. The entire dimension could hear the awe-inspiring sounds.

The expressions of the experts from the various races in the dimension changed. As for most of the humans, they were pleasantly surprised and even euphoric.

A human was actually treated as a king in the dimension. How glorious was that?

Before Zhou Wen, everyone believed that the races in the dimension were lifeforms that transcended humanity. It was impossible for humans to be mentioned in the same breath as them. They should be grateful for any favor they received.

However, what Zhou Wen had done today completely overturned the average person’s understanding.

They suddenly realized that not only could humans be recipients of resources donated by the races of the dimension, but they could also become supreme existences that were worshiped by countless powerful dimensional creatures.

When had a human ever received such treatment? The spectating humans were stunned.

It wasn’t just the humans who were stunned. Even the various dimensional bigwigs were stunned.

That was the invincible race of Gods, a race that had once almost reached the apex of the dimension. Yet, they actually acknowledged a human as their new sovereign. This was something they didn’t dare imagine.

“Long live our sovereign… Long live the Gods…” The thousands of Gods on the divine mountain shouted in unison, their voices reverberating across the dimension.

With shouts that shook the world, the Cube’s screen changed again and switched to the Cube’s ranking.

Without any suspense, first place changed to two simple words—”Zhou Wen.”

These two extremely simple words and the simple name shocked the human world and the dimension in that instant.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in a good mood.

He was indeed very happy when the myriad Gods worshiped him.

However, after the worship ended, the Gods that covered the mountain vanished like they had been dusted. In the blink of an eye, only Zhou Wen and Demonic Neonate remained on the entire divine mountain with the golden trident in hand.

What a scam! Only then did Zhou Wen react and let out a wail.

The Gods that filled the mountain just now weren’t real Gods at all. They were just illusions condensed from unyielding wills.

When the new king of the Gods appeared, the unyielding will finally earned liberation and completely dissipated.

They were liberated in satisfaction, but now that the entire world knew that Zhou Wen had become the new king of the Gods, wouldn’t he have to face the wrath of the entire dimension? Sadly, he was a commander without an army.

A human had become the king of the Gods, and the Gods had once been one of the strongest races in the dimension. How could the old fellows in the dimension tolerate this?

Now, Zhou Wen only wanted to know if he could leave the divine mountain and return to Earth.

However, the outcome chilled Zhou Wen’s heart. The Cube’s challenge had already ended, but he wasn’t teleported back to Earth. Instead, he remained in the temple.
