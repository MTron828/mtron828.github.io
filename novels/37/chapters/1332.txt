Chapter 1333: The Unstoppable Bullets

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen rushed towards the Golden Palace with the spinning bullet around him. The Calamity-grade bullets shot over again, but he dodged them. Before the seventh shot from the second round of bullets was fired, Zhou Wen had already rushed to the steps of the Golden Palace.

However, he did not ascend the steps. Instead, he stopped in front of them.

Zhou Wen had to thank Hui Haifeng for being here. Since he was working for him, it wasn’t appropriate for him to go up himself, nor could he put his name on the rankings.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t know if the Cube would directly determine their names when they entered the rankings, or if they could write their own names.

It would be better if they could write it themselves. If the Cube determined who he was, Zhou Wen would have to be careful. He couldn’t casually use his other identities to appear on the rankings in the future.

Everyone saw Zhou Wen dodge one bullet after another and finally arrive in front of the Golden Palace. They were excited that Zhou Wen was finally about to reach the destination, but to their surprise, he stopped in front of the steps.

“What’s he doing? He could have gone up before the second round’s seventh shot. Now he’s stopped, won’t he have to take the sure-kill bullet from the second round?” While everyone was puzzled, a gunshot rang out again.

In the blink of an eye, another halo formed by a rapid spinning bullet appeared around Zhou Wen.

“F*ck… That actually works…” Xia Liuchuan jumped up.

No one had ever seen anyone do something like that before. There was no need for him to take the sure-kill bullet, but he chose to stop.

“You’re too showy… We’re both children of our parents, but why are you so showy…”

“What is he trying to do? Who is he showing off to?”

“Is Zhou Wen related to that dimensional creature? Why didn’t he kill him?”

…

Zhou Wen stood in front of the steps as his body danced with the Heavenly Robe. The halo around him shimmered, making him look like an immortal descending to the mortal world.

He dodged one bullet after another. The third sure-kill bullet formed a halo around him again, but it still failed to hurt him. Everyone began to turn numb towards such a turn of events.

Wei Yang and company were only at the Mythical stage after all, so they weren’t as fast as the Terror grade. They only reached Zhou Wen when the sixth bullet halo formed around him.

Wei Yang and company couldn’t help but be taken aback when they saw Zhou Wen dancing in front of the steps like an immortal with bullet halos around him.

“Go up,” Zhou Wen said to Wei Yang.

Only then did the spectators know that Zhou Wen wasn’t going up himself because he was waiting for Wei Yang and company to do the honors.

“F*ck, what’s the meaning of this? He doesn’t want to go up, but he wants to wait for the others to do it… Is he providing a fighting-substitute service?”

“This isn’t being a fighter-substitute. It should be guaranteed placement, right?”

“Guaranteed placement into the rankings? You can even give that away?”

“That’s way too showy!”

Everyone was rendered speechless as they looked at Zhou Wen, who was surrounded by the halo like a true immortal. Their expressions turned abnormally odd.

This scene was a little different from before. The creatures that had attempted the rankings had tragic outcomes. Each died more miserable than the last. The Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians managed to get on the rankings after a thrilling attempt.

However, when it came to Zhou Wen, it was like escorting a primary school student across the road. The scene became extremely discordant.

Wei Yang nodded at Zhou Wen before taking off the Federation flag on his back.

The other members of the ‘Suicide Squad’ followed Wei Yang’s example. They held their flags and followed Wei Yang up the steps.

After Wei Yang and the others reached the top, they raised their flags and waved them—a grand display of ten flags flying high.

“Pfft!” Hui Haifeng spat out the mouthful of water he had just drunk when he saw this scene.

Previously, he had only been joking when he told Zhou Wen to take a flag up. He never expected Zhou Wen to really do it. However, this scene that should have made one’s blood pump with zeal and ardor felt a little funny.

After Wei Yang and company reached the top, the Calamity-grade creature immediately stopped firing. According to the program, a metal bead flew out of the door and landed in Wei Yang and company’s hands. The Cube’s screen switched back to the rankings.

On the ranking board, another name appeared: Federation Suicide Squad.

People didn’t pay attention to what the name was. They were all looking at the end of the words ‘Federation Suicide Squad.’ They wanted to know how many stars they would obtain from this attempt.

“Three stars!” Everyone found three shining stars tailing the name. They immediately crushed the rankings of the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians, and were ranked third.

“Awesome!” Hui Haifeng felt rejuvenated. He originally felt that a single star was sufficient, but now that they had surpassed the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians, he felt very relieved.

Everyone knew the influence of the League of Guardians on the Federation. The presidential palace had little influence, so perhaps a ranking like this was a good start.

Soon, the presidential palace arranged a press conference. Many reporters raised sharp questions on the spot.

For example, was hiring Zhou Wen to get onto the rankings considered a humiliation to the federal government? After all, everyone knew that Zhou Wen was Luoyang’s number three figure. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, after this battle, many people felt that Zhou Wen wasn’t just ranked third in Luoyang.

Hui Haifeng wasn’t angry at all. He looked at them and answered the question, “This question is very silly. Could it be that Zhou Wen isn’t human? Isn’t he a member of the Federation? As a member of the Federation, is it wrong to make contributions to the Federation?”

“Mr. President, is Zhou Wen a pure human?”

“Mr. President, why were those bullets revolving around Zhou Wen?”

“What kind of mystical ability does Zhou Wen have…”

…

While Hui Haifeng was holding a press conference, Zhou Wen was very vexed. The six bullets kept revolving around him. Even after leaving the Venusian dimensional zone, the bullets didn’t stop attacking him.

In the past, as long as he exited the game, the bullets would naturally disappear. In reality, it was obviously different. These bullets would not disappear into thin air.

Zhou Wen’s plan to have breakfast was ruined. He could only think of a way to deal with the six bullets around him. Otherwise, he would have to keep wearing the Heavenly Robe and the Luck equipment.

He definitely had to return the Invincible Lucky Star—he couldn’t keep wearing it.

He tried all kinds of methods—even to the point of walking by the side of a mountain and letting the bullets hit the mountain, but it was useless.

The Calamity-grade bullets seemed to be able to penetrate everything. Nothing could stop them. They would not stop until they killed their target.

The only solution was apparently to find a scapegoat and use their life to take the bullet.

Zhou Wen’s heart suddenly stirred.?Wait… This might not be a bad thing… These Calamity-grade bullets will constantly revolve around me. Viewing this from another angle, they are equivalent to a weapon of mine… Six Calamity-grade bullets…

As Zhou Wen thought about it, his face almost bloomed with joy.
