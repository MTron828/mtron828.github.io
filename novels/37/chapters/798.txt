Chapter 799: Gu Lady in Battle

Translator: CKtalon

“Strange, why is there only one Ice Silkworm? Where did the other Ice Silkworm go?” Worm Dugu frowned.

“Could it be that the Xiao family lured the two Ice Silkworms apart?” Li Xuan asked.

Worm Dugu shook his head and said, “These two Ice Silkworms are a pair. They have something akin to telepathy abilities. It’s not that easy to separate them. If I could separate them, I would have long ago. The Xiao family wouldn’t even stand a chance.”

“Perhaps you don’t have the ability to do so. Just because you can’t lure them apart doesn’t mean they can’t either,” Li Yue said deliberately.

Surprisingly, Worm Dugu wasn’t angry this time. He thought for a moment and said, “That’s very possible.”

Li Xuan looked at Worm Dugu in surprise. Every time he mentioned Gu, Worm Dugu would proudly act as though he was number one in the world. It was unbelievable that he would admit that he was inferior to the Xiao family.

“You don’t have to look at me like that. Have you forgotten what I told you? If the Xiao family’s Mythical-level Kuman Thong is really refined from the baby reincarnated from a Gu God, it’s not surprising that they can lure the Ice Silkworm away,” said Worm Dugu.

Zhou Wen knew that what Worm Dugu said was right. It was likely that Gu Lady had lured the Ice Silkworm away.

Xiao Tianfang held the Kuman Nee that was placed in the temple hall, but Gu Lady was nowhere to be seen. She must have lured the other Ice Silkworm away.

This Ice Silkworm was trapped here by the Xiao family and was fighting a blood-colored scorpion.

The Blood Scorpion was clearly no match for the Ice Silkworm. Its body was almost frozen by the ice mist that the Ice Silkworm spewed out. It survived thanks to the Xiao family’s people using all sorts of Gu and Companion Beasts to barely hold back the Ice Silkworm.

As a result, the Xiao family sacrificed a large number of Gu and Companion Beasts. Furthermore, the Xiao family was still using Kuman Thong to augment the Blood Scorpion. This only allowed them to stall the Ice Silkworm.

The Ice Silkworm’s ice aura was extremely powerful. Zhou Wen had seen some ice-elemental Companion Beasts before, but this was the first time he had seen one as powerful as the Ice Silkworm.

As long as one touched its ice aura, be it Gu or Kuman Thong, their bodies would gradually freeze.

The ice aura seemed to have a spreading attribute. As long as one touched it, one’s body would become colder. Many Gu only touched a tiny bit of the ice aura. In the beginning, it wasn’t too big a problem, but after a while, they would freeze into ice and eventually shatter.

“Should we take action? Now that the two Ice Silkworms have been separated, it’s a great opportunity,” Li Xuan asked Worm Dugu.

“There’s no rush. Let’s wait and see. They aren’t a match for the Ice Silkworm.” Worm Dugu paused before saying, “After all, our Dugu family is the king of the South District. We can’t behave excessively. Otherwise, I’ll be nagged by those fellows at home. It will be a headache.”

When the Xiao family saw that Worm Dugu and company only stayed in the distance and had no intention of going forward, they couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

“Tianfang, do you think Worm Dugu will snatch our Ice Silkworm?” Xiao Liuqi whispered to Xiao Tianfang.

Xiao Tianfang said with a heavy expression, “The Dugu family controls the South District. On the surface, they do things fairly, so they might not openly snatch it. However, we still have to be on guard. I hope that Gu Lady can quickly capture the other Ice Silkworm.”

“How’s the situation on Gu Lady’s side?” Xiao Liuqi asked.

“It’s very vague. I only know that they are fighting,” Xiao Tianfang said.

“Tianfang, your perception of Gu Lady is getting weaker and weaker. Will there be a problem?” Xiao Liuqi asked worriedly.

“As long as her main body is in my hands, she won’t be able to resist me. If I let her die, she can only die,” Xiao Tianfang said coldly.

Xiao Liuqi sighed and said, “Gu Lady is really too special. We’ve been rearing her for so many years, but we can’t even see her spirit body. She even implicated you and caused you to suffer a backlash from the Kuman Nee. If we could really make her our own, our Xiao family wouldn’t be limited to a tiny area like Chiang Rai.”

“As long as we can capture this pair of Ice Silkworms and tame them, our Xiao family will also be able to soar,” Xiao Tianfang said.

Xiao Liuqi nodded and said, “Thankfully, there are detailed records of the Ice Silkworm Gu King in the Gu nurturing technique I obtained from the couple. Otherwise, even with the help of Gu Lady, it would be difficult for us to separate the two Ice Silkworms...”

Xiao Tianfang’s expression turned cold. “Didn’t I tell you not to mention that matter again?”

Xiao Liuqi hurriedly said, “Sorry, I misspoke.”

Zhou Wen was very far away from Xiao Tianfang, but Truth Listener’s ability allowed him to hear their conversation clearly.

I should find Gu Lady and the other Ice Silkworm first. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to conduct a large-scale search and soon found an Ice Silkworm in a distant swamp, but he didn’t find the Gu Lady.

“Keep an eye on that Ice Silkworm for now. I’ll find the other Ice Silkworm,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan before secretly retreating.

Soon, the Xiao family realized that one person was missing from Worm Dugu’s group. However, Worm Dugu was still around. There was only a youth missing, so they weren’t too worried.

After all, even Worm Dugu hadn’t been able to capture the Ice Silkworm. Even if he was a member of the Dugu family, it was impossible for him to capture the Ice Silkworm alone. Furthermore, they had set up mechanisms that would inform Xiao Tianfang and the others if someone approached.

After Zhou Wen left, he put on the Invisibility Cloak and quickly approached the other Ice Silkworm.

In the area closest to the Ice Silkworm, he discovered some Gu that had been placed in the swamp. Zhou Wen flew over the Gu without alerting them.

When he arrived at the Ice Silkworm, he saw an ice-blue Ice Silkworm. This Ice Silkworm was slightly bigger than the previous one.

Strangely, Zhou Wen didn’t discover any traces of Gu Lady with Truth Listener, but when he looked with his eyes, he realized that she was confronting the Ice Silkworm.

This is really strange. Truth Listener’s ability can’t discover Gu Lady. Even Xiao Tianfang, the owner of Lady Gu, can’t see her. Why can I see her? Zhou Wen was somewhat perplexed.

If he had used the Supreme Hell King Life Soul, it wouldn’t be strange for him to see a Spirit Body. However, Zhou Wen wasn’t using it. He didn’t even use any special powers to see Gu Lady whom others couldn’t see. This left him very puzzled. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was a little different from what Zhou Wen had imagined. Xiao Tianfang said that Gu Lady was fighting the Ice Silkworm, but the scene he saw was completely different.

Gu Lady was squatting on the ground and using her fingers to tease the Ice Silkworm. The terrifying Ice Silkworm was like a pet dog, circling around her as the Gu Lady played with it. However, it had no intention of attacking her.

Zhou Wen watched as the Ice Silkworm rolled on the ground in amusement. He thought to himself, It’s quite terrifying for such a terrifying Ice Silkworm to be played by Gu Lady. Thankfully, the Xiao family doesn’t really control Gu Lady. Otherwise, with her abilities, the Xiao family’s strength would have long exceeded their present limits.

Upon seeing Zhou Wen approach, Gu Lady stood up and looked at him. His invisibility was clearly useless against her.
