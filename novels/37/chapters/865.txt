Chapter 866: Ancient Mirror

Translator: CKtalon

“Where did you find him?” Zhou Wen sized up Liu Yun. He was somewhat puzzled as to why Liu Yun was so concerned about this matter.

“It’s quite a coincidence. I originally came here to wait for you. I guessed that after you obtained the Earth Elemental Beast, you would most likely come to the Founding Emperor Tomb. To my surprise, I didn’t see you despite waiting for ages. Instead, I recognized Xie Yukun who was selling things at the market. Therefore, I secretly followed and monitored him, but he discovered me.”

Liu Yun paused for a moment before continuing, “But who am I? He was naturally not my match. In order to save his life, this old fellow told me some things. Only then did I know that he had indeed gone to Zhuolu back then and had been in charge of supervising the expedition team with a few others. However, later on, the others vanished with the expedition team. And he said that he escaped calamity because he was sick and returned to the encampment that day. I naturally don’t believe him.”

“And then?” Zhou Wen increasingly found the matter odd.

He felt that the old man was most likely Jing Daoxian, but Liu Yun said that he was Xie Yukun and was related to the Zhuolu expedition team. This was somewhat odd.

“Then, he rattled on about some nonsense, saying that there’s something good in the Founding Emperor Tomb. Furthermore, he has a way to enter. I felt that he knew a lot about the Founding Emperor Tomb. Furthermore, I’m very curious as to why he’s in such a rush to enter the Founding Emperor Tomb. Therefore, I agreed to cooperate with him and temporarily keep him at bay while waiting for you to come,” Liu Yun said.

Zhou Wen sized up Liu Yun for a while before asking, “Why are you interested in the expedition team?”

“Ahem, of course it’s because I’m concerned about you, Junior Brother. I know you’re very concerned about this matter, so I helped you investigate it.” Liu Yun changed the topic and said, “If you don’t believe me, we’ll capture that Xie Yukun later and torture him personally. Then you’ll know if I lied to you.”

“Me? Beat him? I’m afraid that the two of us will be the ones getting crippled later,” Zhou Wen said with a twitch of his lips.

“Don’t worry. Although that old man has some ability, he’s far from our match. I can deal with him alone,” Liu Yun said smugly.

Zhou Wen saw that Liu Yun didn’t seem to be faking it, so he said to him, “I don’t know why you’re interested in this matter, but I don’t know if that old man is Xie Yukun. I just feel that he’s someone else.”

“Who?” Liu Yun hurriedly asked when he saw Zhou Wen’s solemn expression.

“Jing Daoxian,” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun’s expression changed when he heard that. He said in disbelief, “That’s impossible! How can he be Jing Daoxian?”

“In any case, I won’t be going to the Founding Emperor Tomb. Watch your back,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to leave. However, when he walked past Liu Yun and looked ahead, his expression changed.

At some point in time, the old man had arrived and was now standing in front of them. He smiled at the two of them as cold sweat immediately broke out on Zhou Wen’s back.

Liu Yun wanted to stop Zhou Wen, but when he turned his head and saw the old man, his expression changed.

“Old Man Xie, when did you come?” Liu Yun also knew that something was amiss. Xie Yukun had appeared so close to them, but he hadn’t sensed anything.

The old man ignored him and smiled at Zhou Wen. “I never expected you to recognize me. It’s somewhat unexpected.”

“It’s difficult not to recognize a figure like you,” Zhou Wen said to Jing Daoxian. The old man had clearly admitted that he was Jing Daoxian.

Jing Daoxian declined to comment. “Since you are interested in the Founding Emperor Tomb, why don’t you enter with us? You should know that even if I were to kill everyone in this world, I won’t be willing to let you die. There’s no need for you to be wary of me.”

“Are... Are you really Jing Daoxian?” Liu Yun widened his eyes as he looked at Jing Daoxian in disbelief.

The number one devil in the Federation. He had actually beaten the number one devil in the Federation previously and lived to talk about it. Even Liu Yun felt his legs go limp.

“From the looks of it, you were also waiting for me?” Zhou Wen stared at Jing Daoxian.

“I originally planned on taking the Earth Elemental Beast after the Zhang family auctioned it off. However, since you took the Earth Elemental Beast, I naturally wouldn’t take it from you. I could only wait for you here,” Jing Daoxian said.

“I’m sorry, but I’m not interested in the Founding Emperor Tomb. I’m leaving. Since you and my Eldest Senior Brother are so interested in it, it’s best you go together,” Zhou Wen said. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Liu Yun’s face turned livid as he forced a smile. “I’m not interested either. I was just fooling around. Old Master, don’t take it to heart.”

Jing Daoxian’s expression remained unchanged as he sighed. “It doesn’t matter if the two of you aren’t going, but now, one of you has the Earth Elemental Beast and the other has the Emperor Qin Sword. These two items are necessary to enter the Founding Emperor Tomb. Therefore, no matter what, I will need the two of you to accompany me.”

“What if I say no?” Zhou Wen was already prepared to fight or escape.

Jing Daoxian said with a smile, “You don’t have to be so nervous. I’ve said it before. Even if everyone in the world dies, I’ll ensure your survival. Therefore, you don’t have to treat me as an enemy. However, you have to accompany me on this trip to the Founding Emperor Tomb. I’m just too old and my body is too weak. I need external help to continue living.”

“That’s your problem. What has it got to do with me?” Zhou Wen retreated as he spoke. Although Jing Daoxian treated him as an experimental subject and the chances of him killing him weren’t high, who knew what kind of scheme Jing Daoxian would come up with? It was best to stay away from him if possible.

Zhou Wen had seen Lord Alcohol and Xia Jiuhuang’s outcome with his own eyes. The two of them were also Jing Daoxian’s test subjects. There was no doubt about that.

“Since Zhou Wen isn’t going, It’s useless even if I go. I’ll leave this sword for you. I’ll be leaving now. If you have anything to say, have a good chat with my junior brother.” Liu Yun placed the ancient sword on the ground as he retreated.

Jing Daoxian didn’t stop them. He slowly took out something. It was an ancient bronze mirror. The mirror’s surface was blurry, and its reflections were also blurry.

When Zhou Wen saw the ancient mirror, he felt that something was amiss. He summoned the Earth Elemental Beast and attempted to escape.

Liu Yun’s speed wasn’t slow either. Like a meteor, he quickly rushed into the forest.

Jing Daoxian had no intention of stopping them. He held the ancient mirror and slowly turned it. Then, a strange scene happened. Zhou Wen, who had already escaped through the ground, and Liu Yun, who had rushed into the forest, returned as though things were being played back.

“Follow me!” Jing Daoxian carried the ancient mirror as he walked. Zhou Wen and Liu Yun couldn’t control their bodies as they were pulled towards the Founding Emperor Tomb like puppets.
