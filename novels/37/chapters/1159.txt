Chapter 1160: Female Sword Immortal’s Sword Art

The female sword immortal’s name was Qin Zhen. Qin Mu’s relationship with Qin Zhen was very good, and he especially admired this sister. When he was at home, Qin Zhen was always the one who mentored him.

Of course, Qin Zhen’s teaching was only one aspect. Qin Mu himself was a bona fide genius, but he was a little too proud. Furthermore, his personality was more defiant and rebellious. He had caused a lot of trouble in school, giving his tutor a headache.

“Are you sure you want to fight me?” Zhou Wen asked Qin Mu.

“You don’t dare?” Qin Mu returned with a question.

“I do, but I just find it unfair.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “You can date her if you win, but I won’t get any benefits if I win. Do you think that’s fair?”

“Then if you win, I’ll arrange for my sister to date you. That’s fair, right?” Qin Mu said with a grin.

Zhou Wen was glad that he hadn’t drunk any water. Otherwise, he might have spat it out. With a younger brother of this caliber, the female sword immortal was really unlucky.

“How is that? Do you dare to agree?” Qin Mu continued to ask.

Qin Mu was certain that Zhou Wen would agree to it. A graduate student being provoked by a sophomore and in front of his girlfriend was something no one could tolerate.

“Here?” Zhou Wen looked around and asked. There were already quite a number of students who had come to watch the commotion. However, they knew Qin Mu’s character very well and were no longer surprised.

“Yes, right here. Everyone can be our witnesses. Of course, if you’re afraid of losing and embarrassing yourself, we can also get a private room,” Qin Mu said with a grin.

“Doing it here will do.” Zhou Wen also wanted to see what standards the top students of Sunset College had after five years. He wanted to know how they compared with his class.

“Alright, I’ll use a sword. Senior, what will you use?” Qin Mu took a practice sword from the weapon rack and asked Zhou Wen.

“Since you use a sword, I’ll use a sword too,” Zhou Wen said.

“Don’t regret posturing.” Qin Mu curled his lips and threw a practice sword at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen caught the sword before walking to the center of the training grounds.

“You’re a senior, shouldn’t you give me a three-strike handicap?” Qin Mu asked with a grin.

“Sure.” Zhou Wen nodded with a smile.

“Senior, I won’t stand on ceremony then,” Qin Mu thought to himself. I know all the powerful ones among the graduate students. I haven’t seen this one before, so he’s definitely not at the Epic stage. He wants to beat me at the Legendary stage? To think he dares give me a three-strike handicap. He’s simply blinded by greed. That’s good too. If I finish you in three strikes, I can definitely make that female senior view me in a different light.

No. Three strikes isn’t cool enough. I’ll finish him in one strike. Qin Mu thought for a moment and still felt that dealing a single deathblow was more handsome and could leave an impression in the eyes of the beautiful female senior.

“Senior, I’m about to strike. You have to be careful.” Qin Mu was very confident in his sword art. Unless one’s level was higher than his, there weren’t many people at the same level who could dodge his full-powered strike.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded with a smile. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Qin Mu didn’t immediately strike. Instead, he took a few steps forward and found Zhou Wen standing still. He stood there with his sword in hand and allowed him to approach with no intent of retreat. He couldn’t help but sneer inwardly. You know I’m Qin Zhen’s younger brother, yet you still dare let me come so close. You can only blame it on yourself if you can’t even block one strike.

When he reached the attack range that he was most proficient in, Qin Mu suddenly struck out with his sword. That strike was like a fleeting glimpse. Coupled with his movement technique, it was unbelievably fast, but it was also extremely elegant. It was like an immortal riding a sword for an assault on the enemy. In a flash, he could take the head of the general amidst thousands of soldiers.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw Qin Mu’s sword art.

Although Qin Mu’s sword art was fast, it was only fast enough among Legendaries. In Zhou Wen’s eyes, this strike was extremely slow. It was impossible for it to touch him.

Zhou Wen was surprised that the sword art was very similar to his Transcendent Flying Immortal. It wasn’t the present Transcendent Flying Immortal, but the Transcendent Flying Immortal from his college days. Although this strike had some changes, the core remained the same.

Strange, why would he use my Transcendent Flying Immortal?

Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

This was unlike Sei Gasakai, who had only observed Zhou Wen’s sword moves and sword intent before figuring out a concept similar to Transcendent Flying Immortal.

Although the two were very similar, there were still some differences in the core and details.

However, Qin Mu’s sword art was different. His sword art had details that were unique to Zhou Wen.

Strange, I’ve never taught anyone my sword art, much less someone with the surname Qin. Why does this Qin Mu know my sword art? Zhou Wen was filled with puzzlement.

Qin Mu originally wanted to defeat Zhou Wen with one strike and had used 90% of his strength. His speed was also astonishing.

However, to his surprise, the practice sword in Zhou Wen’s hand blocked Qin Mu’s sword, preventing him from succeeding.

Qin Mu was slightly surprised. He didn’t expect this unremarkable graduate student to be able to block the sword art his sister had taught him.

I’ll see how many strikes you can block. When Qin Mu saw that Zhou Wen didn’t react, he thought that he had already used all his strength to block his attack and didn’t have the ability to counterattack. Therefore, he launched a storm-like attack.

Strike after strike, Qin Mu’s sword art was elegant and ruthless. It was indeed a good sword art that was hard to come by.

After watching a few strikes, Zhou Wen finally understood. This sword art was indeed Transcendent Flying Immortal from back when he was at school. However, it had been modified by someone and had indeed reached a very high level. It was much stronger than Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal from back then. However, the core hadn’t changed. It was considered a variant of Transcendent Flying Immortal.

However, Zhou Wen still couldn’t recall when he had taught the sword art to a person with the surname Qin.

After more than ten strikes, Zhou Wen had already seen through Qin Mu’s sword art. There was no need for him to continue. Therefore, he struck out and sent Qin Mu’s practice sword flying.

“It looks like I’ve won.” Zhou Wen placed his practice sword back on the rack and asked Qin Mu, “Who taught you your sword art?”

“My sister.” Qin Mu thought of Qin Zhen and what he had said to Zhou Wen. He immediately felt that something was amiss.

If Zhou Wen really requested to go on a date with Qin Zhen, Qin Mu wouldn’t tell her it was down to a battle. The reason he had said that was because he hadn’t expected to lose.

However, on second thought, the other party’s girlfriend was here. He wouldn’t suggest going on a date with his sister, right?

“Where did your sister learn her sword art from?” Zhou Wen wanted to know where she had learned Transcendent Flying Immortal.

“Why are you asking this?” Qin Mu sized up Zhou Wen warily. He imagined that Zhou Wen was eyeing Qin Zhen’s sword art.

“Didn’t you say that you wanted to arrange a date between me and your sister? Can we do it today?” Zhou Wen wanted to meet the female sword immortal, Qin Zhen, and ask her where she had learned Transcendent Flying Immortal.
