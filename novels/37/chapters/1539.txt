Chapter 1540: Chaos’s First Order

Translator: CKtalon

It’s done!?Zhou Wen looked at the Chaos Egg around him. Although it still looked the same as before, it was completely different. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The previous Chaos Egg was a Chaos Egg, and the present Chaos Egg was Zhou Wen’s Calamity Zone.

However, to Zhou Wen’s dismay, this Calamity Zone was a little too small. Just like the Chaos Egg in the past, it could only accommodate him.

Taking out his phone, he took a look at his stats and realized that the First Order of Chaos had indeed reached the Calamity grade.

Calamity Zone: Chaos’s First Order

Zhou Wen recognized these words, but he didn’t understand what the ability of the First Order of Chaos Calamity Zone, which had the same name as the Essence Energy Art, was.

I’ll give it a try.?Zhou Wen activated the Big Dipper instance dungeon and entered Dubhe’s palace.

Chaos’s First Order was quite interesting. It was equivalent to the Chaos Egg, so using it was equivalent to the summoning of the Chaos Egg.

It looked no different from when it was at the Terror grade. It was still the same Chaos Egg that enveloped his body. He couldn’t tell that the Chaos Egg was made of words.

Ignoring everything else, its defense should be much stronger, right??Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Tiger Soul General and got them to slam open Dubhe Palace’s door.

After the Golden Wyrm Scissors charged at the amethyst-armored creature, a terrifying purple light blast appeared.

When the Chaos Egg was struck by the light blast, many solid Essence Energy Crystals immediately appeared. Just like before, they quickly piled up inside the Chaos Egg.

This is no different from before!?Zhou Wen was depressed. He only hoped that the Chaos Egg was more resilient than before and wouldn’t explode so quickly.

Soon, Zhou Wen was certain that the Chaos Egg was indeed much tougher than before after being strengthened by the Calamity Zone. The solid crystals inside nearly filled the Chaos Egg, but it didn’t explode.

Although the Chaos Egg didn’t explode, Zhou Wen’s body couldn’t take it. His body was almost flattened from the solid crystals’ squeezing.

Zhou Wen hadn’t thought of this problem previously, but now, he suddenly realized that the toughness of the Chaos Egg was useless. His body couldn’t withstand such pressure. If the solid Essence Energy Crystals continued to increase, he would definitely be squeezed to death.

I’m afraid I’m the first person in this world to be squeezed to death by Essence Energy Crystals, right? People clamor amidst tears, hoping to obtain some high-level Essence Energy Crystals, but I’m squeezed to death because of having too many. This is ridiculous… If only this could be like the real world, allowing me to exchange the Essence Energy Crystals for vouchers. A single voucher is equivalent to thousands of Essence Energy Crystals… Unfortunately, Essence Energy Crystals aren’t money, nor are they vouchers. They can’t be stacked.?Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he suddenly saw the Chaos Egg light up. A word lit up inside the Chaos Egg.

It was the word “one.” When the word lit up, Zhou Wen realized that a word had appeared in all the crystals.

This is something! If there’s one, there will be two and three. Could it be…?With a thought, Zhou Wen immediately saw a few words light up inside the Chaos Egg.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand… The words that represented numbers lit up.

Every time a number lit up, the Essence Energy Crystals in the Chaos Egg would change.

When the number in the Essence Energy Crystals turned to two, the Essence Energy Crystals in the Chaos Egg suddenly decreased by half, leaving plenty of space.

When it became three, there were fewer Essence Energy Crystals. The bigger the number in the Essence Energy Crystals, the fewer crystals there were.

Holy sh*t, I can really stack numbers like money!?Zhou Wen was immediately excited. He picked up a crystal that had the word ‘thousand’ on it and immediately felt that the Essence Energy contained in the crystal was as terrifying as the energy in a nuclear reactor. Clearly, the Essence Energy contained in this crystal was very likely equivalent to a thousand crystals.

Under such circumstances, surely I don’t have to worry about the Chaos Egg exploding? After all, it can be stacked constantly. Even if there are 100 million Essence Energy Crystals, they can be stacked into one.

?Zhou Wen felt that everything was worth it.

However, he soon realized that his idea was nice, perhaps too good to be true. The number in the Chaos Egg only reached ten thousand, but there weren’t any words like billion.

The Essence Energy Crystals ultimately stacked to ten thousand.

Zhou Wen attempted to activate the other words, but it was useless. Apart from the words that represented numbers, the other words couldn’t be activated.

However, even so, it was already of great boon to Zhou Wen. Just the amount of space saved from stacking ten thousand Essence Energy Crystals together was enough to help him greatly. It prevented him from being squeezed to death by them.

As such, Zhou Wen realized that he could easily withstand the damage of the light blast with the help of the Chaos Egg.

Zhou Wen sized up the situation outside while inside the Chaos Egg. All he could see was a dazzling purple light—nothing else. All he could sense was that the Golden Wyrm Scissors was fighting the amethyst-armored creature inside.

Occasionally, he could see golden beams flash in the purple light. It was likely the radiance of the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

As for the Tiger Soul General by the side, his aura became stronger and stronger. He had already roughly reached the Calamity grade and was constantly becoming stronger.

I should be able to know the limits of the Tiger Soul General this time, right??Zhou Wen thought.

After a while, Zhou Wen realized that he could see a purple flame plume where the Tiger Soul General was. The purple color was somewhat different from the purple color of the light blast.

As the flames became stronger, he could already tell that it was the outline of the Tiger Soul General.

Such power should already be stronger than the power of the light blast, right? That’s why the flames can be seen. Is the Tiger Soul General really that strong? It’s only at the Terror grade, but it can withstand the power of a Calamity-grade creature? Furthermore, it’s not an ordinary Calamity-grade creature.?With a thought, Zhou Wen ordered the Tiger Soul General to help attack the amethyst armor.

The Tiger Soul General charged forward without any hesitation, but due to the intense battle energy fluctuations inside, he couldn’t hear the exact situation even with Truth Listener’s power.

Bang!

After a loud bang, Zhou Wen sensed Tiger Soul General’s body fly out and slam into the ground. It tore the ground into the distance and slammed into something before stopping.

However, in the next second, the Tiger Soul General got up and charged in again.

Again and again, every time the Tiger Soul General was thrown out, he would quickly rush back in. As for Zhou Wen, he could clearly sense that the Tiger Soul General’s aura was getting stronger.

The Tiger Soul General is quite an oddity. He’s clearly only at the Terror grade and doesn’t even have a Calamity Zone, but he can rely on the combination of various skills to resist a powerful Calamity creature…?Zhou Wen felt that he needed to pay attention to the problem of skills.. If there was a chance, he should learn more useful skills.
