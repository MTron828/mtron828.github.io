Chapter 781: Gu Pool

Translator: CKtalon

The calabash vine was very strange. Its roots and leaves were the color of limestone—the color of rocks. It didn’t look like a living creature, and more like something carved from stone.

Above the calabash vine that was twenty to thirty meters long, there was a total of one calabash. It was also grayish-green in color.

“Is that a plant-type dimensional creature?” Zhou Wen asked.

Li Mobai shook his head and said, “I’m not sure yet. It looks like a plant, but it might be able to spew out a Gu King from inside the calabash. I can’t be sure if it’s a plant or an animal.”

Li Mobai explained his understanding of the calabash vine in detail so that everyone could be prepared.

Back when Li Mobai accidentally entered this cave when chasing a Gu King, the Gu King had been sucked into the calabash just as he was about to catch up to it.

Li Mobai felt that something was amiss with the calabash vine, so he didn’t rush over. Instead, he used a Companion Beast to make probes. However, just as the Companion Beast rushed over, the Gu King that had entered the calabash crawled out again.

The Gu King was the king of bloodsucking Gu. It was at the Epic stage. If Li Mobai wanted to advance to the Evil King Gu Life Soul, he needed to hunt such a Gu King.

Back then, Li Mobai had the Evil King Gu Life Soul. It could be said that other than Mythical Gu, he was invulnerable to all Gu. It wasn’t difficult to deal with a Bloodsucking Gu King.

However, to his surprise, after the Bloodsucking Gu King came out of the calabash, it became extremely ferocious. Its strength underwent a drastic change, as though it had advanced to the Mythical stage, and killed Li Mobai’s Companion Beast easily. If Li Mobai hadn’t fled quickly when he saw that the situation wasn’t looking good, he would have died.

Later, Li Mobai came a few more times, but he returned empty-handed. He was no match for the Bloodsucking Gu King.

Li Mobai suspected that the calabash vine was odd. He wanted to remove it and think of a way to lure the Bloodsucking Gu King away before getting a fire-elemental Companion Beast to burn the calabash vine.

However, to his surprise, before the fire-elemental Companion Beast could approach the calabash vine, a Gu King crawled out of the calabash again and killed Li Mobai’s fire-elemental Companion Beast.

Later, Li Mobai tried many methods, but they were all useless. Even when his Evil King Gu Life Soul reached the Perfect Body, he still failed to deal with the calabash vine.

After John used the six-winged seraphim to fight Zhou Wen, Li Mobai carried out a lot of investigations and learned about Guardians. Only then did he realize that the truly precious thing wasn’t the calabash vine, but the gray cocoon it protected.

Unfortunately, he didn’t have the ability to deal with the calabash vine. Even though he knew that there was a Guardian there, he couldn’t contract it. All he could do was cooperate with Zhou Wen.

After hearing Li Mobai’s explanation, Gu Shanshui was alarmed. “You mean that there’s a Mythical Gu in that calabash, and it’s not just one?”

“That’s what I think.” Li Mobai looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Do you want me to use my Companion Beast to lure out the Gu King inside?”

“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded and summoned Doctor Darkness to fuse with him in his soul form.

Be it ancient wars or modern battles, intelligence was one of the most important factors. Therefore, when Li Mobai summoned his Companion Beast and charged at the calabash vine, Zhou Wen used Doctor Darkness’s Eyes of Penetration to look at the limestone calabash.

Thankfully, the calabash wasn’t a real stone. Through his Eyes of Penetration, he saw through it and was immediately alarmed.

Inside the calabash, there were more than ten different-looking Gu. Their appearances were strange and they looked creepy.

What was even stranger was that the Gu in the gourd were actually fighting each other.

When the Companion Beast Li Mobai summoned approached the calabash, a force controlled one of the Gu and spat it out.

The Gu looked like a scorpion, but it had dragonfly-like wings on its back. It had fine teeth in its mouth, making it look terrifying.

The Companion Beast Li Mobai released was an Epic black tiger, but when it flew close to the Gu, the Gu’s tail stabbed into its body and it died instantly.

After killing the target, the Gu was sucked back into the calabash.

“I’ve seen three different Gu Kings from all my experiments. This is one of them,” Li Mobai said.

“Strange.” Gu Shanshui frowned and said, “That Gu looks like a Snake Scorpion Gu, but it has many characteristics that the Snake Scorpion Gu doesn’t have. Furthermore, its strength is much stronger than a Snake Scorpion Gu. It has indeed reached the Mythical stage.”

“This is also what I’m puzzled about. If the Gu only entered the calabash at a later time, there must be some benefits inside that can improve their strength greatly. After the Bloodsucking Gu King entered, its strength increased greatly and its body underwent a huge change,” Li Mobai said.

“I suspect that the calabash is likely a natural Gu Pool,” Gu Shanshui said with a solemn expression. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

A so-called Gu Pool was to place many Gu inside and let them fight each other. Finally, the last surviving one would be the strongest Gu. And not only was that Gu the strongest, but it would also absorb the abilities and strengths of other Gu in battle. Its strength far exceeded ordinary Gu.

Although it was only a guess, Zhou Wen could see it clearly. The Gu inside were indeed fighting each other. Furthermore, it looked like several of them had Mythical strength.

Although the other Gu hadn’t reached the Mythical stage, they were considered extremely powerful existences at the Epic stage.

This is practically a super Gu Pool. If the Gu inside fight to the end and produce a Gu King, I wonder how powerful it will be. It will probably be comparable to a top Mythical creature, right? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be tempted. If he could obtain this calabash, it would be excellent for raising Gu.

The only pity was that Zhou Wen didn’t know how to raise Gu. Even if a powerful Gu King really appeared, Zhou Wen could only kill it to see if a Companion Egg dropped.

“Zhou Wen, what do you think?” Li Mobai asked Zhou Wen.

“I think Master Gu is right. That calabash is likely a natural Gu Pool. There might be more than one Mythical Gu inside, but where did these Gu come from?” Zhou Wen said.

“There are Gu everywhere in the Valley of No Return. There are many at the Mythical stage. I reckon the Gu from the Valley of No Return crawled here and were sucked in by the calabash,” said Gu Shanshui.

“What’s your plan?” Zhou Wen asked Li Mobai.

“There’s no particular solution. We can only lure out the Gu Kings inside and kill them one by one. We’ll have to rely on your strength,” Li Mobai said.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it would be a waste to lure out all the Gu Kings inside and kill them.
