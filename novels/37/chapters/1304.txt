Chapter 1305: Forced Contract

Zhou Wen landed on the edge of the stone artifact and glanced at the four apes. They didn’t move at all, as though they didn’t mind in the least about Zhou Wen’s actions.

“Do you really want me to contract the Guardian?” Zhou Wen looked at the stone cocoon in the stone artifact as his expression changed.

Contracting a Guardian wasn’t difficult. As long as one reached the Guardian’s requirement for physique, one only needed a drop of blood to complete the contract.

Even if he couldn’t meet the Guardian’s requirements, as long as the Guardian was willing, he could still contract it.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in contracting a Guardian. He even felt averse to it. After all, Guardians were tools used by the dimension to colonize Earth.

It was a little similar to cyborgs that humans had once imagined. Contracting such a creature might result in betrayal at any time. It wasn’t a pleasant feeling.

It was mainly because Zhou Wen had too many secrets. If the Guardian learned of such a secret and informed the dimension, who knew what the dimension would do to him.

If there was another way, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have contracted a Guardian. Even if he wanted to, it had to be a master-slave contract like Demonic Neonate and Grim Demon.

However, now that Zhou Wen thought about it, there didn’t seem to be any other way. This dimensional zone was very strange. It didn’t seem like he could leave without making a contract. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that if he could leave, he could just contract it. After all, the Guardian contract was an equal contract. He could escape first and think of a way to terminate the contract later.

This was the good thing about an equal contract. It wasn’t particularly difficult to remove it. He could still come up with something.

Staying alive comes first.?With this in mind, Zhou Wen skillfully condensed a finger beam and stabbed a needle-like wound on the finger of his other hand. He squeezed out a drop of blood and prepared to drip it onto the stone cocoon.

Before he dripped his blood, Zhou Wen specially glanced at the four apes below. Seeing that they had no intention of stopping him, he steeled his heart and dripped the blood onto the stone cocoon.

Sigh, I was forced. I didn’t really want to contract a Guardian. Ancestors, please don’t blame me. If you want to blame someone, blame the genes you handed me for being too outstanding, Zhou Wen thought plaintively.

Blood had already dripped onto the stone cocoon. It was too late for regrets.

However, in the next second, Zhou Wen awkwardly realized that when his blood landed on the cocoon, it was as though water droplets had landed on a pot of oil. It slid down without touching the cocoon at all.

Zhou Wen gaped in shock.

What’s going on? Didn’t you want me to contract it??When Zhou Wen gradually calmed down, he was even more puzzled.

If he wasn’t the one to make the contract, why did they get him to come up here? The four apes had clearly agreed for him to be there. To have such a performance meant that they thought highly of Zhou Wen.

However, his blood was completely unable to trigger a reaction from the Guardian cocoon. This meant that he hadn’t obtained the recognition of the Guardian cocoon. Or rather, his bloodline and stats couldn’t meet the Guardian’s requirements.

Could it be that the four apes were mistaken??Zhou Wen thought to himself, but when he looked at the four apes, he felt that something was amiss.

If Zhou Wen were one of those apes, he would probably have swallowed him to prevent himself from being embarrassed. However, the apes didn’t have such plans. They continued waiting for something.

What’s going on??Zhou Wen sized up the stone cocoon again. On careful look, he realized that the stone cocoon was indeed different.

Previously, Zhou Wen had discovered that there were faint gray patterns on the stone cocoon’s surface. They didn’t look eye-catching and he couldn’t see them without careful inspection. Zhou Wen had thought that the gray patterns were natural patterns of the stone cocoon.

Now, after taking a closer look, he realized that it didn’t seem to be the case. He realized that the gray patterns had been drawn by someone.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of paint it was. It was gray like burnt paper ash. It was very closely connected to the stone cocoon and the color was similar. That is why he had thought they were part of the stone cocoon.

However, on careful observation, he realized that there were many spots where the gray patterns were drawn with a brush. It was the same kind of brush used in the East District’s ancient times. The paintings also looked a little like ink paintings, but they were much lighter. It was as though they had been gone through the ravages of time and were about to become indiscernible.

Drawing on the Guardian cocoon??Zhou Wen felt that this wasn’t the doing of someone who had nothing better to do. The paintings on it likely had some use.

He circled the edge of the stone artifact and carefully studied the gray patterns on the Guardian cocoon. Although they were very faint, he could roughly see them.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t understand it. He realized that the gray patterns were a strange symbol. It was like a series of encryption numbers that filled the entire Guardian cocoon’s surface.

The symbols were unfamiliar. In any case, they weren’t words or symbols that Zhou Wen knew.

However, Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that the symbols were like chains that circled around the stone cocoon as though they were sealing it.

Zhou Wen guessed inwardly,?Could it be that these gray patterns are sealing the stone cocoon, preventing my blood from being absorbed by it?

The more he thought about it, the more convinced he was. Zhou Wen planned on giving it a try to see if he could wipe off the gray pattern before trying to contract it.

Zhou Wen was afraid that touching the stone cocoon would anger the apes, so he asked, “My dear ape brothers, is the plan to get me to wipe away the gray patterns before contracting the Guardian cocoon?”

However, they remained silent as though they hadn’t heard Zhou Wen.

These four fellows are too detestable. They clearly want me to do something, but they don’t say a word or express anything. Zhou Wen wished he could kill them all. It was best if four Companion Eggs dropped.

In the future, he would buy a car without wheels and get the four of them to carry him every day.

Despite his thoughts, Zhou Wen felt that he could give it a try seeing that they didn’t react. Therefore, he carefully flew into the stone artifact and slowly approached the stone cocoon.

As he flew, he paid attention to their reactions. Seeing that they had no intention of stopping him, Zhou Wen finally landed on the stone cocoon.

This stone cocoon was about four to five meters in diameter. It wasn’t small, and it was unknown what kind of Guardian was inside. Since there were four apes guarding it, it was likely that there was a stone monkey inside.

The legendary Handsome Monkey King was said to have jumped out of a stone. Could this Guardian be the Handsome Monkey King??Zhou Wen was somewhat expectant.

As a person from the East District, there didn’t seem to be anyone who didn’t like the Handsome Monkey King. Among the Four Dimitrios Monkeys, it was much more famous than the others.
