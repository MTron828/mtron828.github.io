Chapter 943: Ya

Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to try. Instead, he continued absorbing and refining the other Mythical skill crystals.

The Mythical Essence Energy Crystals were absorbed by Zhou Wen as though they were free.

‘Absorbed Great Might Vajra Bull Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill: Vajra Drill.’

‘Absorbed National Cornerstone Gold Man Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill, Body of Gold Essence.’

‘Absorbed Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill: Grand Turtle Breath.’

‘Absorbed Blue Sky Crystal Beast Crystal. Attained Mythical Essence Energy Skill: Sky Slash.’

Absorbing different Mythical Crystals required different Essence Energy Arts. Zhou Wen switched Essence Energy Arts several times and finally absorbed all the Mythical Crystals he could.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that the Great Might Vajra Bull’s skill wasn’t anything interesting because its strongest ability was the Soul Suppression Bell. However, the Soul Suppression Bell wasn’t a skill, so it was impossible for him to comprehend it.

He never expected the Great Might Vajra Bull to have the move, Vajra Drill. It was rather impressive, and it intrigued Zhou Wen.

This move was something the Great Might Vajra Bull used when going all out. It broke its horn and shot it out like a drill. Its might was rather domineering.

Zhou Wen didn’t have a bull horn, but he didn’t need one when using the skill. All he needed to do was find a weapon that could be launched. He could use a spear or sword as long as he could throw them.

After the weapon was thrown, it would quickly spin and form a powerful drilling force. It was even better than Penetrating Pierce.

The key problem was that there was something wrong with this move. After throwing the weapon, it would automatically explode after hitting the target, maximizing its might. After using it once, it would destroy a weapon. An ordinary weapon wouldn’t be able to withstand such a powerful force. It might self-destruct before hitting the target.

Therefore, the weapon used for Vajra Drill couldn’t be too bad. Otherwise, it was very easy to miss.

Body of Gold Essence was a type of Essence Energy that strengthened the body. It was somewhat similar to Golden Bell and Iron Skin. However, it was of a higher level. It strengthened the body even more. It was a divine skill to suffer beatings.

Grand Turtle Breath was a high-level version of Turtle Breath. When he used it, there was no sign of life on his entire body. He was like a dead person.

However, he couldn’t move when using ordinary Turtle Breath, but for Grand Turtle Breath, he could still move freely. It was a necessary skill for feigning death. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Of course, he could also use it to deal with creatures with poor vision who relied on determining the enemy’s life auras to attack. He could also use it for hiding, making it difficult for him to be discovered.

Sky Slash left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed. This was because Zhou Wen wanted a teleportation skill, but this was a spatial attack.

It was indeed very powerful. An Essence Energy skill that could slice through space was even more destructive than Zhou Wen’s Demonic Astral Wheel. However, Zhou Wen already had the even more destructive Immortal Slaying. He could use Sky Slash normally, but when he needed to go all out, he had to rely on the might of Immortal Slaying.

With so many Mythical skills, Zhou Wen’s combat strength increased significantly, especially with Vajra Drill. It was like an Essence Energy version of a missile. Its destructive power was rather shocking, provided that Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of sacrificing his weapon.

If he used it in-game, he wouldn’t have any qualms about using it. When the Mythical Light Concealment Sword was thrown out with Vajra Drill, its offensive strength was upgraded by a whole level. Furthermore, the final explosion was even more shocking.

Zhou Wen planned on using it in-game to kill bosses. In real life, to use such a move made the person a super tycoon. Zhou Wen wasn’t that rich.

The Body of Gold Essence was also very useful. Furthermore, it didn’t clash with the Demon Dragon True Body. Zhou Wen first used the Demon Dragon True Body before using the Body of Gold Essence. He looked like a humanoid golden dragon with a terrifying body. He could even clash head on with Tyrant Behemoth two or three times without being killed.

Of course, the Essence Energy expenditure was rather huge. Sometimes, he needed to switch back to Slaughterer to replenish it.

Sky Slash wasn’t as useless as Zhou Wen imagined. After Zhou Wen tried it, he realized that the expenditure of Sky Slash wasn’t high. It could be used continuously. It wasn’t like Immortal Slaying in which he would lose his combat strength after one strike. It was a form of compensation for its weaker strength.

Finally, Zhou Wen tried String Aural Quake again. The Golden Harp only struck once before the harp snapped. Thankfully, it was in-game, so there wasn’t any problem.

String Aural Quake was an area-of-effect attack skill. If a group of monsters needed to be cleared, this move was almost invincible.

I hope some useful skills drop in-game. Zhou Wen really wanted to stay at home and grind dungeons, but the Glimmer Life Soul needed him to walk out to advance. It left him helpless.

Zhou Wen looked at maps online and planned on which direction he should take. He wanted to advance Glimmer to a Perfect Body as soon as possible. This was a critical step in advancing to the Mythical stage.

“Why are you going out again?” Ouyang Lan asked when Zhou Wen told her that he was leaving Luoyang.

“It’s beneficial to go out and broaden my horizons. Now that the dimensional zones in the Federation are becoming more and more unstable, I wonder if I’ll have the chance to leave again in the future,” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s true. Send Ya’er over. I’ll help you take care of her,” Ouyang Lan said.

“I plan on taking her out for a walk with me this time,” Zhou Wen said.

“She’s still so young. What if you encounter danger?” Ouyang Lan said worriedly. It was obvious that she really liked Ya’er.

“I’ll take routes I’m confident in. Besides, you should be able to tell that Ya’er isn’t an ordinary child,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright, be careful. Stay away from taking risks...” Ouyang Lan exhorted again.

After informing the others, Zhou Wen was about to leave Luoyang when he suddenly heard a piece of news. Someone had challenged the first ranked Great Skyfiend.

Zhou Wen hurriedly switched on his phone and couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw the challenger.

The challenger also looked like a human, but he was wearing clothes that resembled a cloak. Beneath the cloak was an airtight armor, making it impossible to see what the creature inside looked like.

However, his clothes and armor weren’t Guardian armor. Furthermore, there was a white “Ya” embroidered on the back of the cloak.

And the name on the cube only had one word: Ya.

What surprised the Federation citizens was that Ya held an ancient sword in his hand. Ya wasn’t famous, but the ancient sword was very famous.

In the previous ranking battle, Primordial Sword Immortal, who had been invincible against everyone overseas, was now in Ya’s hands.

Zhou Wen was also alarmed, but what shocked him wasn’t the Primordial Sword Immortal in Ya’s hand, but that Ya looked like someone to Zhou Wen.

Don’t tell me it’s Zhong Ziya! Zhou Wen prayed inwardly.

If it was really Zhong Ziya, he might have already taken Wang Mingyuan’s path. This was because Ya’s condition was clearly different from the Guardians.
