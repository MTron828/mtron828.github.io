Chapter 1591: Blessing Halo

Translator: CKtalon

Li Xuan’’s face flushed red, but there was still no reaction from the Connate Insight.

“Old Zhou, don’t tell me you randomly picked up a stone by the side of the road to bullsh*t me?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen with a look of suspicion.

“Thave better things to do.” Zhou Wen took back the Connate Insight and curled his lips. “It’s definitely because your training isn’t up to par. Otherwise, why can’t you use it when the Connate Holy Temple’s Saint can?”

“Tch, that’s because it’s beneath me. How good can something from the Connate Holy Temple be? I want to create a path that belongs to me. I’ll kill all those Connate Saints later and let them know who’s the orthodox one. I like to forge my own path and force others to have no other paths to take.” Li Xuan

wore a look of contempt.

“Alright, I’ll pay a visit to those dimensional zones.” Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to waste his breath on him. He walked out and the baby bear followed behind him.

After Zhou Wen left, Li Xuan cursed under his breath hatefully, “What the hell is that crap? How dare you discriminate against me? When I destroy the Connate Holy Temple in the future, I won’t allow anyone to cultivate the Invincible Connate Divine Art again. I’ll make sure you are never used by others.

Til tum you into a useless piece of trash.”

It wasn’t that Li Xuan didn’t want it, but he really didn’t have the ability to use it. After all, his Invincible Connate Divine Art wasn’t pure. Few people who practiced the orthodox version in the Connate Holy Temple could use the Connate Insight, much less a pirated version.

Zhou Wen looked at the baby bear beside him and had a nagging feeling that something was amiss, but he couldn’t recall it.

Strange, why do I feel like I’ve forgotten something? Zhou Wen frowned in thought, but after some thought, he couldn’t figure out what was amiss.

Ya’er was with the An family while Chick was still evolving to the Calamity grade. The antelope had been following Ya’er and didn’t come along, This was also the reason Zhou Wen felt at ease letting Ya‘er stay with the An family.

With the antelope by Ya’er’s side, it could escape with Ya’er even if they encountered an invincible opponent.

Zhou Wen thought carefully and thought that he was missing something, He opened the chaos space and did a headcount.

Zhou Wen immediately realized what he had forgotten. He had left Liz and Leem in the chaos space.1

How did I forget them? Seeing that there was no one around, Zhou Wen decided to release them.

“Master.” After Liz and Leena came out, they immediately prostrated before Zhou Wen. They showed no resentment despite being confined for so long.

“Get up. From now on, you are not allowed to call me master.” It was fine in Regretless City, but if anyone in the Federation saw Liz and Leem call him master, there would be plenty of opportunity for misunderstandings.

“Your Devilish Excellency...” Liz and Leem wanted to address him by his title, but they were stopped by Zhou Wen.

“You aren’t allowed to call me Your Devilish Excellency either. In the future, just call me Zhou Wen. This is an order.” Zhou Wen knew that it was impossible to reason with them, so he went straight to the point. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Yes... Mas... Zhou... Wen...” Although the two sisters didn’t know why the Devil King wanted them to call him that, they were willing to obey unconditionally. They didn’t know what the words “Zhou Wen” meant.

‘When they called Zhou Wen, they were actually thinking about Your Devilish Excellency. They made a name into an honorific. Therefore, when they addressed Zhou Wen by name, their intonation sounded odd.

After the two sisters stood up, they realized that there were all sorts of plants everywhere. There were also various insects and beasts shuttling through the forest. Birds flew in the sky, and the baby bear, who was still following Zhou Wen, was momentarily stunned.

Having lived in Regretless City, they had never seen such a scene. They thought that this was heaven.

“Is this... Is this heaven?” Liz and Leem muttered to themselves in confusion.

Of course not. Humanity is now in deep waters and can die at any moment. If this were heaven, I reckon no one would be willing to go to heaven after death, Zhou Wen thought.

“Sorry... Sorry...” Only then did Liz and Leem recall that their master was the Devil King, How could they mention heaven in front of him? They hurriedly apologized.

“This place is the same as Regretless City. There are also many humans here, but the humans here are different from the humans in Regretless City. Many of the humans here are very evil and can kill you at any time. Therefore, if you encounter other humans in the future, don’t randomly talk to them,

much less tell anyone about how you come from Regretless City. In the future, you have to obey my orders...” Zhou Wen told them some things to facilitate their adaptation to life on Earth.

Liz and Leem listened attentively to Zhou Wen’s teachings and memorized every word.

“Liz, release your Blessing Halo.” After Zhou Wen told them everything he could think of, he thought of her abilities and wanted to see what effects her Blessing Halo had.

Liz’s Life Providence and Life Soul were blessing powers, while Leem’s were curse powers. Both were very useful.

“Yes, Zhou Wen.” Liz immediately used her Life Soul.

Acircular halo appeared beneath Liz’s feet like slowly blooming lotus flowers. Standing near her, he could clearly sense a strange force infusing into his body. The closer he got to her, the clearer his senses became.

Although this power didn’t enhance his physique, it made Zhou Wen feel comfortable.

“What’s the use of your Blessing Halo?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Ican find more when searching for Stone Root Grass,” Liz answered shyly.

How pathetic! In that place, no matter how good one’s talent and ability is, it’s all a waste. Zhou Wen led Liz and Leem to a nearby dimensional zone. Firstly, he could search for the dimensional zone, and secondly, he could give it a try and see how much help the Blessing Halo could provide him.

Zhou Wen didn’t have much hope. After all, Liz’s level was too low. She was only at the Epic stage.

Zhou Wen didn’t have high expectations for her Blessing Halo. It was fine as long as it had some practical use. If he had a chance of advancing to the Calamity grade in the future, a large-scale Blessing Zone would be amazing.

Of course, it also depended on whether Liz and Leem would have any other ideas after coming to Earth. Zhou Wen didn’t plan on nurturing them now.

After following the direction indicated by the map, Zhou Wen suddenly saw a white Companion Egg the size of an ostrich egg on the grass in front of him. Its outer shell was like porcelain.

No way? Is the Blessing Halo that useful? I can pick up Companion Eggs just by walking! Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan his surroundings, but he didn’t discover any ambushes or other creatures.

Am I really that lucky? Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the Companion Beast. It was really a Companion Egg..
