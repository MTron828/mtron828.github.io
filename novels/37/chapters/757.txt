Chapter 758: Immortal Slaying

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen was wrapped in gauze like a mummy as he lay in bed. A winged pixie danced around Zhou Wen as it tried its best to spew out green light to nourish his injured body.

According to the information Wang Lu had obtained, although the changes in Forbidden City were intense, it was limited to the city’s interior. No dimensional creatures broke out.

What was different from before was that strange sounds could be heard coming from inside even though it wasn’t a stormy day. This used to happen inside Forbidden City during thunderstorms.

Unfortunately, no one could enter Forbidden City, so no one knew what was happening inside.

Due to Old Master Xia’s disappearance, the Xia family was in a mess. Nothing had happened to Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue. They had even appeared near Forbidden City in the past two days.

Zhou Wen had roughly guessed the outcome. Apart from Xia Jiuhang, few people in the Xia family wanted them dead. After all, they were the Xia family’s hope.

The death of more than ten thousand Epic experts was a huge blow to any of the six hero families. It would definitely affect the Xia family greatly.

However, it wasn’t as serious as Zhou Wen imagined. The ten thousand Epic experts were mostly nurtured by Xia Jiuhuang himself to be sacrificed for his advancement to the Mythical stage. Therefore, these people were from the East Courtyard and didn’t affect the Xia family’s normal system.

From this, it could be seen that Xia Jiuhuang still had some feelings for the Xia family. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have separated these people from the Xia family and set up a separate East Courtyard.

There was also Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue. Their talent, Life Providences, and Life Souls were top-notch. Xia Jiuhuang could have used one of them as his ninth Life Soul, but he didn’t do so in the end. Perhaps there were some emotional factors involved.

No matter what, the destruction of Xia Jiuhuang and the East Courtyard had dealt quite a blow to the Xia family, greatly reducing their influence in the Federation.

The Xia family and the bureau were searching for Old Master Xia and Zhou Wen’s whereabouts, but no one saw Zhou Wen come out of Forbidden City. They imagined that Zhou Wen was trapped in the mutated Forbidden City like Old Master Xia, so they didn’t search the Imperial Capital.

Zhou Wen had been recuperating in Grandma Wang’s yard for the past two days. It was odd. In such a huge yard, other than Grandma Wang, there were only a few old ladies and a butler. He didn’t see any younger members of the Wang family.

Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu and learned that this was where Grandma Wang recuperated. The other members of the Wang family didn’t live here, and the Wang family’s real residence wasn’t nearby.

Zhou Wen held his phone with his stiff wrapped hand and saw a purple flower sprout grow on the Dead Man Tree. It was likely the flower that had absorbed Xia Jiuhuang.

Zhou Wen was somewhat looking forward to seeing what fruit the flower would bear.

Xia Jiuhuang had advanced to the Mythical stage with nine supreme-grade Life Providences and Life Souls. Furthermore, he had the power of the log condensed in his body, so the fruit produced from him definitely wouldn’t be too bad.

It’s a shame about my Six-Winged. Zhou Wen sighed softly. Six-Winged had been with him for so long, so he wasn’t used to suddenly losing it.

Lying in bed with nothing to do, Zhou Wen used his phone to grind dungeons. He originally imagined that he could happily farm the nine black dragons, but to his surprise, they hadn’t respawned.

The other Mythical creatures respawn every day. Don’t tell me these nine black dragons respawn after nine days? Zhou Wen guessed. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Since he couldn’t farm the black dragons, Zhou Wen placed his sights on the Guardian again. During his battle with Xia Jiuhuang, Zhou Wen had gained some insight into the concept of power from the Sigh of the King. He had also found a way to use Slaughterer Life Soul. The might of that move was immense, so it might pose a threat to the Guardian.

Zhou Wen called that move Immortal Slaying. It was basically a single-use attack. If he couldn’t kill the enemy with one move, Zhou Wen would be crippled.

The main reason was that Immortal Slaying was based on the Sigh of the King and the Slaughterer Life Soul.

It wasn’t that the Slaughterer Life Soul couldn’t be powered, but the amount of power needed to drive it was too great. Without the massive power of the Sigh of the King as a foundation, it was impossible to power the Slaughterer Life Soul.

Unfortunately, using the Sigh of the King would place a huge burden on Zhou Wen’s body. Furthermore, Immortal Slaying would drain him of all his strength instantaneously, so Zhou Wen basically didn’t have any combat strength after a single strike.

The might of this strike was something that even Xia Jiuhuang, who was wearing Guardian armor, couldn’t withstand. He had even killed the black jade guardian with one strike. Such strength might be of some use against the Guardian in Ant City and the war wagon.

It was too dangerous to use Immortal Slaying in real life. Perhaps he would die before injuring the enemy.

However, in-game, he didn’t have so many qualms. He just had to do it.

Zhou Wen’s two arms were held in place by a splint. He could only lie on the bed as he raised his arms straight like a zombie. He held his phone and began gaming.

Before the nine black dragons respawned, the war wagon remained at the bottom of the sea. Zhou Wen went straight to the underground sea, hoping to see if Immortal Slaying could kill the Guardian inside.

Before Zhou Wen arrived at the underground sea, he heard a sound from the window.

The windows here weren’t glass windows, but windows that were made of ancient wood paper. They were opened by rolling them up and propped up with a wooden stick.

Zhou Wen turned his head to look at the window and saw two ponytails sticking out. Then, he saw a little girl’s head slowly extend out. She was sprawled on the window sill, staring at Zhou Wen with her big, limpid eyes as she looked curiously at him.

Zhou Wen saw that the girl was only about eleven or twelve years old. She was very cute and looked a little like Wang Lu.

“Hey little one, what’s your name?” Zhou Wen asked her.

“Wang Chan,” the little girl answered.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to ask another question, his hand suddenly slipped and the phone smashed down on his face. Zhou Wen’s eyes bruised as his nose ached.

Zhou Wen wanted to pick up the phone, but he couldn’t bend his arm.

“Let me help you.” Wang Chan pushed open the door and ran in. She reached out to pick up the phone on Zhou Wen’s face and handed it to him.

“Thank you, Little Chan...”

Zhou Wen reached out to take the phone when he suddenly heard someone shouting outside the yard. “Miss Little Chan, where are you? Come out quickly!”

Little Chan jumped in fright as she looked back at the door and handed the phone to Zhou Wen.

However, Zhou Wen’s arm was too stiff. Before he could grab the phone, it fell with a thud and smashed into Zhou Wen’s face. He grimaced in pain.
