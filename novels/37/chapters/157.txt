Chapter 158 Raising a Weighted Feather .

With the Godfiend’s Life Providence, Zhou Wen could choose not to use any Primordial Energy Skills, nor did he need to borrow the wings of his Companion Beast to directly float in the air. Furthermore, he could fly freely, as though he had invisible stairs in the air.

Every Life Providence had its unique effects, and they all seemed very powerful, but Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that these powers didn’t belong to him.

He was at home studying the effects of the Primordial Energy Arts and Life Providences when he suddenly heard the doorbell ring.

At first, he thought it was Li Xuan, but when he opened the door, he realized that it was Feng Qiuyan.

“Why are you here?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

“Coach, I would like you to tailor a second cultivation plan for me,” Feng Qiuyan said firmly.

“Didn’t I say before that you have to finish the plan I tailor-made for you before you can proceed to the next stage of cultivation...” Zhou Wen really didn’t wish to lie to Feng Qiuyan, so he could only find an excuse to reject him.

However, before he could finish speaking, Feng Qiuyan said, “Coach, I’ve already mastered the realm of the slow saber.”

“What? You’ve mastered it?” Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he looked at Feng Qiuyan in disbelief.

He had only said it in passing. Although he had included some of his insights, most of them were just random thoughts he pulled out of his ass. The fact that Feng Qiuyan had actually managed to master the realm of the slow saber realm with his nonsense, left Zhou Wen in disbelief.

“I’ve really mastered it. I’ll demonstrate it to you now.” Feng Qiuyan slashed at Zhou Wen with his saber.

In the past, Feng Qiuyan’s slashing of his saber was very quick, so fast that no one could see it clearly. It was like a bolt of lightning. It was extremely fast and agile.

His saber remained very fast, but it was so fast that it gave one a heavy feeling. It was as if there was immense weight on his saber, as if a mountain was pressing on it.

This saber move allowed others to see it clearly. It looked very slow, but in fact, its speed was even faster than before.

“You move as if you are raising a weighted feather!” Zhou Wen directly spoke of the feeling that Feng Qiuyan’s saber had given him.

Feng Qiuyan nodded and said, “As expected of Coach. You knew about this realm all along. If it wasn’t for your guidance, I don’t know how long it would have taken me to figure it out.”

Zhou Wen wasn’t able to describe his current feelings as he thought to himself, Feng Qiuyan, you are truly a genius. You actually managed to master something with that little said? What else can I say?

“Coach, please continue to tailor a cultivation plan for me,” Feng Qiuyan said solemnly to Zhou Wen. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Without waiting for Zhou Wen to say a word, Feng Qiuyan transferred the money to Zhou Wen. It was actually more than twenty thousand, three times more than the first lesson.

“Coach, I know that you aren’t doing it for this pittance, but this is just a form of my appreciation,” Feng Qiuyan said.

I’m doing it precisely for this pittance, alright? Zhou Wen was really in need of money, but he found the money to be a hot potato.

“I’ve been a little busy recently. I probably don’t have much time to tailor a plan for you...”Zhou Wen wanted to find an excuse to send Feng Qiuyan away.

However, Feng Qiuyan immediately said, “It’s alright. Coach, if you have time, give me some pointers. If you don’t have time, I can wait.”

Zhou Wen looked at Feng Qiuyan with a complicated expression, momentarily at a loss for words. After a long hesitation, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and said, “Feng Qiuyan, listen to me. In fact, from the beginning, I only wanted to earn a little bit of your money from teaching you. What I said to you previously was all nonsense. For you to master the realm of the slow saber is because you are talented and perceptive. It has nothing to do with me. I’m sorry; I’ll refund you the money you paid previously. I hope that you won’t take it to heart...”

Zhou Wen really didn’t wish to lie to Feng Qiuyan. He told him the truth and would rather return the money to him than continue the lie.

However, Feng Qiuyan didn’t believe him at all. He stopped Zhou Wen from refunding him the money and said, “Coach, it’s fine if you don’t have time. I can wait. If you think my talent is too poor and don’t wish to teach me, it doesn’t matter. I’ll stay by your side. You don’t have to deliberately teach me. Just let me figure things out on my own.”

Zhou Wen wasn’t an eloquent person. He was at a loss for an explanation as he stammered, “That’s not what I meant...”

“Coach, you don’t have to say anything else. I know people like you are very diligent in your cultivation. You will definitely squeeze every minute and second for cultivation, or else you wouldn’t have improved so quickly. I was selfish to make you waste your time tailoring a plan for me. But other than you, I can’t tolerate those mediocre people who only teach following a fixed curriculum. So please do not reject me. I know that your time is precious, so you don’t have to do anything. Just let me be by your side and self-study. Don’t worry, I won’t affect your day-to-day life. I won’t disturb you when it’s inconvenient.” Feng Qiuyan’s eyes were steeled with resolve.

This person... must be crazy... Zhou Wen looked at Feng Qiuyan with his mouth agape. He realized that he had no way of explaining himself.

“I’m telling you that I really have nothing to teach you. Are you sure you want to stay?” Zhou Wen said feebly.

“Coach, don’t worry. I will definitely not disturb your cultivation,” Feng Qiuyan said firmly.

“As long as you’re happy. Let me make things clear. I have nothing to teach you. If you insist on staying, the money you gave me won’t be refunded,” Zhou Wen said.

“I don’t usually use a lot of money. I haven’t used much of the allowance that my family gave me. There’s still about a million left. If you need it, you can take it all,” Feng Qiuyan said.

“There’s no need.” Zhou Wen shook his head helplessly as he went back inside and sat on the sofa to continue gaming.

Feng Qiuyan walked in and closed the door before following Zhou Wen, preparing to watch him play games.

“Do you want to watch me game too?” Zhou Wen put down his phone and asked Feng Qiuyan.

“I want to understand your entire cultivation process. Gaming is also part of your cultivation, right? What game are you playing? I want to download one too,” Feng Qiuyan said seriously. It was obvious that he wasn’t joking.

“This is a game I created myself. It hasn’t been completed yet, so it is a trade secret.” Zhou Wen felt like he was about to go mad.

Feng Qiuyan was obviously the one who had been deceived, but he, the deceiver, felt extremely depressed.

“I see.” Feng Qiuyan nodded and stopped watching him game. He walked to Zhou Wen and pulled a chair to sit down as he stared at him intently.

Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered with him. He believed that Feng Qiuyan would leave once he was bored, so he decided to ignore him. Since Feng Qiuyan couldn’t see what game he was playing, he continued gaming and grinding the game’s instance dungeons.
