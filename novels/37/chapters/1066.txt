Chapter 1067: Battling Jade Rabbit

Translator: CKtalon

It was unknown if Jade Rabbit could understand him, but it ignored Zhou Wen and continued struggling.

However, as its body was covered in glue-like liquid, its struggles were futile.

A pure Strength-type creature has such a weakness. Once they are restrained, there’s almost no chance of turning the tables. Tyrant Behemoth has the same weakness. Zhou Wen ordered the Seven Seas Dragon King to take the initiative to attack when he realized that Jade Rabbit was refusing to surrender.

The Seven Seas Dragon King’s tentacles swept towards Jade Rabbit, but unfortunately, Jade Rabbit was just too big after its Terror transformation. The Seven Seas Dragon King’s tentacles were unable to wrap around Jade Rabbit’s body. All it could do was bite at its flesh.

The Jade Rabbit’s flesh was terrifyingly tough. The tentacles with dragon heads nearly had their teeth chip when biting at it—they failed to bite through its flesh. All they did was tear off some rabbit fur.

What a powerful physique! Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed.

The Seven Seas Dragon King was at the Terror grade after all. Furthermore, its strength wasn’t considered weak among the Terror-grade creatures. Yet, it was actually unable to break through the Jade Rabbit’s defense. The strength of this fellow’s physique was unimaginable.

If it hadn’t been restrained by the Seven Seas Dragon King’s ability, it would have been a huge problem.

From the looks of it, I have no choice but to let Demonic Neonate take action. Zhou Wen summoned Demonic Neonate.

“Jade Rabbit, I won’t be holding back if you don’t hand over the Elixir of Immortality,” Zhou Wen shouted at Jade Rabbit again, but it continued struggling and ignored him.

“Neonate, let it see some blood,” Zhou Wen instructed Demonic Neonate with his mind.

Demonic Neonate received the order and immediately unsheathed her Demonic Sword that flew towards Jade Rabbit.

The Demonic Sword was just too small. In front of the gigantic Jade Rabbit, it couldn’t even be considered a needle.

However, the Demonic Sword’s offensive strength was clearly much stronger than the Seven Seas Dragon King’s. It tore through the Jade Rabbit’s flesh and stabbed right in.

A drop of blood flowed out along the sword hilt. Zhou Wen was about to shout at Jade Rabbit again, but when his gaze landed on its face, he was stunned.

Jade Rabbit’s originally red eyes had turned black. Then, its eyelids drooped down as crystalline tears shimmered inside.

“Wa!” Jade Rabbit suddenly cried as large drops of tears streamed down.

As it cried, its huge body slowly shrank and returned to its original size. It cried in the glue and soon, it was wet.

Zhou Wen was depressed. “Why are you crying like a child when you’re a Terror creature?”

“Jade Rabbit, hand over the Elixir of Immortality and I’ll immediately release you,” Zhou Wen said to Jade Rabbit.

It would have been better if he hadn’t said it. With him saying that, Jade Rabbit cried even more tragically. Its tears flowed down like a stream.

Zhou Wen was just about to say something when he suddenly realized that something was amiss. The tears had drenched the Jade Rabbit’s fur, and the sticky liquid that stuck to its body had automatically fallen off, preventing it from sticking to it.

When Jade Rabbit realized that the glue on its body had been removed, it was immediately surprised and delighted. It jumped up and rushed to the edge of the ring-shaped mountain. With another flash, it was gone. Its speed was terrifying.

Zhou Wen was immediately depressed. He didn’t expect Jade Rabbit’s tears to be able to remove the Seven Seas Dragon King’s sticky liquid. Jade Rabbit was gone before he could obtain the Elixir of Immortality.

With Jade Rabbit’s speed, even a Mythical Companion Beast that was proficient in speed wouldn’t be able to catch up. Since Demonic Neonate didn’t chase after it, it was obvious that any attempts would be pointless.

From the looks of it, the Moon is doomed. It’s not my fault. Zhou Wen saw that the jade pestle of the Jade Rabbit was still stuck there. It couldn’t take it away in time, so he walked over to put it away.

After the Seven Seas Dragon King dispelled the sticky liquid, Zhou Wen reached out to grab the jade pestle, hoping to pick it up, but after exerting some force, the jade pestle remained motionless.

It’s heavy! Zhou Wen held the jade pestle with both hands, hoping to pull it out.

However, the jade pestle remained motionless, surprising Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen got the Seven Seas Dragon King to extend its tentacles to sweep up the jade pestle, but even after using all its strength, the Seven Seas Dragon King failed to lift it.

It can’t be! The Seven Seas Dragon King is at the Terror grade, but it can’t even lift the jade pestle? How heavy is this jade pestle! Zhou Wen was alarmed as he had another idea. Perhaps it’s not just a matter of strength. The Seven Seas Dragon King can even move a building after all. Perhaps it’s possible that only the Jade Rabbit can lift this jade pestle. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Demonic Neonate suddenly turned her head in a direction. Zhou Wen turned his head and saw Jade Rabbit retracting its head and hiding behind the mountain.

Why is it back? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and knew what was going on.

Jade Rabbit was definitely unwilling to part with the jade pestle, so it had come back for it.

“Jade Rabbit, if you want the jade pestle back, exchange it with the Elixir of Immortality,” Zhou Wen shouted at the spot where Jade Rabbit was hiding.

Jade Rabbit seemed to know that Zhou Wen couldn’t catch up to it, so it became a lot bolder. Although it didn’t dare come over, it extended its head and paw from behind the mountain wall. Then, it raised its paw and made a universally-known gesture at Zhou Wen.

Holy sh*t, this rabbit actually knows that? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

Jade Rabbit knew that Zhou Wen couldn’t lift its jade pestle, so it wasn’t afraid of Zhou Wen’s threat. Zhou Wen really had no choice. The jade pestle was terrifyingly heavy. He couldn’t lift it at all.

What should I do? Zhou Wen glanced in the direction of Moon Palace and saw that the flames were becoming more and more blinding. Clearly, the logger was at a huge advantage. He didn’t know how long Chang’e and Ice Maiden could last.

Is the Moon really going to be destroyed? Zhou Wen wondered how he could obtain the Elixir of Immortality from Jade Rabbit.

Jade Rabbit’s speed is too fast. If Demonic Neonate doesn’t chase after it, it means that she knows that she can’t catch up to it. Furthermore, Jade Rabbit’s strength and physical toughness are extremely terrifying. It’s virtually impossible to catch it. However, if I don’t stand any chance, why would the Moon Goddess send me? Does she want to use Jade Rabbit to kill me? But there’s no need for that. She can even freeze Ice Maiden with her strength. If she wants to attack me, she could have done it in front of the Moon Goddess Temple.

But if I have a chance of obtaining the Elixir of Immortality, where’s the chance? Jade Rabbit isn’t someone I can match... Jade Rabbit... I seem to remember having something like that in the past... Zhou Wen suddenly thought of something as he sank his consciousness into the Chaos Bead and rummaged around.

After a while, Zhou Wen found something.

It was a translucent jade box with mysterious cloud patterns on it. This jade box was something Zhou Wen had obtained from White Cloud Mountain’s Jade Rabbit’s Lunar Prayer Stone.

Back when The Thearch had guided him to obtain the jade box, he had only discovered some low-level dimensional crystals inside. Zhou Wen was quite disappointed because they weren’t of much use.

He had felt that the jade box might be a little special, so he had stored it away in passing. Now, he suddenly recalled that the Jade Rabbit’s Lunar Prayer Stone was said to be a manifestation of the Jade Rabbit when it descended to the mortal world. The jade box was supposed to have been hidden by the Jade Rabbit. He didn’t really know if it had anything to do with the Jade Rabbit.
