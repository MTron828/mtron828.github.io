Chapter 791: Battling the Corpse Bug

1

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen and company heard the splattering sounds coming from the volcanic crater.

After Gu Shanshui and company heard the sound, they slowly retreated from the volcanic crater. As they retreated, they poured Corpse Oil on the ground, forming a thin line.

Soon, the trio retreated and hid behind the rocks with Zhou Wen and company.

A commotion at the volcanic crater soon happened as a bug crawled out.

“Isn’t this a horned beetle?” Zhou Wen sized up the bug from afar and saw that it looked like a horned beetle. It had a black carapace and a split horn on its head.

The worm crawled out bit by bit and crawled down towards the Corpse Oil, licking it clean.

Seeing the bug slowly climb down, Gu Shanshui’s expression turned solemn. Gu Lou and Gu He also looked very nervous.

Gu Shanshui looked at Zhou Wen who nodded slightly. In response, Gu Shanshui took out a metal container. It looked like a furnace and also like a tripod. It was an unknown item.

While the Corpse Bug was still licking the Corpse Oil, Gu Shanshui placed the metal container in a crack in the rocks. Then, he poured in dozens of bottles of Corpse Oil, almost filling the metal container.

The smell of the Corpse Oil immediately attracted the attention of the bug. It spread its translucent wings and flew towards the metal container.

It landed on the edge of the metal container and extended its head to suck the Corpse Oil inside.

The container was a little deep. After the bug finished half of it, it couldn’t reach the Corpse Oil below. All it could do was crawl into the container.

“Now.” Gu Shanshui immediately gestured for Zhou Wen to take action as he ran towards the metal container.

Zhou Wen got the chick to fly over and land on the edge of the container.

When the Corpse Bug saw the chick, it wasn’t as afraid as ordinary Gu. It immediately bared its fangs and brandished its claws to confront the chick. However, it could be seen that it was still somewhat afraid of the chick and didn’t immediately charge out from the inside.

While it was hesitating, Gu Shanshui had already rushed to the metal container. He held the lid in one hand and sprinkled some unknown powder into the container with the other. Then, he covered the container with a click.

Gu Shanshui pressed down on the metal container with one hand and wrapped a red rope around it with the other, trying to tie it up.

The metal container suddenly shook violently. Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to help him hold down the lid.

With Tyrant Behemoth’s help, the metal container immediately stopped shaking. However, there were continuous clangs coming from inside.

Gu Shanshui didn’t care much. He wrapped a red rope around the metal container several times.

According to Gu Shanshui’s plan, he had already trapped the Corpse Bug. All he needed to do was bring it back and slowly tame it.

However, to his surprise, there was a cracking sound coming from the metal container. Gu Shanshui’s expression changed drastically as he knew that something was amiss. He immediately stopped and threw the metal container out.

The metal container exploded in midair, and the red string snapped inch by inch. The Corpse Bug flew out and bared its fangs and brandished its claws. It opened its mouth and spat out a mouthful of thick fog that swept towards Gu Shanshui.

“Quickly retreat. That’s corpse fog,” Gu Shanshui shouted and quickly retreated. At the same time, he summoned dozens of strange Gu.

After the Gu came out, they tried their best to absorb the corpse fog, but they died after absorbing a little.

The chick let out a strange cry and spat out a mouthful of golden flames. When the golden flames met the corpse fog, the corpse fog immediately burned and was reduced to nothing.

The chick also charged at the Corpse Bug and pecked at it.

However, to everyone’s surprise, the Corpse Bug was even faster than the chick. With a flap of its wings, its horn slammed into the chick, sending it flying. The chick landed on the ground and rolled far away before stopping.

Ever since it was born, the chick had never suffered such a huge loss. It flew up as though it was enraged. It spat out large amounts of golden flames at the Corpse Bug, wanting to burn it to death.

The Corpse Bug seemed to be a little afraid of the golden flames. It didn’t dare touch them as it flapped its wings to dodge the golden flames and flew towards the retreating Gu Shanshui.

From the looks of it, the Corpse Bug’s intelligence wasn’t low. It knew the principle of bullying the weak and fearing the strong.

Gu Shanshui hurriedly summoned his Gu to face the Corpse Bug, but when his Gu touched the Corpse Bug’s corpse fog, they immediately fell to the ground and died twitching. His efforts were futile.

Zhou Wen watched from the side and realized that the corpse fog spewed out by the Corpse Bug wasn’t a poisonous fog, but a mass of bacteria or viruses.

Once the bacteria and virus entered the Gu’s bodies, even the Gu couldn’t take it and quickly died.

Those bacterial viruses should also be considered Gu, right? This Corpse Bug is basically a parent body of Gu. Just a mouthful of mist from it contains a massive number of Gu. Apart from the chick’s flames that can restrain it, it’s really difficult for others to deal with it. Zhou Wen saw the chick fly over and spew out golden flames that burned the corpse fog away.

Zhou Wen didn’t let Tyrant Behemoth charge forward. Although Tyrant Behemoth was very powerful, it was too huge. No one knew what would happen if it inhaled the bacteria in the corpse fog.

Corpse Bug was the first Gu that dared to fight the chick, but it was still very afraid of the chick’s golden flames. It didn’t dare to be touched by the golden flames. It used its speed to constantly change its position, wanting to rush over and bite the chick.

The chick wasn’t as fast as it was, but its flight trajectory was very strange. Zhou Wen watched for a while before his eyes widened. This fellow’s flight trajectory looked like his Transcendent Flying Immortal.

Damn it. A bird actually learned my Transcendent Flying Immortal movement technique? Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.

The chick used Transcendent Flying Immortal and was actually on par with the Corpse Bug. Its golden flames failed to hit the Corpse Bug, and the Corpse Bug failed to touch it.

“Master Gu, do you have a Plan B?” Zhou Wen asked Gu Shanshui while the Corpse Bug was fighting the chick.

He had many Companion Beasts on him, so it wasn’t impossible for them to kill the Corpse Bug. However, it was meaningless for him to kill it since Gu Shanshui wanted it alive.

“Even the Gu flask made of Pure Essence Gold and the Blood Thread Rope made from Blood Thread Gu can’t trap it. It’s useless even if I have a way to lure it over.” Gu Shanshui shook his head and smiled bitterly.

Upon hearing those words, Zhou Wen recalled something. He took out the calabash and handed it to Gu Shanshui. “Try and see if you can use this to trap the Corpse Bug.”

Gu Shanshui knew the origins of the calabash and was overjoyed when he saw it. However, he couldn’t find any holes despite flipping the calabash around.
