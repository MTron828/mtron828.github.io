Chapter 1577: Forbidden Land of the Gods

Translator: C alon

Zhou Wen imagined that Carlos wanted to take the opportunity to compete with him, but to his surprise, he only shook his hand.

“Mr. Zhou, what brings you here to Sunset City?” asked Carlos. “Someone wants to fight. I heard that Sunset City is a good place, so I came to take a look,” Zhou Wen said. “Although our Cape family had a misunderstanding with you in the past, that’s all in the past. If Mr. Zhou has any displeasure with our Cape family, there’s no harm in saying it out loud. On behalf of the Cape family, I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory answer,” said Carlos calmly. “I’m not the one who wants to fight, but him. You should discuss it with him.” Zhou Wen pointed at Jiuyang

*This gentleman is...”Carlos sized up liuyang, but this person was covered up too well. He couldn’t tell who it was.

Jiuyang glanced at Zhou Wen. He naturally knew that Zhou Wen wanted him to be the scapegoat, but Juyang had no intention of defending himself.

“Jiuyang, lend me your Sunset City,” Jiuyang said indifferently.

Carlos was stunned when he heard Jiuyang’s name. There was probably no one in the Federation who didn’t know Jiuyang’s name.

Carlos looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief only to have him say: “In the flesh.”

“It’s my honor to have the two of you use Sunset City for a battle. However, I hope the two of you can give me some time. I’ll need to clean up Sunset City to make it more conducive for the two of you to fight in peace,” said Carlos pleasantly without flaring up.

“Sure,” Jiuyang said. Jiuyang and Zhou Wen knew that Carlos likely wanted to evacuate the people in the city to prevent them from being accidentally injured in their battle

Jiuyang was at the Calamity grade. If Zhou Wen could be his opponent, he definitely wouldn’t be too weak. A city could easily be destroyed in a battle at that level.

“In that case, I’ll take the two of you to Sunset City to take a look.” After giving instructions to someone, Carlos led Zhou Wen and Jiuyang into the Forbidden Land of the Gods.

Just as the legends said, the Forbidden Land of the Gods was pitch-black. Nothing could be seen. In the darkness, there was a road lined with street lamps that extended into the darkness like a glowing snake. At the end of the road was a brightly lit city. City of Nightlights appeared especially mysterious and beautiful in the darkness.

When Zhou Wen walked into the darkness, he felt nomological forces restrain his body. The Heaven Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder immediately reacted. This was only a normal reaction Back at Mount Laojun, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder would also react.

“Was this Sunset City later built? Zhou Wen was here to find an opportunity to advance to the Calamity grade. He wasn’t interested in a city built by humans.

“Yes, there are no buildings in the Forbidden Land of the Gods. It was just a dark and desolate area. There weren’t even dimensional creatures. Every blade of grass, tree, lamp, and brick here were transported in by our Cape family through painstaking efforts. Everything was constructed according to the design,” said Carlos.

Zhou Wen was even less interested in Sunset City when he heard that. Therefore, he asked, “Could it be that there’s really nothing in the huge Forbidden Land of the Gods?”

“Not really.” Carlos thought for a moment and said, “There’s indeed a city in this darkness, but that city is only left with dilapidated walls. It should have been destroyed in a war. We’ve also studied that city, but we didn’t find any traces of creatures, nor did we find any fragments of daily necessities. It seemed to be an empty city.”

“Interesting. Take us there.” Zhou Wen was intrigued.

“This way, please.” Carlos had a good temper. He led the way with a flashlight and circled around Sunset City before heading deep into the darkness.

Along the way, Zhou Wen observed the Forbidden Land of the Gods. The ground here was barren like wasteland. There were traces of a battle everywhere

The various ring-shaped pits were similar to the ring-shaped craters on the moon. However, it was obvious that the ring-shaped pits here weren’t formed from meteorites, but from a specific impact.

There were also some crisscrossing rifts that looked like huge saber marks no matter how one looked at them. Apart from the darkness, the other laws here were somewhat chaotic. For example, when sound passed through an empty space, there would be a distortion. Clearly, there was a distortion or fault layer in the space.

Darkness wasn’t a problem for Zhou Wen, but the distortion of space and sound affected Truth Listener’s ability.

As Carlos walked, he explained, “Legend has it that the gods once fought here and destroyed everything, including order and light. This prevented all things from growing and eventually turned it into a forbidden land for life.” “Since this is a forbidden land where nothing can live, why is it said that one can live forever here?” Zhou Wen asked.

“It’s just fake news. You can indeed not age here, but that’s only because your face doesn’t age. In fact, your body will still age. No matter how young you look, you will still die when you reach a high age,” said Carlos Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I see. However, even if one doesn’t age visibly, it’s already amazing. There should be many beautiful women who are willing to live in Sunset City for the rest of their lives, right?” Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised. If Sunset City could really gave people eternal life, the Cape family probably wouldn’t be able to occupy this place so safely.

“There are indeed many beautiful ladies who have come to Sunset City to settle down permanently. If Mr. Zhou is interested, you can take a walk in Sunset City. It’s considered a beautiful scene that’s rare elsewhere,” said Carlos with a smile.

Zhou Wen declined to comment. Jiuyang didn’t say a word. Clearly, he wasn’t interested

Carlos told him some more things about the Forbidden Land of the Gods as though he knew everything there was to know. It was impossible to find fault with him. Even as an enemy, it wouldn’t be nice to fall out with him.

Soon, Zhou Wen saw the ruins of an ancient city in front of him. However, there were only some broken walls and stone pillars left. Thanks to the years, these man-made objects had almost returned to their original states.

On the broken walls and stone pillars, there were no human text carvings or patterns. They were all in their most primitive state.

Zhou Wen kept using Truth Listener and his eyes to observe his surroundings, but unfortunately, he didn’t discover anything special in the ruins.

He didn’t find the tiny palm symbol, much less anything that could advance him to the Calamity grade.

“Let’s do it here,” Jiuyang said to Zhou Wen impatiently.

“Alright. Since this is where the gods once fought, it’s a good place for a duel.” Zhou Wen said with a nod.

“Do you want to entrust the child in your hands to them?” said Carlos as he glanced at Demonic Neonate in Zhou Wen’s arms.

“Mr. Zhou, if there’s a need, you can leave her with us. Our Cape family won’t do anything to the child,” said Carlos.

“There’s no need. It’s just for fun. I’ll carry her myself.” Zhou Wen didn’t really plan on fighting Jiuyang to the death.
