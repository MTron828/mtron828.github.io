Chapter 719: Injured

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but sit down and become one of them. He began reciting with them. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Zhou Wen recited in a rhythmic manner as though he was very familiar with it, but he had no idea what he was reciting.

Thankfully, the mysterious power of Teacher Square wasn’t harmful. All he did was sit there and read. There was no further development. Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to escape the mysterious power’s control. He wanted to figure out what the mysterious power was up to.

There were more than a hundred people sitting on the huge Teacher Square. They looked like people who cultivated. Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t a coincidence that they were here.

Why isn’t there any mention of such a strange power on Mount Confucius? Zhou Wen recited whilst studying the content he was reciting.

The content was very esoteric. The language and words were very different from what modern people were used to. It was clearly an ancient article.

Zhou Wen’s level of literacy was very ordinary. He could still understand some simple ancient texts, but he really couldn’t understand such obscure ancient texts.

Previously, Zhou Wen had studied the ancient texts of Daoism and Buddhism, but this ancient text was clearly different from the two. He had never heard of many terms, so he couldn’t figure out what it meant, even after listening for a while.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to memorize the article he was reciting and slowly study it later, but he soon realized that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t remember a single word.

After reciting a sentence, it was as if it had vanished from his memory. He couldn’t memorize it at all.

From the looks of it, I can only try recording it. Zhou Wen wanted to take out his phone to record his voice.

However, he realized that his body wasn’t listening to him. All he could do was sit there and chant. He couldn’t do anything else.

With a thought, Zhou Wen switched his Essence Energy Art to the Dao Sutra. He wanted to use the power of Gods Retreat to break the rules of Teacher Square and take out his phone to record the recital.

Bam!

Just as Zhou Wen switched to the Dao Sutra, he suddenly felt a terrifying force strike him like lightning. The jade infant nearly cracked.

Zhou Wen’s body tumbled down Teacher Square like a balloon. Thankfully, after leaving Teacher Square, Zhou Wen regained control of his body and quickly found his footing.

He spat out a mouthful of blood as his organs were severely injured. Some of his bones had even fractured. Zhou Wen was alarmed. Is the taboo power of Teacher Square that domineering?

However, on second thought, he felt that something was amiss.

The taboo power in Netherworld City was already extremely terrifying, but it wasn’t as potent as this. The taboo power in Teacher Square was no longer something that could be explained by the word “potent.” Zhou Wen felt that the taboo power of Teacher Square was targeting him.

Wait, I think I understand. Zhou Wen immediately recalled.

Legend had it that Mount Confucius was the place where the Confucian and Daoist practitioners fought for supremacy, and Teacher Square was the territory of Confucianism. It was highly likely that he had been targeted when he used the Dao Sutra on Teacher Square.

In that case, I should head to Mount Laojun to take a look. That’s Daoist territory. Zhou Wen wanted to stand up, but his injuries were too severe. The moment he moved, he grimaced in pain.

I should heal my injuries first. Zhou Wen switched to the Inverse Ancient Sovereign Life Soul and used its powerful lifeforce to heal his injured organs and bones.

However, the Inverse Ancient Sovereign only had a powerful lifeforce. Its self-healing speed was far inferior to Li Xuan’s Life Soul.

The antelope looked at Zhou Wen gloatingly, as though it already knew the mystery of Teacher Square.

The chick skipped about on the rocks beside him. It was filled with curiosity about everything.

“Are you alright?” A woman in her thirties walked over and squatted down to ask Zhou Wen.

“I’m fine. It’s just a small injury.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

The woman smiled and said, “You aren’t from around here. It’s your first time at Mount Confucius’s Teacher Square, right?”

“How did you know?” Zhou Wen asked.

“The locals know that you can’t use Daoist Essence Energy Arts on Teacher Square. You must have used the Daoist Essence Energy Art just now to be struck out,” the woman explained.

The recital had ended, and the people sitting on Teacher Square had returned to normal. They were walking down in twos and threes.

They looked at Zhou Wen with a smile. Clearly, they, like the woman, knew why Zhou Wen had been expelled.

“Teacher Square is a holy land for cultivating Confucian Essence Energy Arts like Righteousness. If you cultivate in Daoist Essence Energy Arts, you should head to Mount Laojun.”

The woman thought for a moment and reminded him, “Teacher Square has an hour of recital daily. If you want to tour the area, you can go up after that hour.”

“Thank you for your advice. I wonder if Mount Laojun has any taboos?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“Not really. There’s a Dao book on the top of Mount Laojun, but it requires self-enlightenment. There’s no force that can force you.” The woman sized up Zhou Wen and said, “Your injuries don’t seem light. Do you want me to take you to the hospital?”

“There’s no need. I’ll be fine after resting for a while.” Zhou Wen hurriedly thanked the woman for her kindness.

After the woman left, Zhou Wen sat there to recuperate. However, his injuries were too serious. On the second day, the woman and many people who cultivated in Confucian Essence Energy Art came to Teacher Square again. Yet, Zhou Wen hadn’t completely recovered from his injuries.

“Why are you still here? Are you really fine?” the woman asked Zhou Wen in surprise.

Typically, even if someone was expelled, they wouldn’t be too heavily injured.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. I just like the scenery here. I want to take a break here,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

The average person’s injuries wouldn’t be that serious, but not only did Zhou Wen use the Dao Sutra, but he had also used Gods Retreat, hoping to nullify the taboo power of Teacher Square. That was why he was so heavily injured.

Seeing that Zhou Wen’s expression was much better than yesterday, the woman didn’t say anything else. Like the others, she got onto Teacher Square and sat down. Soon, Zhou Wen heard the familiar recital.

Those people basically came to Teacher Square to read every day. Zhou Wen chatted with the woman a few times and knew that everyone called her Sister Gui.

According to Sister Gui, reading on Teacher Square accelerated one’s cultivation efficiency of Confucian Essence Energy Arts. However, there were very few people cultivating the Confucian Essence Energy Arts now. Therefore, the people who came to Teacher Square for the daily recital were basically acquaintances. They had known each other long ago.

After a few days, Zhou Wen finally recovered from his injuries. However, his injuries were secondary. The primary reason was that it took until now for the jade infant to recover from its injuries.

After recovering, the jade infant gave Zhou Wen a strange feeling as though it was about to break through.

Could it be that being injured helps the jade infant break through? Zhou Wen had a thought.
