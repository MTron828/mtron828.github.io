Chapter 1715 New Dungeon

“Holy sh*t, these two things are awesome!” Liu Yun’s eyes were sharp enough. He could see most of an average Calamity-grade battle.

But now, he couldn’t see the actions of the pheasant and the grass fruit baby. All he could see were two beams of light bouncing around the garden.

“I’m afraid it’s more amazing than you imagine,” Zhou Wen added.

His words came from the bottom of his heart. Zhou Wen had already seen top Calamity creatures. Even existences as powerful as Truth Listener and Starlady Polestar couldn’t do what the pheasant and the grass fruit baby were doing

Zhou Wen didn’t know if the pheasant and the baby were creatures above the Calamity grade, but he was certain of one thing. In terms of speed, the pheasant and the grass fruit baby were probably above Truth Listener and Starlady Polestar.

Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t have any speed-measuring equipment. At their level, it was difficult to tell the difference in speed with the naked eye.

However, there was a very obvious difference between Starlady Polestar and the pheasant. When Starlady Polestar and Truth Listener moved at such speeds, they would produce a terrifying shockwave. Just the shockwave alone could destroy everything beneath the Calamity grade. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, the pheasant was so fast that there was no sonic boom or sound of it breaking through the sound barrier, much less a shockwave. Even the flowers and grass beside it weren’t damaged at all. It looked like they were still growing strong. This alone proved that it was extraordinary.

Zhou Wen vaguely felt that the pheasant might be a legendary Apocalypse-grade existence, but it was only a guess. After all, he had never seen what an Apocalypse-grade existence looked like. Perhaps this was a top Speed-type Calamity.

“Junior Brother, what do you think that baby-like grass fruit is? Even such a powerful dimensional creature wants to eat it. What will happen if we eat it?” Liu Yun couldn’t help but whisper with envy.

“I advise you not to court death.” Zhou Wen was also envious, but he knew very well how terrifying the pheasant’s speed was. Just this speed wasn’t something they could match. If Zhou Wen fused with Great Brahma, he could still hold out a little. Liu Yun would definitely die instantly. It wouldn’t even take him a second to die.

“I’m not stupid. It’s just a thought. I have to go back and flip through the books to see what those fruits are. Even if I can’t eat the big one, aren’t there still many small fruits in the garden? Perhaps I can think of a way to get a few.” Liu Yun was a shrewd person. He felt terrible returning empty-handed from a garden filled with treasures.

“How? Do you dare to head out and pluck them?” Zhou Wen also wanted to get a few grass fruits, but with the pheasant outside, the risk was too great.

“It’s indeed a little dangerous for us to steal them ourselves. We can get our Companion Beasts to steal them while that pheasant is attracted by the grass fruit baby. I have a Companion Beast that’s best at Earth Escape and invisibility. It should be easy to pluck two grass fruits by burrowing to a spot underneath the grass fruits before returning.”

Liu Yun changed the topic and continued, “However, just in case, I think we should cooperate. You should also get a few Companion Beasts. If my Companion Beasts are discovered, they can go out in time to distract that pheasant so that my Companion Beast can return safely. When the time comes, everyone will get a share of the fruits. However, there’s something you have to be careful of. That pheasant’s level definitely isn’t low. It will probably be difficult for ordinary Companion Beasts to attract its attention. It’s best if you bring out some high-level Companion Beasts.” “Dream on. Using my high-level Companion Beast as cannon fodder?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.

“If you have a Companion Beast that can turn invisible and use Earth Escape, you can steal the grass fruits. I don’t mind releasing my Companion Beasts to be the shield. You have to do something, right? You can’t just sit idle and wait for the benefits, right?” Liu Yun said with a smile.

“I don’t have such a Companion Beast, but I don’t want them to be cannon fodder. If you want to steal it, steal it yourself. I won’t snatch it from you.” Zhou Wen really didn’t plan on stealing it.

After all, the dungeon here was already downloading. After the dungeon finished downloading, he could obtain the fruits in-game. There was no need to take the risk. “Alright, let’s make it clear first. Don’t be jealous of the fruits I bring back. Don’t you try to snatch mine.” Liu Yun had wanted to pull Zhou Wen along because he was afraid that he would ruin his plans.

“Don’t worry. Am I someone who does such things?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Yes, you are,” Liu Yun said mercilessly.

“Alright, I guarantee not to touch the fruits you steal. Will that do?” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.

“That’s more like it.” Liu Yun nodded in satisfaction before beginning to summon his Companion Beasts. Zhou Wen originally wanted to see what Companion Beasts Liu Yun had summoned, but his phone suddenly produced a chime.

The dungeon is done downloading? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. The download time for the dungeon was much faster than he imagined.

According to past experience, the higher the level of the dungeon, the slower the download time. It hadn’t been long, but the dungeon had already been downloaded. Didn’t that mean that this dungeon wasn’t very high-level? However, on second thought, he felt that something was amiss. From the metal container and crystals to the pheasant and the grass fruit baby, they were not things that could appear in low-level dungeons. It had to be a high-level dungeon.

If this is really a high-level dungeon, there’s only one possibility left. Has the download speed sped up after the phone was charged? Zhou Wen guessed as he took out his phone to take a look. Indeed, there was an icon on the phone’s home screen. It was the symbol of Xicheng Mountain.

It’s really Kunlun Mountain! Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted when he saw the name under the icon.

Kunlun Mountain’s status in myths was just too high. It was likely that there weren’t many dimensional zones on Earth that were better than Kunlun Mountain.

If one had the strength to clear the Kunlun Mountain instance dungeon, they could dominate all the dimensional zones on Earth.

More importantly, a dimensional zone like Kunlun Mountain might be the testing ground for true Earth’s Companion Beast to choose its owner. After clearing the level, he might even be able to obtain Earth’s Companion Beast.

Of course, if he really discovered that Kunlun Mountain was the testing ground for Earth’s Companion Beast, Zhou Wen would be on guard in reality to prevent others from clearing the level. This was to prevent Earth’s Companion Beast from appearing and blowing up Earth.

Let me see what’s different between the ordinary and hidden modes of Kunlun Mountain. Zhou Wen already had some guesses, but he still needed to confirm them.

After launching the Kunlun Mountain dungeon, Zhou Wen first chose the ordinary mode. After entering, he realized that the blood-colored avatar was standing in front of the Kunlun Mountain’s north entrance. He circled the Kunlun Mountain, but he didn’t discover anything special.

Then, he switched to the hidden mode and entered the Kunlun Mountain instance dungeon again. He quickly discovered something, but this time, he discovered a lot more.

In the past, the hidden dungeon would only have one spot with a concealed halo. As for the Kunlun Mountain dungeon, there were five places with hidden haloes. They looked like the five hidden gates in Kunlun Mountain.
