Chapter 1170: Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light

“From the looks of it, his strength suits you very well,” Zhou Wen said as he sized up Unkilling Dugu.

“You can’t really talk about suitability. Apart from that old fart, I’m the only one from the Dugu family who can enter Shinra Temple. He has no other choice.” Unkilling Dugu sized up Zhou Wen and company and said, “Thankfully, you aren’t from my Dugu family. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the chance to inherit Nameless Dugu’s power.”

Clearly, Zhou Wen and company weren’t affected by Shinra Temple, leaving Unkilling Dugu very surprised.

If a single person wasn’t affected, it could be said to be a coincidence. However, it was odd that so many people and pets weren’t affected.

However, this didn’t matter. Unkilling Dugu had already obtained what he wanted. Even though Zhou Wen and company had entered, there was no way for them to stop him.

Unkilling Dugu looked at Zhou Wen and said, “I still have to thank you for saving my life and helping me obtain true strength. After I become the owner of Myriad Elephant Valley, I will definitely repay you.”

“Since that half of Nameless Dugu failed to become the master of the Dugu family and is still trapped here, do you think you can do what he didn’t?” Zhou Wen said.

“He can’t, but I can,” said Unkilling Dugu confidently.

“I’m afraid I can’t give you such a chance. I have to resolve the trouble I caused. I can’t trouble others,” Zhou Wen said.

“You’re making things difficult for me. No matter what, I owe you. I don’t want to kill you,” said Unkilling Dugu with a sigh.

“Your debt to the Dugu family is greater for raising you. You don’t seem to have any intention of letting them off. I’m nothing,” Zhou Wen said.

“Indeed. Since you’ve chosen this path, you have no choice but to continue.” Unkilling Dugu nodded slightly and looked at Zhou Wen. “It’s still not too late for you to back out now.”

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he looked at Tsukuyomi and the antelope. Zhou Wen felt that the reason that the two of them had entered so eagerly wasn’t just to destroy Unkilling Dugu.

Seeing Zhou Wen remain silent, Unkilling Dugu continued, “Boundless Mountain is about to corporealize. I don’t have time to wait any longer. Since you aren’t willing to back off, I can only send you on your way.”

As he spoke, the golden light over Unkilling Dugu’s body turned into a blinding light. The golden light seemed to be able to pierce into a person’s soul, as though it was about to melt it.

The black-robed man’s expression changed drastically when he saw the golden light. He loudly warned Zhou Wen, “Retreat quickly... That’s the Soul-Washing Divine Light...”

“What’s the Soul-Washing Divine Light?” Zhou Wen’s body was bathed in the golden divine light, but he didn’t sense anything special.

“Outsiders only know that Nameless Dugu is good at movement techniques, but very few people know that his strongest trait isn’t his movement technique, but the Soul-Washing Divine Light. Those who are illuminated by the Soul-Washing Divine Light will have their memories wiped. No matter how strong your body is or how strong you are, if you don’t have any memories, you’ll be like a newborn baby. You will forget everything. It’s useless even if you have a powerful body... Quickly retreat... Don’t be illuminated by the Soul-Washing Divine Light again... You will completely lose your memories...” the black-robed man said anxiously when he saw that Zhou Wen still had no intention of moving. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Without waiting for Zhou Wen to say anything, Unkilling Dugu spoke. “This isn’t the Soul-Washing Divine Light. It should be called the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. Nameless Dugu’s original powers combined with mine produces an effect that far exceeds the original Soul-Washing Divine Light. Now, not only can this divine light wash away memories, but it can also wipe out one’s souls, turning one’s body into a soulless, empty shell... However, I’m indebted to you after all... Now, I’ll only erase your memories... If you don’t leave... the next step won’t be as simple as erasing memories.”

Zhou Wen felt that he really couldn’t recall certain things, but it wasn’t his present memory.

Zhou Wen looked at Tsukuyomi again. She was the one who said that any path was fine. It was impossible for her to do nothing and leave the trouble to him, right?

However, Tsukuyomi’s eyes didn’t look at Unkilling Dugu at all. She kept staring at the stone furnace.

The Ox-Head on the stone furnace had already turned into a dessicated corpse. It looked like it would turn to dust the moment the wind blew. It looked like everything had been passed down to Unkilling Dugu.

Tsukuyomi wasn’t looking at the creature, but the stone furnace itself.

The stone furnace was ancient and the patterns on it were very crude. If it wasn’t so big and in a mysterious place like Shinra Temple, Zhou Wen probably wouldn’t have taken a second look at it.

However, Tsukuyomi seemed to be looking at it very carefully, as though she was observing the patterns inch by inch.

Seeing that Zhou Wen had no intention of retreating, Unkilling Dugu frowned and said, “In that case, don’t blame me. Let me use the strongest Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light to send you away.”

As Unkilling Dugu spoke, his eyes suffused a golden glow. The golden glow became brighter and brighter before finally turning into a blazing white color.

At the same time, his body gradually fused with the divine light. It was as though only the pair of eyes that resembled blazing lamps hung in the air as they stared intently at Zhou Wen and company.

“He has already reached the Terror grade... He’s stronger than my family’s old hero back then. Perhaps it’s really as he said. That divine light might be able to wipe out souls. Quickly retreat,” the black-robed man said in horror.

However, just as the black-robed man finished speaking, he suddenly saw Tsukuyomi beside Zhou Wen move. She walked in the direction of the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light that illuminated the hall like it was daytime and walked towards Unkilling Dugu.

Unkilling Dugu was slightly taken aback when he saw this. However, he was still very confident in his Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. He gathered all his strength and stared at Tsukuyomi with his blazing white eyes.

Back then, Nameless Dugu had relied on the Soul-Washing Divine Light to take his place among the six heroes. He had never encountered anyone who could match him. Back then, Nameless Dugu was only at the Mythical stage.

Later on, when he was trapped in the Shinra Temple, his strength improved further over time. He had already advanced to the Terror grade. Now, with the addition of his powers, Unkilling Dugu refused to believe that this once invincible divine light couldn’t kill the young woman.

The Terror-grade Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light completely bloomed, turning into two beams of divine light that shone on Tsukuyomi.

The black-robed man outside felt his heart turn cold. He originally wanted to use Zhou Wen’s strength to temporarily hold back Unkilling Dugu, but Zhou Wen had been too careless. The few of them had actually braved the attempt to withstand the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light, but there was no doubt about the destined outcome.

However, in the next second, the black-robed man’s pupils suddenly constricted as his mouth gaped open as though he had been petrified.

Unkilling Dugu’s Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light shone at Tsukuyomi. With a wave of Tsukuyomi’s hand, the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light immediately vanished. As for Unkilling Dugu, his body was sent flying as he slammed into the stone furnace. His golden armor shattered.

Blood spewed out of Unkilling Dugu’s mouth, but his face was filled with disbelief, finding what had happened utterly unbelievable.
