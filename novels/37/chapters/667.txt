Chapter 668: Bull Fight

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen had already recovered from his dizziness. Seeing the golden bull already in front of him, he hurriedly flew higher.

Boom!

The golden bull’s leap lost its momentum as its body fell to the ground heavily, smashing a huge crater on the ground.

This fellow can’t fly? Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He pulled out his Bamboo Blade and slashed at the golden bull beneath him with Demonic Astral Wheel.

The golden bull defended with its horn, slamming into the Demonic Astral Wheel and shattering it. With a roar, it leaped up and lunged at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen hurriedly flew higher, preventing the golden bull from touching him before it landed on the ground.

Zhou Wen knew the principle of kiting in gaming terms—retreating when the enemy advanced and chasing when the enemy retreated. The moment the golden bull landed, he swooped down and slashed out Demonic Astral Wheel with his Bamboo Blade. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The golden bull was infuriated. After landing on the ground, it leaped up once again and began to ring the bell in midair. However, Zhou Wen had already flown to a high altitude. Although his head was dizzy, he didn’t fall. The golden bull couldn’t jump high enough, so it couldn’t touch him.

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he engaged in guerilla warfare with the golden bull. At the same time, he lured the enraged golden bull towards Dragon Gate Grotto’s dimensional creatures.

When the infuriated golden bull landed, it immediately squashed many dimensional creatures. When it rang the bell, the dimensional creatures that were more than a hundred meters nearby were affected and became momentarily dizzy.

As such, the dimensional creatures’ offensive slowed down significantly, greatly reducing the pressure on the frontline soldiers.

Zhou Wen lured the golden bull as it charged through the monster horde, causing great chaos.

A large number of Fairies flew towards Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade in one hand and the Overlord Sword in the other. Wherever the saber beams and sword beams went, blood splattered everywhere, unleashing pandemonium on the dimensional creatures at the rear.

The soldiers who were engaged in an intense battle saw that someone had stormed into the dimensional creatures’ horde alone. It was as though he had entered no man’s land. The blood in them pumped with zeal as they unleashed greater firepower.

Many Epic officers and tutors, who were in the midst of killing, felt their spirits lift. The pressure they felt seemed to lessen significantly.

Zhou Wen lured the golden bull and constantly stormed through the dimensional creatures, but he failed to find a way to nullify the bell’s ringing.

Thankfully, the golden bull couldn’t fly, so it couldn’t threaten Zhou Wen’s safety.

The bell chimes from time to time only made Zhou Wen momentarily dizzy. By the time the Fairies surrounded him, Zhou Wen was already awake.

Even if he didn’t wake up in time, with the Golden Overlord Sword by his side, no matter how many Fairies came, they would all be killed with a single strike.

It’s definitely not an aural power. Otherwise, there’s no reason for me to be unable to withstand it at all. Even if it’s a spatial-type power, it’s impossible for me to have zero resistance. Could it be that the bell’s power is actually directly attacking the soul? Zhou Wen thought to himself as the golden bull went crazy from Zhou Wen’s teasing.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The golden bull leaped up and repeatedly vibrated the bell in midair. Zhou Wen immediately felt as though his brain was about to explode as he hugged his head and moaned in pain.

Thankfully, the bell’s range was huge. The surrounding Fairies were also affected in worse ways than Zhou Wen. They screamed and fell from the sky.

After the golden bull landed, it took a few steps back and pawed its hoof on the ground a few times. With a sudden run, it leaped up and reached a record-breaking height. The thick horns on its head slammed into Zhou Wen, who was hugging his head in midair. The bell kept ringing.

Zhou Wen felt as though his brain had been struck by a hammer. The pain left his mind blank.

However, Zhou Wen also knew that the golden bull would definitely deliver a fatal strike at this moment. His willpower was much stronger than that of the average person. Furthermore, when he cultivated the Lost Immortal Sutra in the early days, the Lost Immortal Sutra kept chanting incantations into his ears all day, making his mind more resilient.

Under such circumstances, Zhou Wen could persist by sheer willpower alone and use Lost Country’s teleportation ability.

Almost at the instant Zhou Wen teleported out, two bodies rushed to where he was.

One figure was naturally the golden bull, and the other figure was Li Xuan, who was wearing his carapace. He had insect wings on his back.

“Holy sh*t, what’s going on?” Li Xuan had originally rushed over to save Zhou Wen, but to his surprise, Zhou Wen had vanished. The raging golden bull charged at Li Xuan.

The insect wings on Li Xuan’s back flapped as he narrowly avoided the golden bull’s horns. He somersaulted and ended up landing on the golden bull’s back. He hugged the ox head and cried out, “Old Zhou, I’m in deep shit because of you. Why didn’t you run earlier when you could?”

After Zhou Wen teleported into the distance, he used Ghost Steps to widen the distance again. When he heard Li Xuan, he turned his head and saw Li Xuan sprawled on the golden bull, shouting.

The golden bull angrily jumped around, trying to shake Li Xuan off, but Li Xuan seemed to be stuck to its back. It couldn’t shake him off.

What was strange was that the golden bull’s bell was useless against him.

“Li Xuan, are you immune to the bull’s bell?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

“I just find it a little noisy. Nothing else. I say, quickly think of a way to get me down...” Li Xuan shouted.

“I heard that insects don’t have brains. Could it be that the bell’s strength is really a mental attack? That’s why it’s useless against the brainless Li Xuan?” Zhou Wen muttered to himself.

Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t really think that Li Xuan was brainless, but that his Life Soul was problematic. After all, he had absorbed the Evil King Gu’s Life Soul. It could be said that it was a fusion of two Life Souls. It was indeed stronger than the mental strength of an average person’s Life Soul, so it was very likely the reason it could withstand the bell’s soul-stirring chimes.

“Hold on a little longer. I’ll soon think of a way to resolve the golden bull.” Zhou Wen didn’t immediately rush back when he saw that Li Xuan’s life wasn’t in danger.

It was mainly because it was useless for him to rush back now unless he summoned his Companion Beasts like Truth Listener, Torch Dragon, and Tyrant.

“Bro, can you hurry up? I’m getting a little cowsick...” Li Xuan cried out with a long face. He didn’t dare get off the bull’s back, afraid that he would be killed by it the moment he got off.

Zhou Wen saw that the golden bull was extremely irritated and didn’t chase after him. It wanted to throw Li Xuan down and kill him. Immediately, his heart stirred as he gripped the Golden Overlord Sword tightly and secretly changed his direction.

The Golden Overlord Sword and Bamboo Blade constantly slew the nearby dimensional creatures, reducing them to rivers of blood.

“Li Xuan, agitate it a little,” Zhou Wen shouted.

Li Xuan steeled his mind and reached out his hands to grab the bull’s ears, yanking at them ruthlessly.

The golden bull flew into a rage as it raised its hind legs and twisted its body in midair, hoping to throw Li Xuan off.

Zhou Wen finally saw an opportunity and threw the Golden Overlord Sword like a javelin.

The Golden Overlord Sword transformed into a golden bolt of lightning. At the moment the golden bull raised its hind legs to shake Li Xuan off, the sword pierced through it, slicing something off.

“Ow!” The golden bull’s eyes widened to the limit, but its pupils shrank into needle-like slits. It opened its mouth and let out a strange cry.
