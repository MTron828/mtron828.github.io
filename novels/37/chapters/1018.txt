Chapter 1019: Final Veto Rights

Translator: CKtalon

Boom!

Zhou Wen sensed that Demonic Neonate was moving at high speeds. In the next second, the terrifying collision produced an unimaginable explosion and shockwave that instantly reduced Ant City to ruins.

The blood-colored avatar used the Shell Dragon armor’s Absolute Defense to block the terrifying strike, but in the next second, Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate. An invisible force struck the blood-colored avatar’s body and penetrated the armor, causing its body to explode. The game screen went black.

Terror form... That fellow hasn’t come out of the Guardian cocoon... But she already has the ability to transform into the Terror form... Zhou Wen was alarmed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Zhou Wen knew very well that it was the power of the Terror form. Furthermore, it was one of the stronger ones. At the same time, Zhou Wen’s previous guess had been confirmed.

Demonic Neonate’s Great Demon King state wasn’t an invisibility state. It could even be said that it wasn’t invisibility.

It was only because a Terror form’s lifeform was too high-level that it couldn’t be seen.

However, not every Terror-grade creature could reach such a high-grade Terror form. Up to now, the Terror-grade creatures that Zhou Wen couldn’t see were Demonic Neonate and Ant City’s Guardian.

It was hard to say who was stronger between Demonic Neonate and Ant City’s Guardian, but Zhou Wen’s strength was much weaker. Demonic Neonate wasn’t a protective Companion Beast, so if the Ant City’s Guardian chose to attack Zhou Wen, it was impossible for Demonic Neonate to constantly protect him. As long as Zhou Wen was killed, the game would end. The Ant City’s Guardian didn’t need to fight Demonic Neonate.

Her growth is really fast. I wonder when she obtained the ability to transform. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.

He had downloaded quite a number of dungeons, but this dungeon that had existed from the beginning had yet to be cleared. It looked like he still needed some time.

He didn’t attempt it again. He couldn’t even see her. He had no right to fight the Ant City Guardian.

Actually, if I use Truth Listener to its limits, I can still sense a tiny spatial fluctuation. However, that level isn’t enough to help in a battle. Zhou Wen felt that he needed to advance to the Mythical stage to see Demonic Neonate’s Terror form.

Mythical stage. I’m only one step away from advancing to the Mythical stage. How can I raise the Glimmer to a Perfect Body? Could it be that I really have to teleport to other planets? However, I don’t have the ability to survive in space as someone who’s not at the Mythical stage. I have no way of returning. By the time I could teleport back in a month, I would have long died. After some thought, Zhou Wen had only one solution.

He could use the positioning teleportation ability of the New Era Life Soul to position himself on Earth before using Glimmer to teleport out. Then, he could use the positioning teleportation ability of the New Era Life Soul to return.

The only thing he wasn’t sure of was if the positioning teleportation ability of the New Era could teleport between space. If it couldn’t, he was dead meat in space.

After some hesitation, Zhou Wen didn’t dare continue trying.

He planned to return and think of a way to obtain some space capsules and space suits. After teleporting to other planets, even if he couldn’t teleport back, he could still last for a month on them and wait for the teleportation function of the Glimmer Life Soul to finish the cooldown.

...

Finally, on Saturday night, Gaiman got Lance to find Zhou Wen. Everyone who was prepared to enter the Maze of Lies had already gathered at the door.

Gaiman would personally lead the team this time. Among the younger generation, only Lance would accompany them. The rest were middle-aged or elderly.

Basically, anyone who could enter the maze had at least one Mythical Companion Beast.

Wang Lu was considered a unique existence among them. No one knew how strong she was, nor did anyone care. It was enough as long as she could defeat the twin Destiny Witches during the draw.

“Do you want me to accompany you in?” Li Xuan said with a smile.

“There’s no need. Take care of Ya’er.” Zhou Wen put Ya’er down and stroked her head. “I’ll be back soon. Wait here.”

“Zhou Wen, are you ready?” Gemar asked.

Although he was somewhat displeased that Zhou Wen hadn’t participated in the training, he knew that as a secretary, he couldn’t show his emotions, so his attitude remained very good.

Zhou Wen nodded slightly and came in front of Gaiman. “Mr. Gaiman, there’s something I need to confirm. Do I have complete say on this operation?”

Gaiman frowned slightly. Gemar hurriedly added, “The situation in a dimensional zone is ever-changing. There are many unexpected situations that require immediate reaction. If there’s time to discuss, it will naturally be up to you.”

Gemar’s words were rather respectful, but the meaning behind them was that everyone would act according to the situation.

“Mr. Gaiman, do you share the same view?” Zhou Wen asked Gaiman directly.

Gaiman pondered for a moment and said, “You haven’t entered the Maze of Lies on Sunday. You might not know many things.”

“The information you gave me is sufficiently detailed. I don’t need to go personally to know what’s going on inside the maze.” Zhou Wen saw that Gaiman wasn’t being certain, so he said, “I have an agreement with your family. I will definitely enter the maze, but if I don’t have a hundred percent say, I wish to enter the maze alone. If you are worried, you can get Lance to enter with me. Otherwise, I refuse to participate in this operation.”

With that said, it wasn’t just the local elites. Even the experts from the Ultimate Family Clan couldn’t hold back. Zhou Wen made it sound as though they were a burden.

“Isn’t your request a little too demanding?” Gaiman said as he stared at Zhou Wen.

“We agreed on me having the final veto previously. If you can’t abide by the agreement, I won’t take the risk of entering the dimensional zone,” Zhou Wen said seriously.

“Mr. Gaiman, since he’s afraid to go, why are you forcing him?”

“He’s just a young man who doesn’t know better. Ignore him.”

“Mr. Gaiman, let’s go in. It’s fine if he doesn’t go. Would we not succeed without him?”

The local powerhouses were already displeased with Zhou Wen, but they were even more displeased now.

However, Gaiman was in a dilemma. This was because Frod had exhorted him repeatedly that Zhou Wen had to be present for this operation to succeed. He had to take Zhou Wen in.

Gaiman pondered for a long time before giving in. “Alright. Since it’s an agreement, we’ll do as you wish. You have the final say.”

Everyone was somewhat displeased with Gaiman’s compromise, but since it was Gaiman’s decision, they had no choice.
