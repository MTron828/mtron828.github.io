Chapter 1801 Jade

Seeing this, Zhou Wen hurriedly picked up the Companion Egg on the ground. As for the large number of Essence Energy Crystals, they were useless to Zhou Wen. He didn’t even bother picking them up.

The crack in the mountain wall widened and soon, a bottomless, pitch-black cave appeared. Zhou Wen probed the insides using the Teacher Domain, but he realized that the Essence Energy inside seemed to have dried up. He couldn’t sense any Essence Energy fluctuations.

Nothing happened even when the mountain wall came to a complete standstill. He summoned the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and let him scout ahead as he entered the cave.

The Essence Energy appeared drained. He couldn’t sense any aura, nor did any creatures appear.

The winding cave meandered for several kilometers before it opened up. Zhou Wen and the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General arrived at a huge natural cave.

Just like the tunnel outside, the Essence Energy here had already dried up. There was nothing left in the huge cave. There was no sign of life at all.

In the middle of the cave was a stone that was three to four meters tall.

The stone looked a little strange. It was sharp at the top and round at the bottom, like a sharp stone pillar. It was translucent and grayish-white.

He could vaguely see a weak point flickering inside the stone platform like a heartbeat.

What’s this? Zhou Wen circled the stone a few times, but he couldn’t figure it out.

He ordered the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to attack. It was at the Calamity grade, but the attacks were unable to damage it at all.

This is interesting. Is this thing an item or a creature? Zhou Wen was momentarily unsure.

He summoned Mystic Thearch and Prisoner, but the power of these two top Companion Beasts was still unable to budge the stone pillar.

......

Zhou Wen realized that the hardness of this thing far exceeded his imagination, so he summoned Mystic Thearch and Prisoner back and attached them to himself.

Energy surged crazily into his palm as he unleashed his strongest strength, “In the Human World.” His palm slashed at the stone pillar like a blade.

With a clang, he etched a mark about three centimeters deep on the stone pillar.

Zhou Wen was immediately alarmed. This was a power that could even injure the Apocalypse grade, but it only left such a shallow mark on the stone pillar.

What the hell is this? Zhou Wen didn’t receive any warning that he had attacked a creature, so he became even more intrigued.

He constantly struck the stone pillar, slicing it apart inch by inch. Sweat seeped out of his forehead.

Even someone as powerful as Zhou Wen found it difficult to continuously use strength like In the Human World.

As the stone was pared off bit by bit, the light inside gradually became clearer. After spending plenty of time, he finally heard a ding. The force from In the Human World seemed to have slashed at something even harder; it didn’t leave a trace.

After wiping away the stone dust on the surface, he saw a milky-white, fluorescent jade-like object inside. It was the object that shone, and it felt warm to the touch.

Following the milky-white boundary, Zhou Wen slowly peeled off the translucent stone layer. After spending more time on this, he finally saw the milky-white jade’s complete appearance.

This is… Monkey Sun… Zhou Wen looked at the milky-white jade that was mostly exposed and his eyes couldn’t help but light up. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The milky-white jade looked like a curled-up monkey.

Could this be the legendary Intelligent Stone Monkey? Zhou Wen still remembered the myth he had heard when he was young. Sun Wukong was born out of a stone and was known as one of the Four Dimitrios Monkeys. His name was Intelligent Stone Monkey.

However, on second thought, he found it unlikely. Back then, Zhou Wen had seen the Four Dimitrios Monkeys. This thing was different from the Intelligent Stone Monkey.

After some thought, he thought of another possibility

Among the mythical figures related to the Shang dynasty, there was indeed an ape. It was the leader of the Seven Monsters of Plum Mountain, Yuan Hong, who had cultivated from a white ape.

He was a terrifying being that could fight Erlang Shen. His Eight-Nine Arcane Art was invincible and was almost the apex of physical combat strength.

If it’s really the white ape, it should be a boss. How did it become a block of stone? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

There was nothing else here, and he couldn’t slash apart the jade monkey. All he could do was leave the cave and explore other places.

There were many Calamity-grade existences in the Chess Mountain dungeon. There were also existences that weren’t inferior to the four Demonized Generals, but he didn’t discover any Apocalypse-grade existences.

After touring all of Chess Mountain dungeon, he didn’t discover anything that satisfied him, nor was there any notification of clearing it.

Strange. Could it be that there’s something I haven’t discovered? Zhou Wen circled a few more times. Apart from the jade monkey, there was nothing else that seemed resolvable. “Old Zhou, that old fellow is here again.” Li Xuan interrupted Zhou Wen, who was engrossed in the game.

“Who?” Zhou Wen was momentarily taken aback.

“Who else other than Jing Daoxian?” Li Xuan curled his lips and said, “Apart from that old fellow, there’s also your Eldest Senior Brother, Liu Yun.”

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and followed Li Xuan out to meet Jing Daoxian and Liu Yun in the living room.

“Junior Brother, long time no see. Do you miss your Eldest Senior Brother?” Liu Yun said with a grin.

“I really do,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh.

Among his fellow disciples, only Liu Yun and Hui Haifeng were left. Thinking of Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan, Zhou Wen still found it difficult to accept the fact that they were dead.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, Liu Yun felt a little embarrassed. He sighed and said, “You don’t have to worry too much. Everyone dies eventually.”

“I know.” Zhou Wen nodded and asked Jing Daoxian, “Why are you looking for me?”

“Have you considered what we discussed last time? The day after tomorrow is the best opportunity to enter Chess Mountain. If you miss this opportunity, it will be difficult to enter again,” Jing Daoxian said. “Why the day after tomorrow?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand what Jing Daoxian meant. “There’s no need to act dumb in front of me. Don’t tell me you don’t know about the flower on the mountain wall? I’ve secretly observed it for years. That day is the only day it will disappear every year.”

Jing Daoxian’s words surprised Zhou Wen. “What do you mean by disappearing? Where does it go?”

“It leaves Chess Mountain, but I’m not sure where it goes. It will definitely return in twenty-four hours, so we only have twenty-four hours. We have to exit Chess Mountain regardless of whether we can storm it,” Jing Daoxian said.

Zhou Wen frowned and didn’t say a word. Such matters couldn’t be a lie. Since Jing Daoxian had said so, it was definitely true.

If it was really as Jing Daoxian had said, then this was really an opportunity.

Prisoner also said that Earth’s Companion Beast was on Chess Mountain, but he couldn’t find it in the dungeon. He probably had to make a trip to Chess Mountain in reality.
