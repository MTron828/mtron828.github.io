Chapter 1440: The Door Opener

“If you want to reach the shrine where Pandora lives, you have to be with the program team,” Liu Yun said.

“Why?” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun in surprise. Liu Yun’s spatial teleportation skill wasn’t inferior to his. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that the program team could do something Liu Yun couldn’t.

Liu Yun explained, “There’s a special defensive mechanism in Pandora’s shrine. Not anyone can enter. Even Calamity-grade powerhouses will find it difficult to enter. There’s only one way of entry. Find someone suitable to open the door to Pandora’s shrine.”

“Someone suitable?” Zhou Wen had a guess.

Liu Yun glanced in the direction of the program team before explaining under his breath, “Based on my research, entry to the shrine requires a woman with a special Life Providence to open the door. I searched for a long time before I finally found a woman with that special Life Providence. It’s the female host, Su Yi. Only she can open the door to the shrine. When the time comes, we can enter and steal what’s on Pandora.”

“Your words are too contradictory. Since you haven’t entered before, how do you know that Su Yi’s Life Providence can open the door? Even if Su Yi can open the door, how do you know that you can steal the items from Pandora?” Zhou Wen still felt that there were many loopholes in this matter.

“Why are you asking so many questions? Just tell me if you want a part in this or not. If not, I’ll do it myself. Just don’t be in my way to wealth,” Liu Yun said impatiently.

“Since it’s a partnership, it’s best we make things clear. It’s fine if you don’t wish to cooperate. After all, Li Xuan is rather interested in Su Yi. If he knows, he probably won’t let Su Yi take the risk, right?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“You want to kick me to the curb when I’ve outlived my usefulness?” Liu Yun glared at Zhou Wen angrily.

“Explain clearly if you want cooperation,” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun pondered for a moment before saying with a bitter smile, “It’s not that I don’t want to tell you, but I’m afraid that you won’t believe me if I told you the truth. It will be even more troublesome when the time comes.”

“How do you know I won’t believe you if you don’t tell me?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I obtained the information from Jing Daoxian,” Liu Yun said directly.

“Jing Daoxian?” Disbelief immediately rose in Zhou Wen.

“See? I knew you wouldn’t believe me.” Zhou Wen’s expression was too obvious. Liu Yun shrugged.

Zhou Wen fell silent. Jing Daoxian might have really been to Pandora’s palace and might really know about the situation there, but why was he telling Liu Yun this?

Jing Daoxian couldn’t do much in the past due to his injuries. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, Jing Daoxian’s injuries should have healed by now. Furthermore, he had a Companion Beast like the Yin Yang Mirror. Why didn’t he take the treasure from Pandora but instead told Liu Yun?

“It’s not that I don’t believe you, but Jing Daoxian is just too difficult to figure out. Why would he give you that information?” Zhou Wen said to Liu Yun.

“I made a deal with him. As for what deal it is, I can’t tell you. What I can tell you is that this information is very trustworthy. If you believe me, cooperate with me. If you don’t believe me, don’t be in my way. After this matter is over, regardless of whether it succeeds or not, I’ll treat you to a feast.” Liu Yun seemed very confident that the information Jing Daoxian had given him was real.

Since Liu Yun had already said so, Zhou Wen naturally couldn’t ask further.

“Alright, let’s give it a try. How do you plan on getting Su Yi there? Don’t tell me you plan on kidnapping her?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to take a look.

Liu Yun was a careful person. If he wasn’t completely confident, he wouldn’t show that much confidence.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen did eye the stuff on Pandora.

However, he was different from Liu Yun. Liu Yun wanted the treasures on her, but Zhou Wen was interested in Pandora’s magic box.

When it came to Misfortune-type items, Pandora’s magic box was definitely ranked first. If the magic box was a dimensional creature, using it to create a Mythical Serum might be of great help to Wang Chan.

“There’s obviously no need. They were going to the shrine to begin with. However, no one has opened the shrine’s door in the past. Su Yi doesn’t know that she can open it either. When the time comes, we just need to create some chaos and nudge Su Yi in the right direction. Once the door opens, we will enter without causing any trouble for the program team,” Liu Yun explained.

Zhou Wen felt that it was feasible, but he felt that if only Su Yi could open the door, she probably wouldn’t be able to escape so easily.

The two of them discussed for a while before Liu Yun pretended to take a few photos of Zhou Wen and Ya’er before returning to the program team.

Li Xuan was still chatting with Su Yi and company. Li Xuan was talented. In just a short period of time, he had already become very familiar with the production team as though he was a staff member.

After resting for a while, the production team began filming again. Zhou Wen didn’t find the two dimensional creatures he wanted along the way, so he didn’t take action.

Zhou Wen found an opportunity to inform Li Xuan about his partnership with Liu Yun.

“How can you do that?” Li Xuan immediately shouted.

“Stop shouting. Do you want everyone to hear you?” Zhou Wen tugged at Li Xuan.

When Li Xuan saw that the production team was looking at him, he hurriedly smiled apologetically, indicating that he was fine. Then, he squatted down and whispered to Zhou Wen, “Old Zhou, that Liu Yun isn’t reliable. If only Su Yi could open the door, would Su Yi be able to escape after opening it?”

Zhou Wen also whispered, “Of course I know that it won’t be easy for Su Yi to escape, but think about it. The source is Jing Daoxian. Even if we stop Liu Yun today and don’t get Su Yi to open the door, what will happen in the future? What if Jing Daoxian wants to enter the shrine himself?”

Li Xuan was taken aback when he heard that. He said gloomily, “Then what should we do?”

“Instead of thinking of a solution when the matter isn’t under our control, why don’t we figure things out while we still have the situation under control? If something really happens to Su Yi, we can help her. It’s better than letting her open the door only when she’s threatened, right?” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s true, but isn’t it too risky?” Li Xuan was still hesitant.

“Then marry her and protect her 24/7. Furthermore, you have to be certain that you can defeat Jing Daoxian,” Zhou Wen said.

“What do you plan on doing?” Li Xuan felt that this wasn’t a viable solution. He didn’t have any ideas and could only ask for Zhou Wen’s opinion.

“There’s no other way. Let’s escort Su Yi in and figure out what’s going on inside. We’ll completely resolve this matter.” On the way, Zhou Wen had already attempted to enter Pandora’s Magic Palace dungeon, but strangely, the blood-colored avatar couldn’t enter Pandora’s final shrine.

It was likely as Liu Yun had said. One had to have a special Life Providence to be able to open Pandora’s Magic Palace.
