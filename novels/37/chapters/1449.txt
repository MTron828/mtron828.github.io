Chapter 1450: Influence

The blade was inserted into the scabbard without any gaps. It was like a piece of gray bamboo.

Zhou Wen held the hilt and slowly pulled out the Bamboo Blade from its scabbard. He saw that the blade inside was the same as the scabbard. It was grayish-white in color and looked heavy.

However, a careful look indicated that the blade wasn’t as thick as it looked. The heaviness came from the material itself.

The blade was very thin, but one could only sense its sharpness when facing the blade. Just looking at the blade made one find it excessively heavy.

“Were other materials added to the Bamboo Blade?” Zhou Wen pulled out the Bamboo Blade and brandished it twice. He could clearly sense that the Bamboo Blade’s characteristics were somewhat different from before. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“As there are limited amounts of Essence Gold, we’ve been researching alloys recently. It happened to bear fruit, so we used it on Bamboo Blade,” An Sheng explained. “Be it hardness or toughness, this new alloy has experienced a qualitative leap compared to the former Bamboo Blade. Chick’s help and many technological methods were used during the forging. Only then could we heat the alloy to a state where it could be forged…”

“This shouldn’t be an ordinary alloy, right? Zhou Wen reached out and flicked the blade.” The blade trembled, but it didn’t make any sound. It was rather strange.

Zhou Wen knew very well that if there was really such a brilliant alloy technology, the Sunset soldiers would have one in each hand or the technology would be used to create bullets. The dimensional zones near Luoyang would have long been wiped out, making the situation different.

“There isn’t much of the material used to make this alloy. There’s no way to scale up production for the time being. Using it on the Bamboo Blade can be considered an attempt. The outcome isn’t bad.” An Sheng was telling the truth. It was indeed an attempt.

During this period of time, they had also used many methods to fuse the Refined Essence Gold and Holy Metal together. They hadn’t completely relied on Chick’s phoenix flames.

Pure phoenix flames couldn’t completely melt the two.

“How much did you spend on the materials?” Zhou Wen sheathed the Bamboo Blade. Now that there was no suitable dimensional creature to test the saber, he could only test it in the future.

“They are all materials from our own research. They aren’t worth much, so you don’t have to think about it. However, there’s something you have to be careful about,” An Sheng changed the topic.

“What is it?” Although Zhou Wen knew that An Sheng was changing the topic, he was somewhat curious.

“There’s news from the Li family that Xiao isn’t dead. Furthermore, he has advanced to the Calamity grade. There’s a high chance that he will come to seek revenge on you and Overseer,” An Sheng said with a solemn expression.

“Even that explosion didn’t kill him?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

Zhou Wen felt that he might not have been able to survive the Guardian’s final explosion. It was indeed surprising that Xiao hadn’t been blasted to death.

“In short, be careful. Even Overseer said that Xiao is very terrifying. If you aren’t careful, he might grab onto your weakness.” An Sheng repeatedly exhorted Zhou Wen to be careful. He couldn’t afford to be careless.

Zhou Wen had fought Xiao before and knew that Xiao was indeed terrifying. An Tianzuo had actually managed to finish Xiao off without anyone noticing in such a dangerous place like the Holy Land. He had even pulled off such a beautiful ruse, leaving Zhou Wen very surprised.

In fact, even Zhou Wen couldn’t guarantee that he could do better than An Tianzuo.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen still hadn’t figured out how An Tianzuo had done it.

Even if he had subdued Xiao, it was unimaginable to be able to control his Guardian and use it like it was his. Furthermore, he had to make the dimensional powerhouses in the Holy Land not notice any flaws.

“Got it.” Zhou Wen knew that even if he offered to pay for the Bamboo Blade, An Sheng probably wouldn’t accept it. Furthermore, it wasn’t easy to estimate the value of such precious materials.

He planned on returning the favor when Luoyang encountered a problem in the future.

What can I do to eliminate these strange powers??Zhou Wen was still fretting over what had happened.

Beep! Beep!

His phone suddenly rang. Zhou Wen picked up his phone and realized that it was a message from The Thearch.

“Have you considered the previous suggestion?” The Thearch’s message puzzled Zhou Wen.

Previously, The Thearch wanted him to pull out the stone saber on Fire God Platform, but The Thearch had offered him help in clearing the Venusian dimensional zone back then.

However, he had already obtained the Companion Beast in the Venusian dimensional zone. Furthermore, the Venusian dimensional zone and half of Venus had already shattered. The Thearch’s message now was puzzling.

“The Thearch, how long has it been since you read the news? Don’t you know that the Venusian dimensional zone has been cleared?” Zhou Wen sent a message.

“Of course I do. Not only do I know that Venus has been destroyed, but I also know that the Venusian Companion Beast is with you.” The Thearch quickly sent a message.

“You must be joking. I do want it, but unfortunately, I don’t have the standards,” Zhou Wen replied.

“Don’t think you can rest easy just because you have the Venusian Companion Beast. Don’t forget that Venus isn’t the only planet in the Solar System.” The Thearch had clearly determined that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign.

“That has nothing to do with me. Even if another Companion Beast from another planet appears, a powerhouse like Human Sovereign will naturally snatch it,” Zhou Wen said.

“Your abilities have increased significantly, but unfortunately, you’re still too short-sighted,” The Thearch said.

“Any advice then? Let me see further.” Zhou Wen didn’t mind and took the opportunity to get some information.

“Do you think you will be fine after snatching the Venusian Companion Beast? I suggest you take a look at the recent news in the Federation.” The Thearch quickly sent another message.

“What news?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

However, The Thearch didn’t reply. Zhou Wen had no choice but to go online to take a look. Soon, he knew what news The Thearch wanted him to read.

Although the matter of Human Sovereign obtaining the Venusian Companion Beast plastered the headlines of all the major media outlets, one could still see many news reports of large-scale break-outs in particular dimensional zones.

Zhou Wen searched and realized that ever since Venus had shattered, breakouts happened across dimensional zones at a large scale. Although there had been such cases in the past, it hadn’t happened so frequently.

In particular, the frequency at which Calamity creatures appeared increased significantly.

“Are the recent break-out creatures related to Venus?” Zhou Wen sent another message to The Thearch.

“What else could it be? The shattering of any planet in the Solar System will have a huge impact on Earth. If the Companion Beasts in the Sun appear, it won’t be as simple as an influence. If the Sun also shatters, it will be a question if Earth is still suitable for human survival.” The Thearch finally replied.
