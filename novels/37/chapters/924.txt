Chapter 925: Crossing Dimensions

Zhou Wen followed The Thearch’s instructions and arrived near the bronze tripod. The Nine-Tailed Fox immediately woke up and glared at Zhou Wen as though it would pounce at him at any moment.

Zhou Wen hurriedly held the pearl he had taken from the umbrella in his hand. When the Nine-Tailed Fox saw the pearl, its ferocious look immediately vanished as it stared at the pearl.

Seeing the Nine-Tailed Fox extend its head, Zhou Wen threw the pearl at it.

The Nine-Tailed Fox swallowed the pearl and stared at Zhou Wen. “Human, why are you doing this?”

“I want to borrow the bronze tripod cauldron to teleport to the dimension.” Seeing the Nine-Tailed Fox acting as The Thearch had said, he felt much more at ease.

“On the account that you brought the Stabilizing Bead to me, I can let you use the bronze tripod. However, why are you going to the dimension as a human? Are you sick of living?” the Nine-Tailed Fox asked with a seductive voice.

“I want to find someone in the dimension,” Zhou Wen said.

“Who?” the Nine-Tailed Fox asked again.

“Emperor of Shang,” Zhou Wen answered according to The Thearch’s instructions.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s answer, the Nine-Tailed Fox’s mesmerizing eyes lit up as it stared intently at Zhou Wen and asked, “Why are you looking for him?”

“Emperor of Shang is an imperial lord of our human race. He has the supreme glory of the human race and is the person I respect the most. The reason I’m looking for him is firstly to see the Emperor’s face, and secondly, to learn some skills from him. I hope to bring glory to my human race...” Zhou Wen said the lines he had thought of.

In order to think up these lines, Zhou Wen had lost quite a bit of hair.

The Thearch only gave him a general outline of how to communicate with the Nine-Tailed Fox. She told him to try his best to praise Emperor of Shang, but Zhou Wen had to fill in the details himself.

Zhou Wen wasn’t good at praising others to begin with. It wasn’t easy for him to come up with such phrases. It was unknown how many brain cells he had lost in the process.

When the Nine-Tailed Fox heard Zhou Wen, its expression gradually softened. It looked at Zhou Wen and said, “You are a mere human. You will probably die very soon after entering a dimensional zone. How will you be able to see Emperor of Shang? Forget it. On account of the fact that you gave me the Stabilizing Bead, I’ll lend you something. Take it with you, and you’ll still stand a chance. Return it to me when you return.”

“How can I accept this?” Despite saying this, Zhou Wen was delighted deep down.

He originally thought about how he could trick the Nine-Tailed Fox into giving him the item like The Thearch had said. He never expected the Nine-Tailed Fox to take the initiative to offer it to him.

“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. If you see Emperor of Shang, help me pass a message to him,” said the Nine-Tailed Fox.

“No problem. As long as I can see him, I’ll definitely deliver the message. If I can’t see him, there’s nothing I can do.” Zhou Wen paused before saying, “What message do you want me to deliver?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The Nine-Tailed Fox fell silent for a moment before slowly saying, “Think not.”

“What?” Zhou Wen was momentarily confused.

“Do you need me to carve it on your face?” the Nine-Tailed Fox asked Zhou Wen coldly.

Zhou Wen hurriedly recalled and said, “There’s no need. I got it. It’s just ‘think not,’ meaning think not of something, right?”

The Nine-Tailed Fox glanced at him coldly but didn’t say anything. It opened its mouth and spat out something. It was a pearl that was as crystalline as the moon.

“Take it with you. It can conceal your human aura, and it can also prevent most dimensional creatures from hating you. However, if you encounter a Terror-grade dimensional creature, it’s best you hide far away. If you encounter a Calamity-grade god, kill yourself to avoid suffering,” the Nine-Tailed Fox said.

Zhou Wen reached out to catch the pearl. It was warm to the touch and emitted a fragrance like perfume. He hurriedly put it away.

“Come in. I’ll send you there. Remember the message. If you forget it, you won’t have a chance of survival when you return,” said the Nine-Tailed Fox.

“Don’t worry. As long as I don’t die, I’ll definitely deliver the message,” Zhou Wen said as he jumped into the bronze tripod.

Zhou Wen had seen the bronze tripod cauldron many times in-game. He originally imagined that it was a tool to suppress the Nine-Tailed Fox, but he never expected it to have the ability to traverse dimensions.

After Zhou Wen entered the bronze tripod, the Nine-Tailed Fox stood up, tightening the chains. At the same time, its body emitted a demonic glow as terrifying Essence Energy seeped into the bronze tripod through the chains, causing it to emit a strange luster. The mysterious runes on it lit up.

“Remember, you only have 36 hours. You have to return before the time is up. Otherwise, you will be trapped in the dimension forever.” The Nine-Tailed Fox’s voice entered Zhou Wen’s ears.

Zhou Wen felt the world spin as a huge vortex formed in the cauldron, sucking him in.

Zhou Wen hurriedly switched his Essence Energy Art to a Civilized Country. After all, it was a spatial teleportation. It should be able to strengthen Civilized Country to a certain extent.

As the spatial vortex spun, Zhou Wen suddenly made a connection. Was this feeling the same when flushing the toilet?

The dizziness continued. Zhou Wen could sense that his body seemed to be teleporting, but the teleportation was taking a little too long.

At that moment, the energy in Civilized Country constantly increased. The speed at which it grew far exceeded Zhou Wen’s imagination.

Zhou Wen had seriously underestimated the difficulty of teleporting into the dimension. He had been to the dimension using the cube, so he felt that it wasn’t a big deal.

However, in fact, entering the dimension through the cube was completely different from sneaking into the dimension. The difficulty was incalculable, and the teleportation method was completely different.

It could be said that the energy needed to teleport 10,000 times using a cube wasn’t even comparable to the energy needed to sneak into it once.

Back then, Wang Mingyuan had used the power of the six Holy Temples to break through the dimensional barrier. How much terrifying energy was that?

Although the bronze tripod wasn’t forcefully breaking through the dimensional barrier and didn’t expend that much energy, it was far from what ordinary spatial teleportation could compare with.

After a long period of dizziness and loss of control, Zhou Wen didn’t know how long he had been teleporting because he wasn’t able to judge time and space. In any case, it felt extremely long.

Plop!

Zhou Wen felt himself fall into the water as his body gradually returned to normal.

What left him pleasantly surprised was that Civilized Country had obtained unimaginable energy during the teleportation process. Now, Civilized Country was about to break through to a Perfect Body.

What an unexpected gain. From the looks of it, I just need a few more teleportations to advance to a Perfect Body. Zhou Wen was delighted.

After floating out of the water, Zhou Wen wanted to see where he was, but the scene he saw made his expression turn odd.
