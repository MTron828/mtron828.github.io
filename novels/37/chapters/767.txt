Chapter 768: Kuman Thong Life Soul

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal was extremely fast, allowing him to instantly arrive at the beacon tower.

The two-handled pot was still on the beacon tower, but it was swaying as though it had been moved by something before disappearing.

Truth Listener could hear the sounds of motion and determine where an object was, but it couldn’t outline an exact shape.

Zhou Wen activated the Holy Hell King Life Soul and opened the Eye of the Holy Hell King. Immediately, he saw a child running with the two-handled Devil’s Pot.

The child was much smaller than Demonic Neonate, but the sinflames on his body were very rich.

The child turned his head to look at Zhou Wen, leaving him slightly taken aback. The child’s facial features were very blurry as though he hadn’t grown up. His body was also very strange. His stomach was huge, but his limbs were tiny. He was indescribably terrifying and bizarre.

Activating the Eye of the Holy Hell King, a force swallowed the invisible child into the Eye of the Holy Hell King. The child seemed to be made of pure sinflames so he was directly absorbed and refined to nothingness.

Zhou Wen could even sense that his Holy Hell King Life Soul had made significant progress. If he could have more of these Life Souls, he might be able to successfully evolve a Perfect Body.

Clang!

After the child was absorbed and refined, the Devil’s Pot that had disappeared immediately dropped to the ground. At the same time, Zhou Wen heard a tragic cry. He saw Xiao Si spew out a mouthful of blood as the color in his face drained. It was as though he had suffered a fatal blow.

The destruction of Xiao Si’s Life Soul was naturally a severe blow to him. He had dropped from the Epic stage to the Legendary stage, astounding and infuriating him.

Zhou Wen grabbed the Devil’s Pot and with a flash, he returned to Wang Chan’s side. He stared at Xiao Si, who was about to escape, and said, “This is yours, right?”

“What are you talking about? How can that crappy pot be mine?” Xiao Si immediately shook his head and said.

“I originally wanted to give you a chance to live. Since you aren’t appreciating it, there’s no need to say anything else,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to draw his Bamboo Blade.

“Wait! What do you want?” Xiao Si was terrified, but he still pretended to be calm.

He had seen Zhou Wen kill the Silver-Winged Yaksha with a single blow and knew how terrifying Zhou Wen’s strength was. As for the Life Soul that Xiao Si had relied on and others couldn’t see, it had been killed by Zhou Wen. He had lost his composure.

“Answer a few of my questions. If your answers satisfy me, I can consider letting you live,” Zhou Wen said.

“Ask whatever you want to know. However, that Devil’s Pot has nothing to do with me,” Xiao Si said through gritted teeth.

“Alright, so you were the one behind this. I thought it was me...” Wang Chan also understood what had happened and glared at Xiao Si angrily.

Zhou Wen pulled her behind him and looked at Xiao Si. “I don’t care if it has anything to do with you. Tell me the origins of this pot and what use does it have?”

“This pot is named Devil’s Pot in the South District. You’ll know once you ask around. It can seal certain special dimensional creatures.” As Xiao Si answered, his fingers moved in his sleeve.

“How can I control this pot?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“It’s very simple.” Xiao Si explained the usage of the Devil’s Pot.

“That child was your Life Soul, right? What’s his name? What’s his use?” Zhou Wen asked again.

He was very interested in Xiao Si’s Life Soul. For a Life Soul to have so many sinflames—even more than the sinflames on Xiao Si’s body—made no sense.

“Kuman Thong. It’s a relatively common Life Soul in Chiang Rai. As long as one cultivates the Kuman Thong Essence Energy Art, they will have a Kuman Thong Life Soul. However, their abilities will be slightly different,” Xiao Si said.

Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up when he heard that. He stared at Xiao Si and asked, “Does that mean that many people in Chiang Rai have Kuman Thong Life Souls?”

“It’s not just Chiang Rai. Many Epic experts in the nearby regions have Kuman Thong Life Souls,” Xiao Si answered readily.

“One last question. Why do you want to take Wang Chan to the Xiao family?” Zhou Wen stared at Xiao Si and asked.

“Of course, I wish to obtain the Wang family’s help to make our Xiao family...” Before Xiao Si could finish his sentence, Zhou Wen had already unsheathed his Bamboo Blade.

A saber beam flashed. Before Xiao Si and Wang Chan could see what was happening, the Bamboo Blade had already returned to its scabbard. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“You... You said you wouldn’t kill me...” Xiao Si’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly covered his neck with his hand. However, the moment his hand touched his neck, a bloody mark appeared on his originally normal neck. Then, blood gushed out. He couldn’t stop the blood no matter how hard he tried.

“I said that I could let you live if I was satisfied with your answer. Now, I’m very unsatisfied with your answer, so I refuse to give you a way out,” Zhou Wen said matter-of-factly.

“You...” Xiao Si opened his mouth, but at that moment, his mouth was filled with blood. He couldn’t say a word. He fell to the ground and twitched a few times before he died.

Zhou Wen used the sheathed Bamboo Blade to pry open his palm and saw a strange plaque in his hand. It was black, but it looked like the bone of some creature. The plaque had a mysterious engraving, and the necklace connected to the plaque was made using many strange materials. He was unsure what it was.

“This is a Buddha plaque.” Wang Chan recognized what it was.

“What’s a Buddha plaque? One used to honor Buddha?” Zhou Wen really didn’t know what a Buddha plaque was.

“No, a Buddha plaque is a dimensional artifact created by some Epic experts in the South District using dimensional materials. Typically, it’s made from the bones of a dimensional creature before forcefully sealing a Companion Beast inside the Buddha plaque. This way, the Buddha plaque will have the power of a Companion Beast, but it doesn’t have a master. As long as a special method is used, anyone can use the power of the Companion Beast inside the Buddha plaque. This will allow some Mortal stage or even ordinary people who have never cultivated to borrow the power of a Companion Beast,” Wang Chan said.

“There’s actually such a magical technique. Why hasn’t the Federation promoted such a technique?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

It allowed ordinary people to use the power of high-level Companion Beasts. This technique was just extremely powerful.

“Companion Beasts sealed in the Buddha plaque can only use a portion of their strength. Furthermore, when used by ordinary people, there will be many taboos. A single mistake will result in a backlash. The average person wouldn’t choose such a method to control a Companion Beast. This is similar to the Kuman Thong Life Soul. The Kuman Thong Life Soul is also a Life Soul that allows quick formation. As long as the correct method is used, it’s very easy to condense a Kuman Thong Life Soul. However, the method of condensing the Kuman Thong is very cruel. Furthermore, like the Buddha plaque, it’s easy for it to negatively affect its owner. Therefore, other than a certain area in the South District, there are very few people who cultivate the Kuman Thong Life Soul. I never expected that this b*stard, Xiao Si, would cultivate the Kuman Thong Life Soul. Furthermore, it’s in the form of a child. Damn it.” Wang Chan kicked Xiao Si’s corpse hatefully.
