Chapter 1327: Outbreak of Misfortune

“Who are you? Is that important? In my opinion, it doesn’t matter who you are,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

“The ignorant are fearless. Do you think I’m one of those trash Guardians sent over from the dimension? I’m a Guardian who survived the Mythical era. Even if you can use the Mythical Serum to advance to the Terror grade, in my opinion, you’re just a baby holding a big knife,” the Guardian said as she stared at Zhou Wen.

“Are you done? If you’re done, prepare to die,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned the Dragon King armor and Asura Saber.

Zhou Wen knew a lot about Guardians. A truly powerful Guardian, even a Guardian who had survived the Mythical era, would still be suppressed by Earth’s laws.

Was Drought Demon Fairy impressive? All she could do was be trapped in the Fiend Tomb. Without a human contract, she was suppressed to the point of being unable to leave the Fiend Tomb.

No matter how powerful this Guardian was in the past, the fact that she could stand here without a contract and not be suppressed meant that she couldn’t be at the Calamity grade. At best, she was at the Terror grade.

“You are Deceit King?” Upon seeing the Dragon King armor and Asura Saber, the Guardian immediately recognized Zhou Wen and her expression changed uncontrollably.

The name ‘Deceit King’ was known by all on Earth now. Even the Guardians knew this name.

The Dragon King Armor and Asura Saber were like the Prisoned Dragon Armor and the Immortal Culling Sword of Human Sovereign. They were easily recognized.

Of course, the Son of Heaven’s Sword was also easily recognized, but Zhou Wen usually didn’t use it because it lacked offensive power.

Deceit King had consecutively defeated Ya and Immortal—both top Terror-grade Guardians. Although this Guardian believed that she wasn’t inferior to them, she didn’t dare say that victory was a cinch.

However, this wasn’t the only thing that alarmed the Guardian. This was because Zhou Wen was clearly a pure human. He had easily broken through to the Terror grade without any external help.

Only then did the Guardian realize that the person Wang Lu had mentioned wasn’t Human Sovereign. It was likely Zhou Wen who was right in front of her.

Can pure humans really advance to the Mythical stage by themselves? That’s impossible. He must have used some external force. It’s just that I can’t tell. Perhaps it’s a Mythical Serum that doesn’t have obvious characteristics of dimensional creatures,?the Guardian thought.

Zhou Wen didn’t wish to speak to her as he slashed with the Asura Saber.

The Guardian’s figure blinked, and many illusions appeared. In an instant, her figure was everywhere in the courtyard. It was impossible to tell which was real and which was fake.

The phantoms from all directions attacked Zhou Wen. They had terrifying auras and powerful Essence Energy fluctuations. It was impossible to tell which attack was real and which attack was fake.

It was naturally impossible for a single person to simultaneously defend against all attacks.

“I have the power of all things. You can’t even tell which one is my real body, so how can you fight me?” The phantoms spoke at the same time—even their voices were the same.

Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he ignored all the attacks. The Asura Saber slashed at an empty spot. With a domineering stance, Transcendent Flying Immortal instantly split a fake mountain in half.

The attacks that filled the sky landed on Zhou Wen, but they turned into bubbles and failed to injure him at all.

Behind the rockery, the Guardian’s eyes widened in disbelief as she retreated uncontrollably. In the middle of her forehead, a bloody gash was slowly spreading.

She had only taken a few steps back when her leg hit a rock. Her body immediately split into two and she fell to the ground, her blood staining the grass beside her.

Amongst Mythical creatures, even the transformation technique of the Six-Eared Macaque of the Four Dimitrios Monkeys couldn’t fool Truth Listener, let alone the Guardian.

Zhou Wen retracted the Asura Saber and Dragon King armor. Without looking at the corpse, he came in front of Wang Lu and asked, “Is there really no other way to treat your injuries?”

Wang Lu shook her head. “No. The power of luck makes it very difficult for me to be injured, but once I’m injured, I can only recover on my own. I can’t undergo treatment. I’ve tried using pill essences and healing powers before, but it was useless.”

“Thank you,” Zhou Wen said with a sigh. If not for her lending him the Companion Beast, Wang Lu wouldn’t have been injured.

“Didn’t you help me now? We’re even.” Wang Lu turned to look at the Wang family’s smoking area and said anxiously, “Now’s not the time to talk about this. I have to think of a way to resolve Little Chan’s bad luck…”

“Leave this to me. I’ll take Wang Chan away for a period of time. When you recover, I’ll send her back,” Zhou Wen said as he flashed away.

“How can you…” Wang Lu wanted to stop him, but Zhou Wen was already gone.

…

After five years, Wang Chan had grown into a slender and elegant girl.

At that moment, Wang Chan was in a panic. She could sense that the power of misfortune in her body was producing the effects. The commotion in the Wang family was closely related to her power of misfortune.

“Wang Chan, do you still recognize me?” Zhou Wen instant transmitted in front of Wang Chan and called out softly.

“Zhou Wen!” Wang Chan was first delighted when she saw Zhou Wen. She wanted to walk over, but she immediately retreated and said anxiously, “Don’t come over. Leave quickly. Don’t approach me. It’s dangerous.”

“Don’t be afraid. I know something is wrong with you. Your sister asked me to come over to resolve the problem with you. Come with me.” Zhou Wen extended his hand in front of Wang Chan.

Wang Chan only hesitated for a moment before giving her hand to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen held Wang Chan’s hand and used Singularity Universe’s interstellar teleportation ability to arrive on the moon.

“Stand beside me. Don’t be too far away.” Zhou Wen used Human Sovereign’s power. The powerful life force emitted by Human Sovereign’s power allowed Wang Chan to survive on the moon despite the lack of oxygen. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Is this the Moon?” Wang Chan looked around curiously. This place was different from what she had imagined.

“Yes, follow me.” Zhou Wen led Wang Chan towards Lady Supreme Yin’s temple.

Wang Chan’s power of misfortune was too strong. It wasn’t appropriate for Zhou Wen to take her anywhere, so he could only come up to the moon first, hoping that Lady Supreme Yin could take Wang Chan in for a while.

As long as Wang Lu’s injuries recovered and her luck powers were activated again, Wang Chan could return.

Bang!

Zhou Wen didn’t manage to walk far before he suddenly tripped himself and fell to the ground with a plop.

Even Zhou Wen didn’t know how he failed to respond to that momentary confusion.

“Zhou Wen, are you alright?” Wang Chan hurriedly came over to help Zhou Wen.

“I’m fine…” Just as Zhou Wen said that he was fine, Wang Chan slammed into his face because she wasn’t used to the Moon’s different gravitational strength.
