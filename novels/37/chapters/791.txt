Chapter 792: Encountering Danger

Translator: CKtalon

“Inject your Essence Energy into it and it will automatically open a hole. However, it doesn’t seem to have the ability to control Gu. You must think of a way to get the Gu inside,” Zhou Wen said.

Gu Shanshui gave it a try. Indeed, as long as he injected Essence Energy, a gray fog would appear at the top of the calabash, allowing him to put things through the gray fog.

Holding the calabash, Gu Shanshui gritted his teeth and said, “Then we can only risk it.”

Gu Shanshui summoned his Golden Child Life Soul and got him to rush at the Corpse Bug with the calabash.

When the Corpse Bug saw the Golden Child, it was like a bee seeing honey. It abandoned the chick and rushed towards the Golden Child as if it wanted to devour him.

Zhou Wen was greatly surprised. He didn’t know that the Golden Child Life Soul was that attractive to the Corpse Bug.

Golden Child could also use Essence Energy. It injected its Essence Energy into the calabash and took the opportunity when the Corpse Bug rushed over to store it inside the calabash.

Unfortunately, Golden Child was only an Epic Life Soul. Its speed was much slower than the Corpse Bug. Just as the Corpse Bug’s figure flashed, it circled around the calabash and charged at Golden Child’s head.

“No good!” Gu Shanshui’s expression changed drastically. If his Life Soul was destroyed, it wouldn’t be easy to condense another Life Soul.

In particular, his Golden Child Life Soul was also a type of Kuman Thong. However, his was a Heaven Baby and not an unorthodox Earth Baby or Man Baby. It was very rare.

Just as the Corpse Bug was about to slam into the Golden Child’s head, a bamboo suddenly slammed into the calabash, tipping the calabash’s mouth. It happened to hit the Corpse Bug, causing it to vanish and be stored in the calabash.

Zhou Wen extended his hand and retracted the sheathed Bamboo Blade.

Gu Shanshui was overjoyed as he hurriedly got Golden Child to withdraw his Essence Energy. The gray fog on the calabash vanished without a trace.

A faint sound of a collision came from the calabash. It was likely that the worm had slammed into the calabash and wanted to rush out. However, it didn’t seem to show any effects against the calabash.

“Mr. Zhou, it’s all thanks to you that I was able to catch the Corpse Bug. I really don’t know how to thank you,” Gu Shanshui said excitedly.

“I’m just fulfilling my previous promise. Master Gu, don’t take it to heart. However, you still have to think of a way to find a container when we return. I still have other uses for this calabash,” Zhou Wen said.

“I’ll think of a way to resolve it when we get back,” Gu Shanshui said hurriedly.

“Congratulations on fulfilling your wish, Master Gu.” Li Mobai walked over with Butterfly and Mute, congratulating Gu Shanshui on finally catching the Corpse Bug.

“It’s all thanks to you and Mr. Zhou.” Gu Shanshui was very happy, but he wasn’t blinded by his emotions. “Let’s leave Dragon Corpse River now. It’s not safe here.”

Everyone pushed the wooden boat down the river and rowed back the way they came.

Not long after, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.

Previously, when they had come, the Gu in the Dragon Corpse River didn’t get too close to the wooden ship. However, when they returned, the nearby Gu slowly approached the wooden boat. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Furthermore, there were more and more of them. If the chick wasn’t on the boat, they would have long charged forward.

“Master Gu, something seems amiss,” Zhou Wen said to Gu Shanshui.

Gu Shanshui had also noticed the abnormality. He nodded with a heavy expression and said, “It looks like the Gu in Dragon Corpse River are gathering because of the Corpse Bug. However, they don’t dare approach because of the divine bird. But...”

With that said, Gu Shanshui paused before continuing, “However, there might be a terrifying creature in Dragon Corpse River. If it is affected like these Gu, even the aura of the divine bird might not be able to intimidate it. When that happens, we will be in big trouble.”

Zhou Wen immediately thought of the huge shadow at the bottom of the river when they came.

“Is there any other solution?” Zhou Wen asked.

Gu Shanshui shook his head slightly. “Even the calabash and wooden boat can’t block the signal emitted by the Corpse Bug. I’m afraid there’s no good solution.”

After some hesitation, Gu Shanshui said, “If it really doesn’t work, I’ll return the Corpse Bug.”

Gu Lou and Gu He were alarmed as they hurriedly said, “Master Gu, you can’t. You finally caught the Corpse Bug after so much difficulty. This Corpse Bug is too important to you. You shouldn’t let it go so easily. Perhaps Dragon Corpse River doesn’t have that terrifying creature, or perhaps that creature isn’t affected by the Corpse Bug at all...”

Gu Shanshui shook his head and sighed. “I never expected the Corpse Bug to be able to trigger the Gu in Dragon Corpse River. Rearing a Corpse Bug is indeed my wish, but I can’t gamble the lives of so many of us. If we were on land, we could still think of a solution, but now, we are on Dragon Corpse River. There are too many taboos here. Once that creature appears, we will definitely die.”

With that said, Gu Shanshui prepared to open the calabash and release the Corpse Bug.

Zhou Wen suddenly said, “Master Gu, even if you release the Corpse Bug now, I’m afraid it won’t be able to quell the agitation of the Gu in Dragon Corpse River. We’ve already captured the Corpse Bug. With its intelligence and personality, do you think it will let us leave Dragon Corpse River safely even if we release it?”

Gu Shanshui said with a bitter smile, “I also know that Gu are the most vengeful, but what else can we do?”

Li Mobai said, “Master Gu, I think Zhou Wen is right. Since Gu bear grudges, it’s impossible to avoid its revenge whether we release it or not. Why don’t we leave it as a hostage... Perhaps there’s a chance of leaving Dragon Corpse River.”

Gu Shanshui gritted his teeth. “Now that things have come to this, I can only take a gamble. I didn’t think things through properly this time, so I made everyone suffer with me. If I don’t die today, I’ll make amends to everyone in the future.”

“We’ll talk about those things in the future. Let’s do some preparatory work first. Even if there are creatures in Dragon Corpse River that even the divine bird can’t stop, we won’t be sitting back and doing nothing,” Li Mobai said.

They discussed things for a while and began making preparations.

Unfortunately, the range of their activity was limited to the wooden boat. They couldn’t leave the wooden boat and fly into the sky, nor could they touch the water. They couldn’t even be injured. This was too restrictive for them.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned the Primordial Spore. He got it to enter the water to probe the situation. No matter how powerful the Gu in the water were, it was difficult to discover such minute Companion Beasts.

After the Primordial Spore entered the water, it followed Zhou Wen’s instructions and dived forward.

Everyone did everything they could to ensure that the wooden boat continued forward. More and more Gu gathered in the surrounding waters, and they were getting closer and closer to the wooden boat. They could see the churning water in the distance with their naked eyes. There were all sorts of Gu around them, squeezed together. It was strange and nauseating.

And under Zhou Wen’s observation, there was a huge shadow at the bottom of the river approaching the wooden boat.
