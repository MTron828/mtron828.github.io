Chapter 1694: Our Relationship as Fellow Disciples Can’t Just Fade Away

Professor Gu felt a little embarrassed as Karoman walked up the stone steps. The sun-like golden divine light on his body was still as resplendent as before. Anyone could tell that he had found a way to be immune to the Essence Energy drainage.

Under the attention of everyone, Karoman pushed open the door to Alkaid Star Palace. It was like an unknown new world that drew everyone’s attention.

Starlight shimmered in Alkaid Star Palace. Starlord Army Breaker stood there like a god.

Karoman didn’t show any fear. The golden divine light on his body rose like flames as he walked towards Starlord Army Breaker.

His footsteps were calm and he wasn’t as fast as he was in the other Star Palaces. After all, Starlord Army Breaker was an unknown Starlord. He had only obtained some information from the Sun God Holy Temple, and it was only speculation. It wasn’t completely accurate.

Starlord Army Breaker suddenly opened his eyes. His originally calm aura immediately turned into killing intent that surged into the sky. His body charged at Karoman like a phantom.

Karoman didn’t retreat and actually went forward.

Starlight shot out as the sun shone.

The screen was filled with light, making it impossible to see what had happened. Only a few Calamity-grade experts could tell what had happened by standing in front of a Cube.

The entire world was dead silent. Everyone looked at the screen that was trembling violently with light. Although they didn’t know what had happened, the sound of forces colliding inside made their hearts undergo upheavals.

“Can Karoman clear the seventh Star Palace?” Su Yi muttered.

“A battle at this level is too high-end. Ignoring the fact that I can’t see anything on the livestream, even a Calamity-grade powerhouse can only see some clues through the Cube. All we can do now is wait for the slow-motion replay before analyzing. However, when the outcome is decided, there won’t be much point analyzing,” Professor Gu said with a bitter smile.

“Professor Gu, we believe in you. Karoman will definitely win.”

“Sect Master Gu, that’s not right. You can’t doubt your jinxing standards. You have to be confident in yourself.”

“Don’t say another word. You are our beacon of light. We don’t even need to see the outcome to know that Karoman will definitely win.”

Many people in the comments were teasing Professor Gu, making him feel a little depressed. However, after such a long time, he had mostly gotten used to it. The title of Jinx Sect Master had long been known by the entire world.

Mohe stood in front of the Cube with a strange expression.

“Mohe, what’s the situation? What are the chances of Karoman winning?” an elder from the Family Clan of Gods asked.

Even the powerhouses of the Family Clan of Gods couldn’t tell much.

“Karoman has already figured out Starlord Army Breaker’s abilities. I’m afraid he’s about to clear the seventh Star Palace.” Mohe paused before saying, “This fellow is indeed terrifyingly strong. It’s not only because he obtained the resources of the Sun God Temple, but mainly because he has extremely high combat intelligence and talent.”

“He’s clearing it now? From the looks of it, this person poses the greatest threat to our Family Clan of Gods among the younger generation,” the elder said after some thought.

Mohe didn’t refute him, but another figure appeared in his mind. Although Karoman was indeed very powerful, he still found that person even more terrifying.

Time ticked by. When people could finally see the scene on the screen, only the son of the Sun God, Karoman, remained standing in the Star Palace.

“He cleared the seventh Star Palace in less than six minutes. He’s really strong.”

“Karoman is truly invincible.”

“He’s undoubtedly the strongest human at this stage.”

“F*ck, the Cape family sure is lucky. They clearly are backed by the Divine Emperor Holy Temple, but they actually produced a representative of the Sun God Temple. This is just ridiculous.”

Amidst everyone’s exclamations of praise, Karoman walked towards the teleportation nexus and was teleported out of the Big Dipper Palaces. The ranking on the Cube remained the same. Karoman remained in first place.

“As expected, the Alkaid Star Palace is the last Star Palace. Karoman is the first human to clear the Big Dipper Palaces. He will permanently enter the annals of history. Even if someone else clears the seventh Star Palace in the future, they won’t be able to waver his status. After all, being the first person to clear it is the most difficult,” Professor Gu sighed.

Although Su Yi was also very excited, she felt a little disappointed. She hoped that the person in her heart would be the first to clear the Big Dipper Palaces.

Are pure humans really going to be eliminated by the times??Su Yi sighed inwardly.

Zhou Wen didn’t pay attention to this matter at all. At that moment, he was immersed in Great Brahma’s terrifying abilities.

Great Brahma at the Heaven level was completely different from when it was at the Terror grade. If the Great Brahma in the Terror transformation was a god that took pity on the world, then the present Great Brahma was a god that was disappointed with the world and wanted to destroy the world to cleanse it.

They were both gods, but the two were worlds apart.

Now, not only did Great Brahma possess destructive power, but he could also fuse with Zhou Wen’s body and let him use his strength.

In-game, after the blood-colored avatar fused with Great Brahma, it looked like he was wearing dark-gold armor. It gave off a mysterious and extremely powerful feeling.

In particular, the black hole-like wheel of light behind him made the dark-gold armor appear blurry and illusory as though it didn’t belong to the human world. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Just as he was admiring the powers of Great Brahma from the fusion, his phone suddenly rang.

Zhou Wen took out his phone and saw that it was from Hui Haifeng, who he hadn’t contacted in a long time.

“Junior Brother, what have you been busy with recently? Why didn’t you contact me? Our relationship as fellow disciples can’t just fade away,” Hui Haifeng said with a grin. It was hard to tell that he was already the supreme leader of the Federation.

“Speak your mind.” Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless. Hui Haifeng had thrown Hui Wan at him and now he was doing this.

“What are your thoughts on the matter regarding Karoman?” Hui Haifeng’s tone turned solemn.

“What Karoman?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

“Are you serious? Don’t you know that Karoman has cleared the Big Dipper Palaces?” Hui Haifeng asked doubtfully.

“Someone cleared the Big Dipper Palaces so quickly? I really didn’t know about this and didn’t pay much attention to it. Who’s Karoman?” Zhou Wen asked.

“To think that you are the lord of a city and an overlord of an area now. You don’t even know such a huge matter. What kind of City Lord are you?” Hui Haifeng was somewhat speechless. After a pause, he said, “Karoman is from the Cape family. He’s now the representative of the Sun God Holy Temple. He has just cleared the Big Dipper Palaces. The entire world is filled with news about him.”

“What has this got to do with me?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Of course it has something to do with you. Look at the rankings. The top ten are all representatives of the dimensional races. If this continues, I’m afraid everyone will think that there’s nothing wrong with being ruled by the dimension. In the future, we…”

“Stop. What do you want? Get to the point.” Zhou Wen didn’t have the patience to listen to him reason.

“Junior Brother, as the saying goes, with great strength comes great responsibility. In order to let the citizens of the Federation regain their glory as humans, shouldn’t you show your face on the rankings and let them know that even if you don’t submit to those fellows from the dimension, humans can still become top-notch powerhouses…” Hui Haifeng spoke with emotion and reason, a heartfelt speech.
