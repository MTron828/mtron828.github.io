Chapter 1212: New Mythical Serum

He didn’t dare stay for too long. Since a Calamity-grade creature like Tsukuyomi had appeared, there might be other Calamity-grade existences.

It would be a tragedy if he encountered a Calamity-grade who wanted his life.

Using Singularity Universe, Zhou Wen returned to Earth. The coordinates of his destination were similarly inaccurate, so he didn’t return to Luoyang.

This is... Holy City? Zhou Wen carefully observed his surroundings and realized that he was standing in an alley. People were coming and going on the streets.

He used Truth Listener to scan the area and realized that this was Holy City.

Back then, Wang Mingyuan had used the power of the six Holy Temples to break through the barrier between Earth and the dimension and forced his way into the dimension. At the same time, he nearly destroyed the Holy Land.

This was Holy City, but it was different from the tragic scene back then. Holy City had been rebuilt—although it was slightly smaller than before, it could be considered a medium-sized human city.

However, Holy City’s defensive barrier hadn’t been repaired. It had lost its greatest defense and could only rely on human experts to protect it.

According to what Zhou Wen knew, the federal government led by Hui Haifeng had its headquarters in the Holy Land. Hui Haifeng had chosen this place himself. As for why he didn’t use the former president’s office, the reason wasn’t something Zhou Wen was privy to.

He took out his phone and took a look. It was still downloading, and it didn’t look like it would be done quickly.

Since I’m already here, it won’t be a bad idea to visit Hui Haifeng. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to identify the buildings in Holy City and easily found the building for the president’s office.

However, Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan the interior of the building, hoping to find Hui Haifeng. He teleported over and realized that Truth Listener’s power couldn’t infiltrate the building.

The ring-shaped building was screened by an unknown force. Truth Listener was completely unable to probe the interior.

Interesting. I wonder if it was made by Hui Haifeng or an expert from the Federation. Zhou Wen couldn’t find Hui Haifeng, so after some thought, he gave up on the idea of looking for him.

“What are you doing here?” Just as Zhou Wen was about to teleport away from Holy City, a boy with a backpack walked over. He looked to be about five or six years old. He wore a pair of wide black-framed glasses that covered most of his face.

At that moment, the boy was looking at him in puzzlement, his eyes constantly sizing him up.

“I’m passing by,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Passing by?” The boy looked back at the alley before returning his gaze to Zhou Wen’s face. His expression seemed to say: Are you an idiot?

Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that the alley was a dead end. Furthermore, there was only one house in the entire alley, and there was only one door. Zhou Wen’s excuse of passing by seemed a little forced.

Zhou Wen didn’t mind the details and said with a smile, “I took the wrong path. I’ll leave now.”

“Wait,” the boy said as he placed his backpack on the ground. After opening it, he took out something and threw it at Zhou Wen. “Consider yourself lucky. Take this.”

Zhou Wen caught it and saw that it was a palm-sized crystal bottle with a golden liquid inside.

“What’s this? Why are you giving it to me?” Zhou Wen looked at the golden liquid in the tiny bottle before looking at the boy in puzzlement.

From the looks of it, the boy didn’t seem to be deliberately plotting against him. Ignoring the fact that he wasn’t suitable for such matters at his age, even if someone really wanted to scheme against Zhou Wen, no one knew that he had come to Holy City. It would be impossible for them to plot a scheme against him in advance. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I forgot that ordinary people like you have never seen exclusive Mythical Serums before.” The boy revealed a look of enlightenment before saying to Zhou Wen, “It’s fine if you don’t know what it is. This is Mythical Serum. It’s very high-level and is somewhat different from the ones circulating on the market. Children above the age of three can use it. The effects aren’t as intense as ordinary Mythical Serums. It won’t completely fuse with the consumer from the beginning. There will be a long process. This reduces the burden on your body. The effects of the fusion will be better and it will be more suitable for your body. However, you are a little too old. Even if you use it, the chances of you advancing to the Mythical stage are very slim. I suggest you give it to any children of yours. It’s best if they are between three and six years old. Of course, you can use it yourself. It will still be beneficial.”

With that said, the boy packed his bag and picked it up again before turning to leave.

“Wait.” Zhou Wen found the boy odd. He didn’t know whose child it was.

“Is there something else you don’t understand?” The boy turned around and asked Zhou Wen without any signs of impatience.

“Why are you giving me this Mythical Serum?” Zhou Wen asked as he pointed at the tiny bottle.

The boy didn’t answer him and only asked, “Don’t you want it?”

“No.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

The boy nudged his glasses with his finger and looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. “According to what I know, ordinary Mythical Serum is difficult to find. Many people are fighting to buy a bottle. Such a new Mythical Serum is priceless. Do you really not want it?”

As the boy spoke, he seemed to come to a realization. He looked at Zhou Wen and said, “You don’t have to doubt it. This Mythical Serum is genuine. It’s from the Hui family. Look at the mark at the bottom of the bottle. No one will dare forge the mark of the Hui family in Holy City.”

“Your surname is Hui?” Zhou Wen asked the boy.

“This has nothing to do with you. If you don’t want it, you can return the Mythical Serum to me,” the boy said.

From his expression, Zhou Wen had zero doubts that the boy’s surname was Hui. However, he didn’t know what relationship he had with Hui Haifeng.

“I believe this is a Mythical Serum and I want it. However, I didn’t put in any effort. I can’t take something from others for nothing. If there’s anything you need me to do, we can make a deal. This way, it won’t be me getting it for nothing.” Zhou Wen knew that there had to be a reason for the boy’s odd actions. If he really had something to do with Hui Haifeng, Zhou Wen couldn’t just ignore him.

The boy nodded as though he felt that Zhou Wen’s words made sense. However, he lowered his head and thought for a moment before muttering to himself, “But I don’t have anything I need you to do.”

“Anything is fine. If you have any difficulties, you can tell me,” Zhou Wen said.

The boy shook his head. “If it’s something I find difficult, it’s even more impossible for you to complete.”

Why isn’t this fellow cute at all? He doesn’t sound like a child his age. Zhou Wen was somewhat exasperated.

The boy thought for a moment and said again, “How about this? You can’t do something if it’s too difficult. Lead the way. I’m going to Fireworks Lane to find a woman.”
