Chapter 1432: Eternal Carving on Venus

Translator: CKtalon

The light on the screen suddenly vanished when the sword beam reached its maximum intensity. The humans watching the battle couldn’t adapt to the sudden change in brightness. They took a second to recover their vision.

The scene displayed on the Cube’s screen remained on the area in front of the Golden Palace. However, at that moment, only Human Sovereign stood in front of the Golden Palace with his sword in hand. Xiao was gone; his whereabouts unknown.

Before people could figure out what had happened, whether Human Sovereign had won or not, and where Xiao had gone, the Cube’s countdown came to an end.

The Golden Palace’s door opened as a golden beam instantly shot out almost at the same time.

Boom!

The power of the golden beam reached an unimaginable level as the entire Golden Palace exploded from the golden beam in an instant, turning into countless flying fragments.

It wasn’t just the Golden Palace. All the dimensional zones on Venus exploded as golden beams shot into the sky.

Zhou Wen wanted to teleport away, but before he could use his teleportation ability, the golden beam had already struck him.

The Cube’s screen was completely occupied by the golden light. Then, there was the sound of a terrifying explosion.

The Cube’s screen gradually pulled out from the Venusian dimensional zone. It slowly retreated all the way until the golden blast of light shrank to a point where it couldn’t occupy the entire screen.

Only then could people finally see something. Venus was emitting a terrifying glow, like a huge ball-shaped firework that was spewing energy.

At the instant Zhou Wen was struck by the beam, he believed that he was doomed.

Such terrifying energy was even more terrifying than Xiao’s Calamity Guardian’s self-destruction. Even the Chaos Egg might not be able to withstand it, much less him who had yet to summon it. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yet, Zhou Wen’s body wasn’t injured despite being bathed in the golden beam. The beam’s energy seemed to have its own consciousness as it drilled into the metal ball Zhou Wen had just obtained.

This is the prelude to Venusian Companion Beast’s birth!?Zhou Wen immediately understood what had happened.

From the looks of it, the Venusian Companion Beast had already chosen him as its master. It was now entering his metal ball.

I wonder if the other metal ball still has any use??Zhou Wen recalled that he still had another metal ball. He had obtained it with his identity as Zhou Wen before putting it into the chaos space.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and took out the metal ball. After all, he had heard that all metal balls could hatch Companion Beasts. It apparently needed energy infusion before it could become a true Companion Egg.

Even if this metal ball couldn’t become a true Venusian Companion Beast, it could still receive some remnant energy and hatch an ordinary Companion Beast.

To his surprise, just as Zhou Wen took out the metal ball, the golden energy that had surged into the other metal ball split into two and injected into the two metal balls.

Everyone looked at the scene inside the Cube as Venus constantly spewed out beams of light. There was a sudden boom after a while. The terrifying explosion made their eardrums seem to split open. Many people became deaf temporarily. As for the Cube, it was completely occupied by the golden light produced by the explosion. No one could see anything.

Even without looking at the Cube’s screen, a golden beam of light appeared in the real sky, illuminating the night sky.

After a while, the light in the sky vanished. The Cube’s screen gradually returned to normal. Everyone looked at the screen and realized that Venus was still the same Venus. It didn’t seem to have changed much.

However, when the camera angle in the Cube gradually spun, people saw an unbelievable scene. On the other side of Venus, half the planet had been blasted apart—only half of Venus was left. The other half was riddled with holes like the scene of an apocalypse.

That was all for the Cube as it returned to the ranking board.

The last name lit up like golden flames. It then gradually vanished before returning to nothingness.

The penultimate name lit up next. One after another, the names on the rankings constantly vanished. Finally, when Saint Xiao’s name vanished, only Human Sovereign was left in first place.

The name of Human Sovereign lit up as well, but it didn’t disappear like the other names. It instead grew brighter and bigger before finally occupying the entire screen.

Human Sovereign’s figure appeared on the screen amidst the light.

After that, scenes of Human Sovereign clearing the level appeared. There was also the battle with Xiao. It was also a fast scroll through.

The Cube’s camera gradually zoomed out as the various scenes of Human Sovereign played. The scenes became smaller and smaller until only Human Sovereign’s two golden shimmering names were left.

This name also gradually shrank. At that moment, people realized that the location of the word “Human Sovereign” was within a massive and complicated star chart. The shiny words “Human Sovereign” were placed where Venus was—the name permanently marked on Venus.

The Cube stopped showing any more scenes. The star chart vanished and the screen gradually returned to darkness. Finally, the Cube turned completely black and no longer showed any reaction.

“So Human Sovereign obtained first place after all?”

“That’s no other way about it. Xiao ultimately failed to stop Human Sovereign. My Human Sovereign is indeed invincible.”

“Haha, I knew it. Human Sovereign won’t be defeated.”

“Could Xiao have been killed by Human Sovereign?”

“Most likely. Otherwise, how could Human Sovereign obtain first place?”

“Holy sh*t, will the name Human Sovereign forever represent Venus in the future? This is interesting.”

“In that case, does every planet have something similar? Will we have a chance to mark our names on other stars and planets in the future?”

“Dream on. Even if that’s the case, it won’t be your turn.”

As people discussed, Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn.

He floated in the void and looked at the remaining half of Venus. He thought that if Earth’s Companion Beast were to appear in the future, no one on Earth would be spared.

I definitely can’t let Earth’s Companion Beast appear.?This was the only thought Zhou Wen had.

If Earth was really like Venus, how many people on Earth could survive? It was probably less than ten in a billion.

Zhou Wen held two metal balls that had already transformed into Companion Eggs. Just as he was about to use his phone to see what attributes the two Companion Eggs had, he suddenly saw a galactic behemoth approaching from afar.

The galactic behemoth’s body was transparent as blue light shimmered within.. It was the one Zhou Wen had seen with Tsukuyomi.
