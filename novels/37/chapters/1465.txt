Chapter 1466 Terrifying Humanoid Dimensional Creature

Zhou Wen took out the Immortal Culling Sword as well. He held the Bamboo Blade in one hand and the Immortal Culling Sword in the other as he stared intently at the humanoid dimensional creature.

The humanoid dimensional creature stared at Zhou Wen as it exerted strength in its legs. Instantly, its figure blurred and vanished from Zhou Wen’s sight.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. Without any hesitation, he used instant transmission and headed for the ancient city’s exit.

How terrifying was a speed that even his vision couldn’t keep up?

Just as Zhou Wen finished instant transmission, his heart skipped a beat. He saw the humanoid creature standing in front of him with its nose almost touching his. Its black pupils met Zhou Wen’s pupils as its long gray hair swayed slightly in the wind. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation failed to show an effect? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he quickly retreated. He wanted to simultaneously draw both the Bamboo Blade and Immortal Culling Sword.

There was only one possibility for his opponent to ignore the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. The other party’s strength was enough to tear through the void.

However, before Zhou Wen could draw the saber and sword, the humanoid creature pressed down with both hands and forcefully sheathed the saber and sword back. At the same time, it turned around and kicked Zhou Wen in the chest.

These actions were done in one fell swoop, so fast that Zhou Wen couldn’t react despite seeing him move. His body flew out like a cannonball and slammed into a wall.

Boom!

An ancient building collapsed under Zhou Wen’s weight. Despite having Absolute Defense, his Prisoned Dragon armor had a footprint-shaped hole.

Zhou Wen’s sternum fractured in numerous areas. All his bones seemed to have fallen apart during the collision. If not for the Prisoned Dragon armor’s protection, all his bones would have shattered.

Bang!

Zhou Wen endured the pain from his injuries and instant transmitted away. Almost at the same time, the collapsed building was blasted apart by a terrifying force.

Zhou Wen ducked left the moment he finished instant transmission. At the same time, he pointed an ancient mirror at the spot where he had appeared, shooting out rainbow beams.

The humanoid creature was already there as expected. At such a close distance and with the Soul Mirror’s mirror beam traveling at the speed of light, the humanoid creature’s reaction time was minute, almost negligiblein theory.

Despite being so close, the humanoid creature managed to react. Its figure blurred in Zhou Wen’s vision as it dodged the Soul Mirror’s Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light.

Without waiting for the Soul Mirror’s divine light to stop, Zhou Wen used instant transmission. He knew that he was in deep sh*t.

To be able to dodge the Soul Mirror’s light at such a distance meant that he was at least at the Hell level or above. He might even be at the Heaven Realm.

What was even more terrifying was that the other party’s strength came from the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. It was unadulterated physical strength. To be able to cultivate his body to such a level, be it speed or strength, was not something Zhou Wen could match.

Bang!

Zhou Wen wanted to follow up his instant transmission with another. The gap between them wasn’t even a tenth of a second, but in that split second, he was grabbed by the humanoid creature and punched in the face.

Half of the Prisoned Dragon helmet cratered in, along with half of Zhou Wen’s face as his body flew to the side.

In midair, before Zhou Wen even slammed into the wall, the humanoid creature appeared in front of him again and kicked his head.

Half of Zhou Wen’s face was deformed as his cheekbones collapsed. His head had been severely injured and the other party’s speed was very fast, but Zhou Wen ultimately reacted. When he was in midair, he used another instant transmission.

Clang!

The humanoid creature had already sent a punch over the moment he phased into existence, giving him no chance to dodge. However, Zhou Wen crossed his saber and sword and blocked the incoming punch.

Unfortunately, the humanoid creature had immense strength. The saber and sword slammed into Zhou Wen’s chest, sending him flying. He lost his grip on the saber and sword as they fell. Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to draw them out of their scabbards. Otherwise, the saber and sword would have sliced him apart. He might have been diced to pieces.

“Come out!” Zhou Wen summoned a Golden Battle God and shielded himself.

Indeed, the humanoid creature had already arrived behind him and struck at the Golden Battle God. The Terror-grade Golden Battle God was shattered by his strike as his palm continued in its trajectory towards Zhou Wen’s back.

Using the instant he won from sacrificing the Golden Battle God, Zhou Wen finally instant transmitted out again. The Soul Mirror he had thrown into the air also shot out the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light at the humanoid creature.

It was useless. His speed was too fast. The Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light couldn’t keep up with him.

The humanoid figure flashed behind the Soul Mirror and threw a punch at it.

With the strength of his fist, even the Soul Mirror probably couldn’t withstand it. Thankfully, Zhou Wen had expected this and had already unsummoned the Soul Mirror ahead of time. When his fist struck down, the Soul Mirror transformed into a stream of light that returned to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen immediately summoned it again. He held the Soul Mirror with both hands and activated the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light.

The four types of divine light traveled at the speed of light. In theory, their speeds were the same, but Zhou Wen felt that the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light was clearly faster than the other three types of divine light.

Zhou Wen directed the Soul Mirror to emit divine light in the direction where the humanoid creature wasn’t standing, but when the divine light shot out, the humanoid creature appeared in its path.

Success! Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw that he had successfully predicted the humanoid creature’s movement.

If the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light could store the humanoid creature in the Soul Mirror, his life would be saved.

However, when the Soul-Illuminating Divine Light shone on the humanoid creature, he only paused for a moment before immediately rushing out of its range. What the hell is this fellow? Why would such a creature appear in Guide Ancient City? Zhou Wen didn’t just want to vomit blood-in fact, blood kept gushing out of his mouth as half his face was mangled. He threw out the Soul Mirror with his left hand and grabbed the Immortal Culling Sword with his right hand. Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen pulled out the Immortal Culling Sword and slashed backwards with Immortal Slaying.

The humanoid creature was indeed there. When it saw Zhou Wen slash at it, it didn’t dodge. It extended its hand and grabbed at the Immortal Culling Sword.

Crack!

The sword beam shattered like glass. The humanoid creature’s palm grabbed the Immortal Culling Sword’s blade without suffering any damage.

It’s over! Just as Zhou Wen had this thought, he felt an unstoppable force coming from the hilt.

Boom!

Zhou Wen’s body was thrown into the air and smashed into the ground, shattering the stone slabs there. The stone fragments mixed with the armor fragments flew up. As for Zhou Wen who was spitting out blood, his eyes were bloodshot as his body rapidly plummeted into the ground.
