Chapter 1351: Give It to Them If They Want It

Translator: CKtalon

The Calamity-grade bullet sounded as Zhou Wen dodged it without any suspense.

Just like last time, none of the bullets could touch Zhou Wen’s body. The seventh sure-kill bullet could only fly around him.

When Zhou Wen dodged the first round of bullets, An Jing didn’t immediately rush out.

An ancient bow appeared in her hand as she aimed at one of the doors. The arrow that shot out was actually connected to a thin thread. The other end of the thread was in An Jing’s hand.

After the arrow flew out, it immediately pulled An Jing’s body out as she instantly disappeared through the door.

The arrow’s speed had almost reached the limits of the Mythical stage. It was even close to the Terror grade.

What was even stranger was that the arrow could actually turn by itself. It flew through the maze-like passage like lightning, but it did not touch any walls.

Only one sure-kill bullet appeared around Zhou Wen. Just as the second round’s sure-kill bullet was about to be fired, An Jing had already arrived in front of the Golden Palace.

Landing in front of the Golden Palace, An Jing exerted force with her fingers and the bow returned to her hand.

The Golden Palace’s door opened as a metal ball flew out and landed in An Jing’s hand.

The scene switched back to the rankings. The name of ‘Sunset Army’ appeared on the rankings. Just like the Federation Suicide Squad, it had three stars.

However, despite having the same three stars, the Sunset Army was actually ranked ahead of the Federation Suicide Squad.

It was obvious that the Cube’s main evaluation criterion was still Zhou Wen. However, An Jing’s performance also played a significant supporting role. Therefore, they were awarded three stars overall, but their ranking was ahead of the Federation Suicide Squad.

Ordinary people weren’t in the mood to care about this. They only felt that Zhou Wen had crossed the line; he was even worse than Deceit King.

At least Deceit King put in some effort to snatch the loot.

However, Zhou Wen only needed to take one trip to reach the rankings. Not only did he obtain a Venusian Companion Egg, but he could also receive a private carry fee. It was like doing a zero capital business to the extreme.

When the various factions saw Zhou Wen pull off this stunt, they were envious and depressed.

“Investigate. We have to investigate how Zhou Wen dodged the Calamity-grade bullet. It must be a special Companion Beast’s ability.” An old woman from the Cape family stared at the screen and repeatedly watched the video of Zhou Wen dodging the Calamity-grade bullet.

“We have to figure out what Companion Beast Zhou Wen’s clothes are.” A similar order sounded in the Family Clan of Gods.

It wasn’t just the six families. Even the League of Guardians was studying what Companion Beasts Zhou Wen had on him to achieve such an effect. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

They could tell that Zhou Wen’s ability was definitely related to the clothes. However, no one knew what kind of Companion Beast the clothes were.

Few people had been to Netherworld City, and even fewer could enter the Six Realms. Apart from Zhou Wen and company, only Xiao and the other two Saints had entered. However, they had not entered the Devas Realm and had not obtained the Heavenly Robe.

After this battle, Luoyang became even more chaotic. All kinds of methods, both done in the open and in the dark, kept Overseer Manor busy.

Thankfully, An Tianzuo had already done a purge before he left. It wasn’t easy to find new spies to infiltrate the Overseer Manor. Most people could only think of solutions from the periphery.

“How many has it been today?” Zhou Wen asked as he looked at the intruder he had just captured.

“It’s the eleventh one. From the looks of it, they are determined. No matter what, they have to figure out your mojo, Young Master,” An Sheng said.

“It appears we need to have a solution. Otherwise, trouble will keep coming,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“If it’s Overseer, he will teach them a lesson they will remember and make them not dare to be so brazen,” An Sheng said.

“Unfortunately, I’m not An Tianzuo. How about this? Spread the word that I want to sell the Heavenly Robe Companion Beast that can dodge the Calamity-grade bullets,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“Are you really selling it?” An Sheng was somewhat surprised. After all, with such a Companion Beast in hand, no one would be willing to sell it. The benefits involved were too great.

“That’s right. Since they want it so much, I’ll give it to them. I don’t want them to keep bothering me.” Zhou Wen smiled and continued, “However, I still need you to do this. You have to make them beg to buy it. You can’t drop the price.”

An Sheng understood and asked softly, “Young Master Wen, is there something wrong with the Heavenly Robe?”

“Would I sell it to them if there was no problem?” Zhou Wen told An Sheng that the Heavenly Robe needed to synergize with a Luck Companion Beast.

“Although Luck Companion Beasts are very rare, those large factions can still obtain some… What if…” An Sheng was somewhat worried.

“Don’t worry. They definitely won’t be able to gather Luck Companion Beasts that allow a 100% evasion rate.” Zhou Wen knew very well that without Wang Lu’s Invincible Lucky Star, there was no 100% chance. It was useless even if one obtained more ordinary Lucky Companion Beasts. No matter how high the chance was, it wasn’t 100%.

One had to use the Invincible Lucky Star’s Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and Terror transformation to achieve a 100% evasion rate.

Zhou Wen had tried it in-game. If he didn’t activate its Terror transformation, or if he didn’t use its Life Soul or Wheel of Destiny, there would be flaws. There was also a chance of dodging the Calamity-grade bullet, but even if he dodged the seventh sure-kill bullet at the beginning, there was still a chance of being hit later. It wouldn’t keep circling around, and it was only a matter of time before the target was hit.

Even if they could gather a high-luck Companion Beast, it was impossible for them to constantly dodge the sure-kill bullets.

“Young Master, it’s good that you’re confident. Leave this to me…” An Sheng’s lips curled up slightly as though he was a devil who had found his prey.

While An Sheng was handling this matter, Zhou Wen took the time to visit the Wang family to return the Invincible Lucky Star to Wang Lu.

Sweetie had been following Zhou Wen all this while, hoping to find an opportunity to figure out where Zhou Wen’s candy box had come from. However, after Zhou Wen returned to the Overseer Manor, there were many people following him. Sweetie failed to find an opportunity to approach him.

Finally, when Zhou Wen came out of the Overseer Manor alone, Sweetie immediately followed him as she planned on how to approach him.

It wasn’t difficult for Sweetie to kill Zhou Wen. The difficult part was getting the answer she wanted.

Zhou Wen carried out instant transmission constantly. As he wanted to rush back to the An family as soon as possible, he didn’t rest at all. Sweetie failed to find an opportunity as a result.

When he arrived at the Wang family residence, Zhou Wen teleported to Wang Lu’s building. Wang Lu, who had already received Zhou Wen’s message, opened the door and let Zhou Wen enter before closing it.

What’s he doing??Sweetie followed curiously.. Like a ghost, she passed through the wall and arrived beside Zhou Wen and Wang Lu.
