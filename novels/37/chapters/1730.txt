Chapter 1731 Too Late

He couldn’t block it. He couldn’t block the woman’s attack at all.

What Zhou Wen believed to be a perfect setup and move appeared full of flaws in front of the woman. It forced Zhou Wen to pay a certain price to block her attacks.

The immortal sword in his hand that could resist the Nihility Sword Aura failed to touch the Nihility Sword Aura in the woman’s hand.

This pressure made Zhou Wen recall the word “dimensional-lowering strike.” Many of the woman’s means exceeded Zhou Wen’s understanding

The woman’s words were very arrogant, but she did have the right to be arrogant. The difference in knowledge was indeed huge.

I can’t take it anymore. If this continues, I won’t be able to last until the Teacher Domain finishes analyzing the Nihility Sword Aura. Zhou Wen’s injuries increased as his heart turned colder.

The woman was like an omnipotent god. No matter how Zhou Wen’s strength and technique changed, she seemed to be able to see through everything and crack Zhou Wen’s painstaking setup.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to be struck by the Nihility Sword Aura again, his figure suddenly vanished and appeared on the other side of the mountaintop.

The woman was slightly taken aback. This time, she hadn’t expected Zhou Wen’s location of appearance, nor did she manage to attack immediately.

“Five Elements As One Escape technique?” The woman frowned slightly as she looked at the grass fruit baby on Zhou Wen’s shoulder.

Zhou Wen secretly cheered inwardly. If he hadn’t dodged the strike, one of his arms would have been severed.

Now, Zhou Wen was secretly glad that he had brought the grass fruit baby with him. It was the grass fruit baby who had used an escape technique to help him escape the strike.

When the woman attacked again, Zhou Wen could only continue fighting to the death. The grass fruit baby occasionally used an escape technique to help him, but it was only once in a while. It didn’t use an escape technique to help Zhou Wen escape every time.

Zhou Wen understood why the grass fruit baby hadn’t been using an escape technique to help him. It wasn’t that the grass fruit baby was unwilling, nor was it that it lacked strength.

The real reason was the woman. This was because after the grass fruit baby used several escape techniques to help Zhou Wen escape, the woman’s prediction of where Zhou Wen would appear became closer and closer to where he appeared. It was only a matter of time before she could accurately predict his location. Furthermore, it wouldn’t take long.

“There aren’t many people in the dimension who know an escape technique that combines the five elements. However, in front of me, it’s just a tiny trick,” the woman said as she slashed out.

Zhou Wen, who had just escaped in a sorry state, found a bone-deep gash appear on his chest.

Zhou Wen knew that the woman had completely seen through the grass fruit baby’s escape technique. If the grass fruit baby used the escape technique to help him, he would probably be killed the moment he phased into existence.

I can’t dodge anymore. Zhou Wen stopped his fast-moving footsteps and stared intently at the woman’s feet with a heavy mood.

Although there were many changes to the sword technique, no matter how he stabbed and slashed, the final path to attack Zhou Wen was the same. What was truly unpredictable was the woman’s movement technique.

As long as he could predict the woman’s trajectory, it would be much easier to use the immortal sword to block the Nihility Sword Aura.

After suffering so many strikes and watching for so long, Zhou Wen already had a general idea of the woman’s movement technique, but he wasn’t sure if he could block it.

“Are you giving up so quickly?” the woman said coldly without stopping. Her graceful figure instantly appeared in front of Zhou Wen as she slashed at him with the Nihility Sword Aura.

Zhou Wen didn’t retreat as though he had seen an opportunity. The immortal sword in his right hand slashed in a direction.

“It’s over. How can you predict an immortal technique?” Amidst the woman’s teasing, the immortal sword missed as the Nihility Sword Aura slashed at Zhou Wen’s neck from the other side.

The woman believed that she would definitely be able to kill Zhou Wen this time. At such a close distance, even an escape technique wouldn’t be able to help Zhou Wen escape. And the hand without the immortal sword couldn’t withstand the full-powered slash of the Nihility Sword Aura with Great Brahma’s strength alone.

Crack!

A noise that sounded like glass shattering sounded beside Zhou Wen. The Immortal Culling Sword appeared in Zhou Wen’s left hand as the blade blocked his neck, forcefully slicing through the Nihility Sword Aura.

“This sword... So you are Human Sovereign...” The woman immediately recognized the Immortal Culling Sword.

“I wouldn’t dare call myself Human Sovereign. I’m just one of many lives.” Zhou Wen held the immortal sword in one hand and the Immortal Culling Sword in the other as he stared intently at the woman’s footsteps.

“Alright, it’s time for me to eliminate this calamity for my Immortals.” The woman moved again like a fairy, making it impossible to tell her intended direction. The Nihility Sword Aura had already arrived in front of Zhou Wen.

The Nihility Sword Aura was formless to begin with. Coupled with such unpredictable movement techniques, if it were an ordinary Calamity-grade creature, they probably wouldn’t even be able to see where the sword aura was, much less withstand it.

However, Zhou Wen only had one belief in mind. No matter what, he had no other choice but to believe in his analysis and judgment.

Clang!

The Immortal Culling Sword missed, but the immortal sword struck the Nihility Sword Aura again, resolving the calamity of death.

The woman frowned slightly. This was the second time Zhou Wen had blocked her attack.

Zhou Wen couldn’t completely predict her behavior, so he prepared two sets of actions every time. The sword in one hand was both a prediction and a type of sealing.

If his prediction was correct, he would naturally be able to block the Nihility Sword Aura. If his judgment was wrong, he could also seal the area, shrinking the area that the woman could attack. It made things more predictable.

This method wasn’t smart, but without powerful calculating and multitasking abilities, it was impossible.

The woman didn’t seem to believe that Zhou Wen could really block her attacks as she attacked again and again.

Zhou Wen used both swords in unison and blocked the woman’s attacks again and again. Although there were times when his judgment was wrong and he was injured by the woman, the injuries weren’t fatal.

In fact, this was also a deliberate act on Zhou Wen’s part. When he couldn’t make a confident judgment, he chose to seal off the routes of certain fatal trajectories, preventing the Nihility Sword Aura from killing him.

“As expected of the strongest human. You are indeed capable, but multitasking is too ordinary among the Immortals.” As the woman spoke, she condensed the Nihility Sword Aura in her other hand, planning on using the two swords to fend off Zhou Wen’s two swords.

“It’s too late.” Zhou Wen looked at the woman as a smile surfaced over his lips.

If the woman had used two swords from the beginning, it wouldn’t have been difficult to crack his dual swords, but things were different now. After so many rounds of clashing, Zhou Wen was completely familiar with the woman’s behavior.

Just as the woman had said, there was no true One Essence of Chaos in the world. Similarly, there was no true fixed form. Anyone, even an Immortal, had their own behavioral rules.

However, the woman’s movement technique was varied, so much so that it looked irregular. However, just because it didn’t look regular didn’t mean it wasn’t regular.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
