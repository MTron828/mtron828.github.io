Chapter 1207: Human Sovereign

Every compromise, every concession, every act of tolerance in the past—the reasons that seemed imposing to him in the past—appeared pathetic and laughable when he recalled them.

Life is long, but it doesn’t regress. No matter how ridiculous the things you wish to pursue today are, it will only be meaningful if you do it today. If you miss this day, even if there are countless tomorrows in the future, you won’t gain the satisfaction you get today... The glow over Zhou Wen had completely vanished. He didn’t seem to have the god-like halo of a sovereign, but there was an indescribable aura over him.

Perhaps they might be very humble and laughable, but that’s what I only want to do today. I only live in the now, not tomorrow. Zhou Wen’s eyes gradually became firm as the Ancient Sovereign in his body produced a strange resonance.

On the Wheel of Destiny, the mark that belonged to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra became more and more resplendent. It nearly illuminated the entire Wheel of Destiny space, but Zhou Wen’s body didn’t emit any light that could be seen with the naked eye.

Zhou Wen’s body didn’t vanish. An Sheng and company could still see him, but Zhou Wen knew that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra had completed its Terror transformation.

Some Terror forms were invisible to others. Or rather, some powers weren’t something humans could see with their naked eyes.

If Zhou Wen had only understood the Ancient Sovereign’s superficialities in the past, he now grasped the Ancient Sovereign’s spirit.

The Asura slashed out again. This time, Zhou Wen didn’t let Great Brahma stop him. He even unsummoned Great Brahma and allowed the Asura to charge at him.

The bizarre Asura Saber came with a monstrous demonic aura. However, from Zhou Wen’s point of view, the Asura wasn’t as ferocious and terrifying as before. It could even be said to be fun.

When one’s heart had no fear, there would no longer be any fear in the world. Even when facing death, fear was something that only brushed past.

At the instant the Asura Saber slashed in front of Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen finally moved. He extended his bare hand and grabbed the Asura Saber.

The sharp blade sliced into his palm as blood flowed out and stained the blade. The Terror-form Asura Saber lost its Terror powers and gradually appeared in An Sheng and company’s eyes.

It wasn’t just Asura Saber. The Asura, who was holding the Asura Saber, also slowly regressed from his Terror form, allowing everyone to see him.

After losing his Terror transformation powers, although the Asura was still at the Terror grade, his stats dropped drastically in every aspect—it was no longer as powerful and invincible as before.

Crack!

Zhou Wen’s palm snapped the Asura Saber and punched the Asura.

The powerful Asura was sent flying by Zhou Wen’s punch. His chest exploded as his body flew out like a cannonball and slammed into the Asura altar. His body shattered into pieces as blood and bones splattered across the ground.

Ouyang Lan and company looked at Zhou Wen in a daze. Although there was no divine light or glorious brilliance, his figure was even more shocking.

The wise man’s saying is right: All demons and ghosts are paper tigers that can’t withstand a single blow. Zhou Wen sighed and retracted his fist, having the melancholic feeling of loneliness by being at the very top.

However, in the next second, the Asura that Zhou Wen had blasted apart instantly recovered under the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. He condensed his body again without any injuries.

Holy sh*t... Zhou Wen nearly staggered and fell from the sky. After all this time, the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra couldn’t really injure anyone. He had already forgotten about it.

Seeing the Asura charge over again, Zhou Wen felt so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.

A certain part of his body emitted heat as Demonic Neonate rushed out. The demonic sword in her arms automatically unsheathed and instantly penetrated the Asura’s heart.

In the next second, the demonic aura over the Asura’s body was crazily devoured by the demonic sword. In the blink of an eye, it was completely devoured. Only a skill crystal and a stat crystal dropped.

After the demonic sword devoured the Asura, it circled around and returned to the scabbard in Demonic Neonate’s arms. Then, Demonic Neonate automatically returned to his body and transformed into a tattoo.

What’s going on? That’s it? Zhou Wen was still stunned.

He had gone through all the trouble only to have Demonic Neonate kill the Asura with a single strike. This was completely different from his expectations.

“Eh... Young Master Wen, why don’t we head back now?” An Sheng ran over and picked up the skill crystal and stat crystal dropped by the Asura before handing them to the stunned Zhou Wen.

“Ahem, alright. Let’s head back.” Zhou Wen coughed lightly and accepted the skill crystal and stat crystal.

“Sis Lan, how did you pass Netherworld City and the Bridge of Helplessness?” Zhou Wen asked on the way back.

Without suffering all the punishments of Netherworld City, it was impossible for them to reach the Bridge of Helplessness. They wouldn’t be able to leave their names on the Three-Lives Stone and retain their memories to enter the six realms of rebirth and existence.

It was understandable that one or two of Ouyang Lan’s entourage were special. However, Zhou Wen found it unbelievable that all of them were special.

“We aren’t very sure either. After we were forced into Netherworld City by them, we were captured and knocked unconscious. When we woke up, we were already tied to the altar,” Ouyang Lan said.

“So entering the Asura Realm wasn’t your choice?” Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn.

Xiao and company could even determine which path An Tianzuo would choose, so it was obvious that they knew the An family like the back of their hands. Such an enemy made one shudder.

On the way back, Zhou Wen stole a glance at the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s Terror transformation information on his phone.

Terror transformation: Human Sovereign (S-grade)

It was very simple. Even the word ‘primordial’ had been dropped. It felt like it was regressing.

Demon God Body, Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, Godfiend Era, Singularity Universe, Great Brahma, Sword Pill, and Human Sovereign. Only the Chaos Egg and Slaughterer haven’t undergone Terror transformation. The path to advancing to the Terror grade shouldn’t be far for me, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

After walking off the Bridge of Helplessness, he saw An Tianzuo sitting there. An officer was treating his severed arm, but it didn’t seem to be effective.

Regeneration of severed limbs wasn’t easy for ordinary people, but not for a person like An Tianzuo who had all sorts of officers with him. There were also many who had healing abilities, so it wouldn’t be difficult for him to regrow the severed limb.

However, when such power was used on An Tianzuo, it didn’t seem to be effective. Although the wound had healed, he couldn’t regrow his severed arm.

“Young Master Wen, don’t you have a healing ability? Why don’t you treat the Overseer?” An Sheng handed the arm he had picked up to Zhou Wen.

“There’s no need,” An Tianzuo said directly before Zhou Wen could say a word. His tone was firm, without any intention of it just being an act of politeness.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
