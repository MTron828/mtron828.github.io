Chapter 1391: The Disqualified

Translator: CKtalon

Perfect Sword Immortal was severely injured by the Immortal Culling Sword. Although Jiang Yan’s body was also injured, it wasn’t as serious as Perfect Sword Immortal, nor did he suffer from constant damage.

Under such circumstances, he finally regained control of most of his body. At the same time, Fairy Burial, who had fused with the Skyimmortal armor, crazily plundered and absorbed Perfect Sword Immortal’s energy.

Facing the pincer attack of the Immortal Culling Sword and Fairy Burial, Perfect Sword Immortal lost his voice bit by bit amidst the painful roars. Finally, he was completely absorbed by Fairy Burial.

The floral armor on Jiang Yan’s body was red to the point of turning purple. It was extremely beautiful, like red spider lilies that had fallen into hell.

Jiang Yan reached out to grab the hilt of Fairy Burial and pulled it out of his body before throwing it back to Zhou Wen.

“You came too early. If you had given me more time for preparations, I wouldn’t be in such a sorry state.” Jiang Yan looked at the wound on his body. The blood armor seemed to have a life of its own as it rooted itself in the wound and quickly healed his injured body.

“You didn’t inform me. How would I know what you were up to?” Zhou Wen rolled his eyes.

“If I had told you in advance, even if you could fool everyone, I wouldn’t be able to fool Perfect Sword Immortal who possessed me. Only when everything is real can Perfect Sword Immortal sink deeper and not have the chance to escape again,” Jiang Yan said with a smile. “Thankfully, you didn’t disappoint me. Although there were some tiny mishaps, the goal was finally achieved.”

“My heart isn’t too good. Please get someone else if you are doing this again,” Zhou Wen said angrily.

“I wasn’t the one looking for you, alright? You came knocking by yourself!” Jiang Yan said with a smile.

Zhou Wen was taken aback, but he knew that what Jiang Yan said made sense. Jiang Yan was only taking advantage of the situation. Even without Jiang Yan, the League of Guardians would still deal with him. A figure like Perfect Sword Immortal would still descend. It was only a matter of time.

“What plans do you have for the future?” Zhou Wen released Cave Era and asked Jiang Yan.

“I’m the owner of the League of Guardians. I was in the past and will be in the future.” Jiang Yan looked at Uesugi Nao, Blood Shaman, and the other Guardians.

Uesugi Nao, Blood Shaman, and the other Guardians flew over and said in unison, “We are willing to continue following you, Your Excellency.”

“Aren’t you afraid that the dimensional fellows will deal with you?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I was afraid in the past, but now that my Skyimmortal and Fairy Burial have advanced to the Calamity grade, there’s no need to be afraid. It’s not that easy for dimensional creatures to come to Earth. Even if they do, they will be greatly suppressed. Up to now, only humans can allow Calamity-grade creatures to exist on Earth. They can’t even send Calamity-grade creatures over. Even if they descend with the help of a body, they will at most be at the Calamity grade. Do you think I need to be afraid?” Jiang Yan said.

“Alright, take care. Goodbye… No… There’s nothing good about it. It’s best we don’t meet again…” Zhou Wen waved his hand and prepared to leave.

“Do you want me to help you finish that?” Jiang Yan pointed at Zhou Wen.

“What?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He looked down and realized that the Heavenly Tribulation Sword he had been hit with was still embedded in his chest. It was still emitting lightning.

“Well, if you hadn’t mentioned it, I would have forgotten. This thing can’t really injure people. I wonder how Perfect Sword Immortal managed to master such a useless skill.” Zhou Wen felt that although the Heavenly Tribulation was still ongoing, it didn’t affect him much. He had already forgotten about it as he was focused on the battle. It was obvious how useless the Heavenly Tribulation Sword was to Zhou Wen.

Jiang Yan glanced at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression. He had absorbed Perfect Sword Immortal, so he knew some of his abilities. The Heavenly Tribulation Sword’s attack wasn’t targeted at the body, but the mind. Under the nine instances of Heavenly Tribulation, even a Calamity-grade creature would most likely become an idiot or lunatic. They might even be erased or turned into a vegetative state. There were many who couldn’t withstand it and committed suicide.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t react to the nine tribulations of the Heavenly Tribulation Sword. Others didn’t know how terrifying it was, but Jiang Yan knew very well that this wasn’t a reaction a human should have.

It’s no wonder Teacher said that about him, Jiang Yan thought.

“I’m leaving.” Zhou Wen waved his hand and turned to leave. He didn’t get Jiang Yan to help him pull out the Heavenly Tribulation Sword. After advancing to the Terror grade, his understanding of various powers had improved significantly. He knew that the Heavenly Tribulation Sword would quickly dissipate.

After using teleportation to leave, with the augmentation of his Terror state, Singularity Universe’s location-locking was much more accurate. Zhou Wen teleported to the vicinity of Luoyang, and the deviation was only about five kilometers. It was much better than before.

When he arrived at an empty spot, Zhou Wen eagerly took out his phone and checked his stats.

Zhou Wen: Terror

Life Providence: Sigh of the King

Life Soul: Slaughterer

Wheel of Destiny: No Engravings (One Spin)

Terror Form: The Disqualified (Beyond S)

Strength: 82

…

Zhou Wen looked at his information and fell into a daze.

He originally imagined that his Terror grade was the upgraded version of Slaughterer, but from the looks of it, that wasn’t the case. Slaughterer had indeed undergone Terror transformation, and its name was Slaughterer. Like the other eight Terror transformation abilities, it had an S-grade Terror transformation ability.

However, Zhou Wen’s true Terror transformation ability wasn’t Slaughterer, but The Disqualified. Although it had a certain relationship with Slaughterer, it was somewhat different.

After Zhou Wen entered The Disqualified state, he gained an extremely powerful augmentation for the other nine Terror states. He also had the ability to spy on weaknesses like before. However, this ability wasn’t constant. It varied according to the different target creatures.

This ability was relatively powerful for common lifeforms. The effects on rare creatures would be weaker, but it wasn’t completely ineffective.

Apart from that, The Disqualified had a very strong augmentation on various parts of his physique, including his senses. Otherwise, even if Zhou Wen’s strength could keep up with Perfect Sword Immortal in battle, his eyesight and reaction would be far inferior—it would still be difficult for him to match him.

In fact, Zhou Wen’s various abilities were very close to the Calamity grade in The Disqualified state.

Zhou Wen still needed to continue studying the other abilities of The Disqualified. After all, he had just condensed it, so he didn’t understand it fully.

Zhou Wen pulled out Tyrant Behemoth’s information, hoping to see how far it had advanced.

Tyrant Behemoth: Terror (Evolvable)

Life Providence: Extreme Strength

Life Soul: Violent Crown

Wheel of Destiny: Absolute Strength

Terror Form: Tyrant

Strength: 82

Speed: 82

Constitution: 82

Essence Energy: 82

Talent Skill: Mountain Consuming

Companion Form: Boxing Glove Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He switched on his phone and randomly chose a dungeon.. Zhou Wen wanted to see what changes Tyrant Behemoth would undergo when it entered its Terror form.
