Chapter 802: Growing Flesh

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen thought to himself, This Xiao Tianfang sure is greedy. He’s already eyeing the Gu pot.

However, this was exactly what Zhou Wen wanted. Zhou Wen said indifferently, “It’s just a Gu pot. I have plenty of them. It’s nothing. Just take it back. There’s no need to return it.”

“Elder Zhou, are you serious?” Xiao Tianfang was overjoyed. He even had the urge to kneel and kowtow to Zhou Wen.

“The premise is that your Kuman Nee is really the reincarnation of the Gu God. If I discover anything amiss, I’m afraid your Xiao family won’t be able to remain safe, much less continue possessing the Ice Silkworms and Gu pot,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

Xiao Tianfang was alarmed. The joy in his heart subsided a little as he said solemnly, “Don’t worry. This Kuman Nee is definitely refined from the Gu God’s reincarnation. Furthermore, it was personally refined by me. There’s no mistake. If I lied, I’m willing to have ten thousand Gu drill through my heart.”

Xiao Tianfang swore and told the truth.

“Then I’m relieved. Unlock her Intrinsic Lock,” Zhou Wen said.

“Do I do it directly? Do you want me to transfer the Intrinsic Lock directly to you?” Xiao Tianfang asked in puzzlement.

“There’s no need. If I can’t even suppress a Mythical Kuman Nee, I would have wasted all my years studying Kuman Thong,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“Alright.” Xiao Tianfang felt that Zhou Wen was indeed a big shot. He didn’t even think much of the Mythical Kuman Nee. It was no wonder he could be Worm Dugu’s uncle-master.

Thinking of how Zhou Wen could easily subdue the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings, he didn’t hesitate any further.

He handed the Kuman Nee to Zhou Wen and took out a pouch. Holding it, he bit his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood onto it.

The moment his blood touched the pouch, the pouch burst into flames. As the pouch was destroyed, the Kuman Nee in Zhou Wen’s hand trembled.

Xiao Tianfang’s expression turned nasty as well. His face was pale as cold sweat instantly covered his forehead. He looked to be in extreme pain.

Zhou Wen had consulted Gu Shanshui and knew that this Intrinsic Lock connected Kuman Nee to his life. If it was removed, it would also cause great damage to him.

Xiao Tianfang was willing to release the Intrinsic Lock likely because he was unable to completely control Gu Lady. Instead, he had suffered a backlash from Gu Lady’s power. He had been tormented over the years.

Now that he could finally be liberated of Gu Lady, he was even more eager than Zhou Wen.

With the two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings and the Gu pot, the Xiao family’s future would definitely be better than before. The pain of Gu Lady’s backlash would also be a thing of the past.

Crack!

After the pouch was completely burned, something on Kuman Nee’s skull seemed to shatter. Zhou Wen took a look and saw a drop of blood seeping out from the top of the skull.

Xiao Tianfang let out a cry and spat out a mouthful of blood. It looked like his injuries weren’t light.

“Elder Zhou, quickly suppress Kuman Nee. Don’t let her escape,” Xiao Tianfang said as he endured the pain. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He wasn’t afraid that Gu Lady would escape. After all, he had already sold her to Zhou Wen. It didn’t matter if she ran or not. He was just afraid that she would find trouble with him.

“The deal is closed. It’s time for me to leave.” Zhou Wen grabbed the Kuman Nee and injected a stream of Essence Energy into her. Kuman Nee was immediately enveloped by Essence Energy before he placed her in the bag and stood up.

“Someone, take Elder Zhou back.” Xiao Tianfang called for someone and said, “Elder Zhou, take care. I’m not feeling well, so I won’t be sending you off.”

“Recuperate well. You are quite injured after breaking the Intrinsic Lock.” With that said, Zhou Wen left with the Kuman Nee.

Xiao Liuqi came over and asked nervously and excitedly, “Tianfang, did we really close the deal? Did we really exchange for the two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings?”

“Yes. It’s those two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings without a doubt. There’s still the mark we left on them. There’s no mistake.” Xiao Tianfang was also very excited. “That Elder Zhou doesn’t know that there’s something wrong with Gu Lady and thinks that he got the better deal. Now that we have two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings, and I’ve removed the backlash from my body, the two of us will each have one Ice Silkworm Gu King. In two to three years, after we tame them, our Xiao family will have a chance to advance further. By the way, look at this Gu pot. It’s an amazing Gu pot.”

Xiao Tianfang opened the Gu pot and showed Xiao Liuqi see the Ice Silkworms. He even demonstrated the functions of the Gu pot.

“Elder Zhou casually gave us such a treasure. What a fool,” Xiao Liuqi sighed.

Zhou Wen had already walked far away, but Truth Listener still allowed him to hear the conversation between the two brothers clearly. He couldn’t help but sneer inwardly. I wonder who’s the fool.

Gu Lady could easily make the Ice Silkworms obey her orders, making her a truly terrifying existence. The Xiao brothers didn’t know the precious treasure they had and imagined that they got the better deal from exchanging two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings.

As for the so-called treasure Gu pot, although it was indeed extraordinary, it was impossible to restrain the Ice Silkworm Gu Kings.

The reason they obediently remained inside was that Gu Lady was making them cooperate. Otherwise, they would have long rushed out.

The Xiao brothers treated them as treasures, but they didn’t know that they would be taking their lives.

After Gu Lady obtained freedom, she wanted to attack the Xiao brothers, but Zhou Wen held her Kuman Nee down, preventing her from taking revenge.

After all, Zhou Wen was trading with the Xiao brothers in the name of the Dugu family. If he killed them now, it wouldn’t be good for the Dugu family’s reputation.

Worm Dugu had already helped him in the act, so he didn’t want to implicate the Dugu family.

“There’s no rush. You are already free. There are still two Ice Silkworm Gu Kings by their side. Are you still afraid of not getting your revenge?” Zhou Wen touched the agitated Kuman Nee in his backpack and whispered.

The Kuman Nee slowly calmed down. After the Intrinsic Lock was removed, Gu Lady entered the Kuman Nee.

Previously, due to the restriction of the Intrinsic Lock, she couldn’t even return to her body. She could only listen to Xiao Tianfang’s orders and work for him. Otherwise, Xiao Tianfang could easily have killed her.

However, it was different now. The Intrinsic Lock was removed and Gu Lady was no longer restricted.

After meeting up with Li Xuan and Worm Dugu, the trio returned to their residence.

On the way back, Worm Dugu asked with a smile, “Uncle-Master, my acting isn’t bad, right?”

“Not bad. It’s just a little exaggerated,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Only exaggerated acting can be acknowledged by others. Didn’t Xiao Tianfang end up believing it? On account of my age and how hard I’ve worked to participate in your act, shouldn’t you consider teaching me a few tricks on how to adopt a phoenix?” Worm Dugu said.

“The trick is to find a phoenix and be fancied by it.” Zhou Wen was speaking the truth, but his honest words left Worm Dugu depressed.

On the way back, Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss with the Kuman Nee. The jade-like bones were slowly growing. Not only was the bone expanding, but there were also flesh and blood vessels growing on it.

What’s going on? Could she have come back to life? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly stored her into the chaos space. Otherwise, it would be too shocking if others saw her.
