Chapter 1649 The Trumpet Sounds

After the explosion, Zhou Wen and company looked at the plant and bee.

However, the spot where the plant was had already become a huge crater. The plant that grew in the glacier had long vanished. Not a single leaf or vine was left behind.

Where did the bee go? Don’t tell me it died just like that? Zhou Wen scanned his surroundings, hoping to find the bee’s remains. He didn’t believe that the bee had died just like that.

Indeed, Zhou Wen quickly discovered traces of the tiny bee. It wasn’t dead. It was floating in the air and looked extremely lucid. The wings on its back moved so quickly that they appeared almost invisible.

In its front claws, it still held the trumpet-like item as it stared at the Companion Beast that had retreated into the air.

The Companion Beast also stared at the bee as though it had some qualms. It didn’t attack again.

In the blink of an eye, the Companion Beast seemed to make up its mind as it attacked the bee again. It used Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal.

Arcs of Essence Energy slashed at the bee from all directions. It was like an inescapable net that prevented it from dodging.

As the creator of Transcendent Flying Immortal, Zhou Wen naturally knew how terrifying such an attack was. Unless the bee’s speed far exceeded the Companion Beast’s, it could only await death. Just as Zhou Wen thought that the bee was about to suffer, he saw it finally wake up. It placed the trumpet in its mouth, puffed up its cheeks, and blew hard.

A high and sharp sound blared from the trumpet. Zhou Wen felt that it sounded like a suona.

No, it shouldn’t be said that it was similar. It was exactly a suona. The high pitch voice was something that no other musical instrument could simulate. It was music that penetrated straight to the soul.

Pfft! Under the protection of the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but vomit a mouthful of blood when he heard the suona’s sound.

Jiuyang and Xiao’s situation was even worse. Although they were also within the Teacher Domain’s range and were protected by it, the Teacher Domain wasn’t their own strength after all. The injuries they suffered were worse than Zhou Wen’s.

Xiao and Jiuyang fell from the sky and into the glacier ruins. It was unknown if they were dead or alive.

The Companion Beast also spat out blood as it fell from the sky, plummeting towards the ravaged planet.

It wasn’t just Zhou Wen and company. Even the black and white wolves and the strange fish, who were fighting inside the planet, fell to the ground when they heard the suona. It was unknown if they were dead or alive as well.

Anything alive on the planet fell when they heard the suona, their survivability a question. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The bee’s wings trembled. Its claws still held the trumpet, but it didn’t blow it again. The sound swept across the planet as though it was searching for a living creature.

When Zhou Wen saw the bee’s gaze sweep towards him, he immediately pretended to be dead in the ruins of the glacier and rocks. He converged all his vitality and aura, hoping to fool the bee.

What the hell is this? It seems even more terrifying than the Companion Beast that was pursuing us. Are all the Companion Beasts on this planet that terrifying? I wonder how Tsukuyomi is doing. Will this lethal suona sound affect Tsukuyomi and kill her? The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more likely it was.

Even Heaven-level Companion Beasts and experts like Xiao couldn’t withstand the suona’s sound and fell onto the planet. It was still a question if they were dead or alive. If Tsukuyomi, who was in a state that didn’t allow disturbances, heard this sound, the chances of her dying were very high.

Even if she didn’t die, the possibility of her going berserk was very high.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t have the chance to save Tsukuyomi even if he wanted to. The suona’s sound instantly covered the entire planet, preventing him from saving her.

It was unknown if Jiuyang and Xiao were dead or alive. In any case, there was no sound after they landed. It was highly likely that the situation wasn’t good.

As Zhou Wen pretended to be dead, he used Truth Listener’s powers to scan the Companion Beast’s location. He saw it struggling to stand up. Although the suona had dealt him quite significant damage, it hadn’t killed him.

As the Companion Beast struggled to its feet, its injuries rapidly healed. When it floated in the air, it had already returned to its uninjured state. It looked like it had never been injured.

The Companion Beast stared at the bee as the coldness in its eyes intensified. Its aura also became stronger.

A dog-eat-dog fight. Zhou Wen had no intention of getting up to participate in the battle. All he wanted to do was watch from the side as the two terrifying Companion Beasts fought.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to know who would win. What he was most worried about was if anything happened to Tsukuyomi. When the Companion Beast moved and attacked the bee, Zhou Wen silently sneaked towards Tsukuyomi.

However, when Zhou Wen arrived, he realized that the ice cavern had already collapsed and shattered into ice. Although he didn’t find Tsukuyomi’s corpse, she was probably doomed.

After all, Tsukuyomi couldn’t move while absorbing the power of the Moon Essence Basin. It was impossible for her to withstand such a force.

I’ve already tried my best. You can’t blame me even if you died. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly. He had worked so hard for so long, but he ultimately couldn’t save Tsukuyomi’s life.

With Tsukuyomi doomed, Zhou Wen no longer had any reason to continue fighting. He was already considering how to escape.

Of course, Zhou Wen didn’t immediately escape. He pretended to be dead in the glacier ruins, hoping to wait until the outcome of the two terrifying Companion Beasts was decided.

The two Companion Beasts were extremely terrifying existences. One seemed to be able to transform all the powers in the world for its own use as though it was a monster that couldn’t be killed. As for the bee, it only blew the tiny trumpet, and even Heaven-level creatures couldn’t withstand it. How impressive was that?

Zhou Wen was basically certain that the bee was the parasitic Companion Beast. The suona-like item was very likely something that had been lost in the battlefield of the gods.

What’s that tiny trumpet? It only needs a mere blow to be so powerful. If the bee were to use it to play a tune, what would happen? Zhou Wen thought of the music produced by the bubbles.

Back then, just music without any power could make humans and dimensional creatures commit suicide. If the tune was played by a trumpet, Zhou Wen really had no idea what the outcome would be.
