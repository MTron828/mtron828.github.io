Chapter 333 People of Different Realms

Zhou Wen was delighted by the improvement in Transcendent Flying Immortal. He wanted to thank Feng Qiuyan for sparring with him; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to make such progress in such a short period of time. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, before Zhou Wen could say a word, Feng Qiuyan said, “Coach, thank you for your guidance. I’ve learned something.”

“What did you learn?” Zhou Wen was somewhat confused, unsure what Feng Qiuyan meant.

Feng Qiuyan said solemnly, “Coach, you specifically came to point out the flaws in my saber techniques. You truly care about me, and I will definitely not disappoint you. I will definitely be accomplished in the future. Coach, don’t worry.”

Who the hell has expectations for you? Zhou Wen looked at Feng Qiuyan with a mixed expression. Seeing Feng Qiuyan’s sincere and serious expression, he couldn’t bring himself to thank him. All he could do was say helplessly, “Train well. I have something to tend to. I’ll be leaving now.”

“Coach, don’t worry. I’ll definitely work hard,” Feng Qiuyan shouted as Zhou Wen walked away.

Zhou Wen didn’t turn his head as he waved his hand. He really didn’t know what to say. He clearly hadn’t taught anything, but Feng Qiuyan always made rapid progress. This left Zhou Wen puzzled.

“Coach’s swordsmanship is really amazing!” Ming Xiu walked over and said with a fiery gaze.

He had been researching the sword technique his father had passed down. He wanted to modify it so that it could truly join the ranks of formidable sword techniques. Initially, he had no clue how to proceed, but after seeing Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal, he had a vague idea.

Tian Zhenzhen said from the side, “Zhou Wen’s sword technique is indeed quite good, but he only defeated Feng Qiuyan once.”

Tian Zhenzhen was already convinced that Zhou Wen was very strong. The strike was indeed domineering and it left a deep impression on her. However, from the beginning to the end, Zhou Wen had been constantly suppressed by Feng Qiuyan. At the end of it, he only had a one-strike advantage. From her point of view, the two of them were evenly matched, and Zhou Wen had only won by a narrow margin.

However, Feng Qiuyan shook his head and said, “That’s just what you see on the surface. Actually, Coach wasn’t asking me to teach him the technique of a swift sword, but to point out the flaws in my saber techniques.”

“Is that so?” Tian Zhenzhen was quite doubtful of Feng Qiuyan’s words.

Feng Qiuyan asked, “Didn’t you realize that Coach rarely counterattacked?”

“Isn’t it because he was suppressed by your swift saber?” Tian Zhenzhen asked.

Feng Qiuyan said in all seriousness, “Of course not. The reason Coach didn’t counterattack is that he wanted me to demonstrate my saber techniques to the fullest extent so that he could find the flaws in them. He didn’t counterattack much, but every time he did, he hit the flaws in my saber technique, making me realize my weaknesses so that I can correct them in time.”

“Is that so?” Tian Zhenzhen’s eyes widened in disbelief. However, this came from the horse’s mouth. She just couldn’t doubt him.

Ming Xiu also said, “That’s true. Every time Coach made a move, he did strike at the flaws in the saber technique. To be able to see through the flaws in an opponent’s saber technique so quickly in a battle, his martial arts attainments are indeed much better than ours.”

With even Ming Xiu saying that. Tian Zhenzhen couldn’t keep up her doubts.

However, Ming Xiu didn’t know that Zhou Wen’s powers weren’t purely because of his martial arts attainments. It was an ability that came with the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.

Feng Qiuyan nodded in agreement. “Indeed. Coach is caring. He knew that my saber techniques were flawed, so he came specially to point them out to me. Only after I corrected all the flaws in my saber techniques did he defeat me with one strike. If he had gone all out from the beginning, I wouldn’t have been able to withstand that strike of his, so how could I deliver a hundred strikes at Coach?”

Feng Qiuyan didn’t know that Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal wasn’t that strong in the beginning. It was only because he learned the beneficial traits of a hundred saber strikes did he evolve it into something so terrifying.

That’s what happened? Tian Zhenzhen was alarmed. On careful thought, it did seem to be the case. If Zhou Wen were to directly use that extremely domineering strike, wouldn’t Feng Qiuyan have lost in one strike?

With this in mind, Tian Zhenzhen couldn’t help but sigh. “Sunset College indeed lives up to its reputation as the best college in this district. To think a student could be this strong. My horizons have been too stilted in the past.”

“That’s very normal. You guys haven’t been here for too long. As time goes by, you will understand Coach’s true strength. In the past, when Coach played games on his cell phone while competing with me. He didn’t even spare me a glance. I wasn’t his match either. Furthermore, I was completely defeated.” The competition Feng Qiuyan mentioned was actually back during their first encounter at the ball launcher. It wasn’t a real battle.

However, when Tian Zhenzhen and Ming Xiu heard this, it left them shocked beyond words. An expert like Feng Qiuyan who could fight Ming Xiu to a draw could actually be defeated by Zhou Wen with one hand. Furthermore, he was gaming on his phone. This was unbelievable.

“Coach... Is he really that powerful?” Tian Zhenzhen changed the way she addressed Zhou Wen, no longer calling Zhou Wen by his name.

“I wouldn’t call him strong, but that he’s on a completely different realm from us. Alright, it’s time for me to train. After Coach’s guidance, not only did he make me correct the flaws of my saber techniques, he even made me realize something new. His final strike was to tell me that no one would foolishly wait for me to deliver more than a hundred strikes. If I can’t resolve this problem, my saber techniques can only be considered inferior. Now, I’m going to practice my saber techniques and resolve this problem.” After saying that, Feng Qiuyan turned and left.

“I’m also going to practice my swordplay. Coach’s strike has inspired me greatly. I think I have a direction in my research of my own sword technique.” Ming Xiu also left hurriedly.

Tian Zhenzhen followed Ming Xiu with a complicated expression. She turned back and looked in the direction in which Zhou Wen had left. I thought Ming Xiu was invincible among his peers. I never expected there to be such a strong peer in the world. It’s truly terrifying.

Zhou Wen naturally didn’t know what they were thinking. Now, his Transcendent Flying Immortal had improved significantly. All he needed to do was train for a period of time to hone his striking and retracting, allowing him to advance to Rank 10 quickly.

Zhou Wen didn’t do anything significant for the next few days. He just trained his Transcendent Flying Immortal in-game. He wanted to push it to the limit and slice through the white cocoon in a perfect manner to obtain a drop of blood from the terrifying creature within to see if he could advance to the Epic stage.

Although he already had quite a number of Epic pets, such as the Mutated Stone Chi, the Purple Air Bell, and the White Shadow of Poison-which were all very strong-he would ultimately suffer if his strength was too weak. It didn’t matter how powerful his pets were if he were to be killed. All of them would vanish and be of no use.
