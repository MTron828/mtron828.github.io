Chapter 877: Miscalculation

At the instant the Supreme Yin Wind, augmented by the Three Realms’ Best Wind, swept into the pill furnace, the flames inside the pill furnace that was originally roaring with wind and fire immediately converged. The airflow also became much calmer.

Something appeared where the wind and fire converged.

Zhou Wen saw what it was and revealed a look of surprise. However, he didn’t hesitate. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had already rushed over and grabbed the item before rushing out of the pill furnace.

In the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s hand was a golden banana fan. It was golden and resplendent like the sun.

The shape of the banana fan was somewhat similar to Banana Fairy’s fan shape, but it wasn’t completely the same. There was a strong flow of wind and fire Essence Energy on it, making it different from Banana Fairy.

Jing Daoxian, the elder, and the stone sword never expected Zhou Wen to take out the item in the pill furnace. After a moment of surprise, the stone sword and the elder rushed towards the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General holding the banana fan, hoping to snatch it back.

With a thought, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General returned to Zhou Wen. The Sun Banana Fan also landed in front of him. Zhou Wen held the fan’s handle and could feel the heat through the Dragon Scale Armor.

With the elder and the stone sword rushing over, Zhou Wen held the Sun Banana Fan and fanned at them. Immediately, a scorching wind blew out. Wherever the hot wind went, flames would ignite.

What was even more terrifying was that the wind and fire in the entire underground space moved with the Sun Banana Fan, turning into a terrifying fire dragon that swept towards the elder and the stone sword.

The elder and the stone sword used their powers of Terror transformation to meet the fire dragon.

Boom!

The entire underground world shook. Although the fire dragon was defeated by the elder and the stone sword, they were also sent flying by the power of wind and fire.

Jing Daoxian silently arrived near Zhou Wen. With a flash of the Yin Yang Mirror in his hand, Zhou Wen’s soul projection appeared. He wanted to control Zhou Wen’s body.

Before Jing Daoxian could control Zhou Wen’s body, Zhou Wen threw the Sun Banana Fan in his hand. At the same time, the other banana fan in his hand flew out and transformed into a girl sitting on a banana leaf in midair. She reached out and grabbed the Sun Banana Fan.

“Jing Daoxian, you can use your soul to control my body, but you can’t control my Companion Beast. At most, we can just break ranks. If I can’t defeat you, I’ll just destroy that fan. No one can have it,” Zhou Wen said.

Zhou Wen originally believed that he had the means to negotiate, but what happened next completely exceeded his expectations.

After Banana Fairy grabbed the Sun Banana Fan, it turned into golden wind and fire that fused into the banana leaf beneath Banana Fairy.

Golden veins appeared on the emerald-like green banana leaf.

Before Zhou Wen could react, a violent gust of wind erupted from Banana Fairy’s body, enveloping her before returning to Zhou Wen.

It evolved... Zhou Wen was somewhat dumbfounded.

He originally wanted to use the power of the Sun Banana Fan to resist Jing Daoxian, the elder, and the stone sword. In this land of wind and fire, the Sun Banana Fan had a natural advantage. It could be said that this was its home ground. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, the Sun Banana Fan had been absorbed by the banana leaf and had entered an evolutionary state. Instantly, Zhou Wen’s previous plans failed.

Seeing Jing Daoxian, the elder, and the stone sword staring at him, Zhou Wen felt somewhat awkward.

He had held back on using Banana Fairy’s ability to restrain wind and fire, hoping that she could deliver a shocking effect at the critical moment. Now, she had indeed delivered a shocking effect, but this was just too much of a shock. Even Zhou Wen didn’t expect this to happen. He felt his lips turn bitter.

With the Sun Banana Fan gone, the stone sword was enraged. Laws appeared on the sword as it charged at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare take the attack head-on. He used the Civilized Country ring to teleport elsewhere, but just as he teleported out, the elder’s crystalline palm had already grabbed at his neck, forcing Zhou Wen to teleport again.

Civilized Country was much stronger than Lost Country, but it could only teleport ten times. It was absolutely impossible to finish off the elder and the stone sword in ten teleportations.

Furthermore, with Jing Daoxian eyeing him covetously, Zhou Wen’s chances were even slimmer.

“Give me your Companion Beast and I’ll help you tide through this calamity,” Jing Daoxian said with a smile.

Zhou Wen didn’t believe Jing Daoxian at all. Seeing the elder and the stone sword charge at him again, he didn’t hesitate to activate the Civilized Country. However, he wasn’t using teleportation this time, but the positioning teleportation function.

The markings in the ghost face’s eyes spun as Zhou Wen instantly vanished with Ya’er in his arms.

Bam!

The positioning teleportation ability of Civilized Country required him to specify a location in advance. In the future, no matter where he was, he could return there by activating the positioning teleportation function.

As Zhou Wen had recently figured it out, he had set the coordinates not far from Mount Dragon Tiger.

He originally wanted to escape from the Founding Emperor Tomb and think of a way to retrieve his soul controlled by the Yin Yang Mirror in the future. However, to his surprise, he failed to teleport out and appeared at the Founding Emperor Tomb entrance.

Damn it. Even teleportation can’t leave the Founding Emperor Tomb? Zhou Wen didn’t have the luxury of time. If he couldn’t leave, Jing Daoxian and company would catch up to him sooner or later.

He directly put on the Invisibility Cloak and switched his Essence Energy Art to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, allowing the Defy Ancient Sovereign to fuse with him. Then, he charged towards the beam of light that the elder had walked out of.

After taking a few steps, he felt as though some force was summoning his body, making him want to rush in the direction of the palace. Zhou Wen immediately got the Defy Ancient Sovereign to take over his body and forcefully control it to continue charging forward without being affected by the soul in the Yin Yang Mirror.

The pillar of light vanished. Zhou Wen found himself near an inconspicuous building in the ancient city. He didn’t hesitate to rush in.

The stone house wasn’t big, and it looked very simple. There were no beds or tables. There was only a stone platform with many bamboo slips on the rack beside it.

After passing through the room, there was another room inside. Zhou Wen walked in and saw that it was an alchemy room. There were all kinds of pill furnaces and other equipment. There were also many refined pills stored in bottles.

Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he stored everything inside the Chaos Bead, regardless of whether they were useful or not.

Zhou Wen also stored the bamboo slips. It was a waste not to take them. Perhaps they would be useful in the future.

Just as he finished, he heard a whistling sound from the ancient city. It was likely the stone sword that had rushed out of the temple. However, the stone sword didn’t discover Zhou Wen. It knew that Zhou Wen definitely couldn’t leave, so it constantly flew around the city, hoping to find him.
