The nine-tailed fox’s eyes suffused a demonic glint as its nine tails danced wildly. Essence Energy spewed out from its body like a volcanic eruption.

Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to charge forward. However, when Tyrant Behemoth met the nine-tailed fox’s eyes, it was immediately charmed by it. It turned around and charged at the blood-colored avatar.

Zhou Wen hurriedly dodged and retreated as Tyrant Behemoth chased after him.

Even a Mythical creature like Tyrant Behemoth can be bewitched? Zhou Wen turned his head to take a look. Thankfully, the nine-tailed fox was locked inside the bronze tripod cauldron and couldn’t chase after him.

Tyrant Behemoth chased Zhou Wen for quite some time before the effects of the bewitchment on it gradually vanished. Zhou Wen regained control of it and unsummoned Tyrant Behemoth.

I can resist the bewitchment myself, but my Companion Beasts can’t. From the looks of it, I can only personally kill that nine-tailed fox. Zhou Wen felt that the nine-tailed fox didn’t seem like The Thearch.

Even if The Thearch in-game wasn’t as intelligent as in real life, it wasn’t to the point of having such a low IQ. Furthermore, it felt like the nine-tailed fox’s abilities were somewhat different from The Thearch’s.

At the very least, the nine-tailed fox didn’t seem to have the ability to make wishes, nor did it have the invisible pressure of The Thearch.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t see the nine-tailed fox reveal its Terror state. If it used its Terror state, Zhou Wen’s strike probably wouldn’t be able to injure it.

After returning to the nine-tailed fox, Zhou Wen wore the Invisibility Cloak and activated its invisibility. He approached without the nine-tailed fox noticing him.

The Light Concealment Sword combined with the Immortal Slaying Sword cleaved off the nine-tailed fox’s head. The nine-tailed fox didn’t even have time to react.

From the looks of it, this nine-tailed fox can’t be The Thearch. Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed, but he suddenly realized that something was amiss.

The nine-tailed fox was already dead. Logically speaking, there should be a game notification, but there was no notification of him killing the nine-tailed fox.

Crack! Crack!

The chains that bound the nine-tailed fox automatically unshackled because it was dead.

However, after the chains were released, the nine-tailed fox’s corpse floated in the air as its head grew out again. As its nine tails swayed, its Essence Energy burned like flames. Wherever the flames passed, the nine-tailed fox’s body underwent a strange change. It gradually transformed from a fox into a beautiful woman in white palace robes.

Furthermore, this white-robed woman’s body suffused a demonic glow. She looked like a ghost. This time, it wasn’t an illusion, but a woman.

‘Warning... Warning... Nine-Tailed Fox has entered a Terror form... Nine-Tailed Fox has entered a Terror form...’ A red warning popped up in the game.

Terror transformation! Zhou Wen turned around and ran without a word. He didn’t have the means to kill a Terror-grade opponent. If he didn’t run, he could only wait for death.

Thankfully, the Invisibility Cloak’s effects were still present. The Nine-Tailed Fox couldn’t see Zhou Wen, allowing him to escape.

Although I can’t be sure if the Nine-Tailed Fox is The Thearch, if that alchemist pursues me again, I can lure him to it. Zhou Wen had seen the abilities of the Nine-Tailed Fox and had some ideas.

The strongest ability of the Nine-tailed Fox was still bewitchment, but bewitchment was useless against Zhou Wen. Therefore, in comparison, the Nine-Tailed Fox was a Terror-grade creature that Zhou Wen was least afraid of.

Zhou Wen avoided the location of the Nine-Tailed Fox and went to other places in Deer Terrace Pavilion to hunt dimensional creatures. However, no matter where he went, he would eventually reach the space where the Nine-Tailed Fox was.

From the looks of it, only by killing the Nine-Tailed Fox will I be able to reach the area behind. Zhou Wen could only temporarily give up on the idea of grinding Deer Terrace Pavilion.

After grinding all the dungeons that he could, he didn’t obtain much. When he was grinding the Ancient Sword Tomb, he discovered a Mythical ancient sword.

The ancient sword was wide and had extremely powerful destructive power. After killing it, he learned that it was named Great Destroyer. It was a Mythical sword, but unfortunately, it didn’t drop a Companion Egg.

After returning to Luoyang for a few days, he didn’t find any traces of the alchemist. This made Zhou Wen feel uneasy.

An Sheng had already gotten people to carry out surveillance, hoping to discover the alchemist before he entered Luoyang. Unfortunately, there was no news. It was unknown if he hadn’t come to Luoyang or if he had avoided all the surveillance.

...

Xuanwen Club’s training grounds.

“Your wise and mighty President has returned. Aren’t you very happy and surprised?” Li Xuan returned much earlier than expected.

According to Li Xuan, he had already learned most of Worm Dugu’s Gu nurturing techniques. All that was left was practice. He had found it boring and ran back alone.

Due to the pair of Ice Silkworms, Li Xuan’s combat strength was considered very strong. However, when he was in the Dugu family, Worm Dugu didn’t let him use the Ice Silkworms. He insisted that he fight all sorts of Gu, causing him to suffer quite a bit.

However, because of this, he had a deep understanding of Gu, and it had helped his growth tremendously.

“I realize that you seem to have become much more handsome recently?” Zhou Wen sized up Li Xuan.

“Is that so?” Li Xuan stroked his chin and said smugly, “I’ve always been handsome. You just didn’t realize it in the past. There’s nothing to be alarmed about.”

“No, I really think you are much more handsome than before. Come, let me take a closer look.” Zhou Wen circled Li Xuan a few times and nodded in thought. “I see. I understand...”

“What do you understand?” Li Xuan asked curiously.

“I understand why you look so much more handsome,” Zhou Wen said.

“Why?” Li Xuan hurriedly asked.

“Because you...” Zhou Wen deliberately lowered his voice. When Li Xuan approached to hear him clearly, he punched him in the eye. “Because you haven’t suffered a beating in a long while.”

Li Xuan immediately flew into a rage after being punched in the eye. “Zhou Wen, how dare you sneak an attack on me? You’re dead.”

Seeing Li Xuan rush over, Zhou Wen summoned the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul and fused it with himself, taking on a battle stance.

When Li Xuan charged over, the Life Soul carapace had already enveloped his body. At the same time, he swung his fist.

Zhou Wen dodged Li Xuan’s fist and chopped at the back of his neck.

Li Xuan strangely circled around with his movement technique. Not only did he dodge Zhou Wen’s chop, but he also stabbed at Zhou Wen’s waist like a sharp blade.

“What’s with your movement technique?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

When Li Xuan was injured, he could quickly learn the other party’s skills and moves, but he couldn’t learn movement techniques.

As movement techniques couldn’t hurt him, Li Xuan’s movement technique had always been his weakness.

However, Li Xuan’s movement technique had clearly improved significantly. Furthermore, it looked rather strange and fast.

“Hehe, this is the Dugu family’s movement technique. It originally wasn’t taught to outsiders, but my talent is too great and my character is excellent. They made an exception and I got to learn it from the Dugu family...” Li Xuan said smugly.

“Then let me see how much you have learned.” Zhou Wen became serious as he pushed the Defy Ancient Sovereign’s strength to its limits.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
