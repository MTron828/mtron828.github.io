Chapter 1077: Origins of the Dimensional Wheel

Translator: CKtalon

Before long, Ya’s body completely transformed into light. On the cube’s screen, only a humanoid figure could be seen. If he moved slightly, the dazzling light would change, preventing anyone from seeing his appearance.

Instead, because Primordial Immortal Sword had yet to reach the Terror grade, it remained in Ya’s hand.

“The Guardian you fused with was already at the Terror grade?” Night Thearch asked as he admired Zhong Ziya who had transformed into the Terror form.

“Yes,” Zhong Ziya answered.

“With your strength, it should be impossible for you to absorb such a Guardian. How did you do it?” Night Thearch continued asking.

“A betting contract,” Zhong Ziya answered.

Others might not understand what a betting contract was, but Night Thearch knew very well. When he heard that, he asked with a heavy expression, “What did you bet with him?”

“First on the rankings,” Zhong Ziya answered.

Night Thearch laughed. “Do you know how difficult this path is? It’s impossible for the alien races in all the worlds to let even half a human become the final victor.”

“Only with difficulty will there be fun.” Zhong Ziya’s hand that held the sword glowed brightly. The Primordial Immortal Sword and scabbard in his hand slowly lit up before finally turning into a body of light.

“Interesting. Then let me see if you have the qualifications to walk to the end.” Night Thearch took a step forward and Evernight descended on the arena again, turning everything into darkness.

All the humans in the world felt extremely uncomfortable. It was like watching a boring crappy movie in a movie theater. After enduring it for an hour and finally seeing a beautiful woman about to take a bath, the screen suddenly turned black. Only the sound of water splashing could be heard. It was so uncomfortable that it made one want to go crazy.

Zhou Wen didn’t feel good either because he couldn’t see what was happening inside.

However, this state didn’t last long. Soon, a point of light appeared on the dark screen. The point of light became brighter and brighter before it lit up the dark area like a volcanic eruption.

In the end, the light was just too powerful. It made it impossible to look straight at it. It was so blinding that one couldn’t even open their eyes.

When the light faded, the cube’s screen finally returned to normal. Ya and Night Thearch’s figures appeared. The two of them looked at each other from afar as though nothing had happened.

“Who won?”

“I don’t know. I didn’t see anything at all.”

“It’s too terrifying. We can’t even see a battle at that level. If such experts want to slaughter humans, we won’t even have the chance to resist.”

...

Everyone discussed spiritedly as Zhou Wen wore a puzzled look. He didn’t know who had won or lost.

“I hope you can walk to the end.” After Night Thearch said that, he turned around and vanished into the night.

“I will,” Zhong Ziya answered.

The cube’s screen went black before returning to the rankings. Ya remained in first place. Night Thearch didn’t appear on the rankings, so it was obvious that Ya had won again.

After Ya won this time, the Guardians didn’t swarm over to challenge him like before. There wasn’t even one challenger.

This was because the Guardians knew very well that only a Terror grade could defeat a Terror grade. If they were to challenge him again, it wouldn’t be a challenge, but suicide.

There are less than forty hours left on the countdown. If this continues, Ya should have a chance of getting first, right? Zhou Wen muttered to himself.

“It’s impossible for him to obtain first place.” A palm-sized humanoid puppet walked over, but the sound emitted by the puppet belonged to Moon Goddess.

“Why not? He’s already at the Terror grade. Even if he encounters other Terror grades, he should have a good chance of winning, right?” Zhou Wen didn’t know why Moon Goddess was so certain that Zhong Ziya wouldn’t come in first.

“Just as Night Thearch said, it’s impossible for the dimension to let even half a human obtain first place,” Moon Goddess answered.

Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and said, “If humans obtain first place, it means that no dimensional race can obtain control of Earth for a year. I can understand that. However, Ya can only be considered half human. If he wins, doesn’t it mean that the race of the Guardian that fused with Ya won? Why can’t they accept that?”

“If he is not of our kin, he is sure to have a different mind. It’s the same for dimensional creatures. If Ya finds the strongest Companion Beast in this year, do you think he will hand it over to the dimensional creatures?” Moon Goddess paused before continuing, “Most importantly, that Dimensional Wheel can’t be handed over to a creature with human blood. Otherwise, even if those dimensional experts personally descend, it’s impossible for them to defeat a human with a Dimensional Wheel in this world.”

“The Dimensional Wheel is created by dimensional creatures. Could it be that they can’t deal with it?” Zhou Wen asked suspiciously.

“Who told you that the Dimensional Wheel was created by dimensional creatures?” Moon Goddess asked.

“Isn’t that so?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

“Of course not. The so-called Dimensional Wheel is actually a Companion Beast,” said Moon Goddess.

“Companion Beast? What level is it?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

“It’s hard to say what level it is, but the owner of that Companion Beast was the person who had the strongest Guardian in that horrific era. In that era, they fought countless powerful opponents in the world and ultimately obtained first place. That Dimensional Wheel played a role of inestimable proportions.”

Moon Goddess paused for a moment before continuing, “After all, Guardians in that era weren’t as weak as they are now. This is because the Battle of Guardians took a long time. All the Guardians had enough time to become stronger. Furthermore, in that era, the various races of the dimension had just reached an agreement. The regulations weren’t too strict. Many terrifying dimensional creatures descended and secretly controlled the Battle of Guardians. The expert who could defeat all his opponents in that era and stand at the peak of the world was an unimaginably powerful existence.”

“Which era is the horrific era you speak of? Who’s the Guardian who obtained first place? Who’s his contractor?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

“That human’s name is Xuan Yuan. The Guardian’s name is Mystic Thearch,” Moon Goddess answered.

“Xuan Yuan! Could it be Yellow Emperor!? Then, is Chiyou among his opponents?” Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly asked. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“There was indeed such a person. He was also an existence that was very likely to win first place at that time. His Guardian was the Weapon Lord. I still remember that if Xuan Yuan hadn’t taken the Dimensional Wheel back then, the human who clinched final victory in that horrifying era might have been Chiyou,” Moon Goddess said.

“What do you mean? Didn’t you say that the Dimensional Wheel is Yellow Emperor’s Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen was even more puzzled when he heard that.

“That’s right. Yellow Emperor picked up the Dimensional Wheel Companion Egg, so the Dimensional Wheel naturally became his Companion Beast. However, Chiyou originally had a chance of obtaining the Dimensional Wheel Companion Egg. No, it should be said that the dimensional wheel originally belonged to Chiyou and Weapon Lord,” Moon Goddess said after some thought.
