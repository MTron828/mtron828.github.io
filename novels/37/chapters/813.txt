Chapter 814: Wanting to Know the Feeling of Being Injured

Zhou Wen said that he wanted to spar with Feng Qiuyan, but he couldn’t invite him to beat him up because he wanted to be beaten and injured.

When he arrived at the training grounds, Feng Qiuyan was already waiting for him.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Gulli and Sadie were also there. Only after chatting did he realize that Feng Qiuyan had been practicing with Gulli and Sadie recently.

Feng Qiuyan sure is a martial arts fanatic. In the past, it used to be Ming Xiu, then Li Xuan. Now, he doesn’t even let Gulli and Sadie off, Zhou Wen thought.

“My saber techniques have improved recently. Coach, please guide me,” Feng Qiuyan said as he picked up a practice saber.

“Why don’t you use the Life Soul Saber?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

In the past, when Feng Qiuyan fought, be it in practice or in actual combat, he used the Life Soul Saber. Today, for some reason, he suddenly used the practice saber.

If it were any other time, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have any problems with Feng Qiuyan using a practice saber, but Zhou Wen was here to get injured. How could Feng Qiuyan injure him with a practice saber?

“I’ve been practicing with Sadie recently. In order to crack her abilities, I can only make some attempts with my saber techniques. I can’t always release without being able to withdraw in time, so...” Feng Qiuyan explained.

“I see. However, you should switch to the Life Soul Saber. I want to find the feeling of actual combat. It’s best if I can suffer some injuries,” Zhou Wen said.

Feng Qiuyan looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement. “Coach, why do you want to be injured?”

Zhou Wen had no choice but to explain. “If a person doesn’t make mistakes, he will never know what’s right. If he has never been injured, he naturally wouldn’t know how to deal with injuries when he suffers one. Therefore, I want to suffer some injuries and have a taste of being injured.”

Feng Qiuyan was enlightened when he heard that. “You’re right, Coach. I get it.”

With that said, Feng Qiuyan placed the practice saber back and summoned his Life Soul Saber.

However, when Gulli and Sadie heard Zhou Wen’s words, they had different thoughts.

Getting injured when entering a dimensional zone to hunt dimensional creatures was actually very normal. Otherwise, the school wouldn’t have been equipped with specialized hospitals.

Even Sadie, who had the Eye of Odin, would sometimes be injured. After all, anything could be found in a dimensional zone. A person’s strength didn’t determine everything.

However, Zhou Wen’s words made it seem as though he had never been injured. He actually wanted to find the feeling of being injured, making Gulli and Sadie wonder what he was up to.

“Although Zhou Wen is indeed very strong, Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques are so fast that even my Eye of Odin can only see them but not dodge them. If Zhou Wen isn’t careful, he might really be injured,” Sadie said.

Gulli had been practicing with Feng Qiuyan for the past few days. He had a deep understanding of how good Feng Qiuyan was and felt that Zhou Wen would definitely suffer if he underestimated him.

Zhou Wen didn’t use a practice saber. Firstly, the practice saber couldn’t block the Life Soul Saber. Secondly, Zhou Wen was here to get injured, so he didn’t plan on blocking.

“Coach, be careful.” With that said, Feng Qiuyan drew his saber and slashed.

Before he saw the saber beam, Zhou Wen felt a chill streak across his chest. He immediately moved his feet and saw Feng Qiuyan’s saber slice past his shoulder.

What a fast saber! Feng Qiuyan’s saber speed was comparable to his Mythical Transcendent Flying Immortal, surprising Zhou Wen.

Before Feng Qiuyan’s strike landed, his saber’s might slashed down like a raging river.

This was a saber technique that Sadie couldn’t dodge even if she could see it. Zhou Wen needed to focus all his attention when using Transcendent Flying Immortal. If he made any mistakes, he might be struck by the saber.

Zhou Wen’s original intention was to spar with him, get injured, and return to recuperate.

However, Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques surprised him. He couldn’t help but have another look. The more he looked, the more interesting he found them. For a moment, he forgot about getting injured, eager to take another look at Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques.

Sadie was alarmed when she saw Zhou Wen dodge Feng Qiuyan’s attack without retaliating.

Under normal circumstances, a person with the same physique definitely wasn’t as fast as a saber. Yet, Zhou Wen was able to dodge Feng Qiuyan’s saber. This meant that Zhou Wen was faster than Feng Qiuyan. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Feng Qiuyan’s explosive saber techniques ultimately failed to injure Zhou Wen. However, his fighting spirit surged as he unleashed his full strength, accelerating his saber.

His Life Providence was Swift Saber Heavenly King, allowing his saber to become faster and faster. However, he had had to control his saber in the past to prevent it from escaping his control.

Now, he was doing the opposite, allowing his saber to become faster and faster. Without deliberately controlling it, the upper limit of his saber speed was much higher. However, under such circumstances, even Feng Qiuyan couldn’t control his saber. He was completely going with the flow.

If he wasn’t in a dire situation, Feng Qiuyan wouldn’t have used such a saber technique. This was a saber technique meant for risking his life in a hopeless situation.

Even so, Feng Qiuyan’s saber failed to touch Zhou Wen from beginning to end. In the end, the saber’s speed was so fast that Feng Qiuyan couldn’t control it. The saber in his hand flew out.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling excited from the battle when he suddenly saw the saber fly out. Realizing that he hadn’t been injured, he immediately felt depressed.

He had come here to get injured, so this meant that he had come for nothing.

Zhou Wen steeled his heart and flew towards the saber. He used his body to catch Feng Qiuyan’s saber as the Life Soul Saber stabbed into his ribs.

Zhou Wen’s actions stunned Sadie, Gulli, and Feng Qiuyan. Feng Qiuyan couldn’t control his saber from slipping out of his hand. He couldn’t injure Zhou Wen at all; yet, Zhou Wen had chosen to slam into the saber.

“Coach, are you alright?” Feng Qiuyan went forward to check Zhou Wen’s injuries as he unsummoned his Life Soul Saber.

“I’m fine. Do you have any other techniques? I want to try them all out and see how the other types of injuries feel,” Zhou Wen said to Feng Qiuyan.

“I only know how to use a saber.” Feng Qiuyan felt relieved when he saw that Zhou Wen’s wound wasn’t bleeding profusely.

“Why don’t the two of you give it a try?” Zhou Wen placed his sights on Sadie and Gulli. They came from the Ultimate Family Clan of the North District, so the techniques they knew were different from the people of the East District. The injuries they caused should have some effect.

“Coach, you must be joking. How are we your match?” Sadie shook her head and refused to fight Zhou Wen.

Helpless, Zhou Wen could only return to use the Chaos Egg to recuperate.

“Is that fellow really human? He actually slammed himself into the saber!” Gulli said with a strange expression.

Sadie sighed and said, “Just as he said, he wants to know how it feels to be injured, but he’s just too strong. No one can injure him.”

“Even the Dugu family, which is best at movement techniques, probably doesn’t have many people who can reach that level, right?” Gulli exclaimed.
