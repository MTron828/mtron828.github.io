Chapter 972: Mysterious Person

Translator: CKtalon

How was that a dragon? It was a huge octopus monster. The seven strange dragons were its seven tentacles.

However, it was different from ordinary octopuses. Its tentacles had a dragon head growing at the tip, as well as eyes, ears, tongue, and nose. It looked both like an octopus and a dragon. It looked extremely strange and evil.

The enraged Seven Seas Dragon King revealed most of its body. Its strange dragon-like tentacles spewed out white liquid into the air, hoping to strike Zhou Wen down.

Although it was very fast, Zhou Wen wasn’t slow either. Furthermore, he was very far from the sea, preventing the Seven Seas Dragon King from touching him.

Realizing that he couldn’t hit Zhou Wen, the Seven Seas Dragon King suddenly stopped and retracted his seven tentacles.

When Zhou Wen saw the Seven Seas Dragon King’s pose, he found it baffling. Its current appearance was like a sitting Buddha. Its seven tentacles curved into a motionless pose, like a Buddha’s hand that was forming seals.

Zhou Wen could even vaguely hear the chanting of scriptures coming from the Seven Seas Dragon King.

With the strange chanting, the Seven Seas Dragon King’s entire body seemed to fall into a fog, preventing others from seeing clearly.

Not good! Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. He wanted to escape, but it was too late.

Boundless fog rose around him as though the entire world was enveloped by fog. Furthermore, the chanting continued.

An illusion? A mental attack? Or is it some special power? Zhou Wen couldn’t be sure what power the Seven Seas Dragon King was using, but without a doubt, it was a power at the Terror grade.

Zhou Wen used teleportation to teleport out of the fog, but just as he teleported out, he realized that not only was he unable to teleport out of the fog, but he ended up being delivered to right in front of the Seven Seas Dragon King. The Seven Seas Dragon King swallowed Zhou Wen who was beside its mouth.

Zhou Wen felt a terrifying suction force pull his body towards the Seven Seas Dragon King’s stomach.

Zhou Wen wanted to teleport again, but he realized that this place seemed to be a sealed space. He couldn’t teleport out.

Plop!

Zhou Wen’s body fell into the white liquid. In an instant, the Dragon Scale Armor he wore was stuck to the white liquid. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn’t escape. Soon, his entire body sank into the white liquid.

After the Seven Seas Dragon King devoured Zhou Wen, it sank into the sea in satisfaction and quickly vanished.

As the Seven Seas Dragon King vanished, the tsunami gradually subsided. The dimensional creatures that rushed to the coast gradually decreased.

Zhou Wen fell into the white liquid and used many methods, but he couldn’t escape no matter what. Furthermore, he realized that his Dragon Scale Armor was being assimilated by the white liquid. A portion of it had already turned into white liquid.

Even the Mythical Dragon Scale Armor couldn’t withstand the corrosion of the white liquid. Just the thought of the white liquid stuck to his flesh made him shudder.

What should I do? Should I release the ice maiden? Zhou Wen thought of this idea, but he didn’t immediately take action.

The ice maiden was a double-edged sword. Letting her out had pros and cons. If it wasn’t a last resort, Zhou Wen didn’t want to take that step.

He switched to a few more Essence Energy Arts, but they were useless. The Dragon Scale Armor was about to be penetrated.

Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg with the intention of giving it a try.

However, he didn’t have much hope for the Chaos Egg. After all, even the Mythical Dragon Scale Armor couldn’t withstand the white liquid, while the Chaos Egg was only an Epic Life Soul.

However, to Zhou Wen’s surprise, when the Chaos Egg enveloped his body, the white liquid failed to corrode it like the Dragon Scale Armor.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw that the Chaos Egg could ward off the white liquid.

I never expected the Chaos Egg to be so magical. Although it doesn’t have any offensive power, its defense is rather good. Zhou Wen hid inside the Chaos Egg and used Truth Listener’s ability to pay attention to the commotion outside.

The Seven Seas Dragon King was advancing in the sea. From the direction it was heading in, it wasn’t Infinite Island where Dragon Granny was. He didn’t know where he was going.

The Chaos Egg’s defense is impressive, but it can’t move and doesn’t have any offensive strength. How can I escape from here? Zhou Wen thought about it but couldn’t think of a good solution.

Not long after, the Seven Seas Dragon King stopped somewhere. Zhou Wen listened attentively and took in the situation outside. He realized that he was beside a huge rift at the bottom of the sea.

Without any hesitation, the Seven Seas Dragon King entered the underwater rift and entered a place that resembled an abyss.

In the abyss, Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t extend far. It could only hear the nearby situation. After a while, the Seven Seas Dragon King arrived in front of a palace.

This octopus sure knows how to enjoy itself. It actually has such a gorgeous palace in such a place, Zhou Wen thought.

However, Zhou Wen soon felt that something was amiss. When the Seven Seas Dragon King arrived in front of the palace, it made a strange gesture as though it was bowing.

“Come in.” A human voice sounded from the palace.

How can there be humans in such a place? It can’t be a human, right? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

The Seven Seas Dragon King entered the palace. At the same time, Zhou Wen heard the situation inside. There was really a human inside.

The human wore black armor as he sat high on a throne, looking like an emperor.

After the Seven Seas Dragon King entered the palace, he prostrated himself as though he was expressing his humility to the human.

“Has it all been resolved?” the man asked casually.

The Seven Seas Dragon King couldn’t speak. All he could do was nod with all his might. Even the dragon heads at the tip of his tentacles nodded.

“That’s good. After spending so much time planning, I’ve finally created a mixed-blood Dracotaur. How can I let her escape my control?” the man said indifferently.

Who is this person? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

Zhou Wen was very certain that the man was definitely a human and had likely contracted a Guardian. However, even so, it was unbelievable that an existence like the Seven Seas Dragon King would humbly serve him.

The Seven Seas Dragon King nodded repeatedly as though he agreed with the man.

The man didn’t seem willing to communicate with the Seven Seas Dragon King who couldn’t speak. He waved his hand and made the Seven Seas Dragon King retreat to the side. As for him, he sat there, fiddling with something in his hand.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw the item. It was a blue dragon pearl that resembled an ice crystal. It emitted a cold aura that was very similar to the Terror items he had previously obtained.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
