Chapter 784: Assassinating the Guardian

“Don’t tell me Zhou Wen is thin-skinned and is afraid of being mocked by us if he fails?” Butterfly said as she walked.

“I’m afraid it’s not that simple.” Li Mobai had his speculations, but he didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to.

From his point of view, Zhou Wen wasn’t going to do something as simple as dripping a drop of blood for a contract. It was very likely that he would use some method to increase the success rate of the contract.

In fact, Li Mobai had previously thought of a similar method, but because he had transferred the Evil King Gu Life Soul to Li Xuan, his physique was much weaker now. He didn’t dare use any of the methods he could have used in the past.

Li Mobai was very interested in what method Zhou Wen wanted to use. He hoped that Zhou Wen would succeed. This way, he could use Zhou Wen’s method as a reference and still have a chance in the future.

Zhou Wen waited until they were far enough away before he moved. However, he didn’t walk towards the Guardian cocoon. He also distanced himself from it.

However, while keeping a distance, he summoned Tyrant Behemoth.

Boom! Tyrant Behemoth was more than three meters tall, but its body was heavier than steel. When it landed in the cave, the entire cave trembled.

“That’s... Tyrant Behemoth... Tyrant Behemoth that’s ranked fourth... That’s actually Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast...” Butterfly cried out in surprise when she saw Tyrant Behemoth.

Gu Lou and company were also alarmed as their eyes nearly popped out. Tyrant Behemoth’s name was probably known to everyone. Many experts in the Federation had been asking about Tyrant Behemoth’s owner, but they never expected it to be Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast.

Previously, Gu Lou had thought that Zhou Wen was young and frivolous, but now, with his terrifying pets, he was probably not weaker than the top experts of the Dugu family. He indeed had the right to be frivolous.

“What’s he trying to do by summoning Tyrant Behemoth?” Li Mobai looked at Zhou Wen in surprise. He felt that something was amiss. Zhou Wen didn’t seem to be using a trick to contract the Guardian.

Indeed, under everyone’s horrified gazes, Tyrant Behemoth roared and threw a punch at the Guardian cocoon.

“He wants to kill the Guardian, not contract it?” Butterfly’s eyes widened in disbelief. This was beyond her imagination.

Boom!

Tyrant Behemoth shattered the gray cocoon with a punch, revealing the Guardian inside. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

As for Zhou Wen, he had already used the Invisibility Cloak to hide himself. At the same time, he summoned Demonic Neonate and hugged her in his arms, using the Invisibility Cloak to cover her. After all, reality wasn’t a game. Everything would be over if he died. Therefore, Zhou Wen was much more careful than usual.

If he could find a Guardian he could kill in-game, he wouldn’t have taken the risk in reality.

Even in his invisible state, Zhou Wen had no intention of approaching the Guardian. He wanted to figure out what abilities the Guardian had.

The Guardian in the gray cocoon was covered in black carapace. There were ant-like antennas on its head, cicada-like wings on its back, snake-like eyes, and four scorpion-like tails on its back.

This Guardian looked like a humanoid Gu, its body filled with an evil aura.

Just as Tyrant Behemoth’s fist was about to hit the Guardian, the Guardian’s figure suddenly blurred. Tyrant Behemoth’s fist only hit an illusion.

Looking up, he saw the Guardian standing upside down at the top of the cave-like a bat. Its snake-like eyes stared at Tyrant Behemoth. The ten fingers on its hands spread open as thin silk blades crisscrossed like a spiderweb, enveloping Tyrant Behemoth below.

Tyrant Behemoth exerted strength with its legs, tearing the rocks apart. Its body rose into the air as it raised its fist and punched at the spiderweb in the air, hoping to blast the spiderweb and the Guardian to death.

However, when its fist struck the spiderweb-like thin blade, the thin blade was able to withstand the force. It was as though it had punched the air.

As for the silk net blade, it retracted and enveloped Tyrant Behemoth’s body.

Tyrant Behemoth was like a huge fish that had fallen into a fishing net. The more it struggled, the tighter the silk blades wrapped around it. Furthermore, the silk blades had a very strong elasticity. Tyrant Behemoth used its strength in an attempt to break the thin silk blades, but all it could do was expand the net a little. When Tyrant Behemoth relaxed, the thin silk net blades tightened.

The Guardian, who was standing upside down at the top of the cave, flashed and appeared behind Tyrant Behemoth as though it had teleported. Its barbed palm and feet hooked onto Tyrant Behemoth’s back. At the same time, it opened its mouth and stabbed its tongue into Tyrant Behemoth’s neck like a blood-colored arrow.

Roar! Tyrant Behemoth directly activated Absolute Strength, but the powerful force failed to help it tear apart the web blades. Even though it moved the web blades away from its body, it was unable to tear the web apart.

“Guardians are indeed stronger than Mythical creatures. A Mythical Companion Beast like Tyrant Behemoth is basically the peak of Mythical creatures, but it’s still inferior when fighting Guardians... Zhou Wen will probably suffer greatly this time... Master... Let’s quickly retreat...” Butterfly said to Li Mobai.

Li Mobai didn’t answer. He looked around and couldn’t seem to find his target. He frowned and asked, “Where did Zhou Wen go?”

Everyone was taken aback. Their gazes were attracted by Tyrant Behemoth and the Guardian. They were watching the battle and didn’t notice where Zhou Wen had gone.

They looked around, but they didn’t see Zhou Wen. All they saw was a golden and white bird on a stone not far away. They were watching Tyrant Behemoth and the Guardian fight.

At that moment, Zhou Wen was wearing the Invisibility Cloak and had activated the Sigh of the King. Not long after, his strength reached the level of activating Slaughterer. Without any hesitation, he activated the Wheel of Destiny of the Invisibility Cloak and secretly approached the Guardian with Demonic Neonate.

The invisibility ability of the Invisibility Cloak was just so useful. The Guardian failed to discover the invisible Zhou Wen. It was lying on Tyrant Behemoth’s back and using its tongue to devour the energy in Tyrant Behemoth’s body.

Zhou Wen had already reached its back, but it still failed to notice him. Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the Light Concealment Sword and slashed at the Guardian’s neck with Immortal Slaying.

Almost at the same time, Demonic Neonate in his arms unsheathed her demon sword and slashed at the Guardian’s neck. The two swords slashed down like scissors. At such a close distance, the Guardian had no time to react.

Li Mobai and company didn’t discover any traces of Zhou Wen, but they suddenly heard a tragic cry. When they turned their heads, they realized that Zhou Wen was floating in the air. The Guardian had been beheaded and its head had fallen to the ground.

Plop!

The Guardian’s headless corpse fell from the sky and collapsed to the ground.

The fine web blade on Tyrant Behemoth’s body vanished as well. Zhou Wen carefully floated in the air and flicked his palm as though he was flicking away the blood.

Butterfly, Gu Lou, and company were already shocked speechless. This was because they couldn’t see the invisible Light Concealment Sword. They imagined that Zhou Wen had cleaved off the Guardian’s head with one palm.
