Chapter 1486 Grandson

“What’s there to be proud of?” Liu Yun muttered as he followed Jing Daoxian into the yard.

When they arrived in the yard, Jing Daoxian’s expression changed when he saw the metal column that the giant bear had stabbed into the wall. “Someone was here before us.”

With that said, Jing Daoxian walked to the wall and reached out to gently stroke the exposed parts of the metal column. At the same time, he carefully sized it up.

“It should be Teacher, right? It looks like you’re one step too late,” Liu Yun said gloatingly.

“Whose grandson are you?” Jing Daoxian glared at him.

“Who knows if you’re bluffing me. How do I know that you’re telling the truth?” Liu Yun curled his lips.

“If you weren’t my only grandchild, I would have already slapped you to death,” Jing Daoxian said coldly. Then, he released his hand that was caressing the metal column and took two steps back. “I’m afraid I’ll disappoint you. It’s not Wang Mingyuan. Wang Mingyuan wouldn’t do something so senseless.”

Zhou Wen was stunned. Eldest Senior Brother Liu Yun is actually Jing Daoxian’s grandson? It’s no wonder I had a nagging feeling that something was amiss-why is Liu Yun always with Jing Daoxian? That explains it! After his shock, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but feel a burning desire for gossip. Liu Yun is sing Daoxian’s grandson, so who’s his grandmother? Didn’t they say that Jing Daoxian didn’t marry and have children?

“What’s senseless?” Liu Yun asked.

“This metal column is called the Mountain-Driving Whip. It should have been something good, but unfortunately, this one is fake. The person who came before us realized that this metal column was fake and flew into a rage, smashing it into the wall. With Wang Mingyuan’s personality, he definitely wouldn’t do such a thing,” Jing Daoxian said.

“That’s true. If it’s Teacher, he would put it back when he discovers that it’s fake,” said Liu Yun.

Jing Daoxian gave a strange smile. “That’s also possible. However, if I were to guess, I believe he would take away this fake Mountain-Driving Whip.”

“Why?” Liu Yun asked in puzzlement.

“Because I will do the same,” Jing Daoxian said as he reached out to pull out the metal column.

It was difficult to stick the metal column in, but it was equally difficult to pull it out. Jing Daoxian pulled a few times, but the metal column seemed to be firmly stuck in the wall.

“Since it’s fake, why waste time pulling it out?” Liu Yun asked again.

“You don’t understand.” Jing Daoxian summoned a Companion Beast. Zhou Wen could tell that it was a humanoid Companion Beast. Without Truth Listener’s augmentation, he couldn’t turn the sound he heard into an image. All he could do was make a general judgment. With the help of the humanoid Companion Beast, the metal column was slowly pulled out

Jing Daoxian used some unknown method to stroke the metal pillar, causing it to vanish.

“It’s about time. If we don’t get down to business, I’m afraid we will lose our lives here when that bear returns,” said Liu Yun.

“That Luck Stone should be on the west side of the main hall. You can see it if you take a look,” Jing Daoxian said. Liu Yun walked west and immediately saw the stone platform, calabash, and Zhou Wen. Now that Zhou Wen was in the form of a stone beast, Liu Yun naturally couldn’t recognize him. He was even given a fright as he pointed at Zhou Wen and said, “That’s strange. Didn’t you say that the Luck Stone is with a treasure calabash? Why is there a stone beast there? Could it be that there’s a Luck Beast that comes with it?”

“What Luck Beast?” Jing Daoxian frowned slightly as he walked to Liu Yun’s side and was slightly taken aback when he saw the stone beast Zhou Wen had transformed into. “Strange. The Luck Stone is a stone roller used by Taishang Laojun to grind medicine. The treasure calabash is used to store pills, but I’ve never heard of any guardian beast. Even if there is one, it should be a child guarding the furnace. It shouldn’t be such a strange stone beast…” As Jing Daoxian sized up Zhou Wen, he pondered and said, “Furthermore, this stone beast looks somewhat similar to that bear…” Zhou Wen thought to himself, I don’t think Jing Daoxian has seen the baby bear before. The baby bear doesn’t resemble the giant bear either. To be able to tell, Jing Daoxian’s eyes are indeed a little sharp.

“Who cares? Anyway, what you want is the Luck Stone and the treasure calabash. Just take them away,” Liu Yun said as he moved the stone calabash.

However, after exerting some strength, the calabash remained motionless. Liu Yun exerted so much strength that the veins on his forehead protruded.

“Don’t waste your efforts. Although the treasure calabash isn’t a purple-gold calabash, it’s no ordinary item. It won’t be easy to take it away. If we could use brute force to take it away, the people who came before us would have long done so without giving us a chance.” Jing Daoxian paused before saying, “From the looks of it, we came at the right time. These are all genuine.”

“Do you have a solution?” Liu Yun asked.

“These two treasures are used for alchemy. If you want to take them away, you naturally have to work from a pill angle,” Jing Daoxian said as he took out something

It was a small bottle that was only the size of a palm. Jing Daoxian carefully opened the bottle and poured out a tiny pill before throwing it at the stone calabash.

The stone calabash that would only react in the morning suddenly shimmered with golden light as it sucked in the tiny pill.

Jing Daoxian threw the tiny bottle to Liu Yun. “Feed that calabash with a pill every ten minutes. In a few hours, you should be able to move the treasure calabash.”

“Why don’t you feed it yourself?” Liu Yun seemed to enjoy arguing with Jing Daoxian.

Jing Daoxian said indifferently, “If that bear returns, I’ll have to think of a way to stop it outside. We have to be wary of the people from before in the event that they haven’t left.”

“Didn’t you say that there aren’t more than five creatures on Earth who can fight that bear? And none of them are human? Then how are you going to stop it?” Liu Yun was puzzled.

“Silly child, you sometimes have to use your brain. Something that can’t be done with brute force might be easily done with some trivial means. In short, stay here and feed that treasure calabash. No matter what happens outside, don’t come out,” Jing Daoxian said as he walked out the door and closed it.

“Who knows if all these opinionated things you say are true.” As Liu Yun muttered, he waited before throwing a pill at the calabash.

Strangely, every time he threw a pill and pushed the treasure calabash, he felt that it was a little lighter.

“Old man, are you outside?” Liu Yun was a person who couldn’t sit idle. After waiting for a while, he felt bored and shouted outside.

No one answered him. Liu Yun asked a few times, but when Jing Daoxian didn’t respond, he stopped shouting, probably because his voice couldn’t be heard. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Liu Yun’s eyes darted as he looked at Zhou Wen. As though he had thought of something fun, he got up and walked towards him.

Holy sh*t, what are you going to do? Zhou Wen immediately felt that things were going south, but he couldn’t move or make a sound. He couldn’t do anything but watch as Liu Yun walked to his side.
