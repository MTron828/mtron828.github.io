Chapter 1534: Another Samsara Stone

“It’s best you don’t touch this thing.” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to be nosy as he exhorted Grim Demon not to touch anything else. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Grim Demon also felt a lingering fear. Even if he was made to touch it again, he wouldn’t dare do so.

“This place should be relatively safe. Let’s stay here for the time being. Go and ask what’s on the other side of the mountain.” Zhou Wen got Grim Demon to gather information while he gamed in the cemetery.

Tyrant Behemoth was close to advancing to the Calamity grade thanks to having a large number of solid Essence Energy Crystals being fed to it.

After Grim Demon left, Zhou Wen repeatedly grinded Dubhe Palace. Although he still couldn’t withstand the power of the purple blast of light, he gained a deeper understanding of the abilities of the amethyst-armored creature.

Unless the Chaos Egg can advance to the Calamity grade, it will be very difficult for it to withstand the power of the light blast. I have to think of another way.?Zhou Wen was thinking of a way to kill the amethyst-armored creature in a short period of time. In that case, it didn’t matter even if the Chaos Egg couldn’t last long.

As he pondered, he moved solid Essence Energy crystals into Tyrant Behemoth’s mouth, but he suddenly couldn’t move anymore. Before Zhou Wen could figure out what was going on, the Chaos Egg exploded.

Without entering the dungeon again, Zhou Wen opened Tyrant Behemoth’s information and realized that it had indeed entered an Evolved state.

Without a glutton like Tyrant Behemoth to hold out and with no Companion Beast being able to digest so many Essence Energy Crystals, the Chaos Egg will only last for a shorter period of time.?

Tyrant Behemoth’s evolution into the Calamity grade was a good thing, but before it advanced successfully, Zhou Wen had to think of other solutions.

Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate. She had been sleeping the entire time, looking like a normal sleeping person. There were no signs of a Companion Beast’s evolution, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t wake her up.

Grim Demon returned after a while. It was unknown what method he used, but he had already figured out the situation here.

The people from Regretless City didn’t go too far from it. Their only food was some plants on the mountain. Some had entered the mountain range, but most of them died inside. It was unknown how they died.

“From the looks of it, there are Terror-grade creatures in the mountain range. They are only ordinary people, so they naturally can’t see Terror-grade creatures.” Grim Demon paused before continuing, “However, someone once saw a terrifying scene in the mountain range. Countless large snakes swam through the mountain. One of them was a red snake that was coiled on a mountain peak. Its body was even bigger than the mountain peak. From their description, it’s similar to the snake that Satan transformed into when he tempted Adam and Eve.”

“It’s not going to be easy leaving the mountain range. Even if we successfully leave, we might not be able to find a way back. Let’s stay here for the time being. When Neonate wakes up, we’ll see if she has any way of taking us back,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“We should have done that from the beginning.” Grim Demon paused before saying, “When I was reading the memories of the citizens, I discovered something. Although this place is protected by the Lost Paradise, it’s not in the Lost Paradise after all. Occasionally, dimensional creatures will come to the city and eat quite a number of people. It’s probably that snake.”

“From the looks of it, it’s not safe here. I hope Neonate can wake up as soon as possible.” Zhou Wen felt that Demonic Neonate likely had a way to take them back.

After all, the Heaven Shrouding Bell was in Demonic Neonate’s hands. Previously, Ice Maiden had used the Heaven Shrouding Bell to travel through space and reach the buffer zone between Earth’s universe and the dimension.

Zhou Wen continued gaming and grinding dungeons. Grim Demon didn’t have anyone to talk to. It almost drove him mad.

After less than two days, Grim Demon couldn’t help but tell Zhou Wen that he was going deep into the mountain range to scout and see if there was any other way out.

After Grim Demon left, Zhou Wen continued grinding dungeons every day. After killing the Golden Sniper again, he suddenly heard a chime. The sound was different from the usual dimensional crystals dropping, nor did it sound like a Companion Egg.

Samsara Stone!?When Zhou Wen saw what it was, he was immediately overjoyed.

After grinding for so long, this was the second Samsara Stone. He had given the previous one to the Great Might Vajra Bull. Back then, Zhou Wen didn’t know what use the Samsara Stone had and was only experimenting.

Zhou Wen now knew that the Samsara Stone gave unevolvable Companion Beasts an Evolvable attribute. Furthermore, their stats might be enhanced to a certain extent. They might even awaken some new skills.

Zhou Wen had many good Companion Beasts, but because they didn’t have an Evolvable attribute, their levels couldn’t be raised. They no longer satisfied Zhou Wen’s current needs.

He couldn’t bear to use such rare special pets for fusion. But if he didn’t do so, they were useless, collecting dust. With the Samsara Stone, the Companion Beasts were redeemed.

Let me see which Companion Beast to use.?Zhou Wen hoped to raise many Companion Beasts, but there was only one Samsara Stone. He had to make a choice.

The Death Harbinger Crow’s skill is actually very useful. If it were to use the Samsara Stone, it might be able to evolve into a powerful Companion Beast. Medusa isn’t bad either. She doesn’t seem to be of much use now, but after she evolves, her skills might become especially powerful. There’s also the Ancient Splitting Tadpole. If it can evolve to the Calamity grade, I wonder how powerful its Split Explosion ability will be…?Zhou Wen sorted out his Companion Beasts and realized that there were too many Companion Beasts that needed the Samsara Stone. He was momentarily unsure.

Zhou Wen thought for a while before finally choosing to give the Samsara Stone to Doctor Darkness.

Zhou Wen actually liked Doctor Darkness’s skills very much. Furthermore, it had a soul state. It could be attached to Zhou Wen and all the skills could be used by him.

However, his level was too low. He couldn’t keep up with Zhou Wen’s current level and combat needs. Furthermore, he didn’t have an Evolvable attribute. Zhou Wen had always wanted to raise his level.

“Then let’s do Doctor Darkness.” Zhou Wen summoned Doctor Darkness and handed the Samsara Stone to him.

After using the Samsara Stone, Doctor Darkness’s body immediately underwent a magical change. Instead of calling it a change, it was more like molting.

The Mythical Doctor Darkness quickly molted and reached the starting Mortal stage.

Doctor Darkness, who was at the Mortal stage, looked rather adorable. He was a handsome boy who looked to be about five or six years old. He was deadpan like a robot. He wore a black robe and didn’t look like a doctor. Instead, he looked like a priest.

He opened Doctor Darkness’s stats and indeed, he had returned to the Mortal stage.
