Chapter 720: Comfort Only When Thrown Out

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen decided to give it another try. Gods Retreat had already reached its peak. It couldn’t continue improving even in Netherworld City.

If the power of Teacher Square could really allow Gods Retreat to advance to a Perfect Body, it would be Zhou Wen’s first Perfect Body Life Soul.

When it was the recital session at Teacher Square, Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and walked towards it.

When Sister Gui saw that Zhou Wen had mostly recovered from his injuries, she said with a smile, “This time, make sure not to circulate a Daoist Essence Energy Art when you step into Teacher Square.”

Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say.

The others laughed. After recuperating here for a few days, they had basically recognized Zhou Wen and knew about his embarrassing use of a Daoist Essence Energy Art on Teacher Square.

Just as she was about to say something, the recital session began.

A mysterious force enveloped Teacher Square. Everyone suddenly sat down and began to recite an article in all seriousness—one that they didn’t understand.

Zhou Wen was one of them, but just as he started reciting, he switched his Essence Energy Art to Dao Sutra.

Boom!

As though he was struck in the soul, Zhou Wen felt his soul tremble as his body involuntarily flew out. He slammed onto the stone steps and rolled a distance before he managed to control his body.

His injuries were worse than before, but Zhou Wen was pleased to discover that the jade infant’s injuries were much lighter than the previous time. After the previous injury, his resistance seemed to have improved significantly.

Could it be that this method really works? Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.

An hour later, Sister Gui and company came down from Teacher Square and passed by Zhou Wen, who was recuperating. Sister Gui said in a speechless manner, “Little Zhou, didn’t I tell you that you can’t use Daoist Essence Energy Arts on Teacher Square? Why didn’t you listen to me? I won’t harm you.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Zhou Wen hurriedly said, “Sister Gui, I know that I can’t use Daoist Essence Energy Arts on Teacher Square, but I have a bad temper. The more I’m not allowed to do it, the more I have to do it.”

“Child...” Sister Gui was instantly rendered speechless.

“Sister Gui, don’t bother about him. There’s something wrong with this kid’s brain.”

“That’s right. Who cares what he’s doing? He’s just looking for trouble. I think it’s because life in the Federation is too good that there are so many young people out there looking for trouble.”

“Young people have never endured suffering. It’s understandable why they want to seek out excitement. I was the same when I was young. My mom said that girls will have children when they sleep with men. I didn’t listen to her, and I ended up giving birth...”

From then on, there was an additional young man with an antelope and chick on Mount Confucius’s Teacher Square. In the beginning, he was sent flying every two to three days.

Later on, it became worse. He was sent flying daily during the recital session on Teacher Square because of his circulation of a Daoist Essence Energy Art as though he would feel uncomfortable if he didn’t get thrown out.

Sister Gui tried persuading him at first, but Zhou Wen didn’t listen. She got used to it over time.

After the recital, a young girl left with Sister Gui. When they passed by Zhou Wen who was lying by the roadside, the girl looked at him and said to her, “Sister Gui, do you think that Little Zhou is silly? Why does he have to go against Teacher Square for no reason? Isn’t he just looking for trouble? He really has nothing better to do.”

Sister Gui smiled and said, “How is Little Zhou silly? He’s such a good lad. I think he has his reasons for doing so.”

“What reason could there be? I think he’s just bored.” The young girl paused before continuing, “Why is there such a senseless person? If everyone was like Xu Tong, the Federation’s land wouldn’t be constantly devoured by dimensional zones.”

As she spoke, the young girl couldn’t help but look at the youth in front of her.

The young man had an imposing appearance. He had sword-like eyebrows and bright eyes. He was indeed a very handsome young man.

Xu Tong was very famous at Five Dragons Mouth. He cultivated Righteous Energy and had advanced to the Epic stage at the age of twenty-seven. In this region, no one was better than Xu Tong.

It was understandable that Xu Tong could win the girl’s admiration.

Sister Gui said with a smile, “Xu Tong is not bad, but there are many outstanding girls around outstanding men. Why don’t you consider Little Zhou? I think that young lad is pretty good. He looks quite handsome and is about the same age as you. No one is vying with you for him yet.”

“Tch, I don’t fancy such a senseless man. If I want to find a boyfriend, I have to find an outstanding man like Xu Tong.” The girl curled her lips and turned her head to look at Zhou Wen who was lying on the mountain path. No matter how she looked at him, he was far inferior to the dignified and refined Xu Tong.

Sister Gui said with a faint smile, “It’s understandable that little girls like men like Xu Tong. When you reach my age, you might feel that some special men might be more interesting.”

“Perhaps. However, I won’t find such a man interesting at any time.” The girl didn’t find Zhou Wen interesting when she saw him sleeping on the mountain path. His clothes were disheveled and there was a chick skipping around him. He resembled a wandering performer.

Days passed. Every time the jade infant was struck, Zhou Wen would have the illusion that he was about to break through. Although this feeling was very real, no matter how realistic it was, it was still an illusion. He couldn’t advance to a Perfect Body.

Strange. I clearly feel that I can advance to a Perfect Body, so why haven’t I advanced? What’s the difference? Zhou Wen kept pondering over this question.

After some thought, Zhou Wen thought of a possibility.

Back then, Zero Taboo was a crystalline body. After the crystal exploded, the Gods Retreat jade infant was born.

Zhou Wen was wondering if it was possible that the jade infant needed to be destroyed before it could advance to a Perfect Body. This explained the reason why he felt that he was about to break through every time the jade infant was injured.

However, as the jade infant’s body healed, the feeling of a breakthrough vanished.

After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that there was only one possibility. However, it was too risky to shatter the jade infant. If his guess was wrong and the jade infant was really destroyed, he would be doomed. He would have to condense the Life Soul again.

Therefore, Zhou Wen was still hesitant about giving the jade infant a try.

It was time for the recital session again. When Sister Gui and company arrived at Teacher Square, many people greeted Zhou Wen. As Zhou Wen had been here for more than two weeks, the people who often came to Teacher Square were already familiar with him.

However, most people felt that Zhou Wen was a little silly and only wanted to joke with him. They didn’t have any ill intentions.

Sister Gui got Zhou Wen to head to Teacher Square with her as she asked, “Little Zhou, are you still circulating the Daoist Essence Energy Art today?”

“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded.

Everyone waited on Teacher Square for the recital session to begin. Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to chat, so Sister Gui and the girl beside her chatted.
