Chapter 1774 Open Trap

The human man tied to the pillar was none other than Wang Mingyuan.

Zhou Wen’s first thought was that the Immortals had learned of his joint kill with Wang Mingyuan because the beautiful woman standing beside the pillar looked like an Immortal.

Before Zhou Wen could think further, the Immortal woman struck Wang Mingyuan with her whip. The invisible whip left a new bloody mark on Wang Mingyuan’s tattered clothes.

His crystalline flesh split open as blood seeped into his tattered clothes. It sent a chill deep into one’s heart. Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!

The fairy lashed at Wang Mingyuan again and again, causing more and more bloody wounds to appear on his body. Wang Mingyuan’s expression didn’t change, but Zhou Wen’s expression turned extremely ugly.

The bronze lion that had attempted the level previously roared and charged at the fairy, but it was struck by the fairy. The seemingly powerful bronze beast body was torn apart by the whip. The Cube’s screen also vanished.

Zhou Wen’s expression was nasty as he stared at the black Cube’s screen without moving for a long time.

The divine mountain was in the dimension. Apart from entering through the Cube, creatures from the dimension could enter without using the Cube.

The appearance of the fairy and Wang Mingyuan didn’t surprise Zhou Wen, but the meaning behind it made him uneasy.

When the Immortals discovered that Wang Mingyuan had betrayed them, they could have directly executed him or even imprisoned him for torturing

However, now that they had sent Wang Mingyuan to the divine mountain to whip him, allowing everyone to see it through the Cube. It was clearly not as simple as torturing Wang Mingyuan.

Zhou Wen even believed that the Immortals’ goal was to force him to save Wang Mingyuan and take the opportunity to eliminate him.

Knowing of such a possibility was one thing, but Zhou Wen couldn’t stand seeing Wang Mingyuan being treated this way without doing anything

Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about how to save Wang Mingyuan, someone was one step ahead of him.

The Cube lit up again. Someone had launched a new round of attempts. The person attempting the level was Zhong Ziya, who had already appeared once and left his name on the rankings.

Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange when he saw Zhong Ziya. He had always been such a person. He appeared arrogant and unyielding, but he was the person who cared the most about his teacher, Wang Mingyuan.

Zhong Ziya is indeed the same Zhong Ziya. He has grown up, but his original intention has never changed. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

If the Immortals were really targeting him, Zhou Wen, and it was under the condition that they knew that he had obtained the help of the golden Three-Eyed God, they must have made all the necessary preparations on the divine mountain. Or rather, with the Apocalypse-grade holding the fort, Zhong Ziya was probably doomed.

Zhou Wen already planned on using spatial teleportation to head to the divine mountain. He couldn’t let Zhong Ziya die for nothing.

“Zhou Wen, don’t be in a rush to go.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to teleport over, he suddenly heard a familiar voice. Turning his head, he saw Jiang Yan standing not far from the Cube.

Jiang Yan was still as quiet as before. There was nothing different about him. Time didn’t seem to leave any marks on him.

“Zhong Ziya shouldn’t have gone. I…” Zhou Wen wanted to explain, but he was interrupted by Jiang Yan.

“I know what you are getting at. This is an open trap, but it leaves one no choice but to go.” Jiang Yan looked at Zhong Ziya who was walking up the divine mountain and said, “However, I think you should believe Ya. Since he’s gone, he won’t just be throwing himself to his death.”

“The golden Three-Eyed God I obtained is at the Apocalypse grade.” Zhou Wen pointed out the main point. He knew that Zhong Ziya was very strong, but this trap might be targeted at the Apocalypse grade. No matter how powerful Zhong Ziya was, he wasn’t at the Apocalypse grade, making him far inferior.

“You know this, I know it, and Ya knows it very well. Ya got me to tell you to just watch. If needed, he will seek our help. It won’t be too late to go when the time comes. Let’s wait and see. You have your path, and he has his. Let him take his path first,” Jiang Yan said.

Since Zhong Ziya had said that, Zhou Wen had no choice but to hold back his anxiety and watch him walk up the divine mountain.

After arriving at the mountaintop, they saw that the fairy and Wang Mingyuan were still there. The fairy was still whipping Wang Mingyuan. Wang Mingyuan was already covered in injuries from the whipping. His clothes had turned into a blood-colored beggar outfit. He looked like he was on his last breath and the situation wasn’t good. On the square in front of the temple, there were still remnants of the bronze lion’s torn corpse.

The humans watching the livestream were discussing spiritedly and even cursing indignantly. Many people recognized Wang Mingyuan. Even those who had never seen him before gritted their teeth in hatred after hearing the host’s introduction.

From the point of view of the average person, Wang Mingyuan was undoubtedly a traitorthe most shameless human traitor.

“Serves him right. Such a person should have died a long time ago. The heavens are blind to let him live to this day.”

“Humph, traitors indeed don’t have a good ending. Do you think you can enjoy wealth just because you submitted to the dimension? Aren’t you still going to be killed by those fellows from the dimension?”

“This is the first time I’ve seen a human being tortured by alien races. Whip him a few more times and kill that bastard.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Many people wished they could do the honors of whipping Wang Mingyuan twice or watch him die with their own eyes.

Seeing Zhong Ziya walk to the temple, the fairy who was whipping Wang Mingyuan finally stopped and turned to look at him.

“You… shouldn’t have come…” Wang Mingyuan also raised his pale face and said weakly.

“There’s nothing about whether I should or should not. I came because I felt like it. I’ll leave if I don’t feel like it. No one can stop me,” Zhong Ziya said indifferently, but he didn’t stop walking. He continued walking towards Wang Mingyuan.

“You are Ya, the president of that whatever association who killed many Guardians and representatives, right?” The fairy glanced at Ya and asked without any expression.

With that said, the people watching the livestream were alarmed. Only then did they realize that Zhong Ziya was Ya.

“I want to take him away. Are you stopping me?” Zhong Ziya carried his sword and had a smile on his lips. His eyes seemed to be covered in a layer of mist as he smiled at the fairy.

“I won’t stop you, but you have to leave your life behind,” the fairy said expressionlessly.

“That’s simple, but you need to seek permission from the sword in my hand. If it accepts, you can do whatever you want with me.” As Zhong Ziya spoke, he suddenly sped up. At the same time, he unsheathed the sword that was resting on his shoulder and stabbed at the beautiful fairy with a startling beam.
