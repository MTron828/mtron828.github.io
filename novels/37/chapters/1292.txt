Chapter 1293: Immortal Break

Translator: CKtalon

When Zhou Wen’s palm touched the armor on Immortal’s head, an unbelievable scene happened. Their bodies strangely swapped.

This swapping didn’t refer to exchanging bodies, but their positions.

Zhou Wen’s palm had originally struck the top of Immortal’s head, but Immortal was already powerless to dodge. However, now, Zhou Wen was standing in Immortal’s original spot, while Immortal appeared in Zhou Wen’s spot.

Even their actions were identical. Zhou Wen stood there with his hands far from his head. As for Immortal’s palm, it had already struck Zhou Wen’s head.

Everyone felt their hearts turn cold. Immortal was also proficient in the art of swapping. It was very similar to Zhou Wen’s Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping. However, his swapping was done together with his opponent. Therefore, it was somewhat different from Zhou Wen’s Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.

As everything had happened too suddenly, it was too late for Zhou Wen to use Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping. Immortal’s palm had already pressed down on his head.

Bang!

Immortal slapped down, but he realized that he had struck the Son of Heaven’s Sword that had been swapped. He sent the Son of Heaven’s Sword flying and couldn’t help but be alarmed.

As Immortal was proficient in similar techniques, he knew that this swapping technique needed to be prepared ahead of time. Zhou Wen had clearly made such preparations to be able to swap the Son of Heaven’s Sword.

Immortal’s expression changed slightly. If all of this had been within Zhou Wen’s calculations, he would be in danger.

Just as Immortal was about to move, he felt an intense pain coming from the back of his head. His head felt like it had exploded as his body involuntarily fell forward.

As for Zhou Wen, despite being clearly far away, he had swapped to the spot where the Son of Heaven’s Sword had been, but an invisible avatar seemed to strike the back of Immortal’s head. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Zhou Wen had actually used Spacetime Bandit to produce a delayed Ashen Palm.

After Immortal switched to Zhou Wen’s position and attacked him, he naturally took Zhou Wen’s spot, just in time to be hit by the delayed Ashen Palm in the back of his head.

Despite all his calculations, he was still one step short—he was struck by Ashen Palm. The strange force penetrated the halo and helmet around him and nearly burst his brain.

This was only because Zhou Wen’s Ashen Palm was only at the Mythical stage. Although it contained the power of the Terror-grade Singularity Universe, it was ultimately lacking. Otherwise, this strike might really have wrecked Immortal’s brain.

Ashen Palm was a skill that Zhou Wen had often used in his early days, but with more powerful skills, he seldom used it. His level had risen to the Mythical stage without any special cultivation.

Even so, the extremely soft characteristic of Ashen Palm could still help some of Singularity Universe’s powers penetrate Immortal’s defenses.

All of this was a wordy description, but it all happened in a split second. The Terror-grade experts could still see the gist of it. The ordinary humans only saw Zhou Wen strike Immortal’s head before Immortal was sent flying.

Just as Immortal was sent flying, Zhou Wen instant transmitted over and unleashed a barrage of attacks at Immortal. He wanted to strike while he was down.

With Immortal’s brain injured, it was probably difficult for him to react. This was the best opportunity to kill him.

Zhou Wen was right. Unless a creature didn’t need a brain to think, once their brain was severely damaged, death was basically certain in such a battle. Having thoughts and becoming demented weren’t even needed in the picture.

However, Immortal actually endured the pain in his brain and reacted instinctively.

Although he couldn’t block all of Zhou Wen’s attacks, he protected his head, preventing Zhou Wen from hitting it again.

Zhou Wen struck Immortal on the arm, sending him flying again. His other palm struck his chest as he instant transmitted again and repeatedly struck him in midair.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Zhou Wen struck the godlike, haloed Immortal again and again, sending him flying as he spewed out blood.

The final palm strike made Immortal disappear. It was as if it had struck Immortal into nothingness. Immortal disappeared just like that.

People stared blankly at the Cube’s screen, momentarily at a loss as to how to react.

Of the two strongest factions on Earth, the Holy Spirit Association and the League of Guardians, the former’s president had his heart pierced through by Zhou Wen. It was unknown if he was dead or alive. The League of Guardians’ Lord Immortal had also been reduced to nothingness.

“He’s so f*cking strong!” It was unknown who said this, but this sentence became the most commonly used adjective to describe experts in the future.

The title of Deceit King also officially resounded across Earth and the dimension.

Zhou Wen naturally knew that he hadn’t been able to kill Immortal in the end. Under such circumstances, Immortal instinctively protected his vital spots. When he was capable of thinking, he used a void mystic technique to escape.

What a powerful fellow.?Zhou Wen marveled inwardly. If he encountered Immortal again, the same move would definitely be useless.

This time, it was Immortal’s miscalculation. It was also because he didn’t know that Zhou Wen was adept at Spacetime Bandit. It would be impossible for him to injure Immortal again the next time he used it.

I have to practice Ashen Palm well. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll smack him into an idiot. In comparison, I still like harmless idiots, not smart people.?Without sparing the Holy Spirit Association on Venus a glance, he returned to Earth.

He naturally didn’t kill Ya. Not only did he not kill him, but he even used the power of Human Sovereign to treat Ya’s injuries.

The Son of Heaven’s Sword couldn’t be unsheathed, nor did it have the ability to kill. It was similar to holding an iron rod, but it was surprisingly compatible with the power of Human Sovereign.

The power of Human Sovereign could typically be used by Zhou Wen’s fist. It was very difficult to transmit it through weapons. The Son of Heaven’s Sword was currently the only weapon that could work well with the power of Human Sovereign.

However, for some reason, the Son of Heaven’s Sword could transmit the power of Human Sovereign, but it was still impossible to unsheath it.

The strike that Zhou Wen had stabbed through Zhong Ziya’s chest looked like it had killed him, but in fact, it had treated his injuries. However, outsiders couldn’t tell. Even if they later learned that Zhong Ziya was still alive, they would only write it off as Zhong Ziya’s life-saving mystic technique and wouldn’t suspect Zhou Wen.

After this battle, the name of Deceit King spread across Earth. The battle between him and Immortal was analyzed frame by frame by the various factions. It was a bizarre battle that could be described as textbook material.

After all sorts of slow playback analysis, people realized that so many things had happened in the blink of an eye. Immortal and Deceit King had pulled off all sorts of schemes and psychological games, but in the end, it was still Deceit King who had the last laugh.

However, even the reaction of Immortal’s defeat could be considered textbook material.. Many colleges later used the analysis videos of this battle to educate students on the difference between using brute force and using techniques to fight.
