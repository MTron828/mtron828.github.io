Chapter 1173: You’re Right

The Demon God Chart on the Wheel of Destiny increasingly resembled Zhou Wen, but Zhou Wen’s body was becoming more and more like Tsukuyomi. This wasn’t just a change in appearance, even his Essence Energy attribute was beginning to change towards Tsukuyomi’s.

However, because Tsukuyomi’s order in life was too high, Zhou Wen wasn’t able to completely replicate it. He focused on replicating Tsukuyomi’s Essence Energy attribute, so his body wasn’t completely the same as Tsukuyomi’s.

However, when the symbol on the Wheel of Destiny completely transformed into Zhou Wen’s appearance, the Demon God Body instantly broke through some restrictions and transformed into a state identical to Tsukuyomi’s. The two of them were like twins. Even Monkey Sun with his fiery eyes and golden pupils probably couldn’t tell the difference.

Zhou Wen extended his palm and pressed it on Tsukuyomi’s back, injecting his Essence Energy into her body.

Now, his Essence Energy attribute was identical to Tsukuyomi’s. He directly injected it into her body like water entering the ocean. It directly fused with hers without causing any discomfort.

If Zhou Wen was only an ordinary Terror-grade, his Essence Energy would be useless at helping a Calamity-grade.

However, Zhou Wen had Slaughterer’s massive amounts of Essence Energy and the Heaven-Opening Scripture’s ultra-fast recovery of Essence Energy. The combination of the Essence Energy output and the fact that his body had turned into Tsukuyomi’s Calamity body had quite an effect on the Calamity-grade Tsukuyomi.

Zhou Wen was far inferior to a Calamity-grade in every other aspect, but in terms of Essence Energy, he was able to be of some use.

Tsukuyomi’s Moonlight Domain brightened significantly. Although she didn’t turn the tides, she stabilized the situation. Not Heaven’s ghostly aura didn’t continue its domination.

“Interesting...” Not only was Not Heaven not angry, but he also sized up Zhou Wen with interest.

With Zhou Wen’s support, Tsukuyomi only stabilized the situation. Furthermore, Not Heaven’s Calamity Domain was constantly growing stronger.

“He seems to be able to use the power of this palace. There’s no chance of defeating him here. Think of a way to rush out.” Ice Maiden saw the problem and told Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.

Zhou Wen naturally noticed as well, but if he could escape, he would have long done so. Why would he wait until now? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Even Tsukuyomi couldn’t rush out of a god-forsaken place like the Shinra Temple, let alone him.

As time passed, the ghostly aura once again suppressed the Moonlight Domain. As for Zhou Wen, he had to keep up his transformation and inject Essence Energy into Tsukuyomi. He was already at his limits.

“What’s your name?” Not Heaven suddenly looked at Tsukuyomi and asked.

“Tsukuyomi.” Tsukuyomi asked, “And who are you?”

“Not Heaven.” Not Heaven reported his name and continued, “I’ve been asleep for too long. I never expected to encounter such a powerful creature the moment I woke up. How many existences like you are on Earth?”

“Why should I answer you?” Tsukuyomi said indifferently.

Not Heaven didn’t get angry and continued, “Based on your strength, there should be quite a number of Calamity-grade creatures on Earth. If I leave the Shinra Temple, with you guys as cover, I might not be discovered. Therefore, there’s no need for us to fight to the death.”

“And then?” Tsukuyomi knew that it wasn’t that Not Heaven wanted a truce. Otherwise, he could have stopped at any time, considering how he had already gained the absolute advantage.

“I want this human. You can take the rest away. Shall we end this?” Not Heaven pointed at Zhou Wen.

“No,” Tsukuyomi said directly.

“I know what you want from him. Don’t worry, I have a solution. Since he doesn’t agree, we can also let the token do its job and let you complete the contract. You can stay on Earth without any restrictions,” Not Heaven said again.

Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that the reason Tsukuyomi hadn’t attacked him was because of the Heavenly Happiness Token. If Not Heaven could do what he claimed, would Tsukuyomi have any qualms about protecting him?

“That thing can’t be contracted by force,” Tsukuyomi said.

“Of course it can’t be resolved by force. However, back when I was in the dimension, I once heard from an Apocalyptic existence that there’s a way to reach a contract without the permission of the owner,” Not Heaven said. “When the time comes, I’ll get the person and you can take the token. We’ll get what we need, so why fight with our lives?”

“What method?” Tsukuyomi asked.

Zhou Wen felt that things were going south. With Tsukuyomi around, he still had a chance of turning the tables. If Tsukuyomi allied with Not Heaven, he would probably die today.

Even if he could pull out the Immortal Culling Sword again, the single sword wouldn’t be able to kill two Calamity-grade creatures.

“The method is a little complicated, but as long as you agree to withdraw, I can help you complete the contract and let you obtain that token,” Not Heaven said.

This condition was extremely tempting. If Zhou Wen was Tsukuyomi, he really couldn’t think of a reason to reject it.

Zhou Wen retracted his palm and left his transformed state, allowing his Essence Energy to recover. At the same time, he secretly held the Immortal Culling Sword. He was already prepared to give his all.

“What if I don’t agree?” Tsukuyomi’s words left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback.

Not Heaven said indifferently, “I doubt you will make such a choice. You have stayed on Earth for too long and your body has been severely damaged. There’s no chance of you defeating me.”

“That might not be the case,” Tsukuyomi said calmly.

“If you forcefully break through the restrictions, you can definitely unleash all your combat strength. It’s hard to say if you can defeat me, but if that’s the case, you will definitely be forced to leave Earth in an extremely short period of time. When that happens, it’s useless even if you have a token. This isn’t what you want. You helped him because you wanted to borrow the power of that token to stay on Earth. Since this is impossible, is there any point in helping him?” Not Heaven smiled and said, “If you cooperate with me, you can stay on Earth without being restrained by him. There are only benefits, so why not? Could it be that you are really willing to leave Earth like this? I think you should know that doing so is almost a path of certain death. If you are willing to take that path, you won’t have to suffer by staying by a human’s side all the time, isn’t that so?”

“You’re right.” Tsukuyomi nodded slightly and turned to look at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen’s heart tightened as he gripped the Immortal Culling Sword he had taken out. At this point, he could fight it out.

“In that case, give him to me. I’ll help you complete the contract. We’ll take what we each need.” Not Heaven seemed to be confident of victory as he wanted to grab Zhou Wen.

Boom!

However, a terrifying force pushed Not Heaven back. Tsukuyomi’s body glowed brightly as moonlight swirled around her. It constantly distorted space, making her look beautiful and demonic.

“You’re right, but I don’t like it,” Tsukuyomi said coldly.
