Chapter 1402: Spacetime Fiend Man

When did this fellow evolve??Zhou Wen didn’t see the metal parts. When he sensed Explosive Fiend Man’s aura, he realized that it had already reached the Terror grade.

After unsummoning Explosive Fiend Man, he used his phone to look at his information.

Explosive Fiend Man: Terror (Evolvable)

Life Providence: Unlawful

Life Soul: Destroyer

Wheel of Destiny: Annihilation

Terror Form: Spacetime Fiend Man

Strength: 82

Speed: 82

Constitution: 82

Essence Energy: 82

Talent Skill: Death List, Time-Blast

Companion Form: Self-detonation Device

Zhou Wen carefully studied his stats. The power of the Wheel of Destiny augmented his explosive power, greatly enhancing his destructive forces.

As for the Terror transformation ability of Spacetime Fiend Man, it was probably tied to the metal parts.

After Zhou Wen carefully studied the notes of Spacetime Fiend Man, he was pleasantly surprised to discover that this was the most terrifying ability of Explosive Fiend Man.

Spacetime Fiend Man was actually an ability similar to resurrection, but it wasn’t true resurrection. Perhaps calling it a replica would be more accurate, but it wasn’t completely accurate.

To put it simply, after Explosive Fiend Man used the Self-detonation Device, he could revive again.

Or rather, Explosive Fiend Man from another spacetime would come to this spacetime and replace the previous Explosive Fiend Man. Unfortunately, in the same spacetime, only one Explosive Fiend Man could exist. Therefore, it was equivalent to a resurrection skill.

With such a Terror transformation ability, Explosive Fiend Man is equivalent to a big boss who can self-destruct infinitely. If I don’t like anyone, I can just send him charging forward and self-destruct…?Zhou Wen knew how terrifying Explosive Fiend Man’s self-destruction was. It was a one-time release of all his energy.

It was very difficult for creatures of the same level to withstand such self-destruction.

Zhou Wen entered the game excitedly, hoping to see how powerful Explosive Fiend Man was.

The Venusian instance dungeon’s cooldown hadn’t ended, so Zhou Wen took Explosive Fiend Man to Yang City, planning on using the Blood Spirits for testing.

When the Blood Spirits appeared, Explosive Fiend Man charged forward under Zhou Wen’s orders. Zhou Wen realized that his actions seemed to have some spatial compression or temporal acceleration effect. He became very fast.

Explosive Fiend Man rushed past a Blood Spirit and reached out to press it down, installing a time bomb. When he pulled away, the time bomb immediately exploded, shattering the Blood Spirit into pieces.

This fellow was like a punctual time bomb installer. Anything touched by his hands would turn into a bomb and detonate its energy. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhou Wen also noticed that when Explosive Fiend Man’s fingers touched something, a purple liquid would drill out. It was likely the liquid in the bottles behind him. The liquid turned whatever he touched into a bomb.

This fellow is a little strong!?Zhou Wen was delighted.

Unless one was faster than Explosive Fiend Man and could avoid contact with him or had a stronger defense, preventing the purple liquid from being effective, anyone he touched would die.

Let’s try the Self-detonation Device. Zhou Wen got Explosive Fiend Man to charge at a Blood Spirit.

As Explosive Fiend Man hugged a Blood Spirit, his body turned into a Self-detonation Device device that enveloped the Blood Spirit’s body. In the next second, there was a boom.

A purple sun rose in Yang City and devoured a large area. Wherever the power of self-destruction passed, everything was reduced to ashes.

Holy sh*t, it’s so powerful! The power of this self-destruction is almost at the Calamity grade!?Zhou Wen was so overjoyed that he could hardly close his mouth.

However, he was somewhat depressed. Although the Spacetime Fiend Man had shown its effects, Explosive Fiend Man couldn’t be revived immediately. He had to wait twenty-four hours.

Forget it. Twenty-four hours is good as long as he can be revived. Otherwise, the Self-detonation Device would be a useless skill. I wouldn’t dare use it in reality. I don’t have so many qualms now.?Zhou Wen was very satisfied.

When the Venusian instance dungeon refreshed, Zhou Wen entered it again and activated the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation.

When the Calamity-grade bullets shot in front of Zhou Wen, they immediately circled around his body. The first six bullets didn’t affect Zhou Wen at all. Instead, Zhou Wen absorbed their energies and they quickly fell to the ground.

The sure-kill seventh bullet similarly failed to penetrate the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. It kept spinning in the formation, its power absorbed by the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation that was transferred to Zhou Wen.

As its strength was rapidly drained, the seemingly perpetual seventh sure-kill bullet ultimately fell.

I’ve finally succeeded!?Zhou Wen quickly instant transmitted into the tunnel, hoping to find the Calamity-grade creature.

Now that the bullet could no longer injure him, as long as he could find the Calamity-grade creature, there was a high chance of killing him.

According to Zhou Wen’s guess, the Calamity-grade creature’s body definitely wasn’t strong. Perhaps he didn’t need a powerful weapon to kill him.

However, Zhou Wen failed to find the Calamity-grade creature despite constantly instant transmitting in the tunnel.

He found nothing every time he rushed in the direction of where the bullet came from.

Zhou Wen suffered countless Calamity-grade bullets, but he still failed to find the Calamity creature. He came up with all kinds of solutions. Zhou Wen pushed Truth Listener’s abilities to their limits, but he still couldn’t find his location.

This Calamity-grade’s body definitely isn’t strong. As long as I can find him, killing him shouldn’t be difficult.?Zhou Wen was increasingly certain that his previous guess was right.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t find him. It was useless even if he knew that he could kill him.

Although I can’t find him, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation should be enough to clear the dungeon. I wonder what rank I’ll get.?Zhou Wen wasn’t sure what rank he would receive.

From a practical point of view, his method of level clearing was actually in the same vein as using the Heavenly Robe to clear the level. Both prevented the bullets from hitting him.

Therefore, in theory, if he couldn’t kill the Calamity creature, it was very likely that he could only obtain a three-star grading like before.

No, I have to think of a way to kill him no matter what. If I don’t get first place, what’s the point of getting on the rankings??After some thought, Zhou Wen felt that getting a three-star was meaningless. He had to get first if he wanted to be on the rankings.

“Young Master, someone has offered a high price for the Heavenly Robe. Unfortunately, he’s not from the League of Guardians.” An Sheng called.

“Is the price very high?” Zhou Wen had previously told An Sheng that he wanted to sell the Heavenly Robe to the League of Guardians. Yet, An Sheng had even informed him under such circumstances, indicating that the price offered was probably extraordinary.

“Very high.” An Sheng enunciated each word clearly.

“Who’s buying? What’s the price?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“The Cape family. The starting price is enough for us to use the accelerator again. We can discuss the exact price later,” An Sheng said.

“Alright, let’s meet and talk.” Zhou Wen was originally determined to sell it to the League of Guardians, but he didn’t feel strongly about it anymore. It didn’t matter who he sold it to.

As for the Cape family, they had always been at odds with Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen didn’t mind letting them bleed.
