Chapter 1847: Ascending Destiny Platform

Translator: CKtalon

“Wait... Wait...” Ah Yong pulled Zhou Wen back as her face flushed red.

“What is it now?” Zhou Wen looked at Ah Yong. Ever since he had said that he wanted to take her to An Sheng, Ah Yong would suddenly raise many issues.

She would need to have some water one moment or relieve herself the next. Another moment, she would claim that her legs were numb and she needed some rest.

Zhou Wen thought to himself, You are an Apocalypse-grade creature. Your body is already so pure that it doesn’t contain any impurities. You are a pure energy body. Do you still need to use the toilet? Your legs are numb? Earth will probably go numb before you.

“I still want to drink some water...” Ah Yong’s eyes darted around as though she didn’t dare meet Zhou Wen’s eyes.

“There’s no need to be nervous. That person only looks like your father. He’s not really your father. What’s there to be nervous about? Let’s go. We’ll return and have some fun after taking a look.” Zhou Wen held Ah Yong’s hand and teleported to a pavilion on the outskirts of Luoyang.

An Sheng was already standing in the pavilion. When he saw Zhou Wen appear with Ah Yong, An Sheng’s gaze landed on her.

Ah Yong was a big shot at the Apocalypse grade. She was clearly many times stronger than the weak An Sheng, but when An Sheng’s gaze landed on her, it made her feel extremely uneasy.

Ah Yong subconsciously tugged at Zhou Wen’s clothes. Seeing Zhou Wen nod at her, she felt a little relieved and looked at An Sheng again.

An Sheng’s appearance was indeed very similar to Emperor of Shang’s painting. Ah Yong felt that if she really had such a father, she wouldn’t find him off-putting. Furthermore, she felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Ah Sheng, say something. Don’t just stand there.” Zhou Wen felt like an inexperienced matchmaker. He didn’t know how to make the two introverted youths chat.

“Hello, Ah Yong. I’m your father.” An Sheng spoke, but his first sentence nearly made Zhou Wen choke.

“She... She... She’s really your daughter... Are you sure...” Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he sized up the two of them in disbelief.

Although he had one or two thoughts previously that An Sheng might be Ah Yong’s father, he never expected it to be true.

“I think she is.” An Sheng spouted nonsense with a serious expression.

Zhou Wen was already beginning to suspect that An Sheng found Ah Yong was gullible and wanted to trick an Apocalypse-grade big shot like Ah Yong to be his free goon.

Does saying that you are her father really make you her father? I can even say that I’m The Thearch’s father. Will she acknowledge me? Zhou Wen cursed inwardly.

“Daddy...”

Just as Zhou Wen was cursing An Sheng for being unreliable, he never expected Ah Yong to have tears well in her eyes. She pounced forward and hugged An Sheng, calling him daddy.

Holy sh*t, what kind of person are you? How can you recognize someone like this? Can you have some of the dignity as expected from an Apocalypse-grade big shot? Try to figure out the situation before recognizing him as your father. Are you really acknowledging him as your father just because he said so? If I had known, I would have said you were my daughter. I also lack an Apocalypse-grade big shot to hold the fort! Zhou Wen’s eyes nearly popped out.

Zhou Wen coughed lightly and wanted to say something, but the father and daughter continued chatting as though they hadn’t heard him.

One kept calling ‘Dear Ah Yong’ and the other kept calling ‘Daddy’ affectionately. It left Zhou Wen dumbfounded.

You can acknowledge a loved one just like that? Zhou Wen was beginning to doubt life.

“Young Master Wen, I’ll take Ah Yong out to have fun. I won’t keep you.” An Sheng got up and informed Zhou Wen before leaving with Ah Yong.

Hey, are you leaving just like that? I went through so much trouble to bring your daughter here from the dimension. You didn’t even thank me? Don’t you have any manners? Ah Sheng, you’ve changed... Zhou Wen was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.

However, the family of two ignored him and left.

Is Ah Yong really An Sheng’s daughter? Zhou Wen watched the two of them leave in deep thought.

An Sheng wasn’t an honest person. He was good at lying—particularly good—but he wasn’t a person without principles. Zhou Wen believed that An Sheng wouldn’t spout nonsense.

Although Ah Yong was childish, she wasn’t stupid. With the power of the Apocalypse grade, it was impossible for her to casually acknowledge a father.

If An Sheng was really Ah Yong’s father, Zhou Wen felt that his previous guess might really be true.

Unfortunately, Ah Lai doesn’t know anything. Otherwise, I could ask him again, Zhou Wen thought regretfully.

Ah Lai’s situation was somewhat different from An Sheng’s. An Sheng had truly lost his memory. A portion of his memories might be hidden somewhere in his brain and he might remember it in the future.

Strictly speaking, Ah Lai might not have lost his memory. He might have really been unconscious for a period of time. In other words, the memory in between was very likely non-existent, so it was naturally impossible for him to recall anything.

What a mess! Zhou Wen felt a headache. He felt that the most complicated thing in the world was humans. It was even more complicated than the Lost Immortal Sutra.

The phone vibrated. It was a notification that the dungeon had been downloaded.

Zhou Wen hurriedly took out his phone and indeed, he saw a game icon of Destiny Platform on the home screen.

Whatever. I don’t care. Gaming suits me better. Zhou Wen turned around and vanished.

Lying on his bed, he opened the Destiny Platform dungeon.

The blood-colored avatar appeared on the staircase, but Zhou Wen didn’t feel any discomfort. He walked to the second stone step without feeling anything.

From the looks of it, the power of the Destiny Platform is useless against me. Zhou Wen walked up to the Destiny Platform in one breath and realized that it was completely motionless. It didn’t show any signs of a vital baptism like Jing Daoxian and company.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and understood what was going on.

He walked back and arrived at the first stone step of the staircase again. Then, he forcefully sealed all his abilities.

He had too many rule-breaking and taboo-breaking abilities. The Destiny Platform directly excluded him and didn’t treat him as a human at all. Since he wasn’t confined by the rules, he naturally couldn’t enjoy the benefits provided by the rules’ framework.

After forcefully blocking his abilities, Zhou Wen immediately felt his body being sucked onto the stone steps.

Zhou Wen only used his physical strength to stride forward to resist the suction force as he walked towards the Destiny Platform.

As he walked up, the suction force became stronger. Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s physique was excellent. He endured the suction force and arrived in front of the Destiny Platform again.

His body seemed to be pulled by countless hands from hell, preventing him from taking the final step.

Zhou Wen’s muscles, bones, and even veins were exerting their full strength. With a roar, he finally broke through the layers of resistance and stepped onto the Destiny Platform.

After he stepped onto the Destiny Platform, the force that pulled at his body immediately vanished. A strange force enveloped the entire Destiny Platform from every direction.
