Chapter 786: Ancient Tadpole

Translator: CKtalon

Large swaths of Green-Haired Gu were killed, dropping more than ten Green-Haired Gu Companion Eggs and quite a number of dimensional crystals. The valley became narrow again as he walked further in.

Further in, there was another small valley that was shaped like a horse’s hoof. It was even smaller than the valley ahead.

The valley’s terrain was much lower and the ground was covered in clear water. The water level was very shallow, reaching only Zhou Wen’s calf. He could see the bottom at a glance.

There were many water plants growing, making it look very beautiful. It was like a clean paradise.

However, in Zhou Wen’s eyes, such a beautiful and clean place wasn’t that great. There were many leech-like Gu on the rocks and water plants at the bottom. If he rashly entered, he would probably have his blood drained.

Zhou Wen summoned a Water Snake Companion Beast he had obtained in the past. It was a water-elemental snake he had obtained from the island where Six-Winged Guardian Dragon resided. Its body was condensed from water, so it naturally wasn’t afraid of poison or blood-sucking abilities.

After it entered the water, it directly devoured the leeches. When the leeches entered its body, they were immediately sucked dry, turning into small blobs of dried meat.

‘Killed Legendary Leech Gu...’

Notifications kept popping up on-screen. The water snake swam quickly in the water. Wherever it passed, Leech Gu would be sucked dry.

It’s no wonder so few people can come out alive despite so many people entering the Valley of No Return. Not only are there many dimensional creatures here, but their abilities are also extremely sinister. If one isn’t careful, they will succumb to it. It’s not easy to leave alive. Zhou Wen wasn’t excited about the Leech Gu. He didn’t let the water snake continue killing as he flew through the air and headed for the next valley.

The valley ahead had split roads. One path led to the left, while the other led to the right. Zhou Wen chose the left path and entered the next valley.

This valley was clearly much bigger than the previous valley. The water in the valley from before flowed in from here. He could see a waterfall cascading.

There were still many Leech Gu in the water, but he also saw a type of black tadpole swimming around. Groups of tadpoles could be seen everywhere in the water.

However, these tadpoles were extremely large, so large that one likely needed both hands to lift up a tadpole.

Zhou Wen was somewhat curious about the kind of Gu the tadpoles were, so he got the water snake to charge at them.

Just like before, the water snake went forward to devour the tadpoles in a bid to suck dry the water in their bodies. However, after the tadpoles were devoured, their bodies immediately exploded, blasting the water snake apart.

The tadpoles didn’t die after the explosion. Instead, they turned into a group of tadpoles that continued swimming in the water.

The water snake’s body was originally condensed from water. After being blasted apart, it quickly condensed again and devoured a large number of tadpoles once more.

The tadpoles exploded again, exploding the water snake’s body once again. At the same time, their numbers increased as their sizes shrank. Yet, there was no sign of death.

After a few repeated attempts, the tadpoles had already become the size of sesame seeds. It looked like they could continue exploding and splitting.

This dimensional creature is rather interesting. It can actually explode and split infinitely. I wonder how small it can go? Zhou Wen got the water snake to continue devouring the tadpoles to see what their limits were.

Finally, he realized that when the tadpoles became the size of a needle hole, their bodies wouldn’t continue splitting apart after the explosion.

They split and self-destruct five times in total. Unfortunately, the power of self-destruction is a little weak. Zhou Wen silently calculated.

‘Killed Legendary creature, Ancient Tadpole.’ A notification appeared in the game.

Although the skill was pretty good, Zhou Wen wasn’t interested because its level was a little low and its self-destruction wasn’t powerful enough.

However, soon, a rather special Ancient Tadpole attracted Zhou Wen’s attention. Among the group of Ancient Tadpoles was a dark-gold tadpole that was clearly different from the others.

Zhou Wen got the water snake to rush over and devour the Ancient Tadpole, but with a boom, a huge wave rose from the water. The water snake’s body was blasted apart, along with the water-elemental core in its body. It died just like that.

This self-destruction is quite powerful! Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he looked at the dark-gold tadpole that had split apart in the water. He summoned another Companion Beast.

This was the Epic Electric Eel that Zhou Wen had obtained in the underground Pool City. After the Electric Eel charged over, it spewed out an electric current. The dark-gold tadpole immediately split apart and exploded once again.

The Electric Eel was very fast. It escaped quickly in the water and dodged the explosive force of the dark-gold tadpole. It spat out another electric current at the even smaller dark-gold tadpoles.

Clearly, the dark-gold tadpole was at the Epic stage. Its explosive power was extremely powerful, enough to kill most Epic creatures of the same level.

Furthermore, after Zhou Wen’s experiments, he realized that these dark-gold tadpoles had exploded more times than the Ancient Tadpoles. They could explode a total of seven times.

‘Ding... Killed Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole. Discovered Companion Egg.’

Zhou Wen realized that there was a dark-gold Companion Egg in the water. He was delighted as he picked it up and hatched it.

Soon, there was an Ancient Dark Gold tadpole in the Companion Beast column.

Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole: Epic

Life Providence: Split

Life Soul: Combine

Strength: 34

Speed: 31

Constitution: 31

Essence Energy: 36

Talent Skill: Self-detonation

Companion Form: Grenade

This thing is really special! Zhou Wen summoned the Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole in-game and a dark-gold grenade appeared in his hand.

Zhou Wen threw it out. When the Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole landed in the water, it immediately exploded, splitting into a group of Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole grenades.

As for the tiny dark-gold tadpoles, they continued exploding upon undertaking the pressure.

However, the difference from the Legendary Ancient Tadpoles was that after the Dark Gold Ancient Tadpoles self-destructed, they would automatically gather together as long as they were not suppressed by external forces for a period of time. They would become the big Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole again, and the number of possible splits would return to normal.

Unless it self-destructed seven times, the Ancient Dark Gold Tadpole would slowly recover and not die.

This is good stuff. If many Dark Gold Ancient Tadpoles self-destruct at the same time, the might will be quite impressive. Zhou Wen searched the valley again and realized that there was a Dark Gold Ancient Tadpole in every group of Ancient Tadpoles.

Zhou Wen specifically targeted the Dark Gold Ancient Tadpoles in a bid to have more Companion Eggs drop, but after killing more than ten of them, no Companion Egg dropped. Zhou Wen had already arrived near the waterfall and was about to continue searching when he realized that there was an especially huge Ancient Tadpole in the pool beneath the waterfall.
