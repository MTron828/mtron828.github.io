Chapter 639 Fire Burning

“This is a combination of contortion, movement technique, and bone-contraction. It’s not a simple Essence Energy Skill. If you want to learn it, I’ll teach you slowly later,” said Liu Yun anxiously. “Give me the blade quickly.”

“Take it.” Zhou Wen took out his Orchid Blade and threw it at Liu Yun.

Liu Yun caught the Orchid Blade. As he waited for the dagger to appear again with full concentration, he said, “What kind of blade is this? Can it be used?”

“Don’t worry. It’s very sharp. It’s not inferior to the one in my hand.” Zhou Wen didn’t tell him that it was the Four Gentlemen Blade’s Orchid Blade, lest he scare him.

He didn’t dare to lend him the Bamboo Blade either. He was afraid that he would end up with even more bad luck and attract more trouble.

Clang!

The dagger appeared behind Liu Yun. He leaned forward and twisted his body at the same time. With a back swing of his hand, he slashed at the dagger.

The dagger was sliced open by the Orchid Blade and disappeared as it flew out.

The dagger clearly didn’t give up on killing Liu Yun. It continued to appear, but it was struck by the Orchid Blade in Liu Yun’s hand.

After slashing more than ten times in a row, he forcefully snapped the dagger. Zhou Wen saw that he had managed to slash at the same spot every time. His technique was excellent and he wasn’t someone to be underestimated.

The dagger landed on the ground and quickly disintegrated, leaving behind a dimensional crystal. It looked like it had added stats. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“This blade isn’t bad. In any case, you still have a big one. Let me borrow the small one for a while. I’ll return it to you when we get out. You can name any conditions you want.” Liu Yun didn’t have any weapons on hand which made him uneasy. He wanted to use Zhou Wen’s Orchid Blade for the time being.

“Take it if you want to use it. Just follow the conditions we agreed on. There’s no need for any additional conditions,” Zhou Wen said.

Seeing how straightforward Zhou Wen was, Liu Yun suddenly felt that something was amiss. From the way he knew Zhou Wen, he definitely wasn’t someone who was easy to negotiate with.

There must be a problem. Liu Yun carefully sized up the Orchid Blade in his hand. After looking at it for a while, his expression suddenly changed. “This... This can’t be the Orchid Blade of the Four Baneful Blades, right?”

“As expected of my senior brother. You are knowledgeable,” Zhou Wen said with a thumbs up.

“It’s no wonder we are so unlucky when you’re carrying such a thing on you. I was fine coming to the desert so many times in the past, but something happened the moment you came. So it’s because of this evil thing. You really aren’t afraid of death... Wait...” Liu Yun said in an extremely foul manner as though he had suddenly thought of something. He looked at the Bamboo Blade at Zhou Wen’s waist and said with widened eyes, “That’s not the Bamboo Blade of the Four Baneful Blades, right? Are the things you have genuine?”

“What do you think?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.

Liu Yun nearly jumped up, but when he thought about how he would die if his feet left the ground, he stopped himself. He pointed at Zhou Wen and said with a trembling voice, “You really have no concept of death. Just having any one of the Plum, Orchid, Bamboo, and Chrysanthemum Blades will lead to a terrible death. F*ck you. To think you have two. Do you really have a death wish!? It’s fine if you’re tired of living, but don’t drag me with you.”

With that said, Liu Yun was about to throw the Orchid Blade at Zhou Wen. He didn’t want to hold such an item for even a minute. He had already deeply experienced how terrifying it was to be unlucky.

“Senior Brother, you have to consider carefully. Without this Orchid Blade, you would be dead right now,” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun was taken aback as his expression turned complicated. Although Orchid Blade was infamous, if he didn’t have any weapons now, the chances of survival were too low.

“Junior Brother, I really have to take my hat off to you. Couldn’t you have brought some normal weapons? Why have you brought such deadly things? Do you really have a death wish?” Liu Yun said gloomily, but he still held the Orchid Blade and didn’t throw it at Zhou Wen.

“Cut the crap. Tell me how you mastered that movement technique,” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun told Zhou Wen the various Essence Energy Skills he needed for his movement technique before saying, “This thing of mine is mainly used when stealing. In terms of speed and exquisiteness, it’s inferior to your movement technique. Why are you learning it? Do you want to be a thief?”

“I’m just interested.” Zhou Wen didn’t believe that Liu Yun’s movement technique was as useless as he had said. His strange movement technique allowed him to adapt to various environments.

In the future, when Zhou Wen entered dimensional zones to fight, it would be impossible for every dimensional zone to have enough space for him to use his full range of movement techniques. If he were in some narrow and rugged area, Liu Yun’s movement techniques would be especially useful.

After silently memorizing Liu Yun’s movement technique methodology, Liu Yun said from behind, “What do we do now? Do we still need to continue moving forward?”

“There’s no way out. All we can do is walk forward,” Zhou Wen said as he continued.

Liu Yun knew that scouting was useless, so he didn’t plan on waiting for Zhou Wen to scout ahead. He walked over and levelled up with him.

When Liu Yun passed the stone slab that the black-armored warrior had appeared in, he didn’t activate it. It looked like the problematic stone slabs were purely random.

After taking a few steps, a stone slab lit up again and new words appeared.

Cause of death: Fire Burning

“How many ways of death are there in Netherworld City?” Zhou Wen focused his attention on his surroundings as he pushed Truth Listener’s ability to its limit.

However, the range Truth Listener could hear only had a radius of ten stone slabs. Everything beyond was silent as though it was muted.

Zhou Wen could roughly tell that this was the maximum area they could hear sounds.

Boom!

With a loud thunderclap, a strange dimensional creature appeared by Zhou Wen’s side. It looked like a crocodile, but it stood there with its hind legs on the ground. It raised its front claws and its tail played a supporting role.

However, due to its short limbs, its body was fat and short. It looked a little adorable and wasn’t very tall. It only reached Zhou Wen’s waist.

Just as Zhou Wen was sizing it up, it opened its mouth and spat out a flame that surged at him.

The flames weren’t ordinary red-yellow in color, nor were they blue in color. Instead, they were white flames that looked like burning ice mist.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless. He drew his saber and slashed out a Demonic Astral Wheel. The blood-red wheel of light tore out like a saw as it slashed at the strange flames.

The Demonic Astral Wheel’s destructive power was indeed very strong. It spun and sliced through the white flames, but the deeper it went, the slower the Demonic Astral Wheel spun. It only managed to slice through less than a meter before completely stopping, as though it had been frozen.

In the next second, the Demonic Astral Wheel shattered amid the white flames, turning into countless fragments. The fragments rapidly burned, causing the white flames to become even more ferocious as they enveloped Zhou Wen.
