Chapter 1409: I’m Not Your Tool

Translator: CKtalon

“Dream… On…” Wang Lu said through gritted teeth.

“Just pretend I didn’t say anything. Hurry up and eat.” Zhou Wen had no choice but to give up.

Over the past two days, Zhou Wen had finally obtained a Mutated Overlord Snake Companion Egg. An Sheng had also helped him collect some relatively suitable Companion Eggs.

However, considering the low success rate from before, it was very difficult to fuse Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable with just one Mutated Overlord Snake.

If he had Wang Lu’s luck, the success rate would be much higher.

However, if Wang Lu wasn’t willing, Zhou Wen wouldn’t force her. He would try fusing again when he returned.

“How’s the Wang family’s situation now? If you need help, just inform me.” Zhou Wen sat down opposite Wang Lu and uncapped the wine. He poured a glass for Wang Lu and one for himself.

“It’s not a problem to survive, but the Wang family hasn’t found a path that we can call our own. Standing at a fork in the road, we don’t know how to proceed.” Wang Lu smiled and raised her wine glass, clinking it gently with Zhou Wen’s. “Cut the crap. How did you get on the rankings? Don’t tell me you relied on Heavenly Robe.”

“I’ve mastered a spatial circulation skill. The effects are similar to Heavenly Robe. It can prevent the Calamity-grade bullets from injuring me,” Zhou Wen answered truthfully.

“It’s no wonder you don’t need my Invincible Lucky Star,” said Wang Lu.

“It’s not that I don’t need it. After all, it’s yours. How can I keep hoarding it? Besides, you have to keep safe. With the Invincible Lucky Star and Heavenly Robe, at least you won’t be injured so easily in the future,” Zhou Wen said.

“Has the sun risen in the west? You are actually worried about me?” Wang Lu looked at Zhou Wen with a faint smile.

“Of course. If anything happens to you, who can lend me their luck?” Zhou Wen said.

If looks could kill, Zhou Wen would probably have been diced by Wang Lu’s gaze.

“Go to hell. Don’t come looking for me again. I’m not your tool,” Wang Lu said through gritted teeth as she stood up angrily.

Zhou Wen hurriedly went over to press down on her shoulders and made her sit down again.

“Don’t be angry. I didn’t mean that. Even if you don’t have luck, I don’t wish for you to be injured. Luck and whatnot are just a bonus. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to lend it to me,” Zhou Wen hurriedly explained.

“Humph, that’s more like it.” Only then did Wang Lu sit down and continue eating.

The two of them chatted about what had happened during their school days and recalled their beautiful youth.

Zhou Wen didn’t mention using Wang Lu’s luck again. He wasn’t someone who liked to force things.

“Do you still have records of the debt?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu after the meal.

“It’s all in my notebook. Don’t even think about reneging on it.” Wang Lu took out a small notebook from her pocket and patted it smugly.

“Alright, let’s strike off one using today’s meal and I’ll slowly repay the rest in the future. I have to return now.” Zhou Wen packed his things and prepared to return to Luoyang.

He couldn’t leave Luoyang for too long during An Tianzuo’s absence.

“Hey.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to leave, Wang Lu stopped him.

“What?” Zhou Wen turned to look at Wang Lu.

“Don’t you find it cloying to eat so much meat? Eat an apple to detox your stomach.” Wang Lu threw a clean apple at Zhou Wen.

“I don’t like apples.” Zhou Wen really didn’t like apples.

“Eat it.” Wang Lu glared.

“Why are you glaring at me? I’ll eat it, alright?” Zhou Wen took a bite. It was rather sweet. Zhou Wen waved his hand as he ate the apple. “I’m returning. I’ll pay you back your meals another time.”

“I’ll be waiting.” Wang Lu smiled.

Zhou Wen teleported back to Luoyang, but his luck wasn’t good. He landed more than fifteen kilometers away. Thankfully, this distance was nothing to Zhou Wen. He quickly returned to Luoyang.

Since I can’t borrow Wang Lu’s luck, I can only fuse them myself. However, I can’t have too much hope. I just need to fuse Ever-Victorious or Unstoppable. I don’t have any extravagant hopes of having both skills.?

Zhou Wen returned to his room and took out his phone before putting Tyrant Behemoth into the fusion column.

Now, Tyrant Behemoth had four skills—Penetration, Tearing, Armor Breaker, and Poison Fang. Apart from Poison Fang, the other three skills were good skills that could increase its destructive power.

Let’s see if I can fuse Unstoppable.?Zhou Wen placed the Companion Egg on it.

As he had two Unstoppable Companion Eggs thanks to An Sheng, he could try twice. If he failed to fuse Unstoppable, he could try Ever-Victorious next. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Although he knew that the chances of both skills succeeding were very low, Zhou Wen still wanted to give it a try. He couldn’t bring himself to give up.

However, even if he failed this time, it would likely leave behind one of the skills. If he didn’t fuse it with other Companion Eggs, he wouldn’t have both skills wiped out.

As the Unstoppable Companion Egg had three skills, Zhou Wen didn’t dare guarantee that he could fuse Unstoppable on the first try. All he could do was try his luck.

After tapping on fusion, Tyrant Behemoth and the Companion Egg lit up and fused together, leaving only Tyrant Behemoth.

Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at Tyrant Behemoth’s skills and was immediately delighted. Tyrant Behemoth’s skill had an additional Unstoppable. The other skills didn’t change. The Armor Breaker, Penetration, and Ripping that Zhou Wen needed hadn’t been wiped out.

I succeeded in one try. From the looks of it, my luck isn’t bad. I have to strike while the iron is hot.?Zhou Wen placed the Mutated Overlord Snake on it and clicked on the fusion.

Zhou Wen felt a little uneasy. It probably wasn’t easy to retain both skills. Furthermore, this Mutated Overlord Snake had two skills. Apart from Ever-Victorious, it also had a Bite skill.

It felt like a useless skill. In theory, Bite might replace other skills, so there was still quite a risk.

However, since he had the goods, Zhou Wen couldn’t feel at ease if he didn’t give it a try.

As the light lit up, Zhou Wen’s heart hung higher and higher, almost jumping out of his throat.

When the light dissipated, Tyrant Behemoth appeared again. From its appearance, it was no different from before.

Zhou Wen hurriedly looked at its information and his mouth gaped open.

Armor Breaker, Penetration, Ripping, Poison Tooth, Biting, Ever-Victorious, Unstoppable. Zhou Wen counted several times. There was no mistake about it. There were a total of seven skills. Both Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable were present.

It actually succeeded. There are even seven skills. Great!?Zhou Wen nearly jumped up in joy as though he had eaten a ginseng fruit. He felt refreshed and indescribably comfortable.

He hadn’t succeeded despite all the fusions in the past. Now, not only had he succeeded, but he had also ended up with seven skills. Although Poison Fang and Bite didn’t seem to be of much use, they were better than nothing.

Should I try fusing a bloodline again??With everything going so smoothly today, Zhou Wen was eyeing the bloodline function again.. If he succeeded, he could allow Tyrant Behemoth to have two Life Providences.
