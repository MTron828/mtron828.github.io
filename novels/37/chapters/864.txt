Chapter 865: Xie Yukun

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that this had nothing to do with him. He didn’t plan on entering the Founding Emperor Tomb, so he stopped making wild guesses.

After circling around, he returned to the periphery of the Founding Emperor Tomb. He searched for the tiny palm symbol at the edge of the tomb, hoping to gain something.

Zhou Wen had no intention of entering the Founding Emperor Tomb to begin with. Now that he knew that Liu Yun and Jing Daoxian were entering, he was even less likely to enter. All he did was walk around the periphery.

There were terracotta soldiers on the periphery. They were basically at the Legendary stage, and further in were Epic Bronze Men. It was said that there were also Mythical Gold Men, but they were extremely rare. Zhou Wen didn’t see them.

When he was about to reach the Founding Emperor Tomb, Zhou Wen slowed down. He definitely wouldn’t enter the imperial mausoleum. All he needed to do was look for the tiny palm symbol.

In the dungeon that Zhou Wen had downloaded, there was already a Thirteen Mausoleum. It was the only game dungeon that Zhou Wen had yet to enter.

The main reason was that there were some mysterious things in that dungeon. If one didn’t handle it well, problems would arise. More importantly, he couldn’t find the entrance and could only circle around the periphery.

A place like a mausoleum was not meant for entry to begin with, so it was naturally impossible for there to be an entrance. If one wanted to enter, they could only dig their way in.

It was the same for the Founding Emperor Tomb. There were no doors, but there were numerous holes dug nearby. It was said that many people wanted to enter, but things would happen midway. Up to now, only the six heroes had successfully entered.

Using Truth Listener’s ability, Zhou Wen carefully searched the area. His luck wasn’t bad. He found the tiny palm symbol on a stone beast that was half buried in the ground.

Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol. The game entered the download screen.

After waiting for a while, it still hadn’t downloaded successfully. This dungeon was probably a more important one. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Having had the phone for so long, Zhou Wen realized that the speed at which he downloaded the game had nothing to do with the size of the map. Typically, when the download took longer, there would be something especially powerful or mysterious inside.

It was getting late and he had already obtained the instance dungeon. In order not to bump into Liu Yun and Jing Daoxian, Zhou Wen planned on leaving and continuing his travels.

To his surprise, when he reached the main road, he saw Liu Yun leaning against a tree by the side of the road and looking at him with a faint smile.

“Junior Brother, I never expected us to meet again so soon,” Liu Yun said with a smile.

This fellow must have spotted me long ago. Zhou Wen knew very well. He looked at Liu Yun and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, have you thought it through and want to help me take care of Ya’er?”

When Liu Yun heard Ya’er’s name, his heart couldn’t help but tremble. He looked at Ya’er, who was in Zhou Wen’s arms, and hurriedly shook his head. “I came to discuss something with you. You should have heard my conversation with that old man. Are you interested in entering the Founding Emperor Tomb together? This sword is the key to entering the Founding Emperor Tomb. With it and your Earth Elemental Beast, we can safely enter and take whatever we want.”

“No,” Zhou Wen said bluntly.

“Don’t you want to know what’s inside the Founding Emperor Tomb? It’s...” Liu Yun was slightly taken aback. He was about to say something when Zhou Wen interrupted him again.

“I don’t want to know or go,” Zhou Wen said as he circled around Liu Yun and continued walking forward.

Ignoring the fact that there might be danger in the Founding Emperor Tomb, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t go with the suspected Jing Daoxian around.

Even Liu Yun had discovered him, so Zhou Wen didn’t believe that Jing Daoxian hadn’t discovered him. It was best not to get involved.

“I heard that there’s an Elixir of Immortality in the Founding Emperor Tomb. One can become immortal after eating it.” Liu Yun refused to give up as he followed Zhou Wen, hoping to persuade him.

“Not going.” Zhou Wen’s attitude was firm. Even if Liu Yun gave the best pitch, he wouldn’t enter the Founding Emperor Tomb.

“There’s still a Guardian cocoon in the Founding Emperor Tomb. If you enter, you might have a chance of contracting a Guardian,” Liu Yun continued.

“Not going.” He never expected such good news. However, even if there were Guardians inside, Zhou Wen wouldn’t go.

Since his phone was already downloading the game dungeon, he could still fight the Guardian in-game. There was no need for him to take the risk.

“Do you know who that old man is?” Liu Yun suddenly asked when he saw that Zhou Wen was determined not to go to the Founding Emperor Tomb.

“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered.

He never expected Zhou Wen to answer in such a manner. Liu Yun was taken aback before he asked in disbelief, “You know who that old man is? That’s impossible, right? You shouldn’t have seen him. He’s a dead person.”

“Who do you think he is?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss when he heard Liu Yun’s words. He stopped and asked him.

Everyone knew that Jing Daoxian wasn’t dead. Even when he was injured the last time and had nearly lost his ability to fight, the bureau’s setting up of a virtually inescapable net had failed to capture him.

“You shouldn’t be unfamiliar with the Zhuolu expedition team, right? That old man is one of the members of the expedition team,” Liu Yun said mysteriously.

“Impossible. I’ve seen all the members of the expedition team. There’s no such person,” Zhou Wen said.

Seeing Zhou Wen’s reaction, Liu Yun knew that there was a chance. He chuckled and said, “As long as you have read the information on the experts and staff members of the expedition team, it’s not surprising that you know them. But have you ever thought that there might be some people who aren’t in the records?”

“I don’t have time to listen to your nonsense. It’s impossible to let an outsider stay in the team for such a large-scale inspection,” Zhou Wen said.

“He’s not an outsider. After reading so much information, don’t you think that there’s something missing?” Liu Yun said solemnly.

Zhou Wen frowned in thought. He didn’t feel that there was anything missing from the information. All the information on the staff and experts had been available.

Seeing that Zhou Wen didn’t understand him, Liu Yun said, “Don’t you think it’s missing the information of the people who organized the expedition team?”

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he thought about the information he had read before saying, “Why? Isn’t there information on those officers and soldiers?”

“Are those officers and soldiers qualified to organize such an expedition team? They are only responsible for security,” Liu Yun asked.

“Think about it. For such an important expedition, they invited so many top experts, but they only used the power of some low-ranking officers to protect them. Don’t you think that there’s something wrong if there’s no one monitoring the progress of the work?” Liu Yun continued.

“Are you saying that the Federation deliberately concealed some information? That elder is one of them?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.

“Actually, I’ve investigated this matter before. I even entered the department that initiated the expedition and read through their information. However, the information was done perfectly. I couldn’t see any problems at all. However, I looked at some other information and realized that a few people in that department had mysteriously vanished when the expedition team was established. They never appeared again. Later, I did a lot of investigations, so I’m certain that those people must have gone to Zhuolu.” Liu Yun paused and said, “That old man’s name is Xie Yukun. He’s one of them.”
