Chapter 1532: Big Dipper Dungeon

Translator: CKtalon

“Don’t you find it a little strange?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the two tombstones.

“What’s so strange about it? Why can’t I tell?” Grim Demon looked around but didn’t see any problems.

“I don’t know the words on the tombstones. As you said, one tombstone belongs to Adam, while the other belongs to Eve. There’s nothing wrong with that, right?” Zhou Wen pointed at the tombstone.

“That’s right.” Grim Demon nodded.

“That’s strange. They are husband and wife, right? Shouldn’t husband and wife be buried together? Why are they buried in two graves with two tombstones erected?” Zhou Wen asked.

Grim Demon wasn’t human, so he wasn’t very sensitive to this matter. However, he had seen humans being buried together in the past. It was as Zhou Wen had said, so he found it odd.

“Why don’t we dig up this grave and see if it’s Adam and Eve inside?” Grim Demon said as he stared at the tombstone.

“I’m not interested in knowing if it’s Adam and Eve inside. I just want to know how we can return to Earth.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to verify the existence of Adam and Eve.

The spatial teleportation ability of Singularity Universe couldn’t be used between the dimension and Earth.

If he wanted to return, other than going through the Cube, he could only return to the buffer zone between Earth’s universe and the dimension like Zhou Wen had previously done.

However, without Ice Maiden leading the way, Zhou Wen didn’t know how he could reach there. Even if she was there and was willing to lead the way, this wasn’t where Ice Maiden had been. It was difficult to say if he could return.

Zhou Wen could sense that the further away he was from the sea of flowers, the greater the influence of the dimensional laws. The dimensional forces became stronger in the mountain range behind the city.

“Don’t ask me. It’s useless. I’ve only been to the dimension before I was born,” Grim Demon said as he spread out his hands.

Zhou Wen thought to himself,?Then aren’t you spouting nonsense? Guardians are created by the dimension. When all Guardians are in their cocoon form, they come from the dimension.

Just as Zhou Wen was thinking about it, he suddenly felt his phone vibrate. He took it out and realized that the dungeon he was downloading had finally finished.

This dungeon sure took a long time to download. Zhou Wen tapped into the home screen and searched for the newly generated dungeon.

After searching the home screen for a while, he was surprised to discover that there was no Alcor dungeon. The new dungeon was a symbol of the Big Dipper. The name below was “Big Dipper.”

No way. It took so long because it was downloading the entire Big Dipper??Zhou Wen was shocked as he hurriedly opened the dungeon and allowed the blood-colored avatar to enter. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After entering the dungeon, Zhou Wen immediately recognized that it was the Dubhe dungeon that the Tyrannosaurus had entered.

Could it be that the Dubhe dimensional zone that appeared this time isn’t a single celestial body’s dimensional zone? The entire Big Dipper is a large multi-celestial-body dimensional zone??The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right.

Having entered, Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Golden Sniper. He also got Tyrant Behemoth to rush over and slam open Dubhe Palace’s door.

Inside the palace, there was indeed a creature that looked identical to the one in reality. It wore amethyst armor and sat inside the palace. However, it looked cartoonish in-game. It looked rather cute and didn’t give off the same vibes as in real life.

Tyrant Behemoth rushed in, but Zhou Wen knew very well that Tyrant Behemoth’s present strength wasn’t enough to fight Dubhe’s creature.

Therefore, when Tyrant Behemoth rushed in front of the amethyst-armored creature, Zhou Wen secretly got the Golden Wyrm Scissors to fly over as well. From the palace’s entrance, he placed his finger on the sniper rifle’s trigger and shot at the amethyst-armored creature.

Tyrant Behemoth led the charge and arrived in front of the amethyst armor and opened its mouth to swallow it.

The amethyst armor finally moved. It raised its hand and pressed down. Immediately, a terrifying purple light shot out in all directions, instantly forming an omnipresent light blast.

The blood-colored avatar standing at the door was instantly killed as the game screen dimmed.

This attack is a little too powerful. It’s clearly an area-of-effect attack, but the Prisoned Dragon armor on me failed to defend against it at all. I was instantly killed,?Zhou Wen thought with a frown.

Although he had been instantly killed, Zhou Wen still obtained quite a bit of intelligence and information. This was thanks to The Disqualified.

From the information I obtained from dying, the power that killed the blood-colored avatar should be a high-temperature power. Furthermore, it’s accompanied by terrifying radiation. The lethality of this radiation power can’t be weaker than high-temperature heat. It might even be the main reason why the blood-colored avatar died instantly…?Zhou Wen guessed as he recalled the feeling of death.

After studying it for a while, Zhou Wen felt that the Chaos Egg would be able to withstand that attack for a short period of time. However, it was useless blocking the attack—he needed to kill the dimensional creature.

“Then I’ll give it another try.” Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive and entered the Dubhe instance dungeon again.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, he entered again. The Dubhe instance dungeon didn’t have a time limit. He could enter at any time.

That makes things easier. It shouldn’t be difficult to kill it after obtaining enough information from a few deaths. Zhou Wen had the Golden Wyrm Scissors in hand, so he still had a chance.

Zhou Wen only summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and made it rush into the palace this time.

Zhou Wen hid inside the Chaos Egg. His current mission wasn’t to help, but to ensure that he wasn’t killed. Otherwise, once he died, it was useless no matter how powerful the Golden Wyrm Scissors was. It would vanish with him.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors transformed into a golden beam of light that headed for the amethyst-armored creature. The creature raised its palm again as a purple blast of light instantly filled the entire dimensional zone.

The Chaos Egg immediately produced a large number of solid Essence Energy Crystals, nearly causing it to explode. Zhou Wen hurriedly transferred the solid Essence Energy Crystals to Tyrant Behemoth.

Zhou Wen constantly moved as solid Essence Energy Crystals were produced. Despite risking his life, the Chaos Egg remained just short of exploding.

After enduring for a second, the light blast weakened. Zhou Wen heaved a long sigh of relief. Just a second felt too long for him. If it continued for another second, he didn’t know if the Chaos Egg could withstand it.

Clang!

A terrifying collision sounded from the palace. At the same time, a light blast appeared again. Before Zhou Wen could figure out the situation inside, a large number of solid Essence Energy Crystals appeared in the Chaos Egg again. Zhou Wen could only crazily move them again and use Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping to feed the solid Essence Energy Crystals to Tyrant Behemoth.

Zhou Wen didn’t even have the chance to watch the battle between the two terrifying existences in the palace. All he could do was try his best to survive.. Only by surviving could the Golden Wyrm Scissors have a chance of killing the amethyst-armored creature.
