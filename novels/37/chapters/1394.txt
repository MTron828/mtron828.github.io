Chapter 1395: Unhappy About It? Put Up With It

“Definitely.” Buddha nodded slightly and looked at Wang Mingyuan.

The news of Perfect Sword Immortal’s downfall on Earth had spread to the higher-ups of the dimension. Although not many people knew the exact situation, most of the higher-ups knew that Perfect Sword Immortal had been tricked by Jiang Yan.

Buddha didn’t find it strange that someone from the Sword Immortal lineage came to settle scores with Wang Mingyuan. However, Wang Mingyuan was now considered the leader of the Octokind. It was still acceptable for him to self-reflect for three years. If he really killed Wang Mingyuan, not only would the reputation of the Octokind be ruined, but even the Exalted whom the Octokind relied on would have their reputation marred.

This matter was done by Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. It was the best outcome to have Wang Mingyuan answer to the Sword Immortal lineage.

Seeing Buddha look at him, Wang Mingyuan naturally knew what he meant.

“How may I address you?” Wang Mingyuan’s expression was as calm as ever. What the Immortal had said seemed to have nothing to do with him.

“Berserker,” the Immortal finally answered casually.

When he mentioned his name, the expressions of the Octokind changed drastically.

Few people in the dimension didn’t know the name of Berserker. He was just too infamous and was known as the number one Calamity under the Apocalypse grade.

Furthermore, this name wasn’t an empty one. Berserker had once killed an Apocalypse as a Calamity, shocking the entire dimension. Everyone knew about it.

Although Wang Mingyuan also had the strength of a Calamity-grade and had impressive combat strength, he was still much weaker than a powerful Calamity like Berserker.

Even most of the Octokind believed that the monarchs of the Octokind were on a completely different level from Berserker. No one treated Berserker as a Calamity-grade. Many people even treated him as an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse.

Previously, due to the Berserker’s insolence, the members of the Octokind were still very indignant. However, after hearing the name of Berserker, they seemed to be doused with a bucket of ice water. It chilled their hearts, and the indignation in their hearts vanished for some reason.

Wang Mingyuan didn’t show any surprise after learning Berserker’s name. He only nodded slightly before walking towards him.

“Did I give you permission to move?” Sword Intent surged around Berserker as it slashed at Wang Mingyuan.

As Wang Mingyuan walked, he said, “I believe your race is still determined to retrieve that immortal sword left behind on Earth during the Mythical era, right?”

“You know where that sword is?” The sword intent around Berserker paused as he stared at Wang Mingyuan and asked.

“No.” Wang Mingyuan shook his head frankly.

“If what you say next doesn’t satisfy me, the resolution won’t just involve three years of self-reflection,” said Berserker coldly.

However, Wang Mingyuan didn’t seem to hear him. As he walked towards Berserker, he said, “To retrieve that immortal sword, you need the help of humans on Earth. You don’t have any objections about that, right?”

“Continue,” said Berserker with a frown.

If they could directly descend to Earth to retrieve the immortal sword, the Immortals wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble. They wouldn’t have had to secretly nurture Jiang Yan and the League of Guardians; they could have gone to Earth to find it themselves.

Wang Mingyuan continued, “Then I’ll provide you with an analysis. Now, the factions on Earth are divided into five major factions. The first faction is the Holy Temple and the six human families. I don’t think this faction will be used by the Immortals. You know the reason better than me.”

Wang Mingyuan had already walked into the hall, but he had no intention of stopping. He continued walking towards Berserker who was sitting on the seat of honor. As he walked, he said, “The second faction is the League of Guardians. Currently, Jiang Yan is the leader. According to what I know, his Guardian has already advanced to the Calamity grade. Furthermore, he is no longer under the Immortals’ control.”

“Continue.” Berserker looked at Wang Mingyuan with killing intent brewing in his eyes.

“The third faction is the Holy Spirit Association. The president, Ya, is also my disciple,” Wang Mingyuan said.

Berserker was slightly taken aback. He was unaware that Ya was actually Wang Mingyuan’s disciple. He wasn’t responsible for the matters on Earth. If his disciple, Perfect Sword Immortal, hadn’t died, Berserker wouldn’t have been involved in this matter.

“The fourth faction is the federal government. Compared to the first three, the current federal government is a little weaker. However, due to the appearance of the Mythical Serum, this faction has the greatest potential. Given enough time, more and more powerhouses will definitely be born to this faction in the future. It will definitely become mainstream.” As Wang Mingyuan spoke, he arrived in front of the platform of honor. He still had no intention of stopping.

“Hui Haifeng is your disciple. This isn’t a secret. You don’t have to flaunt it,” said Berserker.

Wang Mingyuan smiled. “The fifth faction is made up of local elites. Among them, Luoyang’s An family is the strongest. Their strength can already match the six families.”

“It’s true that you came from Luoyang, but your Wang family is nothing in Luoyang. Don’t tell me you want to say that An Tianzuo is also your disciple?” Berserker said coldly.

“No, but the number three figure in Luoyang now is Zhou Wen, who has some ties with the An family. He’s also my disciple. You should know this very well, right?” Wang Mingyuan was already standing within reach of Berserker.

“So what?” Berserker said contemptuously.

Wang Mingyuan’s disciples might be powerful figures on Earth, but in the eyes of Berserker, they were nothing.

If it wasn’t for the fact that they were born on Earth and were protected by Earth, he wouldn’t even need to raise his hands to kill them.

“It’s not a big deal. It’s just that beyond the five factions, may I ask who else can the Immortals use to find the immortal sword?” Wang Mingyuan asked Berserker.

Berserker was slightly taken aback before his expression gradually changed.

These people were nothing in the dimension, so much so that Berserker couldn’t even be bothered to spare them a glance.

However, on Earth, the energy these people possessed was unimaginable.

Now, Earth’s situation was basically stable. There was no need to think about the Holy Temple. The Holy Temple was originally the enemy of the Immortals. If the Holy Temple hadn’t controlled Earth in the past, the Immortals wouldn’t have been in such a disadvantageous position.

However, that immortal sword had an extraordinary meaning to the entire Immortal race. They had to retrieve it no matter what. The Immortals had gathered resources for so long and paid a huge price to teleport so many Guardians into Earth—all done to retrieve that immortal sword.

In this era, Earth had undergone a large-scale aberration. The situation in which the six families ruled had been overthrown. Only then did the Immortals finally usher in an opportunity.

They originally imagined that they could control the League of Guardians for their own purposes, but to their surprise, they ended up being plotted against by Jiang Yan. One could only blame Perfect Sword Immortal for being stupid. He had managed to turn the fine situation into its present state.

Without the League of Guardians, the Immortals could only support another human faction. However, based on the distribution of the present factions, it was probably very difficult for new factions to emerge. Furthermore, the Skysplit Tower was still in the hands of the League of Guardians. Without the Skysplit Tower’s help, there weren’t many resources that the Immortals could send to Earth. It wasn’t that they lacked resources, but there was no stable channel.

Berserker thought carefully and realized that the Immortals had reached a point where no one could be used. The people who they could use were actually Wang Mingyuan’s disciples.

Even if the Immortals weren’t afraid of wasting time and effort to support a new faction, it was probably impossible for them to grow with Wang Mingyuan’s disciples and the Holy Temple around.

Wang Mingyuan had already made his hint clear—with his disciples around, it was impossible for the Immortals to retrieve the immortal sword from Earth.

Pa!?Wang Mingyuan slapped Berserker in the face, causing his face to jerk to the side.

Everyone was alarmed as their eyes widened. Berserker also widened his eyes as he turned his head back and stared at Wang Mingyuan. He was like a beast that was about to devour him. The sword intent over his body stirred crazily as though it wanted to tear the world apart, but he ultimately didn’t attack Wang Mingyuan.

“Unhappy about it?” As Wang Mingyuan spoke, he slapped Berserker in the face again. With a slap, his face jerked to the other side. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Put up with it,” Wang Mingyuan said casually as he looked at the enraged Berserker.
