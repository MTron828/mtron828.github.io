Chapter 1033: Osmanthus Tree

Translator: CKtalon

More and more black roots were dug out. They were already more than two meters long, but there was still no end to them.

This made Shen Yuchi excited and nervous. He originally thought that he had dug up a broken root, but now, it looked like they had really dug up the osmanthus tree.

However, there was something that caught Shen Yuchi’s attention. When the Mythical Companion Beast was digging, it would occasionally come into contact with the roots. However, the roots weren’t absorbed like the flower petals, nor did anything strange happen.

Could it be that only the flower petals have a magical effect? Shen Yuchi was somewhat worried. If only the flower petals had an effect, how many flower petals were on the buried osmanthus tree?

However, everything was still unknown. He had no way of confirming that the osmanthus tree was useless. He didn’t know how many petals there were, so he could only continue waiting for the outcome.

A professor wanted an astronaut to cut off a portion of the roots and conduct a simple test in the space station, but even the Mythical Companion Beast couldn’t damage the roots at all.

The result was the same when using high-tech cutting equipment. The hardness of the roots far exceeded any known matter.

This outcome alarmed everyone, including Shen Yuchi. After all, a Mythical Companion Beast couldn’t even damage it at all. What kind of existence was that tree? It was truly shocking.

Now that there was no other way; they could only continue digging. More and more roots were dug out, and the crisscrossing was very complicated. It looked like they had really dug up the osmanthus tree.

During the excavation, they dug up quite a number of petals. Apart from a small number used for experiments and research, most of them were stored away.

As he saw more and more petals gathered, Shen Yuchi hated the fact that he couldn’t be on the Moon himself. He wanted to be a miner and dig up all the petals.

Such petals could bring immeasurable wealth to the bureau. Even if they couldn’t be used to advance an Epic creature to the Mythical stage, the ability to advance a Legendary to the Epic stage was enough to create unimaginable wealth.

After some research, they realized that repeated usage of the petals on the same Companion Beast had reduced effects. Different Companion Beasts underwent different levels of evolution using the same petal.

Epic Companion Beasts would have their stats enhanced to a certain extent—something which could be seen from the experiments.

The Mythical Companion Beast kept digging. After a period of time, it finally dug to the trunk of the osmanthus tree. The trunk was also pitch-black like ink. Based on what had already been dug out, it was probably more than ten meters in diameter.

A giant tree with a diameter of more than ten meters. When it’s in full bloom, how many osmanthus flowers will it produce? Everyone was pleasantly surprised when they saw the tree’s size.

Even if only one-thousandth of the flowers produced by the osmanthus tree was preserved, it was still an unimaginable number.

They impatiently ordered the Mythical Companion Beast to continue digging, but not long after, they realized that the tree trunk had reached its end.

“That’s all... How can there be nothing...” Shen Yuchi’s expression was somewhat ugly.

From the communication video, one could see that the huge osmanthus tree was in fact only a stump. The parts above seemed to have vanished.

The Companion Beast continued digging in the vicinity, but it only discovered sporadic petals. It didn’t find the snapped trunk.

On the tree stump, there were also obvious signs of cleaving. It proved that this mysterious and huge osmanthus tree hadn’t been cut off by a natural disaster. Instead, some creature had chopped it down.

Even the strength of a Mythical Companion Beast can’t injure the tiny roots at all. What kind of creature can chop through such a thick tree trunk? Shen Yuchi was alarmed just thinking about it.

Thankfully, there were no traces of dimensional creatures nearby. Furthermore, even if the main trunk was gone, there were still some scattered petals nearby. To the bureau, being able to gather these scattered petals already meant a huge fortune.

Furthermore, the tree stump might be of great value. Otherwise, there was no need for the mysterious creature to have taken it away. All he needed to do was remove the petals. There was no need for him to have gone through the trouble of chopping the tree.

The excavation continued. Every day, they would dig out at least ten petals. Sometimes, they would dig out dozens.

This excited the bureau and the researchers. After all, these petals didn’t just represent Epic Companion Beasts.

Some Legendary Companion Beasts with very useful skills or Life Providences couldn’t be used due to their low levels and poor stats.

With these osmanthus flowers, they could raise these select Legendary Companion Beasts to the Epic stage and make up for their stats. They could even give birth to powerful Life Souls.

Having the osmanthus flowers was equivalent to having infinite possibilities.

Everyone felt that they would gain a huge harvest from this lunar expedition, but on this day, as the Mythical Companion Beast continued digging the tree stump in the bid to dig out all the parts of the tree stump and think of a way to transport it back to Earth—

The communications between Earth’s command center and the lunar space station came to an abrupt halt. No one knew what had happened. The researchers tried everything they could to contact the Moon, but there was no news from them. They had no way of knowing what had happened.

“Professor, can you think of a way to use the existing satellites to record the situation of the space station and the tree stump?” Shen Yuchi asked the old professor beside him.

The old professor said with a heavy expression, “It’s easy to use satellites to scan the space station, but the tree stump is in a position that can’t be captured.”

“Use the satellite to scan the space station first,” Shen Yuchi said.

“We’re already trying, but we need to wait for our satellites to reach a predetermined orbit. Otherwise, we can only rely on other satellites... I’m afraid it will leave traces...” the old professor said.

“How long will it take for our satellites to capture the space station?” Shen Yuchi asked with a frown. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It should be around three hours and forty minutes,” the old professor answered.

Shen Yuchi pondered for a moment before saying a word. He didn’t wish to attract anyone’s attention. “Wait.”

Time ticked by. Everyone waited nervously. When the satellite reached the required orbit, they immediately got busy.

Soon, the picture near the space station was sent back.

When they saw the picture, everyone was horrified. The entire space station base had sunk into a deep pit, and the deep pit looked like the footprint of some animal.

The space station seemed to have been flattened by a creature.

There’s a terrifying dimensional creature on the Moon... Everyone had ominous thoughts.
