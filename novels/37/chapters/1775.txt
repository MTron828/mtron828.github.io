“Xuan, take a closer look. Perhaps that path will help you,” Zhou Wen suddenly said to Li Xuan.

“Whose path? That female Immortal’s?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.

“No, Zhong Ziya’s,” Zhou Wen said with a shake of his head.

Li Xuan looked at the injured Zhong Ziya. Zhong Ziya clearly had a completely different style from him, but he didn’t doubt Zhou Wen’s words. Instead, he stared intently at Zhong Ziya.

More and more wounds appeared on Zhong Ziya’s body, but they didn’t heal quickly. This was completely different from Li Xuan’s abilities.

However, Li Xuan’s eyes gradually lit up.

Although the sword art used by the female Immortal was identical to Zhong Ziya’s sword art, the way she used it crushed him. Or rather, they were on completely different levels.

When solving the same question, although primary school students could do it correctly, another could do it in a relatively more complicated manner. This was the difference thanks to knowledge.

It was the same for Zhong Ziya’s situation now; as long as Zhong Ziya took a look, the same method couldn’t injure him again. Every injury on his body made him rapidly grow.

It sounded simple, but there weren’t many people in this world who could really do it. This was because what people saw was only a sword art, not something deeper behind it.

However, Zhong Ziya could deduce what was involved on the surface and immediately use it for his benefit. This ability was amazing.

The female Immortal’s sword art posed less and less threat to him.

Li Xuan couldn’t help but smile bitterly. “My brain isn’t as good as his. I can’t do it to such an extent.”

“That shouldn’t be your focus.” Zhou Wen shook his head but didn’t say anything else.

Just as people thought that Zhong Ziya’s most difficult period had passed, he began to be injured again. Furthermore, his injuries were worse than before. The sword marks nearly severed his arm.

The female Immortal’s sword art changed again, but it didn’t transcend Zhong Ziya’s sword art.

Different people had different ways of using the same item. This depended on the person, not the item itself.

In the eyes of a peasant, a tree was used to grow flowers and bear fruits. In the eyes of a carpenter, it was a wooden bed or a wooden table. In the eyes of a gardener, it was a part of a garden.

It was the same for sword arts. The same sword art could be given different meanings.

The female Immortal clearly didn’t want to kill Zhong Ziya directly. What she wanted to do was squash Zhong Ziya’s confidence, as well as humanity’s confidence.

A race could fail and decline, but they would ultimately hold out hope for an eventual rise, but once it lost its confidence, even if it could survive, it would only be an auxiliary item.

“You will pay the price for your arrogance.” Zhong Ziya, who was covered in blood, didn’t waver at all.

“I like that look in your eyes,” the female Immortal replied indifferently without stopping her sword.

The sword arts that seemed to contain all the profundity of the world exchanged blows. The same move was used, but they appeared worlds apart. It felt as though Zhong Ziya was completely inadequate.

Zhong Ziya was like a trapped beast. Although he was still extremely ferocious, he seemed pitiful.

Before Zhong Ziya could react, the female Immortal had already planted a seed of invincibility in the hearts of the spectating humans. As the battle continued, this seed constantly sprouted and grew stronger.

If Zhong Ziya were to be defeated today, this seed would probably become an eternal wall that made it difficult for humans to regain their confidence as a race.

“Do you know what the strongest talent in the world is?” Zhong Ziya suddenly retreated a distance and said to the female Immortal who wasn’t pursuing him.

“I don’t know.” The female Immortal wasn’t afraid that Zhong Ziya would escape. There was no teleportation nexus here, and the Cube couldn’t teleport any creature out. Even if Zhong Ziya wanted to escape, where could he run to in the dimension?

“The strongest talent in the world is evolution. Any creature can become stronger through their own evolution and adapt to different environments to do things that they originally couldn’t do.” Zhong Ziya stared at the female Immortal with a burning gaze as his body gradually underwent some magical changes.

“So?” the female Immortal asked with interest.

“And my talent is Super Evolution.” As Zhong Ziya spoke, the changes in his body suddenly intensified.

His wounds quickly healed and his skin instantly returned to its crystalline snow-white state. There seemed to be a glow flowing over his skin as every strand of hair flowed with a luster.

“Every setback I experience in life, every blow I suffer, and even if I’m covered in wounds, as long as the pain doesn’t kill me, they will ultimately become the cornerstone of my evolution, allowing me to forge the stairs to victory. Every wound you leave on me will bring you closer and closer to the grave…” Zhong Ziya’s eyes burned with zeal.

“It doesn’t look any different,” the female Immortal said indifferently.

Zhong Ziya’s body didn’t look any different from before. He wasn’t like Li Xuan. Every time Li Xuan was injured, his carapace would undergo a different change. It was a very obvious evolutionary sign.

Zhong Ziya wasn’t the same. His body was no different from before. He still had two hands, two legs, and a head. From Li Xuan’s point of view, Zhong Ziya hadn’t evolved enough.

“My evolution is here.” Zhong Ziya’s eyes seemed to be burning with flames as he pointed at his head.

Just as he said that, Zhong Ziya’s body went into motion again. He charged at the female Immortal and threw a punch at her exquisite face.

The female Immortal stared coldly at Zhong Ziya until his fist was about to reach her. Then, she brandished the sword in her hand again.

The sword was like a beam as it slashed at Zhong Ziya’s fist.

There was no sound of a fist colliding with the blade, nor did the blade slash at Zhong Ziya’s fist.

As though he had predicted the future, Zhong Ziya retracted his seemingly full-strength punch. His other fist suddenly exerted strength and struck the female Immortal’s cheek from an unbelievable angle.

A glint of surprise flashed in the female Immortal’s eyes. Before this, no matter what technique Zhong Ziya used, she could tell at a glance. However, this time, she failed to identify Zhong Ziya’s two fists.

This could only mean one thing—Zhong Ziya’s realm was already close to her level, preventing her from enjoying a higher vantage point.

For the first time, the female Immortal chose to dodge. She took a step to the side and dodged Zhong Ziya’s fist.

With the female Immortal retreating, Zhong Ziya’s attacks poured down like a torrent, preventing the female Immortal from counterattacking. All she could do was constantly retreat and dodge.

The humans watching immediately became pumped, their despairing hearts stirring again.
