Chapter 1408: It’s Really Nothing

After the Heavenly Robe was brought back to the Cape family by Woods, they quickly experimented. After using Luck Companion Beasts to augment it, its dodge chance increased, but it was still far from 100%.

However, they confirmed that the Luck stat had an augmentation effect on the Heavenly Robe’s dodge chance. An Sheng wasn’t lying.

However, as there were very few lucky Companion Beasts to begin with, the typical person would hatch them upon obtaining one. Therefore, the Cape family didn’t have any Luck Companion Eggs available. They could only buy them on the market.

However, when they wanted to buy Luck Companion Eggs, they realized that they couldn’t buy any on the market with Luck stat and skills. There were only a few Luck Companion Eggs on sale. Even those at the Legendary and Epic stage were sold at astronomical prices.

“Damn it. It must be those bastards from the An family,” Woods cursed hatefully.

“We should have known this long ago. Since the Heavenly Robe has such a requirement, Zhou Wen must have already plundered all the Luck Companion Eggs on the market. It’s normal for the price of Luck Companion Beasts to increase.” The Cape family head thought for a moment and said, “However, as long as we can gather enough Luck equipment and make the Heavenly Robe dodge chances 100%, everything will be worth it. Let’s talk to the An family and see if we can buy Luck Companion Beasts from them. We have to try our best to buy the Luck Companion Beasts from other places as well. I reckon the An family won’t sell all their Luck Companion Beasts to us.”

At this point, the Cape family head could only continue. Otherwise, the Heavenly Robe he had spent a large sum of money to buy would be useless. It could even be said to be trash.

The Heavenly Robe’s defense was much weaker than armor of the same level. Its dodge chance wasn’t 100%, so it was unknown when one would be hit if they wore it. Who dared to use their lives to test their luck? It was equivalent to being useless.

Now, they still believed that the Heavenly Robe could achieve a 100% dodge chance. After all, Zhou Wen had relied on the Heavenly Robe on clearing the dungeon. There was unlikely to be anything wrong with that assumption.

They were right, but unfortunately, they didn’t know that the augmentation of ordinary lucky equipment could only increase the dodge chance to a very high percentage, but it wouldn’t ever reach 100%. One needed Wang Lu’s Invincible Lucky Star to obtain a 100% dodge chance.

The Cape family contacted An Sheng again and proposed to buy some Luck Companion Beasts. However, the price An Sheng offered nearly made them curse.

“Adjutant An, the Heavenly Robe was bought from you. Luck Companion Beasts should be considered accessories. It’s not appropriate for you to demand such a high price, right? If this matter were to spread, would anyone dare to do business with the An family in the future?” Wood, who was in charge of this matter, said as he suppressed his anger.

As for Woods, he had been temporarily abandoned by the Cape family due to his previous mistake. Wood was fully in charge of buying Luck Companion Beasts.

“We strictly followed the contract and completed the transaction. We didn’t do anything against our conscience. There’s nothing we can’t let others know. Besides, there are countless people vying for a good item like the Heavenly Robe. You shouldn’t go against your conscience and smear it, right?” An Sheng said with a chuckle.

Wood was first taken aback before he understood what An Sheng meant. He immediately felt choked.

An Sheng’s meaning was very clear. Now that the Heavenly Robe was in the hands of the Cape family, if they revealed the problem with the Heavenly Robe, its value would crash. It would also let others know the weakness of the Heavenly Robe. The Cape family would end up being on the losing end.

If the Cape family didn’t tell others, others would still be afraid of the Heavenly Robe. Perhaps there would be a chance to sell it in the future.

Wood had no choice but to suppress his anger and negotiate with An Sheng. This was because there were too few Luck Companion Beasts that could be bought on the market. No matter how angry he was, he could only buy them from the An family. Otherwise, the Heavenly Robe would only be a piece of Terror-grade equipment with ordinary effects.

“Has the Heavenly Robe been sold to the Cape family?” As Zhou Wen was grinding dungeons, Wang Lu called.

“The Companion Eggs have been sold? How much did you get?” Zhou Wen immediately knew that the Cape family had definitely bought a Luck Companion Egg from Wang Lu.

“Only a few dozen times more expensive than the purchase price,” Wang Lu answered easily. After knowing that Zhou Wen was selling the Heavenly Robe, she began acquiring all the Luck Companion Eggs on the market. Most of them were in her hands.

“Now that you’ve earned so much, the debt I owe you should be written off, right?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Those are two separate matters. Furthermore, I earned it with my own abilities. Why should I count it as payment?” Wang Lu curled her lips.

“You’ve earned so much, yet you’re still so greedy?” Zhou Wen was helpless.

“You’re already first on the rankings, but aren’t you still working hard to advance?” Wang Lu paused and asked, “How’s Little Chan?”

“She’s still on the Moon. Don’t worry. I just went to visit her two days ago and she’s learning from Lady Supreme Yin. Lady Supreme Yin is an impressive existence. If Little Chan learns from her, there’s a high chance that she will become an impressive figure in the future.” Zhou Wen had indeed visited Wang Chan, but her situation wasn’t as optimistic as he had said.

Wang Chan had suffered quite a bit under Lady Supreme Yin. She cried and shouted about returning with Zhou Wen. It wasn’t easy for Zhou Wen to get her to continue staying there.

“That’s good. I don’t really have extravagant hopes that she will become an impressive figure. As long as she won’t be troubled by misfortune in the future and can live happily, that’s enough.” Wang Lu also knew that Wang Chan definitely wouldn’t have it easy. Success didn’t come easy in this world.

To be able to follow a powerhouse at the level of Lady Supreme Yin was indeed an opportunity for Wang Chan. If Wang Chan could control her abilities in the future, be it for Wang Chan herself or the entire Wang family, it would be an excellent outcome. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“By the way, when are you going to repay the debt you owe me? Don’t just give me lip service every time, alright?” Wang Lu said.

“Have you had dinner?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.

“Not yet. Why? Do you want to treat me to dinner? You are still in Luoyang, so you won’t make it in time, right?” As Wang Lu spoke, she suddenly heard a knock on the door.

“Didn’t I say not to call me over for dinner?” Wang Lu said in puzzlement.

There was no answer from the door. The person outside continued knocking.

“I already said not today…” As Wang Lu spoke, she opened the door. Before she could finish her sentence, she was stunned. The person standing outside the door was Zhou Wen.

“It shouldn’t be too late to treat you to dinner, right?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.

After advancing to the Terror grade, the teleportation accuracy of Singularity Universe was much higher with the activation of The Disqualified. Typically, teleportation only had a deviation of twenty to thirty kilometers. Zhou Wen’s luck was pretty good this time. He landed only a few kilometers away from Wang Lu’s house, so he quickly rushed over with instant transmission.

“That depends on what you are treating me to. I’m very picky,” Wang Lu said with a smile.

“I’ll do the cooking. It should be alright,” Zhou Wen said as he took out utensils and ingredients from the Chaos Bead.

He set up a stove in the yard and quickly made a few dishes. He even took out the sake wine that An Sheng had prepared for him and decorated the dining table beautifully.

Seeing Wang Lu walk over, Zhou Wen hurriedly went over and pulled out a chair for her.

Wang Lu sat down and looked at the spread that Zhou Wen had meticulously prepared. She curled her lips and said, “Speak. What’s the matter?”

“How can there be anything the matter? I’m just treating you to a meal,” Zhou Wen said.

“If you don’t want to say it now, don’t say it today. I don’t like to hear nonsense while eating.” Wang Lu rolled her eyes at him.

“Ahem. Actually, it’s really nothing serious. I just haven’t been very lucky recently. I keep failing at fusion when I’m gaming. I want to rub off some good luck from you,” Zhou Wen said with a light cough.
