Chapter 1549: Something’s Not Right

Translator: CKtalon

The green-armored Starlord stood there without any intention of taking the initiative to attack. He stared coldly at the blood-colored avatar as though he was saying: “Didn’t you want to kill me? Bring it on.”

Zhou Wen summoned Bamboo Blade and slashed at the green-armored Starlord.

The green-armored Starlord didn’t dodge. He stood there, allowing Zhou Wen free rein to slash at him.

The Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand was as fast as lightning as he slashed at the green-armored Starlord repeatedly. With the Bamboo Blade’s destructive power and Zhou Wen’s strength, he had strength equivalent to the Calamity grade.

He only left scuffs on the armor after slashing more than a hundred times. He failed to really injure the green-armored Starlord.

Wounds appeared on Zhou Wen’s body one after another. The spot where his body was injured was where the Bamboo Blade had left a saber mark on the green-armored Starlord.

Bang!

Just as Zhou Wen stopped his saber, the green-armored Starlord suddenly punched the blood-colored avatar, killing it. The game screen went black.

Zhou Wen didn’t immediately enter the game again. Instead, he closed his eyes to recall the battle.

The power of the green-armored Starlord appears reflective, but it’s definitely not as simple as a reflection. No matter how strong a reflection is, it’s impossible for him to identically transfer his injuries to someone else…?The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more excited he became.

He liked such novel dungeons. It was very boring to always grind repetitive dungeons.

He failed to figure out the problem despite plenty of thinking. All he could do was continue grinding dungeons.

He didn’t know how many times he tried, but the outcome was the same. No matter what kind of attack hit the green-armored Starlord, the injuries would return to him. It was unbelievable.

He came up with all sorts of methods. He could only defend without attacking; otherwise, just injuring the green-armored Starlord would doom him.

It was useless to blindly send himself to his death again and again, so Zhou Wen decided not to grind the Big Dipper instance dungeon. He switched to other dungeons to change his train of thought.

However, even if he couldn’t kill the green-armored Starlord, Zhou Wen still had a chance of returning home. He was probably the only one on Earth who could kill two Starlords in a row.

“Master, here’s your roasted meat.” Leem delivered roasted meat during meal time.

“You can have it.” Zhou Wen had been having a lot of roasted meat recently and was sick of it. He really couldn’t force himself to eat it.

“That’s not too nice, right? This is for you, Master,” Leem said.

“I told you to eat it. Do you dare say no? Just eat it in peace,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“Thank you, Master.” Although Leem said that, she didn’t eat the roasted meat. She continued looking at Zhou Wen eagerly.

When Zhou Wen saw Leem’s expression, he immediately understood what she was up to. He took out some seasonings and handed them to her. “Sprinkle them yourself.”

“Thank you for the reward, Master.” Leem held the seasoning bottles and was so excited that she nearly couldn’t say a word.

Humans here are easily satisfied. When they come into contact with the flourishing Earth, I’m afraid there won’t be such simple happiness,?Zhou Wen thought.

Leem took the seasonings and ran to Liz. The two of them sprinkled seasonings on the roasted meat and ate until their mouths were covered in oil.

You’re at the Epic stage after all. There’s no need for you to eat so messily.?Zhou Wen shook his head with a wistful smile.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen realized something. He looked at Liz and Leem again.?Something’s amiss. Liz and Leem are at the Epic stage. To be able to reach the Epic stage at their age means they are extremely impressive geniuses based on my experience on Earth. But how did they advance to the Epic stage?

The humans in Regretless City were too weak, so weak that Zhou Wen didn’t even realize a problem with them.

However, on careful thought, most of the humans in the city were at the Legendary stage. There were also quite a number of Epic experts, but how had they advanced?

There were no low-level dimensional creatures in a place like Regretless City. The weakest dimensional creature outside was at the Mythical stage, but Regretless City couldn’t even find a single Mythical creature. How could they hunt?

“Liz, let me ask you something. You need to answer truthfully,” Zhou Wen called her over and asked.

“I’ll answer anything, Master,” Liz hurriedly said.

“How do the humans in your city advance all the way from the Mortal stage? What tools do they usually use?

“What does advancing mean?” Liz asked in puzzlement.

“Do you know about Life Providences and Life Souls?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.

“Yes, isn’t that something that comes with birth? There’s no need to advance,” Liz answered.

“You have them from birth? Are you sure?” This time, Zhou Wen was truly excited. It was unimaginably simple. Humans here were born at the Legendary or Epic stage.

“Of course I’m sure. Everyone in our city has a Life Providence after being born. Some stronger children will even have a Life Soul at birth,” Liz said after some thought.

How did these fellows do it? From the looks of it, I have to investigate.?Zhou Wen decided to figure out why the people in Regretless City received such treatment.

“Liz, what’s your Life Providence and Life Soul?” Zhou Wen asked her first.

Liz and Leem walked over. Upon hearing Zhou Wen ask them, they explained their Life Providences and Life Soul abilities in detail.

The more Zhou Wen listened, the more alarmed he became. Their Life Providences and Life Souls were very special. They were better than the Life Providences and Life Souls of many humans on Earth.

“Get the City Lord over.” Seeing that Liz and Leem couldn’t explain it clearly, Zhou Wen planned on summoning someone useful over. Perhaps he could explain it clearly.

Zhou Wen learned some useful information from the City Lord.

It was said that the humans in Regretless City were indeed very weak in the past, but as time passed, they slowly became stronger.

In the past, babies born were very normal. They were all at the Mortal stage, but over the generations, babies born in Regretless City now had extremely powerful abilities at the Legendary stage. There were even terrifying existences at the Epic stage.

The City Lord couldn’t explain the exact reason.

“I had a few guesses before, but I couldn’t confirm them,” the City Lord said after some thought.

“Share them with me.” Zhou Wen was now very interested in these things.

“There are three reasons according to legend. One is that because we often eat grass roots, they improve our physiques and make us better.”

“What about the second?” Zhou Wen felt that this theory wasn’t reliable. He had recently tried everything they ate. There was nothing special about the grass roots. They weren’t even considered ordinary dimensional plants. At most, they were considered mutated plants.

“The second theory is related to a treasure in Regretless City. Legend has it that there’s a treasure buried there.. Two ancestors brought it out of the Garden of Eden,” the City Lord said after some hesitation.
