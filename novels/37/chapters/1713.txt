Chapter 1714 Pheasant?

“Eldest Senior Brother, don’t you think this setup looks a little like something?” Zhou Wen said as he stared at the pit on the ground.

“I don’t think so.” Liu Yun turned his face and deliberately avoided Zhou Wen.

“Put that metal container into the pit. If you do So, I think it resembles...” Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, Liu Yun interrupted him violently.

“Shut up. What do you mean it resembles something? It resembles nothing. Cut the crap! There’s a door there. Let’s see if it can be opened.” As Liu Yun spoke, he walked towards the door without looking back as though he was running for his life. There was even a faint retching sound.

Zhou Wen immediately understood that Liu Yun definitely had the same thoughts as him.

No matter how I look at it, it looks like a squatting toilet. Could the metal container be Kunlun Mountain’s toilet? If the metal container is really a toilet, wouldn’t that make the so-called Golden Elixir Pills that Liu Yun ate... Zhou Wen thought to himself.

However, he quickly had second thoughts. I don’t think so. How strong are the fellows in Kunlun Mountain to produce feces that can advance a person to the Calamity grade!? “The door here can be opened. There seems to be a garden behind it.” Liu Yun had already cracked open the door with a push and looked out.

Zhou Wen hurriedly followed and looked out through the crack in the door. Indeed, there was a garden outside. All sorts of flowers and plants that he had never seen or heard of were scattered across the garden. They looked like they had grown naturally and hadn’t been artificially tended. However, they had a strange beauty to them, as though they were deserving of such beauty.

The garden seemed huge with no end in sight. There was a blue sky and white clouds above them with no other buildings.

“There seems to be a creature over there,” Liu Yun whispered. Zhou Wen also saw a white bird lying in a flower patch in the distance. Due to the cover of the flower shrubs, he couldn’t see its full appearance. He only saw that its upper body resembled a peacock, but it was somewhat different.

“Could that be the phoenix you mentioned?” Zhou Wen whispered to Liu Yun.

“Are you stupid? A phoenix lives on a divine tree. How can a phoenix set up a nest in grass? Besides, have you seen a white phoenix?” Liu Yun rolled his eyes and said angrily. “That’s true. That’s a pheasant in the grass.” Zhou Wen thought that it made sense.

The two of them carefully sized up the surroundings through the crack in the door. Apart from the white pheasant, they didn’t see any other creatures, much less any other buildings.

“That’s strange. There’s only one pheasant here. Then who’s the toilet for? Could it be that pheasant?” Zhou Wen muttered.

“Do you believe that I’ll fight you to the death if you continue?” Liu Yun felt like vomiting again as he forcefully held back.

“I’m just saying. Don’t take it seriously. Perhaps it’s not a toilet at all,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

Liu Yun gritted his teeth and didn’t make a sound. He continued observing the situation outside. After a while, he said, “Should we go out and take a look? There seems to be only a pheasant in the garden. It shouldn’t be too dangerous.”

“That might not be the case.” Zhou Wen didn’t think so.

If the things inside the metal container were really produced by the pheasant, Zhou Wen felt that heading out with Liu Yun was equivalent to delivering themselves to their deaths.

“Forget it. Let’s go out. There’s almost no time. It’s best if we retrieve the sword early,” Liu Yun said gloomily.

Just as the two of them were about to return the way they came, they suddenly heard a strange cry coming from the garden.

“Quack! Quack!” The white bird let out a strange cry that sounded like a duck’s quack. The sound was extremely unpleasant.

After a few cries, the white bird stood up. Only then did Zhou Wen and Liu Yun see its full appearance.

Its head looked a little like a peacock’s, but its back was like a pheasant’s. It didn’t have the long feathers of a peacock.

“Pui, it’s really a pheasant.” Liu Yun cursed his bad luck inwardly. If the things inside the metal container were really shat out by this pheasant, he felt his stomach churn just thinking about it.

After the pheasant stood up, it leisurely strolled in the garden. After taking a few steps, it pecked at the flowers. It was unknown what it was pecking at.

After Zhou Wen saw what the pheasant was doing, he felt a chill run down his spine.

The pheasant was eating the fruits in the grass, but the fruits looked a little strange. The fruits in the grass were the size of a fist and looked like babies in a uterus.

With Zhou Wen’s eyesight, he could see that there were clear facial features on the faces of the grass fruits. If it wasn’t for the grass vines, he would have imagined that it was a baby that had been taken out prematurely via a C-section.

The pheasant swallowed each fruit in one mouthful. It was unknown what they tasted like.

“Could this thing be a ginseng fruit? That thing blooms every three thousand years and bears fruit every three thousand years. It needs another three thousand years to ripen. It’s a good thing that takes ten thousand years to produce.” Liu Yun’s eyes lit up when he saw this. It was obvious that he was up to no good.

“Is your brain damaged? Ginseng fruits grow on the ginseng fruit trees. What’s here is clearly a grass fruit. Furthermore, the legendary ginseng fruit should be in the house of that Earth Immortal ancestor. Why is it on Mount Kunlun?” Zhou Wen said angrily.

“That’s true.” Liu Yun was immediately deflated.

As the two of them were talking, they suddenly heard the pheasant let out another ugly cry and run. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Zhou Wen hurriedly looked over and was slightly alarmed by the scene he saw. He saw the pheasant running with all its might, chasing after a grass fruit.

The grass fruit was much bigger than the typical grass fruit. It was completely white like a chubby baby. The pheasant chased after it, and the grass fruit baby ran ahead. It jumped around in the garden, and the pheasant wasn’t able to catch up to it.

After watching for a moment, Liu Yun cheered inwardly. He was glad that he hadn’t really gone out. Otherwise, if he had really been targeted by that pheasant, it would be a question if he could come out alive.

The speed at which the pheasant chased after the baby was so fast that even they as Calamity-grade creatures couldn’t see it clearly. Even if they could see it clearly, their reaction speed couldn’t keep up.

“Let’s leave quickly.” Liu Yun felt that this place was too dangerous. It was best to leave as soon as possible.

“Let’s watch a little longer.” Zhou Wen kept staring at the grass fruit baby.

The grass fruit baby’s speed wasn’t slower than a pheasant’s. Furthermore, he could use the soil, flowers, and other objects in the garden to escape. It didn’t seem like it was only proficient in Earth Escape, but it could also use Wood Escape and Water Escape.

This thing is a little like a Ginseng Baby Companion Beast, but it’s at an even higher level. Ginseng Babies only know how to escape through the earth. This fellow has already displayed three escape techniques. Could it be that it can use the escape techniques of all five elements? Zhou Wen was intrigued by the grass fruit baby.
