Chapter 1284: Good Junior Brother

People watched the live broadcast nervously. Although the first six bullets were powerful and beyond human, several creatures had proven to humanity that they could dodge or even block them head-on.

However, no creature seemed to be able to resist the seventh bullet head-on.

Bang!

When the seventh gunshot sounded, everyone couldn’t help but tremble. When they took a careful look, they realized that the dwarf’s body had slammed into the wall again.

However, this time, even the metal wall had caved in, forming a circular pit.

The dwarf’s body was embedded in the circular pit. The powerful shockwave had sent his hair flying. His mouth was covered in blood, and between his teeth, a bullet that looked like a spark was spinning rapidly. It ground against his teeth and produced ear-piercing sounds and smoke.

Just this scene left one’s teeth tingling in pain.

The dwarf bit the bullet, but the bullet was still spinning like a drill. Perhaps the moment he relaxed, the bullet would drill into his head and penetrate it.

This was the first time humans had seen the seventh bullet clearly, but it was only relative. In fact, due to the spinning speed and the intense sparks, they couldn’t see what the bullet looked like. All they could see was a general outline.

It was completely different from the first six bullets. After the first six bullets were shot out, their momentum would slowly diminish.

However, the momentum within the seventh bullet didn’t diminish. It was as though it wouldn’t stop unless it killed someone. The momentum showed no signs of weakening.

The dwarf’s teeth were smoking, and his gums were bleeding profusely. He used his hands and feet to support himself and jumped out of the hole with difficulty. With the bullet between his teeth, he walked towards the door step by step.

Bang! Bang!

The sound of firing rang again. Before the dwarf could resolve the bullet between his teeth, the eighth and ninth bullets came at him.

This time, he didn’t have the ability to bite down again. As his body was resisting the seventh bullet, it was difficult for him to move quickly. All he could do was dodge the eighth bullet. The ninth bullet hit his arm, causing blood to gush out.

Bang! Bang!

Bullets kept firing over, leaving bullet holes in the dwarf’s body. Blood quickly stained his already red skin.

The dwarf finally couldn’t keep the seventh bullet between his teeth. The moment his teeth relaxed slightly, the seventh bullet bounced off and shot into his head.

The sound of a head exploding made one’s heart run cold. The powerful dwarf had ultimately died due to the seventh bullet.

As the dwarf died, the seventh bullet vanished, as though Death’s mission of reaping a life had been fulfilled.

As there were no outsiders in the dimensional zone, the Cube stopped broadcasting. It was unknown if the dwarf left anything behind, so no one dared to enter to take a look.

…

“It appears it’s impossible to withstand the seventh bullet with brute force,” Zhang Chunqiu sighed.

“From the looks of it, there are roughly three ways to withstand the seventh bullet. The first way is to reach the Golden Palace before the seventh bullet is shot, preventing the seventh bullet from coming out. The second way is to find someone to die in their stead. As long as the seventh bullet kills, the calamity would be met. There’s also another way—Rely on something hard like the Looter King and one can forcefully fend off the bullet and cause the trajectory of the bullet to deviate. However, this only stalls for time. The bullet will still fly back. It’s just a temporary solution,” Xia Liuchuan said.

Zhang Chunqiu nodded slightly. “After this battle, the various factions have more or less figured out the ability of the seventh bullet. I believe it won’t be long before people begin challenging the Venusian dimensional zone.”

“Which method do you think they will employ?” Xia Liuchuan asked.

Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and didn’t say a word. As an old friend of his, Xia Liuchuan already understood what he meant. When the time came, most people would use the second method. There would be people using human lives to force their way to the Golden Palace.

After all, only the seventh bullet required death. The other bullets could be dealt with through other means.

…

In the Taklamakan Desert, Liu Yun’s body was buried in the sand, motionless as though he had melded with the desert.

Streams of light streaked across the air several times before disappearing into the distance. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Son-of-a-b*tches, you ain’t got nothing on me.” Liu Yun crawled out of the sand and spat in the direction of the streams of light.

Suddenly, Liu Yun’s body stiffened as his expression turned extremely ugly.

A sword had been placed on his neck at some point in time, but Liu Yun didn’t know who was holding the sword and standing behind him.

“Friend, don’t joke around. There’s always room for negotiation.” Liu Yun said with a smile.

“I never like to joke,” the person behind him said.

When Liu Yun heard the voice, he was slightly taken aback. He carefully turned his body to look at the person holding the sword and saw a young man. He was fair and clean with good facial features. He wore a purple trench coat that exuded a sinister beauty.

“Junior Brother Zhong, you scared me to death. Don’t joke around like that. You nearly gave me a heart attack.” Liu Yun recognized the person in front of him and wanted to push the blade away with his finger.

“I’ve said it before. I don’t like to joke.” Zhong Ziya had no intention of retracting the sword. The blade pressed closer to Liu Yun’s neck and immediately sliced into his skin. Blood trickled down the blade.

“We are fellow disciples. Why can’t we talk things out nicely? Is there a need for this?” Liu Yun’s body stiffened as he forced a smile.

“I’ll give you two choices. Help me do something, or I’ll tie you up and throw you into the headquarters of the League of Guardians,” Zhong Ziya said.

“You might as well kill me,” Liu Yun said gloomily.

“You’re my senior brother after all. It’s not appropriate to kill you personally,” Zhong Ziya said.

“Thanks?a lot.” Liu Yun almost blew a gasket. He rolled his eyes and said, “You want me to help you go to the Venusian dimensional zone, right?”

“That’s right.” Zhong Ziya nodded.

“I can help you, but I have a condition,” Liu Yun said.

“Speak,” Zhong Ziya said.

“I want Junior Brother to accompany us,” said Liu Yun.

“He can’t go.” Zhong Ziya directly rejected Liu Yun.

“Why? Don’t you think that the success rate will be much higher if Junior Brother comes along?” Liu Yun asked in puzzlement.

“He can’t die, but you can,” Zhong Ziya said.

“Thanks?A LOT. You are really my good junior brother,” Liu Yun said through gritted teeth.
