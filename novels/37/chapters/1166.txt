Chapter 1167: Unable to Tell the Truth

Translator: CKtalon

Myriad Elephant Valley looked like a valley from the outside, but after walking in, he realized that there was a sea of clouds in front of him. Continuous mountain peaks protruded from the sea of clouds. It was a magical scene.

As for the spot where Zhou Wen and company were standing, it was surprisingly the top of a mountain. Wherever they looked, they could see palaces in the sea of clouds. They looked like real existences, but also like mirages.

In the sky, there were three suns and seven moons. There were even mountain peaks that grew in the opposite direction, as though they were about to plunge into the sea of clouds from above, forming an extremely bizarre world.

Zhou Wen turned around and realized that the entrance to the valley had vanished.

The Dugu family’s old residence was extremely mysterious, unknown to outsiders. Zhou Wen didn’t know much about Myriad Elephant Valley, so he couldn’t help but marvel at such a scene.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t see the scene of the battle, nor did he discover any signs of battle. This was different from what Unkilling Dugu had said.

“The truth is obvious. You should now know who’s lying, right?” the black-robed man said to Zhou Wen with a smile.

Unkilling Dugu hurriedly explained, “Zhou Wen, don’t believe him. There’s an all-encompassing taboo in Myriad Elephant Valley. Everything here is constantly changing. Everything is a superposition of reality and illusion. Be it the mountain peaks or the palaces, they are constantly switching between reality and illusion. Second Master and the rest are trapped in the old residence. The old residence is on Boundless Mountain. At this hour, it should still be in an incorporeal state, preventing us from entering. However, as long as we reach Boundless Mountain, we can see the ethereal Boundless Mountain and those people.”

“Since you say so, I’ll take Zhou Wen to Boundless Mountain to take a look. Let’s see how long you can insist otherwise,” the black-robed man said as he turned around and flew in a certain direction.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to summon his flying mount, he saw Chick flap its wings and immediately fly up. It grew bigger and bigger in midair, quickly turning into a golden cloud.

Chick chirped at Zhou Wen as though it wanted him to sit on its back.

Zhou Wen was delighted when he saw that Chick had such a transformation ability. He carried Ya’er onto Chick’s back as Tsukuyomi and the antelope followed.

Chick glared at Unkilling Dugu when he wanted to come up.

Unkilling Dugu wasn’t in the mood to fuss over this. He summoned an avian Companion Beast and followed.

After flying for a while, Unkilling Dugu suddenly shouted, “That’s not right. The direction he’s heading in isn’t Boundless Mountain. That’s...”

The black-robed man in front stopped and stared at Unkilling Dugu with a sneer. “So that’s how it is. You want to use Zhou Wen’s strength to rush into the Shinra Temple. What a good plan.”

“Nonsense. The direction you are heading in is the Shinra Temple. Zhou Wen, this is the way to Boundless Mountain. You have to believe me,” said Unkilling Dugu anxiously.

Zhou Wen watched the two of them argue, momentarily unable to tell who was speaking the truth and who was lying.

However, Zhou Wen was more willing to believe Unkilling Dugu. This was because up to now, they had not seen a second member of the Dugu family. If the black-robed man was telling the truth, why didn’t a member of the Dugu family come out to help him explain?

As long as the other members of the Dugu family came out, they could naturally convince Zhou Wen. Although Zhou Wen didn’t know them all, he knew a few important figures of the Dugu family.

“You keep saying that the Dugu family is fine. Then call the other members of the Dugu family out.” Unkilling Dugu had clearly thought of this.

The black-robed man frowned and said, “Boundless Mountain is in an ethereal state. No one can come out.”

“Are you going to tell Zhou Wen that you are the only one guarding the entire Myriad Elephant Valley today?” Unkilling Dugu said coldly.

The black-robed man hesitated for a moment before explaining to Zhou Wen, “Today is the day of our Dugu family’s grand ceremony. Apart from me in charge of guarding the pass, everyone else is at Boundless Mountain. If you don’t believe me, you’ll know when you get there.”

“Didn’t you say that Second Master isn’t around? Now, you’re saying that they’re all at Boundless Mountain?” Unkilling Dugu caught the flaw in the black-robed man’s words.

“Second Master hasn’t returned at all. It’s naturally impossible for him to participate in the grand ceremony,” the black-robed man said.

Zhou Wen saw the two of them exchange words. Although what Unkilling Dugu said made sense, he couldn’t completely believe it.

“What kind of place is Shinra Temple?” Zhou Wen couldn’t decide who to listen to.

“Shinra Temple is the most mysterious place in Myriad Elephant Valley. There are extremely terrifying dimensional creatures suppressed inside. It’s a forbidden zone for my Dugu family. No one is allowed to enter. In the past, people from my Dugu family accidentally entered, but they were never to be found. He’s luring us over because he wants to use the power of the Shinra Temple to kill us,” Unkilling Dugu said. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Zhou Wen looked at the black-robed man who said, “Shinra Temple is indeed our Dugu family’s forbidden zone. Outsiders are not allowed to enter. It’s extremely dangerous inside.”

“In that case, why did you say that Unkilling Dugu wants to rush into the Shinra Temple?” Zhou Wen asked.

The black-robed man answered, “Others will definitely die if they enter, but it’s different if Unkilling Dugu goes in. If he enters, not only will he not die, but he will also obtain extremely terrifying power. We definitely can’t let him enter.”

“Others die if they enter, but I obtain terrifying power when I enter. Isn’t that ridiculous?” said Unkilling Dugu.

“The matter is rather complicated. It’s a long, complicated story. To put it simply, it’s related to Unkilling Dugu’s Life Providence. If he enters and obtains the power of the Shinra Temple, not only will our Dugu family be damaged, but the entire Federation will also be greatly affected. Therefore, we definitely can’t let him succeed,” the black-robed man said.

Zhou Wen really couldn’t tell who was speaking the truth.

“Zhou Wen, he’s stalling for time. Second Master and the rest are trapped in Boundless Mountain. If we are late, I’m afraid there’ll be no hope,” Unkilling Dugu said anxiously.

“Zhou Wen, I know that you have a good relationship with Second Master. If you are tricked by him and forcefully barge into the Shinra Temple, my Dugu family will be severely damaged. How will Second Master forgive himself?” the black-robed man said.

“What’s suppressed in Shinra Temple? A dimensional creature? Guardian? Or is it something else?” Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue asking.

“I don’t know. It is a secret of my Dugu family. Only the incumbent patriarchs know the truth,” the black-robed man said.

“Your claims are full of flaws. Since only the patriarch knows the truth, how do you know that I will obtain immense benefits if I enter? You are clearly stalling for time. Zhou Wen, quickly save Second Master and the rest. It will really be too late if you delay any further.” Unkilling Dugu wore an anxious expression.
