Chapter 1411: Drop Galore

Translator: CKtalon

Finally, Tyrant Behemoth’s killing alarmed the Kui in the stone temple. The stone temple’s door opened as the Kui lay inside and opened its mouth to roar at Tyrant Behemoth.

Rumble!

Tyrant Behemoth opened its mouth and wanted to rush forward to devour the Kui, but unfortunately, before it could reach it, its body was struck by the thunderclap-like roar. Blood gushed out as all the bones in its body constantly shattered.

Just as it reached the front of the stone temple, Tyrant Behemoth’s body exploded. Blood and flesh splattered everywhere—it ultimately failed to withstand the Kui’s sonar wave attack.

After all, it’s still a Terror-grade body. Compared to a true Calamity-grade, its physical strength and defense are much weaker. However, Tyrant Behemoth’s offensive strength should be infinitely close to the Calamity grade. In its boxing glove form, it should have a chance of killing the Kui.?Zhou Wen wasn’t depressed about Tyrant Behemoth not being Kui’s match.

He directly used a drop of blood to respawn and revive Tyrant Behemoth in-game before entering Yang City again. This time, Zhou Wen made Tyrant Behemoth turn into the boxing glove. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

A black boxing glove wrapped around Zhou Wen’s palm. To his surprise, Tyrant Behemoth’s boxing glove form had changed. It was somewhat different from before.

In the past, there were two ox horn-like spikes at the front of the fist, but now, there were four spikes. However, they had become much smaller and extended out from the joints like four tusks.

When Zhou Wen punched, the four tusks would stab into the enemy’s body first.

Furthermore, the tusks were black-red in color and looked like they contained poison. It was likely caused by the Poison Fang skill.

Zhou Wen stormed all the way in and stirred the Kui again. It roared from the stone temple, but unfortunately, it couldn’t injure Zhou Wen. With the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation protecting him, even the terrifying sonar wave attack was trapped in the looping space, preventing it from reaching Zhou Wen.

After the Kui came out of the stone temple, Zhou Wen took the opportunity to instant transmit onto its back while it roared, striking at its neck with the Tyrant boxing glove.

Typical creatures had harder skulls, but their necks were relatively weak. With Zhou Wen’s punch, the four tusks at the front of the Tyrant’s boxing glove tore through the Kui’s hide and stabbed into its flesh.

“Roar!” Kui let out a painful cry as it unleashed a sonic attack.

Zhou Wen had already instant transmitted into the distance. After the Kui’s sound wave passed, he teleported behind it and threw another punch at its neck.

Bang! Bang!

Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he constantly vanished and appeared around the Kui. The fist wrapped in the Tyrant boxing glove struck the Kui’s neck again and again.

Although the Kui constantly released sound waves, it couldn’t injure Zhou Wen with the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation around. All it could do was passively take a beating.

In a certain sense, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation was far better than the Heavenly Robe’s dodging. The Heavenly Robe could only dodge single-target attacks, but the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation could even block area-of-effect attacks.

However, if the strength exceeded the limits of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation, then it wouldn’t be as effective as Heavenly Robe’s 100% dodging. There were pros and cons.

The Tyrant boxing glove’s offensive strength could indeed injure the Kui, but it wasn’t easy to kill it with a few punches.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that with the Kui’s self-healing ability, it would take more time to kill it, but he soon realized that the wound caused by the tusks constantly bled black blood. The Kui’s self-healing ability seemed to have been greatly reduced. Its self-healing speed couldn’t keep up with the injuries Zhou Wen caused.

The Kui’s neck was riddled with holes. Many of its bones had already fractured. In its rage, it roared at the sky, sending sound waves through the entire Yang City dimensional zone.

It was still unable to break through Zhou Wen’s Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation. After it roared, Zhou Wen instant transmitted behind it and punched the back of its mangled neck.

Crack!

The Kui’s neck, which had already fractured in many places, couldn’t withstand it any longer. Its head drooped down.

Even so, the Kui wasn’t dead. It jumped up with its single leg in a rage, wanting to slam into Zhou Wen with its body.

Unfortunately, it couldn’t even touch Zhou Wen when it was perfectly fine, much less with its neck broken. It couldn’t even make a sound.

Zhou Wen constantly instant transmitted and attacked. After more than half an hour, the Kui’s body finally collapsed. Then, there was a tinkling sound as several crystals dropped.

Holy sh*t! Drop galore!?Zhou Wen was immediately overjoyed.

Zhou Wen roughly scanned the area and saw Essence Energy Crystals, Constitution Crystals, and Strength Crystals. Furthermore, their values exceeded a hundred. One of the crystals with the Kui shadow was the most eye-catching.

Unfortunately, no Companion Egg dropped. Zhou Wen picked up the Kui skill crystal, but he didn’t pick it up himself. Instead, he got Tyrant Behemoth to take form and absorb the stat crystals.

Tyrant Behemoth’s stats were 82. After absorbing one Essence Energy, Constitution, and Strength Crystal, its stats reached 99. Only its Speed stat was not maxed out.

With Tyrant Behemoth’s stats increased, its offensive strength would increase. It would be beneficial for Zhou Wen when killing Calamity creatures in the future.

There was only one Essence Energy Crystal left on the ground. After Zhou Wen absorbed it, his Strength stat reached 99. Like Tyrant Behemoth, he was unable to break three digits.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to study the Kui skill crystal, but he realized that there was something else on the ground. It was a black-and-white stone. It wasn’t eye-catching and there were words on it: Samsara Stone.

The Samsara Stone has finally appeared!?Only then did Zhou Wen recall that there was another Samsara function in-game. However, as he hadn’t obtained a Samsara Stone, he didn’t know what it was for.

After studying the information on the Samsara Stone, Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd.

The Samsara Stone can only send Companion Beasts back to their Companion Egg form, but what’s the point? It wasn’t easy for me to nurture a Companion Beast. If I were to return it to its Companion Egg form, wouldn’t I have to nurture it again? It would be a complete waste of time and energy.?Zhou Wen looked at the Samsara Stone in his hand and was momentarily at a loss.

Since he couldn’t take out the items in-game, and refreshing the instance dungeon would wipe out the item, the Samsara Stone would probably disappear if he didn’t use it now.

It wasn’t easy for a Samsara Stone to drop. I have to give it a try.?Zhou Wen thought for a moment and planned on trying with an unimportant Companion Beast. Apart from turning a Companion Beast back into a Companion Egg state, what other uses did the Samsara Stone have?

Zhou Wen looked at his Companion Beasts and chose one to have the Samsara Stone. After the Companion Beast ate the Samsara Stone, its body immediately emitted a black-and-white glow.. Like a distorted vortex, it sucked in the Companion Beast’s body and quickly shrank into a Companion Egg.
