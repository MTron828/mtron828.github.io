Chapter 763: Pulling Out Swords in Ancient Sword Tomb

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen searched the Great Wall for a long time but failed to find the tiny palm symbol. He wasted the afternoon just like that.

The sky had already darkened by the time he returned to the courtyard.

When Zhou Wen opened the door, he realized that Wang Chan was sitting on a stool in his room in a daze. Upon seeing Zhou Wen return, Wang Chan opened her mouth as though she wanted to say something, but in the end, she only said, “You’re back?”

“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen sat by the table and poured himself a cup of water.

“I-it’s nothing. I wanted to chat with you, but it’s already so late. I should be leaving. Let’s chat another time.” Wang Chan hesitated for a moment and ultimately didn’t say anything. She got up and prepared to leave.

She had been engaging in an intense psychological battle today. Although Wang Chan wanted to prove that Zhou Wen wouldn’t meet with misfortune because of her even if Xiao Si and Wang Lu weren’t by her side, Wang Chan still lacked confidence in herself after struggling internally for so long. She wasn’t willing to let Zhou Wen take the risk.

“Are you free tomorrow?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked Wang Chan.

“I’m free,” Wang Chan answered subconsciously.

“I want to visit the nearby dimensional zones tomorrow, but I’m not familiar with the roads. Can you take me there?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.

“To a dimensional zone?” Wang Chan was first delighted before her expression dimmed. She shook her head and said, “It’s best you get my sister to accompany you.”

“Your sister isn’t free. Aren’t you free? Can’t you accompany me?” Zhou Wen asked. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“My luck isn’t too good. I’m afraid that going to a dimensional zone with you will bring you bad luck,” Wang Chan said with her head lowered.

“What a coincidence. My luck isn’t good either. Two negatives make a positive. Perhaps my luck will improve,” Zhou Wen said.

“My luck is really bad. If you were by my side, you would be very unlucky and might die. I’m serious. I’m not joking,” Wang Chan said as she bit her lip.

Zhou Wen laughed and raised the saber in his hand in front of Wang Chan. “Do you know the name of this blade?”

Wang Chan sized up the Bamboo Blade in Zhou Wen’s hand in puzzlement. After a while, she said in surprise, “Could it be that this is the Bamboo Blade of the Four Gentlemen Blades? Is this a replica?”

“Of course not. This is the authentic Bamboo Blade. Previously, its owner died. Perhaps it’s because I’m so unlucky that it ended up being compatible with me. I’ve always been safe. Don’t worry. I’m hardy, so I’m not afraid of these things. Go back and rest. We’ll head to the Great Wall tomorrow morning to take a look,” Zhou Wen said.

“Then... Alright...” Wang Chan thought for a moment and felt that it was safer to go to the Great Wall.

There were Undying Battle Souls at Great Wall City, and they ranged from the Mortal stage to the Epic stage. However, dimensional creatures like Undying Battle Souls were very strange. They only wandered the Great Wall. Humans couldn’t harm them and they didn’t seem to have any consciousness either. They only wandered on the Great Wall and wouldn’t attack humans.

In fact, even if they attacked humans, it was useless. Just like how humans couldn’t touch them, they also couldn’t touch humans.

Wang Chan heaved a sigh of relief when she heard that Zhou Wen wanted to go to the Great Wall. Even if something unfortunate happened there, it wouldn’t be too bad.

After Wang Chan returned, Zhou Wen lay in bed and launched his newly downloaded Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon.

The Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon looked desolate. At a glance, it was a series of undulating hills. However, upon closer inspection, one would realize that they weren’t hills at all. Instead, they were graves of all sizes.

Some graves were relatively small, like small mounds. Some of them were hundreds of feet tall, like continuous hills.

However, it was different from ancient human graves. There were no tombstones in front of the graves. At the highest point of each grave was a sword.

The swords on every grave were different. There were short swords, long swords, heavy swords, metal swords, jade swords, swords carved from bones, and porcelain swords made of mud.

There were all sorts of swords that dazzled one’s eyes. Every sword was embedded into a grave, a tombstone in some uncommon fashion.

Although few outsiders had the chance to enter the Ancient Sword Tomb other than Xia family members, it was a famous dimensional zone.

Xia Jiuhuang’s first Mythical Companion Beast came from the Ancient Sword Tomb.

Back then, there were only a handful of Mythical pets in the hands of humans. Xia Jiuhuang dominated the world with his sword and fought for the Federation citizens.

The six heroes were like gods to humans.

Of course, no one knew of the existence of Mythical Companion Beasts back then. They only knew that Xia Jiuhuang’s sword was very powerful, but they didn’t know that it was a Mythical Companion Beast.

Later on, the Xia family became famous for using swords. Most sword-type Companion Beasts came from the Ancient Sword Tomb.

Some people even suspected that Primordial Sword Immortal came from the Ancient Sword Tomb, but no one from the Xia family had admitted to it.

There was something else that left Zhou Wen puzzled. For some reason, he hadn’t seen Xia Jiuhuang use a Mythical Companion Beast when he fought him.

As he walked in the Ancient Sword Tomb, Zhou Wen looked around. He had only heard An Sheng mention that unless one reached out to pluck a sword in the Ancient Sword Tomb, they would remain dead objects. The swords didn’t emit any aura or power, making it impossible to gauge their levels.

Only by pulling them out could one know their true level and strength.

Drawing a sword was also a skill. This was because one didn’t know the stats, abilities, and level of a sword. If one was lacking in strength, pulling out a high-level sword might very well result in death.

However, if one was strong, killing a low-level dimensional creature as a result of their draw would be useless.

Zhou Wen didn’t know much about swords, nor did he plan on choosing one. He reached out and grabbed the vine sword stuck in the tiny grave beside him, hoping to pull it out.

This was because the sword grave had a strange force field that protected the swords embedded in the grave. If he wanted to destroy the swords here, he had to pull them out first.

However, after Zhou Wen exerted his strength twice, the vine sword seemed to have taken root and wasn’t pulled out by Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but carefully size up the vine sword. He saw that it looked like it was carved from a grayish-black ancient vine. The blade was slightly curved, and it didn’t look sharp. It had a very odd shape.

Could it be that I encountered a big guy for my first draw? Zhou Wen spread his legs apart and gripped the hilt with both hands. Then, he gathered all his strength and pulled it upwards.

However, the vine sword remained motionless as though it had become one with the small grave.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. His strength was already considered top-notch in the Epic stage, but even he couldn’t pull it out. This meant that the vine sword was definitely extraordinary. It might even be a Mythical dimensional creature.

Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to pull out the vine sword.
