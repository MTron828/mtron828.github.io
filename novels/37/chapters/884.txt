Chapter 885: Great Skyfiend Master’s Challenge

Translator: CKtalon

It was unknown what had happened here. It was as though a thunderstorm had struck it. All the trees were charred black, and so were the houses.

The skeleton under the tree no longer had any vitality. His clothes were tattered and there were charred marks in many places. It looked like he had been struck by lightning. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

And the crack appeared on the mountain wall where Zhou Wen had entered.

Zhou Wen glanced at the skeleton and turned to walk out of the valley. After walking out of the crack in the mountain, his Pocket Universe locating ability was immediately restored.

What a strange dimensional zone. Zhou Wen looked at the mountain wall behind him and realized that the crack had vanished as though it had never appeared.

Zhou Wen had seen many dimensional zones, but this time, it was a wonder. Although he hadn’t been able to kill a dimensional creature, it wasn’t without benefits. The 3,000 sword intents were genuine. It was extremely beneficial for Zhou Wen’s swordplay practice.

After being trapped in the valley for so many days, Zhou Wen was worried that the old alchemist would have caught up. After leaving the valley, he left with Ya’er in one direction at full speed.

This time, Zhou Wen tried his best to choose a path that humans were still using to prevent himself from falling into a strange dimensional zone like Peach Blossom Spring.

When he arrived at a human city, he realized that everyone in the city was talking about Great Skyfiend.

After searching online, he immediately knew what had happened.

A Mythical Companion Beast ranked in the top ten had challenged Great Skyfiend, but it was instantly killed. It didn’t even have the chance to escape or admit defeat.

This was not the most shocking thing. The most shocking thing was that the Great Skyfiend actually said that she was called Uesugi Nao and was from the Overseas Federation.

Humans could actually participate in the ranking battle. Furthermore, she was from overseas, and had actually obtained first place on the rankings. Such explosive news immediately spread throughout the Federation. The Federation’s upper echelons had no way of controlling it.

There were cubes everywhere. Many people had seen Uesugi Nao’s speech, so there was no way to hide it.

Furthermore, Uesugi Nao even admitted that she was Orochi’s master. In front of the entire world, she officially challenged Tyrant Behemoth’s master in a bid to avenge her humiliation.

Most of the Federation’s citizens hoped that Tyrant Behemoth’s owner would participate in the battle and defeat the overseas Uesugi Nao.

However, most people didn’t know who Tyrant Behemoth’s owner was. They only guessed that it was likely someone from the six families. Therefore, many media outlets were exerting pressure on them, hoping that the six families could get Tyrant Behemoth to fight.

However, on the fourth day, the six families didn’t respond. This left the Federation citizens very displeased.

Zhou Wen had just learned of this matter, so it was naturally impossible for him to challenge Uesugi Nao. Even if he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have challenged her.

Without a Guardian, there was no way to enter the cube to participate in the battle. A pure human body couldn’t meet the requirements of being at the Mythical stage, nor could it activate the cube to enter the rankings.

“Old Zhou, are you going to participate in the battle? That Uesugi Nao is very arrogant. Go and teach her a lesson.” Zhou Wen unlocked his phone and realized that many people had left him a message. This message was from Li Xuan.

“Do you have any plans to fight? If you plan on fighting and need any help, our Zhang family is willing to support you. This is what my brother wants me to tell you.” This was from Zhang Yuzhi.

There were also some messages from other people. Basically, they were all related to the matter of Uesugi Nao.

“I’m not fighting.” Zhou Wen sent a group message and replied en masse.

“That’s such a pity. If you defeat Uesugi Nao, you will be a true national hero,” Li Xuan replied.

“I’m not suitable to be a hero.” Zhou Wen paused before asking, “How are you? When are you coming back?”

“I’m almost done learning here. I’ll be back in a couple of weeks. Why? Do you miss me, your handsome eldest senior brother?” Li Xuan joked.

“That’s right. I miss you dearly. When you return, you have to inform me immediately.” Zhou Wen had recently gained new insights into the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul. He needed a sufficiently strong opponent to be his sparring partner and help him advance to the final Perfect Body. After some thought, he realized that Li Xuan was the most suitable candidate.

“Haha, definitely.” Li Xuan was still very happy. He had no idea what awaited him when he returned.

After a while, An Sheng also sent a message. “Young Master Wen, Madam has already investigated the matter regarding Xie Yukun that you mentioned. It’s true that six people in that department, including Xie Yukun, vanished at the same time. That period was when Old Mister Ouyang set up an expedition team to Zhuolu.”

“In that case, this matter might be related to that department?” Zhou Wen asked.

“That’s hard to say. Due to all sorts of reasons, those people have resigned. It’s still unknown if their actions are related to that department. We are still investigating further,” An Sheng said.

“How can there be such a coincidence? Six people from a department resigned at the same time, and it happened to be related to the expedition team?” Zhou Wen naturally refused to believe that there was no connection.

“Let’s wait for the results of the investigation. It’s very easy to make wrong judgments without any evidence.” An Sheng paused before saying, “Young Master Wen, Madam wishes that you visit.”

“What’s happened?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“It’s not a big deal. Madam just wants to introduce a girlfriend to you,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be taken aback. I’m still schooling. Why would Sis Lan think of introducing a girlfriend to me?

An Sheng smiled and said, “There’s nothing we can do about that. Madam previously arranged a blind date for Overseer, but he made it uncomfortable for everyone. Madam has already given up on him. She plans to place all her hopes on you.”

Zhou Wen broke out into a cold sweat. “Help me tell Sis Lan that I probably won’t be able to return any time soon.”

An Sheng said, “Actually, I think the girl Madam is introducing is pretty good. Not only is she smart, but she’s also very reasonable. Her background isn’t bad, and she’s beautiful...”

“I’ll consider it when I need it...” Zhou Wen said helplessly.

“I think you should come back,” An Sheng said.

“I really can’t go back. I still have something to do. Let’s talk about it another day.” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to return. He wasn’t in the mood to consider such matters. The elder was still pursuing him. Who knew when he would catch up. When that happened, the people around Zhou Wen would probably be implicated.

How can I finish off a Terror-grade expert? Zhou Wen thought about it and couldn’t come up with a good solution.

Although I have many Companion Beasts, none of them are at the Terror grade. It’s impossible for me to kill that elder. Only the Terror grade can deal with the Terror grade... Wait... Although I don’t have a Terror-grade Companion Beast... It doesn’t mean that there’s no Terror grade that can deal with him... Zhou Wen seemed to think of an idea.
