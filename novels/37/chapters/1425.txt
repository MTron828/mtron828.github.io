Chapter 1426: Sword Combat

Zhou Wen’s The Disqualified had the ability to spy on the weakness of everything, so he naturally understood immediately that it was impossible to see Xiao’s sword clearly, but he could determine the necessary actions he needed from Xiao’s actions.

To others, it was impossible to block all attacks with just judgment in such a fast battle. However, Zhou Wen was relaxed and at ease.

All things had their strengths, but they definitely had their weaknesses. Unless the other party’s overall standard was strong enough to crush Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen would ultimately grasp their weaknesses.

Xiao naturally discovered the problem as his sword art suddenly changed.

Xiao wanted to use an ever-changing sword art to make Zhou Wen make a mistake. Just one mistake, even if it was just a millisecond slower, would be enough to deal a fatal blow.

“Why is Xiao’s sword art… Why is it… a little strange…” Zhang Yuzhi’s eyesight wasn’t good enough, so she could only make out a blur. This allowed her to feel that Xiao’s sword art was somewhat different, but she couldn’t tell what was different.

Zhang Chunqiu said with a heavy expression, “It looks like an incorrectly done jigsaw puzzle, right?”

“Yes, that’s the feeling. What’s going on? With the standards Xiao displayed, his sword art should have already entered a sublime realm. It’s impossible for him to make such a mistake,” Zhang Yuzhi hurriedly said with a nod.

“That wasn’t a mistake, but a deliberate action on Xiao’s part. The first move he’s using now comes from different sword arts. The previous move is completely different from the next move’s style. It’s even diametrically opposite. It’s to make it difficult for Human Sovereign to determine the angle and position of his sword.”

Zhang Chunqiu paused for a moment before continuing with a frown, “This Xiao is really extraordinary. There aren’t any flaws despite using all sorts of sword arts; yet, it makes one feel as though there’s something misaligned. What’s even more terrifying is that the sword techniques he’s proficient in almost encompass all the types of sword techniques I know. To be able to master all sorts of sword arts to such an extent is testament to this fellow’s immense talent.”

“Won’t Human Sovereign be in grave danger? You previously said that Human Sovereign relied on determining his actions to withstand his attacks. Now, with the combination of such random swords, and with it being difficult to distinguish what’s real, wouldn’t Human Sovereign immediately be severely injured if he makes a mistake?” Zhang Yuzhi said worriedly.

“In theory, it’s indeed very difficult not to make any mistakes. However, Human Sovereign probably can’t leave even if he wants to. He has to not make any mistakes or think of a way to counterattack. Otherwise, he’s a sitting duck,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

An Sheng and Li Xuan were already so nervous that they were mute. They naturally could tell that Zhou Wen was in a terrible situation.

There were thousands of sword arts in the world. It was impossible for a person to have seen all the sword arts in the world even if he spent his entire life doing so.

Furthermore, there was a technique of faking moves in sword arts. If Zhou Wen made a wrong judgment once, his outcome would be tragic. From their point of view, Zhou Wen was dancing on the tip of a blade. Any carelessness would immediately lead to a bloody calamity.

“Where did the Holy Land find this Xiao? He’s terrifying. To be able to cultivate his sword art to such a level, even without the help of the Holy Land and Guardians, he definitely won’t be ordinary,” Xia Liuchuan said with a heavy expression.

Xia Xuanyue could also tell that Xiao’s sword art had indeed reached a sublime realm. It was probably difficult to find humans in the world who could cultivate sword arts to such a level.

Xiao was in no way inferior to the few most famous swordsmen. Furthermore, Xiao was better than them in one aspect.

Ya from the Holy Spirit Association was also a sword expert. The female sword immortal from Luoyang and Swordsman Tomorrow were all sword experts, but their sword art had been cultivated to the extreme in one particular style.

However, Xiao seemed to have cultivated all the sword arts in the world to the limit. Even a slightly less talented swordsman could not match the sword moves he casually unleashed despite practicing his entire life.

However, in Xiao’s hands, such sword arts seemed basic.

“Lord Holy God, Xiao is indeed talented. He’s probably the only Saint who can cultivate sword arts to such a level,” the old Saint by Holy God’s side whispered.

“His sword arts are indeed very good, but such sword arts can’t kill Human Sovereign,” said Holy God indifferently.

The Saint was immediately alarmed when he heard that. “Such a sword art, coupled with the Trajectory technique that even a Calamity-grade might not be able to see clearly, still can’t kill Human Sovereign?”

Even a Calamity-grade creature would probably find it difficult to last long in a melee battle with Xiao. There would ultimately be times when they made miscalculations.

“This Human Sovereign is indeed a hero among humans. It’s a pity I didn’t discover him in the past,” Holy God said with interest.

The old Saint naturally understood that the pity the Holy God mentioned was that Human Sovereign couldn’t be nurtured into a Saint.

“If Lord Holy God is interested in him, you can let Xiao spare his life. It won’t be difficult for him to join the Holy Temple and become a Saint,” the old Saint said.

Holy God turned his head to look at the old Saint. The old Saint’s body immediately trembled as he hurriedly knelt down and prostrated on the ground. With a trembling voice, he said, “I spoke too much. Your Excellency, please mete out punishment.”

“You are not allowed to say a word for three years. Commit suicide if you violate it,” Holy God said indifferently.

The old Saint didn’t dare say a word as he kowtowed.

Holy God ignored him and continued, “All Saints have to be nurtured from birth. There can be no exception.”

…

Those who could truly tell what was happening were worried about Human Sovereign’s ability to block Xiao’s sword arts.

Or perhaps Human Sovereign could reverse the situation by using internecine methods.

However, they soon realized that Human Sovereign didn’t do so. He relied on his sword arts to fight Xiao, and the battle continued. The harrowing scene they had imagined didn’t happen.

No matter how Xiao’s sword arts changed, Zhou Wen didn’t make any mistakes. He accurately blocked all the attacks. Furthermore, his attacks caused Xiao some trouble.

“Can he really not see Xiao strike?” Xia Liuchuan, who was originally very worried, gradually wore a strange expression after watching for a while.

Human Sovereign didn’t seem to be relying on judgment to fight Xiao. Otherwise, how could he do it without making any mistakes under Xiao’s complicated sword arts?

However, they knew very well that it was impossible to see Xiao’s strike. Even if they could see it, it would be too late. Action had to be taken before Xiao thrust his sword to block it. Therefore, Human Sovereign definitely didn’t rely on sight.

“This fellow is really a monster. He’s definitely not a pure human.” Even the head of the Cape family couldn’t help but say. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I really want to fight Human Sovereign. I’ll be happy even if I die.” In the Ultimate Family Clan in the North District, Lance stared at Zhou Wen with his eyes glowing.

The Heart Defying Sword that Zhou Wen had comprehended from the three thousand sword intents covered all kinds of sword arts. With the ability of The Disqualified, no matter how Xiao’s sword arts changed, it didn’t affect Zhou Wen much.

However, Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be impressed by Xiao’s strength. Up to now, he had never used two sword arts that were identical. It greatly weakened the ability of The Disqualified.
