Chapter 415 Treasure Box

the bun-shaped boulder was about a meter tall. after zhou wen got closer, he could see the top.

there was a white jade box embedded in the middle of the boulder. when zhou wen saw that the white jade box didn’t seem particularly outstanding, he asked, “is the mythical item that you mentioned in this jade box?”

“no. that jade box is the mythical item,” the flower said.

the jade box is the mythical item? zhou wen sized it up, but he couldn’t find anything special about it. it didn’t have any extraordinary luster or mythical patterns. it looked like an ordinary box made of white jade. it was about a foot long and only about four fingers wide.

“a real treasure is right in front of you, but you can’t recognize it. you can be considered blind. based on my personality back then, i would have dug your eyes out to quell my anger.” the flower paused before continuing. “that box is a mythical expert’s mythical item. it has terrifying power. even a mythical creature like a dragon wouldn’t be able to withstand the power of the box. this chess mountain’s seal remains because of its suppression.”

“you mean that if i take it away, the seal on chess mountain will be lifted?” zhou wen asked in surprise.

he originally thought that the flower was trying to trick him into taking the treasure here and to achieve some hidden ploy. however, the first thing the flower said was to point out the importance of the jade box. it left zhou wen surprised.

the flower said disdainfully, “as such a weak human, you don’t have the right to take it away. even a mythical creature needs a special physique to be able to take it out. you’re still far from it.”

after pausing for a moment, the flower continued, “but if you can advance to the mythical stage in the future, you can come over and give it a try. you cultivate in the ancient sovereign sutra, so you might have a chance to take it away.”

only when i’m mad would i take it away. why would i allow these monsters to walk the land? zhou wen thought to himself.

the flower seemed to see through zhou wen’s thoughts as it said with a laugh, “it’s only a matter of time before the dimensional zones rule the land. even if you don’t take it, someone will take it away in the future. even in dimensional zones, this item is a unique treasure. it has killed countless mythical creatures. if you really are that great, just pretend that it doesn’t exist.”

zhou wen was tempted when he heard that. the flower’s words weren’t without reason. when that truly happened, his choice of leaving it here would only benefit someone else.

although he knew that the flower was tempting him, it was a lie to say that he wasn’t tempted. however, he couldn’t take it now.

i’ll give it a try in-game. if i can take it away in-game, it shouldn’t affect the real world, zhou wen thought to himself.

“i’ve climbed up the mountain and got my things. i’ve also given you my phone. can i leave now?” zhou wen asked.

“up to you.” the flower had no intention of stopping zhou wen.

zhou wen hurriedly climbed down again. it was harder to go down the mountain than up the mountain. thankfully, zhou wen had cultivated for so many years, so even if he didn’t fly, he was still considered agile.

“so... i’m really leaving...” zhou wen said as he looked in the direction of the flower, afraid that something would happen again.

“are you planning on getting me to keep you here on chess mountain for a meal?” the flower said coldly.

“there’s no need to be so polite. i’ll take my leave now. i’ll contact you when i have the time.” zhou wen hurriedly turned around and left. the flower had an unpredictable temperament. it was best if he could leave quickly.

when i find a loophole in-game, i’ll deal with you when i come back. after zhou wen left chess mountain, he took out the phone and saw that it had already finished downloading. there was a new game icon on the home screen.

the icon was a black mountain with the name ‘chess mountain.’

zhou wen rode the mutated stone chi back and immediately opened the chess mountain dungeon. after entering the game, the blood-colored avatar stood in front of chess mountain’s wall. there was a flower growing on it. although the cartoon-styled flower looked a little different from the real world, he could still vaguely tell that it was the flower zhou wen had seen.

although he was in-game, zhou wen held back and didn’t attack the flower because he couldn’t die yet. he headed to the underground sea every twenty-four hours to deliver a poison dragon palm at the black dragon to drain it to its death.

if it dropped a mythical companion beast, he would have made a killing. even without a mythical companion beast, it would be a huge gain for him to have a primordial energy skill crystal drop. after all, zhou wen hadn’t had the ability to kill a mythical creature yet. it was very difficult to obtain a dimensional crystal at the mythical stage.

standing in front of the mountain wall and sizing up the flower, he realized it didn’t speak like it did in real life. it just quietly grew on the mountain wall.

zhou wen decided to wait until he killed the black dragon before teaching the flower a lesson. then, he chose to leave the game dungeon.

...

in a dark cave, a seductive woman was bound by criss-cross chains. the chains with runes pierced through her bones and chained her inside the cave. she couldn’t even move and could only sit on the mountain wall. her neck and legs were chained and she couldn’t move at all.

at that moment, a phone was floating in front of the seductive woman. it was the one zhou wen had placed on the stone steps.

the seductive woman’s gaze landed on the phone, but there seemed to be a pair of invisible hands that grabbed the phone and quickly operated it.

a cell phone is quite interesting. a strange smile gradually appeared on the seductive woman’s face.

...

zhou wen returned to the encampment and finished grinding the game dungeons. having nothing else to do, he took out his books from the chaos space to read.

previously, during his battle with ják, he had gained a new understanding of lost country. however, it hadn’t reached the level where he could advance lost country to the evolved body stage. now, he could use this period of time to study it and see if he could advance further, allowing lost country to become an evolved body.

a life soul itself had a certain ability, but the usage of the life soul’s ability required the owner of the life soul to develop it himself. teleportation was only the most basic usage of spatial trajectory forces.

after receiving inspiration from ják, zhou wen thought of a different way of making use of spatial trajectories—trajectory control.

after the average person’s strength was projected out, it was equivalent to spending money. it was impossible for them to get it back and they could not repeatedly use the same money to buy things. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

however, by using the effect of spatial trajectories, he could still control the forces he sent out. they were connected to each other via the trajectory, but this connection was different from what most people thought. it was invisible and did not physically exist.

using this trajectory connection, zhou wen could be like ják. he could set up his strength as though he was burying a land mine. with a detonator in hand, he could detonate any land mines he had buried beforehand.
