Chapter 820: Returning to Chess Mountain

“There’s something else I want to show you.” After leaving the laboratory, An Sheng took Zhou Wen to the Sunset Army’s military camp.

An Sheng took Zhou Wen to a hall where there was a large amount of VR equipment.

“Try it,” An Sheng said with a smile as he handed a VR helmet to Zhou Wen.

Puzzled, Zhou Wen put the helmet on before entering a game. Soon, he nearly cried out in surprise.

This game was actually very similar to what Huang Ji was doing. However, Huang Ji was making a mobile game, while this one was much more high-end. The VR game with a full field of vision looked very similar to the real Tiger Cage Pass. Even the Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals could almost pass off as real.

However, the settings and modes were very similar to the mobile version.

“This game looks a little familiar,” Zhou Wen said to An Sheng after taking off his helmet.

“You have a part in this game as well. It’s the game that you and Huang Ji worked together to create. Overseer got Huang Ji to work with him. This is the latest result. It’s used to train new recruits,” An Sheng said.

So the sponsor Senior Huang Ji mentioned is An Tianzuo! Zhou Wen really never expected An Tianzuo to invest in a game that Huang Ji had made. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhou Wen remembered that An Tianzuo disliked him gaming. He never expected An Tianzuo to invest in this game, so it was extremely surprising.

“Overseer isn’t actually a bad person. He’s just a little more stubborn than others,” An Sheng said.

“What kind of person he is isn’t important. After all, we aren’t the same type of people. It’s impossible for us to have too many interactions in the future,” Zhou Wen said.

An Sheng shook his head and didn’t continue the topic. Zhou Wen told An Sheng about the Earth Elemental Beast’s auction.

“The Zhang family is actually auctioning the Earth Elemental Beast? Is this news accurate?” An Sheng was alarmed.

“Zhang Yuzhi told me. It shouldn’t be fake, right?” Zhou Wen said.

“What Zhang Yuzhi says definitely won’t be fake. I never expected the Zhang family to auction the Earth Elemental Beast. I reckon the other five families and some wealthy families will participate in this auction.” An Sheng’s expression changed as though he was thinking about something.

“Do you know the origins of the Earth Elemental Beast?” Zhou Wen could tell from An Sheng’s expression that he knew something.

An Sheng said, “A little. In fact, Earth Elemental Beasts are only one of the Five-Elemental Beasts. These Companion Beasts were brought out from the Founding Emperor Tomb by the six heroes. There are a total of five—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. The Zhang family obtained the Earth Elemental Beast, but I don’t know where the other four went.”

“Weren’t they brought out by the six heroes? Shouldn’t the other four be in the hands of the other families?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“In theory, yes. But the other families claim to not have the Five-Elemental Beasts. Only the Zhang family has the Earth Elemental Beast. It’s said that this matter made the six heroes very unhappy, but outsiders don’t know the truth. Now that the Zhang family is suddenly offering the Earth Elemental Beast for sale in an auction, there must be some unknown reason. By the way, did Zhang Yuzhi say why they are auctioning the Earth Elemental Beast?” An Sheng pondered.

“No.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly.

“If you are interested, you can go take a look. However, it will probably be a little difficult to obtain the Earth Elemental Beast. The auction won’t be that simple,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen nodded. He was indeed very interested, but he was more interested in a dimensional zone like the Founding Emperor Tomb. If there was a chance, he wanted to see if there was a tiny palm symbol.

“Adjutant An, the six-winged seraphim has appeared again.” As the two of them were speaking, a soldier came over to report.

“Where is it?” An Sheng asked.

“It’s near Chess Mountain.” The soldier handed the information he had just received to An Sheng.

“Near Chess Mountain? Why did she go there?” An Sheng frowned slightly.

Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange. The six-winged seraphim had been released by The Thearch after fooling John. Now, it was very normal for people who had contracted the six-winged seraphim to go to Chess Mountain.

“Do you have a specific location? I want to take a look,” Zhou Wen asked.

“According to the intelligence, the few times we discovered her recently were near the Qihe River. If you want to find her, there should be a chance if you head over there.” An Sheng handed the information to Zhou Wen.

“Alright, I’ll go take a look now.” Zhou Wen read the intelligence and realized that it was indeed written in this manner. He decided to head over to take a look.

“I still have some matters to settle, so I won’t take you there. After all, you know the place well. Deputy Governor Qin is still there. Just look for him when you get there,” An Sheng said.

...

After leaving the military camp, Zhou Wen went to Chess Mountain.

Most of the Guardians didn’t have an owner yet, so he didn’t have many choices. He would kill every single one he found, and the six-winged seraphim was a Guardian that Zhou Wen had a higher chance of killing.

The only person he needed to worry about was The Thearch. If it wasn’t necessary, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to see her.

The Thearch was definitely not as simple as an ordinary Mythical stage. Zhou Wen suspected that she was very likely at the Calamity grade. However, after arriving on Earth, her strength was weakened by the laws of Earth, reducing her to the level of an ordinary Mythical.

Even so, The Thearch was much stronger than ordinary Mythical creatures.

Ya’er was also taken to Chess Mountain by Zhou Wen. There were many strange creatures in Chess Mountain, such as Blood Threadworms. Zhou Wen suspected that they were also considered Gu, so taking Ya’er along might be of some use.

“Doctor Zhou, you’re finally here. We were just talking about you.” Before Zhou Wen arrived at Chess Mountain’s encampment, he encountered the patrolling soldiers who greeted him in surprise.

In the military camp, An Jing was training. She had been stationed inside Chess Mountain’s encampment for quite some time. Every time she fought, she did her best.

However, no matter how well she did or how many contributions she made, others would only take her for granted. This was because she was from the An family; she was An Tianzuo’s sister.

As for Zhou Wen, he had only spent a short period of time in the military camp, but he had already obtained the support of the soldiers and officers.

When others mentioned Zhou Wen, they wouldn’t talk about his relationship with the An family. They would only talk about how good Doctor Zhou was and how much they idolized him.

An Jing didn’t understand why everyone still treated her as An Tianzuo’s sister despite her having done no less than Zhou Wen at Chess Mountain.

How am I inferior to him? An Jing trained very hard because she wanted to defeat that fellow. She couldn’t lose.

Just as she was practicing, she suddenly heard a commotion coming from the military camp. An Jing thought that something had happened, but when she went out to take a look, she saw many soldiers and officers surrounding a person. It was the Zhou Wen she wanted to defeat even in her dreams.

An Jing’s heart tightened, but she quickly relaxed as she thought to herself, Perfect timing. It’s time to settle this.
