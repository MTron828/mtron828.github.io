Chapter 1366: The Devil Who Wants to Annihilate the Devil

Translator: CKtalon

With the bhikkhuni making the trip, most of the undead in Luoyang City had been cleared. The remaining few who were relatively far away and hadn’t been cleared didn’t pose much of a threat.

“He’s almost there,” Cave Era said to Hermit as she sensed the location of the temporal pocket watch.

Hermit’s eyes were filled with excitement as though he was looking forward to seeing the process of the bhikkhuni becoming a devil.

Just as the bhikkhuni was about to reach Wei Ge, she suddenly stopped.

Here it comes!?Hermit’s heart raced as adrenaline involuntarily pumped through his veins. His palms turned moist from excitement.

Suddenly, the bhikkhuni turned around without any warning and walked back the way she came.

“What’s going on? Isn’t Wei Ge there?” Hermit was slightly taken aback as he hurriedly asked Cave Era.

“He should be there… The temporal pocket watch is there…” Cave Era felt that something was amiss.

“No, he’s not there,” Hermit said with certainty. He kept looking around, but he didn’t discover anything.

As for the bhikkhuni, she was getting faster and faster. She had already rushed out of Luoyang and was heading straight for them.

“Wei Ge, come out. I know you are here,” Hermit shouted with a frown. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Since you know where I am, come over yourself.” Wei Ge’s voice came from behind them.

Hermit’s body was like a phantom as he shot out a cold beam. The cold beam shattered the forest, but Wei Ge was nowhere to be seen.

“Your Excellency Hermit, that’s not right of you. You actually treat one of your own like this. From the looks of it, I should let you have my title of Monarch Bee.” Wei Ge’s voice came from another spot.

This time, Cave Era used Time Acceleration to reach the spot, but she still didn’t see anyone.

Hermit and Cave Era exchanged looks and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.

It was impossible for Wei Ge to have such abilities. The Guardian, Balrog, he had contracted was fire-elemental. Its explosive strength was very potent, but it shouldn’t be good at speed.

“Balrog, come out,” Hermit shouted coldly.

Balrog was a Guardian who came from the League of Guardians. He was a member of the League of Guardians to begin with. Even if Wei Ge wanted to betray him, Balrog would still accept the order.

Without Balrog, Wei Ge was nothing.

“Are you looking for it?” Wei Ge’s voice sounded again, but this time, he walked out from behind a boulder.

He extended one hand and pointed his fingers at the sky. In his palm was a dancing, mysterious flame. The flame looked like an enchanting woman dancing. It exuded danger and mystery.

“Terror grade?” Hermit and Cave Era’s expressions changed when they saw the flames. Wei Ge had actually advanced Balrog to the Terror grade. This was originally impossible. Balrog’s weakness didn’t seem to be resolvable to date.

“Balrog, what are you doing? Immediately terminate the contract with Wei Ge.” Cave Era still wanted to order Balrog, but Balrog didn’t react at all. It continued dancing in Wei Ge’s palm.

“There’s no need to say another word. Why do you think I chose the Mythical Balrog? It’s not because she will be strong in the future, but because only then will I have a chance of controlling her. I like to be in control of everything,” Wei Ge said calmly.

“A pity. You did something dangerous that you can’t control,” Hermit said as a collapsible fan appeared in his hand. With a move of the fan, a fan-shaped beam shot at Wei Ge.

Wei Ge retracted his fingers as the flames in his palm shattered, turning into purple flames that enveloped his body.

At that moment, the beam had already arrived in front of him. Beams of light shot into the purple flames, boring open huge holes through the humanoid figure inside, but there weren’t any of Wei Ge’s tragic cries.

Soon, the purple flames returned to their humanoid form. They appeared like a fluid purple-flamed robe that Wei Ge donned.

“The first impression flames give is heat and explosion, but that’s not all of it. Flames also have a gentle side.” As Wei Ge spoke, Cave Era had already used Time Acceleration to appear in front of him. With her hands and feet, she struck Wei Ge repeatedly with Terror-grade power.

Wei Ge’s body swayed like flames as he dodged Cave Era’s extremely fast attack. The attack that he couldn’t dodge struck Wei Ge, but it only shook the flames and quickly returned to its original state.

Wei Ge seemed to be dancing a gorgeous tango amidst the flames. Hermit and Cave Era’s combined attacks failed to injure him at all.

The flames were like nothingness and didn’t have any strength. Any force that struck it only made the flames bend around and not injure him.

“I only extracted the nothingness of fire, not its fiery intensity. I do what’s unexpected. Even you won’t be able to harm me after I turn into nothingness,” Wei Ge said calmly.

“Why have you betrayed us?” Hermit knew that he had to finish off Wei Ge before the bhikkhuni arrived. Otherwise, once she came, she would become a devil upon approaching Wei Ge. When that happened, even they would probably perish.

“The temporal pocket watch you gave me can’t save my life,” Wei Ge said.

“If you betrayed us because of this, we can negotiate nicely. Now that you have the right to negotiate with us, you can naturally receive the treatment you deserve. In the future, the league will still need talent like you,” Hermit said.

“I’m just telling you that I know of this matter, but that isn’t the cause.” Wei Ge directly denied Hermit.

“Then what’s the reason?” Cave Era couldn’t help but ask. She originally imagined that Wei Ge had betrayed them because he knew of their plan.

Wei Ge looked up at the starry sky and said, “Because from the beginning, I was just a devil who wanted to destroy devils.”

“Haha, what a joke. Aren’t your hands stained with human blood? Are you going to tell me that you are actually a good person?” Hermit laughed.

Wei Ge said indifferently, “I’ve never been a good person. I’m just a devil who likes to play games with devils. Now, it’s time to end this game.”

“You’re right. It’s time to end this game.” Hermit took a step forward. The surrounding mountain ranges, forests, and rivers suddenly lit up.

The matter in the natural world—mountains, rivers, wind, and fire—actually formed a formation similar to the Eight Trigrams.

“Do you think I came to Luoyang without making any preparations? I originally left a backup plan to deal with An Tianzuo and Zhou Wen, but now, I’ll use it on you. Wind, fire, and everything in the world are in my Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array. Even if you turn into nothingness, flames need a medium. A flame wisp like yours won’t be able to escape my Myriad Form Eight Trigrams Array. It will only lead to destruction!” Accompanying Hermit’s voice, the surrounding mountains and rivers lit up. The power formed by everything surrounded Wei Ge from all directions.

“Have you ever heard of a single spark wrecking a plain?” The flaming muslin over Wei Ge’s body fluttered like the purple flames of a bonfire that surged into the sky.. It was beautiful and dangerous.
