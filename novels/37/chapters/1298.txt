Chapter 1299: Suspicious of Everything

Translator: CKtalon

“His reputation on Earth isn’t any better than mine. There’s no need to mention his name.” As Lord Fourth spoke, he took out two boxes and placed them in front of Zhou Wen. He continued, “These two boxes contain the Luck Pixie and a Terror-grade Black Bear Spirit. Feel free to take them.”

Zhou Wen looked at him and said, “And you are certain I’ll help you?”

Lord Fourth laughed. “Why won’t you? Because the person I’m betting with is your teacher? Are you still not disavowing a sinner like him?”

“Whether I disavow him or not has nothing to do with helping you,” said Zhou Wen.

“Then even more you should help me. Aren’t these what you want?” Lord Fourth pointed at the two boxes.

Zhou Wen looked at Lord Fourth with an odd expression, unclear what he was up to.

Zhou Wen naturally didn’t wish for Wang Mingyuan to lose. A shrewd and experienced fellow like Jing Daoxian knew as well, but he had deliberately told Zhou Wen ahead of time who his counterpart was.

Could it be that his goal isn’t for me to clear the level? Or could it be that his bet with Teacher isn’t as simple as clearing the level??Zhou Wen racked his brains, but failed to come up with an answer.

“It isn’t as complicated as you imagine. It’s just a bet. Even if you choose not to do it, there will be others to take your place. It’s just getting on the rankings, nothing difficult,” said Lord Fourth.

“What will happen if you win?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“If I win, he’ll need to give me something to aid in extending my lifespan,” Lord Fourth said.

Only then did Zhou Wen recall that Jing Daoxian had a problem with his lifespan. Previously, he had wanted Banana Fairy to help him refine some medicine, but he hadn’t done so for the past few years. He probably hadn’t found the ingredients required.

“So are you game or not?” Lord Fourth asked again.

Zhou Wen was still hesitant. Just as Jing Daoxian said, getting on the rankings wasn’t that difficult. Even if he didn’t do it, it wasn’t difficult for Jing Daoxian to find others to help him—given his strength.

However, even if others helped Jing Daoxian get onto the rankings, that person ought not to be Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen kept thinking about it.?What if I take Jing Daoxian’s items, but do not help him get onto the rankings. What if I keep stalling for time?

As though reading Zhou Wen’s mind, Lord Fourth said with an insincere smile, “You can take the items if you want them; likewise, you can choose not to do the job.”

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. “What do you mean by that?”

“After I give you the items, they are yours. You can keep them or throw them away. The bet’s deadline is still two months and eight days away. I’ll be at Lunar Deer Alley and I’ll wait for you for two months and eight days. You can choose to come or not.” Lord Fourth turned around to leave after saying those words.

“What’s the meaning of this?” Zhou Wen looked at Lord Fourth’s back, perplexed as to what he was up to.

Lord Fourth ignored him. He returned to his ship and got the captain to steer the ship away from Dossier Island.

Zhou Wen looked at the two boxes in front of him with great suspicion. Could Jing Daoxian have placed a bomb inside, thus the reason why he was so anxious to leave?

However, boxes like this were no different from being transparent to Zhou Wen. Just by carefully listening, he could tell that a necklace and Companion Egg was placed inside. There were no bombs.

The necklace was likely the Lady Luck Necklace. There was a seal on it, as though a particular method had been used to forcefully extract it from the original owner.

Under the necklace was a card. On it were the instructions for recontracting.

The Companion Egg inside the other box was a black furry ball. Jing Daoxian said that it was a Black Bear Spirit. Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of Companion Beast it was, but from the aura it emitted, he knew that it wasn’t something of inferior quality.

Could it be that Jing Daoxian is lying? Their bet isn’t about getting on the rankings but has something to do with me? If I choose not to go, will Teacher lose??Zhou Wen couldn’t help but become suspicious. This matter was just too bizarre.

What kind of person was Jing Daoxian? The number one devil in the Federation. Was he someone who would be willing to lose? He could easily produce two precious items to give to Zhou Wen. Furthermore, he had said that he left the completion of the job up to Zhou Wen.

But viewing it from a different angle, this could be a trap laid by Jing Daoxian. He deliberately made him read too much into it, hoping to exploit such thoughts of his. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

If only I could get to meet Teacher. At least I can figure out whether he had made a bet with Jing Daoxian.?Zhou Wen became overly suspicious of everything because of Jing Daoxian. He even suspected whether the person who Jing Daoxian had made a bet with was Wang Mingyuan.

Jing Daoxian might have said that on purpose to make Zhou Wen conflicted so as to achieve his goal.

Zhou Wen thought for a while but failed to come up with a reason. He decided to put away the Lady Luck Necklace and Companion Egg.

They are definitely good things. There won’t be any problems taking them. I’ll consider the rest later.?After Zhou Wen put away the items, he turned around and went to the dimensional zone on Asiri Island.

After circling the island and killing many avian dimensional creatures, he didn’t see any Lucky Birds or the tiny palm symbol. All Zhou Wen could do was return resentfully.

On the way back, Zhou Wen kept thinking about Jing Daoxian. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss. It didn’t make sense for Jing Daoxian to give him such a huge benefit for no reason.

Could it be that there’s something wrong with these two Companion Beasts??Zhou Wen took out the Lady Luck Necklace and the Black Bear Spirit Companion Egg and carefully studied them, but he didn’t discover any problems.

How strange. Has Jing Daoxian suddenly changed??Zhou Wen couldn’t trust the situation.

“Liu Yun, do you know who Lord Fourth is?” Zhou Wen sent a message to Liu Yun, hoping to figure out if Liu Yun knew the truth.

“Lord Fourth is Lord Fourth. Why? Is there a problem?” Liu Yun quickly replied.

“Nothing.” Zhou Wen didn’t ask further.

If Jing Daoxian didn’t wish for others to know that it was him, it was normal that Liu Yun couldn’t tell. Even Zhou Wen hadn’t been able to tell at the beginning. It was only when Jing Daoxian deliberately spoke in his own voice that Zhou Wen had identified him.

“What happened? Are you alright?” Liu Yun sent another message.

“It’s fine. Let’s put the matter of Lord Fourth aside for now. I’ll inform you when I’ll carry out the job in the future.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and sent another message: “Do you have a way to contact Teacher?”

“No… Why don’t you ask Zhong Ziya? Perhaps he has a solution,” Liu Yun replied.

“Got it.” Zhou Wen opened his contact list and found Zhong Ziya. He sent a message: “Is there a way to contact Teacher?”

“No.” Zhong Ziya quickly replied. It was a simple word, and he didn’t say anything else.

Zhou Wen sent Hui Haifeng and Jiang Yan the same message. Hui Haifeng said that he hadn’t seen Wang Mingyuan since the Holy City incident.

Jiang Yan didn’t reply.. His situation was unknown.
