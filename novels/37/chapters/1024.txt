However, the freezing beams passed through the man’s body as though his body was an illusion. They didn’t do a thing.

“It’s useless. Your strength is too weak. You don’t have the right to touch me.” The masked man watched as Lance’s fist and person passed through his body. He stood there and continued, “If it wasn’t because this body is too old, you wouldn’t even have the right to see me.”

As he spoke, the masked man’s eyes focused. Just like before, Lance, Gaiman, and company immediately recovered their dazed states and were completely unable to move.

“Seeing that Frod did a good job, I’ll forgive your rudeness this time, but don’t do it again.” After the masked man said that, Lance and company immediately regained their freedom.

“This is your deal with our family. If you want a body, take mine. Don’t implicate others,” said Lance.

“Lance...” Gaiman wanted to drag Lance away, but Lance dodged him.

“Are you really willing to let me take away your body? Do you know that although your body can continue living, your consciousness will be completely wiped away? I don’t need your consciousness,” the masked man asked Lance with interest.

“I’ll settle my own matters. There’s no need for others to replace me. It won’t be that easy for you to occupy my body,” Lance said calmly.

“From the looks of it, humans nowadays seem to have more backbone than before. Unfortunately, I’ve already changed my mind. I want his body, and your body is already useless to me. I won’t change my mind. It’s up to you whether you leave or stay, but I want his body,” the masked man said as he looked at Zhou Wen.

“Sorry, I didn’t know this would happen,” Lance said to Zhou Wen.

“It’s fine. It’s not your fault.” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly.

He was already used to being in the middle of a conspiracy. If a person didn’t have any wealth, even if he appeared in front of an evil person, the evil person wouldn’t scheme against him. That was because there was no profit to be had.

However, if a person had a huge treasure, no matter how far they hid, there would still be people targeting them. This was probably the reason why it was said that a man’s wealth was his own ruin.

As Zhou Wen’s abilities became stronger, no matter how much he restrained himself, people would still target him. It was inevitable.

Of course, Zhou Wen could accept it, but it didn’t mean that he would forgive Frod.

“Since my life should have ended here, I’ll still stay behind. Even if we really go to hell, we probably won’t be lonely,” said Lance.

“I don’t care if you want to go to hell, but I haven’t lived enough. I still want to live a few more years.” As Zhou Wen spoke, his figure suddenly vanished. He used teleportation and headed for the exit of the garden.

However, Zhou Wen soon realized that the garden’s door had vanished. There was nothing beyond the garden. There was no way out.

“Only people with my permission can walk out of here,” the masked man said with a smile.

“Then, can I leave after killing you?” Zhou Wen asked bluntly.

The masked man laughed. “Of course, you can kill me and leave this place. Unfortunately, even the strongest human is as insignificant as an ant in front of me.”

“How would I know if I don’t try?” Zhou Wen continued pulling out the Bamboo Blade.

“I’ll fight with you,” Lance said as he leaned over.

“Alright, I’ll attack the top while you attack the bottom,” Zhou Wen said. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Alright.” Lance rushed over.

Zhou Wen was behind him, but he struck the back of Lance’s head, knocking him unconscious.

“Take him back. Don’t get in the way here.” Zhou Wen carried Lance and threw him at Gaiman.

Gaiman hurriedly caught Lance and looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression. “Our family has let you down. I never expected you... Tell me whatever wish you have. As long as I can do it, I’ll definitely help you.”

Gaiman didn’t know, but no matter who it was, it would be impossible for them to be as carefree as Zhou Wen. He had even taken Lance into consideration and wanted to send him out.

“Don’t thank me. I’m a person who distinguishes kindness and hatred clearly. This matter has nothing to do with Lance. He doesn’t need to die with me, but go back and tell Frod that I’ll definitely take back what he owes me,” Zhou Wen said.

Gaiman didn’t say anything else as he bowed deeply at Zhou Wen before leaving the garden with Lance.

From his point of view, it was impossible for Zhou Wen to leave alive. In front of the masked man who was as invincible as a god, they didn’t even have the ability to resist. All that awaited them was death.

I wonder if Demonic Neonate is a match for the masked man? However, at this point in time, I can only give it a try. However, I don’t think there’s a big problem. I can’t even see Demonic Neonate’s Terror form, but I can at least see this masked man. Zhou Wen closed his eyes, preventing his gaze from coming into contact with the mask, hoping to prevent his body from being unable to move.

“It’s useless to close your eyes. The influence of this mask doesn’t target your eyes, but your soul,” the masked man said with interest.

He looked at Zhou Wen as though he was looking at a new car or house. He was filled with curiosity, but he didn’t treat Zhou Wen as a person.

Zhou Wen still didn’t open his eyes and after some thought he said, “Can I ask you a few questions?”

“On account that you are about to donate your body to me, I can try my best to answer you.” The masked man wasn’t in a rush to take action, as though he was waiting for something.

“You participated in the last Guardian battle. Then, can you tell me what the Guardians are looking for?” Zhou Wen wanted to take the opportunity to pry into some secrets.

Many powerful creatures in the dimension wanted something from Earth, but up to now, Zhou Wen still didn’t know what they wanted.

“If you ask the other Guardians this question, even if you ask 99 of them, I’m afraid none of them will know. However, you are asking the right Guardian by asking me. I’m the only Guardian among a hundred who knows.” The masked man’s answer delighted Zhou Wen.

“What is it?” Zhou Wen pressed.

“I don’t know what it is,” the masked man answered.

The corners of Zhou Wen’s eyes twitched as he had the urge to slap him.

The masked man seemed to appreciate Zhou Wen’s expression as he said with a faint smile, “Of course I wouldn’t know. This is because even the big shots of the dimensional races don’t know what they are looking for. However, there’s a clue. There aren’t many Guardians who know this clue, and I’m one of them.”

“What clue?” Zhou Wen pressed.

“Companion Beast, the strongest Companion Beast,” said the masked man.
