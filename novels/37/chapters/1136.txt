Chapter 1137: Tripartite Struggle

Translator: CKtalon

Sasser wore a look of horror. He realized that he couldn’t control his Life Soul. The movie world that shouldn’t have been changed had undergone a tremendous change.

Why is this happening? Who’s controlling my Life Soul... Impossible... Sasser looked around, but he found nothing.

He became more alarmed. He couldn’t find the other party, but they had controlled his Life Soul. This was a terrifying thought.

Sasser desperately wanted to retract his Life Soul and dispel the movie world, but it was already too late. The camera-like Life Soul seemed to have its own consciousness as it crazily absorbed Sasser’s Essence Energy. In just a moment, his face was as pale as snow. His cheeks clearly thinned.

Zhou Wen had just recovered his Essence Energy when he suddenly saw a huge storm of dark clouds in the sky. The storm poured down as lightning constantly flashed and rumbled in the sky.

The strong winds blew at the seawater, forming huge waves that came crashing over.

What was even more terrifying was that the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder that Zhou Wen had just condensed shattered once again.

What a powerful taboo power. Even the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder can’t withstand it. Are the monarchs of the dimension bent on killing me? Zhou Wen was once again relegated to an ordinary person.

Amidst the storm, Zhou Wen was thrown into the seawater by a huge wave. He kept tumbling in the bone-chilling seawater. After managing to finally surface, he found his body was almost frozen.

Bam!

Another huge wave smashed over as something slammed into Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen hugged the thing and tumbled out of the sea. It felt like a person.

After he stabilized himself and rushed out of the water with the person, he realized that it was Tsukuyomi who had slammed into him.

Not far away, there were women and children who had fallen into the water. They couldn’t escape in such a storm even if there were lifeboats. They were instantly swept deep into the sea.

Many people could have lived, but now, it was unlikely any of them could.

Zhou Wen hugged Tsukuyomi and felt that her body no longer had any warmth. She was probably close to death; this only served to make him extremely depressed.

He wasn’t sad that Tsukuyomi was dying, but even the lives of Calamity-grade creatures were in the hands of the dimensional monarchs. As for him, he was also at their mercy. Seeing so many humans die like ants filled Zhou Wen’s chest with anger and indignation, making him feel like his chest was about to explode.

However, Zhou Wen knew very well that no matter how angry he was, it was useless. The world wouldn’t change because of a human’s anger, nor would it change the rules because of human emotions.

The only thing he could do was turn his anger into motivation and work hard to understand the rules and make use of them until he became the person who decided on the rules.

Under the bombardment of the massive waves, even the huge cruise ship sank, not to mention humans. The sunken ship soon became the center of a huge whirlpool.

Zhou Wen hugged Tsukuyomi, whose fate was unknown, and was swept into the sea. His body constantly slammed into objects that were swept down by the seawater, but his frozen body didn’t feel any pain.

Sasser was about to become a dry corpse. Although he had advanced to the Terror grade after fusing with a Guardian, the power of the Terror grade still couldn’t withstand such terrifying suction.

Who is the one behind this... Who is it... Unforgivable... Absolutely unforgivable... Sasser’s eyes were red as they emitted a ruthless red glow.

He wasn’t angry because he had been used by others, or even because he might die.

The reason he was angry was because the original movie world had been wrecked to an unbearable extent.

Although he used the movie world to kill people, he never destroyed the ending as expected of the movie world.

However, under the influence of that terrifying power, the male and female protagonists in the movie world had been completely wiped out, causing a touching movie to lose its meaning of existence.

Unforgivable... Unforgivable... The last bit of strength in Sasser’s body completely erupted. The camera in his hand was emitting smoke everywhere as sparks constantly shot out, as though it had missed a spark.

Everything that happened inside the camera’s movie world began rewinding. It was as though he had pressed the rewind button while watching a movie.

Sasser wanted to restore this destroyed movie world. He definitely couldn’t tolerate the destruction of this movie he deemed a classic—even if it meant risking his life.

Zhou Wen, who was constantly deducing the Dao Sutra, suddenly felt time and space around him strangely retreat. Even the Life Mark he had engraved had vanished. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Rules... Rules... Only by understanding all the rules can I use them... Zhou Wen forced himself to calm down in the chaotic space. He engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder again and again, correcting his understanding of the rules.

Many people believed that freedom without rules and restrictions was true freedom, but Zhou Wen believed that without rules and restrictions, there was no freedom.

Only by understanding the rules and grasping them could one truly obtain freedom.

Being lawless wasn’t called freedom. It would only lead to destruction. That wasn’t what Zhou Wen needed.

Pfft!

Blood spewed out of Sasser’s mouth as he looked like a ferocious ghost. The terrifying force drove the movie world, allowing the movie plot to continue progressing.

Sasser had tried his best, but he still couldn’t stop it.

F*ck you. Get back here. The blood vessels in Sasser’s body burst, and blood flowed from his seven orifices. His blood burned, and the movie rewound again.

However, the force increased again, allowing the plot to continue moving forward.

Sasser completely disregarded his life as he unleashed his vital potential again and again, forcefully rewinding the movie.

After all, this was Sasser’s Life Soul. Although the force was extremely terrifying and even stronger than Sasser, under Sasser’s desperate efforts, they were in a stalemate. It alternated between fast-forwarding and rewinding. The entire movie world’s timeline constantly changed.

In the chaos of time and space, the marks on Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny deepened. Be it the effects of rewinding or fast-forwarding, they had little influence on the mark.

Zhou Wen finally engraved the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder again, but this time, it wasn’t over. Zhou Wen carved a Life Mark on the activated Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. The Life Mark transformed into scriptures that constantly appeared in the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It was Zhou Wen’s comprehension of the rules.

With the appearance of the scripture, the light from the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder intensified. The influence the movie world had on Zhou Wen decreased, and it was even affected by the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder.

Boom!

A strange light bloomed in the movie world.
