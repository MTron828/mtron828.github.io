Chapter 1727 Zhou Wen Draws the Sword

“Are the elites among humans as cunning as you?” the woman said coldly as she stared at Zhou Wen.

“That’s not right. You make it sound as though you aren’t human,” Zhou Wen said in thought when he saw that the woman didn’t immediately take action.

“How can I be a lowly creature like humans?” the woman said indifferently. “I’m giving you two choices now. Do you want to live or die?”

The woman spoke as though Zhou Wen’s life was firmly within her grasp. As long as she gently moved her fingers, she could crush Zhou Wen to death.

“Sigh, who wants to die if they can live?” Zhou Wen sighed.

“Come with me if you want to live.” As the woman spoke, she turned and walked towards the mountaintop. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before following the woman to the top of the mountain. As he walked, he asked, “Why do you want me to follow you up the mountain?”

“Doing what you wanted to do,” the woman answered.

“I really don’t know what I was planning on doing. Why don’t you make it clear?” Zhou Wen said.

“If you want to die, feel free to continue acting dumb.” The woman didn’t seem willing to waste her breath on Zhou Wen as she sped up.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to get some information out of her, but when he heard her say that, he quickly followed her to the mountaintop.

The stone monument and sword hilt on the mountaintop remained the same. Zhou Wen naturally saw it at a glance and couldn’t help but recite, “The appearance of the sword spells doom for the world, even mighty immortals shall meet peril.”

“Pull that sword out,” the woman said expressionlessly.

“Why do you want me to pull out the sword? What sword is that?” Zhou Wen asked the woman, but he thought to himself, Could this be the Immortal Peril Sword of the Four Immortal Vanquishing Swords?

The sword didn’t have any aura, so Zhou Wen couldn’t tell if it was the Immortal Peril Sword.

“If you have so much time to talk, why don’t you pray that you can pull the sword out? Otherwise, you will follow in your teacher’s footsteps,” the woman said coldly.

“You killed my teacher just because he couldn’t pull out this sword?” Zhou Wen said in surprise.

“Don’t test my patience.” If not for the fact that she was unwilling to take the trouble to head out and find another human, the woman probably wouldn’t have allowed Zhou Wen to say so much.

“Will you keep your word? Will you really let me leave if I pull out the sword? Will you kick me to the curb when I’ve outlived my usefulness?” Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find the phoenix that Liu Yun mentioned. He thought that it might have been killed by a woman.

I can only survive in front of the phoenix, but this woman can kill the phoenix. I wonder if the Chaos Egg can block her attack. Logically speaking, Earth hasn’t completely lost its seal, so dimensional creatures will still be greatly restricted on Earth. Even if she’s at the Apocalypse grade, she shouldn’t be able to unleash the power of the Apocalypse grade on Earth.

“I’m a woman of her word,” the woman said.

“Then I’ll believe you for now,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards the stone monument. When he arrived in front of it, he didn’t grab the hilt. Instead, he bowed at the stone monument and seemed to chant something, but it was indecipherable.

“What are you doing?” the woman asked with a frown.

“Didn’t you say that you wanted me to pray? I’m praying for the heavens to bless me so that I can pull the sword out of the stone monument,” Zhou Wen said in all seriousness.

The woman didn’t say anything else as she looked coldly at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen chanted for a while before looking up and reaching out to grab the hilt of the stone monument.

The hilt didn’t have any similarities to the hilt of the Immortal Culling Sword. It made Zhou Wen suspect if it was the Immortal Peril Sword. Logically speaking, the four swords that formed a set should have some similarities.

Who cares if it’s real or not. I’ll pull it out first. Whoever draws it naturally owns it, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he gripped the hilt with both hands and pulled.

The woman stared at the hilt and saw that it remained motionless. She immediately lost interest in Zhou Wen and raised her hand to use the Nihility Sword Aura to kill him.

The Immortals had the intention of making Zhou Wen their representative, but Zhou Wen had never gone to the Immortals with the token. Rejecting the Immortals made him their enemy. The fewer enemies like Zhou Wen on Earth, the better.

“Wait, I didn’t circulate my energy. When I finish circulating my energy, I’ll definitely pull it out,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.

It wasn’t that he was afraid of fighting the woman. After all, they had to fight sooner or later. It was useless to be afraid. However, if he could pull out the sword first, it would naturally be better than being empty-handed.

Upon hearing his words, the woman didn’t immediately kill him. She only said coldly, “I don’t have that much time to waste on you. I’ll give you thirty breaths.”

Zhou Wen didn’t know how long thirty breaths were. Since the woman was willing to let him try, he decided to continue.

He first circulated the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and attempted to pull out the sword again, but the sword remained motionless.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to switch to the First Order of Chaos before attempting to pull out the sword. However, the sword seemed to have taken root. No matter how hard Zhou Wen tried, he couldn’t budge the sword at all.

The woman stood by the side expressionlessly, but when she saw Zhou Wen use two completely different Essence Energy Arts that had already reached the Calamity grade, she thought to herself, Although this person is cunning, his talent is top-notch among humans. Without borrowing the powers of the dimension or fusing with a mutated bloodline, he can actually cultivate two Essence Energy Arts at the same time. Furthermore, he has reached the Calamity grade. It’s indeed rare. It’s no wonder that Immortal Supremacy of the race named him as a representative.

As she was thinking, she saw Zhou Wen use another completely different Essence Energy Art. Furthermore, he had also reached the Calamity grade. Her eyes couldn’t help but focus. He actually cultivated three Essence Energy Arts at the same time and they have all reached the Calamity grade. If such a talent can’t be used by us Immortals, I definitely can’t have him leave this place alive today.

The woman didn’t have any killing intent yet. Instead, she wanted Zhou Wen to become the representative of the Immortals.

Zhou Wen used the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art again, hoping to see if he could steal the sword, but there was still no reaction. This left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.

He originally wanted to draw the sword before fighting the woman. Even if he couldn’t defeat her, he could escape with the sword. After all, he couldn’t let the sword fall into the hands of the Immortals.

However, the Essence Energy Arts he had tried were useless. It was probably very difficult to pull it out.

I’ll give it another try. Zhou Wen planned on giving it a try with the Dao Sutra in the end. If it didn’t work, he would have to give up.

Although he still had the Human Sovereign Sutra to use, it was too obvious. If he used it in front of the woman, she would probably recognize him as Human Sovereign. When that happened, she might even kill him.

Even if he wanted to fight, Zhou Wen hoped to keep the initiative with him.
