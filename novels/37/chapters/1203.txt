Chapter 1204: Carving the Ancient Sovereign Sutra Again

Translator: CKtalon

The Asura was blocked by Great Brahma. Zhou Wen looked at the altar and saw that the exit in the middle of the altar had been sealed. The stone pillars had also returned to their original spots. He heaved a sigh of relief when no other dimensional creatures rushed out.

“Sis Lan, are you alright?” Zhou Wen went to Ouyang Lan’s side and asked.

“I’m fine.” Ouyang Lan felt much better after eating some pills. She said to Zhou Wen, “Little Wen, my father might still be alive.”

“You found the former principal?” Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up as he asked excitedly.

“We previously saw the undead Chu He in Netherworld City. We used some special abilities to extract some memories from him. Although the memories are incomplete, we still gained something,” Ouyang Lan said.

“What did you discover?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

Ouyang Lan pointed at the flag on the stone pillar. “This... Before Chu He was replaced, he had seen this symbol more than once on those fake expedition members.”

Zhou Wen didn’t know if this had anything to do with the conclusion that the former principal remained alive. This only meant that they came from such an organization.

Ouyang Lan continued, “Now, we have learned that this symbol is related to the Holy Temple. And after those two fellows captured us, they kept asking about my father. It’s very likely that they are looking for something. If my father has something they need and they haven’t found it, would you kill my father if you were in their shoes?”

“No.” Zhou Wen finally understood why Ouyang Lan said that the former principal might still be alive.

In other words, the former principal might be in the Holy Temple? Zhou Wen was somewhat excited. After such a long investigation, he finally knew where the former principal might be.

“Although it’s only a possibility, it’s better than blindly searching. Unfortunately, entering the Holy Land isn’t an easy task,” Ouyang Lan said with a sigh.

The Holy Land had a restriction on the level of entry. High-level humans couldn’t enter, and low-level humans were useless even if they entered. They would only have their fates toyed inside.

Zhou Wen had entered the Holy Land before, so he naturally knew that the six Holy Temples there looked like guardians of humanity, but in fact, it was an extremely strange place. If someone of a lower level were to investigate this matter, it would be no different from courting death.

“Sis Lan, this isn’t a place to talk. Get some rest. We’ll return together after I finish off Asura.” Zhou Wen got An Sheng to take care of Ouyang Lan and company before walking towards the Asura.

Zhou Wen yearned to chase after Xiao, but with An Tianzuo already chasing after him, he couldn’t join in the chase. Otherwise, Xiao might suddenly do an unexpected return, causing even more trouble if he captured Ouyang Lan as a hostage.

Xiao’s Trajectory movement technique was too bizarre. Even Zhou Wen wasn’t 100% confident that he could intercept him. Among the few Terror-grade creatures on him, only Banana Fairy and Demonic Neonate could match Xiao’s speed.

Jade Rabbit and Ice Maiden were slow. It would be impossible for them to stop Xiao if they were released.

And when Zhou Wen fought the Asura, Banana Fairy had to guard Ouyang Lan and company to prevent Xiao from launching a sneak attack. It was difficult for her to simultaneously take on another role.

As for Demonic Neonate, she had always been good at sneak attacks. Direct combat wasn’t her forte.

Zhou Wen was good at movement techniques to begin with. He knew how terrifying an enemy like Xiao was. Zhou Wen could kill a Strength-type enemy like Blaze without any qualms.

Killing Xiao wasn’t that easy. He was very similar to Zhou Wen in every aspect. He was the type of person that wasn’t easily killed.

The power of Asura was extremely bizarre. Among the few Terror form powers Zhou Wen had, only Great Brahma could deal with him.

However, after observing for a while, Zhou Wen had other ideas.

If he used the back-facing side of Great Brahma, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to kill the Asura. However, its power was similar to Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World. Once it was used, even if he could kill the enemy, he wouldn’t obtain anything.

Since it was too late to rush over, Zhou Wen could only choose to trust An Tianzuo. He would stay behind to kill the Asura and see if he could get something good.

The power of this Asura should be demonic in nature. However, it also exudes a smell of death. Zhou Wen couldn’t tell what kind of power it was.

I’ll give it a try. I wonder if the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra can restrain the Asura’s power. Zhou Wen engraved the Ancient Sovereign Sutra on his Wheel of Destiny.

The Mythical Ancient Sovereign Sutra naturally wouldn’t be of much use against Terror-grade creatures. Therefore, Zhou Wen wanted to attempt to let the Ancient Sovereign Sutra break through to the Terror grade. Only then could it be effective against the Asura.

As the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was engraved on the Wheel of Destiny, a figure that resembled an Ancient Sovereign appeared.

An Tianzuo wasn’t slow, at least not slower than Xiao. However, An Tianzuo had a serious problem. His straight line speed was very fast, but his variability was inferior.

Once he changed directions, his speed would drop drastically.

As for Xiao, it was the opposite. No matter what kind of turns he did, it didn’t affect his speed, preventing An Tianzuo from catching up to him.

However, Xiao wasn’t able to shake An Tianzuo off. An Tianzuo had a good idea of Xiao’s general direction of escape, making it difficult for Xiao to shake him off. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

An Tianzuo was ultimately one step ahead of Xiao. He occupied the exit of the Asura Realm and stood there with his broadsword, staring coldly at Xiao.

Xiao naturally understood that he had to rush out before Zhou Wen arrived. He couldn’t be entangled with An Tianzuo here, so not only did he not slow down, but he also rushed over even faster.

With his Terror-grade speed and excellent movement techniques, Xiao’s movement had long exceeded the limits of human vision.

An Tianzuo didn’t move, as though he was an extremely precise instrument. He didn’t move at all, but once he did, it would trigger a chain reaction.

In Xiao’s eyes, although An Tianzuo was just standing there, his entire aura was like an invisible net. The net seemed to be woven by a fairy without any flaws.

“The law shows no kindness, but so what? I’ll use kindness to break it.” Xiao’s eyes shimmered with a strange glint. He held the bow with the broken string and followed a profound trajectory, instantly arriving in front of An Tianzuo.

An Tianzuo slashed down with the broken sword as though an invisible net had fallen. Countless criss-crossing sword beams sealed off Xiao’s path of retreat.

Crack! Crack!

Under the ruthless nomological net, the bow in Xiao’s hand and the armor on his body were shattered inch by inch.

Blood spewed out from Xiao’s wounds, but he remained undeterred. He charged straight at An Tianzuo like a person covered in blood, as though he wanted to perish together with him.

His eyes were peeled to An Tianzuo as though he was provoking him: “Don’t dodge if you have the guts.”
