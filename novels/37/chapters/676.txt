Chapter 677: The Tragic Death of a Mythical

Translator: CKtalon

The turtle shell was extremely hard, but it couldn’t withstand the golden bird’s sharp claws at all. In a moment, it was torn to pieces. The golden bird then ate it in midair, killing it in the blink of an eye.

How horrid. To think I actually fought it before. It’s really lucky that I didn’t die. Zhou Wen was secretly alarmed. Back then, he wasn’t as strong as he was now.

Of course, that wasn’t a real battle. The golden bird’s target wasn’t him, or Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been able to escape so easily.

When the huge turtle was killed by the golden bird, the white elephant finally crawled out of the river. The wounds on its body rapidly healed.

The strength of the huge white elephant was originally above the huge turtle’s, but it had been thrown out by the monk-clothed skeleton, rendering it completely defenseless. This produced an opening for the huge turtle to take advantage of the situation.

The golden bird tore and ate up the turtle, but it had no intention of touching the elephant. It flapped its wings and shot straight into the clouds like a bolt of golden lightning, disappearing behind the mountain peak.

After the wounds on the elephant’s body healed, it charged towards the monk-robed skeleton in the temple again. Its holy light surged crazily, but it was barely able to reach the skeleton.

As it had been severely injured, it didn’t even have the ability to attack the monk-robed skeleton.

After persisting for a long period of time, the strength of the elephant slowly dwindled from the clash with the golden light. Finally, it couldn’t withstand the impact of the golden light as its massive body appeared to be struck by rapids. It rolled down Dragon Gate Grotto and fell into the river, triggering a huge wave.

“That monk-robed skeleton is really too powerful,” Li Xuan exclaimed.

“Did you see the object that the skeleton seems to be holding in its hand?” Zhou Wen had been observing the skeleton.

He had managed to throw the white elephant away with one hand, but his other hand never moved. It had always been covered by the monk robes.

Zhou Wen saw that there seemed to be an abnormal bulge. Unfortunately, Truth Listener’s ability was affected by the golden light. He couldn’t tell what was happening around the monk-robed skeleton, or he would have known if there was anything in his hand.

Li Xuan used his Life Soul’s insect eyes to look, but he only saw something vague. He couldn’t tell what it was either.

“Do you think the white elephant is so desperate for the item in his hand?” Li Xuan guessed.

“I’m not sure yet. Let’s wait and see.” Zhou Wen saw the white elephant crawl out again as it panted by the riverside. However, it was unwilling to give up. After resting for a while, it charged towards the monk-robed skeleton for the third time.

Li Xuan said to Zhou Wen, “If the elephant falls again, it will have even weaker stamina. I wonder if we can take advantage of it?”

“I’m just afraid that the golden bird and the white elephant are in cahoots. You’ve seen the outcome of that huge turtle. If you aren’t afraid of death, give it a try.” Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t give it a try.

He wouldn’t even try it with his pets. After all, each of his Mythical pets had been obtained with great difficulty. Every one of them was obtained through blood and tears. Every death made his heart ache.

“That makes sense. That golden bird is too terrifying. It’s probably an existence that can match Primordial Sword Immortal and Tyrant Behemoth. From its abilities, it seems to be focused on speed and offensive strength. Could it be the legendary Golden-Winged Roc?” Li Xuan guessed.

“That’s very likely.” Zhou Wen also felt that the golden bird resembled the legendary Golden-Winged Roc.

As the two of them spoke, the white elephant rushed into the temple again and trudged towards the monk-robed skeleton.

This time, the white elephant was different from before. Its tusks lit up like two bright lamps. It resisted the golden light, making it rush towards the monk-robed skeleton in a seemingly easier manner than the first two times.

However, Zhou Wen realized that the elephant’s tusks were constantly burning. Its strength seemed to be exchanged from burning the tusks.

Finally, the huge white elephant charged in front of the monk-robed skeleton with the brilliance produced by burning the tusks. It lowered its head and used its burning tusks to slam into the monk-robed skeleton.

Before the tusks reached the monk, the force produced by thrust blew at the monk robes.

Zhou Wen had been paying constant attention to the monk-robed skeleton. When the monk robe fluttered, he saw that the other skeleton hand was placed above his thigh bone.

In that hand was a golden crystal that was about the size of a chicken egg. It looked slightly oval.

The moment the crystal appeared, it immediately emitted a golden glow that illuminated the entire mountain temple. Nothing could be seen.

Even with Zhou Wen and Li Xuan’s eyesight, they couldn’t see anything.

After a while, the golden light vanished. When everyone saw the scene inside the temple again, they widened their eyes in horror.

The white elephant was still in front of the monk-robed skeleton. It hadn’t been thrown down this time, but its flesh and organs had completely vanished. All that was left was a skeleton standing in front of the monk-robed skeleton, maintaining the posture of lowering its head to strike. It was the last scene Zhou Wen and company had seen.

A gust of wind blew and the huge skeleton suddenly scattered like flour. It landed on the ground and covered the entire mountain temple.

Everyone felt a chill run down their spines as they broke out in cold sweat.

In the middle of the afternoon, everyone felt their bodies turn cold.

“What was that bead just now?” Li Xuan stared at the monk-robed skeleton in the temple. The monk robe fell again, covering the bead. They couldn’t see anything anymore.

“I don’t know, but there’s a Companion Egg on the ground,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed towards the temple.

In the pile of bone powder, there was a white Companion Egg. It was about half as tall as a person. It was clearly left behind by the white elephant after its death.

“The white elephant’s Companion Egg is good stuff, but who would dare enter to take it?” Although Li Xuan’s self-healing ability was very strong, he wasn’t so foolhardy to believe that he could withstand the terrifying golden light.

Zhou Wen had some ideas. Although the elephant wasn’t a top-notch Mythical creature, it was still a Mythical creature.

I wonder if I can send an Epic Companion Beast in and get it out? Just as Zhou Wen had this thought, someone had already done so.

Among the Epic experts sent by the local major families in Luoyang, an Epic expert summoned an Epic immortal crane. It flew into the temple, hoping to get the Companion Egg out.

However, just as the immortal crane flew into the mountain temple, its body came into contact with the golden light emitted by the monk-robed skeleton. It immediately disintegrated and died.

Everyone was alarmed. Only then did they realize that not anyone could enter the mountain temple. The white elephant could travel against the golden light in the mountain temple, but that didn’t mean they could do the same.

“Thankfully, I didn’t enter.” Li Xuan broke out into a cold sweat. He had really wanted to rush into the temple to retrieve the white elephant’s Companion Egg.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
