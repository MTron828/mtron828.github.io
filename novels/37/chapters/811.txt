Chapter 812: The Final Victor

“Such a gradation isn’t right, isn’t it? Many Legendary and Epic creatures can also instill terror in people, can’t they?” Zhou Wen said.

“Sorry, there’s a problem with how I’m conveying it. This level is based on dimensional civilizations as reference. Legendaries and Epic on Earth aren’t qualified to enter the ranks of dimensional civilizations,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.

“Alright, continue.” Zhou Wen shrugged helplessly.

“Floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, etc. These are things that humans are unable to control, nor can they resist them. Once they happen, they can only wait for death. They are known as calamities, and they are also known as the Calamity grade. This is the second level of Mythical creatures. Mythical creatures that can reach this level are considered accomplished in dimensional civilizations,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.

Calamity grade? Zhou Wen silently repeated the name.

“Although natural disasters are terrifying, they will ultimately come to an end. Yet, some forces are enough to destroy everything. In ancient times, some people were worried that the sky would collapse, while others were worried that the land they lived in would be destroyed. Such a force that can destroy the world is known as the Apocalypse grade amongst dimensional civilizations.”

The silver-haired Companion Beast smiled and said, “Of course, the so-called apocalypse is only relative to Earth. In fact, in dimensional civilizations, there aren’t any existences that can truly destroy worlds. Furthermore, there aren’t any so-called gods in dimensional civilizations. There are only indescribable things. The so-called Apocalyptic power doesn’t cause much destruction in dimensional civilizations. This has something to do with the composition of the world. Compared to dimensional civilizations, Earth is just too weak.”

“What’s after the Apocalypse grade?” Zhou Wen asked.

“There hasn’t been such a life form so far, so it’s unknown,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Then, what’s your grade?” Zhou Wen stared at the silver-haired Companion Beast and asked.

“I’m only at the Terror grade. It’s impossible for an existence above the Terror grade to appear in an ancient forbidden land like Earth.”

“Why?”

“That’s because this is an ancient forbidden land. There’s no reason to speak of. That’s the rule of an ancient forbidden land. Even if those terrifying Apocalypse-grade creatures enter an ancient forbidden land, they will be reduced to the Terror grade.”

“What’s an ancient forbidden land?” Zhou Wen wanted to know as much as possible. If he missed this opportunity, who could tell him this?

“I don’t know. This is the name dimensional civilizations have given Earth since ancient times. Only a place like Earth has such weak lifeforms. Therefore, many dimensional civilizations want to explore Earth and find out the secrets here. In the past, there were several Mythical wars on Earth because of this. There were dimensional civilizations backing them.”

The silver-haired Companion Beast paused for a moment before continuing, “This is because there have been too many divine wars on Earth. The dimensional creatures that had their strength reduced entered, only to end up dying here. The losses were heavy. Now, the various dimensional civilizations have already reached an agreement. They won’t send a large number of manpower into Earth, nor will they trigger divine wars on Earth. Every species will only send a Guardian to Earth and sign a contract with the humans on Earth. They will fight each other. The final victor and the dimensional civilization that he represents will have the rights to Earth for a hundred years. A hundred years later, new Guardians will enter Earth and begin the battle of Guardians again, deciding the ownership of Earth for the next hundred years.”

“Why must Guardians decide who Earth belongs to? We humans are the masters of Earth,” Zhou Wen said.

The silver-haired Companion Beast curled its lips and said, “This is typical human thinking. In fact, humans are only one of the millions of lifeforms on Earth. Humans used their powerful strength to conquer other lives and became the rulers of Earth. Now, there are even stronger lifeforms entering Earth and becoming the new rulers. Isn’t this something that’s only right? If you want to blame someone, you can only blame yourself for being too weak. You can’t even advance to the Terror stage. That is a sin by itself.”

Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss with the silver-haired Companion Beast’s words, but he couldn’t think of any reason to refute him.

“Why do Guardians have to contract with humans? Can’t they just fight each other?” Zhou Wen changed the topic.

“This is because Guardians have great growth potential, but the rules of Earth don’t allow existences above the Terror grade to appear on Earth. However, there’s one exception. If you humans are used as carriers, they can erupt with powers above the Terror grade level for a short period of time without being restricted by the rules of the ancient forbidden land. Therefore, Guardians can only continue growing by contracting with you humans and come one step closer to victory,” explained the silver-haired Companion Beast.

“I see.” Zhou Wen finally understood why the powerful Guardians chose to contract with humans. It was all for victory.

With this in mind, it wasn’t unreasonable for a Guardian to choose to betray weaker contractors.

After all, with a weak contractor, there was almost no chance of them winning. They could only constantly seek out stronger contractors.

Of course, as a human, Zhou Wen didn’t like the Guardians, much less them treating Earth as a gambling table, battlefield, and dimensional civilization.

“What if all the Guardians fail in the end?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he asked the silver-haired Companion Beast.

“Haha, well asked. Back then, Ouyang Ting asked the same question. However, there’s still no answer because no one other than the Guardian has obtained the final victory,” said the silver-haired Companion Beast.

Zhou Wen saw that someone was coming down on the elevator, so he quickly asked, “Someone’s here. Speak quickly. What do you want me to do?”

“Ouyang Ting wants to know the answer to your question, so he has been searching for a way to win. However, his body can’t take it anymore. He’s too old, so it’s impossible for him to participate in such a battle again. Therefore, he wants to find someone who can win the answer for him. From the looks of it, he chose you,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.

“Has he found a way to win?” Zhou Wen asked.

“The method is in this metal box. Open it and you will get the answer,” said the silver-haired Companion Beast as he pointed at the metal slab connected to the chain.

Zhou Wen looked at the metal slab, but he wasn’t sure if the silver-haired Companion Beast’s words were trustworthy.

The elevator door opened and someone entered B4. He headed straight for the silver-haired Companion Beast’s room. It was Qin Xiyuan, who had rushed back.

Upon realizing that the silver-haired Companion Beast was still around and that the metal slab was fine, Qin Xiyuan heaved a sigh of relief. However, he still ordered the people around him to search all of B4.
