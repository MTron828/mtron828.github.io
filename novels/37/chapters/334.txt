Chapter 335 Meeting

“I don’t care if Teacher is an overseas spy. I absolutely cannot let them take him away. Death is inevitable in a place like the Special Investigation Bureau. Ms. Wang, think of a way to snatch him back before they leave Luoyang and destroy the evidence. Then, we can just let Teacher escape into dimensional zones,” Zhong Ziya said.

Wang Fei shook her head and said, “Don’t spout nonsense. You can’t do that kind of thing. There’s no way for him to be a barbarian forever in the dimensional zone, right? Besides, the Director-General of the Special Inspector Bureau brought a Mythical Companion Beast with him. Who could snatch him under his nose?”

Upon hearing this, Zhong Ziya felt deflated. He frowned and said, “Is there no other solution?”

Wang Fei remained silent. If she had had a choice, the Wang family and Luoyang military wouldn’t have allowed the bureau to take him away from the school.

Jiang Yan suddenly said, “Perhaps, Tutor has been expecting this. Since he didn’t escape, it means that he doesn’t plan on escaping.”

“What do you mean?” Zhong Ziya asked with a glare. Jiang Yan pondered for a moment before continuing, “Think about it. Wouldn’t there always be someone in the laboratory amongst the four of us? Yet for some reason, none of us were in the laboratory out of coincidence. No one was there.”

“Isn’t that a coincidence? If Teacher had really predicted this, why didn’t he destroy the evidence beforehand? Without the evidence, he wouldn’t have been caught red-handed, and the bureau shouldn’t be able to take him away, right?” Zhong Ziya said.

Jiang Yan shook his head slightly. “Let’s not talk about Zhou Wen. Hui Haifeng often goes out too. The two of them can’t be counted. But the two of us spend our days in the laboratory, and we seldom head out at the same time. Even if something happens, someone will usually be left behind in the laboratory. I left because Teacher asked me to go to the Myriad Buddha Cave to hunt Golden Warriors. What’s the reason for you not being in the laboratory?”

“Teacher got me to buy something outside campus for him.” Zhong Ziya also felt that something was amiss. It seemed as though Wang Mingyuan had deliberately sent them away.

Hui Haifeng added, “I was planning to go to the lab today, but yesterday, Tutor told me of a new fist technique that led me to practice late into the night, so I didn’t go in.”

The four of them increasingly felt that Wang Mingyuan had really expected that something would happen today before he sent them away.

“Let’s leave the talking until we are back in the military camp. Before the bureau leaves, don’t go back to the dorms. Besides, there are some questions that you need answering.” Qin Wufu got the soldiers to take Zhou Wen and company back.

Firstly, it was to protect them. Secondly, they also needed to be investigated thoroughly. If Wang Mingyuan was really an overseas spy, they needed to eliminate the quartet’s suspicion; otherwise, any further problems would pose a threat to Luoyang.

Zhou Wen had no idea what was up with the overseas spy. When he was questioned privately, he only recounted the details of his interaction with Wang Mingyuan. After that, the four of them were detained in the military camp and were not released. However, the treatment they received wasn’t bad; each of them had a single room.

“Ms. Wang, what’s up with being an overseas spy?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement when Wang Fei came to see him. Wang Fei sighed and said, “The overseas factions were established during the early stages of the League. They were a few devils who escaped overseas to create a human faction. Before the appearance of the six heroes, they did whatever they wanted and committed countless crimes. Every one of them was an evil fiend. Their hands were stained with the blood of the innocent. The most famous Jing Daoxian was one of them, but for some reason, Jing Daoxian remained in the League all year round and seldom returned overseas.”

“You mean that Teacher is one of those devils?” Zhou Wen really couldn’t believe that the gentle Wang Mingyuan was a vile devil.

“Although I don’t believe it either, the evidence is just concrete. Furthermore, he was caught red-handed. Even Uncle Mingyuan didn’t provide an explanation and tacitly admitted it.” Despite having her doubts, Wang Fei had no choice but to believe the truth.

Although that was what was said, Zhou Wen still couldn’t believe that Wang Mingyuan would be such a heinous devil.

The military camp had its rules. Zhou Wen’s phone and whatever he had on him had been temporarily confiscated by the military. Without his phone to game, Zhou Wen could only wait in a single room. This didn’t last long. The next day, Qin Wufu ordered his subordinates to release the four. He also told Zhou Wen that the bureau had already escorted Wang Mingyuan back to Holy City yesterday.

Zhou Wen got back his phone and items-all of them untouched. Only then was he slightly relieved.

The four returned to the lab at Old Dragon Cave and found it in a mess. Not only was all the furniture and equipment damaged, but there were also holes dug into the walls.

The quartet exchanged looks. None of them spoke for a moment. They were unable to accept the fact that Wang Mingyuan was an overseas spy.

“Jiang Yan, you have the best solutions. Tell me, is there any way to save Teacher?” Zhong Ziya asked while gritting his teeth.

Jiang Yan shook his head slightly. “Unless we can advance to the Mythical stage, no one can save Tutor in this situation.”

“Then, how will they deal with him?” Zhong Ziya asked again.

Jiang Yan thought for a moment and said, “If Tutor really is an overseas spy, and even the Director-General of the bureau was activated, then his status can’t be low. Or perhaps he has some secret that even the Senate wants. That’s why he was forcefully arrested. In that case, it’s possible that they won’t kill Tutor for now, or if he is willing to give them what they want, he might still have a chance of surviving. Other than that, we can’t do anything.”

Although Zhou Wen knew that it was useless, he still made a phone call to An Sheng and asked his opinion of Wang Mingyuan.

Although he wanted to know his thoughts, he actually wanted to know if An Sheng had any way to save Wang Mingyuan.

If it was for himself, Zhou Wen definitely wouldn’t have asked An Sheng. However, Wang Mingyuan’s position in his heart was different.

Unfortunately, An Sheng told Zhou Wen with sure certainty that since Wang Mingyuan was caught red-handed, there was no room for negotiation unless Wang Mingyuan could produce something that was satisfactory to the League. Only then did he have a chance of survival.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that the matter would end there, but to his surprise, he, Hui Haifeng, and company received a notification from the League that Wang Mingyuan wanted to see them a few days later. However, Wang Mingyuan didn’t insist that they come. He said that they could come if they wanted. They could likewise stay.

After that, the four of them even had a video call with Wang Mingyuan. Wang Mingyuan only said that he wanted to meet them as he had some things he wanted to say to them in person without any elaboration.

Zhou Wen could sense that Wang Mingyuan appeared to have something he needed to tell them.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
