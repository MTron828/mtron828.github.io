Chapter 1125: The New Four War Gods

Translator: CKtalon

That person was Fang Mingsu, Ji Moqing’s brother-in-law.

Zhou Wen didn’t know Fang Mingsu, but Shiraishi Satomi long knew of his fame. If she had met him in the past, under such circumstances, she would definitely have turned tail without giving him a chance to see her.

​

However, with Zhou Wen beside her, she didn’t think she needed to run.

Although Fang Mingsu was very strong and was known as one of the four new war gods of the Federation, with his Guardian having reached the Terror grade, Shiraishi Satomi didn’t believe that he was stronger than Zhou Wen.

Ji Moqing lowered her head and didn’t say a word. She had also seen Zhou Wen’s strength. Such a terrifying Ghost Train had been smacked to death by his Life Soul. Such strength was probably not much weaker than Fang Mingsu’s.

Now that she was in Zhou Wen’s hands, she was afraid that Fang Mingsu would be threatened by Zhou Wen and company because of her.

“It’s Fang Mingsu,” Shiraishi Satomi whispered when she saw that Zhou Wen didn’t seem to recognize him.

So he’s Fang Mingsu? Zhou Wen sized up Fang Mingsu and felt somewhat intrigued.

He was curious about Fang Mingsu not because of how strong he was or how famous he was, but because Fang Mingsu and An Tianzuo were the four new War Gods of the Federation.

Zhou Wen was mainly curious how strong a person who was An Tianzuo’s peer was.

Fang Mingsu clearly knew that Ji Moqing was here and was here for her.

When the ships were a few hundred meters away from Zhou Wen and company, they finally stopped. Fang Mingsu stood at the bow and said to Ji Moqing with a smile, “Little Qing, don’t worry. Since I’m here, I won’t let you suffer any more grievances.”

“Brother-in-law.” Ji Moqing’s eyes immediately turned red.

After all, she was only seventeen. Although she was rather scheming, it would be a lie to say that she wasn’t afraid after being abducted overseas.

Now that Fang Mingsu was here, she finally had someone she could rely on. She no longer needed to rely on herself. She was immediately awash in emotions.

“Don’t cry.” Fang Mingsu stepped down from the boat and walked step by step over the seawater. The seawater didn’t even wet his shoes.

“I’ve long heard of the famous name of the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. I’ve always yearned for the name of Sword Sage, but I never expected him to do such a thing. It’s really disappointing. I guess Sword Sage Sei Gasakai’s title is just an empty title. Otherwise, why would he do such a despicable thing?” Fang Mingsu said as he walked. Soon, he was less than ten meters away from Zhou Wen and company.

Upon hearing Fang Mingsu insult Sei Gasakai, Shiraishi Satomi was immediately enraged. Although she knew that she was no match for him, she still drew her blade to defend her master’s honor.

Zhou Wen reached out to press down on Shiraishi Satomi’s hand that was holding the blade. He looked at Fang Mingsu and said, “There’s more to this matter than meets the eye. It wasn’t done by Sword Sage. Thankfully, this lady wasn’t injured. Now that she’s returned to you perfectly fine, how about we drop this matter?”

Fang Mingsu did not answer. He only looked at Ji Moqing and asked, “Little Qing, did they bully you?”

“No.” Ji Moqing hurriedly shook her head.

If it were any other time, with Fang Mingsu as her backer, she would definitely add fuel to the fire and complain. However, after seeing how terrifying Zhou Wen was, she also hoped that this matter would end here and not cause any further problems.

“I’ll leave her to you. We’ll take our leave now.” Zhou Wen gestured for Shiraishi Satomi to throw Ji Moqing at Fang Mingsu before turning the boat’s bow and leaving.

Fang Mingsu caught Ji Moqing and again asked her if she had suffered.

On the other side, the other ships blocked Zhou Wen’s path.

“What’s the meaning of this?” Zhou Wen asked Fang Mingsu.

Fang Mingsu didn’t even look at Zhou Wen as he continued speaking to Ji Moqing.

Many humans appeared on the ship. One of them was a brawny, bald man in a military uniform with a huge ax over his shoulder. He said loudly, “Do you think our marshal’s sister is someone you can capture and release as you wish? Would you be willing to have me abduct your wife for a month before returning her to you?”

“Then what must be done to satisfy you?” Zhou Wen felt that although the man’s words were crude, they weren’t wrong.

This matter was indeed Honn Shinsakura’s fault. It was not their fault for being overbearing.

“You can’t make the decision on this matter. Let Sei Gasakai talk to us,” the bald man said.

“Can you make calls on matters pertaining to the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū?” Zhou Wen asked Shiraishi Satomi.

Shiraishi Satomi first shook her head before nodding at Zhou Wen. “I can’t make the decision, but you can, according to Master before he left. You can even have our lives”

Zhou Wen nodded and looked at the bald man. “I can make some decisions regarding the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū. I’ll get Honn Shinsakura to apologize and let you vent your anger. He didn’t do anything out of line. How about letting him live?”

The bald man was slightly taken aback as though he never expected Zhou Wen to be so easy-going. He couldn’t help but look at Fang Mingsu.

Only then did Fang Mingsu look up and say to Zhou Wen, “You can’t make the decision on this matter. Take me to Sei Gasakai. He has to personally give me an explanation.”

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown slightly as he looked at Fang Mingsu and said, “This matter has nothing to do with the Sword Sage. Why do you have to see him? Do you want to seek justice for her or do you want to go to the Niten Flying Immortal Palace?”

“Both. Lead the way,” Fang Mingsu said indifferently.

Zhou Wen already understood that Fang Mingsu’s true goal wasn’t to save Ji Moqing, or rather, it wasn’t entirely to save her. Perhaps Ji Moqing’s abduction had been a trap all along.

Fang Mingsu’s true target was the Niten Flying Immortal Palace and Sei Gasakai. There was no doubt about this, but Zhou Wen didn’t understand why.

“Sorry, if you want to go to the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, it’s best you go yourself. I don’t have time to accompany you.” Zhou Wen gestured for Shiraishi Satomi to continue sailing.

Fang Mingsu frowned slightly. In his intelligence, there didn’t seem to be such a person on Fuji Island. The three most important people in the Niten Flying Immortal Palace were Sei Gasakai, Honn Shinsakura, and Shiraishi Satomi.

As for Shiraishi Satomi, she seemed to follow this young man’s lead, but this young man wasn’t Honn Shinsakura. This left Fang Mingsu somewhat puzzled.

However, there was no turning back now. Even if the young man in front of him was as powerful as Honn Shinsakura, it wouldn’t affect the overall situation much.

“Brother-in-law...” Ji Moqing seemed to come to a realization. She wanted to tell Fang Mingsu what had happened on Fuji Island, but she was cut off by Fang Mingsu. He even gave her a reassuring gesture.

“Regardless of whether you have the time or not, you have to make this trip.” With Fang Mingsu’s voice, the soldiers on the ship had already summoned their Companion Beasts and got them to target Zhou Wen and Shiraishi Satomi.

Scales appeared on the bald man’s body as he slashed at Zhou Wen like a monster.
