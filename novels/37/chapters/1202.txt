Chapter 1203: Different Asuras

Zhou Wen teleported to Blaze’s side planning on capturing him alive. After investigating for so long, he finally had clues, so he naturally had to get to the bottom of it.

“Come to hell with me.” However, before Zhou Wen could touch Blaze, Blaze’s body suddenly bloated up. Light and fire spewed out from his body as he chose to self-destruct without any hesitation. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Damn it! Zhou Wen could teleport away, but there were other people chained in the altar. If Blaze self-destructed here, the others would definitely die.

Instantly, Zhou Wen made a decision. Almost at the same time Blaze’s body exploded, he reached out and pressed down on him, transferring his body away.

Boom!

In the distant Asura horde, a terrifying explosion happened. The explosive force exploded like a hydrogen bomb, instantly wiping out countless Asuras.

When Xiao saw this scene, his figure flashed and drew a strange trajectory as he charged towards the exit of the Asura Realm.

An Tianzuo chased after Xiao and held him back. Under An Tianzuo’s attacks, Xiao couldn’t escape for the time being.

Ouyang Lan woke up after consuming the pill essence. Zhou Wen placed her by An Sheng’s side and waved his sword to rescue the other prisoners. Only then did he rush over, planning on helping An Tianzuo take down Xiao.

They could only make headway on the former principal’s disappearance through these people. He wanted to know if the former principal was still alive.

Zhou Wen held Sword Pill and joined the battle. His sword art wasn’t inferior to An Tianzuo’s, but their styles were different. Although they had never fought together, it didn’t affect their performance at all. They had good teamwork.

Facing the siege of the two, Xiao was immediately at a disadvantage. He was in imminent danger.

Xiao was a ruthless person. He endured An Tianzuo’s full-powered strike and forcefully broke out of the encirclement. However, to his surprise, he didn’t rush in the direction of the Asura Realm’s exit. Instead, he charged towards An Sheng, Ouyang Lan, and company.

Zhou Wen and An Tianzuo rushed over to stop him when Xiao suddenly did an about-turn and landed on the altar beside him.

The two of them immediately knew that something was amiss. Xiao’s target was the altar. He had rushed towards An Sheng and company only to divert their attention.

This person still has such a clear train of thought under such circumstances and has such executional ability. He’s really good. Zhou Wen teleported over and continued slashing at Xiao.

Xiao suffered An Tianzuo’s strike, but he recovered extremely quickly. Zhou Wen also recognized that it was the Xia family’s Invincible Connate Divine Art. He knew that ordinary injuries were useless against him. Zhou Wen even hid Great Brahma’s power in this strike.

Xiao didn’t dodge. Instead, he raised his chest and allowed it to face Sword Pill. The extremely sharp Sword Pill penetrated his body, causing blood to gush out and drip onto the altar.

Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as he guessed the reason for Xiao’s actions. However, he had no other choice. He brandished Sword Pill, hoping to slice Xiao’s body into two.

Xiao’s body strangely retreated as Zhou Wen slashed out a foot-long wound in his chest, but he failed to slice him into two.

A large amount of Xiao’s blood landed on the altar. After the altar came into contact with the blood, it began spinning like a wheel.

As the altar spun, the stone pillars began to move.

Zhou Wen knew that something bad would definitely happen, so all he wanted was to quickly take down Xiao. The Sword Pill in his hand struck out at ever-increasing speeds.

However, Xiao wasn’t bad at movement techniques either. Its Trajectory movement technique wasn’t inferior to Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal. Its speed was in no way inferior, and he was even faster than Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was still at the Mythical stage after all. His stats hadn’t reached the Terror grade, so he was definitely at a disadvantage.

As the altar spun, something strange happened. The Asuras, who weren’t afraid of death, suddenly retreated like a tide and quickly left the altar.

When all the stone pillars formed a circle, a hole opened in the middle of the altar. Endless demonic aura spewed out from below as though a volcano had erupted.

An Asura rushed out with a demonic aura effusing from him. He looked similar to the ordinary Asuras.

He wore a mask and was half-naked. He wore a feathered dress with a strange bird tattoo on his back. He held an Asura Saber in his hand.

The difference was that this Asura’s hair, mask, feather skirt, strange bird tattoo, and Asura Saber were all purple, while ordinary Asuras were black.

A Terror-grade Asura? Just as Zhou Wen was in thought, the Asura slashed at him.

It was unknown what Xiao had done, but despite both of them being on the altar, the Asura ignored him and slashed at Zhou Wen.

This strike was filled with a demonic aura. Be it its Strength stat or ability, it was completely different from Deva Asura.

Zhou Wen brandished his sword to block as the Sword Pill collided with the Asura Saber. A strange thing happened. The Asura Saber was like a phantom as the Sword Pill passed through it while the Asura Saber continued slashing at Zhou Wen.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen teleported away from the altar, having no plans on testing the saber with his body.

When Zhou Wen appeared below the altar, the Asura actually chased after him and slashed at his neck like a ghost.

“Let’s meet again if fate allows it,” Xiao said with a chuckle before flying up. He drew a strange trajectory in the air and headed for the Asura Realm’s exit.

An Tianzuo immediately chased after him, hoping to stop him.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare chase after him. He might be able to shake off the Asura with teleportation, but if he and An Tianzuo left, An Sheng and company would be in danger if the Asura changed targets.

Zhou Wen could only hope that An Tianzuo could capture Xiao while he fought Asura.

This Asura was very strange. Zhou Wen used teleportation to dodge his attacks and the Sword Pill had stabbed him several times, but it was as though he had stabbed an illusion. The Asura didn’t suffer any damage.

Could this be an illusion? Zhou Wen was puzzled. When the Asura slashed over again, he deliberately summoned a Poison Bat to block the Asura Saber.

The Poison Bat was cleaved into two by the Asura Saber. It couldn’t be more dead.

Zhou Wen secretly rejoiced that he hadn’t experimented using his body of flesh and blood. At the same time, he felt a headache. His attacks were useless against the Asura, so it was equivalent to his adversary being invincible.

From the looks of it, it’s a power similar to a Spirit Body. I can only try Great Brahma. Zhou Wen summoned Great Brahma.

The four-faced, eight-armed Great Brahma with a spinning black hole on his back appeared in front of Asura. The Asura didn’t know what fear was as it slashed over.

Great Brahma automatically counterattacked and struck Asura’s saber. With a clang, Asura’s saber was blocked.

Seeing that Great Brahma could block Asura, Zhou Wen heaved a sigh of relief.

However, Great Brahma wouldn’t take the initiative to attack. As the Asura slashed down with his saber, Great Brahma blocked with his palm successfully, albeit unable to kill him.
