Chapter 1027: Battle of Terror Creatures

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen knew what the masked man meant when he said the time was up. He had already been in the garden for an hour. Under normal circumstances, he would have been killed by the garden’s one-hour time limit.

Although Zhou Wen didn’t know how he would die in reality, the masked man only wanted his body. A complete corpse was most suitable.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen had the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, so the time limit here couldn’t kill him.

The masked man looked cool by looking up at the sky at a 45-degree angle, but after a while, he couldn’t maintain it.

“You actually have the ability to restrain taboo powers. How surprising. This is a very rare attribute. I’m increasingly satisfied with your body,” the masked man said.

“Thank you for your affirmation of my body, but I’m sorry. I also find this body pretty good. I have no intention of giving it away.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he suddenly summoned the Invisibility Cloak and put it on. At the same time, he released the ice maiden in the Chaos Bead.

Demonic Neonate was also summoned by Zhou Wen. He hugged her and quickly retreated.

As he had to maintain the Heaven-Opening Scripture state to prevent himself from being killed by the taboo powers here, Zhou Wen couldn’t teleport.

The ice maiden had been trapped in the Chaos Bead for days. She was already gnashing her teeth in hatred. Now that she was suddenly released, she immediately felt a strange force descend on her, oppressing her body and strength.

Sweeping her gaze, the ice maiden immediately understood something. She summoned the ice castle and used its power to provide herself protection, preventing her Terror-grade powers from being directly weakened by Earth.

The ice castle fell and immediately smashed the garden.

When the masked man saw Zhou Wen suddenly vanish only to have the ice maiden and the ice castle instantly appear and flatten the garden, he imagined that the ice maiden was Zhou Wen’s helper.

The masked man’s eyes turned cold. The eye sockets of the mask seemed to have a strange magical power that attracted the ice maiden’s soul.

The ice maiden’s gaze involuntarily looked into the masked man’s eyes. However, she knew that this wasn’t her wish.

The ice maiden was alarmed as well. She imagined that the masked man had been sent by Zhou Wen to kill her, so she immediately entered her Terror form. Her entire body turned into an ice crystal as a terrifying cold wave emitted from her. Instantly, the entire garden turned into a world of ice and snow, freezing the masked man in ice.

“How dare you show off your ice-elemental Terror powers in front of me?” The masked man’s cold voice sounded from the ice. Cracks appeared on the ice as it quickly shattered.

In the next moment, the masked man’s figure vanished.

The ice maiden immediately erected an ice barrier to protect her body. As for the terrifying invisible blades, they crisscrossed and slashed at the ice barrier, quickly shattering it.

The masked man’s mask kept appearing in her mind, making her have the desire to look at it.

The ice maiden was alarmed. The masked man’s strength was terrifying, exceeding her expectations. She never expected Zhou Wen to find such a terrifying figure to deal with her.

Without any hesitation, the ice maiden took out the Heaven Shrouding Bell from the ice castle and shook it in her hand.

The hidden masked man revealed himself due to the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s sound. He staggered a few steps and revealed a solemn expression.

A strange gray light suffused the mask, making his face look even more ferocious.

Zhou Wen couldn’t rush out of the garden and could only hide far away. However, the Invisibility Cloak only had three minutes. After three minutes, the masked man and the ice maiden would be able to find him.

“Little Neonate, find an opportunity to kill that fellow with the mask now.” Zhou Wen used his mind to communicate with Demonic Neonate.

Demonic Neonate remained motionless in his arms. She also felt that the masked man wasn’t easy to deal with, so she had to wait for an opportunity.

During the ice maiden and the masked man’s fight, the Heaven Shrouding Bell and the mask emitted strange powers. Zhou Wen only saw flashes of light, preventing him from seeing their battle clearly.

This situation was similar to the situation after Zhou Wen entered the dimension. He could only use Truth Listener and could vaguely hear the battle situation.

The Heaven Shrouding Bell was very powerful, but the ice maiden’s strength seemed to be lacking. After shaking the Heaven Shrouding Bell twice and failing to kill the masked man, her strength began to weaken.

As for the masked man’s strength, it showed no signs of weakening.

Is the masked man that strong? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

He originally imagined that the ice maiden was a dimensional creature and should be sufficiently powerful. He never expected her to fail to suppress the masked man with the Heaven Shrouding Bell.

“Although the Heaven Shrouding Bell is very strong, you are too weak. You are unable to truly use its might. It’s best you give it to me and I’ll spare your life.” The masked man actually had the intention of snatching the Heaven Shrouding Bell.

The gray light on the mask intensified as though there was an endless abyss in its eye sockets.

The ice maiden’s mind was gradually attracted by it. She could barely restrain her desire to look at the mask.

The ice maiden clearly saw that the masked man had the bloodline of a human and a Guardian as she said coldly, “How dare a hybrid scum have designs on the Heaven Shrouding Bell?”

“As an ice demon, you might not have any noble bloodline. At the very least, my strength is above yours. If I want you to live, you will live. If I want you to die, you will die.” The masked man swam through the world of ice like a phantom. When the ice maiden’s frost power struck him, it only hit an illusion.

The ice maiden’s eyes became less and less resolute.

“If you hand over the Heaven Shrouding Bell now, you still have a chance of survival.” The masked man’s figure appeared on the ice surface as though he had appeared in a mirror.

The ice maiden’s gaze began to uncontrollably look at the masked man’s figure on the ice surface. Her frost powers also began to weaken.

Ice Maiden is not going to make it... Zhou Wen couldn’t help but worry when he saw that Demonic Neonate hadn’t taken action. This was because his three minutes of invisibility was almost up.

At that moment, an ice beam erupted from the ice maiden’s body. An ice crystal crown formed above her head. Her figure became increasingly transparent, almost invisible.

At the same time, the ice maiden shook the Heaven Shrouding Bell in her hand.

“Ice Demon Monarch’s bloodline?” The masked man wore a look of surprise. Just as he finished speaking, everything in the garden was shattered by the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s power.

The masked man, who was the first to bear the brunt of the impact, slid backward in the garden before slamming into the garden’s wall. The wall collapsed and he was buried inside.

After this strike, the ice maiden’s body immediately entered a weakened state. She was unable to maintain her Terror form and she returned to her normal appearance.

However, there was no joy on the ice maiden’s face. The masked man slowly stood up amidst the rubble of the collapsed wall.
