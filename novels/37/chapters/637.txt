Chapter 638 Horror

“Are you alright?” Liu Yun looked at Zhou Wen nervously. He was really worried that Zhou Wen would die.If Zhou Wen were to die just like that, he would likely suffer the same fate. He naturally didn’t wish for Zhou Wen to die.“I’m fine.” Zhou Wen sheathed his Bamboo Blade and shook his head.

At the instant he struck out to kill the black-armored warrior, Zhou Wen switched to Gods Retreat before killing it.

The jade infant absorbed a large amount of taboo power and nearly exploded. However, it was about the same as before. There were no abnormal fluctuations. From the looks of it, killing the black-armored warrior wasn’t considered murder.

Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s guess. Perhaps the taboo power fluctuations from murder wasn’t obvious.

Zhou Wen looked down at the black-armored warrior’s corpse. His corpse was rapidly disintegrating as a crystal dropped. It was an Essence Energy Skill Crystal.

Zhou Wen extended his palm and sucked it over. The crystal reached Zhou Wen’s hand and he used his phone to snap a picture. It was indeed an Epic Essence Energy Skill Crystal.

Blade Executioner Crystal: Epic

“Do you still want to continue walking? If we encounter a Mythical creature, we will probably be doomed,” said Liu Yun with a heavy expression.

Zhou Wen knew that it was a viable possibility. He wouldn’t believe that there were no Mythical creatures in such a strange dimensional zone.

He looked at his phone. The game was still downloading, and there wasn’t any indication of the progress. He didn’t know when it would finish downloading.

“Let’s continue,” Zhou Wen said as he bit his lip. A day was very short. If they couldn’t untie the dead knot caused by the three ironclad rules, they would probably die.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen still had Truth Listener and Demonic Neonate to use. Even if he encountered Mythical creatures, he wasn’t powerless against them.

However, Zhou Wen was still somewhat worried. He didn’t know if Companion Beasts would be affected by the ironclad rules of Netherworld City. If they were affected as well, they would die if they weren’t summoned with their feet touching the ground. That would be tragic.

But now that things had come to this, he had to fight for his survival. All he could do was walk forward.

“Junior Brother, go ahead. I’ll follow behind you. Since you wish to scout the way, I can help you from behind if you encounter danger,” said Liu Yun.

There was nothing wrong with what Liu Yun said. Furthermore, Zhou Wen hadn’t pinned his hopes on him at all, so he continued walking forward. However, this time, Zhou Wen walked even slower and was even more careful.

Liu Yun waited for Zhou Wen to take a few steps before stepping on the same stone slabs he took to prevent any accidents from happening.

The only thing that worried Liu Yun was if the black-armored warrior that Zhou Wen had killed would appear when he stepped onto the same stone slab.

Although he was worried, Liu Yun was still prepared to take the same path. He wanted to see if the black-armored warrior would appear again. That would give him a better idea for the remaining journey.

However, before Liu Yun reached the black-armored warrior’s stone slab, something went wrong.

He stepped on a stone slab that Zhou Wen had stepped on before. The stone slab lit up as a few words appeared.

Cause of death: Horror

“F*ck, what the hell is this? You clearly stepped on it just now. Wasn’t it fine?” Liu Yun tightened his nerves and looked around.

He didn’t know what horror was. The slab that Zhou Wen had stepped on previously clearly wrote ‘Death by blades.’

Zhou Wen turned his head and saw the words beneath Liu Yun’s feet. He said with a heavy expression, “From the looks of it, the problematic stone slabs aren’t in fixed spots. They randomly appear or someone is controlling them. Even if there’s a pattern, we don’t know what it is.”

“Junior Brother, I think it’s best if we don’t meet again in the future. Before meeting you, I lived a happy life. However, ever since I met you, I haven’t had a good day. I might even lose my life here. Promise me, if we can survive this time, we won’t meet again, alright?” Liu Yun said with a bitter face.

“When you take me to the Endless Sea of Stars, we won’t meet again,” Zhou Wen said.

“You still want to go to the Endless Sea of Stars when we are already in this situation... Ah...” As Liu Yun spoke, he suddenly felt a chill run down his neck.

A dagger seemed to have appeared out of thin air and stuck to his neck. The blade had already touched his skin.

Liu Yun turned pale with fright, but his reaction was really fast. Almost at the same time the blade appeared, he quickly leaned back, but his feet seemed to be nailed to the ground. He remained motionless.

The dagger slashed across Liu Yun’s face, slicing off a portion of his hair. Liu Yun broke out into a cold sweat.

However, the dagger vanished after the slash. If not for the fact that half of Liu Yun’s hair had been cut off and there was a faint bloody mark on his neck, he would have thought that it was just an illusion.

Liu Yun listened attentively, but he couldn’t hear the sound of the dagger at all. There was no wind in the air.

This is indeed horrifying. I would rather meet the black-armored warrior... Liu Yun felt depressed, but he focused his mind and didn’t dare relax.

Suddenly, the dagger appeared at Liu Yun’s waist and stabbed at his waist.

Liu Yun immediately dodged to the side. His clothes were pierced, but he still managed to dodge.

Zhou Wen watched from the side as the dagger constantly appeared. It was like a ghost whose trajectory he couldn’t figure out. Every time it appeared, it was as though it had teleported.

When it vanished, Truth Listener couldn’t hear its location.

Liu Yun’s skills were extraordinary. He managed to dodge the various attacks of the dagger time and time again. His body made all sorts of unimaginable poses. At most, he would lift one foot from the ground, never two at the same time. There were certain poses that even a professional acrobat might not be able to do.

“Senior Brother, your movement technique is pretty good. Where did you learn it?” Zhou Wen asked with a smile.

“You’re still gloating at me despite the situation. Hurry up and help me think of a way to deal with this fellow,” Liu Yun said gloomily.

“Since you have the ability to dodge, find an opportunity to slash it. Perhaps you can slice it apart with one strike,” Zhou Wen said.

“You make it sound simple. How would I know that I would enter such a crappy place? I usually use Companion Beasts, so I don’t have any ordinary weapons,” said Liu Yun.

“You should have said so earlier. I have a weapon. I can rent it out to you,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Cut the crap. Give it to me quickly.” Liu Yun dodged the dagger’s attack and shouted at Zhou Wen.

“How much will you be paying for rent?” Zhou Wen said in a relaxed manner when he saw that he wasn’t in much danger.

“You can charge however much you want. Junior Brother, can’t you be a little more humane in times like this?” Liu Yun felt like crying.

“Tell me first, what movement technique is that?” Zhou Wen was especially interested in movement techniques. Liu Yun’s movement technique wasn’t as fast as Zhou Wen’s, but his body could make all sorts of strange poses. It was something that ordinary humans couldn’t accomplish. It was definitely a special Essence Energy Skill.
