Chapter 1883: Advancement to the Apocalypse Grade

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen felt his mind explode as his consciousness entered that strange space.

In the void, the woman who had appeared in Zhou Wen’s dream floated in the air with the Devil King.

“How dare you stand in front of me?” The Sigh of the King stared coldly at the Devil King.

The Devil King only glanced at her, seemingly in no mood to speak. Her eyes were filled with contempt.

The Sigh of the King was infuriated. With a wave of her arm, infinite light immediately appeared in the void. Light shone over the Devil King from all directions as though it wanted to melt the entire world to become part of the light.

!!

However, when the layers of light arrived in front of the Devil King, it seemed to freeze.

In the next second, with a gaze from the Devil King, all the light shattered. The entire void space shattered with the light.

The Sigh of the King shattered as well. Cracks appeared on her body, leaving her face filled with surprise.

“You… took that step…” Sigh of the King’s figure began to separate and was about to shatter like glass. She looked at the Devil King with an odd expression.

The Devil King ignored her and only watched indifferently as the Sigh of the King cracked. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Crack!

The Sigh of the King’s body shattered along with the entire void, turning into fragments that began to soar.

“We… will meet again…” The Sigh of the King’s voice gradually dissipated in the shattered void.

“You’re just a wisp of consciousness. Are you even worthy?” the Devil King said coldly.

Zhou Wen felt his brain and heart ache terribly. It wasn’t just his brain and heart. It was as though every cell in his body was being ripped apart, making him almost go berserk from the pain.

He didn’t wish to experience this feeling a second time in his life. It was as though someone had pulled out his blood vessels or bones. Even his brain felt like it had been plucked out piece by piece.

Pain. There was nothing but pain. Then, there was an endless emptiness. It was as though something important had been pulled out of his body. His soul felt like it was about to fly out of his body.

Just as he thought his soul was about to return to hell, a strange energy suddenly surged out of his body.

The power didn’t come from the Devil King or any external force, but from Zhou Wen’s body.

It was like a seed that had been planted. After thousands of years, it suddenly sprouted and crawled out from the ground, revealing a sprout filled with vitality.

Every cell surged with vitality, gradually awakening his body. The emptiness was gradually filled, and he was even more energetic than before.

Zhou Wen felt an unprecedented sense of relief. It was as though the shackles on his body had been unlocked as he rushed out of prison to be reborn.

When he opened his eyes, he realized that the Devil King in front of him had vanished. The nine Devil pets had also vanished. Everything that had happened seemed like a dream, as though it had never happened.

Zhou Wen naturally knew that it wasn’t a dream. He hurriedly checked his Companion Beast information.

Demonic Neonate’s name had vanished from the Companion Beast list, but he was surprised to see Devil King’s name.

Devil King: ???

However, all the information on the Devil King was question marks. There was nothing to be seen. Even she didn’t even know what level she was at.

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he hurriedly checked his information.

The original Life Providence was no longer Sigh of the King, but a new name—Human Sovereign.

Zhou Wen wore a complicated expression. He roughly understood what had happened.

Previously, the Sigh of the King Life Providence was transformed from the soul he absorbed from the Lost Immortal Sutra. Or rather, it was transformed from the woman in the Lost Immortal Sutra. It wasn’t his true Life Providence.
