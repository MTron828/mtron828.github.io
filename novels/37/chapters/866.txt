Chapter 867: Yin Yang Mirror

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen felt as though his body was uncontrollable as he followed Jing Daoxian in the direction of the Founding Emperor Tomb.

His various bodily functions seemed normal. He could also use his various abilities, but for some reason, he couldn’t help but follow Jing Daoxian.

Zhou Wen didn’t counterattack blindly. He used Truth Listener to observe the ancient mirror in Jing Daoxian’s arms and realized that he and Liu Yun’s shadows were inside.

The problem was that Jing Daoxian’s back was facing them. It was impossible for the ancient mirror to directly reflect them. Why were their shadows inside?

Liu Yun was also led away. He gathered strength in his hand, but after some hesitation, he didn’t dare attack Jing Daoxian.

Although Jing Daoxian had his back facing them and didn’t seem to be on guard, he was Jing Daoxian. Even Liu Yun had to consider the consequences of attacking.

Zhou Wen didn’t take action. Instead, he secretly circulated his Essence Energy Art and switched his Life Souls to see if he could escape the ancient mirror’s control.

If he couldn’t escape the ancient mirror’s control, he would be limited in every aspect if he really were to fight Jing Daoxian. It was almost impossible for him to gain the upper hand.

Truth Listener’s Evil Nullification ability didn’t have any effect. The ancient mirror’s ability clearly didn’t belong to an evil power like a curse. Switching to the Dao Sutra, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder that had the ability to break taboos failed to free Zhou Wen from the ancient mirror’s control.

It’s not a curse or a taboo power. What kind of power is the ancient mirror? Zhou Wen suddenly realized a problem.

Ya’er was in his arms, but there was no sign of her in the ancient mirror.

Why is Ya’er’s shadow missing? Is it because Jing Daoxian didn’t attack Ya’er, or is Ya’er special? Is that ancient mirror useless against her? If it’s because Ya’er is special, what’s special about her? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that the biggest difference between Ya’er and him was that Ya’er had already died once and couldn’t be considered a real living person.

Zhou Wen thought again and switched his Essence Energy Art to Small Perfection of Wisdom. He wanted to see if he could use Supreme Hell King to escape the ancient mirror’s control, but it was useless.

When Zhou Wen switched to Supreme Hell King, he was stunned when he saw Jing Daoxian.

He rubbed his eyes in disbelief and carefully looked at Jing Daoxian’s body. However, the outcome was the same. He couldn’t see any sinflames on Jing Daoxian’s body.

Zhou Wen had seen many humans, but he had never seen anyone without sinflames. At most, it was a matter of how many sinflames they had.

However, Jing Daoxian didn’t have any flames on him. He was unbelievably clean.

That’s impossible... The more evil a person does, the more sinflames they have. Jing Daoxian is the number one devil in the Federation. He has committed countless crimes and killed countless people. How can he not have any sinflames? Ignoring the fact that he’s the number one devil in the Federation, even an ordinary person who hasn’t done any evil in his entire life wouldn’t be without sinflames... Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that Jing Daoxian must have used some special method to extinguish the sinflames on him. However, he didn’t know how he had done it.

Since the Supreme Hell King’s powers were useless, Zhou Wen had to think of other methods. He switched several Essence Energy Arts, but he was unable to break the influence the ancient mirror had on him.

Liu Yun was clearly making various attempts, but like Zhou Wen, he didn’t have any good results.

When they arrived in front of the Founding Emperor Tomb, the two of them were still unable to escape the ancient mirror’s control.

Jing Daoxian stopped and waved the ancient mirror in front of the two of them. The two of them immediately regained their freedom. Jing Daoxian said with a smile, “This ancient mirror is called the Yin Yang Mirror. You might not have heard of it, but in ancient times, this Yin Yang Mirror once left all the gods in the world in awe. It can wipe out souls and kill people. I only used it to lock up one of your souls. If you follow me into the Founding Emperor Tomb, I’ll naturally release the soul trapped in the Yin Yang Mirror. Of course, you can choose not to go. However, this soul will always be locked in the Yin Yang Mirror. Over time, it will probably dissipate.”

“What will happen to someone without a soul?” Liu Yun asked.

“To put it simply, the Yin Yang Mirror divides a person’s soul into three souls and seven senses. Losing a soul isn’t a big deal. You’ll still have two souls and seven senses. Your bodies aren’t damaged, so it won’t kill you. At most, your memory will worsen. Over time, you might become an idiot,” Jing Daoxian said with a smile.

Liu Yun and Zhou Wen exchanged looks. Zhou Wen knew that Jing Daoxian wasn’t being an alarmist. The shadows in the ancient mirror weren’t born out of thin air. They had some connection to their bodies.

Liu Yun suddenly thought of something. He stared at the Yin Yang Mirror and said, “Could it be that the ancient mirror is the legendary Yin Yang Mirror, the supreme treasure in the battle between the gods during the Shang and Zhou dynasty period?”

“You are quite knowledgeable, but it’s not considered a supreme treasure. It’s just a manifestation of a Mythical Companion Beast. However, it’s slightly stronger than ordinary Mythical creatures,” Jing Daoxian said.

“A Terror-grade Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen stared at the Yin Yang Mirror.

Jing Daoxian narrowed his eyes. “To think that you already know about the Terror-grade. That’s right. The Yin Yang Mirror is indeed at the Terror-grade. If I wanted to kill you, it’s just a matter of thinking about it. Therefore, you don’t have to worry about me killing you. This is because I can kill you anytime I want. There’s no need to trick you into entering the Founding Emperor Tomb. As long as you help me enter it to retrieve something, you can regain your freedom. Furthermore, I’ll only take one item from the Founding Emperor Tomb. The rest will be yours.”

“You have the strength, so it’s naturally up to you,” Liu Yun said.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as a tacit agreement.

However, he thought to himself, Since the Yin Yang Mirror Companion Beast can advance to the Terror grade, Companion Beasts like Torch Dragon with the Evolvable attribute should be able to advance to the Terror grade. How can I advance them?

Zhou Wen remembered that The Thearch had said that only those at the Terror grade could defeat the Terror grade. Although he had many pets, none of them were at the Terror grade. It was probably not easy to defeat the Yin Yang Mirror.

It’s too late to think of a way to advance to the Terror grade. Is there a way to bypass the Yin Yang Mirror and kill Jing Daoxian? Zhou Wen felt that he might have a chance.

Jing Daoxian had been severely injured. Furthermore, he had said that his body wasn’t in good condition. Without external help, he probably wouldn’t live long.

“Summon your Earth Elemental Beast and let it take us into the Founding Emperor Tomb. You have to use Earth Escape according to the coordinates I mentioned. It has to be precise, nothing more, nothing less. Otherwise, the three of us will die inside. No one will be spared,” Jing Daoxian said.
