Chapter 962: Dragon Palace

Translator: CKtalon

The shrimp soldiers and crab generals looked terrifying. They stood up upright and were about two to three meters tall. Their faces were strange, and the shells on their bodies were in battle armor form. Their limbs were still as sharp as blades, giving them a ferocious and terrifying feeling. They didn’t have the cuteness and charm they had on the dining table.

However, the shrimp soldiers and crab generals only blocked their path and didn’t immediately attack. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

More shrimp soldiers and crab generals had already arrived on the beach. There were thousands of them. It was unknown how many there were, but they had already surrounded the trio.

The middle-aged man’s expression was nasty as he sighed and said to Zhou Wen, “I told you not to take risks with the child around, but you refused to listen. There’s no chance of leaving now.”

“They don’t seem to have any animosity towards us.” Zhou Wen found it odd. Typically, dimensional creatures would attack humans immediately, but these shrimp soldiers and crabs were in an orderly formation without showing any signs of aggression.

“Is there a need for animosity. Just a mouthful of saliva from each of them can kill us.” The middle-aged man summoned his Companion Beast and planned on risking his life. Then, he said to Zhou Wen, “Although it’s probably impossible for a chance to appear, escape anytime there’s an opening once the fight breaks out.”

With that said, the middle-aged man prepared to charge forward and fight the shrimp soldiers and crab generals who blocked the way.

However, at that moment, the shrimp soldiers and crab generals suddenly parted to the side and opened up a path. A huge, black-armored turtle that was twenty to thirty meters tall walked over like a human. It carried a tusk spear.

Looking at the strange humanoid turtle with bulging muscles and ferocious armor, the middle-aged man was alarmed. Can it be the legendary Mythical creature, Turtle Minister?

Clang!

The Turtle Minister walked in front of them step by step. With every step, it was as though a mountain was moving horizontally, causing the ground to tremble. It stabbed the tusk spear on its shoulder into the ground, and the weight of the spear immediately stabbed a huge hole in the beach. A shock wave surged out from the yellow sand beside it, giving it an extremely powerful aura.

The middle-aged man gritted his teeth. Although he knew that he was no match for the creature, he couldn’t just sit idle as death approached. He would kill whatever he could before dying.

Just as he was about to engage in battle, he suddenly saw the Turtle Minister kneel down on one knee respectfully. He bowed at Zhou Wen and lowered his head as he said in a thunderous voice, “My lord, my master invites you to enter the sea for a gathering. I hope you can agree. I’ll be very grateful.”

The middle-aged man was somewhat dumbfounded. He stared blankly at the Turtle Minister who was kneeling on one knee, almost believing that he was dreaming.

The legendary Mythical creature, Turtle Minister, actually bowed to the young man and respectfully addressed him as lord. It was unbelievable.

The middle-aged man looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression. He was beginning to suspect that Zhou Wen was a terrifying dimensional creature disguised as a human.

“Who’s your master?” Zhou Wen looked in the direction of the sea, but the golden dragon had vanished.

“Sir, you have already met my master. Now, my master is waiting for you in the Dragon Palace,” said the Turtle Minister.

“Then I’ll meet your master. This person has no ill intentions towards you. Let him leave,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the middle-aged man.

“We will obey your orders, my lord.” The Turtle Minister stood up and waved his hand. The shrimp soldiers blocking the way immediately made way.

“Dimensional creatures are ferocious and ruthless. It’s best you don’t take risks,” the middle-aged man said hesitantly.

“It’s fine. It’s just a Dragon Palace. It can’t trap me. Go back now,” Zhou Wen said.

The middle-aged man wore a strange expression, but he couldn’t say anything else. He turned around and headed for the exit of the dimensional zone.

The shrimp soldiers didn’t stop him as expected. They lined up and welcomed Zhou Wen into the sea like a procession.

The shrimp soldiers and crab generals lined up on both sides, parting the seawater. It was as though a curtain had been lifted, revealing a path that led deep into the sea.

When the middle-aged man saw Zhou Wen carry the child into the sea, he gritted his teeth and left the dimensional zone. When he arrived outside the dimensional zone, he looked back at the misty beach and sea. He felt as though he had been dreaming.

A dimensional creature from myths would actually kneel to a human youth. I’m afraid no one will believe me even if I tell them, right? The middle-aged man even wondered if he had been hallucinating.

The Turtle Minister led the way as Zhou Wen walked deep into the sea. The underwater scenery was gorgeous and mysterious. In the seawater that resembled a curtain, there were all sorts of sea creatures wandering everywhere.

He even saw a few beautiful women lying in clams. They were probably the legendary Clam Fairies.

Zhou Wen had always believed that the sea dragons lived in the underwater palace. Just like the famous Crystal Palace was the residence of the East Sea Dragon King.

However, this dragon king didn’t seem too particular. When Zhou Wen arrived at the so-called Dragon Palace, he realized that it was a huge shipwreck. Zhou Wen didn’t know much about ships, nor did he know what type of shipwreck it was. However, from the scale of the ship, Zhou Wen guessed that it was likely an aircraft carrier—humanity’s top marine combat unit before the dimensional storms.

However, after the dimensional storms, the aircraft carriers, various fleets, and cruise ships had mostly been sunk by dimensional creatures.

Even if this ship wasn’t an aircraft carrier, it didn’t look anything like a Dragon Palace.

The sunken ship seemed to be protected by some force, preventing the seawater from approaching it. Zhou Wen followed the Turtle Minister to the deck. The Turtle Minister knelt on one knee again and lowered his head towards the cabin. “Master, the lord is here to meet you.”

“My lord, please follow me.” A graceful clam woman walked over and bowed at Zhou Wen before extending an inviting gesture.

Zhou Wen followed her into the cabin and quickly arrived at a relatively large cabin space.

Just as Zhou Wen was wondering how the gigantic golden dragon entered the cabin, he saw a voluptuous woman wearing golden armor. She had dragon horns on her head and golden hair. She sat on the wide chair opposite him like a queen.

However, the chair didn’t look like the legendary Dragon King Coral Throne. Instead, it looked like a chair in front of a human warship’s console.

So that golden dragon is actually female. It can even take human form! Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he couldn’t help but size up the dragon queen.

The dragon queen had fair skin, but her irises were golden. She looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Are you the spokesperson of the Ancient Dragons?”

“What Ancient Dragons? I’ve never heard of them,” Zhou Wen said.

“If you’re not the representative of the Ancient Dragons, why do you have the keepsake of the Ancient Dragons?” the dragon queen asked with a frown.

“A keepsake of the Ancient Dragons?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback before he thought of something. He took out the dragon tooth pendant on his neck and said, “Are you talking about this? This was carved by my teacher using a dragon tooth. It’s just an ordinary gift, not a keepsake.”

The dragon queen sized up Zhou Wen for a while. “Since you have the Ancient Dragons’ keepsake, no matter where you got it from, you are the representative of the Ancient Dragons. From today onwards, you are the son-in-law of my Dragon Palace.”
