Chapter 1596: Treasurefall Money

Translator: CKtalon

“Toad Immortal is very strong?” Zhou Wen felt that Lady Supreme Yin was persuading him to give the Moon Essence Basin to Jing Daoxian.

“Very. Otherwise, Queen Mother wouldn’t have spent so much effort to suppress it underground instead of killing it.” Lady Supreme Yin paused before adding, “A Heaven-level domain is already a complete domain. Compared to a Hell-level domain, there’s a qualitative difference. Furthermore, you are

only at the Human Realm. It won’t be easy to defeat it.”

Is there no other way? Zhou Wen didn’t think that the Heaven level was that invincible.

At the very least, Godsfall, who already had Heaven-level power, was killed by the Zone Core of the Forbidden Land of the Gods.

Now that Zhou Wen had inherited the power of the Forbidden Land of the Gods’ core, although he was still at the Human Realm, it wasn’t impossible for him to restrain Toad Immortal. It was just like how his Teacher Domain restrained the toad’s devouring domain.

“Toad Immortal and the toad are two different concepts. Toad Immortal’s powers are very special. Even Queen Mother wasn’t able to kill it. It’s obvious how terrifying it is.” Lady Supreme Yin continued urging Zhou Wen not to clash head-on with Toad Immortal.

“What kind of power does Toad Immortal have?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I don’t know. I only know that the power of moonlight has a restraining effect on its strength. That’s why the Moon Essence Basin was used to suppress i

creatures have reached their full potential resulting in qualitative changes. It’s not a wise idea to fight them.”

“Don’t take any chances. Although you might both be at the Calamity grade, the domain powers of Heaven-level

“Tunderstand.” Zhou Wen nodded.

He took in Lady Supreme Yin’s advice, but he was unwilling to give up the Moon Essence Basin and the Skyimmortal Swan.

After returning to Earth, Zhou Wen thought about what to do.

He believed that there was a solution to everything. Although the Heaven Realm was powerful, it wasn’t impossible for him to win.

Til figure out the Teacher Domain first before thinking of a way to fight Toad Immortal. If there’s really no other way, I’ll lure it to the Big Dipper dimensional zone. I don’t believe I can’t kill it there. Zhou Wen never thought of giving the Moon Essence Basin and the Skyimmortal Swan to Jing Daoxian.

Jing Daoxian was resting in a wooden hut outside Yinxu. Liu Yun was drawing a map.

“Old man, why did you lay a trap for Zhou Wen? Couldn’t you just negotiate with him nicely?” Liu Yun grumbled as he drew.

Jing Daoxian said with a smile, “In this world, don’t place your hopes on the kindness and sympathy of others.”

“That’s not sympathy, alright? It should be a partnership,” Liu Yun said gloomily. “With Zhou Wen’s temper, it’s definitely impossible for him to give you the Moon Essence Basin. Without it to advance the Yin Yang Mirror to the Heaven level, I want to see how you can enter Yinxu.”

“He will come. In the face of death, a so-called temper is nothing,” Jing Daoxian said confidently.

“Are you that confident in Toad Immortal? My junior brother has killed Hell-level creatures before. The Heaven level is only one level higher.” Liu Yun was puzzled as to why Jing Daoxian was so confident in Toad Immortal.

“Toad Immortal is also known as Golden Toad Immortal. Its most famous ability is Treasurefall Money,” Jing Daoxian said slowly.

“Treasurefall Money? The legendary ability that can shake off all Dharma treasures?” Liu Yun was alarmed.

“That’s just a myth. The true Treasurefall Money is actually a sealing force. Be it creatures or weapons, be it humans or Companion Beasts, as long as they are struck by Treasurefall Money, they will be sealed. They will no longer be able to use any of their strength and become ordinary,” Jing Daoxian said.

“Then isn’t Junior Brother in grave danger?” Liu Yun said in surprise.

Everyone knew that Zhou Wen’s main combat strength was his Companion Beasts, but Toad Immortal could seal Companion Beasts. In its domain, Companion Beasts were useless.

Ignoring the fact that Zhou Wen didn’t have a Guardian, even if he did, he would still be sealed by the Treasurefall Money.

Unless one’s strength far exceeded Toad Immortals, preventing him from using Treasurefall Money, it was very difficult for them to stand a chance of winning.

“With that punks life-preservation means, it should be more than enough for him to escape and seek my help,” Jing Daoxian said indifferently.

Liu Yun thought for a moment and found that Zhou Wen’s stumbling over while crying for help made him feel excited.

“Then let’s wait for Zhou Wen to come pleaing.” Liu Yun’s mind had already surfaced the scene of his junior brother rolling and crawling over to hug his thigh. He felt an unbearable itch, eager for that moment to arrive immediately.

Zhou Wen didn’t have Liu Yun’s rich imagination. He was currently studying the Teacher Domain.

The Teacher Domain was formed by his talent combined with his Essence Energy Art and the Zone Core. His strength and Essence Energy Art’s powers were easily understood, but the power brought by the Zone Core was unfamiliar to Zhou Wen.

After any creature fused with the Zone Core, they needed a process of figuring it out to unleash the true abilities of the domain.

Some domains were relatively easy to understand. For example, some high-temperature domains only needed one to change the temperature.

However, just because it was easy to understand didn’t mean that it could be used properly. A high-temperature domain wasn’t as simple as just blindly raising the temperature. There were also techniques to exploit the difference in temperature. Those needed to be figured out and practiced.

Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain was more complicated because it had very complicated abilities.

After constant testing, Zhou Wen came to understand the various abilities it had.

The most important ability in the Teacher Domain was to seal all nomological powers. In the past, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder could only prevent Zhou Wen from being affected by various taboo powers. It was considered a passive ability.

Now, the Teacher Domain could seal all nomological powers and taboos within the domain. Essence Energy couldn’t be released and could only circulate in creatures’ bodies.2

Therefore, in the Teacher Domain, all creatures could only rely on their bodies to fight. It was almost impossible for them to release their strength.

All sorts of domain powers were sealed in the Teacher Domain. Most domain powers were ineffective. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, there were some domain powers that were applied to one’s body. The Teacher Domain had little influence on such powers.

Of course, Zhou Wen still didn’t know what the limits of the Teacher Domain were or if it could seal high-level domains.

This sealing power wasn’t everything the Teacher Domain had. It could even be said that it was only the basic ability of the Teacher Domain. Some abilities were built on this foundation.

For example, one could selectively remove the seal. As for the person who used the ability in the Teacher Domain, the pattern and trajectory of the ability would be recorded by the Teacher Domain.

Zhou Wen could directly understand his opponent’s various abilities. He could even know the flaws of his opponent’s abilities through comparison using the Teacher Domain itself.
