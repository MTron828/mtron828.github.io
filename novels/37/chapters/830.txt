Chapter 831: Fiend Tomb

“I’ll naturally follow our host’s arrangements,” Moses said with a smile.

Zhang Chunqiu bowed slightly and said, “I’ve already prepared a place for you to stay. Zhang Xiao will take you there. I hope you don’t mind.”

“Thank you,” Moses said.

Zhang Xiao took Moses and company to their residence. Before he left, he glared fiercely at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen found it baffling. Although he had taken Zhang Yuzhi out on a trip the last time, he had ultimately sent her back safely. Was there a need to hold a grudge?

Zhou Wen didn’t know that his Tyrant Behemoth had actually been lost by the Zhang family. Zhang Xiao already knew that Tyrant Behemoth was his and wasn’t angry with him because of Zhang Yuzhi.

“Zhou Wen, come with me. Celestial Master Manor has already prepared a guest room. Yuzhi is waiting for you there,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.

Zhou Wen originally didn’t wish to head to the Zhang family so early, but since Zhang Chunqiu was already here, he had no choice but to make a trip. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The Celestial Master Manor was situated beside a mountain and a river. It was an excellent place. The Zhang family had lived here for generations. They were good at geomancy so they naturally chose the right place.

Upon seeing Celestial Master Manor, Zhou Wen thought of a legend regarding Celestial Master Zhang.

Legend had it that Celestial Master Zhang’s father was a geomancy expert. He had found an excellent cave with great traits according to geomancy for his father and wanted to bury him there.

The cave was located along an Emperor Dragon vein. This implied that there would definitely be an emperor among his descendants in the future.

However, during the burial, a burly man who was carrying the coffin couldn’t hold back his bladder. He ran nearby and peed. He happened to pee on the dragon vein. A bolt from the blue sounded; dissipating the dragon aura and eliminating the possibility of a human emperor.

Celestial Master Zhang’s father sighed at the Zhang family’s lack of fortune, but he didn’t blame the burly man. He still buried his father in the cave and left a message saying that the cave had lost its dragon aura, but the layout was still fine. The Zhang family would definitely produce a master in the future.

Indeed, his son, Zhang Daoling, eventually became Celestial Master of the Orthodox Unity. He wasn’t just a master, but an immortal-like figure back then.

Zhang Chunqiu led Zhou Wen into Celestial Master Manor and led him into the main hall.

“Where’s Yuzhi?” Zhou Wen asked when he didn’t see Zhang Yuzhi.

Zhang Chunqiu said, “I’ve already gotten someone to call her over. She should be here soon. There’s no rush. Let’s have a chat first.”

Zhou Wen thought to himself, There’s nothing to chat about between us. I don’t know you at all, right?

However, Zhang Chunqiu said, “That Tyrant Behemoth is your Companion Beast, right?”

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He didn’t know how Zhang Chunqiu knew, but he had no intention of denying it. He looked at Zhang Chunqiu and said, “Why are you suddenly asking about this?”

Zhang Chunqiu said, “Tyrant Behemoth was originally a Companion Egg from the West District. An elder of our Zhang family went to the West District to cultivate and obtained a Tyrant Behemoth Companion Beast in a dimensional zone named Genesis Garden. He originally planned on leaving it for talented juniors to use, but to his surprise, a spy appeared among us. He ingeniously did a swap and brought it out of Celestial Master Manor.”

“Our Behemoth shouldn’t be the same one, right?” Zhou Wen naturally didn’t admit it. He didn’t know if Zhang Chunqiu was telling the truth. Even if it was, Zhou Wen couldn’t return Tyrant Behemoth.

“Don’t worry. Since it has been lost, it means that Tyrant Behemoth isn’t fated with our Zhang family. Furthermore, you have already hatched it, so we won’t make things difficult for you by asking you to return it.” Zhang Chunqiu continued, “Behemoth is unique. It wasn’t obtained by killing a dimensional creature, but from an opportunity. It’s impossible for there to be a second one. We don’t plan on getting it back either. We just want to know how you obtained the Companion Egg so that we can know how it was swapped. That way, we can be on guard in the future.”

“I got it at an auction. I originally thought it was a Minotaur, I never expected it to be a Behemoth.” Zhou Wen recounted the process of obtaining Tyrant Behemoth.

“So that’s how it was. I know how the Behemoth Companion Egg was swapped and taken out. Zhou Wen, you are indeed someone with great luck. The other party must have been prepared to bid for the Behemoth Companion Egg, but it ended up being intercepted by you. There must have been an accident, but we just aren’t aware of it.” Zhang Chunqiu really had no intention of pursuing the matter.

“If it’s possible, can I ask you to help our Zhang family with Tyrant Behemoth? Of course, we won’t scrimp on compensation. The spirit talismans created by our Celestial Master Manor are still rather useful. I’ll use a Life Reversing Spirit Talisman as payment. What do you think?” Zhang Chunqiu continued.

“What do you want me to do?” Zhou Wen looked at Zhang Chunqiu in puzzlement.

He had heard of the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman before. Furthermore, he had heard of it from Liu Yun. A while ago, Liu Yun had used the Zhang family’s Life Reversing Spirit Talisman to steal his Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. It was obvious that the spirit talisman was quite impressive.

If the Zhang family was willing to offer such a good item as a reward, it would definitely not be an easy task.

“Have you heard of the Fiend Tomb?” Zhang Chunqiu asked.

Zhou Wen shook his head. He had never heard of it.

“It’s not your fault. Few outsiders know about the Fiend Tomb. Over the years, our Zhang family has been guarding the Fiend Tomb and suppressing the dimensional creatures inside, preventing them from rushing out. We paid a huge price for this. It’s unimaginable to outsiders,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a serious expression.

“What kind of place is Fiend Tomb?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Have you heard of the story of my Zhang family, the one about the search for a special cave to bury a father?” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t answer and instead asked.

“I’ve heard of it. I heard that the grandfather of the Celestial Master of the Orthodox Unity found a treasure cave for the burial. The extraordinary Celestial Master of the Orthodox Unity was a result of this geomancy augmentation,” Zhou Wen said.

Zhang Chunqiu nodded. “That’s probably what the rumors say. Do you think they’re reliable?”

“I don’t know much about this.” It wasn’t appropriate for Zhou Wen to say that he believed it, nor did he say that he didn’t.

If he said that he believed it, it would be as though he was saying that the Zhang family relied on luck. If he said that he didn’t believe it, wouldn’t it mean that the Zhang family was lying? They didn’t obtain any mandate at all.

Zhang Chunqiu smiled and didn’t say if the legend was true. He only said, “That cave is where the Fiend Tomb is.”

“Ah!” Zhou Wen widened his eyes as he looked at Zhang Chunqiu in disbelief.

The legendary cave that could give birth to an emperor and produce a Celestial Master was actually the Fiend Tomb that Zhang Chunqiu mentioned. It was unbelievable.

“Under the influence of the dimensional storms, the anomaly in the already extraordinary Fiend Tomb worsened. Our Zhang family has tried everything we can to deal with the Fiend Tomb, but the situation has only worsened. If possible, I hope you can use Tyrant Behemoth to help us temporarily suppress it.” Zhang Chunqiu explained what he needed Zhou Wen to do in detail.
