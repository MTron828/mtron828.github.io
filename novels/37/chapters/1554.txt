Chapter 1555: It’s Not What I Want

Translator: CKtalon

The sword intent from the vine sword surged into Sword Pill, shattering all of Sword Pill’s three thousand sword intents.

Sword Pill that had already transformed into the Immortal Culling Sword gradually returned to its sword pill form.

Zhou Wen felt as though Sword Pill had turned into a huge furnace. Its three thousand sword intents seemed to melt as they gradually fused into one.

And what melted the three thousand sword intents into one was the sword intent on the vine sword.

Zhou Wen didn’t sense any sword aura from the vine sword from beginning to end, but its sword intent was unimaginably powerful.

He had never seen a sword intent this powerful. Even without the sword aura, just the sword intent alone could probably affect one’s heart.

As the sword intent constantly fused, Zhou Wen sensed that Sword Pill had begun to evolve and condense a domain.

However, this domain was condensed rather strangely. It was a pure sword intent domain without any sword auras participating.

A pure sword intent domain? Is that really good??Zhou Wen wore an odd expression, unsure if it was suitable for him.

The Qi Refinement Art was clearly an Essence Energy Art that focused on cultivating Essence Energy, but the Calamity Zone that condensed was a pure sword intent domain.

No matter what Zhou Wen thought, the Qi Refinement Art didn’t have synergy with such a domain.

As the sword intent in the vine sword fused into Sword Pill, the vine sword itself began to shatter, turning into scattering dust.

The thousands of swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb fell to the ground like subjects who worshiped their monarch. Only a few swords returned to the Sword Tomb without trembling like the other swords.

This included the sword that had pierced through the Chaos Egg and nearly killed Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen didn’t see this. He was pondering if such a domain was what he needed.

Pure sword intent domains weren’t bad. As long as a domain existed, it had to have a reason for its existence. Zhou Wen was considering if such a domain suited himself and the Qi Refinement Art.

The domain was slowly taking form. Zhou Wen could already sense how powerful it was. Just the nascent domain had made thousands of swords submit.

Most of the swords in the sword intent domain had lost their effects. If someone were to fight Zhou Wen with a sword in hand, the sword in the enemy’s hands would suddenly lose the effects they originally had. It would be too easy for Zhou Wen to defeat his opponent.

Such a domain was very strong, but Zhou Wen felt that it wasn’t the domain he needed.

Perhaps others might find it satisfying to enfeeble their opponent, thereby crushing them, but Zhou Wen didn’t like that.

Even if he wanted to defeat his opponent, Zhou Wen hoped to defeat an opponent at peak condition and not an opponent whose ability to resist had been stripped away. That would only make Zhou Wen find it boring.

This isn’t the domain I want.?Zhou Wen already understood what he really wanted.

However, how could he reverse the domain that was forming? Zhou Wen didn’t know. He had never had such experience, nor did he know if he could change the domain that was taking form.

If it were in reality, Zhou Wen would only wait for the domain to be completed. It would be equivalent to courting death to do something at such a critical stage.

However, in-game, no matter how much nonsense he did, he would only die. He could revive from a drop of blood.

At most, I’ll fail at condensing a domain. I’d rather fail than have a domain I don’t like.?Zhou Wen steeled his resolve as his strength erupted crazily. He forcefully stopped the transmission of sword intent, hoping to throw out the remaining half of the vine sword.

However, Zhou Wen’s desperate attempt failed to throw out the vine sword. Instead, his sword intent clashed with the broken sword’s sword intent.

The Sword Pill, that was already on track and was fusing to form a domain, instantly warped. The sword intent domain that had already been produced began to collapse.

Thousands of swords that had already submitted to the ground gradually raised their tips again. As though they were attracted by a magnet, their tips pointed at Zhou Wen.

The domain constantly collapsed as the swords gradually floated up again, surrounding Zhou Wen.

Once Zhou Wen’s incomplete domain completely collapsed, the swords would kill him just like before.

So what if I die? It’s better than having a domain I don’t like. It’s best if you kill me quickly to prevent the domain from condensing successfully.?Zhou Wen wanted the domain to collapse faster, but now, all sorts of sword intents were running amok in his body as though he had been possessed. He couldn’t even control his body, so there was no chance of dying even if he wanted to.

The vine sword’s sword intent was still gushing in, but the sword intent in Sword Pill was flowing out and surging into Zhou Wen’s body. The sword intent originally formed from three thousand sword intents had already become countless fragments that were about to fuse into one after being struck by the vine sword’s intent.

Under normal circumstances, when the three thousand sword intents completely fused with the vine sword intent, it would be when the domain was successfully condensed.

When that happened, all the sword intents would no longer be distinguishable. They would become one, having no effect on Zhou Wen.

However, after the three thousand sword intents were shattered while in an incomplete fused state, all sorts of sword intent fragments rushed out and affected Zhou Wen’s mind.

It felt like a movie’s editing had gone wrong. An action movie, a romance movie, a wuxia movie, a science fiction movie had been edited and stitched together. Scenes would switch to completely unrelated scenes when played. It was a confusing sight. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhou Wen’s firm willpower thankfully prevented him from being affected by the psychedelic sword intent.

However, as the vine sword intent surged in, Zhou Wen realized that the sword intent fragments seemed to slowly return to their previous trajectories. It was as though they were about to begin condensing a domain again.

No, you can’t do that!?Zhou Wen attempted to use his mental strength to control the sword intent fragments. He didn’t have a certain goal—he just wanted to mess things up.

It wasn’t easy to stop the domain from condensing, but Zhou Wen thought that as long as he could restrain the vine sword’s sword intent and prevent the domain from taking form, he could wait for the swords to kill him.

At that moment, the swords in the Ancient Sword Tomb had already flown up again and were aimed at Zhou Wen.

With a hum, thousands of swords shot out at Zhou Wen.

Here they come!?Zhou Wen was overjoyed. He didn’t have a Chaos Egg around him now. The swords would probably be able to kill him very quickly if they attacked, so it was impossible for him to condense the Calamity Zone successfully.

Just as the thousands of swords rushed in front of Zhou Wen who was already awaiting death with his eyes closed, his face filled with a smile, something unexpected happened.
