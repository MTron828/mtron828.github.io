Chapter 1722 Chaos Heaven Level

Why can the Chaos Egg suddenly be used continuously? Zhou Wen knew that something had definitely happened to the Chaos Egg, but he wasn’t sure what caused the change.

Such a change was definitely related to the use of the Chaos Egg. Between the rainbow phoenix and the grass fruit baby, one of them had definitely affected the Chaos Egg; Zhou Wen was more inclined to the former.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen made another attempt. He could immediately use the Chaos Egg after it exploded. He didn’t need to wait like before.

This is a little strange. The Chaos Egg clearly hasn’t advanced to the Heaven Realm, but it’s very different from before. What’s going on? Zhou Wen carefully sensed the Chaos Egg’s every shattering and rebirth. He increasingly felt that the changes in the Chaos Egg were related to the rainbow phoenix.

Or rather, it was related to the rainbow flames. The Chaos Egg underwent such a change after being burned by the rainbow flames.

Previously, the Chaos Egg exploded countless times, but there weren’t any special changes. Now, there’s actually such a change. Could it be that this rainbow phoenix is really different? Then, if this continues, will the Chaos Egg have a chance of advancing to the Heaven Realm? Zhou Wen’s mind stirred.

The Chaos Egg hadn’t changed for a long time. Now that he finally saw the opportunity to advance it to the Heaven Realm, Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t let it go.

It was only because Zhou Wen had many life-preservation means. Anyone else would be eager to escape; they wouldn’t have such thoughts in a battle of such magnitude.

The Chaos Egg exploded again and again. Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Chaos Egg that hadn’t stirred for a long time had finally undergone a clear change.

It really works! Zhou Wen was overjoyed.

“Junior Brother, aren’t you going to escape? What are you waiting for?” Liu Yun’s voice sounded again. It was obvious that he was puzzled.

“Eldest Senior Brother, didn’t you say that the sword was protected by a phoenix? Is that phoenix the same one as this?” Zhou Wen asked.

“They are all rainbow colors, but it seems a little different. It’s definitely not the same one. Furthermore, that phoenix has always been rainbow-colored. It’s unlike this phoenix which was a pheasant in the beginning,” Liu Yun answered.

“Does that mean that as long as I can deal with this phoenix, it shouldn’t be difficult to retrieve the sword?” Although Zhou Wen said that, his thoughts were somewhat different. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Zhou Wen wasn’t too concerned about getting the sword. He was considering whether he should try his luck with the other phoenix if this phoenix’s rainbow flames couldn’t advance the Chaos Egg to the Heaven level.

“What are you thinking? There might still be some hope if you manage to get Human Sovereign’s Companion Beast; otherwise, stop dreaming,” Liu Yun probed.

“That might not be the case.” Zhou Wen thought to himself, Truth Listener’s offensive strength is indeed powerful, but the Chaos Egg’s defense isn’t weak either. If it can advance to the Heaven level, it might be able to withstand the rainbow phoenix’s flames.

Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else. When Liu Yun saw the Chaos Egg explode again and again, he imagined that Zhou Wen was just being stubborn. He continued, “Hold on a little longer. I’ve already contacted the old fellow. When he comes, he might have a way to help you escape.”

“Jing Daoxian has already reached the Heaven level?” Zhou Wen was somewhat alarmed.

“No, but the old fellow has many solutions. There are some things that we can’t do, but he has a way to resolve them. We have to accept this. The old dogs hunt the best,” said Liu Yun.

Zhou Wen believed him-a person like Jing Daoxian couldn’t be measured by his level.

Although Zhou Wen wanted to know what level Jing Daoxian was at, it wasn’t appropriate to ask Liu Yun. After all, he and Jing Daoxian might be enemies in the future. Getting Liu Yun to betray his own kin wasn’t something Zhou Wen could bring himself to do, even if Liu Yun was willing to say.

“Why isn’t the old fellow here yet?” Liu Yun was somewhat worried that Zhou Wen wouldn’t be able to last long when he saw the Chaos Egg crack again and again. However, he hadn’t received a response after sending a message. Jing Daoxian hadn’t appeared either.

Zhou Wen’s endurance far exceeded Liu Yun’s expectations. Every time Liu Yun felt that Zhou Wen couldn’t last much longer, the latter proved him wrong.

Liu Yun was almost numb towards the end.

I wonder what Essence Energy Art this junior brother of mine cultivates in. Why are there so many strange abilities? How many Essence Energy Arts has he cultivated? Liu Yun guessed inwardly.

Typically, people would only cultivate one Essence Energy Art. Humans who could cultivate two Essence Energy Arts at the same time were already rare.

However, with Liu Yun’s understanding of Zhou Wen, the latter definitely had more than two Essence Energy Arts.

If I didn’t know that it was impossible for this fellow to join the dimension, I would have thought that he had long betrayed his humanity. It’s unbelievable that a pure human can do this... Liu Yun actually suspected that Zhou Wen was no longer human like Wang Mingyuan.

Otherwise, it would be almost impossible for others to advance to the Mythical stage by cultivating two Essence Energy Arts-even if they used a Mythical Serum. Yet, Zhou Wen was already at the Calamity grade. Furthermore, he used far more than two Essence Energy Arts.

After the Chaos Egg shattered countless times, Zhou Wen finally felt that it had reached a critical point. It didn’t stir much as though success was a matter of course. When the Chaos Egg was summoned again, it had already advanced to the Heaven level and was somewhat different from before.

The Heaven level! Zhou Wen looked at the Chaos Egg, eager to know what changes the Heaven-level Chaos Egg had undergone.

The greatest possibility was that the stacking of Essence Energy Crystals increased, but when the rainbow flames burned over, Zhou Wen realized that the stacking numbers of Essence Energy Crystals didn’t change. They were still in the hundreds of millions, so there was no way to continue stacking them.

Soon, Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised to discover a large number of Essence Energy Crystals appear in the Chaos Egg. The Chaos Egg would have exploded in the past, but now, with so many Essence Energy Crystals inside, it didn’t feel crowded at all.

The space inside the Chaos Egg has expanded! No, it’s not as simple as having expanded!

The rainbow flames constantly burned the Chaos Egg. The number of Essence Energy Crystals inside the Chaos Egg was uncountable, but despite the space being limited, it didn’t pile up.

The Chaos Egg stopped shattering. After a while, he suddenly heard Liu Yun’s voice again. Furthermore, his emotions seemed rather unstable.

“Holy sh*t, don’t tell me that you planned on using the phoenix to cultivate from the beginning?” Liu Yun shouted. He could now tell that the Chaos Egg had advanced.

“No, I just did some last-minute training,” Zhou Wen said truthfully.

Liu Yun fell silent. After a while, he heard Liu Yun say through gritted teeth, “Freak!”
