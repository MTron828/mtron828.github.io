Chapter 1473 Zhou Wen’s Decision

In a corner of the cemetery, there was a wild pear tree. It hadn’t been long since the fruiting season, but now, it was beginning to bloom again. Furthermore, it didn’t take long before fruits began to fall.

The various vegetation in the cemetery grew crazily. The originally short weeds had grown to the height of a person. The entire cemetery was covered in green.

Not long after, pears grew on the wild pear tree. It took only slightly more than half an hour. At the speed the pears grew, they would completely ripen in less than an hour.

Zhou Wen waited for a while and indeed, he saw the pear ripen. It looked plump and juicy. He reached out and plucked one and took a bite. Immediately, his mouth was filled with sweetness as though he had drunk honey.

It’s so sweet! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.

He was delighted that the Sovereign Sui statue had such might, allowing vegetation to grow rapidly. If they could occupy this place, they wouldn’t have to worry about food in the future. They would be self-sufficient and no one could besiege the people in here. It was the best place to build a base.

What was surprising was that this power wasn’t only effective against plants. If humans were also affected by this power, then what humans welcomed wasn’t rapid growth, but rapid aging.

Zhou Wen didn’t know how many times a pear tree bore fruit a year. Even if it happened twice a year, it was very likely that half a year had passed in less than an hour.

If humans experienced time with similar ratios, how long could they last?

This was only Zhou Wen’s guess. Perhaps the power of Sovereign Sui’s statue didn’t make animals age, but it was better to be safe than sorry.

Furthermore, there wasn’t a single dimensional creature or animal in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. This didn’t seem to be a coincidence. According to these points of suspicion, the power of Sovereign Sui’s statue might very well have an effect on animals. Therefore, no dimensional creature dared to stay in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. Or rather, those dimensional creatures had already died due to the influence of the statue.

What was even more terrifying was that this power wasn’t as simple as a temporal power. If time was accelerated, Zhou Wen would definitely be able to sense it. However, other than sensing the blazing vitality emitted by the torch, he couldn’t sense any negative energy.

After being affected by the power of blessings, Zhou Wen knew that the most terrifying power in the world wasn’t necessarily the ferocious and vicious ones.

Instead, some seemingly beneficial powers were likely terrifying murderers hidden in the shadows.

“Chick, put out the fire,” Zhou Wen shouted at Chick who had landed on the top of Sovereign Sui’s statue. He didn’t dare take the risk. If the accelerating power was equally effective on him, wouldn’t he quickly become an old man?

When Chick heard Zhou Wen, it opened its mouth and sucked at the flames. The flames on the torch immediately transformed into a thin pillar that charged into Chick’s mouth like a fountain.

Moments later, all the flames were devoured by Chick. The torch in the hand of the Sovereign Sui statue stopped burning, and the plants in the cemetery stopped growing crazily. Zhou Wen waited for a while and was pleasantly surprised when he saw that nothing abnormal had happened to the plants. They just stopped growing rapidly. Such accelerated ripening would usually result in a rapid decline after losing the energy supply.

The plants didn’t show any signs of withering. This meant that they hadn’t been excessively drained of their vitality, and was undoubtedly good news.

Zhou Wen left Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, grabbed some wild animals, and sent them inside before getting Chick to light the torch.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare stay in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. He left with Chick and planned on returning in a few days to take a look. If the animals died of old age, it would mean that Sovereign Sui’s Tomb wasn’t suitable as a human base.

Of course, even if it couldn’t be used as a human base, the power of Sovereign Sui’s Tomb was still very useful. Zhou Wen already planned on staying in Guide City. Regardless, he had to have Sovereign Sui’s Tomb under his control.

After returning to the Sunset Army’s temporary command post and meeting An Sheng, Zhou Wen told him about his wish to stay in Guide City.

“Young Master, with your strength, it’s not a problem for you to stay anywhere. However, have you ever thought that if you were the only one, what’s the difference between staying or not? You are just one person, so even if you stay here, Guide City doesn’t belong to you,” An Sheng said. Zhou Wen understood what An Sheng meant. If no one else worked for him and defended the plundering of the resources from the area, it didn’t matter if he stayed or not. Even if he didn’t stay, he could come over anytime he needed in the future. There was no point in staying here. “I want to establish a human city here.” Zhou Wen had already thought it through. There was the stone saber here that even The Thearch coveted. There was the humanoid monster, Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, Butterfly Valley, and other dimensional zones. He didn’t know how many dimensional zones had yet to be explored.

It was undoubtedly most suitable to establish a human city here.

It might be a little difficult in the beginning, but the value would increase with time. If it were only Zhou Wen himself, he had no intention of establishing a human city that belonged to him. However, the three conditions mentioned by the humanoid monster weren’t something he could complete alone. This required the efforts of many humans.

Zhou Wen only had the thought of establishing a city after leaving Ancient City.

“It’s not difficult to build houses, but to truly make those houses a city needs people. With Guide City’s present dire environment, how many people will be willing to stay here?” An Sheng persuaded.

“I know it’ll be very difficult, but I still want to give it a try,” Zhou Wen said.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, An Sheng smiled and said, “Young Master, since you’ve already decided, I won’t say another word. Just tell me what resources you need and how many people you need. I’ll do my best to help you obtain them.”

“Thanks, Ah Sheng. However, I wish to do it by myself to the greatest extent.” Although Zhou Wen was very grateful, he still rejected An Sheng “Alright, but you have to remember that we are family. No matter where you are, the people from Overseer Manor and I are always worth relying on. Don’t shoulder burdens alone,” An Sheng said seriously.

“Don’t worry. If I can’t do it, I’ll definitely head to Luoyang to freeload. If there’s really a need, I won’t stand on ceremony with you and Sis Lan,” Zhou Wen said with a smile. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

An Sheng laughed out loud. “Young Master Wen, how long are you going to keep up your spite with Overseer?”

“You have to ask An Tianzuo that. I’m very easygoing. I never get into trouble with anyone, nor have I ever taken that particular person to heart,” Zhou Wen said seriously.

An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen without a word, but his eyes seemed to have a hint of contempt, making Zhou Wen feel uncomfortable.
