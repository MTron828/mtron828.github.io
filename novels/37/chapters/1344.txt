Chapter 1345: Snow White

“Calm down… Calm down… There’s no poison in my chocolate… I just added some stinky tofu…” Gao Dawei immediately waved his hand and explained when he saw Zhou Wen and company’s unfriendly expressions.

Zhou Wen sniffed carefully and realized that the stench was really similar to the smell of stinky tofu he had smelled on the streets when he was young.

“Stuffing chocolate with stinky tofu? Are you messing with us?” Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t ease because of Gao Dawei’s explanation.

Gao Dawei shook his head and said with a serious expression, “How is that possible? I’m a professional chocolate chef. I definitely won’t make a mockery of my work. Since the bitterness of cocoa powder can turn into a memorable fragrance, the smell of stinky tofu shares the same principle. I thought about mixing these two extreme flavors together and perhaps creating a new and unique taste…”

Seeing the look in Ya’er and Sweetie’s eyes, Gao Dawei hurriedly said, “Unfortunately, it failed. Combining these two flavors isn’t as easy as I thought. However, this is how experiments are. If you can succeed in one try, it can’t be called an experiment.”

Zhou Wen saw Gao Dawei’s serious expression and realized that he didn’t seem to be lying. Furthermore, there was no need to pull such a prank on them. Besides, it hadn’t been long since they entered the store. It was impossible for Gao Dawei to immediately produce such a thing to mess with them.

Zhou Wen sniffed it and looked at the puppy-shaped chocolate. He originally found the puppy rather adorable, but now, he found it odd.

Why do I feel like it’s…?Zhou Wen didn’t dare think further.

After this development, Ya’er and Sweetie’s expressions didn’t look too good. They looked at the remaining two pieces of chocolate and hesitated about eating them.

Who knew what kind of strange chocolate Gao Dawei would come up with next? The unknown evoked the most terrifying fears.

Even if one could see what was inside the chocolate, one might not know what it was and what taste it would have without eating it. Some subtle components still needed to be distinguished through tasting.

If Gao Dawei were to create some spicy mala chocolates or something even more outrageous, there might be even more terrifying outcomes.

Ya’er and Sweetie wanted to give up, but after looking at each other, they immediately raised their heads. Neither of them was willing to admit defeat.

“Well… Although it tastes awful, you still need to write down what ingredients were used in it so that I can know if you can advance to the next round,” Gao Dawei said carefully.

Ya’er and Sweetie quickly wrote down the answer. Although they only chewed it a few times and spat it out, they still wrote down the ingredients correctly. Apart from the stinky tofu, Gao Dawei had also added durian.

This fellow is really sick. It’s no wonder he said that it’s free from the onset. If he were to take money for this, he would probably be beaten to death.?Zhou Wen was rendered speechless. An ordinary chocolate chef would definitely not experiment in such a way unless they had a screw loose.

In the following competition, although Ya’er and Sweetie tried their best not to withdraw and only competed to uphold their pride, they no longer had the anticipation from before.

Eating Gao Dawei’s chocolate felt like they were heading to the execution grounds.

Fortunately, there wasn’t much of a problem with the fourth chocolate. It was a kind of chocolate with alcohol in its center. However, Gao Dawei had used a few special wines to concoct the alcohol. They had to be able to tell which wines were used.

Zhou Wen imagined that Ya’er would not answer correctly this time. Although Ya’er ate a lot of snacks, Zhou Wen never allowed her to drink. Ya’er probably couldn’t even tell the difference between red and white wine. It was indeed impossible for her to tell what wines were inside.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, not only did Sweetie answer correctly, but Ya’er also answered correctly.

Has Ya’er been drinking behind my back? Furthermore, is she an alcoholic? Otherwise, how would she know the names of the dozens of alcohols that even I haven’t heard of? She can even tell it through taste. How odd!?Zhou Wen frowned inwardly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

When it was time for the last piece of chocolate, Gao Dawei perked up. “I didn’t expect your senses to be so sharp. However, it’s impossible for you to taste what the last piece of chocolate is made of. It’s better to give up early.”

“Can we begin?” Ya’er asked expressionlessly.

Ever since she ate the puppy chocolate, she had been nasty to Gao Dawei.

Sweetie was the same. She said impatiently, “Can you hurry up?”

“No rush; we’ll start now.” Gao Dawei pointed at the last piece of chocolate and said, “This is a piece of work that I’ve been particularly proud of recently. It’s called Snow White.”

Zhou Wen took a look and saw that it was made of ordinary white chocolate. However, it was made into the appearance of a woman in a princess dress. Apart from looking good, there was nothing special about it.

Zhou Wen directly used his x-ray vision to see the inside of the white chocolate. He realized that it was still white chocolate inside. There was nothing else.

Gao Dawei cut two pieces for Ya’er and Sweetie before asking Zhou Wen, “Do you want to try it? This piece should taste the best of the five chocolates.”

“Alright.” Zhou Wen looked at Gao Dawei and nodded slightly.

Gao Dawei cut a piece and handed it to Zhou Wen on a plate. Zhou Wen picked it up and threw it into his mouth, swallowing it in one bite.

“What a waste. You should taste it properly. This taste is unique in this world. Apart from me, no one can produce chocolate with this taste,” Gao Dawei said regretfully.

“Isn’t it just an ordinary white chocolate? What’s so special about it?” Zhou Wen asked.

“You don’t know anything about chocolate. That piece of chocolate I gave you just now was akin to feeding Pigsy with ginseng fruit. It’s a waste.” Gao Dawei stood up straight and said smugly, “But there’s nothing we can do about it. It’s better than trouble.”

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen stared at Gao Dawei and asked.

Plop!

Before Gao Dawei could say anything, Sweetie fell to the ground as if she had fainted. Although she was still breathing, she was virtually motionless.

“Who are you?” Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly as he sized up Gao Dawei.

“I’m me, Gao Dawei, a saint of the Sun God Holy Temple. I originally wanted to take a break before going to Luoyang to deal with you guys. I didn’t expect you to come knocking on my door and save me a lot of trouble,” Gao Dawei answered with a smile.

“What’s up with the chocolate?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“Didn’t I tell you? That chocolate is called Snow White. Haven’t you heard of Snow White’s story? After eating my chocolate, you will fall into an eternal sleep.” Gao Dawei smiled and said, “You don’t have to force it. Although your body is much stronger than an ordinary person’s and you can stand for a while longer, you will still fall eventually. Why be in pain?”

“I’m not in any pain.” Zhou Wen outstretched his palm and the chocolate that Gao Dawei had given him was lying in his palm.
