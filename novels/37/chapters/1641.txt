Chapter 1642 Sometimes True, Sometimes Fake

Xiao wasn’t Laughing Li from back then after all. What he had learned over the years was no longer as simple as a mental state.

His person, mind, body, and abilities were much more mature than before. When he was young, he might have relied on his mutated mental state to seek out a possibility for victory, but to the present Xiao, that was no longer the case.

The Companion Beast attacked again. With the augmentation of the mental state, his speed was unbelievably fast.

And just as his fist was about to touch Xiao, Xiao took half a step back. When the Companion Beast’s fist struck Xiao’s body, it passed through him as though Xiao’s body didn’t exist. It was just an illusion.

Xiao’s figure really began to dissipate like a phantom. Almost at the same time the phantom began to dissipate, another Xiao appeared on the other side of the Companion Beast and threw a punch at the back of the Companion Beast’s head.

The Companion Beast’s reaction was extremely fast. He swung his arm and slammed his elbow into Xiao’s fist.

However, when his elbow collided with the fist, he was surprised to discover that his elbow went through Xiao’s fist. He didn’t sense any force. It was also an illusion.

Elsewhere, the phantom that should have dissipated struck the Companion Beast’s face, causing it to fall backward. “Sometimes real, sometimes fake. You learned my psyche mutation, but you didn’t learn my true thoughts. It’s just an empty shell.” Xiao, who was behind the phantom, spoke out. At the same time, he struck the Companion Beast that was leaning back and leaped up to slam his knee into its waist.

The sound of the Companion Beast’s back snapping could almost be heard. The Companion Beast that was about to snap was sent flying into the sky like a meteor.

Just as Xiao was about to chase after the Companion Beast using his Trajectory movement technique and deliver a fatal combo when he saw a golden light flash in the sky, the Companion Beast that was thrown into the air was caught by the golden light and pulled into Toad Immortal’s mouth.

Toad Immortal finally found an opportunity after watching for a long time. He wrapped his tongue around the Companion Beast and swallowed it.

“I never expected such a pleasant surprise. I actually managed to devour a Heaven-level Companion Beast so easily.” Toad Immortal was somewhat smug as he looked at Xiao and said, “Punk from the Trajectory Holy Temple, go back and tell Holy God that Toad Immortal will happily accept this Companion Beast.”

With that said, Toad Immortal ignored Xiao and turned to fly towards Zhou Wen.

After all, to him, killing Zhou Wen to retrieve the Moon Essence Basin and the Skyimmortal Swan was most pertinent. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to devour a Heaven-level Companion Beast and slowly digest its energy.

“Did I say that you can leave?” As Toad Immortal flew towards Zhou Wen, he heard Xiao’s cold voice.

“Why? Can’t you accept this?” Toad Immortal turned around and rolled his strange eyes as he looked at Xiao.

“It’s not that I can’t accept it, but I want to kill you. You shouldn’t have taken something that belongs to the Holy Temples.” As Xiao spoke, his figure flashed in front of Toad Immortal. His sharp fingers slashed at Toad Immortal’s throat. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

A golden light flashed from Toad Immortal’s mouth as his tongue wrapped around Xiao’s arm. However, he realized that it was only an illusion. As for Xiao, he had already appeared behind him. His fingers were like hooks as he grabbed at Toad Immortal’s fat head.

Toad Immortal waved his hand and the golden-robed sleeve blocked Xiao’s five fingers. However, it was only an illusion. The phantom-like Xiao continued slashing at Toad Immortal’s throat.

A golden light flashed from Toad Immortal’s mouth as he cleaved away Xiao’s arm. At the same time, he sneered and said, “Such a trick is fine against that stupid Companion Beast. You are still far from being able to injure me…”

Bang!

Before Toad Immortal could finish his sentence, he realized that the Xiao in front of him was also an illusion. A third Xiao appeared on the other side of his body and punched Toad Immortal in the face.

Toad Immortal’s face distorted as his body sank with his face. He slammed into the glacier, causing a large area to collapse.

What a powerful fellow. He’s already at the Heaven level, right? Zhou Wen frowned inwardly.

The last time he could defeat the three Saints in a one-on-three battle was because they had yet to truly advance to the Heaven level. However, from the looks of it, not only was Xiao already at the Heaven level, but his abilities and realm seemed to be much stronger than before.

How long has it been? This fellow has actually grown to such a stage. Are the Holy Land’s resources really that abundant? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

Jiuyang had already rushed out. He wasn’t in the mood to fight the dimensional creatures controlled by the Companion Beast. As he fought, he retreated. He rushed out of the planet and saw the battle between Xiao and the Companion Beast, as well as the scene of Toad Immortal being sent into the glacier.

What is this fellow up to? Jiuyang looked at Xiao, feeling increasingly puzzled.

The abilities Xiao displayed were much stronger than his normal standards. This wasn’t because his strength had increased. However, the power brought by the Holy Artifact wasn’t enough to make Xiao undergo such a huge change.

The only way possible was if Xiao already had a very high realm and ability, but if that was the case, Jiuyang found Xiao harder to figure out. He even had some doubts.

The dimensional creatures controlled by the Companion Beast rushed out and held back Jiuyang again. Jiuyang wasn’t in the mood to fight them. Although he had no choice but to deal with them, most of his attention was on Xiao.

Boom!

The glacier collapsed, forming a huge hole. A shockwave spread out from the glacier as a figure rushed out like a cannonball. It was the livid Toad Immortal.

His cheeks swelled up. Being a Heaven-level attack, the punch had not been light. Toad Immortal was also at the Heaven-level, so he wasn’t strong enough to ignore attacks of the same level.

“You’re dead.” Toad Immortal’s eyes flashed with killing intent as he stared at Xiao and enunciated each word clearly.

“You’re right. If you don’t spit out that Companion Beast, you’re indeed dead,” Xiao said indifferently.

“Don’t think that you can challenge me just because you’ve learned some tricks from the Trajectory Holy Temple. You will soon know how foolish you are.” As the toad spoke, its body emitted a golden glow. Countless square-holed coins shot out like stars. They were nailed into the nearby void, enveloping a large area into the Money Domain.
