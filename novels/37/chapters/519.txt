Chapter 520 One Takes on the Color of One“s Company

Zhou Wen walked all the way up to the mountain where Jade Rabbit’s Lunar Prayer was. Although Zero Taboo seemed to have the ability to counter White Cloud Mountain’s taboo powers, Zhou Wen still wore the balaclava and used Truth Listener’s ability to scout the way.

If he were to see the immortal palace phenomenon, it would be quite an unjust death in the event Zero Taboo failed to work.

There were indeed very few dimensional creatures on White Cloud Mountain. Zhou Wen walked all the way to the peak, but he didn’t even encounter a single one.

After reaching the top of the mountain, Zhou Wen finally saw the legendary jade rabbit’s lunar prayer stone. Perhaps it was because Zhou Wen’s imagination wasn’t good, but no matter how he looked at it, it didn’t resemble a rabbit.

The Thearch said that the item is beneath this stone, but this stone seems to be connected to the mountain? Should I dig it up? Zhou Wen circled the Moon Rabbit stone but didn’t find the good stuff that The Thearch had mentioned.

Although it wasn’t nice to destroy a natural landscape, Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered anymore. He summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon and made it push the Moon Rabbit stone to see if there was anything below.

The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon had 80 Strength after all. With the augmentation of an Essence Energy Skill, it could snap the mountain, much less a mere rock.

However, it was unable to move the Moon Rabbit stone at all despite using all its might.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised. With the strength of Six-Winged, even a piece of titanium alloy should have snapped, much less a rock.

Indeed, there’s something here! Zhou Wen made Six-Winged stop. He probably couldn’t move the Moon Rabbit stone with brute force.

Zhou Wen studied how to deal with the Moon Rabbit stone, but he failed to budge it despite exhausting all the methods he could think of. All he could do was leave White Cloud Mountain and return to the encampment. He planned on contacting The Thearch and asking her how to take the item under the Moon Rabbit Stone.

After Zhou Wen returned to the encampment, Old He warmly welcomed him back. He also told him that An Sheng and An Tianzuo had already left because they were needed in Luoyang. They had left a message, saying that if Zhou Wen wanted to return, he could get Old He to drive him back.

On the rugged mountain road, An Sheng was fiddling with his phone while driving.

To him, multitasking was not a difficult task. There was no conflict between driving and playing games. Ordinary people were forbidden from doing this as it was very easy for accidents to happen, bringing harm to themselves and others.

The scene that appeared on An Sheng’s phone screen was the game that Zhou Wen had invested in. He held the phone in one hand as his fingers moved rapidly. It was no different from how others played with two hands. He was even more agile.

The game character used all sorts of odd positioning and releasing of skills to beat the Demonized Soldiers and Generals.

"Why aren’t you driving properly? What are you doing there?" An Tianzuo, who was sitting behind with his eyes closed, suddenly asked.

"I downloaded the game that Zhou Wen and company made. Now that I’m trying it, it’s really not bad. The feedback from attacking and the usage of skills are very good. The parameters are also very similar to reality, especially those Demonized Soldiers and Generals. Their behavior and skills are identical to reality. After playing this game, if one were to encounter Demonized Soldiers and Generals, one would know how to deal with them. This game is really not bad. From the looks of it, Young Master Wen isn’t just playing games," An Sheng said as he played.

"He’s just trying to play to the gallery. Watching a video allows one to understand dimensional creatures better than gaming. It’s not like I see him doing any research. All he does is game. The so-called understanding of dimensional creatures is just an excuse to game," said An Tianzuo.

An Sheng defended Zhou Wen. "It’s still a little different. From watching the video, one can only know what kind of abilities a dimensional creature has. Ordinary people can’t tell what skills they can use to deal with it just by watching a video. However, in-game, they can attempt to use various skills to attack dimensional creatures. They can then know which skills are effective against them. Furthermore, through in-game combat, it’s easier to remember the timing of the various skills used by dimensional creatures. This game is a high-level strategy guide. It would be even better if we could turn it into a holographic game"

"I realize that ever since you and Zhou Wen went out a few times, you are getting better at clever, but false, arguments," An Tianzuo said with a cold expression.

"Overseer, you’re right. It’s my fault. Games only make people lose their aspirations. It’s useless," An Sheng hurriedly said.

"You’ve even learned how to agree overtly despite your private opposition. Indeed, one takes on the color of one’s company. Hand over the phone," An Tianzuo said coldly when he saw that An Sheng was still playing.

"I was wrong, alright?" An Sheng hurriedly put away his phone.

"I told you to hand me the phone," An Tianzuo said with a deadpan expression as he stared at An Sheng through the rearview mirror.

An Sheng helplessly handed his phone to An Tianzuo, who was sitting behind him. An Tianzuo reached out and took it. He glared at An Sheng and said, "Drive properly. If you continue with such nonsense, you’ll be punished to guard Chess Mountain."

An Sheng tersely responded and continued driving. He didn’t dare do anything else.

An Tianzuo closed his eyes to rest for a while, but he had a nagging feeling. After a while, An Tianzuo opened his eyes again and picked up the phone beside him. After unlocking it, his gaze landed on the app icon named Dimension.

The corners of An Tianzuo’s eyes twitched slightly. He reached out and pulled the curtains to give himself privacy from An Sheng. Then, he said to him, "I’ll rest for a while. Don’t disturb me."

"Got it, Overseer," An Sheng said.

An Tianzuo held his phone and turned off the sound. Then, he tapped on the icon. Soon, an ink-styled interface appeared on his phone.

...

Zhou Wen rested in the encampment. As there was a signal in the encampment, he sent a message to The Thearch, but after waiting for several hours, he still didn’t receive a reply.

Just as Zhou Wen thought that The Thearch wasn’t replying to him on purpose, he finally received a message. He opened it and saw that it was from The Thearch.

"To learn the divine art, one must self-castrate."

Zhou Wen read the message clearly and countless question marks appeared in his mind. Then, he sent a row of question marks.

"It was sent wrongly. It was for someone else. If you want the treasure, you must wait for the moon to rise." The Thearch replied very quickly this time. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

So I have to wait until the moon rises before I can obtain the treasure under the Moon Rabbit stone. Zhou Wen was enlightened, but he suddenly felt that something was amiss.

"The Thearch, you said that you sent the message wrongly. Then who were you planning on sending that sentence to?" Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd.

Since The Thearch could use her phone to go online, it was not surprising that she could add friends on the Internet. The strange thing was, why did she send such a message to the other party?

"It’s a guy who wants to learn divine arts. His name seems to be John Cape," The Thearch replied.

"John... Cape..." Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t forget this fellow. After all, it was because of Liz and John that he and the Cape family had become enemies.
