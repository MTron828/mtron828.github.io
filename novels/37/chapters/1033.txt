Chapter 1034: Space Suit

Zhou Wen, Wang Lu, and company headed for the Imperial Capital. Along the way, they encountered quite a number of break-out creatures. Unfortunately, their levels weren’t too high. Without needing him to do anything, they were easily dispatched by Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan.

The last time Zhou Wen had gone to the Imperial Capital, he was nearly killed by Xia Jiuhuang and the Guardian in the log. He had even fled from Forbidden City in a sorry state. He hadn’t even dared stay in the Imperial Capital for long as he fled back.

Now, it was different. Ignoring Demonic Neonate and the Seven Seas Dragon King, with the Terror-grade Ice Maiden around, it wouldn’t be easy for the Guardian in the log to touch him.

After Ice Maiden was restrained by the Seven Seas Dragon King, Zhou Wen used Explosive Fiend Man’s Death List to get Ice Maiden to sign her name.

Although it wasn’t easy to use Death List on the Terror-grade Ice Maiden, Zhou Wen wasn’t worried that she would go back on her word and attack him.

The sole reason was because the Heaven Shrouding Bell had been taken away by Demonic Neonate.

Zhou Wen had tried to get the Heaven Shrouding Bell back, but to his surprise, he realized that the Heaven Shrouding Bell had been devoured by Demonic Neonate just like the Demonic Sword. It became Demonic Neonate’s skill, which also meant that it was a part of her. He couldn’t retrieve it at all.

As long as Demonic Neonate shook the Heaven Shrouding Bell, no matter how ferocious Ice Maiden was, she would obediently surrender without any chance of resisting.

As for Grim Demon inside the Demonic Sword, he had actually begun evolving independently after devouring Bizarre God. Zhou Wen didn’t know what changes he would undergo after his evolution.

Logically speaking, when Demonic Neonate evolved, as a part of the Demonic Sword, Grim Demon should already have gained the ability to transform into a Terror form. Now that it had evolved alone, it was unknown what its outcome would be.

Ice Maiden didn’t wish to be trapped in the Chaos Bead, so Zhou Wen didn’t force her to enter. Since she couldn’t escape, he decided to let her move freely.

...

When he arrived at the Imperial Capital again, Zhou Wen swaggered into the city with Wang Lu without deliberately hiding his whereabouts.

“Director-General... Zhou Wen... Zhou Wen has come to the Imperial Capital...” Before Zhou Wen entered the Imperial Capital, the bureau had already been made aware.

“What’s he doing in the Imperial Capital?” Shen Yuchi felt a headache when he heard that.

In the past, he had yearned for Zhou Wen to come to the Imperial Capital so he could capture him.

But now, there was no point in capturing Zhou Wen. Even if there was meaning, how many people in the world could capture him?

Based on the information the bureau had, even a ranked Guardian might not be able to capture Zhou Wen if they wanted to. Furthermore, the bureau didn’t have such a figure.

“Pay attention to his whereabouts, but don’t follow him directly. You just need to use the surveillance equipment network on Imperial Capital Street. If he wants to leave your line of sight, there’s no need to determine his whereabouts,” Shen Yuchi said after some thought. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Not long after, the inspector ran back and said with a strange expression, “Director-General... He seems to be heading for our bureau’s headquarters...”

“Are you sure he’s coming to the bureau?” Shen Yuchi frowned.

“He’s already passed Sky Street and is heading east. If he’s heading this way, the chances of him coming to our bureau are the highest,” the inspector said.

“East of Sky Street... It looks like he really wants to come to the bureau. Is he alone? Is there anyone else with him?” Shen Yuchi asked again.

“He’s also carrying a girl who looks about two years old. Wang Lu, Feng Qiuyan, and Li Xuan, who entered the Imperial Capital with him, went to the Wang family residence. They didn’t join him,” the inspector hurriedly said.

...

Zhou Wen headed for Sky Pass. Sky Pass was a dimensional zone in the Imperial Capital, as well as the location of the bureau’s headquarters.

As Sky Pass was protected by powerful dimensional zone taboos, outsiders had no way of entering it alive. Even if the inspectors wanted to enter the Sky Pass, they needed permission from the higher-ups. They couldn’t enter freely, or they would be killed by the taboo power of the Sky Pass.

Zhou Wen arrived at a fork in the road and saw a middle-aged man passing by. He went over and asked, “Uncle, is Sky Pass ahead?”

“You want to go to Sky Pass? Do you know what kind of place it is?” The middle-aged man sized up Zhou Wen in surprise.

“I heard that it’s the bureau’s headquarters. I want to buy something there,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Buy something from the bureau’s headquarters?” The middle-aged man was even more surprised. He looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Do you know what the bureau does?”

“I’m not too sure. I heard that there are quite a number of good things there that I’d like to buy.” Zhou Wen asked again, “Do you know which way the bureau is?”

“I’m about to head to the bureau. If you want to go, come along,” the middle-aged man said with interest.

“Thank you,” Zhou Wen said gratefully.

“You’re welcome. It’s on the way. What do you want to buy from the bureau?” The middle-aged man was very curious.

The bureau’s headquarters wasn’t a good host. It was difficult to enter, but it was even harder to leave. No one would go to such a place for no reason. If it wasn’t necessary, the middle-aged man wouldn’t have gone to the bureau.

“I want to buy some space equipment,” Zhou Wen said.

The middle-aged man was even more interested when he heard that. He said to Zhou Wen, “Are you interested in space exploration?”

“I’m not too interested. I just want to go into space on a tour,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Tour?” The middle-aged man shook his head and said with grimace, “Current space technology hasn’t developed to the point where we can travel freely in space. However, as the human physique improves, what was only possible for highly-trained astronauts is now possible as long as they are at the Legendary stage even without any training. However, it would be a waste of manpower and resources just for traveling.”

“Are you an expert in this area?” Zhou Wen sized up the middle-aged man and asked.

“I can’t be considered an expert. You can call me a businessman. My company specializes in producing space suits for astronauts,” the middle-aged man said.

“Space suits? Then does your company sell equipment like space cabins that can allow ordinary people to survive in space for a period of time?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

“No, that kind of thing involves too much technology. It can’t be done. Our company’s space suits are alright. If you are interested, you can visit our company later. It’s best not to go to a place like the bureau,” the middle-aged man said.

“Uncle, how may I address you? Why are you going to the bureau?” Zhou Wen sized up the middle-aged man and asked.

The middle-aged man roughly explained his situation as they walked. His name was Tang Zhizhong. Previously, the bureau had been in a partnership with their company. The space suits used were all products customized by their company.

Over the years, their space suits had never had any problems. Their research team had also been researching and developing better and more practical space suits. They could be said to be the top space suits manufacturers in the Federation.

However, some time ago, the bureau’s partnership with them ended and they switched to using another company’s products. Even the batch of space suits they had previously ordered were rejected for various reasons.

Tang Zhizhong originally thought that there was a problem with his product, but after asking around, he realized that it wasn’t the case.
