Chapter 1454: Hair

“Sir, calm down. Tianyou and I have already made plans. We will save you,” Xiao said.

“It’s too late. As long as I leave Paramita, I will definitely die without the help of the Paramita Flowers,” Ouyang Ting said.

“Why!?” Xiao was alarmed.

“I should have died a long time ago. It was these Paramita Flowers that sustained me to this day, but at the same time, I endure indescribably inhuman pain at every moment. If I didn’t know that Little Lan and Tianzuo would definitely come for me, I wouldn’t have wanted to live any longer.” Ouyang Ting paused before continuing, “Don’t speak. Listen to me. Even if you take me back, the monsters in the Holy Temple won’t let me off. Only by handing me over to them will you have a chance to expose that matter. Anyway, I’m already a dead person. After I die, it doesn’t matter where this useless body lays. As long as you take the thing to Tianzuo, I can die in peace.”

“Sir, I’m afraid it won’t be that easy to take the thing out,” Xiao sighed softly.

“Therefore, only by giving me to Holy God will you have a chance to take the item out,” Ouyang Ting said.

“What is it?” Xiao asked.

In fact, Xiao was puzzled. The old sir had already been captured and imprisoned previously. What could he still have on him?

Not only could he not hide it on him, even if it was hidden in his flesh and blood, but it was also impossible to hide it from an existence like Holy God.

“Pull my hair,” Ouyang Ting said.

Xiao reached out to brush away his white hair, but he didn’t discover anything inside.

There was nothing that could be hidden. Even a flea or a flake of dandruff couldn’t be hidden. Perhaps it was because he was in Paramita, but other than the flowers, there wasn’t a speck of dust.

“Sir, there’s nothing,” Xiao said.

“Cut off the hair on my head,” Ouyang Ting continued.

“Is it here?” Xiao touched the white hair on Ouyang Ting’s head in puzzlement.

“It’s about there.” Ouyang Ting didn’t explain much.

Xiao used his finger as a blade and swept across the white hair. Ouyang Ting’s white hair was immediately sliced off by a finger beam.

“Eh!” Xiao realized that a strand of hair couldn’t be sliced off by his finger beam.

That strand of hair looked no different from the rest. Xiao couldn’t tell what was different. No matter how he looked at it, it was just an ordinary strand of hair. It had originally grown on Ouyang Ting’s head and definitely hadn’t been transplanted.

However, this strand of hair could actually withstand his finger beam. Clearly, it wasn’t ordinary.

Xiao suddenly understood why Holy God hadn’t discovered that there was something wrong with this strand of hair. It was because Holy God was too confident. He believed that he could see everything clearly, but he never expected Ouyang Ting’s strand of hair to be problematic.

“See that? Pull it out and store it well. Take it to Tianzuo,” Ouyang Ting said.

Xiao nodded and pulled out the white hair.

This strand of hair was extremely tenacious. When Xiao pulled it out, he pulled it up by the root. The hair follicle was pulled open and drops of red seeped out.

However, due to the effects of the flowers, the wound was quickly healed.

“Sir, is there anything else you need to tell Tianzuo?” Xiao asked again.

“Tell Tianzuo to take good care of his mother and Little Jing. I, Ouyang Ting, owe them too much in this life. If they don’t mind, I’ll be their children in my next life…” Ouyang Ting sighed.

“How is this repayment? This is a debt collection, right?” Xiao was speechless.

Ouyang Ting chuckled and said, “Regardless of whether it’s to repay a debt or to collect a debt, as long as we have this affinity, even if it’s a negative one, it’s better than being strangers.”

“Sir, don’t be so tragic. What about you? Just wait here. We’ll rescue you when we come up with a plan,” Xiao said.

Ouyang Ting shook his head. “I’ve said what needs to be said. A person who should be dead will only suffer endless pain if they continue living. Just help me take the thing to Tianzuo. Furthermore, without me as your cover, it’s impossible for you to take the strand of hair out.”

“Sir, do you have anything else to say about this strand of hair?” Xiao asked again.

“There’s no need. When that strand of hair reaches the right person, it will naturally show its use,” Ouyang Ting said.

“Alright, Sir, bear with it here. I’ll think of a way to save you soon.” Xiao put away the hair, placed Ouyang Ting down, and prepared to leave.

“No, without me, those monsters from the Holy Temple won’t let you off. You can’t escape their surveillance with the item on you,” Ouyang Ting said anxiously.

“I have my ways. Furthermore, things are ultimately worldly possessions. Even if we forgo this thing, we have to keep you alive,” Xiao said.

“No, absolutely not. That thing concerns the fate of Earth’s future—the lives of billions of people. That thing must not fall into the hands of the Holy Temple no matter what. Only by taking me back can you obtain their trust and have a chance to take my hair out. You mustn’t take the risk,” Ouyang Ting said anxiously.

Xiao looked at Ouyang Ting and was momentarily at a loss.

“Child, outsiders think that you and Tianzuo are at odds. They even suspect that Tianzuo harmed you. However, only I know that you are his best friend. Even if the entire world is against Tianzuo, you won’t be. Accept my request on behalf of Tianzuo, I beg you to take me to the Holy Temple.” Ouyang Ting’s voice was trembling.

“We aren’t friends. We are opponents.” Xiao paused before saying, “If I take you to the Holy Temple, Tianyou will probably hate me forever.”

“Then are you willing to bear this grudge?” Ouyang Ting asked.

“Sir, you are already forgoing your life. Such resentment is nothing,” Xiao said.

“Then take me back,” Ouyang Ting said firmly.

Xiao bowed three times at Ouyang Ting before lifting him up from the flowers. “Sir, let’s go.”

…

Zhou Wen had been studying the fragrance for days, hoping to mask it, but the invisible allure didn’t change much. All he could do was restrain it a little.

Now, I finally understand why it’s said that the most deceptive people are never enemies, but people who say that it’s for your own good, but do despicable things.?Zhou Wen was very depressed.

If the strange powers on him were negative, he would have eliminated them long ago. However, these strange powers, of all things, were beneficial to him, so it was very difficult to eliminate them. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Just as he was pondering over his next step, Zhou Wen suddenly winced. He used Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping’s teleportation method. The coordinates were the Companion Egg he had left with Tsukuyomi. He sensed that the Companion Egg had been injured.
