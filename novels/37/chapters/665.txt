The symphony of death and slaughter played crazily. A loud boom resounded through the sky as a three-headed, six-armed Vajra that stood more than ten meters tall charged out of Dragon Gate Grotto.

Bullets and artillery fire blasted him, but to no avail. With a wave of the monster-subduing phurba in his hand, a laser-like beam blasted a huge hole in the defensive fortification. Several soldiers died on the spot.

An Epic expert summoned his Companion Beasts to face it in battle. The Vajra fought four of them alone but managed to force all four Epic Companion Beasts into a retreat.

Boom! Boom!

Amidst the flood of stone beasts, multiple three-headed, six-armed Vajras rushed out of Dragon Gate Grotto. Groups of Fairies also flew out into the sky. They were true Fairies, not Fairy Beasts.

There were also the black-clothed, white-haired Mutated Fairies. Furthermore, there were more than two of them.

Epic officers, tutors, and people from Luoyang’s major families took part in the battle. There were war cries and explosions everywhere on the battlefield as soldiers constantly fell.

“Are you interested in warming up?” An Sheng wore a smile, but his eyes were extremely cold.

“More than happy.” Feng Qiuyan summoned his saber. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I’ve been waiting.” Li Xuan summoned out his carapace.

Zhou Wen gripped his Bamboo Blade tightly and nodded slightly. He knew that this was really just a warm-up. The truly terrifying creatures had yet to come out.

An Sheng led them to the leftmost side of the defense line. The defense there was the weakest and had been repeatedly breached by the Fairies.

“Guard this place until the retreat order is given, you can’t retreat even in death,” An Sheng said to Zhou Wen and company before leaving.

The soldiers were crazily fending off the dimensional creatures’ attacks, but there were still three-headed, six-armed Vajras charging at them. It was something ordinary soldiers couldn’t deal with. The bullets that were imbued with Essence Gold couldn’t penetrate the Vajras’ bodies, nor could they hit the Fairies.

“Leave the sky to me. I’ll leave the ground to you.” Zhou Wen looked at the Fairies in the sky as they constantly charged down to cull the soldiers’ lives.

“Alright.” Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan responded loudly at the same time before rushing out. Each of them faced a three-headed, six-armed Blackiron Vajra.

When the soldiers saw the two students rush out to fend off the Vajras, they were both surprised and delighted. They hurriedly opened fire to provide them cover, clearing the ordinary Vajras and stone beasts.

A few Fairies descended from the sky and flew over. The machine guns on the sentry post fired at them, but they failed to hit their bodies.

Zhou Wen soared into the sky as he unsheathed his Bamboo Blade and slashed out the Demonic Astral Wheel.

The blood-colored Demonic Astral Wheel flashed across the sky, killing several Fairies. Blood splattered everywhere.

The nearby soldiers were first taken aback before they cheered. At the very least, they saw a temporary hope. There were still humans who could fight these terrifying dimensional creatures.

Gunfire, the roars of dimensional creatures, the roars of Companion Beasts, the screams of death—the collision of blood and fire were everywhere.

Zhou Wen kept killing Fairies. He lost count of the number he killed, but he was already beginning to feel numb. He usually couldn’t find so many Fairies, but now, there were as many as crows in the sky.

Zhou Wen even killed two Mutated Fairies.

Feng Qiuyan, Li Xuan, and company were already covered in blood. It was impossible to distinguish the blood on their bodies—theirs or the dimensional creatures’.

Boom! Boom!

In the direction of Dragon Gate Grotto, it was as though a mountain had exploded. A thousand-hand Buddha that was more than ten meters tall on the stone wall emitted a resplendent golden glow. It came to life and walked out of the mountain wall.

The thousand-hand Buddha looked extremely strange. Zhou Wen had never seen it before.

His body was shimmering with golden light. He had an ox head and a human body. He had eight arms and countless arms that resembled wheels on his back. He looked extremely demonic.

An Epic Companion Beast went forward to fight it off, only to see the thousand-handed, bull-headed beast shoot out a golden beam of light that blasted the Epic Companion Beast to pieces.

Then, the arms behind its back raised up and transformed into different spells. Golden light crisscrossed and instantly killed the nearby Companion Beasts and humans.

Mythical creature! Zhou Wen’s eyes narrowed. A Mythical creature had appeared so quickly, and one that was especially terrifying.

The dense bombardment of bullets and attacks struck the thousand-handed, bull-headed beast, but they were nothing but a tickle. They failed to hurt it at all.

It even blocked an Epic Companion Beast’s attack. As the thousand hands changed in form, the ground was sliced apart by the crisscrossing golden light. Amidst the golden light, a tank was sliced into two like paper.

Instantly, everyone was horrified. Such an invincible dimensional creature made it impossible for anyone to think of putting up a resistance.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to summon the Golden Overlord Sword to slay the thousand-handed, bull-headed beast, he saw a figure tear through the air. It was a flying sword that resembled a blue rainbow.

The flying sword circled the creature as it attempted to grab it with its thousand hands. However, it failed. Instead, the sword beam slashed out by the flying sword cleaved down on its numerous arms.

Zhou Wen turned his head to look at the spot where the flying sword had come from and saw a figure standing on the roof. It was none other than Sunset College’s chancellor, Leng Zongzheng.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but have a thought when he saw that the flying sword didn’t manage to slice through the thousand-handed, bull-headed creature despite having the advantage. He summoned the Golden Overlord Sword and sneaked behind the creature.

Taking advantage of the fact that it was attracted by the flying sword, he leaped above its head. The Golden Overlord Sword slashed down at the ox head with a resplendent sword beam.

Boom!

The thousand-handed, bull-headed creature collapsed to the ground. At the same time it died, the stone beasts, Fairies, and Vajras attacked even more crazily.

Leng Zongzheng glanced at Zhou Wen and summoned his sword back before turning to sit on a chair. He had no intention of coming down to clean up the battlefield.

Zhou Wen naturally didn’t stand on ceremony. He went to the thousand-handed, bull-headed creature’s corpse to see if it had left anything good.

However, before he could reach the corpse, its body exploded. A terrifying blast instantly rushed towards Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon to block him. The Six-Winged Guardian Dragon roared as it spewed out dragon breath to block the terrifying blast.

And at the spot where the thousand-handed, bull-headed corpse was, a huge golden bull appeared. Its golden eyes were staring straight at him, and golden flames spewed out from its nostrils.
