Chapter 910: Blue Sky Crystal Beast

Zhou Wen looked around and didn’t find the break-out creature. There was only one egg in the crystal cave.

“How regretful. If I had known, I would have come alone to take the egg for myself. The value of this Mythical egg far exceeds the Fiend Dust,” Bida said regretfully.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he walked towards the egg. As the dimensional creature inside hadn’t been born, it wasn’t dangerous.

He walked to the crystalline egg and reached out to lift it up.

This egg was much heavier than a rock. Although it wasn’t big, its weight was a little terrifying. If Zhou Wen wasn’t strong enough, he probably wouldn’t be able to lift it with one hand.

At the instant Zhou Wen touched the egg, he suddenly saw a spatial ripple appear beside him. It was a sign of a long-distance spatial teleportation.

Then, Zhou Wen saw a dimensional creature that resembled a Qilin rush out of the spatial ripples. Its glass-like body shimmered with resplendent light as it roared and pounced at Zhou Wen, its claws having the power to tear through the void. Before it reached Zhou Wen, the void in front of him had already cracked.

Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he stuffed the egg into the Chaos Bead. At the same time, he quickly dodged the break-out creature’s attack.

Almost at the same time, Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and blocked the break-out creature that continued charging at him.

Boom!

Tyrant Behemoth collided with the break-out creature’s force, producing a terrifying force that blasted the crystal cave apart. Immediately, large amounts of seawater poured down from above. This cave was actually underwater.

As for the people on the island, they suddenly heard a thunderclap-like rumble. Then, they saw an explosion in the seawater not far from the island. The water pillar rose dozens of meters and they immediately knew that something had happened.

Just as they were observing, they saw someone rush out of the water. First, it was Zhou Wen who was hugging Ya’er, followed by Tyrant Behemoth and the break-out creature.

The break-out creature pounced at Zhou Wen crazily. Tyrant Behemoth immediately brandished its fist to stop it, but before Tyrant Behemoth’s strength touched the break-out creature, it suddenly vanished and appeared above Zhou Wen’s head. Its sharp claws were about to touch Zhou Wen’s scalp.

Zhou Wen instantly vanished, causing the break-out creature’s attack to miss.

Tyrant Behemoth chased after the break-out creature, but unfortunately, before it could catch up to it, the break-out creature had already teleported away and caught up to Zhou Wen who had just appeared from his teleportation.

If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s excellent movement techniques and fast reflexes, he would have been torn into two the moment he appeared again.

Zhou Wen was wearing Dragon Scale Armor as he grabbed the middle of the Golden Battle God Halberd with one hand, blocking the terrifying claw.

Crack!

The Golden Battle God Halberd was sliced into several pieces by the claw. Although Zhou Wen took the opportunity to dodge the strike, it was hopeless for the Golden Battle God Halberd.

It wasn’t easy for another Golden Battle God Halberd to drop, but it’s gone just like that. Zhou Wen felt his heart ache. In the past, he had disparaged the fact that the Golden Battle God Halberd dropped way too often, but now, he realized that it wasn’t enough.

The terrifying offensive strength of the break-out creature left Zhou Wen alarmed. If he wasn’t wrong, this fellow was likely proficient in spatial slicing skills. Typical Mythical weapons found it difficult to withstand spatial slicing. Otherwise, the Golden Battle God Halberd wouldn’t have been destroyed so easily.

I have to think of a way to get a weapon that’s indestructible in the future. Otherwise, there’s no way to guarantee that the weapon won’t be destroyed when facing some terrifying skills, Zhou Wen thought.

Zhou Wen dodged a few more attacks and didn’t dare clash head-on with the break-out creature.

“Zhou Wen, if you can’t do it, move aside.” Zhang Xiao had already led the White Crane team over. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“That’s what I was thinking. I’ll leave this fellow to you.” Zhou Wen’s figure flashed as he rushed to the back of the White Crane team.

Under Zhang Xiao’s command, the many Zhang family members on the white cranes struck out spirit talismans at the same time. There were many of them, instantly enveloping a large area of the sky and the break-out creature was caught in the middle.

Mysterious rays of light emitted from the spirit talismans. The rays intertwined and turned into a spirit energy net that trapped the break-out creature.

The break-out creature charged at the spirit energy net, but it failed to tear it apart. Instead, the spirit talismans stuck to its body, and the spirit energy net also bound its body.

When the break-out creature teleported, it couldn’t escape the spirit energy net. It could only teleport within the confines of the spirit energy net; it was ultimately trapped within when it appeared again.

Under Zhang Xiao’s lead, the members of the White Crane team circulated their Essence Energy Arts, causing the spiritual light on the spirit talismans to become stronger and stronger. The break-out creature seemed to be in extreme pain as it roared and attempted to tear open the spirit energy net, but to no avail.

The spirit energy net didn’t look like a real net. Instead, it appeared on the break-out creature like a tattoo. No matter how the break-out creature struggled, it was unable to escape.

“The Zhang family sure is impressive. That Essence Energy Art can actually combine different people’s Essence Energy Skills into one. It’s rather magical.” Zhou Wen felt like his horizons had been broadened. He had never seen such an Essence Energy Art or Essence Energy Skill before.

Zhang Xiao said coldly, “Don’t be ridiculous. How can you know everything of the Zhang family’s heritage?”

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he watched the Zhang family fight the break-out creature.

The Xia family and the other freelance hunters came over as well. However, now that the Zhang family was fighting the break-out creature, it wasn’t appropriate for them to interfere.

Offending the Zhang family for a break-out creature and Fiend Dust was not worth it to most people.

However, not everyone had the same mindset. If the Zhang family couldn’t deal with the break-out creature and even ended up with an internecine outcome, they would be able to scoop up the benefits.

While everyone was watching the battle, someone arrived at the volcanic crater. He lowered his head and looked inside before carefully climbing down.

This person quickly arrived at the magma pool inside the volcano. It was none other than Bida, who had led Zhou Wen to seek out the break-out creature.

“Those idiots, let them risk their lives. Without them holding back the Blue Sky Crystal Beast, I won’t be able to obtain what’s down there.” Bida looked at the magma and summoned a Companion Beast. It was a Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle.

The Black Iron Gold Thread Turtle transformed into a full-body armor that enveloped Bida completely. Not a single part of him was exposed. Then, he walked towards the magma pool, looking like he wanted to dive into it.

“According to our agreement, everything except 30% of the Fiend Dust will belong to me. Don’t tell me you want to secretly take some treasure behind my back?” Just as Bida stepped into the magma pool, he suddenly heard a voice. His body trembled as he turned his head in surprise. Indeed, he saw Zhou Wen standing not far behind him.
