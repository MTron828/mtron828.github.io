Chapter 1474 Reality

“Preposterous!” An Tianzuo slammed his palm on the desk, nearly smashing it to pieces. It was obvious that he was in a bad mood.

“It’s not a bad thing for Young Master Wen to stay in Guide City. It has plenty of dimensional zones and resources. It will definitely be an important place for all parties to vie for in the future. If Young Master Wen can successfully gain a foothold there, the benefits he will receive in the future will be hundreds of times greater,” An Sheng explained on the phone. “Who doesn’t know that Guide City will definitely become one of the most important places in the world in the future? But look at the six families. Who dares to occupy it? Without the corresponding strength, entering too early will only make them cannon fodder for the other factions,” An Tianzuo said coldly.

“Young Master Wen isn’t an ordinary person. His strength isn’t something the six families can compare with. Perhaps he can gain control of Guide City ahead of time.” An Sheng continued speaking up for Zhou Wen.

“No matter how strong a person is, he’s only one person. What’s the point of him staying there alone?” An Tianzuo thought nothing of An Sheng’s words. “Yu Qiubai has the intention of staying in Guide City. He’s lobbying the other teachers and locals to stay behind. If it really succeeds, it will be a good starting point. There will be a chance for development in the future.” An Sheng reported the situation in Guide City to An Tianzuo in detail.

An Tianzuo snorted coldly. “You don’t need to wait for the outcome to know that it’s impossible. 99% of people won’t choose to stay in Guide City.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

An Tianzuo said it with certainty, sounding very confident.

An Sheng naturally knew that the success rate of this matter was very low. It was useless even with Zhou Wen’s reputation. Most people would still choose to move to Luoyang. It wasn’t that people didn’t have confidence in Zhou Wen’s strength, but everyone knew very well that no matter how strong Zhou Wen was, it was impossible for him to stay in the city 24/7 to protect them.

The average person needed a stable and orderly society. This was something Zhou Wen couldn’t provide to them now, but Luoyang had everything Even if An Tianzuo wasn’t in Luoyang, Luoyang still had the strength to withstand a large-scale attack from the dimensional creatures. There was a comprehensive city defense system, the famous Sunset Army of the Federation, and many famous experts in the Federation.

Luoyang was basically safe as long as the Sunset Army didn’t fall.

Humans were selfish. No one was willing to bet their lives, so An Tianzuo and An Sheng knew very well that most people wouldn’t stay in Guide City.

The reality was as they imagined. Things didn’t go well when Yu Qiubai went to discuss with the teachers. Although most of the teachers respected him, they still tactfully rejected him.

Even the school management who had a good relationship with Yu Qiubai privately persuaded him not to risk his life and said that he should join everyone in Luoyang for future development.

If even the teachers acted this way, it was even more impossible for the people from Guide City who didn’t have a good relationship with Yu Qiubai to stay.

Most people had already registered with the Sunset Army and were waiting to migrate to Luoyang. Yu Qiubai was very anxious, but there was nothing he could do. The situation in Guide City was indeed wanting. Furthermore, they had yet to confirm if they could build a human city in Sovereign Sui’s Tomb, so they were unable to use it as a bargaining chip.

This was within Zhou Wen’s expectations, but he never expected the results to be so tragic. Up to now, there were only a handful of people who were willing to stay. Humans are indeed pragmatic. Zhou Wen originally imagined that with Yu Qiubai’s reputation, he would be able to retain a few hundred people. He never expected there to be so few.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t take it to heart. Although he really needed people, it wasn’t unacceptable if there weren’t any. As long as he could establish the city, he still had a chance of attracting other humans to join in the future.

However, if there was no one in the early stages, it would indeed be more difficult, making many things inconvenient. No matter how strong Zhou Wen was, he wasn’t omnipotent. Some things needed professionals, and those professionals were what Zhou Wen wanted the most.

For example, for the construction of buildings, Zhou Wen could build a wooden hut or stone building, but the dense buildings with well-planned layouts weren’t something Zhou Wen could do.

An Sheng already knew the outcome of this matter from the applications the Sunset Army received, but he had no solution.

It wasn’t just An Sheng. The various factions in Guide City had long known about this matter. “Zhou Wen sure has wild ideas to dare think of establishing a human city in Guide City.” Xia Liuchuan couldn’t help but laugh when he heard the news.

Xia Xuanyue pondered for a moment before saying, “I wonder if this is An Tianzuo’s idea. If it’s his idea, he has really taken a terrible step. Guide City is great, and the surroundings are like a breeding ground for myths and legends. Although there aren’t any clear pantheons, what’s available to them is in no way inferior to Jerusalem in terms of dimensional zone resources. They are even more terrifying in certain aspects. However, the overall strength of humanity isn’t enough to establish a human city in such a place. If we were to interfere too early, we would only become the target of public criticism. The An family has already done their best to defend Luoyang. If they still wish to interfere with Guide City, they will probably suffer a double loss.”

Xia Liuchuan said, “With my understanding of An Tianzuo, he definitely wouldn’t do such a thing. Furthermore, Zhou Wen comes from Guide City. This matter is probably his idea.” “Although Zhou Wen is strong, establishing a city isn’t something a single person can do. I wonder what he plans on doing.” Xia Xuanyue sighed. Xia Liuchuan suddenly stopped smiling and said to Xia Xuanyue, “Zhou Wen must be lacking manpower now. Are you interested in having a vacation over there?”

“What do you mean?” Xia Xuanyue knew that it wasn’t as simple as sending her on a vacation.

“No one wants Guide City now, but people will be vying for it in the future. If that kid, Zhou Wen, really occupies it, we might be able to reap immense benefits by helping him when he’s most in need. It doesn’t cost us much after all. Just treat it as an investment,” Xia Liuchuan said.

“I’ll pay a visit then.” Xia Xuanyue thought for a moment and nodded.

An Sheng was thinking of a way to help Zhou Wen retain some people. Otherwise, it would be too difficult for him. However, no matter how much he racked his brains, there was no good solution.

It was not like he could force the unwilling to stay at gunpoint.

“You’re so mean… You’re so mean… You’re so mean…” An Sheng heard a ringtone and knew that it was from An Tianzuo. He hurriedly answered the call.

“Overseer, what are your orders?” An Sheng asked.

An Tianzuo’s voice didn’t have any emotion as he said indifferently, “Recently, an unknown break-out creature appeared around Luoyang. We are suffering from a shortage of manpower. Quickly return with the troops to provide support.”

“All of them?” An Sheng asked.

“Do you still want to leave some of them there?” An Tianzuo grunted coldly.

“Then what about Guide City? There are still many people who haven’t registered. Furthermore, it’s impossible to take all of them away at once. Even if we split them into batches, it will probably require dozens of batches for the evacuation…” An Sheng felt that there was a problem.

They couldn’t take so many people with them. Those who couldn’t leave would probably find it difficult to survive. After all, there were still skeleton creatures constantly charging out of Ancient City.

Now, it was all thanks to their suppression that such a situation could be maintained.

“At this point in time, are those people or Luoyang’s safety more important?” An Tianzuo said angrily.

An Sheng seemed to understand something as he carefully asked, “Overseer, are you implying?”

“Isn’t it obvious enough? Don’t bring any of them. Return as quickly as possible. If anything happens to Luoyang, I’ll behead you,” An Tianzuo said coldly.

“Got it. I’ll send the troops back now. I won’t take anyone with me and leave them in Guide City.” An Sheng’s expression was odd as he thought to himself, Overseer is really ruthless! There’s still much to learn.
