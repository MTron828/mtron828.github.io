Chapter 997: The Maze of Lies

Lance and Sadie gave the answer A, clearly telling Zhou Wen that there was no need to have any qualms.

Since they didn’t mind, Zhou Wen didn’t need to have any qualms. This Joseph was irritating. Furthermore, he could also eliminate a Guardian in passing. There was no reason for him to let him off.

After receiving the answer, Zhou Wen looked at Li Benyi and asked, “Are you willing to let me fight him on your behalf?”

“Of course I’m willing. Please let him know that a Guardian is nothing impressive,” Li Benyi said excitedly. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Didn’t you want to challenge me? You can do it now,” Zhou Wen said to Joseph.

“You sure are confident to think nothing of Guardians.” Joseph curled his lips in disdain before asking Li Benyu, “Uncle, can he represent you? If he loses, will you really lend me the Mythical Companion Egg?”

Li Benyu was somewhat hesitant, but Li Benyi said to him, “Dad, please agree. Zhou Wen has the strongest Tai Sui and Tyrant Behemoth. He won’t lose. Please, Dad.”

Li Benyu patted Li Benyi’s head. “Alright, I agree.”

Li Benyu didn’t have as much confidence in Zhou Wen as Li Benyi did. However, no matter how precious a Mythical Companion Egg was, it ultimately belonged to Li Benyi in the future. There were some things that he should experience.

It was naturally best if Zhou Wen could win, but even if he lost, he could teach Li Benyi a deep lesson that he would never forget.

Although he might lose a Mythical Companion Egg, Li Benyu believed that it wasn’t an unacceptable price.

If Zhou Wen knew that Li Benyu was thinking this way, he would probably sigh. The son of a rich family was really blessed.

“Uncle, it’s not that I don’t believe you, but there are some things that need to be made black and white or it might hurt our family’s feelings when the time comes,” said Joseph.

Li Benyu frowned, but before he could say anything, Zhou Wen continued, “Yes, we should make a contract. Both parties are responsible for any losses incurred during the duel. It will save us trouble.”

“Yes, in case Joseph cries from the beating and goes to the family head to complain again,” Li Benyi said.

“Also, if I lose, you can take the Companion Egg. What if you lose?” Zhou Wen asked Li Benyi.

“I won’t mention borrowing the Companion Egg again in the future,” said Joseph without blushing.

Zhou Wen was about to say something when Li Benyu shook his head and said, “Forget it. It’s fine as long as there’s no trouble in the future.”

Zhou Wen felt that Li Benyu had his own considerations. If he were to take something from Joseph now, it would only spell trouble if he continued to pester them in the future.

Since Li Benyu had already said so, Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else. Joseph quickly came up with two contracts. After Zhou Wen and company saw that there was no problem, they signed and thumb-printed the contract.

“Since it’s a fair duel, let’s fight in the family’s arena tomorrow. It will also let everyone know that the era of Guardians has arrived,” Joseph said arrogantly after putting away the contract.

Before the Guardians appeared, Zhou Wen could be said to be the top representative of the younger generation. He had powerful Companion Beasts and excellent talent.

Everyone in the Federation’s six families knew Zhou Wen’s name. Even the older generation feared him.

He wanted to fight Zhou Wen not only because of the Mythical Companion Egg, but also because he wanted to tell everyone that he, Joseph, was a true genius, a person recognized by God. The so-called geniuses in the past were just humans blowing their own trumpets. They had never obtained the recognition of God.

Therefore, he chose to fight in the family’s arena. Furthermore, he wanted to wait until tomorrow to let everyone in the Ultimate Family Clan know of this matter. At the same time, he could personally defeat Zhou Wen in front of his family’s elders and peers.

He had absolute confidence in Guardians, believing that only a Guardian could defeat another Guardian.

Zhou Wen felt that it didn’t matter and agreed. Joseph then left in excitement. It was easy to imagine that he would quickly inform everyone he knew to watch the battle tomorrow.

In fact, even if Joseph didn’t publicize it, Frost City was only small. There were no secrets that could be hidden. Soon, everyone would know.

“Zhou Wen, do you need our help to prepare anything?” Li Benyi felt that Zhou Wen was helping him in battle and that he should do something.

“If possible, take us to the nearby dimensional zones to take a look. We just came to Frost City and are very interested in the dimensional zones here,” Zhou Wen said.

“Don’t you need to prepare for tomorrow’s battle?” Li Benyi asked.

“I’m already prepared. There’s no need to make any last-minute preparations,” Zhou Wen said.

“That’s right. With Tai Sui and Tyrant Behemoth around, you can definitely defeat Joseph’s Guardian. I’m really looking forward to tomorrow’s battle.” Li Benyi wore a look of anticipation.

Under the lead of the Li father-and-son duo, Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, Feng Qiuyan, and Ya’er went to a few more famous dimensional zones.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen didn’t discover the tiny palm symbol in the first few dimensional zones. When he arrived at the Maze of Lies, he chanced upon a tiny palm symbol.

“Is this the dimensional zone where Joseph obtained the Guardian?” Li Xuan asked curiously.

“That’s right. The Maze of Lies is very special. You mustn’t tell the truth after entering. For example, if you say your name, it will be the truth. You will be killed by the taboo inside...” Li Benyi explained the situation inside the Maze of Lies.

Zhou Wen took out his phone and casually took a picture of the tiny palm symbol. Soon, the Maze of Lies dungeon was downloaded.

According to the Li father-and-son duo, the Maze of Lies was rather dangerous. Apart from the taboo of not being able to speak the truth, the dimensional creatures inside had very strange powers.

For example, there was a Mischief Clown that would hide in the maze and call your name out of the blue. If you answered, it was equivalent to telling the truth. You would be killed by the taboo in the Maze of Lies.

Apart from using the taboo power, the Mischief Clown also had some strange skills. For example, he had an elastic ball that would cause the body to bounce uncontrollably if it was hit by it, making it difficult to dodge its attack.

There were many strange dimensional creatures inside. According to the legends here, the dimensional zone, Maze of Lies, was likely owned by a very famous deity. It was the legendary God of Mischief and Lies, Loki.

Legend has it that in the deepest part of the Maze of Lies, there was a magical mask of mischief. One would gain Loki’s divine powers from wearing the mask.

Of course, that was only a legend. No one had really seen the mask.
