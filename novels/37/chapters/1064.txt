Chapter 1065: Elixir of Immortality

Translator: CKtalon

“I don’t know,” Zhou Wen said, but he thought to himself, It’s not like we’re friends. Who knows what his Companion Beast is?

“Have you heard of the story of Chang’e’s ascension to the Moon?” the Moon Goddess asked again.

“I’ve heard of this before. Legend has it that Chang’e secretly ate the Elixir of Immortality that belonged to her husband, Hou Yi, who obtained it from the Queen Mother of the West. Then, she ascended to the Moon and became an immortal fairy...” Zhou Wen had naturally heard of this story. As it was so famous, it was difficult for him not to know it.

Moon Goddess continued, “Then do you know why Chang’e ascended to the Moon after secretly eating the Elixir of Immortality and not anywhere else?”

How would I know... Wait... Elixir of Immortality... Tree of Immortality... Could it be... Zhou Wen suddenly thought of a possibility.

“You aren’t that stupid. That’s right. The Elixir of Immortality is made from the materials from the Tree of Immortality. Chang’e secretly ate the Elixir of Immortality and was pulled to the Moon by the Tree of Immortality.”

Moon Goddess paused for a moment before continuing, “As for the Tree of Immortality, it’s the foundation of the Moon. The Companion Beast is also inside. If the logger fells the Tree of Immortality, the Moon will crumble as well. When that happens, not only will my temple be affected, but even Earth will be affected. You can decide if you want to go or not.”

“I do want to help, but I’m afraid that if I’m not strong enough, I won’t be able to provide any help. Instead, I’ll only be a burden.” Zhou Wen watched as the splendid showcase of ice and fire powers unfolded before him. He couldn’t even see a figure. It would be no different from courting death if he went.

“That dimensional Terror creature has the same attributes as the Moon Palace. Since you can control her, just let her help Chang’e. With her help, Chang’e should be able to last a little longer,” Moon Goddess said.

“Just a little longer?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled. If that was the case, it didn’t seem to be of much use.

“The logger is an existence that can chop down the Tree of Immortality. It’s not something an ordinary Terror-grade creature can compare with. Getting her to help Chang’e only serves as a delay. Use this time to retrieve something. With that item, you can defeat the logger and stop him from cutting down the Tree of Immortality and save the Moon from danger,” Moon Goddess explained.

“What is it? It can actually defeat the logger?” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred. If there was really such a treasure, it was worth a try.

“The Elixir of Immortality.” Moon Goddess’s answer alarmed Zhou Wen.

“Didn’t Chang’e secretly eat the Elixir of Immortality? Does it still exist? What effects does it have? How do I use it after I get it back?” Zhou Wen asked several questions in a row.

Although Chang’e’s actions were culpable, the Elixir of Immortality was just too magical. A mortal could actually ascend in broad daylight after consuming it. Although it was only a legend, no matter how weak the effects were, he should be able to advance to the Mythical stage after eating it, right?

“The medicinal effects of the Elixir of Immortality can allow a person to possess powerful and immense strength for a short period of time. If you take the Elixir of Immortality to Chang’e, she will naturally have the ability to defeat the logger. Of course, you can also eat it yourself and fight the logger yourself. That’s up to you,” Moon Goddess said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Is it just a temporary increase in combat strength?” Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed when he heard that.

“Not entirely. Although the medicinal essence can’t be maintained forever, the burst of improvement will also allow your body to obtain permanent benefits. With your body, this little benefit is enough to help you break through to the Mythical stage that is unreachable by humans,” Moon Goddess said.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed, but on second thought, if he could easily obtain something as good as the Elixir of Immortality, why didn’t she get Shen Yuchi and company to go? Why did she choose him?

“The Elixir of Immortality is precious. There must be a terrifying creature protecting it, right?” Zhou Wen asked carefully, afraid that he would infuriate the Moon Goddess.

“Of course there’s protection, but you don’t have to worry about that. If you take my token over, it will naturally view you in a different light and won’t make things too difficult for you.” Moon Goddess paused before saying, “Now that the Moon is in danger, this is your last chance. If I wasn’t confident, I wouldn’t be sending you.”

Zhou Wen felt that it made sense. Once the Moon was destroyed, this Moon Goddess probably couldn’t even protect her temple. She definitely wouldn’t do anything rash.

“Alright, I’ll make a trip. Where can I get the Elixir of Immortality?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that this matter was beneficial to him.

If he could obtain the Elixir of Immortality, he could use it to advance to the Mythical stage without wasting any time advancing Glimmer.

This was because even if the Glimmer Life Soul advanced to a Perfect Body, it was unknown if it could push him to the Mythical stage. After all, everything was just his speculation.

The Elixir of Immortality was much more reliable. With Chang’e being a precedent, he could obtain some benefits no matter what.

If there was really danger, he could use the Glimmer Life Soul to directly teleport back to Earth. There wouldn’t be too much of a risk. He could also test if that made Glimmer advance to a Perfect Body.

“Walk west from here. After passing through the osmanthus forest, you will see a medicine mortar. The Elixir of Immortality is inside...” said Moon Goddess.

After telling Zhou Wen the detailed steps, Moon Goddess dispelled the ice from Ice Maiden’s body and allowed her to regain her freedom.

When Ice Maiden came to life, she looked into the Moon Goddess Temple in horror. Clearly, she was somewhat afraid.

“Ice Maiden, help Chang’e fight the logger. Try your best to stall for time. I’ll come back to help you after retrieving the Elixir of Immortality.” Zhou Wen explained the general situation to her and got her to help Chang’e while he headed west to retrieve the Elixir of Immortality as instructed by Moon Goddess.

The osmanthus forest was beautiful, but the Moon Goddess told him that these osmanthus trees were not Trees of Immortality. There were a total of two Trees of Immortality on the Moon, one growing on the surface of the Moon—the one at the entrance to Toad Palace.

However, that Tree of Immortality had already been felled, leaving only a stump.

There was also the huge osmanthus tree in Toad Palace. It was the foundation of Toad Palace. Once it was destroyed, the Moon would collapse. It couldn’t be lost.

Zhou Wen reached out to pluck some petals and tested them with his Companion Beasts. Indeed, these petals didn’t have the effect of evolving Companion Beasts.

Just as the Moon Goddess had said, there were no other dimensional creatures in Toad Palace. He didn’t encounter any danger along the way and passed through the osmanthus forest smoothly.

When Zhou Wen rode the Great Might Vajra Bull through the osmanthus forest, his download was finally completed. A moon icon appeared on the phone’s homescreen.

However, the name of the dungeon wasn’t Moon Palace, but the name ‘Toad Palace.’

Moon Palace sounds better. Toad Palace keeps reminding me of that toad. A place like the moon should have some beautiful legends. When I return with the Elixir of Immortality, I’ll go and see how beautiful Chang’e is. Zhou Wen was very curious about the beauty of this fairy who was known for her beauty.
