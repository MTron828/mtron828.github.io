Chapter 1097: Little Fairy Appears

Translator: CKtalon

“Ah!” Li Xuan let out a tragic cry as he held his swollen face. His fingers trembled as he pointed at Feng Qiuyan and jumped. “Why did you use so much strength?”

“How can you be sure if you aren’t dreaming if I don’t use more strength?” Feng Qiuyan muttered to himself, “Seeing how much pain you are in, you should be able to confirm that you aren’t dreaming.”

“But you don’t have to use so much strength, right? Do you want to pinch me to death? If it wasn’t for my extraordinary physique, my face would have been flattened by you,” Li Xuan said unrelentingly.

“Others will die when facing such strength, but you won’t,” Feng Qiuyan said calmly.

Li Xuan opened his mouth and realized that he had no means to refute him. He swallowed his words.

However, Li Xuan was certain that this wasn’t a dream. Darkness Domain Devil continued kneeling there with its head bowed at Zhou Wen.

Due to the deaths of Zhou Ming and Darkness Emissary, the Door of Darkness dissipated at the same time. Darkness Domain Devil lost the protection of this layer of connection and was immediately repelled by Earth’s laws. The Darkness aura on its body was rapidly dissipating.

As Darkness Domain Devil fought the terrifying nomological force, it bowed three times respectfully in Zhou Wen’s direction. Without a word, it turned around and admitted defeat before leaving the arena and returning to the dimension.

Although Darkness Domain Devil didn’t say a word, anyone could tell that he had simply treated Zhou Wen as a god.

Previously, Grim Demon had only genuflected. Now, the powerful dimensional creature, Darkness Domain Devil, had bowed so respectfully. It was truly unbelievable.

“What’s going on? Is Human actually a powerful creature from the dimension in disguise?”

“He can’t be human, right?”

“I don’t think so...”

People began to wonder if Human was human, but only humans could use Companion Beasts. This also meant that Human was human—or at least half-human.

However, how could a human have such glory? He had actually made Darkness Domain Devil bow to him. It was a terrifying existence that could instantly kill a Guardian at a glance, but in front of Zhou Wen, it was like a slave and had treated Zhou Wen like a god. It was unbelievable that he was really a human.

As a result, many Guardians who originally wanted to issue a challenge hesitated.

Darkness Domain Devil was clearly at the Terror grade and sent by the dimension. It had extremely terrifying strength. Yet, such an existence was so subservient in front of this fellow who claimed to be Human. They were really afraid.

Ignoring the human contractor, even the Guardian itself was afraid. Even though the dimensional bigwigs kept urging Guardians to enter the arena, none of them dared to do so.

Time ticked by. If no one challenged him in an hour, Human would obtain first place on the rankings.

After a few minutes of silence, someone finally issued a challenge. The challenger was Cave Era.

Cave Era was a Terror-grade Guardian with the power of time. After entering the arena, she immediately turned into her Terror form and vanished from everyone’s eyes.

Others couldn’t see her, but Zhou Wen could see her very clearly. Her Terror form couldn’t escape his eyes, but after Cave Era entered her Terror form, her body obtained the augmentation of time power. Under the acceleration of time, her movement technique was unbelievably fast.

Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to summon Banana Fairy. The fairy-like Banana Fairy appeared in front of Zhou Wen.

Her elegant and beautiful appearance immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

Banana Fairy pouted her red lips and blew out a breath. A cold wind instantly rose over the arena and swept towards the Terror-form of Cave Era.

Cave Era summoned a triangular blade transformed from a Companion Beast and charged at the cold wind with a cold beam.

The cold beam pierced through the cold wind, but it only moved half a foot forward. As for Cave Era’s body, it was sent flying by the cold wind. She was kicked out of her Terror state in midair and instantly flew for an unknown distance. She vanished from the screen, her whereabouts unknown.

“Is... Is that a Companion Beast?”

“Heavens, that Companion Beast is too terrifying. She blew away the Terror-grade Cave Era with a single breath. It’s no wonder Grim Demon and Darkness Domain Devil are so fearful of Human. Such a powerful Companion Beast is practically invincible.”

“Isn’t this too fake? The Terror-grade Cave Era was blown away just like that.”

“What’s the use of being strong? Looks are what matters. Just look at how beautiful that Companion Beast is and you’ll know that she’s definitely invincible. If she were to wheedle at me, I would definitely die of joy.”

“A beautiful humanoid Companion Beast that’s so terrifyingly powerful. How much did that brother suffer in his previous life to exchange for such a Companion Beast in this life?”

Everyone was alarmed by Banana Fairy’s strength and beauty. They explained away the respect Grim Demon and Darkness Domain Devil showed by her existence.

It wasn’t their fault for thinking that way. The battle Banana Fairy had displayed was just too shocking. A small gust of wind blew the Terror-grade powerhouse away. She looked way overpowered.

However, they didn’t know that Banana Fairy only had a few moves. Apart from blowing wind, she didn’t do anything else.

Zhou Wen watched as Cave Era was blown away by the Supreme Yin Wind. Her body was almost frozen into ice in midair. He felt that she was doomed. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, in the next second, a figure flashed. Cave Era strangely returned to the arena and appeared where she had been standing as though she had never moved.

Zhou Wen sized up Cave Era in surprise and asked, “Time reversal?”

“I don’t have such powerful strength to reverse time. Not to mention reversing time, I can’t even stop time. Otherwise, you and Ya would have died long ago.” Cave Era answered coldly, “It’s just a time mark. By marking a time point, my body can return to that time point. The mark can only last a maximum of three seconds.”

“You didn’t use this move when you fought Ya, right?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I can only use it once. So even if I had used it, I would still have lost. There was no point in using it,” said Cave Era.

“In that case, you believe that you can’t beat Ya, but you can beat me?” Zhou Wen asked.

“At the very least, there’s a chance,” Cave Era said as she transformed into her Terror form again and charged at Zhou Wen.

Banana Fairy blew out the Supreme Yin Wind again. However, the speed of the Supreme Yin Wind couldn’t catch up to Cave Era after she accelerated time. Cave Era circled around the Supreme Yin Wind and continued charging at Zhou Wen.

Banana Fairy was a wind-elemental divine pet. In terms of speed, she wasn’t slower than Cave Era. With Cave Era accelerating time, Banana Fairy still caught up to her. With a grab, the banana leaf under her became a fan that appeared in her hand. She fanned it at Cave Era, and her figure vanished as she entered her Terror form. It was as though she had transformed into an invisible wind.

This was a battle of speed. Banana Fairy and Cave Era were unbelievably fast; ordinary people couldn’t see their figures. All they could see was the wind constantly flowing across the arena.

After Banana Fairy was lured away, Cave Era suddenly summoned four Mythical Companion Beasts and sent them charging at Zhou Wen.
