Chapter 899: Confrontation

Translator: CKtalon

“I am indeed an Immortal...” The elder who called himself the Yin Talisman King already had the intention of retreating. He slowly retreated and wanted to use escape techniques to leave, but he realized that they were completely useless.

“Take another step and you shall perish right here,” The Thearch said indifferently.

Yin Talisman King’s expression changed, but he didn’t dare move. He stood there and said with a bitter smile, “I have no grudge with you, nor did I mean to offend you...”

“Are you worthy of having a grudge with me?” The Thearch said indifferently, “Not to mention a thief like you, even the first Contractor, Yellow Emperor, wouldn’t dare call himself an Immortal, much less a thing like you.”

When Yin Talisman King heard that, fear flashed in his eyes. He hurriedly bowed and said, “Please forgive me, Great One. I inherited the legacy of Yellow Emperor and thought of myself as part of the Yellow Emperor’s lineage. I definitely didn’t dare be disrespectful to the Immortals...”

The Thearch said disdainfully, “You can’t even master the Yin Talisman Sutra and forcefully fused with a Guardian. If Yellow Emperor really has a successor like you, I’m afraid he will be so angry that he will kill himself. Slice off your own arm and scram. If you dare to touch one of mine in the future, there will be no place for you in the world—Heaven, Earth, or Hell.”

Yin Talisman King gritted his teeth and slashed off his left arm. Without looking at the arm that had landed on the ground, he bowed in the direction of the flower and quickly left.

Zhou Wen was dumbfounded. He had originally planned on luring the Yin Talisman King here to let him engage in an internecine battle with The Thearch, but he never expected such an outcome.

Yin Talisman King, who already had the ability of Terror transformation, didn’t even dare resist. The Thearch only needed to say one sentence to make him slice off his arm.

The flower looked at Zhou Wen and said sinisterly, “Were you thinking of luring him to me so that he could fight me so that you could take advantage of the situation?”

Zhou Wen immediately shivered and hurriedly said, “Misunderstanding... It’s really a misunderstanding... I was driven into a corner by him, so I had no choice but to seek your help. I’m really indebted to you for saving my life. I have nothing to repay you with. I’ll go back and prepare some new research equipment for you...”

“Try taking another step,” The Thearch said coldly. “Do you think I really don’t know what you did at the river?”

Zhou Wen had no choice but to stop and look at The Thearch. “Ahem, I just wanted to use your fame to scare him away. I never expected him to really dare come. By the way, The Thearch, why did you get me to come last time?”

“Who did you give that divine fruit to?” The Thearch asked.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to summon Doctor Darkness and say, “I fed him the divine fruit. If I had known that you wanted it, I would have given it to you.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Cut the useless crap.” The Thearch sized up Doctor Darkness before saying to Zhou Wen, “I saved your life today and helped you defeat a powerful enemy. How are you going to repay me?”

“Feel free to instruct me. As long as I can do it, I’ll definitely do my best.” Zhou Wen didn’t have any room for negotiation.

“Use this Companion Beast of yours to help me do something. I won’t treat you unfairly. Don’t you want my blood essence? If you do it, I’ll give you a drop of blood essence,” The Thearch said.

“The matter you mentioned must be very dangerous, right?” Zhou Wen asked carefully.

“It depends. This Companion Beast of yours can barely be considered up to the mark. With him doing this, the difficulty shouldn’t be too high,” The Thearch answered casually.

“Can I know what you want me to do?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I want you to steal something from the dimension,” The Thearch said straightforwardly.

“Stealing? My eldest senior brother is especially good at stealing. Furthermore, he’s an expert with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting. No one in this world can match him. Why don’t I introduce him to you?” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.

The Thearch smiled and said, “Only your Companion Beast can steal it unless there’s another Companion Beast that ate the divine fruit.”

“What’s that?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

“Once I tell you what it is, you have to go,” The Thearch said with a smile.

“Can’t I go now?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Of course not,” The Thearch said firmly.

“Then tell me. What do you want my Doctor Darkness to steal?” Zhou Wen asked the flower.

“I want you to help me steal a bell...” The Thearch pondered for a moment before saying.

“What kind of bell? Which dimensional zone?” Zhou Wen continued asking.

“It’s a bell the size of a fist. It’s made of bronze and looks like a small bell. There’s the ancient word ‘Shang’ engraved on it. When you look at it, you will naturally know that it’s it.” After a pause, The Thearch continued, “Didn’t I just say that the small bell is in the dimension, not a dimensional zone? Otherwise, there wouldn’t be a need for a Companion Beast that has eaten a divine fruit.”

“The place where I took the divine fruit?” Zhou Wen’s expression turned odd.

“Not far from there.” The Thearch nodded.

“I don’t have the ability to go there,” Zhou Wen said.

“Don’t worry about that. Since I’m getting you to go, I naturally have a way to ensure your safe return. You just need to follow the plan and steal that bell back,” The Thearch said.

Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and said, “I can give it a try, but I need some time to prepare. Besides, you have to give me the drop of blood essence first.”

“Sure. Make an oath and I’ll give it to you,” The Thearch said.

Zhou Wen knew that if he swore, it wouldn’t be as simple as empty words. There would definitely be some restrictions if he swore in front of The Thearch.

“Alright, I swear that if I can’t bring that bell back to you, I’ll be severely condemned by my conscience...” Zhou Wen raised his hand and swore solemnly at the flower.

Boom!

A thunderclap suddenly sounded in the sky, giving Zhou Wen a fright.

Zhou Wen originally believed that he couldn’t bluff his way out of this oath, but to his surprise, The Thearch didn’t make him swear again. She said meaningfully, “Conscience is sometimes very important.”

With that said, a crystalline drop of water suddenly flew out from the flower’s stamen without waiting for Zhou Wen to say a word. It flew in front of Zhou Wen and floated in front of him.

“This is the blood essence you want. I’ll give you a month to prepare. Come here in a month and I’ll tell you the detailed plan,” The Thearch said.

Could it be that The Thearch’s true body is really this flower? Zhou Wen looked at the drop of blood essence in front of him and had his suspicions.

He extended his hand towards the water droplet and secretly circulated the Demon God Catalog. The moment Zhou Wen’s palm touched the water droplet, the water droplet seemed to be absorbed by a sponge. It seeped into his skin and was absorbed by the circulating Demon God Catalog.

I actually managed to match it! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.
