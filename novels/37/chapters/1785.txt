Chapter 1786 Time’s Up

“Immortal sword?” Transcendent Immortal’s expression changed slightly when she saw the two swords in Zhou Wen’s hands.

She wasn’t sure if the two swords in Zhou Wen’s hands were the ones in her mind, but they made her feel uneasy.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what immortal sword Transcendent Immortal was talking about, but he had relied on the Immortal Culling Sword to defeat Perfect Sword Immortal and Berserker Immortal.

The two swords, Immortal Peril and Immortal Culling, seemed to have a powerful restraining effect on the Immortals. Perhaps they could really injure Transcendent Immortal.

As for the armor on Zhou Wen’s body, it was transformed from the Mystic Thearch Companion Beast.

Mystic Thearch was born from absorbing the Big Dipper’s Companion Egg. He had a similar body to Empress Polestar, but there were some differences. The strength of his stats was second only to Demonic Neonate. He was almost on par with Truth Listener.

Furthermore, Mystic Thearch had an advantage that Truth Listener didn’t have. His companion form was a soul, allowing him to fuse with Zhou Wen. It allowed Zhou Wen to obtain all his strength and abilities, as well as boost his Constitution. Similarly, it was easier to fully release his powers.

Truth Listener’s earring form could only give Zhou Wen its abilities. Mystic Thearch was more useful in this aspect.

With Su Yi’s shout, even those who didn’t recognize Zhou Wen as Human Sovereign stared at him in shock. They wanted to see if Su Yi was telling the truth.

Soon, everyone confirmed that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign.

“I never expected Human Sovereign to be Zhou Wen. He’s too young. I thought he would be an immortal hermit!”

“I should have known that there are that many experts among humans. It’s definitely one of them. I just never expected it to be Zhou Wen.”

“I’ve known for a long time that Zhou Wen has the looks of an emperor…”

......

“Scram!”

In the Wang family’s courtyard, Wang Lu closed her eyes and pressed her palms together in front of her chest as she silently prayed.

She didn’t dare watch the battle in front of the Cube, nor did she dare watch the livestream because her heart couldn’t withstand the unknown outcome.

In the dimension, once defeated, there was only death. There was no chance of escaping.

So he’s Human Sovereign. That makes it even more interesting. In the unknown underwater ancient city, Tsukuyomi, whose white dress was like snow, sat on a chair-sized shell. She held her cheek and looked at Zhou Wen with interest. Her eyes seemed to flicker with a strange light.

Under the attention of everyone, Zhou Wen struck out with both swords and vanished into thin air.

Transcendent Immortal’s figure suddenly vanished. Then, she heard an ear-piercing sound, but she didn’t see anyone.

Occasionally, power would erupt out of thin air, producing a demonic blast of light. After forming the Human Realm domain, the powers of the other eight cultivation techniques had completely fused with Zhou Wen’s body. He could use them as freely as his limbs, elevating it to a higher level.

Godfiend Spacetime’s instant transmission no longer had any restrictions. It could be used in battle without any pause.

The Teacher Domain had already become an instinct, allowing him to sense the other party’s actions and analyze their pros and cons.

Great Brahma’s domain strengthened the body, and the First Order of Chaos augmented his body with external forces.

The Demon God Bloodline Catalog was ever-changing. The Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens domain made Zhou Wen stronger the more he fought.

Universe Inversion was unpredictable. The Beginningless Sword Domain made the two immortal swords even sharper and indomitable. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

These were no longer domains, but a talent or instinct. There was only one true domain, and that was the Human Realm domain.

All the humans watching the battle, including experts like Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan, couldn’t see the extent of the battle, nor could they tell who had the upper hand.

Such a battle had exceeded the limits of human understanding. Only a few dimensional Apocalypse-grade experts could see the truth of the battle. It was precisely because they could see it clearly that the bigwigs of the dimensional races were even more alarmed.

Zhou Wen was undoubtedly only at the Calamity grade. It was unprecedented for a Calamity grade to fight an Apocalypse grade to such an extent.

No matter how powerful a Calamity grade was, they were as weak as dust in front of an Apocalypse grade.

Those Calamity-grade experts who claimed to have killed Apocalypse-grade experts managed to do so through special reasons. They didn’t really kill an Apocalypse-grade expert in a fair battle.

To put it bluntly, those Calamity-grade creatures were just chess pieces. The true chess player behind them was still an Apocalypse-grade big shot.

The nature of this battle was completely different. Zhou Wen was a genuine Calamity. Transcendent Immortal wasn’t restrained by any external forces and was at her peak.

Even among Apocalypse-grade experts, Transcendent Immortal was definitely not a run-of-the mill expert.

It was difficult to determine the outcome of the battle between Zhou Wen and Transcendent Immortal despite him being a Calamity. Although Transcendent Immortal had the upper hand, it was enough to shock the bigwigs of the dimension.

“Is the potential of humans really that terrifying? If that human is also at the Apocalypse grade…” At that moment, a thought surfaced in their minds: Humans had to be wiped out. Not a single one could be left alive.

Zhou Wen fell into a dire battle. He had already used all his techniques and even with the augmentation of Mystic Thearch and other Companion Beasts, he could barely fight Transcendent Immortal. He was barely doing anything to her.

The power of the New World is just too powerful. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but sigh. The difference between the Apocalypse grade and the Calamity grade was just too great.

This was all thanks to Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s sacrifice. If they hadn’t allowed Zhou Wen to see the essence of Transcendent Immortal’s strength, he probably wouldn’t have been able to put up such a resistance.

There was always someone better. Transcendent Immortal’s New World seemed to be countless spaces interweaving together. Every time Zhou Wen thought that his immortal sword had struck Transcendent Immortal, he would discover that the Transcendent Immortal he had struck was like a bubble. Transcendent Immortal was in a distant space.

On the other hand, Zhou Wen was forced to constantly change his offensive methods. Once he used the same move a second time, he would immediately be counterattacked by Transcendent Immortal.

Even if it was ever-changing, there would always be an end.

When Zhou Wen’s sword missed again, a palm suddenly appeared in front of him, preventing him from dodging. All he could do was cross his swords to block the palm. It was as though he had been struck by a sledgehammer.

Bang!

Zhou Wen’s legs left deep marks on the square’s ground paved with divine stone as he retreated hundreds of meters before coming to a forceful halt.

His entire calf sank into the stone slabs. In front of him were two deep trenches that had been plowed out. The two swords in his hand kept trembling.

“It’s useless. You aren’t on the same level as me. No matter how hard you work, you can only die in vain.” Transcendent Immortal danced in the air and looked down at Zhou Wen, who was on the ground. She was like an invincible goddess.

In fact, most of the humans watching the battle had no idea what had happened. From their point of view, Zhou Wen and Transcendent Immortal had suddenly vanished for less than a second before Zhou Wen appeared in the square in a sorry state. Then, they heard Transcendent Immortal’s invincible declaration.

“Could it be that even Human Sovereign can’t last a second in front of Transcendent Immortal?” Everyone shuddered.

“The Apocalypse grade is really strong.” Zhou Wen looked at Transcendent Immortal in the sky and praised.

“Since you already know the difference, your time is up. It’s time to go.” Transcendent Immortal pressed down with her palm. It was clearly a slender jade-like hand that was only the size of a palm. It wasn’t even as big as Zhou Wen’s hand, but in the eyes of the world, it managed to blot out the sky. It was like an omnipresent heavenly punishment that contained the might to destroy the world.
