Chapter 1468 Demonstrating the Ancient Sovereign Sutra

“Child, don’t be afraid. I won’t harm you. At least not now,” the humanoid monster said faintly as he stood there without any intention of attacking Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen kept his back against the door. Although he didn’t immediately rush out, he was fully focused. If anything went wrong, he would immediately rush out the door.

“Who are you?” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the humanoid monster. He could sense that the humanoid monster was somewhat different from before, but he couldn’t tell what was different.

“I’m no longer worthy of having a name.” The humanoid monster sighed and said, “Child, I don’t have much time. I have some questions for you. In this world, are humans still human?” “What else can humans be if they aren’t humans?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

The humanoid monster seemed to understand something as he said in enlightenment, “Are there still pure-blooded humans in this world?”

“Am I not a pure-blooded human?” Seeing that the Soul Mirror was useless against him, Zhou Wen wanted to unsummon it. “Don’t unsummon the mirror. Its existence gives me more time,” the humanoid monster seemed to see through Zhou Wen’s thoughts and spoke first. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The Heaven Shrouding Bell in Demonic Neonate’s heart continued to shake without any intention of stopping.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as though he had figured out something. He got the Soul Mirror to continue spewing out the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light at the humanoid monster.

The humanoid monster sized up Zhou Wen and shook its head. “No, you aren’t a pure human. Although I can’t sense the dimension’s bloodline in you, pure humans are unable to break through the limits of the Deva Realm. As for you, you have long passed the limits of the Deva Realm.”

“What’s the Deva Realm? Are you referring to the advancement to the Mythical stage?” Zhou Wen pondered.

“Mythical? You can say that.” The humanoid monster thought for a moment and nodded slightly. Then, it asked, “Are there any pure-blooded humans left in this world?”

“Of course. Can you tell me who you are?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“I’m ashamed to continue having a name.” The humanoid monster refused to say anything. He sighed and said, “As long as there are pure-blooded humans, there’s still hope. Although the chances are slim, there’s still a chance.”

After a pause, the humanoid monster pondered and said, “Child, I don’t have much time left. Now, you have to remember every word I say. Although you aren’t a pure human, human blood flows in you. Remember my words. Tell it to every human. This will affect the fate of the entire human race.” “Tell me.” Zhou Wen sized up the humanoid monster in puzzlement, guessing his origins and how trustworthy his words were.

“Firstly, humans have to maintain a pure bloodline. Under no circumstances are they to fuse with dimensional bloodlines. Otherwise, the entire human race will be wiped out.”

Zhou Wen gaped his mouth to say something, but he was interrupted by the humanoid monster. Then, he continued, “Secondly, kill all the invading dimensional creatures. We can’t let them control the land.”

“Third, find a ship with such a mark. There’s a woman on that ship. Kill her,” the humanoid monster said as he extended his finger and drew a symbol on the ground.

Zhou Wen nearly cried out when he saw the symbol.

This was because the symbol drawn by the humanoid monster was the symbol of the anchor and the woman’s side profile.

“The woman you want killed is the woman in the symbol?” Zhou Wen asked as he pointed at the drawing on the ground.

“Yes.” The humanoid monster nodded slightly. “You have to do these three things. If you can’t do any of them, the entire human race might very well be destroyed.”

“Why must these three things be done? Who’s that woman?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“It’s a long story. I don’t have that much time. I’ll next demonstrate the Ancient Sovereign Sutra for you. This is the second half of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. With this second half, pure humans will have a chance to break through the limit of the Deva Realm. Although it’s still extremely unlikely, there’s still that rare chance…”

As the humanoid monster spoke, the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra over his body bloomed. One could clearly sense the Essence Energy circulation in his body. “Everything in the world has its specialty. The tiger has claws; the bird has wings; the fish has scales and gills, but only humans don’t have any specialties. They don’t have sharp claws or teeth, nor do they have wings that can fly, nor do they have the ability to secrete poison, much less survive in water. Humans are so incompatible in this world as though they don’t belong to this world.”

The humanoid monster continued while circulating the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, “As long as everything in the world evolves to a certain level, they can easily break through the limits of the Deva Realm. However, no matter how hard humans work, they are unable to break through this step. Countless human sages have tried their best their entire lives, but they failed to take that step.”

“Human Sovereign once comprehended the Dao. He said that the land is a cage for humans. Humans are trapped here to suffer all kinds of suffering. It’s difficult for them to transcend even across generations. They are nothing but prisoners.” The power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra over the humanoid monster became stronger and stronger. He was like a sun that emitted a terrifying vitality.

“Only by exceeding the limits of the Deva Realm can one be liberated from this cage of suffering. However, the human body seems to be shackled, or perhaps it has some flaws. Even a genius can’t break through the limits of the Deva Realm by themselves.”

When the humanoid monster said that, he became spirited. “I transformed into a devil and broke through the limits of the Deva Realm. Although this body has been crippled and I can’t recover my human body, I’ve also figured out a way to help my race break through the shackles. I’ve completed the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and obtained a sliver of life for the human race. You have to remember this method and pass it on to the world. As long as a pure human can advance to the Mythical stage, it will be the hope of all humanity…”

“Well… Can I interrupt…” Zhou Wen said with an odd expression.

“Don’t say anything else. Listen to me and sense my realm. Although you can no longer cultivate the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, as a human evangelist of the Dao, you will definitely leave your name in history…” The humanoid monster then demonstrated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra as he chanted.

Zhou Wen wanted to tell the humanoid monster that he was a pure-blooded human, but he failed to interject.

The humanoid monster’s strength was unimaginably terrifying. The Ancient Sovereign Sutra he demonstrated had a domineering aura that defied the heavens. Zhou Wen could even sense the scene of a battle forged through blood and fire, one that could collapse the world.

The Ancient Sovereign Sutra he recited was something that wasn’t on the monument.

Zhou Wen however realized that the supplementary parts of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra were clearly different from what he had figured out.

The Ancient Sovereign Sutra only had content after the Mythical stage, so Zhou Wen’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra was a path he had taken himself. The other party had also taken a path himself. The two paths were completely different.

Despite having the same foundation, the Essence Energy Art developed in two completely different directions.
