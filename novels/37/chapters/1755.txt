Chapter 1756 Take it Steady. Don’t Fool Around

Qin Zhen levitated over the Fog Lake. The only thing people could see on the Cube’s screen was her. There was endless fog around her.

Everyone stared nervously at the scene as they wondered if this woman with an excellent figure could tear through the fog’s obstruction, dodge the underwater monster’s attack, or how she would clear the level and pluck the golden apple.

Waiting-everyone was waiting, but as time passed, Qin Zhen floated there without moving as though the scene had frozen. “What’s going on? Is the livestream stuck?”

“The technology these days is getting worse. It can even lag for such a simple livestream.”

“We strongly condemn the incompetent officials of the Federation.”

“What are you braying? How is it lagging? Open your eyes and watch carefully. The fog is still moving.”

“It’s really moving. If it’s not lagging, why isn’t she moving?”

“Did her brain suddenly short-circuit?”

Everyone looked at the livestream in puzzlement, wondering what the woman was waiting for.

When Zhou Wen saw Qin Zhen standing there motionless, he couldn’t help but clasp his forehead with a depressed expression.

He naturally knew what Qin Zhen was thinking, but he had clearly exhorted her to take it steady and not fool around. Now, she was standing there, waiting for the invisible monster in the lake to come out. She wanted to kill the water monster. Was there anything else that was f*cking crazier?

Finally, Qin Zhen moved. She condensed light into a sword and slashed at the calm lake.

Crack!

Although one couldn’t see what Qin Zhen’s sword beam had hit, the cracking sound made it obvious that she had definitely slashed at something and severed it.

The purple light condensed into a sword in Qin Zhen’s hand. After the strike, the sword beams crisscrossed and slashed at the lake.

Cracks sounded incessantly like steel being sliced apart. Qin Zhen was like a high and mighty queen as she mercilessly lashed at the ants beneath her.

“Holy sh*t, this woman is too ferocious. She actually wants to kill the invisible monster in the lake! She’s not leaving unless it’s killed!”

“Awesome, really awesome. She’s really heretical. She doesn’t care about clearing the level at all. She’s here to kill monsters to gain experience.”

“This woman is really… inexplicable…”

“There’s indeed no explanation. This figure and sword technique are too domineering.” “I wonder what she looks like.”

The nervousness from before instantly vanished without a trace. Now, no one was worried about Qin Zhen clearing the level. The atmosphere became extremely festive.

People were guessing if the woman could kill the invisible monster in the lake. Some even made bets.

Qin Zhen didn’t make them wait too long. After the continuous cracking sounds, Qin Zhen suddenly became one with the sword. She transformed into an extremely domineering purple sword beam and instantly rushed into the lake.

This series of actions stunned everyone. Everyone was thinking about how to clear the level, but this woman refused to leave unless she killed the monster. She had actually rushed into the lake herself. Any other person who did that would be an expert at courting death.

Boom!

A pillar-like purple sword beam erupted from the lake and shot into the sky. Something seemed to shatter amidst the sword beam, producing the loud sound of glass shattering.

With a loud bang, the heavy fog that enveloped the Lake of Fog dissipated, revealing a clean mirror-like lake and the strange golden fruit tree in the distance.

There was also Qin Zhen, who appeared in the sky with the sword beam, looking down at the golden fruit tree like a lofty queen.

“This woman is really too arrogant and fierce. Who would dare marry her!?”

“She has the right to be arrogant. If you have the ability, go kill the monster on the Cube.”

“Your Majesty, please accept my bow and take me in. I’m willing to die for you…”

“I knew it. There are many experts among humans. Previously, no one was willing to step forward. Now, there are so many…”

Amidst everyone’s discussion, Qin Zhen walked towards the golden fruit tree. The distance to the lake wasn’t as far as she imagined. The reason there was a sense of distance was because of the fog.

Without any suspense, Qin Zhen slashed down the golden apple. Following that, the Cube stopped its broadcast and revealed the Cube’s ranking

Ming Xiu got ninth while Feng Qiuyan got seventh. As Qin Zhen had killed the lake monster, her ranking was higher than theirs, so she was ranked fourth.

The ranking wasn’t much of a problem. After all, it wasn’t first place. The subsequent rankings weren’t too different, but when people saw the name on the Cube’s ranking, they were dumbfounded.

“Zhou’s Disciple, Qin Zhen! It’s Zhou again!”

“This is crazy! Zhou has gotten three people on the rankings in a row.”

“I suddenly recalled Ming Xiu’s title!” “Haha, it looks like I’m not the only one who thought of it. It’s true that he’s Zhou’s weakest disciple. It’s really the truth. Feng Qiuyan and Qin Zhen are indeed stronger than him. He’s undoubtedly the weakest.”

“That’s ridiculous. The weakest student is ranked ninth. Is this real life?”

“Ming Xiu is the weakest. I wonder how many disciples can fight as well as Ming Xiu. Don’t tell me they will pluck all the remaining golden apples today!”

“Holy sh*t, it can’t be that explosive, right!?”

“I think it’s possible. The six families are cowardly turtles. Now, Zhou Wen’s disciple has stepped forward to help us humans win back our pride. This is a true hero of humanity.”

“I’m in love. Who knows how I can become Zhou Wen’s disciple? I’m willing to be the weakest under Zhou.”

The words ‘Zhou’s Disciple’ instantly became popular. Some people had already changed their online name to ‘Zhou’s So-and-So,’ while others had changed it to ‘Zhou’s Lackey.’

“Anything else to say? She’s not a representative, right?” Zhou Wen asked the girl with a smile.

“She’s not a representative, but how would I know if she was personally taught by you? Perhaps you begged her to pretend to be one of your disciples.” The girl remained stubborn. If the dignified Holy Lady of the Trajectory Holy Temple were to acknowledge a human as her master, she would be disgraced.

“Since you say so, let’s end the bet,” Zhou Wen said casually. He didn’t really want the girl to bow to him as her master, nor did he plan on forcing her into a corner.

Zhou Wen had long recognized the disguised Xiao. He could roughly guess the girl’s origins. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The girl was pumped when she heard Zhou Wen.

With the girl’s logic, if victory was already in her grasp, how could she let it go so easily?

For Zhou Wen to actually let it go, he was definitely afraid. The person named Qin Zhen was definitely not his disciple. Zhou Wen was a liar.

“Don’t. I’ve always kept my word. I’ll definitely keep my word. As long as you can prove that she was taught by you, I’ll immediately serve tea and acknowledge you as my master,” the girl said arrogantly, believing that she had caught Zhou Wen by surprise.

“How do you want me to prove it?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Simple. Since she’s your student, her sword art must have been taught by you. Show me her sword art. If a teacher’s sword art isn’t as good as a student’s, then our bet…” The girl didn’t finish her sentence, but her meaning was obvious. If Zhou Wen’s sword art was inferior to Qin Zhen’s, the bet would be considered her win.
