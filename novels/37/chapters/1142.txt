Chapter 1143: It’s a Long Story

After some thought, he couldn’t think of a reasonable explanation. All Zhou Wen could do was get Grim Demon and Banana Fairy to continue attacking.

However, across the Sapphire Sky, Grim Demon and Banana Fairy’s powers were almost unable to injure the dimensional creature. The dazzling blue beam released by the dimensional creature was greatly weakened. It could only barely transform the demonic aura into sapphire. Furthermore, the blue beams dissipated not long after passing through the Sapphire Sky. It couldn’t exist for long. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

However, this was already very shocking. Be it Grim Demon’s demonic aura or Banana Fairy’s wind, none of them could completely eliminate the blue beam.

Even if one’s strength was far stronger than the blue beam, it would be permeated by the blue beam and become a part of the demonic aura or wind before slowly turning into sapphire.

However, due to the power of the dazzling light being too weak, it could only convert a tiny portion of the demonic aura or wind into sapphire-like crystals before being exhausted.

After shattering, the demonic aura and wind that had turned into sapphire would automatically fly to the Sapphire Sky, becoming a part of it.

What’s going on? Is it imprisoned here or did it trap itself? Could it be that it can only survive in the Sapphire Sky? It will die if it leaves the Sapphire Sky, so it tries to turn everything into sapphire? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that this idea wasn’t too reliable.

However, since he couldn’t break through the Sapphire Sky’s obstruction, it was impossible for him to kill the Terror creature. Zhou Wen had no choice but to change his strategy and use the Terror form of Great Brahma.

Great Brahma was in a Spirit Body state, something that Zhou Wen wanted to exploit to see if it could pass through the Sapphire Sky.

The four-faced and eight-armed Great Brahma flew towards the Sapphire Sky. The black hole behind him was like the entrance to hell, as though it could devour everything. It also seemed like countless evil spirits were about to crawl out.

It really passed through!

Zhou Wen watched as Great Brahma entered the Sapphire Sky. Just like the dimensional creature, Great Brahma looked like it had entered water. His actions were slowed down a little but weren’t too affected.

The ribbon on the lower half of the dimensional creature’s body danced as it shimmered with blue light that swept towards Great Brahma.

As they were in the Sapphire Sky, the might of the dazzling blue beam wasn’t weakened. It was unimaginably terrifying.

Great Brahma was still sitting cross-legged with his eight hands forming different hand seals. The expressions on the three faces were also different. Only the face facing the black hole had no discernible expression.

Only when the blue beam descended in front of Great Brahma did he strike out with a palm.

The blue beam was extinguished by Great Brahma’s palm as though a candle had been extinguished.

Holy sh*t, Great Brahma is unstoppable! Zhou Wen was overjoyed, but he could also tell that the dimensional creature inside the Sapphire Sky was undoubtedly a soul. Great Brahma was most effective against such creatures.

Great Brahma could almost be said to be the nemesis of ghosts and souls. At the same level, creatures like ghosts were unable to put up a fight.

Although the dimensional creature inside the Sapphire Sky was a Spirit Body, it was somewhat different from ordinary ghosts. It wasn’t completely suppressed by Great Brahma as it constantly emitted blue beams to fight.

Its figure floated erratically in the Sapphire Sky as though it could teleport. It appeared around Great Brahma as blue beams constantly bombarded him.

However, no matter how strange and powerful the blue beams were, they were suppressed by Great Brahma’s palm. They immediately dimmed and were extinguished, making the attack meaningless.

“Nicely done. Kill it!” Zhou Wen directed Great Brahma to kill the dimensional creature.

However, Zhou Wen soon realized gloomily that Great Brahma wouldn’t take the initiative to attack. He would only counterattack when his opponent attacked.

Great Brahma’s counterattacks were clearly insufficient to kill the dimensional creature.

It can’t be! Great Brahma only knows how to be beaten up?

Zhou Wen found it unbelievable. With his understanding of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, it didn’t seem to be the case.

Furthermore, Great Brahma had four faces. One was heartless, one was bliss, and the other was filled with pity. Although the fourth face remained unknown, the three faces made him unlikely to be someone who only knew how to take a beating.

Did something go wrong? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

Zhou Wen sank his mind into Great Brahma. It was born from him and was equivalent to his avatar. Zhou Wen immediately received some information about Great Brahma, making his expression change.

Although Great Brahma was nurtured by Zhou Wen, it didn’t mean that he understood everything about it.

Great Brahma’s power didn’t only come from Zhou Wen. It also came from the profundity of the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and the Guardian’s blood that served as a foundation. Therefore, the Terror-form Great Brahma was actually an extremely complicated individual. Even Zhou Wen found it difficult to understand everything about him.

From the basic information he received, the power that Great Brahma used in battle was actually only a quarter of his total strength.

He had a total of four faces, and each face represented a different power. Now, what was really used in battle was the expressionless side in front.

The power of the left and right faces wasn’t used for combat, so they weren’t suitable for attacking.

And the last face that even Zhou Wen couldn’t see hid an extremely terrifying power. Even as Great Brahma’s owner, Zhou Wen felt his heart palpitate as though there was something terrifying about it. Once it was activated, even the owner couldn’t predict the outcome.

However, this was in-game, so Zhou Wen naturally didn’t have any qualms. He directly activated the unknown face of Great Brahma.

After Zhou Wen issued the order, Great Brahma finally did something different. The face facing the black hole slowly turned around.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what the face looked like. He was staring at the side of his face that was spinning, when he suddenly realized that the scene around him had undergone a strange change.

The black hole that was like a Buddhistic glow behind Great Brahma gradually expanded as he turned around.

Before Great Brahma could fully turn his head, the black hole had already devoured the Sapphire Sky. Countless evil spirits roared out of it, turning the underground sea into hell.

Zhou Wen only saw Great Brahma’s side profile. Before he could see it clearly, the game screen suddenly turned black.

As a dark cloud hung over him, Zhou Wen was rendered speechless. He was probably the first person in history to be killed by his Terror form power.

Holy sh*t, I’m the creator of Great Brahma after all. Even I’m killed! This doesn’t make sense! Zhou Wen’s feelings were indescribable.
