Seeing Zhou Wen enter the arena, Joseph’s eyes narrowed slightly as he waved his hand and said, “Isn’t your Tyrant Behemoth very strong? Then I’ll wait for you to summon it. If I were to attack first, you wouldn’t even have the chance to summon a Companion Beast.”

As soon as these words were spoken, the spectator stands were filled with cheers. Regardless of whether Joseph had the ability or not, such a domineering declaration made the locals who supported him feel their blood boil. Furthermore, the people here were valiant. It was a place that held martial arts in high esteem.

“This person... really doesn’t know the meaning of death...” Li Xuan said with a smile.

Feng Qiuyan pondered for a moment before saying, “With Joseph’s personality, he should have some ulterior motives for doing so. Previously, Lance said that Joseph has the ability to harm others by transferring injuries. I think he plans on using that move.”

“That’s why I said that he hasn’t died before. He actually dares to use a technique that he has already used before in front of Zhou Wen. I’m afraid he doesn’t even know how he died,” Li Xuan said with a smile.

“That’s true. Since Coach already knows that he has such an ability, it would be too naive for him to use this move against Coach,” Feng Qiuyan said with a nod.

Seeing Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan looking as though Zhou Wen was bound to win, Li Benyu couldn’t help but frown and say, “A Guardian’s strength is the strongest at present. Furthermore, Zhou Wen hasn’t seen Lance and Joseph’s battle with his own eyes. It’s best to be careful. It’s best to summon more Companion Beasts to probe his strength.”

Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan didn’t say a word as Lance said with a smile, “Uncle Li, don’t worry. If the move he already knows about can injure him, he won’t be Zhou Wen.”

Upon hearing Lance’s words, Li Benyu couldn’t help but be surprised.

Lance was a very hardworking person, and his talent was unparalleled.

Although he had lost to Joseph, most people in the Ultimate Family Clan didn’t believe that it was a true defeat.

This was because Lance didn’t contract a Guardian or use a Mythical Companion Beast. It was an unfair battle against Joseph, so the Ultimate Family Clan’s importance of Lance didn’t decrease at all.

Li Benyu had never seen Lance praise others in such a tone. Even an elite like Sadie had never been praised by Lance like this.

Li Benyi also said confidently, “Dad, don’t worry. With Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui around, Zhou Wen will definitely win.”

“Is that so?” Li Benyu looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief. He didn’t know what kind of magic Zhou Wen had that made these people so confident in him. It could be said that it was blind faith.

In the arena, Zhou Wen wasn’t angered by Joseph’s provocation. He said without a change in expression, “There’s no need for Tyrant Behemoth to deal with you. Just summoning a Companion Beast is sufficient.”

The moment Zhou Wen said that, the crowd booed. To the locals of Frost City, Zhou Wen’s words were too arrogant.

Although Joseph didn’t dare say that he was invincible, he had a Guardian after all. On the rankings, only a Guardian could surpass a Guardian on the rankings. Even if Lie was defeated, it wasn’t something any Companion Beast could defeat.

“Is that so? Then just randomly summon a Companion Beast. I’ll stand here motionless and see how you defeat me,” said Joseph coldly as a cold glint flashed in his eyes. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The people of Frost City cheered for Joseph. Zhou Wen only smiled. “Stand still? I hope you will do as you say.”

“You don’t have the right to make me move,” Joseph continued provocatively.

He wasn’t doing it purely for his reputation, but to infuriate Zhou Wen and get him to use all his strength. The more serious his injuries were, the stronger the Guardian would be.

Lie had a skill called Hypocritical Transaction. When using this skill, the damage he suffered would be transferred to the opponent who injured him.

However, Hypocritical Transaction had a time limit. He only had a few seconds for the transaction, so he wanted to infuriate Zhou Wen and get his Companion Beast to attack with all its might. After transferring the power that was released, in the span of a few seconds, there was a possibility of directly killing the other party’s Companion Beast.

He wanted Zhou Wen to lose a Mythical Companion Beast first. This was the price Zhou Wen had to pay for underestimating him.

The reason why Joseph dared to challenge Zhou Wen was because of the existence of this move. This was a skill that was the nemesis of Tyrant Behemoth. The stronger Tyrant Behemoth was, the higher the possibility of death.

Zhou Wen didn’t say anything else as he summoned a Companion Beast.

Everyone looked at the short sword beside Zhou Wen in surprise. It was a red sheathed short sword that was about a foot long. The hilt resembled the head of a phoenix, making it look extremely exquisite.

They had never seen such a Companion Beast before and didn’t know its origins. However, they were somewhat disappointed that Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t summoned.

Tyrant Behemoth’s domineering stance of invincibility was something they had admired. They never expected Zhou Wen to summon a short sword that didn’t look domineering at all.

Li Benyi, Lance, and company were also intrigued. They didn’t know what was so special about the short sword Zhou Wen had summoned. They wondered if it could really be effective on Joseph.

“What Companion Beast is that sword? Is it very powerful? Why didn’t he use Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui?” Li Benyi looked at Lance in puzzlement, hoping that he could answer his doubts.

Lance looked at the Bronze Sparrow Sword in front of Zhou Wen and said, “From the aura of that sword, it should be a fire-elemental Mythical Companion Beast. It being a sword and fire-elemental in nature, there’s no doubt that it’s a Companion Beast with extremely high offensive strength. However, Joseph has the ability to transfer damage. It’s very risky to use such a Companion Beast to attack Joseph. However, Zhou Wen definitely has his own plans. We’ll just watch.”

Li Benyi also became nervous when Lance said that.

Li Benyu’s judgment was the same as Lance’s. He also felt that it was clearly irrational for Zhou Wen to use such a Companion Beast to fight Joseph.

The best way to deal with an ability that could exchange damage was to use Companion Beasts with the ability to confine the opponent’s body. This was a more normal solution.

Clearly, Zhou Wen didn’t have such plans.

“Are you ready?” Zhou Wen held the Bronze Sparrow Sword and asked Joseph.

“Anytime. However, such a crappy sword probably can’t injure me. It’s best you summon Tyrant Behemoth,” Joseph mocked.

“Since you’re ready, make sure you don’t move,” Zhou Wen said as he unsheathed his sword. The fiery-red Bronze Sparrow Sword tore out of its scabbard and stabbed at Joseph with a tornado-like inferno.

With the augmentation of Vajra Drill, the Bronze Sparrow Sword instantly appeared in front of Joseph and stabbed into his chest.

Well done! Joseph wasn’t alarmed but delighted. Such a violent attack meant that the sword-shaped Companion Beast was indeed very strong. It was enough to teach Zhou Wen a lesson by killing it first.
