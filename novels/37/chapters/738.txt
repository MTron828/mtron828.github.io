Chapter 739: Killing the Nine Dragons

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen observed for a long period of time. By the time he was done, his luxurious lineup of Mythical pets had been destroyed by the nine black dragons. Torch Dragon was heavily injured, and despite Tyrant Behemoth roaring repeatedly, it was unable to reverse the situation.

Truth Listener showed signs of going berserk. The Great Might Vajra Bull onshore had been killed at some point in time.

Demonic Neonate apparently failed to find a chance to attack. She had been hiding all this time.

Zhou Wen directly unsummoned Truth Listener, preventing it from shattering another earring. Torch Dragon was also unsummoned. The heavily injured Torch Dragon basically didn’t have any combat strength left.

Torch Dragon, who couldn’t use Bright Torch Vision World, could only be considered top-notch in combat, but being top-notch wasn’t enough in such a battle.

Only Tyrant Behemoth was at the front line. It was being tortured by the nine black dragons as it roared angrily, but it remained completely suppressed.

Not only was Zhou Wen not discouraged, he even felt happy.

This was because, after his long period of observation, he discovered a secret of the nine black dragons.

If one looked at their appearance and abilities, the nine black dragons were no different. Their offensive methods were also similar, so they could be seen as nonuplets.

Therefore, Zhou Wen’s initial plan was to kill them one by one.

However, when Zhou Wen used his Eyes of Penetration to see the dragon pearls in their bodies, he discovered a special phenomenon.

Although the power in the nine dragons’ bodies could be transferred freely without any problems during the transfer, Zhou Wen realized that the Wu dragon pearl would light up every time their powers were transferred.

For example, when the Li dragon attacked by gathering the power of the nine dragons, the Li dragon pearl would light up, but the Wu dragon pearl would also light up. The other dragon pearls didn’t light up.

However, when the Kan dragon pearl attacked, the Kan dragon pearl would light up along with the Wu dragon pearl.

In other words, no matter which dragon condensed the power of the nine dragons, the Wu dragon pearl would light up along with it. Only when the Wu dragon pearl’s dragon attacked would only its dragon pearl light up.

From this vantage, Zhou Wen suddenly realized that perhaps the Wu dragon pearl’s dragon was the core of the nine black dragons, or rather, a transit station. Perhaps it was because of its existence that the nine black dragons could freely transfer their powers.

If I kill the black dragon with the Wu dragon pearl first, will the ability to combine the nine dragons’ strength as one be ineffective? Zhou Wen decided to give it a try.

After quitting the game and respawning the dungeon, Zhou Wen entered the game again and summoned his luxurious lineup of Mythical pets. However, this time, after getting Doctor Darkness to possess him, he switched his Essence Energy Art to the Godfiend Era. The Lost Country Life Soul ring also appeared on his finger.

Since I can’t find an opportunity, I’ll create one myself. Zhou Wen stared intently at the nine black dragons in the middle of the battle and locked onto the black dragon with the Wu dragon pearl.

The six wings on his back flapped gently as Zhou Wen gradually approached the battlefield. When the nine black dragons noticed him and were about to attack, Zhou Wen suddenly vanished.

The black dragon that was about to attack was slightly taken aback as Zhou Wen’s figure appeared above another black dragon.

He genuflected on the dragon’s head. With his left hand pressing on the dragon’s skull, his right hand stabbed into the dragon’s head with a devil-like force.

The hard dragon scales and dragon bones failed to block the ghostly palm. In an instant, Zhou Wen retracted his palm from the dragon’s head. And between his slender fingers was a crystalline dragon pearl.

After losing the dragon pearl, the black dragon was like an empty shell that had lost its brain. Its body lost its vitality and fell to the bottom of the sea.

What surprised Zhou Wen even more, was that after he crushed the dragon pearl, the invisible chain that connected the nine black dragons shattered. The nine black dragons were immediately in a state of disunity.

Two black dragons roared as they charged at Zhou Wen. With Transcendent Flying Immortal, Zhou Wen’s speed wasn’t any slower than the black dragons’. Without the augmentation of the nine dragons’ collective strength, the black dragons couldn’t catch up to Zhou Wen.

A blackish-purple sword beam streaked across the sea and stabbed into the eye of a black dragon, piercing through the dragon pearl in its head. Demonic Neonate had finally taken action and dispatched one.

Meanwhile, Tyrant Behemoth was even more excited. Without the suppression of the nine dragons’ collective strength, its Absolute Strength unleashed, snapping the dragon horn off a black dragon. Then, it threw punch after punch, shattering the black dragon’s head.

The nine black dragons that originally had the absolute advantage immediately became the ones being ravaged after losing the key black dragon with the Wu dragon pearl.

There was no need for Zhou Wen to do anything else as the luxurious lineup of Mythical pets killed the remaining black dragons.

Indeed, it’s difficult for those who aren’t in the know, but it’s not difficult for those who do. Knowledge is power. If I had known that these nine black dragons had such a relationship and weakness, I wouldn’t have waited until today to kill them. The saying of the forefathers is right. Know yourself and your enemy, and you will never be defeated. Zhou Wen sighed at the importance of knowledge.

‘Killed a Mythical Creature, True Blood Demon Dragon. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’

After the True Blood Demon Dragons were killed, notices kept coming in. Finally, a True Blood Demon Dragon dropped a dimensional crystal with 80 Strength. It was very high-level and valuable, but Zhou Wen couldn’t use it now.

There are only two black dragons left! Zhou Wen was still looking forward to having a black dragon Companion Egg drop.

However, even when the last black dragon was penetrated by Demonic Neonate’s sword, it failed to drop a Companion Egg. Instead, another dimensional crystal dropped, an Essence Energy Skill Crystal.

Zhou Wen picked up the Essence Energy Skill Crystal and realized that the stat requirement was 41 Strength and 21 Fire stat. It was different from the True Blood Demon Dragon Crystal he had previously obtained.

With his Strength and Fire stat lacking, Zhou Wen had no choice but to give it up.

Zhou Wen was already used to it, so he didn’t feel the pinch. Seeing that his Companion Beasts weren’t injured, he led them towards the war wagon. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Now that the nine black dragons weren’t disturbing him, Zhou Wen wanted to give it a try to see if he could kill the Guardian in the war wagon. This was the hope for Slaughterer Life Soul’s advancement.

After opening the door, Zhou Wen entered with his Companion Beasts and saw the cocoon floating in the void.

He wasn’t in a rush to approach it. Zhou Wen used his Eyes of Penetration to look at the cocoon, hoping to see what the creature inside looked like.

Something strange happened. The white cocoon was clearly right in front of him, but the Light of Penetration seemed to be separated from the white cocoon by a massive distance. No matter how hard he tried, his vision couldn’t reach the white cocoon.

Zhou Wen immediately recalled that he had encountered the same situation when he first entered. Back then, he had wanted to pierce through the white cocoon to extract the blood, but he couldn’t touch the white cocoon no matter what. It was only because of the characteristics of the Overlord Sword that he could tear through space and touch the white cocoon in the void.

Light of Penetration clearly didn’t have such characteristics, so it was impossible to reach the white cocoon.

Since we are going to fight, there’s no point in watching. Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed out a sword beam that tore through the void and headed straight for the white cocoon.
