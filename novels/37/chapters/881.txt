Chapter 882: The Man in White

This place was strange, very strange. Zhou Wen wanted to backtrack, but when he turned around, the mountain wall crack he had come from had vanished. Behind him was a complete mountain wall. There was no way out.

Zhou Wen reached out to touch the mountain wall. It was made of real stone, not an illusion.

Feeling that something was amiss, Zhou Wen summoned a Poison Bat and attempted to have it fly out through the sky. However, when the Poison Bat flew out of the valley, it seemed to hit something and fell from the sky.

This outcome didn’t surprise Zhou Wen. If this was really a dimensional zone, it was normal that it couldn’t fly out.

How can I leave this dimensional zone? Seeing that there was no way out, Zhou Wen had no choice but to walk deeper in, hoping to find a way to leave the dimensional zone.

He summoned different Companion Beasts to scout ahead. There were Runic Heavy-Armored Warriors, Flying Ants, and some small green-furred Gu.

The valley was as beautiful as a fairyland, but there was no living creature. There was no aura of a living person in the wooden houses and bamboo buildings.

Under Zhou Wen’s control, a green-furred Gu burrowed into the wooden hut closest to him. It realized that there were all sorts of daily necessities used by humans in the wooden hut. However, those things looked ancient, unlike those used by modern humans. Furthermore, there was no one inside, nor were there any dimensional creatures.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue exploring. Strangely, there were no creatures in the valley. The Poison Bats that he had lost contact with had vanished.

After circling the entire valley, he realized that it wasn’t small at all. There was even a stream circling it, and the scenery was especially beautiful.

Beside the stream was a huge peach tree. The tree was covered in flowers, making it look gorgeous.

However, for some reason, there were no other peach trees beside the huge peach tree. The other peach trees were a distance away from the huge peach tree, making it look a little lonely.

After circling the valley twice—a place that looked like paradise—he would have found this place a great place if not for suddenly losing contact with his Companion Beasts after they went beyond a certain range.

There must be something in this valley. Where are they hiding? Zhou Wen searched for a long time but failed to find a way out. Similarly, he failed to find the Companion Beasts that had lost contact with him.

It was useless to walk around. Zhou Wen sat down to rest as he thought of various possibilities.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if this was the legendary Peach Blossom Spring as everything here was slightly different from the legendary Peach Blossom Spring.

Time ticked by. Zhou Wen failed to come up with a way to leave this place. Although he had tried to force his way out, it was useless.

The Earth Elemental Beast’s Earth Escape technique could only circle around the valley, preventing it from escaping.

The mountain wall seemed to have a life of its own. The hole that Tyrant Behemoth dug out would be quickly filled up.

The sky gradually darkened as a moon rose into the sky.

A strange sound suddenly appeared in the originally silent valley. Zhou Wen tilted his head to listen. It was the sound of a flute.

After determining the direction, the sound of the flute seemed to come from the stream.

Zhou Wen had been searching the valley the entire day, but he hadn’t found any clues. Now that there was a sudden sound of a flute, he naturally wanted to take a look.

Even if it was a dimensional creature, he would at least gain some understanding of what to do. He wasn’t as aimless as he was now.

Zhou Wen carefully walked to the stream and, from afar, saw a person in white sitting under a huge peach blossom tree. He held a flute in his hand, and the sound was coming from it.

From where Zhou Wen was, he could only see the person’s side profile. He was dressed in white with his long hair tied up. Wherever the peach blossoms fell, he would gently blow into the bamboo flute, making him look like a deity.

It’s impossible for someone to really be here. It should be a humanoid dimensional creature. I wonder how strong he is? Zhou Wen stood motionless as he sized up the white-robed man from afar.

After the tune ended, the white-robed man put down the bamboo flute in his hand and turned to look at Zhou Wen. “Since you’re here, why don’t you have a drink with me?”

Only then did Zhou Wen see that the white-robed man was handsome. On the ground beside him was a jade alcohol flask and wine cups.

Is he really not a human? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled when he saw that his appearance and actions resembled a human.

Seeing a motionless Zhou Wen, the white-robed man picked up the alcohol flask and wine cup and poured himself a cup. As he drank, he looked at the moon in the sky and said, “Life is so short. Why seek frustrations?”

The white-robed man was enjoying the moon and drinking, but Zhou Wen couldn’t help but ask, “Who are you?”

“Immortal,” the person in white answered. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“What immortal?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“Immortals are immortals. They are carefree, happy, and comfortable,” the white-robed man said.

Seeing that he couldn’t get an answer, Zhou Wen asked, “Do you know how to get out of here?”

“Why do you want to leave? Isn’t this place good? It’s aloof from worldly affairs and there are no worries. Is there any place better than this in this world?” the person in white said as he drank.

“This place is very good, but I don’t like it here,” Zhou Wen said.

“You can’t leave. This is an immortal realm, a place isolated from the mortal world. Unless one dies, no one can leave this place,” the white-robed man said.

Zhou Wen naturally refused to believe the white-robed man’s words. As long as it was a dimensional zone, there was definitely a way to leave.

Zhou Wen was somewhat hesitant, unsure if he should immediately attack the white-robed man. This white-robed man looked like a human, but he was likely a dimensional creature. However, with his high intelligence, his strength was definitely extraordinary. Zhou Wen was wondering if he should wait for Banana Fairy to complete her evolution before taking action.

After some thought, Zhou Wen looked at the white-robed man and wanted to say something, but he was surprised to discover that the white-robed man had vanished under the peach blossom tree.

Zhou Wen called out a few times, but no one responded. He searched the valley again, but he didn’t see the white-robed man again.

He waited until daybreak, but he didn’t see any living creatures again.

What kind of dimensional zone is this? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.

If a horde of dimensional creatures were to pounce at him, Zhou Wen knew what to do. But his current situation left him at a loss.

No, the next time I see that white-robed person, I have to think of a way to subdue him and figure out how to leave this place. Zhou Wen thought for a moment and summoned Explosive Fiend Man to make some arrangements in the valley.

With such a highly-intelligent dimensional creature, it was definitely not easy to deal with. Zhou Wen had no choice but to make preparations in advance—just in case.
