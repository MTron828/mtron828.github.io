Chapter 593 Gods Retrea

Zero Taboo was originally a crystal, but it had transformed into the shape of an infant. It sat cross-legged in Zhou Wen’s mind space like a crystalline jade statue.

Furthermore, the infant’s appearance was very similar to Zhou Wen’s. Zhou Wen vaguely remembered that there was a picture of him when he was young back at his old place. It looked very similar to the baby in the mind space.

Zhou Wen was in Small Buddha Temple, but he didn’t sense the taboo power of Small Buddha Temple. The infant jade statue didn’t emit any light either. Its eyes were closed as though it had fallen asleep.

Zhou Wen opened his eyes and checked the blood-colored avatar’s information on the phone. He saw that the name and annotation had changed in the Life Soul column.

Gods Retreat (Evolved Body): Where the Life Soul is, the Gods flee.

This introduction is more impressive than before, but I wonder what its true effects are? Zhou Wen felt that the annotation was a little too crazy.

It was clearly meaning that wherever the Life Soul went, even gods had to avoid it. How could an Evolved Body Life Soul be capable of this?

Regardless, he could indeed sense the growth of his Life Soul. This was because the taboo of Small Buddha Temple was completely ineffective against the jade infant named “Gods Retreat.”

Zhou Wen knew that staying here was probably useless. He had to search for a forbidden ground that was even stronger than Small Buddha Temple. He wanted to see if he could use Gods Retreat to continue raising his strength.

I wonder what the Perfect Body will be after Zero Taboo and Gods Retreat? Zhou Wen was more curious about the Life Soul condensed by the Dao Body.

Unlike other Life Souls, every evolution of the Dao Body Life Soul seemed to involve a huge change.

Where else has taboo powers that are stronger than Small Buddha Temple? Immortal Seeking Mountain? It’s too far. Besides, I don’t know the way to Immortal Seeking Mountain... Zhou Wen left Small Buddha Temple and thought about where he could continue cultivating the entire way.

After some thought, he felt that the best place to go was probably White Cloud Mountain’s Jade Emperor Peak. There was an extremely powerful taboo power there that might allow Gods Retreat to improve.

Zhou Wen had already downloaded the White Cloud Mountain dungeon on his phone, but its name was Demon Suppression Mountain.

After launching the Demon Suppression Mountain dungeon, the blood-colored avatar appeared outside the Jade Emperor Peak’s entrance. Zhou Wen still remembered that the last time he stepped into the mountain, Zero Taboo nearly exploded in less than ten seconds.

I wonder how long I can now last? Zhou Wen activated the Gods Retreat Life Soul and controlled the blood-colored avatar to enter the Jade Emperor Peak’s entrance.

The moment he passed the entrance, the Gods Retreat Life Soul opened his eyes. The crystalline body emitted a strange glow.

Then, Zhou Wen saw a strange force surge towards the baby jade statue. It was not like when he had Zero Taboo. The Life Soul sucked the mysterious taboo power into his body and made it part of him.

The taboo power of Jade Emperor Peak failed to injure the jade infant statue. Instead, it made the glow over him grow stronger as though it was protected by divine light.

What a powerful Life Soul. If that’s the case, wouldn’t I be able to come and go freely on Jade Emperor Peak? I wouldn’t have to worry about the length of time? Zhou Wen made the blood-colored avatar walk up the stone steps, hoping to figure out what secrets White Cloud Mountain’s Jade Emperor Peak held.

After walking up the stone steps, it didn’t take him long to see a huge hall. On both sides of the hall was a stone beast statue. It looked rather strange.

The two stone statues were crouching. They looked like stone tigers, but there were curved horns on their heads. Fiery cloud patterns were engraved on their bodies.

What was even more strange was that there was a word engraved on the foreheads of the two stone tigers. On the left side of the door was the word Suppression. On the right side of the stone tiger was the word “Demon.”

Just as Zhou Wen approached the temple, he saw the words Demon Suppression on the two stone tigers’ foreheads light up.

As the words ‘Demon Suppression’ lit up, Zhou Wen realized that the strange powers had gushed into Gods Retreat’s body like a heavenly river. The jade infant’s face revealed a look of pain, and its body also began to show signs of abnormality, as though there were faint cracks appearing.

Zhou Wen hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to leave Jade Emperor Peak. Although Gods Retreat didn’t have the ability to make all gods retreat, his abilities were indeed much stronger than Zero Taboo. Furthermore, he could absorb the taboo power.

However, the power of the words Demon Suppression was too powerful, preventing the jade infant from digesting it. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Although I can’t enter the temple, I’ve found a way to evolve the jade infant. I’ll just cultivate on Jade Emperor Peak in the future. It’s only a matter of time before I advance to a Perfect Body. Zhou Wen was considering if he should personally make a trip to White Cloud Mountain. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to grind other dungeons if he stayed on White Cloud Mountain in-game.

I should make a trip to White Cloud Mountain. I might even have a chance to see the immortal palace phenomenon. Zhou Wen thought for a long time before deciding to make a trip to White Cloud Mountain in reality.

He told An Sheng, Li Xuan, and his friends about his trip to White Cloud Mountain. An Sheng told Zhou Wen to be careful. Other than that, there was nothing else.

After Li Xuan heard about White Cloud Mountain, he indicated an interest in going with Zhou Wen. He had recently reached a bottleneck and hadn’t been able to continue his breakthrough. He was thinking of heading out for a spin to change his train of thought.

That afternoon, the two of them went to White Cloud Mountain. As it was in Luoyang, the duo rode their Companion Beasts and soon arrived at White Cloud Mountain.

“Put this on. You can’t take it off no matter what. Otherwise, don’t blame me when you see the immortal palace phenomenon.” Zhou Wen threw a balaclava at Li Xuan.

“Why aren’t you wearing one?” Li Xuan asked suspiciously when he saw Zhou Wen prepare a balaclava.

“Let alone the immortal palace phenomenon, even if gods really descend, I wouldn’t need to close my eyes and hide,” Zhou Wen said half-jokingly.

“You’re awesome, aren’t you!” Li Xuan gloomily put on the balaclava. Zhou Wen led the way as the two of them climbed up White Cloud Mountain.

With the Gods Retreat Life Soul, Zhou Wen was still looking forward to seeing the immortal palace phenomenon again. Previously, due to his lacking strength, he hadn’t been able to clearly see what the fairy, who tore out of the entrance, looked like. If she were to come out again, he could see her clearly.

Unfortunately, no immortal palace phenomenon appeared along the way. Even when the two of them arrived at the entrance of Jade Emperor Peak, they did not see a single dimensional creature, much less any phenomena.

“Old Zhou, why aren’t you walking?” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen since he couldn’t see a thing.

“Jade Emperor Peak is in front. After passing through the entrance, there’s a terrifying taboo power inside. Even Mythical creatures will die in a short period of time if they enter. I cultivate an Essence Energy Art that can withstand that forbidden power. Furthermore, I need to cultivate inside. Don’t come in,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.

“You’ve mentioned it before. I came here for Jade Emperor Peak’s taboo powers. You can enter by yourself. Don’t mind me,” Li Xuan said as he summoned his Life Soul. The black carapace wrapped around his body as a black evil aura rose from the armor. It looked evil and powerful, completely different from Li Xuan’s usual demeanor.
