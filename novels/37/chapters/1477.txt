Chapter 1478 Laojun Platform

After the war, Umekawa Taro, the gunner responsible for bombarding Laojun Platform, came to Luyi again and kowtowed in repentance. According to him, he had fired the shells very accurately back then. The shells had hit Laojun Platform, but why hadn’t the shells exploded? Even he couldn’t explain it.

Umekawa Taro believed that Taishang Laojun had blessed the area. He even erected a monument of repentance at Laojun Platform, but it was later changed to a monument of peace.

No one could verify it now.

However, after Laojun Platform became a dimensional zone, it indeed became a magical land.

Typical dimensional zones had dimensional creatures, but there were no dimensional creatures on Laojun Platform.

That wasn’t entirely accurate. There were just no native dimensional creatures. Instead, many dimensional creatures from other dimensional zones had fled to Laojun Platform to seek refuge.

Typical dimensional zones didn’t reject humans, but they had a strong rejection effect on creatures from other dimensional zones. Creatures from different dimensional zones seldom ran around. However, this wasn’t the case with Laojun Platform. Any dimensional creature, including humans, could freely enter and exit Laojun Platform, but there was one point-killing was prohibited.

This was very similar to Mount Laojun. Both places forbade killing. The difference was that if one killed on Laojun Platform, the consequences would be worse than on Mount Laojun.

Legend had it that a group of humans had chased after a rare dimensional creature all the way to Laojun Platform. The group only managed to kill it when the dimensional creature placed one foot on Laojun Platform.

They also knew the taboo of Laojun Platform, so they were somewhat hesitant. However, that dimensional creature was very rare to begin with. Back then, they realized that it seemed to have a Companion Egg in its body. They ultimately failed to resist the temptation and ran to loot the corpse.

A beam ended up descending from the sky and took them all away. No one saw them again. The locals claimed that Laojun had personally taken action to finish them off, sending them to heaven as he couldn’t stand them. It was impossible to determine the veracity of this matter. From then on, no one dared to kill at Laojun Platform. They didn’t even dare to cause injuries.

Of course, dimensional creatures that escaped into Laojun Platform wouldn’t harm humans there either.

Laojun Platform became one of the few dimensional zones that allowed humans to coexist peacefully with dimensional creatures. Zhou Wen had previously heard of it, but Luyi was a county under Guide City. Zhou Wen had never been there, so he had never entered Laojun Platform.

“In that case, Laojun Platform is indeed very suitable for establishing a human city. Is the space there big enough?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Space in Laojun Platform wasn’t too big, but after it became a dimensional zone, it expanded. It shouldn’t be a problem to house a million people.” Yu Qiubai sighed and continued, “However, I’ve already said that there’s still a problem with Laojun Platform. If we don’t resolve this problem, it’s useless even if we build a city there. No one will dare live there.”

“The killing prohibition isn’t the problem you are talking about?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He had never heard of any other taboos in Laojun Platform.

“Of course not. That condition is extremely beneficial to humans, so how can it be a problem? If that’s the case, people would have long fled to seek refuge there. However, in fact, no one dares to head to Laojun Platform,” Yu Qiubai said.

“Why’s that?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Because Laojun Platform has been occupied by a dimensional creature that doesn’t abide by its rules. That dimensional creature can kill as it pleases without being punished. Any human who dares enter has been wiped out by it, so no one dares to enter.” Yu Qiubai sighed. “If we wish to build a city here, we have to kill that dimensional creature or chase it out.” “Why don’t I know that? When did that dimensional creature appear? What does it look like?” Zhou Wen was surprised.

At the very least, Laojun Platform was where Taishang Laojun had ascended. Although he didn’t know how true it was, could a place that was related to Taishang Laojun be destroyed by an ordinary dimensional creature? Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss.

Zhou Wen had a deep understanding of how terrifying Mount Laojun was either way. Laojun Platform was somewhat similar to Mount Laojun. Zhou Wen felt that the dimensional creature that could wreak havoc there wasn’t simple.

“I don’t dare to enter. I heard from others that the dimensional creature looks very strange. It looks like a cross between a lion or tiger, but not exactly so. It has scales all over its body like the legendary Qilin. It’s more than three meters tall and moves like the wind. No one can escape its bite.” Yu Qiubai told Zhou Wen all the information he had gathered.

However, the information he gathered was from a few survivors. It likely didn’t differ from the ground truth.

Zhou Wen thought carefully for a while, but he couldn’t figure out the origins of the dimensional creature. He only felt that since a person could see it, its level couldn’t be too high.

Could it be that the abilities of that dimensional creature are similar to my Dao Sutra? It can crack taboo powers, so it can kill as it pleases at Mount Laojun? Zhou Wen guessed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to head to Laojun Platform to take a look. Since ordinary people had a chance of escaping, even if he couldn’t beat the opponent, escaping shouldn’t be a problem for him.

The situation was dire. There were still hundreds of thousands of people in Guide City who had nowhere to go. They couldn’t just stay outside the school all night. Things would go wrong once the food and water ran out.

He had to find a place to settle them down as soon as possible and get them to have something to do. At the very least, he had to provide them with their meals. Otherwise, once something went wrong, it would be difficult to clean up the mess.

Yu Qiubai returned to school after a discussion to stabilize the situation with those people. Those who signed the contract were given priority. He would employ a divide and conquer strategy, by giving carrots to some and using the stick on others. He didn’t want to cause too much of a conflict. Regardless, he had to persist until Zhou Wen found a suitable dimensional zone.

Zhou Wen rushed to Laojun Platform alone. Before he left, he handed Chick to Yu Qiubai. Chick would be able to hold the fort if anything really happened as long as no Calamity-grade entity interfered.

The distance between regions increased significantly as Earth’s dimensionalization deepened, but Luyi was very close to begin with, so Zhou Wen didn’t spend much time reaching Laojun Platform.

From afar, Laojun Platform looked like a paradise on earth. There were buildings made of green bricks and tiles amidst the white clouds, making it look like a fairyland.

There were many buildings along the periphery of Laojun Platform that came under the dimensional zone.

Zhou Wen could only see the outline of the buildings outside, but he couldn’t see what was inside.

When he arrived at the entrance of the dimensional zone, Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to enter. He first circled the area, hoping to find the tiny palm symbol.
