Chapter 1050: Only Defeat Is Allowed

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen was also somewhat worried. Although he had quite a number of Mythical Companion Beasts, it was somewhat difficult to gather twenty-four. Furthermore, he definitely needed to send his signature Companion Beasts in that situation.

What should I do? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

With the principle of stalling for time, Zhou Wen first got the Companion Beasts that could fight to stall for time before slowly thinking of a solution.

...

“According to the principle of being able to issue another challenge after twenty-four hours, he still has one Companion Beast after the Invisibility Cloak. The Companion Beasts after that won’t reach the twenty-four hour requirement. Therefore, new Companion Beasts need to be sent to battle. Otherwise, he can only give up on occupying first place on the rankings,” An Sheng said as he did the math.

“It’s a meaningless move to begin with. So what if he can continue dominating the rankings? The final unlimited challenge has already been decided. It’s impossible to obtain first place with this method,” An Tianzuo said.

...

Everyone was discussing what the Golden Battle God Halberd’s owner would do next. Would he release a new Companion Beast or end the domination of the rankings?

Most people felt that it was meaningless to let Companion Beasts continue occupying first place. The dimension wouldn’t give ordinary Companion Beasts the chance to win by trickery.

This period of time was a torture for everyone. Everyone wanted to know what the owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd would do after the rules changed.

The various media outlets also wrote all sorts of analysis articles. Most of the media felt that there was no need to continue after the rules were changed. Even if the owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd had other Mythical Companion Beasts, it was meaningless to continue if they couldn’t maintain the full 24-hour cycle.

And to achieve a 24-hour cycle, it required at least 24 Mythical Companion Beasts. At present, only the six hero families had such strength.

However, up to now, no family clan had stepped forward to admit that the Golden Battle God Halberd’s dominance of the rankings was their doing.

Time quickly passed as everyone waited in anticipation.

...

Zhou Wen was also racking his brains to think of a solution. Zhong Ziya had made it sound so serious. He had to think of a way to survive the remaining twenty plus hours.

Torch Dragon, Behemoth, Tai Sui, Great Might Vajra Bull, Galaxy Shell Dragon, and other Companion Beasts I have are too iconic. As long as I use them, everyone will definitely guess that it’s me. Furthermore, exposing all my important combat strength will be very disadvantageous for me. However, other than that, what other way can I stall for time? After some thought, Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up as he summoned Demonic Neonate.

Demonic Neonate looked at Zhou Wen quietly. It wasn’t that she lacked intelligence, but she didn’t like to speak. Even when facing Zhou Wen, she remained silent.

“Neonate, how’re your food reserves?” Zhou Wen was naturally referring to Grim Demon.

After Grim Demon devoured the corpse the last time, it seemed to have evolved. However, as there was no information on Grim Demon in-game, he didn’t know if he had completed his evolution.

Demonic Neonate didn’t say a word. All she did was summon the Demonic Sword and pull it out of its scabbard. With a casual shake, Grim Demon flew out of the sword.

“Grim Demon, long time no see. Come, sit down and have a drink. Let’s have a good chat,” Zhou Wen said with a smile as he waved at Grim Demon.

Grim Demon was extremely shrewd. From Zhou Wen’s expression, he knew that Zhou Wen needed his help. He immediately put on the airs of a boss and raised his chin slightly as he looked at Zhou Wen in contempt. “What’s the matter? Tell me and let me consider it...”

As he spoke, he suddenly broke out into a cold sweat. He hurriedly turned his head and saw Demonic Neonate looking at him. Her arrogant look immediately turned into a fawning one. He lowered his head and bent his waist as he said to Zhou Wen with a smile, “Feel free to tell me if you need anything. I’ll definitely help you settle it.”

Zhou Wen nodded and sized up Grim Demon before asking, “How’s your current strength? Do you have the strength of a Terror-grade?”

When Grim Demon heard Zhou Wen’s question, he immediately felt smug. “What kind of existence am I, Grim Demon? Of course, I have the strength of a Terror-grade. Ignoring the Terror-grade, if I hadn’t been suppressed for so long, even a Calamity-grade creature wouldn’t be a problem...”

“Not bad.” Zhou Wen nodded.

“Not... bad...” When Grim Demon heard that and looked at Zhou Wen’s expression, he had the urge to immediately use his Terror Transformation powers to rip him to shreds, letting him know that the dignity of a Terror-grade expert couldn’t be violated.

However, when he saw Demonic Neonate, Grim Demon’s words changed. “You’re right. My standard is indeed only not bad... It’s alright...”

“Then that’s it. You can head on up for the challenge later,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the cube beside him.

Grim Demon’s eyes lit up when he saw the cube. He immediately became ambitious as he said loudly, “Don’t worry. Now that I’ve recovered a lot of my strength, defeating those brats and getting first place won’t be difficult. It’s time to let those new brats know how powerful their Grim Demon ancestor is.”

Zhou Wen nodded and said, “That’s good. After you go up, try your best to stall for time. Only defeat is allowed.”

“Alright, I’ll definitely kill everyone. Only defeat is ... What...” After Grim Demon figured out his condition, he widened his eyes and looked at Zhou Wen. It was almost as though something had gone wrong with his ears.

“The Companion Beasts on it are mine. Is there a problem?” Zhou Wen asked Grim Demon.

“Can I... not go...” Grim Demon suppressed the urge to smash Zhou Wen into smithereens and asked humbly.

He was Grim Demon, yet he had to be defeated by such a weak Companion Beast. Grim Demon felt that it was a huge insult to him. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What do you think?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he glanced at Demonic Neonate.

Grim Demon subconsciously glanced at Demonic Neonate with Zhou Wen before immediately making up his mind. He swore to Zhou Wen, “It’s my honor to work for you. I’ll definitely do my best and lose flawlessly.”

“There’s no need for you to be flawless, nor do you need to fight. Just go up and stall for time. Stall for as long as you can. When I get Demonic Neonate to inform you, just admit defeat yourself.” Zhou Wen recounted his request in detail.

The changes in the rules of the dimensional creatures were targeted at Companion Beasts, but Guardians weren’t included.

If Grim Demon took the challenge, he wouldn’t have to abide by the rules of having a victor within an hour.

I want to see how those dimension assholes will change the rules. Are they going to restrict Guardians as well? Zhou Wen thought.

This was clearly impossible. If elimination of both sides happened when Guardians couldn’t decide a victor in an hour, things would probably happen in the final battle.

Soon, the one-hour countdown arrived. Everyone looked at the cube’s big screen and waited for the Golden Battle God Halberd’s owner to make a decision.
