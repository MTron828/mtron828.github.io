Chapter 1279: Isn’t the Terror-grade Enough?

Translator: CKtalon

As he had already cultivated two spatial-type Essence Energy Arts, Zhou Wen was rather familiar with spatial powers. It could even be said that he was adept in it.

Although he had never come into contact with Absolute Space before, Zhou Wen was quickly able to master it after understanding its circulation method. Furthermore, he rapidly improved.

In just a day, Absolute Space that was originally the size of a chicken egg had already reached the size of a cubic meter. Furthermore, the space inside had already reached hundreds of times the size of the outside world.

What looked like a distance of a meter was in fact, entering a space a few hundred meters across. A corporeal object had to travel the same distance in Absolute Space.

A few hundred meters was enough to fight ordinary opponents, but to fight a Calamity-grade expert, that was still lacking.

To the speed of light, a few hundred meters wasn’t much different from a few thousand meters. Zhou Wen had to think of a way to extend Absolute Space even further to slow the Calamity-grade’s attack by a tiny bit so that he could dodge it.

In the next few days, Zhou Wen constantly pondered over how to make Absolute Space stronger. However, when the ratio between Absolute Space and an actual distance reached about a thousand, he was unable to improve further.

Zhou Wen knew that he had reached a bottleneck. The bottleneck of a divine skill had to exceed the Mythical stage in order to continue growing and strengthen Absolute Space.

Li Xuan had nothing better to do, so he came to chat with Zhou Wen. Seeing Zhou Wen’s worried frown, he asked curiously, “I seldom see such an expression on your face. What happened?”

“I’m thinking about how to raise a skill’s level and make it stronger,” Zhou Wen answered.

“That’s very easy. Just train more and think more.” As Li Xuan spoke, he asked, “What skill do you want to raise? What level is the skill originally at? Tell me and I’ll help you think of a solution.”

“Spatial-type. It’s now at the Mythical stage,” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s indeed very difficult to advance a Mythical skill. Furthermore, it’s a spatial-type that’s very difficult to begin with. It’s no wonder you are fretting. In that case, I have a solution. Go to dimensional zones with spatial creatures and fight them. Experience their spatial powers more and you might be able to gain some insight and break through to the Terror grade.” Li Xuan shared his experience. He had been constantly fighting, getting beaten, and being tortured for the past five years, allowing him to have his present achievements.

Zhou Wen sighed and said, “It’s not difficult to advance to the Terror grade. It will only take two more days, but I’m afraid that a Terror-grade skill won’t meet my requirements. It will be difficult to advance further.”

Li Xuan’s face darkened as he said gloomily, “Is this how you chat? Even a Terror-grade skill isn’t enough for you? Why don’t you just drop dead!”

“There’s nothing I can do about it. If I want to clear the Venusian dimensional zone, I have to master this skill,” Zhou Wen said.

“You want to use this spatial skill to dodge the Calamity-grade bullet?” Li Xuan guessed what Zhou Wen was up to.

Zhou Wen nodded and said, “This is the only way to reach the Golden Palace before being killed by the Calamity-grade bullet.”

“Then take your time training. I don’t know how to push your skill to the Calamity grade. Speaking of which, your level should only be at the Mythical stage, right?” Li Xuan said.

“Sigh, it’s indeed difficult.” Zhou Wen also knew that his level was too low. If he was at the Terror grade, there might be a chance of advancing Absolute Space to the Calamity grade.

Zhou Wen was also frustrated over this. If the Terror-grade Absolute Space couldn’t meet his requirements, it would probably be difficult for him to advance to the Calamity-grade.

However, Zhou Wen still had no clue about his advancement to the Terror grade. His four stats were already at 81 points and the eight Essence Energy Arts had already reached the Terror transformation stage, but Slaughterer didn’t stir. He couldn’t attain Terror transformation at all.

“If one needs to kill to advance, what kind of reasoning could it be that I didn’t get any reaction when I’ve already killed a Calamity-grade creature? Must I kill a Guardian?” Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that things weren’t that simple.

“Fat chance.” A man’s voice sounded as An Sheng accompanied An Tianzuo into the yard. The person who had spoken was An Tianzuo.

An Tianzuo wasn’t far from the yard. His hearing was excellent, so he had heard Li Xuan and Zhou Wen’s conversation clearly. He knew that Zhou Wen wanted to advance a Mythical skill to the Calamity grade, and it was a spatial one at that. Therefore, he made that statement to himself. Although he wasn’t speaking to Zhou Wen, anyone could tell that he was talking about him.

Zhou Wen pretended not to hear him and ignored An Tianzuo. He looked at An Sheng and asked, “Ah Sheng, why are you so free? Why are you here?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Young Master Wen, here’s the situation. Overseer and I have been purchasing Essence Crystal ores recently. You also know how much that thing needs Essence Crystals. We have already acquired most of the Essence Crystals on the market. Even if the other families have the goods, they will just hold back on selling to sell them at a higher price in this situation. It’s impossible for them to easily sell them to us. Therefore, Overseer and I plan on heading out to open up a dimensional zone that might have an Essence Crystal mine.”

Ah Sheng paused for a moment before saying, “You know the situation in Luoyang recently. All the major factions are watching us. I don’t know how many spies are in the city. If anything happens when we are out, there has to be a person at home to take care of everything. Do you think it’s convenient for you to temporarily take care of the family?”

“How long will it take?” Zhou Wen asked after some thought.

If he wanted to watch over the area, he definitely couldn’t leave Luoyang before Ah Sheng and company returned.

“That’s hard to say. We will return in a week or so at the earliest. If something crops up, it’s hard to say. We’ll try our best to rush back in a month,” Ah Sheng said.

“A month!” Zhou Wen frowned slightly. If any creature entered the Venusian dimensional zone in a month, he wouldn’t be able to take advantage of it.

“Ah Sheng, tell him not to force himself if he doesn’t want to,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.

An Tianzuo was standing just beside him, so Zhou Wen could naturally hear him. An Tianzuo also knew this, but he refused to speak directly to Zhou Wen.

“What Overseer means is that if you have something to do, there’s no need to force yourself. We can think of another solution. It’s just that Madam feels that we should rely on ourselves and not have outsiders come here.” An Sheng passed the message. It sounded the same as what An Tianzuo had said, but the feeling was completely different.

“Please help me inform the Overseer that if he wants me to stay, I definitely won’t force myself. However, this matter concerns Sis Lan and my father, so I won’t ignore it,” Zhou Wen said.

“Overseer, Young Master Wen said that he’s Madam’s son. He will definitely take care of Madam and won’t let anything happen to the family..” An Sheng wiped the sweat off his forehead as he translated.
