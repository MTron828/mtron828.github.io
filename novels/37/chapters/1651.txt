Chapter 1652 Dead

The Companion Beast continued persisting as it shot out Treasurefall Money repeatedly, but it couldn’t eliminate the power it was affected

by.

The Treasurefall Money that flew out was easily dodged by the suona-blowing bee.

Bang!

With another loud bang, the Companion Beast’s other leg knelt on the ground. Its hands pressed down on the shattered ground as it bared its teeth and struggled with all its might, but it was unable to get up no matter what.

Its eyes were already distorted as tears poured down.

A strange scene also happened-black flames began to rise from the Companion Beast’s white jade-like body.

Every inch of its body seemed to emit a transparent black gas. The black gas was indiscernible as though it was a death aura that came from the Netherworld. It emitted an ominous aura.

As the black gas rose, the extremely powerful Companion Beast’s vitality rapidly drained. Even its Essence Energy rapidly weakened. The body that looked like it was carved from white jade was also aging and shriveling. In just a moment, the Companion Beast’s body looked like it was about to turn from a youth to an old man. Its jade-like body was covered in wrinkles. The original white color gradually turned yellow, like the color of old newspapers that had been through the ravages of time.

Zhou Wen and company were alarmed when they saw this. They were secretly glad that they hadn’t knelt down. Otherwise, they would already be dead.

However, even if the Musical Note Sprites could temporarily resist the bee’s suona, Zhou Wen and company still couldn’t escape. Once the Companion Beast died, it would probably be their turn.

Although Zhou Wen had already decided to place a bet on the bee, he wasn’t confident when he saw the situation. He even had the intention of helping the Companion Beast stall for time by keeping it in check.

However, Zhou Wen ultimately gave up on this idea. The army of Musical Note Sprites wasn’t really able to resist the suona. Even if he was willing to help the Companion Beast, he might not be able to provide much help. Instead, he might anger the bee.

Perhaps the bee hadn’t wanted their lives at first, but by giving a hand, he might end up making things worse.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen had other plans. If the bee really wanted them dead, Zhou Wen would definitely end up kneeling.

His Life Providence was unlikely to sit idle. After all, this wasn’t him kneeling, but being forced to kneel. With Sigh of the King’s temper, how could it tolerate such a thing?

As for whether the Sigh of the King could withstand the suona’s music, that wasn’t something Zhou Wen knew. When the time came, he could only leave it to fate.

“From the looks of it, we are most likely going to die here today.” Jiuyang glanced at Zhou Wen and said, “I don’t have any pursuits or wishes in my life. My only regret is not being able to personally defeat you.” “Why are you still thinking about that at a time like this? It’s best if you think about how to stay alive.” Zhou Wen was somewhat speechless. What kind of person was he? At this point in time, he was still thinking about such matters.

“It’s precisely because it’s difficult to tell if we’ll live. We might die immediately. If I don’t make things clear now, I won’t die happy,” Jiuyang said.

Zhou Wen thought to himself, Who cares if you’re happy when you’re dead? I’ve never heard of anyone who would be happy dying. “Xiao, do you have any ideas?” Zhou Wen ignored Jiuyang and turned to look at Xiao.

Xiao frowned and pondered for a moment before saying with a serious expression, “Just say whatever you want to say. It might be a form of release.”

Zhou Wen was rendered even more speechless, but on second thought, he asked Jiuyang and Xiao, “Since we’re about to die, can you tell me if Ouyang Ting, who you captured, is still alive? Why did you capture him?” Zhou Wen’s gaze was mainly trained on Jiuyang. He felt that this fellow was rather reliable. At this moment, he might even tell the truth. As for Xiao, Zhou Wen didn’t dare believe his words even at the moment of death.

“Alive. Don’t ask me anything else. I don’t know,” Jiuyang said.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be delighted when he saw that Jiuyang didn’t seem to be lying. As long as he was still alive, there was still a chance of rescuing him in the future. Furthermore, from Jiuyang’s words, Xiao seemed to know more. Therefore, he cast his gaze at Xiao.

Xiao said expressionlessly, “Even if I die, I’ll take matters related to the Holy Land to the grave. Furthermore, we might not die.”

“Do you have a solution?” Jiuyang and Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“It’s very simple. As long as that bee doesn’t want us dead, we naturally won’t have to die,” Xiao said indifferently.

“There’s no need for you to tell me that. I know it too.” Zhou Wen was somewhat exasperated. All he could do was ask Jiuyang, “Jiuyang, where do you Saints come from? Why are you so loyal to the Holy Land? Have you never thought that the Holy Land is enslaving your kind?”

Jiuyang shook his head and said, “The so-called same kind are just unfamiliar lifeforms. What’s the difference between them and other unknown creatures? What has their lives got to do with us?”

Although Zhou Wen didn’t agree with Jiuyang’s theory, from Jiuyang’s point of view, what he said made sense.

Saints had been nurtured by the Holy Land since they were young. Their living environment was different from ordinary humans, so it was normal for them to not identify with humanity.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to ask something, he suddenly heard a long roar. He saw the Companion Beast roaring at the sky. As for its body, it had already reached its limits. What flowed out of its eyes weren’t tears, but blood from its body. Furthermore, the blood had already dried up.

This was a Companion Beast. If it were an ordinary dimensional creature, it might have long died. After this long roar, the Companion Beast completely lost its resistance. It was yanked by the power of the music as its head slammed into the ground as though it was kowtowing.

With this kowtow, its body instantly disintegrated. Most of its body transformed into black gas that rose up and condensed in the air in its Companion Beast shape. Then, it slowly rose into the sky and slowly dissipated.

Something dropped from where the Companion Beast was. The strange crystal had many faces. A few of them had strange patterns engraved on them.

Zhou Wen found the patterns rather familiar. On careful look, one of the patterns was Treasurefall Money. Another symbol was the electromagnetic monster. A few of the faces had lines without a complete pattern. However, the concepts contained in the lines were vaguely similar to Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal and Xiao’s Trajectory Art.

Is this the Companion Beast’s Calamity-grade essence? Zhou Wen stared at the crystal and thought.
