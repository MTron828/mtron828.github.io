Chapter 1157: Tsukuyomi’s Performance

Translator: CKtalon

An Jing and company were dumbfounded. The entire An family residence was silent.

With the An family’s defense, with such a huge commotion, the troops and hidden forces should have long rushed into the hall, but there was no movement at all.

The dark yard was dead silent. The night was terrifyingly dark, as though a dark behemoth was entrenched in the An residence.

The sound of wings flapping was heard. Almost at the same time, Daitengu landed in the living room. It retracted its wings and bowed at Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen. “Your Majesty, Prince Consort. Greetings from your subject, Daitengu.”

An Jing and company had naturally heard of the name ‘Daitengu.’ Legend had it that it was formed after an emperor died. It had a very high status in a particular country’s pantheon.

Is this really the legendary Daitengu? An Jing’s body trembled as she looked at the Daitengu that resembled a winged devil. It looked very similar to the legendary depiction.

Even if it wasn’t the legendary Daitengu, just its ability to appear out of thin air made it an extremely powerful existence. Without a doubt, it was at the Terror grade.

Boom! Boom!

Before An Jing could figure out if it was really Daitengu, she suddenly heard a strange sound as though a behemoth had stepped into An Manor.

Soon, she saw a strange temple appear in front of the living room. The strange temple seemed to have a life of its own. Its open door was pitch-black like the mouth of a terrifying monster.

“Your Majesty, Prince Consort. Greetings from your subject, Noderabō.” The temple rumbled as it landed in front of the hall. A ghastly voice sounded.

An ethereal sound of a stringed instrument came from the side door. Umibōzu carried his lute as he walked. After arriving in the hall, he bowed slightly at Tsukuyomi and Zhou Wen. “Your Majesty, Prince Consort. Greetings from your subject, Umibōzu.”

In a moment, four terrifying dimensional creatures appeared. Furthermore, there were layers of ghostly shadows in the distance, as though countless ghosts were heading their way.

An Sheng and An Jing’s strength were extraordinary. They could sense that the strength of those creatures was extremely terrifying. They were definitely not ordinary Mythical creatures.

An Tianzuo didn’t look at Yuki Onna and company. He only stared coldly at Tsukuyomi. He had already guessed Tsukuyomi’s identity when Yuki Onna appeared. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Without a doubt, Tsukuyomi wasn’t a real human, but a Calamity creature that had appeared overseas. Only she could control so many terrifying creatures.

An Jing and An Sheng naturally thought the same. Their eyes were filled with horror as they looked at Tsukuyomi. No one expected the woman who had returned with Zhou Wen to be a Calamity creature that had appeared overseas.

Don’t tell me she wants to trigger the Ghost Parade in the An family? An Jing felt extremely uneasy.

If it was really as Tsukuyomi had said, with more than a hundred Terror creatures gathered here, once violence erupted, the entire Luoyang City would probably suffer.

“Tsukuyomi, that’s enough. We are eating. Let them return,” Zhou Wen said with a frown.

When Tsukuyomi heard Zhou Wen’s words, she was surprisingly gentle. She didn’t retort him and obediently waved her hand. Yuki Onna, Daitengu, and the other Terror creatures instantly retreated and vanished into the darkness. As for the An family, they returned to normal as the lights lit up again.

The guards outside didn’t seem to know what had happened. They were still patrolling as usual.

An Tianzuo’s brows relaxed when he saw that everyone was fine.

“Let’s sit down for the meal.” Zhou Wen secretly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Tsukuyomi dismiss the dimensional creatures.

If they really came to blows, even if he could use the Immortal Culling Sword to kill Tsukuyomi, the An family and Luoyang would suffer heavy losses.

Tsukuyomi seemed to have changed into a different person today. She was especially gentle and obedient as she picked up the bowl and chewed slowly. However, her present appearance was completely different from before in the eyes of An Jing and company.

A Calamity creature treated Zhou Wen’s words like an imperial edict. It was just too shocking.

Only each individual knew what they were feeling while having this meal.

“I’m full. I wish to get some rest.” Tsukuyomi looked at Zhou Wen as though she was asking for his opinion.

“Return first.” After Zhou Wen said that, Tsukuyomi got up and left.

After Tsukuyomi left, the atmosphere immediately relaxed. An Sheng whispered, “Young Master Wen, is she really the one who appeared overseas...”

Zhou Wen nodded and said helplessly, “Yes.”

“Young Master Wen, pretty amazing. Even a Calamity-grade creature listens to you. Could it be that you’ve already advanced to the Calamity grade?” An Sheng asked.

Although An Sheng, An Tianzuo, and company knew that Zhou Wen was Human Sovereign, they could also tell that Zhou Wen had relied on the power of the sword to defeat Di Tian, not because Zhou Wen had advanced to the Calamity grade.

An Jing and An Tianzuo also looked at Zhou Wen. They clearly wanted to know what level Zhou Wen had reached to make a Calamity-grade creature be so submissive.

Tsukuyomi didn’t seem to go against Zhou Wen’s wishes.

Zhou Wen shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “I’m still at the Mythical stage. I’m still very far from the Calamity grade. As for Tsukuyomi, I can’t explain it for the time being. It’s a long story.”

An Sheng naturally didn’t believe him. He said with a smile, “To be able to make a Calamity-grade creature listen to you, I also want to give such a long story a try.”

Zhou Wen couldn’t explain it clearly. No one would believe that a Calamity creature insisted on marrying him.

After the meal, Zhou Wen took Ya’er back.

Chick and antelope also followed, seemingly without much reluctance.

“Overseer, it looks like we don’t have to worry about Young Master Wen’s safety. Even a Calamity-grade creature acts so obedient towards him. Even if Young Master Wen hasn’t really advanced to the Calamity grade, he’s definitely much stronger than before. It won’t be easy for the League of Guardians to touch him,” An Sheng said.

“Have we ever been worried about his safety?” An Tianzuo said indifferently, “Furthermore, just as he said, his strength hasn’t reached the Calamity grade. He hasn’t even reached the Terror grade. Tsukuyomi must have another reason for following him. It might not be a good thing.”

“Tsukuyomi doesn’t seem to have any ill intentions towards Young Master Wen,” An Sheng said.

“Not having any ill intentions doesn’t mean anything. You still have to continue with the previous arrangements. It’s not time for wishful thinking,” An Tianzuo said.

“Overseer, don’t worry. I’ll do my best.” An Sheng stood up and saluted solemnly.

An Jing sat by the side and ate without saying a word. She originally imagined that she had grown a lot in the past five years, but now, she suddenly realized that her growth was nothing in front of Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen returned to his room and realized that Tsukuyomi was waiting for him.

Upon seeing Zhou Wen return, Tsukuyomi blinked and asked, “How was my performance?”

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“My performance at the banquet, of course. Didn’t you humans say that a good wife has to give her husband face in front of outsiders? Was what I did considered giving you enough face? Was I considered a good wife?” Tsukuyomi asked Zhou Wen.
