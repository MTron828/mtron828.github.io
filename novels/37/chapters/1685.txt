Chapter 1686 Emperor Star

Starlady Polestar seemed to be an imperial monarch that had existed since ancient times. She looked down at all living beings from the top of the twelve celestial palaces as though everything in the world was just a toy beneath her hands.

“The heavens fall when an emperor is born. All fate lies in the twelve palaces. No life in the world can defy them.” Looking at Truth Listener that defied the heavens, Starlady Polestar slashed with the black ice sword in her hand lightly. The twelve celestial palaces came crashing down as though the universe was suppressed beneath them.

The tiny Truth Listener was like a drop in the ocean beneath the twelve celestial palaces. It was almost negligible.

However, Truth Listener’s eyes burned like a golden sun. It didn’t dodge at all, nor did it hesitate. Its golden body burned as it extended its arm to its limits and threw a punch at the celestial palaces that came crashing from the sky.

Boom!

A mysterious celestial palace that represented fate was torn apart by Truth Listener’s fist as its wreckage fell in all directions.

Truth Listener was like an overlord that defied the heavens. It ran amok and faced the heavens with an unstoppable might as it continued charging into the sky.

Booms sounded incessantly as Zhou Wen saw mysterious, unfathomable palaces that seemed to have the ability to suppress fate being penetrated by Truth Listener, turning into wreckage that filled the sky. The scene was shocking, making him feel an inexplicable sense of fear. At the same time, a ball of flames seemed to burn in his heart as his blood seemed to boil.

If the heavens destroy me, I will defy the heavens. If the emperor slays me, I will kill the emperor. No one in the world can control my fate.

In Zhou Wen’s eyes, Truth Listener was like an ancient god of war who disrespected the world and didn’t worship the supernatural. It used its body to desecrate divine might as it shattered all the celestial palaces.

When every celestial palace was shattered, cracks appeared on the black ice sword in Starlady Polestar’s hand.

Starlady Polestar could still maintain her composure when a few celestial palaces were shattered in the beginning. However, as she watched the celestial palaces shatter one after another while Truth Listener continued tearing through the air with an indomitable force, the look in Starlady Polestar’s eyes behind her mask gradually turned into shock.

When the last celestial palace was shattered by Truth Listener, Starlady Polestar’s body trembled as the black ice sword in her hand shattered, turning into fragments of ice that scattered in all directions./

Truth Listener arrived in front of Starlady Polestar that very moment. The fist burning with golden flames blasted at her unreasonably. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The twelve celestial palaces shattered as Starlady Polestar’s aura declined to its nadir. She held the damaged sword and slashed at Truth Listener’s fist with all her might. However, at the instant the fist collided with the sword, the damaged sword shattered. The fist that emitted golden light struck her chest.

The black ice-like armor scattered like butterflies, revealing Starlady Polestar’s beautiful body and face. Her face was as beautiful as a goddess’s, making it impossible for anyone to desecrate her.

However, Truth Listener’s fist mercilessly struck the beautiful face, instantly blasting it apart. The beautiful head that was like a work of art exploded as blood bloomed like the petals of a chrysanthemum flower.

Starlady Polestar’s headless body fell from the sky after her head exploded from the punch, turning into specks of profound light that dissipated. Only a strange crystal fell to the ground, emitting a resplendent starlight like the eternal north star in the sky.

‘Killed Calamity creature, Starlady Polestar. Discovered Emperor Star Crystal.’

He really killed her! Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised as he looked at Truth Listener that resembled an ancient god in the sky. Truth Listener’s strength shocked him.

As expected of a Heaven-level 999 Companion Beast. It’s so powerful and violent. Zhou Wen reached out to pick up the Emperor Star Crystal on the ground and looked at its stats in pleasant surprise.

Emperor Star Crystal: Emperor’s Life Star. Can obtain the help of the world.

Zhou Wen looked at the simple information and was momentarily at a loss.

Without a doubt, this Emperor Star Crystal was likely the treasure of this hidden dungeon, but it was difficult to understand what use it had.

From the literal meaning, it should be saying that an emperor was the world’s chosen one, so his Life Providence was extremely honorable. Even the world would help him.

But how was such a thing used?

Could it be that this thing can make the person who possesses it become the chosen one? From then on, everything will be smooth sailing. I can get whatever I want. Just killing a random monster will drop a divine artifact. Not only will I not die from jumping off a cliff, but I can bump into fortuitous encounters? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall the legend of an ancient emperor.

Legend had it that there was a chosen one who fought for the throne with a figure comparable to a transmigrator. This chosen one was originally forced to retreat in defeat and was about to be destroyed. However, to his surprise, a meteor descended from the sky and destroyed the enemy’s army, making him the final victor. The only explanation was that he was the chosen one.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare hope for such luck. He only hoped that he wouldn’t be too unlucky.

He attempted to absorb the Emperor Crystal, but he received feedback that he wasn’t a Companion Beast and couldn’t use it.

Holy sh*t, is this thing for Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen was rendered speechless as his dream of getting whatever he wanted instantly shattered.

If only Companion Beasts can use it, who should I use it on? Demonic Neonate is still evolving. I can only choose another Companion Beast to use this thing. Zhou Wen was somewhat vexed. There was too little information on the Emperor Crystal, so he didn’t know what use it had. If he randomly gave it to a Companion Beast, the benefits it obtained might not be as strong as he had expected. It might even have the opposite effect.

If this thing was a treasure that changed Life Providences and changed the Life Providence that was most compatible with Companion Beasts, what was the use of having it gain an Emperor Life Providence?

In terms of combat strength, Truth Listener was Zhou Wen’s greatest combat strength. He naturally should give it good things, but as he didn’t know what effects the Emperor Crystal had, Zhou Wen didn’t dare take the risk with Truth Listener.

After some thought, Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth. This fellow had previously advanced to the Calamity grade and had two Life Providences—Endless Strength and Mountain River Absorption. Even if he changed one to a useless Life Providence, his combat strength wouldn’t weaken much.

Furthermore, its name had the word “tyrant” in it. It could barely be related to an emperor. Zhou Wen planned on using it to test the waters.

After Tyrant Behemoth was summoned, it swallowed the Emperor Crystal under Zhou Wen’s orders.

When the crystal entered its stomach, a blob of black starlight immediately bloomed from Tyrant Behemoth’s stomach. Soon, it enveloped Tyrant Behemoth’s entire body in black light, as though it had transformed into a black hole.

Zhou Wen only heard Tyrant Behemoth’s roar coming from the black hole. Soon, there was silence. Only the black hole-like light constantly distorted and changed.
