Chapter 72 Blood Replenishment Tea

“You don’t look fine.” Zhou Wen thought and said in enlightenment, “Are you afraid that I’ll take this opportunity to seek revenge? Don’t worry. Although I don’t think too highly of you, I wouldn’t harm you on account of Sister Lan and my dad. I’m just calling for a doctor.”

With that said, Zhou Wen continued calling the emergency hotline.

An Jing burned with anxiety and embarrassment as she shouted once more, “There’s no need. Really, there’s no need. I... I... I was having menstrual cramps... I’ll be fine after some rest... Leave... Don’t disturb my rest...”

An Jing had given that reason because she couldn’t think of anything else. She just wanted him to leave.

“I see. I’ve heard that women can be in great pain a few days a month, but I never expected it to be this bad.” Zhou Wen had lived alone from a young age and he didn’t have a mother Thus, he had little contact with women. When he was a little older, he began cultivating and hadn’t ever had a girlfriend. He knew almost nothing about such matters.

Although he remained suspicious, Zhou Wen believed that it was unlikely that she would play games with her life.

“I’m really sorry. I’ll leave now,” Zhou Wen said in embarrassment before he turned to leave An Jing’s room.

An Jing heaved a sigh of relief when she saw him leave. The pain she was experiencing also seemed to lessen significantly.

“Women sure have it tough. Fortunately, I’m a man. I don’t have to endure such pain every month,” Zhou Wen mumbled to himself as he returned to his residence.

However, on second thought, he realized that he had it tough as well. He had endless noise blaring into his ears like an irritating chant when he slept. He also had to lose large amounts of blood daily. It was especially so this time. To incubate Truth Listener, he had lost at least 500-600 cc of blood. He didn’t have it good either.

I bought some brown sugar and wolfberries last time, and I’ve no idea if it will work. I might as well cook some to give it a try. My anemia has been pretty terrible recently. Zhou Wen scratched his forehead and thought to himself.

Returning to his room, Zhou Wen forgot the matter of making the blood-replenishment drink as he continued grinding.

This time, Zhou Wen entered the Ancient Imperial City dungeon. After killing the Skeleton General, he had a Skeleton General Companion Egg drop.

However, the stats weren’t comparable to the first one in every aspect. Zhou Wen directly fed it to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. As for Truth Listener, as there weren’t any hunger notifications, Zhou Wen didn’t know if it needed to be fed.

Switching to the Underground Buddha City, he no longer had any need to explore the Small Buddha Temple again since he had finished covering the area. He had slain the Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus in the lotus pond and it hadn’t spawned again.

Zhou Wen skipped the lotus pond and ventured deep into Underground Buddha City.

In the midst of his travels, he saw a few lotus ponds, but not every one of them had a Mutated Buddha Heart Lotus. After spending an entire day, only one ordinary Buddha Heart Lotus Companion Egg dropped.

Although the stats were relatively ordinary, it was a heart-type Companion Beast. Zhou Wen incubated it, planning on using its companion form to temporarily allow his heart to continue functioning if it was ever damaged.

After so many sleepless nights, Zhou Wen finally couldn’t take it. He switched off his phone and slept through to the next morning. Only then did Zhou Wen get up to cook the supplements, making a pot of brown-sugar, wolfberry tea.

“Zhou Wen, are you up? Today is matriculation day. Come on out and walk around.” Just as Zhou Wen finished brewing his tea, Li Xuan called.

“What’s there to see?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

“Today’s the matriculation day for the freshmen. Many clubs in school are recruiting freshmen. We can also take a look,” Li Xuan said with a chuckle.

“I have no interest in joining any clubs.” Zhou Wen poured a cup of blood-replenishing tea and drank it.

“You don’t have to join one. You can take a look at all those beautiful female juniors and seniors.” Li Xuan revealed his true motives.

“Not interested.” Zhou Wen still planned on exploring Underground Buddha City.

“Don’t be so cold. There are benefits. The school will assign missions and most of them need to be completed by a team. The seniors already have their own teams. If we want to make a new team, we will have to recruit from the freshmen. To walk around now is also to prepare for the future...”

Li Xuan gave plenty of reasons that irritated Zhou Wen so much that he agreed to walk around campus.

After drinking a huge bowl of tea, Zhou Wen filled up a thermos and walked out of his place.

It just so happened that An Jing walked out at the same time. She couldn’t help but grit her teeth when she saw him. However, she was slightly taken aback when she saw the glass thermos in his hand.

She recognized it. There were wolfberries and other supplements in it and it was obvious that it was brewed with brown sugar. Her servants had previously prepared it for her.

Do you think you can bribe me with a cup of brown-sugared water? Men almost never drank this and after what happened yesterday, An Jing imagined that he had brewed it for her, hoping to warm up his relationship with her.

Although she had this in mind, the look in her eyes softened. She found Zhou Wen rather thoughtful and sensitive.

When Zhou Wen walked out of his yard, An Jing came out as well. He needed to walk past her to leave the compound.

She watched as Zhou Wen walked over, wondering if she should accept it if he were to give it to her.

Amidst her thoughts, he arrived in front of her and saw An Jing looking at him. He nodded at her gently as a greeting.

An Jing imagined that Zhou Wen was about to give her the tea when he nodded at her. She turned her head away slightly, waiting for him to hand it over.

To her surprise, Zhou Wen just walked past her with the thermos in hand. He had no intention of walking towards her. Furthermore, he even drank a mouthful while walking off.

“It seems to be a little too sweet,” Zhou Wen muttered to himself after taking one mouthful.

An Jing’s face burned as her eyes nearly spewed flames.

Zhou Wen hadn’t paid any attention to her and walked straight out of Four Seasons Garden.

Why don’t you die from an overdose drinking something like that! An Jing clenched her teeth hatefully as she looked at his departing figure.

Today was matriculation day. However, Sunset College was unlike the typical school. There wasn’t any welcome ceremony or many decorations. Apart from the crowds, it didn’t seem any different from usual.

On the two sides of the road, there were two rows of tables neatly placed. There were banners and signs placed in front of themrecruitment notices of the school’s clubs.

Sunset College encouraged them to set up clubs, hoping that it could increase cooperation between students, especially when they entered dimensional zones to complete missions.

“Zhou Wen, I’m here.” Just as Zhou Wen was looking around, he heard Li Xuan’s voice from a particular club’s recruitment booth.

He looked over and found Li Weiyang and Li Xuan standing together, the former waving her hand at him.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
