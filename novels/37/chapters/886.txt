Chapter 887: Xu Ai

Translator: CKtalon

In the An family in Luoyang, Ouyang Lan pulled a girl and said, “Little Ai, stay here for a few more days. Don’t be in a rush to return.”

“That’s not too good, right?” Xu Ai said hesitantly.

“What’s wrong with that? Your mother and I were childhood friends. If your mother hadn’t gone so far away with her husband, I would have long taken you as my goddaughter. We are family, so you can rest assured and stay here. If you were to come to Luoyang and still stay outside, I really couldn’t face meeting your mother,” Ouyang Lan said with a smile.

“Sis Lan, I won’t stand on ceremony then,” Xu Ai said.

“Child, what’s there to be polite with me? Stay here for now. When Little Wen returns, I’ll introduce you to him. You are about the same age, so you should have something in common,” Ouyang Lan said with a smile. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Is Zhou Wen Uncle Lingfeng’s son?” Xu Ai asked.

Ouyang Lan nodded. “Although he’s Lingfeng’s son, his personality is completely different. He’s just too shy...”

After Xu Ai left, Ouyang Lan asked An Sheng, who was beside her, “Ah Sheng, what do you think of Little Ai and Little Wen? I think Little Ai is pretty good. She’s quite compatible with Little Wen.”

An Sheng thought for a moment and said, “Miss Xu is Old Master Xu’s daughter. The Xu family doesn’t have a son and only has two daughters. I heard that Xu Ai is especially doted on by Old Master Xu. Will they let her marry out?”

“Madam Xu and I are childhood friends. They are worried about Xu Ai marrying off to someone else’s family, but would they be worried about marrying into my family? You don’t have to worry about that. Just tell me if you think they are suitable,” Ouyang Lan said.

“Miss Xu is knowledgeable, gentle, and virtuous. She’s also very smart, so she’s naturally an excellent candidate,” An Sheng said.

Ouyang Lan glared at An Sheng. “Why are you beating around the bush when you’re talking to me? Do you think there’s something wrong with Xu Ai’s personality?”

An Sheng shook his head and said, “That’s not it. I just think that Miss Xu is a little too smart. I wonder if she can get along easily with a simple-minded person like Young Master Wen.”

Ouyang Lan said with a smile, “You don’t understand. It’s best to find a smart and scheming woman. With Little Wen’s straightforward personality, it’ll be impossible for him to coax a woman. It’ll probably be very difficult to find a silly woman. However, for a smart and sensible woman like Xu Ai, as long as she’s willing, she will think of a way to get Little Wen to coax her. Only then can they live on happily.”

“Madam, you’re right,” An Sheng echoed.

“When Little Wen comes back, let them meet first. I think Little Ai is quite a nice child.” Ouyang Lan thought for a moment and said, “We should have someone there, right?”

“We do,” An Sheng answered.

“Then let them investigate what hobbies Xu Ai usually has. It will also allow Little Wen to understand her better,” Ouyang Lan said.

“Yes, I’ll do it now.” An Sheng naturally understood that what Ouyang Lan wanted him to investigate wasn’t as simple as Xu Ai’s hobbies. Therefore, he didn’t dare be negligent.

The next morning, Xu Ai went to Luoyang’s dimensional zone. Her personal female guard followed her.

“Miss, we have successfully entered the An family. Should we act according to plan?” the female guard whispered when they arrived at an uninhabited spot in the dimensional zone.

“Don’t be anxious. Don’t be fooled by Ouyang Lan’s appearance. She won’t believe us so easily. We can’t rush this matter. Let’s stay in the An family for a while,” Xu Ai said.

“But Ouyang Lan seems to be trying to matchmake you with that Zhou Wen. That’s not very nice, right?” the female guard said.

“There’s nothing bad about it. If I’m unwilling, Ouyang Lan can’t force me, right? Besides, I want to meet Zhou Wen. I want to know what kind of person he is, considering he has caused so much trouble in the Federation alone,” Xu Ai said.

“It’s best to be careful. According to the information we obtained, the Xia family has suffered greatly because of him. The Cape family and the Family Clan of Gods seem to have suffered quite a blow because of him. It’s best not to come into contact with such a person if possible to prevent your identity from being exposed,” the female guard said.

“Don’t worry. It won’t be exposed. No one will expect that the Xu family’s second daughter, Xu Ai, is the master of the Great Skyfiend, Uesugi Nao,” Xu Ai said indifferently.

“In short, it’s better to be careful. After all, we aren’t overseas. Also, Miss, you are now the Xu family’s second daughter, Xu Ai. Don’t mention the other name in the Federation,” the female guard reminded again.

“I know.” Xu Ai nodded and didn’t say anything else.

As Zhou Wen traveled, he used his phone to explore Deer Terrace Pavilion. The space beneath Deer Terrace Pavilion was much bigger than he imagined. He encountered several Mythical creatures inside, but unfortunately, none of them dropped Companion Eggs.

He found quite a number of dimensional crystals, but not many could be used.

Now, Zhou Wen’s situation was rather awkward. He couldn’t absorb the Mythical dimensional crystals, and even if he could, they were useless.

Epic crystals were no longer of much use to him, so despite having so many dimensional crystals, he actually didn’t need much.

“Since I can’t use it myself, you guys are lucking out.” Zhou Wen summoned his main Companion Beasts, such as Tyrant Behemoth, Demonic Neonate, and the like. He got them to choose crystals and eat whatever they wanted.

Zhou Wen planned on seeing if the crystals here would respawn the next time he came. If they could, he would really be rich.

Explosive Fiend Man and Doctor Darkness were very interested in some of the Essence Energy Skill Crystals, but Demonic Neonate remained the same. The Mystical crystals were unable to move her. She usually only ate the Longevity Fruits, and there weren’t many of them left.

Tyrant Behemoth and Truth Listener weren’t picky with food. As long as they could provide energy, they would directly swallow most crystals.

Zhou Wen constantly searched Deer Terrace Pavilion. Apart from searching for the treasures there, he also wanted to see if he could find The Thearch’s true body.

He refused to believe that The Thearch was that flower.

When Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang, he still couldn’t find The Thearch’s true body under Deer Terrace Pavilion. The interior of Deer Terrace Pavilion was just too complicated. Zhou Wen had explored less than half of it.

According to the parts he had explored, Zhou Wen felt that there was definitely a Terror-grade existence inside Deer Terrace Pavilion. This was because he had already seen six Mythical dimensional creatures inside.

For dimensional zones like the Metalwork Temple, there was only one Mythical creature in the entire dimensional zone. Now, there were more than ten Mythical creatures found in the ancient buildings in Deer Terrace Pavilion. This was just too terrifying. It was definitely not something ordinary dimensional zones could compare with.

After returning to Luoyang, Zhou Wen planned on returning to school, but on the way, he suddenly saw a cube light up on the street. A Companion Beast had issued a challenge, so he took Ya’er to take a look.

“Coach, when did you return?” Just as Zhou Wen arrived near the cube, Feng Qiuyan, Sadie, and Gulli saw him. They waved as they squeezed over.
