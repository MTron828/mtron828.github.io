Chapter 1588: Regicide

Translator: CKtalon

Jiuyang had always believed that Zhou Wen had used some method to advance to the Calamity grade. Now, he suddenly realized that Zhou Wen was condensing a domain. Furthermore, it was completely different from what he had imagined. Zhou Wen seemed to be a pure-blooded human without using

any external help.

Can pure-blooded humans really reach this stage? Jiuyang looked at Zhou Wen with a complicated expression.

Godsfall’s expression was even more complicated. He didn’t have any blood left to vomit. Otherwise, he would’ve definitely vomited another three liters of blood.

He had lost his vitality from being struck by the lightning. Zhou Wen had been struck by the same lightning, but he ended up advancing to the Calamity grade. There was no justice in this world.

It shouldn’t be like this… It shouldn’t be like this… The resentment in Godsfall’s heart couldn’t be appeased. He used his last breath to order the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to kill Zhou Wen. Even if he couldn’t kill Zhou Wen, it was fine if he could interrupt his advancement to the Calamity grade.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General accepted the order and turned to look at Zhou Wen. The purple flames in his eyes constantly flickered, but he didn’t immediately rush over.

Godsfall believed that due to his severed vitality and how he was on his last breath that his connection with his Companion Beast had weakened. All he did was repeatedly urge the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General received Godsfall’s repeated orders, but it still didn’t charge at Zhou Wen.

He slowly turned around and walked towards Godsfall.

“You… What are you doing… I told you to kill him…” Godsfall roared at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. He didn’t know what had happened. Why would the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General walk to him? He had clearly ordered the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to kill Zhou Wen. Why would

the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General walk back?

Godsfall was puzzled. At the same time, he seemed to realize something, He immediately sensed the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s information again.

Malicious Evil… Heaven-defying Slaying… Jinxes Master… What kind of f*cking Companion Beast is this… Only then did Godsfall realize that something was amiss with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. Be it his Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, Terror transformation, Calamity Zone, or

skills, everything was very wrong.

Just looking at it might not be much, but when combined together, Godsfall felt a chill run down his spine.

He had never seen a Companion Beast with such evil and vile attributes. Together with the Heaven-defying Slaying zone and Jinxes Master skill, this deepened the chill running down his spine. He opened his mouth to seek help from Jiuyang.

However, just as he opened his mouth, the spear in the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s hand slashed across his neck. Godsfall’s head was sent flying.

This development stunned everyone. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Jiuyang never expected Godsfall to be killed by his Companion Beast. He looked at the Tiger Soul General with blood still dripping from his spear tip. His face was filled with shock.

“Carlos, am I dreaming? Wasn’t that Companion Beast snatched away by Godsfall? His owner should be Godsfall, right?” Youkai rubbed his eyes in disbelief.

“You aren’t dreaming. I saw it too. He’s indeed Godsfall’s Companion Beast and it has indeed killed him,” said Carlos with an odd expression.

“A Companion Beast killing its master? How can that be? Furthermore, once its master dies, it should be reduced to ashes, right?” Youkai’s mind was filled with question marks.

Godsfall’s head fell to the ground as his eyes nearly popped out. It was obvious how he couldn’t accept his death.

The Companion Beast tattoo on his body dissipated with his death, turning into Essence Energy that returned to the universe.

However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General remained standing proudly on his mount without any signs of dissipating.

This strange scene made everyone shudder. If Companion Beasts could kill their masters, then with so many Companion Beasts on them, they wouldn’t even know how they died if a Companion Beast attacked them one day. There was no way to defend against it.

The blob of light in the sky shrank as the domain power emitted from Zhou Wen’s body intensified. The restoration of the ancient city nearby sped up.

Ancient buildings were erected out of thin air, gradually restoring the ancient city to its original appearance.

Strange. Could it be that the Heaven-Opening Scripture’s domain is a Time Reversal Zone? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

The power displayed by the domain now was like reversing time, but the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder had nothing to do with temporal powers. From the beginning to now, he had never used a temporal item to advance.

No, it’s not temporal, Zhou Wen quickly realized the problem.

If it was a reversal of time, not only would the ancient city be restored, but everything inside would also be restored.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if there were any residents in the ancient city in the past, but there would definitely be creatures destroying it. If time flowed back, the creatures that destroyed the ancient city should have appeared in the reverse flow of time.

Now, only the ancient city was being restored. The creatures that had destroyed it didn’t appear. Furthermore, upon careful inspection, one would discover that many places in the domain hadn’t changed because of the domain’s power. Only the ancient city had changed.

‘What kind of domain is this? Zhou Wen kept sensing the domain’s power, but he still couldn’t understand what kind of domain it was.

The power of a domain was formed from two parts. One was the Essence Energy Art that one cultivated, including the Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and Terror transformation formed during the cultivation of the Essence Energy Art. These would have a certain effect on the domain’s

abilities.

The other important component was the Zone Core that one absorbed.

Zhou Wen could sense the portion of the Essence Energy Art, but he didn’t know what kind of power the Zone Core gave him. He also needed to constantly discover the domain’s abilities.

From the beginning, when the Zone Core severely injured Godsfall, its power showed some form of devouring and absorption. However, now that Zhou Wen had absorbed the Zone Core’s power, it produced an effect similar to the reverse flow of time. This made Zhou Wen momentarily unable to

determine what kind of ability the domain condensed by the Dao Sutra was.

Zhou Wen also thought of another possibility. If one’s Essence Energy Art and Zone Core combined to produce a domain, producing a special reaction, it might also trigger a domain ability that was different from both.

Just like a chemical reaction, the combination of two different elements could form a new material.

Of course, this was only Zhou Wen’s guess. Perhaps it wasn’t a new ability. It was only because Zhou Wen didn’t know much about the Zone Core’s abilities.

Boom!

Only a tiny portion of the blob of light remained. This portion transformed into a huge pillar of light that blasted at Zhou Wen.

As the pillar of light descended on Zhou Wen, the entire Forbidden Land of the Gods began to tremble. It was as though a huge earthquake had happened. Cracks that spanned hundreds of kilometers appeared on the ground as everything collapsed.

The buildings in Sunset City collapsed one after another, and huge rifts opened beneath the city. Half of the city had already fallen, and the remaining parts were constantly sliding down.

The darkness in the sky seemed to be cut open like a curtain. It peeled off piece by piece, revealing the originally blue sky. The entire Forbidden Land of the Gods was collapsing.

So to advance to the Calamity grade, one needs to use the power of a dimensional zone as the price. Carlos seemed to understand something…
