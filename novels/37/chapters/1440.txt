Chapter 1441: Pandora Shrine

Pandora’s Magic Palace was a large maze, but to people who were familiar with it, as long as they could clear the dimensional creatures in Magic Palace, it wouldn’t be difficult to traverse it.

The only place that humans stepped into in the entire Magic Palace was Pandora Shrine.

The glorious palace that resembled a miracle stood in a corner of Magic Palace. There were many carvings regarding divine miracles engraved on its walls.

Basically, they were scenes of gods carrying out miracles and receiving human worship.

On the murals, Zhou Wen discovered carvings suspected to be the Sun God, the Goddess of Love and Beauty, the God of Metalworking, the Goddess of Wisdom, and even Hades.

These murals were extremely beautiful. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but wonder.?If the gods really exist, do they really look like this?

“Good afternoon, I’m your host, Su Yi. It’s 4:12 p.m., 2nd June. I’m now in front of Pandora Shrine. This is the legendary place where Pandora sleeps. Recently, there have been rumors that Pandora will open the magic box and cause New De City to suffer…” Su Yi stood in front of the shrine’s door and introduced the situation.

As a videographer, Liu Yun was the closest to Su Yi. When Zhou Wen saw that Su Yi was about to reach Pandora Shrine’s door, they exchanged looks and hurriedly approached.

They naturally couldn’t stand in front of the camera, but at that moment, a powerful beam of light suddenly exploded, causing everyone to lose their vision.

The bright light had zero effect on Zhou Wen. Li Xuan was already prepared. After his Terror transformation, light was useless for his eyes.

The two of them saw that Liu Yun had already rushed in front of Su Yi and pushed her towards the door of the shrine.

Su Yi’s strength was considered pretty good among ordinary people. She had reached the peak of the Epic stage, but against an expert like Liu Yun, she was nothing.

She didn’t even see Liu Yun as she involuntarily lunged towards the shrine’s door.

Liu Yun controlled his strength very well. When Su Yi pressed her hands against the door, she touched two unicorn symbols.

Her palm was pierced by the protruding horn, and blood immediately dyed the horn red.

Boom!

The door emitted a dull rumble as it slowly opened. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Li Xuan rushed over to pull Su Yi away. Since the door had already been opened, she was useless to them now. Liu Yun and Jing Daoxian wouldn’t cause trouble for her again.

Liu Yun rushed towards Su Yi at the same time Li Xuan rushed over.

Zhou Wen seemed to sense something as he flashed to Su Yi’s side with Ya’er. The three of them grabbed onto Su Yi’s body within a second of each other.

In the next second, a beam shot out from the opened door, instantly causing Su Yi, Zhou Wen, and company to vanish. The shrine door closed with a boom.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

The four of them fell to the ground one after another. Li Xuan got up and grabbed Liu Yun by the collar and said angrily, “Scoundrel, how dare you lie to us?”

Liu Yun had only said that Su Yi could open the door, but he didn’t say that the door would close itself. Furthermore, it was obvious that they could only enter together with Su Yi.

If they hadn’t wanted to save Su Yi and arrived by her side in time, they would have been left behind by Liu Yun.

“Calm down. I didn’t know that this would happen.” Liu Yun explained without any sincerity.

“What… What do you want?” Su Yi looked at them in panic. Blood was still flowing from her palm and her face was pale. She was clearly frightened.

“Su Yi, Old Zhou and I don’t have any ill intentions…” Just as Li Xuan was about to say something, they heard a boom.

The few of them jumped in fright and couldn’t help but look in the direction of the rumbling. They were alarmed by what they saw.

The place they landed in was actually a huge garden. The garden was circular, and in the middle was a small circular patio. The garden had paths that went horizontally, vertically, and diagonally that demarcated different flower beds.

However, the flowers in the flower beds looked terrifying.

There were sparse flower trees planted in the flower bed, but they didn’t have a single leaf. Their branches were twisted like venomous snakes in a withered gray color.

Each flower tree only had one flower. It was different from ordinary flowers. The flowers didn’t face the sky but towards the ground. Furthermore, the petals were closed.

What was even stranger was that the flowers looked like people hanging off the trees from afar.

The rumbling sound came from the top of the garden. It was the palace’s dome. It was a standard dome with layers of statues.

A gorgeous crystal chandelier hung down from the middle of the dome. There were many lamps of various sizes on the crystal chandelier like blobs of flowers and its diameter exceeded ten meters.

The flower-like lamps were all lit up. The sound should have come from the crystal chandelier, but they didn’t see anything that could make such a loud sound.

“Those crystal lamps seem a little odd!” Liu Yun looked up for a while and suddenly frowned.

“Don’t pull any of your tricks.” Li Xuan still refused to let go of Liu Yun.

“Old Li, let him go. Protect Su Yi.” Zhou Wen knew that with Liu Yun’s spatial teleportation ability, it was useless for Li Xuan to grab him.

Li Xuan glared at Liu Yun before letting go and retreating to Su Yi’s side.

However, Su Yi retreated and maintained a certain distance from Li Xuan. She no longer trusted anyone. No matter how she looked at it, Li Xuan, Zhou Wen, and Liu Yun were in cahoots.

Li Xuan was somewhat helpless. It was useless explaining anything now. All he could do was stand beside Su Yi without a word.

“Look at the crystal chandelier’s flames,” Liu Yun straightened his clothes and pointed.

“What’s wrong with the flames?” Li Xuan asked coldly.

“Don’t you feel that the flames seem to be alive?” Liu Yun said with a strange expression.

“Alive?” Li Xuan and Zhou Wen carefully looked at the flames.

Li Xuan’s eyesight was average, so he didn’t discover any problems. However, Zhou Wen’s eyesight was extraordinary. After taking a closer look, he realized that there was indeed something wrong with the flames.

The flames came from a small crystal ball inside the lamps. There was nothing wrong with the small crystal ball at first glance. It was a transparent, colorless crystal ball the size of a fist.

However, after Zhou Wen carefully scanned it, he realized that it wasn’t a crystal ball, but a huddled crystal creature.

As their bodies were flawless, transparent crystals without any impurities or colors, it was almost impossible to tell when they curled up.

Zhou Wen was still watching when he heard a boom. The huge crystal chandelier moved as though wooden blocks were being reorganized, causing the crystal chandelier’s shape to undergo a huge change. In the blink of an eye, it completely changed into another shape.
