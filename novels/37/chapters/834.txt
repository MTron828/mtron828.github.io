Chapter 835: The Insatiable Behemoth

Translator: CKtalon

Zhang Xiao wasn’t wrong. Unfortunately, he had underestimated Tyrant Behemoth’s appetite. He originally imagined that after the first day, Tyrant Behemoth would definitely need a few days to rest and digest.

To his surprise, Tyrant Behemoth didn’t have any intention of resting every two days. It continued eating, and it ate even more than the first day.

It should be full this time, right? Zhang Xiao already felt that something was amiss.

However, Tyrant Behemoth continued eating on the third day. It was like a black hole that couldn’t be filled as it constantly devoured the Fiend Stones.

In just three days, Tyrant Behemoth resolved the problem of the Fiend Stone proliferation that had plagued the Zhang family.

However, Zhang Xiao couldn’t be happy. The problem with the Fiend Stones was temporarily resolved, but how was he to feed Tyrant Behemoth?

There was still nearly a month left until the auction. Just the thought of Tyrant Behemoth eating like this every day made his knees go weak. How many Essence Energy Crystals did he have to get to feed Tyrant Behemoth like this?

I don’t believe that Tyrant Behemoth doesn’t need digesting. It definitely needs time to digest after eating so many Fiend Stones. Even if it isn’t fed for half a month, it shouldn’t be hungry. Zhang Xiao still had some hope.

But soon, Zhang Xiao realized that he was too naive.

After not feeding it for half a day, Zhang Xiao realized that Tyrant Behemoth was showing the symptoms of hunger that Zhou Wen had mentioned.

Zhang Xiao gritted his teeth and took out the dimensional crystals in his small vault to feed Tyrant Behemoth. However, only after half of the small vault was finished the hungry did Tyrant Behemoth’s hunger symptoms vanish.

Zhang Xiao’s expression was extremely ugly. If Tyrant Behemoth ate like this, his little vault could only feed it for four or five days at most, but what would happen after that?

Zhang Xiao suddenly realized that he had probably been tricked by Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen had said that he had to feed him until he left Mount Dragon Tiger. How could Zhang Xiao have so many Essence Crystals to feed Tyrant Behemoth?

That’s not right. If Tyrant Behemoth can eat so much, how can Zhou Wen afford to rear it? If I can’t afford it, it’s even more impossible for Zhou Wen. Zhang Xiao felt that Zhou Wen definitely had a way to prevent Tyrant Behemoth from eating, such as letting Tyrant Behemoth sleep to reduce its expenditure.

However, Zhang Xiao didn’t know what to do. All he could do was discuss it with Zhang Chunqiu.

When Zhang Chunqiu heard Zhang Xiao, he shook his head and said, “What else can we do? Apologize and get him to take back Tyrant Behemoth. Otherwise, what else can we do? Don’t tell me you really want to rear it for a month? Anyway, I won’t lend you any dimensional crystals.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What I mean is that there must be a way to make Tyrant Behemoth not need to eat. Otherwise, no one could afford to feed it. It’s impossible for Zhou Wen to feed it like this every day. Do you think there’s a way?” Zhang Xiao had his pride, so he naturally wasn’t willing to return Tyrant Behemoth.

“I have no solution. You can ask Zhou Wen,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he spread out his hands.

Zhang Xiao couldn’t help but be dumbfounded that even someone as resourceful as Zhang Chunqiu was helpless. However, he couldn’t bring himself to apologize to Zhou Wen.

I don’t believe that Zhou Wen can raise it, but I can’t. There must be a way. Zhang Xiao brought Tyrant Behemoth back to think of a solution.

However, if it wasn’t full, it wasn’t full. Tyrant Behemoth’s appetite was real. There was no way to fool it into not being hungry.

Zhang Xiao thought of many solutions. He even wanted to hypnotize Tyrant Behemoth to temporarily enter hibernation.

It was useless. Even if it fell asleep, Tyrant Behemoth’s hunger symptoms remained. As long as the symptoms appeared, Zhou Wen would definitely sense them.

Zhang Xiao really couldn’t afford to embarrass himself. Once Tyrant Behemoth was hungry, he had to feed it. After a few days, his little vault had been emptied, so he had to borrow from others.

Zhang Xiao was a person who cared about his reputation. He would rather sell everything to raise Tyrant Behemoth until Zhou Wen left. He definitely couldn’t send him back now.

However, Zhang Xiao was filled with regret. If he had known that Tyrant Behemoth could eat that much, he wouldn’t have agreed to help Zhou Wen raise it.

Now, as long as he saw Tyrant Behemoth, he felt his heart turn cold. Just a slight movement from Tyrant Behemoth made his legs go limp.

How the hell is this a Companion Beast? It’s a bottomless pit. How did that bastard Zhou Wen raise it to the Mythical stage? Zhang Xiao felt extremely depressed.

But he knew that Zhou Wen had definitely invested heavily. Even if there was a way to make Tyrant Behemoth not eat or drink after advancing to the Mythical stage, he definitely had to invest a large amount of resources to advance it.

The amount of resources was unimaginable.

Zhou Wen had spent the past few nights in Celestial Master Manor and spent the days shopping nearby. He mainly wanted Liu Yun to find him, but unfortunately, he hadn’t seen Liu Yun. This made Zhou Wen worry if Liu Yun had really been killed by Ya’er.

When he returned to Celestial Master Manor at night, he realized that Zhang Chunqiu was sitting in the garden he had to pass through. He looked like he was waiting for him.

“Looking for me?” Zhou Wen asked when he saw Zhang Chunqiu stand up.

Zhang Chunqiu handed a small paint box to Zhou Wen. “This is the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman we agreed on previously.”

“Didn’t I agree to lend Tyrant Behemoth to Zhang Xiao for free? There’s no need to give me this,” Zhou Wen said.

Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile, “Zhang Xiao was wrong in this matter. I apologize on his behalf. Take the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman. There’s still a little something here. Consider it a token of my appreciation. On account of Yuzhi, how about we call it quits?”

“You are being too serious. It’s inevitable for young people to have disputes. I’ll accept the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman. There’s no need for anything else. I’ll take back Tyrant Behemoth and pretend nothing happened,” Zhou Wen said.

“Don’t take it back yet. Let Zhang Xiao feed it for another two more days. It might not be a bad thing to let him suffer a little,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“Alright, as you wish,” Zhou Wen said as he took the box containing the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman.

However, Zhang Chunqiu stuffed the other box into Zhou Wen’s hands. “Take this too. It has nothing to do with anything else. Just treat it as a token of my appreciation. You might need it during the auction.”

“Then I’ll accept it.” Zhou Wen didn’t decline.

After chatting for a while, Zhang Chunqiu left. Zhou Wen returned to his room and opened the two boxes. One of them contained the Life Reversing Spirit Talisman, and in the other box was a card. The card was carved from jade. It was the size of a name card without any patterns. Only the word “Celestial Master” was engraved on it.

What’s the use of this thing? Zhou Wen looked at it for a while and realized that it was an ordinary jade carving. It wasn’t a dimensional item.

In the courtyard of Dragon Tiger Town, Moses and the rest were discussing something.

“We have to obtain the Earth Elemental Beast. If we can’t obtain it, we can only use forceful means.” The elder looked at Moses and said, “You have to be mentally prepared. You might need to take action when the time comes.”

Moses smiled and said, “My Guardian and I are ready. We can take action at any time.”

“Let’s wait until the auction results are out. Mount Dragon Tiger belongs to the Zhang family after all,” the elder said. “Even if we want to make a move, we have to wait until the item leaves Mount Dragon Tiger.”
