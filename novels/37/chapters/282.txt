Chapter 283 Strange Underground Vehicle

Zhou Wen’s eyes illuminated like two miniature floodlights, shooting out two light beams into the dark tunnel. Although the main purpose of this skill was to see through things, viewing things in the darkness wasn’t too difficult either. The only limitation was that it could only view things that were close by, not something too far away.

The sound of a train in the darkness wasn’t far from the exit. With a glance, Zhou Wen’s expression immediately changed.

There was actually a vehicle in the dark tunnel. It came up from the bottom, it wasn’t a train but a strange vehicle made of stone and wood.

The design of the vehicle looked ancient. It was a square-shaped horse-drawn carriage. However, the vehicle didn’t have any horses or other creatures pulling it. At the front of the carriage was a human-shaped puppet. It stood at a stand at the front of the vehicle, both hands holding onto a crank. Its body moved up and down as it rhythmically rotated the stone crank.

With the rotation of the stone crank, the strange vehicle moved up the stone steps. The stone wheels collided with the edge of the stone steps, producing loud thuds. It moved at a rather slow speed.

Beside the puppet was a wooden rod with a stone lamp hanging from it. The light that Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian saw earlier was emitted from the stone lamp.

Apart from the puppet, there were no other creatures to be seen. It was as if the puppet was driving the vehicle.

The puppet was strange. It looked human, but its face was flat without any facial features, making it look very bizarre.

rre.

Zhou Wen only took a few looks before the strange stone carriage reached the mouth of the entrance. It then slowly came to a stop.

Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian sized up the strange vehicle warily, but after the carriage left the stone path, it stopped moving. The puppet on it seemed to have used up all its energy. It stopped there and kept the pose of rotating the crank.

Lu Yunxian leaped up, but he didn’t approach the vehicle. He only wanted to jump up to see what was inside the vehicle.

“Lu Ning!” After Lu Yunxian reached a certain height, his gaze fell on the back of the vehicle and he screamed.

Zhou Wen also flew up to look inside. He saw that there was only a woman lying there. She looked like she had passed out. Apart from that, there was nothing else. It was empty inside the vehicle.

Zhou Wen kind of knew the woman-Lu Ning who had come with An Sheng. Zhou Wen had a deep impression of her, especially her Snow Fox. It had powerful ice elemental powers, making Zhou Wen envious.

“I’ll go see if she’s dead.” Lu Yunxian said as he prepared to jump onto the strange vehicle.

“Don’t go yet.” Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that the vehicle was a little strange. He stopped Lu Yunxian and used Demonic Astral Wheel to suck at the vehicle.

The unconscious Lu Ning was immediately sucked out by him and she flew towards Zhou Wen’s palm.

With Liu Chengzhi having served his lesson, Zhou Wen was a lot warier. He didn’t touch Lu Ning; instead, he retracted his strength, causing Lu Ning to fall to the ground.

He didn’t know if she was dead or not, but she did not react at all when she fell to the ground. She just lay there motionless.

Zhou Wen first used the Light of Penetration to look at Lu Ning and discovered that her heart was still beating. Her bodily functions seemed normal.

However, the strange thing was that inside her body, there were many extremely slender worms that looked like snakes squirming along her veins. It looked abnormally terrifying

Zhou Wen had an inkling that the reason Lu Ning was unconscious was probably because of these worms.

The worms were like strands of hair that squirmed through the blood vessels. Even her heart and organs were filled with them.

“She’s still alive and doesn’t seem to be injured. Her heart is also beating. For some reason, she’s unconscious,” Lu Yunxian said as he checked Lu Ning’s body.

“Her raincoat has been torn, so she can’t avoid the blood rain here. It’s not convenient to treat her here. Take her back to the tent first. We can ask her what happened inside when she’s awake.” Seeing that there were no signs of the hair-like worms drilling out of her body, Zhou Wen got Lu Yunxian to wrap Lu Ning in a rainproof cloth he had brought along. Lu Yunxian then piggybacked her out of the ruins.

When Zhao Xin and company saw Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian coming out unscathed and bringing someone back, they were quite surprised.

“Lu Ning! What happened to her?” Zhao Xin was shocked when he saw Lu Ning.

He knew Lu Ning’s might. Her ice-elemental Primordial Energy Art was considered top-notch at the Epic stage. With the help of many excellent-grade Companion Beasts, not many people could defeat her.

Now that Lu Ning had been brought back by Zhou Wen and Lu Yunxian in a coma, it meant that the situation below wasn’t looking good.

“What happened? How’s Adjutant An and the rest?” Zhao Xin asked.

“I don’t know. When we arrived at the entrance of the underground tunnel, we happened to see her come out. We will have to wake her up before we can figure out what happened underground,” Zhou Wen said.

“Let me try. I have an Ivy Companion Beast with good healing abilities.” As Zhao Xin spoke, he summoned a plant-type Companion Beast.

The green vine wrapped around Lu Ning’s body like a snake, its sprouts crawled across Ning’s face and reached into her nostrils, mouth, and ears, producing some liquid that resembled water.

The liquid had decent healing properties. Even a severely injured person would be able to temporarily awaken.

However, despite Zhao Xi making the green vines produce the liquid, he failed to wake Lu Ning.

“Strange... If she’s only injured, the Rejuvenation Juice would still be effective even if her brain has been injured. Why isn’t she reacting at all? Could she have been hypnotized?” Zhao Xin asked, puzzled.

The others did not have any treatment abilities. They looked at each other, but there was nothing they could come up with.

“Don’t let your Companion Beast waste its energy. Let it rest for a while. It might be needed later,” Zhou Wen said to Zhao Xin.

“Young Master Wen, do you have a solution?” Zhao Xin had changed his mind and called him Young Master Wen like Lu Yunxian.

“I’ll give it a try. It’s a last-ditch effort.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he flicked his wrist. A strange energy condensed in his hand, forming a metal syringe.

Walking to Lu Ning’s side, Zhou Wen’s eyes stared at Lu Ning like a floodlight. At the same time, he injected the syringe into Lu Ning’s arm.

When he was in school, he had learned about injections, but it was limited to the basics. Furthermore, it was only theory with no practicals. Zhou Wen was only trying to see if Doctor Darkness’s poison could kill the strange worms inside Lu Ning’s body.
