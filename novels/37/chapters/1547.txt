Chapter 1548: Accidental Kill

Translator: CKtalon

Legend has it that Satan transformed into an ancient snake and lured Adam and Eve into depravity. Is the Temptation Zone of this Ancient Snake related to that legend??Zhou Wen guessed.

To know the exact effects of the Temptation Zone, he had to give it a try. Zhou Wen hatched the Ancient Snake and summoned it in its staff form.

A snake-headed staff appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand. It was about two meters long. The head of the staff was a snake’s head, and its end was a snake’s tail. In the middle was a coiled snake’s body that was as red as blood. Its eyes were like two rubies that shimmered with a demonic glow. It looked extremely bizarre.

Zhou Wen waved it a few times and injected Essence Energy into it, but he realized that the staff didn’t have any long-range attacks or any spells.

What kind of crappy staff is this? Is it expecting a mage to use a staff like a daibo? Will that make me a mage or a warrior??Zhou Wen thought to himself.

He entered a dungeon in-game with the Ancient Snake and allowed it to take form. A huge ancient snake appeared in front of Zhou Wen.

With such a huge body, it was definitely powerful in melee combat. However, what Zhou Wen wanted to know wasn’t its melee abilities, but the capabilities of its domain.

Dimensional creatures rushed towards Zhou Wen. Although the dimensional creatures were low-level creatures without even a single Mythical creature, Zhou Wen still got the Ancient Snake to use its domain as a test of its abilities.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that a Companion Beast like the Ancient Snake would cause quite a stir when it released its domain, but to his surprise, it didn’t have any lighting effects. All he heard was a faint sound coming from the Ancient Snake’s mouth. Although it wasn’t loud, it was like the murmur of a devil. It left Zhou Wen vexed.

Zhou Wen just felt frustrated. The other dimensional creatures that approached the Ancient Snake seemed to go mad as they fought each other. The scene devolved into pandemonium.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed. Clearly, the Temptation Zone was a domain that could throw the enemy into disarray. It could even make the enemy kill each other. This reminded Zhou Wen of the dimensional creature on Merak Star. Its sound-type ability made the Golden Wyrm Scissors switch sides. There seemed to be some similarities.

He walked deeper into the dungeon with the Ancient Snake. This feeling was indeed great. There was no need for him to do it himself as the dimensional creatures began fighting themselves. He felt like a god playing with life.

However, the Temptation Zone wasn’t invincible. Zhou Wen attempted to get the Ancient Snake to use the Temptation Zone on him, but it was useless. All it did was pressure him mentally.

The creature on Merak seems to have similar abilities, but the effects are stronger than the Ancient Snake’s Temptation Zone. I wonder if using the Ancient Snake’s Temptation Zone can resist Starlord Titan Gate’s strength.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen immediately launched the Big Dipper instance dungeon. Starlord Ravenous Wolf of the Dubhe Palace hadn’t respawned, so Zhou Wen went straight to the Merak Star Palace and faced Starlord Titan Gate again.

Starlord Titan Gate let out another terrifying roar as a powerful shockwave surged over. Zhou Wen summoned the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Ancient Snake while he protected himself with the Chaos Egg.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors went against the sound wave, but the Ancient Snake stayed in place. It flicked its tongue, letting out a strange murmur.

The Ancient Snake’s murmurs weren’t lethal. Starlord Titan Gate’s roar vanished upon clashing with the murmurs. It was almost inaudible.

The Ancient Snake had thick skin and flesh, so it could temporarily withstand it. What Zhou Wen was most worried about was the Golden Wyrm Scissors flying back and attacking him ruthlessly.

Strangely, nothing like that happened. The Golden Wyrm Scissors quickly rushed over and chopped off Starlord Titan Gate’s head with one strike.

‘Killed Starlord Titan Gate. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’

He died just like that??Zhou Wen found it unbelievable.

Starlord Titan Gate only dropped two stat crystals—there were no Companion Eggs. It left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.

However, killing Starlord Titan Gate was already a pleasant surprise. He couldn’t demand any more.

The Golden Wyrm Scissors is really useful. As long as it can get close, it can slice apart anything at the same level.?Zhou Wen’s fondness for the Golden Wyrm Scissors increased.

Zhou Wen had also attempted the Venusian instance dungeon. He was killed by the strange artifact every time. Up to now, Zhou Wen didn’t know what the artifact was, nor had he won once.

It was useless even if he had the Hell-level Golden Wyrm Scissors. He died the same way.

After feeding the stat crystal to the Companion Beast, Zhou Wen arrived at the back of the Merak Star Palace. Indeed, there was a teleportation nexus there.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen chose to head to the third star, Phecda. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

There was little information about Phecda. It wasn’t as famous as Dubhe and Merak. Zhou Wen only knew its name, but he wasn’t too sure about its legends.

Phecda Star Palace wasn’t as exaggerated as the Merak Star Palace. It looked like an ordinary temple on Earth.

Opening the door to Phecda Star Palace, he saw a person in green armor inside. Zhou Wen only remembered Phecda, but he couldn’t recall the corresponding Starlord’s name.

Regardless of what Starlord the other party was, Zhou Wen only had one set of moves. He used the Golden Wyrm Scissors and the Ancient Snake’s Temptation Zone.

The green-armored Starlord didn’t seem to be as ferocious as Starlord Ravenous Wolf and Starlord Titan Gate. When the Golden Wyrm Scissors flew over, he didn’t seem to react at all.

Crack!

The green-armored Starlord was sliced into two by the Golden Wyrm Scissors. Zhou Wen imagined that he had successfully passed the test and could head to the next Star Palace when he heard a crack. The Golden Wyrm Scissors had snapped.

How did that happen??Zhou Wen was alarmed. The Golden Wyrm Scissors was one of the strongest at the Hell level. Even a Heaven-level creature would find it difficult to snap it.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t discover anything lunging at the Golden Wyrm Scissors. It looked like it had snapped on its own.

Thankfully, it was in-game. Otherwise, it would have been a huge loss if the Golden Wyrm Scissors had snapped.

As for the green-armored Starlord that had been sliced into two, his body strangely recovered when the Golden Wyrm Scissors snapped as though he had never been injured.

Zhou Wen’s heart palpitated as he got the Ancient Snake to charge over.

The Ancient Snake’s Temptation Zone didn’t seem to be of much use to the green-armored Starlord. He stood there without being affected. The Ancient Snake bit down and swallowed him.

The tiny body of the green-armored Starlord wasn’t even enough to fill the gaps between the Ancient Snake’s teeth.

Before Zhou Wen could rejoice, the Ancient Snake’s massive body suddenly shrank rapidly. The green-armored Starlord appeared out of thin air from the Ancient Snake’s body. Instead, it opened its mouth wide and swallowed the now minified Ancient Snake.

What’s going on? What’s wrong with this fellow??Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.
