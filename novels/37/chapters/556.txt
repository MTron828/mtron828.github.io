Chapter 557 The Last Day of the Exchange

‘Killed Mythical Creature, Torch Dragon youngling. Discovered Dimensional Crystal.’

This thing... is a youngling... Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be astonished. If it were an adult Torch Dragon, he wondered how strong it would be.

Only one dimensional crystal dropped. When Zhou Wen saw the number, he thought it was just an ordinary dimensional crystal. He couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed. However, upon careful scrutiny, he saw that it was a 37-valued Spatial dimensional crystal.

It’s a rare spatial stat, and it’s 37 points. Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he hurriedly absorbed the Spatial Crystal.

Strands of strange energy fused into Zhou Wen’s body, making him feel like his body had changed, but he couldn’t tell what changes had happened.

After the Spatial Crystal was completely absorbed, Zhou Wen saw the Spatial state of his rare stats reach 37.

Spatial stat of 37. The requirement for the Jade Lute Crystal is 41 Constitution, 21 Spatial stat, and a Spatial Life Providence and Life Soul. In other words, as long as I raise my Constitution to 41 points, I can absorb the Jade Lute Crystal skill. Zhou Wen was still eyeing the Jade Lute Crystal.

Although no Companion Egg dropped, a special stat was still extremely valuable. Zhou Wen was satisfied and planned on doing it again. Unfortunately, Torch Dragon was the same as the Golden Battle God Halberd. It didn’t appear immediately after he respawned the dungeon. It would probably take 24 hours before the Torch Dragon youngling would appear again.

It’s time to go to Zhuolu. Zhou Wen planned on heading to Zhuolu while waiting for the dungeon to respawn. As long as he grinded twice and confirmed that he could kill Torch Dragon safely, he would immediately enter the ruins.

He could ignore the chick and antelope. If the two of them didn’t see Zhou Wen return, they would definitely head to Wang Lu’s place for free food and drink. They wouldn’t starve themselves.

Zhou Wen planned on purchasing some items before heading to Zhuolu.

Just as he walked out of Four Seasons Garden, he bumped into Ming Xiu and Tian Zhenzhen, who were looking for him.

“Coach, our exchange is about to end. I came to say goodbye before we leave,” Ming Xiu said.

“So fast?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He didn’t think it had been three months since Ming Xiu had arrived. His days of gaming really passed quickly.

“The three months are up the day after tomorrow. I’m afraid that the school will have other arrangements and that I won’t be able to bid you farewell, so I came ahead of time,” Ming Xiu said.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say. He wasn’t good at words, nor did he like to make farewell speeches.

“Coach, if you have the time, can you fight me again before I leave?” Ming Xiu clearly wasn’t the kind of person who would invite others to a farewell dinner. He wasn’t just here to bid Zhou Wen farewell.

“I can do it now,” Zhou Wen said with a nod.

“Then let’s go to the training ground. I’ve improved a lot recently. Although I haven’t advanced to the Epic stage, I already have some insights,” Ming Xiu said excitedly.

The three of them arrived at the training ground and found an empty room. Tian Zhenzhen stood by the side and watched the battle. Zhou Wen and Ming Xiu took their practice weapons and stood there.

“Coach, please give me your guidance.” With the sword in hand, Ming Xiu’s temperament changed instantly. The warmth from before vanished. His being was even more terrifying and cold than the sword in his hand.

Zhou Wen wielded the practice sword and displayed the stance of Transcendent Flying Immortal. Since Ming Xiu specially came to spar with him before leaving, Zhou Wen didn’t want to brush him off.

Ming Xiu held his sword. At the instant his aura reached its peak, he unsheathed his sword and transformed into a stream of light that stabbed Zhou Wen.

It was like the last ray of light on the horizon during sunset. Ming Xiu’s sword was gorgeous and resolute. It was the last ray of light, and also the final bloom.

Although they were both focused on speed, Ming Xiu’s sword techniques and Feng Qiuyan’s saber techniques exuded a completely different feeling.

Tian Zhenzhen watched Ming Xiu’s strike from the side. Her eyes were filled with anticipation, hoping that the strike would surprise Zhou Wen.

She had been practicing with Ming Xiu the entire time. She knew how much hardship Ming Xiu had suffered in order to hone his sword, and she also knew how much Ming Xiu had improved in such a short time. Although she knew that Ming Xiu couldn’t defeat Zhou Wen, she also wished to see a look of surprise on Zhou Wen’s face. That was the greatest reward for Ming Xiu’s hard work.

Tian Zhenzhen knew very well that Zhou Wen’s shocked expression was more important than any other person’s praise for Ming Xiu.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t show any expression. With a slight movement of his practice sword, he blocked Ming Xiu’s sword. Although Ming Xiu’s sword was fast and ruthless, it was still too slow for Zhou Wen.

Ming Xiu couldn’t help but feel a little discouraged when he saw Zhou Wen easily block his sword that was infused with everything. He stood there with his sword in hand.

“What are you waiting for? Continue,” Zhou Wen said when he saw Ming Xiu pause.

Ming Xiu’s eyes narrowed. He gripped the sword in his hand tightly and swung it again. Like before, his sword was as fast as lightning. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

However, Zhou Wen still casually brandished his sword and blocked Ming Xiu’s sword. However, this time, Ming Xiu didn’t hesitate or stop as he struck again.

Tian Zhenzhen was filled with disappointment. Ming Xiu had clearly put in so much effort, but Zhou Wen was still able to easily block his sword art.

Ming Xiu constantly attacked Zhou Wen from all directions. His sword technique was like meteors that streaked across the sky, but Zhou Wen didn’t use his strongest strike. He even remained in place. All he did was wave his sword and block Ming Xiu’s incoming strikes.

Tian Zhenzhen could not help but smile bitterly. She knew that the difference between the two of them was too great. It was so great that it left one in despair.

Looking at Ming Xiu, who constantly attacked Zhou Wen but failed to make him even take a single step, Tian Zhenzhen felt her heart almost shatter. She really didn’t wish to see Ming Xiu suffer such a blow.

Ming Xiu had put so much effort into improving his sword techniques that when they failed she wanted to rush forward and stop him from continuing the battle. She didn’t want Ming Xiu to suffer such humiliation again.

“If I were you, I wouldn’t disturb him.” A voice sounded beside her. Tian Zhenzhen was too engrossed and hadn’t noticed someone standing beside her.

“President Wei?” Tian Zhenzhen turned around and realized that the person was the president of the student council, Wei Ge.

Wei Ge looked at the battle between Zhou Wen and Ming Xiu and said, “No one is born to be a winner. Every man will experience countless failures in his life. However, some men will never get up again after failing. As for some men, they will get up and continue advancing after failing, ultimately becoming geniuses in the eyes of others. Trust him. Don’t stand in front of him. Don’t block his path. Just trust him.”

Tian Zhenzhen didn’t understand him, but his words dispelled her urge to rush over.

Ming Xiu’s sword constantly slashed out, but it was also constantly blocked by Zhou Wen.

Wei Ge’s eyes narrowed. He could tell that Ming Xiu’s sword technique was evolving. He was searching for all possibilities. As long as he could get up and continue advancing, he would not lose.
