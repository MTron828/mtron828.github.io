Chapter 204 The Goddess of Wind’s Protection

Li Xuan’s eyes lit up when he saw the necklace. He could not help but cry out, “IS that the Goddess of Wind’s Protection?”

“You know what this is?” Zhou Wen asked as he held the necklace.

“I’ve only heard that there are extraordinary treasures in some dimensional zones. Those treasures possess magical powers. The Goddess of Wind’s Protection is one of them. Legend has it that it’s a magical necklace that possesses the power of the wind. Wearing it can give you damage immunity from any wind element. However, according to what I know, the Goddess of Wind’s Protection likely belongs to the Qamar family. Furthermore, it’s unique, so I’ve no idea if it’s real or not,” Li Xuan explained.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s real or fake.” Zhou Wen stuffed the necklace into his pocket. Since this item could resist the Grand Yin Wind, he naturally didn’t want anyone else to possess it.

When John saw this scene, he was so angry that he vomited blood.

The necklace was indeed the Goddess of Wind’s Protection. In order to counter Zhou Wen’s banana fan, Member of Parliament Cape had paid a huge price to borrow it from the Qamar family. Now, it had been snatched away by Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen ignored John as he walked towards the others with the Bamboo Blade in hand. He ignored their pleas or insults as he stabbed through their Primordial Energy sea. Quite a number of people fainted either from the pain or anger.

“Li Xuan, help me search. They must have bought quite a number of Companion Eggs at the market before they came. Let’s see if they still have any on them.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he personally pulled away a young man’s clothes and found two Companion Eggs.

Li Xuan didn’t stand on ceremony either as he rummaged through the bodies of the rest. Soon, they had found 14 Companion Eggs which were likely at the Legendary stage. As for what type they were, it wasn’t possible for them to tell immediately.

John and company seethed in anger with clenched teeth. Back then, An Tianzuo had crippled his peers, but he didn’t do anything else. Zhou Wen and Li Xuan were even more ruthless. Not only did he cripple them, he even took everything from them. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Let’s go.” After searching, Zhou Wen turned around and left, ignoring John and company.

“Old Zhou, what sort of movement technique was that? It’s way too cool. You actually managed to float in midair like Superman,” Li Xuan asked Zhou Wen as he looked at him enviously. Clearly, he was somewhat tempted.

“That’s not a movement technique. Unless you give up the Invincible Connate Divine Art, you can forget about it,” Zhou Wen told a half-truth.

Even if Li Xuan was willing to give up the Invincible Connate Divine Art, he might not be able to master the Godfiend Era. Zhou Wen’s Godfiend Era was simulated by the Lost Immortal Sutra, not that he had succeeded in cultivating it.

When Li Xuan heard that, he heaved a sigh of relief and said depressingly, “Forget it. Although flying in the air is very cool, I’m not bad either.”

The two of them headed east. They knew that Connate Holy Temple was in the east from maps drawn by their predecessors. However, the exact location was unclear.

Every time someone entered the Holy Land, the map they drew was different, but the general location of the Holy Temples Temple was never wrong.

There were no dimensional creatures in the Holy Land, so the duo didn’t encounter any danger. After walking for more than half a day, they saw a sea in front of them. On the cliff by the seaside stood an ancient purple building.

“It should be there.” Li Xuan was delighted as he got Zhou Wen to rush over.

By the time they reached the ancient building, there were already several youths standing in front of the building. Clearly, they were all here to receive the Connate Holy Temple’s test.

When they saw Zhou Wen, they were slightly taken aback. They were somewhat suspicious, as though they were wondering how Zhou Wen had managed to come this far.

From their expressions, Zhou Wen knew that these people definitely knew that John was about to besiege him and Li Xuan.

“Zhou Wen, you sure are lucky. You actually weren’t stopped by John and the rest,” said a black-robed youth coldly.

“My luck has always been pretty good,” Zhou Wen said.

“However, your luck has come to an end. My goal is An Jing. I found it beneath me to fight you, but since she didn’t come and that useless bum, John, failed to stop you, I just can’t let you return whole now that you have come to me yourself. I have to leave some mark on you to show An Tianzuo when you return,” the youth in black said arrogantly.

“What’s with all the nonsense? If you want to attack, hurry up. Don’t delay us from accepting the Connate Holy Temple’s test,” Zhou Wen said casually.

Without another word, the black-robed youth released terrifying black flames from his body. He threw a punch at Zhou Wen like an erupting volcano.

Zhou Wen didn’t use the banana fan. Instead, he switched his Primordial Energy Art to the Ancient Imperial Sutra and struck out with Ashen Palm, meeting the black-robed youth’s fist.

As their fist and palm met, the youth in black felt a scorching pain in his visceral organs. He opened his mouth and spat out a large pool of blood as his body limply collapsed to the ground.

The smiles on the faces of the youths beside him froze and a chill ran down their spines.

They knew the strength of the black-robed youth very well. He was rather famous among the six hero families and was in no way inferior to John. However, he couldn’t even withstand Zhou Wen’s strike.

Could this be another An Tianzuo? They had an ominous feeling.

In the middle of the mountains, a beautiful butterfly leisurely flew past and, surprisingly, there was a person sitting on its back.

As the butterfly flew, the person revealed a look of surprise. The butterfly changed its direction and landed on a mountain peak.

More than ten people were lying on the mountaintop, moaning in pain. It was John’s group.

“Lance, you’re finally here!” John was overjoyed when he saw the person on the butterfly’s back.

“What happened?” Lance looked at John and the others while asking in surprise.

“We had our Primordial Energy sea destroyed by Zhou Wen. He even stole our things...” John recounted what had happened through gritted teeth. Finally, he pleaded. “That Zhou Wen has powerful Companion Beasts aiding him and we weren’t his match. Now, you are the only one who can maintain the dignity of our six hero families. Perhaps no one else is his match.”

“This Zhou Wen is rather interesting, but I’ve already said that I’m not interested in him. Furthermore, you were the ones who went knocking on his door and ended up being crippled by him. You only have yourselves to blame for your lacking skills.” As Lance spoke, he patted the butterfly beneath him and it immediately rose up and left the mountain.

John and the others were stunned. They didn’t expect that Lance would actually disregard the solidarity between the six hero families.
