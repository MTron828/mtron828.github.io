Chapter 1695: Human Sovereign Appears Again

Zhou Wen had plans on challenging the Big Dipper Palace in real life, so there was an immediate agreement. Therefore, Zhou Wen agreed without rejecting him.

The Big Dipper Palaces in-game had already respawned. Zhou Wen grinded it again, but just as he had expected, Starlady Polestar hadn’t respawned. He was basically certain that he could only grind the hidden dungeons once in-game. If he wanted to obtain the treasures in the hidden dungeons, he had to think of a solution in reality.

If Zhou Wen had been a little hesitant previously, afraid that he would die before Truth Listener defeated Starlady Polestar, Great Brahma’s advancement to the Heaven Realm completely dispelled this worry.

Now, Zhou Wen was considering what identity to use to clear the Big Dipper Palace.

With Zhou Wen’s status, he would definitely become the focus of all the factions in the future. The various races in the dimension would probably treat Guide Ancient City and him as a thorn in their side. They would think of all possible ways to eliminate them.

Therefore, after some hesitation, Zhou Wen decided to challenge the Big Dipper Palace as Human Sovereign. Furthermore, this identity had high prestige among humans, so it was most suitable.

Sweetie, please bless me. Let me obtain another Emperor Star. Zhou Wen couldn’t get his mind off the Emperor Star. That thing could add a Life Providence for no reason. It was very suitable for any Companion Beast.

He headed straight for a Cube, Hui Haifeng hoped that he struck while the iron was hot. He wanted to crush the rankings before Karoman’s achievement caused a greater impact.

“Professor Gu, Karoman has become the first person to clear the Big Dipper Palaces. Those in second place to tenth place haven’t even been able to clear the sixth Star Palace. I’m afraid the rewards of the Big Dipper Palaces this time will be very likely to belong to him.” Su Yi chatted with Professor Gu on the program.

Professor Gu nodded slightly and said, “Although everything is still unknown before the Cube’s countdown ends, it will be very difficult for anyone to surpass Karoman for the time being. Even if someone can clear the Big Dipper Palaces, it won’t be easy to surpass him on the rankings.”

As Professor Gu spoke, he suddenly realized that the Cube’s screen had lit up again.

“Another person wants to challenge the Big Dipper Palace? Who could it be? Mohe or someone else?” Everyone watching the program was slightly taken aback before they became excited.

“The reason this person’s challenging the Big Dipper Palaces at this time is clearly because of Karoman!”

“Someone’s trying to stir up some sh*t! However, to be able to cause a stir, they must be someone with extraordinary strength. At the very least, they have to have the strength to clear the Big Dipper Palaces. Who could it be?”

As everyone discussed, a white figure appeared on the Cube’s screen.

The pure white figure was like a god wrapped in holy light. Although they couldn’t see what the person in the light looked like, many people immediately recognized who it was.

“Holy sh*t! Human Sovereign is here!”

“F*ck! Human Sovereign is here? What does he want? Does he want to storm the Big Dipper Palaces?”

“Thankfully, I didn’t give up. I’ve waited for you. Human Sovereign, you’re finally here!”

“Why are you so excited? For Human Sovereign to come here means that he’s definitely a Calamity-grade existence. Without becoming a representative and receiving the help from the dimension’s massive resources, do you think a pure human can advance to the Calamity grade so quickly?”

“Sigh, what you said makes sense. The present Human Sovereign is probably not the former Human Sovereign.”

Everyone discussed spiritedly as the comments flooded in, making it almost impossible to read them. It was obvious that Human Sovereign hadn’t been completely forgotten. He had just been silent for too long.

“Did Human Sovereign choose to challenge the Big Dipper Palaces at this time because he has an agenda? Professor Gu, what do you think?” When Su Yi saw Human Sovereign challenging the Big Dipper Palace, she looked completely different. She looked very spirited.

“You mean that Human Sovereign chose to storm the Big Dipper Palaces the moment Karoman cleared the seven Star Palaces to prove that ordinary humans aren’t inferior to the representatives?” Professor Gu said.

Su Yi nodded excitedly. “I think it’s not as simple as a coincidence.”

“Human Sovereign must have come prepared if he chose to attempt the rankings at this moment. Furthermore, he has already seen the battle between Karoman and Starlord Army Breaker. He knows Starlord Army Breaker’s abilities. It shouldn’t be a big problem to clear the seventh Star Palace.” Professor Gu didn’t mention if Human Sovereign was pure human. He only said that Human Sovereign would definitely be able to clear the seven Star Palaces.

“It’s over. With Sect Master Gu’s jinxing, Human Sovereign is in danger.”

“No, Sect Master, you are going to jinx Human Sovereign!”

The comments were filled with wailing. Who could withstand Jinx Sect Master’s jinxing?

...

An Sheng stood behind An Tianzuo and said as he looked at the scene on the Cube, “Overseer, if Young Master Wen were to rush to the top of the rankings at this moment, he would definitely be able to inspire many humans. This will be extremely beneficial to humanity’s future development.”

An Tianzuo said coldly, “Ignoring the question of whether he can clear the seven Star Palaces, even if he plans on doing so, according to the rules of the Cube’s ranking, the first person to clear the seven Star Palaces will receive an unspoken bonus score. It will be very difficult for him to be ranked above Karoman. If he’s calm enough and studies Starlord Army Breaker’s abilities, he might have a chance of defeating him in the most perfect manner. He’s already such a grown man, but he’s still so rash.”

“Perhaps Young Master Wen already has a card up his sleeve,” An Sheng muttered.

“What do you mean a card up his sleeve? I think he’s just hot-headed.” An Tianzuo snorted as he stared at the screen, his eyes seemingly filled with anticipation.

...

“Human Sovereign has actually appeared at this moment. Things have become interesting.” Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan were also watching in front of the Cube in the Zhang family compound.

“Is Human Sovereign still pure human?” Xia Liuchuan stared at the figure on the screen with interest, but unfortunately, he couldn’t even see what the person inside looked like.

“We’ll know soon,” Zhang Chunqiu said indifferently.

...

The various factions were paying attention to Human Sovereign. Instead of saying that they wanted to know if Human Sovereign could clear the Big Dipper Palaces, they wanted to know if Human Sovereign had become a representative.

Zhou Wen appeared in his Terror form as Human Sovereign. In fact, he had already fused with Great Brahma, but he didn’t plan on using Great Brahma to fight.

Under everyone’s expectant gazes, Zhou Wen pushed open the Star Palace’s door and summoned Truth Listener.

Everyone was taken aback. They never expected Human Sovereign to summon a Companion Beast to fight. Although very few humans had Calamity-grade Companion Beasts, it was almost impossible to clear the level with just one Companion Beast in a continuous battle like the seven Star Palaces.

Furthermore, fighting on the Cube was watched by everyone. Using too many Companion Beasts was equivalent to showing their trump cards to their enemies. Therefore, unless necessary, very few people used Companion Beasts.

Could it be that Human Sovereign’s strength hasn’t reached the level needed to clear the seven Star Palaces? He needs to rely on the power of multiple Companion Beasts to clear the seven Star Palaces. If that’s the case, it should be very difficult for him to surpass Karoman on the rankings, right? Many people had such thoughts flash through their minds.
