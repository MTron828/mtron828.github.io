Chapter 704: Battling the Nine Dragons

Translator: CKtalon

The chains weren’t corporeal, but they were like soul chains. The nine black dragons were connected by them, and at the same time, the chains combined their powers.

The power unleashed by a black dragon was equivalent to the power of nine black dragons unleashing their might at the same time.

It’s no wonder Tyrant Behemoth, who has used Absolute Strength, can’t suppress the black dragon. This is fighting nine alone... Zhou Wen thought.

Tyrant Behemoth stood up again and roared as it charged at the nine black dragons.

Its strength was unparalleled, but it was still difficult to deal with them when it was actually equivalent to single-handedly fighting nine. The black dragon was a Mythical creature with immense strength, and with the nine of them combined as one, the explosive power they released suppressed Tyrant Behemoth.

Every clash of strength forced Tyrant Behemoth to retreat.

Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth was indeed extremely powerful when using Absolute Strength. It wasn’t severely injured even under the combined forces of the nine black dragons.

Truth Listener rushed out and attacked the black dragon from another direction.

The nine black dragons’ movements were not affected at all despite being connected by invisible chains. Furthermore, the powers circulated among them extremely quickly.

As one side sent Tyrant Behemoth retreating, the other side fought Truth Listener, who had gathered its strength, again. The terrifying dragon claws broke through normal speed limits and blasted Truth Listener away.

Zhou Wen had already controlled the blood-colored avatar to slash at the black dragon. The Great Might Vajra Bull also released the Soul Suppression Bell at the same time. When the bell rang, the invisible chain trembled. The Soul Suppression Bell didn’t work, nor did it make the black dragons faint.

Truth Listener looked like it was about to go berserk and shatter another earring. Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned it and Behemoth back before turning around to escape to the Bat Cave.

Demonic Neonate hadn’t attacked all this time, so it looked like she hadn’t found a chance.

The nine black dragons didn’t dare come ashore. They roared in the water, causing huge waves to surge into the sky. The commotion was extremely terrifying.

The nine black dragons are so terrifying. I wonder how powerful the Guardian in the war wagon is? I’m afraid it’s another Buddha Annihilation... Zhou Wen looked at the nine black dragons that surged with ferocious flames as he secretly calculated his chances of killing the Guardian in the war wagon.

I finally understand why the Lost Immortal Sutra can imitate so many Essence Energy Arts and obtain many benefits so easily. Even with such an abnormal ability, killing a Guardian is still as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Zhou Wen had already realized that the Lost Immortal Sutra was indeed an unparalleled Essence Energy Art.

Ignoring the question of whether the Lost Immortal Sutra could advance to the Mythical stage, just killing the Guardian to advance to the Life Soul realm was probably unprecedented.

Unless I think of a way to sever the connection between the nine black dragons, preventing them from gathering the power of nine dragons to attack together, killing them is just a pipe dream. Zhou Wen began to miss the six-winged seraphim.

Among the Guardians that Zhou Wen had seen, he was the easiest to kill.

Unable to kill the nine black dragons, Zhou Wen had no choice but to vent his frustration on the other dimensional creatures. He killed all the rare dimensional creatures in the dungeons and also killed some Musical Note Sprites.

Now, Zhou Wen’s Musical Note Sprites numbered nearly ten thousand. Under the control of the Golden Harp, they could be of some use. However, they were still a distance away from the million-strong army that Zhou Wen had expected.

I heard that there’s an Undead Scourge in the West District which sent millions of Undead rampaging across the land. In the future, I’ll control the million-strong Musical Note Army and create a Musical Scourge. It will be much cooler than the Undead Scourge. At the very least, they look better than them, Zhou Wen thought.

Despite leaving a wake of destruction, his luck today seemed to be especially bad. He didn’t have any rare Companion Beasts drop.

It was time for Medusa to respawn. Zhou Wen planned on farming Medusa once. When he arrived at the Curse Demon Palace, he suddenly thought of something.

Every time he came to the Curse Demon Palace, the beautiful girl would become the demoness, Medusa. Therefore, Zhou Wen killed Medusa in her demoness form every time.

What will happen if I kill the beautiful girl before she becomes Medusa? Zhou Wen couldn’t hold back his emotions when he had this thought.

How can I kill her before she transforms? Zhou Wen didn’t open the door to Medusa’s palace.

In the past, Zhou Wen had attacked her when she was a beautiful girl, but once he attacked her, she would immediately become Medusa. Killing her before she became Medusa was clearly not an easy task.

In terms of speed, my Transcendent Flying Immortal is fast enough, but I can’t kill the beautiful girl before she becomes Medusa. In that case, I can only rely on her. Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he looked at Demonic Neonate, who was standing there with a cold expression like a doll.

As long as Zhou Wen didn’t take the initiative to attack, the beautiful girl wouldn’t become Medusa even if he entered the palace.

After Zhou Wen finished his plans, he carried Demonic Neonate into the palace. Indeed, he saw Medusa sitting there quietly. The current Medusa was still a beautiful and pure girl. Just one look at her made him pity her.

If it wasn’t in-game but in the real world, Zhou Wen really couldn’t bear to attack her.

However, this was the game world. No matter how beautiful she was, she was still an NPC. He didn’t have any qualms.

Zhou Wen walked towards the beautiful girl step by step without gathering any Essence Energy or using his Companion Beasts.

However, Demonic Neonate was slumped on his back. Her black eyes were secretly looking at the beautiful Medusa.

When he arrived in front of the beautiful girl, Zhou Wen didn’t continue walking forward. If he continued walking forward, even if Zhou Wen didn’t attack her, the beautiful girl would become Medusa.

At that moment, Demonic Neonate, who was on Zhou Wen’s back, suddenly moved. A black-purple sword beam drilled out from beneath the blood-colored avatar’s crotch.

Without giving the beautiful girl a chance to react, the demonic sword had already stabbed her in the chest, causing her blood to splatter everywhere. Demonic aura invaded her body, causing her to fall to the ground.

It’s done! Zhou Wen was delighted as he looked at the beautiful girl’s corpse, only to see it disintegrating and disappearing.

Ding!

Soon, something dropped. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Wen took a closer look and was immediately overjoyed. The thing the beautiful girl dropped was a Companion Egg that was crystalline like a sapphire.

A Companion Beast dropped! Zhou Wen found it unbelievable. It hadn’t been a day or two since he started farming Medusa. Dimensional crystals had dropped, but there had never been a Companion Egg drop.

Could it be that only Medusa in her beautiful form can drop a Companion Egg? Zhou Wen guessed as he picked it up.
