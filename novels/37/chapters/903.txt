Chapter 904: Punching Great Skyfiend

Translator: CKtalon

A black armor appeared on Uesugi Nao’s body. When the sword beam struck the armor, it failed to injure it. Instead, the sword beam completely shattered.

Great Skyfiend? Don’t tell me my luck is that good. I just randomly encountered someone, and she’s actually the contractor of Great Skyfiend? Zhou Wen immediately recognized the armor on Uesugi Nao’s body. It was identical to Great Skyfiend on the cube’s rankings.

Uesugi Nao was forced to use Great Skyfiend, so she no longer hid it. She leaped up from the sand. With the augmentation of the Great Skyfiend armor, Uesugi Nao had the speed of a Mythical creature. She was much faster than before.

The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi slashed at Zhou Wen like a phantom. It was so fast that almost no one could see the trajectory of the blade. With a flash of light, the blade was about to hit Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen’s movement technique was elegant like a flying immortal. It didn’t seem fast, but he dodged the blade by a hair’s breadth. The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi brushed past his ear.

Gale Slash... Multi-Slash... Samsara Slash... Boomerang Wind Slash...

Uesugi Nao used her blade techniques again with the augmentation of the Great Skyfiend armor.

However, this time, due to her Mythical Speed and Strength, her blade techniques seemed to have activated an acceleration switch. They were unbelievably fast.

Wherever the blade beam passed, terrifying ditches appeared on the surrounding reefs. The humans on the island had long fled in horror. Even the sea turtles on the island scrambled to escape into the sea.

“That’s Great Skyfiend! Great Skyfiend who’s ranked first!”

“Holy sh*t, it’s really Great Skyfiend. I think I saw an extremely beautiful girl before she transformed into Great Skyfiend. That girl should be Uesugi Nao, right?”

“I never expected the owner of Great Skyfiend to be such a beautiful girl. She’s just a little too ruthless. That blade technique is really lethal!”

“Who’s the young man fighting Great Skyfiend? How impressive. He actually managed to dodge Great Skyfiend’s attack with just his movement technique.”

“I think he has no choice but to dodge. He has no chance of retaliating.”

“I don’t think so. Look at that young man. He’s still holding a little girl in his arms. Look at how calm that little girl is. If that young man is really dodging in a sorry state, he would definitely scare the little girl in his arms. The little girl’s calmness can only mean one thing. The young man is completely composed.”

“Speaking of which, who is that young man? He’s so young. I’m afraid he’s not even twenty, right? To be able to fight Great Skyfiend without using a Companion Beast is a little terrifying.”

Zhou Wen’s name and looks were well known among the six families and some wealthy families, but there weren’t many ordinary citizens who knew him.

If someone from the six families or the bureau were here, they wouldn’t be surprised to see this scene.

Zhou Wen used the Godfiend Life Providence and Glimmer Life Soul to complement Transcendent Flying Immortal, pushing his movement technique to its limits.

Although Uesugi Nao had the augmentation of Great Skyfiend and her Speed and Strength had reached the Mythical stage, she still failed to touch Zhou Wen.

Impossible... I have Great Skyfiend augmenting me. My speed is already at the Mythical stage. He’s only at the Epic stage. There’s such a huge difference in basic Speed. How can he dodge my attacks time and time again? Uesugi Nao found it unbelievable.

She had always felt that unless it was a human who had contracted a Guardian, no one could resist her after she obtained Great Skyfiend.

However, Zhou Wen’s appearance shattered the pride in her heart. Ignoring everything else, Zhou Wen’s movement technique was actually able to match her Mythical speed. She found it unacceptable.

Uesugi Nao couldn’t accept such an outcome. She constantly stimulated Great Skyfiend’s strength, allowing her movement techniques and blade techniques to become faster and faster. She had to defeat Zhou Wen no matter what.

However, her blade still couldn’t touch Zhou Wen. She could clearly sense that Zhou Wen wasn’t as fast as her, but her blade was always dodged by him.

As Zhou Wen dodged Uesugi Nao’s attack, he observed Great Skyfiend’s abilities.

His movement technique was indeed not as fast as Uesugi Nao’s, but at least Uesugi Nao wasn’t so fast that he couldn’t react.

Zhou Wen was best at movement techniques. Transcendent Flying Immortal had been trained by him from when it was a low-level skill. Be it technique or compatibility with Zhou Wen, they were incomparable to other skills. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Amidst the terrifying blade shadows, Zhou Wen tapped his toes and floated in the air like a fallen leaf dancing in the wind. No matter how fast Uesugi Nao’s blade techniques were, they couldn’t touch him.

Speed should be at the top of the Mythical stage, so is Strength. Although I don’t know what Great Skyfiend’s skills are, just from his augmentation of Uesugi Nao’s stats, he’s undoubtedly an extremely powerful Guardian. Zhou Wen deduced Great Skyfiend’s abilities to gain more information.

However, Zhou Wen also knew that Uesugi Nao had only used Great Skyfiend’s stats and hadn’t used his abilities. The strength of a Guardian depended on their abilities.

Zhou Wen kept waiting to see what abilities Great Skyfiend had. What were his Life Providence, Life Soul, Wheel of Destiny, and skills?

However, Uesugi Nao never used Great Skyfiend’s abilities. She only wanted to use her blade techniques to defeat Zhou Wen.

From the looks of it, I have to give her some pressure so that she can use Great Skyfiend’s powers. With a thought, Zhou Wen watched as Uesugi Nao slashed out again. This time, he didn’t dodge.

A roar alarmed the world as Tyrant Behemoth descended out of nowhere and transformed into a boxing glove that appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand. Zhou Wen brandished his fist to meet Uesugi Nao’s Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.

Tyrant Behemoth! Uesugi Nao’s pupils constricted. She never expected Zhou Wen to be Tyrant Behemoth’s owner.

In the last cube ranking battle, Orochi had been defeated by Tyrant Behemoth and nearly devoured by it.

It wasn’t just Uesugi Nao. Everyone watching the battle on the beach also saw the terrifying light and roar before Tyrant Behemoth condensed into a boxing glove.

However, before they could react, Zhou Wen’s fist had already struck Uesugi Nao’s blade.

Boom!

With Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength augmentation, the power of Zhou Wen’s punch was extremely terrifying at the Mythical stage.

The extremely sharp Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi slammed into Tyrant Behemoth’s boxing glove. Not only did it fail to slice open the boxing glove, but it was also sent flying by the shockwave. Uesugi Nao also retreated a few steps from the terrifying force. The reef beneath her feet shattered as shocking cracks appeared.

“Holy sh*t, so it’s Tyrant Behemoth’s owner. It’s no wonder he’s so strong.”

“So Tyrant Behemoth’s owner is from our East District. He’s so young!”

“Haha, I knew it. Great Skyfiend isn’t anything impressive. It’s just that the previous top four didn’t participate in the battle. Otherwise, how could she have arrogantly taken first place? The people overseas are this and nothing more.”
