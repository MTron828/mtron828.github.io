Chapter 937: The True Dimension

“What solution do you have?” The ice maiden stared at Zhou Wen in disbelief.

“Since I can come here, I naturally have a way to return. Otherwise, what’s the point of coming here to steal? However, this method is somewhat difficult,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“As long as you can let me see the Demon God Catalog, the Heaven Shrouding Bell will be yours,” said the ice maiden.

“That’s not what I mean. As you know, teleporting here is an extremely difficult task. I can teleport back alone, but if I take you along, the energy needed for the teleportation will probably be insufficient. If there’s a teleportation deviation, we won’t be able to survive,” Zhou Wen said with a solemn expression.

“What are you trying to say?” The ice maiden could naturally tell that Zhou Wen was up to something. If he really couldn’t teleport to Earth, he wouldn’t have said anything.

“If you really want to go, there’s a solution. However, I’ll have to trouble you. I have a spatial artifact. You can enter it first. That way, I can take you to Earth,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“This trick of paying me back in my own coin is pretty good,” the ice maiden said coldly.

Zhou Wen shrugged and said, “I don’t have such thoughts. As a Terror-grade expert, would you be trapped by a tool?”

The ice maiden looked at Zhou Wen without a word. Clearly, she wouldn’t agree to such a condition. Zhou Wen felt his hair stand on end from her gaze. All he could do was continue, “Alright, I still have a second solution, but it’s more difficult.”

“Tell me about it.” The ice maiden looked nasty.

“Can’t you dimensional creatures sign a contract with humans? Sign a contract with me and you can be my Guardian.” The contract Zhou Wen wanted was naturally not a Guardian contract, but the master-slave contract similar to the one Ya’er had signed with Grim Demon.

The ice maiden curled her lips and said, “Those who can contract are Guardians, not true races from the dimension. Guardians are half pets and half dimensional creatures, different from us.”

“Then I’m out of options,” Zhou Wen said as he shrugged.

“Show me your spatial container.” Zhou Wen took out the calabash containing the Dragon King Gu. The Dragon King Gu had been kept in the calabash, so it hadn’t been doing well recently.

Tai Sui treated it as food. When it was hungry, it would eat some of the Dragon King Gu. Although the Dragon King Gu had the ability to reproduce and heal itself, it needed energy. There was no energy supply in the calabash, so it relied on its own stores. The Dragon King Gu appeared somewhat weak.

“This is it. There’s a dimensional creature inside.” Zhou Wen handed the calabash to the ice maiden.

The ice maiden took the calabash and looked at it before studying it for a while. She nodded and said, “We shall use the first method. I’ll enter this calabash. Take me to Earth to see the Demon God Catalog. When the time comes, the Heaven Shrouding Bell will be your reward.”

“Alright, but before that, we have to return to the volcanic area. The spatial coordinates set by the Nine-Tailed Fox with me are there. Only by using those spatial coordinates as a marker can I contact her to open the spatial teleportation tunnel,” Zhou Wen said.

“No problem. I can take you there now,” the ice maiden said.

“You previously said that you can take me to see Emperor of Shang?” Zhou Wen thought of the Nine-Tailed Fox. If possible, he should help her pass the message to prevent himself from returning with nothing to say.

“Sure, but are you sure you want to go?” the ice maiden asked with a faint smile. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Is there anything wrong?” Zhou Wen asked.

“There’s nothing wrong with it. However, the place where Emperor of Shang resides is the true dimension world. The environment there isn’t as comfortable as here. Epic creatures would probably find it difficult to survive there,” the ice maiden said.

“I can transform into a Mythical creature. It shouldn’t be a problem, right?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“Sure.” The ice maiden nodded slightly.

“How long will it take to get to Emperor of Shang?” Zhou Wen was afraid that he would take too long and miss the time needed to return. There wasn’t much time left until the 36-hour deadline.

“It’s not difficult to go where Emperor of Shang is. With the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s help, if your body can withstand the environment of the dimension, you can return in an hour,” the ice maiden said after some thought.

“Then let’s go. If I don’t settle this matter, I won’t be able to explain why to the Nine-Tailed Fox when I return.” Zhou Wen actually wanted to meet the legendary tyrant.

After all, this tyrant’s reputation was too illustrious in the history of the East District. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call him the number one tyrant throughout history.

If such a tyrant really existed, Zhou Wen wanted to see with his own eyes what he looked like.

“Alright, it’s best you prepare ahead of time. When you reach the dimension, the environment will have a very strong effect on your body,” the ice maiden reminded.

“I’ll head over in the form of the Mutated Demon Mother Clam,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright.” The ice maiden didn’t say anything else as she turned into her Terror form again. Then, she walked towards the Heaven Shrouding Bell and picked it up before shaking it thrice.

The ice castle trembled violently. It was much more intense than the previous two times. Zhou Wen could clearly sense the energy of spatial teleportation. Unfortunately, the New Era Life Soul had already advanced to a Perfect Body, so it couldn’t continue advancing.

Zhou Wen floated in the air as a Mutated Demon Mother Clam, waiting for the moment he would be teleported to the dimension.

When the ice castle stopped shaking, Zhou Wen suddenly felt a terrifying force coming from his body. His body seemed to be attracted by a powerful magnet as he fell from the sky.

Clang!

Zhou Wen slammed heavily into the icy ground as though there was a mountain pressing down on him. No matter how much strength he exerted, his Mutated Demon Mother Clam body remained motionless.

At the same time, he felt his mind tremble. His soul seemed to be oppressed by some unknown force, making him feel extremely uneasy. It was as though a terrifying existence existed in every corner of this world.

“How did this happen? Why can’t I move?” Zhou Wen asked the ice maiden.

The ice maiden looked at him with a faint smile and said, “I’ve already told you. The Mythical creatures that you humans think of are only the lowest level existences in the dimension. Although the Mutated Demon Mother Clam is special, it’s only a Mythical creature. On Earth, it’s a god-like existence, but in the dimension, it’s a scallop. Have you seen a scallop that can walk?”

Zhou Wen was immediately rendered speechless. The ice maiden clearly knew of the outcome and had deliberately wanted to see him make a fool of himself.

“It’s about five kilometers from here to where Emperor of Shang lives. Are you sure you still want to go?” The ice maiden mocked Zhou Wen.

“Of course. Why not?” Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and canceled the Demon Mother Clam transformation.

In an instant, Zhou Wen felt as though his body was a watermelon that was about to explode. His organs were about to burst.

Before his body exploded, Zhou Wen used the Mythical Demon Dragon True Body and transformed into a humanoid Demon Dragon. At the same time, he got Doctor Darkness to possess him and augment him with strength. Finally, he managed to withstand the terrifying pressure.

Zhou Wen wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. For that instant, he really believed that his body was about to explode.
