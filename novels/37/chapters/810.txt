Chapter 811: Mythical Rank

Zhou Wen decided to enter Xiyuan’s shop to take a look at the silver-haired Companion Beast. No matter how strong the Companion Beast was, since he was locked up in a way that a Companion Beast shop could trap him, there was no reason for anything to happen to him. After all, Qin Xiyuan and company were fine.

As long as I don’t touch the metal slab or enter the passcode, I should be fine. Zhou Wen made up his mind. After paying the bill, he left the cafe and found an empty spot. He put on the Invisibility Cloak and walked towards Xiyuan Store.

Zhou Wen had already figured out the situation in the shop. Since Qin Xiyuan wasn’t there, he avoided the places that might expose him and slowly approached the elevator that led to the fourth level.

The building held no secrets for him. Zhou Wen passed through some ventilation ducts and quickly arrived at the top level.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to go directly to B4, but B4 was completely sealed. No ventilation duct could reach there. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, this wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen. There was only one entrance to the fourth level, and it was a special elevator. It was in Qin Xiyuan’s office.

Zhou Wen remembered that the last time he came with Ouyang Lan, she could take him to B4. Now, the public elevator had been sealed. Only this place could reach B4.

Without Qin Xiyuan around, Zhou Wen found an opportunity to release Primordial Spore and allowed it to enter the lock. It opened the lock from the inside and easily allowed Zhou Wen to gain access to the office.

Following the steps from his experience, he activated the sealed elevator and successfully reached the empty B4.

The various seals naturally didn’t pose a problem for Zhou Wen. Miniature Companion Beasts like Gu could enter the locks, making it easy to open them.

The invisible Zhou Wen could do whatever he wanted in the shop. Soon, he arrived at the room where the silver-haired Companion Beast was.

Zhou Wen didn’t enter directly because there were many cameras in the room. Even the opposite side of the room had several cameras installed. If he opened the door in invisibility, people in the surveillance room would notice it.

Just as Zhou Wen was considering how to enter, he suddenly realized that the entire building’s electricity had been cut. This was somewhat different from a blackout.

In the event of a blackout, it only meant that the power supply had been cut. There would still be stored electric power in some equipment, such as electronic watches, phones, and electrical appliances with batteries that allowed them to continue operating.

However, the electricity in the entire building seemed to have been sucked away. There was nothing left, and all the electronic devices had lost their effects.

Zhou Wen immediately knew that it was the handiwork of the silver-haired Companion Beast inside. Although there was a door between them, the silver-haired Companion Beast was smiling at him as though the door didn’t exist.

“You’re finally here,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said. This time, not only did he open his mouth, but he also spoke. It was different from when he had only used lip-reading.

“You knew I would come?” Zhou Wen didn’t push open the door and spoke to the silver-haired Companion Beast through the door. In fact, they could see each other without opening the door.

“When I first saw you, I knew that you were Ouyang Ting’s chosen one, so I knew you would definitely come,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.

“Why was I chosen?” Zhou Wen didn’t ask what he was chosen for. This was because the other party would know that he didn’t know anything. When the time came, he would reconsider revealing some truths.

Now that Zhou Wen had asked why he was chosen, the other party would say something. Perhaps he could obtain some useful information from him before continuing the conversation.

“Because you aren’t smart enough,” said the silver-haired Companion Beast.

Zhou Wen looked at the silver-haired Companion Beast in a daze. He had imagined many possibilities, but he never expected such an answer.

The silver-haired Companion Beast continued with a smile, “There are some things that overly smart people can’t do. The person we need is someone who isn’t too smart but isn’t stupid. At the same time, he has to be very talented, occasionally having bouts of inspiration. The person also has to be highly focused.”

“And then?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Then, you were chosen by Ouyang Ting. I think he has good taste. You are indeed someone who’s highly focused,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said with a smile.

“Then what can I do?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“I don’t know.” The silver-haired Companion Beast’s answer once again exceeded Zhou Wen’s expectations.

“How can you not know?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Because I don’t know how far you can go, I don’t know what you can do in the end. The differing ability levels dictate the different things you can do. When you are still a child, your parents won’t let you work to earn money. When you are a man, no one will request to use you as a surrogate mother. Therefore, what you can do doesn’t depend on anyone else. It only has to do with your abilities,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.

“I’m not here to listen to you talk about philosophy. If that’s all you want to say to me, I think I should leave,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright, then I’ll say something that you’re interested in. Do you know the Mythical stage?” The silver-haired Companion Beast changed the topic, but Zhou Wen didn’t understand why he would suddenly say that. Under the present circumstances, with people possibly coming to check on the fourth level at any time, shouldn’t he say something related to himself?

“You mean the level above the Mythical stage?” Zhou Wen asked patiently.

“That description isn’t right. In fact, Mythicals contain many different grades. The Mythical you are talking about now is just the threshold when stepping into the Mythical stage,” the silver-haired Companion Beast said.

“Then what grades are there to the Mythical stage?” Zhou Wen asked.

“If you want to know what grades there are to a Mythical creature, you first need to know what a god is. Do you know what a god is?” the silver-haired Companion Beast said calmly.

“Can our communication be simpler and more effective? I don’t think I’ll have much time to listen to your stories here. The people in this shop won’t give me that much time,” Zhou Wen said.

However, the silver-haired Companion Beast continued without batting an eyelid. “In ancient times, humans in a primitive society became afraid of unknown things and dangers. And by manifesting this fear, gods were born. For example, humans were afraid of lightning, so they imagined lightning as a terrifying life form. Hence, there was the Thunder God. Humans were afraid of the heavy rain because it would make humans sick, so there was the Rain God. Other examples include powerful creatures like tigers, wolves, snakes, eagles, etc. Human strength was incomparable to them. They were worshiped because of fear as humans hoped to be as powerful as those ferocious beasts. Therefore, they created totem worship. That is also a form of god.

“Therefore, the first grade of the Mythical stage is the Terror grade. Any Mythical creature that can cause terror belongs to this level. This is also the weakest level among Mythical creatures. The Mythical Companion Beasts on the ranking all belong to this grade.”
