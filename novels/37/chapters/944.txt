Chapter 945: Purgatory Fiend Flames

Apart from knowing that her opponent was the owner of Primordial Immortal Sword, Uesugi Nao knew nothing about Ya, so she didn’t dare to be careless. She summoned the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi formed by Orochi.

With the augmentation of Great Skyfiend’s power, a terrifying demonic aura appeared over Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.

Ya didn’t say a word. He held Primordial Immortal Sword and didn’t pull it out. Instead, he slashed at Uesugi Nao with the sword sheathed, making it appear like a heavy sword.

Uesugi Nao was not to be outdone. She brandished her Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi to meet Ya’s Primordial Immortal Sword.

Clang!

The two swords clashed and the two terrifying forces collided, producing a terrifying explosion and shockwave. However, neither of them retreated as they quickly brandished their swords again.

Fast. It was just too fast. The two of them had reached the peak of the Mythical stage. They were so fast that ordinary humans couldn’t see their battle.

All people could see were streams of light crisscrossing like sudden bolts of lightning. They flashed and vanished. Their figures couldn’t be seen, much less the sword moves.

Only a very small number of Epic experts with special sight-type skills or people with high-level sight-type Companion Beasts could see their battle clearly.

When Zhou Wen saw Ya’s sword technique, he was even more certain that he was Zhong Ziya. His sword technique was unrestrained and unbridled. Only someone with Zhong Ziya’s personality could master such a sword technique to its limits.

Uesugi Nao’s sword technique was actually more like a saber technique. It was also a model of swiftness, ruthlessness, and accuracy. Although Zhou Wen had previously fought her, it wasn’t a real battle. Now, he finally understood her strength. She undoubtedly had the standards of a top Mythical.

Of course, this was under the premise of fusing with Great Skyfiend. Without Great Skyfiend, Uesugi Nao was only at the Epic stage just like him.

However, a Guardian was a part of one’s strength. Just like how humans used pistols in the past. If one had good marksmanship, they could also be considered one of the strong.

Companion Beasts and Guardians shared the same principle. One’s own strength and external strength weren’t differentiated. Be it one’s own strength or external strength, as long as one could use it well, they were experts.

Uesugi Nao’s ability to perfectly control Great Skyfiend’s power meant that she was indeed very strong.

The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi and Primordial Immortal Sword constantly clashed. No one had the upper hand. Their techniques were mainly focused on attacking. There was basically no defense. Every strike looked abnormally perilous. It was pure offense that only allowed for one outcome—one of them had to die while the other lived.

After a while, Uesugi Nao realized that she was at a disadvantage. It wasn’t because her strength and technique were inferior to Ya’s, but because Ya’s speed was getting faster and faster. His strength was also getting stronger. The continuous battle didn’t seem to consume his strength and stamina. Instead, it made him even more ferocious and domineering.

The other party is good at prolonged battles. Uesugi Nao immediately realized that she couldn’t delay any further. People who were good at prolonged battles would definitely become stronger the longer they fought. If this dragged on, it would be very disadvantageous for her.

Without any hesitation, Uesugi Nao gathered her strength and slashed out Great Skyfiend’s Infinite Fiend Abyss. Black demonic aura transformed into darkness as it tore out and slashed at Ya.

Wherever the black demonic aura went, everything turned into darkness. In the blink of an eye, the cube’s screen turned black and nothing could be seen.

Zhou Wen hurriedly got up and ran towards the cube in the city. This was because the broadcast didn’t allow him to see through the darkness. He had to reach the cube to see what was happening inside the darkness.

The cube arena in the void was completely enveloped by darkness. As for Ya, his vision, hearing, and sense of smell in the darkness had been stripped away. Even when the blade slashed at him, he couldn’t feel anything, much less feel pain.

Looking at Ya, who was standing in the arena with a sword in hand, Uesugi Nao mercilessly slashed with her blade.

She knew that in the Infinite Fiend Abyss, her opponent’s senses would be stripped away. However, she wasn’t sure if her opponent had the ability to nullify Infinite Fiend Abyss. Therefore, she had to kill her opponent as quickly as possible.

Clang!

However, Ya moved in the darkness. Primordial Immortal Sword accurately blocked Uesugi Nao’s Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.

The blades constantly clashed. The Infinite Fiend Abyss wasn’t cracked, but Ya didn’t seem to be affected at all. He didn’t make any mistakes.

He has an ability that transcends the normal senses. Uesugi Nao immediately guessed the reason. In the Infinite Fiend Abyss, only people who had extra-sensory perception could be unaffected.

Unless Uesugi Nao could make Great Skyfiend break through to the Terror grade, Infinite Fiend Abyss was almost useless against people with extra-sensory perception.

After figuring this out, Uesugi Nao no longer wasted her Essence Energy and directly deactivated Infinite Fiend Abyss.

When Zhou Wen arrived above the cube, Uesugi Nao had already dispelled Infinite Fiend Abyss, revealing their figures again.

Zhou Wen wore the Invisibility Cloak and floated in the air as he watched the battle on the cube’s arena. Such a battle was already the pinnacle of humanity. The only pity was that they weren’t fighting purely with human strength.

Ya’s offensive was like a tidal wave. He didn’t have many tricks, nor did he have any complicated skills. He was just one man and one sword. He was presumptuous and arrogant. He relentlessly attacked, as if the word “defense” didn’t exist in his dictionary.

Seeing that Infinite Fiend Abyss didn’t have any effect, Uesugi Nao didn’t hesitate to use another of Great Skyfiend’s Mythical technique, Purgatory Fiend Flames.

The moment the sword slashed out, the demonic aura on the sword burned and turned into terrifying fiend flames. Uesugi Nao had used this move to instantly kill Heavy-Armored Titan.

It’s finally here! Zhou Wen stared at Uesugi Nao’s strike. He naturally knew that it was this move that had killed Heavy-Armored Titan.

However, no one knew what the exact function of this move was, nor did they know how to crack it.

If it were Zhou Wen, his movement technique was excellent. He wouldn’t need to take the risk and could directly dodge before counterattacking. That would prevent Uesugi Nao from hitting him.

However, Ya clearly did not share Zhou Wen’s habits. His sword didn’t seem to have the option of retreating or dodging. Primordial Immortal Sword continued advancing crazily.

The six families and many wealthy families stared intently at the two combatants. Even the great devils overseas were somewhat nervous. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Everyone wanted to know if Great Skyfiend’s one-hit kill of Heavy-Armored Titan could kill Ya.

Clang!

The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi and Primordial Immortal Sword collided fiercely. The Purgatory Fiend Flames on the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi immediately spread to Primordial Immortal Sword. Besides that, even Ya’s clothes, armor, and body began to burn with fiend flames.
