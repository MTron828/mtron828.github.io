Chapter 952: Black-Robed Chess Soul

There’s actually a Guardian cocoon here? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

Although there were many Guardian cocoons scattered across the world, the chances of encountering one weren’t high. It was considered lucky that they could encounter one in such an unknown dimensional zone.

“There’s a Chess Soul and a Guardian cocoon on the mountain.” Zhou Wen told Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan the situation.

Li Xuan’s interest was piqued when he heard that. “I really get what I want. I was just thinking of getting a Guardian to play with, but he came knocking on my door. If you aren’t interested, I’ll contract him for fun.”

“You have to think it through. Ignoring the possibility of being contracted, even if it can be contracted, such a contract doesn’t provide any guarantees. The Guardian might betray you at any time.” Zhou Wen explained matters pertaining to Guardians to Li Xuan.

Li Xuan thought nothing of it. “That’s good. No one has any restrictions. It’s just like finding a girlfriend. If we are suitable, we can be together. If we aren’t suitable, we can break up. You can’t just let the other person be with you forever regardless of whether you like them or not. That’s immoral.”

“Alright, as long as you are fine with it.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “However, you have to be careful. The one on the mountain is probably a Mythical Chess Soul. It’s still a question if your strategy will work.”

Li Xuan thought for a moment and said, “In fact, Chinese chess is a relatively simple game. It’s not as complicated as Go. Even a Grandmaster-level human at Chinese chess won’t find it easy to beat a computer at Chinese chess. If that Chess Soul follows the rules, there’s a high chance of me winning. I’m just afraid that he has some special means that can change the game.”

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “How about this? Don’t go up. I’ll help you play chess. You will contract the Guardian yourself. If anything happens, I can handle it myself.”

“Haha, I won’t stand on ceremony then.” Li Xuan handed his phone to Zhou Wen.

As there was no Internet here, he could only get Zhou Wen to use his phone which had the Chinese chess game installed and tell him how to operate it.

“Ya’er, it’s too dangerous up there. Wait for me here.” Zhou Wen put Ya’er down and got her to stay at the foot of the mountain while he took Li Xuan’s phone and went up Mt. Chinese Chess.

Zhou Wen had already made up his mind. If Li Xuan couldn’t contract it, he would attempt to kill the Guardian inside the cocoon. It could be considered as eliminating a future enemy.

The moment he took his first step on Mt. Chinese Chess, Zhou Wen felt the taboo power descend on him. Thankfully, the Heaven-Opening Scripture was effective. The restrictions were useless against him.

Knowing that the Heaven-Opening Scripture was useful, Zhou Wen felt relieved.

The black-robed Chess Soul sat in front of the chessboard. His appearance was no different from a real person. It was almost impossible to tell that he was a Spirit Body.

The chessboard here was much more exquisite. Not only was it engraved on the stone platform, but there were also stone blocks on both sides. After Zhou Wen sat down on the stone block opposite him, the black-robed Chess Soul finally opened his eyes. He looked at him with eyes that resembled dark abysses and said, “Are you prepared to bet on your fate as a chess player?”

“I’m ready.” Zhou Wen picked up Li Xuan’s phone and launched the Chinese chess app. He chose the highest difficulty level—Special Grandmaster.

As Zhou Wen was the first to move, he relaunched the game a few times. After he managed to get a round in which the computer made the first move, he followed the computer’s choice and chose to carry out a common opening—moving the Cannon.

The black-robed Chess Soul moved the Horse out without any change in expression.

Zhou Wen played chess with the black-robed Chess Soul according to the computer’s moves. The intensity exceeded his imagination as no winner could be determined.

Li Xuan also turned nervous when he saw this. Mythical Chess Souls are indeed extraordinary to be able to fight a Grandmaster without being at a disadvantage for so long. Will Zhou Wen be alright?

“Coach can resist dimensional zone rules. Even if he loses, he will be fine,” Feng Qiuyan said.

“That’s true, but what if...” Li Xuan felt uneasy.

In the end, neither side had the ability to kill the General. Unless one side made a fatal mistake, there was no chance of winning.

“Do you agree to a draw for this match?” the black-robed Chess Soul asked Zhou Wen.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen could tell that the computer was repeating the previous steps. There was no way to win.

“Restart,” the black-robed Chess Soul said before the chess pieces on the chessboard automatically returned to their starting positions.

“Since it’s a draw, I don’t plan on continuing.” Zhou Wen got up to leave, but he realized that he couldn’t leave the stone block.

“Since the game has already begun, we have to determine the victor,” said the black-robed Chess Soul.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he continued playing chess with the black-robed Chess Soul. However, the few subsequent rounds had neither side defeating the other’s General. All he could do was play again and again.

“The situation isn’t looking good. That black-robed Chess Soul is a little powerful. It can actually play so many rounds with a Grandmaster-level computer. Do you think the computer will screw up?” Li Xuan said. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The computer isn’t a human brain. It won’t make mistakes.” Feng Qiuyan also became nervous.

Although the computer’s standard was relatively stable and probably wouldn’t make any mistakes, the black-robed Chess Soul was actually able to keep drawing with the computer. It would be difficult to tell if something unexpected would happen.

“The treasure in your hand is rather interesting. It can actually calculate the various possibilities of each move and choose the optimal solution,” the black-robed Chess Soul suddenly said to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. The black soul Chess Soul’s intelligence was clearly much higher than the average Chess Soul. It could actually see through the problem with the mobile game.

Zhou Wen was somewhat worried if the black-robed Chess Soul would use any means to prevent his phone from functioning normally.

However, the black-robed Chess Soul didn’t have such plans. He looked at Zhou Wen and said indifferently, “It’s indeed very easy to win that way, but it’s not a sure win. I’ll win this round.”

Zhou Wen’s heart skipped a beat. In fact, it wasn’t that the computer wouldn’t lose. Furthermore, this was only a mobile game. The algorithm and calculation abilities weren’t especially strong.

The black-robed Chess Soul began another round, but this time, Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the aura on the black-robed Chess Soul was different. The intense confidence and determination to win were just too shocking.

Zhou Wen continued playing according to the computer’s moves, but even a chess rookie like Zhou Wen could sense that the situation was developing in a disadvantageous direction.

“Not good. This round isn’t good.” Feng Qiuyan, who had the best chess skills among the three of them, had already noticed that something was amiss.

“Prepare to help Old Zhou.” Li Xuan summoned his carapace and was prepared to fight.

Indeed, the subsequent situation became more and more disadvantageous for Zhou Wen. Finally, Zhou Wen’s General had nowhere to go. The word “victory” appeared in the mobile game. He had followed the black-robed Chess Soul’s moves and had actually won against the computer’s Special Grandmaster.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen switched to the Heaven-Opening Scripture and prepared to fight the black-robed Chess Soul.

The black-robed Chess Soul looked up and stared at Zhou Wen with a strange smile. “You want to contract the Guardian, right?”
