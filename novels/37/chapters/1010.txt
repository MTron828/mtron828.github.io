Chapter 1011: Destiny’s Draw

Translator: CKtalon

On the cube’s rankings, Guardians had already begun challenging each other to obtain a higher ranking.

People believed that Guardians should aim for first place. Rankings other than first didn’t seem to be of much use. They should challenge Ya, who was first.

However, in fact, no one challenged Ya. The challenged Guardians were basically ranked above fifth place.

This also allowed people to finally see how powerful Guardians were. Humans with Guardians were equivalent to Mythical creatures. They could have all sorts of Companion Beasts and Mythical skills. They were far stronger than a single Mythical Companion Beast.

The battle between Guardians was far more complicated and interesting than the battle between Companion Beasts.

Once a Companion Beast was defeated, there was no hope of a comeback. However, the battle between Guardians was ever-changing. Any factor could change the outcome of the battle.

Apart from Lie, who had mysteriously vanished from the rankings, there were more and more challenges for the Guardians ranked beyond fifth place. Many new Guardians also joined the rankings.

However, it was obvious that they didn’t know each other well. They were also testing the other party’s abilities. They didn’t really fight to the death, and it was very likely that they were hiding many abilities.

Even so, it was still extremely satisfying to watch. Now, just the battle of Companion Beasts was no longer able to attract attention.

All over the world, people were discussing the problem of Guardians. There were also people secretly searching for Guardian cocoons, hoping to contract one and gain success in one step.

Guardians were just too attractive to ordinary people. As long as one was lucky and obtained the Guardian’s recognition, they could ascend to the Mythical stage in a single step. This was more attractive than any treasure.

It was obvious that many new Guardians were on the rankings.

However, the trouble that followed seemed to have just begun. In several places in the Federation, there were incidents of Guardians committing crimes.

Guardians owned by unknown humans had a terrifying propensity to commit crime.

Although the Federation had already tried its best to maintain the situation, its control over the various lands was weakening day by day. Unless the Guardians were suicidal and went to the territories controlled by the six families, the chances of capturing them were slim.

“The appearance of Guardians is really not a good thing for the Federation,” Sadie, who was watching the news, said with a frown.

“The Guardians these days aren’t actually that terrifying. After all, those who have obtained Guardians didn’t have a good foundation in the past. It’s not difficult to deal with them even after they obtain a Guardian. However, with the passage of time, these fellows will truly create chaos when they have all sorts of Mythical Companion Eggs,” said Lance.

“Isn’t the ultimate battle happening in a month?” Sadie said.

“In a month, it will only determine the ownership of the Dimensional Wheel, but the battle between Guardians has only just begun. To truly resolve the problem of Guardians, relying on the King of Earth is useless. They are jackals of the same tribe,” said Lance.

“Is there still a way out?” Sadie said after some thought.

“Yes. Just kill all the Guardians like Zhou Wen,” said Lance.

“How many freaks like Zhou Wen can you find in the Federation?” Sadie smiled bitterly.

“Fight fire with fire,” Lance said slowly.

Sadie immediately understood what Lance meant. Since Guardians were difficult to eliminate, they could only contract Guardians themselves and use Guardians to kill Guardians.

“I’m just afraid that it will leave latent problems for the future,” Sadie said.

“It’s better than nothing.” Lance paused before saying, “After I get the mask from the Maze of Lies, I’ll think of a way to contract a Guardian.”

Sadie wanted to say something, but she opened her mouth and ultimately didn’t say anything.

In this era, the path ahead was filled with fog. No one knew which path was correct. Only by taking one would one know.

However, no one knew if the person who walked out would return alive.

“How’s Zhou Wen?” Lance asked again.

“He went a few times, but he rarely entered the Maze of Lies. He hasn’t entered the dimensional zone since Friday,” Sadie answered.

“That’s normal. When the people invited by the family arrive, we can enter the maze together,” Lance said with a slight nod.

...

Zhou Wen once again entered Sunday’s Maze of Lies. The Devil Clown didn’t seem to have respawned. Zhou Wen once again arrived at the Divination House and saw the twin-like witches.

Just like the last time, they extended the cards in their hands and got Zhou Wen to draw them.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and decided to try it out. He wanted to see what tricks they had up their sleeves. It wouldn’t be too late to deal with them after he figured it out. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“How many do I have to draw?” Zhou Wen asked the twin witches.

“One,” the two witches answered in unison.

“One card per deck?” Zhou Wen looked at the two different black and white poker cards and asked.

“Just one,” the witches answered again.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and got the blood-colored avatar to draw one from the black-robed witch’s white poker cards.

This should be something like a tarot card, right? Zhou Wen thought as he flipped the card over. However, the card he saw had nothing to do with tarot cards.

On the white card was a black symbol. It was a black silhouette. Although it was only a silhouette and its appearance couldn’t be seen, one could naturally associate it with a western mythical figure that had a large and long sickle.

“Is this Death?” Zhou Wen asked the witch in puzzlement.

“Yes,” the black-robed witch answered with a nod.

“What does drawing this card mean?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“It means that Death will take your life,” the black-robed witch answered.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he suddenly realized that a black shadow, Death, similar to the card had appeared behind the blood-colored avatar. Without waiting for the blood-colored avatar to react, Death slashed down and killed it.

The blood-colored avatar’s armor didn’t work. It was as though Death had reaped its soul and not its body.

Looking at the black screen, Zhou Wen had no choice but to drip his blood to revive. This time, Zhou Wen drew one from the white-robed witch’s black poker cards.

A black Death can be drawn on a white poker card. I don’t think I can draw that on a black poker card, right? Zhou Wen thought as he drew a black card.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed when he flipped the card over. There was a white shadow on the black card. Even if he couldn’t see its appearance, the wings and the halo above his head undoubtedly meant that it was an angel card.

“This should be an angel, right? What does he represent? Did I win?” Zhou Wen asked the white-robed witch.

“No, this means that he will take you to Heaven,” the white-robed witch said calmly.

In the next second, Zhou Wen saw the angel’s shadow appear behind the blood-colored avatar. Then, a white light flew out from the blood-colored avatar’s head and it collapsed to the ground. The game screen went black again.
