Chapter 1470 Touch

Zhou Wen waited for a while, but no one came out. He said, “Sweetie, I know you’re here. Come out.”

Sweetie walked out of a tree not far away after a while. She lowered her head and avoided eye contact like a child who had made a mistake.

“You were the one who helped me block that punch, right?” Zhou Wen immediately understood that his guess was right when he saw Sweetie.

Before Demonic Neonate could ring the Heaven Shrouding Bell and before Zhou Wen could kneel, the humanoid monster’s fist had suddenly stopped. It definitely wasn’t a coincidence.

After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that Sweetie was the most likely candidate.

“I didn’t mean to save you. It’s just a coincidence. Yes, a coincidence.” Sweetie lowered her head and fiddled with her clothes, not daring to look up at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but pity Sweetie when he saw that she was like a child who wasn’t good at expressing herself. He reached out to stroke her hair.

This was because Zhou Wen was an introverted person. Even though he treated others well, he wasn’t willing to say it out loud. Sweetie reminded Zhou Wen of himself.

Sweetie was flustered and didn’t think too much. When Zhou Wen touched her hair, she suddenly recalled that sinners couldn’t be touched-they would be turned into gold.

“No!” Sweetie exclaimed as she retreated. However, she knew that it was too late. She looked at Zhou Wen and was alarmed to discover him standing there with his hand still in the air. He looked extremely puzzled as though he was surprised by Sweetie’s reaction.

“You… you’re fine?” Sweetie realized that Zhou Wen hadn’t turned into gold. He didn’t have any metal on him, much less turn into gold.

“I’m fine.” Only then did Zhou Wen recall that the people who had turned into gold seemed to be related to Sweetie. He couldn’t help but break out into a cold sweat.

“Try touching me again.” Sweetie still couldn’t believe that Zhou Wen hadn’t turned into gold when he touched her.

Zhou Wen was a big baddie from every angle she could tell. He was definitely riddled with sins, but she found it unbelievable that Zhou Wen wouldn’t turn into a golden statue.

“There’s no need, right?” Zhou Wen took half a step back. He was afraid that it had been an accident. An adverse outcome would be bad if he touched her again.

“It’ll be fine.” Sweetie stubbornly walked in front of Zhou Wen and reached out to grab his hand before placing it on her head.

Indeed, Zhou Wen didn’t show any signs of turning into gold. Not only did he not turn into gold, but there was also a mysterious force that quickly healed Zhou Wen’s injuries.

Such serious injuries recovered in just moments. There were no longer any signs of injury.

Zhou Wen was alarmed, but he heaved a sigh of relief. He bent his fingers slightly and ruffled Sweetie’s hair. “Thank you for saving me. Tell me what you want. I’ll definitely deliver it to you as long as I can obtain it.” Sweetie shook her head and said with a strange expression, “I don’t want anything. Furthermore, I’ve already broken the rules. Someone will soon take me away. I’m afraid we won’t have the chance to meet again in the future.”

“What rules did you violate? Who will take you away? With your abilities, who can take you away if you don’t wish to leave?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

Sweetie only shook her head and didn’t answer Zhou Wen’s question. She pushed away his hand that was pressing on her head and glared at him. “Don’t let me know about any evil you do in the future, or I won’t spare you.” With that said, Sweetie turned around and left.

“Wait.” Zhou Wen pondered for a moment and stopped Sweetie.

“What for?” Sweetie turned her head and asked.

“This is yours, right?” Zhou Wen took out the candy box and lemon candy and threw them at Sweetie.

“So it was with you. Where did you get it?” Sweetie caught the candy box and the lemon candy and couldn’t help but be stunned.

Zhou Wen recounted the process of obtaining the candy box and the lemon candy. After Sweetie heard that, she muttered to herself thoughtfully, “I see. So that’s how it is. It’s no wonder I couldn’t find it despite searching for so long. So she stole it.”

“Now that the item has returned to its rightful owner, you should be at ease,” Zhou Wen said.

“What’s there to worry about? I’ve never been worried.” Sweetie didn’t know why, but she suddenly felt angry. She threw the candy box and lemon candy at Zhou Wen and said angrily, “Who wants your things? Since you painstakingly obtained them, keep them for yourself.”

With that said, she vanished without giving Zhou Wen a chance to speak.

“Since you’re here to find these things, why don’t you want them?” Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure out what Sweetie was up to. However, since it was Sweetie’s, the candy probably wasn’t ordinary. Zhou Wen didn’t dare use it recklessly as he put away the candy and candy box.

When Zhou Wen stormed back to the city, he saw that Luoyang’s reinforcements had arrived. They were setting up the defenses, gradually bringing the skeleton army in the vicinity of Guide Ancient City under control.

“Young Master, the situation is already under control. You don’t have to worry.” An Sheng had personally led his men over to provide support. It was obvious that Luoyang valued this matter greatly. “Guide Ancient City has a terrifying creature inside. Don’t let anyone in,” Zhou Wen said to An Sheng.

“What creature is it?” An Sheng asked.

“I don’t know.” Zhou Wen didn’t know what kind of creature the humanoid monster was. Perhaps he had been human in the past, but now, he existed as a dimensional creature. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Up to now, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand what the three conditions he mentioned meant. Why were there three conditions?

“Young Master, I’m afraid it won’t be easy to stay in Guide City. Overseer has the intention of migrating everyone in Guide City to Luoyang,” An Sheng whispered.

“Why? Isn’t the situation under control now?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Young Master, you are from Guide City. You should know how many terrifying legends there are in this place. Guide Ancient City is only the beginning. Places like Butterfly Valley will definitely suffer a breakout in the future. Ignoring the fact that Guide City’s military can’t hold the line now, if all the mysteries here break out, they probably won’t be able to hold on even if all of Luoyang’s army is deployed,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen naturally knew how terrifying the myths in Guide City were. From the ancient mythical era to the feudal dynasty, this place had once been under the dazzling spotlight. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were more or less related to this area. There were also countless famous and virtuous paragons like Lao Tze who were born in this area. The Butterfly Valley with the Essence Crystal mine was also near Guide City. Zhou Wen had always suspected that it had something to do with Master Zhuang.
