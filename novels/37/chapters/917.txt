Chapter 918: Soul Cage

“Ah!” Another tragic cry came from the lake. Zhou Wen originally imagined that it would be the scarecrow, but to his surprise, he realized that it was Yin Talisman King.

Yin Talisman King’s hand had penetrated the scarecrow’s chest and grabbed one of its hands. However, the scarecrow stood in front of him expressionlessly. The Essence Energy in Yin Talisman King’s body quickly flowed into the scarecrow’s body.

Yin Talisman King wanted to shake off the scarecrow, but it seemed to be sucked in. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t shake it off. As for the scarecrow, it approached his body as though it was about to cling to him.

Boom! Zhou Wen saw an immortal glow circulate over Yin Talisman King’s palm. A strange symbol swirled in his palm and forcefully blasted the scarecrow’s body.

The scarecrow’s body slid across the lake like a skater, but its actions were extremely strange. As it contorted its body and slid towards Yin Talisman King, it reached out to grab at him.

Yin Talisman King and the scarecrow fought above the lake, but neither gained an advantage. If it wasn’t for the mysterious symbols on his hands that could restrain the demonic aura on the scarecrow, Yin Talisman King would have long been sucked dry by the scarecrow.

Even so, Yin Talisman King wasn’t having it good either. He couldn’t see, so he could only rely on his other senses to make up for his shortcomings. At the same time, he didn’t dare touch any other spot of the scarecrow.

The scarecrow was like an elegant figure skater. Its body moved strangely on the surface of the lake as it attacked Yin Talisman King in all sorts of elegant and strange poses.

The spot on Yin Talisman King’s crystalline Terror form where the scarecrow had touched immediately turned black, as though ink had seeped into his flesh.

What a terrifying scarecrow! Zhou Wen was alarmed. The powerful Yin Talisman King was actually suppressed to such a sorry state in front of the scarecrow.

Yin Talisman King’s Five-Elemental Escape technique didn’t seem to be of much use in front of the scarecrow. As he moved in the water, the scarecrow’s figure turned into black smoke and dissipated. By the time he escaped from the water, the scarecrow had already condensed beside him.

The two invincible existences at the Terror grade didn’t seem to erupt with earth-shattering strength, but their battle was extremely harrowing. If it were an ordinary Mythical creature, they probably wouldn’t be able to withstand a single strike and would die tragically.

Strength wasn’t purely based on one’s destructive power. Some forces might not look very destructive, but could lead to death upon contact.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to take the opportunity to escape, but after hiding in the water and peeping for a while, he dispelled the thought of immediately escaping.

Yin Talisman King was proficient in the Five-Elemental Escape technique. If he really wanted to escape, he could escape far away. It was likely that the scarecrow wouldn’t be able to catch up to him so easily.

However, Yin Talisman King only escaped in a small area and didn’t go far. It was obvious that he hadn’t given up on the purple bronze ball and wanted to snatch it back from the scarecrow.

In fact, the scarecrow only used one hand to fight. Its other hand held the purple bronze ball tightly. Clearly, it also valued the purple bronze ball.

Zhou Wen secretly summoned Demonic Neonate and hid in the lake with her, hoping to wait for an opportunity. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Demonic Neonate’s large eyes sized up the scarecrow and Yin Talisman King. Clearly, she was also judging the situation and looking for an opportunity.

Although Yin Talisman King was suppressed by the scarecrow, his life wasn’t in danger. During the battle, Yin Talisman King was still shouting sternly, “Who are you? Are you a fiend? I was once a peer of the fiends’ Guardian...”

However, the scarecrow ignored him. It circled around Yin Talisman King like a ghost and attacked him, putting him in grave danger.

Seeing that Yin Dark Talisman King seemed to have the intention of retreating, Zhou Wen thought to himself, If I let him escape, I won’t be the scarecrow’s match. I’m afraid I won’t be able to retrieve the purple bronze ball. How can I stop Yin Talisman King from running and fight the scarecrow to an internecine outcome?

However, after some thought, there seemed to be nothing he could do. Unless he sealed off all the five elements when dealing with a person who was proficient in the Five-Elemental Escape technique, it was impossible to stop him from escaping.

Indeed, when Yin Talisman King realized that he couldn’t turn the tables and gradually couldn’t withstand the scarecrow’s attacks, he already had the intention to retreat.

After dodging the scarecrow’s attack, Yin Talisman King used Water Escape to reach the edge of the lake and leaped towards the shore. Half of his body had already touched the ground he wanted to escape through. He wanted to leave this place and wait for his injuries to heal before seeking revenge on the scarecrow.

However, Yin Talisman King’s expression suddenly changed. He felt as though a force that came from his soul was sucking at his soul, pulling him into the lake.

Just as Yin Talisman King had landed on the ground, he fell back into the lake.

“Soul Cage!” Yin Talisman King turned pale and couldn’t help but shout.

Zhou Wen also saw an extremely strange scene. The scarecrow stood on the surface of the lake, its body wrapped in a black-robed demonic smoke, but its body made of straw emitted a soul-like holy brilliance.

The entire lake emitted a white soul glow like a holy lake.

Yin Talisman King rushed out of the lake, but a transparent shadow was locked inside. Then, Yin Talisman King’s body seemed to be pulled back by a rubber band.

The transparent shadow also fused with his body, and the scarecrow transformed into demonic smoke again and gracefully attacked.

Zhou Wen was alarmed as well. Taking advantage of their battle, he swam towards the bank, hoping to leave the lake.

However, just as he climbed ashore, he felt something in the lake affecting him, making him want to throw himself into the lake uncontrollably.

Could the Soul Cage that Yin Talisman King mentioned really imprison souls? Zhou Wen realized that Demon God Catalog and Mirror Eyes were useless, so he switched to the Supreme Hell King Life Soul.

The moment Supreme Hell King Life Soul appeared, Zhou Wen’s entire body transformed into a Hell King state. The force that was pulling him suddenly vanished as Zhou Wen finally rushed ashore.

When he turned his head, he saw that the lake wasn’t glowing at all. He couldn’t even see the lake. Countless bones sank to the bottom of the lake, and in the lake were countless wailing, struggling, and entangled wraiths. The lake was like a living hell, and the scarecrow that emitted demonic aura was the king of this purgatory.

Countless wraiths entangled Yin Talisman King’s soul. His body could leave the lake, but his soul was entangled by countless wraiths.

Some wraiths wanted to entangle Zhou Wen, but the moment they touched Zhou Wen’s Supreme Hell King body, they were immediately burned by invisible flames. One of their hands turned to ashes.

As for the invisible flames, they remained undying. They spread across the wraith’s body until it completely turned to dust before disappearing.
