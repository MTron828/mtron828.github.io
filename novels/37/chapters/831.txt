Chapter 832: Pill Essences

Translator: CKtalon

He originally imagined that the Zhang family needed him to do something very dangerous, but after hearing this, he realized that there was no need for him to fight. They mainly needed Tyrant Behemoth’s strength.

At the entrance of the Fiend Tomb, there was a type of Fiend Stone that could keep growing. Wherever the Fiend Stone grew, the creatures in the Fiend Tomb could reach it. It was equivalent to a break out.

Dealing with Fiend Stones was very troublesome. One couldn’t shatter them, much less place them anywhere. This was because even if Fiend Stones were shattered into powder, they would continue to grow as though they were alive.

Shattering Fiend Stones or taking them elsewhere would only make them occupy more places.

These Fiend Stones didn’t pose much of a threat, but wherever it was, the creatures in the Fiend Tomb could pass through.

Of course, this was only one of the problems with the Fiend Tomb. Zhou Wen wasn’t from the Zhang family after all, so he wasn’t briefed about the Fiend Tomb’s other problems. All he needed to do was control Tyrant Behemoth to have it eat the additional Fiend Stones.

“If that’s the case, I naturally won’t shirk my duty. However, we still have to see if Behemoth will eat those Fiend Stones when the time comes. If it doesn’t, there’s nothing we can do,” Zhou Wen said.

“Of course. I’m just afraid that it won’t be able to finish all the Fiend Stones.” Zhang Chunqiu was in a better mood when he saw Zhou Wen agree.

Zhou Wen wasn’t worried about that. He had seen Behemoth’s appetite before, so eating a small mountain wasn’t a problem.

The two of them chatted for a while before Zhang Yuzhi walked in. She was very happy to see Zhou Wen. After all, she seldom had friends visiting her.

In fact, even if someone wanted to look for her, they probably wouldn’t be able to enter Celestial Master Manor. Even Moses, who was a member of the six families, had to stay in a courtyard instead of Celestial Master Manor.

“There are many interesting things about Mount Dragon Tiger. Let Yuzhi take you around.” Zhang Chunqiu bade farewell and left.

Zhang Yuzhi led Zhou Wen out of the Celestial Master Manor and as they walked, said , “You must have been to many dimensional zones, but we have a dimensional creature here that you definitely haven’t seen elsewhere.”

“What dimensional creature is it?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

“You’ll know when we get there.” Zhang Yuzhi acted all mysterious and refused to explain.

She took Zhou Wen on a boat and they drifted down a river. The scenery on both sides of the river was like a fairyland. There were no ferocious dimensional creatures to be seen. It was no wonder the Zhang family could live here.

If there were dimensional creatures everywhere, it would probably be difficult for the Zhang family to live in peace.

Not long after the boat set off, Zhou Wen saw red rocks that made the area appear to have a red bed with steep cliffs along its sides. And in between the mountains and rivers was a strange hill.

The hill was situated alone in the water, revealing itself over the surface of the water. It looked like a huge pill furnace, and the red color suited the scenery.

“The dimensional creature is over there,” Zhang Yuzhi said as she pointed at the hill.

“You mean that hill is a dimensional creature?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“Just wait and see,” Zhang Yuzhi said as she summoned a bow and shot an arrow at the hill.

When the arrow flew to the cauldron-like hill, it spewed out a beam of light. A red pill flew out and struck the arrow, shattering it.

The pill circled the hill a few times before charging at Zhou Wen and company.

“It’s very difficult for you to see the pill essences from Pill Furnace Mountain elsewhere. This red color is at the Legendary stage, while the golden one is at the Epic stage. If you can see a pill essence with dragon patterns or tiger patterns, it will be at the Mythical stage. However, they are very rare.” As Zhang Yuzhi spoke, she reached out and grabbed the red pill essence. No matter how it struggled, it couldn’t escape.

Zhang Yuzhi had no intention of killing it. She touched it with her hand and the pill essence calmed down. It obediently stayed in her palm. Even when Zhang Yuzhi released her grip, it didn’t escape.

“What’s the use of these pill essence Companion Beasts? Can they treat injuries?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

“Some pill essences have healing abilities, but different pill essences have different abilities. For example, Poison Avoidance Pill Essence can detoxify, Rejuvenation Pill Essence can treat injuries, and some pill essences have poison-elemental abilities. They are all different.”

Zhang Yuzhi pointed at the pill essence hill and continued, “If you’re interested, you can give it a try. If you can find a Mythical Rejuvenation Pill Essence or Resurrection Pill Essences, that would be awesome.”

“What uses do they have?” Zhou Wen asked.

“How stupid. You can tell from the name. Any one of them has the ability to revive the nearly dead. No matter how serious their injuries are, as long as they still have a breath left, they can be saved,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“Is it that powerful?” Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted.

“Of course it’s powerful. However, pill essence Companion Beasts are single-use. They are gone after being used. Our Zhang family didn’t obtain many of them. It’s rare to see pill essences of such stages pass through a spatial rift, so to see it requires some luck,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“Alright, I’ll try my luck. Perhaps I’ll be lucky.” Zhou Wen was interested and asked Zhang Yuzhi what to do.

“The pill essences that come through the dimensional rift are all in Pill Furnace Mountain. You just need to lure them out. It’s not complicated. Just make some noise. However, don’t keep your hopes up. It’s rare to see a Mythical pill essence,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen summoned a Poison Bat and made it fly towards Pill Furnace Mountain.

Indeed, just as the Poison Bat approached the Pill Furnace Mountain, it alarmed the pill essences inside. Another pill essence flew out. It was also a pill essence that was as red as fire. It looked like it was at the Legendary stage.

The pill essence’s combat strength was lacking. It could only emit Pill Aura attacks that were similar to Essence Energy waves. Its might wasn’t very strong either, so it was instantly shattered by the Poison Bat.

The Poison Bat circled around the Pill Furnace Mountain for quite some time, causing pill essences to fly out one after another. However, most of them were at the Legendary stage. Even Epic ones were rare, much less Mythical ones. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Despite finally killing an Epic pill essence, nothing dropped.

“Haha, it looks like you are also down on your luck. Not even a Legendary Companion Beast dropped much less a Mythical pill essence,” Zhang Yuzhi said with a smile.

Zhou Wen was somewhat indignant as he used Truth Listener’s ability to see if there were any Mythical pill essences in Pill Furnace Mountain.

However, after giving it a try, he realized that Truth Listener’s hearing couldn’t penetrate deep into Pill Furnace Mountain. Inside Pill Furnace Mountain was an independent dimensional zone.

From the looks of it, this Mount Dragon Tiger is similar to Dragon Gate Grotto. It’s a dimensional zone formed by many small dimensional zones. Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he wanted to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol.

If he could download the Dragon Tiger Mountain dungeon, he wouldn’t have to worry in the future. He could slowly grind for Mythical pill essences.
