Chapter 1784 Power of the Human World

Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan’s two battles with Transcendent Immortal had already made everyone aware of the gap between humans and Transcendent Immortal.

Be it Zhong Ziya or Jiang Yan, their strength was greatly inferior to that of a Transcendent Immortal at the beginning of the battle. It was almost an insurmountable gap.

It didn’t seem wise for Zhou Wen to fight Transcendent Immortal head-on.

“Ignorant human.” Transcendent Immortal was as still as a mountain. The thousands of sword beams were less than a meter away from her, but they seemed to be frozen.

Instead of describing them as frozen, the sword beams were still moving, albeit very slowly. They were so slow that the movement couldn’t be seen with the naked eye. It could hardly traverse one-thousandth of a meter in ten thousand years.

Everyone seemed to freeze with the sword beam, and even their breathing seemed to stop.

Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan had attempted different methods to crack Transcendent Heaven’s powers. Then, what method would Zhou Wen use to crack that insurmountable power?

They weren’t as wild as Zhong Ziya or as confident as Jiang Yan. There weren’t even any deliberate variations. They were the same seemingly infinite sword beams as more and more of them gathered in front of Transcendent Immortal.

“Great things are done by a series of small things brought together. Is he trying to crack it with absolute strength? Is this really feasible?” Professor Gu explained in a questioning tone, clearly not agreeing with this method.

“Using quantity to result in a qualitative change might be a feasible path…” Su Yi’s tone wasn’t that firm.

In fact, everyone knew very well that with the characteristics of Transcendent Heaven, it was useless to just accumulate strength.

Luoyang’s An family.

An Tianzuo—who always spoke nastily-was silently watching the Cube’s screen.

......

An Sheng turned to look at An Tianzuo, finding it a little strange that An Tianzuo didn’t flare up this time. Zhou Wen was taking more risks than ever before.

“Is it strange?” An Tianzuo asked indifferently as he watched the scene.

“Yes, Young Master Wen is in danger this time. If he loses, he probably won’t even have a chance to escape.” It was rare for An Sheng to speak so calmly.

“It’s precisely because failure is not an option that it’s meaningless to say anything.”

“Then, shouldn’t you be angrier?” An Sheng asked in confusion.

An Tianzuo smiled. “Men always have things they have to do despite knowing that it’s impossible. Only such a man can be called a brother of mine.”

An Sheng almost thought that there was something wrong with his ears. He really couldn’t imagine those words coming out of An Tianzuo’s mouth.

“Is this all you have?” Transcendent Immortal ignored the increasing number of sword beams in front of her.

The difference in levels couldn’t be changed simply by accumulating strength. “You’re inferior to those two arrogant fellows. It seems like the providence of humans ends here.” Transcendent Immortal was no longer in the mood to watch Zhou Wen’s clumsy performance. Her finger moved slightly in preparation to crack the sword beam and deliver a fatal blow to Zhou Wen.

But the moment Transcendent Immortal raised her finger, the seemingly still sword beam suddenly moved.

From extreme stillness to extreme movement, the sword beam struck Transcendent Immortal at a speed indiscernible by the naked eye like a galaxy pouring down.

Rumble!

Sword beams raged as Transcendent Immortal’s body flew out amidst the sword beam and slammed into the hall’s wall.

The infinite stream of swords exploded, instantly turning the entire scene into chaotic sword beam shards. For a moment, nothing could be seen clearly.

After all the light dissipated, people saw Transcendent Immortal embedded in the hall’s wall that had been blasted into by the sword beam.

The armor on her body had cracked, and her face was smeared lightly with blood. Blood was still seeping out of the corners of her mouth.

“Heavens! Transcendent Immortal is injured!” someone exclaimed, almost unable to believe their eyes. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The powerful Transcendent Immortal had actually been injured by Zhou Wen head-on. After watching the two previous battles, such a scene seemed like a dream.

“Zhou Wen, well done!” Su Yi shouted excitedly.

People also seemed to see a glimmer of hope. The figure standing quietly in front of the hall seemed to give humans hope amidst despair.

“What power is that?” Transcendent Immortal’s body was trapped in the wall as she stared at Zhou Wen and asked.

“The power of the human world,” Zhou Wen replied calmly.

This sentence sounded like Zhou Wen was responding to her mockery of humans, but Zhou Wen didn’t mean that. The power of the human world he was talking about was the Human Realm domain he had obtained after advancing to the Calamity grade.

Zhou Wen’s Human Realm domain was very simple. Using his own logic to describe it, it could be described by: genuine.

When the human world was genuine, a fantasy without illusions, there would only be a cruel reality.

All rules other than the mortal world’s rules were illusory. It wasn’t determined by human emotions.

To put it simply, all the rules other than the mortal world’s rules were useless in the Human Realm domain.

The power of Transcendent Heaven didn’t belong to the mortal world, so it naturally wasn’t of any use in the Human Realm domain.

However, even Zhou Wen didn’t expect the power of the Human Realm domain to be so effective. Even an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse couldn’t break through its restrictions.

“Impressive. Then, let me see what kind of power the human world has.” Transcendent Immortal’s body slowly escaped the wall. As she moved, the wounds on her body quickly healed. Even her clothes and armor strangely recovered.

Boom!

Just as Transcendent Immortal escaped, Zhou Wen appeared in front of her as if he had teleported. He punched her chest and blasted her into the depression in the wall again.

A barrage of attacks poured down as shimmering fists crazily struck Transcendent Immortal’s body.

The light blasts constantly flickered. The fluid actions and the feeling of each punch striking flesh was a delightful scene.

Many people couldn’t help but be excited. The seemingly lofty and invincible Transcendent Immortal was actually being steamrolled by Zhou Wen, making their blood boil with excitement.

Before this battle began, nobody had expected such a situation. Nobody expected Transcendent Immortal to be completely defeated by Zhou Wen. It seemed like she didn’t even have the strength to counterattack.

“It’s so brutal… Zhou Wen is so strong…” Su Yi shouted without regard for her image, her voice a little hoarse.

“Beautifully done!” Professor Gu also clenched his fists excitedly.

In the Overseer Manor, An Tianzuo kept frowning and silently watched the scene.

Boom!

Under Zhou Wen’s crazy bombardment, the hall’s walls finally couldn’t take it any longer. Transcendent Immortal’s body was blasted into the hall like a sandbag, and rubble and dust flew everywhere.

“Maybe… it really will work…” An Sheng stared at the scene and unconsciously clenched his fists, his palms sweating nervously.
