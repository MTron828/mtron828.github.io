Chapter 1189: Incomplete Sword Pill

Although Sword Pill was in the form of a sword, its essence was a Qi Refinement technique. It was a technique that absorbed the Heaven and Earth energies for its own use.

In ancient times, Qi Refinement warriors pursued Qi Refinement to strengthen themselves to reach the ethereal realm of immortality.

Although he had never heard of any Qi Refinement warrior reaching the realm of immortality, it was an extension of humanity’s pursuit of life.

Zhou Wen condensed his energy into a sword. Instead of saying that he was practicing his sword art, it was better to say that he was converting his beliefs into a sword.

My mind is on the sword. Life and death are separated by a thought. I only wish for my thoughts to be free in this life. What has my next life got to do with me? Zhou Wen engraved the Sword Pill repeatedly, hoping to draw it into the shape of a sword.

At that moment, what Zhou Wen was drawing wasn’t a sword, but his beliefs. The sword was akin to him as a person—his heart. The more resilient his heart was, the sharper the sword.

I’d rather be average in an aboveboard manner than compromise my values. The sword that Zhou Wen had drawn was just and moderate; its blade was straight, in the most traditional East District sword style. The sword was like its owner, and this sword was a reflection of Zhou Wen.

However, the sword engraved on the Wheel of Destiny failed to help Sword Pill advance to the Terror grade.

What’s missing? What’s missing? Zhou Wen reflected on himself. In his hundred years of meditation, he had spent relatively less time on the Qi Refinement Art and Sword Pill.

It wasn’t because Zhou Wen didn’t like using swords, but because the Qi Refinement Art was too monotonous. Just practicing and comprehending summarized the essence of this Essence Energy Art.

However, with his body trapped, Zhou Wen could only hypothesize without actual practice. Without being able to practice, he lacked the most basic step, making it very difficult for him to take the next step forward. Thus, Zhou Wen hadn’t spent too much time on Qi Refinement.

Zhou Wen slashed down again and again, carving the Sword Pill over and over again. The Sword Pill he drew was somewhat different every time, but none of them could stabilize the Wheel of Destiny. Clearly, he hadn’t truly found his Sword Heart.

What’s my Sword Heart? Killing? Protection? Acting recklessly? None of them seem to be the case. Zhou Wen realized that he didn’t seem to understand himself.

He failed again and again. It had been a long time since Zhou Wen had failed like this. The previous few Essence Energy Arts had successfully completed a Terror transformation, making him feel a little smug. He felt that he would achieve the remaining few Essence Energy Arts in just a matter of time.

Does it still not work? The Sword Pill that had been engraved on the Wheel of Destiny vanished again, leaving Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.

Sometimes, the hardest thing to understand wasn’t one’s opponent, but oneself. This was because one could see others, but not oneself.

Before a mirror appeared, no one knew what they looked like. It could be said that they were their most familiar strangers.

A mirror reflects the body; whereas a person reflects the heart. I haven’t met a person who can let me see myself for who I am. I’m afraid it will be difficult for me to condense a true Sword Heart... Zhou Wen’s mind raced.

He knew where his flaws were, but he had no intention of giving up. He wanted to take another path.

Since I still don’t understand my heart, can I use other methods to replace it? Zhou Wen thought of the Immortal Culling Sword.

Back when he slew Di Tian with a single strike, he had personally experienced the terrifying sword intent of the Immortal Culling Sword. No one understood the concepts and beliefs in that sword better than him.

As Zhou Wen recalled the Immortal Culling Sword, he continued carving on the Wheel of Destiny.

Lu Bushun and company watched Zhou Wen slash the Three-Lives Stone countless times, but none of them left a mark. Instead, the sword condensed in his hand shattered again and again. They had lost hope.

“Overseer, can we think of a way to cross the Bridge of Helplessness without passing it?” Lu Bushun said as he sized up the River of Forgetfulness.

An Sheng shook his head and said, “Legend has it that the River of Forgetfulness is the boundary between the two worlds. It’s no longer a matter of distance from the world of the living to the world of the dead. If we could cross the Bridge of Helplessness without taking it, there wouldn’t be so many wraiths trapped in the River of Forgetfulness.”

“But we can’t continue like this. Young Master Wen’s sword art is so powerful, yet he can’t leave a mark on the Three-Lives Stone. I’m afraid we won’t be able to take this path,” Lu Bushun said with a sigh.

“Overseer, why don’t I go over and take a look first?” An Sheng suggested. He wanted to cross the Bridge of Helplessness to find Ouyang Lan and company.

“Wait a little longer,” An Tianzuo said as he looked in the direction of the Bridge of Helplessness.

Lu Bushun and company were somewhat puzzled. They didn’t know what An Tianzuo was waiting for, but An Tianzuo’s words were military orders. They didn’t dare ask further and could only continue waiting.

Meanwhile, the sword transformed from the Sword Pill in Zhou Wen’s hand increasingly resembled Immortal Culling Sword.

The more Sword Pill resembled Immortal Culling Sword, the more illusory it looked to others. It was so indiscernible that it was close to vanishing.

Clang!

A strange sword hum alarmed the talking Lu Bushun and company. Everyone turned their heads and saw Zhou Wen standing in front of the Three-Lives Stone bare-handed. There was a foot-long sword mark on the indestructible Three-Lives Stone.

Following that, they saw Zhou Wen move his palm in the air as though he was holding an invisible sword.

As Zhou Wen moved his palm, the fragments scattered from the Three-Lives Stone as sword marks appeared. Soon, Zhou Wen’s name was engraved.

The strokes of the two words were like a sword’s edge. Every stroke was filled with terrifying sword intent. Just looking at the two words made Lu Bushun and company feel a chill run down their spines as they subconsciously took half a step back.

What a terrifying sword intent! After snapping to their senses, everyone realized that it was only the sword intent contained in the words.

Zhou Wen’s name was forcefully engraved on the Three-Lives Stone. It didn’t vanish like An Sheng and Ya’er’s names. It was unknown if engraving a name in such a way was effective.

“Ah Sheng, I’ll cross the bridge with you.” Zhou Wen retracted the Terror form Sword Pill and secretly glanced at the information on his phone.

Terror transformation: Incomplete Sword Pill (S-grade)

Although there was something wrong with the name, it was within his expectations. After all, this Terror form Sword Pill was based on the Immortal Culling Sword, not his own Sword Heart.

If it wasn’t because he didn’t have the luxury of time, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have chosen this path. It was safer to advance to the Terror transformation stage with a Sword Heart he could call his own.

“Overseer, why don’t Young Master Wen and I head over to take a look?” An Sheng requested An Tianzuo’s permission again.

“Does engraving a name like that count?” An Tianzuo didn’t answer An Sheng as he asked the white-haired granny.

“Just leaving a name would do,” the white-haired granny said calmly.

An Tianzuo turned around and walked towards the Three-Lives Stone. As he walked towards it, a strange figure appeared behind him. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It was a white humanoid armored creature. He floated behind An Tianzuo with a device similar to a rocket launcher behind him. He held a sword in one hand and a Gatling-like weapon in the other. He looked like a modern robot.
