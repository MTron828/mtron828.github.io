Chapter 800: Grabbing a Silkworm With One Hand

Translator: CKtalon

“I need this Ice Silkworm Gu King to exchange for your freedom,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at the Ice Silkworm on the ground.

Gu Lady nodded before tapping the Ice Silkworm. The ferocious and domineering Ice Silkworm obediently crawled towards Zhou Wen and stopped by his feet, but it had no intention of attacking him.

From the looks of it, the Xiao family has really underestimated Gu Lady’s strength. If they knew that Gu Lady could easily make a top-notch Gu like the Ice Silkworm obey her orders, I wonder what expression they would have.

Zhou Wen took out the Essence Gold Pot that Worm Dugu had prepared and placed it on the ground. The Ice Silkworm jumped in like a tamed pet.

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he looked at Gu Lady and asked, “Can you secretly control the other Ice Silkworm Gu and make it look like I’ve captured it?”

Gu Lady nodded again. It looked like she could do it.

“Then control the Ice Silkworm Gu later and let it pretend I’ve caught it.” Zhou Wen recounted his plan to Gu Lady. After confirming that she could understand, Zhou Wen took the Ice Gu in the Essence Gold Pot and sneaked back to Li Xuan and company.

...

“Oh no, Gu Lady failed. Someone stole the Ice Silkworm.” Xiao Tianfang’s expression suddenly changed.

“How is that possible? Who can snatch the Ice Silkworm away from Gu Lady without anyone noticing?” Xiao Liuqi jumped in fright as he said in disbelief.

“I don’t know. The Gu we planted didn’t react at all, and Gu Lady didn’t find any traces of him.” Xiao Tianfang’s expression was ugly as he continued, “I’ve already summoned Gu Lady back. Now, we can only use all our strength to capture this Ice Silkworm.”

Just as Xiao Tianfang said that, he saw Zhou Wen return to Worm Dugu’s side. He exchanged a few words with Worm Dugu before walking towards the Ice Silkworm.

“Could he have snatched the other Ice Silkworm?” Xiao Tianfang’s heart skipped a beat.

Xiao Liuqi had already led his men to block Zhou Wen, preventing him from approaching the battlefield. At the same time, he shouted at Worm Dugu, “Old Master Dugu, we are capturing this Ice Silkworm. Isn’t it inappropriate for you to interfere?”

Worm Dugu said with a smile, “I’m still here! I didn’t even move. When did I interfere with your matters?”

“The Dugu family has always been open and aboveboard. Old Master Dugu, are you trying to say that this friend isn’t a member of the Dugu family?” Xiao Liuqi pointed at Zhou Wen.

“I really wish he was a member of our Dugu family, but unfortunately, he’s not.” Worm Dugu didn’t wait for Xiao Liuqi to say anything before continuing, “But you can’t say that he has nothing to do with our Dugu family. Although he’s not a member of our Dugu family, he’s my uncle-master.”

Xiao Liuqi, Xiao Tianfang, and company were alarmed. Although Worm Dugu wasn’t an authoritative figure in the Dugu family, his seniority was rather high. Furthermore, he was very famous for raising Gu. He was a famous master in the South District.

Yet, Worm Dugu said that the youth in front of them was his uncle-master. It was somewhat unbelievable, but a figure like Worm Dugu clearly wouldn’t joke about such matters.

Could it be that this person has already cultivated to the point of returning to his youth? He looks young, but he’s actually an old monster? Xiao Tianfang thought to himself.

“Since he’s your Uncle-Master, do you think it’s appropriate for him to do something like this?” Xiao Liuqi said.

Worm Dugu continued smiling as he said, “It’s useless saying that to me. Only uncle-masters discipline their disciples. When have you seen a disciple manage an uncle-master?”

“Sir...” Xiao Liuqi looked at Zhou Wen and was about to say something when he suddenly saw Zhou Wen extend his hand and grab. A blood-red vortex appeared in his palm and sucked in the Ice Silkworm that was fighting the Blood Scorpion.

The majestic Ice Silkworm couldn’t withstand the suction force of the blood-colored vortex and was sucked into the Essence Gold Pot.

“How is that possible?” It wasn’t just the Xiao family. Even Worm Dugu widened his eyes as though he had seen a ghost.

Although he had thought that it was very likely that Zhou Wen would subdue the Ice Silkworm, he never expected him to use such a method.

Worm Dugu originally imagined that Zhou Wen would use the chick’s restraining effect before using various means and Mythical Companion Beasts to fight the Ice Silkworm to finally subdue it.

However, to his surprise, Zhou Wen extended his hand and sucked the Ice Silkworm into the Essence Gold Pot as though he wasn’t taking in a Gu King but an ordinary worm.

The Xiao family members’ eyes nearly popped out. They had fought the Ice Silkworm for so long, so they naturally knew how terrifying it was.

Up to now, they had lost hundreds of Gu and Kuman Thong, but they were still helpless against the Ice Silkworm. Even the Mythical Blood Scorpion Gu had been about to be killed.

Yet, Zhou Wen had managed to capture the Ice Silkworm with one hand. How terrifying was this power? It was unbelievable.

As expected of Worm Dugu’s uncle-master. He’s indeed an old monster. Xiao Tianfang was secretly alarmed as his expression turned extremely ugly.

After spending so much effort and paying such a huge price, the Ice Silkworm was actually caught by someone else. Xiao Tianfang didn’t even need to guess to know that the other Ice Silkworm had definitely been taken by Worm Dugu’s uncle-master.

He wanted to snatch it, but Worm Dugu was already someone he didn’t have the guts to attack. Furthermore, the person in front of him was Worm Dugu’s uncle-master, an existence who had subdued the Ice Silkworm with one hand.

Only then did Xiao Tianfang feel a sinister aura return and enter the Kuman Nee in his hand.

“You came back too late.” Xiao Tianfang was somewhat exasperated.

“The Kuman Nee in your hand is rather interesting,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at the Kuman Nee in Xiao Tianfang’s hands.

The expressions of the Xiao family members changed. If an existence that could capture an Ice Silkworm with one hand wanted to snatch their Kuman Nee, they probably wouldn’t have a chance to resist.

Even a Mythical Kuman Nee wouldn’t be able to fight against such an existence.

“Old Master Dugu, the Dugu family is the head of the South District. You aren’t going to watch your uncle-master snatch our Kuman Nee, right?” Xiao Liuqi was nervous as he looked at Worm Dugu and said through gritted teeth.

Before Worm Dugu could say a word, Zhou Wen said, “Who said I wanted to snatch something of yours? An old man like me just finds it a little special and asked casually. Even if I really wanted it, I wouldn’t snatch something from juniors like you. At most, I’ll buy your Kuman Nee. Why do I have to snatch it?”

“This Kuman Nee is our Xiao family’s heirloom. It’s not for sale,” Xiao Liuqi said. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Aren’t you willing to sell it if I use the Ice Silkworm as an exchange?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“You want to exchange the Ice Silkworm for the Kuman Nee?” Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi were stunned.

“Why? Isn’t the Ice Silkworm enough? What about the two Ice Silkworms?” Zhou Wen continued.

“Old sir, are you really going to exchange two Ice Silkworms for a Kuman Nee?” Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi looked at each other and saw the pleasant surprise in each other’s eyes.

In their opinion, Kuman Nee was indeed very strong, but she was only slightly stronger than an Ice Silkworm. The two Ice Silkworms were much more pragmatic than the Gu Lady Kuman Nee.

Furthermore, Gu Lady Kuman Nee would bite her master. Xiao Tianfang would even consider exchanging her away for a single Ice Silkworm, much less two.

“Uncle-Master, you can’t do that.” Worm Dugu was shocked. Using two Ice Silkworms to exchange for Kuman Nee was a losing transaction.

However, what they didn’t know was that the two Ice Silkworms were far inferior to Gu Lady. They weren’t on the same level at all. Even if the exchange was really made, Zhou Wen would have the upper hand. Furthermore, he had no intention of really giving the Ice Silkworms to the Xiao family.
