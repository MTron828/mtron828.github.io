Chapter 767: Silver-Winged Yaksha

“Silver-Winged Yaksha! Why is there a Silver-Winged Yaksha on the Great Wall!?” Wang Chan cried out in horror.

Zhou Wen frowned as he stared at the creature that came out of the pot. He saw that it was an evil ghost with wings on its back. Its entire body seemed to be forged from silver, but its blood-red eyes shimmered. It looked extremely sinister and bizarre.

He was certain that it was a dimensional creature and not a Companion Beast.

Zhou Wen had actually heard of Silver-Winged Yakshas. Not long after the dimensional storms, a few Silver-Winged Yakshas had appeared in some coastal cities.

As Silver-Winged Yakshas were extremely bloodthirsty, they would bring a terrifying calamity to humanity every time they appeared. Some places suffered massacres.

However, in the past twenty to thirty years, Silver-Winged Yakshas rarely appeared. It was even more so in a place like the Imperial Capital.

Zhou Wen had only heard that Silver-Winged Yakshas were terrifying. It was possible that it was a Mythical creature, but he had never seen one before.

“Brother-in-law, run!” Wang Chan pulled Zhou Wen and ran. She knew very well how terrifying Silver-Winged Yakshas were.

This was because the Wang family had a video of the Silver-Winged Yaksha’s massacre of a small city. Not only was the Silver-Winged Yaksha a Mythical creature, but it was also extremely fast. Its physique and strength were equally terrifying. Typically, humans wouldn’t even be able to see it before they were beheaded.

Now, Wang Chan regretted bringing Zhou Wen into the dimensional zone. If they had not come here, they wouldn’t have encountered such trouble.

“I’ve already said that you shouldn’t have come out with others. Only I can stop you from being embroiled by bad luck,” said Xiao Si.

At that moment, Xiao Si was feeling very pleased with himself. The Silver-Winged Yaksha naturally didn’t appear here for no reason. Although it wasn’t a Companion Beast but a genuine dimensional creature, this didn’t mean that no one could control it.

In fact, the person who released the Silver-Winged Yaksha was Xiao Si himself. However, the Silver-Winged Yaksha wasn’t his pet. He couldn’t command the Silver-Winged Yaksha, so the reason for its appearance was the two-handled pot.

The pot itself was a magical item. It had the title of Devil’s Pot in the South District. It was a treasure that was obtained from a mysterious dimensional zone in the South District before it ended up in the Xiao family’s hands.

There were no true devils in the Devil’s Pot, but they could seal certain types of dimensional creatures inside.

The Xiao family had paid a considerable price to find a Silver-Winged Yaksha and place it inside the Devil’s Pot.

Although they couldn’t control the Silver-Winged Yaksha, they could selectively release or seal it.

In other words, after Xiao Si controlled the Devil’s Pot, he had the ability to release or retrieve the Silver-Winged Yaksha.

Silver-Winged Yakshas were extremely bloodthirsty. They would engage in wanton slaughter the moment they were released. Their only weakness was that they didn’t distinguish between friend and foe. Typically, they would only choose humans and souls as their targets.

Although the Devil’s Pot wasn’t of much help in cracking dimensional zones, it was a great weapon when used against humans.

Although Xiao Si told Wang Chan that he could control his Life Providence, it was actually impossible. Therefore, as long as he was by her side, Wang Chan’s Goddess of Misfortune Life Providence wouldn’t have much effect.

Xiao Si had no intention of letting Wang Chan’s Life Providence take effect. He didn’t like uncertain factors and wanted everything to be under his control.

Roar! After the Silver-Winged Yaksha came out of the Devil’s Pot, it let out a shocking roar. Silver light erupted from its body as a terrifying shockwave blasted out hundreds of meters away, causing Wang Chan and Xiao Si to fall to the ground.

In the next second, the Silver-Winged Yaksha spread its wings and instantly traversed a distance of hundreds of meters. It appeared in front of Zhou Wen who was still standing there. Its aura was extremely violent, like a devil from hell.

“No...” Wang Chan was extremely regretful. She regretted bringing Zhou Wen out. She regretted having the extravagant hopes of making friends at school like an ordinary girl.

Xiao Si pretended to fall to the ground, but his eyes were filled with killing intent. No one knows that the Devil’s Pot and the Silver-Winged Yaksha belong to our Xiao family. No matter who this fellow is, no one will be able to pin the blame on me if he’s killed by the Silver-Winged Yaksha. Without him, everything will return to normal... Wang Chan will eventually join my Xiao family...

As the two of them had different thoughts, they suddenly saw Zhou Wen draw the saber at his waist and slash at the Silver-Winged Yaksha.

Xiao Si sneered inwardly. A terrifying existence like the Silver-Winged Yaksha has devoured so many Undying Battle Souls. How can a human’s saber match it...

“Brother-in-law, I’m sorry...” Wang Chan shouted loudly. Her heart was filled with regret and frustration. Tears fell from the corners of her eyes as she thought sadly, I shouldn’t have had such extravagant hopes...

However, in the next second, Xiao Si and Wang Chan widened their eyes in shock.

The Silver-Winged Yaksha was split into two by the Bamboo Blade as it slammed to the ground.

“No... Impossible...” Xiao Si’s mouth gaped open as he looked at Zhou Wen and the Silver-Winged Yasha’s corpse at his feet in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that the Mythical Silver-Winged Yaksha had died just like that.

Wang Chan was also stunned. Her face was still covered in tears, but her expression had turned extremely odd. She hadn’t completely restrained her sorrowful expression, yet it was mixed with a flabbergasted look.

“What did you say?” Zhou Wen picked up a silver egg-shaped object from the Silver-Winged Yaksha’s corpse and turned to ask Wang Chan.

“N-nothing... Brother-in-law... You’re amazing... Is this the Silver-Winged Yaksha’s Companion Egg?” Wang Chan’s forlorn look turned into a smile as she jumped up from the ground and tugged at Zhou Wen with a look of joy.

“I guess so. However, such a weak dimensional creature is probably very weak as a Companion Beast. It’s useless. If you like it, you can have it.” Zhou Wen casually threw the Silver-Winged Yaksha Companion Egg towards Wang Chan.

The corners of Xiao Si’s eyes twitched. He wished he could slap Zhou Wen twice.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

That was the Silver-Winged Yaksha. The Xiao family had sealed the Silver-Winged Yaksha for so long, but they had failed to come up with a way to kill it. They never expected such good luck to have the Silver-Winged Yaksha drop a Companion Egg after its death.

Ignoring the fact that Zhou Wen had killed the Silver-Winged Yaksha and had a Companion Egg drop, he even complained that the Silver-Winged Yaksha was too weak. This left Xiao Si gnashing his teeth in anger.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care about Xiao Si’s expression. His figure phased away and vanished.

Not good! Xiao Si was alarmed. He had already guessed where Zhou Wen had gone.

Although the Silver-Winged Yaksha was difficult to seal, there was still a chance of sealing another in the future. It didn’t matter if it died, but if Zhou Wen took away the Devil’s Pot, everything would be over.

Xiao Si hurriedly ordered his Life Soul to retrieve the Devil’s Pot. He was still very confident in his Life Soul. After all, he had used his Life Soul to silently place the Devil’s Pot on the beacon tower.
