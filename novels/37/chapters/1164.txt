Chapter 1165: Myriad Elephant Valley

Earth had undergone serious dimensionalization. Even a Mythical expert wouldn’t be able to travel from the East District to the South District as easily as they had done five years ago. Even if everything went smoothly, it would probably take more than half a month to make the trip.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen was proficient in spatial teleportation and had a spatial Calamity-grade expert, Tsukuyomi, by his side.

Zhou Wen’s spatial teleportation ability wasn’t enough to provide him with precise positioning from great distances, much less teleporting with Ya’er and company.

However, for the Calamity-grade Tsukuyomi, teleporting them to the Dugu family in the South District was just a matter of waving her hand.

As he didn’t know where Li Xuan was, Zhou Wen had no choice but to make a trip to the Dugu family residence to find Worm Dugu and ask him where he was.

The Dugu family was known as the most cowardly family. Even their old residence was built directly in a dimensional zone. The large-scale break-out of dimensional creatures didn’t affect the Dugu family much.

The dimensional zone where the Dugu family’s old residence was was called Myriad Elephant Valley. There were no elephants there, but the valley was strange. Without the guidance of the Dugu family, even a Mythical expert might not be able to walk out and for the rest of his life would be trapped in Myriad Elephant Valley.

At that moment, a man and a woman were standing outside the Myriad Elephant Valley with a little girl, a golden eagle, and a white antelope. They were sizing up the stone monument outside Myriad Elephant Valley.

This entourage was naturally Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi. The chick and antelope also followed. Zhou Wen wanted them to stay with the An family, but they refused.

Outside Myriad Elephant Valley stood a stone monument. On the left of the stone monument were the words: “Calling to the heavens and earth, none heed my call.” On the right were the words “A life of solitude.”

Zhou Wen looked at it for a long time and found it odd. It wasn’t a couplet, nor was it a poem. It looked odd no matter how he looked at it.

If it’s a life of solitude, it might be a name chosen because of superstition, but, when written in Chinese characters, the word “solitude” is written in opposite order from the Dugu family’s surname. It shouldn’t be a human name. Zhou Wen looked outside Myriad Elephant Valley for quite some time, but he didn’t see anyone from the Dugu family.

However, Zhou Wen’s eyes and ears were extremely sharp. He had long discovered that there were many strange creatures lurking around. There were Gu that resembled grains of sand and dimensional creatures that resembled grass.

The seemingly calm entrance to Myriad Elephant Valley was actually filled with killing intent. However, the strange creatures didn’t attack solely because they hadn’t received their master’s orders.

“I’m Zhou Wen, a friend of Worm Dugu. I’m here to visit,” Zhou Wen shouted at the valley.

“You are Zhou Wen from Luoyang’s An family?” A voice sounded from the valley, but no one could be seen.

“I’m from Luoyang, but my surname isn’t An. My name is Zhou Wen,” Zhou Wen said.

“Why do you want to see our Second Master?” That voice sounded again.

“I have something to ask him.” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback when he heard the title Second Master. Then, he recalled that Worm Dugu was ranked second in his generation. Dugu Ge called him Second Uncle. Presumably, this Second Master was what juniors called him.

“What is it?” the voice asked again.

“I can only say it when I see Worm Dugu,” Zhou Wen said with a frown.

“Second Master isn’t home. Go back,” the person in the valley said again.

“Where did he go?” Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed when he heard that. If Worm Dugu wasn’t around, it would be even harder to find Li Xuan. He couldn’t wait that long.

“I don’t know,” the voice in the valley said.

Since I can’t find Li Xuan, I can only try to receive Netherworld City’s punishment myself. Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. He had tried Netherworld City’s punishment. If he didn’t use Great Brahma to cheat, Zhou Wen wasn’t confident that he could survive all the punishments.

However, if he used Great Brahma to cheat, he wouldn’t be able to open the true entrance to the Netherworld. Therefore, it was best if he could find Li Xuan. If he couldn’t, Zhou Wen could only give it a try himself.

Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly heard a bang. Turning his head, he saw a man covered in blood rush out of Myriad Elephant Valley and fall to the ground.

“Save me. I know where Second Master is.” The man seemed to use his last ounce of strength as he shouted at Zhou Wen before fainting.

Zhou Wen immediately saw that the person’s injuries weren’t trivial. They weren’t as simple as losing consciousness. He was about to die.

In his body, he could see many Gu drilling around. His heart and other organs were riddled with holes. It was already a miracle that he was still alive.

Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on crossing the Dugu family, but something was amiss about this whole thing. Furthermore, the person said that he knew of Worm Dugu’s whereabouts.

Just as Zhou Wen was watching, swarms of worms suddenly flew out of Myriad Elephant Valley like black fog and swept towards the unconscious man.

Zhou Wen summoned the Bronze Sparrow Sword and made it fly over. Wherever the flames passed, large swaths of worms were immediately burned to death.

“This is a family matter for our Dugu family. I believe it has nothing to do with you?” the voice in the valley sounded again.

“Your Dugu family’s matters are indeed unrelated to me, but he knows Worm Dugu’s whereabouts. After he wakes up and tells me Worm Dugu’s whereabouts, I’ll hand him over to you,” Zhou Wen said as he walked towards the unconscious man.

The man’s condition was terrible. His body was almost shutting down from the Gu’s bites. The only difference from a dead person was his breathing. He needed immediate treatment.

“He doesn’t know Second Master’s whereabouts. He just wants to use you to escape,” the voice in the valley said.

“We’ll know if it’s true after asking.” Zhou Wen stood in front of the man and began carving the Ancient Sovereign Sutra on the Wheel of Destiny.

In his present situation, ordinary healing abilities were useless. Even if he used the Rejuvenation Pill, he could only heal some wounds. However, the Gu in his body were still there. It was useless just to heal his wounds.

Only the Ancient Sovereign Sutra could heal this man under such circumstances and extract all the Gu in his body.

“It’s not up to you to decide on the Dugu family’s matters.” Just as Zhou Wen was about to help the man, he saw another person rush out of Myriad Elephant Valley.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and saw that the person’s face was covered in a black veil. His entire body was wrapped up, making it impossible to see his appearance. All he knew was that it was a man.

“Zhou Wen, I’ve heard of your name. You are indeed an impressive person. However, this is a family matter of my Dugu family. If you insist on interfering, even if our Dugu family is unwilling, we can only treat you as an enemy and dispose of you with all our might.” At the moment the black-robed man appeared, a large number of Gu flew out with him. It was unknown how many of them there were. Furthermore, there were many types, not just one. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“If you trust our Dugu family, I can use the Dugu family’s reputation to guarantee that this traitor doesn’t know the whereabouts of Worm Dugu. He only wants to use you,” the black-robed man said again.

Zhou Wen felt that the black-robed man’s words made sense, but he didn’t plan on returning the person. He had to personally interrogate him.
