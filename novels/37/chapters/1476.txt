Chapter 1477 Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens

Although Zhou Wen knew that the birth of every Calamity-grade creature would be accompanied by the descent of a Calamity, he never expected that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s advancement to the Calamity grade would destroy the Sovereign Sui Tomb dimensional zone.

At the instant the Ancient Sovereign Sutra advanced to the Calamity grade, Human Sovereign automatically fused with Zhou Wen, causing his entire body to emit light and heat. It was like a spring sun that brought warmth to the world, but it wasn’t too hot.

Under the illumination from Zhou Wen’s body, tender sprouts crawled out of the ashes of Sovereign Sui’s Tomb that had already turned into a charred ruin.

In just moments, the sprouts grew into different plants. There were weeds that were more than a meter tall and saplings that constantly grew until they soon reached into the sky, blooming with flowers.

The cemetery that had turned into scorched earth now looked like a flora paradise in a short amount of time.

Yu Qiubai stood outside, staring blankly at the oasis-like existence in front of him. The vegetation inside grew lusher and luxuriant. It was unimaginable that a moment ago, it was still scorched earth.

“Zhou Wen… Are you okay…” Finding it all bizarre, Yu Qiubai worried for Zhou Wen. Yu Qiubai had heard some stories in the past. For example, the death of a whale would give many lifeforms in the sea a chance of survival.

There were also similar records in many myths. For example, after Pangu split the heavens and earth, he transformed into all things. Only when a powerhouse died would all things obtain the chance to grow.

Now that everything was growing here, Yu Qiubai was truly afraid that something untoward had happened to Zhou Wen. He rushed into the forest worriedly as he searched for him, constantly calling out his name.

Yu Qiubai squeezed through the grass and trees, traversing a few hundred meters before finally arriving at a circular clearing.

Zhou Wen stood there, emitting a sun-like brilliance. He looked almost inhuman.

“Zhou Wen… Zhou Wen…” Yu Qiubai called out a few times, but when he didn’t receive a response from Zhou Wen, he suddenly felt something amiss.

He was advanced in age. Although he couldn’t be considered ailing, he wasn’t young anymore.

Coupled with the previous battles and recent work, it was normal for him to feel exhausted.

But now, he felt as though his entire body was filled with energy. It was similar to when he woke up in his prime. It was as though he had infinite energy. Even the pain and side effects from the previous battle had unknowingly vanished. It was as though he had healed himself.

Just as Yu Qiubai was feeling alarmed, he saw the light in front of him dim. Zhou Wen had already returned to his original appearance and was looking at him.

“Sir, why are you here?” Zhou Wen was first alarmed when he saw that it was Yu Qiubai. Only when he saw that Yu Qiubai was fine did he relax.

The Ancient Sovereign Sutra had just advanced to the Calamity grade and formed a domain. He didn’t know if the Calamity Zone would harm humans, so he was given a fright when he saw Yu Qiubai.

“I came to look for you to discuss if we can send a group of people into Sovereign Sui’s Tomb. From the looks of it, there’s no need for any discussion.” Yu Qiubai asked with a bitter smile, “What’s going on?”

“It’s a long story. In short, there’s no way to build a human city here. We have to find another place as soon as possible. Teacher Yu, do you have any other suggestions?” Zhou Wen said with a bitter smile.

He didn’t know that things would turn out this way. With Sovereign Sui’s Tomb destroyed, he could only find another place.

However, for the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to condense a Calamity Zone, such a price was worth it.

The only thing that displeased Zhou Wen was that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s Calamity Zone was still a domain similar to strengthening and healing. It still didn’t seem to have any offensive properties.

Of course, Zhou Wen had just condensed the Calamity Zone and had yet to completely figure it out. He still needed time to familiarize himself with it.

He took out his phone and took a look. He realized that when he switched to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, there was indeed an additional Calamity Zone row.

Zone: Human Sovereign Sacrifices to the Heavens (Human Realm)

Why does the name of this domain give off an ominous feeling… I have a nickname, Human Sovereign… If Human Sovereign sacrifices to the heavens… Doesn’t that mean I’ll be sacrificed to the heavens… Zhou Wen felt a little awkward when he saw the name of the domain.

The name was given by the game system, so Zhou Wen couldn’t change it even if he wanted to. All he could do was silently accept it. “There are indeed quite a number of dimensional zones near Guide City, but there are many that are very strange. They aren’t suitable for human habitation…” After some thought, Yu Qiubai couldn’t think of a suitable place. “Let’s talk when we’re back.” Zhou Wen was a local, so he naturally knew that Yu Qiubai was right. The dimensional zones near Guide City were indeed very strange.

He didn’t dare enter Ancient City. He hadn’t been able to enter Sovereign Sui’s Tomb in the past. There were many Essence Crystal ores in Butterfly Valley, but according to the information Zhou Wen knew, Butterfly Valley had a time limit.

It was fine to enter Butterfly Valley at certain times, but there were certain periods when one couldn’t come out. The people who entered would never be found again. There were also some dimensional zones that had their own uniqueness. In short, there weren’t many dimensional zones that were suitable for human habitation.

“Under the present circumstances, we have to find a dimensional zone as soon as possible and give everyone a place to stay. With so many people crowding around the school, it’s only a matter of time before something bad happens… If there’s really no other way… We can only give that place a try…” Yu Qiubai said after some thought.

“Where?” Zhou Wen could tell from Yu Qiubai’s words that there was a dimensional zone suitable for humans.

Yu Qiubai appeared to be in a dilemma, but he also knew that he had to think of a solution. Therefore, even if he was somewhat apprehensive, he still said, “In the dimensional zones I previously investigated, there’s one that might be able to accommodate a large number of humans. However, there’s a problem with that dimensional zone.”

“What’s the problem?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

Since Yu Qiubai had suggested the dimensional zone, it meant that it wasn’t completely unsolvable.

Yu Qiubai said, “I’ve previously been to Taiqing Palace and Laojun Platform. Although Taiqing Palace is huge, too many strange things happen inside. It’s not suitable for humans to gather there en masse. On the other hand, Laojun Platform’s dimensional zones are more suitable for humans, but there’s something strange about it…”

The Laojun Platform that Yu Qiubai mentioned was also known as the Immortal Ascension Platform. Legend had it that it was the place where Taishang Laojun ascended to immortality. After the dimensional storms, it also became a dimensional zone. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Laojun Platform wasn’t just an ancient myth. In recent times, there were also some magical legends.

Legend had it that when the Japanese army attacked Luyi County City, which was also the county city where Mount Laojun was located, the county city was filled with short, dilapidated buildings with no tall buildings in sight, the most obvious building in the distance was Laojun Platform.

Before the attack, the Japanese soldiers had first bombarded the county city with artillery. Furthermore, they had targeted the most outstanding spot, Laojun Platform. In the end, after thirteen consecutive blasts, they only heard the sound of shells being fired, but not the sound of explosions.

The Japanese army rushed into the city only to find that the commoners in the city had safely retreated. There was no one in the city. When the Japanese army arrived in front of Laojun Platform, they realized that their target had been Taishang Laojun’s Immortal Ascension Platform.
