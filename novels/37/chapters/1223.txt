Chapter 1224: Son of Heaven’s Three Swords

Zhou Wen immediately used spatial teleportation to leave the dungeon, but it didn’t work this time. The blood-colored avatar failed to teleport out.

Bam!

In the next second, the blood-colored avatar’s head exploded before the gunshot rang. The game screen went black again.

In that case, it means that any creature that enters by normal means can only fight to the death. They won’t have a chance to come out until the end.

Zhou Wen frowned in thought. If that’s the case, I can’t get my allies to enter. I can only wait for others to enter and pick up the spoils after them.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up. That’s right. I can definitely enter to pick up the spoils. After all, those fellows won’t survive after entering and won’t be able to take anything out. It would be a waste if I don’t take the spoils.

With this in mind, Zhou Wen looked forward to someone quickly entering the Venusian dimensional zone.

However, after a day and a half, no creature challenged the Venusian dimensional zone.

This was also normal. Be it contracting a Guardian or using Mythical Serum, there were very few Terror-grade humans. The death of one in the League of Guardians was probably enough to deeply upset them. Before figuring out the situation, no one would send someone in rashly.

Seeing the lack of opportunity, Zhou Wen could only continue grinding at home. As long as he ensured that the League of Guardians didn’t clear the Venusian dungeon first and that the dimension couldn’t obtain anything, he was in no rush.

‘Progress: 100%. Synthesis complete.’

Just as Zhou Wen was grinding, a message suddenly popped up. Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that the fusion synthesis of Light Concealment, Shadow Concealment, and Night Immaculate had completed.

Let me see what the outcome of the fusion is. Zhou Wen opened the fusion window and saw an ancient sword floating there.

It wasn’t the formless Light Concealment Sword, nor was it the shadow of the Shadow Concealment Sword, nor was it the aura of the Night Immaculate Sword. It was an ordinary sheathed ancient sword.

Zhou Wen checked the ancient sword’s stats and saw the words “Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.”

Strange, I’ve clearly fused a sword. Why is it called the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords? Zhou Wen was puzzled as he looked at the detailed stats of the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.

Son of Heaven’s Three Swords: Terror-grade (Evolvable)

Life Providence: Sword of the Son of Heaven

Life Soul: Dao Sword

Wheel of Destiny: Sword of Unkilling

Terror Form: Son of Heaven

Strength: 99

Speed: 99

Constitution: 99

Essence Energy: 99

Talent Skill: None

Companion Form: Sword of the Son of Heaven

What the hell are these attributes? Sword of Unkilling? Could it be that this sword can’t kill? It’s a Terror-grade Companion Beast after all. It doesn’t even have a single skill. Isn’t this too extreme... Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. The only thing that left him gratified was that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords had an evolutionary attribute.

This meant that the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords might reach the Calamity grade in the future.

Furthermore, the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords’ stats were rather impressive. All four stats were 99. This was the highest stats among Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts.

Summoning the Son of Heaven’s Sword, Zhou Wen held the hilt and wanted to pull it out to take a look. However, after a few attempts, the sword remained motionless as though it was stuck from all the rust.

It can’t be... I can’t pull this thing out? It really lives up to its Sword of Unkilling name... Zhou Wen fiddled with it for a while, hoping to figure it out.

However, he tragically realized that no matter what strength he used, he couldn’t pull the sword out. Furthermore, the sword didn’t have any special strength. It was no different from a hard rod.

When it appeared in its own form, it was like a dead object. It didn’t even move, much less fly up to fight.

Are you kidding me?

Zhou Wen was depressed. It was difficult to imagine that this was a Terror-grade Companion Beast.

Unable to figure it out, Zhou Wen had no choice but to put away the Son of Heaven’s Sword. He would slowly study it in the future.

Zhou Wen also knew that there was definitely something special about the sword, but he was momentarily stumped.

In the next few days, Zhou Wen didn’t see any creatures enter the Venusian instance dungeon. He stayed home to grind.

Ding! When Zhou Wen grinded the underground sea again, a crisp sound of a drop sounded, causing his body to tremble.

When he focused his gaze, he realized that it was a Demon Blood True Dragon Companion Egg.

It’s finally here! Zhou Wen’s hands trembled in excitement. After grinding for so long, he had finally obtained the nine Demon Blood True Dragon Companion Eggs.

He picked up the Companion Egg and saw that it was indeed the Wu Dragon’s Companion Egg. Zhou Wen hurriedly hatched it.

The Wu Dragon Companion Egg’s stats were about the same as the others. It wasn’t too special, so Zhou Wen didn’t expect it to be very powerful. What he wanted to know the most was whether he could fuse the nine Demon Blood True Dragons together.

He first placed the Wu Dragon in the window. The game immediately indicated that it could be fused. Zhou Wen attempted to put the remaining eight dragons on it, and it really worked. There was no indication that it lacked a core.

When Zhou Wen pressed the Fusion button, the intense light devoured the nine Demon Blood True Dragons and flooded the entire phone screen.

When the light dissipated, a black crystal-like Companion Egg appeared in the Fusion window. There was also a percentage progress bar below.

From the looks of it, I’ll have to wait another two days. Zhou Wen really wanted to know what the outcome of the fusion was, but all he could do was wait.

Now, he only hoped that there wouldn’t be a strange Companion Egg like the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords.

It just so happens that I don’t have any particularly good armor. I hope they fuse into some good Terror-grade armor. Zhou Wen’s body was only at the Mythical stage after all. He was somewhat inferior to a true Terror-grade. For instance, Demonic Neonate seldom participated in head-on battles because of her weak body.

If he had Terror-grade armor, it would greatly enhance Zhou Wen’s strength. At the very least, his life-preservation abilities would be elevated.

With another wish fulfilled, what depressed Zhou Wen the most was his failure to obtain the last of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions’ skills.

The main reason was that the Endless Sea of Stars was just too huge. It took a lot of time just to grind it once, so Zhou Wen could only rely on luck.

A message made Zhou Wen, who had been enjoying his days, shiver involuntarily. The message was from The Thearch, who had been silent for a long time.

“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen replied, but he felt extremely worried. Every time The Thearch came to him, nothing good would happen.

Even with his Terror-grade strength, Zhou Wen didn’t dare rashly head to Chess Mountain.

The stronger he was, the more he could understand how terrifying The Thearch was. After obtaining powerful strength, Zhou Wen knew how terrifying the power of wishes was.

“I want to make a deal with you.” The Thearch quickly sent another message.
