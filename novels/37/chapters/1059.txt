Chapter 1060: Two Illogical Points

Translator: CKtalon

The golden toad’s tongue was severed by the ax. Blood immediately spewed out from its mouth as it let out a shrill cry.

And at the spot where its tongue was severed, flames burned. When the blood spewed into the air, it also burned like fireworks.

How powerful! Zhou Wen was alarmed.

Even Ice Maiden didn’t dare underestimate the strength of the golden toad, but Wei Ge had chopped off its tongue with an ax. This was just too terrifying.

Wait... Axe... Lunar Osmanthus Tree... Could the one possessing Wei Ge be the legendary logger? Zhou Wen looked at Wei Ge in surprise.

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible. In myths and legends, the logger was a human. As he had committed a huge mistake during his immortal cultivation, he had been punished by the furious Celestial Thearch. He was only allowed to leave after he had chopped down the osmanthus tree on the moon.

However, the osmanthus tree on the moon wasn’t an ordinary tree species. Instead, it was a type of undying tree. When the ax was pulled back after a chop, the wound on the tree automatically healed.

Therefore, the logger ended up logging on the Moon forever, never to leave the Moon again.

This was only one of the versions of the punished logger legend. Zhou Wen originally didn’t believe it, but now that such a person had appeared, it was difficult not to connect them together.

However, according to legend, it’s impossible for the osmanthus tree to be chopped down. Why is there only a tree stump now? How did the logger die? Zhou Wen was puzzled.

While Zhou Wen was still pondering, the injured golden toad retreated into the Moon Palace. The possessed Wei Ge also walked in.

“If you want to leave, this is the best opportunity,” Ice Maiden informed them.

“Director-General Shen, are you returning to the spacecraft?” Zhou Wen asked Shen Yuchi.

Shen Yuchi pondered and said, “Little Wei made such a huge sacrifice. Since he can still be saved, we can’t abandon him. We have to think of a way.”

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He never expected Shen Yuchi to say such a thing.

“In that case, are you going in to save him?” Zhou Wen stared at Shen Yuchi and asked.

“I can only say that I’m going in to take a look. If there’s a chance, I’ll save him. If there’s no chance, I won’t throw my life away. I’ll just do my best. You and Wei Ge are also schoolmates. You won’t abandon him, right?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“We were only from the same school and not from the same class. We didn’t have much interaction and don’t have any ties. Save him yourself. I’m not in the mood to take the risk,” Zhou Wen said.

Shen Yuchi was slightly taken aback, but he didn’t say anything else. He led Wang Qiuyuan into the Moon Palace.

After they entered, Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the tiny palm symbol behind the words “Moon Palace.”

With a click, the phone screen showed the download interface.

I wonder if Chang’e is really in the Moon Palace. It should be very interesting when the Chang’e Companion Beast drops, right? Zhou Wen saw that his phone was constantly on the downloading screen. It didn’t seem like it could be downloaded in a short period of time.

Should I enter? Zhou Wen looked at the door of Moon Palace. The cold air inside was like fog, preventing him from seeing anything. Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t penetrate it either.

“If I were you, I wouldn’t choose to enter,” Ice Maiden suddenly said.

“Why?” Zhou Wen looked at Ice Maiden.

Ice Maiden said, “The existence that possessed your classmate is too powerful. The golden toad’s strength isn’t weaker than the present me, but he can heavily injure it with a mere strike. With such strength, even Grim Demon might not be able to emerge victorious if he were to fight. It’s best you consider it carefully.”

After a pause, Ice Maiden continued, “Furthermore, this matter is somewhat odd. According to what I know, it’s impossible for humans to advance to the Mythical stage with their own strength, much less reach the Terror grade. That creature said that he’s human, but his strength is very terrifying at the Terror grade. Unless he’s not human, there must be some secret behind this matter.”

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he looked at the Moon Palace door in silence.

He didn’t care if the person who had possessed Wei Ge was human, but there was something that Zhou Wen was very concerned about.

For Shen Yuchi to risk his life for Wei Ge, something didn’t seem right no matter how he thought about it.

“Do you think it’s possible that Shen Yuchi knew of the existence of the Bone Pottery jar from the beginning?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“What do you mean? If he knew, why did he take the risk to come here?” Ice Maiden frowned.

“That’s right. It doesn’t make sense, but there’s something else that doesn’t make sense. Although I haven’t interacted much with Wei Ge, I do know him a little. He’s definitely not someone who would sacrifice himself for a place like the bureau, yet he actually took the initiative to take the risk. This doesn’t seem like his character.”

“Is it possible that he was forced to do so? After all, even if lots were really drawn, Shen Yuchi might have tampered with them. The person who eventually had to go was still likely to be him. He might as well have taken the initiative. If he succeeded, he could still obtain Shen Yuchi’s recognition in the future,” Ice Maiden said.

“No, Wei Ge knows that Shen Yuchi is afraid of me. If he really needs to risk his life, he will probably seek help from me. It’s impossible for him to stop me from interfering with his actions.”

Zhou Wen paused for a moment before continuing, “Is it possible that Wei Ge also recognizes the Bone Pottery and knows what’s inside, so he took the initiative to take the risk?”

“It seems illogical,” Ice Maiden said with a frown.

“But adding the two unreasonable things together seems to make sense. Otherwise, I really can’t figure out why Wei Ge and Shen Yuchi would do something so illogical,” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s not difficult to find out the answer. Just go in and take a look,” Ice Maiden said as she looked at the door of Moon Palace.

“Then let’s go in and take a look.” Zhou Wen glanced at his phone and realized that it was still downloading. He got Ice Maiden to lead the way as the two of them entered through the Moon Palace door.

He didn’t have a feel of it outside the door, but the moment he entered, Zhou Wen felt a terrifying coldness pass through the space suit that could withstand low temperatures. It made him shiver.

When Ice Maiden walked over, Zhou Wen immediately felt the coldness dissipate significantly as his body warmed up.

How did Shen Yuchi and the rest survive such a low temperature? Zhou Wen felt increasingly puzzled. Even his body couldn’t withstand it. He didn’t believe that Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan could withstand such low temperatures.

Thankfully, with Ice Maiden as an ice-elemental expert beside him, the coldness naturally receded wherever she went. Zhou Wen could vaguely see that there were many jade buildings in the cold fog, like a fairyland in myths.
