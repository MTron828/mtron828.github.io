Chapter 1269: Zhou Wen’s Specialty

The wooden hut was small to begin with, and the woman was already very close to Zhou Wen. This strike was just too close to the woman. With Zhou Wen’s saber speed, he only needed an instant to strike the woman.

However, at such a close distance, the Asura Saber stopped. Under the woman’s gaze, the Asura Saber trembled and couldn’t advance another inch. It stopped in front of the woman and trembled incessantly. It was no different from a struggling, dying fish.

Zhou Wen used his other hand to press on the saber’s back, but the Asura Saber was still unable to proceed forward any further.

Bang!

The woman’s eyes narrowed as Zhou Wen was sent flying with his saber. He slammed into the wooden bed and several parts of the Dragon King armor shattered. Zhou Wen spewed out a mouthful of blood as he felt a bone-chilling pain in his chest.

At some point in time, the woman had walked to the bed and reached out to grab the Clown Mask on Zhou Wen’s face.

Zhou Wen suddenly widened his eyes as a shadow that resembled Great Brahma appeared. The fourth face with its back facing the black hole slowly turned. As the face turned, the black hole behind it grew bigger and bigger, as though it wanted to devour everything.

Countless wraiths screamed inside as countless hellspawn roared as though they wanted to turn the world into purgatory.

The woman glared at the black hole that resembled the entrance to hell, but the corners of her mouth curled up slightly as she revealed a look of disdain. She pressed her palm at the black hole.

Her fingers were smooth and flawless, as perfect as the world’s most perfect white jade.

This palm contained unparalleled power, as though it could suppress all worlds. The terrifying black hole gradually shrank under the palm.

The wraiths in the black hole screamed as the terrifying roars became weaker and weaker until they could no longer be heard.

As for the black hole, it was compressed to the point of becoming a rift. Great Brahma’s huge body became as tiny as an ant under the suppression.

The terrifying palm had already occupied the world and was about to smash Great Brahma and Zhou Wen into pieces.

However, Great Brahma and Zhou Wen suddenly vanished. They vanished from the woman’s terrifying palm, leaving the woman somewhat alarmed.

It was impossible for a Terror-grade spatial ability to break through her suppression. In fact, spatial teleportation wasn’t that easy to use in the hut. It was very easy to have problems entering the spatial passageway.

However, Zhou Wen vanished just like that. Furthermore, another humanoid creature appeared almost at the same time under the woman’s palm. The woman failed to retract her palm in time as the terrifying power in her jade hand crushed the humanoid creature into ashes.

Although it was only a fleeting glance, the woman could already see that the humanoid creature she had crushed to death was one of the people standing in the room.

After Zhou Wen threw the person over, she had placed him behind her, near the wooden hut’s entrance.

The woman realized something and turned her head to see that Zhou Wen had already rushed out of the Present Hut under the protection of the Chaos Egg.

The woman’s eyes were filled with anger. The mere human had actually escaped under her nose. Furthermore, she had accidentally killed her prey. This was something her pride couldn’t accept.

Without any hesitation, the woman rushed out of the Present Hut.

Although there was only a wooden door between the Present Hut and the Time Corridor, it was like a teleportation door that separated two worlds. Even if the woman wanted to leave, she needed the same time to pass through the door.

When she arrived at the Time Corridor, she saw Zhou Wen passing through another wooden door and returning to a Time Hut.

The woman chased after him again. She was furious, but the time she passed through the wooden door prevented her from using her powerful strength and speed.

When she entered the Time Hut, she saw Zhou Wen pass through the wooden door and leave.

“Let’s see where you can run to. No matter where you go—be it heaven or hell—you will definitely die today.” Almost no one could see the woman move as she had already entered the wooden door and rushed out of the Time Hut.

After Zhou Wen rushed out of the Time Hut, he turned his head and saw the woman’s face coming out of the door, but her body was still inside the door enveloped by light.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen used the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art’s interstellar teleportation ability and arrived above Venus.

When he threw those people at the women, he had already left coordinates on them. Then, he used Great Brahma to attract the woman’s attention, making her think that he was in a hopeless situation. Finally, he swapped positions with one of them using Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping.

He originally imagined that the woman wouldn’t discover that he wasn’t the one who had died, but her eyesight and reaction were much better than he had imagined. She immediately discovered Zhou Wen’s exchange with the person and chased after him without giving him any time. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Zhou Wen teleported to Venus as a precaution. If the woman could still catch up, he could use the dungeon on Venus to fend her off.

After arriving on Venus, Zhou Wen realized that he was near the rift valley where he had previously discovered the metal flower. He couldn’t help but have a thought as he immediately instant transmitted towards it.

It would be fine if the woman couldn’t catch up. If she could catch up, perhaps he could try to use the metal flower’s power to stop her for a period of time.

Just as Zhou Wen finished instant transmission, a tall woman appeared where he had been. Like a ghost, she gradually materialized from an illusion. She was none other than the woman who had been pursuing him.

Zhou Wen sensed the woman’s appearance, but he wasn’t flustered. Although she was a Calamity-grade expert with overwhelming strength, she might not be able to kill him.

Zhou Wen might not be the strongest in other aspects, but his ability to survive and escape made him an expert among experts.

The experience of dying countless times in-game was definitely not a waste of time. Having experienced countless deaths, Zhou Wen definitely knew how to avoid death.

After instant transmitting to the edge of the rift valley, Zhou Wen instant transmitted into the valley again without any hesitation.

The Chaos Egg appeared outside his body the moment he finished instant transmission. It fell to the bottom like a huge ball, and that was where the metal flower was.

As the Chaos Egg fell, the solid Essence Energy in it suddenly increased greatly. Soon, it filled half the Chaos Egg, making Zhou Wen delighted instead of being alarmed.

The greater the reaction of the Chaos Egg, the more terrifying the metal flower was.

If it were any other time, Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t wish to encounter such a terrifying creature, but at this moment, he hoped that the metal flower would be as strong as possible.

The woman followed closely into the valley. Without the restrictions of the teleportation door, she was much faster than Zhou Wen. She instantly arrived beside the Chaos Egg and reached out to grab it. She appeared even faster than Zhou Wen had imagined. The Chaos Egg hadn’t reached the bottom of the valley and was only halfway in its descent.

Heaven bless me!?Zhou Wen could only pray to the heavens, hoping that the metal flower would react.

In theory, when any creature’s territory was invaded by unfamiliar creatures, they would first pay attention to the creatures that could threaten them.

As for the Chaos Egg itself, it posed very little threat. If the metal flower didn’t cower, it might treat the woman as its first target.
