Chapter 1606 Breaking Through the Encirclement

The restrictions on Zhou Wen decreased significantly without the void lightning’s bombardment.

Although there were three more people attacking, Zhou Wen felt that this was an opportunity

Bang!

Xiao struck the Chaos Egg with his palm. The power that was enough to distort space and rip through time deformed the Chaos Egg greatly. It flew out like a bullet in the shape of an eggplant.

Although the Chaos Egg flew towards the Sun God Light blasted out by Jiuyang, it dodged the Void Salamander’s bite.

Jiuyang’s punch was like a sun as it struck the Chaos Egg and sent Zhou Wen flying.

Although the Chaos Egg flickered as though it would crack at any moment, it ultimately didn’t shatter.

The scepter in Old K’s hand slammed into the Chaos Egg that came flying to him. It nearly split the Chaos Egg apart. It looked like a calabash with a thin waist in the middle, but it still didn’t snap.

Zhou Wen was actually most afraid of being devoured by the Void Salamander. Although the attacks of Old K and company were ferocious, they failed to deal much damage on him after the screening of the Teacher Domain and the Chaos Egg. Zhou Wen remained virtually unharmed with the Prisoned Dragon armor donned.

If it wasn’t for Demonic Neonate in his arms, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have been injured.

Old K, Xiao, and Jiuyang’s powers also left their trajectories in the Teacher Domain, but Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to piece together their trajectories. After all, he was besieged by four Heaven-level existences. Zhou Wen’s situation was dire.

Old K and company had deliberately avoided the Void Salamander, but since they were attacking Zhou Wen, it was impossible for them to completely dodge it.

The trio attacked the Chaos Egg from different directions when Zhou Wen suddenly retracted his Teacher Domain.

In the next moment, the extremely terrifying void lightning on the Void Salamander’s body appeared again, instantly enveloping everyone.

The three people who were attacking Zhou Wen had no choice but to gather their strength to resist the void lightning

Boom!

The trio’s strength collided with the void lightning. A terrifying shockwave erupted from the collision of the four Heaven-level forces, tearing open some cracks in Xiao and Old K’s domains.

Zhou Wen’s senses were extremely sharp as he immediately sensed the existence of the cracks. Without any hesitation, he grabbed the opportunity and rushed out of the Chaos Egg. He unsheathed the Golden Wyrm Scissors in his hand and widened a crack before disappearing with interstellar teleportation.

“Damn it!” Old K felt a headache coming on. Zhou Wen had managed to escape under such circumstances.

The Void Salamander was sent retreating by the combined forces of the trio. Its ferocious nature was triggered as lightning erupted from its body, transforming into an infinite sea of lightning that surged towards the trio.

“The Void Salamander can’t be defeated by force. Leave quickly.” Xiao retreated and vanished into the void like a ghost. Jiuyang forcefully blasted away the lightning storm and forged a path before rushing into the distance.

Old K raised his scepter, forming an invisible force that protected his body, but the void lightning could still penetrate it. It made his hair stand on end as smoke emitted.

Thankfully, the scepter had already blocked most of the force. The lightning didn’t kill him.

The Void Salamander didn’t fight them to the death. After spewing out the lightning, its body transformed into an electric blast and vanished in the blink of an eye. Zhou Wen had already teleported back to Earth, but he didn’t go to Zhuolu. Instead, he went to the Holy Land.

Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on heading to the Holy Land because it was useless.

TIC

Although the Holy Land was on Earth, one had to pass through a teleportation nexus to enter it. Apart from that, there was no other way to enter.

Therefore, even if Zhou Wen went to the Holy Land, it was impossible for him to take the Void Salamander in. Furthermore, it was useless even if he did.

The Holy Land was the only place on Earth without any rules to suppress it. There might be an Apocalypse-grade dimensional creature inside. Even if the Void Salamander entered, it wouldn’t be able to cause any trouble.

Therefore, in the beginning, Zhou Wen hadn’t planned on heading to the Holy Land, but the arrival and siege of Old K and company gave him new ideas.

Since Old K and company could ambush him outside the dimensional zone, he too could ambush the Saints outside the Holy Land.

If dimensional creatures left the Holy Land, they would be suppressed by Earth’s rules. Even Apocalypse-grade powerhouses wouldn’t leave the Holy Land for no reason. Then, the only creatures that could pose a threat to the Void Salamander were the few Holy Artifact-wielding Saints.

However, those Saints might not be the Void Salamander’s match.

Zhou Wen clearly sensed that the true Heaven-level Void Salamander was much stronger than the Heaven-level powers produced by Xiao and Jiuyang’s reliance on the Holy Artifacts.

So what if it’s the Holy Land? If you want my life, you have to pay the price. Zhou Wen teleported to the vicinity of the Holy Land and quickly felt space tremble. Lightning appeared out of thin air and transformed into the Void Salamander.

“Come on! Big worm!” Zhou Wen immediately rushed towards the teleportation nexus at the entrance of the Holy Land when he saw the Void Salamander appear.

It used to be guarded by members of the six families, but now, it was guarded by Saints. “Who dares to barge into the Holy Land?” A Saint was guarding the area in each of the four directions. When they saw Zhou Wen appear above the teleportation nexus, they immediately shouted in unison, prepared to attack.

Before they could attack, they saw a snow-white glow in the sky. A terrifying sea of lightning descended and instantly electrocuted everything nearby, including the four Saints. Everything within a fifty-kilometer radius was charred black, turning into a huge charred pit.

The teleportation nexus in the middle of the lightning remained standing. Although it was charred black, it wasn’t destroyed.

After Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain condensed the Void Lightning Grand Art, its seal on the void lightning had reached a hundred percent. Zhou Wen converged the Teacher Domain, covering only the Chaos Egg and allowing the other places to be struck by the lightning. The lightning in a radius of fifty kilometers surged like an ocean. Such a commotion had long attracted the Federation’s attention. The satellites in the sky had already captured the images of the lightning sea and the Void Salamander.

“Holy sh*t, isn’t that Egg Sovereign’s Void Salamander? Why did it come to Earth?”

“That looks like the Holy Land, right?”

“Holy sh*t, Egg Sovereign is attacking the Holy Land!”

“Quick… Quick… Quick livestream… This will make an exclusive headline…”

Soon, everyone in the Federation watched the livestream in surprise. They couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Egg Sovereign… is attacking the Holy Land… Isn’t this too ridiculous…”

“He has inflated! Egg Sovereign has really inflated! Although his Companion Beasts are very ferocious, a place like the Holy Land definitely can’t be defeated with one or two Companion Beasts. What’s the difference between that and suicide?”

Instantly, everyone broke out into a flurry of discussion. Ordinary people believed that Egg Sovereign was attacking the Holy Land, but the truly discerning bigwigs knew that Zhou Wen was trying to divert the trouble to the Holy Land.
