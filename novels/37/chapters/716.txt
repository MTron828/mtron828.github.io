Chapter 717: Worm Dugu’s Plan

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen took out his saber and prepared to slash at him. After all this back and forth, Worm Dugu was actually targeting the chick.

Worm Dugu hurriedly retreated out of the yard when he saw Zhou Wen take out his saber. As he retreated, he shouted, “Master, I’ll visit you another day. Call me if there’s anything you need. I’ll be there anytime.”

Zhou Wen closed the door and immediately summoned the Invisibility Cloak. Then, he jumped out of the window at the back of his residence and tailed Worm Dugu from afar to see what he was up to.

Zhou Wen saw Worm Dugu secretly arrive at an uninhabited spot before turning into a mosquito. He then flew out of the school.

Zhou Wen wore the Invisibility Cloak and had Truth Listener on his ear. He kept monitoring the movements of Worm Dugu and soon followed him to a dilapidated warehouse.

There’s indeed an accomplice. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to listen and realized that there was another person in the warehouse besides Worm Dugu.

Zhou Wen listened attentively, hoping to gather some useful information.

With Truth Listener around, he didn’t need to risk entering the warehouse.

“Second Grandpa, what took you so long? How did the matter regarding Essence Gold go?” The person who spoke to Worm Dugu was a girl. She appeared rather young. She had a round face and huge eyes. She looked to be about sixteen or seventeen years old at most.

“I screwed up. The Blood Thread Brain-Eating Gu in Qin Wufu’s body was extracted by someone else,” said Worm Dugu.

“Apart from our Dugu family, there’s actually someone who can extract a Blood Thread Brain-Eating Gu that has entrenched a brain?” the girl said in disbelief.

“I didn’t believe it either, but it was indeed extracted. Furthermore, Qin Wufu was completely unharmed,” said Worm Dugu helplessly.

“What about the Essence Gold? Is the An family willing to sell so much refined Essence Gold to us?” the girl asked worriedly.

“Probably not.” Dugu Gu smiled and said, “But don’t worry. Even if we don’t use Essence Gold, I’ve already thought of a way to capture the Myriad Poison Gu King.”

“Second Grandpa, didn’t you try that the last time? Even the Magical Hair Gu is helpless against the Myriad Poison Gu King. It was almost destroyed. Do you have any more powerful Gu?” The girl looked at Worm Dugu in disbelief.

Dugu Gu chuckled and said, “I don’t have one, but I’ve just become a disciple to a master. If I can get his help, I’ll definitely be able to capture that Myriad Poison Gu King.”

“Second Grandpa, didn’t you say that the master you had is already dead? Where did this master come from?” The girl’s face looked puzzled.

“Didn’t I just say that I just became a disciple of this master? He has a phoenix fledging. With the help of the phoenix fledgling, we don’t need to forge an Essence Gold Worm Nurturing Furnace to still capture the Myriad Poison Gu King,” said Worm Dugu.

“Then, Second Grandpa, quickly get your new master to help,” the girl said.

“Cough, cough. There’s no rush.” Worm Dugu knew very well that it wasn’t that easy to get Zhou Wen to use the phoenix fledgling to help him capture the Myriad Poison Gu King.

The girl sighed and said, “I originally thought that our luck was good and we happened to encounter the situation of Qin Wufu having his brain invaded by a Blood Thread Brain-Eating Gu. I thought we could exchange for enough Essence Gold, but I never expected that we wouldn’t even get a single bit of Essence Gold. I wonder when we will be able to capture the Myriad Poison King.”

“Mi’er, don’t worry. With Second Grandpa around, I guarantee that I’ll help you obtain the Gu King of Myriad Poison Valley. Furthermore, other than me, no one else has the ability to take the Gu King away. Just relax.” Worm Dugu changed the topic and said, “Stay in Luoyang and have some fun for a few days. When we are to return to the South District, I’ll naturally seek you out. Don’t run around. You can’t leave Luoyang City, understand?”

“Got it, Second Grandpa.” Mi’er agreed seriously.

After some thought, Mi’er asked again, “Second Grandpa, should I visit your master? Second Grandpa, how should I address your master?”

“No need, no need. You don’t have to worry about this matter.” After Worm Dugu sent Mi’er away, he muttered to himself, “I don’t know if there’s a second phoenix fledgling. I reckon the possibility of there being a second one is very low. Even if there is one, I’m afraid it won’t be easy to obtain it. I should think of a way to invite Master to follow me to Myriad Poison Valley, but how can I move him? From the looks of it, I have to think of a way.”

Zhou Wen listened outside all this time. He heard them talking about Gu, but he didn’t hear any plans. From Mi’er’s tone, Qin Wufu’s injuries didn’t seem to have anything to do with them.

Although I don’t know if the chick is a real phoenix, it does seem to be able to restrain dimensional creatures like Gu worms. In the future, I have to bring it along if I have to go to the South District, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

After Worm Dugu left the dilapidated warehouse, he returned to the hotel and didn’t come out again. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Zhou Wen eavesdropped for a long time, but he didn’t gather any useful information. Finally, he gave up on monitoring Worm Dugu and returned to the school dorm.

The ability of the Invisibility Cloak is really useful. Even if I walk on the streets during the day, I don’t need to worry about being seen by others. Even if I don’t use the Wheel of Destiny, it’s enough to remain invisible under normal circumstances. Zhou Wen thought about how he could use the Invisibility Cloak to do something big.

Before the dimensional zones are fully unlocked, I should download some game dungeons. I’ll download the famous dimensional zones first. I wonder what dimensional zones Primordial Immortal Sword, Origin Realm King, and Death of the Underworld Companion Beasts come from. After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to start with the nearest dimensional zones.

The famous dimensional zones closer to Luoyang should be the Xia family’s dimensional zones, right? Zhou Wen looked up the information and quickly made up his mind. He planned on heading to the Xia family’s territory.

The Xia family controlled many mysterious dimensional zones. Zhou Wen had always wanted to go to a few of them.

One of the most famous dimensional zones was named Ancient Sword Tomb. It was said that there were many legendary swords there. The Xia family’s old hero had once obtained a Mythical sword-type Companion Egg from Ancient Sword Tomb and used it to reign supreme.

However, that was decades ago. The Xia family had controlled the Ancient Sword Tomb for so long, so they definitely had more than one Mythical Companion Beast sword.

Zhou Wen suspected that the demonic sword that Demonic Neonate snatched from Xia Xuanyue was from the Ancient Sword Tomb.

After I’m done with the Xia family, I’ll tour the six families’ territories and download the dimensional zones they control. When that happens, I can grind for any Companion Beast I want. There’s no need for me to risk my life. Zhou Wen did as he said. He planned on informing An Sheng before setting off for the Xia family.

This time, Zhou Wen didn’t dare leave the chick and antelope behind. He was mainly afraid that the Dugu family would target the chick. Although the possibility of the antelope being stolen was very low, Zhou Wen still planned on taking them with him to prevent any accidents.
