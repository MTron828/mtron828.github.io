Chapter 891: Nine-Tailed Fox

Translator: CKtalon

Nine... Ten... Eleven... Is this fellow a monster? Uesugi Nao stared intently at Zhou Wen, feeling extremely shocked.

Zhou Wen casually waved his hand and used more than ten sword intents. And at his age, how could he comprehend so many sword intents?

Zhou Wen’s sword intents were naturally not something he had mastered himself. In fact, Zhou Wen had never practiced sword arts before. What he was truly good at was movement techniques. At most, he could add the Immortal Slaying move to his list.

These sword intents were what Zhou Wen had learned in the peach blossom mystic realm. The white-robed man’s sword art contained three thousand sword intents. This was just a drop in the ocean.

Although Zhou Wen hadn’t fully comprehended the three thousand sword intents, he had already memorized them. It wasn’t enough to use it against a true top-notch swordsman, but he could still use it casually.

“That’s the general problem. There’s nothing wrong with the rest. Go back and train slowly. I still have something on, so I’ll be leaving now.” Zhou Wen handed the practice sword back to Uesugi Nao before carrying Ya’er out of the training room.

Uesugi Nao watched Zhou Wen leave. She was in a daze for a long time before coming to her senses. After the door to the training room closed, she snapped to her senses. Training... What training can I do... That’s not the Three Immortals Sword Art at all... There aren’t so many sword intent training methods in the Three Immortals Sword Art. What the hell am I to train with!

Although she said that, Uesugi Nao was still shocked by Zhou Wen’s sword art. To be able to casually unleash more than ten sword intents mixed together was something only a few top sword masters overseas could do.

“Miss, are you alright?” The female guard walked in. She had been secretly protecting Uesugi Nao, but with Zhou Wen around, she didn’t dare approach. She only came over after Zhou Wen left.

“It’s fine. From the looks of it, I’ve underestimated the young experts of the Federation. It’s indeed reasonable for Zhou Wen to be able to stir up such a storm in the Federation,” Uesugi Nao said.

“What happened?” the female guard asked.

“It’s nothing. I’ve seen Zhou Wen’s sword art and it’s indeed very strong. Unfortunately, no matter how strong his sword art, it’s useless. Without a Guardian, humans will ultimately not be able to step into the stage of being a human god. No matter how strong his sword art, he’s only mortal.” Uesugi Nao slowly regained her confidence.

Although Zhou Wen was strong, he was stuck below the Mythical stage. She had Great Skyfiend and was already in the Mythical stage. She still had the right to look down on him.

I can study the world of swords that Zhou Wen mentioned, Uesugi Nao thought.

“I’ve already said that a person like Zhou Wen definitely has something extraordinary about him,” the female guard said.

Uesugi Nao didn’t say anything else. She looked at the female guard and asked, “How’s the information I asked you to gather coming along? Did you find out who Tyrant Behemoth’s owner is?”

“There’s nothing for now. Our men are already investigating,” the female guard said.

“Find him as soon as possible. I must avenge the slaying of Orochi,” Uesugi Nao said.

Zhou Wen returned to his dorm and began grinding again. Now, he only wanted to quickly figure out the Chess Mountain dungeon. If the alchemist came to him again, he could lure the alchemist to Chess Mountain.

The interior of Deer Terrace Pavilion was bigger than Zhou Wen had imagined. As he needed to explore it, it wasn’t like he could directly use Earth Escape. He wouldn’t know what he might miss in the middle.

After entering Deer Terrace Pavilion again, Zhou Wen continued exploring.

Not long after, an arched door suddenly appeared in front of Zhou Wen. After passing through the arch, there was a huge space inside.

This space looked like the interior of a tower. There were arched doors all around, and there was water flowing in many of them.

The bottom of this space was occupied by water, like a huge circular pool. And in the middle was a huge bronze tripod cauldron.

And inside the bronze tripod cauldron, there was a white fox. It was different from ordinary foxes. The fox had nine snow-white tails on its back.

As for its body, it was trapped by the chains that passed through the bronze tripod cauldron. It seemed to be imprisoned in the bronze tripod cauldron.

Is that... a nine-tailed fox? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall the legend of Deer Terrace Pavilion—the peerless demon concubine who could topple kingdoms and bring disaster to the people.

Although the Nine-Headed Pheasant Spirit and Jade Lute Spirit were ranked equal, the first impression people had of a demon concubine was that of a nine-tailed fox. There wouldn’t be a second one.

Could she... be The Thearch? Zhou Wen was puzzled as he stared at the Nine-Tailed White Fox inside the bronze tripod cauldron.

Suddenly, the Nine-Tailed White Fox opened her eyes and looked in the direction of the blood-colored avatar.

They were fox’s eyes, but in Zhou Wen’s eyes, they were indescribably charming. It even made Zhou Wen feel tempted to run towards the white fox in the bronze tripod cauldron.

Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly focused.

He originally had the ability to focus. At that moment, he focused his mind and immediately regained his clarity. When he looked at the nine-tailed fox again, he didn’t feel anything. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, the demonic glint in the nine-tailed fox’s eyes intensified. Perhaps due to the demonic glint in its eyes, the nine-tailed fox in Zhou Wen’s eyes gradually transformed into a beautiful woman in white.

Zhou Wen had seen plenty of beauties, but he had never seen such a seductive woman. Her eyes seemed to hook onto people, as though any man in the world would be willing to die for her from the mere move of her gaze.

The blood-colored avatar walked towards the extremely seductive woman in a daze as though it had lost its soul. It seemed to only have eyes for the woman, unable to contain anything else.

The blood-colored avatar quickly walked to the bronze tripod cauldron and looked at the girl inside. Without any hesitation, it jumped in.

However, there was no white-robed woman in the bronze cauldron. It was clearly the evil and demonic Nine-Tailed White Fox. It opened its bloody mouth and bit at the blood-colored avatar’s head.

Just as the nine-tailed fox was about to bite the blood-colored avatar, the dazed blood-colored avatar suddenly flashed and dodged the fox’s bloody mouth. At the same time, an invisible sword beam slashed across the nine-tailed fox’s neck, dyeing the snow-white fur red.

Zhou Wen thought to himself that it was a pity. As he had to pretend to be charmed by the nine-tailed fox, he couldn’t condense his Essence Energy ahead of time, so he couldn’t use Immortal Slaying. Otherwise, this strike might have beheaded the nine-tailed fox.

The nine-tailed fox was alarmed and furious. It found it unbelievable that its charm was useless against Zhou Wen.

In fact, Zhou Wen was afraid of many things, but powers like bewitchment were useless against him. Previously, even the Lost Immortal Sutra couldn’t bewitch him, much less a nine-tailed fox.
