Chapter 1018: Wooden Hut

Translator: CKtalon

There was a strange spatial distortion at the entrance of the tree hole. He felt a slight spatial fluctuation when he passed through it.

After entering the tree hole, the scene he saw left him slightly taken aback. Inside was a wooden hut, not the grave or tombstone that Zhou Wen had imagined.

All the tools in the wooden house seemed to be carved from the tree itself.

There was a wooden bed, a wooden table, a wooden stool, and a wooden rack. All sorts of equipment looked ancient and artistic. On the wooden rack were many books.

On the table was an open book, as though someone had been reading it.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t see any other creatures despite looking through the entire hut.

This is a game. Logically speaking, only dimensional items can appear in-game. Could these books be dimensional items? Zhou Wen saw that Demonic Neonate had already walked to the wooden table and was looking at the opened book on it.

Zhou Wen also went over to take a look and realized that he didn’t recognize a single word on it. It was a mess of words of an unknown language—he couldn’t understand a single word.

Demonic Neonate extended her tiny hand and the book flew up by itself. It arrived in front of her and floated above her palm.

Demonic Neonate actually likes to read after her evolution. This is a good phenomenon. Zhou Wen was rather gratified.

Demonic Neonate was good in every way, but she was just too ferocious. She usually didn’t say a word and she attacked only when death was certain from a single strike. She didn’t give anyone a chance to counterattack. She was like a cold-blooded killer.

Although Demonic Neonate was flawless as a Companion Beast, Zhou Wen felt that she was, after all, an intelligent creature with feelings. It was better to have some humanity.

Reading could enrich people with feelings. This seemed to be a good sign.

“Neonate, what’s written on it...” Before Zhou Wen could finish his sentence, he saw Demonic Neonate grab the two sides of the book, open her mouth wide, and eat the book like she was eating a cake.

“...” Zhou Wen looked at Demonic Neonate in a daze, unable to say a word. He realized that he had misunderstood something.

Demonic Neonate didn’t stop at all. Her mouth opened and closed as she swallowed the entire book with a few bites.

After she was done eating, she still hadn’t had enough. She walked to the bookshelf and devoured the other books one by one. When she had finished, she even licked her lips, looking like she hadn’t had enough.

“Why are you eating those books?” Zhou Wen finally reacted and asked Demonic Neonate in puzzlement.

“Food,” Demonic Neonate said.

Zhou Wen was helpless. It was unlikely that Demonic Neonate would explain it clearly. He still didn’t know what the books were.

Suddenly, the screen went black as the blood-colored avatar died again.

How can this be? The one-hour time limit in the garden shouldn’t be up yet? Could it be that there’s a different time limit in the treehouse? Zhou Wen guessed as he started the dungeon again. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Now, Zhou Wen was certain that there was no mask in-game. There was only a treehouse in the tree.

Is Frod lying, or is it really different in reality? Zhou Wen was almost confident of bringing Wang Lu, Lance, and company out alive, but there were still some things he wanted to figure out.

After entering the garden again, the tree automatically opened the entrance to the wooden hut when it saw Demonic Neonate. This time, Zhou Wen paid special attention to the time inside the tree hole before discovering an extremely strange phenomenon.

The flow of time in the tree hole’s wooden hut was much faster than outside. An hour outside was only a minute here.

Zhou Wen had only discovered the changes in his body after using the Eight Perfections Wisdom and Hell King Supremacy, allowing him to determine that the flow of time here was different.

Even if he used the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, it was useless against the abnormal flow of time here. This was because such a flow of time was normal in the tree hole’s wooden hut. It wasn’t a taboo power.

Seeing that the books in the wooden hut didn’t respawn again, Zhou Wen hurriedly left the tree hole.

He was afraid that staying inside where time flowed too quickly would affect his true body. That wouldn’t be good.

Thankfully, it was only a game and it didn’t affect his true body. However, the secret of the garden seemed to end there. There were no graves or masks.

Now, Zhou Wen knew the dungeon like the back of his hand. All he needed to do was wait for tomorrow to head to the Maze of Lies in reality to see if it was different.

While it was still early, Zhou Wen went to the underground sea again. The cocoon in the war wagon hadn’t respawned; he didn’t know if it would respawn in the future either.

With the underground sea’s Guardian gone, Zhou Wen made another trip to Ant City.

After being wrecked by Ant City’s Guardian for so long, I can finally do something about it. Zhou Wen was somewhat excited.

Ant City was a dungeon that had come with the phone. Ant City’s Guardian was also the first Guardian Zhou Wen had seen. Zhou Wen was still looking forward to killing Ant City’s Guardian and clearing the dungeon.

He stormed all the way through Ant City and destroyed the Golden Flying Ant’s nest, exposing the Guardian Egg.

“Neonate, kill it.” Zhou Wen floated in the air, waiting to see the Ant City Guardian get killed.

After Demonic Neonate transformed into her Terror form, her figure vanished from Zhou Wen’s sight. At the same time, he couldn’t see the demonic sword as she instantly cleaved open the Guardian cocoon.

Zhou Wen saw the Ant City Guardian again. At that moment, the Ant City Guardian seemed to have grown a lot.

Zhou Wen remembered that the last time he saw her, she still looked like a girl, but now, she looked completely mature. She exuded the charm of a mature woman.

Her lascivious body curves, orange-red pupils, and long hair made Zhou Wen almost not dare look at her.

Zhou Wen discovered that the feelers on the Guardian’s head and the transparent wings on her back had vanished. She looked no different from a human.

This is the first time I’ve seen a Guardian who can constantly grow. What’s this fellow’s background? I wonder which dimensional race she represents? Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, the Terror-form demonic sword slashed at the Guardian again.

Typical Guardians couldn’t even see the attack, much less resist it. Just as Zhou Wen thought that the Guardian was about to be killed, he saw the Guardian’s beautiful hands clasp together and clamp down on the Demonic Sword that came slashing down.

At the same time, a strange power fluctuation spread out from the pair of beautiful hands. With a terrifying power fluctuation, the Guardian’s figure vanished in front of Zhou Wen.

Not good! Zhou Wen immediately realized something as he quickly retreated.
