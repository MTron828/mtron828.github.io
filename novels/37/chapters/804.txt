Chapter 805: Dragon Gods

“Now that you’re free, you can go anywhere you want to go or do whatever you want,” Zhou Wen said to Ya’er.

However, Ya’er just looked at Zhou Wen without saying a word. She clearly knew how to speak, but for some reason, she didn’t say a word.

“Do you have anywhere you want to go or anything you want to do?” Zhou Wen asked again.

Ya’er shook her head slightly. She had been refined into a Kuman Nee by the Xiao brothers before she was even born. She probably didn’t know where she wanted to go or what she wanted.

“Then follow me. However, if you follow me, I have a few requests. If you can do it, you can follow me. If you can’t, you should head off by yourself,” Zhou Wen said to Ya’er.

Ya’er didn’t say a word as she looked at Zhou Wen.

“Firstly, you are to follow my orders. Without my orders, you are not to injure others. Secondly, you are not to use Gu to harm others without my permission. Thirdly, you can reason with me, but you have to listen to me in the end. Fourthly, don’t casually show your strength in front of others... Can you do it?” Zhou Wen asked Ya’er.

Ya’er looked at Zhou Wen and nodded without any hesitation. He did not know if she had really understood.

Zhou Wen felt odd seeing Ya’er nod. Although he was somewhat happy, he was also somewhat worried.

Even Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if Ya’er could be considered a human. If she still had the taboos of a Kuman Nee, she would probably spell trouble in the future.

However, at this point, Zhou Wen had no choice but to take her back.

He brought Ya’er along to buy some clothes. Although she didn’t say a word, she was very obedient. She did whatever Zhou Wen said. She looked like an ordinary, obedient child. She didn’t show any of the ruthlessness she had when destroying the Xiao family at all.

“Old Zhou, where did you abduct this child?” Li Xuan asked in surprise when he saw Zhou Wen return with a child.

“I picked her up on the way,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Could she be lost?” Li Xuan asked.

“No, I went to a dimensional zone where Gu appear. No one will take a child there,” Zhou Wen said.

“Who’s so heartless to abandon such a cute little girl?” Li Xuan looked at the girl with pity.

“I don’t know, but I plan on adopting her and bringing her with me.” Zhou Wen took out the Gu pot and handed it to Li Xuan. “The two Ice Silkworms are inside.”

“How’s the Xiao family?” Li Xuan asked with an odd expression as he held the Gu pot.

“It was destroyed by the Kuman Nee.” Zhou Wen didn’t elaborate because the scene was too tragic.

“They deserved it. How were they unafraid of the wrath of heaven to actually kill someone and dig out the baby?” Li Xuan said.

“Does this child have a name?” Li Xuan asked as he stroked her head.

“Ya’er, a name I gave her.” Zhou Wen felt relieved when he saw Ya’er not exhibiting any special reactions towards Li Xuan’s stroking of her head.

“What kind of name is this? How can such a cute little girl use such a name? You should at least call her Crescent or something. Even the common Xiaoya is way better than Ya’er, right? No, no, you have to give her a new name.” Li Xuan immediately shook his head when he heard Ya’er’s name.

“Let’s talk about it when I register her in the future. Let’s just treat Ya’er as a nickname.” Zhou Wen really didn’t know how to give names. It gave him a headache.

...

Soon, the Xiao family’s overnight destruction was discovered. Many people went to take a look and realized that there were traces of a large number of Gu. They guessed that the Xiao family had been destroyed by Gu, but no one knew the exact details.

The number one Xiao family in Chiang Rai was destroyed overnight. This became a legend in Chiang Rai. There were all kinds of stories. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Li Xuan planned on visiting the Dugu family with Worm Dugu to learn about Gu, but Zhou Wen stayed behind. As there was still no concrete news from Primordial Spore, he wanted to wait and see.

The Primordial Spore hadn’t successfully parasitized the dragon, but it hadn’t died either. Zhou Wen didn’t know what was happening.

Li Mobai also returned to Luoyang with Butterfly and Mute. Gu Shanshui even called and said that he had found a way to trap the Corpse Bug and wanted Zhou Wen to retrieve the calabash.

Zhou Wen was temporarily unable to head to Mong Hsat, so Gu Shanshui got Gu Lou to deliver the calabash to him.

Zhou Wen waited for news of the Primordial Spore while grinding.

Ancient Sword Tomb and Valley of No Return were excellent dungeons that produced many good items. Zhou Wen focused on grinding these two dungeons. Together with the Mythical creatures and rare creatures in other dungeons, he had to grind them all every time he respawned.

Zhou Wen went to the snow valley on the right side of the Valley of No Return a few times, but the blood-colored avatar would quickly die every time he entered. It was fine flying in the air, but when he was in the air, he could only see the snow-covered valley with no Gu to be seen.

Up to now, Zhou Wen still didn’t understand why the blood-colored avatar would die in the snow.

With Truth Listener and Supreme Hell King’s abilities, if a Gu is hidden in the snow, I should be able to sense it no matter how tiny it is. Furthermore, there’s no reaction from the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. This means that it’s not a taboo power. What killed the blood-colored avatar? Zhou Wen studied it for a while but failed to find the secret of the snow valley.

Zhou Wen guessed that most of the people who entered the Valley of No Return had died in the snow valley.

After all, those who dared to go there were experts at nurturing Gu. Many would have the means to deal with the Gu in the first few areas of the valley. However, the snow valley was not something that could be simply dealt with using Gu knowledge.

While Zhou Wen was gaming, Ya’er sat on the stool and watched him. She didn’t make a fuss.

Although Ya’er didn’t have a heartbeat, she wasn’t much different from a normal child. She also needed to eat to grow. Zhou Wen could sense that she was slowly growing at a speed similar to a normal child.

...

In a world that resembled a mystic realm, there was a huge palace that stood at the peak of a mountain. At the top of the palace was a huge statue that looked like a snake or a dragon, but it wasn’t either of them.

On the mountain that resembled a heavenly pillar, there was only a stone staircase that led up the mountain. It extended from the foot of the mountain all the way to the top of the mountain.

At that moment, a white-robed man with lightning bolts running through his body walked to the stone steps.

“Wang Mingyuan, you’re not guarding the divine tree and have actually dared to leave without permission. You’ve even come to Dragon God Mountain. Don’t you know that this is the place where the Dragon Gods live? It’s not a place a mixed-breed like you can come. Are you tired of living?” A monster with a human torso and a snake tail blocked Wang Mingyuan’s path.

“From now on, I’m the king of the Dragon Gods,” Wang Mingyuan said calmly.
