Chapter 1406: Completing the Transaction

Translator: CKtalon

“Since you know that I’m from Guide City, do you think I’m unaware that this place was originally Master Zhuang’s Mausoleum?” Zhou Wen said coldly.

“Is there a problem with this being Master Zhuang’s Mausoleum?” Woods asked in puzzlement.

“As one of the representatives of Daoism, will such a dimensional zone be as safe as it looks? I’m just afraid that we might end up dying here before we get to mine the Essence Crystal ores here.” Zhou Wen left some leeway as he still wanted to close the deal.

Woods turned somewhat nervous when he heard Zhou Wen say that. If Zhou Wen really noticed something amiss, it would be impossible for him to return with the Heavenly Robe.

“Mr. Zhou, you can’t have your subjective thoughts color the issue. It’s been quite a while since our discovery of the Essence Crystal ores. As you can see, there’s no problem here. If you don’t believe me, you can stay another two days or even attempt to mine the Essence Crystals. Our Cape family will definitely not lie and do something that’s at odds with the contract,” Woods said solemnly.

“Then we’ll do as you say. We’ll stay here for a few more days. If there’s really no problem, I’ll transfer the Heavenly Robe to you immediately,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

Woods cried inwardly. He only wanted to dispel Zhou Wen’s doubts verbally, but he never expected Zhou Wen to really choose to stay for a few days. If that happened, something would probably happen.

“Of course.” Although Woods said that, he was burning with anxiety. He was thinking about how he could get Zhou Wen to hand over the Heavenly Robe as soon as possible.

“Ah Sheng, make some preparations. Find a good place to set up camp and entertain Mr. Woods and the rest. They are guests from afar. We can’t slight them,” Zhou Wen said to An Sheng.

An Sheng understood what Zhou Wen was getting at and got someone to find a place to set up camp. He even got someone to return to transport supplies over, as though they wanted to stay here permanently.

Woods was anxious, but there was nothing he could do.

“Mr. Zhou, you can stay here and watch for as many days as you want, but we can’t keep delaying this deal, right? We know that you aren’t the kind of person who abides by contracts, but you have to give us a deadline, right? The family head is still waiting. We have to return and answer to him.” Woods patiently beat around the bush.

“Then let’s give it five days. As long as nothing happens in these five days, I’ll immediately transfer the Heavenly Robe to you and complete our deal,” Zhou Wen said.

Woods knew that they couldn’t wait five days. In another four days, this dimensional zone would undergo an anomaly. When that happened, everything would be for naught.

However, Woods couldn’t think of any way to get Zhou Wen to immediately transfer the Heavenly Robe to him.

Just as Woods’s brain was about to steam from an overdrive, an officer suddenly rushed over on a Companion Beast. He looked extremely disheveled and had several injuries. He looked like he had just been in a massive battle.

“Young Master Wen, Adjutant An, bad news. A large number of break-out creatures have appeared in Dragon Gate Grotto. Governor Qin is leading the Sunset Army to mount a full defense. There are heavy casualties. Please return immediately to provide support.” The officer jumped off his Companion Beast and rushed to Zhou Wen as he stumbled and shouted.

“What!” Zhou Wen and An Sheng were alarmed as they got up to return.

“Mr. Zhou, you can’t leave. According to our agreement, we have already led you to the Essence Crystal mine. Before you hand over the Heavenly Robe Companion Beast, you mustn’t leave this place.” Woods and company immediately stopped Zhou Wen.

At that moment, Woods was overjoyed. Heaven is really helping me!

“Young Master Wen, why don’t you stay here? I’ll lead the others back to provide support,” An Sheng said anxiously.

“Adjutant An, that won’t do. Governor Qin said that a Calamity creature might appear. Young Master Wen has to return. Otherwise, I’m afraid Luoyang won’t hold… Young Master Wen, quickly return… It will be too late if you delay any further…” The officer was about to cry.

“Young Master Wen!” An Sheng looked at Zhou Wen anxiously.

Zhou Wen was still hesitant. “This was Master Zhuang’s Mausoleum in the past. I have a nagging feeling that things aren’t that simple here.”

“Sigh, Mr. Zhou, you are really overthinking things. Why don’t we do this? Now that Luoyang is in trouble, we will give you a hand. We still have a portion of the Essence Crystals left, so we can give them to you. There are also some Companion Eggs here. Take them back with you as a token of our appreciation. We hope to help Luoyang tide through this crisis.”

Woods pointed into the valley and said, “This place is only so big. You can see everything at a glance. If there’s anything amiss, you would have long seen it. Even if you can’t see it, with so many people walking around, something would have already happened if there was danger. If you are still worried, you can circle around the area a few more times and confirm that there’s no problem. After the deal is completed, we will go to Luoyang with you to help you resist the break-out creatures. We can also stay in Luoyang for a few days. If there’s really a problem, it won’t be too late for you to come back to us.”

Now, all Woods wanted to do was get the Heavenly Robe in his hands as soon as possible. He would leave the rest to later. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Young Master Wen, the bigger picture is more important,” An Sheng urged anxiously when he saw Zhou Wen still hesitating.

“Alright, let’s do as Mr. Woods says.” Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and walked to him. He held Woods’s hand and said, seemingly touched, “I’ll cut the niceties, but thank you for your help. Mr. Woods, you’re really a nice guy.”

Without waiting for Woods to say a word, Zhou Wen released his grip and said to An Sheng, “Ah Sheng, quickly move everything back. We’ll head back immediately to provide support.”

“Mr. Zhou, about the Heavenly Robe…” Woods was a little anxious.

“I’ll get them to move the things. I’ll transfer it to you now,” Zhou Wen said as he began circulating his Essence Energy. His face flushed red as though he was using a forbidden ability.

Seeing that Zhou Wen was about to transfer the Heavenly Robe, Woods didn’t think it was right to stop An Sheng and company from moving things. All he could do was stand in front of Zhou Wen and wait for him to transfer the Heavenly Robe.

As transferring a Companion Beast required one to pay a considerable price, Woods felt that even if Zhou Wen had any special abilities, it was impossible for him to do so without paying a price. It was normal for Zhou Wen to look like this.

Zhou Wen constantly circulated his Essence Energy, but he had no intention of doing the deed. When they finished moving most of the things, Woods couldn’t help but ask only for Zhou Wen to suddenly reach out and press his hand on his chest.

Here it comes!?Woods immediately swallowed the words he was about to say and waited to receive the Companion Beast.

However, after waiting for a while, he saw Zhou Wen’s face turn redder and redder. However, Woods didn’t sense any Companion Beast transfer. As for the things there, An Sheng and company had almost finished moving them.

Woods felt that something was amiss. Just as he was about to say something, he heard Zhou Wen roar, “Go!”

Woods immediately felt a force enter his body as the energy of a Companion Beast surged into his body. He was immediately overjoyed.

Soon, the Companion Beast was transferred to Woods. Zhou Wen said with a pale face, “Mr. Woods, take a look. Is it the Companion Beast we were talking about? Don’t make a mistake.”

“There’s nothing wrong about it. Perfect. It’s a Terror-grade Deva Companion Beast. Thank you, Mr. Zhou. Are you alright?” Woods repeatedly made confirmation. The skill was the same as what was written in the contract. He was still worried, so he summoned it and wore the robe transformed from the Deva. Seeing that it was identical to what Zhou Wen wore, he felt relieved.

“Since we have closed the deal, I’ll head back to provide support. Let’s do business again if there’s a chance in the future..” Zhou Wen completed the handover and signed off the contract with Woods before leaving with An Sheng.
