Chapter 852: Expelling Evil

Translator: CKtalon

Under Zhou Wen’s orders, Tyrant Behemoth activated Absolute Strength and slammed into the Fiend Tomb, digging it open.

“The Zhang family... is finished...” Uncle Zhang was shocked, angry, and afraid. His face was pale.

The other members of the Zhang family also wore looks of nervousness. After all, the teachings of the ancestral Celestial Master remained fresh in their minds. It would be a lie to say that they weren’t worried. Even Zhang Chunqiu’s palms were sweating.

However, the Fiend Tomb was slowly dug open by Tyrant Behemoth. Nothing strange happened.

“I thought that Tyrant Behemoth was a Companion Beast from the West District, but I never expected it to be in Zhou Wen’s hands.” The elder from the Ultimate Family Clan looked at Tyrant Behemoth with envy. Anyone would want to have such a violent battle pet, but there weren’t many violent battle pets of such level and quality in the entire Federation.

Moses had been watching coldly from the sidelines. Although Tyrant Behemoth was powerful, it wasn’t stronger than his Giant God Sovereign. The Giant God Sovereign was also a Strength-type. Furthermore, it had an extremely powerful restraining effect on Companion Beasts of the same type.

If Zhou Wen wanted to rely on Tyrant Behemoth to fight him, Moses would definitely make him suffer.

As everyone had different thoughts, Tyrant Behemoth suddenly stopped digging and retreated a distance.

The Zhang family was puzzled as to why Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t digging. However, they suddenly saw Zhou Wen wave his hand as though something had flashed.

There was a cracking sound in the Fiend Tomb. Before they could see what was happening, black blood spewed out like a fountain, splattering everywhere.

At that moment, everyone could clearly see that there was an abstract human face symbol in the dug up Fiend Tomb. There was a sword mark on the human face symbol. It was unknown how it had been slashed, but it was spewing black blood.

Crack!

As the black blood spewed out, a hairline crack appeared on the mask on Charlie’s face. More and more cracks appeared. When the black blood spewed out, the mask shattered and turned to dust.

It wasn’t just the mask on Charlie’s face. Even the fiend faces on the Fiend Stones shattered. The people who had been petrified gradually recovered.

Unfortunately, they were already dead. Even with the Fiend Stone Petrification dispelled, it was impossible for them to be revived.

When the Zhang family saw this, they were overjoyed. Zhang Chunqiu secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He had also been gambling, but thankfully, he had won.

“Thankfully, I didn’t fail.” Zhou Wen didn’t continue digging because if he continued digging, he would have to use Truth Listener when he reached Ghost Hornless. This was something he didn’t wish to expose.

He could use Light Concealment in place of Invisibility Cloak to kill the Ghoul Mask, but Ghost Hornless needed Truth Listener’s help. The Invisibility Cloak was useless.

“My young friend, you saved our Zhang family from danger. I don’t know how to thank you. Come with me to retrieve the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg.” After Zhang Siyou said that, he said to Zhang Chunqiu, “Invite everyone back to have a rest. Don’t be negligent.”

“Yes,” Zhang Chunqiu answered.

Zhang Siyou took Zhou Wen back to Celestial Master Manor. When they arrived, he waited for him to take his seat before saying, “My young friend, you still have something to say, right?”

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He never expected Zhang Siyou to see that he had something to say. Without any hesitation, he said, “I’ve already said before that apart from Ba, there are two dimensional creatures in the Fiend Tomb. Now, only one has been eliminated. There’s still one below. If we don’t eliminate it, I’m afraid the Zhang family’s problem won’t be completely resolved.”

“Young friend, you didn’t attack immediately. You must have some scruples?” Zhang Siyou said.

“It’s not difficult to eliminate that dimensional creature, but I need some special Companion Beasts. I don’t want too many people to see my Companion Beasts, so I hope that you can permit me to head to the Fiend Tomb alone. If you are worried, you can watch from the side. I just hope that there won’t be a third person present,” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s not a problem, and there’s no need for me to be present. I’ll get Chunqiu to accompany you later. Other than you and Chunqiu, no one else will know about this matter. Even I won’t ask too much.” Zhang Siyou paused before continuing, “However, there’s something I hope you can help the Zhang family keep secret.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Please speak, Celestial Master,” Zhou Wen said.

“Since you can see through the Fiend patterns, it’s very likely that Ba is a Guardian. I hope no one else knows that Ba is a Guardian,” Zhang Siyou said.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He never expected Zhang Siyou to request this, but he still agreed. “I can guarantee that this matter will never be spread from me.”

Zhang Siyou understood Zhou Wen’s underlying meaning and nodded. “That’s good. If the Zhang family were to spread the news, it would be the Zhang family’s life on the line.”

After Zhang Siyou called Zhang Chunqiu over, he got him to accompany Zhou Wen to the Fiend Tomb again.

After the two of them left, Uncle Zhang walked over. “Celestial Master, why did you do that? Since we’ve already decided to dig up the Fiend Tomb, why don’t we do it ourselves? Why did you hand our fate over to an outsider?”

Zhang Siyou poured him a cup of tea and slowly said, “Brother, why has our Zhang family been able to prosper for so many years? It’s not because our Companion Beasts are more powerful than others, nor is it because our Zhang family is powerful enough. It’s because we see further than others, think more than others, and take fewer detours than others.”

“In this era, resources might be important, but the importance of information and knowledge is sometimes even more important than resources. Just like Zhou Wen. He can see through the Fiend Tomb and discover the information inside. If we were to do it ourselves, although we might succeed, we might have to pay a huge price. There’s no need to do so.” Zhang Siyou paused before continuing, “Besides, don’t you think this outcome is better than expected for us to hand the Earth Elemental Beast to someone who isn’t from the six families?”

Uncle Zhang was taken aback before saying, “That’s true. However, Zhou Wen is really impressive. Even Old Master Xia was defeated by him. Now that he has the Earth Elemental Beast, I’m afraid...”

“Now that the Guardians have all appeared, it’s hard to predict what will happen in the future. However, do you still remember the last part of the ancestral Celestial Master’s last words?” Zhang Siyou said with a strange expression.

“You mean that we might have a chance...” Uncle Zhang didn’t dare continue as though there was some taboo.

“Let’s take it one step at a time. Our generation is already old, so we don’t have the chance to take another step forward. However, Chunqiu and the others are different. Perhaps they still have hope,” Zhang Siyou said indifferently.

...

Zhou Wen and Zhang Chunqiu arrived at the Fiend Tomb again. Zhang Chunqiu brought the Celestial Master Token and got the Zhang family guarding the area to temporarily retreat.

“I’ll leave this place to you. I’ll come back after the matter is done,” Zhang Chunqiu said as he left.

The Zhang family sure is straightforward. They actually didn’t leave a single person behind, Zhou Wen thought to himself. Such a decision wasn’t something anyone could make. After all, it concerned the life and death of the family. No one would be at ease leaving it in the hands of an outsider, but the Zhang family had chosen to do so.
