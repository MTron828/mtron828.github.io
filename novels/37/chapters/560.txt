Chapter 561 Competition for the Pollen

A plant-type dimensional creature? Zhou Wen noticed that the flower didn’t show any abnormal reaction. It didn’t react to anything the Banana Fairy did. He found the plant-type dimensional creature rather strange.

When Zhou Wen saw Banana Fairy enjoying the pollen, he wondered if he should get some flower pollen to give it a try, but that was when he suddenly heard a strange sound nearby.

Zhou Wen looked around and his expression changed slightly. He saw that in the nearby forest, snakes, insects, rats, and ants were all approaching.

Zhou Wen recognized rats, caterpillars, venomous snakes, and centipedes. However, there were many insects that he didn’t know at all.

These weren’t likely to be real dimensional creatures. Most of them were ordinary creatures in the forest. Some of them were mutated creatures, but they were still a little far from the level of dimensional creatures. They could only be considered mortal.

The snakes, insects, rats, and ants struggled to crawl over. They all rushed towards the huge red flower. As they stepped over each other, many of them either got injured or died.

However, they still charged at the red flower as if they were possessed. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Is it the fragrance of the red flower that attracted them? Zhou Wen thought.

Many insects flew over, but before they could reach the red flower, even more terrifying creatures appeared. They scared the snakes, insects, rats, and ants away. However, the former were unwilling to leave. They loitered around the area.

A caterpillar coruscating with blue light crawled out of the forest. When the ants saw it, they immediately hid far away. They would rather squeeze together and trample on each other than get near it.

Even the temptation of the floral fragrance didn’t stop them from fearing the blue-light-emitting caterpillar.

Another break-out creature. Is there a dimensional zone nearby? When Zhou Wen looked up, he realized that another dimensional creature had appeared. It was a butterfly that was as large as a crane. Its body and wings were golden in color. As it flew, it scattered golden specks of light and dust. It was rather eye-catching in the dark night as though it was dancing in a golden galaxy.

However, when the golden dust landed on the snakes, insects, rats, and ants, they all died immediately. Their bodies also turned a faint golden color.

Both the blue-light-emitting caterpillar and the gold-dust butterfly rushed toward the red flower. Clearly, their target was the same.

Banana Fairy, who was enjoying the pollen, saw the gold-dust butterfly and blue-light-emitting caterpillar rushing over. She reached out and grabbed her banana leaf before fanning at them.

The terrifying Grand Yin Wind immediately sent the two flying. However, they remained uninjured, so they quickly rushed over again.

The gold-dust butterfly swooped down at the red flower from the sky. The gold-dust on its body constantly scattered. Unfortunately, it met Banana Fairy and with a wave of her hand, the gold-dust along with the butterfly was sent flying.

Wherever the blue-light-emitting caterpillar crawled, the leaves and soil burned, leaving a blue trail on the ground. However, the blue mark did not seem like a real flame.

However, it shared the same outcome. Before it even approached the red flower, it was blown away by Banana Fairy.

Banana Fairy’s Grand Yin Wind was extremely powerful. The two dimensional creatures were sent flying, but didn’t suffer any serious injuries. They quickly crawled back, shocking Zhou Wen.

Banana Fairy stuffed flower pollen into her mouth as she waved the banana leaf at the two of them. She didn’t allow them to approach the red flower. Clearly, she was afraid that they would snatch the flower pollen from her.

When Zhou Wen saw that the blue-light-emitting caterpillar and the gold-dust butterfly weren’t a threat to Banana Fairy, he didn’t take action and just watched from the side.

Apart from those two dimensional creatures, no other dimensional creatures appeared. Instead, it was the ordinary snakes, bugs, rats, and ants. No one was willing to leave, but they didn’t dare approach. They just watched helplessly from the side.

The butterfly and the caterpillar tried to charge forward many times, but they were blown back by the Grand Yin Wind. However, they still did not give up and continued charging forward.

It seemed a little boring. After a while, Zhou Wen yawned, feeling a little sleepy.

Just as he was thinking about whether he should go back and take a nap, he suddenly felt that something was amiss. Sweeping his gaze over, he saw that many of the snakes, insects, rats, and ants were lying there motionless as if they were dead.

The insects that were flying in the air also staggered and fell from the sky.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that they weren’t really dead. They were just asleep.

Something’s wrong... Could it be the floral fragrance... Zhou Wen immediately realized the problem.

Zhou Wen hurriedly stopped breathing. Indeed, he felt much less sleepy.

From the looks of it, there is poison in the floral fragrance. Thankfully, my Poison stat is high enough, so I didn’t fall asleep like those snakes, insects, rats, and ants. Zhou Wen saw that Banana Fairy, the butterfly, and the caterpillar weren’t affected by the floral fragrance and were still warring for the flower pollen.

The ordinary creatures around them had all fallen to the ground and were asleep.

Although Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of the floral fragrance, he felt bored. He drew his saber and slashed at the blue-light-emitting caterpillar and the gold-dust butterfly, killing them.

The gold-dust butterfly didn’t leave anything behind, but the blue-light-emitting caterpillar rolled out a sapphire-like bead. It was a Companion Egg.

I never expected my luck to be so good. Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped at the blue-light-emitting caterpillar’s Companion Egg.

Netherworld Caterpillar: Epic

Life Providence: Netherworld Envoy

Life Soul: Netherworld Poison

Strength: 26

Speed: 28

Constitution: 27

Essence Energy: 40

Talent Skill: Myriad Poisons Augmentation

Companion Form: Pill

These stats are rather interesting. Zhou Wen looked at its stats. It was an Epic creature with three attributes that didn’t reach 30 points, but its Essence Energy stat was maxed out.

Furthermore, its companion form was something he had never seen before. After some thought, Zhou Wen picked up the Companion Egg and hatched it before turning it into its companion form.

Soon, a blue lotus seed-like pill appeared in Zhou Wen’s hand. It looked like a blue medicine pill. It looked beautiful, but Zhou Wen didn’t know what effects it would have if he ate it.

What’s the use of this thing? I wonder if I can feed it to other dimensional creatures and poison them to death? Zhou Wen stored away the pill and planned on giving it a try when he had the chance.

Banana Fairy was about to finish all the flower pollen. Her stomach swelled. However, she didn’t have any intention of stopping. She only stopped when she had finished all the flower pollen and then she returned to Zhou Wen’s side.

The next morning at dawn, the morning sun shone on the red flower. The flower instantly withered at a speed visible to the naked eye. It didn’t take long before it turned into ashes on the ground and was gone, leaving behind a red crystal.
