Trajectory God Power Crystal: A product of the God of Trajectory’s blood essence. Absorbing it will enhance one’s bloodline. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Seeing that there was no problem with the game’s judgment, Zhou Wen allowed the blood-colored avatar to absorb the Trajectory God Power Crystal.

As the black power was absorbed by the blood-colored avatar, its stats changed once again. His Speed stat also increased to 21 points, and in the end, it revealed the word “Trajectory.”

The Trajectory Holy Temple really increases Speed. It’s quite a coincidence. Zhou Wen was secretly amused. Although he had previously believed that the Trajectory Holy Temple corresponded to Speed, the situation inside the temple was completely different from what he had imagined. Therefore, Zhou Wen was surprised that the Trajectory God Power Crystal could increase Speed.

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan asked Ah Lai more questions, but the latter really seemed to have forgotten many things. He only remembered that he had come from Langya Town, his father was a sailor, and that he had followed his father onto the ship after he graduated from high school. Later, he encountered a storm at sea, and he couldn’t remember what happened after that.

Zhou Wen had some doubts about Ah Lai and planned on figuring out his origins after taking him out.

However, before that, he had to wait until the end of the Holy Land’s trials.

Zhou Wen had originally wanted to head to the other temples to obtain their God Power Crystals to raise his four stats to 21 points.

But when they arrived at a few other temples, they realized that they had already completely closed. Clearly, the God Power Crystal had been taken away by someone else.

There are indeed hidden dragons and crouching tigers in the League. In just a few days, the God Power Crystals have been snatched away. Zhou Wen was somewhat worried about Li Xuan.

If the Connate Infinite physique was taken away, Li Xuan would have zero hope left.

As he was deep in thought, he suddenly heard the sound of thunder coming from the sky. The wind and clouds stirred as if a hole had collapsed in the sky, forming a huge vortex.

Zhou Wen’s body involuntarily flew towards the vortex. He could see other people flying around the Holy Land and being sucked into the vortex.

Zhou Wen didn’t resist the suction force of the vortex as he allowed himself to fly into it. He even patted Li Xuan’s shoulder.

There was only one possibility of such a situation. The God Power Crystals of the six holy temples had been taken away by others. It was why everything had ended ahead of time, opening up a passageway to leave the Holy Land.

However, Li Xuan didn’t mind. “Since I couldn’t obtain it, it means that I wasn’t destined to get it. It’s no big deal even if I don’t have any special physiques. With my Immortal God of Combat Life Providence, I can still forge my own path. The world is my

oyster.”

“You’re right. It might not be a bad thing not having a special physique.” Zhou Wen had a nagging feeling that the six holy temples were somewhat odd.

“Alright, don’t console me. I’ve suffered too much since I was young. Such a trivial matter isn’t enough to make me depressed.” Li Xuan believed Zhou Wen was consoling him.

Zhou Wen didn’t explain. After all, everyone wanted a special physique, and he didn’t have any evidence and was speculating without any grounds. It was pointless explaining.

Together with Ah Lai, the trio flew towards the vortex and arrived near it. They happened to see Pros being sucked up as well. In turn, he glared at Zhou Wen.

“Zhou Wen, don’t be too happy. This matter isn’t over yet.” As he spoke, he was sucked into the vortex.

Zhou Wen and company were also sucked in. Soon, they returned to the stone altar from before.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to take Ah Lai elsewhere to check his identity, but he discovered that many young people had yet to leave the altar. Instead, they surrounded it, clearly targeting him and Li Xuan.

“Why are you crowding here? Hurry up and move aside. Do you want to fight here?” Li Xuan said with a twitch of his lips.

They could do whatever they wanted in the Holy Land, but now that they were out, they would be bound by the League’s laws.

Although the six families enjoyed special privileges, they did not have the privilege to openly challenge a representative of the An family here.

“Lance, it’s him.” No one bothered with Li Xuan. John pointed at Zhou Wen and said to Lance.

“You are Zhou Wen?” Lance looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.

“Your name is Lance?” Zhou Wen was surprised as well. Before coming, Jiang Yan had warned him that the only person he needed to be afraid of was someone named Lance.

“Did you cripple their Primordial Energy seas?” Lance asked Zhou Wen.

“Yes, but they were the ones who initiated it.” Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on explaining, but after taking a glance at Lance, he still decided to explain.

Lance nodded. “Actually, that’s not important. I want to fight with you. Choose the venue and time.”

“Because I’m the representative of the An family?” Zhou Wen knew that Lance cultivated because of his goal of defeating An Tianzuo.

“Not for anyone else. Just because you are Zhou Wen. Apart from An Tianzuo, you are the second person that has intrigued me. I didn’t plan on taking action back when they asked for my help, but since you are Zhou Wen, I’m interested in fighting you,” said Lance.

“But I don’t wish to fight with you. Fighting is troublesome,” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.

He wasn’t a battle maniac like Feng Qiuyan. He wasn’t interested in a meaningless fight. It was time that Zhou Wen could use to game.

“Fight me. No matter who wins or loses, I’ll ensure that you leave the Holy City safely. If not, you will ultimately be in trouble. Those guys won’t let you off easily. Compared to fighting me, those guys will delay your gaming time more, right?” Lance suddenly came close to Zhou Wen and whispered in his ear with a voice that only he could hear.

“It looks like I can’t reject it, but the time and place is up to me to choose,” Zhou Wen said with a shrug.

Lance’s words were half-truths, but there was one thing he was right about. Those from the six families definitely wouldn’t let this matter rest. Their best chance was in Holy City, so it was impossible for them to allow Zhou Wen to leave so easily.

Although Zhou Wen didn’t expect Lance to really allow him to leave, stalling for time gave Ah Sheng time to prepare.

“You can choose any time and place in the next two days,” said Lance.

“Lance, two days is way too long...” John turned anxious as he was afraid Zhou Wen would take the opportunity to escape.

However, Lance only smiled and said, “He won’t run, so don’t worry.”

“There’s no need for two days. Let’s do it tomorrow afternoon. I still want to make an early return after the fight,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright, where will it be?” Lance asked.

“I’ll inform you when the time comes.” Zhou Wen didn’t answer directly. He planned on getting Ah Sheng to choose the location. With Ah Sheng’s abilities, he would definitely be able to choose a suitable spot.
