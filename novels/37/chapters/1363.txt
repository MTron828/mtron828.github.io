Chapter 1364: Evil is One Thought Away From Good

Translator: CKtalon

“Follow the plan,” Wei Ge ordered expressionlessly.

“Yes.” A few Censors from the bureau carefully walked towards the tower.

Hermit and Cave Era watched from the side. Only after the Censors entered the tower did Cave Era look at Wei Ge and say, “Director-General Wei, those are likely the capable generals of the bureau, right? If they were to die here, the bureau would probably suffer heavy losses.”

Wei Ge said respectfully, “Your Excellency, you are reading too much into it. As a Censor, they understand the Federation’s need for sacrifices. Furthermore, I’m very confident in my subordinates. They will definitely return safely.”

Cave Era and Hermit exchanged looks and didn’t say anything else.

In fact, they knew very well that it was impossible for the Censors to return. They were offerings to begin with. Only with their sacrifices could the plan continue.

Wei Ge knew this very well, but in order to advance his Guardian, he would rather have his subordinates die. Furthermore, he didn’t even blink. It was as though the deaths of his subordinates were no different from the death of an ant.

Cave Era found it difficult to understand how such a cold, selfish, and cruel fellow could make all the inspectors follow him loyally. Furthermore, they obeyed his orders wholeheartedly.

Not long after, they heard tragic cries coming from the tower. A strange light lit up at the top of the strange tower.

“It’s finally here…” Hermit looked at the light at the top of the tower as excitement flashed in his eyes.

“Is that the legendary Heaven?” Wei Ge narrowed his eyes as he looked at the gradually glowing tower and muttered to himself. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Hermit nodded and said, “That’s right. That place is indeed Heaven. The empress used Devas to sense the land where Buddha is worshiped. It’s known as the place closest to Heaven. There are also people who call him the Skysplit Buddha.”

Wei Ge stared at Heaven and continued asking, “According to what I know, that empress is only an ordinary human. No matter how honorable her status was back then, she shouldn’t have become an existence like an immortal or Buddha, right?”

“An empress of the human world really doesn’t have the right to become a Mythical, much less be an existence that can reach the Calamity grade after death.” Hermit paused and said, “But the one in Heaven isn’t that empress.”

“Not the empress?” Wei Ge was slightly taken aback, his face filled with puzzlement.

Be it Capital of the Gods or Heaven, they were both unique to the empress. It was hard to believe that the owner of this place wasn’t her.

Apart from her, who else had the right to claim sovereignty in the Capital of the Gods and occupy Heaven?

As the two of them spoke, the light in Heaven intensified, almost enveloping the huge tower-like Heaven.

Hermit was in a good mood as he stared at Heaven and explained, “No matter how strong a human is, they are at most Legendary or Epic. It’s impossible for them to advance to the Mythical stage. That empress is also a human, so she naturally won’t be an exception. Furthermore, even if she becomes a Mythical, it’s impossible for her to live to this day, much less advance to the Calamity grade.”

When Wei Ge heard Hermit’s words, he looked at the light around Heaven. It seemed to stir something in him, but he had no intention of saying it.

Hermit saw Wei Ge’s expression and knew that he had guessed something. Therefore, he said, “Since you have already thought of something, say it out and let me see if you are right.”

Wei Ge pondered for a moment before saying, “I heard that there’s a Buddha statue in Dragon Gate Grotto named Lochana Buddha. It’s carved with the likeness of the empress.”

Hermit immediately laughed when he heard Wei Ge say that. “You are indeed a smart person. Losana means shining light, and the name that the empress gave herself has the word Zhao. It basically has the same meaning as Lochana.”

“So there’s really a Lochana Buddha in Heaven?” Wei Ge’s expression changed slightly.

If the person in heaven was really Lochana Buddha, it would be terrifying.

Buddha had three bodies, and Lochana Buddha was one of them. It was known as Reward Body Buddha, and it was an intelligent Buddha that signified absolute truth.

To put it in layman’s terms, the Lochana Buddha and the famous Gautama Buddha were two of the three Buddhas in one body. They could be considered one of the top Buddhas in Buddhism.

“Buddha has a benevolent heart. If it’s really Lochana Buddha, why would he need to use living people as a sacrifice?” Wei Ge felt that Hermit’s words were somewhat flawed.

“Director-General Wei, have you never heard of the saying that Buddha comes from the heart?” Hermit continued, “The so-called Buddha is a mirror, but this Buddha mirror reflects not a person but the heart. If you are kind-hearted, Buddha is good. If you are evil-hearted, Buddha is a hundred times more evil than you… Evil is just one thought away from good…”

Wei Ge said as though he had figured something out, “Therefore, if this Calamity creature were to appear peacefully, he might be a kind Buddha that won’t cause too much of a disaster?”

“That’s right,” Hermit said with a smile. “That’s naturally not what I want to see. Therefore, I got you to bring someone here to prevent him from becoming a kind Buddha. I need him to become a terrifying devil.”

As the two of them spoke, the Buddhistic glow in Heaven was so intense that it was unbearable to look at. There was a door opening, as though someone had walked out of Heaven.

Wei Ge focused his gaze. The person he discovered was a bhikkhuni wearing a white monk robe.

She walked over step by step as though cleansed the pure moonlight, she didn’t look like the devil Hermit had mentioned.

“She doesn’t look like a devil,” Wei Ge said as he looked at the bhikkhuni.

“Of course not. If she’s already a devil, we won’t be able to escape death,” Hermit said indifferently. “However, after she leaves the Capital of the Gods, she will definitely become a devil.”

“Why?” Wei Ge was even more puzzled.

“Because you are here.” Hermit laughed.

“Me?” Wei Ge was slightly taken aback.

Hermit looked at Wei Ge and said, “Yes, it’s you. If your heart is like Buddha, Buddha will be here. If your heart is like a devil, the devil will naturally descend into this world. If a person with a devil’s heart like Director-General Wei were to have an affinity with that bhikkhuni, she would definitely become a devil…”

“What do you need me to do?” Wei Ge asked.

“Nothing at all. All you need to do is wait for her to leave the Capital of the Gods and let her see you.”

Seeing Wei Ge’s confused expression, Hermit said with a smile, “You don’t understand? Then don’t bother thinking about it. When the time comes, you will naturally understand. Let’s wait for her outside the Capital of the Gods.”

Cave Era had already activated her temporal powers to take Wei Ge and Hermit out of the Capital of the Gods.

As for the bhikkhuni, she continued walking forward slowly.. Wherever she passed, the ghost-like ancient soldiers turned back to dust as though they had been liberated.
