Chapter 894: Ancient Sovereign Advancement

Translator: CKtalon

Bam! Bam!

The clash of fists and flesh, the clash of blood and fire.

Zhou Wen and Li Xuan seemed to be nailed to the ground. Their legs didn’t move, but their arms flailed wildly as they punched each other’s faces and chests.

Feng Qiuyan, Sadie, and company felt their hearts turn cold. This wasn’t a battle, but a life-and-death battle. Those who didn’t know better would think that Zhou Wen and Li Xuan had a deep grudge.

“Coach seems to be using his weakness to fight President’s advantage. Why is he doing this?” Feng Qiuyan frowned in thought.

Sadie said, “He probably wants to take a final gamble, right? His stamina and strength are declining. If he were to fight under normal circumstances, he would have to admit defeat after his stamina and strength drop drastically. Therefore, he needs to make the final impact before that happens, in a bid to reverse the situation.”

Feng Qiuyan shook his head and said, “That’s not right. There’s no chance of turning the situation around with such a desperate attempt. Coach wouldn’t make such a foolish decision. He definitely has his reasons.”

“His injuries are getting worse, but Li Xuan’s injuries have automatically healed. Furthermore, such injuries will only make Li Xuan’s Life Soul carapace stronger. I really can’t tell what other chances Coach has. He can only reverse the situation by using external forces like Companion Beasts.” Sadie had the Eye of Odin’s ability to see the situation clearly.

Although Zhou Wen’s body was powerful, his injuries weren’t light after suffering so many blows. However, he still had no intention of retreating as he continued attacking Li Xuan crazily.

Just a little more... Why can’t I advance yet... What’s the difference...

Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the Defy Ancient Sovereign in his body was like a volcano that was about to erupt due to the accumulation of the excess vital essence. However, for some reason, the energy just didn’t erupt which prevented the Defy Ancient Sovereign from completing its final evolution.

Why? What went wrong? The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General can constantly accumulate and burn using killing intent and flames, making him constantly become stronger. Why can’t the accumulation of vital essence push the Defy Ancient Sovereign to evolve? What’s the difference? As Zhou Wen fought, he thought hard.

Crack!

Cracks appeared on Zhou Wen’s ribs as blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth. Even his organs began to rupture as fine cracks appeared. Blood was seeping out.

“Think of a way to make them stop. If this continues, Zhou Wen’s body won’t be able to withstand it.” Sadie could tell that Zhou Wen’s injuries were already rather serious. If this continued, it would be troublesome if his organs shattered.

“They can’t be serious, right? At such a time, President should be the one stopping, right? Could it be that President is really angry?” Gulli said.

Feng Qiuyan shook his head and said, “Impossible. President isn’t that kind of person. There must be a reason for not stopping.”

“His opponent is already so injured, but he still isn’t stopping. I really can’t think of a reason,” Gulli said.

“Pressure,” Gu Dian, who usually didn’t speak much, suddenly said.

“What?” Sadie and company didn’t hear Gu Dian clearly.

“Pressure,” Gu Dian repeated, but he had no intention of explaining.

This time, Sadie and Gulli heard it clearly, but they didn’t understand what Gu Dian meant.

“I understand. That’s right. It’s pressure...” Feng Qiuyan’s eyes lit up as he said in appreciation.

“What do you mean?” Gulli asked Feng Qiuyan in puzzlement.

Feng Qiuyan looked at Zhou Wen in battle and said, “Coach wants to break through. He wants to fight President using his weakness. That’s because he wants to surpass himself. He wants to make up for his flaws and become stronger. He wants to break through his shackles under pressure... President clearly understands this, so he’s trying his best to exert pressure on Coach...”

“Is that so? But from the looks of it, Coach will be beaten to death if this continues...” Gulli looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief.

Sadie also found it difficult to accept Feng Qiuyan’s explanation. Everyone had their own traits and weaknesses. No one could be perfect. To forcefully use their weakness to fight, could one really break through under heavy pressure? Sadie had great doubts about this.

“Coach should be able to do it,” Feng Qiuyan said matter-of-factly while he was inwardly considering: What’s my weakness? Should I try to break through my weakness?

If Zhou Wen knew what Feng Qiuyan was thinking, he would definitely be at a loss whether to laugh or cry.

He only wanted his Life Soul to advance to a Perfect Body. How could he think of any weakness to break through? With that time, he might as well farm more powerful Companion Beasts.

Zhou Wen wasn’t a perfectionist, nor had he ever thought of making himself perfect.

Why isn’t it working... What’s wrong? Zhou Wen clearly felt that the Defy Ancient Sovereign’s vital essence was about to erupt, but it just didn’t do so.

Zhou Wen carefully thought through the similarities and differences between the Defy Ancient Sovereign and the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General and constantly compared the differences between the two. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, an idea flashed in Zhou Wen’s mind. Yes, I’m lacking a catalyst. The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General uses flames to ignite killing intent to use it to burn Fiend Armor. No matter how much vital essence the Defy Ancient Sovereign gathers, it lacks a catalyst to ignite the vital essence, so it’s unable to convert it into an effective energy to push the Defy Ancient Sovereign to evolve... A catalyst... What do I use as a catalyst... to ignite the Defy Ancient Sovereign’s vital essence?

Although the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was inclined towards the fire element, it was in essence not the power of fire, but the fire of life. It was still somewhat different from pure fire-elemental powers.

From the looks of it, the fire of life wasn’t enough to act as a catalyst. It could even be said that the heat wasn’t strong enough.

The Defy Ancient Sovereign... Ancient Sovereign Sutra... Ancient Sovereign... Zhou Wen suddenly recalled that The Thearch had once mentioned that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra was an Essence Energy Art of the Human Sovereign. It was an Essence Energy Art that was impossible to advance to the Mythical stage because there was no path ahead for humans. Even the head of the Three Sovereigns, Suirenshi, was unable to defy the heavens and change his fate of making the Ancient Sovereign Sutra break through to the Mythical stage.

Defy... So that’s how it is... If I don’t have the determination to defy the heavens and change my fate... How can I fight against the heavens... The Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul in Zhou Wen’s body emitted a glow like the sun, making the glow on Zhou Wen’s body grow stronger.

Boom!

The light suddenly converged, and shortly after it converged, it quickly exploded. The terrifying light instantly devoured the entire training grounds, temporarily blinding everyone’s eyes.
