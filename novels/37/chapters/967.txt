Chapter 968: Unexpected Gain

Translator: CKtalon

The two Ice Silkworms stuck to the Sea Dragon King’s body. The Sea Dragon King immediately shivered and his actions became unnatural as he struggled to get the Ice Silkworms off him.

However, the Crab Sovereign held onto its head tightly. The Sea Dragon King was momentarily unable to escape, so its body became increasingly stiff.

What powerful Ice Silkworms. Zhou Wen could see with his naked eye that frost was spreading on the Sea Dragon King’s scales. The Sea Dragon King’s body was turning stiffer.

Before long, the gigantic Sea Dragon King lost its combat ability. It was as though it was in hibernation as its body froze.

Indeed, it’s better to have a restraining effect when killing monsters. Zhou Wen didn’t even need to attack. As the Sea Dragon King couldn’t retaliate, the Crab Sovereign finished it off.

The two Ice Silkworms were still stuck to the Sea Snake King’s body. The blood in the Sea Snake King’s body had already frozen. After a while, the Crab Sovereign’s two giant pincers finally split the Sea Snake King’s body into two, but he only found a stat crystal.

“How stingy. He didn’t even drop a Companion Egg,” Li Xuan said gloomily.

“How can Companion Eggs drop so easily?” Zhou Wen was already used to it. After putting away the stat crystal, he glanced at the bottomless blue hole and thought for a moment. “Since we’re here, let’s go down and take a look.”

The Crab Sovereign led the three of them deeper into the blue hole. There were many sea snakes around, but with the Crab Emperor’s gravity bubble opening up a path for them, no sea snake could approach them.

“This blue hole is so deep. I’m afraid it’s about to reach the other side of Earth.” After diving for a while, the Crab Sovereign still failed to reach the bottom of the blue hole.

The blue hole seemed bottomless. They had dived so deep that even the sea snakes didn’t appear again.

Most of the sea snakes lived in snake caves on the rock walls, but at this depth, even the snake caves couldn’t be seen.

“There seems to be something down there?” Li Xuan leaned on the Crab Sovereign and looked down as though he had seen something.

Zhou Wen also looked over and indeed, he saw a swath of crystalline jade-blue below, as though the crystal cave was glowing.

However, even crystals needed light to show any reflection. It was naturally impossible for light to exist in such a deep sea. The glowing crystals were definitely extraordinary.

As the Crab Sovereign dived deeper, the blue light gradually became clearer. Only then did the two realize that it was a thick glacier.

“That’s strange. Isn’t the Sea Dragon King afraid of the cold? Why would it live in such a cold place?” Li Xuan asked in puzzlement.

“There must be a reason. Perhaps the secret is in the glacier. The ice definitely wouldn’t glow by itself. There might be something inside,” Zhou Wen said as he sized up the glacier.

“Could it be a snake egg produced by the Sea Dragon King? If it’s a snake egg, perhaps I can tame it like a Gu.” Li Xuan reached his hand into the water and touched the glacier. He was immediately given a fright. The glacier was extremely cold. Just touching it nearly froze his fingers.

“The Sea Dragon King is so afraid of the cold, so how can it lay its eggs here? At such a low temperature, I don’t think the Sea Dragon King would dare approach because of the cold, right?” Zhou Wen ordered the Crab Sovereign to dig the ice.

The Crab Sovereign was very resistant to cold. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, it brandished its huge crab pincers and quickly cracked open the glacier.

More and more ice blocks were dug out as Zhou Wen and company finally saw what was glowing with blue light.

“Is that a tooth? The Sea Dragon King’s tooth?” The thing that emitted blue light from the glacier was a meter-long blue tooth that looked like it was carved from ice.

“It’s obviously not.” Zhou Wen got the Crab Sovereign to grab the tooth. After grabbing it, he immediately felt a chill from the tooth. Almost instantly, Zhou Wen’s hands froze.

Clang!

Zhou Wen hurriedly threw the tooth onto the Crab Sovereign’s back and couldn’t help but be alarmed. With his physical strength and Essence Energy, ice immediately formed on him. The coldness emitted from the tooth was no less than a strike from a Mythical creature.

“Could this thing be...” Zhou Wen thought of a possibility.

“What is it?” Li Xuan asked.

“Typical dimensional creatures, even Mythical creatures, will rot and disintegrate after death. Only a very small number of corpses can be stored for a long period of time, but it’s impossible for them to maintain the strength back when they were alive—unless it’s the corpse of a Terror-grade creature. A body in its Terror form can preserve Terror-grade power. It won’t rot and disintegrate so easily,” Zhou Wen said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“In that case, this is a tooth of a Terror form? What kind of creature is it? It can’t be the Seven Seas Dragon King’s, right?” Li Xuan said.

Zhou Wen looked at the tooth and said, “It’s not impossible. The Sea Dragon King is clearly afraid of the cold, but there’s such a tooth here. I think it’s unlikely that the Sea Dragon King placed it here. Perhaps the Seven Seas Dragon King placed it here to suppress it.”

“Who cares who placed it? Since it’s good stuff, let’s take it. What do you think this thing is for? Can it be made into a weapon?” Li Xuan said.

“I don’t know. I don’t know much about the Terror grade. I just heard that it is the true Mythical stage. Perhaps the materials obtained from a Terror-grade creature are useful.” Zhou Wen put on the Dragon Scale Armor and forcefully threw the ice-blue tooth into the Chaos Bead.

Although it only took a short period of time, the dragon scales on his hands had produced a layer of frost.

He got Crab Sovereign to dig deeper into the glacier, but it didn’t find anything. This wasn’t unexpected because other than the tooth, there was no more glow in the glacier.

Seeing that there was nothing else in the blue hole, Zhou Wen ordered Crab Sovereign to lead them out.

“Where are we going next?” Li Xuan asked.

“Let’s go to Evil Dragon Island. I heard from Miya that there’s a dragon monarch that looks like a crocodile there. Its defense and combat strength are extremely shocking. Furthermore, it’s not afraid of the cold. The Ice Silkworm will be useless this time, but I’ve already thought of a way to kill it. It shouldn’t be difficult,” Zhou Wen said as he ordered Crab Sovereign to head towards Evil Dragon Island.

No human dared to approach such an island. Even the great devils overseas wouldn’t casually enter such a place.

Using Miya’s information, Zhou Wen and company easily found Evil Dragon Island and Dragon King.

It indeed looked like a crocodile, but it wasn’t completely like a crocodile. Its body was much longer than a crocodile, and it had horns on its head. It could barely be considered a dragon.

Miya had explained that the dragon was afraid of poison. Zhou Wen secretly used the Invisibility Cloak and stabbed it in the eye. When it opened its mouth in pain, he threw the poisonous hair formed from Fatal Temptation into its mouth.

Soon, the Evil Dragon died. There was nothing there when they tore open its corpse.

“This fellow is even stingier than the previous one,” Li Xuan said as his eyes suddenly lit up. “Old Zhou, do you think there’s a tooth here?”
