Chapter 970: Galaxy Shell Dragon

Translator: CKtalon

A Companion Egg has finally dropped! Zhou Wen was delighted as he hurriedly picked it up. Then, he used the mysterious phone to read its information.

Galaxy Shell Dragon: Mythical

Life Providence: Unbreakable

Life Soul: Astral Array

Wheel of Destiny: Absolute Defense

Strength: 80

Speed: 80

Constitution: 81

Essence Energy: 80

Talent Skill: Deathwater Domain, Dragon Head Raising, Ghost Armor

Companion Form: Armor

One attribute is actually 81! Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. Unless it was some excellent-grade Mythical Companion Beast, it was impossible for it to have a stat reach 81 points.

The Galaxy Shell Dragon actually had one stat reach 81. This meant that it had broken through its limits in a particular aspect. It was considered an excellent-grade Mythical Companion Beast.

Zhou Wen looked at its stats and abilities and was very curious about the Absolute Defense ability. He had previously seen Tyrant Behemoth’s Absolute Strength amongst the Absolute series for Wheels of Destiny.

The Wheel of Destiny of the Galaxy Shell Dragon was very similar to Tyrant Behemoth’s. It was unknown if it had the same level of might.

There was nothing else to say. It looked like a defensive Companion Beast. Now that Zhou Wen had Dragon Scale Armor, he didn’t have much need for defensive Mythical Companion Beasts.

However, Zhou Wen still hatched it and summoned it in its armor form. He wanted to see if this pure defensive Companion Beast armor had higher defense.

When the armor appeared on Zhou Wen, he couldn’t help but be surprised.

A translucent blue armor that shimmered with nebulous starlight appeared on Zhou Wen’s body, tightly enveloping him. It accentuated his slender and muscular figure, making him look like a god surrounded by starlight.

Ignoring its defense, just the appearance of the armor is far better than the Dragon Scale Armor. Zhou Wen still remembered about the Terror creature’s material, so he searched the vicinity while wearing the armor.

The dimensional creatures at the bottom of the sea rushed forward. Zhou Wen wanted to test the strength of the armor, so he didn’t fight back and allowed them to attack.

The ordinary dimensional creatures couldn’t injure the armor at all. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

From the looks of it, I have to fight a Mythical creature to know how strong this armor’s defense is. Zhou Wen searched the vicinity for a while and indeed found the ice block.

After digging open the ice, he discovered a damaged scale. Like the materials from before, it was extremely cold. Zhou Wen stored it in the chaos space.

After leaving the Deathwater Zone, Li Xuan and Ya’er were still waiting for him outside. The three of them continued on their journey.

“I found another scale. All the dragon monarchs have the same material. I’m wondering if Miya has something like that,” Zhou Wen said.

“Tooth, bone, hair, horn, and scale. The more I look at it, the more it looks like we are preparing to revive a divine dragon. When we gather the other two materials, can we summon a divine dragon and make a wish?” Li Xuan teased.

“There’s still the last dragon monarch. After we deal with this dragon monarch, we’ll go to Miya and ask her. She might know what these things are for.”

After a pause, Zhou Wen continued, “However, this dragon monarch is a little troublesome. She seems to be a mixed-blood with clam and dragon heritage. She’s known as a Dragon Granny, but she’s actually a clam lady with some dragon blood. However, her abilities are somewhat special. She can suck people into shells and trap them until they die. Furthermore, I heard that the Seven Seas Dragon King often lives with her. I’m afraid that we’ll encounter the Seven Seas Dragon King when we head there. It will be troublesome when that happens.”

“Then what should we do?” Li Xuan also knew that this wasn’t a joke. If they really encountered a Terror-grade Seven Seas Dragon King, they would die.

“Infinite Island where Dragon Granny lives is relatively close to the coast. Let’s head back now. Later, I’ll secretly sneak up to Infinite Island and take a look at the situation first.” Zhou Wen didn’t dare be careless.

“That’s the only way.” Li Xuan nodded as the three of them returned to the beach.

“Since we have to return, why don’t we go to Miya’s place and ask her what these materials are for?” Li Xuan was curious and couldn’t help himself.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen didn’t think that it would waste much time, so they took a detour to Sea God Reef.

This was the first time Li Xuan had seen the shrimp soldiers and crab generals. He felt very curious and said in puzzlement, “That’s strange. Why does Miya’s place look like the only place that resembles what a real dragon monarch should have? The other dragon monarchs are just a haphazard mob. They don’t look like something a dragon monarch should have. There aren’t even shrimp soldiers and crab generals.”

“I find it odd too. Perhaps Miya’s bloodline is really different. She’s indeed the creature that looks most like a dragon among the seven dragon monarchs,” Zhou Wen said.

When the two arrived at the beach, the shrimp soldiers and crab generals took them to the Dragon Palace.

In the Dragon Palace, not only did he see Miya, but he also saw Qin Ling standing beside her.

Li Xuan secretly observed and didn’t see Feng Qiuyan, so he didn’t mention the matter again. All he did was greet Qin Ling.

“Why are you back so quickly? Did you encounter trouble?” Miya didn’t mention Qin Ling and only asked Zhou Wen in puzzlement.

“We’ve already eliminated five dragon monarchs. Now, only Dragon Granny remains. We didn’t rashly head over because we were afraid of encountering the Seven Seas Dragon King at Dragon Granny’s place,” Zhou Wen said.

“You actually killed the Galaxy Shell Dragon and the rest so quickly?” Miya looked at Zhou Wen in disbelief.

“I did. Furthermore, I discovered something strange at the Sea Dragon King’s place, so I wanted to ask you if you know what it is.” Zhou Wen took out the tooth and placed it on the ground.

The ground in the cabin immediately froze. Furthermore, the frost was rapidly spreading throughout the cabin. The coldness in the tooth was too intense.

“This is... Dragon King’s Tooth?” Miya sized it up for a while before her expression gradually changed into surprise.

“Are you saying that this is the tooth of the Seven Seas Dragon King?” Zhou Wen asked.

Miya shook her head. “It’s not from the Seven Seas Dragon King. I heard that there was a true dragon in the Seven Dragons Sea to begin with. After the Seven Seas Dragon King came, he killed that true dragon and became ruler of the Seven Dragons Sea. However, these are only legends. I didn’t believe it at first, but now that I see this tooth, I believe it a little. This is clearly a dragon’s tooth after its Terror transformation. Otherwise, it would be impossible for it to be preserved. In the entire Seven Dragons Sea, other than the Seven Seas Dragon King, only a legendary true dragon can reach the Terror grade. Furthermore, according to legend, it’s an ice-elemental true dragon.”

“I see.” Zhou Wen looked at Miya and asked, “We discovered some items at the other dragon monarchs’ lairs. Don’t tell me you have something from the true dragon?”

Miya shook her head and said, “Perhaps, but I’ve never seen it before. The Dragon Palace in Sea God Reef wasn’t here originally. During the battle between my father and the Seven Seas Dragon King, the original Dragon Palace was destroyed, so I moved here. If you are interested, I can take you to the original Dragon Palace.”
