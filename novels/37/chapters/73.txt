Chapter 74 Dimensional Forum

After Fang Ruoxi and Tian Xiangdong had finished matriculation and were taken to their dorms, Zhou Wen returned to his. He wasn’t too interested in such activities.

Just as he reached Four Seasons Garden, he saw a few students walking in with their luggage in tow. Clearly, the special admissions students had arrived and were beginning to move in.

Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in them. He naturally didn’t care what they looked like. He walked to the row of buildings at the back of Four Seasons Garden with his head bowed.

Just as he reached the last row, he saw a girl standing in front of the other building, opening the door with her dorm key.

“Hello there. My name is Wang Lu. You live next door, right? We will be neighbors in the future,” the girl greeted Zhou Wen in a friendly manner.

“I’m Zhou Wen.” Zhou Wen replied before entering his dorm.

This guy is odd. As expected of special admissions students. Do all of them have such a character? Wang Lu was curious.

Zhou Wen returned to his room and used his phone to enter Ant Nest.

Previously, he had encountered a bottleneck at Ant Nest. After entering, his strength hadn’t allowed him to progress deeper. Now with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant evolving to an adult state, he planned on giving it another try.

Ant City was identical to before. It looked mysterious and bizarre. The ants were coming in and out of their nests and many of the black-winged flying ants were flying around.

He controlled the blood-colored avatar and stayed far away from the City, sending Silver-Winged Flying Ant to fly over alone.

The adult Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s stats made it a pinnacle existence among Legendary Companion Beasts. With a flap of its four wings, it flew directly towards Ant City.

The black-winged flying ants immediately discovered it and rushed at it while flapping their black wings. The black swarm looked rather frightening.

The Silver-Winged Flying Ant moved like lightning as it used its stinger to shoot Magical Needle, tearing through the head of the black-winged flying ant that charged headfirst. It then plummeted.

The Silver-Winged Flying Ant didn’t stop as it shot into the ant swarm like a silver bolt of lightning

‘Killed Black-Winged Soldier Ant. Discovered dimensional crystal.’

Zhou Wen saw a dimensional crystal drop due to the black-winged flying ant’s death, but he was unable to pick it up due to the distance. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If the blood-colored avatar were to rush into the Ant City’s vicinity, it would suffer an attack. With his present strength, it would be difficult for him to survive the black-winged flying ant swarm.

He kept watching as chimes kept ringing. Many dimensional crystals dropped, but Zhou Wen didn’t dare pick them up. He felt quite depressed as a result.

The Silver-Winged Flying Ant could hardly move amidst the black-winged flying ant swarm. Although he slew a lot, there were just too many of them. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant was constantly in peril with the chances of it being overwhelmed by the ant swarm at any time.

Damn it. There are too many ants and they are Legendary creatures. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant can’t rush in at all. Zhou Wen thought of getting the Silver-Winged Flying Ant to rush out, but it was already too late. Surrounded, it could only fight the black-winged flying ants that inundated it, the injuries it suffered increasing.

Ding!

Another black-winged flying ant was killed, dropping a black-winged flying ant dimensional crystal-a black-winged flying ant’s Primordial Energy Skill Crystal.

I’ll risk it! Zhou Wen looked at the copious numbers of dimensional crystals strewn across the ground. He could hold back, but upon seeing the Primordial Energy Skill Crystal, he couldn’t hold back any longer.

He sent the blood-colored avatar to rush to the periphery of Ant City without any hesitation, summoning the Mutated Skeleton Ant and Truth Listener to distract the swarm.

The black-winged flying ants quickly noticed him. Before he could arrive near the dimensional crystal, massive numbers of them rushed over.

The Mutated Skeleton Ant tried to lead a number away, but it was only a Mortal Companion Beast. It died almost instantly under the Legendary creature horde.

Using this brief moment, he leaped up and rushed towards the spot where the dimensional crystal dropped. He had his eyes fixed on the black-winged flying ant crystal.

The Silver-Winged Flying Ant also died at this moment from the barrage of attacks. Its bleeding carcass fell and large numbers of black-winged flying ants turned around and rushed for the blood-colored avatar.

Let me pick it up! Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar and used his greatest Speed and Strength to grab that black-winged flying ant crystal.

However, when its fingers were two feet away from the crystal, a large swarm of black-winged flying ants had rushed over, drowning it.

Thankfully this is in-game. If I had done that in real life, death would have been a certainty. Zhou Wen looked at the black screen and wore a bitter smile.

Dying without gaining anything in return was something Zhou Wen was already used to. Recently, he seldom died, unlike the period when he had first obtained the mysterious phone.

Dripping a drop of blood to revive himself, Zhou Wen entered the game once more. However, he knew that his strength was still lacking if he wanted to charge into Ant City. Therefore, he headed for Underground Buddha City.

Zhou Wen wished to visit Small Buddha Temple and see if he could make the selection again with the dungeon refreshed, hoping to get another Mythical Companion Egg.

However, he was disappointed when he entered. Even though Small Buddha Temple had been respawned, he wasn’t able to trigger the scene with the three-faced Buddha.

From the looks of it, I can only obtain one Mythical Companion Egg in-game. I wonder if visiting it in real life will allow me to trigger the three-face Buddha’s gift of a Companion Egg. Although Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted, he didn’t wish to take the risk and finally eliminated the thought.

To obtain the three-faced Buddha’s Companion Egg, I apparently need to first master the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra or death is certain. Those soldiers do not know this secret, so I’m afraid there will be many sacrifices. Zhou Wen had the intention of telling this secret to the scouts who explored Underground Buddha City; thus, reducing their losses. However, firstly, he didn’t have the chance to interact with these soldiers and secondly, he had no way of explaining how he knew that.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen’s eyes lit up as he muttered, “Since I can’t tell them directly, I can post the strategy guide of Underground Buddha City on the League’s Dimensional Forum. This way, I can receive the official’s reward and also prevent those soldiers from making sacrifices in vain.”

The League had always been encouraging its citizens to write out their thoughts and experiences regarding dimensional zones. For this, it had specially set up a server and an official Dimensional Forum.

Posting dimensional zone strategies on the forum could be set as paid articles. It was even possible for the officials to buy the rights and use it as teaching material in textbooks.

To ensure that the poster didn’t have any hesitation in writing these, the Dimensional Forum used a completely independent server and high-security measures. Unless it was voted by Congress, no one could check the data of the Dimensional Forum.

For this, the League had clearly set up a guarantee by law. It was to prevent experts who didn’t wish to expose themselves to freely write their strategies on the forum.

The League had many powerhouses who had the habit of browsing the Dimensional Forum. The typical citizen also treated it as a resource database.
