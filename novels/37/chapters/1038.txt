Chapter 1039: Ranking Challenge

Translator: CKtalon

When Zhou Wen returned to Wang Lu’s house, the 110 space suits had already been delivered.

“Zhou Wen, you’re here.” Wang Chan was very happy to see Zhou Wen. It was obvious that she had been in a good mood recently.

Although she was still affected by the Misfortune Life Providence, her mood was not as bad as before.

“I heard them say that you bought these space suits. Why did you buy so many? Do you want to go to heaven?” Wang Chan asked curiously.

“That’s right. I want to go up and take a look at the Moon to see if there’s the legendary Moon Rabbit or Chang’e,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Tch, those are all stories used to deceive children. There’s no Moon Rabbit or Chang’e. Even if there are, they are dimensional creatures,” Wang Chan said with a pout.

“It’s even better if they’re dimensional creatures. Maybe I can get a Chang’e Companion Beast to play with,” Zhou Wen said.

“Are you Pigsy from Journey to the West?” Wang Chan said with widened eyes.

“Why am I Pigsy?” Zhou Wen asked cooperatively.

“If you weren’t Pigsy, why would you think of something like that?” Wang Chan said with a smile.

While Wang Lu and the others were around, Zhou Wen told them about his time at the bureau.

In fact, Li Xuan and the others had already learned a lot from Tang Zhizhong. However, they didn’t know what had happened at the end.

“Shen Yuchi is a very terrifying person. My grandmother once evaluated him and said that he was an old turtle,” said Wang Lu.

Li Xuan was surprised. “Why is he called an old turtle? Could it be that he knows how to shrink?”

Wang Lu said, “Turtles may seem stupid and don’t seem to pose a threat. However, when a turtle really attacks, it is shockingly fast. Furthermore, as long as it bites, it will definitely not let go. Shen Yuchi is the same. He usually doesn’t reveal any flaws, and he’s fine when he doesn’t attack. Once he attacks, he will definitely bring doom to the victim. If such a person was born in the six families, his status would definitely not stop there. Even with his average background, he’s now a hot figure in the Federation. From this, we can tell how terrifying he is.”

“You embarrassed the bureau in front of everyone this time, but he still calmly negotiated a partnership with you. I have a nagging feeling that he won’t let this matter rest.”

“That’s right. There’s nothing good about a department like the Special Investigation Bureau. Shen Yuchi most likely invited you to the Moon to use you to get rid of the dimensional creatures there before thinking of a way to deal with you. Although your Companion Beasts are powerful, it’s too easy for something to happen to you on the Moon. I think it’s better not to go,” Li Xuan said.

“Actually, even if Shen Yuchi hadn’t invited me, I’d still want to make a trip to the moon. I have an Essence Energy Skill that’s at a critical juncture. I might have it break through by making a trip to the Moon. I agreed to Shen Yuchi’s request because I wanted to take advantage of the situation. Besides, if there really are those osmanthus flowers, they will be very useful to me. I don’t want to miss this opportunity,” Zhou Wen said.

He had originally planned on using his interstellar teleportation ability to visit the nearest Moon. However, in that case, he needed to be prepared to live on the Moon alone for a month.

Now that Shen Yuchi had invited him, he could visit it via rocket. If Shen Yuchi really wanted to deal with him, he could also use Glimmer’s interstellar teleportation to directly teleport back to Earth.

Furthermore, he had terrifyingly powerful existences on him. If Shen Yuchi really wanted to scheme against him, it was unknown who would suffer in the end.

“That’s true. To think that there are petals that can directly enhance a Companion Beast’s stage. That’s too satisfying,” Li Xuan added.

“In short, you have to be careful of Shen Yuchi. You must not trust him easily,” Wang Lu reminded him again and again.

“Got it. I’ll leave Ya’er for you guys to take care of her while I’m away. She’s relatively introverted and isn’t good at communicating with others. If she has offended anyone, don’t take it to heart on my account.” Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid that the Wang family would bully her, but he was afraid that the Wang family would anger Ya’er and result in her wiping them out.

“Don’t worry. We’ll take care of Ya’er like she’s our biological sister.” Wang Chan patted Ya’er’s head like a big sister.

“Old Zhou, let me accompany you. You are unfamiliar with the crappy Moon. It’s better to have more people to watch each other’s backs,” Li Xuan said.

“It’s best you don’t go. That place is different from Earth. If something happens here, as long as you don’t die, there’s still hope. If something happens there, where there’s no oxygen, even if you have an immortal body, it will probably be difficult for you to live, right?” Zhou Wen said.

“I’ve never tried that before...” Li Xuan was about to say something when he suddenly heard someone from the Wang family shouting in the yard.

“Third Aunt, what happened?” Wang Lu went out and stopped a woman.

“Someone challenged Ya, who is first on the rankings. Everyone is rushing to the cube to take a gander,” the middle-aged woman said.

Zhou Wen had almost forgotten about the ranking battle. He didn’t pay much attention to it.

It was mainly because he hadn’t advanced to the Mythical stage, so he didn’t plan on participating in the battle.

There didn’t seem to be much time left for the month-long countdown.

“You can go first. I have to check the space suits. I’ll rush over later.” Zhou Wen stayed behind alone as the others went to the cube to watch Ya’s battle.

“President Tang, does your company have accessories for oxygen, food, and water?” Zhou Wen asked Tang Zhizhong.

“Of course. We originally planned to make an industrial chain, but unfortunately, there are too few people who need these now. We have accumulated a lot of stock,” Tang Zhizhong said helplessly.

“Alright, send me all the equipment you produced. Don’t worry about the money. I won’t give you a single cent less than the asking price.” Zhou Wen was also preparing for the future.

Since there were dimensional creatures on the moon, Zhou Wen felt that there might be dimensional creatures on other planets. With Glimmer’s interstellar teleportation ability, he planned on visiting other planets in the future.

“The matching accessories can’t be sold. They are all stockpiled and aren’t worth much. If you want them, take them.” Tang Zhizhong wanted to do Zhou Wen a favor.

“There’s no need to give them to me for free. It’s fine as long as the items are good.” Zhou Wen naturally wasn’t someone who was greedy for small gains.

“Don’t worry. Our company is professional in this aspect,” Tang Zhizhong said confidently.

After Tang Zhizhong and company left, Zhou Wen sent the space suits into the chaos space. Before long, Tang Zhizhong sent over compressed oxygen and other equipment. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The precision of the accessories left Zhou Wen somewhat surprised. The various equipment dazzled him. There were even some that were specially used to resolve the clearing of bowels.

Zhou Wen only learned how to use most of the equipment after consulting Tang Zhizhong.
