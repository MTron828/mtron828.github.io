Chapter 1666 A New Era

Zhou Wen didn’t pay special attention to the so-called representatives. Earth was already close to a full-scale breakout. There wasn’t much time left for him, so he didn’t have the time to pay attention to such trivial matters.

In an ancient building in Ancient Sovereign City, Zhou Wen held the mysterious phone as his eyes widened. His eyes were about to pop out as beads of sweat constantly seeped out of his forehead and dripped down his cheeks.

Demonic Neonate, Banana Fairy, and the other Companion Beasts looked at Zhou Wen curiously as though they were watching a rare animal.

It wasn’t their fault for being curious. Zhou Wen had maintained this pose for seventeen to eighteen hours. Apart from his fingers occasionally moving, he was like a wooden statue.

In-game, Zhou Wen controlled the blood-colored avatar to enter Small Buddha Temple’s game dungeon again. In the past ten hours, he had repeated this action countless times.

The Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra came from Small Buddha Temple, so Zhou Wen originally wanted to see if he could condense a domain in Small Buddha Temple to advance to the Calamity grade.

Under Zhou Wen’s control, the game screen quickly turned black every time the blood-colored avatar entered the temple.

Zhou Wen never expected that the game dungeon, Small Buddha Temple, he had downloaded a long time ago would be so terrifying.

The three-faced Buddha who had once taken out three Companion Eggs for him to choose was even more terrifying than any Calamity-grade creature Zhou Wen had previously encountered.

Instant kill-an instant kill that left no room for negotiation. As long as Zhou Wen didn’t use the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra from the beginning and used other Essence Energy Arts to enter the temple, the blood-colored avatar would immediately die the moment the three-faced Buddha opened his six eyes.

Even if he used the Chaos Egg that had already reached the Calamity grade, it could only last for an instant before the Calamity-grade Chaos Egg exploded. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Zhou Wen was almost certain that the three-faced Buddha was at least at the top of the Calamity grade—the Heaven level. However, this was only a guess. Zhou Wen believed that the three-faced Buddha might be at the even more terrifying Apocalypse grade.

In front of the three-faced Buddha, the stronger Zhou Wen was, the stronger the three-faced Buddha became. He didn’t even have the chance to pull out the Immortal Culling Sword. However, even if he pulled it out and slashed out, it would probably be useless.

Zhou Wen nearly tried all the methods he could, but he was still instantly killed.

Faced with such a terrifying three-faced Buddha, Zhou Wen had already given up on the thought of using this place to advance the Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to the Calamity grade. The reason he kept throwing himself to his death was that he realized that every time the Chaos Egg exploded, it would grow at an astonishing speed. In less than a day, it was about to touch the threshold of the Hell level under the continuous ravages of the three-faced Buddha.

In the past month, Zhou Wen hadn’t left his room much. Guide Ancient City was also silently undergoing changes. However, this change was like the spring sun melting snow. It was done silently, making it stand out from the tumultuous changes in the outside world.

More and more alien representatives appeared on Earth. Almost every alien representative displayed their strength on the Cube’s screen through the Big Dipper dimensional zone.

After Mohe’s attempt, one alien representative after another attempted the Big Dipper dimensional zones and appeared on the Cube’s rankings. The Cube’s first place constantly changed. The top ten rankings often changed, and the competition was abnormally intense.

Many new experts were known by everyone. The rankings of the experts who had entered the rankings in the past were gradually pushed to the back. The strength of the veteran experts was gradually questioned.

The top ten spots on the rankings were nearly all occupied by the representatives of the various races. Now, everyone was discussing the strength of the representatives. Occasionally, when they mentioned the veteran experts, they were mostly discussing how far humans could go without the help of the alien races.

Although there were some people who firmly believed that powerhouses like Human Sovereign could fight the representatives of the alien races even if they didn’t become representatives, most of the time, many people were more willing to dream of being chosen by an alien race one day and becoming their representative. They would become powerful in a short period of time and become famous on the Cube’s rankings.

However, there was no free lunch. Most of the people who could become representatives of the alien races were genius experts who stood at the apex of the human pyramid to begin with. Even the originally unknown representatives were chosen because their potential hadn’t been developed before becoming representatives.

Zhou Wen wasn’t anxious when he saw the representatives appear on the rankings, but someone else was.

“Honn Shinsakura, have you gone mad?” Inside the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, an old man pointed at Honn Shinsakura. His fingers were trembling terribly as his face flushed red. The muscles on his face trembled. Clearly, he was extremely agitated.

Honn Shinsakura was no longer the tender youth who had followed Sei Gasakai to Luoyang to cultivate. His face no longer had the innocence and impetuousness of a youth. The mature man’s unique steady temperament and firm eyes, as well as his angular facial features, made him look like a lone island. He didn’t stir even when the waves crashed into him.

“I’m not mad,” Honn Shinsakura said calmly as he sat cross-legged on the mat with his swords placed flat on his lap.

“Not mad? Then you must be out of your mind. Wake up. Your choice determines the lives and future of more than ten thousand disciples of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. Instead of going to the six families, you actually want to go to Guide Ancient City? Do you know what’s going on outside? It’s the era of representatives. Even the Zhang family and the Dugu family, who have always been determined to fight the alien races, have already accepted the existence of representatives. They are trying their best to make their members representatives. What does Guide Ancient City have? I can tell you with certainty that there’s no representative there. You ignored the six families’ generous offers and insisted on going to Guide Ancient City. If that’s not madness, what is?” The elder became angrier as he spoke, eager to slap Honn Shinsakura awake.

“Zhou Wen’s there,” Honn Shinsakura said calmly without any change in expression.

“Zhou Wen? No matter how strong Zhou Wen is, he’s not a representative. What future can he have? Ignoring Zhou Wen’s Guide Ancient City, even the Luoyang An family he relies on hasn’t produced a representative yet. Sooner or later, they will be annexed by others. When that happens, we won’t even have the right to negotiate with the six families. We might even end up as cannon fodder. You are joking with the lives of more than ten thousand disciples of my Niten Flying Immortal Palace. I definitely disagree, and the various Elders definitely disagree.” When the elder said that, the few Elders standing beside him nodded silently, expressing their support for the elder’s opinion.

As the anomalies in the dimensional zones overseas became more and more serious, it was difficult for ordinary cultivators to survive at sea. The Niten Flying Immortal Palace had reached the point of having no choice but to consider returning to the continent. Otherwise, it would probably lead to a calamity in the near future.

However, on the question of where to go after returning to the continent, the current palace master of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace, Honn Shinsakura, and the Elder Consortium had a sharp disagreement.

The six families had previously come into contact with the Niten Flying Immortal Palace and expressed their willingness to take them in. They also offered rather good conditions. The few Elders were inclined to make a choice among the six families, but the present Palace Lord, Honn Shinsakura, insisted on heading to Guide Ancient City.
