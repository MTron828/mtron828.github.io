Chapter 693: Guidance

Translator: CKtalon

On the way to Tiger Cage Pass, he encountered many students. Unlike before, many of them took the initiative to greet Zhou Wen.

In the past, due to Zhou Wen’s relationship with Wang Mingyuan and the problem with the bureau, many students weren’t willing to interact with Zhou Wen. They were afraid of being implicated.

Things were somewhat different now. The anomaly at Dragon Gate Grotto allowed many students to witness how terrifying break-out creatures were. At the same time, they deeply realized that only the strong could survive and protect the human cities in the future.

As for Zhou Wen, who had illustrious feats on the battlefield, many students had no choice but to reconsider their interactions with him.

However, Zhou Wen looked at them in a somewhat odd manner. It wasn’t because of their actions, but because he had activated his Eye of Hell and saw the invisible flames on them. It was as though he was looking at EXP treasures.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen’s mind was relatively normal. If he were Ják, he would have long culled them for the experience.

“Zhou Wen, what are you doing here?” Zhou Wen had just arrived at the entrance of Tiger Cage Pass when he saw Li Weiyang leading a group of girls outside.

“Senior Weiyang, I’m here to kill Demonized Generals,” Zhou Wen answered.

Li Weiyang joked, “Dear Almighty Zhou, shouldn’t you be killing Mythical creatures? Why are you here in Tiger Cage Pass to snatch the mere Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals from us? Is there any justice in this world?”

Zhou Wen didn’t know what to say as Li Weiyang continued, “We also have to enter Tiger Cage Pass to kill Demonized Soldiers and Demonized Generals. These juniors aren’t experienced enough. Why don’t you join us? You can give the juniors a demonstration.”

Li Weiyang’s invitation didn’t conflict with Zhou Wen’s intentions, so he nodded and said, “Actually, killing ordinary Demonized Generals isn’t difficult. Previously, Li Xuan and I made a strategy. If one follows the strategy, they only need four or five at the Mortal stage to kill a Demonized General.”

“Senior, teach us please,” a female freshman said to Zhou Wen.

The girls immediately turned rowdy, clamoring for Zhou Wen to teach them how to kill Demonized Generals. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Of course.” Zhou Wen agreed readily. After all, his goal was to farm invisible flames. He wouldn’t waste much time teaching them.

The group of girls happily followed Zhou Wen into Tiger Cage Pass. Some of the girls even pulled him along and to teach them how to kill Demonized Soldiers.

Li Weiyang didn’t stop him. All she did was watch with a smile. However, she thought to herself, Do you little vixens really think that this is some treasured meat? If it was really a treasure, I would have called dibs long ago. Would you even have a chance? It’s just a piece of titanium-alloyed bone. Ignoring the possibility of eating it, just attempting to bite on it will spoil your teeth.

Indeed, as Li Weiyang had expected, the girls originally imagined that Zhou Wen would gently teach them. He might even hold their hands and teach them. This way, they could have some intimate contact with this famous senior. It might even lead to a romantic beginning.

However, when Zhou Wen really started teaching them, they realized how ridiculously wrong they were.

Zhou Wen simply used the standards of a soldier on them. No, it should be said that he requested inhuman standards of them.

“That’s not right. Your foot has to stretch out three centimeters more. Lower your head a little more and punch with more strength. Can you not draw circles with your sword? Be more efficient. Why are you twisting your waist over there? Stand straight...” Zhou Wen spoke to them as though he was lecturing a recruit.

Zhou Wen felt that there was nothing wrong with this. On the battlefield, a tiny mistake could cost them their lives. They needed to be absolutely correct.

Furthermore, if they wanted to kill a Legendary Demonized General at the Mortal stage, they needed to be precise in everything. Otherwise, problems would easily arise.

Zhou Wen had taught them according to the standards he had been shown during his practices with Li Xuan and Feng Qiuyan. He had even lowered his standards to the minimum.

Even so, they failed to meet the requirements. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown.

The girls realized that this was different from what they had imagined. They originally thought that it would be a pleasant interaction with their senior, but they ended up being treated as animals.

Seeing many girls leave silently, Li Weiyang laughed inwardly. These girls have finally seen how clueless a man can be.

Sometime into Zhou Wen’s lesson, he realized that the number of girls who listened to his explanations and guidance was decreasing. Furthermore, they were all over the place. They couldn’t meet his standards.

However, there was a first-year junior who surprised Zhou Wen. She had meticulously completed all the techniques that Zhou Wen had taught. Although there were some mistakes, she was much better than the other girls.

Furthermore, the junior was rather talented. She seemed to realize her mistakes and would fix many of them in her next practice.

“Senior, can I kill a Demonized General alone at the Mortal stage?” The other girls had already distanced themselves from Zhou Wen, but this girl took the initiative to ask him.

“It’s not impossible. Show me what you’ve learned.” Zhou Wen felt that the girl was rather talented and hardworking. He wasn’t stingy with teaching this junior.

The girl showed Zhou Wen what she had learned. Although Zhou Wen saw that she hadn’t learned any Essence Energy Skills, her basics were very solid. It was obvious that she had worked hard and was an all-rounder.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but recall the time he cultivated Ascetic Meditation. Like the girl, he had been silently cultivating, doing his best to do what he could.

“With your present skills, it’s a little difficult to kill a Demonized General. I can slightly change your movement technique’s positioning. That might allow you to kill a Demonized General. However, before that, you still need to train your strength. Your present strength isn’t enough. Furthermore, this will require a lot of practice and actual combat. It’s not something that can be done in a short period of time,” Zhou Wen said.

“If it’s not troublesome, can you teach me? If it’s too troublesome, forget it,” the girl asked in embarrassment.

“It’s not troublesome.” Zhou Wen explained how to change her movement technique.

In fact, it was just adding some basic techniques of Transcendent Flying Immortal. Zhou Wen demonstrated it once and guided the girl several times.

Li Weiyang couldn’t help but be surprised when she saw the girl learning from Zhou Wen. It was really surprising that there was a girl who wasn’t frightened away by him.

Zhou Wen guided the girl a few times and when he saw that she wasn’t making any more mistakes, he said to her, “Your movement is right, but you need to spend time practicing. When you can use it freely in battle, along with a raise of your strength, you can kill a Demonized General alone.”

“Thank you, Senior. I know what to do.” After thanking him, the girl went to the side to silently practice.

Seeing that no more girls were asking him for advice, Zhou Wen began his Hell King advancement plan.

The Demonized Soldiers in reality were no different from the Demonized Soldiers in-game. However, these Demonized Soldiers had the invisible flames on their bodies.
