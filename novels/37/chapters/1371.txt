Chapter 1372: Yang City

Translator: CKtalon

This discomfort gave Zhou Wen new ideas.

That’s right. The so-called Heart Slaying doesn’t necessarily have to make the other party wish they were dead. From a broader picture, it’s to make one wish they were dead. But drilling down, as long as it can make the enemy feel uncomfortable, it can also be said to be a destruction of heart. The so-called Heart Slaying is actually pointing at the weakness of the other party’s humanity. In other words, what I need to do is to see through the other party’s weaknesses in human nature.

It’s easy to find flaws in a move because the move is right there. I can study ways to crack it at any time, but how can I figure out the weakness in human nature of an enemy I’m not familiar with??Zhou Wen fell into deep thought again. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Seeing that Zhou Wen was in a daze again, Sweetie lowered her head in a daze. Her eyes were focused elsewhere as she gloomily turned around and left the yard. She had the urge to head out to have some desserts.

“Young Master Wen specially told me to buy this for you. Eat it while it’s hot.” Just as Sweetie stepped out, she saw An Sheng walk over with a box in his hand.

“This is… the plum blossom cake from Yun’s…” Sweetie’s eyes lit up when she saw the box. She nearly drooled.

The last time she ate with Zhou Wen and Madam Lan, she had seen Zhou Wen eat such a plum blossom cake. Back then, her appetite had been whet, but Zhou Wen hadn’t left any for her. It left Sweetie depressed the entire day.

“Why would I want his things?” Sweetie turned her head to the side as though it was beneath her, but she couldn’t help but glance at the box of plum blossom cake.

“Young Master Wen said that you like it, so he got me to specially buy it for you. Since you don’t like it, I’ll throw it away.” An Sheng turned around and left.

“Don’t… It’s a waste to throw it away… Although I really don’t like plum blossom cake… I can’t waste food… I’ll just… accept it…” Sweetie said with a red face.

“Then I’ll leave it to you.” An Sheng handed the box to Sweetie before turning to leave.

After An Sheng left, Sweetie found an empty garden. She opened the box and leaned in to take a sniff. The sweet smell immediately made her face beam with happiness.

Soon, Sweetie’s mouth was filled with plum blossom cake. Her cheeks were full, and the corners of her mouth were stained with red bean stuffing. As she ate, she muttered to herself, “That baddie, Zhou Wen, isn’t too bad at times. He’s not hopeless… Uh… Nice…”

Zhou Wen was still pondering over his problems. He wasn’t in the mood to instruct An Sheng to prepare those. However, An Sheng had found an opportunity to prepare the plum blossom cake for her when he saw that Sweetie liked it a lot.

If it’s someone I’m familiar with, I know their temperament and might discover their weakness in human nature… That’s not right either… No matter how close a person is to me, they will bury secrets in their hearts. Ordinary people wouldn’t show their weakest side to others, much less strangers…

Zhou Wen thought hard.?Since it’s impossible to know the weakness of the other party’s human nature from their words, I can only rely on observation. But what kind of observation can point straight at the human heart?

Zhou Wen felt that he definitely couldn’t figure it out by just thinking about it. He had to personally observe it to discover it.

Who should I observe??Zhou Wen thought for a moment. Although Sweetie was with him all day and he could observe her at any time, she was like a blank piece of paper. Everything was written on her face. He didn’t need to observe to know what she was thinking.

As for people close to them, it didn’t seem appropriate to observe the weaknesses in their nature.

I have to find an enemy, Zhou Wen muttered to himself before creating a list in his heart.

The first to bear the brunt was naturally the League of Guardians. Zhou Wen felt that it was time for him to make a trip to the League of Guardians.

Others were afraid of the Terror-grade Guardians of the League of Guardians, but Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid at all. With the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of a siege.

As long as he was given enough time in advance to set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, it was useless no matter how many Terror-grade Guardians there were unless someone could crack it.

Of course, it would be different if a Calamity-grade creature came. Thankfully, the League of Guardians still didn’t have any Calamity-grade creatures.

It was as though the dimension couldn’t create a Calamity-grade Guardian. The Guardians that were teleported to Earth were at most at the Terror grade.

Since they can come to Luoyang, why can’t I go to the League of Guardians? Even if I can’t defeat them, it’s good to see how strong they are.?Zhou Wen had no intention of killing anyone on his trip.

Firstly, killing people didn’t benefit him. It didn’t allow Slaughterer to advance. What was key was to figure out a method to discover the weakness of one’s human nature. Secondly, with Sweetie by his side, if he really started a massacre, Sweetie wouldn’t be able to watch on and would represent the kind and righteous Heaven to destroy him. Zhou Wen wouldn’t even have the time to cry.

Zhou Wen told An Sheng about his intention to go to the League of Guardians. He originally imagined that An Sheng would persuade him not to take the risk.

To his surprise, An Sheng’s eyes lit up as he said, “You should have done this a long time ago. Young Master Wen, I’ve long wanted to say that you’re good at everything, but you’re too kind-hearted. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Blood for blood. If others slap you, you have to slap them back. That’s what makes it awesome.”

“You have to continue with the matter of the Heavenly Robe.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “I want to sell the Heavenly Robe to the League of Guardians.”

“At this stage, is it still possible?” An Sheng felt that it wouldn’t be easy to sell the Heavenly Robe to the League of Guardians.

“Where there’s a will there is a way. Just continue making preparations. There’s no need to deliberately interact with the League of Guardians. Let’s first interact with other people who are interested in the Heavenly Robe. Have the necessary discussions.” Zhou Wen already had plans.

“Alright, I know what to do.” An Sheng understood what Zhou Wen meant.

After making arrangements for Luoyang, Zhou Wen set off for the headquarters of the League of Guardians.

Sweetie naturally wouldn’t let Zhou Wen off. She continued following him as though she wouldn’t stop until she found a reason to kill him.

Zhou Wen sat on the Earth Elemental Beast’s back and took out his phone. He switched on the downloaded Yang City to see what was inside Yang City that even Sweetie—God—wasn’t willing to enter.

Yang City was a mud city. The blood-colored avatar pushed open the door and entered. With a turn of the camera, many buildings made of clay bricks and wood appeared on the screen. They looked ancient and backward.

The city wasn’t small. Strangely, Zhou Wen didn’t see any living dimensional creature. The whole of Yang City was dead silent, like a ghost city.

What’s that??Zhou Wen sized up the buildings in Yang City and quickly discovered something strange.
