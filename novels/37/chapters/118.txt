Chapter 119 Providence Palace

Li Xuan had always believed that the antelope was a mutated animal from the bottom half of Mount Laojun. However, the power of its hooves made him realize that it was not only a dimensional creature but an extremely high-level one.

His Immortal God of Combat Life Providence had greatly augmented his Constitution. Although calling it an immortal and indestructible Dominance Body was an exaggeration, it wouldn’t be easy for mere Legendaries to injure him.

The antelope had severely injured him with a casual kick of its hoof. This was already beyond the strength of a Legendary level. It was highly likely an Epic stage existence.

“I’ll take you to the hospital.” Zhou Wen was also given a fright. Although the antelope had been staying at his place and refusing to leave, it had never hurt him.

Now, with this strike, it had severely injured Li Xuan, who had just ascended to the Legendary stage. It also confirmed Zhou Wen’s previous speculation that the antelope had terrifying strength.

“There’s no need. This small injury is nothing to me. The Immortal God of Combat Life Providence still means something.” Li Xuan shook his head and propped himself up, using the coffee table to stand up.

Li Xuan seemed to be enduring a great deal of pain in the beginning. Even breathing seemed to be unbearable, and his face was ghastly pale.

However, after taking a few deep breaths, his complexion gradually improved. The injury on his chest seemed to be slowly recovering.

“The Immortal God of Combat has a powerful self-recovery ability. As long as I’m alive, my injuries can slowly recover.” Li Xuan did not forget to boast about his Life Providence.

“Your Virgin God of Combat Life Providence sure is nice.” Zhou Wen was slightly surprised. This Life Providence was really impressive-it could be considered a life-saving skill.

“What Virgin God of Combat... It’s Immortal God of Combat... Cough...” Agitated, Li Xuan pulled at his internal injuries, causing him to cough out a lot of blood.

“It looks like your self-recovery powers won’t restore you that quickly. Let me take you to the hospital now.” Zhou Wen helped Li Xuan out.

Li Xuan originally wanted to say no, but when he saw the antelope on the couch, he shivered and left Zhou Wen’s dormitory with his neck shrank back.

“What’s with that antelope? Isn’t it a mutated animal from Mount Laojun?” Li Xuan asked in a suppressed voice after Zhou Wen helped him out of the building.

“I’m not too sure either. It’s been following me all this time, but it hasn’t injured anyone before. It’s the first time today,” Zhou Wen said honestly.

“I... Forget it... I’ll just blame it on my luck... There’s no need to go to the hospital. Let’s find a place to rest. I still have something to tell you.” Li Xuan felt depressed.

Zhou Wen sized Li Xuan up and asked, “Is your injury really alright?”

“It’s just a flesh wound and I’m not internally injured. Even if we don’t go to the hospital, it will only take a few days before I recover. It’ll be troublesome if we go to the hospital, but you be careful in the future. Don’t end up getting kicked to death by that animal,” Li Xuan said.

The two of them sat down on a long bench on the lawn. Li Xuan’s complexion was much better now, having appeared to have returned to normal. From the looks of it, he wasn’t just bragging. The Immortal God of Combat was indeed impressive.

It’s not bad to have a life-saving Life Providence like Li Xuan’s, Zhou Wen thought.

“The school’s first comprehensive test is almost here. How’s your preparation going?” Li Xuan asked after taking a few deep breaths while on the long bench.

“What preparation?” Zhou Wen knew about the monthly comprehensive test, but he had no idea why he needed to prepare for it. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Li Xuan rolled his eyes at Zhou Wen speechlessly. “Let me guess. You didn’t read the syllabus for the comprehensive test?”

“No, has it been announced?” Zhou Wen shook his head slightly.

Li Xuan complained, “You really don’t know anything about the outside world. All you focus on is gaming. Every year, the first comprehensive test is the same. There are a total of four subjects—fishing a coin from a pot of oil, crossing a paper bridge, lifting stone tripod cauldrons, and sucking in the mountain and rivers. You need to pass two of these tests to pass. If you were to fail three of them, you would be dismissed from school.”

“Why do these names sound like acrobatic performances of the past?” Zhou Wen laughed.

“The names are indeed tacky, but they really aren’t easy. These tests are real tests of ability and not some sleight of hand used by acrobats on the street. Fishing out a coin from a pot of boiling oil uses real oil. To fish one out with one’s physical body is definitely impossible. Your hand will be crippled the moment you put it in. You need to have a Primordial Energy Skill covering your hand or have a protective Primordial Energy Skill to fish the coin out. Crossing the paper bridge is the easiest test to fail. It’s a paper bridge spanning a hundred meters. The bridge’s surface is made of thin calligraphic paper and tearing it when stepping over it will be considered a failure. Without a Primordial Energy Skill that imbues you with alacrity, there’s no way to cross it.

“The lifting of the stone tripod cauldron is easy. As long as you have enough Strength, using some Primordial Energy Skill that enhances Strength will allow you to pass. It’s not difficult to devour the mountain and rivers either. As long as you have 9 points of Primordial Energy, you’ll basically pass. These are the basic requirements Sunset College sets. You should be fine for the latter two, but you need to prepare the first two. If you don’t have the type of Primordial Energy Skills required, I can lend you a few Primordial Energy Skill Crystals,” Li Xuan said.

“There’s no need. I have my ways of passing.” Zhou Wen had Lotus Flower Buddha’s Primordial Energy Skill, so it shouldn’t be a problem to fish out a coin.

As for crossing the paper bridge, he also had Dragon Gate Fairy Skill. It wouldn’t be difficult for him to cross the bridge.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on completing all the tests since he could pass as long as he completed two tests. There was no need for him to participate in all four of them.

However, Li Xuan said, “Don’t take this matter lightly. If you can squeeze into the top ten in the comprehensive test, you can get a chance to enter Providence Palace. Besides Sunset College. That’s an awesome place unique to Sunset College that you can’t find elsewhere.”

“Providence Palace?” Zhou Wen was surprised.

Zhou Wen had heard of this name before. Providence Palace was actually the royal palace in the era of the Sui and Tang dynasty. Back then, Luoyang City was the capital and center of politics of the country and Providence Palace was the political center of Luoyang.

Later on, Providence Palace was later buried in history and was destroyed during a war. However, after the dimensional storms, its ruins formed a dimensional zone.

Zhou Wen had heard a lot of rumors about the Providence Palace’s dimensional zone. It was a relatively special dimensional zone without much danger inside; yet, it was possible to obtain great opportunities inside.

In the past, when he was in high school, there were rumors of a certain student obtaining a particular treasure in Providence Palace and ended directly shooting to stardom, advancing to the Legendary or even the Epic stage.

Of course, they were only urban myths. The Providence Palace’s dimensional zone had always been under Sunset College’s control and had never been open to the public. Only a handful of Sunset College students had the qualification to enter. As for what benefits lay within, Zhou Wen really did not know what it was.
