Chapter 619 Genie“s Master

There’s actually someone here? But even if someone lives here, the power supply in the town should have been cut off. How can there be light? Zhou Wen was alarmed as he carefully approached the shop at the corner of the street.

The shop was a minimart. Quite a number of the LED lights on the shop sign were not working. A small portion of them was still lit. In such an environment, it looked a little strange.

Zhou Wen used Truth Listener’s hearing abilities. Although he was still very far away, the situation in the minimart had already projected itself in his mind. It was like a holographic projection that allowed him to see everything clearly. It even had color.

Soon, Zhou Wen saw a young man sitting on a wooden rocking chair in the minimart with his eyes closed.

On the wooden table beside the rocking chair was a mess of snacks and a few opened cans of beer.

The youth rocked in the chair as he closed his eyes in enjoyment. He gulped down beer and occasionally threw a few snacks into his mouth. He looked rather pleased.

And on the counter beside him was an oil lamp. The style of the oil lamp was very similar to that of the Saga of Heroes oil lamp. It was obvious that it wasn’t from the East District.

The oil lamp’s flames shone with white light. Strangely, in the white light, the lights in the minimart lit up. There was also a fan that was spinning.

Zhou Wen had just taken a look when the oil lamp’s flame suddenly expanded. Instantly, white light surged, immediately disabling the effectiveness of Truth Listener’s ability. It couldn’t hear the situation in the minimart.

Zhou Wen was alarmed as he looked at the minimart. He saw that the youth had already walked out and was looking at him.

Beside the youth, the oil lamp floated in the air. As for the flame, it had already turned into what looked like a deity. It was somewhat similar to the mythical Aladdin’s magic lamp.

When the youth saw Zhou Wen, his expression seemed odd. He stood there and sized him up as though he was very curious about him.

Zhou Wen also sized up the youth. He looked 27 or 28 years old. He wasn’t handsome, but he was very stylish. He was the type that was filled with manly charm.

Zhou Wen was certain that he had never seen him before as he looked rather unfamiliar.

As for the lamp beside him, Zhou Wen recognized it. It was Genie which was on the ranking. It had once been ranked third, but it had now fallen to ninth place. It was still quite a respectable ranking.

"Please don’t misunderstand. I don’t have any ill intentions. I just happened to pass by and saw some light, so I came over out of curiosity," Zhou Wen said.

The youth curled his lips and laughed. "It’s fate that we meet. Apart from us, there’s no one else here. Why don’t you come in and have a drink with me? It will save us the loneliness of the night."

"Thank you for your kindness. I still have something to do. I’ll continue on my way. I won’t disturb you any further." Zhou Wen felt that the youth was somewhat odd, so he decided to stay away from him.

To his surprise, the youth said with a smile, "There are mountains surrounding three sides of this area. Apart from the path you took to enter, there’s no other way out. And in such a sh*thole, the only useful thing is probably the black cube in the town square. I’m afraid you are like me. You don’t want others to see your Companion Beast on the rankings, right?"

The youth’s guess was naturally correct. Although Zhou Wen wanted to deny it, he couldn’t find a reasonable excuse.

"Now that you’ve seen my Genie, even if I know that your Companion Beast is on the rankings, you and I have something against each other. No one will be at a disadvantage. I’ve been here for many days and haven’t even seen a fly. I’m really bored. Just stay here and chat with me," said the youth with a smile.

Zhou Wen didn’t move. Since he had been discovered, he decided not to let Tyrant Behemoth fight here. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Just as he was about to bid farewell and leave, the youth continued, "It doesn’t matter if you don’t want to stay. However, you already know my secret, and I don’t have anything to use against you. It’s naturally impossible for me to let you leave alive."

As he spoke, the Genie beside the youth had already arrived in front of him. It stared at Zhou Wen and took a deep breath. The body condensed from the flame instantly doubled in size as though a flaming vortex was flowing inside.

"Do you want to fight my Genie or stay behind to drink with me? Make a choice." The youth leaned against the door frame and took another sip before looking at Zhou Wen with a smile.

"I’m sorry." Zhou Wen turned around and left.

The youth didn’t have any intention of taking action. He only said indifferently, "You know that my Companion Beast is Genie, but you aren’t moved at all. Yet, you came to this godforsaken place to make it onto the rankings. The Companion Beasts you possess are definitely extraordinary. At the very least, they are higher than my Genie. Even if you aren’t on the rankings, I can guess that any new top Companion Beast that appears on the ranking will be yours."

Zhou Wen didn’t stop as he continued walking.

The youth’s voice continued, "Your name is Zhou Wen, right? Everyone in the bureau has a photo of you."

"You’re from the bureau?" Zhou Wen turned to look at the youth. If the youth was really a member of the bureau, he could use all means to kill him, despite not liking the idea of murder.

"Don’t misunderstand. I have nothing to do with the bureau." The youth shrugged nonchalantly and said, "I’m the same as you. I’m a target of the bureau’s pursuit. I’ve seen your photo in the hands of the bureau’s people and some information. That’s why I recognize you."

"You came here to attempt getting into the rankings and have a powerful Companion Beast. I’m guessing you are planning on doing something. However, the bureau doesn’t seem to have any Mythical Companion Beasts on the rankings. I remember now. You have quite a deep grudge with the Cape family. Are you trying to challenge the Capes’ Companion Beasts on the rankings?"

The youth thought for a moment and laughed. "Chimera... You want to challenge Chimera, right?"

"Who are you?" Zhou Wen frowned as he looked at the youth. He hadn’t said a thing, but the youth had already guessed so much. It was as though he had read his mind. It left Zhou Wen somewhat alarmed.

"Uncrying Night. First on the bureau’s wanted list, and my bounty is the highest. Have you heard of me?" The youth drank another mouthful of beer before continuing.

Zhou Wen didn’t know who was ranked first on the bureau’s wanted list, but the youth did indeed make him wary.

"I already know your secret. Unless you kill me or give up on your plan, it doesn’t matter where you get to on the rankings. Why don’t you stay and have a few drinks with me? That way, you won’t be alone in this remote mountain range." The youth threw a can of beer at Zhou Wen.
