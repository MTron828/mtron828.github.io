Chapter 1465 Ancient City Anomaly

“It’s good that you’re back.” Looking at the youth in front of him, Yu Qiubai had a thousand things to say, but he was momentarily at a loss for words.

The youth who had painstakingly left this place had finally returned. However, he was no longer the same Zhou Wen from back then. No one had expected such a scene to happen today.

“Sir, guard the school for now. Don’t leave the area to go out. I’ll be back soon,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned two Terror-form Golden Battle Gods to stand guard outside the school. He then flew towards the distant skeleton horde.

As the Golden Battle Gods had already undergone Terror transformation, ordinary people couldn’t see them.

The soldiers and teachers saw Zhou Wen fly into the sky and charge at a skeleton legion in the distance. Wherever he passed, the skeleton legion collapsed like dust washed away by a storm.

“That… looks like Zhou Wen, right? Why is he here?”

“Don’t you know? Zhou Wen graduated from our school.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Holy sh*t, for real? Zhou Wen was from our school?”

“Isn’t that obvious? Didn’t you hear how he greeted our principal? He used to be a student under him.”

“In that case, Zhou Wen is our senior?”

“Holy sh*t, I think that Mythical creature dropped a Companion Egg. He didn’t even pick it up!”

“There are many dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs outside. They are everywhere!”

Old Wu held a wrinkled cigarette in his mouth as he took a deep drag and spat it out. He looked in the direction Zhou Wen had flown in and said, “Talent is really desirable! Talent allows you to do whatever you want. I love it.”

Zhou Wen wiped out the nearby skeleton legion, but he still saw skeleton creatures rushing out of Guide Ancient City. He knew that if he didn’t resolve the problem of Guide Ancient City, it would be useless no matter how many skeletons he killed.

Thankfully, most of the skeleton creatures had been wiped out by him with only a few escaping. The skeletons that rushed out of Guide Ancient City were unable to form a legion.

After some thought, Zhou Wen flew in the direction of Guide Ancient City, hoping to root out the problem.

Guide Ancient City hadn’t had any obvious changes to its appearance since Zhou Wen first entered. However, there were skeleton creatures everywhere. Even the moat was filled with skeletons, as though it was a river that led to hell.

Zhou Wen’s figure streaked across the sky as large swaths of skeleton creatures were culled. Plenty of dimensional crystals dropped.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to pick up the low-level dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs as he charged straight for the ancient city’s door. After rushing into the ancient city, Zhou Wen realized that ancient buildings stretched out like a mountain range. The ancient city was many times bigger than before with no end in sight.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that the skeleton creatures had come out from inside the ancient city, but after entering, he realized that there weren’t any skeleton creatures in the ancient city. In fact, most of the skeleton creatures had crawled out from the ground and moat outside the city.

Strange, why don’t I see a single skeleton creature? Zhou Wen looked around. Unlike the flames of war outside, the ancient city was terrifyingly quiet. It was virtually silent, as though it was a different world from the outside.

Zhou Wen failed to discover a single creature in the city the entire time.

He found it somewhat odd. All he could do was don the Prisoned Dragon armor and stick the Substitute Talisman on him. He continued keeping the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation around at its limits before heading for the Fire God Platform.

As the ancient city was many times bigger than before, the possibility of the Fire God Platform still being in its original spot wasn’t high, but the general direction couldn’t be wrong.

Zhou Wen swept past the roofs of the ancient buildings. To his surprise, they seemed to be enveloped by a mysterious force. Truth Listener’s ability couldn’t hear anything inside.

There was nothing. Apart from the ancient buildings that resembled a palace complex, this place seemed to be a ghost city. Zhou Wen didn’t see anything as he traveled.

I’ve finally found it! Zhou Wen finally discovered the Fire God Platform. It hadn’t changed much and still looked the same. It didn’t seem different from the last time he came.

Zhou Wen went straight to the Fire God Platform and couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he found the stone saber still embedded in the furnace.

Strange, the stone saber is still there. It wasn’t pulled out. Why did the ancient city undergo such a large-scale breakout? Furthermore, the ancient city itself has undergone a huge change? Zhou Wen was puzzled.

The first reason Zhou Wen hadn’t pulled out the saber was that he was afraid that it would lead to the destruction of Guide City. Secondly, it was also because of The Thearch.

However, there was another important reason. Zhou Wen knew that only people who had cultivated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra could pull out the stone saber. It wasn’t that easy to gain basic mastery in the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. Furthermore, to pull out the stone saber, one needed to reach the Mythical stage with the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. Otherwise, The Thearch wouldn’t have specially negotiated with him.

The Ancient Sovereign Sutra wasn’t a Qi Refinement Art. One couldn’t raise it by loading up resources, so Zhou Wen wasn’t too worried about the stone saber being pulled out.

From the looks of it, the stone saber hadn’t been pulled out.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling puzzled, he suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He subconsciously turned around.

A figure was standing on the roof of an ancient building amidst the stretch of buildings, staring at him.

Humanoid dimensional creature? Zhou Wen’s heart tightened. Among dimensional creatures, there weren’t many that were similar to humans in size, but the more human-like a dimensional creature was, the more terrifying it was. For example, the main gods of many pantheons were in human form. Although there were some exceptions, Zhou Wen still paid attention to humanoid creatures. The dimensional creature on the roof was no different from a human. He was tall and muscular, and his hair was disheveled. He was covered in animal hide, and his exposed skin showed a healthy tan.

None of these mattered. The main point was that Zhou Wen sensed a special aura from him. This aura was something only people who cultivated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra had. The other party was a dimensional creature; yet, he actually had the aura of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. This was somewhat strange.

The dimensional creature was casually standing on the roof, but it had an aura that made it appear like an apex predator. It made Zhou Wen feel uneasy.

Zhou Wen flicked his finger and the Bamboo Blade that had transformed into a ring bounced out. Like a bent spring, it instantly returned to its straight form. It was already the size of the normal Bamboo Blade by the time it landed in Zhou Wen’s hand.

Zhou Wen held the Bamboo Blade and stared at the humanoid dimensional creature. The ominous feeling didn’t weaken.
