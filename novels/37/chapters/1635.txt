Chapter 1636 Birth of the Companion Beast

I can’t wait any longer. Jiuyang realized the anomaly on the white egg-shaped object. He knew that he couldn’t wait any longer. If he waited any longer, the Companion Beast inside would probably be born.

The Sun God Light erupted with a resplendent divine glow as Jiuyang’s body seemed to transform into a beam that tore through spacetime. He instantly arrived in front of the white egg-shaped object, hoping to penetrate it with the Sun God Light.

However, before his Sun God Light could touch the white egg-shaped object, he saw several huge tentacles extend out from behind and block it.

The Sun God Light collided with the tentacles and forcefully severed the tentacles that were wrapped in electromagnetic force, reducing them to pieces. However, in the next second, electromagnetic light flashed as the tentacles that had been sliced into pieces gathered together again and swept towards Jiuyang.

While Jiuyang was fighting the tentacle monster, Xiao secretly instant transmitted to the back of the white egg-shaped object and extended his fingers to slice it apart.

A blue light instantly swept over at an unbelievable speed. Xiao had no choice but to retract his finger. Otherwise, his finger would have been severed by the blue light before it touched the white egg.

The other Calamity creatures rushed over as well, plummeting the scene into further chaos.

Xiao dodged the blue light and the strange fish’s attacks several times, but he failed to get close to the white egg-shaped object.

“Help me open up a path.” The Sun God Light on Jiuyang’s body became even more resplendent. His entire body seemed to turn into light as every strike was like a hydrogen bomb exploding. However, when such a powerful force struck the transparent barrier formed by the combination of the black and white wolves, it failed to break through. He ultimately failed to charge over.

“It’s better if you help me open up a path.” Xiao’s figure flashed past like a phantom, luring the strange fish and the blue light to Jiuyang’s vicinity.

Jiuyang’s whole body emitted divine light that nearly enveloped the entire planet’s interior space. The few Calamity creatures were attacked, and they couldn’t focus on Xiao’s whereabouts.

Xiao finally found an opportunity. Like a ghost, he arrived in front of the white egg-shaped object again. Before the Calamity creatures could stop him, he pointed his finger at it.

Just as Xiao thought he was about to succeed, the white egg-shaped object suddenly shattered like glass. The white fragments scattered and turned into a sticky white liquid from touching anything. Although Xiao was the closest, his reaction was the fastest. Before the white fragments touched him, his figure vanished as he retreated. When he appeared again, he was already extremely far away. He dodged left and right, missing the flying white fragments.

The other Calamity creatures and Jiuyang were also affected. The tentacle monster used its tentacles to whip the white fragments, and some of them stuck to its tentacles. The strange fish used its tail to sweep away the fragments, but it also got some white liquid stuck onto it.

The black and white wolves were protected by a barrier, blocking all the white fragments. White mucus covered the barrier’s exterior.

The blue light was the fastest and dodged all the white shards.

The Sun God Light on Jiuyang’s body was too intense. Everything that came close vaporized. The white fragments were no exception. They couldn’t approach him at all.

The Calamity creatures collectively looked at the white egg-shaped object and saw a white Companion Beast floating in front of it.

It looked very strange. Its entire body was snow-white like jade. Its body was upright, and its legs were like a goat’s, but its upper limbs were like a hairless monkey’s. Its nails were extremely sharp and emitted a jade luster.

Its eyes were huge, and its nose was sharp and short. When it pursed its lips, one could only see a slightly curved arc. There was no hair on its head, and the back of its head was abnormally large. It drooped down to its back like a horn.

There was no hint of vitality from it, as though it was a lifeless jade statue. However, its eyes were moving. Its vertical pupils that resembled feline eyes were slowly turning left and right as though it was observing the Calamity creatures and Jiuyang and company.

The tentacle monster’s huge tentacles that swept towards the Companion Beast carried an electromagnetic storm with them.

The Companion Beast didn’t dodge when it saw the huge dragon-like tentacles sweep over with electromagnetic forces. It only stood there and looked at it in a daze.

The tentacles had already reached the Companion Beast and even wrapped around its body, but the Companion Beast remained motionless.

The Calamity creatures, Jiuyang, and Xiao, who had been watching, felt regret. If they had known that the Companion Beast would be so slow to the uptake, they would have been the first to rush forward. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

They had thought that the tentacle monster was too rash just now, but from the looks of it, it was too late for them to rush over.

Just as the Companion Beast was about to be pulled into the electromagnetic storm and the Calamity creatures were filled with regret, the tentacles suddenly came to an abrupt halt.

The tentacles froze in midair as though they were trembling. The tentacles that bound the Companion Beast slowly released.

Just as everyone was wondering what had happened, they suddenly saw something white seeping out of the tentacles. It was like white paint and white spots rapidly spread across its body.

At first, it looked like it was suffering from leukoplakia. Most of the areas on its back turned white and even had a jade- like luster. Soon, all the tentacles and even the body in the electromagnetic storm turned into white jade.

It wasn’t just the tentacle monster. The strange fish was experiencing the same thing. Large amounts of white spots appeared on its tail before rapidly spreading out, spreading from its tail to its body.

It was obvious that the strange fish had been trying its best to escape the white contagion, but its strength failed to stop anything. Soon, its entire body was dyed white, turning into a jade-like white fish.

“Things aren’t looking good!” Xiao frowned. “Don’t tell me those two fellows…” Before Jiuyang could finish his sentence, he saw the tentacle monster and the strange fish let out strange cries at the same time. They came to the Companion Beast’s side like a monster version of two sidekicks.

Xiao and Jiuyang exchanged looks. They knew that things were going south. Among the five Calamity creatures, two Heaven-level creatures were controlled by the Companion Beast.

“As expected of an existence that can parasitize the interior of a planet,” Xiao sighed. He never believed that it was an easy task to complete. The Companion Beast was forced to be born before it had fully developed. It had even escaped the capture of many experts during the deity battle and parasitized the planet. Xiao didn’t believe that such an existence could be easily killed.
