Chapter 1514 My Sword Is Very Slow

“Coach, take a break. There’s no need for you to take action against such a goon,” Ming Xiu said as he walked forward.

Ming Xiu knew from watching that Berserker Immortal led the group of five. Since Berserker Immortal hadn’t personally taken action, Ming Xiu didn’t wish for Zhou Wen to weaken his stance.

Furthermore, after watching Feng Qiuyan’s battle, he felt his hands itch. He also wanted to try out his insights.

Zhou Wen nodded slightly. Ming Xiu stood in front of Calligraphy Immortal and said with a faint smile, “You don’t have to be afraid. Although I studied under Coach, I’m much weaker than the previous guy. My sword is also much slower than his saber. As long as your reaction speed isn’t too bad, you should be able to block it.”

Calligraphy Immortal no longer underestimated his enemy like Painting Immortal. After all, the possibility of another Feng Qiuyan appearing was relatively lowthere couldn’t be many existences among the humans like Feng Qiuyan. It was already impressive for any one of the six families to produce one or two such existences. Zhou Wen was just one man. It was already shocking to have Feng Qiuyan by his side. It was unbelievable that there would be another similar expert around him.

Even so, Calligraphy Immortal didn’t underestimate his enemy. He thought to himself, He and that Feng Qiuyan were taught by Zhou Wen. Although one uses a saber and the other uses a sword, they probably study the same path. They should be focused on speed. Even if he’s bluffing me and his sword techniques are actually faster than Feng Qiuyan’s, I can block his attacks as long as I don’t underestimate my enemy like Painting Immortal…

Calligraphy Immortal thought it through and was about to say something to Ming Xiu when he suddenly saw Ming Xiu draw his sword and thrust forward. The sword was unbelievably fast, almost as fast as Feng Qiuyan’s saber.

Ming Xiu’s sword wasn’t slower than Feng Qiuyan’s saber. In fact, his first few strikes were slightly faster than Feng Qiuyan’s. However, Feng Qiuyan was a battle maniac. The more he fought, the stronger he became. This was a trait Ming Xiu didn’t possess.

If Ming Xiu wanted to defeat Feng Qiuyan, he could only rely on the first few strikes. If he couldn’t defeat Feng Qiuyan after five strikes, there was basically no need for him to continue fighting. He would definitely lose.

When Calligraphy Immortal saw how fast Ming Xiu’s sword was, he couldn’t help but sneer inwardly. No matter how scheming you are, it’s useless in front of absolute strength. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In a split second, Calligraphy Immortal summoned a book. The page opened and faced Ming Xiu’s sword.

Once the sword was clamped by the book, the text in the book would be imprinted on the sword, sealing the power of the sword.

Humans ultimately only know some tricks… Calligraphy Immortal watched as his book was about to grab Ming Xiu’s sword.

Calligraphy Immortal’s eyes widened the next moment. He had clearly calculated the speed and timing. The Book of Seal was just short of clamping Ming Xiu’s sword when he realized that Ming Xiu’s sword was a little slower than he had expected. He had already closed his book, but Ming Xiu’s sword hadn’t arrived.

It was too late for Calligraphy Immortal to open the pages again. The sword that looked a beat slower suddenly experienced a speed burst and flashed like a stream of light.

Pfft!

Ming Xiu’s sword stabbed into Calligraphy Immortal’s chest as the latter watched helplessly as the sword penetrated him, his body failing to dodge. This was because his strength was limited by the ancient corpse, preventing him from unleashing his fastest speed. He couldn’t dodge the strike that was so close to him.

Ming Xiu’s successful strike instantly made him retreat gracefully. It was like a pleasing piece of art.

Calligraphy Immortal had intended to severely injure Ming Xiu while taking the blow, but he wasn’t given the chance. Ming Xiu had already retreated, leaving only the wound on his chest.

Although his wound looked terrifying, no blood flowed out due to the lack of blood in the ancient corpse. Zhou Wen and company had already noticed this when Feng Qiuyan injured Painting Immortal.

“Thank you for thinking so highly of me. I’ve already said that my sword is very slow. You don’t have to be so fast. Just slow down and you’ll be able to block it,” Ming Xiu said coolly as he sheathed his sword.

Calligraphy Immortal was even more depressed than Painting Immortal from before. At the very least, he had used his Art of Cage Etching, but he hadn’t used any of his abilities. He had lost for no reason.

Apart from being depressed, Calligraphy Immortal and company were even more surprised.

Without a doubt, Ming Xiu was also a most talented and top-notch human like Feng Qiuyan. However, such human powerhouses were top-notch existences among the other major factions on Earth.

For example, Ya from the Holy Spirit Association and Immortal from the League of Guardians. These were existences that even the dimension knew of.

Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan couldn’t be much weaker even if they were weaker than Ya and Immortal. Even Berserker Immortal found it unbelievable that such people were Zhou Wen’s students.

They originally imagined that Zhou Wen was the weakest amongst Wang Mingyuan’s disciples. After all, Zhou Wen was alone, and the others had their own massive factions.

However, from the looks of it, just Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan had made Zhou Wen a faction that couldn’t be underestimated.

“Interesting.” Only then did Berserker Immortal seriously size up Zhou Wen.

Although Berserker Immortal hadn’t advanced to the Apocalypse grade, he had once defeated an Apocalypse-grade creature. He indeed looked down on Zhou Wen and Earth’s strength and qualifications.

Berserker Immortal originally wanted a puppet. He wasn’t too interested in Zhou Wen as a person.

But now, Berserker Immortal had no choice but to seriously examine Zhou Wen. To be able to produce students like Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan, Zhou Wen’s strength seemed to be severely incongruent with the intelligence he had previously obtained.

The four immortals looked at each other, momentarily at a loss.

Before coming here, they didn’t even think much of Zhou Wen, believing that anyone could suppress him.

However, two Immortals had already been defeated by Zhou Wen’s students. Even though their strength was suppressed, they still felt humiliated.

Zither Immortal and Chess Immortal hesitated and didn’t take action. Calligraphy and Painting Immortal weren’t weaker than them. They couldn’t even defeat Zhou Wen’s students, so how could Zither and Chess Immortal dare challenge him?

They had witnessed Zhou Wen using his Companion Beast to kill the white snake with their own eyes. Their bodies weren’t any stronger than the white snake’s. If the ancient corpses were destroyed, exposing them to Earth, their bodies would suffer serious injuries.

The four immortals couldn’t help but cast their gazes at Berserker Immortal. After all, this trip was mainly led by him. They were only assisting him, so they had to wait for him to make the decision.

Berserker Immortal looked at Zhou Wen and company. He wasn’t as depressed as the four immortals. Instead, he was somewhat excited.

The stronger the people around Zhou Wen were, the faster he could establish a new Immortal faction after they came under his control. The strength Zhou Wen and company displayed was almost comparable to the League of Guardians.

I want these people for sure. Berserker Immortal stared at Zhou Wen with a burning gaze.
