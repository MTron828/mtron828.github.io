Chapter 826: Fine Dust

It was a purple star that resembled a particle. It emitted a resplendent divine light that floated between Zhou Wen’s brows like a gem.

Life Soul: Fine Dust (Primordial Body)

Fine Dust: Millions of galaxies are just the dust of the boundless universe. A tiny speck of dust can also be a trichiliocosm.

Zhou Wen looked at the Fine Dust Life Soul and felt its body emit powerful stellar forces. A tiny bit of information surged into Zhou Wen’s mind, allowing him to gain a rough understanding of Fine Dust.

Although it was called Fine Dust, it was actually a miniature star. With the Fine Dust Life Soul and the Pocket Universe Life Providence, Zhou Wen could travel through space.

This was somewhat similar to the ability of Civilized Country. The difference was that the Fine Dust Life Soul could only be used to travel between planets. As long as there were stars in the Pocket Universe, Zhou Wen could use Fine Dust’s ability to travel to that planet.

For example, planets that were relatively close to Earth like the Moon, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, as well as the planets in the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions, or even planets that were even further away. As long as they were within the Pocket Universe, he could teleport over using Fine Dust.

However, Fine Dust had a longer cooldown period. It could only be used once a month.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to try heading to the moon to take a look, but on second thought, he immediately gave up on such plans. His current body didn’t have the ability to survive in space. He could only teleport once a month. If he were to teleport out now, he wouldn’t be able to return. If that happened, wouldn’t he die of suffocation in space?

Fine Dust’s ability looks impressive, but it doesn’t seem to be of much use. This thing can only be used for interstellar travel and doesn’t allow free teleportation within a planet. However, humans have yet to discover any habitable planets outside Earth. Wouldn’t teleporting to them be courting death? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.

However, thankfully, apart from the interstellar teleportation ability, Fine Dust also had enhancement effects on Speed, Strength, and Essence Energy. On a bright night with stars, he could also enjoy the augmentation of the stellar forces.

It could also be done during the day, but because the sunlight during the day was too strong, the augmentation from the other stars weakened. The main augmentation came from the sun.

Thankfully, after advancing to the Mythical stage, typically speaking, one should have the ability to survive in space. This ability would definitely be of great use in the future.

This was the basic function of Fine Dust. Zhou Wen still needed to figure out the other methods and abilities himself.

How can I advance Fine Dust? Zhou Wen continued studying the method to advance his Fine Dust Life Soul.

After entering the game, Zhou Wen tried out Fine Dust’s interstellar teleportation ability. It was really effective. The Fine Dust on his forehead flashed with a purple light as it took him across more than half the Pocket Universe to a tiny planet that he had never been to.

Then, he entered cooldown mode and had to wait a month until he could use it again.

This cooldown time is too long! Interstellar teleportation felt great, but it could only be used once a month. It was too much of a scam.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on using it in real life. If he had used it in a rush, it would have been too late when he realized he had to wait for a month.

After studying his Life Soul in-game for a long time, he didn’t find any way to level up Fine Dust. The method of observing the Pocket Universe to condense a Life Soul clearly wasn’t of any help to Fine Dust.

“Zhou Wen, are you coming to the auction?” Zhang Yuzhi sent Zhou Wen a message.

“Of course,” Zhou Wen replied.

Although Civilization Country could also teleport, the restrictions were too great. An Earth Escape mount was more useful. Even if he failed to win the bid, he could still broaden his horizons.

It wasn’t usually easy to see the six families together.

“Remember to inform me before you arrive. I’ll arrange a place for you to stay. There are too many people participating in the auction this time, so it’s not convenient for you to stay outside. You can stay in my family’s courtyard,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen didn’t plan on standing on ceremony. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

It was rare for Zhang Yuzhi to chat with him for a while, but it didn’t last more than ten minutes before there was suddenly no message. It was as though she had gone offline.

Could she be using her phone behind her family’s back? Zhou Wen thought of this possibility.

To the Zhang family, Zhang Yuzhi was too important. Her every action was closely protected by them. Many things were out of her control.

From the looks of it, it’s not necessarily a good thing to be too special. People like Zhang Yuzhi and Wang Lu have abilities that others dream of, but they might not necessarily be happy, Zhou Wen thought.

In the morning, Zhou Wen took Ya’er out for a stroll. Zhou Wen took the time to take her out every morning to interact more with human society.

Sunset College also had students who had children, but they were basically graduate students. He was probably the first sophomore to have a child.

Thankfully, everyone in school knew of Zhou Wen’s relationship with Ouyang Lan, so no one said anything.

Zhou Wen led her to the activity room of the Xuanwen Club. When Fang Ruoxi saw her, she pointed at Ya’er’s clothes and said, “Zhou Wen, Ya’er’s clothes seem to be small. It’s time to buy her new clothes.”

Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the clothes on Ya’er’s body were indeed a little small. Children grew very quickly. In just a month, she had grown quite a lot.

“You’re still a boy. How can you take good care of Ya’er? Why don’t you hire a nanny to take care of her?” Fang Ruoxi suggested.

“There’s no need. I’ll slowly learn how to take care of her.” Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t let others take care of Ya’er. Who knew what would happen?

“Old Zhou, could Ya’er really be your daughter?” Tian Xiangdong asked.

“It would be good if that was the case.” Zhou Wen was somewhat helpless.

If Ya’er was really his daughter, Zhou Wen could still get Ouyang Lan to help him take care of her. Unfortunately, no matter how troublesome it was, Zhou Wen had no choice but to take care of her himself.

“How old is this girl? My relative’s child is a little younger than her, but she can already call her parents. Why can’t she say a word? Didn’t you teach her?” Tian Xiangdong teased Ya’er as he spoke. “Ya’er, call Uncle... Uncle...”

Ya’er sat on the stool and looked at Tian Xiangdong without any change in expression. Tian Xiangdong felt like a fool. He laughed dryly and stopped teasing her.

“Ya’er, wait for me here for a while. Don’t mess around, alright?” Zhou Wen wanted to go to the bathroom and couldn’t take Ya’er with him. He believed that it would be fine to let her stay here.

Before leaving, Zhou Wen even exhorted Fang Ruoxi to help take care of Ya’er and not let anyone tease her.

Not long after Zhou Wen left, someone came to the activity room. He couldn’t help but be taken aback when he saw Ya’er sitting on a stool.

“Why is there a child here?” the person asked.
