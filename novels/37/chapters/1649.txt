Chapter 1650 Both Pets Fighting

As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he saw the Companion Beast charge at the bee again. It had fused Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal and Xiao’s Trajectory movement technique together, making it unbelievably fast. Wherever it passed, it left behind afterimages in the void.

In the blink of an eye, the Companion Beast arrived in front of the bee again and threw a punch at it.

Halfway through, its fist split into dozens. Like split tentacles, they struck the bee from different directions.

Every split fist carried extremely potent Sun God Light. It was as though dozens of cold suns were striking the bee from different directions.

This fellow is a freak. It even learned the electromagnetic monster’s ability. Zhou Wen didn’t know the limits of the Companion Beast. In any case, it appeared capable of learning any ability.

It would be even more terrifying if it mastered the bee’s trumpet blowing ability. Beep!

The suona suddenly sounded in an earth-shattering manner. The fists were about to hit the bee, but the Companion Beast’s body seemed to suffer a heavy blow as it flew out with a bang.

The dozens of fists that split apart constantly exploded. Likewise, the body kept exploding as if it were filled with explosives

Zhou Wen was already very far from the battlefield, but the sound of the suona immediately stirred the Essence Energy in his body like a nuclear reactor that was close to meltdown.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen was relatively far from the battlefield. Furthermore, the Teacher Domain had played a role. He forcefully suppressed the violent Essence Energy in his body. Otherwise, he might have exploded like the Companion Beast.

What’s that trumpet? It’s too terrifying! Zhou Wen stared at the suona the bee had placed by its mouth in envy.

Even the Companion Beast that was almost invincible at the Calamity grade was blown up by it. The might of the suona was terrifying.

Zhou Wen felt that it made sense when he thought about it. During the battle of the gods, there were countless terrifying experts who fought their way into the cosmos. The creatures who could participate in such battles were definitely the cream of the crop in that mythical era.

The things they brought with them were naturally extraordinary. Furthermore, despite having gone missing for so many years, Holy God was still eyeing it. It was obvious how precious it was.

However, Zhou Wen failed to figure out what powerful divine artifact was a suona in myths.

Bang! Bang!

As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he suddenly heard an explosion nearby. He saw the white and black Horned Wolves rush out of the underground cave. Just as they left the cave, their bodies exploded, turning into a bloody mist that filled the sky.

When they were in the planet’s interior, the sonar attacks they suffered were weaker. They could barely rely on the barrier they combined to survive.

However, they wanted to escape. After leaving the underground cave, they were attacked by the sound. Their bodies couldn’t withstand it and immediately exploded.

Zhou Wen’s sharp eyes noticed that two crystal-like Companion Eggs dropped from the black and white wolves’ blood mist. His eyes immediately lit up.

The suona had already reached its final note. The sound waves produced weakened as Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to instant transmit over. He grabbed the two Companion Eggs-one in each hand-and instant transmitted back.

He didn’t wish to leave just like that. Even if Tsukuyomi had already encountered misfortune, he had to see her corpse to leave in peace.

When Zhou Wen went to snatch the Companion Egg, he saw the strange fish rush out of the underground cave. It charged at the bee fearlessly.

Elsewhere, Jiuyang and Xiao crawled out. They were bleeding from their seven orifices. The situation didn’t look good.

“Retreat!” Xiao shouted softly as he attempted to use the Trajectory technique to escape into the void.

Neither of these two Companion Beasts were to be trifled with. Even if he joined forces with Zhou Wen and Jiuyang, they wouldn’t be able to gain any advantage. They might even lose their lives.

Jiuyang also planned on rushing out of the atmosphere. Space greatly restricted sound transmission.

The bee clearly wasn’t interested in them as it kept staring at the exploding Companion Beast. Just as the Companion Beast’s body was about to be blasted apart, the blasted body quickly reformed and the wounds vanished. This was the electromagnetic monster’s ability. However, the effects were even more ridiculous when used by the Companion Beast.

The strange fish had already arrived above the bee. Its tail transformed into a cloth that blotted out the sky as it swept down to envelop the bee.

Zhou Wen imagined that the bee was about to blow its suona again as he retreated at high speeds, hoping to get further away.

However, to his surprise, the bee didn’t blow the suona. A cold glimmer flashed around its tail as Zhou Wen saw the cold beam pierce through the strange fish’s tail and penetrate its body. After being controlled by the Companion Beast, the strange fish’s white jade-like body instantly turned black. Then, it collapsed and turned into dust.

Zhou Wen’s vision was in no way inferior to a Calamity-grade expert. Furthermore, with Truth Listener’s help, he could clearly see the strange fish’s body disintegrate into extremely tiny black particles. After the black particles scattered, they disintegrated again, preventing Zhou Wen from seeing them. This thing... Don’t tell me it’s a poison-type... Zhou Wen thought of his Doctor Darkness Companion Beast. Doctor Darkness relied on absorbing poison to evolve. He had recently advanced to the Terror grade, but he hadn’t found any stronger poison to advance him to the Calamity grade.

If this bee was really a poison-type creature, it meant that the toxin it had used was extremely terrifying. It was unknown what would happen if Doctor Darkness were to absorb it.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if it was a poison-type power. Even if it was, he didn’t know if the Terror-grade Doctor Darkness could withstand such a terrifying poison.

After all, even a Heaven-level creature was poisoned to death from a single stab. The Terror-grade Doctor Darkness might disintegrate before advancing to the Calamity grade. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“It’s no good. This planet seems to be locked onto by some force. We can’t leave.” Xiao and Jiuyang’s expressions were abnormally ugly. They had attempted to escape, but they couldn’t.

The entire planet seemed to be sealed by some strange force. Even Xiao’s void trajectory power didn’t allow for escape.

Elsewhere, the Companion Beast that had already healed pounced at the bee again. Clearly, it wanted to snatch the suona controlled by the bee.

The bee seemed to know that its poison needle was useless against the Companion Beast. It might even be absorbed and learned by the Companion Beast. Therefore, it didn’t use the method used against the strange fish to deal with it. Instead, it played the suona again.

This time, the sound was somewhat different from before. Although it was equally loud, it also made one feel a sense of sorrow that resembled sobbing.

This tune... Zhou Wen knew that it was the bubble music he had heard many times by the pool.
