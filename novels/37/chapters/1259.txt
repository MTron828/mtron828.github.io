Chapter 1260: Spacetime Bandit

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen held the two golden guns in hand as he constantly shot at the spot Demonic Neonate indicated, but none of the bullets hit the target.

Not only was his opponent invisible, but he also didn’t seem to have a corporeal body. As he constantly attacked, Zhou Wen felt as though he was fighting the air.

However, the other party’s attack had a powerful destructive force. If Demonic Neonate hadn’t helped Zhou Wen determine the location of the adversary, he probably would have suffered countless heavy blows.

Since the golden guns of three different attributes were useless, Zhou Wen put away the golden guns and summoned the Son of Heaven’s Three Swords and Asura Saber to continue fighting the air.

Zhou Wen originally hoped that the Son of Heaven’s Sword would be able to play a special role, but he regretfully realized that it couldn’t injure his opponent.

As the battle continued, Zhou Wen suddenly felt his hand sink. The Asura Saber’s blade seemed to slice through something. Then, Zhou Wen realized that red blood had appeared on the blade..

It hit??Zhou Wen was pleasantly surprised.

However, when he focused his gaze, he didn’t find any traces of his opponent. The blood on the blade quickly vanished as though it had never existed.

Zhou Wen immediately began to think about why the Asura Saber had suddenly struck the target. It had previously slashed at least a thousand times, but not once had it hit. Why had it worked that one time?

Coincidence? Clearly not.

Could it be the Luck and Fortune stat of Deva Asura??The first thing Zhou Wen thought of was naturally Deva Asura’s most special ability.

However, after careful thought, he felt that it might not be that simple. Luck would only produce a certain chance of injuring the opponent.

As for this opponent’s body, it was as though it didn’t exist. He couldn’t even slash at it, so there was naturally no question about hitting it.

It’s not the effect of the Luck stat. Could it be the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay??Zhou Wen immediately thought of another possibility.

Deva Asura had the ability of the Greater and Lesser Deva’s Five Signs of Decay. Although Zhou Wen had never discovered any use for these two abilities when it was in the Asura Saber state, Zhou Wen felt that it was very likely that these two abilities had played a role, causing him to injure the nonexistent enemy.

After a while, Zhou Wen struck again. This time, it took even less time than before. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Zhou Wen was increasingly certain that the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay had some effect. Otherwise, if he were to rely on luck, the chances would be about the same without much deviation.

Now, Zhou Wen clearly felt that it was becoming easier and easier for him to slash his opponent. It was highly likely that the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay had taken effect on him.

As Zhou Wen slashed more times, although he still couldn’t see the strange creature, he could sense that it was becoming weaker and weaker.

Finally, when Zhou Wen slashed down again, there was a tragic cry as a creature collapsed in a pool of blood on the ground. Half its head had been chopped off.

Zhou Wen carefully sized it up and realized that the creature wasn’t as big as he imagined. It was only about two meters tall. Its lower body was that of a horse, while its upper body was that of a human. Its arms were blades, and its entire body was metal. And inside his body, there were many mechanical gears and components. It looked strange and mysterious, giving off the feeling of a mechanical creature.

He brandished his saber and slashed at the creature’s corpse. The metal body couldn’t withstand the sharpness of the Asura Saber. All sorts of mechanical parts dropped and Zhou Wen quickly discovered a dimensional crystal.

It was a strange metal crystal. Its shape was like a metal pocket watch with a spinning minute hand.

Zhou Wen used his phone to snap a picture and immediately saw its information.

Spacetime Bandit Dimensional Crystal: Terror

Requirements: Temporal Terror transformation, Spatial Terror transformation, Constitution 81, Essence Energy 81, Strength 81, Speed 81

So this fellow is called Spacetime Bandit. It’s at the Terror-grade of the dual-elemental powers of time and space. I wonder what kind of skill this skill crystal will be. Could it be an ability that makes it impossible to be sensed or seen? Unfortunately, I don’t have a Temporal Terror transformation… Wait… I might… If I can use the Demon God Body and the Godfiend Era at the same time, I can use the Demon God Body to become a temporal creature. Together with the spatial powers of the Demon God Era, can I meet the requirements??Zhou Wen looked at the corpse of the Spacetime Bandit on the ground.

The Demon God Body could only simulate living creatures. There was no way to simulate the dead.

I’ll definitely encounter a temporal creature when I enter the Time Hut later. I’ll give it a try when the time comes.?Without sensing any other danger, Zhou Wen released Ice Maiden and company.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t let Philo out to prevent her from rashly entering the Time Hut to find Lucas.

Zhou Wen also wanted to save Lucas, but if he entered without confidence, not only would he be in danger, but he would also waste more time.

It was Zhou Wen’s style to think before acting. He believed that it wasn’t because he was afraid of death.

“Do you know what this is?” Zhou Wen pointed at the Spacetime Bandit on the ground and asked Ice Maiden and Grim Demon.

“I don’t know. I’ve never seen such a creature before, nor have I heard of one.” Ice Maiden and Grim Demon said that they had never seen it before. They had never even heard of the Spacetime Bandit.

Zhou Wen saw that the Spacetime Bandit was very special. Furthermore, his corpse didn’t vanish like a typical creature. It was as though his body had already undergone Terror transformation and all the parts were Terror items.

This was very similar to the Ice Dragon King. It was rare among Terror creatures, making it rather special.

He summoned all the Companion Beasts he thought highly of and let them see if anyone was interested in these Terror items.

Demonic Neonate clearly wasn’t interested in the pile of metal components and fragments, and among the evolvable Companion Beasts, Truth Listener and Banana Fairy didn’t react either.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, Explosive Fiend Man became interested in the Terror-transformed metal parts. He walked in front of one of the components and picked it up. He gestured at it as though he wanted to put it on himself.

After gesturing for a long time, he still couldn’t fit it in.

When Zhou Wen saw this, he decided to send the pile of parts and Explosive Fiend Man into the Chaos Bead and let him slowly mess around with them. It might even produce something.

With all this time passing, the Time Hut dungeon had long been downloaded. However, the Time Hut’s name in the game wasn’t Time Hut, but Sweetie’s Wooden Hut.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to care what it was called. After summoning Ice Maiden and Grim Demon back, he immediately activated the dungeon and entered the game.

The blood-colored avatar entered the wooden hut. The scene he saw was similar to the information he had found online. In the tiny wooden hut, there was a wooden table, wooden chair, wooden bed, and a wooden horse. It looked like a wooden hut for children.
