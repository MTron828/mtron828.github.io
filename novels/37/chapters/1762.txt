Chapter 1763 His Brother

What is Zhong Ziya trying to do? Zhou Wen frowned slightly.

Zhong Ziya had always been at odds with the dimension. Others wanted to become Guardians or representatives, but his organization was hunting Guardians and representatives. This time, he had actually taken the initiative to show his face and clear the level. Wasn’t he afraid that the dimension would target him?

Zhong Ziya and Jiang Yan were two extremes. Jiang Yan was willing to come into contact with the dimension by learning from them, but Zhong Ziya believed that Guardians and alien representatives were no different from traitors who should be killed quickly.

Zhou Wen wasn’t that extreme. Between Guardians and representatives, there were some that deserved killing and others that didn’t. There was no generalization.

Upon seeing another human attempt the level, everyone immediately became excited. With so many humans clearing the level in a row, the gloom that had enveloped their hearts over the past few days was lifted.

They were all discussing who this person was. Not many people had seen Zhong Ziya’s true face, but there were many who knew the name “Ya.” They just couldn’t associate Ya with Zhong Ziya.

Zhong Ziya wasn’t like the previous challengers. He didn’t fly in the air but landed on the lake. Only then did people realize that he wasn’t wearing any shoes. His bare feet stepped on the lake, causing the surface to ripple slightly.

This man… is so beautiful… Many women and even men watching the livestream couldn’t help but have this thought flash through their minds.

Previously, Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan were undoubtedly rare handsome men, but their handsomeness had some traces of youth. Although Zhong Ziya wasn’t old, he had an indescribable beauty.

It was feral, mature, sexy, and even somewhat charming. Just him standing there made one feel their hormones screaming. To exaggerate, if he were a cat, just passing by would be enough to make a female cat on the roadside go into heat.

He was beautiful, but not feminine. He was seductive, but not gaudy. Furthermore, he had a strong dangerous aura. Many women found it difficult to move their eyes away from him.

Pulling out the sword!

As people admired Zhong Ziya’s face, he pulled out the sword on his shoulder.

The unsheathing and sheathing of the sword was done in a swift, fluid manner. It allowed one to see it clearly. However, upon careful inspection, the sword had already returned to its scabbard and was still casually placed on his shoulder.

Many people couldn’t understand what Zhong Ziya’s casual strike was about.

He has grown too quickly. Zhou Wen sighed.

In the past, Zhong Ziya’s sword techniques were wild. Zhou Wen found such a sword art very strong, but it didn’t pose him any danger.

Now, Zhong Ziya’s sword technique looked reserved, but it made Zhou Wen feel extreme danger.

If the Zhong Ziya in the past was a ferocious devil that made people afraid just by looking at him, then the present him was an elegant and beautiful devil in hell.

It looked harmless, but it had the ability to make one wish they were dead.

After the strike, Zhong Ziya slowly walked barefooted on the surface of the lake without sinking like the people who had previously failed.

Splash!

Not long after Zhong Ziya walked over, the water where he was standing churned as a huge object floated up from the water.

The object was like a crystal-like octopus. Every tentacle was dozens of meters long and it was covered in suction cups. Its entire body was transparent.

It was likely the culprit behind pulling people to the bottom of the lake.

However, it was now floating-a clear sign that it was dead. There was a sword mark that was as thin as a strand of hair on its head. It didn’t look long. If one didn’t look carefully, they wouldn’t discover the existence of the sword mark.

However, it had died just like that. Instantly, the people watching the livestream were dumbfounded. Their mouths gaped open for a long time.

“This man is truly perfect. He’s beautiful and valiant. If I can marry him, I can die in

peace.”

“If I could marry him, I’d be willing to live ten years less.”

“I don’t need to marry him. I would accept death if I could sleep with him once.”

Just like how men admired beautiful women, women also liked to admire beautiful men. Zhong Ziya was undoubtedly a rare and charming man, so it was no wonder they were like this.

Most men were wondering who this man was. His sword was casual, not as ingenious as Ming Xiu’s, nor was it as domineering as Qin Zhen’s. But now that they thought about it, his sword was even more terrifying. Just looking at it gave them goosebumps.

This was the first time someone had killed the monster in the lake, and it was also the first time people had seen the monster.

However, no one was in the mood to study what monster it was. Everyone’s eyes were attracted by the unique man, eager to know who he was.

In particular, the members of the six families were about to go crazy.

The appearance of Ming Xiu, Feng Qiuyan, and Qin Zhen had already made them feel a strong sense of danger. Now, not only did this man make them feel a sense of danger, but they also urgently wanted to know who this man was.

Everyone stared at Zhong Ziya as he proceeded through the fog. He casually walked step by step and soon, he passed through the fog and stepped ashore. The golden fruit tree was right in front of him.

Zhong Ziya walked to the bottom of the golden fruit tree and held the sword on his shoulder with one hand. He extended his other hand and casually plucked a golden apple.

“This…”

Previously, Ming Xiu’s first strike hadn’t been able to slice off the golden apple, but Zhong Ziya had casually plucked it. Such an ability left one speechless for a description.

The scene changed and became the Cube’s ranking. Although many women felt that they had not seen enough and wanted to take a few more glances at Zhong Ziya, they also wanted to know who this man was.

The moment the ranking appeared, everyone looked at the top for some reason. Although there was no way to explain why, everyone believed that he should be ranked there.

Indeed, the first name on the ranking changed. When people saw the name clearly, they were dumbfounded.

“Zhou Wen’s brother!” Someone couldn’t help but recite.

The words were very simple. There was a name in it, but everyone knew that the owner of this name wasn’t the devil-like handsome man.

“Has Zhou’s people finished taking all the elites of the mortal world?”

“No wonder he’s so awesome… He’s Ming Xiu’s uncle!”

“The Zhous… are amazing…” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“How can this be? Are the Zhous going to dominate the rankings?” “How can you blame the Zhous for dominating the rankings? It’s clearly those cowards from the other families who don’t dare to make an attempt.”

As people were discussing crazily, the Cube lit up again. Another person was attempting the level, and it was another human. The first thought in everyone’s minds was: Could this be another member of the Zhous?
