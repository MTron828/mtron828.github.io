Chapter 1104: Kicking Again

Translator: CKtalon

Everyone saw this strike clearly. Even the media broadcast didn’t need to use slow-motion replays to see it clearly.

However, this didn’t mean that the strike wasn’t fast. On the contrary, not only was it fast, but it also gave off that indomitable and unyielding feeling.

Elegance was the word to describe the beauty of its gentleness, while unyielding described the beauty of masculinity. These were two extremes that shouldn’t have been used to describe the same thing at the same time.

However, Zhou Wen’s strike had perfectly fused the two opposing beauties into one. It gave off an elegant yet sharp feeling.

What was even stranger was that everyone saw the slash clearly. Blood Shaman and the eight Guardians also saw it clearly.

However, for some reason, they saw all the minute movements of this move, but their bodies didn’t seem to obey their orders. They watched helplessly as the white wooden club slashed at their necks, but their bodies couldn’t react or do anything.

Seven heads were beheaded almost at the same time. Only Blood Shaman’s body emitted a sanguine glow as blood spewed out from his body. He transformed into a blood shadow and flew away, instantly admitting defeat and leaving the arena.

The originally noisy arena immediately fell silent, leaving only the sounds of the heads and corpses of the seven Mythical Guardians falling to the ground.

And in front of the cubes around the world, it was even quieter than the arena.

Everyone’s expressions changed from shock to pleasant surprise, then to wild joy. After a moment of silence, cheers resounded into the sky.

“He’s so powerful... He killed seven Guardians ranked in the top ten in one strike and even severely injured the Terror-grade Blood Shaman, forcing it to admit defeat. This is too sick...”

“I’ve never seen such a terrifying move. When I saw that slash, I thought I would be sliced into two.”

“If a divine technique can even make a Terror-grade Guardian flee, who can match it? First place will definitely be Human’s.”

“In theory, Human’s definitely number one, but who knows what other cheap tricks those b*stards from the dimension will pull.”

“I’m just afraid that those fellows will deal with Human like they dealt with Ya. If that happens, no matter how strong Human is, it’ll be impossible to obtain first place.”

...

As everyone discussed fervently, Di Tian’s eyes were filled with surprise.

“What a powerful move. Thankfully, he’s only at the Mythical stage. If he were at the Terror grade, even Blood Shaman probably wouldn’t have been able to escape death.” The woman continued in surprise, “Once Blood Shaman is defeated, who can match him?”

“There’s no need.” Di Tian shook his head and said, “The monarchs of the various races have already come to a conclusion. They are going to use the cube’s rules to kick him out.”

The woman heaved a long sigh of relief and said, “That’s for the best. I didn’t expect there to be an outcome so quickly.”

Di Tian said coldly, “They know very well that the Dimensional Wheel can never land in the hands of humans. That strike just now was the main reason they made the decision so quickly.”

With that said, Di Tian stood up. As the host of the cube battle, after obtaining the permission of the various races, he could activate the cube’s rules and kick Zhou Wen out.

However, this method of kicking wasn’t a proper process. Di Tian had to personally arrive in front of the cube before he could change the rules and kick Zhou Wen out.

However, he didn’t immediately head to the cube. Instead, he summoned a warrior from the Celestial Gods and asked, “How’s the progress of the Body Cleansing Stone?”

“We’ve already obtained it. We’re escorting it back,” the warrior answered.

“Get them to send the Body Cleansing Stone directly to the cube.” As Di Tian spoke, he walked towards the cube.

...

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. The might of the Immortal Slaying Strike exceeded his imagination. He originally wanted to kill Blood Shaman, but he had never expected to slay the seven Guardians together.

However, this wasn’t the main reason for Zhou Wen’s surprise. What truly surprised him was that the Immortal Culling Sword that Zhou Wen had kept beside him hadn’t reacted previously, but when he used Immortal Slaying, the Immortal Culling Sword had reacted.

No one challenged him again. Everyone was frightened by the seven Guardians’ corpses. Unless a Terror-grade expert appeared, no one would dare to challenge Zhou Wen.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t leave the arena. He knew that the dimension definitely wouldn’t let the matter rest after his huge commotion and his killing of seven Guardians in one strike. He was afraid that he would soon receive the same treatment as Ya.

As Zhou Wen expected, just as everyone was still immersed in the unbelievable strike of Human, they suddenly saw the black cube glow brightly as the entire arena’s space distorted.

The “Human” word in first place was gradually disappearing.

“Screw you. Again.”

“I knew those bastards would use this move again. If they can’t beat him, they’ll just kick him.”

Everyone immediately knew what had happened. They were even more furious, but they could only watch as the number one “Human” on the rankings gradually vanished.

Zhou Wen felt a strange power descend on him as though it wanted to sever something from his body. The power couldn’t be seen or touched, and the thing it slashed wasn’t Zhou Wen’s body. If an ordinary person couldn’t sense it, they would have been kicked out.

However, Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny had been engraved with the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. Its power played its role, allowing Zhou Wen to sense the strange power.

At the same time, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder was activated by the power. The scripture book that had been closed automatically opened.

This development left Zhou Wen slightly taken aback. He had never seen such a change when he was at the Epic stage, nor had he seen the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder open.

The terrifying power was absorbed by the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. It was just like when Zhou Wen entered a dimensional zone and encountered a taboo power.

The entire Heaven-Opening Scripture emitted scorching energy. What was different from before was that if the taboo power the Heaven-Opening Scripture could withstand exceeded its limits, it would spread out and be borne by Zhou Wen’s body.

This time, nothing like that happened. The energy didn’t radiate. Instead, it gradually condensed on the page of the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, forming a sutra symbol.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what the sutra symbol meant, but he could vaguely comprehend its true meaning. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

With the appearance of the sutra symbol, the mark of the Wheel of Destiny that should have vanished in a short period of time didn’t disappear for a long time. It remained on the Wheel of Destiny.

Many people cursed at the shamelessness of the dimension, believing that Human would be kicked out of the rankings like Ya. However, after the Human word in first place vanished halfway, it didn’t continue disappearing. As for Zhou Wen’s body, he wasn’t kicked out of the arena.

In the arena, Zhou Wen stood in midair as though an invisible force was resisting the distorted force in the arena. No matter how much the force in the arena changed, it failed to kick Zhou Wen out of the arena.

Instead, the remaining half of the human characters on the rankings were glowing. The disappearing strokes were slowly reappearing.

“What’s going on?” Everyone looked at the word ‘Human’ on the rankings in surprise and delight. They all held their breaths as though they were afraid that they would blow the word away if they were so much as to exhale.
