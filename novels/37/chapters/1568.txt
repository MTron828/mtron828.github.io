Chapter 1569: Here Comes the Companion Beast

A Companion Egg dropped from Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s shattered body. Zhou Wen immediately saw the Companion Egg thanks to his good eyesight. He got the Tiger Soul General to grab it and return to his side.

“A Calamity-grade Companion Egg!” Many people watching the live broadcast were dumbfounded.

“There’s no justice in this world. He already has such a powerful Companion Beast, but now, he has Starlord Ravenous Wolf drop. Could it be like that old adage, the rich get richer?”

“Damn it, why would a Companion Egg drop! Why is Zhou Wen so lucky with Companion Beasts! Among the top human powerhouses, he’s probably the only one who can fight simply using Companion Beasts.” Xia Liuchuan also wailed.

Zhang Chunqiu smiled and said, “This is fate. You can’t be envious.”

“A Starlord Ravenous Wolf Companion Beast. Professor Gu, this should be the first Calamity-grade Companion Egg that the Federation’s citizens know of, right?” Su Yi asked Professor Gu.

Professor Gu still seemed to be in a daze. Only when he heard Su Yi’s question did he snap to his senses. He said expressionlessly, “It’s indeed the first Calamity-grade Companion Egg that the Federation citizens have seen with their own eyes. However, to people who already have such powerful Companion Beasts, the Starlord Ravenous Wolf Companion Beast can only be considered icing on the cake. That Companion Beast is rather powerful. Not only is it at the Calamity grade, but it’s also not an ordinary one…”

The screen was filled with sarcastic comments while Professor Gu commented.

“Professor Gu, didn’t you insist that the Companion Beast is definitely at the Terror grade?”

“Elder Gu, that’s not what you said just now!”

In Luoyang’s An family, An Sheng said with a look of delight, “Young Master Wen’s Companion Beast luck is really good. He has another Calamity-grade Companion Beast. With just his Companion Beasts, he might be invincible in the Federation.”

“Invincible in the Federation? Don’t speak too soon,” An Tianzuo said with a cold snort. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Li Xuan and company were envious. “Zhou Wen really has it easy when it comes to Companion Beasts.”

“This doesn’t seem easy at all, right?” Female Sword Immortal Qin Zhen said.

“It’s far from easy. Coach is perhaps the only one in the Federation to be capable of defeating two Starlord Ravenous Wolves with only Companion Beasts,” Ming Xiu said with admiration.

Another heated debate about Companion Beasts stirred in the Federation.

In recent years, although people had been using Companion Beasts, people believed that they were ultimately inferior to Guardians. This was because top humans basically used Guardians to fight. Otherwise, they took Mythical Serums. Although Companion Beasts were used, they were not the main force in high-end battles. They only provided support in combat.

It was very rare for someone like Zhou Wen to produce such results purely using a Companion Beast. Or rather, he was the only one at present.

People once again realized that top-notch Companion Beasts weren’t weaker than any creature.

Jiuyang looked at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General with a strange expression.

This was the first time he had seen such a powerful Companion Beast. Although he also had the ability to hunt Calamity-grade creatures, he didn’t focus on hunting dimensional creatures and obtaining Companion Beasts. This was because he always felt that his strength was key. Companion Beasts were like Guardians—external forces.

However, after seeing the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General today, he had to admit that such external forces were indeed a little strong.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to fantasize. He led the Tiger Soul General towards the teleportation nexus and quickly vanished.

When Jiuyang saw Zhou Wen leave, he imagined that he had teleported away, so he wasn’t in the mood to stay any longer. He chose to teleport away and return to the Cube.

However, when Jiuyang looked back at the Cube, he was surprised to discover that Zhou Wen hadn’t left the Star Palace. The Cube’s footage continued. The Chaos Egg and the Tiger Soul General were still on the Cube’s screen.

However, the scene was no longer Dubhe Palace, but another Star Palace he had never seen before.

“What’s that? What’s going on?”

“Another Star Palace. It looks different from Dubhe Palace.”

“Isn’t it over after killing Starlord Ravenous Wolf? Why is there another Star Palace?”

People watched the Cube’s live broadcast in surprise as they guessed what was going on. As for some people with more imagination, they seemed to have guessed what it was.

“Could it be that the dimensional zone this time isn’t just Dubhe Palace, but a serial dimensional zone?”

“No way? In that case, don’t tell me the Big Dipper has a dimensional zone for each star? Only by clearing seven dimensional zones will it be considered true clearance?”

“That must be the case. Do you still remember? After clearing the Venusian dimensional zone, there were Companion Eggs that could be obtained. However, nothing appeared after clearing Dubhe Palace. That means that they didn’t really clear it.”

“This Star Palace is ranked behind Dubhe Palace. It should be Merak Star Palace, right? In that case, the dimensional creature here should be Starlord Titan Gate, right?”

There were still many talents in the Federation. Many people had already guessed it correctly.

However, there were already people who began to worry for Zhou Wen. This was because the Merak Star Palace was an unknown Star Palace. The dimensional creature inside was also unknown.

If Unlucky Egg encountered an accident because he wasn’t familiar with the dimensional creature inside, it wouldn’t be worth it.

“Old Zhang, you’re impressive. Your guess is really accurate. This is indeed a serial dimensional zone. The second Star Palace is undoubtedly Merak.” Xia Liuchuan gave Zhang Chunqiu a thumbs up.

“It’s just basic inference,” Zhang Chunqiu said. “However, isn’t Zhou Wen being a little too rash? The abilities and stats of the dimensional creature in Merak Star Palace are definitely different from Starlord Ravenous Wolf. If he takes the risk to enter, it will be a serious loss for us humans if anything happens.”

Professor Gu also made a similar statement. “This person is clearly letting it get to his head. He thinks that a powerful Companion Beast can resolve all problems. This is a common mistake. Different Companion Beasts should be used against different dimensional creatures…”

While Professor Gu was still explaining in detail, the Tiger Soul General had already rushed through the Merak Star Palace’s door, heading straight into the Star Palace.

Others might not understand Merak Star Palace, but Zhou Wen knew it very well. Starlord Titan Gate was very strong, but he was only equal to Starlord Ravenous Wolf. The Tiger Soul General had already accumulated enough strength. He was much stronger than when he killed Starlord Ravenous Wolf.

The current Tiger Soul General was enough to instantly kill Starlord Titan Gate.

The huge Starlord Titan Gate stood up. His body made the people watching the livestream gasp. Compared to him, the Tiger Soul General was like an ant versus an elephant. It looked much weaker..
