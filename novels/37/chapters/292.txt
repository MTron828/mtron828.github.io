Chapter 293 Echo

The voice grew louder, as if lightning was approaching rapidly.

Boom!

When the sound came out of the stone temple, it was like a thunderclap exploding above everyone’s heads. Zhou Wen felt his ears buzz as though his head was about to split open. His eyes, nose, ears, and mouth bled. He couldn’t hear anything for a moment.

The other people were in no better situation than Zhou Wen. Some of them had already spewed out blood. Even their Companion Beasts were affected. Their expressions turned ghastly as some of them were clearly injured.

However, Lord Alcohol and company covered their ears and remained motionless.

Zhou Wen didn’t dare move when he saw the situation. The sound was odd, but the thunderclap that happened above him nearly knocked him unconscious. Who knew what the consequences would be if he continued talking.

Zhou Wen thought of retreating to the other side of the stone pillar. If he did, he could shout and use that terrifying sound to easily finish off Lord Alcohol and the rest.

Lord Alcohol kept staring at Zhou Wen and company. Seeing the change in Zhou Wen’s eyes, he seemed to have guessed something. He opened his mouth and said something to Zhou Wen, but he didn’t make a sound.

Zhou Wen carefully tried to lip-read and realized that he was saying: “Don’t move. Airflow can also cause echoes. When that happens, all of us will die. If we could run, we’d have run.”

Zhou Wen didn’t know if what he said was true, but seeing how they had no intention to move, he guessed it was true. They would probably have run if they could.

“You can’t stay here forever, right?” Zhou Wen mouthed to Lord Alcohol.

“Wait, in another hour, the echo will disappear,” Lord Alcohol said.

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred when he heard that. Since they Lord Alcohol and company didn’t dare to move, they could still maintain peace. However, once the restriction on them disappeared, Zhou Wen and company might not be their match.

Although Zhou Wen had the banana fan, Lord Alcohol and the rest clearly weren’t weaklings. Even a person like An Sheng had been thrown down the fault. This group couldn’t be underestimated.

Especially a person like Lord Alcohol. He had experienced the dimensional storms before. He was even associated with people like Jing Daoxian and Zhang Daotian. He was definitely not as simple as a haggard old man.

If I don’t teach them a lesson now, the three of us will be at a disadvantage later, Zhou Wen thought to himself.

However, the three of them weren’t immune to the damage from the echo. Finishing off Lord Alcohol and the rest now was equivalent to dooming themselves.

Unfortunately, Truth Listener is still in the midst of its evolution. Otherwise, it would probably have some effect on the echoes. Zhou Wen thought of Truth Listener and looked at the chaos space. It was still in a stone egg form; the completion of its evolution unknown.

Other than Truth Listener, is there no other way? Zhou Wen racked his brains for a way to deal with the echo.

Banana Fairy was definitely not up to the mark. She was an offensive-type Companion Beast, so she didn’t have good defense. Now that they were facing an invisible enemy, it was impossible counterattacking.

Under such circumstances, Doctor Darkness was even more useless. Without an opponent, his ability could not be used.

Ghost Bride might be of some use. As a ghost, she’s probably not afraid of the sonar attack, Zhou Wen thought. Although Ghost Bride wasn’t afraid of the echo, it wasn’t of much help to Zhou Wen. She couldn’t block the echo for them.

Unless the echo is directional. Zhou Wen carefully recalled the details of the echo blast. He felt that although they were relatively far from the stone temple, they didn’t hold any advantage.

The further they went, the louder the echo. They were no different from Lord Alcohol and the rest who were standing in front of the stone temple.

While Zhou Wen was contemplating the matter, he saw Lu Yunxian wink at him and mouth something to him. However, Zhou Wen had been looking at Lord Alcohol and company, so he hadn’t noticed before.

Now that he noticed Lu Yunxian, he could tell from his mouth that he seemed to be saying: “I have a way to withstand the echoes.”

“You can withstand the echoes?” Zhou Wen also mouthed in response to Lu Yunxian. Unfortunately, Lu Yunxian didn’t have the ability to read lips. He kept repeating his words.

Zhou Wen thought about it. Lu Yunxian was quite reliable, so it was unlikely he would lie.

Zhou Wen hesitated for a moment before attempting to walk towards Lu Yunxian. He was only two or three steps away when he immediately heard the rumbling of thunder in the stone temple.

Boom!

A thunderclap boomed, causing Lord Alcohol and company to bleed from their seven orifices. Even the Companion Beasts were no exception. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

As for Zhou Wen and company, they were fine. In front of them was a strange pet that looked like a headless pig. Its body was curvy and oval without a head or tail. It had four hooves growing on it. It looked very strange.

However, such a silly-looking Companion Beast had actually used a strange energy fluctuation to withstand the terrifying sonar blast, preventing the trio from being hit by it.

Zhou Wen’s eyes immediately narrowed as he looked in the direction of Lord Alcohol. The latter wasn’t in a good state to begin with, so when he saw what had happened, his face became even paler.

“Young Master Wen, how about we make a deal?” Lord Alcohol mouthed a request.

“What kind of deal?” Zhou Wen directly asked, immediately causing thunder to rumble from the stone temple. It turned back into an echo that boomed above the stone temple.

Boom! Boom!

Some of the Companion Beasts dropped to the ground. The dozen or so people bled from their seven orifices. The weaker ones had already collapsed to the ground.

These sounds triggered even more echoes. Thunder rumbled outside the stone temple, as if an enraged thunder god kept attacking with echoes.

There were already a few people on Lord Alcohol’s side who were badly bleeding, who knew if they could survive this ordeal. Zhou Wen’s situation wasn’t looking good either. The echo’s powers were too strong, and the strange Companion Beast was trembling. It didn’t seem as if it could last much longer.

Zhou Wen’s eyes darted askew and saw that, instead of retreating, the old fellow chose to harge into the stone temple in spite of the thunderous booms.

“Let’s enter the stone temple.” Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he made Lu Yunxian control the Companion Beast.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that the sound would be even more terrifying when they were nearer the stone temple. However, he realized that the further away he was, the louder the sound was. Although the echo remained terrifying in the stone temple, it wasn’t as terrifying as outside.

Zhou Wen sized up the stone hall and saw that there were many crudely-made stone objects inside. Lord Alcohol continued running for the back door of the stone temple. The echoes left him vomiting blood, but were unable to kill him.
