Chapter 1757 The Elegance of that Strike

“Are you sure you want to see my sword art?” Zhou Wen looked at the girl and asked helplessly.

“Of course, how can I go back on my word? If you want to bet, let’s bet to the end.” The more Zhou Wen was unwilling to force the girl into a corner, the more pumped she became. She only believed that she had grasped Zhou Wen’s weakness.

“Alright, I hope you won’t regret it.” Zhou Wen couldn’t compromise any further, nor did he wish to.

“I definitely won’t regret it,” the girl said

firmly.

Zhou Wen didn’t waste any time. With a wave of his hand, an ordinary sword appeared in his hand.

“What can I do to make you think that my sword art is good enough?” Zhou Wen asked the girl.

“No, it’s not about being good enough. It has to be the same sword art as hers, and it has to be better than hers.” The girl corrected him and continued, “How about this? If you use all your strength to attack me, I can naturally tell if your sword art is better than hers.”

“That won’t do.” Zhou Wen shook his head.

“Why? Are you going back on your word?” the girl mocked.

“Of course not. I’m just afraid that you will go back on your word after losing and refuse to admit it,” Zhou Wen said.

“I’m the dignified… How can I go back on my word? Am I that kind of person?” The girl was immediately enraged.

“I don’t know what kind of person you are. It’s true that someone went back on their word previously.” Zhou Wen looked at the girl as though he was saying: Don’t you know what kind of person you are? The girl wanted to refute, but when she thought of how she seemed to be in the wrong, the words she was about to say changed. “Then what do you want?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Blades and sabers have no eyes, so it’s inevitable that someone will be accidentally injured. There’s no need to draw the sword. How about this? Since you have to acknowledge me as your master after losing, I’ll teach you in advance. Use any sword art you want and I’ll correct your mistakes.” Zhou Wen threw the sword in his hand to the girl.

“You want to teach me how to use a sword?” The girl caught the sword and widened her eyes as she looked at Zhou Wen. The corners of her eyes twitched as though she had heard something unbelievable or an extremely funny joke.

“That’s right.” Zhou Wen nodded with certainty.

“Good, very good.” The girl laughed in exasperation as she cursed inwardly. How ignorant. What an arrogant and ignorant human. You actually dare to boast shamelessly about teaching me how to use a sword. I’m the dignified Holy Lady of the Trajectory Holy Temple. Can you understand my sword arts?

“Then watch carefully.” The girl was exasperated, but she didn’t argue. She drew the sword and slashed at Zhou Wen.

Everyone was shocked by her actions because her strike was so fast. Furthermore, this strike was identical to the sword art Qin Zhen had used. There was almost no difference.

Even Li Xuan, Ming Xiu, and Feng Qiuyan’s expressions changed drastically.

She was able to replicate Qin Zhen’s sword art perfectly after watching for a brief moment. The movements weren’t only identical, but even her aura and sword intent were identical. This ability was inhuman.

Or rather, this girl had long been secretly plotting against Zhou Wen, allowing her to understand the sword art that Zhou Wen taught Qin Zhen so thoroughly.

Either way, this girl was up to no good.

Zhou Wen wasn’t surprised when he saw the girl’s abilities. Instead, he confirmed her identity. Previously, when he saw the girl and Xiao, Zhou Wen had roughly guessed that she was from the six Holy Temples. Now, he was basically certain that the girl was from the Trajectory Holy Temple like Xiao. With the help of the Teacher Domain, Zhou Wen saw it more clearly than the average person. It wasn’t identical, but carved from the same mold.

This wasn’t a result of training, but from replication. Only the Trajectory Holy Temple that studied Trajectory powers was good at this.

The sword in the girl’s hand slashed at Zhou Wen in an extremely domineering manner. The shimmering sword beams crisscrossed like lightning or cracks, enveloping Zhou Wen’s entire body. It left one shuddering.

However, Zhou Wen remained motionless. Even when the girl retracted her sword and retreated, he didn’t move his toes.

Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid, but the people by the side were so nervous that their palms were sweating. If the girl’s sword tilted just a little, Zhou Wen’s head would be gone.

Thankfully, such a thing didn’t happen. Zhou Wen remained safe and sound.

“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll chop off your head?” Looking at the motionless Zhou Wen, the girl’s eyes were filled with surprise. She felt that this person was surprisingly bold.

“Why should I be afraid? Didn’t we agree? It’s just me giving pointers, not a duel. You won’t injure me, so what’s there to be afraid of?” Zhou Wen said calmly.

Zhou Wen naturally didn’t think so. He didn’t dodge because he was confident that the girl wouldn’t be able to injure him. He only wanted to use words to hold her back, hoping that she wouldn’t fall out with him if she lost.

The girl was still a little naive, so she never expected Zhou Wen to be so scheming. She thought to herself that although Zhou Wen wasn’t a good person, he was still a man of his word.

“You’ve finished seeing the sword art. Please correct me now,” the girl said with a faint smile as she threw the sword back to Zhou Wen.

She had replicated Qin Zhen’s sword technique without missing a beat. She insisted on proving that Zhou Wen hadn’t taught it to Qin Zhen.

“At this level of sword arts, words no longer suffice. As your master, I’ll demonstrate it once to you. After seeing it, you will naturally know where your mistakes are.” Zhou Wen’s words infuriated the girl. It was as though she was bound to lose and had to acknowledge Zhou Wen as her master.

However, there was no time for the girl to retort. Zhou Wen slashed at her with the sword.

Domineering and resolute. If Qin Zhen’s domineeringness was like an empress in the human world, she had an irresistible, invincible authority, then Zhou Wen’s strike was unreasonable and domineering.

When immortals did a divination, they could figure out if a treasure was fated with them. All others were to give up.

When immortals did another divination, they could figure out if one’s time was out. The immortal could slay them on behalf of the heavens.

When an emperor needed someone executed, he had to at least throw charges at them with a groundless crime. Immortals didn’t need any reason. They were the heavenly mandate. If they said that one deserved death, one deserved death.

Ordinary people could only dream of such domineeringness, but they would never be able to achieve it.

Such domineeringness wasn’t Zhou Wen’s sword intent. His sword intent was even more extreme.

Immortal slaying-it didn’t matter if one were an immortal or a god. They could be finished off with one strike; there was no need to waste any breath on them.

This was the tyrant among tyrants. In short, it was “daddy” in “who’s your daddy.” If you were unreasonable, I would be even more unreasonable than you. There was no room for negotiation when beating you up.

The girl had originally made up her mind to remain motionless like Zhou Wen to show her poise. She was good at Trajectory powers, so she could determine his trajectory the moment he attacked. If Zhou Wen wanted to harm her, it wouldn’t be too late to dodge when the time came.

However, when Zhou Wen slashed out, the girl was alarmed to discover that she couldn’t predict the trajectory of the strike. She couldn’t be sure if the final strike would hit her.

The girl’s face immediately revealed a look of panic. It was an unpredictable trajectory. This made the girl, who was used to having an omniscient view, panic.

Zhou Wen’s originally gentle image suddenly became as terrifying as a phantasm in her eyes. The domineering sword also seemed to become Death’s scythe that was about to reap her beautiful and touching life.

In her panic, the girl couldn’t help but take a step back.
