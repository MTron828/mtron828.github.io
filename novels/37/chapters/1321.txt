Chapter 1322: Luck Companion Egg

Translator: CKtalon

After waiting for a long time, Zhou Wen finally received a message. It wasn’t from Zhang Yuzhi, but Hui Haifeng.

“Junior Brother, I’ve obtained all the lucky Companion Beasts I can. Take a look and see if it’s enough.” Behind Hui Haifeng’s message was a list of names.

Zhou Wen took a look and realized that there were a total of eleven different Luck Companion Eggs. Two of them were at the Mythical stage, six were at the Epic stage, and two were at the Legendary stage. There was even one at the Mortal stage.

“Mortal Companion Beasts are already very rare, and it actually has a Luck stat. This is really rare. However, even if a Mortal Companion Beast adds Luck, it shouldn’t add much, right?” Zhou Wen replied: “That’s enough. Give me two days to prepare and I’ll contact you when I’m done.”

“There’s no need. Just stay in Luoyang. I’ve already sent the men over and the Companion Beasts will come with them. They should be able to reach Luoyang tonight.” Hui Haifeng replied.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen didn’t insist. His entry into the Venusian dimensional zone didn’t depend on his location as long as there was a Cube.

“Junior Brother, I’m handing them over to you. They’re my best men. Don’t lose them.” Hui Haifeng sent another message.

“Actually, I can enter alone.” Zhou Wen felt that it was safer for him to be alone.

“Alright, then you have to wear the Federation uniform. Then, wear a small red flag over your head which says ‘Federation Soldier’ on it…” Hui Haifeng replied.

“I think it’s better I take others along.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that it wasn’t an image he wanted to be associated with.

“Hehe, whatever you say. I spent a huge sum of money obtaining these lucky Companion Beasts for you. I believe no one can gather such a powerful lineup of lucky Companion Beasts again. Why do you need so many? According to what I know, although lucky Companion Beasts can increase the chances of obtaining dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs in some way, this possibility actually has a threshold value. Once it exceeds a certain luck value, no matter how many lucky Companion Beasts you equip, it won’t increase much,” Hui Haifeng asked curiously.

“You’ll know in the future.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to talk nonsense with him. He wanted to rush back to Luoyang to see the lucky Companion Beasts. This was because ordinary people could only rely on the information and experience transmitted by the Companion Beasts to determine their stats. They couldn’t see any accurate information.

Therefore, Hui Haifeng only knew that they were Companion Beasts with Luck augmentation, but he wasn’t sure how much Luck would be added.

“Master…” Just as Zhou Wen returned to Luoyang’s An family, he saw Hui Wan rush over.

“Why are you here?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised that Hui Haifeng was willing to let Hui Wan come over.

Now that there were broken-out dimensional zones everywhere on the road, it was difficult to guarantee safety. Hui Wan could be said to be the future hope of the Hui family. It was too risky to let him out now.

“Father agreed to let me come when I said I wanted to learn from you,” Hui Wan said.

Zhou Wen thought to himself,?Learn from me? What can you learn from me? It’s more like me learning from you.

Hui Wan’s talent was extremely high. He could grasp concepts from learning things once. Things like an eidetic memory and speed reading were nothing to him.

Zhou Wen suspected that Hui Haifeng had used some advanced technology to produce such a brainy son.

Back when Zhou Wen was in the Hui family, he had taught Hui Wan, but most of the things he knew could only be understood and not instructed. Zhou Wen had already taught him everything that could be instructed. Now, he really didn’t have anything left to teach.

“Mr. Zhou, these are the items the president instructed us to bring you. Please check them.” An officer in his thirties came in front of Zhou Wen with a few officers. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He looked very strange as he wore zero facial expression. His eyebrows, beard, and facial features looked fake, but Zhou Wen was certain that it was just a feeling. There was no special disguise on his face. He just had such looks.

There were eleven of them, and each of them had a safe handcuffed to their wrist.

Zhou Wen didn’t need to guess to know that they were the eleven Luck Companion Eggs that Hui Haifeng had sent over. These eleven officers were likely Hui Haifeng’s men.

When the officers opened the safes, they used the keys they had to open the safes for the others. And in the safe, there were special devices that seemed to be able to destroy the Companion Eggs in the safes if they were touched.

It was understandable that Hui Haifeng would do such a thing. Although these Companion Eggs weren’t of high levels, they were very valuable. He had to be careful.

After Zhou Wen took receipt of the items, the expressionless officer who looked like he was wearing a mask said, “Under the president’s orders, we will obey your orders from now on, Mr. Zhou. Even if you want us to die, we will definitely carry out your orders immediately.”

“Very good. Go back and rest.” Zhou Wen nodded.

“Yes sir.” The soldier didn’t ask further and directly led his men back to rest.

“Master, the things that the coaches at home teach are so boring. I’ve long wanted to find you. What can you teach me?” Hui Wan asked as he followed behind Zhou Wen.

“You’ve already done a good job with your learning. Play for the next two days,” Zhou Wen said.

“Master, I know that you know things in depth. I might not be able to learn them now, but I’ll definitely work hard…” Hui Wan said with a serious expression.

Zhou Wen looked at Hui Wan’s serious expression and really couldn’t come up with any excuses.

However, he wasn’t good at teaching others. Despite racking his brains, he couldn’t think of anything that he could teach him.

Just as he was feeling stumped, he suddenly saw Li Xuan walk out of the manor. He had no idea why this fellow had come to the An family residence.

Zhou Wen was delighted as he coughed lightly and said to Hui Wan, “Verbal instruction can’t compare to actual practice. When you were at home, you should have learned a lot of theories. It’s time to do some combat training.”

“Master, you want to spar with me?” Hui Wan’s eyes lit up.

“I taught you everything. I know you like the back of my hand. Sparring with me won’t have any effect,” Zhou Wen said.

“Then what should we do?” Hui Wan said anxiously.

“See that person? He’s also your father’s junior. Based on the generation, you should call him Uncle-Master. Train with him first,” Zhou Wen said as he pointed at Li Xuan.

“Is he very powerful?” Hui Wan sized up the sloppy Li Xuan and was very suspicious.

“Average I guess. He can only last three moves against me, but it’s enough as your sparring partner,” Zhou Wen said.

“Don’t worry, Master. I’ll work hard.” Hui Wan couldn’t muster up any energy when he heard that, but he couldn’t refute Zhou Wen. He only thought to himself,?He can only last three moves against Master. He’s not that strong. I’ll think of a way to defeat him later and let Master see my improvement. He should personally spar with me then.

“Old Zhou, whose child is this? What’s he doing?” Li Xuan walked over and asked.

“Hui Haifeng’s son. I was requested to teach him for fun. I happen to have something on. Help me teach him,” Zhou Wen said.

“Old Hui’s son? Then I have to teach him well. Don’t worry. Leave him to me,” Li Xuan said as he patted his chest.

“I’ll leave it to you then. I’ll get back to work.” Before Zhou Wen left, he exhorted Hui Wan, “Little Wan, learn well from your Uncle Li. It will be beneficial for you forever.”

Zhou Wen returned to his room and eagerly took out the eleven Companion Eggs and used his phone to appraise their stats.
