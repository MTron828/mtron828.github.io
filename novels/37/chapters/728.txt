Chapter 729: Messy Information

Translator: CKtalon

What the hell is up with these people? They were all struck by lightning, but they still came running to tell me to be careful of a sneak attack? In this day and age, has the human mind reached such a sublime level? Zhou Wen doubted such good things existed.

The two of them shouldn’t be from the same faction. Otherwise, they would only need to come once. There’s no need for the two of them to run over. However, from the lightning wounds on their bodies, they seem to have experienced similar injuries. What’s going on? Zhou Wen thought about it and couldn’t figure it out.

If it were anyone else, they definitely wouldn’t be able to sleep after suffering such a disturbance.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen wasn’t someone who was afraid of trouble. He lay down before falling asleep again.

After Concerned Person and Nameless came, the thunderstorm became much smaller and gradually dissipated.

When Zhou Wen woke up in the morning, the rain had already stopped. The television had also switched off by itself.

Could it be that it’s really because of the thunderstorm that the television was running on its own? Although Zhou Wen didn’t believe it, there was no better explanation.

The phone suddenly rang. Zhou Wen took out his phone and saw that it was An Sheng.

“Young Master Wen, are you in Weihui now?” An Sheng asked directly.

“Yes, how did you know?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

“The bureau has already found your whereabouts. It might not be the best choice to make this trip,” An Sheng said.

“I have to make a trip to the Imperial Capital. Don’t worry, I’ll be careful.” Zhou Wen had no choice. If it was any other time, he would definitely have turned around and returned to Luoyang. At most, he wouldn’t go to the Imperial Capital.

But now that he had the log on him, if he didn’t go to the Imperial Capital and couldn’t separate from the log at all, how was he going to pass his days?

What was worse was that being inseparable from the log was only when he was resting. If Zhou Wen wanted to move, he had to carry it. Who could stand that?

“Young Master Wen, if you insist on going, it’s best you change your route and progress speed. I’ve revised the routes for you.” An Sheng sent a document to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen chatted with An Sheng for a while before opening the document An Sheng had sent him. He wanted to know what to do next, but when he opened the document, his eyes widened.

The content of the document wasn’t a map at all, but a dynamic emoji. It was a picture of two tall and muscular men wearing only briefs. One of them had his arms around the other’s neck while the other was hugging his waist as they danced together.

Zhou Wen was immediately dumbfounded as his expression turned odd. It should have been sent wrongly... However, why would An Sheng have such a picture... Could it be...

Zhou Wen shivered and hurriedly shook his head to deny his thoughts. He sent a message to An Sheng and asked, “Ah Sheng, did you send the wrong document?”

“Wasn’t it a map of the routes?” An Sheng quickly replied.

“No, it’s an animated picture.” Zhou Wen sent the picture along with the message.

After a while, An Sheng sent another message. “There’s something wrong with the message. I didn’t make a mistake, but the message you received isn’t right. The reason isn’t clear. It’s no longer safe to use my route. I’ll send you a few routes later. You shall choose the route yourself. Don’t tell anyone, including me.”

“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded.

An Sheng sent a simple sketch over. It was obvious that it was hand drawn. It showed the routes from where he was to the Imperial Capital. He could choose one of them.

As the communication line could be compromised, An Sheng didn’t say much. He exhorted Zhou Wen to be careful before ending the call.

Zhou Wen studied the map before choosing a path to continue his journey.

In a cave on Chess Mountain, a seductive woman chained up was fiddling with some experimental equipment as though she was doing some research.

The phone beside her rang. The woman glanced at the phone screen and realized that the message was from Zhou Wen. With a thought, an invisible force immediately controlled the phone to tap open the message.

The phone automatically flew to the woman, allowing her to see the message.

The woman frowned.

“Baby, I want you to be my slave tonight...”

“Zhou Wen, you sure are gutsy! You want me to be your slave? I’ll satisfy you immediately.” The woman narrowed her eyes as a strange glint flashed in them.

With a thought, the woman automatically sent a message to Zhou Wen.

“I’ll fulfill your wish tonight.”

Zhou Wen was walking when he heard his phone ring. He took it out and saw that it was from The Thearch. He immediately clicked it open and was momentarily at a loss. He sent a message over.

“What do you mean? Did you send the wrong message?”

“Wrong message? Then who did you plan on sending your message to?” The Thearch quickly replied.

“How would I know who your message was meant for?” Zhou Wen felt even more puzzled.

The Thearch didn’t reply. Zhou Wen muttered to himself, “Crazy.”

After putting away his phone, he continued his journey. Zhou Wen changed his previous route and took another detour. He didn’t take the same old route.

Although taking the original path might have an unexpected effect, the probability of Zhou Wen changing his route and not changing his route was one in two. However, the chances of accurately determining which one of the new routes that Zhou Wen would take were much lower. Therefore, Zhou Wen decided to change his route.

An hour after Zhou Wen set off, Xia Liuchuan and company set off from another hotel in Weihui and continued following Zhou Wen.

They looked much better now. The day before, they had encountered the mysterious dimensional creature that nearly killed them. Although they had managed to escape in the end, they had suffered minor injuries.

With Zhang Chunqiu’s deduction, they slowly followed behind. They weren’t afraid of losing Zhou Wen.

“We were really unlucky yesterday to encounter such a terrifying dimensional creature. Thankfully, I’m smart enough and ran fast enough,” Xia Liuchuan said gloomily.

Zhang Chunqiu pondered and said, “I did some divinations when I came out today.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“What do they say?” Xia Liuchuan asked.

“Today’s divination is still Sister Return Lightning Pool,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“No way! Something similar will happen today?” Xia Liuchuan frowned.

“I hope not. Logically speaking, this Sister Return Lightning Pool isn’t a bad divination, but this matter seems a little odd. It’s best to be careful,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

The trio left the city and followed Zhou Wen’s path for less than two hours before feeling that something was amiss. In the wilderness, there seemed to be pairs of eyes peeping at them, but upon careful inspection, they didn’t discover any dimensional creatures or humans.

“Don’t tell me something is up again!” Xia Liuchuan felt uneasy.
