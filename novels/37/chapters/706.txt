Chapter 707: The Dust Settles

Translator: CKtalon

Just as everyone was in a daze, a Companion Beast almost immediately issued a challenge. The cube’s screen lit up again as a name and a Companion Beast appeared on the screen.

“Tai Sui...” Everyone was slightly taken aback when they saw the Companion Beast and name. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The people from the East District knew what Tai Sui was, but the people from the other districts weren’t aware. However, when they saw a white and tender ball appear on-screen, it didn’t look like a particularly powerful Companion Beast.

“No way? Is that thing a slime? Can such a Companion Beast challenge an invincible Companion Beast like Origin Realm King?” someone from the West District commented.

“Is that a legendary blob monster?” The people from the North District were puzzled.

“How can such a Companion Beast challenge Origin Realm King? Isn’t that guaranteeing Origin Realm King’s first place? Don’t tell me they are in cahoots?” Many people guessed.

Although the people of the East District knew about Tai Sui, they didn’t know much about its abilities. They only knew that Tai Sui brought bad luck. As the saying went, “Messing with Tai Sui incurs disaster.” It was a very popular saying in the East District.

Even if it could bring bad luck, it was impossible for it to defeat a powerful existence like Origin Realm King with bad luck in a duel, right? That was a terrifying existence that could kill Death of the Underworld!

However, Zhou Wen didn’t think so. Origin Realm King killed Death of the Underworld, Zhou Wen didn’t dare release Tai Sui to challenge him.

However, after seeing how the Origin Realm King killed Death of the Underworld, Zhou Wen was finally certain that Tai Sui would be able to restrain it. In essence, Origin Realm King was still a type of microorganism, not some special physical entity.

As for Tai Sui, it was extremely effective against all kinds of microbes. It could devour the Mythical Primordial Spore back at the Mortal stage. What’s more, it was now at the Epic stage. It had a high chance of defeating Origin Realm King.

Time ticked by. Origin Realm King hadn’t accepted the challenge. In the blink of an eye, less than an hour was left.

“What? Origin Realm King is just stalling for time. It looks like there’s zero suspense left. First place will undoubtedly go to Origin Realm King.”

“Origin Realm King is really too powerful. An existence like Death of the Underworld was actually killed by it. It didn’t even have the chance to forfeit. Did you see what happened? What’s up with that flower? The moment it appeared, it sucked in Death of the Underworld. I wonder what kind of ability it is.”

“I should have known. Even Primordial Sword Immortal isn’t a match for Origin Realm King, much less Death of the Underworld.”

Almost everyone believed that there was no longer any suspense in this battle. Without a doubt, Original Realm King was first, and the remaining time would be wasted.

After Tai Sui was defeated, there wouldn’t be enough time left to challenge it. Even if one had a Companion Beast that could fight Origin Realm King, they wouldn’t be given the chance.

However, some people didn’t think so. Leng Zongzheng had seen Zhou Wen’s Tai Sui before and knew that Tai Sui was very effective against microorganisms. Furthermore, he had clearly determined that Origin Realm King was a microorganism.

“From the looks of it, he got lucky. Your family’s Zhou Wen sure is lucky,” Leng Zongzheng said to An Tianzuo as he watched the livestream.

An Tianzuo replied expressionlessly, “Humans can’t just rely on luck. If we only rely on luck, we will suffer a huge loss sooner or later.”

Leng Zongzheng said with a smile, “Actually, luck is similar to money. Money isn’t omnipotent, but it’s impossible without money.”

...

There was less than half an hour left. Origin Realm King still hadn’t accepted the challenge. Everyone believed that Origin Realm King would accept the challenge at the last moment. Then, with less than ten minutes left before the countdown ended, its first place would then be secured.

Origin Realm King still didn’t accept the challenge in the final moments. Despite having less than ten seconds on the clock, it still didn’t make a move. It made people feel that something was amiss.

“What’s going on? Why hasn’t it accepted the challenge?”

“There’s no need to keep our hearts racing, right? Does it want to accept the challenge at the last second?”

“Could it be afraid of Tai Sui?”

“What a joke. How is that possible? That’s Origin Realm King!”

“Seven... Six... Five... Four...”

Everyone counted silently with the countdown in their hearts, but even at the last second, Origin Ream King didn’t accept the challenge.

Upon seeing the first ranked Origin Realm King’s name being squeezed out and replaced by Tai Sui’s name, the entire Federation and those overseas were in an uproar.

“Origin Realm King doesn’t dare accept the challenge? Is Tai Sui that strong?”

“Tai Sui... What kind of Companion Beast is this?”

“I knew that Tai Sui was extraordinary, but I didn’t say anything.”

“Facing Primordial Sword Immortal and Death of the Underworld, Origin Realm King can definitely suppress them, but it didn’t dare accept Tai Sui’s challenge. It doesn’t even have the courage to fight. That Tai Sui is too terrifying. I really want to know what kind of abilities it has!”

“What bullsh*t is this Tai Sui? I think it’s all a scam. They’re in cahoots.”

“I don’t think so. Origin Realm King was already first. If they are in cahoots, there’d be no need to admit defeat and let Tai Sui take first place.”

As everyone was discussing, they saw another Companion Beast issue a challenge. However, Tai Sui ignored it. It didn’t accept the challenge even when the 72-hour countdown on the cube ended.

The scene on the cube turned into a ranking. Tai Sui was first, and the defeated Origin Realm King was second. Third was Primordial Sword Immortal, and fourth was Zhou Wen’s Tyrant Behemoth.

This continued until the hundredth spot. The names of the Companion Beasts emitted a resplendent glow. It made the entire world know that they were the strongest hundred Companion Beasts among humans.

However, most people did not realize that Tai Sui, who was ranked first, had yet to advance to the Mythical stage.

“Mommy, Tai Sui is so cute. I want a Tai Sui doll. Can our family’s factory produce one?” A little boy hugging a Tyrant Behemoth doll looked at his mother with anticipation.

“This...” His mother was somewhat hesitant. Although Tai Sui looked adorable, it seemed a little ominous.

“Mommy, our Tyrant Behemoth doll has been very popular. I believe Tai Sui will also sell very well. Pretty please?” The boy pulled his mother’s hand and wheedled.

“Alright... Let’s give it a try...” His mother stroked the boy’s head dotingly.
