Chapter 702: Perfect Companion Beast

Translator: CKtalon

“I see. This Light Beast is using attacks indiscriminately to force out Origin Realm King. No matter how invisible Origin Realm King is, it can’t really disappear. Such an attack is very likely to find its traces,” Gulli said.

Sadie nodded and said, “Light Beast is a Mythical Companion Beast of the Family Clan of Gods. Its Wheel of Destiny is called Light Ray. Although its offensive power isn’t strong, its range is very large. Furthermore, it can last for a long time. It’s suitable for restraining invisibility. From the looks of it, the Family Clan of Gods didn’t find a way to restrain Origin Realm King. They just want to use this method to figure out what kind of Companion Beast Origin Realm King is.”

Zhou Wen and company stared at the cube’s huge screen. The light illuminated the entire arena. If anything was in the arena, even if it couldn’t be seen, it would be injured by the light rays.

Even if it couldn’t be injured, it would have some reaction.

Strangely, nothing happened across the entire arena. The light rays didn’t meet any obstacles, nor did they collide with any forces. Neither did the light refract.

“That’s strange. Could it be that Origin Realm King is really an invisible and intangible spirit body?”

“Impossible. If it’s really an invisible and incorporeal spirit body, how could Origin Realm King directly attack Primordial Sword Immortal during the battle? It definitely has a form.”

“As you can see, Light Ray has already enveloped the entire arena. If it really has a body, it’s impossible for it to not react to the Light Ray.”

“Perhaps it’s some temporarily incorporeal skill. It shouldn’t last long.”

The various families were discussing how Origin Realm King had dodged Light Ray, but they couldn’t make an accurate guess.

Light Beast continued shooting out Light Ray. It could do so for several hours, so there was no need to worry about it being ambushed by Origin Realm King.

Just as everyone was discussing, they suddenly saw the nose and face of the Light Beast crater as though it had been smashed by an invisible fist.

Then, Light Beast flew out, bleeding from its seven orifices. It died immediately without even having the chance to surrender.

Instantly, everyone broke out into a cold sweat. Many people had guessed that Light Beast was no match for Origin Realm King.

However, no one expected Light Beast to lose so tragically. Not only did it fail to force out Origin Realm King, but it was even killed in one strike.

Clearly, the difference between the two was too great. Light Beast couldn’t even withstand one strike. The Family Clan of Gods’ plan had failed and they had even lost Light Beast.

“It’s really too powerful. It has invincible invisibility and invincible strength. It’s practically a perfect Companion Beast.”

“If Origin Realm King wants to assassinate someone, I’m afraid no one in this world can escape its assassination, right? Just the thought of it is terrifying.”

“What Primordial Sword Immortal? What Death of the Underworld? Compared to Origin Realm King, they are so weak.”

“I wonder who was so lucky to obtain a Companion Beast like Origin Realm King.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The ordinary citizens of the Federation were discussing the topic of Origin Realm King. In the battle against Primordial Sword Immortal, people were still doubtful of Origin Realm King’s strength. However, killing Light Beast in one strike had allowed Origin Realm King to truly ascend to the throne. It left a deep mark in the history of human Companion Beasts.

The various families began their intense research and analysis work. They had used all sorts of high-tech equipment to record videos, so they repeatedly studied and analyzed them.

However, no matter how they analyzed and studied it, Origin Realm King’s invisibility was perfect.

Light Beast’s indiscriminate Light Ray couldn’t touch its body at all. It was even killed in a frontal attack. This capability was terrifying and made one feel uneasy.

Just as the man on the street said, having Origin Realm King was equivalent to having the most terrifying assassin in the world. Even the members of the six families were worried that they would be assassinated by Origin Realm King.

If Origin Realm King was from overseas, the Federation would be in even more danger.

Even if it was a Companion Beast of the Federation, it would be equally intolerable. It was like a sharp blade hanging over one’s neck. It was unknown when it would land; furthermore, the person holding the blade wasn’t them.

Repeated studies and analysis ensued as everyone in the world wanted to find out the weakness of Origin Realm King.

“I wonder if the power of Origin Realm King can augment its master,” Feng Qiuyan said in thought.

“I don’t think so. It’s already invincible in this state. If it can augment its owner, wouldn’t it be like a bug in games?” Li Xuan curled his lips.

“It’s not impossible. Just like the Invisibility Cloak that once caused a stir, it can make people perfectly invisible. No reconnaissance method can see its existence,” said Huang Ji.

Sadie seemed to know something about the Invisibility Cloak as she continued, “Although the Invisibility Cloak can result in complete invisibility that can’t be detected, there’s a time limit. It can only maintain an invisible and formless state for a period of time. Usually, it’s just invisibility, but it can still be detected by special means. Just like the Light Ray from Light Beast just now, it can expose the Invisibility Cloak under normal conditions. If not for that, the Zhang family wouldn’t have been able to successfully return the Invisibility Cloak to its Companion Egg form back then.”

The few of them discussed as they walked. Zhou Wen didn’t say a word. He had a nagging feeling that something was amiss, but he couldn’t tell what was wrong.

After this battle, no Companion Beasts challenged Origin Realm King again. This was because no one wanted to risk having their Companion Beasts killed.

No Mythical Companion Beast was easy to come by. Knowing that it was suicide, no one was willing to do it.

The various factions could only keep researching and analyzing, hoping to find the weakness of Origin Realm King. However, in the blink of an eye, there were only 48 hours left. No one could figure out the weakness of Origin Realm King.

They watched the video so many times, but they couldn’t even tell where Origin Realm King was, much less figure out what it looked like and what weaknesses it had.

Now, many people believed that Origin Realm King was probably going to take first place in the ranking battle. Up to now, no Companion Beast could restrain it and there wasn’t much time left.

Zhou Wen had been studying the video the entire time as well. After repeatedly watching it, he failed to find the location of Origin Realm King.

Could it be that the Invisibility ability of Origin Realm King is really that perfect? How manymodes of invisibility are there? Spirit Bodies are considered one of them. Origin Realm King is most likely a Spirit Body. However, from its attack patterns, it seems to have a corporeal body. Also, total invisibility is impossible. If it’s just total invisibility, it will definitely be detected by Light Ray. Then, there’s the type akin to Invisibility Cloak that can temporarily turn into nothingness. From the looks of it, this possibility is the highest. Also, it could be as small as Primordial Spore, so it can’t be seen. However, no matter how small it is, it should react when it’s shot by the omnipresent Light Ray... Wait... That’s not right... Zhou Wen seemed to think of something.
