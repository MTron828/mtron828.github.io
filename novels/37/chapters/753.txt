Chapter 754: Connate Great Emperor Sutra

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen stood up and stared at Old Master Xia. He silently switched his Essence Energy Art to the most primitive Slaughterer and used Sigh of the King’s power.

Immediately, an explosive force filled his body, almost blasting it apart. Furthermore, the force was rapidly becoming stronger.

It had been a long time since Zhou Wen used the Sigh of the King’s power. This was because the force was just too powerful. Even with his present Constitution, he couldn’t last long. If time went on, he would explode from his own strength without the enemy doing a thing.

But at this stage, he had to use it no matter what.

Old Master Xia’s figure flashed as he appeared in front of Zhou Wen as though he had teleported. The Orchid Blade in his hand stabbed at Zhou Wen’s eyes. Even at the Mythical stage, his speed was extremely terrifying. It was almost impossible for anyone to react.

However, Zhou Wen reacted in time. His Bamboo Blade struck the Orchid Blade and forced Old Master Xia to take half a step back. It left Old Master Xia’s eyes filled with surprise.

With the augmentation of the Guardian, his Speed and Strength were at the Mythical stage. Furthermore, he was a top existence among Mythical creatures.

Zhou Wen had actually blocked his saber and sent him retreating. This was enough to shock him.

After all, Zhou Wen didn’t have a Guardian. Even if he had a Mythical Companion Beast, that didn’t make him a true Mythical.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to think too much. His body was swelling uncomfortably, and it wouldn’t be long before he exploded. He had to do something before his body failed to withstand the Sigh of the King’s power.

He slashed at Old Master Xia with Bamboo Blade like a tsunami.

Old Master Xia raised the Orchid Blade and absorbed the terrifying Essence Energy from the Bamboo Blade.

However, he was surprised to discover that the Essence Energy from the Bamboo Blade seemed endless. No matter how he absorbed it, the Essence Energy from the Bamboo Blade showed no signs of weakening.

Zhou Wen delivered a few consecutive strikes that sent Old Master Xia retreating. The strength multiplied with every strike.

How is this possible? Old Master Xia was alarmed. He had the augmentation of a Guardian. Together with the power of the Connate Great Emperor Sutra, there weren’t many who could compete with him even at the Mythical stage.

Zhou Wen was at the Epic stage, but the power he unleashed was able to suppress him. This left him shocked and delighted.

The stronger Zhou Wen was, the stronger the Wheel of Destiny he would condense when he advanced to the Mythical stage with the help of the nine Life Souls.

“Show me your strength. This is your life’s final moment of glory. Let me see how strong you are.” Old Master Xia’s figure flashed as he dodged Zhou Wen’s saber attacks, the excitement in his eyes intensifying.

Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change. Now, he was completely focused on combat. He didn’t have any other thoughts as he drove the violent forces in his body to the limits.

The blade became faster and faster, and the force became more and more violent.

As for Zhou Wen’s saber techniques, they also became stronger.

Transcendent Flying Immortal was actually a movement technique, not a saber technique. The present Zhou Wen was unable to injure Old Master Xia with Transcendent Flying Immortal alone as the latter’s Path to Snatching Heaven wasn’t inferior to Transcendent Flying Immortal.

Therefore, Zhou Wen could only seek a breakthrough. Since his movement technique couldn’t threaten Old Master Xia, he could only make the saber in his hand faster and stronger.

Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to use many fancy moves. He was only pursuing faster speeds.

Quick! Quick! Quick!

Zhou Wen only aimed to increase his speed. Be it his movement technique or the blade in his hand, they had infinite possibilities due to the nearly infinite forces in his body.

Bam!

When Zhou Wen felt that his body was about to explode from the violent forces, he finally reached a point where even Old Master Xia couldn’t dodge his attacks. He slashed at Old Master Xia’s chest.

However, Old Master Xia’s body exploded like water. He had only slashed at a clone—Old Master Xia’s body had appeared elsewhere.

“How interesting. Your Epic body actually possesses such immense strength. However, your body shouldn’t be able to withstand such immense strength, right?” Old Master Xia sized up Zhou Wen with a fervent gaze.

He wanted to know how strong he would be if his Mythical body could possess such power.

Old Master Xia carefully selected seven talented youths and plundered their talent, Life Providences, and Life Souls. Together with his Life Providence and Life Soul, he was just short of one Life Providence and Life Soul to reach the extremity of nine for the Connate Great Emperor Sutra, allowing him to change his fate and advance to the Mythical stage.

The Connate Great Emperor Sutra was created by combining the Xia family’s Great Emperor Sutra and the Invincible Connate Divine Art he obtained from the Connate Divine Temple. He believed that he could definitely use this Essence Energy Art to advance to the Mythical stage.

However, it was difficult to gather nine Life Providences and nine Life Souls. Typical Life Providences and Life Souls, such as the ten thousand Epic swordsmen, only existed as nutrients for the nine Life Providences and Life Souls. They didn’t truly become his Life Providences and Life Souls.

It was very rare for someone to become one of the nine main Life Providences and Life Souls. Up to now, Old Master Xia was still lacking one.

In fact, Xia Liuchuan was originally the ninth person that Old Master Xia had deliberately nurtured. However, for some reason, Old Master Xia ultimately didn’t absorb Xia Liuchuan.

It was only when Zhou Wen appeared that Old Master Xia planned on using Zhou Wen as his ninth Life Providence and Life Soul. At the same time, he would use the Life Providences and Life Souls of more than ten thousand people as nutrients to push himself to the Mythical stage and condense the Wheel of Destiny.

However, Zhou Wen’s performance left Old Master Xia alarmed. Zhou Wen was much stronger than the eight he had absorbed previously. It was a rare sight.

It was indeed as Old Master Xia had said. Zhou Wen’s body couldn’t withstand the power of the Sigh of the King. His flesh ruptured as bloody marks appeared on his skin. His muscles were torn apart as blood dripped. Cracks also appeared on his bones. If this continued, he would probably self-destruct.

However, Zhou Wen was still as calm as before. He carefully sensed the forces that were pushing his body towards destruction.

Zhou Wen had seen many powerful creatures—Torch Dragon, Tyrant Behemoth, Primordial Sword Immortal, Truth Listener, and the even stronger Guardians. They were all very powerful, forces that others looked up to.

However, no matter what kind of power it was, it couldn’t compare to the power in Zhou Wen’s body. Zhou Wen could sense that this power was a level higher than any power he had ever seen. It might even be on a higher level.

“If God opposes me, I will slay God... If an immortal opposes me, I will cull the immortal... No exchanges with god... No acquaintances with immortals... I am me...”

Zhou Wen recalled the impudent and savage voice in his dream. It left him shuddering in fear, but it also made his blood boil.
