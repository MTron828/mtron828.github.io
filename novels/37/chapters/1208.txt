Chapter 1209: The Cube Starts Again

“Why would the Cube activate at such a time?” Ouyang Lan and Zhou Wen found it odd.

Ever since Human Sovereign slew Di Tian, there hadn’t been any more Battles of the Cube. Due to the existence of Human Sovereign, the dimension didn’t dare to randomly activate the Battle of the Cube.

He switched on his phone for the livestream. Indeed, everywhere in the Federation was reporting the restarting of the Cube.

However, the opening of the Cube this time was different from the previous times. There was no ranking. All the Cubes showed the same scene.

It was a red planet, and most of it was covered in hard rock. There were some spots on the planet’s surface that were bubbling with boiling magma. The heat made space seem distorted, making it look very strange.

“This is... Venus?” Ouyang Lan looked at it for a while before recognizing the planet on the screen. She looked at An Sheng in puzzlement.

An Sheng hurriedly said, “Yes, Madam. Many astronomers have confirmed that the planet on the Cube is undoubtedly Venus. However, it’s still unknown why the Cube is showing Venus.”

After a pause, An Sheng pointed at a corner of the Cube’s screen and said, “There’s a 72-hour count here. We don’t know what its use is for now. Everyone is guessing.”

“Let’s go to a Cube. There’s too little we can gather from a phone,” Ouyang Lan said to Zhou Wen as she walked. “From Earth, Venus’s brightness is second only to the moon. In ancient times, Venus was also known as Changgeng, Taibai, Qiming, Evening Star, and so on. The name Venus comes from the West District. Now that it’s suddenly appearing on Cube, I wonder if it’s a blessing or a curse.”

“Nothing good has ever come from the Cube’s appearance, right?” Zhou Wen said helplessly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ouyang Lan asked An Sheng again, “Has anyone attempted to use the Cube to enter the rankings?”

“Someone has already tried, but they can’t enter the rankings,” An Sheng answered.

“Cannot enter the rankings? What are those fellows from the dimension up to?” Ouyang Lan frowned even more.

When Zhou Wen and company rushed to the Cube, An Tianzuo and An Jing were already there. Seeing Zhou Wen follow Ouyang Lan over, An Tianzuo’s gaze met Zhou Wen’s for less than a second before he immediately turned to the side without looking at him again.

“Little Zhou, we meet again.” Qin Wufu was also there as he greeted Zhou Wen with a smile.

“Governor Qin, what’s the situation now?” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to ask An Tianzuo, so he asked Qin Wufu.

Qin Wufu explained, “It’s been about half an hour since the Cube lit up. The various factions in the Federation are actively probing it, but there’s no movement from it. We can’t enter the rankings, nor is there a combat arena. There’s only the image and countdown of Venus.”

“Don’t tell me they want to use Venus as a combat arena?” Zhou Wen asked.

Qin Wufu said, “Many people think so. There are large amounts of basalt on the surface of Venus. Furthermore, the surface temperature is extremely high. The amount of carbon dioxide in the air exceeds 97%. There will often be sulfuric acid rain...”

Zhou Wen carefully listened to Qin Wufu’s introduction. He didn’t know much about Venus. He had heard that the surface temperature of Venus could reach more than 500°C. Even at the Mythical stage, it was very difficult to stay on Venus for long.

Furthermore, with current aerospace technology, it wasn’t easy to reach Venus. Some teleportation abilities could speed up interstellar traveling.

However, not many people had interstellar teleportation abilities. They were considered rare in the Federation.

Zhou Wen carefully sized up Venus through the Cube. At the same time, he used Great Brahma’s power to strengthen his vision, hoping to see something.

After some observation, Zhou Wen’s expression gradually turned solemn.

Ouyang Lan noticed that Zhou Wen’s expression was odd, so she asked, “Little Wen, did you discover something?”

Everyone looked at Zhou Wen as he pondered for a moment before saying, “There seems to be a shadow slowly surfacing in the magma. However, I can only see a shadow. I can’t tell what it is.”

Upon hearing Zhou Wen’s words, An Tianzuo and company looked at the scene of Venus in the Cube, but they couldn’t see anything.

An Sheng’s heart stirred as he looked at Zhou Wen and asked, “Young Master Wen, look at the countdown. Could it be the countdown to when the shadow surfaces?”

“It’s very likely, but I can’t be sure. The distance from the Cube is too far. Furthermore, the magma has blocked my vision. There’s too little I can see,” Zhou Wen said.

Everyone’s mood was somewhat heavy. For the dimension to suddenly activate the Cube and have it hosted on Venus, they were definitely up to no good.

As they couldn’t verify any of their hypotheses, they could only wait for time to pass and wait for the shadow Zhou Wen mentioned to appear.

Luoyang City had already entered a state of high alert. The citizens who could be evacuated into the dimensional zones began to move into them. If a terrifying creature appeared on Venus, it wouldn’t be difficult for it to reach Earth from that distance.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to leave, he suddenly heard someone shout, “Someone... There’s someone on Venus...”

Zhou Wen and company, who were chatting, hurriedly looked at the Cube. The scene was still Venus, but a humanoid creature appeared on the screen. It floated above Venus and stared at the magma as though it was observing something.

After taking a closer look, Zhou Wen was certain that it wasn’t a human. Although the figure looked like a human, his entire body was like gold. It wasn’t in the form of armor, but his body was like a golden sculpture.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t sense his aura through the Cube. He didn’t know what kind of creature he belonged to.

As Zhou Wen and company were watching, the unknown creature suddenly plunged into the magma and quickly vanished.

Others only knew that the creature had burrowed into the magma, but Zhou Wen could roughly tell that it was heading for the shadow.

After the golden person entered the magma, it didn’t come out again. After waiting for almost an hour, there was still no movement.

After a while, another dragon from Western legends flew over and similarly arrived beside the magma. Like the golden person, it quickly rushed into the magma.

Zhou Wen suddenly felt that the shadow might not be a creature. Instead, it might be some treasure. Although the two fellows that had appeared hadn’t undergone Terror transformation, they were most likely at the Terror grade to be able to enter the magma so easily.

No matter how low their intelligence was, it was impossible for a Terror-grade creature to tempt fate, right?

Should I take a look? Zhou Wen was somewhat tempted. His Singularity Universe had interstellar teleportation abilities, so it would be very easy for him to reach Venus.
