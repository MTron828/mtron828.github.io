Chapter 1658 Terrible News

I nearly succeeded. How infuriating. Tsukuyomi clenched her fists angrily when she saw Zhou Wen teleport away, but she didn’t know how to vent her anger. She was extremely depressed.

What’s the power that repelled the parasitic bee and the Life-and-Death Suona? I seem to hear a voice that doesn’t belong to Zhou Wen. Could it be that there’s a terrifying existence hidden in Zhou Wen’s body? After calming down, Tsukuyomi’s puzzlement intensified. Thoughts constantly flashed through her mind. Why is that terrifying existence hidden in Zhou Wen’s body? What’s her relationship with Zhou Wen? Will it harm Zhou Wen? No, I have to think of a way to figure it out.

However, on second thought, she couldn’t return to Earth now. Furthermore, because of that matter, Zhou Wen definitely didn’t trust her. It would probably be difficult to resolve the problem if she went to Zhou Wen now.

From the looks of it, I have to think of a solution. Tsukuyomi narrowed her eyes in thought as her mind raced.

Zhou Wen wasn’t as Tsukuyomi had imagined. He was already a little used to Tsukuyomi’s style of doing things. Even if he was deceived, he wasn’t surprised. He even felt that it was only right and proper. He wasn’t angry at all. Of course, this didn’t mean that Zhou Wen had become foolish from all the lies. It was only because Zhou Wen knew very well that no matter how Tsukuyomi lied to him, she wouldn’t really harm him.

After teleporting back to Earth, Zhou Wen returned to Guide City. As interstellar teleportation had a certain deviation, Zhou Wen appeared near the ancient city.

Just as he was about to return to the base, he suddenly sensed something. He turned his head and saw a white-robed man standing by the lake.

A breeze blew gently from the lake, causing the white-haired, dragon-horned man’s clothes to flutter as though he would ride the wind at any moment.

“Teacher!” Zhou Wen’s body trembled. Although he only saw a figure, he recognized it at a glance.

“Little Wen.” The white-robed man turned around and smiled at Zhou Wen. It was Wang Mingyuan.

“Teacher, why are you here?” Zhou Wen was delighted to see Wang Mingyuan again. With Wang Mingyuan’s current status, he definitely wouldn’t casually return to Earth, much less just come to drink tea and chat with him.

Zhou Wen stood there, momentarily unsure if he should run to Wang Mingyuan as he stood there in a daze. “You’ve grown up.” Wang Mingyuan smiled and turned around again. With his back facing Zhou Wen, he looked at the ancient city enveloped by the misty rain and said, “When you’re young, there are many things you can avoid. You didn’t have to make choices because someone was standing at a high vantage point to shield you from the elements. However, as you gradually grow up, the person who shielded you from the elements would no longer be as tall as you. There would be no way to protect you in a world with no multiple choice questions. That’s when it’s time for you to make a choice.”

“Teacher, what do you want me to choose?” Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan and ultimately didn’t walk over.

“Earth’s seal is weakening. Before long, all the dimensional zones will break out,” Wang Mingyuan said. “I know.” Zhou Wen nodded with a heavy expression. More and more dimensional zones had been breached in recent times. It probably wouldn’t be long before they were completely breached.

“When all dimensional zones break out, it will be when Earth’s Companion Beast appears.” Wang Mingyuan’s words immediately made Zhou Wen tremble.

“That fast!?” Zhou Wen was alarmed.

According to the present situation, it would probably only be a year or two before the dimensional zones were completely breached. If Earth’s Companion Beast were to appear, wouldn’t Earth be doomed?

“Perhaps it will be faster than you imagine.” Wang Mingyuan smiled and said, “Furthermore, this isn’t the worst.”

“What’s worse than this?” Zhou Wen felt that his young heart couldn’t withstand such a blow.

If Earth’s destruction wasn’t the worst situation, he really couldn’t fathom what could be worse.

“When that happens, the entire universe’s rules that suppress the dimension will be lifted. In fact, the suppression of the universe’s rules on the dimension has already begun to weaken,” Wang Mingyuan said slowly. Towards the end, the smile on his face completely vanished.

“Are you sure?” Zhou Wen asked in horror.

He knew very well how terrifying such a situation would be. The reason why humans could survive, or rather, the entire universe where Earth was located, could maintain a relatively peaceful state, was all because of the universe’s rules of suppression on the dimension.

Without this nomological suppression, all creatures in the universe would face a huge disaster, much less humans. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wang Mingyuan didn’t answer Zhou Wen as he continued, “This is a disaster, but it’s also an opportunity.”

“What opportunity?” Zhou Wen didn’t understand. If the dimension really launched a large-scale invasion, what chance would humanity have?

“No one has found Earth’s Companion Beast yet, nor does anyone know which dimensional zone on Earth will determine the ownership of Earth’s Companion Beast. Even if the top experts of the dimension descend, they wouldn’t dare rashly invade Earth. They still need humans as their representatives to vie for Earth’s Companion Beast.”

“Is there a need? If the dimension’s Apocalypse-grade powerhouses can really descend completely on Earth, they have the ability to clear all the dimensional zones. Why go through so much trouble?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“They also want to do so, but unfortunately, they wouldn’t dare.”

“Wouldn’t dare?”

“Yes, they wouldn’t dare. Even Apocalypse-grade powerhouses will be afraid.” “What are they afraid of? What on Earth is making them afraid?” Zhou Wen was alarmed as he had a nagging feeling that this might be the crux of everything. “I don’t know what on Earth makes them afraid either. However, the former strongest expert of the dimension rushed into Earth with supreme might and nearly cracked it. However, he ultimately failed to come out and vanished from the face of the earth,” Wang Mingyuan said.

“Is it that ship with a woman’s portrait?” Zhou Wen immediately thought of the woman’s portrait and the anchor.

Wang Mingyuan nodded. “Therefore, even if the suppression of the cosmic rules disappears, the dimension won’t completely invade Earth for the time being. They need some representatives to figure out what’s on Earth for them.”

After a pause, Wang Mingyuan continued, “There are many races in the dimension now, but there are a total of seven truly powerful races. You shouldn’t be too unfamiliar with them. The six Holy Temples represent the six powerful races of the dimension. However, the strongest in the dimension isn’t these six races, but the Immortals.”

Zhou Wen did some calculations and realized that he wasn’t a stranger to them at all. He had dealt with many people in the Holy Land and had a grudge with the Immortals. With this in mind, he had offended all seven of the strongest races in the dimension.

In the future, when the dimension fully descended, he felt that his living environment would become abnormally harsh.

“Since the Immortals are so strong, why didn’t they establish a Holy Temple in the Holy Land?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled by this.

“Previously, the strongest expert from the dimension who descended on Earth came from the Immortals—they were a race that all submitted to. Back then, even the union of the six Holy races had to submit to the Immortals. Unfortunately, the Immortal who made all races submit vanished from Earth,” Wang Mingyuan said slowly.
