Chapter 1181: Already Sullied

Translator: CKtalon

In Singularity Universe, a star was destroyed. At the same time, a Companion Beast on Zhou Wen’s body was transferred to Li Xuan. A strange mark appeared in Li Xuan’s palm.

The symbol was the Planet Devourer’s symbol. It was the Companion Beast that Zhou Wen had planned on transferring to Li Xuan.

Li Xuan hadn’t raised any questions and came without a word when he requested his help. However, this trip was just too dangerous. No one knew what was in the true Netherworld and what dangers there were.

Zhou Wen had transferred the Planet Devourer to Li Xuan, hoping that he would have more self-protection abilities. If anything happened to him in the real Netherworld, he might be able to use it.

Of course, this was only the worst case scenario. With a Calamity bigshot like the antelope around, there might not be any danger even if they reached the true Netherworld.

“Holy sh*t, a Terror-grade Companion Beast?” After Li Xuan obtained the Planet Devourer, he also obtained some information about it. After learning of the Planet Devourer’s level and abilities, he immediately looked at Zhou Wen in surprise.

He wasn’t only surprised that Zhou Wen had really given him a Terror-grade Companion Beast, but he was also surprised that Zhou Wen had given him a hatched Companion Beast. Such an ability was completely unheard of.

If hatched Companion Beasts could be transferred at will without paying any price, the Federation would have long been in chaos.

When An Jingyu and company heard Li Xuan say that, they found it unbelievable. They imagined that Li Xuan was joking.

After all, they had never heard of casually gifting hatched Companion Beasts. Furthermore, it was a Terror-grade Companion Beast.

“Why are you giving me this? Take it back,” Li Xuan said with a frown.

“I only know how to give it to others and not take it back. If you don’t want it, why don’t you give it back to me?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Fine! You are rich and have what it takes to be willful. It’s a waste not to take it,” Li Xuan said.

“You can’t take it for nothing. You have to help me complete this trip no matter what,” Zhou Wen said seriously. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“That’s nothing,” Li Xuan said with a smile.

Li Xuan didn’t summon the Planet Devourer. All he did was test it in its glove state without activating the Devourer ability before putting it away.

An hour later, the torture chambers opened again. Li Xuan strode to the next torture chamber and muttered, “If there’s such a good deal next time, remember to get me again.”

“Sure, I’ll definitely look for you,” Zhou Wen replied with a smile.

They cleared one torture chamber after another. Although Li Xuan cried out tragically, he managed to hold through them all. Finally, he arrived in front of the Wooden Horse Punishment torture chamber.

Li Xuan looked inside and his expression changed when he saw the wooden horse with horns on its back. Just as he was about to retreat, Zhou Wen kicked him into the wooden horse room.

“Holy sh*t, Zhou Wen, you tricked me... Ah...” Li Xuan’s cursing suddenly stopped. Then, there was a tragic cry and dead silence.

“Quickly finish it.” Zhou Wen didn’t look inside and covered his eyes with his hand as he shouted.

A minute later, Li Xuan limped out. His eyes were filled with tears as he wore a look of despair as though he was a maiden who had been defiled by a hundred men.

His lips trembled as he held his buttocks with one hand and pointed at Zhou Wen with a trembling finger. After a while, he said, “F*ck you.”

Zhou Wen lowered his head and whispered like an old monk, “Ahem, form is emptiness and emptiness is form. Everything else is fleeting. It doesn’t exist. It doesn’t exist.”

“F*ck your not existing. My first time is gone just like that. I feel that I’m not pure anymore. I’m already sullied...” Li Xuan looked up at a 45-degree angle as though he was holding back his tears.

“Don’t worry. No one saw it. I covered my eyes,” Zhou Wen said with a fawning smile.

“Cover my ass! The gap between your fingers was bigger than the Grand Canyon,” Li Xuan said angrily.

“Ahem, aren’t you able to heal yourself? It’s fine. You’re completely fine now. Let’s forget about the past. It won’t affect anything anyway,” Zhou Wen said carefully.

“Shut up.” Li Xuan glared at him. “Be honest. Are there such punishments further on?”

“Probably... Perhaps... There’s still... some... I guess...” Zhou Wen stammered.

“F*ck it, I quit,” Li Xuan said angrily.

“You’ve taken the Companion Beast. Didn’t you say that there’s definitely no problem? Didn’t you say that it’ll be alright?” Zhou Wen said.

Li Xuan’s lips moved, but he didn’t say a word for a while. Finally, he said hatefully, “Blame my luck for getting in too deep. Tell me honestly, how many more such punishments are there?”

“About three... four... five... six... seven... eight...”

“How many?”

“Nine.”

“Zhou Wen, screw you. You will die a horrible death.”

Despite cursing, Li Xuan could only bite the bullet and walk to the next torture chamber.

An Tianzuo and company were curious as to what torture chamber it was that nearly made Li Xuan fall out with Zhou Wen. As their progress was much slower than Zhou Wen and company’s, they hadn’t seen the situation inside the Wooden House Punishment torture chamber.

When they walked over to take a look, their expressions immediately changed. Their expressions when they looked at Lu Bushun became odd.

Lu Bushun’s face was also somewhat pale. He felt his throat go dry. His lips quivered, but he didn’t say a word. All he did was gulp.

“Let’s head over now.” In the end, it was An Tianzuo who gave the order. He led the others over, leaving Lu Bushun and An Jingyu in front of the Wooden Horse Punishment torture chamber.

Lu Bushun closed his eyes and gritted his teeth before charging into the torture chamber.

In an hour, Li Xuan could withstand more than thirty punishments, while Lu Bushun could do about twenty plus. The main reason was that An Jingyu’s Time Acceleration wasn’t as effective as Zhou Wen’s words, so Lu Bushun was a little slower.

After suffering more than half the tortures, everyone could clearly sense that something was amiss with Lu Bushun.

Although his body looked like it had recovered, his expression was ugly. His expression was extremely grotesque as his body seemed to tremble slightly.

“Commander Lu, there’s no need to force it,” An Tianzuo said to Lu Bushun.

Lu Bushun looked at Li Xuan in front of him. Although Li Xuan kept screaming, he still persisted. Furthermore, his condition didn’t seem as bad as Lu Bushun’s.

“Overseer, don’t worry. I can still persist. I won’t embarrass our Sunset Army.” As Lu Bushun spoke, he strode towards the next torture chamber.

However, when Lu Bushun came out, he became even more beaten.

How did he persist all this time? Lu Bushun already knew the horror of consecutive punishments. Every time he was tortured, he felt as though he had entered hell. The pain had exceeded the limits of what humans could endure. Furthermore, as the number of punishments increased, the pain continued to increase.

Now, whenever Lu Bushun looked at a torture chamber’s door, he felt a kind of forbidding horror. It was as though it wasn’t a door but the entrance to hell.
