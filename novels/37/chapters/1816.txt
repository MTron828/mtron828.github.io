Chapter 1817: Ginseng Fruit

Translator: CKtalon

A huge pot was propped up in the hall. The firewood below burned fiercely as the oil in the pot bubbled.

Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Zhang Chunqiu stood in front of the oil pot as Xia Liuchuan clicked his tongue from the frying.

Xia Liuchuan was surrounded by mystic light as he struggled with the hot oil. His head was covered in sweat as he wore a constipated expression. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After being fried for half an hour, Xia Liuchuan came out of the pot.

Zhang Chunqiu was also thrown into the oil pot by a mysterious force. Purple light rose from his body as he sat cross-legged in the oil pot, easily enduring the punishment of being fried.

When it was Li Xuan’s turn, he took the oil pot as a bathtub.

Li Xuan had suffered all sorts of torture in the past; this whipping and frying were nothing to him.

When it was Zhou Wen’s turn, he wasn’t thrown into the pot and was given a free pass.

“That’s not fair!” Li Xuan shouted. “What kind of crappy place is this? Why don’t you get whipped or fried?”

“You have to believe that good people can live a peaceful life,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Who are you calling evil?” Li Xuan was depressed.

Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.

In a place like Wuzhuang Daoist Temple, there was no distinction between good and bad people. To not be tortured, Zhou Wen definitely had a unique ability to render Wuzhuang Daoist Temple’s powers ineffective. This was extraordinary.

“As expected of Human Sovereign,” Zhang Chunqiu sighed.

The four of them passed through the main hall and arrived at the courtyard at the back. Under Zhang Chunqiu’s lead, they arrived at a separate courtyard.

There was indeed a huge tree growing in the yard. The crown of the tree covered the sky, and the leaves were like black iron. There were white baby-like fruits sitting cross-legged. It was the Ginseng Fruit Tree.

“The Ginseng Fruit Tree is just like the legend in Journey to the West. It’s invulnerable to metal. The ginseng fruits can only be struck down with special tools. It’s impossible to pluck it with brute force. Furthermore, the fruit will escape when it touches the ground. It has to be caught by a jade plate. We have to find the Golden Strike used to strike the fruit first. We need to work hard to find it,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“It’s just a fruit. As long as you are strong enough, how can you not be able to hit it? If you can’t hit it, that’s because you aren’t strong enough. Let me give it a try.” With that said, Li Xuan flew up and slashed at one of the ginseng fruits that were connected to the tree branch.

Clang!

The ginseng fruit didn’t suffer any damage. Li Xuan refused to believe it and used all his strength to slash a few more times. The ginseng fruit swayed left and right, but it didn’t suffer any damage.

“What crappy fruit is this…” Li Xuan was depressed again.

“We’ve already tried all sorts of methods. Apart from finding the Golden Strike, we really can’t strike it down.” As Zhang Chunqiu spoke, he turned to look at Zhou Wen. “Zhou Wen, do you want to give it a try? If you can hit it, it will save us the trouble of looking for the Golden Strike. We’ve been searching for some time, but we still haven’t been able to find it.”

“I don’t mind giving it a try.” Zhou Wen took the jade plate from Zhang Chunqiu and flew to a fruit.

Legend had it that it took 9,000 years for the ginseng fruit to ripen. One sniff could make one live 360 years, and eating one could make one live 47,000 years.

Zhou Wen took a sniff, but he didn’t smell anything.?From the looks of it, not all legends are accurate.

He counted a total of 72 fruits on the tree. Without any hesitation, he placed the jade plate under a fruit and reached out to grab a ginseng fruit, about to yank it off.

To his surprise, just as his hand touched the ginseng fruit, it fell and was easily plucked by him.

Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan widened their eyes. Zhang Chunqiu had just made a passing remark and didn’t believe that Zhou Wen could really pluck it.

However, the situation now seemed off. Not only did Zhou Wen pluck it, but he also did it rather easily.

Zhou Wen flew to another ginseng fruit and reached out to pluck another one.

This time, Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan’s mouths gaped open. Even if they obtained the Golden Strike, each of them could only pluck one. Zhou Wen plucked two with his bare hands, making it no different from plucking a pear or an apple.

Zhou Wen threw the jade plate with the two ginseng fruits to Zhang Chunqiu before moving again without waiting for them to say a word.

Like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, he plucked all the remaining ginseng fruits on the tree in a jiffy. The ginseng fruits vanished from his hand one by one, and it was unknown where they were placed.

“Thank you for leading the way, Brother Zhang and Brother Xia. Let’s cooperate again in the future if there’s a chance. We’ll be leaving now.” With that said, he strode off with Li Xuan.

Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan were stunned for a long time before Xia Liuchuan said, “Is he still f*cking human? He’s a beast.”

“I originally had some concerns about moving my entire family to Guide Ancient City. From the looks of it, we should take action as soon as possible. I’m afraid only this person can deal with the tumultuous changes after Earth suffers a complete break out’,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a heavy expression.

“My family doesn’t really care. After all, the Xia family only exists in name. It doesn’t matter where we move to,” Xia Liuchuan said with a smile.

After returning home, Zhou Wen took out the ginseng fruits and placed them in front of Li Xuan. Li Xuan picked one up and stuffed it into his mouth.

The fruit that was as hard as iron when growing on the tree melted in his mouth and turned into a sweet liquid that flowed into his stomach.

Just as Li Xuan exclaimed how sweet it was, white smoke emitted from all his pores. Soon, he was enveloped by water vapor.

After a while, the water vapor completely dissipated. Li Xuan’s skin was crystalline like jade as he shouted, “Awesome! I actually advanced to a new realm, going from the Human Realm to Hell!”

“There’s actually such an effect?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised as he pointed at the remaining ginseng fruits and said, “Eat a few more and see if you can directly advance to the Apocalypse grade.”

To his surprise, Li Xuan shook his head and said, “Power that doesn’t come from self-cultivation is ultimately a building without a base. I’m afraid there will be trouble in the future. One fruit is enough.”

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised that Li Xuan had such an awareness.

“Put away the remaining ginseng fruits. They might be useful in the future.” Li Xuan smiled and said, “Try one too.”

Zhou Wen ate one and found it extremely sweet. A clear feeling gushed through his body. Although his Essence Energy increased, he didn’t advance like Li Xuan.

From the looks of it, advancing to the Apocalypse grade isn’t that easy. However, it’s not impossible if I eat more.?With a thought, Zhou Wen planned on grinding Wuzhuang Daoist Temple again in-game to see if there were any ginseng fruits there.

However, before that, he gathered Feng Qiuyan, Ming Xiu, Qin Zhen, Zhang Yuzhi, and the others over and gave each of them a ginseng fruit.

Everyone advanced a level after eating it.

The ginseng fruit was magical. Regardless of whether one’s level was high or low, eating one could advance one realm. If someone at the Human Realm ate it, they would reach Hell. If someone at Hell ate it, they would reach Heaven.

And if a Mortal ate it, they would only become Legendary.

Everyone ate their fill. Zhou Wen put away the remaining ginseng fruits and didn’t let them eat too much. Just as Li Xuan had said, although these external factors were good, they lacked tempering. Their levels rose, but their realms were unstable. It was ultimately not the right path.

After returning to his room, Zhou Wen took out his phone and dripped his blood into the Wuzhuang Daoist Temple dungeon. Soon, he arrived in front of the ginseng fruit tree. Indeed, there were 72 ginseng fruits hanging on the tree.
