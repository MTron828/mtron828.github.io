Chapter 678: Determining Its Attributes

Translator: CKtalon

No one dared to act rashly. They just watched.

Everyone wanted the white elephant Companion Egg, but no one dared to send a Companion Beast into the mountain temple. The death of the Epic immortal crane was truly shocking.

Although Zhou Wen felt that his Mythical Companion Beast was likely capable of withstanding the golden light emitted by the monk-robed skeleton, he was afraid that the golden light from the crystal would erupt again. When that happened, even a Mythical might not be able to withstand it. To sacrifice a Mythical Companion Beast for a Mythical Companion Egg, with the possibility of not getting it back made it too risky.

An Tianzuo and Leng Zongzheng didn’t let their Companion Beasts enter the mountain temple. Clearly, they had the same qualms.

Two Mythical creatures had died. No one dared to enter the temple to grab the Companion Eggs. There were no new changes in Dragon Gate Grotto.

Qin Wufu had already ordered the troops to disperse and rest. The soldiers and officers returned to their respective positions. As for the Epic experts from the noble families, they sized up the Companion Egg unwillingly and tried to think of ways to get it out.

In the end, they lost several Epic Companion Beasts and failed to enter the mountain temple.

Zhou Wen ultimately held back his urges and didn’t let his Mythical Companion Beast enter. Before figuring out the origins of the monk-clothed skeleton and the crystal, taking risks meant death.

“Young Master Wen, Chancellor Leng wants to see you,” An Sheng said as Zhou Wen was loading the supplies.

Zhou Wen put down his work and followed An Sheng to Leng Zongzheng’s office.

When Zhou Wen arrived, he realized that An Tianzuo and Qin Wufu were there. Zhou Wen pretended not to see An Tianzuo and only greeted Chancellor Leng and Qin Wufu.

“Little Zhou, come and have a seat.” Qin Wufu warmly invited Zhou Wen to take a seat.

Only then did Leng Zongzheng say, “You all saw what happened in the mountain temple. What are your thoughts?”

Qin Wufu said, “Chancellor, do you think the golden crystal in the skeleton’s hand is the legendary Relic?”

“There’s a possibility, but Relics are Buddhist treasures. Logically speaking, they shouldn’t have such destructive force,” said Leng Zongzheng.

An Tianzuo thought for a moment and said, “I do have an idea. Perhaps that monk-robed skeleton isn’t a dimensional creature from Dragon Gate Grotto.”

“Go into the detail.” Leng Zongzheng gestured for An Tianzuo to continue.

An Tianzuo continued, “When we saw him sitting cross-legged in his monk robes, we thought he was a dimensional creature from Dragon Gate Grotto. However, the power he used, including the crystal, looks different from the Buddhist-type creatures I’ve seen before.”

“That’s right.” Leng Zongzheng nodded calmly.

An Tianzuo added, “From my point of view, he’s the same as the white elephant and the golden bird. They are all eyeing the things inside Dragon Gate Grotto’s mountain temple. However, he entered rather early, so he occupied the spot. The white elephant’s target isn’t him, but the stone house behind him. In conclusion, the thing that caused Dragon Gate Grotto to mutate might very well be inside that stone house.”

“Tianzuo’s guess coincides with mine. The golden-winged bird and the monk-robed skeleton are top Mythical creatures. If we want to achieve anything, I’m afraid we won’t be able to avoid competing with them. We need to make early preparations.” After Leng Zongzheng said that, he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “When the time comes, you can enter the mountain temple with us. You have to be prepared to fight the golden-winged bird and the monk-robed skeleton. If you have any worries, tell me ahead of time.”

“Yes, I’ll prepare well,” Zhou Wen answered.

Leng Zongzheng nodded and continued, “Let’s say that the monk-robed skeleton isn’t a dimensional creature from Dragon Gate Grotto, nor is he a Buddhist-tye creature. Which type do you think it is?”

Qin Wufu pondered and said, “I’ve seen quite a number of dimensional creatures over the years, but this is the first time I’ve seen such power.”

Seeing Leng Zongzheng look at him, An Tianzuo shook his head and said, “I’ve never seen it before.”

Seeing that everyone was unsure of the skeleton’s strength, Leng Zongzheng said, “Since that’s the case, let’s start from judging the skeleton’s Strength stat.”

Zhou Wen listened to their discussion from the side and didn’t say a word. After all, he was still too young. The dimensional zones and dimensional creatures he had come into contact with were limited. His experience couldn’t compare to the few people present, so all he could do was listen to their discussion. It would also broaden his knowledge.

Leng Zongzheng and company planned on using the most primitive and most effective method to probe what kind of dimensional creature the monk-robed skeleton was.

The method was very simple. It was to use the principle of attribute strengths and weaknesses. They would send Companion Beasts of similar strength but of different types into the mountain temple.

Then, they could observe the reactions after being attacked by the golden light in the mountain temple. If they were strong or weak against it, they would definitely have different reactions. They might die quickly or last a little longer.

By using these minute differences, one could roughly deduce the monk-clothed skeleton’s type. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Of course, this method had a premise. Among the Companion Beasts used for testing, there had to be existences that were strong or weak against the monk-robed skeleton or they would be useless.

After the discussion ended, An Sheng was in charge of the probe. Zhou Wen didn’t receive any assigned missions as he continued his preparations.

The test didn’t go smoothly. An Sheng used nineteen different Legendary Companion Beasts to test, but he didn’t find anything abnormal.

Finally, he felt that it was likely that a Legendary Companion Beast was too weak. Even if it was strong or weak against it, it was difficult to show it. They had to use Epic Companion Beasts in the second round of testing.

The results of the second round of tests were the same. Despite sacrificing more than ten Epic Companion Beasts, they still failed to figure out the attributes of the monk-robed skeleton.

The only thing they could confirm was that the monk-robed skeleton wasn’t a Buddhist-type.

Zhou Wen kept thinking about how he could safely get the white elephant Companion Egg out, so he was also studying the attributes of the monk-robed skeleton.

Unfortunately, there wasn’t an anomaly in Dragon Gate Grotto in-game, nor was there a mountain temple or monk-robed skeleton. There was no way to test it in-game.

After some thought, Zhou Wen had an idea.

Primordial Spore’s Life Providence was Eternal Immortality. Although its stats weren’t high, it wasn’t easy to kill it.

Even the Golden Overlord Sword’s golden sword beam, which had the augmentation of Ever-Victorious and Unstoppable, couldn’t kill Primordial Spore. This showed how powerful the Eternal Immortality Life Providence was.

At present, Zhou Wen only knew that there were two types of skills that could directly kill Primordial Spore—Bright Torch Vision World and Tai Sui’s innate talent.

Therefore, Zhou Wen thought of letting Primordial Spore enter the temple to give it a try. Perhaps he might discover something.

Having made up his mind, Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate any further. He released Primordial Spore and allowed it to float slowly towards the mountain temple.
