Chapter 996: Choices ABC

Translator: CKtalon

After leaving the shop, Li Xuan asked Li Benyu, “Brother Li, if it’s convenient, can you tell me what’s going on with this Joseph?”

“This...” Li Benyu was a little hesitant.

Li Benyi said angrily, “What’s there not to say? That Joseph is an ingrate.”

After Li Benyi’s explanation, Zhou Wen and company finally learned the details.

Just as they had guessed, Joseph’s mother and Li Benyu’s wife were biological sisters. When Joseph was around twelve, his parents entered a dimensional zone and never returned—Joseph became an orphan.

Therefore, Li Benyu and his wife adopted Joseph. Although they couldn’t say that they treated him the same as Li Benyi, they tried their best to take care of him, allowing him to live a carefree life. They even gave him various resources and opportunities.

On the surface, Joseph was respectful and kind to them. When he grew up, he even helped run the factory. Who knew that he would secretly siphon off funds in the factory and nearly caused the factory to close down?

Only then did Li Benyu suspect that there was something wrong with Joseph. If not for his deceased mother, it would have been enough to send him to jail.

As for the details, Li Benyi didn’t say much. However, one could tell that it wasn’t Joseph’s sole instance. Now, he was even thinking of targeting their Mythical Companion Egg. He was extremely shameless.

Li Xuan and Zhou Wen were taken aback when they heard that. They never expected such a person to exist in the world.

This wasn’t hearsay. They had seen Joseph’s face with their own eyes today. It was no wonder Li Benyi hated him so much.

“To think that such a person would be fancied by a Guardian. From the looks of it, the Guardian’s standards aren’t that great,” Li Xuan said.

Li Benyi pursed his lips and said, “Do you know what Joseph’s Guardian’s name is? His name is Lie.”

“The Guardian ranked 14th?” Li Xuan and Zhou Wen immediately thought of the Guardian on the rankings.

“Yes. Although Joseph has never said what his Guardian’s name is, it can’t be hidden once he’s on the rankings. I’m guessing that he must have obtained this Guardian in the Maze of Lies. It’s obvious that Joseph and his Guardian aren’t good people,” Li Benyi said. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Zhou Wen had previously heard from Sadie and company that the Maze of Lies was a famous dimensional zone near Frost City.

In the Maze of Lies, one absolutely couldn’t speak the truth. Once one spoke the truth, they would be killed by the taboo power inside. Therefore, humans who entered the maze typically sealed their mouths to prevent themselves from speaking, lest they trigger the taboo power.

After all, it was impossible for an ordinary human to not tell a single truth.

“Dad, why did you stop Zhou Wen just now? Let Zhou Wen use Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui to defeat him. Let’s see how arrogant he can be,” Li Benyi said.

“He has a Guardian. Don’t take it to heart.” Li Benyu was actually afraid that Zhou Wen would be injured.

Although Tyrant Behemoth and Tai Sui might be very strong, just as Joseph had said, people now felt that Guardians were invincible. Companion Beasts were no match for them. Otherwise, how could Guardians be ranked at the top of the rankings? No Companion Beast’s ranking could surpass those Guardians.

Therefore, Li Benyu stopped them in time to prevent Zhou Wen and company from being injured by the Guardian.

“So what if he has a Guardian? One Tyrant Behemoth can defeat him, much less Tai Sui,” Li Benyi said.

“So in your hearts, my Guardian is so weak. It’s no wonder Uncle refuses to lend me the Companion Egg. It’s because you look down on my Guardian.” At some point in time, Joseph had followed them and heard Li Benyi’s words.

“Little Yi was just joking. Don’t take the child’s words seriously,” Li Benyu had no choice but to say.

“No, Little Yi has a huge misunderstanding about me and my Guardian. From the looks of it, I have to resolve this misunderstanding.” Joseph looked at Li Benyi and said, “Little Yi, since you think his Companion Beast is stronger than my Guardian, why don’t we make a bet? Let him fight me. If he wins, it will prove that your words are correct. I won’t mention borrowing Companion Eggs again in the future. If he loses, why don’t you lend me your Companion Egg?”

With that said, Joseph added with a smile, “Since you are so confident in his Companion Beast, you wouldn’t be afraid to accept my challenge, right?”

Before Li Benyu could say a word, Li Benyi said, “Of course I dare. However, Zhou Wen and company are guests. I can’t trouble them.”

Joseph looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Little Yi is so confident in you. Don’t you want to help him?”

Li Benyu hurriedly interjected, “Joseph, they are the family head’s guests. Don’t mess around.”

However, Joseph curled his lips and said, “What guest of the family head? Aren’t they just Lance and Sadie’s friends? Lance has already been defeated by me. When I’m free in the future, I’ll defeat Sadie and let the family know who the real genius is.”

“Are you sure you want to challenge me?” Zhou Wen suddenly asked.

“Of course, if Little Yi is willing to let you represent him, I don’t mind letting him know that in this world, only the Guardians are truly powerful existences,” said Joseph.

“Alright, wait a moment.” Zhou Wen took out his phone and sent a message to Lance and Sadie.

After all, he was a guest invited by Lance and Sadie. It didn’t seem too good to kill the Guardian of the Ultimate Family Clan here, so he informed the two of them first.

Joseph was quite a distance away from Zhou Wen, but his eyes were good. He realized that the friend icon he was talking to belonged to Lance.

“You only want to investigate me now? Isn’t it too late?” Joseph said contemptuously.

He didn’t spend much effort defeating Lance because the latter was only at the Epic stage. He didn’t even have a Mythical Companion Beast, so he easily won with a Guardian.

Therefore, he was very certain that Lance didn’t have any information to divulge to Zhou Wen.

However, when Joseph saw Zhou Wen’s message, he nearly blew his top.

“There’s a person in your family named Joseph who wants to challenge me. As he’s from your family, I want to ask for your opinion. As for the three options below regarding the Guardian, which one is more suitable? Please reply with the letter as soon as possible.”

A: Beat him to death.

B: Cripple him.

C: Knock him out.

Then, Joseph realized that Zhou Wen had copied the message and sent it to Sadie as well.

Beep! Beep!

Soon, Lance and Sadie replied. Their answers were unanimous: “A.”
