Chapter 1594: Lusting Toad

Translator: CKtalon

However, its suction force immediately vanished when it came into contact with Zhou Wen’s Teacher Domain.

The toad continued sucking with all its might as it looked at Zhou Wen with eyes filled with greed.

If it wasn’t suppressed by the black metal column and couldn’t rush out, it would have long lunged at Zhou Wen.

At that moment, Zhou Wen realized that the black metal column had penetrated the toad’s body and nailed it into the rocks at the bottom of the river.

Every time the toad breathed, the black metal column rose a few meters and was slowly squeezed out of its body. Large amounts of blood spewed out during the process.

Although Zhou Wen was very willing to fight powerhouses, that was typically against humans. He always took advantage of any weakness of dimensional creatures to kill them.

Sword Domain activated as countless Sword Pill particles charged at the toad. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

However, when the Sword Pill particles rushed out of the Teacher Domain, they were immediately sucked into the toad’s mouth. Then, their connection with Zhou Wen was severed as though they had been sucked into another space.

This skill is somewhat similar to Behemoth’s! Zhou Wen bombarded the toad with Sword Pill particles, but no matter how many there were, they would be sucked into the toad’s mouth. Not a single one was left.

Treally would have been helpless against you in the past. Zhou Wen saw the metal column in its body rise higher and higher as though it was about to be completely pulled out. Without any hesitation, he charged at the toad.

‘As Zhou Wen approached, the domain enveloped the toad.

‘When the Teacher Domain completely enveloped the toad, Zhou Wen discovered a magical scene. The powerful suction force that erupted from the toad’s mouth instantly vanished.

It felt as though the toad’s power was blocked.

The sanctified light on the toad’s body instantly dimmed. The toad’s body lost its luster as its originally snow-white crystalline body turned into a charcoal-like color.

Without the terrifying suction force, the resplendent defense over its body vanished. The Sword Pills surged toward the toad without any obstruction. Countless Sword Pills struck the toad like billions of arrows piercing through its body.

The toad’s body was covered in holes. Blood and poison flowed out. It looked disgusting and terrifying, making one feel nauseous.

The toad roared angrily, but it couldn’t release its strength that could only circulate within its body. However, its body was nailed to the bottom of the river by the metal pillar, preventing it from escaping.

The pitiful toad was crushed to pieces by Zhou Wen’s Sword Domain. Its body was completely shattered by Sword Pill, dyeing the river red.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to head over to take a look and see if there were any Companion Eggs, he suddenly saw a strange light fly out of the toad’s flesh. It charged into the cosmos like a laser and vanished in the blink of an eye.

What was that? Zhou Wen frowned slightly as he looked up at the sky, but he couldn’t see anything in the cosmos.

Crack! Crack!

The huge metal pillar suddenly began to shatter. Furthermore, the originally hard metal seemed to turn into mud. It melted into the water the moment it made contact with the water. It was a shadow of its former hardness.

Zhou Wen used his sword domain to ward off the river water before searching the toad’s flesh. He saw that there seemed to be crystalline moonlight seeping out of the flesh as he peeled it open.

There was a jade artifact inside. A moonlight-like halo seeped out from the artifact.

What’s this? Zhou Wen extended his hand and sucked the artifact over.

The artifact was crystalline. It looked like a basin carved from flawless jade. Even the jade basin emitted a blurry glow.

Zhou Wen rummaged through the flesh again, but he didn’t find anything like a Calamity Essence or Companion Egg. There wasn’t even a dimensional crystal.

What’s this? Zhou Wen held the jade basin and looked at it for a while.

He had never seen anything similar in a dimensional creature’s body. This wasn’t a dimensional crystal or a Companion Egg. There seemed to be a mysterious force circulating in the jade basin, but it was different from the toad’s powers.

‘The metal pillar had already turned to mud and sank to the bottom of the river. Zhou Wen searched the bottom of the river again, but he didn’t see the legendary underwater city, nor did he discover any water ghosts.

There’s only one toad under the huge Yellow River? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

It clearly hadn’t been a day or two since the toad had been suppressed at the bottom of the river. Why did it suddenly want to escape when he arrived? This was too much of a coincidence.

Just as he returned to the river surface, Zhou Wen suddenly saw someone drinking and roasting meat by the river bank.

Jing Daoxian? Zhou Wen immediately frowned when he saw the person.

“This alcohol isn’t bad. Try it.” Jing Daoxian threw the wine flask at Zhou Wen.

“That Companion Egg is yours?” Zhou Wen didn’t drink from it as he threw the alcohol flask back.

“The Skyimmortal Swan Companion Beast isn’t bad, right?” Jing Daoxian said with a smile.

“So it was you causing trouble. What do you want?” Zhou Wen asked.

Jing Daoxian drank a mouthful of alcohol and took another mouthful of meat. As he chewed, he said, “The Skyimmortal Swan Companion Beast is pretty good, but incubating it will definitely alarm the toad. There aren’t many humans on Earth who have the ability to finish it at the bottom of the river.”

Zhou Wen looked at Jing Daoxian without a word. He didn’t believe that Jing Daoxian would give him the Skyimmortal Swan Companion Egg for this reason.

“Do you know the story of a toad lusting after a swan?” Jing Daoxian asked with a smile.

“Isn’t it just a story of a toad wanting to eat swan meat?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Young man, you should read more. The protagonists of this story are actually two immortals. One is called Toad Immortal, while the other is Swan Fairy. At Queen Mother’s Immortality Peach Banquet, Toad Immortal saw the beautiful Swan Fairy and was momentarily unable to restrain his emotions. He

tried to molest Swan Fairy. In her rage, Queen Mother casually threw a Moon Essence Basin at Toad Immortal, stopping him from molesting Swan Fairy and banishing him to the mortal world.”

“To everyone’s surprise, the Moon Essence Basin fused into Toad Immortal’s body and could no longer be extracted. As the Moon Essence Basin was a gift from the Moon Goddess, Queen Mother felt some regret. She wanted the Moon Essence Basin back after allowing Toad Immortal to return to the

Heavenly Courts after experiencing certain trials.”

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred when he heard Jing Daoxian’s story. Could it be that the jade basin is the Moon Essence Basin?

“That’s ultimately a myth. Even if that toad is really Toad Immortal, it might not be the same as the myth,” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s indeed different, but the Moon Essence Basin does exist. Furthermore, it’s already in your hands, right?” Jing Daoxian said with a smile..
