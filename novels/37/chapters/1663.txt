Chapter 1664 Mohe

It was unknown if it was news released by the dimension itself, but the entire Federation soon learned that the various races of the dimension had chosen their representatives among humans.

They could obtain the resources of the dimensional races and enter a high-level world like the dimension to cultivate. They could obtain the pointers of dimensional experts, and he didn’t even have to sell their lives to the dimension like Saints. All they needed to do was sign a contract and help the dimensional races find something on Earth to terminate the contract.

Even if the contract wasn’t terminated, other than searching for such a thing, the representative could also reject the other requests of the dimension and not work for them.

Almost everyone was tempted by such conditions. It was more like a partnership. Without really selling one’s life to the dimension, one could obtain all sorts of benefits. Where else could one find such a good deal?

Everyone felt that this was a good thing, but the people who really received the invitation were watching. Very few people directly accepted the invitation.

Things were too good to be true, so it inevitably made people suspicious, afraid that dimensional powerhouses would tamper with the contract.

Although Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu had already decided to head to the dimension for cultivation, they didn’t immediately head there. They still decided to wait for the people from Guide City to be evacuated into the ancient city before heading to the dimension after everything had stabilized.

This process went very smoothly. There were many buildings in the ancient city to begin with, so all they needed to do was draw up plans for the distribution. In this aspect, Li Xuan had found experts from the Li family, and the Zhang family was a top expert in this area. After discussion, they quickly came up with a plan. Hundreds of thousands of people methodically migrated into the ancient city.

The migration wasn’t difficult. The difficult part was how to form a self-sufficient supply chain in the ancient city and provide livelihoods to the residents. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

It was impossible for Zhou Wen to provide for them for no reason. Excessive kindness could backfire, and kindness wasn’t something that could be easily given. Hundreds of thousands of people needed to pay a price for something. Otherwise, if they relied on Zhou Wen’s providence, chaos would definitely ensue in the future.

The quality of the hundreds of thousands of people were varied and their combat abilities were basically very low. Zhou Wen didn’t expect them to really fight. Those who could fight were given the chance to hunt dimensional creatures to exchange for supplies. Those who didn’t have combat abilities were employed in farming, livestock raising, business, education, and administrative work.

These complicated plans and work were basically handled by Li Xuan and the Zhang family, with the Xia family involving themselves a little. Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to put his mind on this.

Apart from grinding dungeons daily, Zhou Wen focused more on how to advance his various Essence Energy Arts to a domain.

I have to advance to the true Calamity grade as soon as possible. After some thought, Zhou Wen decided to make another trip to Luoyang. Firstly, he had to bring Ya’er back. Secondly, he had to make a trip to Small Buddha Temple in real life to see if he could find the opportunity for Small Perfection of Wisdom Sutra to advance to the Calamity grade. “The Cube has lit up again. Another person is challenging the Star Palace dimensional zone.”

“Eh, it’s actually a human. Furthermore, it looks a little familiar.”

“Isn’t that a famous loser from the Family Clan of Gods? The inept Mohe? Why is he challenging the Cube’s Star Palace? Does he have a death wish?”

“That’s not right. How did he enter? Don’t four people have to be together to open the Cube? Would the Family Clan of Gods sacrifice three lives to send Mohe up? What’s the

point?”

It was no wonder people were surprised. Mohe was quite famous in the West District and even the entire Federation.

Of course, it was infamy. Born in a family like the Family Clan of Gods, not only was Mohe’s talent and aptitude surprisingly poor, but he only condensed a Life Providence at the age of twenty to become a Legendary.

More exasperating was his Life Providence; it was extremely useless. It was called “Harming Others Without Benefiting Oneself.”

The useless God of Unkilling Life Providence that the Dugu family produced only meant that one couldn’t kill. Mohe was even more extreme. If Mohe were to harm others, not only would others be fine, but he would end up injured.

The simplest example was when Mohe slashed at someone’s neck with a saber. The person would end up fine, but Mohe would have his own head chopped off.

Of course, Mohe had never really tried chopping off the heads of others. When he went to hunt dimensional creatures, he suffered a backlash.

One could imagine how despairing it was for Mohe, who had finally condensed a Life Providence after twenty years of hard work and was excited to hunt dimensional creatures.

Since then, Mohe had become a joke of the Family Clan of Gods.

Although no one dared to say anything about Mohe in front of the Family Clan of Gods, in private, Mohe’s “reputation” had already spread throughout the Federation. He was famous for being a loser.

Now, Mohe had actually ascended the Cube and entered Dubhe Palace. It was no wonder those who knew him were surprised.

Everyone stared at the screen in a daze. Most people felt that Mohe’s actions were no different from suicide. Perhaps there was no need for the Calamity-grade Starlord Ravenous Wolf to do anything. Just the high temperature in the Star Palace was enough to kill Mohe.

Mohe stood in the Star Palace with a mocking smile. In the high temperature, a strange light rose from his body. Countless light beams intertwined, forming a black Guardian armor around him.

“So he contracted a Guardian. However, even if he has a Guardian, what’s the point when he has such a useless Life Providence? Ignoring the fact that his Guardian might not be able to defeat Starlord Ravenous Wolf, even if he can, would he dare kill Starlord Ravenous Wolf? Wouldn’t killing Starlord Ravenous Wolf be equivalent to killing himself?”

“What’s the Family Clan of Gods thinking? Isn’t getting Mohe up there killing him?” “I think the Family Clan of Gods also feels that it’s too embarrassing with this loser around. Therefore, they deliberately sent him to his death?”

As everyone discussed, Mohe had already walked towards the Star Palace’s door. Without any hesitation, he pushed the door open and walked in.

As they watched Mohe approach step by step, Starlord Ravenous Wolf finally reacted. His fist bloomed like a purple sun as a terrifying glow enveloped the entire Star Palace.

Seeing the Star Palace devoured by the light, everyone thought that Mohe was doomed. However, in the next second, everyone widened their eyes.

Boom!

The light exploded as Mohe continued walking slowly amidst the light. As for the Starlord Ravenous Wolf that attacked Mohe, its body suddenly exploded, turning into light dust that filled the sky before disappearing.

“How can this be?” Everyone’s mouths gaped open for a long time.

As for Mohe, he had already passed through the teleportation nexus and arrived at Merak Star Palace. He pushed open the Star Palace door again and faced the huge mountain-like Starlord Titan Gate.

Starlord Titan Gate roared angrily as his fist struck at Mohe with supreme divine power.

However, Mohe continued advancing slowly. He didn’t even look up at Starlord Titan Gate as though he didn’t take his fist seriously.

Boom!

Starlord Titan Gate’s huge fist smashed down as though it could reduce Mohe’s tiny body to dust with one strike.

However, in the next second, while Mohe stood there unharmed, Starlord Titan Gate’s body exploded like a watermelon from head to toe. Everyone was dumbfounded as they watched this shocking scene in a daze.
