Chapter 338 A Farewell Gift

The divine statue’s radiance was dazzling like a divine tower that reached the sky.

A godly glow spread out across the sky, bathing the entire Holy City. Those who knew of the radiance of the Holy Tower were overjoyed.

The six Senators were also overjoyed. After decades, the Holy City’s brilliance finally appeared in front of everyone once again.

“This is the real Holy City. This is the Holy Brilliance that can stir the souls of everyone. With the Holy City around, the League is eternal...” a Senator said feverishly, his eyes burning with excitement.

Shen Yuchi was also excited. To be able to accomplish such a great thing was undoubtedly a great contribution all thanks to the Special Inspector Bureau.

In front of the Holy Tower, the entire altar was lit up with a bright Holy Brilliance. The humans inside seemed to melt like snow.

Shen Yuchi and the six Senators were not surprised because they already knew that such a thing would happen. Back when the six families first activated the Holy Tower, something similar had happened. How could a human be able to taint the holiness of God? Once the Holy Tower was activated, everything on the altar would be purified. This was something that couldn’t be avoided.

No human could survive on the altar, including the six heroes of the past. They knew very well how terrifying the power of the Holy Tower was. It was a power that came from the six Holy Temples. Other than the mighty existences within the Holy Temples, no human could withstand it.

Zhou Wen felt his body being corroded by the intense Holy Brilliance. He hurriedly summoned the Stone Chi and transformed into a stone armor to protect his body. However, the armor rapidly melted under the terrifying Holy Brilliance as though it was being eaten by termites.

Jiang Yan and the others were in similar circumstances, looking extremely uneasy.

“Teacher, let’s escape now,” Zhong Ziya said as he slashed at the brilliance before him. However, his sword ended up being melted. He failed to deal any damage to it.

“Escape? Why would I escape? I came here to wait for this moment.” Wang Mingyuan looked at the resplendent statue in front of him with a determined gaze.

“Teacher, what are you trying to do?” Although Zhou Wen had always felt that Wang Mingyuan wouldn’t harm them, everything Wang Mingyuan was doing now was beyond his imagination.

Wang Mingyuan turned his head and said to Zhou Wen and company, “We’re master and disciple after all. There are some things I need to give to you. Just treat it as Wang Mingyuan’s final inheritance in this world. Keep it as a memento.”

Crack!

The shackles on Wang Mingyuan’s body split apart automatically and fell to the ground like garbage. Before they landed on the ground, they were melted by the Holy Brilliance.

Wang Mingyuan exuded a strange power that blocked the Holy Brilliance, preventing his four students from suffering any more damage from it.

Zhou Wen looked at the power emitted by Wang Mingyuan and felt that it was somewhat familiar. However, he couldn’t figure out the reason for its familiarity.

Wang Mingyuan had been held for many days. He was probably only left with his prison uniform. However, when he extended his palm into the void, he seemed to tear through it as he grabbed something out of thin air.

It was a thick diary that looked old, but it was very well-preserved. Zhou Wen had seen it in the past. It was a diary that Wang Mingyuan had always carried with him. Whenever he had any ideas and inspiration, he would jot them down in the diary.

“Jiang Yan, your personality is the most similar to mine and you like research. This contains my years of experience and thoughts. I’ll give it to you,” Wang Mingyuan said as he handed the diary to Jiang Yan.

Jiang Yan took the diary with both hands, saying nothing.

Wang Mingyuan didn’t say anything further. The power around him grew stronger, his body seemed to be affected by it. It was as though he was gently trembling. Zhou Wen could even see the rippling power flowing around him.

Wang Mingyuan took out another sheathed sword and handed it to Zhong Ziya. “You’re too extreme, so it’s inevitable that there will be some deviation in what you do. Perhaps giving this sword to you will be of some help to you.”

Zhong Ziya remained silent as he received the sword and stared straight at Wang Mingyuan.

Wang Mingyuan knew what Zhong Ziya wanted to hear, but he didn’t tell him anything. Instead, he took out something else and handed it to Hui Haifeng. “You have great ambitions and will definitely accomplish much in the future. These are the savings that I’ve saved over the years. They’re useless now. Take them.”

“Yes, Tutor.” Hui Haifeng didn’t decline it. He respectfully received the small box, unsure what it contained.

Finally, Wang Mingyuan’s gaze landed on Zhou Wen as he said with a smile, “You are the simplest of the four of them. You don’t have as many thoughts and desires as the three of them, but you’re also the most difficult to understand. Although I know what you want, I can’t do it now. Apart from that matter, what other wishes do you have? There’s no harm in telling me.”

At this moment, the power on Wang Mingyuan’s body was almost tangible, transforming into streams of light that constantly circulated around his body. The familiar aura Zhou Wen sensed intensified.

Now, Zhou Wen finally remembered where he had felt such an aura. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Beneath the Dragon’s Well, the white cocoon protected by the White Dragon contained the same aura. However, the white cocoon’s aura was very weak, so weak that it was almost undetectable. This left a very vague impression on Zhou Wen.

However, Wang Mingyuan’s aura was very strong. It was so strong that it left Zhou Wen stifled.

Could it be that Teacher... Zhou Wen had an extremely nasty thought as he looked at Wang Mingyuan.

“I don’t have much time. Answer me. What do you want?” Wang Mingyuan had a strange expression as his entire body trembled. His voice seemed to be suppressed.

Zhou Wen looked at Wang Mingyuan with some bitterness. After a moment, he said, “Teacher, can you give me a drop of your blood?”

Zhou Wen’s words stunned Wang Mingyuan, Zhong Ziya, and company. Wang Mingyuan looked at Zhou Wen and smiled. “You’re indeed the most difficult person to understand.”

With that said, Wang Mingyuan ignored Zhou Wen. He slowly turned around and back faced the four of them as he gazed at the resplendent statue.

“I’m really very happy to spend time with you guys. Unfortunately, things must always come to an end. Today, we shall bid each other farewell. From now on, we will be unrelated. As a final farewell, I’ll give you another tiny gift.” With Wang Mingyuan’s trembling words, the power in his body exploded, spewing out like an erupting volcano as his body changed.

The black hair on his head instantly turned white and quickly grew. It almost reached the ground, and a pair of crystal-like horns grew on his head. His entire body was undergoing an unusual transformation.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wen and company couldn’t see Wang Mingyuan’s face; otherwise, they would definitely discover that his face had turned handsome and strange. His eyes emitted an indescribable odd glow.

That terrifying power rose up from his body like countless divine beams of light that surrounded him. His clothes moved without any help from the wind as his body floated up to the statue.
