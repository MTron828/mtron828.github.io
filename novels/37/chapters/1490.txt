Chapter 1491 Battling the Golden Qilin

The terrifying sword aura that erupted from the Immortal Culling Sword couldn’t be ignored even by the Golden Qilin.

The Golden Qilin’s sharp claws welcomed the Immortal Culling Sword with a dazzling golden light. Its speed was so fast that it was a blur in Zhou Wen’s vision. He almost couldn’t tell the true trajectory of the claws.

Clang! The Immortal Culling Sword collided with the claw beam with the former’s sword beam tearing apart. However, when the claw beam touched the Immortal Culling Sword’s blade, it was severed. Even the Golden Qilin’s blade-like nails were sliced apart by the Immortal Culling Sword’s blade.

Zhou Wen immediately understood that his strength was much weaker than the Golden Qilin. The reason he could sever the claw beam’s nails was because of the Immortal Culling Sword’s sharpness.

With the Immortal Culling Sword in hand, Zhou Wen used the Heart Defying Sword Art. Coupled with the ability of The Disqualified, he slashed at the Golden Qilin, again and again, targeting each strike at its vital spots.

The Golden Qilin seemed to realize the sharpness of the Immortal Culling Sword and didn’t clash with it head-on. Its figure moved like a phantom as it constantly moved around Zhou Wen, causing his attacks to miss.

Even though Zhou Wen used instant transmission, he couldn’t keep up with the Golden Qilin’s speed.

What puzzled Zhou Wen was that the Golden Qilin didn’t seem to attack with all its might. It seemed to be waiting for something.

What’s it waiting for? Zhou Wen was puzzled. He knew that he couldn’t delay any further. He had to finish off the Golden Qilin as soon as possible or escape Laojun Platform.

The Immortal Culling Sword slashed apart the golden beams as it delivered a barrage of attacks at the Golden Qilin. An ancient mirror appeared the instant the Golden Qilin dodged, Zhou Wen having predicted its next location.

The rainbow beam in the ancient mirror shone out and landed on the location of the Golden Qilin.

On the left was the Numinous Treasure Hall, and on the right was a wall. Although the Golden Qilin was very fast, Zhou Wen had predicted its location. It had to either resist the Soul Mirror’s Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light or the Immortal Culling Sword.

In its horror, the Golden Qilin twisted its body and jerked its body to duck the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light. However, the Immortal Culling Sword had already arrived above its head.

At the instant the Immortal Culling Sword slashed down, Zhou Wen felt a strong sense of unease.

Clang!

The Golden Qilin headbutted the Immortal Culling Sword, its golden horn colliding and sending it backward.

The Immortal Culling Sword failed to slice through its golden horn. Instead, Zhou Wen involuntarily retreated due to the powerful impact. The Immortal Culling Sword nearly flew out of his hand.

The Golden Qilin’s eyes were ferocious as it shot out golden beams that struck Zhou Wen’s chest.

Zhou Wen had already lost his balance from the powerful shockwaves. At that close distance, he was unable to control his body to quickly duck.

How sinister! Zhou Wen cursed inwardly.

The Golden Qilin clearly had a long-range attack, but it pretended to be a melee creature while fighting Zhou Wen. It could clearly block the Immortal Culling Sword, but it pretended that it couldn’t fight him head-on.

This was the first time Zhou Wen had encountered such a wretched and sinister dimensional creature with such powerful strength.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen had already realized that something was amiss. As the Immortal Culling Sword slashed down, he used Spacetime Bandit and instant transmission.

Due to Spacetime Bandit, instant transmission only took effect now. Zhou Wen instant transmitted and when he arrived beside the God of Fortune Hall, the Golden Qilin’s golden beam immediately missed and struck the wall of the Numinous Treasure Hall.

The golden light on the wall of the Numinous Treasure Hall exploded, producing a shockwave that sent the distant Zhou Wen retreating. If he was struck head-on, the outcome was obvious.

When the Golden Qilin saw its attack miss, it didn’t conceal its strength any further. It unleashed its explosive speed as the golden beam in its eyes constantly swept at Zhou Wen.

Combining his movement techniques and instant transmission, Zhou Wen dodged the golden beam as he found an opportunity to approach it. He wanted to use the Immortal Culling Sword to kill it.

However, the golden horn on its head was abnormally hard. It blocked several of the Immortal Culling Sword’s strikes. He only left some shallow marks on the golden horn, so it probably wouldn’t be easy to sever it.

The man and beast fought crazily on Laojun Platform. The Soul Mirror occasionally shot out the Soul-Extinguishing Divine Light, but it was difficult to hit the Golden Qilin.

Before long, Zhou Wen sensed something amiss. He didn’t know what effect the Golden Qilin’s domain had, nor did he discover any effects the golden light had on him during the battle.

However, with the passage of time, Zhou Wen finally discovered the effects of the golden light. Furthermore, he realized that he was in danger.

Zhou Wen could clearly sense that the radiance was intensifying wherever the golden light shone, gradually condensing into something corporeal.

Moving in the golden light felt like he was moving in water. The resistance increasingly became immense. Zhou Wen suspected that he would be trapped in the golden light and unable to move to a certain extent.

Damn it! Zhou Wen knew that he was in big trouble.

This domain power was similar to a type of control or imprisonment, but this power didn’t directly affect him. Instead, it filled the nearby space. Therefore, Evil Nullification and the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder were useless. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

What should I do? Zhou Wen could already sense the pressure the golden light gave him.

Even if he used the Immortal Culling Sword to slash at the golden light, it was only like a blade slicing through water. He couldn’t truly sever it. After the Immortal Culling Sword slashed at it, the golden light would return to normal.

Zhou Wen found it harder and harder to move. Finally, Zhou Wen failed to dodge in time. The golden light shot out from the Golden Qilin eyes struck his chest.

Bang!

At the instant Zhou Wen’s chest was struck, the Soul Mirror appeared. The golden beam shot into the mirror and was reflected back, landing on the Golden Qilin itself.

The golden light sliced through its golden scales. The Golden Qilin roared in pain as blood gushed out from its wound.

Immortal Slaying! Zhou Wen knew that this was his last chance. It was very difficult for the same tricks to be effective on the Golden Qilin again. Whether he could escape alive after this strike was a question.

The Golden Qilin roared in pain as its neck was completely exposed in front of Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen instantly slashed at its neck with the Immortal Culling Sword.

Just as he was about to hit its neck, the Golden Qilin suddenly lowered its head and bit the Immortal Culling Sword. At the same time, it lowered its head and slammed into Zhou Wen’s body with its golden horn.

Ding!

The ring on Zhou Wen’s other hand flicked out and transformed into the Bamboo Blade. Zhou Wen drew his saber and stabbed forward, meeting the eye of the Golden Qilin that came falling right onto it.

Blood gushed out as the Bamboo Blade tore through its eye. The Golden Qilin shook its head crazily and sent Zhou Wen flying with the saber.

Bang!

Zhou Wen’s body slammed into the wall of the main hall. The Prisoned Dragon armor on his body caved in, but the wall remained undamaged.

Roar! The Golden Qilin’s eye bled as it stared at Zhou Wen with its other eye and roared angrily.

With its roar, the surrounding golden light instantly froze. It was like a golden jelly that trapped Zhou Wen.
