Chapter 1811 Two Stories

“Zhou Wen, from the looks of it, we are the ones who can truly become partners.” Jing Daoxian’s youthful voice left Zhou Wen very confused.

“Us?” Zhou Wen had never felt that he and Jing Daoxian would become partners. Not in the past nor in the future.

“Don’t you understand? At the end of the day, you are just a scapegoat Zhou Lingfeng found. He used you to replace Earth’s Companion Beast. If I hadn’t made that female Immortal lose her human body, guess what would have happened?” Jing Daoxian said.

“She would snatch the item in the box and very likely kill me, the original owner,” Zhou Wen answered.

“That’s right. Zhou Lingfeng is using you as a tool, and I’ve been tricked by him. The enemy of an enemy is a friend. Don’t you think we should be the best partners?” Jing Daoxian said.

However, Zhou Wen suddenly smiled and said, “You seem to be very afraid of my father. According to what I know, his combat strength isn’t strong. With your strength, why do you have to implicate me if you want to find trouble with him?”

“That’s why I said that you were deceived by him. He has never treated you sincerely, nor does he have any feelings for you. Do you really think that Zhou Lingfeng is such a simple person? If he’s really that simple, do you think he can take away Earth’s Companion Beast from Nüwa Temple? Would he be able to design a way for you to replace Earth’s Companion Beast? Besides, Ouyang Ting is very likely backing him.” Jing Daoxian snorted coldly. “At the end of the day, Zhou Lingfeng and Ouyang Ting are the same kind of people. They are both sanctimonious schemers. Only Wang Mingyuan has some humanity.”

Zhou Wen didn’t agree with Jing Daoxian’s words, but he was somewhat surprised that Jing Daoxian’s evaluation of Wang Mingyuan was above Zhou Lingfeng and Ouyang Ting’s.

“I hope we will be friends instead of enemies in the future.” Zhou Wen wasn’t in the mood to continue arguing with Jing Daoxian. After bidding farewell to Liu Yun, he left by himself.

With The Thearch on Chess Mountain, it was useless unless Earth’s Companion Beast came itself.

Zhou Wen only wanted to meet Zhou Lingfeng and ask him why he had done all of this.

Zhou Lingfeng seemed to have expected Zhou Wen to come looking for him. Before Zhou Wen could head to Luoyang, he was already waiting for him in Guide Ancient City.

“You met The Thearch?” Zhou Lingfeng leaned against the wooden chair in the pavilion, admiring the setting sun. His first sentence surprised Zhou Wen.

“Yes.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly before asking, “Is An Jing the baby you carried out of Nüwa Temple?”

“Yes.” Zhou Lingfeng nodded.

“Am I your biological son?” he asked again. “In the flesh.” Zhou Lingfeng smiled.

“Is Ouyang Lan really my biological mother?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“Of course. Why would I lie to my son?” Zhou Lingfeng sighed.

“Since I’m your son, why did you make me take the risk on behalf of An Jing?” Zhou Wen wasn’t afraid of taking risks, but he needed Zhou Lingfeng to give him an explanation.

“It’s not that I wanted you to replace An Jing, but you came this far yourself,” Zhou Lingfeng said.

“What do you mean?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“I didn’t give you the phone. I didn’t expect you to be able to activate it, nor did I expect you to master the Lost Immortal Sutra.” Zhou Lingfeng sighed and said, “I originally wanted you to live a peaceful life, but you chose this path yourself.”

“Wasn’t it arranged by you? If you hadn’t exchanged An Jing for me, why would Jing Daoxian give me the Lost Immortal Sutra?” Zhou Wen curled his lips.

“It’s normal for him to give you the Lost Immortal Sutra. You shouldn’t have been able to master it, but you did.” Zhou Lingfeng paused before continuing, “This should be the influence of that phone, right? Actually, I still haven’t figured out why you can activate that phone. In theory, that phone can only be used by An Jing. I’ve tried many times in the past, but I haven’t been able to activate it.”

“Because she’s Earth’s Companion Beast?”

“No, because it was specially prepared for her by her mother.”

“Isn’t her mother Nüwa or should I say, Earth?”

“Of course not. Why do you think Prisoner was dug out?” Zhou Lingfeng sighed. “Since you’ve already been to Nüwa Temple, The Thearch should have lost her qualifications. It’s time to tell you. I’ll start from the beginning.”

.

Zhou Lingfeng’s story was very simple. A mother gave birth to a baby, but the baby was about to die due to a congenital defect.

In order to extend the baby’s life, the mother had put in a lot of effort and even sacrificed her life to come to a special planet. She dug out the life that was originally born within the planet and replaced it with her child. She used the energy of the special planet to maintain her daughter’s life.

In order to do all of this, she had nearly exhausted her life. She wasn’t able to accompany her daughter as she grew up. She originally wanted to leave something behind for her daughter, but due to an accident, some important things were lost. The original setup couldn’t be fully completed.

This matter happened to be known by the four of them, so they went to the place their mother had prepared, hoping to obtain the things she had left behind.

In the end, the four of them obtained something. One of them obtained the child.

The person didn’t know what the other three had obtained. In fact, the other three also wanted to know what that person had obtained. They had been investigating each other for years.

SOL

The person who obtained the child was the weakest and most useless among the four of them. However, he knew that he couldn’t let the other three obtain the child. This was because once this child awakened, it would be the end of Earth. The other three might not care about this. They were capable of anything in order to obtain strength.

In order to protect the child, the person had no choice but to come up with a solution. He swapped his child for the child, making the other three people who were secretly observing unsure if the child was useful. All they could do was observe in secret and not completely fall out with him.

If nothing went wrong, the three of them would slowly realize that the child wasn’t the child they imagined. They would naturally give up.

However, to their surprise, an accident really happened. The child convinced the three of them that he was that woman’s child.

“According to what you said, The Thearch has seen An Jing before. Why didn’t she discover that An Jing is Earth’s Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Because she didn’t know that Earth’s Companion Beast was that woman’s child, nor did she know that the child was so weak that she should have died long ago. Everyone believed that Earth’s Companion Beast would be very strong, but they never expected that Earth’s Companion Beast was actually very weak. It relied on Earth’s special energy to survive. She’s not much different from ordinary humans. As long as she hasn’t awakened, no one can tell the difference between her and ordinary humans.” Zhou Lingfeng sighed and said, “Thankfully, there was an accident. The mother’s plan didn’t completely succeed. The phone she left for the child and the Companion Beast that was meant to be the child’s first Companion Beast were accidentally lost on Earth. If things had really gone according to her plan, Earth would have long been doomed.”

“In that case, is it true that Grandfather picked up the phone and Companion Egg?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. He originally imagined that those were just meant as a cover.

“Of course it’s true. If we hadn’t obtained Earth’s Companion Egg, we wouldn’t have discovered Chess Mountain, much less enter to explore and find those things and discover those secrets.” Zhou Lingfeng continued, “All these years, I only know that Jing Daoxian obtained the Lost Immortal Sutra. I still haven’t figured out what Father-in-law and Wang Mingyuan obtained. However, they must have obtained more than me and Jing Daoxian. This is because only the two of them saw the ship. They obtained what was on it.”

“You and Ouyang… What’s going on between you and Auntie Lan?” Zhou Wen couldn’t think of anything else to ask, so he asked another question he had been trying to figure out.

“Didn’t I tell you? Mutual love between two people is a beautiful love story,” Zhou Lingfeng said with a smile.

“But…” Zhou Wen wanted to say that this love story was too immoral, but he couldn’t say it out loud. “I know what you’re thinking.” Zhou Lingfeng curled his lips and said, “Then I’ll tell you another story.”

There was once a large family with generations of talented people, but in the recent generation, none of the boys in the family amounted to much.

They were either prodigal sons or ordinary people with average talent.

If it were an ordinary family or ordinary era, it would have been fine. At most, they would have squandered their family assets.

However, in such an environment, if the family was really reduced to ruin, they probably wouldn’t even have a way to survive. Their enemies would devour the entire family until nothing was left.

Thankfully, there was always a way out. That family gave birth to a girl with extreme talent that no one could match.

However, she was a girl, so it was difficult for her to inherit the family business.

“What era are we in now? Why are you still favoring boys over girls?” Zhou Wen curled his lips. He didn’t like this story at all.

“Times are changing, and views are changing, but the fundamentals haven’t changed. When a girl has a husband and her child, do you think she will have more plans for her husband and tiny family, or will she have more plans for her family clan? You have to know that back then, there were powerful enemies everywhere. Countless people had designs on that family. God knows how many men approached that girl. Was it for the girl herself or something else?”

Zhou Lingfeng continued, “So the girl’s parents thought of a way to raise her as a boy.”

“Wait, don’t tell me you’re saying that Auntie Lan’s first husband, the one from the An family, is a woman?” Zhou Wen suddenly understood as he asked with widened eyes.

“What do you think?” Zhou Lingfeng laughed. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Wen was extremely flabbergasted. He never expected things to turn out this way. It was no wonder Zhou Lingfeng had said that the An family’s descendant was infertile.
