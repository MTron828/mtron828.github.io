Chapter 1008: Multiple Dungeons

Translator: CKtalon

After leaving the underground ice cavern, Zhou Wen was still thinking about what Frod had said.

If the Holy Land was really related to that ship, and they had been in operation for so many years, secretly supporting humans to form the Federation, then their goal was clearly not simple.

What’s on Earth that even Calamity-grade dimensional creatures drool over? Zhou Wen still couldn’t figure it out.

However, he had already realized that Earth was definitely not as inferior as it looked. Many dimensional creatures on Earth had immense potential. Although their levels were relatively low, if they could develop, they might become existences that could make even the dimension tremble.

Ignoring everything else, Zhou Wen was certain that Torch Dragon would be extremely terrifying if it could advance to the Terror or even the Calamity grade in the future.

Agreeing to help Frod didn’t seem like a bad thing for Zhou Wen.

He had obtained some information regarding the Maze of Lies from the Ultimate Family Clan. Now, Zhou Wen finally knew why he could only see the Mischief Clown in the Maze of Lies.

This was because the Maze of Lies was actually a very special dimensional zone. This dimensional zone was split into seven different states. From Monday to Sunday, the Maze of Lies would undergo some changes every day.

It happened to be Monday when Zhou Wen cleared the Maze of Lies. This was the weakest day of the Maze of Lies, and there was only Mischief Clown on that day.

After Tuesday, there would be more and more terrifying dimensional creatures in the maze. Before Friday, all kinds of dimensional creatures below the Mythical stage would appear.

On Saturday, Mythical creatures were a certainty. As for the final Sunday, it was the most terrifying day in the Maze of Lies. All kinds of dimensional creatures would undergo huge changes on that day. Even the weakest Mischief Clown would have Mythical powers.

The Maze of Lies that day was no different from an abyssal hell. Furthermore, that was the only day that the mask would only appear.

Even with the Ultimate Family Clan’s present strength, it was impossible for them to conquer the maze on that day, much less kill all the dimensional creatures inside.

This was because after the mask was taken out, the seal on the Maze of Lies would vanish. Therefore, not only did Frod want to obtain the mask, but he also wanted to destroy all the dimensional creatures inside and completely have the Maze of Lies under control. Even if dimensional creatures entered through spatial rifts, it would only be a small number. Furthermore, with preparations in advance, the Ultimate Family Clan could deal with them easily.

The only thing Zhou Wen was worried about was that the last time he pulled out the stone saber, it triggered an anomaly in Guide City, causing more high-level dimensional creatures to appear.

If such a situation happened in the Maze of Lies, it would be troublesome. He wondered if the Ultimate Family Clan could handle it.

These weren’t problems that Zhou Wen needed to consider. The Ultimate Family Clan didn’t plan on immediately attempting the Maze of Lies, so they first got Lance to take Zhou Wen to the Maze of Lies to familiarize him with it. They themselves needed some time to make preparations.

Of course, Lance didn’t take Zhou Wen to the Maze of Lies on Sunday. However, it was too long to wait for Monday, so there was no need for that. Therefore, he chose to start on Thursday.

After Zhou Wen returned, he planned on understanding the Maze of Lies in-game before realizing that after he entered the game, it was still the Maze of Lies on Monday. There was only the Mischief Clown inside.

What’s going on? It’s clearly Wednesday today, right? Zhou Wen suddenly thought of a possibility.

He arrived in front of Maze of Lies and took another picture of the tiny palm symbol. In the end, the loading screen appeared again. Soon after the download was completed, two options—Monday and Wednesday—appeared when launching the Maze of Lies in-game.

Holy sh*t, this actually has multiple dungeons! Zhou Wen entered Wednesday’s Maze of Lies dungeon and indeed, he realized that Mischief Clowns weren’t the only ones. There were also Witches and Sorcerers.

Furthermore, the buildings in the Maze of Lies looked even more sinister and terrifying. The merry-go-round at the entrance had turned into one with skeleton horses with blood flowing from their eyes.

Therefore, Zhou Wen waited until Thursday before heading to Maze of Lies with Lance and company to download Thursday’s dungeon.

Standing in front of the maze, Lance said to Zhou Wen and company, “After entering the maze, make sure you do not speak. If you accidentally speak the truth, you will definitely die. Therefore, the best way is to not to say anything. Our family has a special silencer that can temporarily seal our ability to talk. This is the safest way. Also, to enter the Maze of Lies, there’s a very terrifying obstacle. You have to answer the question on the door before you can enter. Furthermore, the answer has to be a lie or you will be killed. This is because the questions are random and there are trap questions. Furthermore, the answers aren’t fixed for everyone. Many people died here. If you want to enter, you have to take a huge risk. If there’s no need, it’s best not to enter.”

Lance’s words were mainly directed at Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan. Even if they were powerful, they might die at the door if they answered wrongly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s best I don’t enter such a strange place. I’ll stay here to take care of Ya’er.” Unexpectedly, Li Xuan chose not to enter.

In fact, Li Xuan wasn’t as carefree as he usually appeared. He didn’t mind because it was built on the premise that he wasn’t in any danger. Li Xuan wasn’t willing to take the risk for no reason in a place that might prevent him from recovering.

However, Feng Qiuyan said, “Since I’m here, I want to enter to take a look.”

Sadie and Gulli didn’t plan on entering either. In the end, other than Zhou Wen, Feng Qiuyan, and Lance, there was only a silencer from the Ultimate Family Clan.

“Zhou Wen, go in first. With us around, we can give you some suggestions to prevent any problems. If you really aren’t confident, you can choose not to answer and quit. That’s the safest way,” Lance said to Zhou Wen.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen was somewhat uneasy. He had already secretly downloaded Thursday’s dungeon, so it wasn’t difficult to enter.

However, there would always be some baffling problems from the Maze of Lies. If he wasn’t confident, he could only use Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder to gain entry.

Zhou Wen stood in front of the door. A line of text immediately appeared on the ancient door that resembled a clown’s front teeth.

Everyone looked at the line of text, wanting to know what the problem was. However, the moment they saw the question, their expressions turned odd.
