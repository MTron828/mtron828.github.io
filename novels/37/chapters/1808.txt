Chapter 1809 A Loss in the End

The Human Sovereign Stone Saber slashed at The Thearch with terrifying might.

Clang!

The Thearch didn’t dodge. When the Human Sovereign Stone Saber came slashing in front of her, it seemed to strike an invisible metal wall. Not only did it fail to hit The Thearch, but Zhou Wen’s hand that held the saber also trembled and went numb. He nearly dropped the Human Sovereign Stone Saber.

“Jing Daoxian, what are you waiting for? Why aren’t you helping?” Zhou Wen shouted as he held the hilt with both hands and slashed at The Thearch again.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The repeated violent slashes didn’t even touch the edge of The Thearch’s clothes. They were blocked by an invisible barrier.

Jing Daoxian’s eyes flashed with joy. As he summoned his Companion Beast, his body burgeoned as he pressed his palm on the invisible barrier.

Jing Daoxian struck repeatedly, leaving overlapping bloody palm imprints on the invisible barrier. They were the blood flowing from his body.

“Attack the blood mark,” Jing Daoxian said as he struck.

Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate as he slashed at the bloody handprints left behind by Jing Daoxian.

...

Strangely, the invisible barrier that was stained with blood seemed to soften significantly. Although the Human Sovereign Stone Saber still failed to slice through the invisible barrier, Zhou Wen could sense that it seemed to have cleaved into something.

“Put away your saber and wait for me,” Jing Daoxian shouted again. At the instant Zhou Wen withdrew his saber, Jing Daoxian pressed down on the spot Zhou Wen had just slashed at. The blood smeared on an invisible spot and turned into a bloody gash.

The outline of the bloody mark revealed a saber gash that was several centimeters deep.

Jing Daoxian retreated after delivering one strike as Zhou Wen slashed at the same spot again, splitting open the saber gash.

With the two of them cooperating, the invisible barrier was split open bit by bit. The blade of Human Sovereign’s stone saber was getting closer and closer to The Thearch.

The Thearch watched the duo’s actions, but she didn’t do anything. She only said coldly, “Zhou Lingfeng really can’t produce anything good. You are the same as him-pitiful and shameless.”

Zhou Wen remained silent as he continued cooperating with Jing Daoxian. After ten consecutive strikes, he seemed to hear the sound of glass shattering as the invisible barrier was completely cleaved apart.

Zhou Wen and Jing Daoxian charged at The Thearch from both sides.

“Don’t listen to her nonsense. Subdue her and contract her while she has no ability to resist.” Jing Daoxian’s blood spewed out like rain as they ran at The Thearch.

It’s no wonder this old fellow often looks like a sick ghost. He sheds so much blood in every battle. It’s already a miracle that he’s not dead. Zhou Wen cursed inwardly, but the Human Sovereign Stone Saber in his hand didn’t stop as it slashed at The Thearch.

In the next second, Jing Daoxian and Zhou Wen’s expressions changed drastically.

The blood that Jing Daoxian had spewed out and Zhou Wen’s Human Sovereign Stone Saber landed on The Thearch, but they seemed to strike a phantom. They passed through her body without causing any damage.

“Skyfiend Disintegration, Boundless Blood Sea!” Jing Daoxian roared as the blood in him surged out of his pores, enveloping the entire cave and dyeing everything blood-red.

Jing Daoxian’s body turned as thin as a skeleton, but it wasn’t shriveled. Every inch of his muscles seemed to contain unimaginable terrifying explosive power, like a thousand-year-deceased devil that had crawled out of hell.

“Got you.” Jing Daoxian’s zombie-like face revealed a fanatical expression.

The Thearch’s figure vanished in the blood-colored light and reappeared on the jade box again. She remained chained as she sat on the jade box.

The blood stained her white clothes and beautiful face, forming a strange and enchanting scene.

“Success!” Jing Daoxian was overjoyed. As he struck out with his palm, the blood in the cave seemed to come alive. It surged towards The Thearch like thousands of blood-colored worms.

Zhou Wen retreated to the side and watched everything coldly.

“Kid, you sure know how to read the situation. After this old man becomes the number one person in the universe, you will definitely be blessed,” Jing Daoxian said in a hoarse voice when he saw that Zhou Wen hadn’t betrayed him.

Zhou Wen didn’t say a word as he watched coldly.

“What a ruthless person. What a ruthless heart.” The Thearch’s voice sounded from amidst the blood worms, but it sounded calm as always.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if The Thearch was talking about him or Jing Daoxian.

“If a man isn’t ruthless, how can he stand tall in this world?” As Jing Daoxian spoke, he walked towards The Thearch.

He seemed to carry a mountain with every step. Blood surged towards The Thearch even more crazily.

“Although humans are derivatives of Earth’s Companion Beast, they can only be considered as supplementary materials. They don’t have the aptitude to cultivate the Lost Immortal Sutra. To be able to modify the Lost Immortal Sutra to such an extent and cultivate it to this stage, you must have killed countless people and taken countless lives. You have also suffered unimaginable pain. You are indeed a ruthless person.” The Thearch changed the topic and said coldly, “But are you still you?”

“Haven’t you heard of the saying? Are those with titles necessarily more noble? As humans, why is Earth’s Companion Beast superior to others? Why can he master the Lost Immortal Sutra, but I can’t? I never believed in absolutes, and I was bent on mastering it. I even want it to be stronger than the original Lost Immortal Sutra.” Jing Daoxian approached step by step. His blood had already completely enveloped The Thearch’s body, making her look like a ball of blood.

“How pathetic. You still haven’t mastered the Lost Immortal Sutra. You’re just fooling yourself,” The Thearch said indifferently.

“It doesn’t matter what it is. What’s important is that I will be stronger, and you belong to me now.” Jing Daoxian finally walked in front of The Thearch and slapped the blood ball with one hand.

With Jing Daoxian’s palm strike, the blood ball seemed to find an outlet as all the blood gushed along the palm, surging into The Thearch’s body.

The blood ball instantly vanished. Jing Daoxian pressed his palm on The Thearch’s head, forming a blood-colored red dot on her forehead.

“Zhou Lingfeng was right. That flower is the source of Earth’s power, and you are the key to obtaining the power source.” Staring at the blood dot on The Thearch’s forehead, the ruthlessness in Jing Daoxian’s eyes intensified. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I see. I was wondering how you know so much. So it’s that shameless fellow, Zhou Lingfeng.” The Thearch sighed and said, “I should have known. He was the only one who came here. I just didn’t expect him to be so shameless. He sent you here to die because he didn’t dare come himself.”

“It’s useless no matter what you say now. I want this power.” Jing Daoxian exerted strength in his palm as the blood spot on The Thearch’s forehead became more and more gnarly. It transformed into blood threads that flowed through her veins and spread out like dense blood-colored spiderwebs.

“If I still had one-ten-millionth of my strength, how could I allow you to be so impudent? Forget it. Do I ultimately have to lose to him?” The Thearch sighed softly and slowly closed her eyes. With this sigh, The Thearch’s body underwent a strange change. Her skin split open like dry soil and crumbled piece by piece. Pfft!

Jing Daoxian spat out a mouthful of black blood as he retreated. He looked in horror at The Thearch’s cracked body.

The blood that Jing Daoxian had injected into The Thearch’s body dropped alongside the cracked skin. It was no longer under Jing Daoxian’s control.

Inside the cracked and peeling outer shell, a seemingly perfect body that looked like an immortal was reborn. It emitted an unparalleled immortal aura. It didn’t belong to the mortal world. Just a glance at it made one feel ashamed as though it was sacrilegious towards that existence.

The chains that bound The Thearch also fell to the ground with the mud casing.

“A loss in the end.” The Thearch didn’t even look at the exhausted Jing Daoxian as she sighed to herself.
