Chapter 1709 Nine Gates

Yang City County had a population of hundreds of thousands before the dimensional storm. Now, the number of people living in the city was less than 50,000. This was only because there weren’t many dimensional zones near Yang City County, and it was rare for break-out creatures to appear.

There were a few dimensional zones in Yang City County, but they weren’t very famous. He had never heard of them causing much of a stir. Before Zhou Wen came, he had read some information about Yang City County and guessed that if Kunlun Mountain was nearby, the most likely place would be the mountain known as Xicheng Mountain.

Legend had it that Xicheng Mountain was a place where the King of Shang prayed for rain. The locals also called it Holy King Square. As the surrounding cliffs were like a city and the middle was sunken like a basin, it was given this name due to it having four entrances in the north, south, east, and west.

The mountain was the typical Karst geographical terrain. There were limestone caves of all sizes on the mountain. There was a local saying that there were 72 single dragon nests, 124 ghost millstones, and 360 small metal pots. It was said that the huge limestone caves here could accommodate more than ten thousand people. However, ever since the dimensional storms, Xicheng Mountain became even more complicated. People who entered had a high chance of getting lost. Furthermore, no one saw any dimensional creatures inside.

There were too many dimensional zones that didn’t produce dimensional creatures with unknown secrets. Few people would take the initiative to explore them.

The reason Zhou Wen suspected that this was the Kunlun Mountain that Liu Yun had mentioned was that in the information he had found online, someone had indeed said that this was the legendary Kunlun Mountain of ancient times.

However, this saying was a localized rumor. Not many people knew about it. Zhou Wen had only seen it after searching the Internet. He had no idea that such a saying existed in the past.

“Junior Brother, you look radiant. You’ve been doing pretty well recently.” Just as Zhou Wen was sizing up Yang City County, Liu Yun crawled out of nowhere and grinned.

“You don’t seem to be doing well.” Zhou Wen looked at Liu Yun and realized that this fellow hadn’t advanced to the Calamity grade.

“There’s nothing I can do about it. The old fellow doesn’t let me go into the dimension. I can only rely on myself. I don’t know when I can advance to the Calamity grade. In my opinion, it’s a waste not to take the dimension’s resources. It’s great not to work after receiving the benefits,” Liu Yun grumbled.

Zhou Wen knew that the old fellow Liu Yun mentioned was Jing Daoxian. Liu Yun was apparently Jing Daoxian’s grandson. Zhou Wen wasn’t too sure if it was true.

What’s the situation now? Although Zhou Wen was curious about what Jing Daoxian had been up to, he knew that it was useless to ask, so he decided not to bother.

“You didn’t bring that chick over?” Liu Yun sized up Zhou Wen for a while before suddenly asking “Why should I bring it here?” Zhou Wen frowned. For Liu Yun to mention Chick, he clearly had some plans.

“Didn’t I tell you? There’s a phoenix in Mount Kunlun. That chick of yours should be a phoenix, right? If you bring it over, you might be able to get them to recognize each other as family. We might be able to get the sword without fighting,” said Liu Yun. “When did you tell me that there’s a phoenix on Kunlun Mountain?” Zhou Wen glared at him and continued, “Furthermore, not all phoenixes are relatives. How can there be such a good thing?” Zhou Wen didn’t bring Chick to a place like Kunlun Mountain on adventures. It was better to wait for Chick to advance to the Heaven Realm.

“I’m just saying. Let’s take a look at the situation first. If you are confident, we’ll carry out the heist. If you aren’t confident, we’ll retreat and discuss it further.” As Liu Yun spoke, he turned around and headed for the mountain.

“Don’t tell me the Kunlun Mountain you’re talking about is the Xicheng Mountain?” Zhou Wen asked as he walked.

“That’s right. It’s not an easy path. Only I, the number one thief in the world, can take people in and out freely. If it were anyone else, even the immortals in heaven probably wouldn’t be able to come out.” Liu Yun was smug as though he was speaking the truth.

“You haven’t improved much after all this time, but your bragging skills are getting better,” Zhou Wen quipped.

“I’m really not bragging this time. What kind of place is the legendary Kunlun Mountain? The home of all immortals. To put it bluntly, ordinary immortals are just ordinary villagers at Kunlun Mountain…” The two of them chatted as they walked and soon arrived in front of the mountain.

Xicheng Mountain wasn’t very steep. The mountain peaks formed a circle like slumbering tigers. It looked like a mountain city.

“There are four gates on Xicheng Mountain. They are also the four entrances to the dimensional zone. However, if you really enter through these four gates, you can forget about seeing what the real Xicheng Mountain looks like.” Liu Yun led Zhou Wen to the other side without walking towards the nearest entrance.

“Why?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

“There are four on the surface and five hidden entrances. In fact, Xicheng Mountain has a total of nine gates. Doesn’t the Classic of Mountains and Seas say that Kunlun is 800 leagues long and 10,000 fathoms high. Towering above is a tree that’s 30 meters tall and five-people wide. It’s a place in which a giant stalk of grain is growing, nine wells that are enclosed in jade thresholds, and where the nine city gates are guarded by animals called Kaiming. If Xicheng Mountain is really Kunlun Mountain, there naturally has to be nine gates,” Liu Yun answered. “What do you mean by ‘if?’” Zhou Wen frowned slightly.

“It’s just a guess. Although my guess is most likely correct, aren’t there always what-ifs? I’m precise with my words. I can’t guarantee something I’m not sure about,” Liu Yun spouted nonsense.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, Liu Yun stopped by a pool near a mountain wall. He pointed at the pool and said, “We’re here. This is one of the nine gates of Kunlun Mountain. Only by using this entrance can we see what the real Kunlun Mountain looks like.”

“There’s no rush. Let’s walk around first. Didn’t you say that there are a total of nine gates? Take me to all nine gates.” Zhou Wen sized up the pool and didn’t see the tiny palm symbol nearby.

Zhou Wen didn’t really care if he could enter Kunlun Mountain, but he had to find the tiny palm symbol.

“Apart from the four gates-north, south, east, and west-I only know of one. The other gates are hidden. I won’t be able to find them anytime soon. Besides, what’s so nice about those gates? Isn’t entry all that matters?” Liu Yun seemed a little anxious when he saw Zhou Wen turn around and leave.

“Why are you so anxious?” Zhou Wen turned around and sized up Liu Yun.

“Am I?” Liu Yun laughed, trying to brush the matter of.

“You’re getting anxious.” Zhou Wen nodded seriously. He felt that something was amiss with Liu Yun. He was definitely hiding something from him. “Sigh, I’m just anxious to obtain the sword as soon as possible. Look at how impressive Human Sovereign is. If I have that sword, my future achievements will definitely not be inferior to Human Sovereign. I might even be able to obtain the title of Stealer Sovereign… Hey… Don’t leave…” Liu Yun hurriedly chased after Zhou Wen when he saw him turn around to leave.

As the two of them were wandering around the vicinity of the mountain, an azure-robed woman was walking towards it. She was clearly dressed in a very ordinary outfit and didn’t look eye-catching, but upon careful inspection, nobody could see what she looked like. Even her figure was indescribable.
