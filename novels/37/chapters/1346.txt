Chapter 1347: Some Clues

Translator: CKtalon

Despite the tornado-like molten chocolate being close at hand, Zhou Wen had no intention of retreating. He used his fingers as a sword and stabbed forward.

Gao Dawei didn’t know why Zhou Wen was stabbing. In his chocolate demon form, he wasn’t afraid of physical attacks. Although the sword beam wasn’t a physical attack, its effects wouldn’t be much different.

However, in the next second, Gao Dawei was alarmed to discover that as Zhou Wen stabbed forward, invisible sword beams appeared around him and they spun at high speeds.

The number of invisible sword beams was uncountable as they enveloped Zhou Wen. When the molten chocolate transformed by Gao Dawei collided with the terrifying vortex of sword beams, the molten chocolate tornado was sucked in by the sword beam tornado.

The invisible sword beam tornado seemed to be quickly dyed with a layer of chocolate. Gao Dawei wanted to escape from the sword beam tornado, but he realized that he couldn’t.

There was an extremely strong suction force in the vortex. No matter how he struggled, he was still firmly sucked into it. Furthermore, countless sword beams spun and diced the molten chocolate into smaller blobs.

Gao Dawei was shocked. Although chocolate demons were unafraid of physical attacks, there was a limit. If the molten chocolate could not even maintain its most fundamental particle state, he would equally die.

Ordinary Terror-grade creatures shouldn’t have such an overwhelming advantage. Ordinary slicing attacks posed little threat to a chocolate demon. Even if a portion of the chocolate could be reduced to its fundamental particle form, it wouldn’t have much of an effect on the overall situation.

A chocolate demon’s true nemesis was the power of ice. Zhou Wen clearly wasn’t proficient in ice, so Gao Dawei wasn’t too worried.

However, he suddenly realized that the invisible sword beams around Zhou Wen were just too terrifying. They kept slicing the molten chocolate, quickly reducing them to their fundamental particles.

Gao Dawei had never seen such abnormal sword beams before. How could he know that Zhou Wen wasn’t purely using sword beams? It was the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. The sword beams were only the foundation for forming the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.

Zhou Wen was considered to be blessed by the heavens. The Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array was very powerful, but it also needed sufficient stellar power or sword energy to form its foundation. The stronger the foundation, the stronger the array formation.

If it were an ordinary person, even if they were at the Terror grade, the Essence Energy they had was limited. It was impossible for them to condense that much sword energy to form the foundation in a short period of time. Or perhaps it was because their Essence Energy was too scattered and the sword energy they condensed was too weak. It would definitely greatly weaken the strength of the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.

However, Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy was nearly infinite. Every sword beam from the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array could match a full-powered strike of the same level. The sword array formed was enough to crush a peer at the same level.

Although the chocolate demon was very strong, it could only be crushed when facing thousands of Terror-grade sword beams.

“No… that’s impossible… ah…” Gao Dawei was horrified to discover that the molten chocolate form he was in had already begun to vaporize under the attack of the sword beams.

“Stop… what questions do you have… I’ll tell you everything… Ah…” Gao Dawei screamed.

Zhou Wen’s finger froze as an invisible sword beam that resembled a tornado stood fixed in the air like a star in the night sky.

Only then did Gao Dawei fall to the ground and return to his human form. However, the chocolate armor on his body had shattered in many places. Gao Dawei himself was covered in wounds and bleeding profusely.

Around Gao Dawei’s body, countless sword beams surrounded him like a spherical prison. The tips of the swords were aimed at his body.

“I’m a very impatient person, so it’s best you cherish this opportunity. Don’t give me an answer that displeases me. You only have one chance.” Zhou Wen paused before immediately asking, “Do you know someone named Xiao?”

“I know of this person, but I’m not familiar with him. I only know that he’s a Saint of the Trajectory Holy Temple,” Gao Dawei said.

“How many Saints like Xiao are there in the Trajectory Holy Temple?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I’m from the Sun God Holy Temple. I don’t know much about the Trajectory Holy Temple. From what I know, there are 13 to 14 Saints there,” Gao Dawei answered without hesitation.

“Where did those Saints come from?” Zhou Wen continued asking.

Gao Dawei hesitated and did not answer immediately.

“Ah!” Gao Dawei let out a miserable scream as one of his arms was chopped off. In an instant, a bloody mist bloomed thanks to the invisible sword beams before it was vaporized.

“Orphanage! We all came from the orphanage!” Gao Dawei yelled.

“It’ll be your head next.” Zhou Wen continued coldly, “Which orphanage?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I don’t know where it is. I was too young at that time. I only know that it was an orphanage built in a valley. There were many orphans there. I have seen many of the Saints I know back in the orphanage. However, the orphanage is also divided into several different districts. They are separated from each other. I don’t know Xiao. Maybe he is an orphan from another district, or maybe he is younger and came later than me. But I can be sure that he came from the orphanage as well.” Gao Dawei did not dare to hesitate and finished his answer in one breath.

“Oh, since you’ve never seen him, how can you be sure that he came from the orphanage?” Zhou Wen looked at Gao Dawei with interest.

“That’s hard to explain. People from the orphanage have a special air about them. Others can’t tell, but I can tell at a glance.”

“Can the air be seen?” Zhou Wen snorted coldly.

Gao Dawei hurriedly explained, “I didn’t make myself clear. Air is just a metaphor. It means that everyone who comes out of the orphanage has a special… how should I describe it…”

“Bearing?” Zhou Wen finished his sentence.

“Yes, it’s bearing. It’s that kind of air that they exude. It’s just like how soldiers have the air of soldiers. Even if they’re wearing home clothes, you can tell at a glance that they have been in the military. The people from the orphanage have a special air. Ordinary people can’t feel it, but I can. They’re the same kind,” Gao Dawei explained.

Zhou Wen thought to himself,?From the looks of it, it’s very likely. These Saints are most likely orphans nurtured by Dugu Qianqiu.

After some thought, Zhou Wen asked, “Which Holy Temple is Professor Ouyang in?”

“Which Professor Ouyang?” Gao Dawei was stunned.

“How many Professor Ouyangs are there in your Holy Land?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Two or three,” Gao Dawei answered after some thought.

“Then brief me on all of them.” Zhou Wen was delighted.. After investigating for so long, he was finally close to the truth.
