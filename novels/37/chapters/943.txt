Chapter 944: Sea Return

Zhou Wen’s phone suddenly rang. He looked at the number and saw that it was from Hui Haifeng.

After the call connected, Hui Haifeng’s solemn voice sounded. “Zhou Wen, are you looking at the cube’s challenge?”

“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Don’t you find that Ya a little familiar?” Hui Haifeng asked again.

“You also think he looks like Zhong Ziya?” Zhou Wen said directly.

Hui Haifeng fell silent for a moment before saying, “He seems to have Teacher’s shadow on him.”

Zhou Wen originally believed that he was reading too much into it, but now, even Hui Haifeng thought so. It looked like there was a high chance that Zhong Ziya had chosen an extremely difficult path.

“Perhaps we are reading too much into it. Perhaps that isn’t Zhong Ziya at all,” Zhou Wen said.

Hui Haifeng said with a bitter smile, “The possibility of us making a recognition mistake at the same time is slim. It’s best we make plans early. Running away won’t solve the problem.”

“What do you have in mind?” Zhou Wen asked. He didn’t even know where Zhong Ziya was, nor could he think of any solutions.

“Do you still remember the question Teacher asked us back then?” Hui Haifeng asked.

“Yes, two paths,” Zhou Wen answered.

“I want to try the first one,” Hui Haifeng said.

“How?” Zhou Wen asked.

“In the dimensional zones, we discovered quite a number of strange materials. For example, common materials like Essence Gold and Essence Crystals. There are also some that aren’t common. I want to try and see if I can figure out something that can fight dimensional creatures. Humans have used their intelligence to become the masters of Earth for thousands of years. Perhaps this time, we can still rely on our intelligence to win,” Hui Haifeng said.

“This path isn’t easy.” Zhou Wen knew how difficult this path was. The An family had invested so many resources, but the things they had researched weren’t very useful against Mythical creatures.

“Someone has to walk over to the edge to see if that’s the end of the world,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.

“Then walk the path. Perhaps there’s a new world ahead,” Zhou Wen said.

“I don’t care if there’s a new world. I just want to keep the past.” Hui Haifeng paused before saying to Zhou Wen, “Wen, don’t take that path.”

Zhou Wen knew which path Hui Haifeng was referring to, but he fell silent. He didn’t know if he would take that path.

If the Lost Immortal Sutra didn’t work, he had to choose between a Guardian and Spirit Casting. Zhou Wen felt that he might choose the Spirit Casting path, so he couldn’t answer Hui Haifeng.

After a long silence, Hui Haifeng finally broke it with a soft sigh. “Alright, if you really take that path one day, I hope that you can still see me when you want to turn back.”

Zhou Wen forced a smile and said, “You make it sound like I’m walking on a path of no return. I have my own path. If my luck isn’t too bad, I probably won’t choose that path. Don’t worry.”

“Come to Sea Return to visit me when you have the time. I’ll treat you to some rare seafood.”

“Alright, I plan on traveling soon.”

The two of them tacitly stopped the previous topic and agreed to meet at Sea Return.

Although Sea Return and Sea Gazing City’s names were similar, their positions were very different. Sea Gazing City bordered the East Sea, while Sea Return bordered the South Sea.

Zhou Wen remembered that Feng Qiuyan came from Sea Return. Furthermore, the Feng family was rather famous there.

Zhou Wen wondered if he should inform Feng Qiuyan and see if he wanted to return with him. That way, he could have a guide.

Now was clearly not the time to think about this. Zhou Wen watched the livestream again. Great Skyfiend didn’t accept the challenge. The countdown to accepting the challenge was only twenty-four hours.

After waiting for half an hour, he still didn’t see Great Skyfiend accept the challenge. Zhou Wen called Feng Qiuyan and told him that he was heading to Sea Return soon. He asked if he wanted to go with him.

“Coach, it’s not very peaceful over at Sea Return. There are often break-out creatures coming ashore. Many people have moved inland. Why are you going to Sea Return?” Feng Qiuyan asked in surprise.

“I have a senior over there. I want to visit him,” Zhou Wen said.

“Those who remain in Sea Return now are basically those who have family businesses there. That senior shouldn’t be an ordinary person, right?” Feng Qiuyan asked.

“Hui Haifeng,” Zhou Wen said his name. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“As expected. The Hui family has quite a number of mineral mines in Sea Return. They are also most determined to defend Sea Return.” Feng Qiuyan explained the situation to Zhou Wen in detail.

The situation was worse than Zhou Wen had imagined. Apart from the cities guarded by humans, most of the areas had break-out creatures. It was almost impossible to distinguish between dimensional zones and non-dimensional zones.

There were many break-out creatures that came out of the sea. Furthermore, they were very difficult to deal with. Sea Return had three relatively large families taking the lead. Together with more than ten small families, they formed the forces of Sea Return City that had been fighting the break-out creatures all this time.

The Hui family and the Feng family were two of the bigger families. Feng Qiuyan came from the Sea Return Feng family.

Feng Qiuyan got Zhou Wen to wait. He wanted to apply for leave from school before accompanying Zhou Wen back to the sea.

As the two of them were talking, there was a sudden commotion on the cube. Great Skyfiend accepted the challenge and descended into the cube arena in the void.

Everyone’s gaze was immediately attracted by Great Skyfiend. The scene of Great Skyfiend destroying Heavy-Armored Titan with one strike surfaced in many people’s minds.

Ya stood in the arena and calmly looked at Great Skyfiend as though he didn’t know how terrifying it was.

Uesugi Nao had been in a bad mood recently. Her progress in Luoyang hadn’t been smooth. She had already tried many solutions, but she was unable to obtain any information regarding the Essence Energy weapons from the An family.

Although she had seen An Tianzuo a few times, he never talked shop at home.

Back in the An family residence, An Tianzuo wasn’t as domineering as the rumors said. He was no different from an ordinary young man.

Not only was there no progress in the mission, but she was also continuously challenged. This made her somewhat vexed.

Although Uesugi Nao chose to accept the challenge, she didn’t dare let her guard down.

She had already seen Primordial Sword Immortal’s might the previous time. It was an existence even more terrifying than Orochi. Now that someone had entered the rankings with Primordial Sword Immortal, this person was likely similar to her—someone who had contracted a Guardian.

However, Uesugi Nao couldn’t tell if Ya was someone who had used a Guardian. Typically, when people with Guardians fought, Guardians would fuse with humans. They would be donning Guardian armor, but Ya was wearing a Companion Beast armor.

Uesugi Nao accepted the challenge because she wanted to know the origins of Ya.
