As people discussed, Grim Demon felt extremely uncomfortable standing in the arena.

This was supposed to be a stage where he slaughtered everyone and made everyone tremble in fear. He wanted people to know that he was back, but now, he could only stand there and do nothing.

Although he had already tried his best to appear cool and powerful, Grim Demon was extremely displeased when he thought about how he would have to admit defeat in the future.

That detestable human. If it wasn’t for Her Lady Demonic Neonate, I would have blasted him to pieces, Grim Demon thought gloomily.

Since he was only here to stall for time, Grim Demon closed his eyes and waited for time to pass.

After an hour, Grim Demon suddenly felt that something was amiss. Opening his eyes, he realized that the Invisibility Cloak had been forcefully ejected from the cube’s arena, and he had won.

What’s going on? Grim Demon was pleasantly surprised as he thought to himself, It’s not my fault. That thing admitted defeat.

Zhou Wen wasn’t the only one stunned by this sudden development. All the humans on Earth were stunned.

Soon, people realized what had happened.

“Isn’t this too much of a bully? How can a Companion Beast be judged to lose within an hour while a Guardian is judged to have won?”

“It’s unfair!”

“I’ve seen shameless people, but I’ve never seen such a shameless person. If you want to deem it as the loser, both of them should be deemed as having lost. What right does a Guardian have to stand there without moving to be judged the winner?”

People were furious as they made condemnations about it, but it was useless.

The ranking battle continued. Everything was still under the control of the dimension.

People couldn’t help but feel sad. This was clearly the selection of the King of Earth, but Earth’s creatures didn’t even have the right to choose.

Zhou Wen and Wang Lu were also stunned by this shameless act. Wang Lu said angrily, “These fellows are bullying us.”

Zhou Wen snapped to his senses and said thankfully, “I’m already considered very lucky. Thankfully, they didn’t deem Grim Demon to have lost. Otherwise, the situation would only be worse.”

However, Zhou Wen had already thought about it. It was unlikely that both parties would be eliminated. That way, there would be no first place.

If the second place was replaced, it would still be Zhong Ziya. First place would still fall into the hands of outsiders.

However, this way, Zhou Wen’s plan of using Grim Demon to stall for the full 48 hours failed. All he could do was let Grim Demon continue accepting challenges.

“You want to fight? Then let’s fight.” Zhou Wen was still confident in Grim Demon’s strength.

Regardless, this fellow already had the strength of a Terror-grade. It shouldn’t be a problem for him to defeat ordinary Guardians.

As long as the challenger wasn’t a Guardian at Night Thearch’s level, Grim Demon’s victory was almost certain.

There were quite a number of Guardians challenging Grim Demon. Zhou Wen had previously learned about some of them. After seeing some of their battles and looking at the challenge list, he got Demonic Neonate to inform Grim Demon and accept one of the Guardians’ challenges.

“You have to win.” Zhou Wen finally got Demonic Neonate to inform Grim Demon.

Demonic Neonate only needed to inform Grim Demon with her mind. Grim Demon was overjoyed when he heard that, but he still muttered, “Why is there a need to select opponents? My strength is enough to suppress everything. No matter how many of those brats come, they will all die.”

However, despite saying that, Grim Demon still accepted a challenge from a Guardian named Darkness Emissary according to the instructions Demonic Neonate had sent.

Darkness Emissary had previously been interviewed by the Federation Freedom Investigation Bureau. It was a rather encouraging story.

A youth from a small city had entered a famous school with excellent results. After graduation, he took things one step at a time and became an excellent freelance hunter. Then, he obtained the favor of the heavens and unexpectedly encountered a Guardian cocoon. It also happened to match his hidden talent, allowing him to leap to the top of the Federation.

...

At that moment, Wei Ge held a teacup in one hand as he watched the livestream while flipping through the information beside him. The information was regarding Darkness Emissary.

After Wei Ge had graduated, he went through many twists and turns before finally entering the Special Investigation Bureau. He had started off as an ordinary inspector, but now, he was only a low-ranking archive administrator.

Although this was only the bureau’s ordinary archive room, the information Wei Ge could come into contact with was incomparable to the past.

He wasn’t in a rush. He insisted on combing through the files every day. Others weren’t willing to do such a boring job, but he enjoyed it. Now, Wei Ge knew the entire archives like the back of his hand.

The information regarding Darkness Emissary and Zhou Ming was also included. After he saw Darkness Emissary enter the arena, he pulled out his docket to take a look.

They both have the same surname, but why is there such a huge difference between them? Wei Ge couldn’t help but sigh after seeing Darkness Emissary’s information.

The information obtained by the bureau naturally wasn’t as simple as it looked. From the information, not only was Zhou Ming ruthless, but he also didn’t care about friendship.

His family background was indeed not good. He had a girlfriend in high school, and her family didn’t despise him. They even paid him to attend a famous school. In the end, after he made a comeback, he abandoned that girlfriend and found another beautiful one.

Wei Ge looked at his first girlfriend’s photo. She was indeed not beautiful. She could only be considered average and was a little plump. He guessed that Zhou Ming’s motives were probably not pure when he first got together with her.

Later, the girl’s parents went to reason with Zhou Ming and had even been injured by him. He really didn’t care about their past relationship.

Zhou Ming had done many such things in secret. He was a person who only wanted to climb up.

Wei Ge was reading when he suddenly heard the door to the archive room open and a person walk in.

Wei Ge was a very meticulous person. When he heard the gait, he felt that the person was somewhat different from those who often came to the archives. He hurriedly looked up and saw who it was. He immediately stood up and saluted. “Director-General, why are you here? If you need any files, just inform me. I’ll send them to you now.”

Shen Yuchi smiled. “There’s no need to be nervous. Let me take a look at Darkness Emissary’s file. Ah, it’s already here. So, you’re also interested. Not bad.”

As he spoke, Shen Yuchi took the file on the table and stood there to flip through it.

“I happened to see that Darkness Emissary is up next in the fight, so I took it out to take a look and tidy it up,” Wei Ge said.

Shen Yuchi nodded slightly and didn’t say anything. After reading a few pages, Shen Yuchi asked casually, “You are a top student at Sunset College. You should know Zhou Wen, right?”

Wei Ge immediately answered, “Yes, Director-General. Zhou Wen is my junior. When he entered the school, I was already the student council president.”

“Do you know much about him?” Shen Yuchi looked at the information and continued asking without looking up.

“I know a little. I originally wanted to pull him onto the student council, but he wasn’t interested,” Wei Ge said.
