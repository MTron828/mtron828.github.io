Chapter 1568: The Might of the Tiger Soul General

Translator: CKtalon

Flames burned over the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General as he charged at the Starlord Ravenous Wolves like an unbridled horse.

Everyone was taken aback. They originally imagined that Unlucky Egg merely wanted to pick up the spoils, but now, it clearly wasn’t time.

What is he doing? Does he really want to help me by getting the Companion Beast to rush forward at this moment??Jiuyang was somewhat puzzled. He didn’t know what the other party was thinking. He highly doubted that he would really help him.

However, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General had already charged forward. As Jiuyang was momentarily at a loss as to what Zhou Wen meant, he failed to immediately work in tandem with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

The two Starlord Ravenous Wolves attacked the Tiger Soul General from both sides. Their fists carried terrifying high temperatures and radiation, as well as powerful explosive power.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was attacked from both sides. It looked like it couldn’t deal with the attacks.

In fact, the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General couldn’t be bothered with the attacks. He ignored the Starlord Ravenous Wolf on the left. The spear in his hand carried a violent purple flame as it struck at Starlord Ravenous Wolf on the right.

This attack risked one’s life. There was no technique to speak of. It depended on who was faster and stronger.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was clearly a little slower. The Starlord Ravenous Wolves were a little faster and were relatively more agile. The fists of the one on the left struck it.

The Starlord Ravenous Wolf on the right dodged the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s spear. After getting close, his fist also struck it.

Four punches struck the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General’s body simultaneously. Immediately, blinding light and a shockwave that resembled a supernova erupted.

Even Zhou Wen and Jiuyang found the light blinding. They could hardly see anything as the shockwave sent their bodies retreating.

The humans watching the Cube’s live broadcast found it even harder to see what was happening. The screen was filled with blinding light.

From the looks of it, that Companion Beast is doomed. To be struck by two Starlord Ravenous Wolves at the same time, even Jiuyang can’t withstand such destructive power, right?

Most people had such thoughts. Such a terrifying attack was probably unbearable even for a Calamity-grade Companion Beast, much less a Terror-grade Companion Beast.

When the dazzling light gradually weakened, everyone immediately widened their eyes. They saw the Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ fists strike the Tiger Soul General from both sides. However, the Tiger Soul General remained standing proudly. The armor on his body wasn’t shattered by their strikes. Instead, the flames in his body looked even more turbulent. The beautiful patterns on his armor became even more dazzling.

Boom!

The Tiger Soul General waved the spear in his hand and swept it from left to right. The Starlord Ravenous Wolf on the right reached out to grab the spear, but the moment his palm touched it, he immediately felt a huge force repel him as his body involuntarily flew backward and slammed into the Starlord Ravenous Wolf on the left.

The two Starlord Ravenous Wolves immediately collided and tumbled out together.

The Tiger Soul General charged forward on his mount. The spear in his hand danced like a dragon as he charged at the two Starlord Ravenous Wolves.

Everyone was already stunned. The Tiger Soul General was fighting two alone, but it continued charging forward. The Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ attacks only sent the Tiger Soul General retreating, but their armors would crack whenever the Tiger Soul General struck them.

The Tiger Soul General hardly dodged the Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ attacks. Relying on its powerful physique and defense, it sent the two Starlord Ravenous Wolves into a retreating defeat.

“This cannot be happening, right? That Companion Beast can actually ignore the Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ attacks?”

“This is crazy!”

“What Companion Beast is that? It’s ridiculously strong. Humans actually have such powerful Companion Beasts?”

“Holy sh*t, who is this Unlucky Egg? His Companion Beast is too amazing!”

The Tiger Soul General charged at the Starlord Ravenous Wolves like a ferocious general fighting a mere foot soldier. The two Starlords could only constantly dodge. It was difficult for them to fight it head-on.

Jiuyang watched in a daze as the Tiger Soul General fought the Starlord Ravenous Wolves. This situation completely exceeded his expectations. He was momentarily unsure if he should continue fighting.

After some hesitation, Jiuyang gave up on the idea of charging forward to fight. If he were to fight now, it would be him taking advantage of Zhou Wen. Jiuyang clearly felt that it was beneath him to do such a thing.

Who is he??Jiuyang stared at the Chaos Egg as his eyes emitted a sun-like glow. He wanted to see who was inside, but he couldn’t see anything.

Even if his eyes could see through things, it was impossible for him to see through the Chaos Egg.

The Tiger Soul General was like a devil general from hell as it constantly charged forward. The Starlord Ravenous Wolves, who had been arrogant and unbridled, appeared to be on the brink of collapse under the Tiger Soul General’s onslaught. It was like a battle between a child and an adult. They could hardly put up a defense.

Even Zhou Wen never expected the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General to be that ferocious. He was clearly at the Human Realm, while the Starlord Ravenous Wolves were likely at the Hell level.

Ignoring the difference in level, it was truly terrifying for it to completely suppress two Starlord Ravenous Wolves in a one-on-two situation.

Zhou Wen knew very well that the reason the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was so strong was partly that of the environment in Dubhe Palace. Also, the Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ abilities were high temperature in nature, so they were actually restrained by the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General became stronger the more it fought. In the beginning, the Starlord Ravenous Wolves’ attacks could still push it back a distance. Later on, they could hardly push him back by more than two steps.

Crack!

The Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General was like a ferocious tiger out in the wild. With the violent flames, he penetrated a Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s chest and nailed him to the ground.

The other Starlord Ravenous Wolf brandished his fists crazily from behind and punched the back of the Tiger Soul General’s head again and again. However, the violent attacks failed to even crack the Tiger Soul General’s helmet.

The Tiger Soul General swung his hand backward and grabbed the Starlord Ravenous Wolf by the neck and lifted him in front of him.

Starlord Ravenous Wolf used his hands and feet to attack the Tiger Soul General with all his might. However, the Tiger Soul General seemed oblivious to his explosive strength. With a sudden squeeze of his palm, he snapped Starlord Ravenous Wolf’s neck.

A head fell from the neck and the body lost its vitality as its limbs went limp.

The Starlord Ravenous Wolf, who had been nailed to the ground, struggled to get up, but he was held down by the spear.

The Tiger Soul General glanced at him and flicked the spear in his hand, lifting the Starlord Ravenous Wolf and sending him flying. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

While Starlord Ravenous Wolf was still in midair, the spearhead of the Tiger Soul General’s spear shot out tracers like a Gatling’s barrel.

The shooting-star-like tracers constantly struck Starlord Ravenous Wolf in the air.. This continued for dozens of seconds before his body exploded.
