Chapter 523 Flying Immortal Stance

After returning to school, Zhou Wen heard the students discussing the Companion Beasts on the rankings. Ordinary students suspected that they were Mythical Companion Beasts, but no one had ever seen one.

Zhou Wen also went online to take a look. Many media outlets and individuals had captured the pictures of the Companion Beasts on the cube.

Death of the Underworld looked very strange. He was wearing a gray cloak. Black and blue light filled its insides. He did not have a physical body and looked a little like the legendary Death. However, he did not have a scythe in his hands.

Frost Giant was a giant with a deep blue body. Wherever he went, ice would form on the ground.

The other Companion Beasts were also unique. Angels were holy, sprites were beautiful, and dragons looked about the same. However, for a Companion Beast to be ranked, one could tell that they were extraordinary just from their aura alone.

Unfortunately, only the images of the Companion Beasts were shown on the cube. Their skills weren‚Äôt listed.

Zhou Wen didn‚Äôt know what the ranking was for, but he quickly lost interest. He picked up his phone and continued grinding Torch Dragon. After his battle with Torch Dragon, Zhou Wen gradually started to use his speed and crystal mirror to block Torch Dragon‚Äôs Bright Torch Vision World.

Unfortunately, a Sun Beast Companion Egg was a rare drop. If there were two or more crystal mirrors, the success rate of killing Torch Dragon would be much higher.

Zhou Wen thought of many solutions. For example, using a large number of Companion Beasts to shield him, but it was useless. The blood-colored avatar and all the Companion Beasts in front of him were reflected into the vision world.

Apart from the crystal mirror that could reflect, the other Companion Beasts weren‚Äôt of much use.

As for using the crystal mirror to block Torch Dragon‚Äôs gaze, he needed to grasp the timing and position perfectly, or it would be very difficult to block.

The problem was that Torch Dragon‚Äôs Bright Torch Vision World wasn‚Äôt a skill that could only be used once. Therefore, Zhou Wen needed to defend against it many times in battle. Otherwise, he would die.

As for Demonic Neonate that remained on the blood-colored avatar‚Äôs back, she constantly tried to find Torch Dragon‚Äôs flaws to attack it. There were a few times when she really found an opportunity. The ancient sword stabbed at Torch Dragon, but it only managed to penetrate a tiny length of the blade. It did not pose much of a threat to Torch Dragon.

As for the blood-colored avatar, it couldn‚Äôt survive until Demonic Neonate killed Torch Dragon.

According to Zhou Wen‚Äôs calculations, he needed to survive at least three hours in front of Torch Dragon before Demonic Neonate could kill it.

This was the best situation. If the situation didn‚Äôt go as smoothly as Zhou Wen expected, it might take even longer.

Zhou Wen‚Äôs most pressing problem was to 100% block the Bright Torch Vision World for those few hours. Just one mistake meant immediate death. All his efforts would be in vain.

After a bitter battle for an hour, the blood-colored avatar was once again killed by Torch Dragon‚Äôs Bright Torch Vision World. This was the longest time Zhou Wen had lasted.

I can‚Äôt make any mistakes, and I have to be absolutely precise. In a high-intensity battle, I have to ensure that I can throw out the crystal mirror with perfect timing and positioning while facing a powerful creature like Torch Dragon. Furthermore, it‚Äôs really difficult to judge Torch Dragon‚Äôs actions accurately.

Zhou Wen thought about it and realized that it was very difficult for him to boost his success rate. After all, the other party was a Mythical creature stronger than him. It wasn‚Äôt that easy to determine its actions and motions.

Since it‚Äôs very difficult to improve my judgment, I can only increase my speed and ability to adjust my position. I‚Äôll try my best to prevent Torch Dragon from seeing me.

Therefore, in the following battles, Zhou Wen consciously fused Dragon Gate Flying Immortal Skill and Transcendent Flying Immortal into the fairy stance he had comprehended, hoping to improve his movement technique to another level.

This wasn‚Äôt an easy task. Zhou Wen felt that there was a barrier between the fairy‚Äôs stances and his movement techniques. It was very difficult to achieve perfection, and there would be problems when fusing them.

Zhou Wen wasn‚Äôt someone who would give up in the face of adversity. He continued researching and improving, especially the beautiful fairy‚Äôs stance. Zhou Wen spent a great deal of time comprehending and researching. Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

At the bureau‚Äôs headquarters, there was a lot of information placed in front of Shen Yuchi. It was all about the black cubes and the Companion Beasts on the ranking.

"Director-General, other than the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon, the origins of the other Companion Beasts are almost confirmed," Qiao Siyuan said.

Shen Yuchi nodded slightly. "Why did those families in the West and North District put their Mythical pets on the rankings? Have you investigated?"

In fact, Shen Yuchi didn‚Äôt need to investigate to know which families these Companion Beasts came from. The key was why they wanted to expose their Mythical Companion Beasts to the public.

Before this, every family clan hid their Mythical Companion Beasts, afraid that others would know how many they had. But this time, they actually revealed a portion of them.

Although a number were already known to outsiders, it still felt puzzling.

"According to our investigations, those few families seem to have figured out some of the secrets of the black cube. They know that there would be benefits if they were to be ranked, which is why they made such a move. However, this information has not been verified yet, so we don‚Äôt know of its veracity," Qiao Siyuan answered very conservatively.

"What kind of benefits?" Shen Yuchi knew what Qiao Siyuan was getting at. This news should have come from within those few families, but he couldn‚Äôt guarantee that they were using it as a smokescreen.

"From what they say, the Companion Beasts on the ranking might be fancied by terrifying existences in the dimensional zones. There might be benefits, but they aren‚Äôt sure if the news is real or not, nor do they know what benefits there will be." Qiao Siyuan explained the information he gathered in detail.

After Shen Yuchi heard that, he remained silent.

"Director-General, what should we do?" Qiao Siyuan asked.

"The Zhang family, the Xia family, and the Dugu family didn‚Äôt make a move. The West and North Districts only sent some Companion Beasts as a test. It‚Äôs not time for us to step forward. Let‚Äôs just wait and see for now."

After a pause, Shen Yuchi asked again, "How‚Äôs the progress of Wang Mingyuan‚Äôs students?"

"It‚Äôs not going well. Zhou Wen and Hui Haifeng are protected by their families, so it‚Äôs very difficult to bring them back. Jiang Yan and Zhong Ziya‚Äôs whereabouts are unknown. We‚Äôve been tracking them for so long, but we haven‚Äôt been able to catch them. None of Wang Mingyuan‚Äôs four students are simple. I think Wang Mingyuan might have other motives for taking them in as his students. It‚Äôs not just a coincidence."

Qiao Siyuan paused and said, "Besides, the six families aren‚Äôt too concerned about this matter now. For some reason, even the Cape family that wanted to capture Zhou Wen the most seem to have forgotten about it. They‚Äôre all focused on the rankings."

"That‚Äôs strange." Shen Yuchi pondered over the cause and effect of everything.
