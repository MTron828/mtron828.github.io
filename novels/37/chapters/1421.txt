Chapter 1422: Possibility of Six Stars

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen ignored the Metal Guard’s attacks and walked towards the tunnel’s door.

The Metal Guard’s bullets swept across Zhou Wen’s body, but they were blocked by the Prisoned Dragon armor, not even leaving a mark. Instead, the bullets ricocheted from the Prisoned Dragon armor and shattered the Metal Guard’s energy source.

The Metal Guard wasn’t afraid of the bullets, so it was useless even if the bullets riddled its body with holes. However, once the energy source exploded, the Metal Guard was dead.

The six doors opened as hordes of Metal Guards rushed out. Bullets fired at Zhou Wen crazily, but all of them ricocheted from the Prisoned Dragon armor. They all had their energy sources blasted apart.

Zhou Wen didn’t attack. He only relied on the ricocheting to finish off the Metal Guards.

Zhou Wen wasn’t as extravagant as the others. He stored the dimensional crystals and Companion Eggs that the Metal Guards dropped, regardless of whether they were good or bad.

After all, he usually grinded in-game, and he couldn’t take out the things he obtained in-game. If there was a chance to pick up something, he wouldn’t miss it.

“Look at Human Sovereign. He’s already such an invincible powerhouse, yet he’s still so diligent and thrifty. He’s really a perfect man. He will definitely be a good husband in the future. I really want to marry him,” a girl said dreamily as her eyes suffused hearts. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Cut it out. What thrifty? You just want his body…” the girl beside her curled her lips.

The Golden Battle God appeared and fired, but Zhou Wen still didn’t dodge. He secretly circulated his strength and used the Prisoned Dragon armor’s reflective force to increase the bullet’s strength, causing the bullet to fly back even faster and blast apart the Golden Battle God’s energy source.

“Holy sh*t, that works? Even a Terror-grade Golden Battle God can be ricocheted to death. What armor is that?”

“This reflective ability seems to be even more domineering than the Calamity-grade Dragon Turtle from before!”

“As expected of Human Sovereign. He’s too domineering.”

“It’s just this and nothing more. He’s only relying on the Companion Beast armor. Look at how Tsukuyomi and Xiao obtained six stars. They didn’t use any of these ricocheting parlor tricks. It’s all useless.”

…

The six Golden Battle Gods were ricocheted to death one by one, but it wasn’t all thanks to the Prisoned Dragon armor. The force Zhou Wen secretly used was also key. Otherwise, just the ricocheting bullets wouldn’t deliver such a strong effect.

The alarms on the six doors sounded at the same time. Everyone immediately focused as they stared intently at Zhou Wen’s figure, hoping to see how he would deal with the Calamity-grade bullets. This was the true crux.

“When Xiao cleared the level, the Calamity-grade gunner didn’t fire. The Calamity-grade gunman didn’t fire for Tsukuyomi either. Only they obtained six stars. The other strong ones like The Fallen failed to obtain six stars. It’s obvious that the key is to prevent the Calamity-grade gunner from firing. If Human Sovereign were to let the Calamity-grade gunman fire a shot, I’m afraid he wouldn’t have a chance to obtain six stars,” Xia Liuchuan analyzed.

“But from the looks of it, Human Sovereign shouldn’t have such an ability. His ability is more reflected in his combat strength. He doesn’t have the ability to make his opponent commit suicide, nor does he have Tsukuyomi’s Ghost Parade ability. It’s probably very difficult to make the Calamity-grade gunner not shoot, right?” Xia Xuanyue said.

“It’s very difficult, but it has to be done. It’s not that easy to obtain six stars,” Xia Liuchuan said.

In fact, there were many people with the same thoughts as Xia Liuchuan. After watching so many attempts, most people had a certain understanding of how the Venusian dimensional zone scored the attempt. How the Calamity-grade gunner was dealt with was key.

From the looks of it, preventing the Calamity-grade gunner from firing was the most effective way to get a high score. There likely wasn’t a better way of obtaining six stars.

Bang!

Just as people were discussing if Human Sovereign could scare the Calamity-grade gunner into not firing, a gunshot sounded.

Almost at the same time the gunshot sounded, the Immortal Culling Sword in Zhou Wen’s hand moved, but it didn’t leave its scabbard. All he did was use the hilt of his sword to block the Calamity-grade bullet and change the direction of the bullet.

After the Calamity-grade bullet changed direction and shot elsewhere, Zhou Wen walked over to the tunnel and ventured inside.

Bullets shot over one after another, but Zhou Wen’s arm only moved slightly as he struck the bullets with the hilt. It looked like he was easily changing the direction of the bullets, preventing any of them from hitting him.

It looked easy, but in fact, it wasn’t that easy.

To do so, not only did he need to have good eyesight and timing, but he also needed to have sufficient strength and top-notch control over his force. Under the impact of the light-speed bullet, he would ingeniously strike the side of the bullet from a certain angle. By exerting a tiny bit of strength, he could change the direction of the bullet.

“As expected of Human Sovereign. His eyesight, force control, and timing are all top-notch. From the looks of it, he likely hasn’t advanced to the Calamity grade. I’m afraid there aren’t many humans other than Human Sovereign that can accomplish such a feat with Terror-grade strength.” Zhang Chunqiu sighed softly and continued, “Unfortunately, no matter how good his technique is, as long as that Calamity-grade gunner fires, it will be difficult to get a rating of six stars.”

“Is there no other way?” Zhang Yuzhi still hoped that Human Sovereign could obtain first place.

“Not at the moment.” Zhang Chunqiu sighed.

“There shouldn’t be any suspense. Although Human Sovereign is very strong, he hasn’t advanced to the Calamity grade after all. Without the effects of a domain, he can’t stop the Calamity-grade gunner from firing. It’s impossible for him to reach six stars. If there aren’t any other stronger creatures attempting the level, Xiao should end up in first place,” Professor Gu explained in the program.

“Professor Gu, since a powerhouse like Human Sovereign has stood up to the challenge, he definitely has his own ideas. Could he have other tricks up his sleeve?” The host was a fan of Human Sovereign, so she still held onto a sliver of hope.

“There’s always a limit to human strength. It can’t be done if it just can’t be done. No matter how strange a move is, it has to be within a certain set of rules. The Calamity-grade gunner has already fired. The rules governing the Cube’s ratings make it impossible for him to obtain six stars. It’s useless no matter what move he has. Now, Human Sovereign can only vie for third place. If he can surpass The Fallen and obtain third place, he should be able to obtain a good Companion Beast. This isn’t a bad choice. The reason Human Sovereign is here this time is likely to vie for third place. As a Terror-grade, it’s already very impressive to be able to come in at third place. Human Sovereign hasn’t shamed our human pride,” Professor Gu answered with certainty.

“What a pity. Even he can’t shake Xiao’s position,” Cave Era said in disappointment as she looked at the Cube’s screen.

“He’s not someone who does things randomly without confidence,” Jiang Yan said indifferently.

In the room, Zhong Ziya, who was hugging his sword and looking a little dazed from drinking, leaned on the sofa. After hearing Professor Gu’s explanation, the corners of his mouth involuntarily curled up as he muttered to himself, “That fellow doesn’t like something like third place.”

Bang!

The seventh gunshot rang.
