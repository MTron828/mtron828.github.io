Chapter 875: Snatching the Treasure from the Pill Furnace

Translator: CKtalon

The huge underground space had already become a world of wind and fire.

Zhou Wen didn’t pay attention to the battle between the stone sword and the elder. His attention was focused on the pill furnace.

No matter how one looked at it, the terrifying wind was prepared for the pill furnace. The pill furnace borrowed the wind’s might to fan the flames in the furnace such that it became extremely hot.

Could this pill furnace really be refining the Pill of Immortality? Zhou Wen suspected as he used Truth Listener to observe the situation inside the pill furnace.

However, because the wind and fire inside were too violent, he couldn’t hear much information.

Just as Zhou Wen was observing the pill furnace, a beam of light suddenly lit up inside. Even in the surging furnace flames, the beam of light was still very obvious.

“Is it finally coming out? I’ve waited so long for this day.” The elder was immediately excited when he saw the light in the furnace.

His body emitted a jade glow as he forced the stone sword to retreat. He flew towards the pill furnace and grabbed the lid with one hand, wanting to open it.

However, the stone sword refused to be outdone. It flew up again and slashed at the elder’s arm, forcing him to release the lid. Due to the pressure from the stone sword, the elder failed to open the lid several times.

“You’ve fought with me for so many years, but you still aren’t willing to give up?” The elder was furious. He suddenly retreated and temporarily broke away from the stone sword. The jade light on his body condensed on his right hand, causing his jade-like right hand to become even more crystalline.

The stone sword seemed to sense the danger as well. It no longer charged forward blindly. The stone sword also began to condense its strength as runes appeared on the stone’s blade.

The runes carried a strange power. The appearance of each rune made the sword seem heavier.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that the runes that appeared on the stone sword was a law.

“Defiance of a superior... shall result in execution...”

With the appearance of the law, the stone sword seemed to possess unparalleled power as it slashed at the elder with a suppressive might.

The elder’s crystal-like right hand extended out almost at the same time.

The moment he extended his right hand, time and space seemed to condense. It was as though only his hand was moving. Everything else stopped.

The stone sword was actually sent flying by the elder’s right hand. The law on the sword was also destroyed.

Although the stone sword wasn’t injured, it couldn’t help but fly into the vortex of flames. It was unknown how it was doing.

After the elder sent the stone sword flying, he immediately rushed towards the pill furnace. Without the stone sword’s obstruction, he lifted the heavy lid with one hand and extended his other hand to grab the resplendent item inside.

Just as the elder was about to grab the item inside the furnace, a white light suddenly shone out from the furnace.

The elder was caught off guard and was hit by the white light. He immediately screamed and fell.

The resplendent light in the furnace resembled a sun as it rose from the pill furnace. After leaving the pill furnace, the item’s light slowly dimmed. Only then did Zhou Wen see that it was Jing Daoxian’s Yin Yang Mirror.

Jing Daoxian also jumped out of the furnace and stood on it. He held the Yin Yang Mirror and smiled at the elder.

“Who are you? How dare you scheme against a king like me?” The elder struggled to stand up, but when Jing Daoxian waved the Yin Yang Mirror in his hand, the elder lost control of his body like a puppet. He fell off the mountain, falling into the flames.

“You are a mere alchemist. Do you think you are worthy of being called a king?” Jing Daoxian said disdainfully.

“Boss Jing, you are still the best. That old man looks rather powerful. I never expected him to be unable to withstand a single strike from you,” Liu Yun flattered.

Jing Daoxian said, “Not really. I only took the opportunity to launch a sneak attack. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be his match either. Although he’s only an alchemist, he has fused with the Guardian of the Founding Emperor Tomb. After so many years, he has already evolved to the Terror grade. Few humans are his match now.”

Seeing Jing Daoxian admit that he wasn’t the elder’s match and that he had relied on a sneak attack to gain the upper hand, Zhou Wen and Liu Yun’s fear of him deepened.

The elder’s body was truly terrifying. He rushed out of the vortex of flames and angrily wanted to kill Jing Daoxian.

However, he had already been injured by the Yin Yang Mirror. The Yin Yang Mirror had already locked onto his soul. With just a turn of the Yin Yang Mirror, the elder’s body flew out again.

The stone sword had originally treated the elder as its mortal enemy, but it didn’t take the opportunity to kill him. Instead, it charged at Jing Daoxian.

Jing Daoxian raised the Yin Yang Mirror to fight the stone sword. The elder charged back as well, but unfortunately, he was controlled by the Yin Yang Mirror and involuntarily slammed into the stone sword’s sword beam.

As such, it became a battle between the elder and the stone sword again.

However, the elder had willingly fought the stone sword previously, while this time, he was being controlled by Jing Daoxian.

“What’s going on? Just now, the stone sword wished to slay the elder. Why is it dodging all the time when there’s now a chance?” Liu Yun was puzzled.

Zhou Wen said, “If I’m not wrong, the stone sword should have the power of a law. It’s the true existence that guards this place. Previously, the stone sword didn’t do its best to stop Jing Daoxian because it probably believes that Jing Daoxian can’t obtain the item in the pill furnace, and that old man was the real threat. That’s why it continued guarding the palace.”

“But now, the stone sword has realized that Jing Daoxian is a greater threat than that elder. And it can’t deal with Jing Daoxian by itself. It can’t stop Jing Daoxian from taking the thing inside the pill furnace. That’s why it doesn’t kill the elder. It hopes that the elder can escape Jing Daoxian’s control and form a tripartite situation,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

Liu Yun’s eyes lit up as he lowered his voice and used a mystic technique to transmit his voice, allowing Zhou Wen to hear him. “Now that they are restraining each other, do you and I have a chance to snatch the item in the pill furnace?”

At that moment, another blob of light lit up in the furnace. It was different from the light that Jing Daoxian had faked with the Yin Yang Mirror. It was as warm as jade, but it gave off a refreshing feeling in the scorching furnace.

“The wind and fire outside the pill furnace are already so powerful. The flames inside the pill furnace are even more terrifying. I’m afraid even Mythical armor can’t withstand it. If we enter, we will be reduced to ashes. How can we take the thing inside?” Zhou Wen said.

“My Star Stealer is unparalleled. What can’t I get?” Liu Yun didn’t believe that he couldn’t get what was inside the pill furnace. “Why don’t we join forces? I’ll be responsible for stealing the things inside the pill furnace. You can use your teleportation ability and the Earth Escape to help me escape. After we leave, we’ll split the items equally.”

Zhou Wen looked at Jing Daoxian, who was engaged in an intense battle with the stone sword and the elder. Seeing no reaction from him, as though he hadn’t heard their conversation, he nodded and said, “Okay.”
