Chapter 1255: Greenhouse

Translator: CKtalon

Everyone was stunned when they heard that. Many of them were like the elder who had known Lucas for many years. They also knew him very well.

Lucas was an extremely narcissistic person. In his eyes, he was the only hero who could save the world. Although he wasn’t someone difficult to get along with, it wasn’t easy to hear praises of another person from Lucas.

What Philo said didn’t sound like it came from Lucas.

“Lucas said that he’s a godlike person?” The elder looked at Zhou Wen with an odd expression. He really didn’t believe that the great Lucas would praise others like that.

Philo ignored the elder and said excitedly to Zhou Wen, “You’re here to save Lucas, right? It’s great that you came.”

.

“Er, is the reason for going to the Time Hut that you discovered something?” Zhou Wen was somewhat embarrassed. He realized that he couldn’t be called a competent friend. He actually knew nothing about what had happened to Lucas.

Philo shook her head and said, “Lucas said that he’s the greatest hero, so he had to contract the strongest Guardian. And the most terrifying dimensional zone on the Peninsula of Gods is the Time Hut. He heard from somewhere that there’s a Guardian in there, so he decided to head there to contract it.”

“He never returned. In the past few years, I’ve tried my best to organize people to go to the Time Hut to find him, but my abilities are limited after all. There aren’t many people I can find. I went a few times, but nothing came of it. I had to find stronger people. But how many people do I know? I just thought that after so many years, Lucas’s chances of survival weren’t high. I couldn’t find any powerful experts to save him, so I thought I might as well go in myself. It’s best if I can see him. If I can’t, I’ll just pass on with him.”

After Philo roughly explained the situation, Zhou Wen realized that she had already made up her mind to die. If the elder hadn’t brought her back, she would probably have died in the Time Hut.

“Great, even Lucas said that you are a godlike person. You can definitely save him, right?” Philo looked at Zhou Wen with anticipation.

“I’ll do my best to rescue Lucas,” Zhou Wen said, but he knew that Lucas was probably dead.

Four years was just too long. If Lucas had really encountered danger in the Time Hut, he would have died long ago.

Philo naturally understood this as well, but she still held onto a glimmer of hope. She had relied on this hope to survive for the past few years.

“Let’s go. Let’s not waste any more time,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to continue.

“Philo, let’s make the trip together,” the elder said after some hesitation.

Although Lucas said that Zhou Wen was his friend, who could guarantee that this young man was really the Zhou Wen that Lucas had mentioned? After all, Zhou Wen looked too young. No matter how one looked at it, he didn’t seem like the mighty godlike person Lucas had mentioned.

Although he wasn’t willing to risk the lives of his own people, he also didn’t wish to see Philo deceived.

“You wish to go now?” Philo looked at the elder in surprise.

“We’ll take you to the Piranha Flower King. If you can’t pass, we can bring you back. If you can pass, there’s still a distance to the Time Hut, so it will be faster if someone leads the way,” the elder said.

Philo nodded and didn’t refuse the offer.

The group set off again. The elder led the way and soon arrived at the place they had mentioned.

It was a canyon between two mountains. The originally wide canyon was now blocked by a flower.

The petals of the flower seemed to be carved from ice. They were crystalline and shimmering under the sunlight.

It’s no wonder the elder calls it a Piranha Flower King. This flower is indeed huge. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it’s the king of flowers.?Zhou Wen sized up the flower and asked the elder beside him, “How does this Piranha Flower eat humans?”

The elder said, “In the past, there was nothing in this canyon. This huge flower suddenly appeared recently. I sent someone to use a Companion Beast to scout the way. I originally wanted to see if the Piranha Flower King would injure anyone, but I never expected…”

The elder recounted what had happened. They couldn’t help but feel sad.

“You didn’t see how those people vanished?” Ice Maiden suddenly asked after the elder finished speaking.

“No. After the Companion Beast awoke the Piranha Flower King, the companions closest to it disappeared one after another. We had no choice but to retreat with Philo,” the elder said.

Ice Maiden continued asking, “When they disappear, which disappears first—their heads or bodies?”

“Is there a difference?” the young man asked in puzzlement.

“Of course there’s a difference.” Ice Maiden had no intention of explaining. She continued looking at the elder.

The elder thought for a moment and looked at his companions beside him. He said with uncertainty, “I vaguely remember the heads disappearing first. However, I only saw one of my companions being devoured. I didn’t see the others.”

“It was the head first; no mistake about it. I saw it too. Their heads vanished, but their bodies seemed to be pulled into the air by something. Soon, even their bodies vanished,” a middle-aged man said.

Those who saw it said that the head was the first to disappear.

After Ice Maiden heard that, she revealed a thoughtful expression.

“Do you know the origins of this flower?” Zhou Wen asked Ice Maiden.

Ice Maiden nodded slightly. “If I’m not wrong, this flower isn’t the Piranha Flower King, but the greenhouse of the Flower race.”

“Greenhouse?” Zhou Wen looked at the flower. No matter how he looked at it, it was a living flower and not a building that had been built into the shape of a flower. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“A greenhouse is a place for the Flower race to reside. It’s similar to my ice castle. The true Flower race member is inside the flower. However, the Flower race seldom interacts with the outside world. I haven’t seen many members of the Flower race, but I’m basically certain that this is from the Flower race.” Ice Maiden paused before saying, “It’s clearly a problem for the Flower race to suddenly arrive on Earth at this time. Perhaps it has something to do with the Venusian dimensional zone.”

“If that’s really the Flower race, he should be able to see us, right?” Zhou Wen asked the flower.

“It’s definitely possible under normal circumstances. However, typically speaking, the Flower race shouldn’t appear in such a place. After this Flower race came to Earth, they clearly encountered some problems. Perhaps they were injured,” Ice Maiden said after some thought.

“It’s good that they’re injured.” Zhou Wen looked at the huge greenhouse and was already considering how to capture the Flower race member inside.

“You mean that the flower isn’t a creature from Earth but a creature from the dimension?” The elder finally understood after listening for a while. His expression changed drastically.

Although Human Sovereign’s slaying of Di Tian had proven humanity’s strength, creatures from the dimension were still godlike existences to ordinary people.
