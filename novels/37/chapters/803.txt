However, when Zhou Wen asked her again, she only nodded and shook her head without saying another word.

Could it be that she only knows one word? Although Zhou Wen felt that it was unlikely and there was no reason for her to only say one word, there was nothing he could do if Ya’er didn’t wish to speak.

Ya’er suddenly stood up and walked out. However, after taking two steps, her legs went limp and she fell to the ground. From the looks of it, her body’s strength was about the same as an ordinary toddler’s.

Ya’er frowned slightly as her eyes narrowed, causing her body to levitate.

How strange. Her mental strength is still as strong as before. It’s at the Mythical level, but her body is as weak as a baby. Zhou Wen found it odd.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something to her, he saw her fly out the window and head for the Xiao family.

Zhou Wen was afraid that something would happen, so he put on the Invisibility Cloak and followed.

Inside the Xiao family, Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi were preparing to tame the Ice Silkworms. They couldn’t wait to tame them successfully.

“What a treasure. A powerful Gu like the Ice Silkworm Gu King is actually trapped inside without the ability to rush out. It’s much easier for us to tame them,” Xiao Liuqi said as he looked at the Ice Silkworms inside.

Xiao Tianfang was also observing the two Ice Silkworms. The two Ice Silkworms seemed to be tired from crawling around inside. They were motionless inside, probably resting.

Xiao Liuqi took out a Gu and tied it to a rope before throwing it into the Essence Gold Pot. This was food that Ice Silkworms liked to eat. He had to use this method to entice the Ice Silkworms, but he wouldn’t let them eat it. Then, he would gradually train them.

Xiao Liuqi placed the Gu inside and was about to pull the Gu out when the Ice Silkworm took action. However, to his surprise, an Ice Silkworm swallowed the Gu. Its speed was shockingly fast, giving him no time to pull out the Gu.

“The Ice Silkworms are too fast. I doubt it will be easy taming them.” Xiao Liuqi was just about to pull out the rope and get another Gu when the Ice Silkworm inside the pot phased away suddenly, appearing on the edge of the pot.

Alarmed, Xiao Liuqi and Xiao Tianfang quickly retreated.

“How did that happen?” Xiao Tianfang was alarmed. He felt that something was amiss.

Before Xiao Liuqi could say anything, another Ice Silkworm crawled out as though the Essence Gold Pot had lost its effect.

The two of them ran out without any hesitation. After they left the secret chamber, they were stunned by the scene in front of them.

In the huge temple, there were all sorts of Gu crawling everywhere. The Xiao family members were fighting with their Gu. What was even more terrifying was that the Gu they had domesticated now betrayed their masters and attacked them. There were screams and blood splattering everywhere.

“How did this happen? What happened?” Xiao Tianfang’s eyes turned red. The entire temple seemed to have turned into hell.

“There’s a problem. There must be a problem. It must be that Zhou guy. He didn’t want to give us the Ice Silkworms at all...” Xiao Liuqi felt despair. The Xiao family already had many Gu. Now, all of them had betrayed them. Even the Mythical-level Blood Scorpion Gu had rushed out and was engaging in wanton slaughter.

There were also a few Mythical Gu they had previously captured that were doing the same.

Any one of them was already very difficult to deal with, much less with so many Gu. It was already impossible for them to rush out of the temple.

“Zhou, even if I become a ghost after death, I won’t let you off,” Xiao Tianfang shouted in grief and indignation.

In the sky, a figure slowly descended. Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi looked over and realized that it was a one-year-old girl.

However, the girl’s face didn’t have the innocence and cuteness a child should have. She was completely expressionless other than her cold expression. She floated in the air and looked down coldly at Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The surrounding Gu killed wantonly, but no Gu attacked Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi.

Xiao Tianfang carefully sized up Ya’er and suddenly pointed at her as he shouted in horror, “Gu Lady... You’re Gu Lady... How is this possible...”

After all, he had once been connected to Ya’er at an intrinsic level. He was all too familiar with her aura. Although the Intrinsic Lock had been removed, he could still sense the unique aura from Ya’er.

“How can she be Gu Lady? That’s impossible, right?” Xiao Liuqi naturally didn’t believe that the girl in front of him was Gu Lady.

Kuman Nee couldn’t be revived. The little girl in front of them was clearly a living person.

“Liuqi, are you silly? Apart from Gu Lady, who else can control so many Gu? Who can make all our Gu betray us? Also, the aura from her is definitely Gu Lady...” Xiao Tianfang said in horror.

At that moment, the two Ice Silkworms crawled out as transparent wings grew from their backs. They flew to the side of Gu Lady as though they were protecting her.

Xiao Tianfang suddenly seemed to understand something as his body trembled. He gritted his teeth and said, “I get it. I get it now. So that Zhou fellow isn’t capable at all. The treasure pot and the ease at subduing the Ice Silkworms were all fake. Gu Lady was able to subdue the Ice Silkworms. She was the one controlling the Ice Silkworms... We actually didn’t realize that her strength had already reached such a level...”

Xiao Liuqi was also horrified. His face was filled with despair. “It’s over, Tianfang. We’re doomed this time... We shouldn’t have targeted her back then... Now, she’s here for revenge...”

Everyone in the Xiao family was dead. Gu swarmed over like a tidal wave, surrounding the two of them in the middle. The entire temple was drowned by Gu, leaving only the spot where they stood without any Gu.

“You... deserve death...” With her voice, the tidal-like Gu rushed towards them.

The Xiao brothers fought with all their might, but they were quickly drowned by Gu. Countless Gu drilled into their bodies and tore at their organs and flesh.

Amidst the inhuman screams, the Xiao brothers were eaten until there was nothing left.

Zhou Wen remained in midair and couldn’t help but frown when he saw the Xiao family’s tragic state. He was also somewhat worried.

It was understandable that Ya’er wanted revenge, but it was indeed a little too ruthless to kill everyone without any discrimination. It wasn’t necessarily true that everyone in the Xiao family was bad, and not everyone had done evil.

Zhou Wen didn’t pity the Xiao family, but he was afraid of Ya’er’s character. If he kept her by his side in the future, if he or the people around him angered her one day, would she treat him and his friends the same way she treated the Xiao family?

While Zhou Wen was still pondering over it, the Gu began to disperse. Moments later, not a single one was left. Only Ya’er flew over with two Ice Silkworms.

Zhou Wen took out the Essence Gold Pot that Worm Dugu had given him and the two Ice Silkworms obediently crawled in.
