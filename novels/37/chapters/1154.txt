Chapter 1155: Double Terror Strength

The Singularity Universe’s Terror transformation allowed Zhou Wen to obtain one of the abilities of Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, but this ability could only be used via an exchange. He couldn’t teleport the tiny planet away.

Sending one away and swapping to another planet that ended up being devoured by the Planet Devourer still allowed it to replenish its mass and be rejuvenated. This was clearly far from the outcome Zhou Wen wanted.

Is there no other way? Zhou Wen constantly gained insight into the power Singularity Universe gave him.

Zhou Wen realized that the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique didn’t necessarily need a planet to be exchanged. He could exchange a planet with a paper ball. That was also possible.

However, with the current strength of Singularity Universe, he was still unable to achieve that. This was because the positioning was too vague. The smallest unit that the Singularity Universe could locate was a planet. It was impossible to locate a paper ball from afar, so there was naturally no way to do a swap.

Since I’m already at the Terror grade, shouldn’t the resolution be raised? Even if I can’t see a paper ball, I should still be able to locate a mountain or river! Zhou Wen felt somewhat depressed.

However, on second thought, Zhou Wen’s heart stirred again.

Just the Singularity Universe definitely couldn’t be that precise. After all, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art was a rather macroscopic Essence Energy Art.

However, the power of the Godfiend Era was different. It was also spatial power, but the Godfiend Era was a spatial power with relatively high precision.

If I can use the power of Clown Mask and Singularity Universe at the same time like I can use Great Brahma and Clown Mask, what will the effects be? Will I be able to do some more precise location and exchange? With a thought, Zhou Wen circulated the two Terror form powers simultaneously.

Since he wasn’t afraid of death in-game, there was no harm trying.

Bam!

Zhou Wen attempted to fuse the powers of the two Terror forms. The blood-colored avatar’s body split apart and vanished. The game screen turned black as a notification popped up: ‘Successful Suicide.’

Zhou Wen’s face darkened as he thought to himself, How can this be considered suicide? I’m clearly donating my body for experimentation.

Although his attempt failed, Zhou Wen knew very well that this was only because he hadn’t grasped the rhythm of the two fused Terror form powers. It didn’t mean that they couldn’t fuse.

Therefore, Zhou Wen began trying again, only to be notified that he had succeeded in his suicide.

Every death brought him some benefits. Zhou Wen knew that he wasn’t far from success.

If I can make all nine Essence Energy Arts reach the Terror form and use all nine Terror forms of power simultaneously, what will happen? Zhou Wen wondered at the back of his mind.

After practicing hard for most of the night, Zhou Wen finally succeeded in fusing the two Terror form powers into one for the first time. Then, he attempted to teleport a tiny planet out.

However, when he pressed his palm on the planet, a black hole appeared and swallowed the planet.

The black hole also began devouring everything around it, nearly sucking the blood-colored avatar in. Thankfully, Zhou Wen reacted quickly and teleported out.

This was completely different from what Zhou Wen had expected. Clearly, the fused spatial powers hadn’t developed in the direction Zhou Wen wanted. Instead, they had produced a black hole.

I wonder if I can deal with the Planet Devourer by pitting a black hole against a black hole? Just as Zhou Wen was thinking, he realized that the Planet Devourer had already descended on the small black hole he had created.

The Planet Devourer rushed towards the small black hole. After the two collided, not only did they not clash, but they fused into one, making the Planet Devourer even stronger.

That black hole betrayed me! Zhou Wen nearly spat out a mouthful of blood.

He knew that it was because his control of the fused Terror powers wasn’t good enough. Furthermore, using a black hole to resist another black hole wasn’t the right solution.

With no choice, Zhou Wen could only continue experimenting. Thankfully, he already had the experience of success, so everything went much smoother.

Zhou Wen quickly mastered the method to create a black hole. However, all the black holes he could create were miniature black holes. Furthermore, he needed enough external matter to support them.

Although this move was useless against the Planet Devourer, it was still very effective against other Terror creatures.

Zhou Wen continued his research. His main goal was to truly achieve sky-stealing and sun-swapping. He wanted to teleport the planet away without giving the Planet Devourer a chance to replenish its matter.

Zhou Wen wasn’t able to complete his goal until morning, but he made some progress.

An Sheng sent a message early in the morning, telling Zhou Wen to temporarily stay in the An family residence and not go anywhere. Tonight, he could exchange identities with the fake Zhou Wen.

“Who’s that Zhou Wen?” Zhou Wen replied.

“Guess.” An Sheng replied.

“I’ve no idea.” Zhou Wen thought to himself, Guess my ass! How would I know who it is?

However, on second thought, it wasn’t easy to pretend to be him without revealing any flaws.

His signature Companion Beasts were unique. Furthermore, the person needed to have sufficient strength. Even with the chick and antelope as cover, it wouldn’t be easy to find such a person.

“It can’t be you, right?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“No, it’d be too obvious if it was me. I’d definitely be seen through.” An Sheng debunked Zhou Wen’s guess.

“Who is it?” Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure it out. There were only a few experts in Luoyang. It was impossible for Leng Zongzheng and An Tianzuo to impersonate him. Zhou Wen really couldn’t guess who else had such abilities.

“You’ll know when the time comes.” An Sheng clearly liked this feeling and didn’t tell Zhou Wen.

Since An Sheng didn’t say anything, Zhou Wen had no choice but to stop asking. After chatting with An Sheng for a while, An Sheng got busy with work.

Ya’er pushed open the door and walked in. She was holding a plate with breakfast on it. Furthermore, it looked like it was for two.

Ya’er placed the plate on the table and sat down opposite Zhou Wen. She blinked and said, “Breakfast, together.”

Zhou Wen hadn’t slept in the first place. He went to sit down and prepare to have breakfast with Ya’er, but to his surprise, Tsukuyomi walked in before he even sat down. She took Zhou Wen’s seat and took a bite of his breakfast. She looked at Ya’er and said with a smile, “Not bad. It’s pretty good. Thank you.”

“There’s no need to thank me. Anyway, I feed the dogs at home every day. I’m used to it.” Ya’er pushed the remaining portion of the plate to Tsukuyomi. “Eat more if you like it.”

Zhou Wen didn’t know why Tsukuyomi liked to be at odds with Ya’er, but when he saw that they were about to fight again, he hurriedly went over to pull Ya’er away. He coughed lightly and said to Tsukuyomi, “Don’t you want to see how humans learn? I’ll take you to the place I used to go to school, okay?”

“Isn’t it just a place like the Royal College? It’s boring,” Tsukuyomi said.

“It’s different. The place I attended is rather interesting, but we can only go there later.” Zhou Wen wanted to meet his old classmates, but on careful thought, they had already graduated. Unless they had continued studying or become a tutor, it would be impossible for him to see them again.

I wonder how Gu Dian is now? Zhou Wen thought of the devil-like man.

He had already roughly learned about Li Xuan and company from An Sheng. Only Gu Dian had disappeared after graduation. It was unknown where he had gone.
