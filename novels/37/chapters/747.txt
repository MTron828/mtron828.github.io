Chapter 748: Old Master Xia

Translator: CKtalon

“By killing so many people, what’s the difference between you and a devil-like Jing Daoxian? Aren’t you afraid that the other five Federation families will join forces to attack you?” Zhou Wen asked.

Old Master Xia sneered and said, “You killed these people. What has it got to do with me? I’ll naturally kill you to avenge them. You will also become an important step in my advancement to the Mythical stage.”

With that said, Old Master Xia extended his hand and grabbed at Zhou Wen and Xia Xuanyue. At the same time, he continued, “As a member of the Xia family, you should contribute to the Xia family. Return your bloodline’s talent to me.”

A terrifying suction force was produced as Xia Xuanyue and Zhou Wen involuntarily headed for Old Master Xia.

This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a human use such terrifying strength. His strength couldn’t withstand the suction force. Together with the Heaven-Opening Scripture, he moved in Old Master Xia’s direction, his feet leaving two marks on the stone slabs on the ground.

Xia Xuanyue had expended too much Essence Energy and was in an even worse state. Her body had already flown up.

Zhou Wen placed the log down with one hand and stabbed it into the ground. He used his other hand to hold Xia Xuanyue back and thanks to the log, they finally stopped.

The enemy of an enemy was a friend. Now, Xia Liuchuan and Xia Xuanyue were probably going to completely fall out with Old Master Xia. Perhaps he could use their strength later.

Although Xia Xuanyue no longer had any combat strength, Xia Liuchuan was still outside. Furthermore, he had a Guardian with him. Perhaps he could use his strength to rush out of the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.

Otherwise, in this array, any Companion Beast’s Essence Energy would be drained. The more Companion Beasts summoned, the stronger the augmentation Old Master Xia would receive. He had to rush out first.

“That old sicko has absorbed the Life Providence and Life Souls of countless geniuses. He has also absorbed the Essence Energy and life essence of more than ten thousand Epic experts. His strength is unfathomable. Speaking of which, even a tiger will not eat its cubs; yet, this old sicko wants to devour his descendants. Why doesn’t the heavens strike him to death with lightning?” Zhou Wen placed Xia Xuanyue behind the log and got her to hug it. He held the Golden Overlord Sword and slashed out sword beams at the old sicko, hoping to temporarily stop his suction force so that he could rush out of the Heaven and Earth Essence Origin-Returning Array with the log.

However, the Golden Sword Aura that Zhou Wen slashed out was sucked in by the old sicko. Not only did it fail to injure him, but it also became a tonic for him.

“I refuse to believe that you can suck everything.” Zhou Wen summoned the Great Might Vajra Bull and made it shake the Soul Suppression Bell. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, the Soul Suppressing Bell’s chime couldn’t stir Old Master Xia’s soul. It didn’t make him dizzy at all. Instead, as the Great Might Vajra Bull was too big in size, the power of the Heaven-Opening Scripture couldn’t envelop it completely. Its Essence Energy quickly drained as its body moved towards Old Master Xia’s palm.

The Great Might Vajra Bull struggled with all its might, but it was unable to stop itself from sliding towards Old Master Xia. Its four hooves sank into the stone slab, but it didn’t stop its slide towards Old Master Xia, scaring the Great Might Vajra Bull into mooing.

Zhou Wen hurriedly summoned it back and didn’t dare release it again.

“Don’t use Companion Beasts. He has absorbed countless Life Providences and Life Souls. He can absorb any type of Essence Energy for his own use. Companion Beasts are condensed from Essence Energy. The power of any Companion Beast will be of help to him...” Xia Liuchuan warned Zhou Wen loudly from outside.

“How can I rush out without a Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“Since you insist on dying, come in and join them.” Old Master Xia snorted coldly. Xia Liuchuan had already used his fists to strike the light barrier of the array, but he suddenly felt the area in front of him empty out. He had already fallen into the array.

Old Master Xia used his other hand to grab and suck at Xia Liuchuan. Xia Liuchuan’s body immediately slid towards him.

Xia Liuchuan didn’t retreat. He gritted his teeth and threw a punch at Old Master Xia.

Guardians were lifeforms and not pure energy. They were somewhat different from Companion Beasts. The Guardian’s strength should be able to be of some use against Old Master Xia.

Boom!

Old Master Xia’s palm collided with Xia Liuchuan’s fist and was forced back a few steps. The suction force immediately vanished.

“I’ll hold him back. Take Xuanyue and leave.” Xia Liuchuan threw another punch at Old Master Xia and shouted.

“Brother, I’m counting on you.” Zhou Wen picked up the log and ran with Xia Xuanyue.

Xia Xuanyue was still somewhat hesitant, but Zhou Wen immediately said, “It’ll be easier for your brother to run if we run. If you stay a minute longer, your brother will be in greater danger.”

Xia Xuanyue naturally understood this principle. She gritted her teeth and ran to the edge of the array formation with Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen attacked the array, but when his strength struck the barrier, it was absorbed by the barrier, preventing it from cracking.

Essence Energy-related skills won’t do, but I wonder if pure physical strength works? Zhou Wen didn’t think too much about it as he forcefully switched to the Defy Ancient Sovereign Life Soul. He used the Demon Dragon True Body and endured the loss of Essence Energy as he threw a punch at the barrier.

Boom!

The barrier trembled. Although it wasn’t shattered, it gave Zhou Wen hope. Pure physical strength was indeed effective against the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.

Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate as he punched the barrier, again and again, hoping to penetrate it and escape the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.

Xia Liuchuan was attacking Old Master Xia crazily, but all his attacks were easily dodged by Old Master Xia, like a cat teasing a mouse.

“I gave you everything you have, and I taught you all your techniques. How dare you attack me?” Old Master Xia easily dodged Xia Liuchuan’s attack and stared at him coldly.

Xia Liuchuan didn’t say a word and just kept attacking.

In the past, Old Master Xia had indeed doted on him. In the past, he had indeed treated Old Master Xia as his closest kin, even closer than his own parents.

It wasn’t until the year he turned fifteen that he accidentally saw Old Master Xia suck his talented cousin dry. From then on, he rarely went to the East Courtyard.

“I originally thought that you were a little different from the others, but it looks like you’re just a beast that will ultimately remain mortal. Forget it. With you as my last cornerstone, my raising of you for so many years wasn’t in vain.” Old Master Xia actually made a move. His palm actually passed through Xia Liuchuan’s fist and struck his chest.

Xia Liuchuan was wearing the Guardian armor. Although he wasn’t seriously injured, he still took a few steps back.

“Although a Guardian is strong, it’s a pity that you don’t have the time to truly control his power. Furthermore, do you really think that after contracting with the Guardian, he will really belong to you?” Old Master Xia retracted his palm. There was a wound on his finger and blood was dripping out.

There was also a smear of blood on Xia Liuchuan’s armor. Clearly, the blood did not belong to him.
