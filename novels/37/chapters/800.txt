“Do you really want to exchange the Ice Silkworm for my Kuman Nee?” Xiao Tianfang hurriedly asked, afraid that Zhou Wen would be persuaded otherwise by Worm Dugu.

“That depends on whether your Kuman Nee can interest me. She looks a little special to me, different from the Kuman Nee I’ve seen before. Tell me what’s so special about her.” Zhou Wen firstly wanted to bait Xiao Tianfang into the scam, and secondly, he wanted to know more about the Kuman Nee.

“This...” Xiao Tianfang was somewhat hesitant. After all, he wasn’t sure if Zhou Wen would use two Ice Silkworms to exchange for Kuman Nee. If he explained Kuman Nee’s origins and Zhou Wen didn’t make the exchange, he would suffer a great loss.

“Uncle-Master, if you want a Kuman Nee, our Dugu family has plenty. How about this? Come back with me. You can exchange the Ice Silkworms with our Dugu family. We can offer to exchange two Ice Silkworms for two Kuman Nee. Whatever species you want, you can choose all the Kuman Thong in the Dugu family,” said Worm Dugu.

“Tianfang.” Xiao Liuqi was a little anxious as he looked at Xiao Tianfang.

Xiao Tianfang gritted his teeth and said to Zhou Wen, “I don’t dare say that my Kuman Nee is unprecedented, but she’s indeed extraordinary. She can be said to be unique. You won’t find another one in all of the Federation. If you really want it, can we have a private chat?”

“There aren’t any outsiders here. Is there anything you can’t say out loud?” Zhou Wen asked.

Xiao Tianfang said, “You won’t necessarily exchange for my Kuman Nee. Even if you do the exchange, you wouldn’t want outsiders to know her secret, right?”

“That makes sense. Alright then.” Zhou Wen nodded slightly.

“Uncle-Master, that Kuman Nee really isn’t worth two Ice Silkworms. Why don’t you exchange it with me? Our Dugu family has all kinds of Kuman Nee, so why do we have to go so far to get one?” Worm Dugu had the urge to hold Zhou Wen back.

“Cut it out. I’ve seen all those Kuman Nee at your place. I’m sick of them. They are nothing interesting. I think this Kuman Nee is a little different,” Zhou Wen said.

“You really have good taste. This way, please.” Xiao Tianfang made an inviting gesture.

“Wait for me here. I’ll be back after taking a look,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan and Worm Dugu before following Xiao Tianfang to the temporary camp they had set up in a nearby cave.

Xiao Tianfang and Xiao Liuqi saw that Zhou Wen seemed totally unfazed along the way, as though he didn’t care if they had set up an ambush. This made them feel that Zhou Wen was definitely very terrifying.

“How may I address you?” When they reached the cave, Xiao Tianfang got Xiao Liuqi to personally guard the door while he conversed with Zhou Wen alone.

“My surname is Zhou,” Zhou Wen said casually.

“Elder Zhou, you must be an expert at Kuman Thong. You must know a lot about this. You know that some Kuman Thong and Kuman Nee have very special refinement methods...” Xiao Tianfang probed.

Zhou Wen waved his hand and said disapprovingly, “I don’t care how this Kuman Nee came about. I just want to know what’s so special about her. I only want something unique. If it’s not unique, it’s meaningless.”

Seeing that Zhou Wen didn’t mind the method of refining the Kuman Nee, Xiao Tianfang said with a smile, “Elder Zhou, you are indeed an expert. Your insight isn’t something an ordinary person can compare with. My Kuman Nee was refined by a Buddhist master. The abilities this Kuman Nee has are also different from ordinary Kuman Nee. She doesn’t have ordinary abilities like luck enhancement, but she has a way of dealing with Gu. She can capture Mythical Gu independently.”

“Is that all?” Zhou Wen revealed a look of disappointment.

Xiao Tianfang gritted his teeth and continued, “To be honest, the baby used to refine the Kuman Nee is the reincarnation of the legendary Gu God. It has a natural restraining effect on Gu. Our Xiao family was too incompetent and couldn’t nurture her well. If an expert like you were to nurture her, you might be able to unleash her full strength. When that happens, she will definitely be of great use.”

“The reincarnation of a Gu God? That’s interesting. I heard that there’s a couple who reared Gu and their child was the reincarnation of a Gu God. Are these two matters related?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Well...” Xiao Tianfang neither admitted nor denied.

“I’ve only heard of that matter as well. I originally wanted to rush over to see if I could refine a Kuman Nee, but I was a step too late. If this Kuman Nee’s material was that fetus, I’ll do the exchange,” Zhou Wen said.

“You’re really a kindred spirit. Do you really want to do the exchange? Two Ice Silkworms for this Kuman Nee?” Xiao Tianfang was still worried and wanted to make another confirmation.

“From the looks of it, this Kuman Nee was really refined by that baby. It’s no wonder you are so careful.” As Zhou Wen spoke, he placed the Essence Gold Pot on the stone platform and pushed it in front of Xiao Tianfang. “If it’s really refined from that fetus, I want it. You can have the Ice Silkworms.”

“Do you mind if I take a look at the Ice Silkworms inside? It’s not that I don’t believe you, but this concerns the future of our Xiao family...” Xiao Tianfang asked carefully. At this stage, he was still very careful.

“Just open it. My Essence Gold Pot is extraordinary. As long as I trap a Gu, even a Dragon King Gu won’t be able to escape,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

When Xiao Tianfang heard that the Essence Gold Pot was so powerful, he picked it up and observed it carefully. He felt that it was indeed a good pot, but he didn’t know what was good about it.

The Xiao family only started raising Gu recently and they weren’t as proficient as nurturing Kuman Thong. How could he recognize a Gu pot made by Worm Dugu?

Xiao Tianfang didn’t dare open it for fear that the Ice Silkworm would escape. He wasn’t confident of escaping in front of two Ice Silkworms.

However, on second thought, Kuman Nee was connected to his life, so it was impossible for Zhou Wen to harm him if he wanted her.

When Xiao Tianfang thought of this, he carefully opened a sliver of the Gu pot. Through the crack, he saw the two Ice Silkworms inside, but they were restrained by the Essence Gold Pot. No matter how hard they struggled, they couldn’t rush out.

Xiao Tianfang was relieved. He opened the lid completely and the two Ice Silkworms inside only circled around the pot, unable to crawl out.

“I didn’t expect such a Gu pot to exist in this world. My horizons have really been broadened today.” Xiao Tianfang thought for a moment and said, “Since you are so sincere, I won’t hide it from you. This Kuman Nee of mine was refined from that fetus. It has a very strong restraining effect on Gu worms. It is also an extremely powerful existence among Kuman Nee. It can be considered a fusion between Gu and Kuman Nee. It is a unique existence in this world. You definitely wouldn’t regret the exchange.”

“As expected. I knew I wouldn’t be wrong. In that case, the two Ice Silkworms are yours. Remove her Intrinsic Lock and give her to me,” Zhou Wen said.

Xiao Tianfang said in embarrassment, “Elder Zhou, your pot is amazing, but our Xiao family can’t compare to you. Without a pot that can store the Ice Silkworms, we aren’t able to take them back. We originally wanted this Kuman Nee to control them, but now that Kuman Nee is to be transferred to you, there’s really no other way. Can you lend us the Gu pot for a while? Once it’s successfully tamed, we’ll definitely return it immediately.”
