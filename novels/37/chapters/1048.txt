Chapter 1049: Altering the Rules Again

Translator: CKtalon

“Twenty-four hours have passed, and the Invisibility Cloak has appeared again. Doesn’t that mean that by using these Companion Beasts, one can indefinitely repeat the trick day by day until the last day of the rankings ends and enters the unlimited single challenge mode? Only then can one chase the Golden Battle God Halberd down from first place?”

“Holy sh*t, that works? Then we won’t be able to see anything new. There are still a few days until the end of the rankings.”

“Let me do the math. A total of thirteen Mythical Companion Beasts appeared. This is terrifying enough. Typical Guardians probably won’t have a chance of winning if they encounter him, right?”

“That might not be the case. Some powerful Guardians have AOE attacks that can insta kill them. It’s useless no matter how many low-level Mythical Companion Beasts there are.”

“Haha, I originally imagined that it would be a battle between Guardians. I never expected to not see Guardians in the next few days.”

“What a pity. Pure humans can’t participate. Otherwise, I would really want to see what kind of scene when these Companion Beasts appear alongside one person.”

As everyone was discussing, they suddenly realized that the dazzling light had appeared above the cube arena again.

This time, the beam-like creature was even more straightforward. After it appeared, it said, “The time to accept a challenge for Companion Beasts shall be shortened to three minutes. If the challenge is not accepted in three minutes, it will be considered a forfeit.”

With that said, the dazzling creature tore through the air and vanished.

“Why are they only targeting Companion Beasts? Why aren’t Guardians suffering any restrictions?”

“This is clearly discrimination against humans. It’s fine if you don’t let pure humans participate in the competition, but even Companion Beasts are being targeted by changing the rules again and again. Then why don’t you just not let Companion Beasts participate in the competition? Why are you acting so hypocritical? Disgusting.”

“What can we do? The rules are set by dimensional creatures. This is their game to begin with. They can change it however they want. Humans are nothing.”

“How infuriating. They play however they like because they have the means to do so. When they are at a disadvantage, they change the rules. How f*cking shameless.”

“Don’t play if you can’t afford it. Just say that only Guardians can participate.”

People were gloating the last time the rules were changed, but this time, many people were crying out for justice for the Companion Beasts’ owner.

It wasn’t that they had any feelings for these Companion Beasts, nor did they really like to fight for justice. It was just that the dimension’s repeated changing of the rules allowed them to see through the essence of the ranking battle.

This wasn’t a game for humans at all. Even human Companion Beasts were targeted time and time again. This feeling was very uncomfortable.

...

“The acceptance time for a challenge has been changed to three minutes. In that case, it will take twice the number of Companion Beasts a day to hold the top of the rankings. Even if it’s any one of the six families, it won’t be easy to gather twenty-four Mythical Companion Beasts,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a sigh.

“Is there no other way?” Zhang Yuzhi said as she looked at the Golden Battle God Halberd on the screen.

“There’s no other way unless more Mythical Companion Beasts participate in the battle. However, even if we gather twenty-four Mythical Companion Beasts, the dimensional creatures can still change the rules again,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“In that case, what’s the point of setting the rules?” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“It’s meaningless to begin with. To the dimension, this is just a game. However, to Earth, this game might decide our fate for the next year,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“Is it that serious? Will the person really become the King of Earth if they win first place? I don’t think so.” Zhang Yuzhi didn’t agree with Zhang Chunqiu’s point of view.

“It’s very serious. It’s so serious that it’s unimaginable,” Zhang Chunqiu said seriously.

“Since it’s so serious, why don’t we stop it?” Zhang Yuzhi asked in puzzlement.

“We’re trying, but there’s not much time left.” Zhang Chunqiu smiled. “However, the situation isn’t that bad. After all, Guardians who participate in the battle have to rely on humans to go further. Perhaps those humans can influence Guardians.”

“The Guardian grows, but human’s strength is stagnant. Its influence will only weaken with time. How much use can it be?” Zhang Yuzhi clearly knew what the Guardian was about. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“That might not be the case. There’s still a way,” Zhang Chunqiu said with narrowed eyes.

“You mean Ya, Wang Mingyuan, and company...” Zhang Yuzhi was alarmed.

“What they can do might not be impossible for us considering our Zhang family’s abilities,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“But that would make...” Zhang Yuzhi didn’t finish her sentence.

“Make us a monster?” Zhang Chunqiu leaned on the railing and looked at the distant Mount Dragon Tiger. “Sometimes, it’s really difficult to distinguish between humans and monsters. If I have to choose between monsters and being enslaved, I’d rather become a monster.”

With that said, Zhang Chunqiu turned his head and smiled brightly at Zhang Yuzhi. “Of course, it’s the kind of monster that doesn’t eat humans.”

...

At the Dugu family residence in the South District, Dugu Ge was also watching the livestream. His face was expressionless, and it was unknown what he was thinking.

“Second Uncle, is it really impossible for humans to advance to the Mythical stage through their own strength?” Dugu Ge was still in a daze, but he asked Worm Dugu.

“No one can do it for the time being,” Worm Dugu answered.

Dugu Ge seemed to have long known that this was the answer. He continued muttering to himself, “Our Dugu family has been researching for many years, but we haven’t found a way to advance humans to the Mythical stage. Could it be that we have to take Wang Mingyuan’s old path?”

“You can’t say that. In fact, it’s not like our family hasn’t made any progress over the years. For example, the art of humans and Gu becoming one might allow humans to advance to the Mythical stage,” said Worm Dugu.

Dugu Ge shook his head and said, “We are just fooling ourselves. What’s the difference between the so-called humans and Gu as one? It’s just that he uses a Guardian, while we use Gu. We all turn into monsters. There’s no difference.”

“There’s nothing we can do about that. Humans have huge flaws in their talent. There’s an uncrossable gap between them and the Mythical stage.” Worm Dugu was somewhat helpless.

When he was young, he was like Dugu Ge and company. He had a passion and wanted to rely on his own strength to advance to the Mythical stage, but after so many years, the Gu he had reared had advanced to the Mythical stage. However, he ultimately remained at the peak of the Epic stage and couldn’t advance any further.

“Forget it. Let’s see how the owner of those Companion Beasts deals with the situations. To take out twenty-four Mythical Companion Beasts at once, even the six families can’t easily gather them, right? Even if they can, no one will expose their strength in public.” Dugu Ge looked at the Golden Battle God Halberd with interest.
