Chapter 1492 Unimaginable Power

Zhou Wen felt as though his body had sunk into solidified concrete. It was impossible to budge an inch.

The Golden Qilin walked over step by step amidst the golden light. Its eye, which had been stabbed by Zhou Wen, remained bleeding. It bared its teeth with its mouth agape as though it wanted to eat Zhou Wen whole.

It’s over! Zhou Wen wanted to use instant transmission, but the entire Laojun Platform was filled with the frozen radiance. There was no space for him to carry out instant transmission. All he could do was watch helplessly as the Golden Qilin gradually approached.

Even the Soul Mirror was frozen in midair. It could only emit divine light in one direction, but that meant that it was already useless.

Ding!

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling despair, he suddenly heard a strange sound coming from his pocket.

Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he realized that it likely came from the mysterious phone. However, he didn’t know why it was making such a strange sound.

However, Zhou Wen knew what happened next because the two Golden Wyrms that were giving birth returned to him.

Without any time to think, the Golden Qilin opened its mouth and bit down at Zhou Wen.

If it had managed to bite him, Zhou Wen’s head would probably have said goodbye to his body.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the two Golden Wyrms and transformed them into shears.

At the instant the Golden Qilin’s mouth bit down, the two Golden Wyrm Shears pierced through the frozen golden light and reached straight into its mouth. Then, they sliced down like a hot knife through butter.

Zhou Wen saw blood spew out of the Golden Qilin’s mouth as golden blood splattered all over his face.

Zhou Wen could sense that the pair of Golden Wyrm Shears were crazily wrecking the Golden Qilin’s stomach, grinding its organs into a mess.

Haha, the heavens are really helping me to have the Golden Wyrms appear at this moment! Zhou Wen knew that he had to thank his good luck.

Any later and Zhou Wen would have died. If the Golden Wyrms had appeared earlier, they might not have had the chance to rush into the Golden Qilin’s stomach.

Although the Golden Wyrms were also at the Calamity grade and were sharp enough, they were only at the Human Realm. If they hadn’t entered the Golden Qilin’s stomach by chance, they might not have been able to severely injure it.

The pair of Golden Wyrm Shears twisted crazily in the Golden Qilin’s stomach. It cried out tragically as it rolled on the ground, blood spewing out from its mouth like a fountain. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Golden Qilin attempted to lunge at Zhou Wen a few times amidst its struggling, but it ultimately collapsed due to the excruciating pain.

Kill it… Kill it… Zhou Wen was still trapped in the frozen golden light and couldn’t move. All he could do was secretly cheer the two Golden Wyrms on.

Just as the Golden Qilin was about to die, Zhou Wen suddenly felt a dangerous aura.

The Golden Qilin’s entire body emitted a golden glow as its body turned into a golden crystal. One could clearly see the pair of Golden Wyrm shears that were entangled inside.

That didn’t matter. What mattered was that the Golden Qilin’s ferocious face was filled with determination. Its transparent body resembled a golden crystal and had a strange energy surge as though it would explode at any moment.

It’s self-destructing! Zhou Wen was alarmed. He wanted to escape, but it was too late.

The solidified golden light bloomed with the Golden Qilin, emitting extremely terrifying energy. It was about to self-destruct with the Golden Qilin.

The terrifying energy fluctuations were enough to make Zhou Wen realize that even the Prisoned Dragon armor’s Absolute Defense couldn’t withstand the might of the self-destruction.

The might produced by the self-destruction of a Hell-level creature far exceeded the limits of Zhou Wen’s tolerance.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen summoned the Chaos Egg.

Splat!

A huge palm descended from the sky, instantly shattering the frozen golden light like glass as the fragments fell to the ground.

Zhou Wen’s body fell as well. He watched helplessly as the huge palm struck down at the Golden Qilin that was about to self-destruct.

With a thought from Zhou Wen, the Golden Wyrms instantly returned to Zhou Wen before he heard a clap. The Golden Qilin that had gathered terrifying power was slapped to the ground. Its body was pressed down by the huge palm as though it had been flattened. Pfft!

Zhou Wen heard a sound similar to firecrackers coming from beneath the palm. After the crisp sound, there was silence.

Zhou Wen looked in the direction of the furry palm and saw the giant bear’s head extend in from the periphery wall. Its two front paws were already inside the wall, and the back half of its body was still outside.

As for the baby bear, it was lying on the giant bear’s shoulder.

The giant bear raised the flattened Golden Qilin’s claw. The tiles beneath the claw had shattered as though something had exploded. The Golden Qilin’s body had already vanished, leaving only a golden horn in the rubble.

Zhou Wen was horrified. How terrifying was the Golden Qilin? It was very likely a Hell-level existence, but the power of its self-destruction was suppressed by the giant bear’s claw. It was unimaginable what kind of power it had.

Zhou Wen couldn’t even defeat the Golden Qilin. Now that he was targeted by the giant bear, he naturally didn’t feel any joy from escaping death.

Boom!

The giant bear climbed over the wall and walked in. Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the giant bear didn’t need to enter through the door. It could directly climb over the wall.

It wasn’t as simple as flipping over a wall. If it was really just a wall, Zhou Wen could fly over it no matter how high it was.

However, Laojun Platform’s yard was an independent space. It was also protected by Laojun Platform’s rules. To be able to gain forceful entry not only required the ability to tear through space, but also the ability to clash head-on with Laojun Platform’s rules.

Zhou Wen was temporarily unable to estimate how much of this terrifying power was needed.

He watched the giant bear flip into the yard. Although he knew that it was useless, he subconsciously retreated. Countless thoughts flashed through his mind, but he couldn’t think of a way to save his life at the giant bear’s paws.

After the giant bear entered the yard, its body became much smaller. It wasn’t as huge as before.

The baby bear got off its back and ran towards Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen wasn’t alarmed but delighted. Many thoughts flashed through his mind. Can I use this baby bear as a hostage? But do bears know what a hostage is? Will it be threatened?

The baby bear reached Zhou Wen amid his dilemma. It circled him a few times as though it was taking in his scent.

After circling a few times, the baby bear seemed to confirm something as it pounced on Zhou Wen and licked his face. It looked extremely affectionate.

Does this fellow still recognize me? Zhou Wen’s expression changed. He didn’t know if it was a blessing or a curse.
