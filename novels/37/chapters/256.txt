Chapter 257 Blood Storm

Without any hesitation, An Sheng dodged the purple vines’ attacks while cutting off another Purple Air Bell. However, An Sheng didn’t take it for himself this time. Instead, he used his dagger to lift the Purple Air Bell.

The Purple Air Bell flew straight at Zhou Wen. He reached out to receive it, and the Purple Air Bell turned into a purple gas that seeped into his skin. Without needing to expend any energy to incubate it, it had already become a tattoo that resembled a morning glory flower. It left Zhou Wen overjoyed.

It was difficult for Zhou Wen to incubate ordinary Epic stage Companion Eggs, but the Purple Air Bell was unique. There was no need for any incubation, allowing him to obtain an Epic Companion Beast.

Soon, An Sheng picked another bell and Zhou Wen caught it once again. He obtained another Epic Companion Beast.

The last bell was caught by An Sheng after he sliced it off. He also had two Purple Air Bells.

With all four Purple Air Bells cut off, the purple vine suddenly seemed to have lost its soul as it froze.

A gust of wind blew and the purple vines dissipated into dust. The perfectly fine purple vine was gone.

Zhao Xin and company looked at Zhou Wen oddly. An Sheng got everyone to return to the vehicle and they continued on their journey. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Pal, how did you know that those bells fear physical attacks?” Lord Alcohol asked once they were on board.

The others also looked at Zhou Wen. To be able to tell the crux of the problem in such a short period of time wasn’t an easy task.

“I only gained inspiration from listening to your story,” Zhou Wen said. “My story?” Lord Alcohol was a little stunned.

Zhou Wen continued, “That’s right, your story. Didn’t you say that those flying sabers didn’t harm the three of them? I was wondering why they didn’t harm Jing Daoxian and company. Although I couldn’t think of the reason, I thought of the problems with these bells. They only counterattacked when we attacked, and they didn’t have the consciousness to take the initiative to attack. Furthermore, their counterattacks were using our powers. I then wondered if it was the same reason as those flying sabers not causing any harm. Hence, I thought about it and surmised that since they do not have any offensive abilities, I could get Adjutant An to give it a try. I never expected him to succeed.”

“As expected of a young man. They are so quick to think. It’s no wonder Adjutant An thinks highly of you. I’m really getting old. Even if I made the connection, I wouldn’t have dared to try it,” praised Lord Alcohol.

“Even a broken clock is right twice a day. He made Adjutant An take a risk on a mere guess. He was right this time, but if he was wrong, wouldn’t he have harmed Adjutant An?” Zhao Xin said with a twitch of his lips. Clearly, he was against Zhou Wen’s actions.

Zhou Wen didn’t refute Zhao Xian and Lord Alcohol because they weren’t wrong. If it was only a guess, Zhou Wen would have been extremely irresponsible to have An Sheng take such a risk.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t making a guess. He had crucial information and knew that Ansheng would be fine. That was why he had sent him over. However, there was no need for Zhou Wen to explain to others.

On the way, they encountered many problems. However, these people were experts at the Epic stage. They each had their own unique traits, so they resolved the problems without needing Zhou Wen to do anything.

Zhou Wen kept playing games. After respawning the tiger a few times, he still failed to have a Companion Egg drop.

When can I be like Wang Lu and run around with the baby tiger to have Companion Eggs rain? Zhou Wen yearned for a Lucky Baby Tiger, but he just couldn’t get one to drop.

Originally, driving from Luoyang to Zhuolu didn’t take more than a day. However, there were many dimensional zones everywhere in this day and age. They were unable to proceed in a straight line, and highways didn’t allow easy passage. They also encountered problems along the way, so it took them until the evening of the fourth day before they finally arrived at Zhuolu County.

There weren’t many ordinary people in Zhuolu County anymore. Most of the humans had already fled to larger cities, leaving only a small number of independent hunters and some military organizations behind.

An Sheng drove straight into a yard that looked like some unit. There were many soldiers inside.

“Adjutant An.” An officer immediately came forward to greet An Sheng.

“How’s the situation over here? Where’s Madam?” Ansheng asked.

“Madam has already entered the ancient battlefield with the rest.” The officer smiled bitterly.

“What happened? Didn’t I tell you to calm Madam down first and let her wait two days before entering?” An Sheng’s expression changed immediately.

Although he was not a biological son of the An family, An Tianzuo and Ouyang Lan treated him like family. An Sheng had long treated them like family too.

“We did what you instructed. Madam had already agreed to it, but two days ago, an anomaly happened in the ancient battlefield. Madam couldn’t wait any longer, so she led people inside,” the officer said.

“What anomaly?” An Sheng’s expression turned even nastier. If there was an anomaly, it meant that it was even more dangerous.

“It began raining on the ancient battlefield. It was very heavy rain and the color of the rain was red. Anyone who came into contact with that blood-like rain would act up like a rabid dog. They would bite any living thing they saw. When the blood started to rain, a few soldiers didn’t notice it and were drenched by the blood rain. In the end, when we saw those soldiers, they had already ripped each other up into an unrecognizable mess.” The officer couldn’t help but shiver at the mere recall.

“Young Master Wen, stay at the base and wait for me. I’ll go to the battlefield to take a look.” As An Sheng spoke, he prepared to lead his men to the ancient battlefield.

“Ah Sheng, take me along. I’ll just stay outside the battlefield to watch. I won’t cause you any trouble,” Zhou Wen said.

“Alright. However, you have to promise me that you will definitely not enter.” An Sheng knew that Zhou Wen’s personality was too similar to the An family’s members. Even if he didn’t allow Zhou Wen to go, he would definitely do so by himself. Therefore, he might as well take him along and watch over him.

“I won’t enter as said. Don’t worry. I know that my powers are limited, so I won’t cause you any trouble.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth. He had no intention of entering since it wasn’t a place he could step into.

An Sheng got someone to bring over the latest information. He then gave Lord Alcohol and the rest a copy each and let them take a look while they were on the way.

Zhou Wen also received a copy. After getting into the vehicle, he carefully read through it.

The situation at the battlefield was indeed terrible. When the expedition team first arrived, the dimensional zones there weren’t that strange, without much danger inside. Having only found some ancient ruins, they invited many experts to conduct some studies. Among them was an authority in the field of history, Ouyang Ting—the former principal.

However, with the passage of time, the ancient battlefield grew stranger and stranger. More than a month ago, the old principal, a group of experts, and the people protecting them were trapped in there and were nowhere to be found. Only one soldier in charge of watching over the equipment escaped.
