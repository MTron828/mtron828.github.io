Chapter 1172: Demon God Transformation

Translator: CKtalon

Crack!

As the two of them spoke, Tsukuyomi took a step back and cracked the stone bricks on the ground.

The moonlight on her body dimmed significantly, but the ghostly aura on Not Heaven’s body intensified. It occupied most of Shinra Temple and continued to suppress the moonlight. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The moonlight on Tsukuyomi’s body was slowly shrinking under the suppression of the ghostly aura, causing Tsukuyomi’s body to involuntarily retreat.

Is Tsukuyomi not his match either? Zhou Wen’s expression changed slightly. He knew that what Ice Maiden had said was true. Not Heaven’s strength was indeed terrifying.

Zhou Wen looked at the antelope. It always acted mysteriously and had unfathomable strength. It was very likely a Calamity-grade existence. If it provided its help, the two Calamities might have a chance of defeating Not Heaven.

However, Zhou Wen nearly exploded from anger. That fellow was standing even further back than he was. He even wanted to use his horns to slam open the door. If not for Shinra Temple’s power imprisoning them here, it would have long fled.

Zhou Wen realized that the antelope wasn’t reliable. It had charged faster than anyone when it sensed benefits ahead. Now that it had discovered danger, it also ran away faster than anyone else.

Seeing Tsukuyomi being increasingly suppressed to the point of slowly retreating, Zhou Wen knew that he had to do something.

He was only willing to use the Immortal Culling Sword as a last resort. The price of using it was too high, and it was very easy for him to be discovered by the dimension.

Asura had defected from the dimension while Zhou Wen’s identity as Human Sovereign was a secret.

Apart from the Immortal Culling Sword, what other powers are useful? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

He had the power of a Terror-grade but the effects of Terror-grade powers were very limited in front of a Calamity-grade.

Although it wasn’t the case that only a Calamity-grade could defeat a Calamity-grade, in front of the overwhelming strength of a Calamity-grade, a Terror-grade had no chance of approaching the other party.

Unless he could break through the Calamity domain and reach Not Heaven, Zhou Wen’s strength was useless against him.

Zhou Wen took in the present situation. Even Tsukuyomi’s Moonlight Domain couldn’t break through Not Heaven’s Calamity Zone, so it was even more impossible for him to rush over with his strength alone.

Since it’s impossible to rush over, is there a way to help Tsukuyomi? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

Although Tsukuyomi’s power isn’t purely spatial, it definitely contains spatial powers. Can I transfer my power to her? It should be of some use, right? What if she’s just lacking a little? Zhou Wen was considering how he could transfer his power to Tsukuyomi.

To transfer one’s strength to others was a special technique—it wasn’t something that could be done just because one wanted to.

Just the transmission of Essence Energy met with many restrictions. If one wasn’t careful, not only would the transmission of Essence Energy fail to help the other party, it might even injure them.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen wanted to transmit spatial powers, making it even more problematic. Zhou Wen had never practiced such techniques in the past. After some thought, he couldn’t come up with a good solution.

The nine Demon Blood True Dragons can freely transmit their powers amongst themselves because their powers are one. As for Tsukuyomi’s power, it isn’t purely spatial. There might be some time or other attributes. If I rashly transmit the power of Clown Mask or Singularity Universe, I’m afraid it won’t be of any help. Instead, it will bring her harm. After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that this idea just wouldn’t work. He had to find another way.

Zhou Wen’s mind raced as he thought about how he could help Tsukuyomi.

Wait... What kind of creature is Tsukuyomi? I wonder if the replication ability of the Demon God Body is effective on her? Zhou Wen had a crazy idea.

The Demon God Body could scan dimensional creatures and turn himself into a dimensional creature. However, typically speaking, it could only turn into a dimensional creature of a lower level or something not much higher.

The difficulty of transforming into a demon was the lowest. It was worse for other races, so transforming into a dimensional creature was more troublesome.

In theory, Tsukuyomi was also a dimensional creature born on Earth. He should be able to scan and replicate her. However, her level was too high. Furthermore, she was most likely not a demon.

It’s not realistic to completely transform into Tsukuyomi, but I can still give it a try. If I can achieve a certain level of assimilation and change my attributes to be like hers, I might be able to transfer my powers to her. Zhou Wen planned on giving it a try.

After being trapped in Fangzhang Mountain for a hundred years, Zhou Wen had done more research on the Demon God Bloodline Catalog. This was because he had a nagging feeling that the restrictions of the Demon God Transformation were too great. If he could lift the restrictions, he might be able to transform into any form at will, like the 72 Transformations in myths.

Zhou Wen had many ideas regarding the Demon God Transformation, but due to his circumstances, they were limited to ideas. He didn’t know which ideas could be realized.

He would just have to give it a try and see how many of those ideas could be realized.

Zhou Wen stood not far behind Tsukuyomi. Now that Tsukuyomi was resisting Not Heaven with all her might, she naturally didn’t have the strength to care about anything else.

Zhou Wen engraved the Demon God Bloodline Catalog on his Wheel of Destiny. At the same time, his body changed. His eyes became abnormally demonic as though they were glowing.

Zhou Wen stared at Tsukuyomi’s figure which reflected onto his eyes.

Soon, Zhou Wen realized that things weren’t as simple as he had imagined. Tsukuyomi’s level was too high, and her vital state was too different from his. The Demon God Body failed to obtain any detailed information while scanning Tsukuyomi’s body. All it gathered was some superficial information.

The information could only change Zhou Wen’s appearance, making him look like Tsukuyomi, but it was useless. It was just a change in appearance that wasn’t much different from an illusion. It had no practical use.

Zhou Wen made a few attempts, but none of them worked. The difference in life’s natural order was too great, so it was impossible for him to scan and replicate it.

Just as Zhou Wen was feeling disappointed, he suddenly realized that the Demon God Eyes had passed through Tsukuyomi’s body and obtained her data. Furthermore, it was extremely detailed.

Zhou Wen immediately understood that Tsukuyomi knew what she was doing and had taken the initiative to open up her body to him. Otherwise, even if she wasn’t guarding against him, it would have been difficult for him to obtain her stats.

Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he circulated the Demon God Bloodline Catalog with all his might. His body gradually changed.

No... It still won’t work... Although I have Tsukuyomi’s data, it’s still too much of a burden for me to replicate such data. Unless the Demon God Bloodline Catalog can improve further... Zhou Wen gritted his teeth and made repeated derivations. He also constantly changed the engravings of the Demon God Bloodline Catalog.

As the engravings deepened, the Demon God Chart that Zhou Wen engraved became even more demonic.
