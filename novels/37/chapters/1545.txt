Chapter 1546: Ancient Snake

Translator: CKtalon

Liz and Leem caught the bread and looked at Zhou Wen in fear. They didn’t know what Zhou Wen had given them.

At Zhou Wen’s gesture, they realized that it was food. When they took a bite, their eyes widened in disbelief.

“Your Devilish Excellency… You… You are too good to us… This is the food of gods and devils, right? You actually rewarded us with the food of gods and devils… Even if we die, we won’t be able to repay your kindness…” Liz and Leem were so touched that tears came to their eyes as they repeatedly thanked him.

How pitiful. They are so touched just from eating bread. If I were to give you two meat buns, wouldn’t you be so touched that your entire family would willingly become servants…?Zhou Wen thought.

“Clean up the cemetery after you are done eating.” Zhou Wen returned to the rocking chair he had taken out and continued grinding.

He wanted to give it another try and see if there was a way to bring people in and out alive. These people had suffered terribly. Zhou Wen really couldn’t bear to exchange their lives for his chance to return home.

“Master, we shall take our leave.” Zhou Wen didn’t notice that Liz and Leem addressed him differently.

They couldn’t bear to eat the bread at all. They carefully put it away before cleaning the cemetery. From time to time, they would steal glances at Zhou Wen, who was lying in the rocking chair, gaming.

To them, everything about Zhou Wen was novel and mysterious.

“How naive. They actually sold their lives for two loaves of bread. What a joke,” Grim Demon said with a twitch of his lips.

“There’s nothing funny about it. It’s the same for you Guardians, much less them,” Zhou Wen said.

“Nonsense. How can I be like them?” Grim Demon was immediately displeased.

“How is it different? To them, bread is something they have never had before. Therefore, they will be touched. To you, the rare items that can enhance your strength will also make you work hard. In essence, they are just rare items. There’s no difference,” Zhou Wen said.

“How can it be the same? It’s completely different, alright?” Grim Demon retorted.

“Then tell me. What’s different?” Zhou Wen asked.

“There are many differences. The value of the items is different, and the effects are different…” Grim Demon retorted.

Zhou Wen ignored Grim Demon and continued gaming.

“Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you faking death just because you can’t win the argument? Speak!” Grim Demon circled around Zhou Wen, but Zhou Wen ignored him. He was so anxious that he flew into a rage.

Zhou Wen treated him as air and ignored him.

Grim Demon kept talking in a huff; if he hadn’t realized that he couldn’t beat Zhou Wen, he would have long slapped him.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen frowned and looked up at the sky above the mountain city.

“You worms actually dare to kill my race’s living beings. I originally wanted to raise you as food, but now that you have a death wish, all of you can die.” A sharp and strange eunuch-like voice sounded. On the mountain peak behind Regretless City was a huge red snake. Its body was coiled around the mountain, and its huge head was hanging above Regretless City as it occasionally flicked its tongue.

The snake was massive. Just its head was about half the size of Regretless City.

The humans in the city were alarmed and many of them collapsed to the ground in fright. Such a huge snake only needed one mouthful to devour them all. Running was futile.

“Not good. Why is this fellow here!” Grim Demon was alarmed when he saw the huge snake. He called out to Zhou Wen, hoping to get him to escape.

Grim Demon had previously encountered this huge snake and nearly failed to return.

“Master… Please save our clansmen…” Liz and Leem rushed over and repeatedly kowtowed to Zhou Wen.

“I’ll give you a chance now. You worm-like creatures have no ability to kill my race. Tell me, who killed it? Today, I can spare half of you. I’ll only eat half.” The snake’s voice sounded again.

Everyone was even more alarmed. The snake imagined that these humans would quickly yield and tell it who had killed the ancient snake.

However, although everyone was trembling, no one exposed the culprit. All of them knelt on the ground and prayed in Zhou Wen’s direction as they muttered something about the Devil King.

“It looks like none of you wish to live.” The snake was enraged. It opened its mouth and was about to devour a portion of the humans. They would naturally speak once they felt fear.

However, before the snake could exert its strength, it heard a voice say: “I killed that snake.”

The snake stopped and looked down at the source of the sound.

A human stood on the roof of a stone building. The voice had come from that human.

“A mere human actually dares to lie in front of me. You do seem to have a death wish, and I’ll fulfill your wish,” the snake said as it sucked at Zhou Wen.

A huge suction force sucked everything near Zhou Wen into the snake’s mouth like a tornado.

Liz, Leem, and the nearby humans were swept into the air as they screamed while flying towards the snake’s mouth.

“Master!” Liz and Leem were still shouting, while the others were calling ‘Devil King.’

At this moment, no one exposed Zhou Wen. It was obvious that their fear of the Devil King was above the huge snake.

Zhou Wen extended his hand and beckoned. The Golden Wyrm Scissors transformed into a golden beam of light that slashed at the snake.

The snake never expected a human to have such powerful strength. It was too late by the time it saw the Golden Wyrm Scissors.

Blood spewed out from the snake’s body as it opened its mouth to bite at the Golden Wyrm Scissors, hoping to swallow it.

However, the Golden Wyrm Scissors sliced the snake’s head into two. The blood in the snake’s body immediately flowed down the mountain like a waterfall. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Boom!

The snake’s body also plummeted, just seconds away from crashing into the city.

The snake’s body was even bigger than Regretless City. If it was hit, the entire city would probably be destroyed.

Roar! Tyrant Behemoth was summoned by Zhou Wen. Its huge body stood at the foot of the mountain as it held the snake’s body with its claws, preventing it from falling.

“Long live the Devil King…” The City Lord led everyone to kneel in Zhou Wen’s direction. They naturally regarded Tyrant Behemoth as a devil summoned by Zhou Wen.

From their point of view, as long as the Devil King was in the city, they wouldn’t have to worry about the threat of dimensional creatures in the future. How could there be an existence stronger than the Devil King in the world?

“Master!” Liz and Leem’s eyes glistened as they knelt there and looked at Zhou Wen with adulation.
