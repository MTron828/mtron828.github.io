Chapter 229 Yin Yang World

Zhou Wen charged forward as he constantly punched out with his fists, but he could only send two or three ghosts retreating.

Seeing more and more ghosts surrounding them, Zhou Wen and company were unable to move far. They were trapped in their spots. Zhou Wen summoned Banana Fairy and sent a gust of Grand Yin Wind at the ghosts ahead of them.

A strong gust of wind blew past, instantly blowing away the large group of ghosts ahead. However, after the ghosts were blown away, they quickly lunged forward again, not suffering too much damage.

Zhou Wen immediately understood that the power of the Grand Yin Wind was an Yin-elemental wind. As for ghosts, they were of an extreme Yin nature. The wind attribute of the Grand Yin Wind was effective against them, but the Yin attribute wasn’t of much use. All he could do was send them flying, but he couldn’t freeze them.

It’s good enough to send them flying. Zhou Wen gritted his teeth as he charged forward. His Dao body quickly recovered his Primordial Energy, and once he did that, he would fan the back.

Li Xuan blocked most of the ghosts in the rear, but the wounds on his body kept increasing. With Zhou Wen’s fanning, a large number of the ghosts behind them were sent flying, giving Li Xuan some breathing space.

Zhou Wen summoned the Three-Eyed Golden Warrior, the Saber Shield Knight, Demonized General, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, and the Mutated Lotus Flower Ant, but the effects weren’t that great.

Among them, only the Golden Warrior’s Golden Palm did significant damage to the ghosts. The damage dealt to the ghosts by the other pets’ attacks was very limited and was of not much use.

Soon, Zhou Wen unsummoned them. This was the real world. They died permanently here with no way to revive them. These were excellent-grade Companion Beasts that Zhou Wen had; he couldn’t bear to send them to their deaths.

Zhou Wen summoned the Ghost Bride and saw her figure move erratically. Wherever the pale-white hands with red nails touched, a ghost’s head would be pierced through by her claws. Then, the ghost would be absorbed by her palm, turning her nails even redder like blood.

The Ghost Bride’s wanton killing was much more efficient than Zhou Wen’s. She shared the burden for the four of them.

With the aid of the Banana Fairy, Truth Listener, and Ghost Bride, Zhou Wen and company finally arrived at a spot not far from the Yin Yang Boundary Stone.

From time to time, earth-shattering explosions could be heard from afar, making Zhou Wen and company feel much more at ease. At least they knew that An Sheng was still battling the black-armored, white-haired ghost-he hadn’t been killed.

However, they were also in a daze. An Sheng only wanted them to rush back, but he didn’t tell them what to do. Now that they were about to reach the Yin Yang Boundary Stone, were they to cross it?

There was no way out after being chased by ghosts. If they entered the netherworld again, it could only be worse.

Zhou Wen, who was at the forefront, couldn’t help but look in the direction of the Yin Yang Boundary Stone. When he saw it, his pupils immediately constricted as though he had seen an extremely terrifying scene. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Holy sh*t!” Li Xuan also looked in the direction of the Boundary Stone and immediately exclaimed when he saw it.

Behind the Boundary Stone was a group of red-dressed female ghosts. Their numbers were in no way lesser than the white-robed ghosts they were facing. At that moment, they were behind the Boundary Stone like a sea of red flowers.

However, the red-dressed female ghosts were somewhat different from Zhou Wen’s Ghost Bride. Although they were dressed in red, they were only dressed in ordinary red robes. They weren’t bridal gowns, nor were there red veils that covered their faces. Their faces could be seen.

The female ghosts didn’t look ugly and were actually rather pretty. However, their faces were pale and looked ghastly. Their fingernails were long and sharp. Although they didn’t look ugly, they appeared extremely frightening.

“Out of the frying pan and into the fire. We are really in big trouble this time,” Li Xuan cried out loudly. His Immortal God of Combat Life Providence and the Invincible Connate Divine Art made him nearly immortal as long as he wasn’t immediately slain. But even so, such a crazy battle was a huge burden on him.

Zhou Wen was also secretly lamenting. The white-robed ghosts had the black-armored, white-haired ghost that even An Sheng was not necessarily able to beat. They definitely couldn’t escape in that direction.

However, the red-dressed female ghosts weren’t to be trifled with either. Furthermore, after entering the dimensional zone, who knew what else was there. Perhaps, there was a large number of black-armored, white-haired ghosts inside. If they charged in, they would only end up dead.

Instantly, the four fell into a dilemma. They could neither advance nor retreat, and could only fight the white-robed ghosts with all their might.

However, there was no way to continue fighting like this. Humans didn’t have inexhaustible stamina. The Dao Body could recover Zhou Wen’s Primordial Energy, but it was impossible for it to completely recover his stamina. Zhou Wen was already beginning to feel exhausted, and he had no idea how long he could last.

Li Xuan’s and Ah Lai’s situation wasn’t any better. The depletion of their stamina wasn’t any less than Zhou Wen’s. Zhang Yuzhi was the worst. She limped as she barely managed to fight. She had already suffered quite a few injuries.

If not for Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Ah Lai taking care of her occasionally, she would have long been killed by the ghosts.

“It’s not a solution if this goes on. Instead of dying so pathetically, why don’t we charge back and kill the black-armored, white-haired ghost with Brother Sheng? If we succeed, we can successfully escape. Even if we don’t succeed, we’ll just die gloriously in battle. It’s better than dying here because of being overwhelmed,” Li Xuan said.

Zhou Wen scanned his surroundings and suddenly said, “Don’t go back yet. Let’s approach the Yin Yang Boundary Stone a little closer.”

With that said, Zhou Wen had already used the Grand Yin Wind to lead the way as he charged towards the red-dressed female ghosts. However, his Grand Yin Wind was only used to fan the white-robed ghosts away; he didn’t attack the red-dressed female ghosts.

Although they did not know what Zhou Wen was up to, Li Xuan and Ah Lai followed without any hesitation. Soon, they arrived in front of the Boundary Stone.

At that moment, they discovered a strange scene. None of the red-dressed female ghosts standing behind the Boundary Stone charged over.

As for the white-robed ghosts, none of them came close to the Yin Yang Boundary Stone. They gathered on the other side of the Boundary Stone as they bared their fangs and brandished their claws at Zhou Wen and

company.

The white-robed ghosts and the red-dressed female ghosts looked at each other across the Boundary Stone. The ghosts on both sides were eyeing Zhou Wen and company covetously, but none of them charged forward. It made the four who were trapped around the Boundary Stone feel alarmed yet relieved.

After fighting for so long, the four of them were exhausted. They leaned close towards the Yin Yang Boundary Stone but were unable to rest. The white-robed ghosts and red-dressed female ghosts on both sides were less than a meter away from them. The terrifying ghastly claws that were waving around seemed to be able to pierce a few holes into their bodies at any moment.

“Old Zhou, are we saved now?” Li Xuan said with a sullen expression as he looked at the ghastly claw waving in front of him.

“The food and drinks are all in the car. We are trapped here. Even if these ghosts don’t harm us, we won’t be able to live for long. Do you think we are saved?” Zhou Wen sized up the Yin Yang Boundary Stone. He hoped that he could find a way out.

However, beyond that was ghastly and terrifying. Fog was everywhere, making it impossible to see what was inside.

Suddenly, the potent collisions in the distance vanished as the night turned silent. It made Zhou Wen and company feel their hearts in their throats.

“Did Brother Sheng win?” Li Xuan swallowed his saliva with great difficulty. If An Sheng didn’t win, he probably had been harmed by the black-armored, white-haired ghost. This also spelled doom for them.

Their gazes were fixed on the road. Soon, Zhou Wen and company’s expressions became extremely nasty. They saw the black-armored, white-haired ghost fly over in the sky, its head of white hair fluttering in the wind, like a devil coming into this world.
