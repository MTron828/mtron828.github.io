Chapter 1761 Two Options

Zhou Wen stared into the void. In fact, he couldn’t see anything. What he was really looking at was the Sigh of the King Life Providence, or rather, the woman that only existed in it.

With Zhou Wen’s strength, he was indeed unable to withstand the Nameless God’s psychic powers. It was the power of the Sigh of the King that resisted the terrifying psychic power. How could an existence that had once stood at the peak of power and had all races submit to her tolerate kneeling to others? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Others couldn’t see it, nor could Zhou Wen, but he could sense that a woman’s phantom seemed to overlap with his body. She was staring into the void as though she was looking at something.

“Zhou Wen, are you afraid?” A woman’s voice sounded in Zhou Wen’s mind. The voice was clearly beautiful, but it had an indescribable authority. It was difficult to associate it with the word pleasant.

“What’s there to be afraid of?” Zhou Wen didn’t say a word, but only thought of the sentence. It was enough for the owner of the voice to know what Zhou Wen was talking about.

“The owner of this psyche is an extremely powerful existence. Even the leaders of the six races can’t match it. A thought is all it needs to kill you,” the woman continued.

“What are you?” Zhou Wen didn’t answer the question of fear. He wanted to know what kind of existence the woman in his Life Providence was.

In the past, he had felt that there was something wrong with his Life Providence. Now that it could actually speak to him, it made him even more uneasy.

There was actually another consciousness in his body. It knew everything about him and even knew what he was thinking. This made him feel like he was naked in front of a stranger without any sense of security.

“I’m you.” The woman’s answer left Zhou Wen somewhat confused, unsure what she meant.

The woman didn’t continue answering Zhou Wen’s doubts. Instead, she continued, “That existence is extremely terrifying. Ignoring Earth, even in the dimension, it’s a supreme existence. Getting his contractor to kneel in front of you is equivalent to insulting him. He definitely won’t let you live. Are you afraid?”

“Yes.” Zhou Wen was indeed afraid. Anyone who was targeted by an existence that could kill them with a thought would be so afraid that they would be unable to eat or sleep. There was no reason to hide the truth. Furthermore, he couldn’t hide it from the woman who knew what he was thinking.

“Although that existence is extremely terrifying, he has a fatal weakness. Without a contractor, he can’t leave the dimension, nor can he sense the information on Earth. Now, you have two choices. One is to kill the girl in front of you. As long as you kill her, the existence will no longer be able to sense the information inside Earth due to the suppression of Earth’s rules. Naturally, it won’t be able to kill you with its psyche,” the woman said.

“What’s the second option?” Zhou Wen asked. “The second option is naturally not to kill the girl. I can temporarily screen his psyche from locking onto you,” the woman added.

“It sounds like the first option is easier.” Zhou Wen changed the topic and continued, “You seem to have something to say.”

“That existence isn’t a creature, or rather, it’s not entirely a creature. He should be a weapon,” the woman said slowly. “It’s not a weapon in the traditional sense, but something similar to what you humans call a Companion Beast. It’s a weapon with its own life and consciousness.

“But no matter what kind of weapon he is, as long as he’s a weapon, a host has to use him. However, a weapon like him has extremely harsh requirements for the host. It’s almost impossible to find another existence like the girl in the dimension.”

“In that case, as long as I kill her, I can settle it once and for all?” Zhou Wen pondered.

“At the very least, it’s impossible for an existence like the girl to appear in a short period of time. Even if such an existence appears in the future, it will be countless years later. With the lifespan of humans, I’m afraid you won’t be able to live to that day. To you, it’s considered a done deal,” the woman said indifferently.

“In that case, why did you mention the second option? This second option shouldn’t be as simple as you say, right?” Zhou Wen said in thought.

“If the girl can live, she can truly use that weapon and liberate it after advancing to the Apocalypse grade. Only then will you have a chance to snatch it.”

“How?”

“Lost Immortal Sutra… With the Lost Immortal Sutra, as long as you defeat the girl with that weapon, you might be able to snatch it for your own use. However, this is very dangerous. The girl’s talent far exceeds yours. After advancing to the Apocalypse grade, she will be an extremely powerful existence. With the power of that weapon, no one in the dimension can match her. If you want to defeat her and snatch that weapon, it’s almost equivalent to courting death.”

“In that case, why should I snatch it?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Because Earth doesn’t have time left.” The woman continued, “The reason he can send his psyche to Earth to kill you is partly because he’s extremely powerful and has a contractor providing positioning here. However, ultimately, it’s because the restrictions on Earth are already very weak. In a few years, the extremely terrifying existences in the dimension will descend to Earth. When that happens, even if humans aren’t wiped out, they will probably be reduced to slaves. Only by obtaining that weapon can you storm into the dimension and suppress all races, preventing the ill fate of human extermination.”

“What you said is contradictory. If I can defeat the girl with that weapon, do I still need that weapon?” Zhou Wen could tell that something was amiss.

“It’s not contradictory. You only have one chance, and that is to enter the dimension. When she advances to the Apocalypse grade and obtains that weapon, you can use the short period she needs to break into the weapon to sneak an attack and defeat her while she can’t completely unleash the weapon’s might. No matter how powerful the weapon is, it ultimately needs a host to use it,” the woman said indifferently. “However, it’s too difficult. You have to enter the dimension alone and find the girl while she liberates the weapon. You also have to defeat a powerhouse that’s almost at the peak of the Apocalypse grade. It can be said it’s an ending that spells almost certain doom.”

“There’s no chance of survival. Since there’s no chance, why should I take this path?” Zhou Wen frowned.

“Of course, you can choose not to. With your abilities, even if Earth completely breaks out of its seal, you might be able to find a place to hide in the universe. Life-preservation shouldn’t be a problem,” the woman said indifferently. “You can live by taking the first option. The second option is to give you and humanity a miracle. It’s up to you how you choose.”
