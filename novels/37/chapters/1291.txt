Chapter 1292: Battle Against Immortal

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen’s Heart Defying Sword followed his true desires. It wasn’t limited to one concept. People wouldn’t be able to recognize it even when he delivered a random strike.

At that moment, the sword intent Zhou Wen used was like a surging river. When he stabbed out, the subsequent sword combos were endless. With the Singularity Universe’s spatial power pinpointing Immortal, Immortal’s spatial distortion lost its effect. All he could do was fight Zhou Wen head-on.

Immortal’s movement technique was also extremely amazing. The seemingly unintentional subtle movement seemed to contain many unexpected and magical aspects, preventing Zhou Wen from touching him.

The sword missed again. With a thought, Zhou Wen threw the Son of Heaven’s Sword out of his hand.

Immortal dodged the strike and had already arrived at a spot that made it difficult to dodge another. Seeing the sudden appearance of the Son of Heaven’s Sword, he had no time to dodge. All he could do was extend his hand and slap the Son of Heaven’s Sword.

Just as Immortal’s palm was about to slap the Son of Heaven’s Sword, the sword suddenly transformed into Zhou Wen. Zhou Wen struck out at Immortal’s palm as his other hand clenched into a fist that struck at his waist.

Bang! Bang!

Zhou Wen’s palm clashed with Immortal’s palm as his fist was blocked by Immortal’s other hand, producing a dull thud.

Zhou Wen felt as though his fist and palm had struck a resilient rubber ball and his strength was sharply reduced.

On careful look, Zhou Wen realized that his palm and fist hadn’t touched Immortal’s body. The halo, which resembled a god’s protection, had blocked Zhou Wen’s punch and completely dispelled the powerful punch like a spring.

Zhou Wen’s hands didn’t stop as they turned into a barrage of attacks that he constantly threw at Immortal.

Although the halo over Immortal’s body could withstand Zhou Wen’s punches, Immortal continued blocking Zhou Wen’s moves. He didn’t let down his guard.

Pa!

Zhou Wen only attacked without defending. He attacked crazily as though he was punching a sandbag, pouring all his strength into Immortal.

When the average person watched this, it was as though Zhou Wen had the upper hand, suppressing Immortal and forcing him to retreat repeatedly. They were alarmed by how powerful Looter King was.

However, the true experts among humans wore looks of puzzlement. Although Zhou Wen’s attacks were ferocious, he had too many flaws because he had abandoned defense and focused on the offense.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen couldn’t really break through Immortal’s defense. As long as Immortal ignored Zhou Wen’s attack and targeted his weakness in a counterattack, Zhou Wen would definitely be in a tragic state.

However, Immortal didn’t counterattack. He continued defending with an airtight defense.

“What are these two doing? One is attacking with all his might, while the other is defending with all his might.” Xia Xuanyue looked at Xia Liuchuan and asked in puzzlement.

She also felt that Looter King was in a very disadvantageous situation, but for some reason, Immortal didn’t counterattack.

Xia Liuchuan said, “Any counterattack from Immortal is built on the fact that Looter King can’t break through his defense, but Looter King has been deliberately showing him his flaws as though he’s telling him, ‘Come on, hit me. I’ve a hidden skill that can break through your defense.’ This way, Immortal won’t dare to act rashly.”

“Then, can Looter King break through Immortal’s defense?” Xia Xuanyue asked.

“Who knows? Perhaps he can. Perhaps he’s just bluffing. Apart from Looter King himself, I’m afraid no one knows,” Xia Liuchuan said as he spread out his hands.

The duo was very patient. Immortal was really like an otherworldly immortal. No matter how Zhou Wen seduced him or revealed flaws, he didn’t counterattack or give Zhou Wen any chance.

Zhou Wen was even worse. If Immortal didn’t counterattack, he would go all in when it came to offense and expose more flaws.

In the eyes of the average person, Zhou Wen was like a demonic god that had descended to the mortal world. He suppressed Immortal and beat him back repeatedly.

“Looter King is amazing. He has completely suppressed Lord Immortal.”

“The virtue is one foot tall, the devil ten feet. Immortal is still not as powerful as the devil.”

“Looter King should be a human. What has he got to do with devils?”

“We can’t see his true appearance. Who knows if he’s pure human. Even if he is a pure human, with his actions, he can be considered a devil. It’s not too much to call him a devil.”

“Speaking of which, the nickname ‘Looter King’ doesn’t seem to suit him. In the past, I only felt that he was picking up scraps, but from the looks of it, he’s terrifyingly powerful. Even Lord Immortal is being suppressed by him. Such strength is basically invincible on Earth, right?”

“The words ‘Looter King’ are indeed a little inappropriate.”

“But this fellow’s actions don’t make him appear like a proper person. Titles like god or saint don’t seem to suit him.”

Everyone discussed spiritedly. Zhou Wen’s domineering performance broadened the horizons of the average person.

Seeing how the godlike Immortal—who had crushed the Holy Spirit Association—was being suppressed by Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen’s standing in everyone’s hearts seemed to elevate.

However, his previous actions made it impossible for people to respect him like Human Sovereign.

The host and Professor Gu, who were livestreaming, were also discussing this problem. Professor Gu said, “This person is indeed very strong. He doesn’t rely on luck, but his thoughts are a little different from ordinary people. It’s quite odd. To call him Looter King is definitely wrong. He relies on true talent, but to call him a god or saint doesn’t seem right either.”

After a moment of silence, Professor Gu added, “His style of doing things is somewhat similar to Thief Sage. Why don’t we call him Deceit Sage in the future?”

“Deceit Sage? This name sounds a little indecent,” the host said with a bitter smile. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“A deceptive person might not be a thief. Those who steal the hearts of others and plunder countries are considered deceptive. Since ancient times, there have been instances of decent deception. Although this person can’t be described as decent, it shouldn’t be too much to call him a deceptive person, right?” Professor Gu said with a smile.

The host muttered, “His actions don’t seem to match a sage’s. He’s more like a Deceit King.”

Unexpectedly, Deceit King quickly became popular and became a new nickname that Zhou Wen was widely known as.

As everyone spoke, something finally changed on the battlefield. Under Zhou Wen’s constant pressure, Immortal finally attacked a flaw that Zhou Wen revealed.

The flaw was too great. Immortal’s hand reached at Zhou Wen’s abdomen in an incredulous manner. It was like a straight knife that wanted to stab into his abdomen and rip it open.

As for Zhou Wen, he had no intention of retreating or defending. In fact, it was too late to defend. He had used too much force in his attacks.

Zhou Wen’s palm struck Immortal’s head at the same time, hoping to shatter it. It was as though he was determined to succeed with that single strike.

Zhou Wen was ultimately one step behind. Immortal’s palm was about to pierce through his abdomen—even if Zhou Wen had the ability to break through Immortal’s defense, it was probably useless.

Just as Immortal’s finger was about to touch Zhou Wen, Zhou Wen’s body transformed into the Son of Heaven’s Sword. As for Zhou Wen, he appeared where the Son of Heaven’s Sword was.

Immortal’s reaction was extremely fast. Just as his finger was about to collide with the tip of the sword, he changed from stabbing to grabbing and grabbed the Son of Heaven’s Sword.

However, when he grabbed something firm, he realized that he was grabbing Zhou Wen’s arm. The Son of Heaven’s Sword had vanished again.

Zhou Wen’s other palm struck Immortal’s head. At this close distance, Immortal couldn’t dodge in time and was struck in the head.

However, at that moment, Immortal revealed a strange smile.
