Chapter 571 An Sheng“s Arrival

Groups of Poison Bats flew over. With Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World, large swaths of Poison Bats and a White Shadow of Poison were reflected into the Vision World, disappearing in the blink of an eye. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The large number of Poison Bats in the cave vanished without a trace.

As expected! Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t look good. This was because at least two hundred Poison Bats had been sucked into the Vision World. They were nowhere to be seen, with no corpses indicating their deaths. The key point was that the game constantly indicated that the Poison Bat had been killed, but nothing dropped.

This was a very troublesome problem. The dimensional creatures that were sucked into the Bright Torch Vision World wouldn’t drop anything, or they might have dropped something, only to have them vanish in the Vision World.

If it doesn’t drop, so be it. Zhou Wen didn’t feel overly conflicted. This time, he took the Torch Dragon to the Qiongqi temple.

Qiongqi was very powerful and Zhou Wen was no match for it with the Six-Winged Golden Battle God Halberd and the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General that restrained it. However, Qiongqi was no match for Torch Dragon Youngling.

The trouble was—Qiongqi’s speed was too fast—allowing it to constantly avoid Torch Dragon’s vision. However, by unleashing World King Transformation, Qiongqi had nowhere to run. It was directly sucked into the Vision World and instantly killed.

Unfortunately, the Bright Torch Vision World prevented anything from dropping despite killing Qiongqi.

From the looks of it, it won’t be a problem to use Torch Dragon to kill Qiongqi. Zhou Wen was rather satisfied with the outcome. It didn’t matter if anything dropped. As long as he could kill Qiongqi, he could enter the Qiongqi Temple.

If they couldn’t find the former principal in the Qiongqi temple, it meant that he had most likely been killed.

In fact, after discovering the metal piece, Zhou Wen already felt that the former principal and company had gone to the Torch Dragon temple. The chances of them heading to Qiongqi temple were relatively low.

As for why he didn’t discover the former principal and company’s relics, Zhou Wen felt that they might have been sucked into the Bright Torch Vision World, so nothing remained.

Only the metal piece had been left behind for some reason. Or perhaps it was originally something from the temple—the former principal and the others had merely discovered it.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush to head to the Qiongqi temple. An Sheng said that he would head over in the next two days, so he planned on waiting for him.

After all, with Torch Dragon around, killing Qiongqi wasn’t too risky. It was fine to wait for An Sheng.

Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed when he took the Torch Dragon with him to grind the Torch Dragon. If Torch Dragon used Bright Torch Vision World, he wouldn’t obtain any benefits even if he killed Torch Dragon.

However, he wasn’t a match for Torch Dragon in the temple without using Bright Torch Vision World. He would still be killed instantly by the Bright Torch Vision World, so Zhou Wen had no choice but to use the old method to kill the Torch Dragon.

When Torch Dragon appeared in his companion form, it gave Zhou Wen a pleasant surprise.

Torch Dragon’s Companion Form was similar to contact lenses. It directly appeared in Zhou Wen’s left eye. Under such circumstances, Zhou Wen’s left eye could also use Bright Torch Vision World.

Although it drained him greatly, it wasn’t a problem for Zhou Wen who had infinite Essence Energy.

Unfortunately, this move can only be used to kill enemies, but it can’t drop dimensional crystals or Companion Eggs. Zhou Wen planned on using Torch Dragon as his trump card. He could also use it when grinding Mythical creatures, but without using the Bright Torch Vision World and World King Transformation, its combat strength was only slightly stronger than the Six-Winged Guardian Dragon.

An Sheng arrived very quickly. Zhou Wen didn’t even wait two days before An Sheng arrived at the encampment.

Zhou Wen told An Sheng about hatching the Torch Dragon Youngling and found an uninhabited place. There, he demonstrated Torch Dragon’s abilities to him, telling him that he could kill Qiongqi with Torch Dragon.

“This Torch Dragon Youngling is practically invincible. It’s very likely to be first on the rankings. However, I have to do something before we kill Qiongqi,” An Sheng said.

“Is it related to the blood offerings?” Zhou Wen guessed.

An Sheng nodded slightly. “I’m constantly updated by the news over here. I’ve roughly guessed who it is. If I don’t deal with this fellow now, I’m afraid something will happen in the future. Let’s head to the temple and settle this matter.”

Zhou Wen entered the temple with An Sheng. Everyone related to the blood offerings was there.

When Professor Lei saw Zhou Wen and An Sheng, he came over and said excitedly, “Young Master Wen, Adjutant An, our research has made quite a bit of progress recently. From the murals and statues inside the Torch Dragon Temple, that palace should be related to the Mythical Chiyou...”

“Professor Lei, report the details to the Overseer in the future. Please gather everyone. I have something to say,” An Sheng said.

“Alright, Little Zhao, call everyone over,” Professor Lei said to one of his students.

Soon, the student called everyone over. When everyone was present, Professor Lei frowned and asked, “Where’s Qingyun?”

“Senior Brother Qu was a little unwell yesterday and had been resting in the tent. When I called him just now, he seemed to be very sick. He was a little muddle-headed and didn’t wake up,” Little Zhao said.

“In that case, I’ll get him.” An Sheng seemed to realize something as he quickly walked towards Qu Qingyun’s tent.

Everyone followed him. An Sheng pulled open the tent and saw Qu Qingyun sleeping inside with the blanket wrapped around him. His body seemed to be trembling like a patient suffering from a severe cold.

An Sheng walked over and reached out to pull the blanket away. He saw Qu Qingyun curled up into a ball as his body trembled.

“Qingyun, what’s wrong?” Professor Lei saw that Qu Qingyun seemed to be seriously ill and wanted to go up to check on him.

However, An Sheng stopped Professor Lei and pulled out a flying dagger before throwing it at Qu Qingyun.

The flying dagger instantly stabbed into Qu Qingyun’s body. With a bang, a white fog erupted from the body. After the white fog dissipated, they saw the dagger nailing the corpse of a fox to the ground.

“What’s going on?” Professor Lei and the others were dumbfounded.

“Adjutant An, I’ll lead my men to chase after him.” Lu Yunxian’s expression changed. Qu Qingyun slept in the same tent as him, but he had actually failed to notice anything amiss.

“There’s no need. This person isn’t simple. Furthermore, the terrain in the ruins is too difficult. It’s easy for accidents to happen. Watch the vicinity of the temple and investigate the important areas. Don’t let him have another chance,” An Sheng said.

“Yes.” Lu Yunxian went to make arrangements.

The matter was already very clear. Even Professor Lei and the rest had guessed that there must be something wrong with Qu Qingyun’s sudden disappearance and him playing such a trick. It probably had something to do with the blood offerings.

“Adjutant An, I really didn’t expect Qingyun to do such a thing...” Professor Lei said in embarrassment.

“Professor Lei, don’t blame yourself. Everyone has cavities in their teeth. You weren’t to know.” Having settled the matter, An Sheng headed to the Qiongqi temple with Zhou Wen.
