Chapter 1374: Classic of Mountains and Seas Mutated Beasts

More than a hundred devil-like Terror-grade creatures swept over as though they had a blood feud with Zhou Wen. They wished they could chew him up.

Zhou Wen summoned the Prisoned Dragon armor. He quickly instant transmitted, but he only managed to dodge a portion of the attacks. Many attacks still landed on him.

Thankfully, Absolute Defense was indeed powerful. It fended off many fatal attacks and even reflected damage, sending a few devil-like blood shadows flying.

Banana Fairy waved the banana fan in her hand and used Chaos Wind to form countless tornadoes, sweeping up all the forces and blood shadows that approached her.

One of the bird-shaped blood shadows stood out by moving against the wind, unafraid of Banana Fairy’s Chaos Wind. It tore through the tornadoes that filled the sky and arrived near Banana Fairy. It spread its wings and blood beams shot at Banana Fairy like a rain of arrows.

Banana Fairy rode the wind and used the banana fan in her hand as a weapon. She blocked all the sanguine light that approached her and fought the blood shadow that resembled a giant bird.

However, she had clearly met her nemesis. The giant bird seemed to be born with the ability to fix the wind. Be it the Supreme Yang Wind, Supreme Yin Wind, or Chaos Wind, they would immediately stop the moment they reached the giant bird.

Zhou Wen used the Prisoned Dragon armor’s defense to constantly set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, but before the invisible sword beams he set up could stabilize, they were shattered by the overwhelming power. He was unable to form a sword array.

Seeing that setting up the sword array was not going to work, Zhou Wen was just about to go all out when he heard a strange cry that resembled a bull or dragon. Before he could react, the blood-colored avatar’s eardrums ruptured before its entire body exploded, turning into a bloody mist.

Calamity-grade creature!?Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It wasn’t unexpected that there was a Calamity-grade creature in Yang City. However, he didn’t even see what the Calamity-grade creature was before he was killed by the sound. He was truly displeased.

He wanted to enter again, but the notification indicated that he had to wait 24 hours.

Since he couldn’t enter, Zhou Wen used his memories to search for information online. Soon, he realized that the blood shadows he saw in Yang City seemed to be extremely similar to some creatures in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

Take the blood shadow that appeared in the beginning for instance, it was very similar to the Whirl Turtle in the Classic of Mountains and Seas. The other blood shadows also had inklings of the mutated beasts in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

Could it be that the blood bone temples in Yang City are built with the bones of the mutated beasts in the Classic of Mountains and Seas??The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that he was right.

Back then, Yu the Great had controlled the waters, splitting mountains and rivers along the way. He had killed countless flood beasts. If there was anyone who was qualified to build such a city, it was probably only Yu the Great.

When Zhou Wen thought of this, he was alarmed and delighted. He was delighted that he would definitely gain a lot from grinding Terror-grade Companion Beasts and dimensional crystals in such a treasure land in the future.

What was shocking was that if a Calamity-grade creature was about to appear in Yang City, it wouldn’t be easy to defend Luoyang.

Is there no safe place in the world that can let me game in peace??Zhou Wen sighed before throwing himself into grinding work again.

Unfortunately, there were many places that Zhou Wen wanted to grind, but he didn’t have the ability to clear them.

For example, he could grind the first part of the Venusian instance dungeon and Chess Mountain, but he would die when he reached the end.

Zhou Wen had previously attempted to kill the Ant City Guardian, but ended up being killed. The growth of the Ant City Guardian had probably placed it at the Calamity grade, making it seem to be faster than Zhou Wen.

Once, when Zhou Wen really didn’t have any dungeons to grind, he ran to Mount Laojun. After entering Mount Laojun’s Golden Peak, he saw an immortal crane that ignored him.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t there to sightsee, so it was naturally impossible for him to just take a look. He went up to kill the immortal crane, but he was killed on the spot by a single wing. The game screen instantly turned black.

This can’t continue. I have to think of a way to kill a Calamity-grade Companion Beast. As long as I kill them enough times, a Calamity-grade Companion Beast will drop no matter what. A Calamity-grade Companion Beast makes everything easy.

?Zhou Wen really wanted to count on Truth Listener, but it had been in the form of an earring all this while. He couldn’t summon it no matter what.

Zhou Wen planned on thinking of a way to kill a Calamity-grade in-game after this trip to the League of Guardians.

From the looks of it, the Calamity-grade he had highest hopes of killing was the one on Venus.

The Calamity-grade’s offensive strength was indeed very strong. The seventh shot was almost a sure kill.

However, his weakness was obvious. His offensive abilities were single-target. Also, his defense was definitely mediocre, and his melee abilities were lacking. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have hidden the entire time.

Up to now, no one had seen what he looked like.

As long as one could deal with his bullets, killing him probably wasn’t difficult after finding him.

Zhou Wen had more or less finished his research on the infinite spatial circulation skill. The progress was very smooth. He believed that it wouldn’t be long before he could withstand the Calamity-grade bullets. When that happened, he would have the confidence to kill the Calamity creature.

Sweetie was rather curious about everything on Earth. She found everything fresh and fun, so she didn’t find it boring.

Finally, they arrived near the League of Guardians. Zhou Wen tried his best to hide his whereabouts and planned on secretly approaching the League of Guardians to set up his Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.

However, with Sweetie by his side, it wasn’t that easy for him to hide.

“Shall we play a game?” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said to Sweetie.

“I’m not a child. Why are we playing games?” Sweetie immediately followed up with a question. “What game do you have in mind?”

“Let’s play hide-and-seek. The two of us will hide ourselves. Whoever gets discovered first loses,” Zhou Wen said.

Sweetie rolled her eyes at him. “Are you afraid of being discovered when attempting something evil?”

“Wow, you actually saw through me. Alright, I can only tell you the truth. I’m actually here to find treasure,” Zhou Wen whispered to Sweetie.

“What treasure?” Sweetie’s eyes lit up as though she was interested.

“In the city over there, there’s a group of villains known as the Forty Great Bandits. They pillage everywhere and gather many treasures, hiding them somewhere in the city. I came here this time to find the treasure of the Forty Great Bandits and distribute it to good people who need it,” Zhou Wen said in all seriousness.

“You want it for yourself, right?” Sweetie seemed to see through Zhou Wen’s thoughts.

“That’s not important. What’s important is to punish those bad people.” Zhou Wen wore a righteous expression as though he was a modern version of Justice Bao.

Noticing Sweetie’s hesitance, Zhou Wen hurriedly added, “With so many treasures, even if most of them are distributed to good people who need them, one-thousandth of the remaining can buy a few plum blossom cake shops.”
