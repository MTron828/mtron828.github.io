Chapter 1530: Eat Me If You Want To Eat

Translator: CKtalon

Humans! There are humans there??Zhou Wen saw humans in the city from afar. Furthermore, there were quite a number of them.

Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to carefully scan the area a few more times. After confirming that the other party were humans and not humanoid dimensional creatures, he looked at Grim Demon and asked, “Grim Demon, are you sure this is the dimension’s Land of the Fallen?”

“Well…” Grim Demon was originally very certain, but he became somewhat unsure upon seeing the humans in the city.

The creatures that could survive in the dimension were at least at the Mythical stage. How many Mythical creatures could there be among humans? In the small city ahead, there were at least a hundred thousand people. It was unknown if all the elites in Earth’s Federation added up could gather that many Mythical humans.

Furthermore, the small city was bordering the Land of the Fallen. Ignoring humans, even powerful dimensional creatures wouldn’t choose to build a city here.

Seeing that Grim Demon wasn’t sure, Zhou Wen immediately walked towards the city.

The sea of flowers stopped at a cliff. Beneath it was a bottomless abyss. On the other side of the cliff was a continuous mountain range. The small city was built on the mountain opposite.

There was no path to the small city on the other side. However, the bottomless abyss wasn’t a problem for Zhou Wen and Grim Demon. They could easily fly over it.

For safety’s sake, Zhou Wen even released a Musical Note Sprite to probe. The Musical Note Sprite flew freely in the air without discovering any danger. Only then did Zhou Wen fly towards the human city opposite with Demonic Neonate in his arms.

The city was built on a mountain. On the side facing the cliff, there were gates. Outside the gates was a platform. Some humans were setting up stalls on the platform. It was a lively market with many people.

When Zhou Wen flew over with Demonic Neonate in his arms, he didn’t conceal himself with his Terror transformation powers. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to hide, but Demonic Neonate couldn’t be hidden. It was pointless for him to hide.

Soon, many people saw Zhou Wen fly over with Demonic Neonate in his arms. As for Grim Demon, ordinary people couldn’t see him due to his Terror transformation.

Everyone stood up and widened their eyes, staring blankly at Zhou Wen when they saw him.

They seemed to have seen something unbelievable. Their eyes widened as they stood rooted to the ground in shock.

Everyone who saw Zhou Wen had the same expression.

The stall owners stopped peddling their wares and the buyers forgot the items in their hands as they looked at Zhou Wen.

“May I ask where this is?” Zhou Wen flew to a spot near the platform and greeted while asking.

He had a nagging feeling that something was amiss with this city and these humans, but he couldn’t tell what was amiss.

“Ah!” At that moment, everyone seemed to awaken from a dream. As though they had seen something terrifying, they screamed and turned to flee into the city.

Someone even threw out the things in their hands. Instantly, the market was in a frenzy. When Zhou Wen snapped to his senses, the huge market was empty. The ground was in a mess.

“Do I look that terrifying?” Zhou Wen touched his face and asked Grim Demon. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You are a little ugly compared to me, but it’s not to the point of being terrifying. The residents of this small city probably haven’t seen much, so they haven’t seen anything uglier. Don’t make a fuss,” Grim Demon said smugly.

If Demonic Neonate could still move, Zhou Wen would have gotten her to send Grim Demon back into the Demonic Sword. This fellow was born shameless.

Zhou Wen carried Demonic Neonate into the city. When the humans realized that he had entered the city, they were even more alarmed. All of them fled with all their might. Even the humans in the city who didn’t know what had happened scrambled to escape.

The shop owners on both sides of the road shuttered their doors and windows tightly.

Soon, the long street was empty. The streets were filled with trash.

Is there something wrong with their heads? Zhou Wen took out a mirror and looked at himself, but he didn’t discover anything to be afraid of.

He had a nose and two eyes, just like them—a normal human.

“Are the humans in this city all mentally ill? What’s there to be afraid of when seeing a human?” Grim Demon clearly found it very strange.

“They aren’t mentally ill. They are just afraid of something.” Zhou Wen frowned in thought. Before he could figure it out, he saw the people who had escaped walking back in fear.

The person in the lead was an old man with white hair and a beard that almost reached his waist. He held a walking stick in his hand. His walking looked unstable as though he would fall at any moment.

Many people followed behind the elder and walked towards Zhou Wen and company. Their eyes were clearly filled with fear, but despite being so afraid, they slowly walked over with the elder.

Zhou Wen stood on the long street and waited for them to walk over. Since they were willing to come to him, it meant that they could still communicate. All he needed to do was make things clear.

Although they were in the dimension, they were humans after all. They should be easier to communicate with than dimensional creatures.

Although the elder’s eyes were filled with fear, he still walked over step by step. When he was still dozens of meters away from Zhou Wen which wasn’t conducive for face-to-face communication, the elder suddenly threw away his cane and plopped to the ground with a grunt before bowing at Zhou Wen.

With the elder prostrating, the crowd behind him did the same.

“Your Devilish Excellency, please spare that child’s life. If you want to eat her, eat me…” the elder said as he kowtowed with tears in his eyes.

“What’s going on?” Zhou Wen was dumbfounded.

How did he become the His Devilish Excellency? Furthermore, he was only carrying Demonic Neonate. Such a gentle posture didn’t look like he wanted to eat her.

Are these people nuts??Zhou Wen looked at the people who were prostrating before him while begging him not to eat the child. Zhou Wen now agreed with Grim Demon’s view. Perhaps these people were really nuts.

Zhou Wen felt that explaining to a group of lunatics that he wasn’t a devilish king or that he didn’t eat children was clearly a very difficult task. Therefore, he planned on going along with the conversation and figuring things out.

“How do you know that I’m the devil king?” Zhou Wen stared at the white-haired elder and asked.

The white-haired elder’s body trembled, but he quickly answered respectfully, “Apart from you, Your Devilish Excellency, who else can come out of the Lost Paradise? Apart from you, who else can transform into something looking so much like a human…”

Zhou Wen opened his mouth and suddenly realized that it wasn’t easy to explain this matter.

It didn’t seem like these people would believe him even if he said that he was human.
