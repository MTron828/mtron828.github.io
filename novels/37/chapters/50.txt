Chapter 51: Companion Beast’s Food

Zhou Wen chose ‘yes’ out of curiosity. He had no idea how feeding was done, nor did he know what Companion Beasts ate.

Although people would use dimensional crystals to strengthen their Companion Beasts in real life to expedite their evolution, the situation with the Silver-Winged Flying Ant was somewhat different. It wasn’t evolving but growing up.

‘Two foods available: Mutated Vigor Ant and Mutated Skeleton Ant. Please select the food for feeding.’

The food is actually Companion Beasts? Zhou Wen found it extravagant. The price of any Companion Beast could feed an ordinary person for half a year; yet, this fellow was actually eating them.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen had no way to sell the Companion Beasts that dropped in-game. For instance, the Mutated Vigor Ant was no longer of much use, so using it as food wasn’t something to be sad about.

He didn’t hesitate as he chose the Mutated Vigor Ant as food and fed it to the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.

The Mutated Vigor Ant which had been selected transformed into a swirl of light that flew towards the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. There was nothing apart from a silver flash after it had infused the Silver-Winged Flying Ant. It allowed the latter’s hungry state to disappear.

Having killed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, the ordinary Vigor Ants and Mutated Vigor Ants couldn’t stop the blood-colored avatar and the skeleton ant. Zhou Wen stormed forward, hoping to see what hid deeper in the Ant Nest.

The Mutated Skeleton Ant was like a tank. It left a wake of destruction through the ant swarm, but the swarm was like a terrifying tidal wave. Despite spending half an hour, he only advanced a few hundred meters.

Zhou Wen’s heart stirred when he saw the underground area widen significantly. He summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and four transparent wings appeared behind the blood-colored avatar, allowing the blood-colored avatar to fly up.

Although it could only fly about ten meters high, it was sufficient to prevent the Vigor Ants from touching him. Besides, they were underground, so there wasn’t that much space for him to fly.

In fact, even if he flew higher, it wouldn’t help as there were ants crawling on the ceiling. Zhou Wen didn’t allow the blood-colored avatar to get too close.

The Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s Life Providence as King of Low Altitudes made things easier. It flew very agilely at low altitudes and even if Vigor Ants were to pounce off the ceiling towards him, he was able to easily dodge them.

Zhou Wen had hopes of encountering other Silver-Winged Flying Ants as he flew or other higher-level dimensional creatures since he was no longer satisfied killing ordinary Vigor Ants.

The cave became wider as he ventured deeper. Before long, the game screen suddenly opened up. An underground cavern appeared; huge beyond imagination.

And in that underground cavern, there were ant nests stringed together like a gigantic underground city.

However, these ant nests were different from human buildings. They looked like stone spheres of varying sizes with huge stone strips in between them, covering nearly half the underground space.

Around the ant nests’ periphery, there was a swarm of black-winged flying ants circling the area. Zhou Wen could only see the center where there was a huge spherical ant nest. Furthermore, there was a strange golden glow emitting from it.

The next second, Zhou Wen saw a swarm of black-winged flying ants charge at him. The blood-colored avatar didn’t even manage to put up a struggle before being overrun and dying.

Upon seeing the black screen, Zhou Wen quit the game. He believed that he had no means of exploring the ant city for quite some time.

“At the very least, I’ll have to wait until the Silver-Winged Flying Ant grows up before I have a chance of exploring the ant city. I wonder what that golden glow in the middle of the ant nest is. It doesn’t look like an ant.” Zhou Wen hadn’t had much time to observe it and since it was too far, he hadn’t managed to take a good look.

He happened to be hungry, so he headed to the kitchen to look for some food. He realized that Li Xuan’s fridge was empty. The only thing there was leftover pizza—moldy pizza.

Isn’t it a waste to have this huge refrigerator switched on all the time with nothing inside? Zhou Wen decided to buy some food. They were still a few days away from the first day of school, and he needed food for those days.

...

Inside a hotel suite in Luoyang City, Qiao Siyuan was carefully reading through a document.

A blonde, green-eyed woman, Liz, reported as she held a tablet in hand, “That youth’s information is all in here. His name is Zhou Wen, a student of Guide High School. He graduated this year and scored pretty highly. He came in second in the city for the combat test. He has already been admitted into Sunset College. His father is Zhou Lingfeng, a translator. He doesn’t have any background worth mentioning, but interestingly, Zhou Lingfeng recently remarried and his new wife is the An family’s widow, Ouyang Lan.”

“An Tianzuo’s mother, Ouyang Lan?” Qiao Siyuan was taken aback when he heard that as he looked up at Liz.

Liz smiled with a nod. “Yes, Overseer An’s mother. According to the intel, An Jing had once specially transferred to Guide High School to beat up Zhou Wen.”

Qiao Siyuan fell into deep thought after hearing that. He glared at Liz and asked, “Does Zhou Lingfeng really not have any background?”

“I’ve already had his background investigated. For three generations, their family has been poor. Zhou Lingfeng’s father was a carpenter. He didn’t enjoy physical labor from a young age, and due to his aptitude in language, he chose to be a translator,” Liz said as she took a look at her summary.

“Could it be possible that Zhou Lingfeng had made contact with people overseas?” Qiao Siyuan asked.

“Unlikely. Although Zhou Lingfeng has some aptitude in language, he’s quite a frivolous person. He’s gluttonous and lazy and quite lustful, often spending his time in bars. His cultivation is terrible and he only barely entered the Legendary stage a few years ago. I doubt such a person will catch the fancy of those fellows overseas, right?” Liz replied.

“That’s strange. Why would a woman like Ouyang Lan like such a man?” Qiao Siyuan frowned.

“Women like a bad boy. Perhaps Ouyang Lan likes a pretty boy like Zhou Lingfeng?” Liz suggested.

Qiao Siyuan firmly shook his head. “Ouyang Lan definitely isn’t such a woman. The An family went into turmoil following An Datong’s death. An Tianzuo was only fourteen when he inherited the An family’s business. Countless important figures in the League crave what the An family has. Even members of the An family have their sights on these things, a classic case of domestic trouble and foreign invasion. For An Tianzuo to keep the family business secure to this day at such a young age, who do you think was responsible for it? With a woman as powerful as Ouyang Lan, even if she’s remarrying, why would she randomly choose such a useless man?”

“But we’ve already checked very carefully. The Zhou family really doesn’t have any background. Zhou Lingfeng is clean, so it’s unlikely he has any relationships with those overseas,” Liz said.

“Don’t underestimate those people overseas.” Qiao Siyuan thought and said, “Is Zhou Wen living at the Ans presently?”

“No. As he had teamed up with Li Xuan for the college entrance exams, they seemed to build up quite a good relationship. Therefore, he has been living at his place since he arrived in Luoyang. We failed to find him in Guide City previously because Li Xuan had brought him to Luoyang early,” Liz said.

“Bring Zhou Wen here. Remember not to alert anyone, especially the Ans,” Qiao Siyuan said in a deep voice.
