Chapter 1350: Breaking into the Rankings Again

Translator: CKtalon

“You have the final say in Luoyang now. You are the king of Luoyang. If you want to accept it, accept it. If you don’t want to, just let them wait. If anyone dares to fall out with you, just beat them up and chase them away,” An Sheng said with a smile.

Zhou Wen pondered for a moment. “Then I won’t accept it. Prepare yourself. Pick someone to follow me to the Venusian dimensional zone. Let’s get a ranking first.”

“What are your requirements?” An Sheng asked solemnly.

“As long as they run fast,” Zhou Wen said after some thought. As long as they ran fast and saved some time, he could also lower the number of Calamity-grade bullets circling him.

Without a suitable target, even with Calamity-grade bullets, it wasn’t easy to kill a Calamity-grade. Zhou Wen planned on returning the Invincible Lucky Star to Wang Lu after this.

In the future, even if he wanted to rush to the top of the rankings, he would have to rely on his own abilities. After all, Lucky Dodge was not a long-term solution.

Recently, Zhou Wen had a new idea when studying spatial skills. He felt that he might have a chance of dealing with a Calamity-grade bullet.

Although he had used Spacetime Bandit and Absolute Space, he was still unable to form an infinitely looping space. Moreover, he was unable to completely fuse it with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique. He kept feeling like something was missing.

However, after learning the Minor Heavenly Stellar Array, Zhou Wen had a new idea.

If it was not possible to simply cast a skill, then he could use an array to achieve the behavior of an infinitely looping space. By combining the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array and Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, he might be able to achieve the method of producing infinite space.

However, this required a lot of time for experimentation and modification; it was not something that could succeed quickly.

“Then do you think Miss Jing is up to it?” An Sheng asked.

“Anyone is fine.” Zhou Wen didn’t feel anything special about An Jing. It made no difference to him whether it was An Jing or someone else from the Sunset Army.

“Then let’s have Miss Jing do it. Her speed is considered extremely fast among the Mythical grade,” An Sheng said.

Zhou Wen recalled something and asked An Sheng, “How did An Jing advance to the Mythical stage?”

Zhou Wen still remembered that An Jing had previously contracted a Guardian, but he had killed the Guardian she had contracted with. Ever since then, Zhou Wen hadn’t paid much attention to An Jing.

After returning five years later, he learned that An Jing had advanced to the Mythical stage. Furthermore, she had been pretending to be Zhou Wen for five years.

An Sheng hesitated for a moment before saying, “Actually, it’s hard to say. Miss Jing relied on her own hard work to advance to the Mythical stage. There’s also another thing…” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After a long pause, An Sheng whispered, “Holy Land.”

Zhou Wen looked at An Sheng in surprise, hoping that An Sheng could explain himself. There were too many possibilities with what he had just said, so Zhou Wen couldn’t guess.

“In short, it’s not easy for me to say anything about this. It’s better to let Miss Jing tell you herself when there’s an opportunity in the future. Just feign ignorance and don’t mention this in front of her,” An Sheng said.

“Alright, make the preparations. We’ll head to Venus tomorrow morning.” Zhou Wen originally didn’t plan on having much interaction with An Jing. He was just curious.

An Jing’s advancement to the Mythical stage was actually related to the Holy Land. This implied something subtle.

An Sheng informed An Jing that Zhou Wen was going to Venus to obtain a ranking. An Jing was slightly taken aback when she heard that. “Is he taking me along?”

“That’s right. After all, we’re family. Of course, we have to keep such benefits for ourselves,” An Sheng said.

“Why doesn’t he get the rankings himself?” An Jing frowned.

“Young Master Wen doesn’t plan on getting on the rankings yet. He’s only helping Luoyang get a ranking,” An Sheng explained.

“What do I need to prepare?” An Jing asked again.

“Young Master Wen said that after dealing with the six Golden Battle Gods, you have to reach the Golden Palace as quickly as possible. The faster you reach the Golden Palace, the less pressure he will suffer.” An Sheng naturally wouldn’t tell An Jing that Zhou Wen wanted speed to save him some time.

“Got it.” An Jing nodded.

The next morning, Zhou Wen, An Sheng, and An Jing arrived in front of the Cube.

An Jing stood behind and looked at Zhou Wen with mixed feelings. Over the past few years, she had been using Zhou Wen as her goal to improve herself. She hoped that one day, she could surpass Zhou Wen and use her actions to tell everyone that she wasn’t inferior to him.

However, not only did the disparity between the two of them not decrease, it had instead increased.

She hadn’t advanced to the Terror grade, but Zhou Wen was already able to participate in a Calamity-grade battle. The difference wasn’t small.

However, An Jing didn’t have any thoughts of giving up. Previously, she had been at the Legendary stage while Zhou Wen was at the Mortal stage. Zhou Wen had been able to catch up from behind. Her current situation was very similar to the former Zhou Wen’s.

An Jing believed that since Zhou Wen could do it, as long as she worked hard, she would definitely be rewarded.

After all, the higher one went, the slower the advancement. When Zhou Wen stopped advancing, she still had a chance of catching up, and she believed that she had the ability to do so.

“Activate the Cube,” Zhou Wen said to An Jing.

An Jing’s body naturally reacted. She listened to Zhou Wen’s orders and walked towards the Cube.

After An Jing came to a realization of what she had done, she couldn’t help but be taken aback. This was because she had subconsciously listened to Zhou Wen’s orders as though it was a matter of course. Such a reaction shouldn’t have happened to her.

This was because she was a maverick. There was only one person who could make her carry out orders without thinking—An Tianzuo.

Even Ouyang Lan’s words had to be thought through by An Jing before she decided if she complied.

Logically speaking, her relationship with Zhou Wen wasn’t good, and she viewed him as an opponent. It was impossible for such a situation to happen.

After walking up to the Cube, An Jing turned her head to look at Zhou Wen who was standing on it.

Zhou Wen stood there casually without any powerful aura, but he made people feel abnormally at ease. It was as though even if the sky collapsed, it wasn’t a big deal as long as he stood there.

An Jing had only felt such a feeling from An Tianzuo in the past, but now, she felt it from Zhou Wen.

In a daze, An Jing looked at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at An Tianzuo; it was a rather strange feeling.

“Drip some blood in,” Zhou Wen said.

An Jing snapped to her senses as she lowered her head and dripped a drop of blood into the entrance of the Cube.

The Cube instantly shone with brilliant light. All of the Cubes in the world activated simultaneously.

“Another creature has entered the Venusian dimensional zone… Who is it? Could it be a human?”

“Damn, why is it him again? He even brought a beauty with him this time. Who is that beauty?”

“The An family’s An Jing. She’s said to be very talented and is in no way inferior to An Tianzuo. In a few years, she might become another An Tianzuo.”

“I don’t know if she will become another An Tianzuo, but that Zhou Wen is too much. Don’t tell me he wants to lead someone onto the rankings again?”

“Only An Jing is following. Looks like it.”

“This person… can only be described with two words… utterly outrageous…”

Amidst everyone’s discussion, Zhou Wen and An Jing entered the Venusian dimensional zone.

It was like a replay of what happened previously.. Zhou Wen dealt with the Metal Guards and the Golden Battle Gods as he entered the corridor.
