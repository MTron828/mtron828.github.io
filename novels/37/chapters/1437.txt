Chapter 1438: Entering the Crew

Translator: CKtalon

“If the two of you wish to enter Magic Palace, will you be interested in joining our program team?” When Su Yi saw Zhou Wen frown, she immediately said, “Don’t worry. We are a professional media outlet. Without your permission, we won’t release any news related to you, nor will we take pictures or recordings.”

Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen and from the look in his eyes, he knew that he wanted to go.

“Sorry, we just came by to take a look. We had no intention of entering.” Zhou Wen still rejected Su Yi.

Although the matter about the magic box’s opening being close at hand might only be a rumor, Zhou Wen still didn’t wish to take the risk. Furthermore, from his past experience, there was a high chance that something would happen if he entered a dimensional zone. If he followed the program team in, he might end up harming them.

Su Yi was deeply disappointed. “That’s such a pity. We still have to do some filming outside. If the two of you change your minds and wish to enter, you are welcome to join us at any time. I can be your guide. I know the interior of Magic Palace well.”

With that said, Su Yi bade farewell and returned to the program team. She didn’t try to persuade him further.

“We were planning on entering anyway. With such a beauty as a guide, why not? Why reject her?” Li Xuan was puzzled.

“I originally planned on entering, but now that there’s the matter regarding the magic box, it’s best to be careful. I’ll not enter for the time being.” Zhou Wen paused before smiling. “Besides, you can’t touch women, right? No matter how beautiful Su Yi is, it has nothing to do with you, right?”

“What do you mean I can’t touch women? That’s because I don’t fancy them, and have no intention of touching them. If I really find someone suitable, I’m up to it in any way that’s better than you,” Li Xuan shouted as he jumped.

“I don’t know if you are up to it, but it’s best we don’t enter Magic Palace for the time being. Let’s walk around its surroundings.” Zhou Wen walked towards Magic Palace’s door.

Since Su Yi already knew of his presence, there was no need to hide. It was more important to download the dungeon.

Su Yi had already informed the production team. Although they could clearly sense that the production team had recognized Zhou Wen, no one came to disturb them.

Zhou Wen looked at the door and took many pictures. He took the opportunity to take a picture of the tiny palm symbol and successfully entered the download screen.

Meanwhile, Li Xuan watched their filming. As he watched, he said regretfully, “It’s a pity not to join them when such a beautiful chick is willing to be our tour guide.”

Zhou Wen put away his phone and ignored Li Xuan. He looked at the filming crew. He was just taking a casual look when he realized that something was amiss.

The videographer who was filming Su Yi’s frontal shot seemed to be avoiding his gaze.

Although it wasn’t obvious and it was normal for the videographer to have his face obstructed by the camera, Zhou Wen felt that his actions were a little awkward. Furthermore, the videographer gave him a familiar feeling.

After secretly using Truth Listener to observe for a while, Zhou Wen immediately discovered the problem. The videographer was Liu Yun. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although he had changed his appearance and even his figure was a little different from before, Zhou Wen still recognized him. This was all thanks to his sharp senses.

If not for his sharp senses, he wouldn’t have been able to tell that it was Liu Yun.

Liu Yun is a person who doesn’t do things without benefits. He changed his appearance and sneaked into the program team, but he’s deliberately hiding from me. What’s he up to??Zhou Wen suddenly thought.?Could he be the one who spread the rumors of Magic Palace?

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more he felt that it was right. Liu Yun had sneaked into the program team because he wanted to enter Magic Palace.

However, there was something Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out. The Magic Palace wasn’t controlled by a large faction, so anyone could enter. If Liu Yun wanted to enter, he could have entered himself. Why did he have to sneak into the program team?

Could it be that there’s something in the program team that’s helpful to him?

?Zhou Wen carefully scanned everyone in the program team.

There were more than ten people in the program team. Apart from the host, director, camera crew, there were a few human experts who were in charge of clearing dimensional creatures.

The few human experts were at the Mythical stage. It was obvious that three of them had advanced using Mythical Serums. They had obvious dimensional creature characteristics and one had likely contracted a Guardian.

Apart from that, there was also a special guest. In fact, he was Su Yi’s host partner. Zhou Wen wasn’t unfamiliar with this person. He was Professor Gu, who often partnered with Su Yi.

Zhou Wen watched for a while but didn’t discover any problems.

What is Liu Yun plotting??Zhou Wen thought for a moment and suddenly said to Li Xuan, “Don’t you want to go in and take a look? Then tell Su Yi that we want to follow their program team in to take a look.”

“Holy sh*t, Old Zhou, it sure wasn’t easy. You’ve finally thought it through.” Li Xuan was overjoyed as he patted Zhou Wen on the shoulder and said, “That’s right. Life is only a short few decades. It’s only right to enjoy it in a timely fashion. It’s pointless thinking about all kinds of nonsense all day.”

“Are you going? If not, I’ll tell them myself,” Zhou Wen said.

“Don’t, let me do it. It’s not like you like dealing with people. Leave such troublesome matters to me.” Li Xuan ran to the program team.

After a while, Li Xuan walked over with Su Yi and another middle-aged man wearing a hat.

Zhou Wen learned from Li Xuan’s introductions that the middle-aged man’s name was Evan—the director of this production team. He had agreed to let Zhou Wen and Li Xuan join the production team, but because they had filming work, they could only follow their designated path. They sometimes had to stop to film, making it impossible for them to have the freedom to constantly wander around.

After agreeing to these conditions, Zhou Wen, Li Xuan, and Ya’er officially joined the program team.

“Is this little girl going in too? Although the matter regarding the magic box is just a rumor, Magic Palace is rather dangerous. She’s still so young…” Su Yi said as she looked at Ya’er.

“It’s fine. I’ll watch over her,” Zhou Wen said.

“I was just overthinking things. With your strength, Mr. Zhou, it’s naturally impossible for the dimensional creatures in Magic Palace to injure you and this little girl,” Su Yi said with a smile.

After the filming at the entrance was completed, the group officially entered Magic Palace. Past the door was a large square.

The dimensional creatures inside hadn’t been completely wiped out due to the drop in humans entering Magic Palace recently. There were many strange dimensional creatures wandering around the square.

Upon seeing Zhou Wen and company enter Magic Palace, the dimensional creatures immediately rushed over.

One of the Mythical humans didn’t spend much effort to finish off the dimensional creatures that rushed over.

Zhou Wen secretly observed Liu Yun the entire time. He didn’t pull off any tricks. He was akin to a professional videographer who was always loyal to his work.. He captured all the scenes the director needed.
