Chapter 822: Ending Before Starting

Zhou Wen ignored the six-winged seraphim and looked at An Jing as though he wanted her to answer him personally.

“I contracted the Guardian to defeat you. If I can’t defeat you, what’s the point of having a Guardian?” An Jing’s eyes were resolute as she stared at Zhou Wen and continued, “Over the past few days, I’ve been constantly seeking a breakthrough. Even in my dreams, I’ve been thinking about how to make myself stronger. No matter what problems I encounter, as long as I can defeat you, I can...”

An Jing was still speaking, but Zhou Wen had already drawn his saber when she said her first sentence.

Immortal Slaying!

Back when he fought John, Zhou Wen already had a good understanding of the six-winged seraphim’s abilities. He knew what skills he had, so there was no need for him to hesitate.

The only thing he needed to consider was the effects on An Jing after killing the six-winged seraphim. Since An Jing said that contracting a Guardian was meaningless if she couldn’t defeat him, Zhou Wen didn’t have any qualms.

Immortal Slaying was unbelievably fast. It wasn’t domineering because it was too fast. It was impossible to sense any domineering aura.

By the time An Jing sensed Zhou Wen’s strike, his saber had already returned to its scabbard.

As for the six-winged seraphim in the air behind her, his pupils constricted. His mouth moved as though it wanted to say something, but this movement only served to misalign his mouth. His body split into two as it fell to the sides, turning into white feathers that dissipated.

An Jing stood there in a daze. There was no surprise on her face, only confusion and shock. She stopped her words midway.

She never expected Zhou Wen to strike without much warning. Zhou Wen was still hugging Ya’er in his arms. She originally wanted to say that they would only begin the battle after Zhou Wen placed the child to the side, but Zhou Wen held the child in one hand and drew his saber with the other. He killed the six-winged seraphim so casually that it felt like they hadn’t even begun the battle.

I... haven’t even started yet... This was the only thought that remained in An Jing’s mind. She didn’t know what to say next.

After slaying the six-winged seraphim with one strike, Zhou Wen felt a strange energy infuse into the Slaughterer Life Soul, causing it to grow again. He had a faint feeling that it was turning corporeal.

However, even after the energy was exhausted, Slaughterer still failed to advance to a Perfect Body.

Is it still not enough? How many do I have to kill? Zhou Wen was somewhat depressed.

It probably wouldn’t be easy to find another Guardian that was as easy to kill as the six-winged seraphim.

Firstly, the six-winged seraphim couldn’t be considered especially powerful among the Guardians. Secondly, Zhou Wen knew the various abilities of the six-winged seraphim like the back of his hand, allowing him to kill him so easily.

If it were an unfamiliar Guardian, even if its strength was about the same as the six-winged seraphim, it would be difficult for him to kill it so easily.

“Let’s call it a day. If you really want to defeat me, use your own strength. The strength bestowed by others unto you won’t be able to defeat me.” Zhou Wen turned around and walked back with Ya’er in his arms.

An Jing stood there without moving for quite some time. Before this battle, she had thought about many things. She had thought about the possible winning and losing outcomes, but no matter how she imagined the possibilities, she never expected that she would lose before the battle even began.

She originally thought that this would be an evenly matched battle, but now, she suddenly realized that she didn’t seem to have the qualifications to stand in the arena.

Just like an amateur challenging a professional boxer, she fell to the ground before the bell rang. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

...

I hope she won’t look for The Thearch again.

Zhou Wen didn’t wish for An Jing to have anything to do with The Thearch.

An Jing was Ouyang Lan’s daughter after all. Although Zhou Wen didn’t like her much, he didn’t wish for anything to happen to her.

After returning to the encampment, Zhou Wen met a few acquaintances and gathered with them before setting off for Luoyang the next day.

Qin Wufu had been encouraging Zhou Wen to give up on his studies and come over to work with him. Zhou Wen politely declined.

It wasn’t that Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to contribute to protecting humans, but that he felt that making himself stronger was the most important. As long as he was the strongest, he could completely eliminate the uncertainties and not be forced into a passive position of defense.

Zhou Wen was willing to stay on campus because the college would give him plenty of free time and provide him with plenty of resources and information. It allowed him to walk the path he wanted and quickly become stronger.

However, if he entered the military, he needed to carry out missions. That could indeed help a portion of people, but Zhou Wen wanted to help more than just a portion.

After returning to school, Zhou Wen began studying the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. This was because it was very difficult for Civilized Country to advance by relying on Bright Torch Vision World. He had to think of other solutions, and he couldn’t think of one at the moment unless he could obtain a pet like the Mystic Bird. However, that wasn’t easy, so Zhou Wen could only study other Essence Energy Arts.

The Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art was a rather interesting Essence Energy Art. Zhou Wen had only just gained basic mastery of it. Although he didn’t sense any powerful strength from it, just the way the Essence Energy was circulated was very interesting.

Typical Essence Energy Arts mostly had a sea of energy, but Essence Energy Arts like the Lost Immortal Sutra didn’t have an Essence Energy sea. However, the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art had countless Essence Energy seas.

When the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art circulated, his body was like a tiny universe with countless revolving stars. Every star was an Essence Energy sea, and the entire tiny universe was a huge Essence Energy sea.

As Zhou Wen felt his Essence Energy circulate, he pondered over the profundity of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art, hoping to condense a Life Providence.

Condensing a Life Soul required the blood essence of a Mythical or Guardian. Otherwise, the simulation of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art couldn’t condense a Life Soul without a foundation. However, a Life Providence wasn’t that particular. All one needed to do was gain insight into the Essence Energy Art.

Why does this Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art’s pocket universe feel a little similar to the Endless Sea of Stars? Zhou Wen suddenly discovered something amiss.

The layout of the miniature universe’s stars was very similar to the Endless Sea of Stars. If Zhou Wen hadn’t spent a long time grinding Essence Energy Skills in the Endless Sea of Stars, he wouldn’t have discovered this similarity.

Could it be... Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he stopped practicing and took out his phone to enter the Endless Sea of Stars dungeon.

Zhou Wen looked up at the stars in the Endless Sea of Stars. After watching for a while, he heaved a sigh of relief and revealed a look of delight. As expected, the circulation method of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art is a replica of the Endless Sea of Stars.
