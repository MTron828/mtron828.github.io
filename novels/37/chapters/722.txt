Chapter 723: The Antelope Leads the Way

Translator: CKtalon

“Minister Qiao, are you sure the person who appeared at Five Dragons Mouth is Zhou Wen?” Shen Yuchi asked with a frown as he looked at the report delivered by Qiao Siyuan.

“I’ve confirmed his age and appearance. It matches Zhou Wen in many areas,” Qiao Siyuan answered respectfully.

“It’s normal for young people at this age to have similar looks,” Shen Yuchi said.

“Director-General, you’re right. However, I still think that the young man who appeared at Five Dragons Mouth is Zhou Wen,” Qiao Siyuan said.

“What evidence do you have?” Shen Yuchi asked.

“We’re still investigating, but there’s nothing new for the time being. However, my intuition tells me that it’s Zhou Wen,” Qiao Siyuan said with certainty.

Shen Yuchi wasn’t angered by Qiao Siyuan’s seemingly irresponsible words. In fact, in their line of work, their intuition was sometimes very accurate.

Intuition wasn’t just a blind guess. It was a sharp sense of an event’s systematic development that they had honed after experiencing countless incidents.

“If that young man is Zhou Wen, why do you think he went to Five Dragons Mouth? What’s his next destination?” Shen Yuchi said after some thought.

“According to intelligence, someone has been seeing Zhou Wen in the vicinity of Luoyang recently. However, I feel that this may be a ruse from the An family. Their goal is to cover Zhou Wen. According to this inference, Zhou Wen’s goal isn’t as simple as staying at Five Dragons Mouth for a period of time.”

Qiao Siyuan paused before continuing, “I’m guessing that Zhou Wen won’t be returning to Luoyang next. According to his current trajectory, he should be heading north. I think he might come to the Imperial Capital.”

“There are so many cities in the north. Why do you think that he will definitely come to the Imperial Capital?” Shen Yuchi frowned.

“I don’t have any evidence yet, but it’s best to make some preparations,” Qiao Siyuan said.

“That’s right. However, Zhou Wen has already reached a certain level of attainment. Even without the An family’s protection, it won’t be easy to touch him,” Shen Yuchi said after some thought.

“Director-General, why don’t you discuss it with the Xia family? Perhaps they are also interested in Zhou Wen,” Qiao Siyuan said.

Shen Yuchi naturally understood what Qiao Siyuan was referring to. He glanced at Qiao Siyuan and said meaningfully, “Then help me make a trip to the Xia family and inform them of this matter.”

“Yes, sir.” Qiao Siyuan received the order.

After Qiao Siyuan left, the woman Shen Yuchi called “Button” walked out. Shen Yuchi looked at the documents and said, “What’s your take?”

“Qiao Siyuan’s attention on Zhou Wen seems to have exceeded the attention he places on Wang Mingyuan’s other disciples,” said Button.

“Are you saying that he has ulterior motives for Zhou Wen?” Shen Yuchi looked up at Button.

“I don’t know. I’ve investigated him. Just as you said, Director-General, this person is too simple. His life seems to revolve around nothing but work. He doesn’t have any obvious personal hobbies, no wife, children, family, or friends. He doesn’t even have a lover. He doesn’t eat, drink, prostitute, or gamble. It’s hard to imagine how he does it given his age and status,” said Button.

“Perhaps he’s a workaholic,” Shen Yuchi said.

Button’s red lips curled up slightly as she continued, “You can say that, but as a workaholic, he doesn’t seem to be so focused on other parts of his work.”

“Then why do you think Qiao Siyuan mentioned the Xia family?” Shen Yuchi continued.

“There’s no way to deduce it for the time being. However, from what I know, in the past few decades, there have been many young geniuses who died young, and all of them have something to do with the Xia family. If the Xia family learns of Zhou Wen’s arrival in the Imperial Capital, perhaps there’s really no need for you to think about it, Director-General.”

“Then let’s take a wait and see approach for now.” Shen Yuchi lowered his head and continued working.

Zhou Wen traversed mountains and forests. Although the dimensional storms had brought a huge calamity to humanity, Earth was brimming with vitality. It was unlike the past where everywhere was filled with buildings made of concrete and steel.

“What are you doing? It’s not over there. We’re going this way.” When they reached a fork in the road, Zhou Wen was supposed to take the left fork, but the antelope actually walked to the right.

The antelope ignored him and bit Zhou Wen’s sleeve as it walked to the right, forcing him to follow.

“What’s here? Why do you have to walk this way?” Zhou Wen found it odd. Although the antelope had been very willful and aloof in the past, it had never interfered with Zhou Wen’s actions.

This time, the antelope had taken the initiative to alter his path. This left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.

The antelope didn’t answer as it walked ahead as though it hadn’t heard Zhou Wen.

If Zhou Wen stopped and didn’t leave, it would come over to pull him back.

Zhou Wen studied the map. The right fork was originally a road, but because there were too many dimensional zones there, as well as the appearance of many break-out creatures, it was abandoned due to the danger. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Zhou Wen felt that there was definitely something going on and he was somewhat intrigued. He wanted to know what the antelope was up to, so he followed it.

However, Zhou Wen summoned Six-Winged to prevent any accidents.

He hadn’t managed to successfully create a Substitute Talisman yet. He had drawn quite a number of them whenever he was free, but unfortunately, he hadn’t succeeded. The success rate of producing a Substitute Talisman was just too low.

Due to the encroachment of the plants on both sides of the originally spacious road, many branches and roots were strewn across the road. Green vines crawled everywhere.

The trees on both sides of the road were extremely tall. The tree crowns were squeezed together, blocking out the sunlight. Zhou Wen felt that walking on the road was no different from walking in a forest.

As he walked, Zhou Wen suddenly felt that something was amiss. There were trees everywhere, but there wasn’t a single bird or insect in the huge forest. The entire forest was terrifyingly quiet.

Zhou Wen had already expanded Truth Listener’s range to its limits, but he still didn’t discover any animals. There wasn’t even an ant.

How can this be? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown as he secretly became wary.

The antelope remained oblivious as it continued walking ahead. The chick stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and looked around curiously.

“Where are you going?” Zhou Wen asked the antelope in front of him.

The antelope didn’t know how to speak at all. Even if it could speak, it had no intention of answering Zhou Wen. Just as Zhou Wen was hesitating about following it down, it suddenly left the road and burrowed into the grass beside it.

It was a dense grass patch and many vines coiled together. After the antelope entered, it immediately vanished. Thankfully, Zhou Wen had Truth Listener and could see the situation in the grass.

After the antelope burrowed into the grass, it continued walking in. Soon, it arrived at an empty spot.

The empty spot was rather strange. There were dense plants all around, but there was not a single blade of grass growing in that small area. It was as if a strong weed killer had been used.
