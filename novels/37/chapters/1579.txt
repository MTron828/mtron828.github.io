Chapter 1580: Who’s the One With the Higher Vantage Point?

Translator: CKtalon

It looks like Jiuyang is getting very serious! Godsfall knew very well that the simpler Jiuyang’s boxing technique was, the stronger it was.

Youkai clearly didn’t understand this principle. He had always felt that a true expert’s move would be totally impossible to guard against. It would definitely be an extremely incisive killing move. Every move would be fatal. Even if it wasn’t gorgeous, it would definitely be strange and unpredictable.

Youkai couldn’t tell what was good about Jiuyang’s simple and boring boxing technique. He said in puzzlement, “Is this a legendary Calamity-grade powerhouse? It doesn’t look like much. I can also use such a boxing technique. It seems like these Calamity-grade powerhouses are only slightly stronger.

Their realm might not be much higher than the average person.”

However, Carlos said with a sneer, “If you were to use such a fist technique to fight Zhou Wen, you would have long been killed.”

Youkai said indignantly, “I guarantee that my boxing technique will be identical to Jiuyang’s. So he’ll be fine, while I’ll be beaten to death by Zhou Wen?”

“You only saw his boxing technique, but you didn’t see the details,” Carlos replied.

“Details?” Youkai was slightly stunned.

“His boxing technique is very simple, so is his movement technique, and his footwork is equally simple. However, when he uses them together, it’s nothing simple. Far from that,” said Carlos.

“Why can’t I tell what’s so special about him? I can also use these things of his without any flaws.” Youkai carefully sized him up again, but he failed to identify anything.

Carlos didn’t look at Youkai, He stared at Jiuyang in battle and said, “You can’t tell because he has already reached the realm of becoming one with nature. It looks ordinary, but in fact, every move he makes, from his movement technique, footwork, fist techniques, to even the changes in his eyes have

perfectly fused with his surroundings. in a battle in such ruins, no brick or wall is an obstacle for him; instead, these external objects aid him. This can’t be summarized with the word simple. You only see his fist technique being simple, but you don’t see the multi-dimensional world he has built. You only

see the fist, but he has the entire world in his eyes.”

“Is it that unbelievable?” No matter how carefully Youkai looked at it, he only found Jiuyang’s battle very fluid. He didn’t see anything about the multi-dimensional world.

“Yes, Saint Jiuyang is really very strong. It’s not as simple as borrowing the Guardian’s strength. Even if he suppresses his strength to the Epic stage, Zhou Wen’s chances of defeating him are pitifully low,” said Carlos.

“Then what about you? Can you crack his multi-dimensional world?” Youkai asked. Clearly, in his heart, Carlos was an existence comparable to Jiuyang.

In fact, although Carlos wasn’t famous, he had been entrusted with important responsibilities by the Cape family at a young age. One could tell his status in the Cape family from how he ruled Sunset City.

Such a person was naturally not a fool.

“My Guardian isn’t as strong as his,” Carlos answered.

“Then, ignoring Guardians, what about the martial arts realm?” Youkai asked again. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Twon’tt lose.” Although Carlos’ answer was somewhat ambiguous, he was confident that he wouldn’t lose against a figure like Jiuyang. It was obvious that he was very confident in his martial arts realm.

“I knew it. Saint Jiuyang, Ya of the Holy Spirit Association, and Immortal of the League of Guardians are definitely not your match. In the future, when you inherit the position of family head, our Cape family will definitely be able to recover its former glory,” Youkai said happily.

“How can it be that easy? There are too many powerful fellows in the Federation these days. I don’t have the confidence to beat those fellows you mentioned. Ignoring everything else, just fighting Jiuyang to the death would be my death.”

“That’s because your Guardian’s level isn’t as high as his. When the Guardian’s level is the same, he will definitely die,” said Youkai.

“That might not be the case. To be honest, even if our strength levels are the same, I’m not completely confident of defeating him. This person is like a Buddha. Mortals won’t be able to find any flaws in him. That’s why I said that I won’t lose, but I might not win either,” said Carlos seriously.

“Well, I have a question. You make Jiuyang sound so powerful. Why hasn’t he defeated Zhou Wen yet?” Youkai asked in puzzlement.

Carlos sighed and said, “Jiuyang is very strong, but Zhou Wen isn’t weak either. His standards aren’t much worse than Jiuyang’s. Furthermore, he keeps adopting a purely defensive stance. No matter how Jiuyang tries to entice him, he doesn’t counterattack. Under such circumstances, it’s very difficult for

him to make mistakes. He also doesn’t give Jiuyang a chance.”

“see. Now that you mention it, I understand. Just like in sieges of ancient cities, the defending side will have the advantage. The attacking side needs several times the military strength to storm the city. However, their strength is the same now. It will be very difficult for Jiuyang to win. Zhou Wen is good

at scheming,” Youkai said.

“That’s right. It’s just like soccer. When the weaker team fights the stronger team, they often choose to defend before counterattacking, This is the strategy Zhou Wen is using now,” said Carlos with a nod.

Godsfall, who was behind them, heard their conversation. He couldn’t help but size up Carlos in surprise as he thought to himself, I never expected such a figure to appear in the Cape family. Should I kill him first?

However, after some hesitation, Godsfall temporarily gave up on this thought. He had come mainly for Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts and didn’t wish to reveal his existence; that would make Zhou Wen wary.

Godsfall shared the same view as Carlos. Although Zhou Wen didn’t seem to be in a bad situation, just as Carlos had said, although weak teams could counterattack, strong teams might not give them a chance to counterattack.

It was especially so for a person like Jiuyang. He wouldn’t make any mistakes, much less give his opponent a chance. Therefore, Zhou Wen would definitely lose in the end.

The difference in realm is still too great. Zhou Wen doesn’t stand a chance. It won’t be too late for me to suddenly strike and snatch Zhou Wen’s Companion Beasts when Jiuyang defeats him. Godsfall watched the battle with the intention of watching the show.

The saber in Zhou Wen’s hand constantly changed its angle and blocked Jiuyang’s repeated attacks. He just wanted to see how deep Jiuyang’s realm went.

This was the first time Zhou Wen had encountered an opponent like Jiuyang. He was very curious.

However, in terms of realm, Jiuyang’s realm was much weaker than the vine sword’s realm. In terms of vantage point, Zhou Wen had the high ground.

However, Zhou Wen was somewhat interested in Jiuyang’s realm and wanted to make more observations.

Jiuyang’s realm was somewhat similar to the Nondisputatious Sword Intent of the three thousand sword intents. It seemed like he could draw on things as a reference to push the Nondisputatious Sword Intent to a higher level…
