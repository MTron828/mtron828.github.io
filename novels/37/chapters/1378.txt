Chapter 1379: Infinite Sword Beams

Getting Zhou Wen to consider how to defeat the enemy or how to defeat the enemy most effectively was much easier than letting him consider how to stoke fear in people.

In essence, Zhou Wen was a pacifist. If he hadn’t been born in such an era, he wouldn’t even be willing to kill a chicken, much less kill a human.

However, this was how the times were. It brought about heroes. Many times, people who ended up heroes might not be people who wanted to become heroes.

Alright, let’s start with the basics.?Zhou Wen really couldn’t figure out how to make the enemy feel a fear worse than death. He decided to start with the simplest solution.

With a thought from Zhou Wen, the Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array stirred as the star-like invisible sword beams fell crazily.

Zhou Wen had arrived late because he had spent a lot of time condensing invisible sword aura to set up the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.

The universe was infinite; same for the stars. It was the same for the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array. The more invisible sword beams that formed the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, the stronger it became. There was nothing redundant, nor would it be uncontrollable.

However, there was still a flaw between the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array and the real Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array.

The true Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array could automatically reform. In other words, all the shattered powers in the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array would automatically reform and be put to combat again.

The Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array didn’t work. Once the invisible sword beam was shattered, it couldn’t reform itself. Zhou Wen had to condense it himself a second time.

In contrast, the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array had its advantages. The Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array could absorb all the energy and reform itself, but the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array couldn’t. As for the Minor Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array being a protective stellar array, it could absorb large amounts of energy and provide it for Zhou Wen to use.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The dense rain of invisible sword beams constantly descended, attacking all the Guardians, including the Skysplit Tower. The invisible sword beams were everywhere.

The Guardians who were about to attack Zhou Wen suddenly realized that they were facing invisible sword beams that resembled a flood. They couldn’t divert their attention.

With such a large-scale attack, no one believed that Zhou Wen would be able to last long. They even believed that there would only be one round of invisible sword beams.

Such Essence Energy expenditure was not something a Terror-grade could withstand. To them, it was already unbelievable that Zhou Wen could release one round of invisible sword beams.

Every Guardian used all their strength to shatter the invisible sword beams that were rushing at them. With the determination to fight to the death, they wanted to break through the sword array and charge at Zhou Wen.

However, they soon realized that they had been too naive. The invisible sword beams constantly fell without any gaps as though they were infinite.

Pfft!

Just a few hits by the invisible sword beams left some Guardians collapsing. Blood spewed out of their mouths as the Guardian armor on their bodies was penetrated by the invisible sword beams.

Once they lost their ability to resist, they were constantly struck by the invisible sword beams and nailed to the ground.

Cave Era wanted to penetrate the invisible sword beams to attack Zhou Wen by using her Time Acceleration ability, but she was alarmed to discover that the invisible sword beams were so dense that it was almost gapless. Even if there was a gap, the narrow gap wasn’t enough to fit her body.

Helpless, Cave Era could only use all her strength to resist the invisible sword beams. She didn’t even have room to dodge.

The Guardians were like drowning in a torrent, alarmed and helpless.

This was under the condition that Zhou Wen didn’t have the intention to kill. Otherwise, more than half of these Terror-grade Guardians would have been killed.

Zhou Wen spared their lives not because of his kindness. He only wanted to observe their emotions and advance Slaughterer.

Just because he didn’t kill didn’t mean that he didn’t do anything else. As he attacked the Guardians, a large number of invisible sword beams struck Skysplit Tower and the Heavenly Ascension Platform.

In just a moment, the Skysplit Tower that had just been rebuilt to seven levels was nailed with dense, invisible sword beams.

Boom!

The seven-story Skysplit Tower finally collapsed under the relentless bombardment of invisible sword beams. The ground quaked as though it was the dawn of the apocalypse.

The Terror-grade Guardians that should have left others terrified were filled with terror.

Never had there been a human who was as terrifying as Zhou Wen. He had blasted apart Skysplit Tower with his own strength and suppressed dozens of Terror-grade Guardians.

At that moment, Zhou Wen was no longer human in their eyes.

Impossible… That fellow is definitely not a pure human…?Blood Shaman’s body was covered in injuries as he was horrified. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He could seal Companion Beasts, but Zhou Wen wasn’t using them at all. Just the power of the invisible sword beams gave him an overwhelming advantage.

Amidst the invisible sword beams, Blood Shaman felt like a tiny boat rocking in a stormy sea that could shatter at any moment.

Is the advancement as a pure human that strong??Uesugi Nao’s body was like a phantom. The invisible sword beams passed through her body without injuring her.

Great Skyfiend’s Terror transformation gave her the power and ability to ignore the invisible sword beams.

However, Uesugi Nao was reeling in shock and didn’t dare approach Zhou Wen.

More and more Guardians fell in the sword array. Skysplit Tower had already mostly collapsed. Even its foundation was about to be flattened.

They didn’t register any feelings during Skysplit Tower’s previous destruction because of the short time span in which it happened. It had been destroyed in one shot.

However, this time, it was blasted apart by invisible sword beams. The visual impact and shock of those who witnessed this scene far exceeded the previous time.

In their eyes, the present Zhou Wen was like a terrifying devil—nothing like a human.

The only thing that wasn’t affected by the invisible sword beams was the Heavenly Ascension Platform. All the invisible sword beams that struck the Heavenly Ascension Platform seemed to collide with a mysterious force. They shattered before they touched its pillars.

The figure on the rooftop was also surprised.

“Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array? That’s not right. It’s a little different. Strange. Without the power of a Calamity-grade Zone, how can one set up the Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array at such scale? It’s impossible for one’s Essence Energy to keep up with the expenditure. Even dimensional creatures born from Essence Energy can’t have such abundant Essence Energy…” The figure seemed to understand Jiang Yan’s words.

It wasn’t that Jiang Yan was lacking, but that the enemy was too terrifying.

Thinking of Human Sovereign, Deceit King, and Zhou Wen, it was indeed not easy for Jiang Yan to last until now with such humans as enemies of the League of Guardians.

“I think you can understand my predicament, right? I do need support,” Jiang Yan said.

“Calamity-grade Guardians can’t enter Earth. Even if they do, their strength will be greatly suppressed. It won’t be of any use,” the figure said after some thought.

“If you don’t mind, I’m willing to use myself as a container to welcome you into the world and cleanse the filth here.” Jiang Yan held his hand to his chest and bowed slightly as he spoke sincerely.
