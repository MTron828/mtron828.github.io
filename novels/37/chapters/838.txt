Chapter 839: Nutrition Fee

Translator: CKtalon

“This... Why don’t I return her to you?” Liu Yun felt a little guilty.

He originally didn’t believe it, but when he thought of what he had encountered along the way, Liu Yun felt that he had to believe it.

“I’ve been very busy recently. I don’t have time to take care of a child. Why don’t you help me take care of her for a few more days? Let’s talk when I return to Luoyang,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Take care my ass,” Liu Yun said gloomily.

“Eldest Senior Brother, don’t be anxious. At most, I’ll pay you for your labor. How about one Epic Companion Egg a day? It won’t be a problem to hire a female celebrity as a nanny for this price. It’s a bargain. What do you think?” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun slammed his palm on the table and said righteously, “Who do you think I, Liu Yun, am? I’m the great God of Theft, Liu Yun. Am I someone who takes care of children? Ignoring the fact that you give me an Epic Companion Egg every day, even if you give me a Mythical Companion Egg every day, I won’t do it. Just you wait. I’ll send Ya’er back to you now. Take care of her yourself.”

“Eldest Senior Brother, this isn’t appropriate. Look at how you brought her all the way here only to return her to me. Aren’t you losing out? I suggest that you continue taking care of her for a few more days,” Zhou Wen said.

“Why would I believe you? You are terrible. Wouldn’t it be worse if I took care of her?” Liu Yun said.

“Are you really returning her to me?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Of course. I, Liu Yun, never go back on my word,” Liu Yun said through gritted teeth.

“Alright, but you’ve been taking care of Ya’er for so many days. She must have lost weight from your hunger. You have to give her some nutrition money so that I can buy her some delicious supplements, right?” Zhou Wen extended his hand in front of Liu Yun.

Liu Yun was dumbfounded. He had seen shameless people, but he had never seen someone so shameless.

“You’re still demanding nutrition fees from me?” Liu Yun was extremely angry and aggrieved. His hands were trembling. “I’m the one who’s skinny because of hunger, alright? Damn it, I shat out everything I ate and vomited everything I drank along the way. I didn’t eat or say anything. I cried and laughed all day. In the middle of the night, I laughed until the entire hotel thought that it was haunted. Do you think it was easy for me? Let me tell you, that brat had a great time eating and drinking. I’m about to die, do you know that? Why are you asking me for nutrition fees?”

“Eldest Senior Brother, you shouldn’t be shirking your responsibility in this matter. You were the one who abducted her. You make it sound as though Ya’er abducted you. Don’t you feel ashamed?” Zhou Wen was finally completely at ease. He held back his laughter and said, “It’s fine if you don’t want to give it to me. Anyway, I plan on staying at Celestial Master Manor for a few days. If you have the ability, send Ya’er there.”

“If you don’t want her, I’ll kill her,” Liu Yun said ruthlessly.

“You dare to kill such a person? As long as you aren’t afraid of being unlucky your entire life, go ahead,” Zhou Wen said as he spread out his hands.

When Liu Yun thought of the days he had spent and how he would be spending the rest of his days in that manner, he immediately shivered.

Suddenly, Liu Yun’s angry face lit up with a smile. “Junior Brother, we’re all brothers. Why are you treating me like an outsider? Just tell me what my disciple-niece likes to eat. I’ll buy it for her. She can eat whatever she wants.”

“That’s more what an Eldest Senior Brother should be like.” Zhou Wen gave him a thumbs up. “By the way, Eldest Senior Brother, how do you transfer a Companion Beast to someone else with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art? I’ve studied it for a long time, but I don’t understand how it works.”

“Junior Brother, if you want to learn, I’ll definitely teach you. However, you have to condense a Life Soul with the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art first.” Liu Yun thought to himself, You don’t mainly cultivate the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. It would be strange if you could condense a Life Soul.

“The Life Soul of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art has already been condensed. Tell me, how should I use it?” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun’s eyes widened as he asked in disbelief, “What? Your Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art has condensed a Life Soul?”

“I just condensed it not long ago. It’s too difficult to cultivate. It’s still a Primordial Body,” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yun wanted to slap Zhou Wen in the face and smash his irritating face, but after some thought, he didn’t dare do it.

“Junior Brother, you must not joke. If you haven’t condensed a Life Soul of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art and try using my method, you will die.” Liu Yun still found it unbelievable.

“What’s your Life Soul’s name?” Zhou Wen asked Liu Yun.

“There’s no harm in telling you. My Life Soul is called Astral Soul. It means the soul of the stars in the heavens.” As Liu Yun spoke, he summoned a bit of starlight. The starlight flowed as though it was condensing thousands of stars.

“My Life Soul isn’t as resounding as your name. It’s called Fine Dust, but it should be similar.” Zhou Wen summoned his Fine Dust Life Soul.

Liu Yun was immediately stunned when he saw Zhou Wen’s Fine Dust. Although Life Souls were different and their abilities might be different, he could sense that it was undoubtedly a Life Soul condensed from the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art. There was no mistake.

“Junior Brother, won’t there be a problem with dual cultivating Essence Energy Arts?” Liu Yun swallowed his saliva and asked.

“Of course not. Are you going to tell me your method or not? If not, I’m going to Celestial Master Manor,” Zhou Wen said.

“Don’t be anxious. This method is a little complicated, but since you already have the Life Soul of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art, it shouldn’t be difficult for you to learn it.” Liu Yun explained his method to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was originally worried that his Life Soul was different from Liu Yun’s. He thought the abilities wouldn’t be completely the same, so he might not be able to learn Liu Yun’s method.

However, after hearing Liu Yun’s explanation, he realized that his worries were unnecessary. He could also use Liu Yun’s method. In fact, he didn’t rely on the Life Soul’s ability, but the ability of the Sky-Stealing Sun-Shifting Art itself.

Soon, Zhou Wen grasped Liu Yun’s method. He was just short of executing it.

“Junior Brother, continue practicing. I’ll fetch disciple-niece over.” With that said, Liu Yun ran off, afraid that Zhou Wen would ask him for something else. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He had always been a person who refused to suffer losses, but every time he encountered Zhou Wen, he would suffer losses. Now, he only wanted to distance himself from Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen didn’t really want anything from Liu Yun, so he didn’t stop him.

After a while, an employee knocked on Zhou Wen’s door and said that someone was looking for him.

Zhou Wen went out to take a look and saw Ya’er standing outside, but he didn’t see Liu Yun. Liu Yun was definitely afraid that Zhou Wen would extort him again, so he didn’t even dare show his face.

“Ya’er, did you suffer any grievances along the way?” Zhou Wen asked as he stroked her head.

Ya’er shook her head and took off the necklace around her neck before handing it to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He knew that this was the necklace that Ya’er had obtained from Liu Yun, but he didn’t understand why it was handed to him.

“Do you want me to help you put it away?” Zhou Wen asked as he took the necklace.

Ya’er shook her head again and pointed at the gem on the necklace. It looked like there was something wrong with the gem on the necklace.

Zhou Wen checked the gem on the necklace in puzzlement. After taking a closer look, he really found a problem.
