Chapter 1543: Jiuyang

Translator: CKtalon

Starlord Titan Gate’s body doesn’t appear to be Strength-type, but sound-type. That’s quite surprising, Zhou Wen thought to himself.?Furthermore, it should be Epsilon Ursae Majoris that represents sound, so why is Starlord Titan Gate a sound-type dimensional creature?

Zhou Wen was momentarily at a loss. However, he was certain that the sonar shockwave alone wasn’t enough to make the Golden Wyrm Scissors attack its owner. There had to be other forces behind this.

Zhou Wen entered the dungeon a few more times and quickly figured out what was going on.

Starlord Titan Gate’s roar was indeed a sound-type ability. Furthermore, this sound-type power wasn’t just a vibrational attack. It also had powers similar to bewitchment.

That power was useless against Zhou Wen who was wearing the Truth Listener earring, but the Golden Wyrm Scissors and other Companion Beasts couldn’t seem to withstand the assault of that power. As long as they were too far from Zhou Wen, they could easily betray him.

This left Zhou Wen depressed. His strength wasn’t enough to fight Starlord Titan Gate. Now, he was relying on his Companion Beasts to keep him going. It was a serious problem if his Companion Beasts betrayed him if they were too far from him.

From the looks of it, I’ll have to grind a few more times to study Starlord Titan Gate’s other weaknesses. Zhou Wen repeatedly grinded the Merak Star Palace. Although he was killed by Starlord Titan Gate every time, he still enjoyed it.

While Zhou Wen was studying Starlord Titan Gate, the various factions on Earth were still working hard on how to enter Dubhe Palace alive. All the fire-elemental dimensional creatures were repeatedly slaughtered by the various factions, pushing the prices of high-level fire-elemental defensive Companion Beasts to ridiculous levels.

Just as the various factions were gathering fire-elemental armor, the Cube’s screen stirred again. Someone had entered Dubhe Palace, and it was a human.

It was a young man in gorgeous armor who looked to be in his twenties or thirties.

“Human? How did he enter? How did he withstand such high temperatures?” No one knew the young man as they whispered.

“That’s strange. Isn’t it said that only four people can enter? Why is he alone?”

“What’s the point of entering? Under that blast of light, even the extremely powerful dinosaurs can’t withstand it. Death simply awaits him. From the looks of it, it should be a suicide squad from some faction used to scout the way, right?”

“There’s no doubt about it.”

“What a pity. He’s so handsome, but he’s dying just like that.” Women tended to focus on different things from men.

“Damn! I wonder which family’s the one letting such a young man die.”

The handsome young man couldn’t hear the discussions. Even if he heard them, he couldn’t be bothered.

He walked towards the Star Palace’s door one step after another, extended his flawless hands that were even more beautiful than a woman’s, and pushed open Dubhe Palace’s door.

Looking at Starlord Ravenous Wolf in the Star Palace, the young man walked in without any hesitation. When Starlord Ravenous Wolf saw someone enter the Star Palace, he unleashed a terrifying blast of light without a word.

The entire Star Palace and the square outside were instantly enveloped by the purple light blast. There were no blind spots.

The live broadcast of the Cube had been processed by the Cube. Even an ordinary person could see the young man’s figure in the blast of light.

Everyone thought that he was doomed, but in the blast of light, the young man didn’t show the horror and shock they had imagined.

The blast of light didn’t reduce his body to ashes. It didn’t even damage his hair. The armor on the young man’s body emitted a blinding light that was even more dazzling than the light blast. It was as though he was augmented by the sun.

“How… How is this possible… He’s actually fine… under such high temperatures and radiation… Is he still human?”

“When did such a young powerhouse appear among us humans?”

“Could he be Human Sovereign?”

Ordinary people discussed spiritedly as they guessed the young man’s origins. As for factions like the six families, they had already identified the young man’s background.

“Solar Holy Body. That young man should be from the Holy Land’s Sun God Holy Temple. I never expected the Holy Land to take action so quickly,” Zhang Chunqiu muttered to himself.

“Doesn’t the Family Clan of Gods also have the Solar Holy Body? Why can’t he be from the Family Clan of Gods?” Zhang Yuzhi asked in puzzlement as she watched the live broadcast.

“The Family Clan of Gods does have the Solar Holy Body from the Sun God Holy Temple, but the Family Clan of Gods doesn’t have that piece of armor he’s wearing. If I’m not wrong, that armor was transformed from a Guardian. Furthermore, it possesses the extremely pure power of the Sun. It’s even purer than the Solar Holy Body’s. I’m afraid only the fellows from the Sun God Holy Temple can create such a Guardian. The Family Clan of Gods doesn’t have it,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

The armor on the Saint from the Sun God Holy Temple emitted a divine solar glow, absorbing the power of the blast.

Under the attention of everyone, the Saint walked to the teleportation nexus and teleported out of Dubhe Palace.

Soon, the Cube’s screen switched to the rankings. It showed a new name. Furthermore, it was ranked ahead of Fire-Armored God—having obtained first place.

“Saint Jiuyang. He’s indeed from the Sun God Holy Temple,” Xia Liuchuan said with a frown.

Upon seeing this name, people realized that this young man was a Saint of the Holy Land.

“The Holy Land is indeed powerful. Any Saint can enter the rankings.”

Humans indeed rely on Guardians.

“That depends on who it is. Our Human Sovereign doesn’t need a Guardian.”

“I’m afraid Human Sovereign can’t enter. Otherwise, why hasn’t he appeared?”

“Aren’t you curious why that Jiuyang can enter the dimensional zone alone?”

No one answered his question. Some thought of a possibility, but it was so cruel that they couldn’t say it out loud.

A human had not only cleared Dubhe Palace, but he had also overtaken the Fire-Armored God, clinching first place. Instantly, he was in the limelight. The entire Federation was discussing Jiuyang.

“Only Saints from the Sun God Holy Temple can pass through Dubhe Palace so easily, right?”

“Jiuyang is too cool.”

“I’m afraid this is another powerhouse at the Human Sovereign level.”

Most people weren’t stingy with their praises. Even Professor Gu, who had always thought negatively, said in a program that Dubhe Palace was a dimensional zone tailor-made for Saint Jiuyang. It was unlikely any human could reach Jiuyang’s level.

If nothing went wrong, Jiuyang might very well obtain first place on the Cube’s rankings.
