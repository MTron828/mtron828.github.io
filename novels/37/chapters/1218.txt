Chapter 1219: I’m Not Good At Movement Techniques

Under Liu Yujin’s “escort,” Zhou Wen arrived in front of a mansion again. However, Hui Wan had taken the side door previously; this time, they were taking the main entrance.

This was the Hui family’s private residence, not Hui Haifeng’s office.

However, the area it covered was still rather sizable. After passing through the entrance, the first thing he saw was a large empty space. It was like a field with many soldiers training.

Zhou Wen glanced at the soldiers who were practicing and realized that they were practicing a movement technique that looked familiar.

Isn’t this Hui Haifeng’s Double True movement technique? Zhou Wen quickly recalled.

Seeing Zhou Wen watch the soldiers practice their movement techniques, Hui Wan said proudly, “Zhou Wen, what do you think of the movement technique?”

“It’s average,” Zhou Wen said casually.

Zhou Wen had partial responsibility for naming the Double True movement technique. Hui Haifeng also said that half of the movement technique was Zhou Wen’s. He was embarrassed to praise the potency of the movement technique as it would be akin to praising himself.

Furthermore, this movement technique was only considered average to Zhou Wen.

Hui Wan originally wanted to say that this movement technique was created by his father, but when he heard Zhou Wen say that, the latter half of the sentence was stuck in his throat as his face flushed red.

Liu Yujin couldn’t accept what he was hearing. He said coldly, “The Double True movement technique originated from the Hui family, but it’s used by many families in the Federation’s four districts. It’s a compulsory movement technique for the military. It has been verified by countless soldiers in numerous battles. Even an army as strong as Luoyang’s Sunset Army practices the Double True movement technique on a large scale. Sir, you said that this movement technique is average. I believe you possess a better movement technique than the Double True movement technique?”

Hui Wan also looked at Zhou Wen. Although he believed that Zhou Wen was very strong, his father was also his pride.

“I’m not good at movement techniques.” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to argue with them, nor was there a need to. Doing so would be no different from having his left hand fight his right.

It was to Zhou Wen’s surprise that the Double True movement technique was widely used in the military.

He had to admit that Hui Haifeng was a genius. Unfortunately, he had spent most of his energy on research and later became president. Otherwise, with his talent, his cultivation level would have been top-notch.

Seeing Zhou Wen admit defeat, Liu Yujin didn’t say anything else.

Hui Wan was somewhat disappointed. He had mixed feelings. Although he didn’t wish for his father’s reputation to be damaged, he also hoped that Zhou Wen would be as strong as possible. As long as that was the case, the value of what he learned from Zhou Wen would be higher.

With Zhou Wen admitting that his movement technique was lacking, Hui Wan naturally wasn’t happy.

“Young Master, His Excellency will be back soon. You and Mr. Zhou can wait in the living room for the time being.” Liu Yujin stopped Hui Wan from taking Zhou Wen to the backyard.

Hui Wan also knew that this matter needed Hui Haifeng’s permission. After some thought, he nodded in agreement and entered the living room with Zhou Wen as they waited for Hui Haifeng’s return.

“May I know which aspect you are good at? What would you be teaching Young Master?” Liu Yujin asked again after instructing someone to pour Zhou Wen some tea.

Zhou Wen thought seriously for a moment before answering, “I’m best at life-preservation. However, I can’t teach this ability to others. Even if I teach it, they won’t be able to learn it. Therefore, I only plan on teaching Hui Wan Essence Energy Arts.”

“Life-preservation?” Liu Yujin was slightly taken aback. When he heard that Zhou Wen was going to teach Hui Wan an Essence Energy Art, he couldn’t control his expression. He said seriously, “Essence Energy Arts are the foundation of everything. How can one randomly learn one? Even the scions of the six families have to go through repeated selections to find the most suitable Essence Energy Art for their cultivation. Is your Essence Energy Art better than the Essence Energy Arts of the six families?”

“I can’t say it’s better for sure. The quality of an Essence Energy Art depends mainly on a cultivator’s talent and ability,” Zhou Wen said.

Liu Yujin couldn’t help but sneer; he felt that Zhou Wen was resembling a charlatan.

Just as Liu Yujin was about to say something, he saw someone enter. It was none other than Hui Haifeng, who was dressed in formal attire.

“Your Excellency, this...” Liu Yujin was just about to warn Hui Haifeng that Zhou Wen was very problematic.

However, to his surprise, when Hui Haifeng saw Zhou Wen, he went over and punched him in the chest. “Why didn’t you inform me before coming to Holy City? You even abducted Little Wan. What’s the meaning of this? Are you jealous that I have a son? If you’re jealous, say it. I’ll get Little Wan to be your godson to prevent you from getting jealous.”

“It’s best if you keep him for yourself. I can’t afford handling someone like him,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Your Excellency...” Liu Yujin was somewhat surprised. From Hui Haifeng’s expression, he seemed to be certain that this was the real Zhou Wen.

Hui Haifeng didn’t wait for Liu Yujin to finish before introducing, “Yujin, this is my junior, Zhou Wen. Make a pass for him so that he can enter and leave freely to avoid trouble in the future.”

With that said, Hui Haifeng said to Zhou Wen, “Zhou Wen, I don’t care if you want it or not. Anyway, Little Wan is your nephew. Do as you see fit and teach him something. Let me think about it. Let’s start with movement techniques...”

“Dad...” Hui Wan’s expression was odd as though he wanted to say something. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Little Wan, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and give your Uncle Zhou your new year’s greetings. A red packet is definitely in order,” Hui Haifeng said with a smile.

“Aren’t you shameless? It’s only the middle of the year, alright? New year’s greetings? Isn’t that too early?” Zhou Wen was at a loss whether to laugh or cry.

“I don’t care. In any case, you have to teach him. I only have this one son. Do as you deem fit.” Hui Haifeng sat down and poured himself a cup of tea, ignoring Zhou Wen. He looked as though he was a scoundrel and that he was proud to have a son.

“Dad... He said that he’s not good at movement techniques...” Hui Wan found an opportunity and whispered.

Hui Haifeng nearly spat out the mouthful of tea he had just drunk when he heard that. “He isn’t good at movement techniques? If his movement technique isn’t good, is there anyone on Earth who has good movement techniques? He’s partially responsible for naming the Double True movement technique. Part of this movement technique was imitating him. Do you think his movement technique isn’t good?”

Standing beside them, Liu Yujin was dumbfounded. The Double True movement technique that Hui Haifeng had created had spread throughout the various military circles of the Federation. Even many people overseas were learning it, but it was actually an imitation of Zhou Wen’s movement technique.

“I didn’t say so. He said it himself,” Hui Wan waved his hand and pointed at Zhou Wen.

“What’s the point of lying to a child? This won’t do; my son’s young heart has suffered a heavy blow. This will leave an indelible shadow in his life. You have to pay...” Hui Haifeng looked like he was about to extort Zhou Wen’s last coin.

“I’ve already taught your son an Essence Energy Art. Is that enough compensation?” Zhou Wen said with a bitter expression.

“That’s more like it.” Hui Haifeng pressed Hui Wan’s head and asked, “Cultivate the Essence Energy Art your Uncle Zhou taught you. You don’t have to cultivate other Essence Energy Arts in the future.”

“Your Excellency, we spent so much effort to obtain the Essence Energy Art from the Family Clan of Gods and created the corresponding Mythical Serum...” Liu Yujin hurriedly reminded Hui Haifeng.

“With my junior’s Essence Energy Art, what do you need that crap for?” Hui Haifeng’s words left Liu Yujin’s mouth agape.

That wasn’t what Hui Haifeng had said in the past. The crap he was talking about was a top Essence Energy Art he had paid a huge price to obtain from the Family Clan of Gods.

Furthermore, in order to allow Hui Wan to cultivate it, he had specially created a Mythical Serum that could bestow a special physique on him. The price was unimaginable.

Now, without even knowing what Essence Energy Art Zhou Wen had imparted, Hui Haifeng had described it as crap. This change was too surprising.

“Junior, you can’t only teach him Essence Energy Arts, right? You have to teach him your movement techniques. I only have one son and you only have one nephew. You have to make sure he stays alive...” Hui Haifeng continued trying to squeeze Zhou Wen dry.
