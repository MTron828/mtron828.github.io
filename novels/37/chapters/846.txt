Chapter 847: Gathering at Fiend Tomb

Translator: CKtalon

After waiting for twenty-four hours, Zhou Wen entered the Fiend Tomb dungeon again. This time, he naturally didn’t dare provoke the Goddess Ba. All he did was eliminate the Ghoul Mask and Ghost Hornless. Then, he didn’t take further action. He maintained this state and observed if there were any other abnormalities around the Fiend Tomb.

There were no more problems with the Fiend Tomb even when Zhang Yuzhi invited him to participate in the so-called auction. As long as he didn’t continue digging, Goddess Ba wouldn’t wake up.

The auction was originally planned to be held in Dragon Tiger Town, but it had been changed to a temporary encampment near the Fiend Tomb.

Those who were invited were basically the best in the Federation. The members of the six families were all present, so the Cape family naturally didn’t look happy when they saw Zhou Wen.

The other families didn’t have much of a relationship with Zhou Wen. Instead, people from the North District’s Ultimate Family Clan took the initiative to greet him.

“Lance often mentions you and wishes to have a serious battle with you. If you have the time in the future, why don’t you pay a visit to the North District?” the elder from the Ultimate Family Clan said to Zhou Wen with a smile.

“I’ll definitely go if I have the chance in the future.” Zhou Wen had long had thought about the dimensional zones in the North District, but they were too far away, so he hadn’t gone.

However, now that Fine Dust needed him to take untaken paths to advance, he couldn’t avoid heading out more often in the future. It was a good opportunity to make a trip to the North District.

After chatting for a while, the person in charge of the Zhang family came over and began speaking.

It was similar to what Zhang Chunqiu had said. It roughly meant that the Zhang family wouldn’t charge any form of money for the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg. As long as they could help the Zhang family resolve the problem of the Fiend Tomb, they could take away the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg.

In fact, most people already knew the news in advance, so they weren’t surprised. After all, such a huge matter had happened to the Zhang family. It was impossible to keep it under wraps.

“Brother Zhang, we roughly know about the situation in the Fiend Tomb. However, there are some things that we can’t produce a solution for unless we see them with our own eyes,” the Dugu family’s representative, Dugu Wenxin, said.

“In a while, I’ll take all of you to the Fiend Tomb to view it. However, there’s something I want to make clear to everyone. The Fiend Tomb is extremely strange. Anyone who goes there might be struck by some unknown power. Who knows when they might unknowingly walk towards the Fiend Tomb and become a lifeless Fiend Stone Statue. Therefore, the people who go will face certain danger. We leave it up to you to decide. If something happens because of this, the Zhang family will not be held responsible,” the person in charge of the Zhang family said.

“Of course,” said Moses.

Most people expressed their willingness to take the risk. Only a small number of people stayed back.

The Zhang family produced a contract and got all who were willing to take the risk to sign it. Only then did they take the people who had signed the contract to the Fiend Tomb.

Zhou Wen was one of them. He was determined to obtain the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg, so he naturally couldn’t let go of this opportunity.

“You’ve already been there. It’s not like you don’t know the dangers there. Why are you still going?” When the others set off for the Fiend Tomb, Zhou Wen was stopped by Zhang Yuzhi.

“I’ve thought of a way. Perhaps it can eliminate the influence of the Fiend Tomb, so I want to give it a try,” Zhou Wen said.

“What method is it?” Zhang Yuzhi asked doubtfully.

Zhou Wen didn’t hide it. “I want to dig open the Fiend Tomb and eliminate the dimensional creatures inside. That way, I can naturally eliminate the negative effects.”

Zhang Yuzhi immediately shook her head and said, “You can’t do that. My ancestral Celestial Master said that if we release the creatures in the Fiend Tomb, it will definitely cause a calamity for the Zhang family. Our Zhang family has suppressed the Fiend Tomb for so many years, precisely because we do not want that to happen. How can we dig open the Fiend Tomb for our own selfish reasons?”

“According to my observations, there shouldn’t be only one terrifying creature in the Fiend Tomb. The one that’s affecting your Zhang family shouldn’t be the Ba that the ancestral Celestial Master mentioned. As long as we don’t alarm the Ba, we can dig shallowly into the Fiend Tomb and kill the dimensional creatures that are affecting your Zhang family,” Zhou Wen explained.

Zhang Yuzhi shook her head with a bitter smile. “Who knows what will happen if we touch the Fiend Tomb? Perhaps the terrifying creatures inside will escape. The consequences would be unimaginable. I’m afraid my family’s elders won’t agree to that.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Zhou Wen fell silent. He was already having so much difficulty convincing Zhang Yuzhi, so it would probably be even more difficult to convince the elders of the Zhang family. He couldn’t reveal the fact that he knew about the Fiend Tomb’s situation, so it would be troublesome to convince them.

Now, Zhou Wen could only take one step at a time. He was unwilling to give up the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg no matter what.

After witnessing the horror of the Terror transformation, if one encountered such a terrifying existence before they had the strength to fight it, the only option was to run.

As for the Earth Elemental Beast, it was undoubtedly the best weapon for escaping. It was highly likely that he would have to rely on it.

Of course, it was best if he didn’t encounter a creature that was capable of Terror transformation. However, if he did, he needed a way to survive.

In the future, more and more Guardians would appear. There would definitely be more Guardians with the ability of Terror transformation. Even more terrifying dimensional creatures might appear as well.

If it was really as the silver-haired Companion Beast said, the combination of a human and a Guardian might produce a Calamity-grade powerhouse, it would be even more terrifying.

To be so terrifying at the Terror grade, Zhou Wen couldn’t imagine what kind of power a Calamity had.

As Zhang Yuzhi wasn’t allowed to go to the Fiend Tomb, Zhou Wen had no choice but to chase after the group alone and follow the others.

Zhang Chunqiu had been guarding the Fiend Tomb recently. When Zhou Wen and company arrived, Zhang Chunqiu welcomed them and took them to the stone platform.

This stone platform had a huge backstory. It had been built by the ancestral Celestial Master. Up to today, it hadn’t been petrified by the Fiend Stones. The ground and mountain walls beneath the stone platform had long been petrified by the Fiend Stones. Only these eight stone platforms were safe.

Most of the people who had come were from the other five families. Some of them were from famous local wealthy families and famous freelance hunters.

Zhou Wen looked at them for a while, but he didn’t find Liu Yun.

Liu Yun probably won’t give up easily. If he’s not here, does he plan on stealing the Earth Elemental Beast Companion Egg? Zhou Wen was somewhat suspicious.

The others had already begun studying the problem of the Fiend Stones. They had already obtained detailed information from the Zhang family. Now was the time to showcase their abilities.

Some people summoned their Companion Beasts and tried to see if they could avoid being petrified. Others wanted to use some kind of power to cleanse the mountain walls and people.

An elder of the Cape family summoned a crucifix. After praying, the crucifix emitted a holy light and shone it at the Zhang family members who had turned into Fiend Stone statues. However, it was useless. The Fiend Stones weren’t purified.
