Chapter 1030: Frozen Period

Translator: CKtalon

“Bizarre God, if you have anything to say, you can tell me directly now. There’s no need to go through another person.” Although Frod felt that Bizarre God was somewhat odd and had some doubts, he never expected that Bizarre God hadn’t obtained Zhou Wen’s body. The person who had returned was the real Zhou Wen. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It wasn’t that Frod wasn’t sinister and cunning, but that he understood the power of Bizarre God too well. He had long formed the belief that Bizarre God was invincible, making it difficult for him to immediately accept anything else.

“Mr. Gaiman, did you pass on my message to him?” Zhou Wen ignored him and continued speaking to Gaiman.

When Gaiman heard Zhou Wen’s tone, he was even more certain of his guess. His voice trembled as he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “You... You are Zhou Wen...”

Frod jolted when he heard Gaiman’s words. Before this, he had never thought of such a possibility, but Zhou Wen’s tone and demeanor seemed to be different from the Bizarre God he knew.

Impossible. How can a human defeat Bizarre God? It’s useless no matter how many Mythical Companion Beasts one has. It’s impossible for humans to win... Frod couldn’t accept such a possibility deep down.

“If I’m not Zhou Wen, who else can I be?” Zhou Wen said calmly.

Everyone was alarmed when they heard that. Frod’s body trembled as he looked at Zhou Wen with a strange look.

“How did you escape?” Frod asked Zhou Wen in surprise. He naturally refused to believe that Zhou Wen could defeat Bizarre God. He only believed that Zhou Wen had used some strange ability to luckily escape the maze.

However, Zhou Wen continued ignoring Frod. He looked at Gaiman and continued asking, “Did you give him the message I asked you to pass on?”

“Yes,” Gaiman answered with a strange expression.

“That’s good.” Zhou Wen nodded and looked straight at Frod. “Frod, since you’ve received the message, I don’t need to say anything else. Do you want to end it yourself, or do you want me to do it?”

Frod’s expression darkened as he stared at Zhou Wen and said, “I did let you down regarding this matter, but since you escaped, I can give you some compensation to end this.”

“From the looks of it, you want me to do it?” Zhou Wen said to Frod.

“Zhou Wen, this is the Ultimate Family Clan. There’s no benefit in fighting me here. You didn’t suffer any losses anyway. I can give you a Mythical Companion Egg as compensation. Let’s end this matter. This will be beneficial to both you and me,” Frod said indifferently.

Zhou Wen pondered and didn’t say a word. Frod thought that he was already tempted and continued, “You don’t need to pay any price to obtain a Mythical Companion Beast and my friendship. This will be of great help to you in the future...”

“Frod, you sold me out, and even your blood descendant, to Bizarre God to escape the ice cavern, right?” Zhou Wen suddenly interrupted Frod.

Frod’s expression turned somewhat nasty, but he still said, “Even if I didn’t send someone in, Bizarre God would still rush out of the maze when the time came. When that happened, it would only bring about an even greater disaster.”

“In other words, you used me to exchange for a chance to escape from the ice cavern and regain your freedom?” Zhou Wen asked again.

“What are you trying to get at?” Frod was getting impatient.

“I’m a very fair person. Since you used me to exchange for your freedom, I’ll take back what belongs to me and send you back into the ice cavern,” Zhou Wen said calmly.

“Who do you think you are? You are only a human, not Bizarre God. Apart from gods, no one can defeat me. Not even the Hero King from the past.” Frod found it difficult to control his emotions when he heard the words ‘ice cavern.’

He had endured the ice cavern for so many years before finally escaping and being restored to a normal person. He hadn’t even taken a sip of alcohol. He definitely wouldn’t return to such a place.

Frod knew that Zhou Wen was very strong. From his point of view, the fact that Zhou Wen could escape from Bizarre God was a terrifying testament to his abilities.

However, no matter how strong Zhou Wen was, he was only a human. He still had a limit. With his strength and the Ultimate Family Clan’s present heritage, there was no need for him to be afraid of Zhou Wen.

He had even secretly decided that even if he had to pay a price, he would kill Zhou Wen here and eliminate this future threat.

“Ice Maiden.” Zhou Wen had no intention of wasting his breath on Frod. All he did was call out the ice maiden’s name.

At that moment, everyone realized that there was a beautiful young woman standing outside the door. Her face was as cold as ice, as though someone owed her a lot of money.

“Yes, sir.” Ice Maiden walked in and bowed at Zhou Wen.

In the Maze of Lies, Ice Maiden had been forced to sign an unfair contract with Zhou Wen. All she could do was obey his orders.

“Throw him into ice, but don’t let him die. Don’t let him escape either. Furthermore, he has to have his consciousness maintained. Can you do it?” Zhou Wen said.

“Yes,” Ice Maiden answered with certainty.

“Then do it. He owes me. Don’t you agree, Mr. Gaiman?” Zhou Wen asked Gaiman.

Frod was already enraged. Zhou Wen had a powerful Companion Beast, so he didn’t dare underestimate him. It would have been fine if Zhou Wen were to do it himself, but now, Zhou Wen had actually made a servant do it. Furthermore, she was such a young woman. This wasn’t contempt, but an insult to him.

“From the looks of it, I have been out of the limelight for too many years. The world has already forgotten how powerful the former hero of ice is,” Frod said before Gaiman could answer. At the same time, a terrifying ice aura erupted from his body. He summoned a frost dragon that prostrated under his feet. Its body suffused with an extremely terrifying ice aura.

The Frost Dragon was a top ice-type Mythical Companion Beast. It was perfectly compatible with Frod’s ice-elemental Essence Energy. With the mutual augmentation, their strength increased greatly.

“Back then, Bizarre God only turned me into an iceman by using a trick to trigger my own power of ice. It wasn’t his power of ice that surpassed mine. I want to see how you will seal me back into ice,” Frod said coldly.

Ice Maiden wasn’t in the mood to speak to Frod. She glanced at him and shot out an ice beam that instantly landed on Frod and the Frost Dragon.

In an instant, Frod and the Frost Dragon beneath him were frozen into ice sculptures.

The entire process was too fast. It was so fast that Gaiman and company had no time to react. They watched as Frod and the Frost Dragon turned into ice sculptures.

Even Frod himself remained standing there proudly, but his eyes were filled with boundless horror.

How is that possible? A top ice-elemental Mythical creature, Frost Dragon, was frozen into an ice sculpture? Gaiman and the other members of the Ultimate Family Clan knew how powerful the Frost Dragon was.

It wasn’t surprising if a Mythical creature defeated Frost Dragon, but to use the power of ice to freeze Frost Dragon was too terrifying.
