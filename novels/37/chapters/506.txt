Chapter 507 Black Cube

While Zhou Wen was grinding the dungeons, something strange happened in Luoyang City. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A crossroad in the city was blocked by a huge black cube. The black cube was about 50 meters long. It did not look like metal, but it did not look like stone or plastic either.

Strangely, no one knew when the black cube appeared. An Sheng, who was in charge of investigating the matter, looked at the nearby surveillance cameras and realized that the black cube had appeared out of thin air. It didn’t exist on the video then it appeared in the next second.

Such a strange matter was likely related to dimensional creatures. In order to prevent any accidents, An Sheng mobilized many experts from the Sunset army to research how to take away or destroy the black cube.

However, they tried many methods to no avail. They were unable to move the black cube away, nor were they able to damage it. Even the strongest destructive weapon and Essence Energy Skill that they could muster failed to damage the black cube one bit.

Some people dug up the concrete surface underneath the black cube and used some tools to move it away. However, they soon discovered that the black cube was actually suspended in midair. After the ground was dug open, it did not affect it at all and it still remained in position.

Although the black cube didn’t pose any threat, An Sheng still made preparations for the worst. He evacuated the nearby residents and temporarily isolated the area. He sent troops to guard it to prevent any accidents.

In less than two days, An Sheng received plenty of shocking updates. It wasn’t just Luoyang; many cities in the Federation’s four major districts had similar black cubes.

Now, everyone was studying the black cube. Up to now, no one had been able to determine what it was, nor could anyone destroy or move it.

Many people were worried like An Sheng. The black cube was like a ticking time bomb in the city. Who knew when it would cause a terrifying disaster.

"Strange phenomena are happening rather frequently. It looks like the days ahead will become more and more unpeaceful." An Sheng sighed.

An Tianzuo was reading the intelligence gathered from all over the world. Even the cities of the six major families had black cubes. Furthermore, the six families were helpless against them.

The six families had sent out Mythical Companion Beasts to destroy or figure out what the black cube was, but the outcome wasn’t promising. The strength of Mythical Companion Beasts was still unable to harm the black cubes.

An Tianzuo frowned when he read the intelligence.

Black cubes had appeared all over the world; this was clearly unusual.

"Did you notice that these black cubes only appear in areas where humans gather? There are no black cubes in the wilderness or dimensional zones," An Tianzuo said.

"You suspect that this is a conspiracy against humans?" An Sheng immediately understood what An Tianzuo was getting at.

"Although I don’t wish to see such a thing happen, the current phenomena’s analysis suggests that the black cubes are targeted at humans," An Tianzuo said with a heavy expression.

"We shall handle it, come what may. Overseer, when have you ever been afraid of anything?" An Sheng deliberately said in a relaxed tone.

An Tianzuo smiled and stopped talking about the matter. He then asked An Sheng, "How’s the progress at Zhuolu?"

"There’s no progress. After a long analysis, the experts have roughly guessed that the snake is the legendary Torch Dragon. The other Mythical creature is Qiongqi, one of the four mythical ferocious beasts. Apart from that, there’s no progress. Unless a Mythical power involves itself in this matter, it’s impossible to make progress in the temple," An Sheng said.

"How’s the mood of the person at home?" An Tianzuo paused before asking again.

"Same as usual. She eats whatever she likes and buys whatever she likes. However, I can tell that she can’t let this matter rest," An Sheng said.

After a long silence, An Tianzuo suddenly said, "How long will it take for a return trip to Zhuolu?"

An Sheng’s expression changed drastically when he heard that. "Overseer, you absolutely can’t do that. You definitely can’t go to Zhuolu. The strength of Torch Dragon and Qiongqi is still unknown. We haven’t even figured out what abilities they have. It’s too dangerous for you to go like this."

"If we don’t figure out if Grandpa is in the temple, the person at home will probably not be at ease," said An Tianzuo.

"Overseer, if you were to perish in there, Madam wouldn’t just be sad. Furthermore, there’s the bizarre black cube. A huge problem might happen at any time. This place needs you," An Sheng said solemnly.

An Tianzuo’s expression changed when he heard that. After a long while, he sighed and said, "Ah Sheng, in the past, we only wanted to have the An family and Luoyang completely in our control. At that time, we thought that we could no longer have any reservations and do whatever we wanted. Now that we have truly become the masters of this place, we realize that the matters to take into consideration have increased."

An Sheng looked at An Tianzuo and said seriously, "The lesser the burden, the fewer the matters to consider. Overseer, you’re burdened by too many things."

"Perhaps." An Tianzuo stood up and walked to the window. He looked at the black cube on the city’s streets as his expression turned more complicated.

...

Zhou Wen had fused multiple pets without obtaining a Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior that he was satisfied with. All he could do was use the unskilled Runic Heavy-Armored Warrior for the time being.

"Old Zhou, have you heard? A mysterious cube appeared on the streets in the city," Li Xuan said mysteriously when he came to Zhou Wen.

"What mysterious cube?" Zhou Wen had been focused on grinding dungeons recently. Apart from sending breakfast to Wang Lu, he hadn’t gone out, nor had anyone told him.

"You don’t know about it?" Li Xuan recounted the mysterious appearance of the black cube. "It’s not just our Luoyang. I heard that the same black cube has appeared all over the world. However, no one knows what it is."

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but frown when he heard that. He was also worried. If the black cubes contained a few Mythical creatures, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Li Xuan and Zhou Wen chatted for a while before he suddenly recalled something. He said to Zhou Wen with a smile, "Gu Dian looks like a ruthless character, but he’s actually quite timid."

"Why do you say that?" Zhou Wen asked curiously.

"Didn’t we organize an activity previously and got Gu Dian to come with us? Fang Ruoxi brought her pet cat over. That pet cat wasn’t afraid of Gu Dian’s ferocious appearance and even jumped onto him. When he saw the cat, the usually ferocious Gu Dian ended up sitting on the ground in fright. His legs were so weak that he couldn’t even stand up. He just sat and crawled backward as though he was afraid that the cat would eat him... Don’t you think it’s funny... That kid usually looks quite manly. I never expected him to be so timid..." Li Xuan didn’t notice Zhou Wen’s odd expression when he spoke.
