Chapter 1641 Mental Mutation State

It’s been a long time since I felt like this. Xiao recalled the past.

Ever since he impersonated Xiao, he had never revealed this side of himself. He had been acting as his impersonator. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

There were even times when Xiao questioned who the real Laughing Li was.

Only when he completely let go of himself did Xiao truly feel that he was still Laughing Li, the elite who could match An Tianzuo.

His eyes were bloodshot and his hair and beard were disheveled, but his eyes were extremely cold. He was like a devil that had escaped from the Hell of Avicinaraka. Having suffered hundreds of lifetimes of torture, he was filled with boundless anger, but his heart was already dead.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

Xiao’s Strength and Speed gradually exceeded his limits. He fought the Companion Beast crazily without being at a disadvantage. His attacks were even more ferocious than the Companion Beast’s.

Bang!

Amidst countless punches and kicks, Xiao managed to be slightly faster than the Companion Beast. He punched the Companion Beast in the face, sending it flying. It slammed into the rocks, causing a large area to collapse.

Xiao’s figure instant transmitted in front of the Companion Beast as his fists and feet bombarded it, constantly blasting its body into the rocks.

It was unknown how many attacks landed on the Companion Beast. When Xiao threw his final punch, the Companion Beast’s body slammed through the rocks, penetrated the ground, and flew into the air.

Xiao rushed out as well. He hovered in midair and looked at the Companion Beast lying in midair as though all its bones had been broken.

Just as Xiao was about to charge forward again, he realized that there were two people fighting in the air not far away.

Why is he here? Xiao was taken aback when he saw Zhou Wen. He never expected to see Zhou Wen here.

Zhou Wen was fighting Toad Immortal when he saw two things spew out from the ground. He was given a fright. On careful look, he saw that one of them was Xiao. The other creature looked very strange. He didn’t know what it was, but it was clearly a Companion Beast with a pure energy body. Alright, there’s indeed an ambush. You want to scheme against me? Dream on. Seeing Xiao and the Companion Beast rush out, Toad Immortal confirmed his thoughts. He retreated at high speeds as the money that filled the sky returned to his robe.

Toad Immortal looked down at the situation below and determined what to do next.

Zhou Wen didn’t chase after Toad Immortal. He also observed Xiao and the Companion Beast as he guessed what was going on.

Zhou Wen had always believed that the bee in the plant was the Companion Beast born from this planet.

However, from the looks of it, that wasn’t the case. The Companion Beast that rushed out of the ground with Xiao was likely the Companion Beast born from this planet.

Crack! Crack!

As the few of them had their own thoughts, the Companion Beast slowly moved. It cracked its neck as its distorted body gradually returned to normal. It stood up again, its body still as perfect as before as though it had never been injured.

Xiao frowned slightly. He had indeed used all his strength. Even the secret he had hidden had been exposed. Every strike’s offensive strength was enough to kill a Heaven-level expert.

The Companion Beast in front of him had recovered so quickly despite suffering so many attacks. Such a recovery ability was unbelievable.

However, what happened next surprised Xiao even more.

The Companion Beast’s body tensed up as its muscles showed. Its entire body seemed to be filled with explosive strength. Its eyes turned red, but it didn’t seem to have any emotions. This… This is… Xiao looked at the changes in the Companion Beast’s body and revealed a look of horror.

The Companion Beast’s present state was identical to his. This left Xiao very surprised.

After all, this state of his wasn’t a type of talent or Essence Energy Skill, but an effect on his body through a mental mutation.

This ability was the result of a mutation in the psyche. It couldn’t be cultivated, so it didn’t expend Essence Energy when used. It was Xiao’s unique ability.

Even An Tianzuo hadn’t mastered this ability. Although Xiao had already told him everything about how to enter this state, An Tianzuo just couldn’t do it.

Later, according to An Tianzuo’s analysis, Xiao’s mental state was related to his experience and thoughts. It wasn’t something others could imitate.

However, the Companion Beast had also entered such a state. It left Xiao in disbelief.

The Companion Beast’s figure flashed as it charged at Xiao. Its Strength, Speed, Constitution, and Essence Energy had entered a special mental state like Xiao’s. Its various abilities had increased again.

Although Xiao remained in the same state, he was once again suppressed. He was surpassed by Companion Beasts in every aspect.

An independent Heaven-level Companion Beast? After Toad Immortal saw the situation below, his eyes immediately revealed a look of greed.

The Companion Beasts produced by planets were somewhat different from the Companion Beasts on Earth.

Only humans could use the Companion Beasts on Earth. As for Companion Beasts born from the celestial bodies in the universe, they weren’t limited to humans.

Haha, my luck is here. I never expected a Companion Beast from this planet to appear! Toad Immortal immediately became greedy when he saw the Companion Beast.

This was also his true nature. Back at the Queen Mother of the West, if he hadn’t been greedy, he wouldn’t have been sealed in a mortal body like the toad and suppressed for so many years.

Toad Immortal had suffered greatly once after all, so he had learned his lesson. Although his greed ate at him, he still watched and didn’t rush forward immediately.

If it were in the past, Toad Immortal would have long rushed forward and swallowed the Companion Beast.

Toad Immortal didn’t want any Companion Beasts, but the pure energy in the Companion Beast’s body was extremely beneficial to him. It made him drool.

Although Xiao was suppressed by the Companion Beast, he still managed to put up a resistance.

The Companion Beast used abilities that he was best at. He knew those abilities too well. With this understanding, Xiao could circle around them.

Battles aren’t as simple as imitating. A sneer appeared on Xiao’s lips.

He roughly understood that this Companion Beast had the ability to imitate other creatures, but Xiao didn’t believe that such an imitation could defeat him.

I’ve been in the Holy Land for so many years. It was in no way a waste of my youth. The coldness in Xiao’s eyes intensified as his eyes turned crazier.
