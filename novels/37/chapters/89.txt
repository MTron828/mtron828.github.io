Chapter 90 Annihilating the General with One Palm

After killing the Jade-Eyed White Tiger, the Demonized General didn’t cease at all. It raised the strange spear in its hand and the crescent-like side blades swept across the Black Knight’s waist with terrifying flames. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Half of the Black Knight’s body was buried in the ground and it was unable to move at all. If it was struck, it was likely to have its head separated from its body.

“Leave quickly.” Li Xuan didn’t have the luxury of time to moan over his Companion Beasts. The Blade Demonized General was just too fast and powerful. The speed at which it killed the Jade-Eyed White Tiger and Black Knight had far exceeded Li Xuan’s expectations. If they didn’t pull open a distance quickly, it would probably chase after them again.

Suddenly, a figure flew over Li Xuan, arriving above the Demonized General in a blink of an eye. Then, it was split into two.

Zhou Wen had summoned the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and was riding on its back, rushing straight for the Demonized General’s head.

The Demonized General waved its left hand, shining out a lightning-like blade beam that moved at an inconceivable speed. The instant it smashed down, the beam had arrived in front of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant.

The Silver-Winged Flying Ant spread its four wings and phased away with silver, dreamy light. Its speed was instantly raised to a terrifying level, allowing it to dodge the Demonized General’s blade beam.

An Jing, who was prepared to take action, was stunned. The Blade Demonized General’s Astral Slash Blade was famous for being fast, accurate, and mighty. Yet, that Companion Beast had managed to dodge it. It truly caught her by surprise.

To have a non-avian Companion Beast that has a flight Primordial Energy Skill is rather rare. An Jing stopped in her tracks as she watched the battle.

When the Demonized General missed the Silver-Winged Flying Ant with its blade, the strange spear in its hand swept flames up into the sky, hoping to sweep the Silver-Winged Flying Ant and Zhou Wen down.

However, the Silver-Winged Flying Ant agilely changed directions in midair, dodging the Demonized General’s strike. At the same time, its stinger shot out Magical Needle at the Demonized General’s head.

However, before it reached the Demonized General, it was cleaved apart by the Astral Slash Blade it sliced out with its left hand.

Zhou Wen controlled the Silver-Winged Flying Ant as he battled the Demonized General. Using its speed and flight capabilities, and Silver Wing Flash, he dodged all of the Demonized General’s attacks.

“Old Zhou, that Companion Beast is awesome. Where did you get it from? Help me get one in the future.” Li Xuan’s eyes glimmered as he slipped effortlessly into address Zhou Wen affectionately.

To use speed to dodge the Demonized General’s attacks made the Silver-Winged Flying Ant a pinnacle speed-type Companion Beast.

An Jing, Li Weiyang and company also noticed the value of the Silver-Winged Flying Ant, but An Jing was able to figure out more.

That strange flying ant is a top speed-type Companion Beast at the Legendary stage, but to be able to dodge the Blade Demonized General’s attacks so perfectly isn’t something that can be done with speed alone. Zhou Wen’s control and predictions are all excellent. An Jing didn’t let her hatred for him affect her own judgment. She could tell how formidable Zhou Wen really was.

With Zhou Wen fighting the Demonized General, Li Xuan finally seized the opportunity to get the Black Knight to escape from the ground. Just as he was about to order it to help, he saw Zhou Wen jump off from the Silver-Winged Flying Ant’s back.

“Holy sh*t, Old Zhou, what are you trying to do?” Li Xuan jumped in fright. For the Mortal Zhou Wen to lunge at the Demonized General looked no different from courting death.

Li Weiyang and the other students had their hearts pounding nervously as though they were about to leap out of their chests. Even An Jing’s breathing sped up.

From An Jing’s point of view, Zhou Wen’s actions were too rash. Furthermore, there weren’t any substantial effects.

He was only at the Mortal stage. With Strength at the Mortal stage, even if it was boosted by Primordial Energy Skills, striking a Demonized General’s helmet probably didn’t deal it much damage.

Zhou Wen wore a stoic expression as his body rapidly plummeted. He swung his arm that had been enveloped by the skeleton bracer, striking straight at the top of the Demonized General’s head.

This leap looked like a risky move, but in fact, Zhou Wen had already simulated it hundreds of times in his head. Ever since he had fought the word-engraved Demonized General, he had been thinking of a way to kill them.

The only possibility was to first kill the Blade Demonized General. As for the Paper Demonized General, he temporarily had no means of killing it.

This leap had been calculated by Zhou Wen countless times before he deduced the opportunity.

Back when the Silver-Winged Flying Ant kept flying, it had made the Demonized General run through all its moves. Its Primordial Energy Skills had all been used and it couldn’t immediately use them again. All those powerful moves prevented it from instantly retaliating against Zhou Wen.

Bang!

Zhou Wen leaped down headfirst as his palm struck the Demonized General’s helmet.

If it were only an ordinary Mortal Primordial Energy Skill, it wouldn’t be able to tear through the helmet’s defense with the skeleton bracer’s augmentation.

However, Zhou Wen’s Ashen Palm at Rank 10 was different. This was a palm with a cold, explosive might. It could generate a penetrative effect at short distances.

Although this palm looked like it had smacked the helmet, its force had already penetrated into the Demonized General’s head, striking its brains.

With the success of the attack, Zhou Wen pressed down on the Demonized General’s helmet and used the reactionary force to retreat several meters. The Silver-Winged Flying Ant was already waiting there for him as he somersaulted and landed on its back, his eyes staring intently at the Demonized General.

As he had never attempted it in-game, he wasn’t sure of the effects of this palm strike.

An Jing, Li Xuan, and the other students were also staring at the Demonized General. They felt that the palm didn’t seem to have much of an effect as there wasn’t any mark on its helmet.

But the next second, the Demonized General looked up and spewed a mouthful of blood before collapsing from its horse. The red horse neighed as it exploded, scattering its flesh and blood everywhere.

He had managed to slay a word-engraved Demonized General! When An Jing saw the horse explode, she knew that the Demonized General was definitely dead.

Li Xuan yelled, “Did anyone do a recording? Did anyone record that battle? How long did he take?”

The school’s test missions required video proof. Although he didn’t know how long Zhou Wen had taken, it didn’t feel like he took more than ninety seconds.

“I did,” a girl beside Li Weiyang said meekly.

The few of them had come to complete a test mission, so they had a video recording the entire time. They had also recorded the battle that had just finished.

Li Weiyang got the girl to play the recording as they looked over. He had taken 79 seconds.

“Old Zhou, you took 79 seconds to kill a word-engraved Demonized General. You are really awesome!” Li Xuan yelled at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen was in no mood to care about the numbers. He ran straight to the dead Demonized General, hoping to find a dimensional crystal or Companion Egg from its corpse.

Pulling apart the Demonized General’s helmet, he saw red and white fluids flow out. Amidst that was a resplendent object.
