Chapter 1199: Saint

When An Sheng and An Tianzuo entered the Asura Realm, their encounter was identical to Zhou Wen’s. Under such circumstances, it was impossible for them to wait for Zhou Wen to enter and move together. All they could do was charge in.

An Sheng suspected that Ouyang Lan and company had entered the Asura Realm. It was so dangerous here that even if Ouyang Lan and company had really entered, they might have retreated.

After all, such a battlefield was too dangerous. There were Asuras everywhere, giving one no time to rest.

However, An Tianzuo seemed to be certain that Ouyang Lan had taken this path. He kept rushing deeper into the Asura Realm.

Wearing his armor, An Tianzuo was a Terror-grade existence. He held a Gatling firearm in his hand as he crazily swept at the ghoul-like Asuras. Wherever he passed, large swaths of Asuras fell, their bodies peppered with holes.

Unfortunately, the Asuras stood up again shortly after. Their bodies returned to their original states as they lunged forward again.

Among the Asuras, there was no lack of Mythical existences, but when faced with An Tianzuo’s firepower, their bodies exploded before they could even charge forward. Occasionally, one or two would slip to the cracks, but they were killed by An Sheng.

The two of them charged forward and after an unknown distance, they saw a strange altar in front of them.

The altar was made of twelve black stone pillars, and on the stone pillar in the middle stood a flag.

The flag fluttered in the wind, and there was an anchor symbol drawn on it.

However, An Tianzuo and An Sheng didn’t look at the flag. Their eyes were focused on the stone pillars.

A few people were tied to the different stone pillars. On one of the stone pillars was Ouyang Lan. The people on the other stone pillars were the Sunset Army generals who had followed Ouyang Lan to Netherworld City.

They were chained to the stone pillars. All of them were on their last breaths and most of them had already fainted.

When he saw the whip marks on Ouyang Lan and company and their ripped clothes with blood seeping out of the cracks, An Tianzuo’s eyes instantly turned cold.

Gatling flames spewed out as the firepower seemed to become even more violent. It blasted the horde of Asuras ahead, turning them into sieves. Even existences as powerful as Mythical creatures were as weak as paper in the storm of bullets.

An Tianzuo flew up and wanted to rush up the altar to save Ouyang Lan and company.

Suddenly, a cold beam of light appeared and shot towards An Tianzuo’s chest like a phantom. The cold beam was too fast and reached his heart in the blink of an eye. An Tianzuo didn’t have the time to adjust the Gatling gun’s muzzle.

Clang!

The broadsword in An Tianzuo’s other hand struck the cold beam like a ghost.

Sparks flew, revealing the cold beam’s true face—an arrow. As the tip of the arrow collided with the hilt, sparks flew everywhere. An Tianzuo uncontrollably took a step back as the arrow deviated from its trajectory and hit the ground beside him.

Boom!

A huge crater was blasted into the ground, but the arrow vanished.

An Tianzuo frowned as he looked in the direction of the altar. He saw a person wearing purple armor and a ghoul mask standing on a stone pillar.

He held a hunting bow in his left hand with his other palm open. The arrow that vanished appeared in his palm and was gently pinched by his fingers.

“You’re finally here? I’ve been waiting for you for a long time,” the person said indifferently as he looked at An Tianzuo.

“Who are you?” An Tianzuo asked slowly as he stared at the person.

The person had the aura of a Guardian, but there was no inkling of a human aura. It was unknown if there was a human inside the armor.

“Saint... Xiao...” the person said calmly.

“You were waiting for me?” An Tianzuo didn’t immediately rush towards the altar but asked coldly.

“Yes.” Xiao nodded slightly.

“You forced them here to lure me here?” An Tianzuo continued asking.

Xiao nodded before shaking his head. “Partially. You need to die; likewise for them.”

“Why?” An Tianzuo wasn’t outraged as he continued asking.

Xiao didn’t answer, but he suddenly laughed. “People say that one should give birth to a child like An Tianzuo. From what I see today, you’re nothing much. Your mother is hung here by me, her fate unknown, but you still have the mood to chat with me.”

An Tianzuo’s expression didn’t change as he looked at Xiao and said, “Since you aren’t willing to tell me, let me guess.”

“Oh, please be my guest.” Xiao looked at An Tianzuo with interest.

“You want to kill us because we investigated the expedition team.” An Tianzuo’s tone wasn’t a question, but an affirmative description.

“Is that all?” Xiao didn’t deny it. It wasn’t difficult to guess this conclusion.

“You come from the Holy Land,” An Tianzuo continued.

“Not bad.” Xiao nodded in acknowledgment. He looked at An Tianzuo with a smile and said, “From the word ‘Saint’ I just mentioned, you can confirm that I’m from the Holy Land. This isn’t difficult to guess.”

“You come from the Trajectory Holy Temple,” An Tianzuo said again, unmoved.

Xiao was somewhat surprised as he looked at An Tianzuo and asked, “How did you know that I came from the Trajectory Holy Temple?”

“It’s not difficult to guess. Figure it out yourself,” An Tianzuo said indifferently. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Xiao laughed. “You are indeed an interesting person. I can’t bear to kill you. Unfortunately, you have to die here today. An Tianzuo will no longer exist in this world.”

With that said, Xiao raised the hunting bow in his hand and nocked the arrow. However, he wasn’t aiming at An Tianzuo, but Ouyang Lan on the stone pillar.

“It’s best if you don’t move. You should know that with my arrow speed, I can kill her before you arrive. If you want her to live for now, break an arm. Then, I can give you a chance to fight me,” Xiao said.

“You’ve already lost. You don’t have the confidence to defeat me,” An Tianzuo said as he looked at Xiao.

Xiao said indifferently, “I just don’t like trouble.”

“Is that so?” An Tianzuo’s hand that was holding the sword suddenly moved. He slashed at his right arm and severed the arm that was holding the Gatling.

Clang!

The Gatling along with the arm fell to the ground together, blood flowing everywhere.

“Overseer!” An Sheng was alarmed and furious.

“Do you still want my left arm? I can give it to you as well,” An Tianzuo stopped An Sheng and said coldly.

Xiao’s eyes narrowed slightly as he slowly moved the bow in his hand away from Ouyang Lan and slowly aimed it at An Tianzuo. He said coldly, “An Tianzuo, Overseer An, Luoyang’s God of War. You have the right to be arrogant, but you chose the wrong time and place to be arrogant. You even chose the wrong person.”

“Many people have said such words to me, but they are all dead,” An Tianzuo said indifferently.
