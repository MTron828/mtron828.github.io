Chapter 1772 Grim Demon’s Story

On the divine mountain, Zhou Wen got Demonic Neonate to summon Grim Demon as he asked with a smile, “Grim Demon, how have I treated you all this while?”

“Not… bad…” Grim Demon stammered, but he cursed inwardly. You still have the nerve to ask how you’ve treated me? Don’t you know how you’ve been treating me?

“It’s just not bad?” Zhou Wen said with a sullen expression.

Grim Demon was alarmed as he hurriedly forced a smile and said, “Not only is it not bad, but it’s really good. It’s so good that I’m speechless. It’s like having a second parent.”

Only then did Zhou Wen nod in satisfaction. “Since you know that I’m really good to you, it’s time for you to do something.”

“What do you want?” Grim Demon looked at Zhou Wen warily.

“Take a look at this place first,” Zhou Wen said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“This is… the divine mountain of the Gods…” After Grim Demon carefully looked around, his expression changed drastically. “Why did you bring Master to such a place… Don’t you know…”

Halfway through his sentence, Grim Demon seemed to realize something and suddenly shut up.

“What don’t I know?” Zhou Wen looked at Grim Demon and said slowly.

“Nothing.” Grim Demon shut up, clearly unwilling to reveal anything more related to Demonic Neonate.

“You can choose not to say anything, but it’s best you figure out what’s going on.” Zhou Wen raised the golden trident in his hand in front of Grim Demon and continued, “This is the only surviving God on the divine mountain. And now, he has become my weapon. As for me, I’ve been left on this divine mountain by the Cube. I can’t return to Earth. I think you know what will happen next better than me.”

“What did you say? This is a weapon formed by a golden God. Would a golden God choose to become your weapon?” Grim Demon wore a look of disbelief.

“Of course, he became my weapon partially thanks to Neonate,” Zhou Wen said.

“What do you mean by partially thanks to Master? I think it’s clearly all thanks to Master,” Grim Demon immediately corrected.

“No matter who contributed, I’m now the wielder of this weapon. Furthermore, I’m now stuck in the dimension. Neonate naturally has to stay here. Now, the entire dimension knows that I’ve become the owner of the divine mountain and possess this golden weapon.”

“Fool, didn’t I tell you not to expose Master’s existence? How can you take her to participate in the Cube battle…” Grim Demon cursed in exasperation.

“Apart from that, do you have anything else to say? If not, wait to die with your master,” Zhou Wen interrupted Grim Demon and said expressionlessly.

Grim Demon immediately fell silent as his expression changed for a while before he sighed and said, “You’ve gotten it wrong. Even if I tell you everything about Master, it will still be useless for your current situation. It might even be more dangerous. If you expose Master because of this, I can only say that you are really stupid.”

“If you don’t tell me, how do you know that it won’t help me?” Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush as he said casually.

“Alright, actually, what I know isn’t bad, but there’s something I can tell you with certainty. The reason the divine mountain and the Gods vanished overnight has a lot to do with Master,” Grim Demon said helplessly.

“Continue.” Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be delighted when he saw Grim Demon finally relent.

Zhou Wen had grown increasingly curious about Demonic Neonate’s origins. However, there were too few people who knew her origins. Grim Demon was definitely the one who knew most about the truth, but he was too tight-lipped. Even if Zhou Wen threatened him with his life, Grim Demon refused to say a word. It was rare for him to be willing to say anything about Demonic Neonate.

Grim Demon wore a conflicted expression. After a while, he said, “I’ll tell you a story.”

“I’m all ears,” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

“In the past, there was a hunter who hunted every day for survival. One day, when he was hunting, he saw a wolf biting a rabbit. As for the rabbit, it was a mother who had just given birth. In its nest, there were a few kits who were clamoring for food. When the kits saw their mother by the nest, they crawled out of their nests, hoping to be breastfed, but they couldn’t understand that not only was their mother in danger, but even they themselves would become food for the hungry wolf.” With that said, Grim Demon stared at Zhou Wen and asked, “If you were the hunter, what would you do?”

“Kill that wolf and save the rabbit and its kits,” Zhou Wen answered.

“Alright, if the hunter saves the rabbit and its children, that wolf will go hungry, and it might also be the mother of a few wolf cubs. Without food, it and its children will starve to death. If you know this, will you still save the rabbit and those kits?” Grim Demon asked again.

“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered without any hesitation.

This was an unsolvable problem to begin with. From different angles, be it whether Zhou Wen saved them or not, it was wrong. Therefore, he didn’t need to think too much. All he needed to do was be himself.

“Very good. You saved that rabbit and its kits. The wolf was killed by you, and the wolf cubs starved to death. After that, the rabbits no longer had any natural enemies. They constantly reproduced and their numbers constantly increased. The resources originally available were no longer able to satisfy the rabbits’ appetite. They couldn’t fill their stomachs, so the rabbits would group up and eat the crops you planted, causing the crops you planted to be wiped out by harvest time. You wouldn’t have any food to pass the winter. What would you choose?” Grim Demon continued posing difficult questions to Zhou Wen.

“In that case, I made the wrong choice from the beginning. I shouldn’t have saved that rabbit.” Zhou Wen wasn’t usually a stubborn person. Although he could come up with reasons to refute Grim Demon, he didn’t do so. Instead, he changed his train of thought.

“Alright, if you don’t save the rabbits, the wolf will have plenty of food after hunting the rabbits. The wolf cubs will quickly grow and give birth to more wolves. When that happens, the entire mountain will be filled with wolves. Ignoring hunting in the mountains, even living in the mountains will be very dangerous. Perhaps the wolf pack will rush into your house and tear you apart for food. Is this the outcome you want?” Grim Demon sneered.

If it were an ordinary person, they would only blame Grim Demon for coming up with unsolvable problems. However, Zhou Wen didn’t think so. After some thought, he said, “I can tame that wolf. At the same time, with the help of the wolf, I can hunt a certain number of rabbits and maintain the number of rabbits within a certain range. This way, the rabbits will not overbreed and the wolves won’t be a threat to me.”

Only then did Grim Demon nod as though he was pleased with his answer. “I hope you can make the same choice when you encounter the same thing in the future and not act on impulse.”

“And then?” Zhou Wen didn’t wish to discuss this with Grim Demon. All he wanted to know was what Grim Demon’s story had to do with Demonic Neonate.
