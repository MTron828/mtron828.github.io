Chapter 1815 Companion Beast that Counters Demon Bull

Zhou Wen tried a few more times, but the outcome was about the same. As long as the Demon Bull shone its nose ring at him, his screen would turn black no matter how powerful he was.

Even Demonic Neonate was useless. Demonic Neonate’s Demonic Sword, Heaven Shrouding Bell, and other items were restrained by the nose ring.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to put down the game and check the information regarding the Vajra Chakram again.

In Journey to the West, Zhou Wen saw some descriptions of the Vajra Chakram’s abilities. This thing could actually seal all sorts of Dharma treasures in the world. Immortals, deities, or buddhas were useless against it. It could seal with 100% accuracy.

The Demon Bull’s nose ring in real life seemed to be even more ferocious than the Vajra Chakram described in Journey to the West. Not only could it be used to seal Dharma treasures, but it could also directly seal humans and Companion Beasts.

However, in Journey to the West, Zhou Wen had also found a way to restrain the Vajra Chakram. According to Taishang Laojun, without the Banana Fan, even he couldn’t restrain the Vajra Chakram.

Zhou Wen really had the Banana Fan. His Banana Fairy was the incarnation of the Banana Fan. However, her level was too low. Even if her element was strong against it, the difference in levels made it useless. Therefore, Zhou Wen planned on leveling up Banana Fairy to see if he had a chance of cracking the Demon Bull’s nose ring.

.....

Although he couldn’t kill the Demon Bull, he could thankfully kill the True Demon Crane as he pleased. All Zhou Wen could do was grind the True Demon Crane again and again, hoping that something useful would drop.

It had to be said that there was really a problem with the drop rate of Apocalypse-grade creatures. Many dimensional crystals dropped, but there was nothing useful.

Those dimensional crystals could only be food for Imperial Lord Behemoth and be used to raise the stats of other Companion Beasts. They weren’t of much use elsewhere.

Thankfully, there were no time restrictions for the Mount Laojun dungeon. It could be grinded indefinitely. Otherwise, it was unknown how long it would take to obtain something useful.

During the period when Zhou Wen was grinding dungeons to raise Banana Fairy’s level, the number of break outs across the Earth increased dramatically. Most humans had already moved into dimensional zones. There were more creatures outside than humans. Things had gone almost topsy-turvy.

Who’s actually the owner of Earth? Zhou Wen was somewhat worried about how long humans could last.

Once those terrifying dimensional zones were completely breached, dimensional creatures like Demon Bull would rush out of the dimensional zones. No human could match them.

Raising Banana Fairy’s level started very smoothly. Soon, she reached the Heaven realm at the limits of the Calamity grade. Her stats were considered maxed out, but compared to Companion Beasts like Mystic Thearch and Truth Listener, she was still much weaker. Her various stats were only at 400, nothing as terrifying as 999.

He led Banana Fairy to fight the Demon Bull again. It was unknown if it was because Banana Fairy’s stats were too low or if there was a difference between reality and what was written in the books, but the Banana Fan couldn’t restrain the Demon Bull’s nose ring. Zhou Wen died tragically in-game again.

“Old Zhou, have you heard? Someone discovered a Peach Garden dimensional zone. Eating one of the peaches can increase one’s lifespan by three years. Someone also discovered a ginseng fruit Tree dimensional zone and ate one to gain eternal youth…” Li Xuan recounted the various rumors from the outside world. All sorts of news spread everywhere with the emergence of new dimensional zones.

A lot of news became more and more exaggerated the more it spread. It was unknown which was true and which was false.

“Are you listening?” Li Xuan said gloomily when he saw Zhou Wen gaming with his head lowered.

“I’m listening. Those are just rumors. We don’t know if they are true or not. There’s no need to waste time verifying them one by one,” Zhou Wen said.

“I don’t dare say anything else, but the dimensional zone with the ginseng fruit tree is definitely real. A friend of mine went in, but he didn’t get to eat the ginseng fruit. One of his companions ate it. I heard that his white hair turned black, and he became twenty years younger in the blink of an eye…” Li Xuan’s saliva splattered as he spoke.

“You want to go?” Zhou Wen looked up at Li Xuan. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Hehe, it’s indeed a little boring staying in the city all the time. It’d be good to go out for a walk,” Li Xuan said as he scratched his head.

“Then let’s go out for a walk. It’ll be good to get some relaxation time.” Zhou Wen hadn’t made any progress and was also somewhat stifled.

“Why didn’t you say so earlier? You made me waste my breath. I’ll make the preparations.” Li Xuan went out to make arrangements before heading out with Zhou Wen.

The tourist attraction, Wuzhuang Daoist Temple, had been enveloped by a mysterious force ever since the advent of dimensional zones. Humans could no longer enter. Not long ago, the door to Wuzhuang Daoist Temple suddenly opened. Thousands of rays of light bloomed from inside in a way more dazzling than the sun. They lasted for seven days and seven nights before dissipating.

After that, someone entered Wuzhuang Daoist Temple and found a ginseng fruit tree inside.

Rumor had it that a person obtained a ginseng fruit and immediately changed from an elder to a young man in his twenties after eating it.

From then on, the originally deserted Wuzhuang Daoist Temple became crowded.

However, not many people could come out of Wuzhuang Daoist Temple alive. None of the people who came out had their youth restored.

Now, the area in front of Wuzhuang Daoist Temple had returned to its usual bleakness. Occasionally, a few people would appear outside the temple, but they would disappear after entering

One day, two men brought a girl to the entrance of Fifth Manor. It was Zhou Wen and Li Xuan. Sitting on Zhou Wen’s shoulder was Demonic Neonate. “Immortal Abode of Immortality; Daoist With Longevity Rivaling the Heavens.” Li Xuan looked at the couplets on both sides of the door and couldn’t help but recite them.

“Human Sovereign, are you here to enter the Wuzhuang Daoist Temple to seek the ginseng fruit that grants immortality?” A voice sounded from the side. Zhou Wen and Li Xuan turned their heads and saw two men walking towards the door. They were none other than Zhang Chunqiu and Xia Liuchuan.

“Aren’t you guys here for the ginseng fruit as well?” Li Xuan curled his lips.

“Of course.” Zhang Chunqiu smiled and said, “Since we are fated to meet, why don’t we form a team?”

“Fate my ass. Don’t tell me you were waiting here for us?” Li Xuan seemed to come to a realization as he said, “F*ck, don’t tell me you were the ones who leaked this information to me? I remember now. That fellow has always had an ambiguous relationship with your Zhang family.”

“I just want to share the fruit of immortality with the two of you. If there’s anyone who can crack Wuzhuang Daoist Temple today, I’m afraid it’s only our Human Sovereign.” Zhang Chunqiu had no intention of hiding it and readily admitted it.

“Then what do I need you for? Why should I share it with you?” Li Xuan snapped back.

“We naturally have to share good things with good friends.” Xia Liuchuan continued, “Besides, without us leading the way, it won’t be easy for you to find the ginseng fruit tree in Wuzhuang Daoist Temple. That thing isn’t a fruit tree that grows in an ordinary yard.”

“From what you’re saying, could it be that the ginseng fruit tree is grown in the sky?” Li Xuan thought nothing of it and teased.

“It’s naturally impossible for it to grow in the sky. It just grows underground,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.
