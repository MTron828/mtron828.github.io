Zhong Ziya’s body suddenly turned into white mist and escaped from Jiuyue’s hand.

Following that, the two of them entered their Terror forms. The average human couldn’t see their figures, so they didn’t know how the battle was proceeding.

However, from the short battle just now, Ya was clearly at a disadvantage. Jiuyue’s spatial powers left a deep impression in the minds of people.

Furthermore, the dimensional creature attached to Jiuyue had a powerful aura. It made people feel that Zhong Ziya wasn’t as powerful as before. It was like a child fighting an adult.

Zhou Wen had already walked out of the desert and arrived in a city that had been abandoned by humans. When he passed by the cube, he happened to see this scene and stopped to watch the battle.

Others couldn’t see the Terror-grade battle, but when Zhou Wen’s Wheel of Destiny moved, he immediately saw it clearly.

Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. Zhong Ziya’s situation wasn’t good.

As their power attributes weren’t completely the same, there was no way to directly compare the power between the two. However, from the levels, Jiuyue didn’t surpass the Terror grade. It was still at the Terror grade.

However, his usage of spatial powers and his understanding of them had reached a terrifying level. It was far from what the original Jiuyue could compare with. Zhong Ziya was far inferior.

Those fellows from the dimension are really shameless. They actually let a Calamity-grade creature control Jiuyue’s body and power. Although their power levels are the same, his usage and realm are on a much higher level. The Guardian that Zhong Ziya fused with clearly has some spatial powers. His opponent is also a spatial-type, but his opponent’s understanding is deeper than his. His opponent knows Zhong Ziya’s various abilities and knows how to deal with him, but Zhong Ziya knows very little about Jiuyue’s abilities. The difference in information will result in a huge disadvantage. Zhou Wen could tell how Zhong Ziya was in danger.

Furthermore, Zhong Ziya’s previous battles had exposed too many of his abilities, allowing his opponent to understand him better.

Zhong Ziya’s every move seemed to be within Jiuyue’s expectations. The battle was extremely difficult, and the injuries on his body increased.

If not for his various escape techniques and clone abilities, he would have been killed by Jiuyue long before now.

However, the escape technique had its limits. It was impossible for him to have an inexhaustible supply of clones. Zhou Wen could tell that Zhong Ziya’s situation was very bad.

Just as Zhong Ziya escaped, he suffered another heavy blow. The terrifying spatial power tore through his body.

Boom!

Zhong Ziya’s body slammed into the arena and was no longer in his Terror form. His white robe was already dyed red with blood. The wound on his chest almost extended across his entire chest.

He held the hilt of the sword with his blood-stained hand and supported his body. He could barely stand as his body swayed. His wounds were still bleeding. He looked like he was in a bad situation.

“This is unfair!” A young girl clenched her fists and shouted angrily.

There were many people who had the same thoughts as her, but there was nothing they could do. Even if they knew that it was unfair, they were powerless to change anything. There was no fairness in this world.

Jiuyue also dispelled his Terror form. He looked at Zhong Ziya, who was covered in blood, and said, “You were lucky not to die from this strike. You actually didn’t take the opportunity to quit. You really have a death wish.”

With that said, Jiuyue prepared to attack and kill Zhong Ziya.

“You’re at the Calamity grade?” Zhong Ziya asked as he held the hilt of his sword with both hands to support his body so that he wouldn’t collapse.

“At least you aren’t ignorant,” Jiuyue answered.

“The Calamity grade is indeed very strong,” Zhong Ziya continued.

“That’s an unimaginable level for you humans. It’s also a power that you can’t understand. In my eyes, you are no different from an ant. Therefore, don’t try to make an enemy of us. That will only bring about a calamity for you humans,” Jiuyue said matter-of-factly.

“What a pity.” Zhong Ziya suddenly sighed.

“What’s the pity?” Jiuyue asked with a frown.

“Unfortunately, you made a mistake,” Zhong Ziya said.

“Oh, what mistake?” Jiuyue looked at Zhong Ziya with interest. To him, Zhong Ziya was like a joke.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” Zhong Ziya said seriously.

“Why shouldn’t I be here?” Jiuyue continued asking.

“Killing you at this level is nothing. I want to kill you at the Calamity grade. Therefore, you shouldn’t have come here.” Zhong Ziya was still very serious, showing no intention of joking.

However, Jiuyue laughed as though he had heard an extremely funny joke. “Do you think that you have a chance of killing me just because we are both at the Terror grade? How ignorant are you to have such thoughts? Even if our powers are about the same, our levels and understandings are different. Our actual combat ability is worlds apart. I only need to move my fingers to kill you. It’s useless even if you want to self-destruct. You can’t injure me.”

Jiuyue’s words had a defeating effect, but no one could refute him. Ya was considered almost the best among humans, but in front of the dimensional creature that possessed Jiuyue, he was suppressed to the point of being unable to resist.

Everyone fell silent. They had nowhere to vent their anger.

Ya was the one being humiliated on stage, but Jiuyue’s words were also a form of contempt for the entire human race.

However, Zhong Ziya didn’t reveal any special emotions. He looked at Jiuyue and said, “That’s right. Your realm is very high, and your understanding of power and the laws is far above mine. Unfortunately, you don’t understand humans.”

“Why should I understand humans?” Jiuyue was no longer in the mood to continue talking to Zhong Ziya. He raised his hand and grabbed him. The space between the two vanished without a trace. Zhong Ziya appeared in front of him as though he had offered his neck into his hand. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Zhong Ziya, who had his neck clasped by Jiuyue, gradually had a burning look in his eyes. His eyes turned red as he continued, “If you understand humans, you should know that humans are a species that constantly make mistakes and learn. People like you who have a lifespan of ten thousand years and can even live forever wouldn’t understand how good humans are at learning given their lifespans only last decades.”

With that said, Zhong Ziya’s aura suddenly turned domineering. Terrifying Essence Energy erupted like a volcano, blasting away Jiuyue’s hand.

“Unlike you, I wasn’t born ten thousand years ago. Ten thousand years later, you stand before me like a giant.” Zhong Ziya’s aura became more and more terrifying. He had already entered his Terror form and vanished from everyone’s sight. However, his crazy voice still echoed.

“Everything that has been given to you over the past ten thousand years is just a moment of grandeur. The real you is just a fool who has lived a little longer.”
