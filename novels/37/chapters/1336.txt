Chapter 1337: Successfully Completed the Plan

Translator: CKtalon

“Starlady Polestar, is this how you treat your old friend and savior?” the antelope shouted as it ran.

From time to time, it would stomp at the dimensional creatures blocking the way, shattering the soldiers in Star Armor. It looked very impressive.

However, there were just too many soldiers in Forbidden City. The ones killed by the antelope were only a drop in the ocean. Soldiers wearing all kinds of Star Armor constantly surged over, and more and more of them appeared.

Those soldiers were quite strange. When there were only one or two soldiers, they looked quite ordinary and did not have much combat strength. However, as more soldiers gathered, each soldier’s combat strength became stronger and stronger, seemingly limitless.

“Why didn’t you just stay on Mount Laojun to await death? Why did you come here?” Starlady Polestar’s voice came from the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

“Pui, pui, pui. I’m still in my prime. It won’t be a problem for me to live for another thousand lifetimes. Even if you die a hundred times, I still won’t be dead,” said the antelope as it spat.

“Since you are speaking, it means that you have already lost your bet with him. What’s the use of living for so long? You might as well die. If I were you, I would just kill myself to avoid making a fool of myself,” said Starlady Polestar coldly.

Starlady Polestar seemed to hit the antelope’s sore spot. The antelope immediately flew into a rage out of humiliation. “That’s because I think there’s no point in winning. I deliberately let him win once. Otherwise, how could I lose? Besides, what has this got to do with you? Since when was it your turn to spout nonsense? You’d better mind your own business. Open your eyes wide and take a good look into the future to prevent yourself from being deceived again.”

“Say that again?” Starlady Polestar also seemed infuriated.

“I’m advising caution. Don’t be deceived by others again. Is that wrong? This is for your own good. I don’t want you to be deceived again. For the dignified Starlady Polestar to be abandoned by someone and to lead a depressing life worse than death, that’s just too sad. Even a bystander like me can’t stand watching…” Not only did the antelope repeat those words, it added more.

Boom! Boom!

Purple lightning descended from the sky and struck the antelope.

“Holy sh*t, Little Star, are you serious?” The antelope jumped and dodged the lightning strikes again and again in a sorry state. As it jumped, it shouted, “Little Star, no matter what, I’m your savior. Without me, you would still be buried and eating dirt. Now that you’ve grown capable, you actually dare to smite me with Firmament Lightning. Do you want me to spank your butt…”

Boom!

The lightning exploded like a bolt from the blue. Purple lightning descended from the sky as though a sea of lightning was pouring down—it would not stop until it diced the antelope into pieces.

“I came to visit you out of goodwill, but you’re actually so heartless. If I knew this would happen, I wouldn’t have gotten that punk to carry that bag of sh*t over…” The antelope kept spewing all sorts of vulgarities.

With a clang, the door of the Hall of Supreme Harmony was smashed open. A piece of charred wood tore out and stood erect on the roof like a lightning rod.

After the charred wood appeared, the entire sky above Forbidden City emitted purple light. Clouds gathered and the stars in the sky emitted a brilliance which overlapped and descended from the sky, illuminating the entire Forbidden City.

Now, it was no longer just lightning that descended, but the brilliance of thousands of stars. They were like countless crisscrossing beams of light that sliced at the antelope.

“Little Star, do you really want my life!?” The antelope cried out as it moved rapidly like a phantom. It used the buildings in Forbidden City to avoid the terrifying starlight assault.

The buildings that were originally protected by the dimensional zone’s nomological powers—thus making them virtually indestructible—were easily penetrated by the starlight. Soon, the starlight struck the antelope, causing it to scream.

Zhou Wen followed the agreement with the antelope and constantly changed his location and route. He traveled unobstructed amidst the starlight array and quickly sneaked to the Hall of Supreme Harmony’s vicinity.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t immediately take action. He hid nearby and waited for the opportunity the antelope mentioned.

Sweetie walked over with Zhou Wen. The starlight failed to injure her at all. It was as though the starlight—like Zhou Wen—failed to discover her.

There was another explosion in the sky. The stars shifted and the stars in the sky changed. One of the purple stars was like the core of the world. It was surrounded by the other stars and shone with strange starlight.

Upon seeing the purple star appear, looking identical to the antelope’s description, Zhou Wen no longer hesitated. He instant transmitted in front of the charred wood and hugged it.

Zhou Wen was very familiar with this log. Back then, he had carried it all the way to Forbidden City. However, although the current log’s size and appearance were the same as before, its texture was completely different.

It still looked charred, but it was as hard and smooth as jade. It was also abnormally cold.

Perhaps it was because all her attention was on the antelope, or because she was at a critical moment controlling the Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array, Starlady Polestar, who was inside the charred wood, failed to react in time and was hugged by Zhou Wen.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The six Calamity-grade bullets that surrounded Zhou Wen like a stellar ring slammed into the charred wood, producing six bullet holes.

“Ah!” Zhou Wen immediately heard a woman’s tragic cry from the charred wood. The Major Heavenly Cycle Stellar Array in the sky immediately collapsed.

“It’s done!” Zhou Wen was delighted when the six Calamity Bullets didn’t fly out again. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Get out of the way.” The antelope descended from the sky and kicked the charred wood, toppling it from the roof. Then, it opened its mouth and spat out a yellow paper talisman, sticking it on the charred wood.

Zhou Wen had already retreated to the side and sized up the charred wood that had been pasted with a yellow paper talisman by the antelope. He saw the charred wood constantly tremble violently as though it would shatter at any moment.

He couldn’t help but feel shocked. Starlady Polestar remained alive despite being hit by six sure-kill bullets. Her strength was unimaginably terrifying for her to still resist at this stage.

Now, Zhou Wen was very glad that he hadn’t come alone to settle the score with her. Otherwise, he might not have returned alive today.

The yellow paper talisman on the charred wood kept flickering with golden light as though it was suppressing Starlady Polestar.

However, seeing the charred wood shake so violently, Zhou Wen asked worriedly, “Is there a problem with your yellow paper talisman?”

“Don’t worry. I guarantee that nothing can go wrong with my stuff. She definitely won’t be able to rush out in at least 24 hours. Don’t write this yellow paper talisman off just because it doesn’t look remarkable. It has a great origin. As long as it’s pasted on, unless someone helps her tear it off, it’s impossible for anyone to rush out in a short period of time. Besides, she suffered six bullets from you. She must be seriously injured. Just follow me to pick up the treasures in peace,” the antelope said smugly.

These two guys are really big baddies! With me, Sweetie, around, how can I let you evil people have your way? I must make you pay for your evil deeds..?Sweetie came in front of the charred wood and reached out to tear off the yellow paper talisman.
