Chapter 1195: Another Companion Egg

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen was alarmed. This was the result of the Heaven-Opening Scripture’s protection. From the Essence Energy that was rapidly converted by the Heaven-Opening Scripture, he could tell how terrifying the black-glowing Deva’s Five Signs of Decay was.

If it were anyone else, not only would they not be able to hit the black-glowing Deva, but they would probably have their lives taken by the power of the Deva’s Five Signs of Decay.

None of his hits connected. Zhou Wen’s sword technique was already as fast as lightning, but he couldn’t touch even a strand of the black-glowing Deva’s hair.

How can I crack the black-glowing Deva’s Luck and Fortune skill? Zhou Wen knew that if he couldn’t crack it, it was useless no matter how fast his sword was.

The opposite of luck is misfortune or bad luck. Speaking of bad luck, Tai Sui should be the best choice. However, Tai Sui’s combat strength isn’t strong. It’s fine against microorganisms, but it probably won’t be of much use against a Deva. Furthermore, this is a Terror-grade Deva. A Mythical Tai Sui is probably useless... As Zhou Wen thought, he suddenly had an idea and took out the Bamboo Blade.

Bamboo Blade was one of the Four Gentlemen Blades. Legend had it that it was a blade with the curse of misfortune. It was unknown if it was of any use.

Now, Zhou Wen could only make a last-ditch effort. He didn’t have any other solutions. If it still didn’t work, he would have to get Banana Fairy to take action and see if an area-of-effect attack was effective against the black-glowing Deva.

However, after slashing a few times, he failed to injure the black-glowing Deva. Just as Zhou Wen was feeling disappointed, the Bamboo Blade tore through the black-glowing Deva’s sleeve.

Eh, looks like it’s still useful. Zhou Wen was overjoyed as he injected his Terror powers into the Bamboo Blade and slashed at the black-glowing Deva again and again.

Soon, Zhou Wen realized that the chances of the Bamboo Blade hitting the black-glowing Deva were very low. It took more than a hundred strikes to hit, and it was very difficult to strike a vital spot.

Even so, Zhou Wen was overjoyed. As long as he could touch the black-glowing Deva, there was a chance of killing him. It was better than nothing.

If a hundred slashes didn’t work, he would use a thousand slashes. If a thousand slashes didn’t work, he would use ten thousand slashes. There would come a time when he could successfully kill him.

Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal was already fast enough. Coupled with the Clown Mask’s teleportation ability, it was unbelievably fast. Blade beams flashed as though they were slashing at the black-glowing Deva from all directions. It was unknown how many strikes he had delivered.

The wounds on the black-glowing Deva gradually increased. Although they weren’t vital spots, they still affected him. In the end, the black-glowing Deva’s body was covered in blade wounds—suffering a death from abrasions.

A unique Terror-grade creature was killed by Zhou Wen just like that. All that was left was a pile of white bones. Its flesh had been sliced clean.

Zhou Wen didn’t wish to be so cruel, but he had no choice. He wouldn’t have been able to kill the black-glowing Deva if not for this strategy.

With a clang, a Companion Egg that emitted a black glow dropped out of black-glowing Deva’s body, delighting Zhou Wen.

A Terror-grade Companion Egg! Zhou Wen hurriedly picked up the Companion Egg. He never expected it to come so easily. Furthermore, the black-glowing Deva’s ability was very special. It would definitely be of great use in the future.

The Companion Egg’s black glow flowed as though it contained infinite mystery. Zhou Wen didn’t hesitate to hatch it.

As large amounts of Essence Energy surged in, the Companion Beast transformed into a black stream of light that entered Zhou Wen’s body.

Zhou Wen hurriedly took out his phone and looked at the information inside.

So the Greater Deva’s Five Signs of Decay is the power of the Terror transformation. It’s no wonder I didn’t see it on the Golden Deva or the Crimson Deva. However, this fellow is actually called Deva Asura. That’s Asura of the Deva race... Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be overjoyed when he saw his stats.

His companion form is a saber. If I use the saber transformed from Deva Asura to slay other Deva Asuras, what will happen with the augmentation of Luck and Fortune? Zhou Wen thought as he summoned Deva Asura in its saber form.

The Asura Saber was a long and narrow saber that was slightly curved. It was pitch-black, but it suffused a cold glow. It looked cold and mysterious, like the arc of the moon left behind during a lunar eclipse.

Zhou Wen held the saber and continued walking up the mountain. He couldn’t wait to see if it could restrain Deva Asuras.

Soon, Zhou Wen and company encountered another Deva. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a Deva Asura, but a Crimson Deva.

Zhou Wen slashed out with the Asura Saber, slaying the Crimson Deva under his blade. Zhou Wen didn’t use much strength and even deliberately held back. Yet, the Crimson Deva was still beheaded in one strike.

It’s indeed useful. Zhou Wen still wanted to know if it was effective against Deva Asuras. He continued walking up the mountain.

At first, he didn’t wish to encounter Devas, but now, he couldn’t wait to meet them. However, he only encountered some Crimson Devas and Golden Devas. He didn’t encounter Deva Asuras. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After slaying eleven Devas, quite a number of stat crystals dropped, but he didn’t obtain any Companion Eggs or see a Deva Asura. This left Zhou Wen somewhat disappointed.

As he walked forward, he suddenly saw a tree growing on the mountain wall in front of him.

Ever since Zhou Wen and company had entered the Deva Realm, they hadn’t seen any plants. There was sand and mountain rocks everywhere. But not a single blade of grass grew.

However, there was a crooked tree growing on the mountain wall in front of him. The crooked tree’s roots were embedded in the mountain wall, and the tree’s body was hanging outside.

Zhou Wen didn’t know what type of tree it was, but he could see that there were some red fruits on it. The fruits were about the size of a fist and looked a little like the fruits of a paper mulberry tree.

When the antelope saw the tree and fruits, its eyes immediately lit up. As for Chick, it was even more direct. It flapped its wings and flew towards the tree.

The antelope pressed Chick down from the sky with its hoof and wrote on the ground with its other hoof, “That tree is extraordinary. It has already entered the saint stage and can’t be easily desecrated.”

“That tree is what you are looking for?” Zhou Wen asked.

“The tree is useless. The fruit on the tree is what’s very useful. I never expected it to still be there, but it’s somewhat difficult to pluck them.” The antelope continued writing.

Zhou Wen looked at the fruit on the tree and frowned slightly. If even a Calamity-grade like the antelope said it was difficult, then it was truly difficult.

“What are those fruits? How can I pluck them?” Zhou Wen looked for a while and didn’t discover any danger, leaving him puzzled.

There were no Devas near the tree, nor were there any other dimensional creatures. If the fruits on the tree were so precious, why didn’t the numerous Devas not pluck the fruits? Why would they still be there?
