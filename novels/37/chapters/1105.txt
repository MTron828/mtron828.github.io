Chapter 1106: Di Tian

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen’s expression was solemn. He knew that the other party definitely wasn’t cannon fodder that had come to die for it to descend at this moment. There was a high chance that it was a Calamity-grade existence.

Furthermore, being able to preside over the cube battle meant that the other party’s status in the dimension wasn’t low.

Banana Fairy was the first to be summoned. His Companion Beast equipment had already been restored. Truth Listener’s earring constantly scanned the figure, but other than the powerful, terrifying aura, Truth Listener couldn’t hear anything.

Zhou Wen already had the intention to retreat. Above the Mythical stage, there was a huge gap between every grade. For example, power below the Terror grade couldn’t harm a Terror-grade creature.

Calamity-grade entities had their own uniqueness. Even a Terror-grade entity was as weak as a baby in front of a Calamity-grade entity, much less Zhou Wen who had just entered the Mythical stage.

If the dimensional creatures that descended really had the strength of the true Calamity grade, there was probably no chance of winning even if Demonic Neonate and Banana Fairy were summoned.

Zhou Wen planned on taking a look first. If he was certain that the other party was a true Calamity-grade, he would admit defeat and leave. Although Zhou Wen also wanted to take first place, his life was clearly more important.

When Di Tian walked out of the light beam, Zhou Wen was very certain that this was definitely a complete Calamity grade, not the kind of Terror-grade Calamity idiot that Ya had defeated.

Without any hesitation, Zhou Wen chose to forfeit and admit defeat without giving Di Tian a chance to attack.

Soon, Zhou Wen’s expression changed. He had clearly given up and admitted defeat, but he hadn’t been teleported out. He remained in the cube’s arena.

Zhou Wen constantly circulated the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder, but it was useless. The Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder couldn’t let him leave the arena.

“Do you want to forfeit and admit defeat? I’m afraid you no longer have a chance.” Di Tian walked out of the beam of light as his body completely condensed. However, even though he was standing there, one wouldn’t be able to see what he looked like with their eyes. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Despite clearly feeling that he had seen him, Zhou Wen couldn’t describe what he looked like. He only felt that the person was like an emperor or god that brought about supreme pressure. Everything in the world seemed tiny and weak in front of him.

Di Tian looked at Zhou Wen and continued, “You have the nomological power on you, so you can ignore the cube’s rules and prevent yourself from being kicked out. Since you want to stay so badly, I shall fulfill your wish and activate the cube’s deathmatch mode. Now, the cube has completely severed its connection with the outside world’s spacetime. It will only open again if one side dies. It’s useless even if you can break the rules because there’s no way out.”

“Who are you?” Zhou Wen knew that what Di Tian said was true. Otherwise, the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder wouldn’t be useless. His mind raced as he thought of all the possible ways of escape.

“Di Tian, Lord of the Celestial Gods,” Di Tian calmly replied.

The Celestial Gods of the Octokind? Zhou Wen was alarmed.

Zhou Wen didn’t know much about the dimension, nor did he know much about the Calamity-grade powerhouses in the dimension. It just so happened that he knew that the Lord of the Celestial Gods was a Calamity-grade powerhouse.

Due to Wang Mingyuan, Zhou Wen had learned some information regarding the Octokind. The Octokind were eight different dimensional races.

Wang Mingyuan defeated the Dragon Gods’ king and became the new Dragon King. According to Ice Maiden, six of the eight monarchs of the Octokind were at the Terror grade, while only two were at the Calamity grade. Di Tian was one of them and also the leader of the Octokind.

Wang Mingyuan had snatched the Dragon King’s position, but he hadn’t touched Di Tian. From this, one could tell how terrifying Di Tian was.

Now that Di Tian had personally descended to kill him and his retreat path had been severed, Zhou Wen immediately felt that things were going south.

Upon hearing Zhou Wen and Di Tian’s conversation, the Federation was in an uproar.

Di Tian clearly wanted Human’s life, and not solely to kick him out.

“Do you want to leave behind your name before you die? To be killed by me is also a form of honor for you,” Di Tian said casually as though Zhou Wen’s life was already in his hands.

Zhou Wen had secretly drawn the Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping Art, hoping to use interstellar teleportation to see if he could teleport away.

However, he was very disappointed. All the stars in the Pocket Universe were dim. Clearly, he couldn’t teleport out from here.

Since I can’t leave, I can only give it my all. Zhou Wen gripped the white wooden club in his hand tightly. Under Zhou Wen’s orders, Banana Fairy used her Three Realms’ Best Wind.

A terrifying storm instantly enveloped the entire arena, sweeping towards Di Tian.

At the same time that the Three Realms’ Best Wind stirred, Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and entered the Invisibility state. He used the Godfiend Era Energy Art he had just drawn to teleport behind Di Tian and unleashed Immortal Slaying while invisible.

As for Demonic Neonate, she was secretly hiding in Zhou Wen’s arms, waiting for an opportunity to take action.

Di Tian floated in the air as he faced Banana Fairy’s Three Realms’ Best Wind. All he did was wave his sleeve. It was as though there was a world inside his sleeve. When the terrifying Three Realms’ Best Wind rushed into his sleeve, it was like a rock sinking into the ocean. It only made his sleeve flutter a few times as though it was being caressed by a breeze.

The invisible Zhou Wen was about to hit Di Tian with Immortal Slaying, but without even turning his head, Di Tian casually grabbed the white wooden club and threw Zhou Wen in front of him.

Boom!

Zhou Wen’s body slammed into the arena as blood spewed out of his mouth. He couldn’t hold the white wooden club in his hand as it tumbled out.

Di Tian didn’t do a follow-up attack. Instead, he held the white wooden club and sized it up. Then, he muttered to himself, “It’s indeed the Mourning Stick. Unfortunately, it’s not complete. It’s just an incomplete item.”

Banana Fairy was worried about Zhou Wen, so she flew over and stood in front of him. The banana leaf transformed into a fan that fanned at Di Tian.

Di Tian waved his sleeve again, but this time, not only did he suck in Banana Fairy’s wind, but the sleeve also became extremely huge as though it covered the void. There was a huge suction force inside that pulled Banana Fairy’s body, causing her to involuntarily fly towards the sleeve.

Banana Fairy tried her best to use her wind-elemental powers to escape the suction of the sleeve, but she was still pulled into it.

Zhou Wen endured the pain and summoned Truth Listener.

Even Demonic Neonate didn’t move, so ordinary Mythical Companion Beasts were even more useless. In front of a Calamity-grade existence, an existence like Banana Fairy didn’t have much room to resist. Now, the only power Zhou Wen could think of was Truth Listener.

The moment Truth Listener was summoned, it charged at Di Tian. While in midair, the earrings on its six ears shattered one after another as its body constantly changed.

Zhou Wen had only released a maximum of three earrings in the past. He didn’t dare try any further as he didn’t know what would happen if Truth Listener’s six earrings were all released.

However, now that it was a life-and-death situation, he couldn’t care less.
