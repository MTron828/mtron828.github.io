Chapter 1807 Who Should I Believe?

“So what if I’m Earth’s Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen already had an idea as he asked the woman.

“So what? Since you’re here, it means that I can leave,” The Thearch said.

“I don’t remember having promised to save you.” Zhou Wen frowned.

The Thearch revealed a teasing smile. “I don’t remember saying that I need you to save me.”

“You don’t need me to save you?” Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised.

“When I was invincible, you weren’t even an egg. If I can’t even save myself, what’s the point of having you?” The Thearch said indifferently.

“In that case, why are you still here?” Zhou Wen curled his lips and teased.

“Of course it’s because I’m waiting for you. I made an agreement with her. Only when I hand the item to you can I leave,” The Thearch said.

“Her? Nüwa?” Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. The Thearch had just said that Nüwa was actually Earth itself and not an ordinary individual lifeform. How was she going to make an agreement with Earth?

If the person who made the agreement with The Thearch wasn’t Nüwa, there was only one possibility. The person who made the agreement with The Thearch was the woman who had arrived on Earth on a ship and dug out Prisoner.

But who was that woman? Who was The Thearch?

According to Zhou Wen’s guess, one of the women between that woman and The Thearch was definitely an Immortal, the Immortal Empress who had once reigned supreme in the dimension.

According to the various signs, the possibility of The Thearch being that Immortal was higher.

If The Thearch was the Immortal Empress, then where did the woman who drove the ship come from? Why did she dig out the Earth Companion Beast? Why did she nurture a new Earth Companion Beast? Why did she leave something for the new Earth Companion Beast and let The Thearch guard it?

All sorts of questions prevented him from coming up with the real answer. The only one who could answer his questions was The Thearch.

“I don’t know.” To his surprise, The Thearch’s words made all of Zhou Wen’s expectations vanish.

“How can you not know who she is?” Zhou Wen didn’t give up.

“I claim to be invincible in the world. Before the dimensional restrictions were broken, I broke through the dimensional barrier and descended into the universe you are in. I originally thought that no one in the world could match me.” The Thearch sighed and said, “But when I descended to Earth and wanted to resolve everything, she appeared. She tore through the air with a huge ship and stood in my way. It’s impossible for me not to know of such an existence if it really exists in the world, but I’ve never heard of such a person.”

“You mean that she doesn’t belong to our world or your dimension?” Zhou Wen was even more alarmed.

“Perhaps.” The Thearch continued, “I fought her, but I lost. That was the first defeat I suffered since I was born.”

That’s a little exaggerated. Are you claiming that you were born invincible? Zhou Wen cursed inwardly, but he didn’t say it out loud.

.

The Thearch read Zhou Wen’s mind at a glance and said indifferently, “I was born an Apocalypse.”

Zhou Wen was immediately rendered speechless. What a simple and arrogant answer. To be born at the Apocalypse grade, it wasn’t easy for her to lose.

“And then?” Zhou Wen hurriedly changed the topic. Such a topic made him feel a little sad.

He had worked hard on his cultivation to this very day, but he was still a mere Calamityinferior to a baby.

The Thearch was very happy at striking a blow on Zhou Wen. She said with a smile, “You don’t have to belittle yourself. If Zhou Lingfeng hadn’t taken you away, there’s a high chance that you would have been considered an Apocalypse when you were born.”

“How did Zhou Lingfeng take the baby away?” Zhou Wen couldn’t figure this out. Ignoring the fact that the woman was so terrifying, even The Thearch, who was guarding this place, wouldn’t have permitted Zhou Lingfeng to take the baby away.

“I don’t know. I originally thought that no one could take you away, but Zhou Lingfeng managed to do so.” The Thearch smiled and said, “If you want to know the answer, I’m afraid you can only commit suicide and go to another world to ask her for the answer.”

“That woman is dead?” Zhou Wen was alarmed.

“Of course, she defeated me, but she left her life behind,” The Thearch said indifferently. “In fact, I suspect that she was injured before our battle. She died not long after the battle. In order to abide by my agreement with her, I stayed here until I handed the item to you.”

“What is it?” Zhou Wen finally couldn’t help but ask.

The Thearch didn’t answer this time. She only stood up and produced cracking sounds. The chains that bound her snapped one by one. In the blink of an eye, she regained her freedom.

Zhou Wen had previously suspected that The Thearch was lying to him. From the looks of it, The Thearch didn’t need his help to escape.

“I’ve long told you that what I need is you. You were only blinded by your own insecurities and cowardliness.” As The Thearch spoke, she took two steps forward and pointed at the spot she was sitting on. “This is the thing she wanted me to give

you.”

Only then did Zhou Wen realize that the spot where The Thearch had been sitting was a jade-like box. On the front of the box was an ancient lock.

“What’s inside?” Zhou Wen asked.

“I don’t know. I promised her that you’ll be the only one to take it out.” The Thearch glanced at Zhou Wen and said, “Didn’t you already obtain the key? Why don’t you open it

yourself?”

“You can’t open it.” Just as Zhou Wen was wondering if he should open the box, he suddenly heard a familiar voice behind him.

He turned his head and saw Jing Daoxian staggering over from the tunnel. He didn’t look good. His body was covered in blood and his white hair was disheveled, but his eyes were abnormally firm as though they were glowing

“You’re actually not dead?” The Thearch seemed a little surprised when she saw Jing Daoxian, but that was all.

“Even Hades can forget about accepting an old man like me. I can’t die even if I wanted to.” Jing Daoxian walked over step by step. Essence Energy fluctuations couldn’t be sensed from his body at all, but there seemed to be an invisible aura spreading out like a mountain.

“Kid, don’t listen to her nonsense. If you open that box, she will truly be set free. When that happens, no one will be able to hold her back,” Jing Daoxian said to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen looked at The Thearch before looking at Jing Daoxian. For a moment, he didn’t know who to believe. In fact, Zhou Wen felt that neither of them was trustworthy. If he had to choose, he would rather believe The Thearch.
