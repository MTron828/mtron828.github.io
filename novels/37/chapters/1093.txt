Chapter 1094: True Body Descends

Translator: CKtalon

The people who had been clamoring for Human to attack quickly fell silent. They watched the battle in a daze as their expressions gradually changed.

With the help of the two Mythical Companion Beasts—the dragon and war hammer—and the strength of a Guardian, everyone originally believed that this would be a battle without any suspense.

And indeed, there was no suspense. However, it was different from what they had imagined. The one being suppressed and ravaged was Flaming Battle God.

Looking at the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General that was charging across the arena like a demonic god, a question mark surfaced in many people’s minds.

“What Companion Beast is this? It’s freaking ferocious!”

“Why haven’t I heard of such a ferocious Companion Beast before?”

“He vomited blood again. Flaming Battle God’s armor is about to crack. Furthermore, he was beaten to such a state despite having the help of two Mythical Companion Beasts. This Companion Beast is really powerful.”

“This isn’t right. Isn’t it said that Guardians will definitely defeat Companion Beasts? Why is he being thrashed?”

“Flaming Battle God likely hasn’t unleashed his other ultimate moves, right?”

“What ultimate move? The Golden Flaming Chariot was his ultimate move.”

The spear in the Tiger Soul General’s hand danced wildly as it smashed into Flaming Battle God’s chest, shattering his breastplate. He was sent flying like a sandbag. With the shattered armor pieces, Flaming Battle God tumbled a great distance in the arena before stopping.

The Tiger Soul General didn’t stop. Demonic flames spewed out from its body as it arrived in front of Flaming Battle God like a demon.

There was no chance of Flaming Battle God winning the battle against the Tiger Soul General. The Tiger Soul General had absorbed too many flames early in the battle. Furthermore, the more he fought, the stronger he became. It would be too easy to defeat Flaming Battle God now.

The Flaming Battle God saw that the situation was going south and wanted to admit defeat to leave the arena.

Unfortunately, he was still a step too late. Zhou Wen had arrived not far behind him at some point in time. He held something that looked like a grenade in his hand and threw it at Flaming Battle God before quickly retreating.

Boom! Boom!

The energy produced by the explosion of the Ancient Splitting Tadpole’s grenade shattered the already cracked and shattered Flaming Battle God armor into pieces. Furthermore, the explosions were continuous.

After the large Ancient Splitting Tadpole exploded, it split into smaller grenades that continued exploding. The continuous explosions almost instantly blasted the Flaming Battle God to pieces. He was deader than dead.

“He died just like that?” Some people couldn’t believe that a Guardian had been blasted to death.

“So Guardians aren’t as strong as I imagined. With powerful Companion Beasts, we can still kill them.”

“That requires a Companion Beast to be strong enough. That person’s Companion Beast is extremely strong.”

“The grenade Companion Beast that killed the Flaming Battle God looks like the Ancient Splitting Tadpole from the previous Companion Beast showcase.”

“Now that you mention it, it does seem like it!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Could this person be the owner of those Companion Beasts?”

“Holy sh*t, that’s really possible!”

Soon, this news spread. All the major media outlets began reporting it. After all, people had a deep impression of the previous Companion Beast showcase.

However, this battle didn’t stop the other Guardians from issuing challenges. Although there were fewer Guardians who issued a challenge, there were still quite a number of them. Many of them were at the Mythical stage.

From their point of view, although Zhou Wen’s Companion Beast was powerful, it wouldn’t be impossible to take it down.

Zhou Wen had Mythical Companion Beasts, but so did they. As long as they used them well, it wouldn’t be difficult to defeat the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General.

Furthermore, many people could tell the problem with the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General. They knew that the Fiend-Armored Tiger Soul General could absorb fire-elemental powers and was extremely effective against Flaming Battle God. This was why Flaming Battle God had suffered such a tragic defeat.

Zhou Wen glanced at the challenge list and realized that Darkness Emissary who had been frightened away by Grim Demon was among the list. He was also the Guardian Zhou Ming had contracted.

This fellow actually dares to challenge me? Is he crazy? Zhou Wen knew Zhou Ming quite well.

He didn’t deliberately find out more about Zhou Ming. However, with Grim Demon’s name shaking the world, many media outlets had reported about Zhou Ming.

Grim Demon loved reading those reports and had deliberately read them out loud for them to hear. This was why Zhou Wen knew a little.

Zhou Wen felt that there was only one possibility for such a selfish and cowardly fellow to take the risk to challenge him. Something had given him the courage.

What could it be? Could it be that a dimensional Terror creature will descend on him like Jiuyue? Zhou Wen felt that it was impossible.

No matter how spineless a Calamity-grade dimensional creature was, it wouldn’t choose the body of such a low-level human for its descent, right? Even if it wanted to choose, it would choose someone like Cave Era or Jiuyue.

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and chose Darkness Emissary as his next opponent.

Soon, Zhou Ming, who was wearing the Darkness Emissary armor, appeared in the arena. The moment he appeared, he began condensing the Door of Darkness.

Unexpectedly, Zhou Ming condensed the Door of Darkness very quickly.

Zhou Wen immediately saw the problem. Zhou Ming held a black crystal in his hand. Most of the power that condensed the Door of Darkness came from the black crystal.

Zhou Wen wasn’t a madman like Ya, nor was he interested in knowing what the black crystal was or how the Door of Darkness was different from before.

Therefore, he immediately drew his Night Immaculate Sword. The sword that resembled smoke tore through the air and stabbed at Zhou Ming. He wanted to kill him along with Darkness Emissary before Zhou Ming could condense the Door of Darkness.

Although Night Immaculate wasn’t absolutely invincible, Zhou Ming was currently condensing the Door of Darkness. He couldn’t move at all. Once he moved, the channeling of the Door of Darkness would be interrupted. All his previous efforts would be in vain.

Zhou Ming watched as Night Immaculate flew over like a rainbow. He had no intention of dodging. The moment Night Immaculate stabbed into the Darkness Emissary armor, a golden light bloomed from his chest.

It was a golden rune that transformed into a golden barrier that protected Zhou Ming.

The Night Immaculate Sword crisscrossed and struck the golden barrier again and again, but it failed to slice through it.

Zhou Wen looked at the golden barrier and felt the power on it. No matter how stupid he was, he understood that be it the golden runes or the black crystal, it was definitely the work of the dimension.

Those with keen eyes could guess what had happened. They were very worried for Human, afraid that Ya’s encounter would repeat itself.

Zhou Wen stared at the Door of Darkness. He knew that dimension’s techniques weren’t that simple. The truly terrifying thing would definitely be inside the Door of Darkness.

Could it be that a dimensional creature wants to use the Door of Darkness to descend personally? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

The Door of Darkness condensed at an extremely fast speed. It took only a moment for it to take shape. With a boom, the Door of Darkness opened. A roar that sounded like it came from the depths of an abyss came from deep within the Door of Darkness.

Is a dimensional creature descending personally? Zhou Wen stared intently at the Door of Darkness.
