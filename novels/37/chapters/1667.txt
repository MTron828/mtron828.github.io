Chapter 1668 Not Enough to Eat

“Lord Sword Sage… Master…”

The group of Elders, Honn Shinsakura, Shiraishi Satomi, and company stood up and bowed. Although Sei Gasakai had already handed over the position of Palace Master of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace to Honn Shinsakura, just the words ‘Sei Gasakai’ alone held extremely high prestige in the Niten Flying Immortal Palace and even the entire sea.

“Lord Sword Sage… You have to interfere in this matter… We can’t watch Palace Lord take the Niten Flying Immortal Palace down a path of no return because of his selfishness…” The Elders hurriedly explained to Sei Gasakai, who had just returned, Honn Shinsakura’s determination to take the Niten Flying Immortal Palace to Guide Ancient City.

Sei Gasakai waved his hand and stopped the Elders from continuing. Then, he said, “Sakura is the Palace Lord of the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. He has the right to make any decision.”

“But…” The Elders were anxious. They wanted to argue, but they were stopped by Sei Gasakai.

Sei Gasakai looked at the Elders and said indifferently, “Furthermore, I also think that Sakura’s decision is very correct. It’s far more correct to join Guide Ancient City than the six families.”

The Elders didn’t expect Sei Gasakai to say that. They were stunned and lost for words.

Sei Gasakai continued, “Just as Sakura said, when we traveled in Luoyang, I was filled with ambition. I thought that my Sword Dao was enough to challenge Sunset College’s Leng Zongzheng, but not long after I arrived in Luoyang, I met Zhou Wen. Back then, Zhou Wen was only fifteen or sixteen years old, but I lost to him. The reason the Sword Dao I created is called the Niten Flying Immortal-ryū is due to the insights I gained from Zhou Wen’s Transcendent Flying Immortal. It can be said that Zhou Wen is my master.”

If these Elders had doubted Honn Shinsakura’s words, they no longer had any doubts after hearing it from Sei Gasakai’s mouth. All of them were at a loss for words.

“Zhou Wen’s talent is unparalleled despite being a pure human. He’s definitely not someone who relies on external forces to raise his strength in a short period of time. He will definitely shock the world one day. Furthermore, there are many people who have pledged allegiance to the six families. If we go now, we will only be one of them. Guide Ancient City is at a time when people are needed. It’s a good opportunity to go now. Everything that Sakura has in mind is what our Niten Flying Immortal Palace has in mind too. There is no selfishness in this. Don’t be suspicious.” Sei Gasakai swept his gaze across the faces of the Elders. They couldn’t help but lower their heads.

“We shall abide by the Palace Lord’s orders.” The Elders turned around and bowed at Honn Shinsakura.

Honn Shinsakura’s expression remained unchanged without any ripples in his eyes. He didn’t take the matter to heart. His gaze was distant, as though his focus was no longer in front of him.

Zhou Wen, I’m coming. My sword will surprise you. Don’t disappoint me!

“Ah-choo!”

Zhou Wen, who was gaming on his phone, sneezed. After rubbing his nose, he continued focusing on the game.

In the game, the blood-colored avatar’s entire body was enveloped by the Chaos Egg that resembled crystal or jade. As for the golden light that shot out from the three-faced Buddha’s eyes in the temple hall, it enveloped the Chaos Egg. The golden light seeped into the Chaos Egg and dyed it golden.

The Chaos Egg had already reached the peak of the Hell level and was about to break through to the Heaven level.

A Human Realm Chaos Egg could convert the enemy’s strength into Essence Energy Crystals when suffering a beating. Furthermore, Essence Energy Crystals could be stacked to a maximum of 10,000 Essence Crystals.

The Chaos Egg’s stacking ability increased significantly at the Hell level. The highest he could stack reached a hundred million.

With the Chaos Egg’s ability to accommodate Essence Energy, it could only last for about ten seconds under the three-faced Buddha’s golden light. Furthermore, no matter how the Chaos Egg was destroyed, it couldn’t grow like before.

Zhou Wen clearly felt that the Chaos Egg was just short of breaking through to the Heaven level, but for some reason, it was always lacking something. It was ultimately difficult for it to truly enter the Heaven level.

What’s missing? Seeing the game screen go black again with nothing for him and the Chaos Egg to speak for, he couldn’t help but frown in thought.

Zhou Wen already knew very well that it was impossible for him to help the Chaos Egg advance to the Heaven level with just mechanical suicidal cultivation. He had to figure out the key to advancing.

“I’m hungry.”

As Zhou Wen was pondering over it, Demonic Neonate walked to Zhou Wen’s side with the Demonic Sword in her arms. She looked up into Zhou Wen’s eyes and spoke with a serious expression.

“Hungry?” Zhou Wen was first taken aback before he sized up Demonic Neonate in surprise.

Many Companion Beasts became hungry. If they were starved for too long, they might even dissipate. The most typical representative was Tyrant Behemoth. If there was no food for a long period of time, Tyrant Behemoth might starve to death.

It was only because Zhou Wen had the resources from the in-game dungeons and an Essence Energy Art like the Chaos Egg that he could raise so many high-level Companion Beasts.

If it were an ordinary person, most of them would starve to death even if they were given a pile of divine pets.

However, Demonic Neonate was different. She was very picky. There was little food that she fancied. Even high-level Essence Crystals were beneath her. Even a Calamity-grade Companion Egg was nothing to her.

It could be said that Demonic Neonate was the one who ate the least among Zhou Wen’s top Companion Beasts. Every time she ate, she would eat something strange. She usually didn’t eat, nor had he heard her mention her hunger.

Now, Demonic Neonate had taken the initiative to say that she was hungry. This gave Zhou Wen a fright because he didn’t know if he had anything she wanted to eat.

After carefully sizing her up, Demonic Neonate still looked the same. She was like an adorable and cold magical sword girl. She wasn’t much different from usual, but Zhou Wen carefully observed her for a while and realized that there was indeed something different about her.

Demonic Neonate’s irises usually looked black, but in fact, they weren’t black. They were an extremely deep purple color, so deep that one would mistake them for black.

However, Demonic Neonate’s irises had lightened in color, turning into a grayish-purple color. The grayish-purple color gave off a degenerate and lonely feeling, as though one would be sucked in if one looked at it for too long.

“Neonate, what do you want to eat?” Zhou Wen took out his high-level Companion Eggs, Essence Energy Crystals, and some essences he had gathered and placed them on the bed for Demonic Neonate to choose.

Demonic Neonate’s gaze swept across the items, but she only shook her head slightly. Zhou Wen took out many more items, but they were also rejected by Demonic Neonate.

Could it be that I can only use Neonate’s reserves? Zhou Wen rummaged through his belongings and didn’t find anything that Demonic Neonate wanted to eat. He couldn’t help but think of Grim Demon.

When Demonic Neonate saw Zhou Wen’s eyes fixated on her Demonic Sword, she immediately understood what he was thinking. She shook her head and said, “Not enough.”

Fortunately, unless the Demonic Sword was unsheathed, Grim Demon couldn’t sense the situation outside. Otherwise, he would probably fight Zhou Wen to the death.
