Chapter 1183: Thousand Year Dream

What punishment is Dream Punishment? Zhou Wen frowned slightly. Apart from the white-haired granny, the stone table, and the stone bench, he didn’t see anything else in the room.

There didn’t seem to be any danger, but Zhou Wen felt that something was amiss. He held back Li Xuan, who was about to enter the torture chamber.

“What?” Li Xuan’s voice was somewhat hoarse.

Zhou Wen could sense his body trembling slightly. It was an uncontrollable spasm, not because of the damage to his body, but because of the psychological pressure.

Although Zhou Wen hadn’t attempted all the punishments in the past, from his attempts, he knew that the mental pressure and damage were immense. Even Zhou Wen suffered immense pressure despite his tenacity—and that was when he hadn’t attempted all the punishments.

However, even if the pressure was greater, Zhou Wen was likely able to withstand it. However, his recovery ability wasn’t as strong as Li Xuan’s. It was impossible for him to withstand all the punishments in such a short period of time.

“This torture chamber is the last torture chamber. I don’t think it’s that simple. It might be very dangerous,” Zhou Wen said.

“We’ll know if it’s dangerous after I enter. Anyway, we have to clear this round. There’s no need to think too much,” Li Xuan said as he walked into the Dream Punishment Chamber.

Zhou Wen knew that Li Xuan was just saying that to make things appear fine, but he felt uneasy when he looked at the white-haired granny.

There were a total of 239 torture chambers on the long street. The other 238 torture chambers were filled with ordinary punishment ghosts. Only this room had a white-haired old lady. From this, one could tell that this torture chamber was definitely not simple.

However, just as Li Xuan had said, even if he knew that there were risks, he had to clear it.

After Li Xuan walked into the torture chamber, he wasn’t directly placed on torture equipment like before. He could still move freely as though he was outside.

“What punishment is this? Do you want me to sleep here and have a dream?” Li Xuan said to the white-haired granny.

Zhou Wen and An Sheng suddenly realized that something was amiss. This was because only they could see the torture ghosts from before. Others couldn’t see them, but now, Li Xuan could see the white-haired granny.

“Can you see the white-haired granny inside?” An Sheng immediately asked Lu Bushun and company.

“I can see her. Your question is weird. Are we not supposed to see her?” Lu Bushun asked An Sheng in puzzlement as the others looked at him.

Zhou Wen and An Sheng exchanged looks. They knew that there was indeed a huge problem with this torture chamber.

An Tianzuo also looked at An Sheng, wanting to know what he meant. Just as An Sheng was about to say something, the white-haired old lady inside suddenly moved. Everyone’s eyes were immediately attracted to her, so An Sheng didn’t say a word.

The white-haired granny took out a tea bowl and a teapot from somewhere. She placed the tea bowl on the stone table in front of her and slowly poured water to fill it.

The tea in the bowl was a jade-green color, as though it had been soaked in bamboo leaves. However, there wasn’t a single tea leaf inside, much less a bamboo leaf.

“One dream in a thousand years; one dream for a thousand years. Drink this bowl of Thousand Year Dream. If you can walk out of it alive, you will be able to see the real Netherworld,” the white-haired old lady said in a strange tone that made one feel uncomfortable.

“You mean that I’ll sleep for a thousand years after drinking this bowl of tea?” Li Xuan asked.

“It won’t take that long since you don’t have that long of a lifespan. Even if you do, you would starve to death before being able to sleep for a thousand years,” the white-haired old granny said with a smile.

“My body is fine. I don’t need to sleep that much. Can I wake up early?” Li Xuan asked again.

“No. Even if a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal descends to the mortal world and drinks this bowl of Thousand Year Dream, he will definitely sleep for a thousand years. Not one second more, not one second less,” the white-haired granny said.

“There’s no solution?” Li Xuan frowned.

“There’s one.” The white-haired granny’s answer surprised everyone.

“What?” Li Xuan asked.

“One dream for a thousand years; one dream in a thousand years.” The white-haired granny repeated what she had said with a smile.

“Li Xuan, come back.” Zhou Wen’s expression changed as he called Li Xuan out. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

An Tianzuo and An Sheng’s expressions changed. Clearly, they understood what the white-haired granny meant.

One dream for a thousand years meant that this single dream would last for a thousand years. When the white-haired granny said that there was a solution, it was implying the first half of the sentence.

Since he could have one dream in a thousand years, he could also spend a thousand years in a dream but only spend a day or less in reality.

From the sound of it, having one dream in a thousand years was much easier than having a dream last a thousand years. After all, it was only a thousand years in a dream. In reality, he wouldn’t starve to death or be injured. It didn’t seem dangerous.

However, that wasn’t the case. To spend a thousand years in a dream, ignoring what kind of dream it was, just a thousand years was enough to make one’s will collapse.

Zhou Wen had been trapped on Fangzhang Mountain for only a hundred years. He had relied on his powerful willpower and focus on cultivation to last for a hundred years.

However, that didn’t mean that Zhou Wen was having a good time. If it hadn’t been for his extreme focus, he would have gone crazy from being imprisoned for a century.

Li Xuan clearly understood what the white-haired granny meant and asked, “One dream in a thousand years... How long is this dream?”

“Take the 238 prior punishments as one cycle, and one cycle lasts a day. If you want it long and have a long dream, it can be long. If you want it short, it can also be short. It all depends on your will,” said the white-haired granny.

“Li Xuan, come back. There’s no need to continue. Sis Lan and company definitely wouldn’t have been able to clear this round. It’s impossible for them to have entered the true Netherworld,” Zhou Wen’s expression changed as he said to the white-haired granny.

The white-haired granny had already made it very clear that suffering all the prior punishments in the dream was only considered a day. Then, how many times would he have to suffer in a dream that lasted a thousand years? Zhou Wen was momentarily unable to do the math, nor did he wish to.

No matter how resilient Li Xuan was, he had to suffer all the punishments once a day for a thousand years. To experience a thousand years like that would give a normal person a mental breakdown.

“Let’s end it here,” An Tianzuo said.

Although there were various signs that Sis Lan and company had indeed entered Netherworld City, they hadn’t seen them in Netherworld City. It was highly likely that they had entered the real Netherworld. He wanted to enter no matter what.

However, such punishments weren’t something humans could withstand. An Tianzuo wasn’t willing to see Li Xuan die for nothing.

However, Li Xuan had no intention of leaving the torture chamber. He looked back at Zhou Wen and said, “Since Sis Lan and company have entered Netherworld City, there’s no other possibility. They must have entered the real Netherworld. Since we’re here, we have to go in and take a look regardless.”
