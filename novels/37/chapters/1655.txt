Chapter 1656 Paying Respects to the Heavens and Earth

The sudden appearance of the Heavenly Happiness Token made Zhou Wen immediately realize something

When Emperor of Shang gave him the Heavenly Happiness Token, he didn’t say anything. He even gave it very casually as though it was nothing important. However, ever since Zhou Wen obtained the Heavenly Happiness Token, what happened around it made him vaguely understand that it was definitely important.

Just the characteristic of allowing a Calamity creature to stay on Earth was extremely terrifying.

On Earth, other than humans, all creatures would be forced to leave Earth for the universe once they advanced to the Calamity grade. If they stayed, they would definitely be suppressed by the rules or they would seal themselves. Only by weakening their strength to below the Calamity grade could they stay on Earth.

The most direct example was the antelope. A strong fellow like the antelope was definitely at the Calamity grade, and it wasn’t an ordinary Calamity-grade. Its usual cultivation was always in a sealed state. Even if it was heavily injured, it didn’t dare release its strength.

With the standards of humans now, if Calamity creatures could stay on Earth, how was it possible for humanity to survive? Earth would have long been ruled by the dimensional creatures.

Now, the Heavenly Happiness Token was dazzling. Streams of light circulated in euphoria. It was like a red lantern hanging above Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi.

Boo… Boo… Boo…

The bee continued using all its strength as it kept blowing the suona. As the suona music sounded, the light on the Heavenly Happiness Token intensified. Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi couldn’t help but turn towards the Heavenly Happiness Token.

“Xiao, why do I find this scene a little familiar!” Jiuyang, who was standing by the side, frowned as he looked at the scene in front of him.

Xiao said with a strange expression, “If I’m not wrong, what they are doing now seems to be a tradition of ancient times.”

Jiuyang’s eyes lit up when he heard Xiao. “That’s right. That’s right. It’s a kind of tradition… What’s the name of that tradition again…”

As many traditional customs had already vanished in the Federation, much less Jiuyang, who was born in the Holy Land. He only occasionally read some historical information, so he didn’t have a deep impression of it. He couldn’t recall it immediately.

“Paying respects to the heavens and earth,” Xiao said.

“That’s right. It’s a ceremony to pay respects to the heavens and earth done during weddings in the East District’s ancient times. There’s no mistake about it. I chanced upon it when reading. The music that used to be played seems very similar to the music played by the bee… How should I put it… It’s festive…” Jiuyang’s expression turned odd. “But this is too strange. A Companion Beast born on a distant planet actually knows the tradition that few humans know of. It even wants to force Zhou Wen to pay respects to the heavens and earth with a dimensional creature. This is too bizarre. What does it want? Is this really about paying respects to the heavens and earth?”

“I don’t think… it’s wrong…” Xiao looked at Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi in thought.

“If I remember correctly, there are a total of three steps. First, paying respect to the heavens and the earth, then paying respect to the ancestors. Finally, both husband and wife will pay respect to each other. After that, they will be sent into the bridal chamber for consummation to be truly considered husband and wife and…” As Jiuyang spoke, he heard the bee’s suona turn loud and profound. The entire suona was raised by it as it blew into the void with all its strength as though it was paying respects to something.

With the suona sounding, Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi couldn’t help but kneel towards the Heavenly Happiness Token and slowly kowtow.

Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi had naturally heard Xiao and Jiuyang’s conversation. Zhou Wen didn’t find it strange at all. The Heavenly Happiness Token was something that dealt with marriage. For it to appear, Zhou Wen refused to believe that it had nothing to do with marriage.

Zhou Wen didn’t have any feelings for paying respect to the heavens and earth. Even if he really did so with Tsukuyomi, the Heavenly Happiness Token-invoked nuptial didn’t mean anything Ignoring the fact that both of them were forced, even if they weren’t, it wasn’t difficult for modern people to get a divorce.

What Zhou Wen was worried about was why the bee was doing this. What benefits would his marriage with Tsukuyomi bring to the bee?

Wait, could it be… Zhou Wen thought of a possibility and felt his scalp tingle.

The Heavenly Happiness Token’s ability was very likely not just carrying out a rite. Otherwise, it would be useless for such a divine artifact to be created just for a nuptial.

If the Heavenly Happiness Token had a more specific use, it was very likely that this effect would allow Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi to enter the bridal chamber. It was even possible that they could directly conceive.

Recalling the guess that the bee wanted to parasitize him, Zhou Wen’s back was already covered in cold sweat. He increasingly felt that the bee wanted to parasitize their descendants.

Typically, humans and dimensional creatures definitely had incompatible reproductive organs, but something like the Heavenly Happiness Token was very odd. It might have a special effect to break through such restrictions.

The more Zhou Wen thought about it, the more terrified he became. He tried his best not to kneel, but his body involuntarily sank. He couldn’t stop it at all. All he could do was delay it a little.

On the other side, Tsukuyomi was also struggling with all her might, but it didn’t have much of an effect.

“No matter what it wants, I won’t let something you don’t like happen,” Tsukuyomi suddenly said. Her tone was odd as though it was filled with determination.

Zhou Wen and Tsukuyomi knelt side by side. Upon hearing her voice, he could only use the corner of his eye to look at Tsukuyomi. He saw her expression turn apodictic as a strange force was brewing in her. “You have a solution?” Zhou Wen was delighted. Since Tsukuyomi still had powers to use, they might be able to escape their present predicament.

“Yes.” Tsukuyomi nodded.

“Then quickly use it. I can’t hold on any longer. If you don’t use it, I’ll really kneel down.” Zhou Wen was delighted when he heard that as he hurriedly urged Tsukuyomi.

“You don’t have to worry. I’ve said it before. No one can force you to do something you don’t like in front of me.” As Tsukuyomi spoke, the force in her body intensified. Her entire body was like a volcano that was about to erupt.

Zhou Wen suddenly felt that something was amiss. He realized that blood was beginning to seep out of Tsukuyomi’s eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. The strength in her body was expanding as though it was about to explode. “What are you trying to do?” Zhou Wen hurriedly asked.

“The Heavenly Happiness Token can forcefully facilitate a marriage, but marriage is ultimately between two people. As long as one of them dies, the Heavenly Happiness Token will naturally be useless…” Tsukuyomi said.

“You are self-destructing!? Stop!” Zhou Wen immediately shouted.

Tsukuyomi’s strength showed no signs of stopping. Instead, it swelled even more. It was as though moonlight was seeping out of Tsukuyomi’s skin, making her body turn crystalline. Energy surged in her as though she would immediately explode. “I’ve said it before. As long as I’m around, no one can force you to do something you don’t like.” Tsukuyomi’s eyes were resolute, but she revealed a smile on her face and slowly said, “This is all I can do for you… Take care…”
