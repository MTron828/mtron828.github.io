Chapter 761: Invisibly Downloaded A Dungeon

Translator: CKtalon

In any piece of knowledge, the most difficult to remember were the unfamiliar professional terms and descriptions. As such words and descriptions were not usually used, there were not many ways to connect these terms to one’s knowledge system.

Just like a person from the West District, he didn’t know what the Dao was even if you let him read the scriptures. He also didn’t know what the Eight Trigrams was if you let him read the Iching. These words were very difficult for foreigners to form memories.

When Zhou Wen told the story, he turned these esoteric words into treasures in the story. It made Wang Chan find these treasures novel and interesting, allowing her to remember them. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“The story you made up is rather interesting, but the treasures in the story are different from the true meaning of the Essence Energy Art, right?” After Wang Chan finished hearing Zhou Wen’s story, she felt somewhat unsatisfied that it was over, but she also realized a problem.

“Although it’s different, it made you remember those words that were originally difficult to remember, right?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

Wang Chan thought about it and realized that she had memorized it. When she thought of those words, she found them a lot more vivid.

“In the future, when you learn those obscure Essence Energy Arts and Essence Energy Skills, treat them as a story. Treat the things you don’t understand as battles with various unknown dimensional creatures. After defeating them, the knowledge you obtain will be treasures,” Zhou Wen said.

“I’m not as delusional as you,” Wang Chan said.

“If you don’t even dare think about it and only learn to walk the path of others, what’s the point of such a life?” Zhou Wen said.

Wang Chan looked at Zhou Wen in a daze. All the experts in her family that taught her would tell her how powerful so-and-so Essence Energy Arts and Essence Energy Skills were, as well as their origins. They would talk about what it would be like if she mastered them.

No one had ever told her that no matter how powerful the Essence Energy Arts and Essence Energy Skills were, they were left behind by others. No matter how strong she became from cultivating them, she was ultimately inferior to others.

“Is it really okay to fantasize like this?” Wang Chan looked at Zhou Wen in a daze as though she was asking him, but also muttering to herself.

“Of course. There’s nothing in this world that you can’t think of or do. As long as you dare think of it, you will eventually think of a solution. The most important thing is that you dare think of it,” Zhou Wen said.

“I’ll give it a try in the future.” Wang Chan was about to say something when she heard her phone ring. It wasn’t someone calling her, but an alarm she had set.

“I need to return, but I’ll remember your story. I’ll also remember your words.” Wang Chan thought for a moment and said, “You are indeed as my sister said. You are a very special person.”

After Wang Chan left, Zhou Wen finally got some peace and began grinding.

However, when Zhou Wen lay on the bed, he suddenly heard a crack. The wooden bed then collapsed.

This was an ancient carved wood bed with a flower-engraved rack on it. The entire bed fell apart and immediately, Zhou Wen fell to the ground as the shattered wood hit him.

Zhou Wen’s injuries hadn’t healed. The wood couldn’t injure him, but when it hit him, the corners of his mouth twitched in pain.

What’s going on? My luck hasn’t been good recently. I can even break a bed? Zhou Wen was depressed.

Upon hearing the sound, the butler came over and was alarmed when he saw Zhou Wen. He hurriedly helped him up and got someone to tidy up the bed before changing it to a new bed.

In the next few days when Zhou Wen was recuperating, Wang Chan often secretly came to play with him.

However, for some reason, Zhou Wen was very unlucky every time Wang Chan came.

One time, Wang Chan ran over while Zhou Wen was eating. Just as Zhou Wen was about to finish the bowl of rice, he realized that there was half a worm in it. It nearly made him vomit all the rice he had eaten.

Zhou Wen suspected that his bad luck had something to do with Wang Chan. This was because Wang Chan would be beside him every time he was unlucky.

However, he thought for a moment and found it unlikely.

Wang Lu was Wang Chan’s sister. It was impossible for the people around her to be unlucky when she was such a lucky person.

However, there was something strange. Wang Chan always came to him when there was no one around. It was as if she didn’t want anyone to see her.

Zhou Wen only believed that the Wang family was strict and that they placed a lot of emphasis on her studies, so they didn’t give Wang Chan time to play. This resulted in her sneaking out, so he didn’t tell Wang Lu and Grandma Wang about this.

After a few days, Zhou Wen’s injuries healed significantly. Although he couldn’t engage in an intense battle, ordinary movements were no longer a problem. He left the Wang family and had a stroll.

Zhou Wen didn’t plan on returning to Luoyang. He had yet to settle the most important matter of his trip to the Imperial Capital.

Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and walked on the streets without anyone seeing him. He headed for the Ancient Sword Tomb.

The Ancient Sword Tomb was one of the Xia family’s important dimensional zones. Many sword-type Companion Beasts were obtained from the Ancient Sword Tomb. Therefore, Zhou Wen planned on heading to the Ancient Sword Tomb to take a look. If there was a tiny palm symbol, he could download an Ancient Sword Tomb dungeon.

Apart from the Ancient Sword Tomb, there were many dimensional zones in the Imperial Capital. Zhou Wen planned on making a trip to all of them.

The Ancient Sword Tomb was guarded by the Xia family’s guards, but they were useless against Zhou Wen. With the Invisibility Cloak, the guards couldn’t see him.

Zhou Wen used the power of the Godfiend Era and floated over without making a sound.

After searching outside the Ancient Sword Tomb for a while, he easily found a tiny palm symbol and snapped it.

My luck today is pretty good. Zhou Wen turned around and left the Ancient Sword Tomb in delight as he headed for the next dimensional zone.

On the way to his next destination, Ancient Sword Tomb finished downloading. However, it was inconvenient to use the phone while wearing the Invisibility Cloak. If he were to leave the phone unexposed, passersby would see a phone flying in the air. Timid ones would probably wet their pants in fright.

Zhou Wen’s second dimensional zone was the Thirteen Mausoleum.

It was an ancient royal cemetery. After the dimensional storms, it had also become a dimensional zone. It was rather magical inside with many good things available.

Furthermore, the Thirteen Mausoleum was a dimensional zone under the bureau. It forbade outsiders from entering. Zhou Wen had had a bad impression of the bureau. If it wasn’t for his serious injuries, he would definitely have made a trip to the bureau’s headquarters.

Now that he had yet to recover from his injuries, he couldn’t go to the bureau’s headquarters for the time being. However, it wasn’t a bad idea to take a picture of their dimensional zones.

His luck today was unexpectedly good. After Zhou Wen arrived at the Thirteen Mausoleum, he found the tiny palm symbol and successfully downloaded another game dungeon.

After leaving the Thirteen Mausoleum, Zhou Wen continued heading to the next dimensional zone. This time, the dimensional zone Zhou Wen went to was rather famous. It was the legendary Great Wall.
