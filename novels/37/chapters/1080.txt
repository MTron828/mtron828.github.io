After Cave Era was defeated, no Guardian challenged Ya again. Time ticked by until there was only one second left before another Guardian challenged Ya.

“Indeed, they won’t let Ya, a half-human, obtain first place so easily.” Zhang Chunqiu looked at the cube and sighed.

“Even the Cave Era with the power of time was defeated. Are there any Guardians with powers stronger than time?” Zhang Yuzhi asked in puzzlement.

Zhang Chunqiu smiled and said, “Time is indeed a very powerful attribute. In theory, time and space should be considered top-notch strength among all the various attributes. However, at that realm, the suppression between attributes isn’t the most important. The strength of a skill is also no longer an important criterion to determine one’s combat strength.”

“Then how do we determine who’s stronger and who’s weaker?” Zhang Yuzhi asked.

“It depends on whose willpower is stronger, whose intelligence is deeper, and whose in-combat improvisation is better. At that stage, there are only weak people, and no such thing as weak abilities. Any ability, even if it looks weak, can become the key to victory as long as it’s used properly.” Zhang Chunqiu paused before adding, “Of course, this is when the difference in strength isn’t too disparate. If the difference in strength is too great, it will be a different matter. However, Ya’s strength and ability should be considered top-notch on Earth. It’s unlikely that there’s a force on Earth that has absolute suppressive might on him.”

“Why can’t it appear? Didn’t you say that there’s the stronger Calamity grade above the Terror grade?” Zhang Yuzhi still wore a puzzled expression.

“The Calamity grade can naturally crush the Terror grade, but in a place like Earth, there are only two possibilities for a Calamity-grade creature to appear. The first is the descent of a Calamity-grade powerhouse from the dimension. However, the dimension’s Calamity-grade powerhouse will be restricted by the rules of Earth after its descent. It’s impossible for them to unleash the strength of the Calamity grade. If they forcefully use their Calamity-grade strength, they might even be reduced to the Mythical stage by the rules.”

Zhang Chunqiu thought before continuing, “There’s another possibility. After a Guardian contracts a human, they can use the bodies of humans to advance to the Calamity grade. Too little time has been given to the Guardians born in this era. Let alone advancing to the Calamity grade, there aren’t even many at the Terror grade. Therefore, if a Calamity-grade creature appears on Earth, the only possibility is that it is from the Calamity-grade Guardians that survived the previous war.”

“Like the one in our Fiend Tomb?” Zhang Yuzhi asked.

Zhang Chunqiu didn’t answer and continued, “However, although the Guardians who survived the battle are extremely powerful, the humans who contracted them can’t live that long. After leaving the humans, their strength will once again be suppressed by the rules of Earth. Even if they have the strength of the Calamity grade, it’s impossible for them to use it on Earth unless they contract humans again.”

“There are so many humans on Earth. It shouldn’t be difficult to find a contractor, right?” Zhang Yuzhi said after some thought.

“It’s not that easy. There is some kind of restriction. Do you think the one in our family doesn’t want to come out?” Zhang Chunqiu smiled and said, “In short, it looks like Ya still has a chance. As long as he can survive the next challenge from the dimension, he might very well become the final victor.”

“Brother, do you wish for Ya to win or for him to lose?” Zhang Yuzhi blinked and asked.

“From my standpoint, I hope he wins, but his chances aren’t high,” Zhang Chunqiu answered.

The person challenging Ya was a Guardian named Jiuyue. It was a very unfamiliar name. He had never appeared on the rankings before, so no one knew what abilities he had.

After the battle began, people immediately knew what ability he had because the characteristics of his ability were too obvious.

Teleportation—constant teleportation. Ya’s continuous attacks failed to touch any part of Jiuyue’s clothes.

However, Jiuyue had no intention of counterattacking. If Ya attacked, he would teleport and dodge. If Ya didn’t attack, he wouldn’t move either. Instead of calling it a battle, it looked more like he was stalling for time.

Ya didn’t launch any meaningless attacks as he took on his Terror form. His body transformed into a beam of light, but Jiuyue could also enter the Terror form. After doing so, he vanished even more thoroughly than Ya.

However, the Terror-form Jiuyue still had no intention of counterattacking. He continued dodging. Now, anyone could tell that Jiuyue was stalling for time. They just didn’t understand why he was stalling.

“What does Jiuyue want? If he wants to expend Ya’s Essence Energy, that shouldn’t be right. The Essence Energy he expends when teleporting is much more than Ya,” Xia Xuanyue said in thought as she looked at the cube’s screen.

Xia Liuchuan looked at the screen and frowned. “I have an ominous feeling. I’m afraid this battle for first place won’t end so easily.”

“Why do you say that?” Xia Xuanyue asked in puzzlement.

“I don’t know. It’s just a hunch.” Xia Liuchuan shook his head slightly, but his expression was solemn.

Just as Xia Xuanyue had said, Jiuyue was constantly teleporting in his Terror form, and the expenditure was much greater than Ya’s. If he continued fighting, Ya would definitely win.

However, Ya didn’t continue attacking. He stopped and left his Terror form. He sat down in the arena and placed Primordial Immortal Sword on his lap.

“Why aren’t you fighting?” Jiuyue had also left his Terror form as he looked at Ya and asked in puzzlement.

“Don’t you need time to prepare to deal with me? I’ll give you time,” Ya said indifferently.

Jiuyue looked at Ya with a complicated expression. “You know that I need time to deal with you. Why don’t you defeat me as soon as possible? If you are fast enough, you might be able to avoid a lot of trouble.”

“What will be, will be. Besides, I’m not afraid of trouble,” Ya said.

“No regrets?” Jiuyue asked Ya.

“Life isn’t about regret, but about doing what you want to do,” Ya answered.

Jiuyue looked at Ya and sighed. “If I had met you earlier, we might have become friends.”

“We won’t become friends. I stopped making friends long ago,” Ya said.

“Why?” Jiuyue asked Ya in a daze.

“Because I only have one life. I can’t give it all to them when there are too many friends,” Ya answered.

Jiuyue didn’t say a word when he heard that. He only looked at Ya silently. After a moment, Jiuyue said, “If you attack now, you still have a chance if you can defeat me in fifteen minutes.”

Ya had no intention of moving. He continued sitting there with his eyes closed. Jiuyue looked at him and asked, “Do you think I’m lying to you?”

“No, I believe you are telling the truth,” Ya said with certainty.

“Then why aren’t you fighting?” Jiuyue asked curiously.

“Because I don’t want to be your friend, I won’t take anything that belongs to you,” Ya said.

Jiuyue looked at Ya with a strange look in his eyes. After a while, he wanted to say something, but his expression suddenly changed. He looked into the void and sighed. “It’s too late now.”

In the void, a beam descended, illuminating the entire cube’s arena.
