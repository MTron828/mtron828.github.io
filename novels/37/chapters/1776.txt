Chapter 1777 Transcendent Immortal

“Interesting.” The female Immortal didn’t seem to feel any pressure as she watched Zhong Ziya with interest.

Zhong Ziya’s attack trajectory was becoming more and more incomprehensible. The female Immortal watched for a while before seemingly coming up with something. She narrowed her eyes and said, “In that case, I’ll let you evolve more thoroughly. Let me see how much your so-called Super Evolution can evolve.”

As she spoke, the female Immortal stopped all her actions and stood there, no longer dodging Zhong Ziya’s attacks.

Zhong Ziya’s fist was less than ten centimeters away from the female Immortal’s face, but without any obstruction, Zhong Ziya’s fist seemed to freeze. It stopped moving. Even his entire body seemed to freeze in midair as though it was a frozen scene.

Such a scene made the spectators think that the livestream was stuck, but they quickly realized that it wasn’t a pause in the livestream. Zhong Ziya was frozen in midair.

“My New World is right in front of you. Continue your evolution.” The female Immortal looked at Zhong Ziya calmly without any intention of taking the opportunity to kill him.

Zhong Ziya’s eyes burned like flames as he stared at the female Immortal. It was as though he was about to combust, but his body couldn’t move at all.

The sliver of hope that rose in everyone’s hearts was instantly crushed.

At that moment, everyone understood that the hope they imagined was just an illusion.

The female Immortal had never used her true strength to fight Zhong Ziya. Instead of calling it a battle, it was better to say that she was just playing a game.

This blow instantly sank many people’s hearts into a bottomless abyss. The combat strength displayed by both parties was on a completely different level. If the female Immortal really wanted Zhong Ziya dead, Zhong Ziya would have died countless times.

Even Zhang Chunqiu, Xia Liuchuan, and the other top humans frowned when they saw this scene. Their expressions were extremely nasty.

“The difference between the Calamity grade and the Apocalypse grade is too great. Without entering the Apocalypse grade, humans are still lambs waiting to be slaughtered in front of dimensional powerhouses,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a sigh.

“Villains die from talking too much. That female Immortal is too arrogant. Perhaps Zhong Ziya will make her regret her actions,” Xia Liuchuan said through gritted teeth.

Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say a word as he stared at the Cube’s screen.

Zhou Wen also stared intently at the Cube’s screen. This was the first time he had seen the power of the Apocalypse grade so clearly. The power had already exceeded the Calamity grade’s understanding of power. He was momentarily unable to analyze what power it belonged to.

However, the word “New World” mentioned by the female Immortal made Zhou Wen confirm that the New World ability Demonic Neonate had was undoubtedly an Apocalypse-grade ability.

A Calamity-grade has the ability of the Apocalypse grade, but her physique hasn’t reached the Apocalypse grade. Does Demonic Neonate have the ability to fight an Apocalypse-grade? Zhou Wen thought to himself, but he had no answer. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Could the difference between the Calamity grade and the Apocalypse grade really be that great? They can’t even move in front of an Apocalypse-grade powerhouse?” Li Xuan said in despair.

The abilities Zhong Ziya displayed made Li Xuan sigh at his inferiority. However, such a Zhong Ziya was akin to a bug toyed by a cat in front of the female Immortal. When she was sick of toying with him, she could smack him to death with a swipe of her claw. This made Li Xuan feel sad for the loss of his kind.

“No, he’s moving. He’s just moving very slowly,” Jiang Yan said calmly.

When everyone heard Jiang Yan’s words, they couldn’t help but take a closer look. Indeed, they realized that Zhong Ziya was moving, but his movement was so slow that they couldn’t even see it with the naked eye. He was even slower than a snail’s crawl.

“So close, yet so far. Zhong Ziya is less than ten centimeters away from the female Immortal, but it’s as though he’s worlds apart. It’s not that his speed has slowed down, but the space between them has changed.” Zhou Wen had already noticed it and knew a little more.

Trajectory Seeking suddenly added, “You’re right. That female Immortal is a supreme powerhouse of the Immortals. She’s known as a Transcendent Immortal. Even at the Apocalypse grade, she’s an extremely powerful existence. Her New World is called Transcendent Heaven. In her New World, you are confined within the heavens, but she stands beyond it. No matter how close you are to her, that’s a distance between the heavens and the earth. Only she can injure others, but no one can injure her.”

Although Trajectory Seeking didn’t use the honorific title of teacher when speaking to Zhou Wen, she no longer had the contempt from before. It was obvious that she gave Zhou Wen some recognition.

“What the hell is this ability? Doesn’t that mean that they aren’t in the same world? It’s impossible for Zhong Ziya to injure her?” Li Xuan said gloomily.

“Having a Calamity-grade battle an Apocalypse-grade is unfair to begin with,” Trajectory Seeking said. “If it wasn’t for the fact that the Transcendent Immortal is somewhat interested in Zhong Ziya’s abilities, he would have died countless times. This is a battle which has long had an outcome determined.”

“That might not be the case.” Jiang Yan stared at Zhong Ziya, who was at an absolute disadvantage, and slowly said, “That person isn’t a man who will easily admit defeat.”

“So what if he doesn’t admit defeat? In front of absolute strength, all techniques are useless,” Trajectory Seeking said.

Boom!

Just as Trajectory Seeking finished speaking, they suddenly heard an explosion from the Cube’s screen. They saw Zhong Ziya’s long hair fluttering in the wind, his eyes blood-red like burning blood-colored flames.

His body was abnormally pumping with blood. His skin seemed to be covered in a layer of crystalline sanguine light as his entire body seemed to be enveloped by a thin blood-colored halo.

As the sanguine light on his body intensified, his body began to move as though the power of the New World was ineffective against him.

“Transcendent Heaven’s power failed!” Li Xuan was pleasantly surprised.

“It’s not that the power of Transcendent Heaven has failed, but Zhong Ziya’s speed is becoming faster. He’s so fast that he can instantly cross worlds. It’s difficult to stop his speed…” Zhou Wen was also very happy.

“You’re too long-winded. I’ve already told you that powers that can’t kill me will become stepping stones for me to scale the peak to victory. I’ll use your blood and bones to forge my victory. Swallow the evil fruit you planted.” Zhong Ziya’s voice was as cold as ice, but his blood-red eyes were fiery. The sanguine light on his body erupted like a volcano.

At that instant, his body completely recovered its mobility. The power of Transcendent Heaven seemed to lose its effect on him.

Zhong Ziya was like a hellish devil burning with blood flames. His fist that flickered with blood flames swung crazily at the female Immortal’s face like a blood-colored bolt of lightning. He traversed the ten centimeters instantly.

“He’s about to turn the tables!” Li Xuan was delighted

The billions of humans watching also felt the same joy as him. They couldn’t contain their excitement and had the urge to throw out a punch with Zhong Ziya.

What New World, what Transcendent Heaven, what Apocalypse grade? In front of humans who could evolve infinitely, they were all trash. They would all be smashed to death.

Bang!

In the next second, Zhong Ziya’s body suddenly sank. A white hand struck Zhong Ziya’s head, slamming him into the hard rocky ground. His body and limbs twisted into a strange angle.

The blood flames on Zhong Ziya’s body instantly vanished as all his bones were shattered by the strike.

He tried his best, struggling to get up, but he only managed to raise his head slightly before having it plop down. He had lost consciousness and it was unknown if he was dead or alive.

“Super Evolution? Is that it?” The female Immortal was somewhat disappointed. She didn’t look at Zhong Ziya again as though she had just smacked an ant to death.

The Cube’s screen turned black at that moment. It was like a bottomless abyss that devoured the confidence and dignity of all humans. It seemed to cast a spell on the people who had been dancing with joy. Their expressions were ugly as they stood there in a daze. They were at a loss. Most of them were extremely disappointed.

Without any other miracles, Zhong Ziya was defeated.

The female Immortal had given Zhong Ziya all the conditions for growth, but Zhong Ziya was still squashed by a single palm strike. He died like a bug without any dignity.
