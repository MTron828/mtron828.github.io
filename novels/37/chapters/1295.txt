Chapter 1296: Another Way to Get on the Rankings

The reward was good, but one had to have the ability to get it. Although people called Zhou Wen Deceit King, Zhou Wen wasn’t someone without a bottom line. He definitely wouldn’t do something he wasn’t confident of.

After rejecting Liu Yun’s invitation, Zhou Wen decided to do further studies. Regardless of how many stars he could obtain in the end, he would first clear the Venusian instance dungeon.

To be honest, Zhou Wen really coveted the Lady Luck Necklace. There were too few Companion Beasts that added Luck.

If one was lucky, not only would there be a higher chance of a Companion Eggs dropping while grinding dungeons, but the effect of flawless evasion would also become stronger.

Is there a better way to clear the level if I don’t want to fight the Calamity-grade bullet head on??Zhou Wen frowned in thought.

In fact, there was a method, but Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if it was useful in reality.

Previously, Zhou Wen had always wanted to kill the Calamity entity that shot the bullet, so he had studied the method to resist the seventh bullet. However, if he only wanted to reach the Golden Palace, it wouldn’t be that troublesome.

Grim Reaper No. 10 could withstand the first six shots. The seventh shot could be avoided using a Terror-grade Companion Beast as a scapegoat. Following that would be six more shots.

Such a long period gave him sufficient time to run to the Golden Palace.

Of course, the premise was that Calamity-grade bullets were the same as in-game—it prioritized the creatures with the highest levels first.

If I do it that way, I still have to sacrifice a Terror-grade Companion Beast to reach the Golden Palace.?After some thought, Zhou Wen realized that this was the only solution for now. Furthermore, he still needed to give it a try.

In-game, there was no such thing as a reward from reaching the Golden Palace. The Golden Palace’s door didn’t open either. It seemed like he had to kill the Calamity-grade creature.

However, Zhou Wen felt that clearing the level in real life wasn’t a problem. After watching the Holy Spirit Association clear the level, he was basically certain that Calamity-grade bullets would target the strongest creature. However, he couldn’t rule out any special circumstances.

Liu Yun sent a few more messages, constantly attempting to persuade Zhou Wen.

“I can take this job, but there are two conditions.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and replied.

“Tell me.” Liu Yun was delighted. Although Lord Fourth was mainly inviting Deceit King, if he helped close the deal, he as Thief Sage could obtain valuable benefits.

“I want the Lady Luck Necklace. In addition, prepare a Terror-grade Companion Beast for me. I’ll take payment before doing anything. Furthermore, I’m only in charge of issuing orders. If anyone doesn’t follow instructions, I won’t be responsible for the results, nor can I guarantee absolute safety.” Zhou Wen said.

“This… Typically, people get a 50% down payment first and receive the rest after the matter is done.” Liu Yun said.

“These are my rules. If you want to work with me, you have to follow my rules. Otherwise, let him find someone else.” Although Zhou Wen really wanted the Lady Luck Necklace, he wouldn’t give in.

Furthermore, such matters couldn’t be accommodated. Since he was leading people in, he hoped to bring them out alive.

“Alright, I’ll talk to Lord Fourth and see what he has to say.” After Liu Yun sent the message, there was no response from him for a long time.

Zhou Wen wasn’t in a rush. After all, he had to make some preparations. Safety first. If Lord Fourth really wanted to go, he had to prepare a few Substitute Talismans. Life-preservation was of utmost priority.

How do I reach the six paths behind Netherworld City? I’ll try to see if I can grind some Heavenly Robe. Wearing Heavenly Robe inside my armor might save me at critical moments.?Zhou Wen had always wanted to go to Netherworld City, but he was at a loss regarding the last thousand-year dream.

Zhou Wen was just about to take out a piece of paper and a pen to see if he could draw some Substitute Talismans when he heard his phone chime again.

“Lord Fourth has agreed to your conditions. He hopes to meet you and have a detailed chat. The time and place will be decided by you. Lord Fourth will come alone.” Liu Yun sent an update over.

“That fast?” Zhou Wen frowned.

Liu Yun understood Zhou Wen’s concerns and sent a message. “With my understanding of Lord Fourth, this shouldn’t be a problem. However, one can’t let down their guard. It’s best if you choose a place that can guarantee your safety.”

Zhou Wen thought for a moment and sent a message. “I don’t have time now. I’ll contact you when I do.”

He had promised An Sheng to take care of the family. He couldn’t leave randomly before An Sheng and company returned. It wouldn’t be too late to go after they returned.

“Then when will you be free? Lord Fourth is very anxious,” Liu Yun said.

Zhou Wen didn’t reply. Liu Yun was somewhat depressed, but it wasn’t appropriate for him to tell Lord Fourth straight to the face. All he could do was send a message to Lord Fourth, saying that Deceit King had something important to do first. He would contact him after he was done.

Lord Fourth was very straightforward. He said that he would wait for Deceit King’s schedule to clear up. He had already prepared the Lady Luck Necklace and a Terror-grade Companion Beast. Deceit King could have them whenever he wanted.

Liu Yun sent a message to Zhou Wen, conveying Lord Fourth’s intentions, but he didn’t receive a reply.

Zhou Wen grinded dungeons daily and studied the use of Absolute Space, waiting for An Sheng to return.

Before An Sheng returned, someone challenged the Venusian dimensional zone. This time, it was the League of Guardians. However, Immortal wasn’t among the people who came.

Cave Era, Uesugi Nao, and Jiuyue appeared in the Venusian dimensional zone. There were only three of them.

Everyone was puzzled as to why Immortal hadn’t come. He was the core of the League of Guardians. It seemed a little too rash for him to be missing for a huge matter like attempting the Venusian dimensional zone.

However, the performance of the trio made people realise that there was more than one path in the world. There was also more than one way to resolve the problem.

After Cave Era and Jiuyue augmented Uesugi Nao with the power of time and space, Uesugi Nao’s Great Skyfiend Guardian unleashed unparalleled speed.

After the sixth Golden Battle God was killed, Uesugi Nao—or perhaps Great Skyfiend—rushed into the pathway like a phantom.

When the Calamity-grade gunshot sounded, Great Skyfiend wasn’t hit. She seemed to have dodged it. As she was so fast, few people saw how she had dodged.

Following that, it was time for Uesugi Nao to perform. She was really like a divine devil. Her body was like a phantom as she dodged the bullets again and again. She rushed to the Golden Palace before the seventh bullet shot out and obtained the golden ball from the Golden Palace. At the same time, she entered the rankings.

Everything happened too quickly. Before anyone could react, Great Skyfiend’s name had already appeared on the rankings. There were two stars behind her name.

“How did she do it?” Everyone widened their eyes in disbelief as they looked at the name that was third on the rankings.
