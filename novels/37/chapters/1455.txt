Chapter 1456: Stone-Elemental Zone

After Zhou Wen had completely digested the Essence Energy, he opened his eyes and realized that Tsukuyomi was still sitting opposite him, looking at him with a smile.

“Is the flesh and blood of Calamity creatures so nutritious?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

He had killed Calamity-grade creatures before, but he didn’t realize that their flesh was so invigorating.

“That’s not always the case.” Tsukuyomi put down her sake cup and said, “Only a portion of Human Realm creatures can preserve most of their energy in their bodies after death. It’s always the case for Hell level creatures.”

“This fellow is at the Hell level?” As Zhou Wen spoke, he turned to look at the roasted alien beast, but he realized that there was no sign of the alien beast’s corpse. The flames below had vanished, leaving only two bare stone mountains.

“You’re done eating?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

“I don’t like meat, but the ghosts in my domain like it very much,” Tsukuyomi answered.

“I never expected a Companion Beast to be edible. Furthermore, it’s so delicious!” The image of the Great Might Vajra Bull surfaced in his mind. He wondered if he could turn it into steak.

As though reading Zhou Wen’s mind, Tsukuyomi said with a smile, “Typical Companion Beasts are pure energy bodies. They can be treated as Essence Energy Crystals, but if you want to eat them, they have to at least reach the Human Realm. They might not be edible even at the Human Realm.”

“I see!” Zhou Wen was somewhat disappointed.

“Are you full?” Tsukuyomi put down her sake cup and asked.

“I’m stuffed. Thank you.” Zhou Wen thanked Tsukuyomi for treating him to the meat. It was very likely Hell-level meat. Ordinary people didn’t have a chance to eat it.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t know that there were differences between Hell-level meat. The few pieces he ate weren’t meat from the ordinary parts.

“There’s no need to thank me. Follow me if you’re done.” Tsukuyomi got up and led him to a mountain range.

“Where are you going?” Zhou Wen asked.

“There’s a dimensional zone here that I can’t deal with myself. You will help me, right?” Tsukuyomi said with a smile.

“What kind of dimensional zone is it? Let’s study it first. How far have you explored it?” Zhou Wen couldn’t reject it since he had just eaten the meat.

“I’ve already explored the situation inside. It’s just that it’s not easy to kill a particular dimensional creature. Your sword should be useful. You just need to help me with the sword,” Tsukuyomi said.

Zhou Wen felt relieved when he heard Tsukuyomi’s words. Since Tsukuyomi was so confident, there shouldn’t be any problems.

He followed Tsukuyomi deeper into the mountain range. There were rocks everywhere, and there were no signs of life.

However, on second thought, it made sense. Apart from Earth, Zhou Wen had never heard of any planet having ordinary lifeforms. Even if there were, they were basically dimensional creatures.

Tsukuyomi stopped in front of a cave and pointed inside. “This is the entrance to the dimensional zone. The dimensional creatures inside are all stone-elemental. You can deal with the ordinary dimensional creatures, but leave the final Calamity-grade creature to me. After I hold it down, you can kill it with that sword.”

Zhou Wen naturally nodded in agreement and followed Tsukuyomi into the cave. He didn’t discover any dimensional creatures at first. When the rocks in the cave came to life and transformed into stone beasts, Zhou Wen realized that the dimensional creatures here were purely stone-elemental.

These ordinary stone beasts were at least at the Mythical stage. Occasionally, he would encounter a Terror-grade stone beast.

It gave Zhou Wen the perfect opportunity to test the new Bamboo Blade. He drew his blade and started slashing. The Mythical stone beast’s defense was rather powerful, but Zhou Wen didn’t use much strength before the Bamboo Blade sliced through their bodies.

The blade of the Bamboo Blade was very thin, making it non-optimal to use against stone beasts with all sorts of defensive skills. However, the new Bamboo Blade’s performance left Zhou Wen somewhat surprised.

A jade-like stone beast pounced at him. It was like a Luck Beast. It remained visible after its Terror transformation, but its body was extremely hard. The defensive halos on its body made it obvious that it was a dimensional creature that was very good at defense.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that it would be difficult for the new Bamboo Blade to kill such a creature.

However, Zhou Wen managed to behead the beast by slashing out the saber with all his might.

What alloy did Ah Sheng add to the Bamboo Blade? The strength of this Bamboo Blade is probably comparable to the Immortal Culling Sword!?Zhou Wen looked at the blade and couldn’t help but be surprised that it wasn’t damaged at all.

“That blade isn’t bad,” Tsukuyomi said as she glanced at the blade in Zhou Wen’s hand.

Even an existence like Tsukuyomi acknowledged its quality, exceeding Zhou Wen’s expectations. He knew that it wouldn’t be easy to return the favor.

After slicing open the Terror-grade stone beast’s body, he discovered a stone egg.

Zhou Wen took out the stone egg and looked at Tsukuyomi. Tsukuyomi said indifferently, “That thing is useless to me. Keep it if you want it.”

Zhou Wen didn’t stand on ceremony as he put away the Companion Egg and continued following Tsukuyomi deeper into the cave.

Along the way, Zhou Wen picked up quite a number of dimensional crystals and Companion Beasts, but only one Terror-grade Companion Egg dropped.

The stone-type dimensional creatures here had very high Strength and Constitution. There were many defensive and Strength-type skills, but they weren’t the types Zhou Wen needed.

Boom!

When they arrived at a huge underground space, the underground rocks trembled as a stone behemoth crawled out of the cracks.

Zhou Wen took a careful look and realized that it was a huge stone turtle. However, it wasn’t strictly one. Its head was covered in horns and there was a stone beard under its chin.

Furthermore, there was a huge stone monument on its back.

This appearance made Zhou Wen recall the mythical son of the dragon, Ba Xia. The dragon had given birth to nine sons, and each one was different. Ba Xia had the image of a turtle carrying a stone monument—it looked rather similar to this huge fellow. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The stone monument on the stone beast’s back lit up while Zhou Wen was still observing it.

There were many symbols engraved on the stone monument that Zhou Wen couldn’t understand. The symbols emitted a strange glow.

Zhou Wen hurriedly used the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation to block the light, but Tsukuyomi remained motionless.

Zhou Wen soon realized that the light emitted by the stone monument wasn’t lethal to them, but the rocks that were illuminated by the light grew strangely.

The originally huge underground space shrank due to the growth of the rocks. The stone tunnel they had entered was completely blocked by the burgeoning rocks.

This fellow’s strength is really special, Zhou Wen thought.

Tsukuyomi had already activated her Hundred Ghost Zone, and her surroundings seemed to turn black. Only Tsukuyomi’s body emitted a holy light like the bright moon.

Ghouls appeared in the cave and charged at the stone beast.
