Chapter 840: Red Heart Gu

Translator: CKtalon

The naked eye couldn’t see anything wrong with the ruby necklace, but when Zhou Wen activated the Hell King Life Soul, he realized that there was a blood-colored shadow in the largest ruby in the middle of the pendant. It looked like a spider.

“What’s this? A Spirit Body?” Zhou Wen asked Ya’er.

“Gu,” Ya’er said.

This is also a Gu? Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised. No matter how he looked at it, there was a Spirit Body inside the ruby.

However, on second thought, it made sense. No one stipulated that Gu with a spirit body could not exist. The spider in the ruby was likely a spirit-type Gu.

It’s no wonder Ya’er took this necklace. So there’s such a strange Gu inside. I wonder what stage it is. Zhou Wen took out his phone and snapped a picture of the ruby with the spider.

To Zhou Wen’s surprise, the stats appeared. Furthermore, it wasn’t a dimensional creature, but a Companion Beast.

Red Heart Gu: Mythical

Life Providence: Widow

Life Soul: Queen of Hearts

Wheel of Destiny: Love Gu

Strength: 72

Speed: 80

Constitution: 71

Essence Energy: 80

Talent Skill: Neurotoxin

Companion Form: Pendant

This is a Companion Beast that has already hatched, but why is it here? Where did its owner go? Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

Logically speaking, once the owner of a Companion Beast died, the Companion Beast would vanish.

This Red Heart Gu had clearly hatched, but it was trapped in the necklace. Its owner had not unsummoned it, so this was somewhat strange.

Zhou Wen wanted to ask Liu Yun about the necklace’s origins, but he couldn’t find him. All he could do was search for pictures online to see if there were any clues.

It was very easy to find the origins of the necklace. Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be surprised. This necklace has been circulating since ancient times before the dimensional storms. Furthermore, from the looks of it, the culprit behind the fates of those who possessed it was likely the Red Heart Gu. This makes things strange. Did they already have Companion Beasts in that era?

Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out. He asked Ya’er, but she couldn’t answer.

“You can control the Red Heart Gu inside, right?” Zhou Wen asked Ya’er.

Ya’er nodded. In fact, all the pain Liu Yun had suffered along the way was because of this Red Heart Gu.

“Then keep it. If you encounter danger in the future, you can protect yourself.” Zhou Wen returned the necklace to Ya’er.

Ya’er shook her head and said a few words. “For you... Raise me... Don’t... throw me away...”

Zhou Wen suddenly realized that Ya’er was a human and not his Companion Beast when he heard that. His attitude towards her seemed to make her feel insecure.

Zhou Wen picked up the necklace and put it on Ya’er. He stroked her head and said, “I gave you your name. Do you know who’s qualified to give others a name?”

Ya’er shook her head. Clearly, she didn’t understand because she didn’t have a name previously.

Zhou Wen said, “Only family members can give their children names. I gave you your name. You are my family and my sister, so you don’t have to worry about me abandoning you. That kind of thing will never happen. Do you understand?”

Ya’er looked at Zhou Wen and shook her head. She didn’t seem to understand the concept of family.

“It’s fine. You will slowly understand in the future. A family member doesn’t need you to give them anything. I will treat you well. I will accompany you, sharing sadness and joy with you...” Zhou Wen tried his best to make Ya’er understand. Unfortunately, he was a person with a low EQ, so he just couldn’t express it well.

As the necklace was too eye-catching, and Zhou Wen wasn’t someone who loved antiques, he ended up dismantling the necklace and separated the pendant embedded inside.

The gems outside were just decorations. The ruby in the middle and a thin thread were the main body of the Red Heart Gu. Zhou Wen only needed the main body of the Red Heart Gu to be worn around Ya’er’s neck. He kept the gem necklace to prevent any unnecessary trouble.

As he had noticed Ya’er’s psychological problems, Zhou Wen clumsily wanted to treat her better, but he didn’t know what to do.

As Zhou Wen had been very independent since he was young, he had never experienced how his elders protected and loved him. Therefore, he didn’t know how to treat others well.

Zhou Wen could only do his best. He took the time to take Ya’er out for a walk and buy her some food or toys. However, Zhou Wen didn’t know what girls played. In fact, he didn’t know what boys played either because he had never played with any toys when he was young.

After some thought, Zhou Wen bought a phone for Ya’er and taught her how to use it. He also added his account to her friend’s list. This way, Ya’er could send him a message or call him when he wasn’t around.

Ya’er seemed very happy and fiddled with her phone for a long time. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, she wasn’t interested in games or movies. She only learned how to use her phone to send messages to Zhou Wen, but she didn’t know how to type or write. Even when she sent voice messages, she didn’t say much. It was very troublesome.

However, Ya’er worked hard to learn language and how to type.

Zhou Wen took out his phone and continued grinding. His luck today was pretty good. Just as the nine dragons respawned, another Companion Egg dropped after killing them.

Demon Blood True Dragon (Zhen): Mythical

Life Providence: Demon Dragon Bloodline (Incomplete)

Life Soul: Zhen Dragon (Incomplete)

Wheel of Destiny: Dragon Domain (Incomplete)

Strength: 80

Speed: 80

Constitution: 80

Essence Energy: 80

Talent Skill: Dragon Breath, Demon Dragon Transformation, Demon Dragon True Body, Dragon Wrath

Companion Form: Dragon Scale Armor (Incomplete)

If it wasn’t for the fact that the word “Zhen” behind the Demon Dragon True Dragon was different, Zhou Wen would have imagined that it was the same Companion Egg that had dropped. Its stats and skills were identical.

I wonder if this thing can be fused? Zhou Wen tried matching it and realized that the compatibility between the two was 99%. It was almost impossible to fail.

Zhou Wen directly clicked on the fusion. After all, he couldn’t wear two sets of Dragon Scale Armor alone. He could try fusing them. Perhaps there would be a pleasant surprise.

However, a notification suddenly popped up in the game: ‘Incomplete. Lacking main body, unable to fuse.’

What’s the meaning of this? Zhou Wen didn’t know what the so-called main body was. He could only guess that he needed to obtain all nine different Demon Blood True Dragons before fusing them.

Zhou Wen had been grinding on Pill Furnace Mountain, but he didn’t obtain any Mythical Companion Eggs.

The dragon-patterned Rejuvenation Pill and the Tiger-Patterned Resurrection Pill would randomly spawn one every time. However, Zhou Wen hadn’t had a Companion Egg drop in the past few days.
