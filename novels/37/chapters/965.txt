Chapter 966: Dragon Pearl Companion Egg

Translator: CKtalon

After Zhou Wen figured out the situation in the Seven Dragons Sea, he realized that they weren’t proper dragon monarchs.

Miya was already considered the most normal dragon in the Seven Dragons Sea. According to her, the dragon monarchs in the other six dimensional zones didn’t have true dragon forms.

Some looked like crocodiles, some looked like lobsters, and one looked like a whale. However, because all of them had some dragon blood in them, they called themselves dragon monarchs.

That Seven Seas Dragon King shouldn’t be a purebred dragon king. In Zhou Wen’s impression, a purebred dragon king had to be like the white dragon in Dragon’s Well.

If it were any other time, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have gone to unknown dimensional zones to kill the dimensional creatures. However, with Miya’s intelligence, things were different.

As long as Miya’s information was correct, it wasn’t difficult for Zhou Wen to rush into the dimensional zones to kill the dragon monarchs. After all, it was impossible for those single Mythical creatures to be a match for his divine pet lineup.

“Do you think that if we were to fight the Seven Seas Dragon King to the death, those dragon monarchs would help him and become our enemy?” Zhou Wen slowly got more information from Miya.

“If the Seven Seas Dragon King summons them, they wouldn’t dare disobey orders,” said Miya.

“Alright, I’ll get rid of the trouble first. Wait for my good news in the Dragon Palace,” Zhou Wen said as he prepared to leave.

“Stop,” Miya called out.

Does that not work?

Zhou Wen believed that Miya had seen through his thoughts.

“You are a human after all. If you walk in the sea, you will definitely be discovered. Here’s a dragon pearl. Take it with you. As long as you aren’t close to a Mythical creature, it will be difficult to discover you. It also provides a certain level of water warding.” Miya handed a pearl to Zhou Wen.

“How can I accept this?” Zhou Wen looked at the bead and was somewhat embarrassed to take it.

He only wanted to use Miya’s intelligence to achieve his goal of killing monsters. He felt somewhat embarrassed that Miya would give him something.

“It’s nothing; you are risking your life for us sisters after all.” Miya clearly believed that Zhou Wen really wanted to help them.

Zhou Wen blushed slightly. Although he did wish to help Miya and Qin Ling, he mostly wanted to use Miya’s intelligence to kill dimensional creatures to obtain more resources.

“Ahem, alright then. I’ll take it. I’ll return it to you in the future.” Zhou Wen took the dragon pearl and realized that it was a Companion Egg.

“There’s no need to be surprised. This is something my father left behind after he died. Since you want to help us sisters, let it aid you. If you have the ability, you can hatch it and use it to fight the Seven Seas Dragon King,” said Miya.

Zhou Wen was really embarrassed as a result. Miya seemed to completely trust him. It made Zhou Wen feel uneasy that she was willing to give him such a thing.

He had originally planned on helping as much as he could. All he needed to do was do his best. If he really wasn’t a match for him, he could retreat.

However, seeing that Miya seemed to have placed all her hopes on him, he felt a little uncomfortable running away if he really couldn’t kill the Seven Seas Dragon King.

You trust people too easily. If you were to encounter someone evil in the future, you might even end up helping them count the money they received from selling you. Zhou Wen sighed inwardly and put away the dragon pearl Companion Egg before leaving the Sea God Reef dimensional zone.

I should let Feng Qiuyan know about this matter first. Otherwise, I won’t be able to kill the Seven Seas Dragon King. Once the Seven Seas Dragon King takes revenge, I wonder if it will implicate the entire Feng family because of Qin Ling. Zhou Wen decided to return to the Feng family first. After telling Feng Qiuyan about this matter, it wouldn’t be too late to head to the other six dimensional zones in the Seven Dragons Sea.

Just as Zhou Wen left Sea God Reef, he bumped into someone. The person was walking in the direction of Sea God Reef and was taken aback when he saw Zhou Wen.

“Are you going to the Dragon Palace?” Zhou Wen asked her. This person was naturally Qin Ling. She clearly wanted to go to the Sea God Reef.

“What Dragon Palace? I just want to go to Sea God Reef to hunt dimensional creatures,” Qin Ling said.

“I’ve met Miya,” Zhou Wen said.

Qin Ling’s expression immediately changed as she bit her lip and stared at Zhou Wen. “Will you tell Qiuyan about me?”

“Yes,” Zhou Wen answered with certainty. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Ling’s pupils immediately constricted as she stared intently at Zhou Wen. A terrifying aura rose from her body as her originally black pupils turned golden. Even her skin began to show faint golden scales. Her strength was clearly nothing like an Epic being.

She had half a Golden Dragon bloodline. Apart from the Epic strength of humans, there was an even more terrifying power hidden in her body.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if a mixed-blood like her could inherit all the power of the Golden Dragon. Even if she couldn’t, she was much stronger than an ordinary human’s body.

“Don’t tell Qiuyan about this,” Qin Ling said through gritted teeth as she stared at Zhou Wen.

“He has the right to know.” Zhou Wen looked at Qin Ling without backing down.

The killing intent in Qin Ling’s eyes burned as she slowly raised her palm. Her nails also turned pale gold like sharp daggers.

However, in the end, Qin Ling still lowered her hand and her body gradually returned to her original human appearance.

“Leave. You can tell Qiuyan that I won’t return.” As Qin Ling spoke, she turned around and walked towards the Sea God Reef dimensional zone.

“Would you be willing to give up just like that? Why don’t you give it a try? Perhaps Feng Qiuyan doesn’t mind,” Zhou Wen said as he looked at Qin Ling’s back.

“How can he not mind? I’m not a human, but a monster. No one can accept a monster like me as their wife. He suffered a fright back when he saw my true body during his childhood. Why should I frighten him a second time?” As Qin Ling spoke, she charged into the Sea God Reef.

Zhou Wen watched as Qin Ling’s figure vanished into the fog, only to hear someone sigh nearby. “I never expected Little Yanyan’s fiancée to really be nonhuman.”

Li Xuan walked over. He had seen the message Zhou Wen had left him. He had originally come to look for Zhou Wen, but he never expected to hear their conversation.

“You are better with words. I’ll leave this matter of telling Feng Qiuyan to you,” Zhou Wen said to Li Xuan.

“I never like to say things that make people sad. It’s best you say it yourself.” Li Xuan shook his head in rejection.

“It might not be a bad thing,” Zhou Wen said as he walked in the direction of the Feng family. Some things had to be faced eventually. Furthermore, Zhou Wen felt that Feng Qiuyan was already mentally prepared.

The two of them returned to the Feng family residence and found Feng Qiuyan.

“Coach, you were the one who killed the giant crab at sea, right? Now, all of Sea Return is discussing your deeds. They want to know who you are...” Feng Qiuyan said.

“We’ll talk about this in the future. Is there a place where we can talk in private? I have something to tell you,” Zhou Wen said.

“Come with me.” Feng Qiuyan quickly took the two of them to a small building. Then, he looked at Zhou Wen and said, “Coach, tell me directly.”

“Qin Ling isn’t human. She has half the bloodline of a dimensional creature,” Zhou Wen said directly.
