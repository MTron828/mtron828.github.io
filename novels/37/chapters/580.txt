Chapter 581 Immortal Opportunity Stone

"It’s impossible for us to kill it with our present strength, but I have a way to stall it." Jiang Yan shared his thoughts.

Jiang Yan had an Epic Companion Beast known as Soundless Snake. It could block sounds from spreading within a small region. As long as they couldn’t hear Bai Ze’s voice, the power in its voice wouldn’t be effective.

Then, Jiang Yan prepared a Mythical Dark Domain Heavenly King. It was a Mythical Companion Beast from overseas. It had the ability to transform a certain area into a region of darkness and could restrain all kinds of vision-type abilities.

As long as Bai Ze was in the darkness, its eyes’ abilities would not be effective either.

Without the ability to speak and see, Bai Ze’s strength would greatly decrease. It wouldn’t even be able to see what Jiang Yan was doing.

At that moment, as long as Zhou Wen could hold back Bai Ze and attract its attention, Jiang Yan could take the opportunity to contract the Guardian in the cocoon.

"Is it impossible to use all vision-type skills in the darkness?" Zhou Wen asked.

"Probably so. I haven’t discovered any vision-type abilities that can be used in the region of darkness," Jiang Yan said.

I wonder if Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World can be used in the region of darkness? Zhou Wen thought.

Their stamina consumption was immense, exhausting the duo. They stopped talking and walked forward without a word.

Zhou Wen gave it a try and switched his Life Soul to Zero Taboo. He realized that the strange force acting on him immediately vanished without a trace, making him feel much more relaxed. He couldn’t help but be overjoyed.

Soon, Zhou Wen saw the Zero Taboo crystal emit a terrifying glow, as though it wouldn’t last long before it burned to ashes. He knew that the taboo here was no trifling matter.

He hurriedly deactivated Zero Taboo. The strange force exerted on Zhou Wen again, tormenting him with every step he took.

Although Zero Taboo is useful, it’s only in its Primordial Body form. It can only last for a very short period of time. If I can advance to a Perfect Body, I might really be able to use Zero Taboo. It might even be able to restrain all kinds of taboos in the world, Zhou Wen thought to himself as he wondered how he could raise Zero Taboo to a Perfect Body.

Currently, among Zhou Wen’s Life Soul, only the Inverse Ancient Sovereign was an Evolved Body. The rest were still in their Primordial Body forms, so it was imperative to raise their levels.

The Zero Taboo is used to restrain the taboos of various mysterious lands. Doesn’t that mean that as long as I have some understanding of those mysterious taboos, I can raise Zero Taboo? Zhou Wen didn’t know if this conjecture was right, but there was nothing wrong with trying it.

It just so happened that the taboo power of Immortal Seeking Mountain was extremely powerful. Zhou Wen had nothing else to do, so he decided to study it.

Zhou Wen switched his Essence Energy Art to Small Perfection of Wisdom. Under the effects of the Eight Perfections Wisdom Life Providence, his senses became extremely sharp, allowing him to sense the taboo powers of Immortal Seeking Mountain.

If the Eight Perfections Wisdom couldn’t resist the taboo powers, Zhou Wen only wanted to make his senses sharper to better understand the effects of the taboo power.

The taboo power of Immortal Seeking Mountain was indeed very strange. This kind of power didn’t harm others. It matched the person’s strength. It just happened to be at the peak that one could withstand. Every step one took required them to use all their strength. One couldn’t hesitate or their legs might go limp and end up falling down the mountain.

Although the path to becoming an immortal was difficult, as long as one’s willpower was firm, it wasn’t a dead end. However, this path seemed to have no end. Every step one took was extremely difficult. Even a person with a firm will would inevitably show signs of weakness over time. Therefore, very few people could reach the top of the mountain.

Zhou Wen felt the changes in the power in his body and found it strange and unpredictable.

If I take a step back, what changes will this taboo power have? Just as this thought surfaced in Zhou Wen’s mind, he immediately nipped it in the bud.

Goods of every variety are nothing compared to the value of survival. I definitely can’t take risks. Zhou Wen hurriedly steeled his resolve and continued walking forward.

When the sun was about to set, the two of them had only managed to climb around a thousand meters. When they looked up, they still couldn’t see the end to the path. The stone steps circled around the clouds like a coiling dragon. Just one look made them feel a little dizzy.

Zhou Wen was just about to take out a bottle of water to hydrate himself when he heard Jiang Yan say, "We’re reaching the Immortal Opportunity Stone ahead. You have to be careful after crossing it. If you continue walking up, there will be something that will try to entice you. You have to remember that no matter what happens, you mustn’t retreat or you will die."

Zhou Wen knew that it wasn’t easy to deal with things that Jiang Yan said with such seriousness, so he asked, "What will happen?"

"That’s hard to say. Everyone’s situation is different. You have to experience it before you know what it is," Jiang Yan answered.

Zhou Wen looked up and indeed, he saw a small platform beside the mountain path. On it was a huge boulder with the words "Immortal Opportunity."

However, there was nothing special about the stone. It was exactly the same as the ordinary mountain rocks on Immortal Seeking Mountain. It just had two additional words engraved on it.

Soon, the two of them walked past the Immortal Opportunity Stone and took a few more steps. Zhou Wen didn’t sense anything different from before.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to say something, he saw Jiang Yan suddenly turn and strike at his head. His expression was ferocious as he said coldly, "You’ve been fooled. Die!"

The mountain path was narrow to begin with—it only allowed one person to walk along. Jiang Yan’s palm emitted a resplendent divine light as though a sun had smashed down. Zhou Wen had nowhere to hide. Apart from retreating, he could only take the brunt of Jiang Yan’s palm.

Zhou Wen’s expression didn’t change as he continued moving up the stairs. At the same time, he used his arms to shield himself from Jiang Yan’s palm.

Zhou Wen still remembered that Jiang Yan had warned him not to retreat no matter what happened. Furthermore, he believed that Jiang Yan wasn’t such a person.

With Jiang Yan’s character, even if he really wanted to harm him, he would have clearly explained why he was doing so. It was impossible for him to sneak an attack like this. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Therefore, Zhou Wen continued walking forward without any intention of counterattacking. If it was just an illusion, any counterattack would strike the defenseless Jiang Yan.

Indeed, Jiang Yan’s palm passed through his arm before Jiang Yan’s body dissipated.

Zhou Wen looked up and saw Jiang Yan walking in front of him. He had never turned his head.

If Zhou Wen hadn’t thought things through and allowed his body to automatically counterattack, Jiang Yan would probably have died from his strike.

What crappy immortal opportunity is this? It’s basically luring the demon in one’s heart, Zhou Wen thought.
