Chapter 1671 Charging

Demonic Neonate had just swallowed the purple crystal when her grayish-purple irises darkened. In a moment, they turned dark-purple.

Before Zhou Wen could carefully size her up, she automatically transformed into a dark beam of light that returned to him.

Zhou Wen sensed that Demonic Neonate’s consciousness was gradually blurring. Zhou Wen had experienced this many times. It was a sign that she was about to evolve.

He reached out to pick up the white object on the ground and held it in his hand to stroke it.

Zhou Wen had definitely never seen it before, but its outer shell was almost identical to Zhou Wen’s mysterious phone. Be it the color or texture, there was no difference.

Zhou Wen took out the mysterious phone and wanted to compare them to see if the two materials were identical. To his surprise, just as the mysterious phone touched the white object, the white object’s string seemed to be like a magnet and stuck to the end of the mysterious phone.

The mysterious phone’s screen automatically lit up, revealing a battery charging animation.

This… Zhou Wen was momentarily rendered speechless in surprise as he looked in the direction of the ancient well. His expression changed as countless thoughts flashed through his mind.

Ever since he obtained the mysterious phone, he hadn’t charged it at all. The mysterious phone didn’t need to be charged either. There wasn’t even a charging port.

However, this thing was actually charging. The battery icon on the screen showed that the battery was only at 1%. Zhou Wen didn’t know whether there was a difference between having the mysterious phone charged or not. This wasn’t the problem he was most concerned about.

Zhou Wen’s father had explained the origins of the phone very clearly. It was dug out by Zhou Wen’s grandfather from an ancient well in Guide Ancient City, but Zhou Wen’s father wasn’t too sure which ancient well it came from.

From the looks of it, the object was clearly something that came with a phone. It was most likely a portable charger.

Could it be that the mysterious phone was dug out from this ancient well? Countless thoughts flashed through Zhou Wen’s mind as he looked at the charging phone. His expression became even more complicated.

He thought of a possibility. If the mysterious phone was really dug out from this ancient well, could the skeleton be his grandfather’s remains?

Zhou Wen had seen the strength of the necklace with his own eyes. With Demonic Neonate’s strength, it was difficult for her to injure it at all.

Zhou Wen could roughly guess that his strike probably couldn’t injure the necklace, but when he approached it, the necklace automatically opened.

When the skeleton dissipated, it seemed to have released its grip, allowing the portable charger to fall. He also felt his heart palpitate just as he was about to slash down.

These abnormal developments made Zhou Wen wonder if the skeleton had done it on purpose. If the skeleton was really Zhou Wen’s grandfather’s remains, all of this could be explained.

However, Zhou Wen recalled that his grandfather hadn’t gone missing, nor had he been buried. He had been cremated when he passed away. The young Zhou Wen had even participated in the funeral, so it was unlikely that he had left his remains behind.

What’s going on? Zhou Wen couldn’t figure it out no matter how hard he tried. The skeleton had already dissipated, so it was impossible to find any clues.

Looking at the charging phone, Zhou Wen had no choice but to wait. He wanted to see what changes would result after the phone was charged. Perhaps there would be clues when the time came.

Could it be more than a coincidence that the mysterious phone was dug out from the ancient city? Seeing that the phone’s battery had jumped from 1% to 2%, Zhou Wen picked up the phone and attempted to use it. He realized that he couldn’t use the phone at all as it remained on the charging screen.

“Old Zhou, what are you doing?” Li Xuan shouted as he pushed open the door and walked in.

Many things had happened in Guide Ancient City recently. Zhou Wen was the kind of boss who left everything to others. Most of the work was coordinated by Li Xuan.

“When did you arrive?” Zhou Wen asked Li Xuan.

“Not long ago. Why?” Li Xuan looked at Zhou Wen in puzzlement.

“Did you hear anything or see anything?” Zhou Wen asked again. “Are you talking about your yard? Did a spy barge in? I didn’t hear or see anything.” Li Xuan immediately sized up the yard warily, but he didn’t discover anything.

“No, didn’t you see the light rushing out of the ancient well?” Zhou Wen recounted the skeleton’s appearance, but he didn’t mention the portable charger. It wasn’t easy to explain.

“According to what you said, I should have been able to see it from afar. However, I didn’t see anything just now. Guide Ancient City is indeed a little odd. I don’t know if it’s a blessing or a curse for us to occupy this place. I hope nothing bad will happen.” Li Xuan paused before continuing, “There’s something I need to discuss with you. The Niten Flying Immortal Palace from overseas has contacted us and wants to migrate to Guide Ancient City. What do you think?”

Zhou Wen thought for a moment before recalling Sei Gasakai. After some thought, he said, “Although the Niten Flying Immortal Palace established by Sei Gasakai is an overseas faction, it hasn’t had much of a conflict with the mainland. It has always been neutral. Furthermore, in this era, be it overseas or the mainland, they are all a part of humanity. We are also in need of manpower now. If there aren’t any unresolvable grudges between us, there’s no harm in taking them in.”

“That’s what I thought too. However, there’s still some tiny trouble,” Li Xuan said with a smile.

“What trouble?” Zhou Wen asked with a frown.

“The Niten Flying Immortal Palace had already wanted to move inland some time ago. The six families and some major factions were very interested in them and had contacted them. Furthermore, they offered pretty good conditions. Those conditions even tempted me when I heard them, but for some reason, they rejected them all and took the initiative to contact us. They wanted to move to our place, but the conditions they raised were far inferior to the conditions the six families gave them.” Li Xuan paused to give Zhou Wen some time to digest.

“Are you suspecting their motives?” Zhou Wen asked.

“A little, but that’s not the most important thing. The most important thing is that the Family Clan of Gods seems to be determined to rope in the Niten Flying Immortal Palace. Not only did they actively contact them again and offer better conditions, but they also used their connections to tactfully express their wish for us to reject the Niten Flying Immortal Palace.” Li Xuan recounted the entire matter.

“Who did they find?” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“Someone from your family.” Li Xuan didn’t say it directly.

“The An family?” Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback.

“Yes, but Brother Sheng contacted me. He said that there’s no need to worry too much. If there’s a need, we can directly take in the people from the Niten Flying Immortal Palace,” Li Xuan added. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

When Zhou Wen heard that, he roughly understood that the Family Clan of Gods had definitely exerted pressure on the An family.
