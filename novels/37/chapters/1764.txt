Chapter 1765 Tomb of the Fallen Gods

“The golden fruit tree isn’t the end,” said Trajector Seeking.

“That’s strange. Since the golden fruit tree isn’t the end, why did the Cube automatically end the battle after plucking the golden apple?” Zhou Wen asked. Aww

“What do you think that place is? It’s not some trash dimensional zone in Earth’s universe, but a dimensional zone in the dimension.” Trajectory Seeking continued disdainfully, “There’s no teleportation nexus in the Lake of Oblivion. The only way to leave is to pluck the golden fruit. Only ignorant humans like you think that the fellows on the rankings are the only ones in the dimension? In fact, those fellows are just inferior fellows in the dimension. There are too many experts who can pluck the golden fruits. The reason there are still golden fruits left is that they are reserved for the Lake of Oblivion’s exploration. However, they have all been plucked by ignorant humans like you. Now, unless you can really clear the level, you won’t be able to leave the Lake of Oblivion.”

“It sounds like the dimension doesn’t know much about the Lake of Oblivion. What you said is something the dimension had just learned about, right?” Zhou Wen said indifferently.

Trajectory Seeking didn’t deny it as she curled her lips and said, “Even in the dimension, the Lake of Oblivion is a famous existence. Many people know about it, but not many people dare explore it.”

“Why?” Zhou Wen asked curiously.

“Because that’s the Tomb of the Fallen Gods,” said Trajectory Seeking. “I never expected the dimension to have gods,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

The creatures in the dimension were no different from gods and devils to humans. Furthermore, among the many races in the dimension, there were ghosts and immortals.

Zhou Wen was somewhat surprised that there was the concept of a god in a place like theirs.

“Humph, the gods of the dimension are completely different from the gods of you humans. To you humans, gods are just a form of spiritual faith that doesn’t really exist. And in the dimension, gods are only a race, not something imaginary like what you humans imagine.” Ever since Trajectory Seeking had become his disciple, she felt uncomfortable beside Zhou Wen. Her words were even more biting than before.

“Then the Tomb of the Fallen Gods is where the Gods bury their clansmen? In that case, the Gods must know the place very well. Why don’t they challenge themselves?” Zhou Wen asked the question in his mind.

“If the Gods hadn’t completely gone extinct, why would that place be called the Tomb of the Fallen Gods?” Trajectory Seeking roughly explained the situation.

The Gods were originally a very powerful race in the dimension, an existence that was comparable to the Immortals. When the Immortals and Gods fought for supremacy in the dimension, they were almost evenly matched for a long period of time.

However, one day, the birthplace of the Gods was suddenly destroyed. The Gods became extinct as a result. Almost no God survived.

There was no accurate explanation for how the Gods were destroyed.

The most accepted explanation was that they had been exterminated by the Immortals, but the Immortals had never admitted to this matter, so no one could be sure of the actual situation.

Many races in the dimension knew that it was an extremely majestic divine mountain in the past. The divine mountain was almost comparable to a world. It could accommodate all life, and there were countless magical objects inside.

However, the divine mountain vanished overnight. The spot where the divine mountain was originally located turned into an unfathomable lake. Later on, many experts from the various races entered, hoping to figure out the secret of the Gods’ overnight destruction, but they never returned-none returned.

The Land of Oblivion referred to the place where the divine mountain sank. It also had the meaning of obliviating all things. No creature dared to enter.

If not for the Cube activating the battle in the Land of Oblivion, the dimensional powerhouses probably wouldn’t have dared enter.

The dimension didn’t know much more about the Land of Oblivion than humanity. After their previous analysis, they realized that the golden fruit was only an item used to leave the Land of Oblivion, not the true key. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Even Apocalypse-grade powerhouses weren’t willing to risk entering the Land of Oblivion. Otherwise, how could humans pluck the golden fruits?

“Now that you know the true secret of the Land of Oblivion, do you still dare challenge it?” Trajectory Seeking goaded Zhou Wen.

“Now that you mention it, I really don’t dare,” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

“Humph.” Trajectory Seeking was somewhat exasperated, but she knew that it was indeed difficult for Zhou Wen to clear the level now.

Even the Apocalypse-grade big shots in the dimension didn’t dare take the risk. As long as there was nothing wrong with Zhou Wen’s brain, he definitely wouldn’t choose to take the risk now.

“Do you dare?” Zhou Wen asked.

“So what if I don’t dare? I’m not a teacher,” Trajectory Seeking said angrily.

“Great. As your teacher, I’ll teach you something today,” Zhou Wen said.

“You want to challenge the Land of Oblivion now?” Trajectory Seeking widened her eyes as she looked at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at a fool.

“That’s right. As your teacher, I naturally have to teach you something you don’t know. Otherwise, how can I be your teacher?” Zhou Wen said with a smile.

He naturally didn’t really want to teach Trajectory Seeking, nor would he risk his life for this. The reason he chose to challenge the level now was that he had seen something in the Land of Oblivion.

Previously, Zhou Wen hadn’t paid much attention to the Land of Oblivion, but this time, when Ming Xiu and company attempted the level, Zhou Wen watched very seriously, especially when Ming Xiu attempted the level because Zhou Wen was somewhat worried.

Although he had already taught Ming Xiu and company how to pluck the golden apples, he would have still been worried despite having 100% confidence.

Therefore, Zhou Wen watched very seriously. This was also why he saw something that he originally believed couldn’t exist in the dimension.

It was a tiny palm symbol on the golden fruit tree. It was the symbol of a downloadable dungeon for the phone. It was quite surprising that the dimension had a tiny palm symbol.

The origins of the phone were even more mysterious than Zhou Wen imagined. Even the dimension had a mark, so what kind of existence was the person who created the phone? Zhou Wen found it unimaginable.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to take a picture of the tiny palm symbol after Qin Zhen cleared the level, but Zhong Ziya and Liu Yun beat him to it.

However, it didn’t matter. As long as he downloaded the tiny palm symbol and attempted the level in-game, he could still come out unscathed with the experience.

Of course, there was another more important reason for Zhou Wen’s confidence. He realized that the Sigh of the King was stronger than he had imagined. This gave him the confidence and guarantee.

“I don’t know if you are ignorant or fearless. If you wish to die, I won’t stop you. Don’t blame me if you die. I didn’t force you to go.” From Trajectory Seeking’s point of view, if Zhou Wen really went, it would be no different from tempting fate.
