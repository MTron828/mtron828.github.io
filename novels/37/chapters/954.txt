Chapter 955: Torch Dragon’s Ferocious Might

Translator: CKtalon

Sky Slash could tear through space and had astonishing destructive power.

Just as the Sky Slash was about to hit the Guardian, the Guardian’s body automatically split open like the disassembly of mechanical components.

Sky Slash slashed past its body, but it failed to injure it.

The Light Concealment Sword in Zhou Wen’s hand crisscrossed like lightning, but the Guardian’s body kept disassembling into components. Wherever the Sky Slash slashed, it would disassemble into smaller pieces to dodge the Sky Slash’s power.

Furthermore, every part of its body seemed to possess intelligence. When it fought Zhou Wen, its fingers were still tapping down on the chessboard.

Every time it tapped his finger, a new piece would appear on the chessboard.

However, the position where the chess piece landed wasn’t where Zhou Wen was, but where Li Xuan and company were.

Without Zhou Wen’s ability to spy on the chessboard, they had no idea when a chess piece would land on them. They had relied on their intuition and experience to dodge a few times, but they were already in peril.

Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth, Explosive Fiend Man, Torch Dragon, and other Companion Beasts to attack the Guardian.

This move worked as expected. Under the siege of Zhou Wen’s Mythical Companion Beast line up, the Guardian, who seemed to be able to infinitely disassemble, couldn’t withstand the pressure. A portion of the disassembled parts were shattered by Tyrant Behemoth’s punch.

However, the shattered components actually reassembled like nanomachines. This terrifying Guardian actually managed to withstand the attack of the Mythical line up.

With the chess piece, Cannon, landing, Feng Qiuyan and Li Xuan had no time to dodge. Li Xuan pounced forward and held Ya’er and Feng Qiuyan in front of him. He supported himself with both hands as an evil aura on his body flickered. The power of the carapace Life Soul was pushed to its limits.

Boom!

Under the terrifying strike, the carapace on Li Xuan’s back shattered. The fragments stabbed into his body, piercing through his flesh and bones. Instantly, Li Xuan was covered in blood.

Blood dripped down as Li Xuan continued supporting himself with both hands. A deep crater appeared in the surrounding rocks. Ya’er and Feng Qiuyan were protected by him. Ya’er wasn’t injured, while Feng Qiuyan was only slightly injured.

“President!” Feng Qiuyan couldn’t help but be alarmed when he saw Li Xuan’s spine exposed from the strike. Furthermore, many parts of his body had torn open.

“Don’t move,” Li Xuan shouted coldly, stopping Feng Qiuyan from crawling out. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The injuries on his body healed at an extremely fast speed and the carapace automatically healed.

Boom!

At that moment, there was another loud stomp. A terrifying force that resembled the hoof of a pegasus stepped on Li Xuan’s back. Immediately, blood spewed out of his mouth. Li Xuan, who had yet to fully recover, suffered serious injuries once again. His armor shattered and his bones were almost crushed.

But even so, Li Xuan didn’t die. His injuries and shattered carapace rapidly healed once more.

Zhou Wen knew that Li Xuan couldn’t last long, but he had yet to find a way to kill the Guardian. All he could do was get Tyrant Behemoth to rush over to provide support.

The Guardian struck Li Xuan again and again, but Li Xuan managed to survive. Even so, the situation was only worsening.

Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth finally rushed over and protected the three of them under its body, blocking the terrifying bombardment.

Tyrant Behemoth, who had activated Absolute Strength, spat out a mouthful of blood after suffering the strike. It was immediately severely injured, and its bones fractured.

Zhou Wen knew that it wasn’t because the Guardian was powerful, but because it had borrowed the power of Mt. Chinese Chess’s dimensional zone. Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t only resisting the Guardian’s power, but also the rules of Mt. Chinese Chess. This was a truly terrifying power. No matter how strong a Companion Beast was, it was difficult for it to withstand the power of an entire dimensional zone.

Previously, Li Xuan had been able to resist the rules thanks to his Life Providence. The rules of Mt. Chinese Chess implied destruction when struck by a chess piece, but his Life Providence was indestructible. Furthermore, Li Xuan’s Life Soul was extremely strange, allowing him to withstand the strikes of the chess pieces.

If it were anyone else, they might not have been able to withstand it even with a Mythical body.

Zhou Wen was also attacking the Guardian with all his might, but the Guardian was as tenacious as Li Xuan. No matter how many times its body components were destroyed, they could still be combined to form new parts even if they were shattered.

Its entire body seemed to be made of nanomachines. Unless one could directly vaporize it or make it disappear into nothingness, it was very difficult to kill it.

“Die!” Zhou Wen knew that they couldn’t hold on any longer. He ordered Torch Dragon Youngling to use Bright Torch Vision World.

The power of the Bright Torch Vision World immediately sucked in the Guardian’s body, but the body sucked in seemed to be only a part of its body.

Soon, another nanomachine appeared out of nowhere and began reconstructing the Guardian’s body.

“Chess Soul, think of a way to escape.” Zhou Wen roared at the black-robed Chess Soul before putting away all the Companion Beasts other than Torch Dragon. He also wore the Jade Crystal Essence Armor.

In the next second, Torch Dragon’s body emitted a bright glow as rows of Torch Dragon Eyes opened. Like an ancient ferocious god, it simultaneously activated Bright Torch Vision World.

The black-robed Chess Soul turned pale with fright when it saw this. Its figure flashed and vanished.

The Guardian’s disintegrated body was rapidly sucked away by the Bright Torch Vision World. Even the Mt. Chinese Chess below suffered a terrifying energy strike as it vanished piece by piece.

The Guardian seemed to realize that it was about to die. Unable to withstand Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World in its World King Transformation state, the Guardian suddenly made a strange move. Its remaining components rushed towards the spot where the Guardian cocoon was.

However, very quickly, under the omnipresent Bright Torch Vision World, the Guardian’s body was sucked in. Even half of Mt. Chinese Chess vanished.

The power of the chess game finally vanished. Apart from the dimensional zone’s nomological powers, the other powers vanished.

Torch Dragon Youngling landed weakly and was almost unable to raise its head. Using the World King Transformation and Bright Torch Vision World at full strength expended too much of its strength. Thankfully, it had only lasted for a blink of an eye. If it had lasted any longer, Torch Dragon Youngling would have died first.

The black-robed Chess Soul crawled out from beneath Mt. Chinese Chess and looked at the mountaintop that had vanished.

“Li Xuan, are you alright?” Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to bother with the black-robed Chess Soul as he quickly arrived in front of Li Xuan and company.

Tyrant Behemoth was covered in injuries and looked severely injured. It had only suffered two strikes, but Li Xuan had suffered at least five strikes.

“I’m fine.” Li Xuan crawled out from below as his body and carapace healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.
