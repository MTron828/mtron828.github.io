After returning to Chiang Rai, he didn’t see Li Xuan and Worm Dugu. Presumably, the two of them had yet to return from the Ice Silkworm Gu King’s place.

Gu Shanshui wanted to think of a way to get a container to rear the Corpse Bug. Therefore, he returned to Mong Hsat overnight.

Zhou Wen didn’t follow Gu Shanshui to Mong Hsat. He decided to get the calabash back at Mong Hsat in a few days.

He chose to stay because he wanted to visit the Xiao family and figure out the matter between Xiao Si and Wang Chan.

Li Mobai also planned on staying in Chiang Rai for a few more days before heading off with Zhou Wen to Mong Hsat.

That night, Zhou Wen used the Invisibility Cloak and headed for the Xiao family. He planned on infiltrating the family to see if he could find out anything.

The Xiao family lived in an exotic manor. Before he arrived, Zhou Wen realized a problem. There were many Gu lurking in the grass on both sides of the road. If it wasn’t for Zhou Wen’s Supreme Hell King Life Soul and Truth Listener’s ability, heightening Zhou Wen’s senses, it would be difficult for ordinary people to discover the Gu.

The Xiao family sure is careful. They even planted Gu outside the manor. Zhou Wen didn’t know much about Gu, so he didn’t know which Gu relied on smell to distinguish the enemy or sound. Therefore, he flew into the manor from the sky to avoid alerting the Gu.

However, after entering the manor, Zhou Wen realized that although the manor’s layout was very dense, this was only the periphery of the Xiao family. Behind the manor was a valley which was a dimensional zone. The Xiao family’s true headquarters was built in a dimensional zone.

Using Truth Listener’s ability to constantly scan the area, he found the various hidden mechanisms and traps of the Xiao family.

With the Xiao family’s guards guarding the entrance to the dimensional zone, that was secondary. It was impossible for four Legendary humans to see through Zhou Wen’s invisibility.

What caught Zhou Wen’s attention was that there was a statue at the entrance of the dimensional zone. The statue looked very odd. It was a Buddha statue, but it was different from the Buddha statue Zhou Wen had seen in Dragon Gate Grotto. Not only did it look ferocious and terrifying, but it also had a vertical eye at its glabella and a strange fork in its hand.

Zhou Wen had never seen such a Buddha statue before, but the statue’s carvings were similar to the ones used in Buddhism. A Buddhistic glow was engraved on its back.

Zhou Wen could vaguely sense an aura similar to a Gu Mantong from the Buddha statue.

The Spirit Body’s vision is somewhat different from humans. It’s not just about the form. It’s probably impossible to fool that Buddha statue with ordinary invisibility. Zhou Wen decided to activate the Wheel of Destiny of the Invisibility Cloak and completely conceal his body before entering the dimensional zone.

As expected, the guards and Buddha statues didn’t notice him and Zhou Wen successfully entered the valley. The moment he entered, he found it difficult to breathe as though there was no oxygen in the valley.

Zhou Wen didn’t discover any Gu and immediately knew that it was the taboo power of this dimensional zone. He had to switch to the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder and immediately, the suffocating feeling vanished.

Although he didn’t have the keen senses of the Supreme Hell King, it didn’t make a difference with Truth Listener around. Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan the entire valley before quickly moving in.

As the Invisibility Cloak’s Wheel of Destiny only had three minutes, he had to figure out the situation in the dimensional zone in those three minutes.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that such a valley would have all sorts of Gu, but in fact, there weren’t any. There was only one temple in the valley, but the style was very different from the one in Luoyang. It was obvious that it was the local style of Chiang Rai.

There was no one outside the temple, but there were many people inside. They were likely members of the Xiao family. Some were practicing their techniques, while others were directing Gu. It was rather lively.

When Zhou Wen entered the temple’s yard, he felt that there was no reaction from the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder. He knew that there was no taboo power here.

As they trusted the guards outside the manor and the taboo power in the valley, the temple’s internal defenses weren’t as strict. Zhou Wen looked inside and realized that the deities in the temple hall weren’t the Buddhist eminences he was familiar with. Instead, they were dolls of all shapes and sizes.

Are all the ones consecrated here Kuman Thong and Kuman Nee? Zhou Wen scanned the area and saw many dolls in the shapes of boys and girls. He roughly knew what they were.

Zhou Wen wasn’t interested in them and he rushed straight to the backyard. He didn’t have much time left. Although he wasn’t afraid of being exposed, it would be impossible for him to eavesdrop if he was.

The temple was rather large and there were quite a number of courtyards inside. Each courtyard had different Kuman Thong, making it look sinister and terrifying.

Zhou Wen had always felt that these religious buildings weren’t aesthetically pleasing. Regardless of the religion, they gave him an uneasy feeling.

Along the way, he encountered quite a number of people from the Xiao family, but they didn’t say anything that piqued Zhou Wen’s interest. Seeing that the three minutes were up, Zhou Wen realized that there wasn’t anyone in the nearby yard, so he decided to enter the yard first.

After entering the yard, the three minutes of invisibility ended. Zhou Wen wore the Invisibility Cloak and could only achieve the effects of visual invisibility. His body didn’t vanish completely.

Thankfully, there weren’t many people here. The yard wasn’t big, and there was only a temple hall inside. The door was open, and strangely, there was a black cloth hanging in front of the door.

Zhou Wen used Truth Listener to scan the interior and realized that the tiny temple hall was eerie and terrifying. The decorations inside were very simple. There was a wooden table with a Kuman Thong on it.

The Kuman Thong was jade-like and curled into a ball. There was a crystal container outside, and the yellow liquid inside wrapped around the Kuman Thong. Zhou Wen now had a vague idea that it was Corpse Oil.

Seeing that there was nothing inside, Zhou Wen didn’t enter. Just as he was about to continue searching the temple, he suddenly saw a girl standing in front of him.

The girl didn’t look too old. She was at most eighteen or nineteen years old. She wore strange clothes and looked rather delicate, but for some reason, she had a sinister look as she stared coldly at Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen felt his hair stand on end when the girl stared at him.

She can see me? Zhou Wen was thinking of how to deal with such a situation.

The other party was only a girl whom he had no grudges with. Zhou Wen couldn’t bring himself to draw his saber to kill her.

However, the girl was strange. She only stared coldly at Zhou Wen without shouting or screaming.

Could it be that she didn’t see me? Zhou Wen was suspicious as he attempted to take two steps to the left.

The girl’s pupils moved to the left as he moved. Zhou Wen took a few steps to the right and the girl’s pupils shifted to the right again. She kept staring at him, clearly able to see the invisible Zhou Wen.
