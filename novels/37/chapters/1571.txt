Chapter 1572: A Secret

What surprised Xia Xuanyue even more was that the famous Female Sword Immortal, Qin Zhen, was also here.

Qin Zhen’s fame wasn’t as great as Ming Xiu and Feng Qiuyan’s, but there was a reason why Xia Xuanyue knew her.

Qin Zhen came from an average family, but in the past few years of studying at Sunset College, she had displayed extremely powerful talent in the way of the sword.

The various factions thought highly of a genius without any background like Qin Zhen. Who didn’t want to have a few talented sword masters like Qin Zhen under their wing? Even if they funded her with her doing nothing, it was better than having such a strong person serve their enemies.

When Qin Zhen was in her sophomore year, many families had already contacted her. It wasn’t just the typical wealthy family. Even the six families had contacted her—both openly and secretly—and had made some offers.

The Xia family had also invited Qin Zhen. The conditions offered were rather high, but Qin Zhen still rejected them.

Later, Xia Xuanyue learned that the conditions offered by the other families were pretty good. The Family Clan of Gods had even prepared a Guardian and Mythical Serum for her. They were all attributes that best suited her. They also earmarked a large number of resources for her usage.

However, Qin Zhen didn’t go anywhere. She rejected everyone’s invitation and stayed at Sunset College as a tutor.

People originally believed that Qin Zhen had stayed in Sunset College because of An Tianzuo. Many young geniuses had chosen to join Luoyang or directly join the Sunset Army because of the name ‘An Tianzuo.’

Only two days ago, when Xia Xuanyue chanced upon Qin Zhen lecturing students on the school field, did she realize that she was in Guide City.

The conditions here were worlds apart from what the six families had to offer. She really couldn’t figure out why Qin Zhen had chosen to stay here.

Could it be that Qin Zhen thinks so highly of Zhou Wen??Xia Xuanyue thought to herself.

As large families, they definitely couldn’t place all their eggs in one basket. Even if one basket had a problem, there were still eggs in the other basket that could be eaten.

However, Qin Zhen was different. She was only one egg—herself—so it was equivalent to her betting everything on Guide City and Zhou Wen.

What surprised Xia Xuanyue even more was that she saw Hui Wan when she was shopping yesterday.

President Hui Haifeng only had one son. He took care of him like he was a treasure. The present situation in Guide City wasn’t optimistic, but Hui Haifeng didn’t mind leaving his only son here. It left Xia Xuanyue somewhat surprised.

Could this Hui Wan not be Hui Haifeng’s biological son??Xia Xuanyue was very suspicious.

The situation in Guide City was completely different from what Xia Xuanyue had imagined. She was already somewhat in a dilemma, unsure if the conditions she and Xia Liuchuan had come up with could move Zhou Wen.

If this place was only a piece of charcoal, the conditions they offered were rather good. However, from the looks of it, Zhou Wen didn’t seem to need any. It wouldn’t be that easy to convince him.

Xia Xuanyue called and told Xia Liuchuan what had happened. After Xia Liuchuan heard that, his face was filled with disbelief.

“The Ming Xiu you’re talking about is Swordsman Tomorrow Ming Xiu? And the Feng Qiuyan is the one from the Sea Return family?” Xia Liuchuan asked in disbelief.

“Yes, I heard that they were classmates with Zhou Wen.” Xia Xuanyue recounted what she had heard.

“Not only do Feng Qiuyan and Ming Xiu represent themselves, but they also represent their families. Although these two families can’t be considered top-notch, they have become famous among the various warlords after the appearance of these two,” Xia Liuchuan said after some thought.

Together with Qin Zhen and some others, Guide City’s strength far exceeded their expectations.

“From the looks of it, we have to change our previous plans. The chips in the past could be considered a timely help to the former Zhou Wen, but things aren’t the same now. We are a step too late. We need to raise our chips,” Xia Liuchuan said with a sigh.

…

When Zhou Wen arrived at the hotel, Xia Xuanyue had just returned. The two of them met in the hotel lobby.

“Miss Xia, can you get used to this place?” Zhou Wen walked over and asked.

“It’s not bad; it’s quite quiet.” Xia Xuanyue smiled and said, “If you have the time, let’s find a place to chat?”

“There’s a meeting room upstairs,” Zhou Wen said. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“There’s no need to be so formal. My brother is in charge of the family’s matters. I’m only a messenger. It’s almost meal time. I heard that there’s a shop nearby that makes roasted meat using a secret recipe that’s pretty good. I was just thinking about trying it someday. Shall we try it together?” Xia Xuanyue said.

“Alright.” Zhou Wen nodded in agreement and followed Xia Xuanyue to the barbecue shop.

After the two of them ordered their food and sat down, Xia Xuanyue said, “Guide City is a nice place, but it’s not easy to gain a foothold here.”

“It’s indeed not easy.” Zhou Wen nodded.

“Have you ever thought of cooperating with anyone?” Xia Xuanyue asked.

“Not at the moment. However, if the Xia family wishes to invest in Guide City, we can consider it.” Zhou Wen looked at Xia Xuanyue and said, “I wonder how much the Xia family plans on investing?”

Xia Xuanyue raised a finger without saying a word.

“What does one mean?” Zhou Wen was puzzled.

“One secret for 30% of Guide City’s future profits,” Xia Xuanyue said.

“What kind of secret is so valuable?” Zhou Wen curled his lips. He didn’t believe that there was any secret that was worth 30% of Guide City’s profits.

“You haven’t found a dimensional zone to build a city yet, right?” Xia Xuanyue asked without answering.

“No.” Zhou Wen looked at Xia Xuanyue in surprise. Her question was definitely not without reason.

“I know of a dimensional zone nearby. It’s easy to defend and difficult to attack. Not only is it difficult for outsiders to enter, but the environment inside is also very suitable for building a city. It’s not a lot to exchange such a dimensional zone for 30% of your income, right?” Xia Xuanyue said.

“Since it’s a nearby dimensional zone, I’ll be able to find it sooner or later. Why should I give you 30%?” Zhou Wen asked.

“If it was that easy to find it, I wouldn’t be telling you about it. If you don’t believe me, you can search for it. Forget anything I said if you can find it.” Xia Xuanyue seemed very certain that Zhou Wen wouldn’t find it.

“Alright, I’ll search for it first. We’ll talk when I can’t find it.” Zhou Wen was very direct.

“Take your time. I won’t raise prices even if you can’t find it.” Xia Xuanyue smiled.

“If I find it, I’ll definitely leave the best spot for your Xia family in the most prosperous place when I build the city in the future,” Zhou Wen added.

“Then it’s a deal.” Xia Xuanyue didn’t believe that Zhou Wen could find the dimensional zone. If it was that easy to find it, it wouldn’t have been hidden until today.

The reason the Xia family could find the dimensional zone was that it had something to do with the Xia family..
