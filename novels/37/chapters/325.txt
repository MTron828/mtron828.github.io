Chapter 326 Baby

A cute, chubby baby jumped out of the white smoke.

The baby’s fair and tender body was wearing a red piece of cloth that only covered his chest and belly, and there was a braid sticking upwards on his head.

“Who abandoned this child here?” Li Xuan couldn’t help but mutter when he saw how adorable the child was. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

However, when he thought about it carefully, he felt that something was amiss. The child was only the size of a baby; yet, he could actually walk on his own. Furthermore, he was extremely agile. No baby was this amazing.

The baby stared at them with his big eyes, seemingly furious. He seemed to be warning them not to come any closer.

“Could this be...” Wang Lu’s expression changed slightly when she saw the baby.

“Wang Lu, do you know what this baby is?” Li Xuan hurriedly asked.

“I once entered a dimensional zone in Changbai Mountain to hunt dimensional creatures with my family’s elders. There, I saw a plant-type ginseng baby that resembled a human baby. He wore such clothes and he had a few ginseng leaves growing on his head. He does resemble this baby, but there are some differences,” Wang Lu said as she sized up the baby.

“Ginseng Baby? Isn’t that the ginseng spirit spoken in legends that is extremely nourishing?” Li Xuan’s eyes glowed as he stared at the baby.

The baby seemed to sense the evil intentions in Li Xuan’s eyes as he glared at Li Xuan and with a turn of its body, he vanished.

“Oh no, retreat quickly.” Wang Lu’s expression changed slightly as she immediately retreated.

Although Zhou Wen and Li Xuan didn’t know what was happening, seeing Wang Lu’s seriousness they also retreated.

However, just as Li Xuan moved, he suddenly felt as though something had tripped him and he fell down with a plop.

The baby appeared not too far away and clapped in glee as he looked at Li Xuan. He looked extremely happy.

“Little imp, do you think I’m powerless against you? I don’t care if you are a Ginseng Baby or something else. I’ll teach you a good lesson.” Li Xuan crawled to his feet and summoned the Thundergod Sword before cleaving at the baby.

The Thundergod Sword reached the baby in an instant, but he suddenly vanished. The lightning sword beam blasted a huge hole in the ground, but it failed to hit the baby.

Plop!

Li Xuan felt his legs being tripped by something again and fell to the ground with a thud once more. When he turned his head, he saw the baby extend half his body from the ground and jump out. He clapped his hands and grinned at Li Xuan, his face filled with mockery.

Li Xuan had never experienced this before. He lunged forward to grab the baby, but no matter how fast he was, he couldn’t catch him. Instead, he kept tripping thanks to the baby. He was in a sorry state.

“Wang Lu, is this really a Ginseng Baby?” Zhou Wen asked as he sized up the baby in surprise.

“I don’t know, but he does resemble a Ginseng Baby. He’s proficient in escaping through the earth and can travel for thousands of miles underground. Even top Epic experts would find him difficult to catch if he escaped.”

Wang Lu paused for a moment before continuing, “Back then, my grandfather used a puppet Companion Beast to lure the playful Ginseng Baby over. Then, he used his Intrinsic Lock to catch him by surprise and lock him up before successfully capturing him.”

“We don’t have those things. Is there any way to catch him?” Zhou Wen knew that Ghost Steps would be useless catching up to him, after seeing the baby’s ability to escape through the earth.

“Perhaps, but I don’t know.” Wang Lu shook her head helplessly. “Ginseng Babies have the nickname of Little Earth Immortal. As long as he’s on the ground, I’m afraid no one will be able to catch him. This baby might be a Ginseng Baby, but from his ability to escape through the earth, he’s in no way inferior to the one I’ve seen before.”

When the two spoke, Li Xuan had already been teased into a rage, but he couldn’t touch the baby no matter what. He was like a clumsy bear as he was led by the nose by the baby.

Li Xuan slashed with the Thundergod Sword in his hand and even summoned several Companion Beasts. Even the Spirit Drawing Demoness that he had just obtained was summoned. Yet, he still couldn’t do anything about the baby.

The little child suddenly phased into existence like a tiny sprite that could continuously teleport. He was toying with Li Xuan and his Companion Beasts.

“Old Zhou, Wang Lu, aren’t you going to provide some help? Quickly grab this little fellow. I have to spank him.” Li Xuan had been tripped several times again, making his face turn livid with anger.

Zhou Wen felt that the baby’s escape technique was very interesting. Furthermore, he didn’t seem to have the intention to harm others. All he did was tease Li Xuan.

With a thought, Zhou Wen activated Ghost Steps as his figure seemed to teleport. He appeared behind the baby and reached out to grab the baby’s arm, but the baby vanished instantly.

Wang Lu guessed the location of the baby. She flashed over to grab him, but she failed.

The trio used all sorts of methods to grab hold of the baby but they ended up in circles. In the end, they fell to the ground, exhausted. They no longer had the strength to grab hold of the baby who kept clapping nearby as he mocked them.

Li Xuan couldn’t take it any further and chased after him once more. However, Zhou Wen and Wang Lu were truly exhausted and they sat on the ground without getting up.

“What’s the level of that Ginseng Baby you encountered? Is his ability to escape through the earth that powerful?” Zhou Wen asked Wang Lu.

“I don’t know what level he is.” Wang Lu shook her head and said, “Just as my grandfather captured the Ginseng Baby, a terrifying creature in Changbai Mountain suddenly appeared. It almost killed us. The Ginseng Baby was taken away by the creature. I never expected the map given by Earth Lord would be something like this. Even if we find it, we don’t have the ability to take him away.”

Zhou Wen looked at the baby with a frown and didn’t say a word. He really didn’t have the ability to grab him unless he could make the baby’s body leave the ground, preventing him from burrowing through the earth.

Zhou Wen secretly held the banana fan in his hand and waited for an opportunity.

Li Xuan pounced here and there, but he didn’t even touch the baby’s clothes. Instead, he slashed out craters on the ground.

After Li Xuan fell again, the baby clapped his tiny hands in delight as his chubby calves jumped up. He looked excited.

Right now. At the instant the baby’s feet left the ground, the banana fan Zhou Wen was holding stirred up a gust of cold wind, sending the baby flying

“Haha, let’s see where you can flee to now.” Li Xuan was overjoyed as he pounced forward, hoping to grab the flying baby in midair.
