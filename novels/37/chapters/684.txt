Chapter 685: Buddha Annihilation

A strange glint flashed in Zhou Wen’s eyes as he was about to activate Torch Dragon Youngling’s eye mirror. He wanted to use Bright Torch Vision World to kill the ferocious golden-winged bird.

To his surprise, he suddenly heard a loud boom. It came from the Buddha’s glabella.

The golden-winged bird seemed to be jolted awake as it stopped pursuing Zhou Wen. It looked up at the Buddha.

Zhou Wen also looked over and saw that Leng Zongzheng had already arrived in front of the cocoon of the Guardian. He held a saber in his hand as he stabbed it at the cocoon.

However, in the cocoon of the Guardian, a hand broke out and grabbed the tip of Leng Zongzheng’s saber.

The hand suffused a Buddhistic glow. It was fair and clean, and it didn’t look powerful. However, the sharp blade failed to injure the hand at all.

Could the sound just now be from the palm tearing out of the cocoon? Just as Zhou Wen was feeling alarmed, he heard a crack.

The hand snapped the saber in Leng Zongzheng’s hand.

Leng Zongzheng retreated and stared at the cocoon of the Guardian with a solemn expression. He muttered to himself, “It’s still too late. Has it already developed to such a stage?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Apart from Tyrant Behemoth, who was still chasing the monk-robed skeleton and hammering down, everyone stopped and looked at the cocoon of the Guardian.

Crack! Crack!

The Guardian’s cocoon constantly shattered as crystalline fragments fell off, emitting a clean Buddhistic glow from the cocoon.

The Buddha statues in the Buddhist kingdom seemed to come to life at that moment. Golden Buddha statues, be it sculptures or carvings on the walls, emitted the sound of chanting.

In the entire Buddhist kingdom, the mysterious murmurs reverberated like a chant. It was as though they were praying or welcoming something.

Amidst the murmurs, a golden Buddhistic glow rose from all the Buddha statues. The Buddhistic glow gathered at the Buddha’s glabella and flowed into the cracked cocoon.

Crack! Crack!

Most of the cocoon formed by the crystal threads had shattered. Zhou Wen and company could already see the creature inside the cocoon.

It was bhikkhu, who was dressed in white monk robes. He looked no different from a human, but there was an Urna on his forehead. It was crystalline-like jade and had spiral patterns.

He sat cross-legged in the cocoon as an infinite Buddhistic glow converged in front of him. They transformed into Buddha beads that automatically joined together, turning into a string of golden Buddha beads.

As the Buddhistic glow intensified, Buddha’s figure appeared on the Buddha beads.

When the cocoon of the Guardian completely shattered, the string of Buddha beads finally condensed and landed in the bhikkhu’s hand.

With the Buddha beads in hand, the entire Buddhist kingdom fell silent. The chanting sounds vanished as the Buddhistic glow on the Buddha statue vanished.

“Buddha is annihilated with my birth...” The bhikkhu slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were so clear that it made people feel as though looking at him was desecrating him.

However, with the bhikkhu’s voice, all the Buddha statues in the Buddhist Kingdom shattered. Even the thousand-foot-tall giant Buddha statue collapsed.

The Buddha statue crumbled as it slowly sank into the void.

The monk-robed skeleton and the golden-winged bird trembled as they took on a pleading pose to the bhikkhu who held Buddha beads in his hands and pressed down with his other hand.

A huge palm print appeared above the Buddha kingdom. Tyrant Behemoth, who continued attacking the skeleton, was slammed into the ground.

Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly unsummoned Tyrant Behemoth. Thankfully, Tyrant Behemoth wasn’t killed. It was only slightly injured.

However, despite being in its Absolute Strength state, it had been forcefully suppressed and had even suffered some injuries. The bhikkhu’s strength was unimaginable.

“Chancellor, do we retreat?” An Sheng asked in horror as he rapidly moved through the collapsing Buddha kingdom.

“There’s nowhere to retreat to. I’ll deal with him. The two of you will do as you see fit,” Leng Zongzheng answered without looking back. Then, he looked at bhikkhu and asked, “What’s your name?”

“Buddha Annihilation.”

Leng Zongzheng didn’t say a word. However, divine beams rose from his body one after another. The divine beams condensed in front of him, turning into a beautiful black-clothed goddess with a harp in her arms.

Guardian? Does Chancellor Leng actually have a Guardian? Zhou Wen saw the black-clothed goddess holding a harp in front of Leng Zongzheng and immediately recognized her identity. She was actually a Guardian.

“Name?” The bhikkhu asked as he looked at the harp-holding goddess.

“Divine Harp.” When the goddess answered, her body had already transformed into streams of light that fused into Leng Zongzheng’s body. At the same time, a black suit formed over him.

Leng Zongzheng’s aura also underwent an earth-shattering change due to the fusion of the Divine Harp. He was like a devil in a suit.

Leng Zongzheng sat in midair as the Demonic Organ Throne appeared in front of him. The vertical tubes that resembled a castle and the rows of keys emitted a solemn and mysterious aura.

It was different from the Demonic Organ Throne that Zhou Wen had seen the last time. This time, because Leng Zongzheng had broken through to the divine level with the help of Divine Harp, he became even more terrifying. Every note emitted a terrifying glow.

Leng Zongzheng pressed his hands on the keys as harp music came from the huge vertical tubes that resembled a castle.

Zhou Wen didn’t think that the harp tones were anything special, but the Buddha beads in Buddha Annihilation’s hand glowed brightly as though it was resisting some kind of power.

Zhou Wen didn’t have the time to figure out what was so special about the harp music. This was because the golden-winged bird had already charged at Leng Zongzheng, as though it was helping Buddha Annihilation.

Zhou Wen immediately released two Golden Battle God Halberds and attacked the golden-winged bird from the side. The Golden Overlord Sword in his hand slashed over.

The bald parrot stood on Zhou Wen’s shoulder and shouted at the golden-winged bird, “Little eagle brat... Your daddy is here...”

The monk-robed skeleton also wanted to charge at Leng Zongzheng. An Sheng rushed over and stopped him, but An Sheng only had one Mythical creature—Love Letter. Love Letter was far from being the monk-robed skeleton’s match. All it could do was constantly retreat and use various strange skills to delay the monk-robed skeleton’s advance.

Seeing that An Sheng was in danger, Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth again to help An Sheng fight the monk-robed skeleton.

Tyrant Behemoth had suffered some injuries, but thankfully, it wasn’t seriously injured. After charging into the collapsing Buddhist kingdom, it immediately activated its Absolute Strength again.

For some reason, the monk-clothed skeleton fearlessly faced Tyrant Behemoth and stuffed the crystal in its eye socket.

The moment the crystal entered his socket, it emitted a golden glow. It made the skeleton’s bones burn with golden flames as though it was bathing in Nirvana Flames.

Boom!

The monk-clothed skeleton’s bone fist collided with Tyrant Behemoth’s fist. They were evenly matched and neither of them managed to gain the upper hand. The terrifying shockwave produced from the collision of strength caused the already damaged streets to be further destroyed.
