Chapter 1222: Live Broadcast of the Cube Battle

Translator: CKtalon

He inserted the memory card into his phone and read the contents. After he was done, Zhou Wen’s expression turned solemn.

The content was very simple. There were no videos or pictures. There was only some short text.

The Cube’s activation this time wasn’t initiated by the dimension? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.

According to Gu Dian’s intelligence, the dimension couldn’t completely control the Cube’s operations. Venus’s appearance was an operation initiated by the Cube.

According to Gu Dian’s analysis, the dimension seemed bent on clearing the dimensional zone on Venus first. Furthermore, it was secretly pushing for this to happen. The League of Guardians had already taken action. Many Guardians that had contracted humans were secretly preparing for battle and buying many items they needed.

The dimension is determined to clear the dimensional zone on Venus? What do they want from Venus’s dimensional zone? Zhou Wen’s expression turned even more solemn after he was done reading.

Zhou Wen destroyed the memory card, not daring to leave any traces of it. Otherwise, it might be restored by some special ability.

I naturally can’t let the dimension obtain what they want. Since they can’t interfere with the operation of the Cube, that makes things simpler. I’ll first explore Venus and might be able to succeed before them. Zhou Wen wanted to enter the dungeon, but the countdown wasn’t up.

When Hui Haifeng returned, the two of them had a meal together. Hui Wan was beside them, chatting as they ate. After the meal, Hui Haifeng left again.

Zhou Wen stayed for half a day and taught Hui Wan the key to cultivating the Qi Refinement Art before letting him practice it himself.

Little could go wrong with an Essence Energy Art like the Qi Refinement Art. As long as he had Essence Energy Crystals, there wouldn’t be too many problems with his cultivation.

After leaving the Hui residence, Zhou Wen repeatedly teleported all the way back to Luoyang, hoping to reach his destination before the countdown ended.

However, Earth had suffered drastic anomalies, so it took longer to return to Luoyang than Zhou Wen had expected. By the time he returned, the huge metal building had already surfaced.

Only the hemispherical metal part was exposed above the magma. No one knew how deep it went.

Just as the Venusian instance dungeon appeared, the golden person from before came in front of the metal building again. He landed on the platform at the top of the hemispherical building without any hesitation.

Thankfully, Zhou Wen had already arrived at a place with a phone signal and could watch the live broadcast on his phone. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

I teleported in, whereas that golden person doesn’t look like he knows spatial skills. How is he going to enter? As Zhou Wen was pondering, he saw the golden person slice off a piece of gold from his body and place it on the platform.

After the piece of gold touched the platform, it seemed to sink like it had dropped into a swamp and was quickly devoured by it.

As the gold was devoured, the platform automatically opened.

The golden person immediately rushed over. As he entered the hemispherical building, the platform’s entrance automatically closed.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that he wouldn’t be able to see anything, but to his surprise, the scene of the Cube changed to the interior of the building. He could see the golden person standing inside the hemispherical building.

Just as Zhou Wen had encountered in-game, there was a Metal Guard inside the building. After seeing the golden person, he immediately raised his metal submachine gun and shot at him.

The golden person extended a palm that emitted golden light, transforming into a light shield in front of him. All the bullets that struck the light shield were blocked.

When the Metal Guard stopped shooting, the golden person’s figure blinked and appeared in front of him. He blasted the Metal Guard’s body apart with a punch, turning it into fragments.

Following that, the situation was identical to Zhou Wen’s. The six doors opened as hordes of Metal Guards rushed out and shot at the golden person from different directions.

The ferocious firepower terrified the spectating humans. It was virtually impossible to dodge.

The golden person’s light shield couldn’t block all the bullets from every direction. In the next second, the golden person’s body turned translucent like a visible Spirit Body.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback as he saw the bullet pass through the golden person’s body without injuring him at all. This was likely a Terror transformation.

However, after a Terror transformation, he should be completely invisible. Why was he still visible?

Could it be that his Terror transformation is a relatively rare type? Zhou Wen thought for a moment and felt that something was amiss. I get it. It’s not that the Terror transformation of the golden person is rare, but the Cube deliberately allows ordinary creatures to see the golden person despite the Terror transformation.

The subsequent battle was a one-sided massacre. The Terror-form golden person slaughtered Mythical Metal Guards like livestock. He didn’t even pick up the dimensional crystals that fell to the ground.

Many of the spectating humans widened their eyes as they looked at the shimmering dimensional crystals on the ground. They wished they could help the golden person pick them up.

“He’s really not picking them up. They are all Mythical dimensional crystals!”

“A Companion Egg... A Companion Egg dropped... He’s still not picking it up...”

The golden person quickly finished off all the Metal Guards. Following that, a familiar scene appeared. The alarm sounded as the Golden Battle God Mark I appeared.

Bam!

The Golden Battle God raised a golden revolver and shot a bullet at the golden person.

The golden person clearly didn’t have Zhou Wen’s teleportation ability. The bullet was too fast, so he couldn’t shoot and deflect it. He condensed a golden shield again, hoping to block the Golden Battle God’s bullet.

The bullet struck the light shield, but it failed to penetrate it. Instead, the bullet shattered.

However, in the next moment, something shocking happened. The shattered bullet turned into a mist of white frost. The frost mist froze whatever it touched.

First was the light shield, then the golden person’s body. Moments later, it was covered in thick frost.

Although the golden person wasn’t really frozen, its mobility was severely affected and its speed slowed down significantly.

The Golden Battle God fired both his guns at the same time, and bullets hit the golden person. Every bullet strengthened the freezing effect on the golden person.

Under a barrage of firing, the golden person’s body exploded, turning into ice shards and gold.

I never expected the Golden Battle God to have such a move! Zhou Wen was alarmed because he had attacked too quickly. The Golden Battle God hadn’t had the chance to use his full strength and was easily dispatched.

Now, Zhou Wen realized that it wasn’t that the Golden Battle God was weak, but that he was too fast.

Once the golden person died, the Cube’s screen returned to its previous point of view, returning to a zoomed out shot of Venus.

Now, Zhou Wen understood that the Cube would broadcast the battle in the dungeon.

Since the Cube isn’t controlled by the dimension, what’s its goal? Zhou Wen frowned in thought.
