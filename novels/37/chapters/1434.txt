Chapter 1435: Reforging Materials

After An Sheng discussed with the blacksmiths, he planned on returning to Overseer Manor and borrow Chick. He wanted it to spew out some fire to melt the Refined Essence Gold.

However, before An Sheng could find Chick, he was summoned by An Tianzuo.

“There’s been so much to deal with recently. Yet, you aren’t focusing on work and instead spend all your time at the weapons factory?” An Tianzuo said with a frown.

An Sheng was afraid that An Tianzuo would be displeased if he knew that he had gotten the few blacksmiths with the best skills to help Zhou Wen forge the saber. Therefore, he said, “The effects of the Essence Gold bullets recently developed by the weapons factory can’t keep up with the evolution speed of dimensional creatures. I just want to see if there’s a way to modify the bullets to improve their effects.”

“And what solution have you come up with?” An Tianzuo said as he read some documents.

“It’s indeed a little difficult. Just pure Essence Gold bullets alone results in great expenditure. Our production of Essence Gold is far from enough. Since using Essence Gold bullets like now while the effects aren’t too good, I’ve been wondering if there are any other materials that are compatible with Essence Gold. Creating an Essence alloy can reduce the quantity of Essence Gold used and guarantee the quality of the bullets.” An Sheng had been considering this problem all this while.

Using pure Essence Gold for the bullet had good effects, but the An family didn’t have that much Essence Gold reserves. It was too extravagant.

However, the laboratory in the weapons factory had tried many materials. The compatibility between ordinary metal and Essence Gold wasn’t high. It wasn’t even of any help. The only thing that worked was the Essence Gold plating.

It seemed impossible to develop an alloy that had an effect equivalent to pure Essence Gold.

“Then what material do you plan on using to make the alloy?” An Tianzuo continued asking without looking up. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“We haven’t found any suitable materials for the time being. The best candidates for the alloy are the bodies of metal-type dimensional creatures…” An Sheng was somewhat helpless.

“I have a material here. Study it and see if it’s compatible with Essence Gold.” An Tianzuo took out a long, flat box from beside his chair and casually placed it on the table. Then, he said casually, “There’s a problem with the origins of this material. It mustn’t be exposed to the public. See if we can make it into an alloy or forge it into a weapon. If it doesn’t work, destroy it.”

“Yes, Overseer.” An Sheng was somewhat curious. He wanted to open the box to see what material it was.

“Take it back before taking a look. Don’t disturb me while I’m working here. You have to quickly settle the matter I instructed you to do. If you delay your work, scram to Chess Mountain to guard it,” An Tianzuo said coldly.

“Yes, I will have it done.” An Sheng didn’t dare stare any further. He picked up the box and walked out.

After leaving An Tianzuo’s office, An Sheng dashed into a meeting room and closed the door and windows. Only then did he open the box to see what material was inside.

When the box opened, An Sheng saw what was inside and was immediately taken aback.

Inside the box was a silver rapier.

Isn’t… Isn’t this the rapier that remained undamaged in the battle with the Immortal Culling Sword??An Sheng reacted and carefully sized up the rapier in surprise.

The silver rapier looked narrow and thin, but it didn’t feel light when he weighed it in his hand. It could even be said to be very heavy. It was a little cold to the touch, like silver made of ice.

On the blade, there were many tiny holes. The small ones were like needles, while the big ones were the size of rice grains.

There’s no mistake about it. It’s definitely that rapier. These holes should have been left behind from the battle with the Immortal Culling Sword. Although it suffered some damage, to be able to resist an existence like the Immortal Culling Sword, the material of this sword is unimaginable. It’s a pity to destroy such a sword even if it can’t be exposed…?An Sheng’s eyes suddenly lit up as though he had understood something. He hurriedly stored the rapier back into the box, picked it up, and rushed to the weapon factory.

The rapier was made of the Holy Temple’s cornerstone, Holy Metal. Not any random Holy Temple cornerstone was called Holy Metal. In fact, the so-called Holy Metal was the bedrock of a Holy Temple and also a core component. If the bedrock of the Holy Temple was destroyed, it would no longer have the foundation to be a Holy Temple again.

The cornerstone Holy Metal was very strong. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been used as a bedrock. Furthermore, after being baptized by the power of the Holy Temple, the cornerstone Holy Metal was considered top-notch. Even Calamity-grade creatures could hardly damage it.

The Immortal Culling Sword only left a few notches in it, a testament to how powerful this material was.

Unfortunately, no matter how strong the material was, it was only a dead sword. It didn’t have its own consciousness, nor did it have any energy augmentation effects. It was just that the material was stronger.

Holy God gave the sword to Xiao to fend off the sharpness of the Immortal Culling Sword. The power used in combat was still thanks to the Guardian.

Even so, the cornerstone Holy Metal was a top-notch material. How could he throw it away?

An Sheng was smart. After seeing the rapier, he understood what An Tianzuo meant.

From the looks of it, Overseer already knows that I’m helping Young Master Wen repair the Bamboo Blade. That’s why he produced this rapier. I wonder how compatible this material is with Essence Gold Essence. If the combination of the two materials isn’t suitable for forging a weapon, wouldn’t I be letting down Overseer’s intentions? No, I have to think of a way to forge it into a weapon…?After An Sheng thought it through, he turned around and returned to Overseer Manor to find Chick.

Refined Essence Gold Essence was difficult to melt without Chick. Needless to say for this rapier—it was a material that even the Immortal Culling Sword couldn’t slice through.

…

After Zhou Wen returned from the Moon, he tried to figure out where he could obtain a misfortune dimensional creature or find a misfortune-type Guardian.

It wasn’t viable to keep Wang Chan on the Moon the entire time. He had to resolve this problem sooner or later.

As he could teleport, he could travel to Earth’s four districts in a short period of time. Furthermore, An Tianzuo had already returned, so he didn’t need to stay in Luoyang forever.

Therefore, Zhou Wen studied the dungeons in the various districts and discovered dimensional creatures that were suspected to have powers of misfortune.

However, there weren’t many of such dimensional creatures to begin with. They needed to be at the Mythical stage and have great potential. Zhou Wen searched around and studied them for a long time, but he still couldn’t make any confirmation.

He had a few targets, but he could only take a look to see if they met Lady Supreme Yin’s requirements.

Zhou Wen chose from among the few targets and finally chose to head to the Pandora Palace dimensional zone in the West District. There were a few dimensional creatures there that were suspected to have the power of misfortune.

As it wasn’t too dangerous this time, Zhou Wen took Ya’er along as a vacation for her.
