Chapter 1043: Showing Off Pets

Translator: CKtalon

This blob of dazzling light was none other than the one who had announced the beginning of the Battle of Guardians. His sudden appearance was clearly because of the Invisibility Cloak and the Golden Battle God Halberd’s rigged match.

The creature in the light slowly said, “From now on, battles between all Companion Beasts have to be decided within an hour. If it exceeds the time limit, both sides will be eliminated. In the final ranking battle for first place, there will be unlimited single challenges. There’s no time limit for the battle. As long as a Guardian challenges, the person in first place has to accept the challenge until no Guardian challenges them again.”

With that said, the dazzling creature vanished into the void. In the cube’s arena, a huge number appeared. It was a three-minute countdown.

“Haha, serves you right for rigging the match. Even the dimensional creatures can’t stand it.”

“Dream on if you believe you can use tricks to win. Does he treat dimensional creatures as fools?”

“Are you dumbfounded now? You can only stall for three minutes at most.”

“The Invisibility Cloak and Golden Battle God Halberd sure did well. They actually forced the Battle of Guardians to change the rules.”

Although everyone discussed spiritedly, Zhou Wen wasn’t filled with anxiety. He hadn’t had any hopes that a single Companion Beast could last forty-eight hours.

I can drag it out for an hour before the challenge, but I can also drag it out for an hour during the battle. In that case, I only need twelve Mythical Companion Beasts to drag it out for twenty-four hours. When the time comes, I’ll repeat them again, allowing me to drag it out for forty-eight hours, Zhou Wen thought to himself. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Wen didn’t waste any time as he waited for the three-minute countdown to end.

Everyone believed that Zhou Wen was in a difficult position to make a choice. Only at the last second did the Invisibility Cloak automatically admit defeat, allowing the Golden Battle God Halberd to occupy first place.

“The Golden Battle God Halberd actually took first place. What a joke.”

“Don’t worry. It won’t stay up there for long. The Guardians will quickly chase it down.”

“Do you think that person will still have Mythical Companion Beasts to afford his continual challenging of himself?”

“I don’t think so. You heard the rules the dimensional creature mentioned. Infinite challenges. This trick is useless. He won’t get first place.”

“Invisibility Cloak and Golden Battle God Halberd are both Companion Beasts from the West District, right? I wonder which family in the West District would do such a shameless thing.”

Seeing that the Golden Battle God Halberd hadn’t accepted the challenge, everyone guessed that it would be dragged to the last second again.

They wanted to see how the Golden Battle God Halberd would be defeated. Although they knew that this was the case, no one left.

After waiting for an hour, there was only one second left to accept the challenge. The arena lit up as the Golden Battle God Halberd accepted the challenge.

“Demon Blood True Dragon, another Companion Beast! Don’t tell me it’s the same person?”

Everyone saw a black dragon appear on the cube’s arena, confronting the Golden Battle God Halberd.

However, after a long confrontation, they still didn’t make a move.

“Holy sh*t, again? Is this person crazy? What’s the point of doing something so useless?”

“Did the embarrassment get to him? It’s clearly impossible to get first place this way, yet he insists on doing this.”

Everyone was very displeased with this act of time stalling, but there was nothing they could do.

Now, they didn’t need to watch to know the outcome. It would definitely be another case of one side admitting defeat at the last second.

Indeed, things went as they expected. At the last second, the Demon Blood True Dragon admitted defeat, allowing Golden Battle God Halberd to remain in first place.

Then, there was another hour of long waiting. Now, everyone knew that it was impossible for the owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd to accept the challenge without dragging it to the last second.

Finally, after waiting for another hour, the Golden Battle God Halberd accepted a challenge. However, the challenger was another Demon Blood True Dragon.

“What the hell is this? Didn’t the Demon Blood True Dragon already go on stage? Isn’t it said that the same Companion Beast can only challenge once a day? Why is it here again?”

“That’s not right. This isn’t the same one. Look carefully. Behind the Demon Blood True Dragon, there’s a tiny Kun character. This one doesn’t have it.”

“It’s true. So it’s not the same one. This person is too shameless. Anyway, he will still lose in the end. Why waste everyone’s time?”

The spectators were very displeased, but Zhou Wen remained indifferent as he continued stalling for time.

Two hours later, another Demon Blood True Dragon entered the cube arena. Four hours later, another Demon Blood True Dragon entered the cube arena.

In the beginning, there were still people complaining, but now, no one was complaining.

“Four True Blood Demon Dragons. These are all Mythical Companion Beasts. Together with the Golden Battle God Halberd and Concealment, there are already six Mythical Companion Beasts. Do you think these Mythical Companion Beasts belong to one person or a family clan?”

“The possibility of a family clan is higher, right? It’s rare for a person to have so many Mythical Companion Beasts.”

“I think they might be owned by one person.”

...

In Luoyang’s Overseer Manor, An Sheng and An Tianzuo were watching the live broadcast.

“The fourth Demon Blood True Dragon. Don’t tell me Young Master Wen has already gathered the nine Demon Blood True Dragons that pull the carriage?” An Sheng said.

“It’s already lucky to have four. It’s unlikely there will be any more,” An Tianzuo said indifferently.

“Young Master Wen’s luck seems pretty good, so it’s hard to say.” An Sheng disagreed with An Tianzuo’s view.

“What’s there to be unsure about? Luck has its limitations,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.

...

It was unknown if there was some unknown force affecting the turn of events, but just as An Tianzuo finished speaking, Zhou Wen, who was farming his dungeons, had another Demon Dragon True Dragon Companion Egg drop.

Zhou Wen was originally still fretting over what Companion Beast to use for battle, but now, he didn’t have to worry about it. He hatched the fifth True Blood Demon Dragon and waited for the time to be up.

“It’s the fifth one... There’s really a fifth one... How is this a duel? It’s simply showing off Companion Beasts!”

“If the owners of these Companion Beasts are the same person, it will be terrifying.”

“I wonder if there will be another Dragon Blood True Dragon. From the words at the back, it seems to be arranged according to the Eight Trigrams. There should be a total of eight, right?”

“How can it be so easy to gather them? I want to see how many Mythical Companion Beasts that person has.”

People who were originally very displeased with this kind of rigged match hoped to see how many Mythical Companion Beasts the owner of the Golden Battle God Halberd would have.

...

“Overseer, it’s the fifth one,” An Sheng reported softly.

“I can see that,” An Tianzuo said expressionlessly.
