Chapter 841: Entering the Fiend Tomb Again

Translator: CKtalon

When it was time for Pill Furnace Mountain to respawn pill essence, Zhou Wen went to farm them again. The Golden Overlord Sword killed the pill essence that spewed out one by one. As he killed them, he suddenly saw a strange pill essence spew out from Pill Furnace Mountain.

The pill essence wasn’t the common red and golden color. Although it was white, it wasn’t a dragon-patterned Rejuvenation Pill. It had black colors, but it wasn’t a tiger-patterned Resurrection Pill either.

It was a pill that was half white, half black, half dragon-patterned, and half tiger-patterned. It looked strange and strangely harmonious. From the pill essence, one could faintly hear dragon and tiger roars.

Clang!

The Golden Overlord Sword slashed at the pill essence, but a white dragon-shaped Essence Energy rushed out of the pill, blocking the Golden Overlord Sword’s sword beam.

Although the dragon-shaped Essence Energy was ultimately shattered by the Golden Overlord Sword, the latter did not then have the strength to injure the pill essence.

Before the Golden Overlord Sword could deliver a second attack, a tiger’s roar sounded from the pill essence’s body. A black-colored Essence Energy condensed into a ferocious tiger and pounced at the blood-colored avatar.

Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and slammed down with his claw, shattering the Essence Energy tiger.

Tyrant Behemoth took another step forward, wanting to shatter the pill essence as well. However, a dragon and tiger’s roar sounded from the pill essence’s body. The shadow of a dragon and tiger rose and actually blocked Tyrant Behemoth’s attack.

Tyrant Behemoth struck out several times, but it failed to shatter the dragon-tiger shadows. All it could do was activate Absolute Strength and roar as it struck out again. After more than ten punches, it shattered the dragon-tiger shadows.

The pill essence was also repeatedly struck by Tyrant Behemoth’s punches. Finally, it shattered into pieces. Its healing speed couldn’t keep up with the shattering speed.

‘Killed Mythical creature, Dragon Tiger Pill Essence. Discovered Companion Egg.’

When Zhou Wen saw the game notification, he saw a Companion Egg drop. He couldn’t help but be delighted as he hurriedly picked it up and hatched it.

Wheel of Destiny: Resurrection

What a powerful pill essence. Can this thing really resurrect the dead? Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be overjoyed when he saw the information on the Dragon Tiger Pill Essence.

Ignoring the other attributes, its Wheel of Destiny was somewhat powerful. In the introduction, it said that it had the ability to revive the dead. He didn’t know if that was true.

However, without a doubt, this was a life-saving item. Even if it was difficult to resurrect the dead, it would definitely have miraculous effects when used on serious injuries.

With such a treasure, Zhou Wen was even more motivated. Unfortunately, he didn’t gain anything after grinding the 81 pill essences.

During this period of time, there was no news from the Zhang family. Zhang Yuzhi didn’t return. The date of the auction was approaching.

This morning, Zhou Wen took Ya’er out for a stroll as usual. When he walked to the nearby river, he saw Zhang Chunqiu sitting on a bench by the river.

“What a coincidence.” Zhou Wen walked over with Ya’er to greet him.

“It’s not a coincidence. I came here specially to wait for you,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. “Why didn’t you go to the hotel to look for me?”

Zhang Chunqiu’s face was filled with exhaustion, but he still said with a smile, “It’s been stifling these past few days. I wanted to come out to take a breather, so I decided to wait for you here.”

“What’s the matter?” Zhou Wen asked.

“The matter with the Fiend Tomb is very troublesome. More than ten people from the Zhang family have died. They have all jumped into the Fiend Tomb and become Fiend Stone statues,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“Hasn’t someone been watching?” Zhou Wen was alarmed.

“It’s useless. No one knows who will be the next one to jump. Perhaps the next one to jump will be the person guarding it. We have already thought of many solutions and even evacuated everyone from the Fiend Tomb, but there are still people who have walked to the Fiend Tomb themselves and become Fiend Stone statues,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a sigh.

“Is there anything I can help you with?” On account of Zhang Yuzhi, Zhou Wen didn’t mind helping if he could.

Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and said, “Up to now, I haven’t figured out a solution. I’m not here because of Fiend Tomb.”

“Then why are you looking for me?” Zhou Wen asked in puzzlement.

The Zhang family had encountered such a huge problem, but Zhang Chunqiu still took the time to meet him. It was probably something important.

“I came here to ask you a favor. The Zhang family is in contact with Sunset College. If there aren’t any problems, Yuzhi should be able to be a tutor at Sunset College. When the time comes, I hope you can take care of her. She doesn’t have many friends, so I can’t beg others,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“Is the matter with the Fiend Tomb really that dangerous?” Zhou Wen knew that if they weren’t doing it out of desperation, how would the Zhang family let Zhang Yuzhi leave Mount Dragon Tiger to go to Sunset College?

The Zhang family must have reached a helpless state before making such a decision.

“It’s just a precaution. After the auction ends, I’ll get Yuzhi to accompany you to Luoyang. If the Zhang family can successfully pass this trial, I’ll bring her back,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

Zhou Wen felt that this was an opportunity. Therefore, he looked at Zhang Chunqiu and said, “Although I don’t know much about the Fiend Tomb, I have some special abilities. Perhaps they can be of some help to the Fiend Tomb. If your Zhang family doesn’t mind, can you let me do a comprehensive survey of the Fiend Tomb?”

“The Zhang family is extremely grateful that you are willing to help us, so why would we mind? However, the Fiend Tomb is too dangerous. Anyone who has come into contact with the Fiend Tomb might subconsciously walk into it. I’m afraid...” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t continue, but his meaning was very clear.

“I’ve already been to the Fiend Tomb. If there’s really a problem, I won’t be able to escape. I’m doing this for myself.” Zhou Wen’s last sentence was the truth.

Surveying was only an excuse. What he really wanted to do was take a picture of the tiny palm symbol and download the Fiend Tomb dungeon.

After Zhou Wen downloaded the Fiend Tomb dungeon, he could enter the Fiend Tomb in-game. Perhaps he could resolve the Zhang family’s problems.

“When do you want to go?” Zhang Chunqiu asked after some thought.

“The sooner the better. This matter can’t be delayed,” Zhou Wen said.

“In that case, come with me now.” Zhang Chunqiu led Zhou Wen to the Fiend Tomb again.

Zhou Wen was delighted. This time, he could finally approach the Fiend Tomb and take a picture of the tiny palm symbol on it.

When they arrived at the Fiend Tomb again, there were clearly more people from the Zhang family stationed here. On every stone platform, there were four people sitting facing each other. If anything happened, the other three would immediately know to prevent any accidents.
