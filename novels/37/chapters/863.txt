Chapter 864: Selling the Sword

Translator: CKtalon

Zhou Wen watched from the side for a while before finally understanding the reason behind Liu Yun’s argument with the old man.

Liu Yun insisted on buying the old man’s bronze sword, but the old man refused to sell it no matter what. One insisted on buying while the other refused to sell. Therefore, they began arguing.

It wasn’t that the old man really wasn’t selling it, but that the old man insisted on using the bronze sword to exchange for a Mythical Companion Beast. Otherwise, he wouldn’t sell it no matter how much money was given.

The old man also said that his bronze sword had been dug out from the Founding Emperor Tomb before the dimensional storms. It was the Founding Emperor’s sword.

No one believed him. Even if it was really the Founding Emperor’s sword, it wasn’t worth much in modern times. At most, it was an antique.

However, the old man insisted on exchanging the sword for a Mythical Companion Beast. It was unknown what Liu Yun was up to. He insisted on buying the sword, but he couldn’t produce a Mythical Companion Beast.

Something’s amiss. How can a thick-skinned fellow like Liu Yun buy a sword so honestly? It’s even more impossible for him to make a din here. If he really wanted that sword, he should have secretly stolen it... What is this fellow trying to do? Zhou Wen thought to himself.

“I’ll give you three Epic Bronze Man Companion Eggs in exchange for your sword,” Liu Yun said to the old man.

“I won’t exchange even for ten, much less three.” The old man was very stubborn. He hugged the bronze sword and refused to let go. He was dead stubborn.

When others heard that Liu Yun wanted to exchange three Bronze Man Companion Eggs for a crappy bronze sword, they were alarmed.

“How about five? This is all I have,” Liu Yun said as he placed five Companion Eggs in front of the old man.

Everyone was alarmed when they saw this. There were very few locals who didn’t know the Bronze Man Companion Egg. Even if they hadn’t personally obtained one, they had definitely seen one.

The five Companion Eggs that Liu Yun took out were undoubtedly Bronze Men.

“Dude, you have five Bronze Man Companion Eggs. Why don’t you exchange them for something good? Why do you have to exchange them for his crappy sword?” a person beside him said.

Everyone agreed. Bronze Man Companion Eggs were very famous, but there weren’t many of them, so their prices were very high. To be able to produce five at once was something even the elderly who had been setting up stalls here had never seen.

“Nothing else. I just like that sword. I think it might be a treasure,” Liu Yun said casually.

“This is obviously a treasure. If you want it, you can exchange it using a Mythical Companion Beast. Otherwise, it’s useless no matter what you say,” the old man said firmly.

Everyone found Liu Yun and the old man crazy. Liu Yun was a prodigal, and the old man was a fool.

A burly man squeezed forward and looked at the five Bronze Man Companion Eggs on the ground. He swallowed his saliva and said to Liu Yun, “Brother, I have a sword that’s about the same as his. If you want it, I’ll sell it for five Bronze Man Companion Eggs.”

“I want a treasure sword dug out from the Founding Emperor Tomb. Do you think I want any sword?” Liu Yun curled his lips. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Hey, what the hell are you saying. This sword of mine was a treasure my great-grandfather dug out from the Founding Emperor Tomb,” the man hurriedly said.

“For real?” Liu Yun looked at the sword in his hand in disbelief.

Indeed, the two ancient swords were very similar with only slight differences. From a comprehensive take of the two swords, they likely originated from the same period.

“Of course it’s real. It’s definitely more real than that old man’s,” the man said as he patted his chest.

However, the old man said coldly, “Don’t be greedy for small gains. If you are greedy, you will suffer a huge loss. What’s the point of buying a fake with five Companion Eggs?”

“Old man, whose goods are you calling fake? You are the one selling a fake,” the man said angrily.

Liu Yun laughed and said to the old man, “Old man, don’t tell me you are regretting it? It’s too late for regrets now. I won’t buy your sword. Let’s see who else will offer such a high price.”

With that said, Liu Yun pushed the five Companion Eggs towards the man and said, “I don’t care if yours is genuine or fake. I’ll buy yours. I want to let that old fool regret it.”

The burly man was overjoyed as he hurriedly took the Bronze Man Companion Eggs. He was still worried, so he got someone to check them for him. After confirming that they were Bronze Man Companion Eggs, he handed the ancient sword to Liu Yun.

“Old Man, just wallow in regret.” As Liu Yun spoke, he left.

Zhou Wen put on the Invisibility Cloak and secretly followed.

Liu Yun didn’t go to the town. After making a turn, he ran to a nearby forest and sat on a large tree root to smoke.

After a while, he saw the old man who was trying to sell the sword sneak into the forest.

When Zhou Wen saw the elder, he immediately came to a realization. The two of them were in cahoots. They had caused a commotion just to make the burly man sell his sword.

The burly man was a freelance hunter who had entered a dimensional zone. He wasn’t selling things at a stall. They definitely wanted the burly man’s sword, but it wasn’t convenient for them to just buy it from him, so they had set up such a trap.

What’s that ancient sword? Is it worth Liu Yun spending so much effort on? Zhou Wen secretly sized up the ancient sword in Liu Yun’s arms.

“How is it? Is it real?” the old man asked Liu Yun after entering.

“There’s no problem. It’s real. With this sword, we can enter the Founding Emperor Tomb,” said Liu Yun.

“Let me take a look,” the old man said as he went to take the sword.

However, Liu Yun retracted his hand and didn’t let the old man touch the sword. He said with a smile, “Why are you in such a rush? Didn’t we agree that I’ll hold the sword and open the door? When we return, we’ll split the items equally. With the sword with me, don’t worry because nothing will go wrong.”

“I’m just afraid that you’ll be cheated. I’ll help you take a look and see if that’s really the Emperor Qin Sword,” the old man said without changing his expression.

“I have always been the scammer, not the other way. Don’t worry.” Liu Yun held the ancient sword and asked the old man, “When are we going to take action?”

“The sooner the better. If you’re ready, we’ll take action tonight,” the old man said.

“Alright, it’s settled then. We’ll meet outside the Founding Emperor Tomb tonight.” Liu Yun turned around and left.

The old man watched Liu Yun’s back disappear before turning to leave.

Zhou Wen secretly looked in the direction the old man had left and fell into thought. He had a nagging feeling that the old man was somewhat familiar, as though he had seen him somewhere before. However, from his face and figure, he didn’t seem to have any impression of him.

This old man... Don’t tell me he’s Jing Daoxian... An idea suddenly flashed in Zhou Wen’s mind as he thought of that familiar feeling.

This was because the aura the old man occasionally exuded was very similar to Jing Daoxian’s, but his appearance and figure were different.

Changing his looks and figure shouldn’t be difficult for Jing Daoxian. I think it’s most likely him. However, why is he with Liu Yun? Why do the two of them want to enter the Founding Emperor Tomb? Zhou Wen was filled with curiosity.
