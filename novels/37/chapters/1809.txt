Chapter 1810 Never A Defeat in Life

“Cough… Zhou Lingfeng lied to me… Or did you lie to Zhou Lingfeng…” Jing Daoxian, who had lost all his blood, was on his last breath. He coughed repeatedly, but there was no blood left to cough out.

“Only the two of you have seen my true body,” The Thearch said indifferently.

“In that case… It seems… I’ve also lost… That’s acceptable…” As Jing Daoxian spoke, his vitality rapidly dissipated and he quickly stopped breathing.

The Thearch’s sharp eyes stared at Zhou Wen.

“Ahem, The Thearch, don’t misunderstand. I knew that Jing Daoxian wasn’t your match. I was just trying to trick him into revealing his true colors,” Zhou Wen said with a cough.

“You aren’t anything good either.” The Thearch snorted coldly.

“The Thearch, you lied to me too, right? We’re all the same. Let’s not exchange snides at each other,” Zhou Wen said.

The Thearch glanced at Zhou Wen and said coldly, “I never expected to lose to you and your father. The item is yours, but there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. I’ll make sure to spend a good time with you and your father.”

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He had already guessed something.

What The Thearch had said was basically the truth, but she had lied to Zhou Wen at the critical moment.

The Thearch was clearly an Immortal, so why did she have the outer shell of a human? Zhou Wen had always been puzzled about this.

Later on, he finally figured it out. Now, he was basically certain that his judgment back then wasn’t wrong.

The reason why The Thearch had a human body was definitely because only humans could possess or use the item in the box.

......

If Zhou Wen had opened the box previously, the item inside would have most likely been snatched away by The Thearch.

Now that she didn’t have a human shell, The Thearch had lost the right to obtain the item in the box. The threat to Zhou Wen was greatly reduced.

However, from what The Thearch had said, the truth was probably more complicated than Zhou Wen had imagined.

It was very likely that it involved the woman who had steered the ship over. Perhaps The Thearch’s human shell was created by that woman. There was some agreement between the two of them.

“A figure like you will naturally keep your word. Since you said that you will settle scores with us in the future, you won’t make things difficult for me today, right?” Zhou Wen wasn’t willing to fight The Thearch to the death now.

“Try saying another word of nonsense.” The Thearch was clearly in a bad mood.

Zhou Wen smiled and didn’t say anything else. He took out the key and inserted it into the keyhole of the jade box before gently turning the key.

The Thearch and Zhou Wen were taken aback because the key remained motionless despite Zhou Wen using his strength several times.

“Is this key really meant to open this box?” Zhou Wen looked at The Thearch.

The Thearch’s expression was somewhat odd. She got Zhou Wen to pull out the key and looked at it for a while before returning it to him for him to try again.

The outcome was the same. No matter how hard Zhou Wen tried, the key couldn’t open the jade box.

“How is this… Impossible…” The Thearch wore a look of disbelief.

“From the looks of it, I can’t help you. I’ll return this to you.” Zhou Wen threw the key to The Thearch.

In fact, Zhou Wen had long guessed that he might not be able to open this jade box because he wasn’t the Earth Companion Beast that The Thearch had mentioned.

If he was an Earth Companion Beast, how could Prisoner not sense it back then? After all, he was once an Earth Companion Beast. It was impossible for him not to sense it at all.

“That’s impossible. You are Earth’s Companion Beast. You should be able to open it. Unless… Impossible… If you aren’t the baby Zhou Lingfeng took away, how can you master the Lost Immortal Sutra…” The Thearch had clearly figured out something, but not everything.

Zhou Wen had long figured it out. Zhou Lingfeng hadn’t lied to him. Zhou Lingfeng had indeed swapped him with An Jing. If he wasn’t wrong, An Jing was Earth’s Companion Beast.

What Zhou Wen couldn’t figure out was what method Zhou Lingfeng had used to deceive everyone. Even an existence like The Thearch hadn’t discovered anything.

“Zhou Lingfeng, well f*cking done. He really put in a lot of effort to prevent me from escaping!” The Thearch seemed to have figured everything out as she gritted her teeth in hatred.

She was born an Apocalypse and had been virtually invincible her entire life. Her only defeat was at the hands of an unimaginable person who ended up dying because of their fight.

Now, she had been schemed against by mere humans. This made The Thearch feel extremely humiliated.

“The Thearch, what’s going on? Two heads are better than one. Tell me and let’s analyze it together. I’m still confused,” Zhou Wen asked, feigning ignorance.

“You are the scapegoat Zhou Lingfeng found. What right do you have to make sarcastic remarks in front of me?” The Thearch said coldly.

“You mean that my father wants me to die in place of Earth’s Companion Beast?” Zhou Wen said in surprise.

“Hmph, you’re still calling him ‘father?’. You’re really hopelessly stupid to acknowledge a scoundrel as your father. If you were really the son of that shameless Zhou Lingfeng, how could he have made you a scapegoat and hide the real Earth Companion Beast?” The Thearch looked at Zhou Wen as though she was looking at an idiot.

“However, I don’t understand. Why can you cultivate the Lost Immortal Sutra when you aren’t Earth’s Companion Beast? This is impossible.” The Thearch sized up Zhou Wen. She still couldn’t figure it out.

“Why not? Didn’t you say that Earth’s Companion Beast is human? I’m also human. Didn’t Jing Daoxian also master the Lost Immortal Sutra?” Zhou Wen said.

“Is that thing he mastered worthy of being called the Lost Immortal Sutra?” The Thearch said disdainfully, “Between stones, how can granite compare to diamonds?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Perhaps I’m a stone that resembles a diamond?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Leave. I’ve never felt more ashamed in my life. However, even if the Earth Companion Beast doesn’t take it away, it’s only a matter of time before I break out. In less than a year, this thing will naturally be born and my oath will be nullified. When that happens, I want to see how Zhou Lingfeng will stop me.” The Thearch sat back on the box and closed her eyes, ignoring Zhou Wen.

Seeing that The Thearch was ignoring him, Zhou Wen glanced at Jing Daoxian’s corpse and said, “I’ll be taking his corpse with me.”

Seeing that The Thearch still had no intention of bothering with him, Zhou Wen carried Jing Daoxian’s corpse and walked out.

Death was the ultimate punishment. Since he was already a dead man, there was nothing to fuss about. Liu Yun was still waiting outside. After all, Jing Daoxian was his only family. He would take his corpse to Liu Yun and have him bury Jing Daoxian in peace. After leaving Nüwa Temple, he saw Liu Yun still guarding outside.

Liu Yun’s expression changed when he saw Jing Daoxian’s corpse.

Just as Zhou Wen was about to return the corpse to Liu Yun and explain what had happened, he suddenly felt the corpse in his hand move.

Zhou Wen jumped in fright and threw the corpse to the ground.

A crack appeared on the shriveled corpse’s back. Something was squirming inside as it tore open the gap bit by bit and crawled out.

It started with a finger then an entire palm. An arm drilled out, followed by the head and body.

A young and miniature Jing Daoxian crawled out with a baby-like body, leaving a strange empty mortal coil on the ground.

“You’re not dead?” Zhou Wen looked at the young version of Jing Daoxian in surprise. “Lost Immortal Sutra. If I can’t even get an Immortal lost, how can it be called Lost Immortal? I naturally won’t die so easily.” Not only had Jing Daoxian’s body turned into a youth, but even his voice had become very tender. He was like a child whose voice hadn’t cracked. It didn’t match his tone at all and sounded very strange.

As expected of Jing Daoxian! Zhou Wen couldn’t help but praise inwardly. None of the old fellows who could dominate the Federation back then were easy to deal with.

Only now did Zhou Wen understand why Jing Daoxian had to bring Liu Yun here to guard the door. What seemed like a gratuitous act now appeared to be a well-planned scheme.
