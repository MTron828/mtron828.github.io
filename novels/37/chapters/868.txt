Chapter 869: Twelve Gold Men

Translator: CKtalon

“Zhou Wen, I’ll leave this to you,” Jing Daoxian said as he pointed at the golden man walking over.

“Isn’t your Yin Yang Mirror very powerful? Can’t you just use it? Why go through so much trouble?” Zhou Wen said.

“Unfortunately, the Yin Yang Mirror is only useful against lifeforms with flesh and blood. It’s not very useful against such Gold Men.” Jing Daoxian didn’t seem to have any qualms as he revealed the Yin Yang Mirror’s weakness.

Zhou Wen didn’t know if what he said was true, but he could only summon Tyrant Behemoth and let it fight the Gold Man.

The Gold Man’s strength and defense were very strong. It wasn’t at a disadvantage when fighting Tyrant Behemoth. Zhou Wen had no choice but to get Tyrant Behemoth to activate Absolute Strength to quickly finish off the Gold Man.

Under the suppression of Absolute Strength, the Gold Man was immediately sent retreating by Tyrant Behemoth. Just as he was about to withstand heavy damage after failing to put up a defense, another Gold Man rushed down and joined the battle.

With the addition of this Gold Man, the first Gold Man became much stronger. However, it was still no match for Tyrant Behemoth.

The Gold Men came down one after another. They attacked Tyrant Behemoth together, and their cooperation was almost flawless.

Not good!

Zhou Wen saw the problem. The twelve Gold Men were similar to the nine black dragons in the underground sea. They could share each other’s powers.

After seven Gold Men joined the battle, their strength was already on par with Tyrant Behemoth, who had activated Absolute Strength. It was difficult for Tyrant Behemoth to gain an advantage.

“Tyrant Behemoth is about to be overwhelmed. You should do something, right?” Zhou Wen said to Jing Daoxian.

Jing Daoxian smiled and said, “All you need to do is lure the twelve Gold Men in front of the palace down. I’ll enter the temple to take something and we’ll leave immediately. It won’t take long.”

Zhou Wen knew that Jing Daoxian had ulterior motives for bringing him to the Founding Emperor Tomb. It wasn’t as simple as borrowing the Earth Elemental Beast.

More and more Gold Men came down the stairs. When ten Gold Men besieged Tyrant Behemoth, Tyrant Behemoth was already in a losing position. It looked like it couldn’t hold on much longer.

“I’m afraid that Tyrant Behemoth won’t be able to last until all twelve of the Gold Men are down before it’s killed. It’s best you make plans early.” Zhou Wen was telling the truth. Although Tyrant Behemoth was powerful, it was still impossible for it to fight twelve alone.

The strength and physique of these Gold Men were very strong to begin with. Furthermore, they could borrow each other’s strength. Even Tyrant Behemoth with Absolute Strength was about to be defeated.

“Forget it. I’ll settle the remaining two myself,” Jing Daoxian said as he charged towards the palace guarded by the twelve Gold Men.

Zhou Wen saw him rush over the battlefield like a strange bird with the Yin Yang Mirror in hand. He wanted to rush into the palace.

The two Gold Men who had yet to come down immediately realized Jing Daoxian’s intentions. They stood in front of the palace door and threw punches at him.

Jing Daoxian’s body was in midair as a ring on his finger spun. Then, Zhou Wen saw his figure vanish. When he appeared again, he was already in front of the palace door.

Teleportation ability. Could it be that the Essence Energy Art Jing Daoxian cultivates in is spatial? As Zhou Wen guessed, Jing Daoxian had already slammed into the palace door.

Strangely enough, the palace door was clearly closed, but when Jing Daoxian slammed into it, he seemed to be able to penetrate the wall. The door failed to stop him at all.

The fists of the two Gold Men slammed heavily onto the door, causing it to rumble. However, they failed to move the door at all.

Unable to find Jing Daoxian, the two Gold Men turned around and rushed into the battlefield, joining in the fight against Tyrant Behemoth.

Tyrant Behemoth was already having a hard time holding on. With the addition of the two Gold Men, it immediately lost the strength to resist. It received several punches on its body, causing its bones to crack.

“These twelve Gold Men are too powerful. Even Tyrant Behemoth isn’t their match. Let’s retreat now.” Liu Yun retreated as he spoke, but when he arrived at the city gates, he was blocked by a strange force. He couldn’t leave no matter what.

Liu Yun gathered his strength and struck again and again, but he still couldn’t charge out.

“There’s no need for you to try. I’ve already gotten the Earth Elemental Beast to try. It can’t even escape with Earth Escape.” Zhou Wen had already tried. If he could escape, he wouldn’t have let Tyrant Behemoth withstand the twelve Gold Men’s attacks.

“Jing Daoxian rushed into the palace to take the treasures, but he made us wait here for death. He’s clearly trying to scam us,” said Liu Yun.

“That might not be the case. Although the twelve Gold Men are powerful with extremely powerful Strength and Constitution, they aren’t fast. As long as we don’t fight them head-on, it won’t be easy for them to kill us in a short period of time. The problem now is how do we enter the palace? We can’t really just wait for Jing Daoxian to come out, right?” Zhou Wen said as he unsummoned Tyrant Behemoth. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Having lost their important target, Tyrant Behemoth, the twelve Gold Men immediately charged at Zhou Wen and Liu Yun.

Zhou Wen didn’t wait for them to come over as he started using his movement technique and charged towards the twelve Gold Men.

He had been watching from the side for a while and had a general understanding of the abilities of the twelve Gold Men. Although it wasn’t easy to kill them, it wasn’t difficult to stay alive.

Zhou Wen used Transcendent Flying Immortal and constantly shuttled through the twelve Gold Men. Although the twelve Gold Men were powerful, they appeared somewhat clumsy and failed to touch Zhou Wen.

Liu Yun also quickly dodged the twelve Gold Men’s attacks. He was also good at movement techniques and wasn’t much weaker than Zhou Wen.

“When the two Gold Men smashed their fists into the palace door, they failed to budge it at all. I’m afraid that the door can’t be opened with brute force. Otherwise, Jing Daoxian wouldn’t have needed to pass through the wall. We don’t know how to pass through walls, so it won’t be easy to enter,” Liu Yun said as he dodged.

“You have to give it a try even if it’s not easy. Aren’t you the best thief in the world? Can’t a thief like you even open a door?” Zhou Wen said.

“It’s not difficult to open the door, but it needs time. We are now being chased by these twelve Gold Men. There’s no way out. How do I have the time to open the door?” Liu Yun said gloomily.

“I’ll hold them back. Take the opportunity to open the door,” Zhou Wen said after some thought.

“How are you going to hold them back? Even Tyrant Behemoth couldn’t withstand it. Do you have any stronger Companion Beasts?” Liu Yun asked in puzzlement.

“I don’t have any stronger Companion Beasts, but if I want to hold them back, I don’t need powerful Companion Beasts. I just need to tank the beating,” Zhou Wen said as he summoned a Companion Beast.
