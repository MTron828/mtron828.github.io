Chapter 659: Fiend Man Evolution

“Are you telling me that this person comes from the Family Clan of Gods?” Shen Yuchi frowned.

“That’s not what I meant. Based on the information we currently have, the Family Clan of Gods has the highest chance of possessing the Golden Battle God Halberd,” Qiao Siyuan said.

Shen Yuchi looked at Qiao Siyuan for a while before saying meaningfully, “Your intelligence is timely.”

Qiao Siyuan’s expression didn’t change as he said, “It’s my job. Director-General, you handed such an important mission to me, but I screwed it up. I deserve death. Please mete out your punishment.”

Shen Yuchi looked at Qiao Siyuan and said with a smile, “Then go to the Cape family and explain this matter clearly.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Yes, I screwed up. I will definitely explain it to Senator Cape. It has nothing to do with our Special Inspector Bureau.” After bowing, Qiao Siyuan left Shen Yuchi’s office.

After Qiao Siyuan left, a person walked out of an inner room.

It was a woman in a suit and she looked very capable. However, she was wearing a hat that was pulled very low. With large sunglasses covering half of her face, it was almost impossible to tell her looks. However, her full, fair chin and red lips left a deep impression.

“Button, what do you think of this person?” Shen Yuchi asked the woman.

The woman called Button said calmly, “Do you mean the person in the video or Minister Qiao?”

“Both.” Shen Yuchi tapped his fingers rhythmically on the table as though he was thinking about something.

“The person in the video wears an unknown type of armor. The weapon is just as Minister Qiao said; it’s the Golden Battle God Halberd. The Metalwork Temple is a reserved area of the Family Clan of Gods. Their family does have a Golden Battle God Halberd, but that doesn’t mean anything. As for Minister Qiao, he’s very smart. He gave himself a chance to live and has given the Cape family an excuse. The Cape family probably won’t make things difficult for him when he goes to them,” said Button.

Shen Yuchi nodded. “Among the many ministers, Qiao Siyuan is the most capable. Furthermore, he keeps a low profile and doesn’t fight for fame or fortune. At the same time, he doesn’t even have many hobbies.”

“Do you think there’s something wrong with him?” Button asked.

“The operation this time was highly confidential. Very few people knew about it. Only Cai Jin, Qiao Siyuan, and Liz knew the details. Cai Jin was an extremely careful person. Under such circumstances, he was actually ambushed and had the Blood Oxypetalum seed snatched from him. There’s a high chance that there’s a traitor in our midst,” Shen Yuchi said after some thought.

“Do you want me to investigate?” Button asked.

“You don’t have to worry about that. Help me make a trip to the Family Clan of Gods and send a copy of the video to them,” Shen Yuchi said.

Zhou Wen grinded dungeons in his dorm the entire time, but strangely, he obtained plenty of the six skills such as the Room Solar Rabbit, but he failed to obtain a single Neck Gold Dragon.

With one of the Azure Dragon seven palaces missing, the other six were useless.

In the boundless Endless Sea of Stars, he also failed to find the Astral Combat Beasts. This dungeon was just too huge. Zhou Wen guessed that it would take him a month or two to clear it.

However, he could do nothing else if he continued grinding like this. It would take up all his time. Most of the dimensional creatures in the Endless Sea of Stars were useless. This left Zhou Wen vexed.

Wait a minute. There are actually twenty-eight Lunar Mansions in the Endless Sea of Stars. Then, is the distribution of the planets here related to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions? Zhou Wen decided to check.

The twenty-eight Lunar Mansions was the ancient way of dividing the cosmos. They divided the area around the celestial sphere’s ecliptic plane and celestial equator into twenty-eight regions.

If the Endless Sea of Stars was really arranged in such a pattern, one could determine the location of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions.

However, Zhou Wen’s understanding of such knowledge was very limited. He only knew the name, but he knew nothing about the distribution.

He went online to search for some information, but there were many contradictory points on the Internet. Furthermore, they explained things unclearly. After reading for a long time, Zhou Wen roughly figured out the approximate distribution and locations of the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions.

After comparing it with the Endless Sea of Stars dungeon, he realized that some of the star charts in the Endless Sea were indeed similar to the twenty-eight Lunar Mansions. And the place where he had obtained the skills like the Room Solar Rabbit and Heart Lunar Fox was none other than the region of the Azure Dragon’s seven palaces.

This region was extremely huge. After grinding for so long, Zhou Wen still failed to leave the range of the Azure Dragon’s seven palaces.

It’s indeed so. It’s no wonder I only managed to obtain the Azure Dragon’s seven palaces’ skills. Zhou Wen roughly analyzed the situation and rushed to the stellar domain where the Neck Gold Dragon was. He planned on farming the Neck Gold Dragon to see what use those skills had.

However, the Neck Gold Dragon didn’t appear that easily. He swept the entire area but saw nothing of the Neck Gold Dragon.

Don’t tell me this is as difficult to farm as Poison Dragon Palm 3!

He felt that things weren’t looking good. He had six but was still lacking one. If it was really that difficult to farm for it, he didn’t know when he would be able to have it drop.

How can I find Liu Yun? I have to ask which small planet the so-called Astral Combat Beast is on. Zhou Wen was extremely vexed. His knowledge of Liu Yun was very limited. He didn’t have his phone number or address, so he didn’t know how to find him.

After grinding for a few days, Zhou Wen was on the brink of giving up. It was indeed difficult to farm for Neck Gold Dragons.

Crack!

The evolving Explosive Fiend Man finally broke out of its shell. The evolved Explosive Fiend Man was still like a Tesla Trooper. It wore heavy armor, and even the pipes were black. There was also a crystal cylinder on its back. One could see something red inside, making it look very strange.

Zhou Wen looked at the Explosive Fiend Man’s stats.

Explosive Fiend Man: Legendary (Evolvable)

Life Providence: Unlawful

Strength: 21

Speed: 21

Constitution: 21

Essence Energy: 21

Talent Skill: Death List, Time-Blast

Companion Form: Self-detonation Device

His stats didn’t change much just as Zhou Wen had expected. Zhou Wen focused on studying the Explosive Fiend Man’s Life Providence.

Unlawful: Unrestricted by laws for a period of time.

Zhou Wen couldn’t help but be alarmed. This Life Providence wasn’t restricted by rules or laws. This annotation implied that he was rather powerful, but Zhou Wen didn’t know what the actual effects were.

Before Zhou Wen could experiment with the Explosive Fiend Man’s Life Providence, the Explosive Fiend Man began evolving again, turning into an egg once more.

From the looks of it, the power of the Blood Oxypetalum seed is a little too potent. It actually allowed Explosive Fiend Man to continuously evolve. I wonder where the bureau’s blood came from. Zhou Wen also wanted to get one himself when he saw how effective the Blood Oxypetalum seed was.

Just as he was thinking, his phone suddenly rang. It was Li Xuan.

“Old Zhou, quickly go online and watch the battle. A Companion Beast is challenging Primordial Sword Immortal. It’s the Xia family’s Companion Beast,” Li Xuan said excitedly.
