Chapter 1295: Lady Luck’s Necklace

Zhou Wen carefully studied the skill, Wings of Tomorrow, but he couldn’t figure out what kind of skill it was.

Its literal meaning made it appear to be a skill that allowed one to travel into the future. Perhaps one could see tomorrow’s scenes, or one could really head straight for tomorrow.

However, Zhou Wen knew very well that traveling into the future wasn’t something a Calamity-grade could do, much less a Terror-grade. Zhou Wen didn’t believe that a Terror-grade Void Bird could travel into the future.

Furthermore, when he absorbed the skill, the information transmitted from the skill crystal seemed to indicate that it was a teleportation ability. It left Zhou Wen somewhat puzzled.

Won’t I know once I give it a try??Zhou Wen originally wanted to give it a try, but on second thought, he decided to wait for An Sheng and company to return.

If this skill really allowed him to travel into the future—tomorrow—it remained a question whether he could return and if he could, to which time period.

Suppressing his curiosity, Zhou Wen continued studying Absolute Space. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The problem regarding the movement of the two Absolute Spaces had yet to be resolved. The swapping method via Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping failed to form an effective cycle.

Zhou Wen’s prior battle with Immortal gave him a new idea.

Immortal had used an exchange spell before. It was very similar to Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping, but the target of the exchange was the enemy.

If I can exchange the bullet’s location with one of the Absolute Spaces, will that work??Zhou Wen tried a few times and realized that it was impossible.

The Sky-Stealing Sun-Swapping technique needed a mark first. It was impossible to mark the bullet traveling at the speed of light. At the very least, Zhou Wen definitely couldn’t do it to date.

Since this didn’t work, Zhou Wen had to think of another solution.

Just as he was in the midst of research, his phone rang. Zhou Wen picked it up and realized that it was from Liu Yun.

“Junior, there’s a big deal.” Liu Yun said in his message.

Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to reply to him. He didn’t believe that this fellow would have anything good to offer.

“Someone wants to clear the Venusian dimensional zone and plans on seeking my help and Deceit King’s help. Are you interested?” Liu Yun sent another message.

Zhou Wen continued studying his skills without replying.

“It’s definitely some absolute nouveau riche. As long as Deceit King is willing to take action and can guarantee that his family can enter the rankings, even if it’s just one star, any price is negotiable.” Liu Yun didn’t give up.

Zhou Wen thought to himself that he was already considered a nouveau riche. Even the six families didn’t have as many Terror-grade Companion Beasts as him. No matter how wealthy the family Liu Yun mentioned was, what could they offer that would tempt him?

Getting no response from Zhou Wen, Liu Yun sent another message: “Although the other party isn’t an existence like the six families, he’s still at the level of a local emperor. His status is similar to your family’s An Tianzuo, and he’s even richer. The price he can offer will definitely satisfy you.”

“Have you heard of the Lady Luck Companion Beast? It’s from his place. It’s the only one on Earth. If you can help them get on the rankings, they are willing to use Lady Luck for payment.”

Liu Yun’s last message garnered Zhou Wen’s attention and tempted him.

Zhou Wen had naturally heard of the Lady Luck Companion Beast. Luck-type Companion Beasts were rare to begin with, and Lady Luck was one of the best. She was considered famous, so it was difficult for Zhou Wen not to know.

However, the so-called Lady Luck Companion Beast wasn’t a goddess, but a lucky pixie with transparent wings on its back and a petite body the size of a finger.

The lucky pixie’s companion form was a necklace. The necklace was beautiful, and the pendant was a gorgeous pixie ornament. It looked like an ornament of a goddess, so it was also known as Lady Luck Necklace.

It was said that after wearing the necklace, one could easily find Companion Eggs and crystals if they went out to hunt dimensional creatures. Although it was unknown how much Luck had been added, it was still one of the best Companion Beasts known to add Luck.

There was one thing in the East District which could match the effects of the Lady Luck Necklace. It was said to be called Lucky Star. It was owned by the Zhang family, but no one had really seen what it looked like. It was only rumored that the Zhang family owned such a Companion Beast.

“Is the other party really willing to use the Lady Luck Necklace as payment?” Zhou Wen replied.

“It’s 100% real. I’ve seen the Lady Luck Necklace with my own eyes. It’s worn around that big shot’s neck. He said that as long as you can help them get on the rankings, he will think of a way to transfer the Lady Luck Necklace to you,” Liu Yun immediately replied.

If it’s really the Lady Luck Necklace, that’s very generous. If I obtain that necklace, my Luck points will increase significantly. Perhaps I can obtain a large number of Terror-grade Companion Eggs during my random grinding.?Although Zhou Wen really wanted to obtain the Lady Luck Necklace, unfortunately, he didn’t have the ability to clear the Venusian instance dungeon. He didn’t have the ability to obtain it even if he wanted it.

“I don’t have the means. Get him to find someone else,” Zhou Wen replied.

“If they could find others, they wouldn’t have come looking for us. They really had no choice, so they took the risk to seek our help,” Liu Yun replied.

“What do you mean there’s really no other way? Will they die if they don’t go to the Venusian dimensional zone?” Zhou Wen was somewhat puzzled.

“Not really, but that tycoon made a bet with someone else. He has to be on the rankings in three months. Otherwise, he will kowtow and admit his mistake. Now, that tycoon is almost going crazy. He’s looking for help everywhere.” Liu Yun explained the situation in detail.

Zhou Wen had imagined that someone who had the Lady Luck Necklace was from the West District because the necklace was originally produced there.

However, after hearing Liu Yun’s description, he realized that the person with the Lady Luck Necklace was actually from the East District.

The person’s name was Song Guojia. As the name Song Guojia wasn’t a nice-sounding name, he gave himself the nickname of Lord Fourth.

Zhou Wen had heard of this name before. In a certain area in the East District, the name of Lord Fourth was as terrifying as Luoyang’s An Tianzuo.

Unlike An Tianzuo, Lord Fourth had a good relationship with the six families. Furthermore, he was very popular with people, unlike the An family.

Zhou Wen felt that if he was as rich and generous as Lord Fourth, he would also have friends all over the world.

According to what Zhou Wen knew, there were especially many Companion Beasts like Ginseng Babies produced in the dimensional zones of Lord Fourth. Every one of them cost an astronomical amount. There were also quite a number of similar Companion Beasts that had healing abilities.

Such a healing Companion Beast was in high demand. Even if one couldn’t buy a top-notch one, just getting a random one would do.

Rumors had it that Lord Fourth had a Terror-grade Ginseng Baby. Even a dead person could pull back their soul from Lord Yama if they drank a mouthful of the Ginseng Baby’s blood.
