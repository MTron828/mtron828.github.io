Chapter 749: The Strong Are Respected

Translator: CKtalon

Crack! Crack!

The Guardian armor on Xia Liuchuan’s body cracked. It wasn’t shattering, but the armor was automatically disintegrating.

The black jade-like armor quickly disintegrated from Xia Liuchuan’s body and condensed into a figure in the air.

It was a black jade golem. It looked very strange. It had the appearance of a human, but its body was black jade.

Old Master Xia looked at Xia Liuchuan and said coldly, “In this world, only strength is the eternal truth. The so-called Guardian only wants to protect humans who can make it stronger. I’m far stronger than you, so it abandoned you and chose me. The rules of the world are just that cruel. The strong are respected.”

As Old Master Xia spoke, the black-jade-like Guardian had already transformed into armor again. However, this time, it was on Old Master Xia.

Old Master Xia’s white hair had already turned completely black. Wearing the black jade Guardian armor, he looked even more majestic and heroic. His nose was slightly aquiline, giving him the look of the ruthlessness of an ambitious and ruthless character. It made people fear him.

Without the protection of the black jade armor, Xia Liuchuan’s Essence Energy began to leak out as it was absorbed by the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.

Old Master Xia already had terrifying Essence Energy and vitality. Now, with the power of the black jade armor, his strength was unimaginable. With a punch, Xia Liuchuan only had time to raise his arm to block before he was sent flying. He slammed into the light barrier and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Zhou Wen was still striking the barrier, but he hadn’t blasted it open. When he turned his head and saw this scene, he was somewhat alarmed.

Although I knew that Guardians are unreliable, I never expected them to be so unreliable. It actually betrayed its owner just like that. Thankfully, I didn’t contract a Guardian. Zhou Wen was secretly glad that he didn’t contract with Guardians.

Zhou Wen secretly decided that unless it was a master-slave contract like Demonic Neonate, even if he couldn’t advance to the Mythical stage, he definitely wouldn’t contract a Guardian.

Now, there was no time for Zhou Wen to think too much. Xia Liuchuan was already at his limits. If he didn’t leave, he would only be able to fight Old Sicko Xia in the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array. Fighting him here would be too disadvantageous.

However, the barrier was too hard. The power of the Demon Dragon True Body couldn’t blast it open in a short period of time. By the time he blasted it open, Old Sicko Xia would have already charged over.

Suddenly, Zhou Wen thought of an idea. Although he didn’t know if it would work, he had to give it a try.

Looking at Xia Xuanyue, who had expended all her Essence Energy and was losing her essence, vitality, and spirit, Zhou Wen switched to the Dao Sutra and summoned the Heaven-Opening Scripture of the Highest Elder to protect himself and Xia Xuanyue. Then, he hugged the log to his waist and slammed it into the light barrier of the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.

I’ve carried you for so long. If you don’t give me some help, I’m going to die here, Zhou Wen thought as the log slammed into the barrier.

Zhou Wen originally wanted to try using the heavy mass of the log to aid him, but to his surprise, he heard a loud thud.

The entire Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array’s barrier shattered like glass. It stopped operating as the golden runes beneath dimmed.

Everyone was stunned as Old Master Xia gave up on attacking Xia Liuchuan. He turned his head and looked at Zhou Wen, staring at the log in his arms with a puzzled look.

Xia Xuanyue, who was sitting beside him, looked at Zhou Wen with a look of surprise. She never expected Zhou Wen to crack the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array.

Zhou Wen never expected the log to be so powerful. If he had known this would happen, he would have long cracked open the Heaven and Earth Origin-Returning Array. He wouldn’t have needed to wait until now.

However, Zhou Wen didn’t waste any time being dazed. He ran towards the Hall of Supreme Harmony with the log in hand.

Old Master Xia’s figure moved as he attempted to stop Zhou Wen. Although he didn’t know what Zhou Wen was up to, he didn’t think it was anything good, nor did he wish for anything to happen. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Just as he moved, he saw a sword beam stab at him. Old Master Xia dodged slightly and the Evil-Slaying Sword flew past his face. Xia Liuchuan held the Pure Hook Sword with both hands and cleaved down from behind.

Old Master Xia snorted and flicked the Pure Hook Sword with his finger, sending it flying.

Xia Liuchuan’s figure appeared beside the Evil-Slaying Sword that had already flown over. He held onto the Evil-Slaying Sword and slashed at Old Master Xia’s neck.

“I told you, I taught you everything. Your tricks are useless against me.” Old Master Xia seemed to have expected Xia Liuchuan to appear there and punched him in the abdomen.

This punch carried unparalleled power. If one was hit, even a steel castle would be blasted open, much less a person. It was evident that Old Master Xia really wanted to kill Xia Liuchuan.

However, Xia Liuchuan’s person disappeared again. Old Master Xia’s fist missed again.

Clang!

A sword stabbed into Old Master Xia’s back. It was the ancient sword that Xia Xuanyue used. At that moment, Xia Liuchuan held it in his hand and pierced through Old Master Xia’s black jade armor.

“Very good... Really good... I never expected your Sword Warp technique to reach such a stage. You can use the sword of others to warp. From the looks of it, you never planned on following my orders to kill Zhou Wen from the beginning...” Old Master Xia lowered his head as his eyes turned terrifying. Without turning around, he enunciated each word with a heavy tone.

The ancient sword had penetrated three inches in and the sword beam erupted like a volcano. However, no matter how Xia Liuchuan exerted his strength, he was unable to move the sword tip any further.

Old Master Xia’s figure suddenly turned blurry and vanished in front of Xia Liuchuan as though he had teleported. Xia Liuchuan cursed silently and used Sword Warp. When he appeared again, he was already beside the Evil-Slaying Sword.

However, just as Xia Liuchuan appeared, Old Master Xia appeared beside the Evil-Slaying Sword and punched him to the ground.

Boom!

Xia Liuchuan’s body slammed heavily to the ground, creating a huge crater. Blood spewed out of his mouth as countless bones fractured.

“Brother!” Xia Xuanyue struggled to stand up and wanted to rush over.

“Don’t come over... Leave quickly...” Xia Liuchuan gritted his teeth and shouted. At the same time, he used Sword Warp with all his might again. When he arrived beside the Pure Hook Sword, his body clearly staggered, but his grip on the sword remained immensely firm.

However, the moment he held the Pure Hook Sword, Old Master Xia had already appeared in front of him. Without waiting for Xia Liuchuan to swing his sword, his fists had already struck Xia Liuchuan’s chest at an indiscernible speed. Xia Liuchuan vomited blood and his sternum collapsed.
