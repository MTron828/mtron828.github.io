Chapter 741: Duel

Translator: CKtalon

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t discouraged. Instead, he felt that this might be an opportunity.

With this Guardian around, it was equivalent to having another spatial expert as a sparring partner. Perhaps there was a chance to improve Lost Country.

Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive and once again entered the game to challenge the Guardian. He naturally suffered a crushing defeat, but Zhou Wen also sensed the influence the other party’s spatial powers had on him.

Through watching and personally experiencing the various spatial-type skills of the Guardian, Zhou Wen gained a lot more insight into spatial-type skills. No matter how much he had studied in the past, it was only theoretical knowledge. It was very rare to have such an opportunity to experience it.

...

While Zhou Wen was repeatedly dying from gaming, Xia Liuchuan came to the East Courtyard again and mentioned the battle he had scheduled with Zhou Wen on the peak of Forbidden City.

“You should know that Forbidden City is a forbidden zone of our Xia family. Outsiders are not allowed to enter,” said Old Master Xia.

“I know, but I also wish to fight him there.” Xia Liuchuan didn’t explain much.

“In that case, so be it. However, defeat is not an option. No matter what, Zhou Wen can’t leave Forbidden City again,” said Old Master Xia indifferently.

Xia Liuchuan didn’t say anything and just bowed slightly.

“Let’s set it to be in four days. There are still problems in Forbidden City that need handling. You should head back and prepare for now,” Old Master Xia said.

...

Zhou Wen was grinding when he suddenly heard his phone ring. It was none other than Wang Lu.

“You really agreed to battle Xia Liuchuan?” Zhou Wen heard Wang Lu’s voice the moment he picked up the phone.

“Yes,” Zhou Wen replied.

“To battle a Xia family member in the Imperial Capital, and in the Forbidden City which they control? Are you ignoring what Grandma said to you?” Wang Lu said anxiously.

“Don’t worry. I have my own plans. Nothing will go wrong... Alright, let’s just end it here. I have a call coming in. I’ll answer it first...” Zhou Wen picked up the other call as he spoke. It was from Ouyang Lan.

“Little Wen, did you really agree to a duel with Xia Liuchuan in Forbidden City? Don’t be afraid. If you were forced by the Xia family, I’ll be able to help you,” Ouyang Lan said.

“Sis Lan, the Xia family didn’t force me. I did it willingly. Don’t worry. I can handle it.” Zhou Wen felt touched when he heard Ouyang Lan.

Although they were not related by blood, Ouyang Lan was indeed very concerned about him.

“Little Wen, your father only has you as a son. We won’t be able to have children in the future. You need to think twice before doing everything. Don’t risk your life. Tell me if there are any problems. I’ll help you resolve them.” Ouyang Lan didn’t quite believe Zhou Wen. She remained very worried.

“Sis Lan, there’s really no need for you to worry. It’s not convenient to speak on the phone. However, I have the ability to protect myself. Nothing will go wrong.” Zhou Wen was afraid that his phone was bugged, so he didn’t dare inform Ouyang Lan about his possession of the Invisibility Cloak.

Ouyang Lan pleaded with Zhou Wen a few more times before his phone rang, bringing an end to his phone call with Ouyang Lan.

It was An Sheng. He was clearly aware that Zhou Wen was going to duel with Xia Liuchuan. However, he didn’t persuade Zhou Wen not to fight.

“I’m already on my way to the Imperial Capital. Is there anything I need to do in advance?” An Sheng said simply.

“Don’t come. I’m leaving the Imperial Capital soon,” Zhou Wen hurriedly said.

“I’ll wait for you outside the Imperial Capital,” An Sheng said.

“Don’t do it near the Imperial Capital. Let’s have it somewhere far away.” Zhou Wen knew that he couldn’t stop An Sheng.

“Alright, I’ll think of a way to inform you when the time comes.” An Sheng hung up after saying that.

...

This news quickly spread in the Imperial Capital. Anyone who was in the know felt that Zhou Wen was courting death.

Ignoring the fact that Xia Liuchuan was a rare genius in the Xia family, just the fact that he was dueling someone from the Xia family in their territory made people place their bets against Zhou Wen.

Dugu Ge and Zhang Chunqiu were in the Imperial Capital, so they naturally heard the news.

“This battle will give us a perfect opportunity to see how much strength that Guardian raised Loser has,” Zhang Chunqiu said with a smile.

“It looks like your divination wasn’t accurate at all. You actually let Xia Liuchuan get the Guardian,” said Dugu Ge.

Zhang Chunqiu smiled and said, “Destiny is unpredictable. Don’t take my divinations seriously. I’m just spouting nonsense.”

“Then do some more divinations. Who will win in the duel between Zhou Wen and Loser?” Dugu Ge said.

“Based on my divination, the Xia family will definitely not lose,” Zhang Chunqiu said. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Dugu Ge glanced at Zhang Chunqiu in contempt before returning to his room.

Zhou Wen had already received Xia Liuchuan’s notice to fight in Forbidden City in four days. However, only Zhou Wen was allowed to enter.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to contact Wang Lu, hoping to leave the antelope and chick with her.

“You hung up so quickly just now. Why am I in your sights again?” Wang Lu said angrily.

“It was my stepmother. Do you think I could reject her call?” Zhou Wen consoled.

“Zhou Wen, you know about the Xia family. You really shouldn’t have agreed to the duel with Xia Liuchuan. Xia Liuchuan might not be famous and his fame might not be comparable to the younger generation’s John and Lance, but this person is definitely much more terrifying than Lance. He’s someone who has truly survived countless life-and-death situations. He’s different from those elites who were brought up in safe environments.”

Wang Lu continued, “Although Xia Liuchuan is known as the most profligate scion of the Xia family, his talent and social connection aren’t inferior to An Tianzuo’s. My grandmother met him when he was six. Back then, Old Master Xia took him to the Ancient Sword Tomb to play. At that time, a Mythical sword happened to appear. Xia Liuchuan, who was only six years old, saw the battle between the Mythical sword and humans and actually comprehended a Mythical sword technique. His talent in combat is terrifying.”

“If he’s not strong, it would be meaningless,” Zhou Wen said with a smile. He just didn’t want Wang Lu to be too worried.

“If it were anywhere else, it wouldn’t be a problem for you to fight Xia Liuchuan. However, that’s Forbidden City. How can you fight Xia Liuchuan there? Even if you defeat him, it will be difficult for you to walk out,” Wang Lu sighed.

“Don’t worry. If I, Zhou Wen, want to leave, no one in the Federation can stop me,” Zhou Wen said with certainty.

Wang Lu knew that it was too late to say anything now. Zhou Wen had already accepted the challenge, so it was too late for regrets.

Four days quickly passed. The Xia family took the initiative to send a car to pick Zhou Wen up, but Zhou Wen rejected them. He carried the wooden log and walked towards Forbidden City.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to take the car, but the car couldn’t fit the log.
