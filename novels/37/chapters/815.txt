Chapter 816: Getting Accustomed to Death After Plenty of Deaths

Translator: CKtalon

After a while, Zhang Yuzhi unexpectedly sent a message: “Don’t you know the origins of the Mystic Bird?”

“I only know that it’s your Hero King’s Companion Beast,” Zhou Wen replied.

“Isn’t your hometown in Guide City? You don’t even know about the Mystic Bird?” Zhang Yuzhi was somewhat surprised.

“What’s so strange about that? Could it be that the Mystic Bird Companion Egg was obtained in Guide City?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise.

“The Mystic Bird was in Guide Ancient City,” Zhang Yuzhi said.

“Impossible,” Zhou Wen immediately replied. Guide Ancient City was called Ancient Sovereign City in-game. He had grinded it countless times in the past, but there were no Mythical creatures inside, much less the Mystic Bird.

“How is that impossible? Do you know that the Mystic Bird is a divine bird that represents merchants? And Guide City has a place called Three Merchants. If the Mystic Bird doesn’t appear in Guide Ancient City, where else can it appear?” Zhang Yuzhi asked.

Zhou Wen was taken aback when he heard that. He had forgotten about it.

The Mystic Bird was indeed the divine patron of merchants. Legend had it that it was born into merchants. The merchants had always considered themselves to be the descendants of the Mystic Bird, but Zhou Wen didn’t associate it with the Zhang family’s Mystic Bird.

“But I’ve almost swept Guide Ancient City clean. There’s no Mystic Bird at all. Forgetting the Mystic Bird, there’s not even an ordinary Mythical creature,” Zhou Wen replied.

Zhou Wen naturally knew what was inside Guide Ancient City. It was impossible for him to be mistaken.

“I heard it from my elders. Back then, my great-grandfather, who is also the Hero King you mentioned, passed by Guide Ancient City. On a whim, he brought his wife through Guide Ancient City. In the end, he saw a black divine bird in a place called Fire God Platform. My great-grandfather killed the divine bird with great difficulty and obtained the Mystic Bird Companion Beast. As a result, it has been passed down... However, I heard that after that, no one saw the Mystic Bird appear in Guide Ancient City again. Later on, the Zhang family went to look for it and they couldn’t find it,” Zhang Yuzhi explained.

“Isn’t that equivalent to having none?” Zhou Wen was helpless.

“Why are you asking this? Don’t tell me you have designs on our Mystic Bird?” Zhang Yuzhi joked.

“Companion Beasts can’t be traded. It’s useless even if I have designs on it,” Zhou Wen replied.

“That means you really want the Mystic Bird. What do you want it for?” Zhang Yuzhi asked.

“The Mystic Bird’s teleportation ability is amazing. I just want to use it as a mount. It can save my life at critical moments. As you know, there are quite a number of people who want my life, especially the people from the bureau. I have to be wary.” Zhou Wen found an excuse.

“Then I can’t help you. You can try your luck at Guide Ancient City. Perhaps if you are lucky, another Mystic Bird will appear? However, even if a Mystic Bird appears, how are you going to kill it? Its teleportation ability is too powerful. No matter how fast your saber is, you probably won’t be able to touch it.”

“There’s no need to try my luck. It definitely doesn’t exist. I’ll think of another way.” Zhou Wen changed the topic. “Do you have any plans to come out for a walk soon? You can come visit Luoyang.”

“I can’t come out.” There was nothing from Zhang Yuzhi after her reply.

Zhou Wen sent a few more messages to her, but she didn’t reply.

The Zhang family’s Mystic Bird was actually produced from Guide Ancient City. Could it be that Guide Ancient City is really extraordinary? Zhou Wen thought of the stone saber on the Fire God Platform.

The Mystic Bird was also discovered on Fire God Platform. The stone saber was also on Fire God Platform. If he pulled out the stone saber and completely unsealed Ancient Sovereign City, it was unknown if a dimensional creature like the Mystic Bird would appear.

Zhou Wen was tempted and wanted to draw the saber.

However, after some thought, he realized that Guide City didn’t have many experts to begin with. If something really happened after he pulled out the stone saber, there would be tens of thousands of deaths.

From the looks of it, it’s impossible to obtain the Mystic Bird Companion Beast. I can only use Plan B. Zhou Wen still had another method, but it was even more unreliable. He did not know if it would work.

Teleportation was actually a type of spatial teleportation. In theory, the Bright Torch Vision World was also a type of spatial teleportation that transported what Torch Dragon saw into its vision world.

However, being teleported into the Vision World meant death, so no one was willing to be teleported in.

Zhou Wen’s solution was to use the blood-colored avatar’s death as a way to get the blood-colored avatar to experience teleportation with Torch Dragon’s Bright Torch Vision World.

After entering the game, Zhou Wen couldn’t be bothered to run to the Torch Dragon temple. He summoned Torch Dragon Youngling and got it to use Bright Torch Vision World to look at the blood-colored avatar. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In one look, the game screen immediately turned black.

Zhou Wen dripped his blood to revive and got Torch Dragon Youngling to kill the blood-colored avatar wearing the Lost Country ring again and again. Zhou Wen didn’t know how much blood he used.

He could sense that the Lost Country ring was growing, but its growth speed was much slower than teleportation. At this speed, it was probably impossible for it to evolve without at least a thousand tries. It might even require tens of thousands of deaths.

Thankfully, the Chaos Egg had the healing ability. Otherwise, Zhou Wen would be worried if he had enough blood.

Zhou Wen kept courting death in his dorm the entire time. He was already numb to death, but the effects were terrible. A single teleportation could raise Lost Country’s stats equivalent to dozens of Bright Torch Vision World deaths.

How nice would it be if I had the Mystic Bird! Why isn’t there a Mystic Bird in Ancient Sovereign City? Zhou Wen was rather depressed.

Now, Zhou Wen had a deep understanding of how difficult it was for humans to advance to the Mythical stage.

It was impossible for an ordinary person to cultivate eight Essence Energy Arts at the same time, and it was impossible for them to raise all four basic stats to 41. This also prevented them from advancing to the Mythical stage.

Even if one could cultivate eight Essence Energy Arts at the same time, the cultivation methods of the Essence Energy Arts were different. Without the help of the mysterious phone, it was equally difficult to master them.

For instance, Chaos Egg needed constant injuries. In the event an ordinary person died accidentally, there was no point in cultivating.

The advancement of Slaughterer was even better. Was killing a Guardian something an ordinary person could do? Even with a Mythical pet, killing a Guardian was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.

Unless I’m like Xia Jiuhuang and forcefully plunder the talent bloodlines of others for my own use, it’s too difficult for humans to advance to the Mythical stage. Zhou Wen felt a headache when he thought of the few Essence Energy Arts he needed to cultivate.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen didn’t have a complete set of Essence Energy Arts. He had complete Essence Energy Arts for Speed and Essence Energy. There was the Demon God Catalog of an unknown attribute. As it was difficult to determine its corresponding attribute, Zhou Wen didn’t plan on cultivating it for the time being.

If the Demon God Catalog added Strength and Constitution, he was still lacking at least one Essence Energy Art.

He got used to the deaths after repeatedly dying. Zhou Wen was somewhat numb to it anyway. All he wanted now was to quickly advance Lost Country.
