Chapter 933: Unexpected Advancement

It was unknown where this scallop came from, but it was able to make a terrifying expert like the snake monster retreat. It seemed to be very powerful.

However, Zhou Wen had seen the blue light it spewed out. It didn’t seem as powerful as he had imagined. The blue light wasn’t fast, nor did he see any astonishing might. He didn’t know why the snake monster would take the initiative to retreat. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Now that Zhou Wen was running for his life, he wasn’t in the mood to study the scallop’s abilities, nor did he wish to cause trouble.

The scallop remained silently on the sand without being alarmed by Zhou Wen’s arrival. Apart from attacking the snake monster, it hadn’t attacked any other dimensional creatures.

Zhou Wen saw a Fiend Claw Fish swim past it, but it didn’t react.

As he was sizing up the scallop, void lightning appeared not far away. The dimensional creatures that were struck by the void lightning vanished just like the dimensional creatures in the volcanic zone.

If the void lightning is really a spatial rift that leads to Earth’s dimensional zone, can I leave through that? Zhou Wen had similar thoughts before, but he couldn’t give it a try. If he made a wrong guess or if a human’s body couldn’t withstand the power of the void lightning, he would be doomed.

Just as Zhou Wen was pondering over it, he heard the ice maiden’s voice ring out on the surface of the sea. “If you want to live, we can have a chat. Hand over the Nine-Tailed Fox core and I can spare your life. You have to consider carefully. In three hours, I’ll leave this place. When the time comes, there will be no way out. You won’t be able to return to Earth or enter the dimension. You can only be trapped here til death.”

So she wants the pearl lent to me by the Nine-Tailed Fox, but it might be an excuse to lure me out and kill me. Zhou Wen didn’t move.

“You better believe me. Not many dimensional experts can even enter this place. No one will come here for tens of thousands of years. You only have three hours left. If you still want to live, come to the castle and find me.” With that said, the ice maiden returned to the ice castle.

Zhou Wen originally suspected that the ice maiden was luring him out, but he later realized that she had really left.

Zhou Wen secretly sneaked to the vicinity of the ice castle and saw that there was no movement inside. As for the ice maiden, she was indeed inside. It looked like she really had no intention of looking for him.

If the ice maiden could really take him back to the volcanic area, Zhou Wen was willing to give her the Nine-Tailed Fox’s pearl. After all, nothing was more important than his life.

The problem was that no one knew if the ice maiden would really keep her promise.

After some thought, Zhou Wen couldn’t make up his mind. It was mainly because he didn’t have the ability to fight a Terror-grade entity. If he entered the ice castle, he would be at her mercy. It was equivalent to handing his life to someone else.

After circling the nearby sea, this place seemed to be an endless sea. It was as if there was nothing else in the world other than the sea.

I wonder if this place is connected to the volcanic area. Even if it is, I reckon that when I rush back, the time limit of thirty-six hours would have already passed. As Zhou Wen was thinking, he passed by the scallop.

Strange, why is it still here? Zhou Wen looked at the scallop in surprise.

Previously, void lightning had already swept through this area. The other dimensional creatures had vanished in the void lightning, but the scallop remained. It was clearly abnormal.

From the looks of it, this scallop is indeed extraordinary. Zhou Wen had the intention of studying its abilities, but this was reality, so he didn’t act rashly.

After some thought, Zhou Wen attempted to use the Eyes of Legacy to scan the scallop. He wanted to see if he could transform into it. As long as he could transform into it, he would know what abilities it had.

The Eyes of Legacy looked at the sapphire-like scallop. His mirror-like eyes reflected its appearance.

The scallop remained motionless, allowing Zhou Wen to heave a sigh of relief.

Large amounts of Essence Energy surged into his eyes. The amount of Essence Energy needed to simulate the scallop left Zhou Wen somewhat alarmed. This was about the same as when Zhou Wen scanned Torch Dragon Youngling.

After scanning for a while, he still couldn’t transform. There was too much information contained in the scallop.

Zhou Wen’s Essence Energy was about to be depleted. He failed to transform into the scallop, but the Eyes of Legacy began to evolve after copying so much information.

It can’t be... It evolved so easily... Zhou Wen still found it unbelievable. This advancement to a Perfect Body was too sudden.

At the same time, Zhou Wen was extremely delighted. The advancement of the Eyes of Legacy to a Perfect Body meant that his Constitution’s two Life Souls had reached a Perfect Body. His Constitution was finally reaching 41.

There were several Mythical Essence Energy Skills that he couldn’t cultivate in the past. He could try them now.

With the transformation of the Eyes of Legacy, Zhou Wen felt a mysterious energy spread to other parts of his body. As the blood flowed through his body, it caused a shocking change.

...

The ice maiden placed the Heaven Shrouding Bell back in the ice castle hall and waited for Zhou Wen’s arrival.

She wasn’t lying to Zhou Wen. According to the plan, she had to leave within three hours. And she had relied on the Heaven Shrouding Bell’s strength to come here.

Once she left, she didn’t know when she would return again. It was normal for no one to step foot in such a place for tens of thousands of years.

The dimensional creatures here might be treasures to humans, but to dimensional creatures, they were too weak. They were products of Earth’s civilizations.

Looking at the time, it was less than fifteen minutes to the deadline to leave, but there was still no sign of Zhou Wen.

“It looks like he won’t come. What a pity. If I can obtain the Nine-Tailed Fox core, I can spare his life,” the ice maiden muttered.

Suddenly, the ice maiden stood up and looked outside the ice castle. She saw Zhou Wen fly over from the distant sky and arrive in front of the ice castle’s door.

“You’re finally here?” The ice maiden walked out of the hall and stood on the ice steps outside. She looked at Zhou Wen and said, “There are only a few minutes left. You’ve finally made a wise decision. Leave the Fox core to me, and I’ll take you out.”

Zhou Wen looked at the ice maiden and said, “I don’t plan on giving you anything. Not to mention the fox core, I won’t even give you a Black Chicken White Phoenix Pill.”

“So you want to die of old age here?” The ice maiden said expressionlessly.

“Of course not. I’ll leave with you,” Zhou Wen said.

The ice maiden said disdainfully, “Do you think I’ll take you out if you don’t hand over the fox core?”

“Of course. It’s not up to you to disagree,” Zhou Wen said.
