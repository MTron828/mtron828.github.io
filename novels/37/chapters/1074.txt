Chapter 1075: True Terror Grade

Translator: CKtalon

“As a Guardian, you should know your mission,” the figure said as it looked down at the log in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

“My mission has long ended. Don’t you already have a new Guardian? Why are you still looking for me?” The woman in the log snorted coldly.

“It hasn’t been long since the new Guardian came into existence. It hasn’t grown to a sufficiently strong stage. It’s not enough to vie for first place,” said the figure.

“What has that got to do with me?” The woman’s voice was cold and heartless.

“If you defeat Ya, you can return to the dimension and obtain a good status,” the figure said.

The woman suddenly laughed, her laughter filled with mockery. “Aren’t you all known to be omnipotent high-level lifeforms? Can’t you even deal with a fellow who’s half human and half Guardian?”

“After you return to the dimension, you can dominate a region.” There was no change in the figure’s voice.

“Not interested,” the woman said without hesitation.

“A divine fruit,” the figure continued.

“Keep it for yourself,” the woman mocked.

“Ten.” The figure remained emotionless.

“Are you that afraid of Ya getting first place?” The woman didn’t reject his offer immediately this time.

“He’s not a Guardian. There’s already one Wang Mingyuan. There’s no need for a second or third one. The Lord of Earth has to be a Guardian,” the figure said.

“The King of Earth can’t even have half a human’s bloodline? How ironic. Humans are the original owners of Earth.”

“What can make you take action?” asked the figure.

“I haven’t found a suitable contractor. I don’t plan on taking action.” The woman actually rejected the figure again.

“You aren’t the only Guardian who survived that era. If they were to obtain ten divine fruits, you should know what that will imply.” There was finally some emotion in the figure’s voice. One could clearly sense that his tone had turned cold.

“So what if I know?” the woman said indifferently.

“As long as you defeat an ordinary Mythical creature, you can obtain ten divine fruits. It’s impossible for such a good thing to happen a second time. Don’t regret it.” The figure regained its calm.

“Nothing can make me, Empress Polestar, regret it,” the woman said.

The figure didn’t say anything else as it gradually vanished into the void. Finally, it completely vanished.

After Empress Polestar sensed that the light figure had vanished, she muttered to herself, “An ordinary Mythical? I’m afraid it’s not that simple. Otherwise, why would you come looking for me?”

...

On the Moon, Zhou Wen was sitting in front of a huge cube.

After saving Wei Ge, Zhou Wen had originally planned on punishing Shen Yuchi, but Wei Ge convinced him otherwise.

In fact, Wei Ge didn’t say much. All he did was tell Zhou Wen, “Leave him alive. With me around, the bureau will be your eyes and ears in the future.”

With Wei Ge’s words, Zhou Wen didn’t seek trouble with Shen Yuchi again. He got the Great Might Vajra Bull to take Wei Ge back to the spacecraft while he remained on the Moon.

Zhou Wen had originally planned on using Glimmer to teleport back. He didn’t need to take the spacecraft back, so he got Wei Ge to return with them.

As for how Wei Ge would subdue Shen Yuchi and the bureau, Zhou Wen didn’t wish to know. Even if Wei Ge didn’t succeed, Zhou Wen already had the strength necessary to destroy the bureau at any time.

However, before returning to Earth, Zhou Wen still wanted to obtain more petals of the Tree of Immortality.

However, the Moon Goddess had told him that the Tree of Immortality was severely injured. It was best not to pluck its petals and wait for it to recover.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to pick up the petals that had fallen nearby. He didn’t touch the petals on the tree again. He knew the principle of economizing to ensure long-term benefits. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After touring the Moon, he realized that there was a cube here. Zhou Wen watched several battles here, all between Ya and the Guardian.

A battle at this level can’t even withstand a single breath from my Little Fairy. Every time Zhou Wen made a comparison, he felt that Banana Fairy was much stronger. Typical Mythical and Terror-grade creatures couldn’t compare.

Banana Fairy: Terror (Evolvable)

Life Providence: Yin Yang Spirit Root

Life Soul: Fairy in the Wind

Wheel of Destiny: Three Realms’ Best Wind

Terror form: Apeiron Perfected Immortal (S-grade)

Strength: 82

Speed: 82

Constitution: 82

Essence Energy: 82

Talent Skill: Supreme Yin Wind, Supreme Yang Wind, Immeasurable Wind.

Companion Form: Fan

Banana Fairy’s evolution was very strange. This was because ordinary creatures wouldn’t change their Life Providences or Life Souls. However, with Banana Fairy’s evolution, even her Life Soul and Life Providences had changed. This was a phenomenon Zhou Wen had never seen before.

Furthermore, she was different from Demonic Neonate. Demonic Neonate was still at the Mythical stage, but she had the ability to transform into a Terror form. Zhou Wen originally believed that the Terror grade was only a state of the Mythical stage.

However, from the looks of it, above the Mythical stage was the Terror grade, not just a state. Banana Fairy was a true Terror grade. Demonic Neonate hadn’t truly reached the Terror grade, but for some reason, she had the ability to transform into a Terror form.

Zhou Wen guessed that it had something to do with her Wheel of Destiny, but he couldn’t be sure.

Then there was Banana Fairy’s stats. Although she had broken through the limits of the Mythical stage of 81 points, she didn’t directly reach a certain value like before. All her stats had only increased by a little.

Zhou Wen suspected that after achieving the Terror grade, Banana Fairy might need to slowly raise her stats like humans. As for the limit of the Terror grade, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure.

According to the previous standards, the limit should be double the previous stage, but this was only speculation.

As for how powerful Banana Fairy’s Terror Transformation ability was, Zhou Wen had no idea. This was because once Banana Fairy completely transformed into her Terror form, even Zhou Wen—as her master—couldn’t see her.

The only thing he was certain of was that Banana Fairy was very strong.

As he was pondering over it, he saw the cube light up again. Another Guardian had challenged Ya. However, the name that challenged Ya this time made Zhou Wen’s pupils involuntarily contract.

Night Thearch... He has finally joined the battle... Zhou Wen was somewhat worried. Zhong Ziya might not know that Night Thearch was at the Terror grade. If Zhong Ziya ended up trapped in Night Thearch’s Evernight domain without being aware of it, he might end up being killed without even having the chance to surrender.

After all, only the Terror grade could defeat the Terror grade. Zhong Ziya and Primordial Sword Immortal had yet to reach the Terror grade.

Zhong Ziya quickly accepted the challenge, making Zhou Wen even more worried. From the looks of it, Zhong Ziya likely didn’t know of Night Thearch’s existence.

Night Thearch entered the cube’s arena and stood in midair as he stared at Zhong Ziya and said, “I don’t want to kill you, so you should admit defeat yourself.”

Zhong Ziya looked up at Night Thearch. No one could see his expression behind the mask, but Zhong Ziya’s words made Zhou Wen secretly heave a sigh of relief.

“I’m more interested to know how strong the Terror grade is.” Zhong Ziya slowly pulled out Primordial Immortal Sword.
