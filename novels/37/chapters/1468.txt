Chapter 1469 Two Versions of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra

Zhou Wen watched the humanoid monster demonstrate. Although the humanoid monster’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra was different from his, the other party’s realm and level were much higher than his. He could draw some experience from him.

Zhou Wen realized that something was amiss after watching for some time. Although the humanoid monster’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra was indeed very powerful and high-level, it was too different from Zhou Wen’s Ancient Sovereign Sutra. There wasn’t much point in referencing it. “Excuse me…” Zhou Wen wanted to ask the question on his mind.

“Don’t speak. Engrave every word I say firmly in your soul. These are the fruits of labor earned from the sacrifices of generations of human sages. You have to pass it down. It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand it. Just remember it…” The humanoid monster’s expression was solemn as he continued demonstrating the Ancient Sovereign Sutra.

Zhou Wen had no choice but to continue listening as he thought to himself, Even if it’s useless for me, I can find a human to inherit this Essence Energy Art in the future.

Towards the end of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s demonstration, the aura of the humanoid creature was so powerful that it nearly broke through the firmaments.

This was thankfully a dimensional zone. If they were outside, it would probably quake areas thousands of kilometers away.

Zhou Wen, however, vaguely felt that with the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s demonstration, the aura of the humanoid creature gradually began to turn odd. If it was purely the Ancient Sovereign’s aura in the beginning, it was almost impossible to tell if he was a human or a dimensional creature. The dimensional creature’s aura became more and more obvious with time.

The humanoid creature finally finished demonstrating the Ancient Sovereign Sutra and stopped. The aura from his body continued surging like a stormy sea.

“Have you memorized it? There’s not much time left. If there’s anything you can’t remember, quickly ask.” The humanoid creature seemed to be enduring some pain as his voice trembled.

“I’ve memorized it, but I have an important question to ask,” Zhou Wen said as he switched his Essence Energy Art to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to prevent the humanoid creature from interrupting him again.

The sun-like Ancient Sovereign appeared in front of Zhou Wen before he asked, “I’ve also cultivated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra on the stone monument, but the path I took later was somewhat different from what you demonstrated. It’s even at odds with yours. Can you tell me why?”.

The humanoid monster wanted to interrupt him when he heard the first half of the sentence, hoping to finish explaining everything as soon as possible.

However, his eyes widened as he lost control of his emotions and cried out when he saw the Human Sovereign projection that Zhou Wen had summoned. “How is this possible? You managed to raise the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to the Terror grade? But I can’t sense any dimensional power from you. That’s impossible!”

Sovereign Sutra was actually simulated in the beginning. As long as he didn’t switch to the Ancient Sovereign Sutra, he wouldn’t possess the aura of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. Although the humanoid monster had cultivated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to an extremely high realm, he still couldn’t sense it.

He couldn’t believe it when he suddenly saw Zhou Wen summon the Human Sovereign projection.

“Yes, it hasn’t been long since my Ancient Sovereign Sutra advanced to the Terror grade, but there’s a problem with it. Anyone injured by the power of the Ancient Sovereign Sutra will rapidly recover from their injuries. Even an ant can’t be killed. Is there any way to resolve this problem?” Zhou Wen had always found the Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s characteristic depressing. The Ancient Sovereign Sutra’s augmentation of strength was potent, but it couldn’t kill anyone. It was useless no matter how much it strengthened him.

The humanoid monster looked at Zhou Wen with an ambivalent look. He was clearly the monster, but now, he looked at Zhou Wen like he was looking at a monster.

“Are humans nowadays like you? How many people have mastered the Ancient Sovereign Sutra? How many have relied on the Ancient Sovereign Sutra to break through the limits of

with a complicated expression.

“I’ve never heard of anyone. Perhaps there might be some, but I don’t know of them.” Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if anyone else had cultivated the Ancient Sovereign Sutra. The stone monument was sitting right there after all. Anyone could see it. Perhaps someone had mastered it.

“In other words, you learned the Ancient Sovereign Sutra completely independently. No one guided you to reach basic mastery?” the humanoid monster asked again. “No.” Zhou Wen thought for a moment and said, “Is there a problem? Could it be that my Ancient Sovereign Sutra can’t injure others because I’ve cultivated it wrongly?” The humanoid monster said with a strange expression, “The ancient Human Sovereign is the sovereign of humanity. Every Human Sovereign is the sovereign that humanity pins its hopes on, and they are willing to sacrifice everything for humanity. Every Human Sovereign has the determination to sacrifice themselves to achieve righteousness. What they want is not to kill, but to let humanity live.”

With that said, the humanoid monster sighed softly. “However, this path isn’t feasible. Even the sovereigns of humanity like Suirenshi and Shennong, who had risked everything for humans, were unable to break through the limits of the Deva Realm. In the end, they had no choice but to sacrifice themselves to transform into a devil and seek other paths. That’s how I have the Ancient Sovereign Sutra I cultivate now.”

The humanoid monster gave Zhou Wen and Human Sovereign a deep look before sighing. “If I had known that someone could cultivate the Ancient Sovereign Sutra with a pure human body, I wouldn’t have taken so many detours.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s not right. Since they are the sovereigns of humanity, they have to lead the human race to fight foreign enemies. If they can’t kill the enemy, wouldn’t the Ancient Sovereign Sutra be mostly crippled?” Zhou Wen still felt that the Ancient Sovereign Sutra he cultivated was somewhat problematic.

“Sovereigns are different from emperors. Emperors kill, but sovereigns subdue the enemy without fighting. Killing is just a temporary solution, a highly ineffective plan. If one can really make the opponent submit and be used, wouldn’t that be a boon? Rearing livestock and planting food are all ways to turn enemies into friends. They are many times stronger than the person who only knows how to kill. How can they be on the same level?

“Wrong… It’s all wrong… I never expected that the efforts of generations of people, who even

have taken the wrong path…” The humanoid monster’s voice gradually became strange. It was as though he had gradually lost his feelings and had become cold and heartless.

“GO… Live on with your Ancient Sovereign Sutra… I’m almost unable to control this body… Remember the three things I said… If you can’t do it… Don’t ever return to Ancient Sovereign City… Find someone suitable to pass on the Ancient Sovereign Sutra… until someone can do it… Then, let him return to Ancient Sovereign City…” The humanoid monster’s eyes became more and more ferocious as though he had changed into a different person.

Although Zhou Wen still had many questions to ask, he could tell that the humanoid monster was about to lose control. The Heaven Shrouding Bell’s isolation ability couldn’t help the humanoid monster resist the control of some force.

“Farewell!” Zhou Wen didn’t dare hesitate. He wasn’t the humanoid monster’s match, so he could only escape.

At the instant Zhou Wen unsummoned Demonic Neonate and the Soul Mirror, the humanoid monster completely lost control and vanished. Thankfully, Zhou Wen had already instant transmitted with Spacetime Bandit. As he unsummoned his Companion Beasts, he rushed out of Guide City.

The interior and exterior of the city were almost two different worlds. Large numbers of skeleton creatures constantly crawled out of the moat outside the city. There was no lack of Mythical creatures among them.

Zhou Wen used the Minor Heavenly Cycle Killing Formation to clean up the nearby skeleton creatures. When he arrived at an uninhabited area in the city, he suddenly shouted, “Come out!”
