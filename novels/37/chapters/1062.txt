Chapter 1063: Lady Supreme Yin

Translator: CKtalon

How could Shen Yuchi know that Zhou Wen had suffered death too many times in-game? Therefore, he was especially careful in reality. He definitely wouldn’t touch anything unknown.

However, Zhou Wen wasn’t sure if what Shen Yuchi had said was true. Just as he was about to ask something else, he suddenly heard a creak as the door to the Moon Goddess Temple opened.

Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan were immediately overjoyed. However, they didn’t dare look up and continued kneeling on the ground. Zhou Wen and Ice Maiden looked up without any qualms.

Inside the Moon Goddess Temple, there was a wooden statue. It was a dignified and beautiful woman.

When Ice Maiden saw the wooden statue, her expression immediately turned solemn. She was even somewhat alarmed as she involuntarily retreated.

However, with every step she took, frost footprints appeared on the ground. After taking a few steps back, she was frozen as though she had turned into a jade statue. Although there wasn’t any frost on her body, she gave off a feeling that she was frozen. It was extremely strange.

Zhou Wen was alarmed. Ice Maiden was an ice-elemental Terror creature. The creature in the temple had to be unimaginably powerful to freeze her.

Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan were overjoyed. They had been waiting for this moment.

Now that the Moon Goddess had appeared, the disrespectful Zhou Wen and Ice Maiden would naturally be punished.

Zhou Wen stood there motionless. Even an existence like Ice Maiden had been frozen. If he moved, he might freeze even faster than her.

Instead, he stood still and temporarily didn’t feel anything strange.

However, when he looked at the wooden sculpture, Zhou Wen lamented inwardly. He couldn’t retreat or advance.

Ice Maiden was right. It’s best not to enter such a place, Zhou Wen thought.

However, Ice Maiden was too careless. Ever since she had come to this world, the strongest she had seen was at the Terror grade. Furthermore, Zhou Wen had the Terror-grade Demonic Neonate, Grim Demon, and the Seven Seas Dragon King by his side. Therefore, although she found this place somewhat strange, she didn’t take it to heart. She felt that even if something went wrong, they should be able to resolve it. That’s why she still entered with Zhou Wen.

“Since fate has brought you here, choose one among yourselves. I will help you walk the world and do good deeds to prevent calamity.” The Moon Goddess statue’s lips didn’t move, but an ethereal voice sounded.

Zhou Wen found the line familiar. Although delivery was different, he seemed to have experienced a similar scene.

Don’t tell me it’s the one-in-three choice of Mythical Companion Beasts? As Zhou Wen thought to himself, he saw a pearl and a jade slip fly out from the Moon Goddess statue and land on the wooden table in front of the statue.

Why are there only two? Aren’t there usually three choices? Zhou Wen’s heart stirred as he immediately thought of something. So that’s how it is. Someone has been here long ago and obtained a Mythical Companion Beast from here. Shen Yuchi must have known about this long ago, so he personally came to try his luck.

However, this Moon Goddess doesn’t seem to be very picky. She actually gives Companion Beasts to anyone. Now, there are three of us, but there are only two Companion Beasts. The two of them have been kneeling here the entire time. They are very respectful of the Moon Goddess. It’s very likely that the Moon Goddess will let them choose first. After they choose, what has it got to do with me? Zhou Wen’s mind raced, but he couldn’t think of a good solution.

Zhou Wen would be thankful if the Moon Goddess didn’t find fault with him or freeze him. He didn’t dare dream of choosing a Companion Egg.

Furthermore, Zhou Wen had many Mythical Companion Beasts now. There was no need to take the risk.

Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan clearly thought the same. The two of them were overjoyed.

Wang Qiuyuan looked at Shen Yuchi and saw him nod slightly. Only then did he bow to the Moon Goddess statue. “Thank you, Your Excellency for your reward. I want that pearl.”

After he bowed, there was no reaction from the temple. The Moon Goddess didn’t speak again. The pearl became even brighter, but it didn’t fly out.

Zhou Wen found it odd. He had previously chosen Companion Eggs. After a choice was made, the Companion Beasts would typically fly over themselves.

Wang Qiuyuan didn’t know what to do. He didn’t dare enter the Moon Goddess Temple, so he could only look at Shen Yuchi.

“Don’t go in yet. Let me give it a try.” Shen Yuchi was also somewhat puzzled. It was indeed as Zhou Wen had imagined. He knew that someone had come here and knew the details, so he had personally come to try his luck.

However, the development was different from what he knew. When the person who had taken away the first Companion Beast made the choice, the Companion Beast had flown over by itself, but for some reason, there was no movement.

“Your Excellency, I choose the jade slip. Thank you for your reward,” Shen Yuchi said as he knelt.

Just as Shen Yuchi said that, the bamboo slip lit up. However, it only lit up, without any intention of moving. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Director-General, I think we need to go in and retrieve them ourselves. Why don’t I go in and take a look first?” Wang Qiuyuan said as he looked at the luminous pearl and jade slip.

Shen Yuchi nodded slightly. Wang Qiuyuan bowed again and said, “Your Excellency, I’ll be entering to retrieve the pearl.” Then, he got up and walked towards the Moon Goddess Temple.

Wang Qiuyuan was extremely excited. Although there were many more Mythical Companion Beasts available these days, they were still rare. Only a few experts had a chance of obtaining one. With his status, he had no chance of obtaining a Mythical Companion Beast.

Now, this was definitely a chance for him to achieve success in a single step. If the other inspectors who had come with him hadn’t died, this opportunity might not have landed on him.

Wang Qiuyuan walked to the door of the Moon Goddess Temple. Just as he was about to step in, frost suddenly appeared beneath his feet. Then, his entire body was frozen in front of the door. Just like Ice Maiden, there was no frost on his body. His body seemed to have turned into cold jade.

What’s going on? Isn’t she giving a Companion Beast? Why doesn’t she let them take it? Is this the Moon Goddess’s scam? Zhou Wen was alarmed. This was the first time he had seen such a scamming dimensional creature.

In the past, most of the dimensional creatures had laid obvious traps. They clearly informed people of the danger and dared them to come over.

However, Moon Goddess didn’t do so. She first told them of the benefits, only to kill them when they went over. Zhou Wen felt that she shouldn’t be called Moon Goddess, but a Scamming Goddess.

That’s right. She’s Lady Supreme Yin to begin with... There’s a second interpretation to the name... Zhou Wen thought about it and realized that the divine title made sense.

Shen Yuchi also wore a puzzled look. This was completely different from the information he had obtained, but his information couldn’t be wrong. Therefore, he didn’t know what had gone wrong.

“Did that person lie to me?” Shen Yuchi’s expression changed.

“Why didn’t you choose?” At that moment, a voice sounded from the Moon Goddess Temple. Although she didn’t say who she was talking to, there were only three people. Shen Yuchi and Wang Qiuyuan had chosen, while Zhou Wen hadn’t made a choice. She was definitely talking about Zhou Wen.

“Can I still choose?” Zhou Wen asked in surprise. This was because these items were supposed to be unique. They would be gone after being chosen.
