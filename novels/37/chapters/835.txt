Chapter 836: Fiend Stone Rebirth

Translator: CKtalon

After two days, Zhou Wen unsummoned Tyrant Behemoth. Zhang Xiao didn’t come looking for him; it was considered a tacit understanding.

When Tyrant Behemoth vanished, Zhang Xiao heaved a sigh of relief. If he reared it for a month, he would really go bankrupt.

Zhou Wen had been waiting for Liu Yun, but before he arrived, Zhang Chunqiu rushed over to find him.

“Zhou Wen, there’s a problem with the Fiend Tomb. Can you lend me your Tyrant Behemoth again?” Zhang Chunqiu’s expression was solemn. It looked like things were really serious.

“What happened?” Zhou Wen needed to know more due to the severity of the matter. He couldn’t risk Tyrant Behemoth.

“The Fiend Stones that grew out of Fiend Tomb had already been eaten by Tyrant Behemoth. Nothing happened in the past few days, but just now, the Fiend Stones have begun to grow again. Furthermore, their growth speed is even faster than before. I want to borrow your Tyrant Behemoth to try eating them up again,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“Is it convenient for me to go with you?” Zhou Wen asked.

“Of course. Follow me.” Zhang Chunqiu didn’t say anything else as he turned around and led the way.

After leaving the town, Zhang Chunqiu summoned an immortal crane and set off with Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen originally imagined that the vicinity of Mount Dragon Tiger was like a fairyland, but after arriving at the Fiend Tomb, he realized that it wasn’t the case.

There was a place in the mountain where all vegetation died. Nothing grew. In broad daylight, the sun could clearly release its rays down, but the area felt extremely dark and eerie.

In an inconspicuous spot, Zhou Wen saw a tiny grave without a tombstone. If Zhang Chunqiu hadn’t said that it was a Fiend Tomb, Zhou Wen wouldn’t have imagined that this tiny grave would have such a huge back story behind it.

The only strange thing about this grave was its material. The graves of ordinary people were made of mud. Higher-level ones were made of rocks or bricks. Even higher-level ones were made of jade or even metal.

Although the grave was made of stone, the stone wasn’t man-made. It was as though the grave had grown out of stone.

The grayish-white stone seemed to emit a sinister aura. And near the grave, a large number of rocks appeared to have the same texture. They looked out of place with the mountain wall beside them, as though a layer of frost had covered the valley.

In every direction of the grave, there was a man-made stone platform. On each stone platform were members of the Zhang family. They monitored the Fiend Tomb from different angles.

Zhang Chunqiu landed on one of the stone platforms with Zhou Wen and pointed at the grayish-white Fiend Stones beside him. “Please get Tyrant Behemoth to eat the grayish-white Fiend Stones over there.”

“Alright.” Zhou Wen summoned Tyrant Behemoth and got it to eat the grayish-white Fiend Stones.

According to Zhang Chunqiu’s instructions, Tyrant Behemoth stopped after eating a portion of the Fiend Stones.

“Alright, we are now waiting for the outcome. If you have the time, you can stay and take a look. If you don’t have time, I can get someone to take you back now,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“If it’s convenient, I want to stay and take a look.” Zhou Wen also wanted to see what was so special about the Fiend Tomb that the Zhang family had protected for so many years.

“You can stay, but remember not to leave this platform, especially at night,” Zhang Chunqiu exhorted Zhou Wen repeatedly.

Zhou Wen naturally wouldn’t joke around with his life and agreed readily.

The Fiend Stones didn’t seem to grow in that short period of time. It had been a few days since Tyrant Behemoth ate the Fiend Stones last time before they grew again; therefore, they wouldn’t grow back so quickly.

Zhou Wen didn’t stare at that spot. Instead, he looked around the Fiend Tomb to see if he could find the tiny palm symbol. After carefully searching the vicinity, Zhou Wen’s eyes suddenly lit up.

Behind the tiny grave, Zhou Wen saw a tiny palm symbol with Truth Listener. It was engraved on the grave’s stone. As the stone wasn’t very flat, it looked like a natural pattern. However, Zhou Wen had seen many tiny palm symbols, so he definitely wouldn’t mistake them.

However, Zhou Wen was in trouble again. Although he had found the tiny palm symbol, Zhang Chunqiu had repeatedly exhorted him not to leave the platform. How could he walk to the Fiend Tomb to take a picture?

Furthermore, it was already an exception for the Zhang family to let him come here. It was impossible for him to take pictures with his phone. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

How can I take a picture? Zhou Wen thought for a while but failed to come up with a good solution.

Just as he was fretting, he suddenly heard someone shout, “It’s growing... It’s growing again...”

Zhou Wen was alarmed as he hurriedly looked at the Fiend Stone hole that Tyrant Behemoth had produced from taking a big mouthful. He saw Fiend Stones appear on the ground that had been completely cleared.

The Fiend Stones were like bamboo shoots after the rain, rapidly growing.

This was the first time Zhou Wen had seen a stone grow.

“This time, the regrowth time is even shorter. It regrew in less than half an hour,” a member of the Zhang family said worriedly.

“Has this happened before?” Zhou Wen asked.

The Zhang family had been guarding the Fiend Tomb for so many years. They should have come up with means to deal with the Fiend Stones in the past.

To his surprise, Zhang Chunqiu shook his head and said, “In the past, the growth speed of the Fiend Stones was very slow. After the dimensional storms, the speed of growth gradually increased. In recent months, the speed of growth was much faster than before. In the past, the Fiend Stones only extended less than ten meters around the Fiend Tomb. Look at it now. In just a few months, it will probably reach almost a hundred meters.”

“In other words, you haven’t dealt with the Fiend Stones before?” Zhou Wen found it unbelievable.

“Of course. However, we only took a small portion of the Fiend Stones and took them back for research. We didn’t dig up the Fiend Stones on such a large scale. There has never been such a situation in the past. Although the place where the Fiend Stones were dug out still grew new Fiend Stones, it happened very slowly. It has never been this fast,” Zhang Chunqiu said.

“What’s that?” Suddenly, someone pointed at the spot where the Fiend Stones grew and exclaimed in surprise.

Zhou Wen and Zhang Chunqiu looked over and saw a human face symbol appear at the spot where the Fiend Stones grew. The symbol grew on the Fiend Stone as though a person was embedded in it. It looked extremely strange.

“Has this happened before?” Zhou Wen asked Zhang Chunqiu.

This time, Zhang Chunqiu only shook his head as he stared at the face on the Fiend Stone. At the same time, he ordered, “Everyone, enter an emergency state.”

Everyone tensed up. Everyone in the Zhang family knew how terrifying the Fiend Tomb was. Zhou Wen, who had no concept of the Fiend Tomb, had an ominous feeling.
